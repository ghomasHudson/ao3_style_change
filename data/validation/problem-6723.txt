To say Tony was breathless was an understatement. “History books didn’t bullshit when they said you were good at this speech thing.” He was deflecting, and he knew it, but so did Steve as he sighed tiredly and closed his eyes.
Once they arrived, Natasha unceremoniously yanked the door open and entered, holding it open so Tony could pass through. He begrudgingly did so, only to find himself frowning at the sight.
Trying to convince himself of that didn't keep the irritation from seeping through his tone, however, "Mrs. Thompson, wouldn’t you like to address your son's potential misbehavior?"
The video came to an end and television shut off, which left Tony to click his tongue in annoyance, "That's all there is, J?"
lower himself to his level, but he knew that even though all of this was absolute terrifying to him and that he was basically exploding with anger and resentment, there was no denial that even after all those years he never really got over Steve... and he wasn’t sure if he ever would.
Tony narrowed his eyes as he stared at the screen. Surely looking into F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s recordings from past days due boredom wouldn’t be much of a fun activity, but he had done it anyway because... why not? Sure the compound had mostly been silent back then after the fall out between him and Steve, that ended up fracturing and tearing the Avengers apart, but at least Tony would get to check what he missed, even if they were little details he wouldn’t give much of a damn about in normal days.
Steve sighed and shook his head in amusement, "Alright, what do you need us to do? And Barton, get your feet off the table and stop being a brat. This is not your floor."
Blinking the stars out of his sight, realization struck Tony like a wayward cannon ball. Never, in his entire fucking life, had he ever orgasmed without any actual penetration. He didn’t know if the guys he actually bottomed to were just lacking the enthusiasm or the competence, because even overly confident guys with great amounts of ‘expertise’ barely ever even got him cum by the end of it - hence why he much preferred to top even while being with guys - but
That was until Peter decided it would be absurdly smart to deal with the vulture guy by himself, and nearly got himself killed in the process.
Mrs. Thompson's mouth fell ajar, and there was a range of emotions on her face going from scandalized to outright embarrassed, but she didn't say anything else. Pepper would probably scold him for two hours because of his sharp tongue, but he couldn't bring himself to give a fuck. Anyone should know better than to try to act arrogant towards Tony Stark. You mess with the cat, you get the claws. It was simple as that.
Or so he thought, until Nick Fury told him the tesseract had fallen into the wrong hands, and he was expected to help in the retrieval. From that moment on, Steve was shown that while he may have lost everything, waking up in the future wasn’t quite a curse or a punishment, but yes his second chance on the life he was robbed of. He used to think that was impossible for him, that his chances had passed and the man who wanted the “white picket-fence life” had gone under the ice and stayed frozen, while a completely different version of himself emerged to brave this foreign world. That was something he believed for quite some time, but it was amazing how while you have plans for life, it normally has plans for you.
Steve rolled his eyes and placed the phone back on top of the counter on his way back to the kitchen, and soon he was back to work. "FRIDAY, can you please warn Harley to go clean himself as well?"
Steve went up to him to kiss his lips without really stopping his movements, earning countless small gasps from Tony as they kissed, “How am I fairing?”
. He was already appalled to see some women fighting together as they conquered their lands, but those were
When Tony started this story of ‘putting an armour around the world’, he had no idea things would turn out this way. How could he know Ultron would become a murderous robot that would distort everything he said into world annihilation instead of salvation? It was beyond what Tony could have imagined happening, and yet here he was, inside a dusty room inside a barn at Clint’s family farm - which, by the way, he didn’t even know existed up to this point.
Tony felt those metaphorical butterflies that books speak so much about flutter inside his stomach. Why was it so good to hear Steve thanking him? "Anytime, big guy."
Steve stepped even closer, eyes becoming serious. Focused. “What happened? Was there an attack while we were out? Are you okay?”
"That's right, he should know better." Both Tony and Peter’s father whipped their heads towards Mrs. Thompson, who apparently had found her voice again. Wonderful. "He shouldn't go around punching other kids like that!"
“Very well,” he turned towards the horizon, already knowing the path in which they should take in order to reach the Stark lands like the back of his hand, and without preamble, shouted the final order, “Let’s go!”
A few seconds went by on the footage and JARVIS purposely zoomed on Peter and Ned's table.  They were eating and talking excitedly about Star Wars, which caused Tony to hold back a smirk – the  kid had good taste. However, upon noticing the feed had not only high quality image, but also high quality sound, Flash seemed outright panicked, which did not bode well for the boy, even though his mother stood above him with a far too confident expression. She was apparently in for a treat if the boy’s skittish behavior was any indication.
attractive than he had in the footage, with his full beard perfectly trimmed and hair even longer since it looked before, seemingly tied up in a loose bun as some loose strands framed his handsome face.
It was Obadiah’s turn to laugh in amusement, “Sorry to break it to you, my friend, but Captain Rogers is probably
Later that day, it was playtime, and Mrs. Maximoff had quickly left the classroom in order to go to the restroom, trusting the kids would be too entertained with their toys and games to cause any trouble - but my oh my, how wrong had she been.
Then, as they left the room to go prepare for the trip, Natasha gently pulled him down on her way out of the room to whisper in his ear, “
Clearly that was the last drop for the man, as he finally let go of his chivalry and snapped at the woman with a commanding tone Tony could easily picture him using on the battlefield, "You better stop being a damn hypocrite and stop calling my son that. He was merely reacting to your kid's bullying!"
Soon enough, Tony reached his goal: the room he had been using for himself. He quickly opened the door and pulled Steve inside, making haste to close it behind him, chest moving erratically as he stuck himself to the door and stared at Steve, who was standing in the middle of the room with an arched brow and crossed arms.
A chorus of confused and startled voices sounded around them, but everyone got to their feet to do as they were told while Steve turned back to Sam, “Go get all your birds in the air. I need eyes everywhere.” He commanded, earning a curt nod from Sam before he rushed out. Steve then proceeded to run towards Dodger, who was already running towards him and lowering himself so Steve could mount on his back. “Bucky, what are you looking at? Call Phantom and Alpine already!”
He smashed the letter between his fingers and growled quietly. That damn weasel of a king had just set the hounds loose after him, the bastard. Tiberius better get through with his part of the deal and get Tony ready for the next part of the plan, because they say nobody has ever managed to escape the Captain and his vicious companions before, but well, Obadiah was nothing if not tenacious, and after coming this far, he was decided to be the first man to achieve the impossible feat of escaping the Howling Commandos’ deadly claws.
“Not really. I just came to check on you.” Tony tried to hold back his look of surprise, but clearly wasn’t able since Rogers crossed his arms against his absurdly wide chest and quirked a brow in his direction, “What? I can’t check on one of my teammates now?”
“Yeah, you made that pretty clear,” she rolled her eyes, not unkindly, and smirked at him, “spill, tin can.”
would be fine, but them?” He rose his look to meet Bucky’s, and his second in command almost flinched at the amount of pain and anguish currently residing inside Steve’s azure eyes, “I was supposed to keep them safe, Bucky. I ignored my damn instincts, and now they are
That got both Nat and Clint laughing, while Steve cocked a brow at his disgruntled co-leader, "And why is that so important? Your height does not affect your importance or position in our team, Tony."
“I’ve known you long enough to understand how your mind works, and I also know you see yourself as expendable when others are at risk,” Steve explained as a guilty smile appeared on his lips, “And I made the mistake of not listening to you before; about the ‘suit of armor around the world’, or even trying to figure out the accords together. I made the mistake of keeping things from you that I had no right to, only because I was afraid, and look where these foolish mistakes got us.” Steve’s expression became forlorn, sorrowful, and Tony felt his heart clench inside his chest. “I wasn’t there when you needed me, we weren’t together as I promised we’d be, and if you had used those damn stones to save us at the cost of your life, I don’t—” his tone wavered, and he inhaled sharply, “If you had died that day, I don’t think I’d be able to live with myself,” he finally confessed, closing his eyes in what felt like surrender, “You have no idea how empty life feels without you in it.”
, he had gotten it all wrong. Their fight had affected Steve as bad as it had affected him, and Tony had no idea know how to process that.
“You are clearly not in your right mind, man. You haven’t said a thing ever since we left King Hammer’s kingdom, and you have this look that is honestly fuckin’ terrifying to look at.”
” —, and Tony would have been annoyed had he not been a besotted fool that couldn’t handle a smile from the man without blushing like a schoolgirl with a crush
The wave of arousal that crashed against Tony was so overwhelming that the only thing Tony could do other than whimper, was enlace his soldier’s hips with his legs and gain the upper hand again, having Steve lying down on the bed and look up at him with wonder and surprise. “Tony?”
This went by for months, and Pepper desperately tried to get Tony to focus, to remember he had a little girl that needed him, but he could barely manage to even look at Morgan without breaking down completely. She looked too much like Darlene for him to be able to handle it, so for the first year of her life, Morgan barely saw or interacted with her father.
"T-Then that should apply to that brat as well! He inflicted bodily harm on mine!" Mrs. Thompson argued, her panicked voice sounding almost like a shriek and bothering Tony's ears.
“Hm,” Steve hummed thoughtfully, kissing up Tony’s neck until he was nipping at his earlobe, “were you?”
Steve, albeit clearly confused, didn’t question him any further and simply went willingly with Tony, who was trying really hard to ignore the way warmth flooded inside him as soon as his skin came in contact with Steve’s. It was absurd how much the damn captain affected him; it was absurd and unfair.
, stop being so dramatic," Nat admonished as she gently patted his cheek, his lower lip jutting out in a pout, "now, what has big green done this time?"
"Gone." Steve calmly said, surprising Tony and causing him to look around. Indeed, the others were nowhere to be seen, "Nat pulled both out at some point."
“Sure thing, Mr. Stark!” Peter agreed, but then looked around, seeming to be looking for someone. Tony cocked a brow at him, and when Peter noticed he was caught, he rubbed at his neck shyly, “Uh… Isn’t there any chance I could maybe meet Captain Rogers properly this time, is there?”
Now, Steve Rogers? That man was stubborn, loyal, and afraid of his mistakes like everyone else was, and while the truth would probably tarnish Cap’s renowned reputation if it ever came to light, Tony learned an important thing about the man he came to love and cherish.
“How did it feel, hm?” Tony asked jokingly, but actually wanting to know. He was not one to be insecure about his proficiency at bed, but it has been awhile since he’s last done this, and this was
The smile that formed on Tony’s lips was fond, “Come on, big guy, we are trying to deal with my own self-deprecating tendencies, don’t fall prey to yours.”
“Pops!” A young voice called, startling him out of his reverie and causing him to turn around towards it, “Didn’t think I’d catch you home today. What’s the occasion?”
"Since when do you lead anything?" Clint asked nonchalantly, resritng his feet on the marble coffee table while throwing the cushion up and down without a care in the world.
Tony exhaled shakily, “Thank you, baby girl.” and practically jumped out of the couch, not bothering to even think as he stormed through the compound’s empty corridors that echoed his hurried steps and loud panting. His heart felt like bursting through his ribcage, and in his mind, he chanted like a prayer.
"There is hardly anything 'good' about this afternoon, Mr. Stark." Mrs. Thompson barked while pointing at Peter, "My darling boy was violently assaulted by that little delinquent under your 'prestigious' school's roof!"
“I have my secrets, and I assure you, that beard is as soft as it looks, I made sure of that.” She gently patted his arm, “Get ready though, he’s like a big puppy who missed his owner. Wouldn’t stop asking me about you during the entire mission, it was adorable.”
hands found the skin beneath his shirt, grabbing roughly at his waist and causing him to gasp into the kiss. The heated touch seemed to be too much for him to handle, and his knees failed him for good, but Steve’s firm grip was there to bring Tony up enough so he could lock his legs around the supersoldier’s narrow waist and be kept aloft as if he didn’t weigh more than a plume.
To say Mrs. Maximoff was shocked was an understatement, and the same could be said for the rest of the class, who were wide eyed and gawking and their new colleague. “Squared root of 15000?” Mrs. Maximoff ventured.
without considering the consequences, then you definitely are not fucking fit to lead this damn team anywhere!”
“Well, it’s a good thing we’re on the same page, then,” Steve licked at his lower lip, and Tony felt his heart momentarily stop, “because I am done waiting.”
. Steve had waited anxiously for his calls, even if they might mean Tony cursing Steve’s absolute everything. Steve had kept his Captain America uniform regardless of how ruined it was, because it was a memento from Tony. A memento he remembers spending
that had been suppressed for an entire decade. Their tongues moved together in a sensual dance that neither seemed able to have enough, and soon they were fighting for dominance, angling their heads for better positions as they kissed and moved and felt and
regardless of the beat up Captain America suit and the black circles under his eyes. He looked like a damn street hobo in a way one would never expect Captain America look, and Tony was just so damn angry at the fact that the infuriating man managed to pull off that look and look drop-dead gorgeous in it.
The trio exchanged amused glances, but did as they were told. Tony went for Natasha first, placing his palm against hers. It was petite, and fit almost snuggly against his. She smiled at him and winked, "Tiny but murderous, try not to forget that."
Now Tony couldn't hold back the snort. "I don't need the money I earn from this place, ma'am, it all goes to Maria Stark's Foundation as a way of helping those in need, but if you truly want an answer why I'm 'favoring' Peter,” yes, he did the air quotes, "which I'm not, since he still will receive his own punishment, then let me show you why. I didn't want to do this, but you left me no choice. JARVIS?"
“If you boys are done kissing each other’s asses, we are ready to leave,” Sharon appeared on Steve’s side on top of her mount, a pearly white wolf with bright green eyes and a caramel muzzle, and gestured with her head towards the assembled team, “with enough incentive, the wolves can get to the Stark Clan lands way before sunrise.”
“Nope. Knowing myself, I’ll back down in the last minute if I try to talk things out right now, but maybe a little visual incentive will help to strengthen my resolve.” He finished wiggling his brows comically and causing Carol to burst out laughing and shake her head fondly.
Steve scoffed, rounding the table and heading towards the hut’s exit, “Maybe not, but it doesn’t matter.”
hours, only to get back home and get beaten nearly to death by my grieving drunkard of a father, so if you are honestly thinking you can just walk back into my life and that I’ll gladly open my arms and accept you back, I have

“The same as yesterday, or do you honestly think he’d suddenly forgive and warm up to the men who anihilated his entire clan?” Obadiah questioned with an arched brow, earning a pout from Tiberius.
” Steve answered as he looked forward, elbows resting on his knees while his fingers intertwined in front of his chin. Bruce stared at him, seeming speechless, while Tony gawked at the screen.
It was warm and thick, given this was Steve’s first time orgasming in probably a long time - Tony refused to think the man didn’t even use his own hand to seek out some relief sometimes -, so Tony had a hard time swallowing it, but he did regardless, because this was all
? You just gave me the best sex I’ve ever had, and you are seriously asking if I’m okay?” He watched triumphantly as Steve’s face acquired that adorable blush and he chuckled, ducking his head in embarrassment. Tony kissed his palm, “I feel fucking
Tony was not about to lose any time, so he proceeded with his work, bobbing his head up and down in a lazy pace that clearly had Steve losing his mind as he whrithed helplessly on the bed. Tony was also losing his mind a way, but because it was ridiculous how delicious Steve’s taste was. Tony expected it to be good, but this was on a completely different level and he wondered if the serum had anything to do with it as he backed down from Steve’s cock and gave his balls attention while pumping him with a hand. The man was a moaning mess on the bed, which only made Tony even more excited to continue. Steve was just so damn

” He had said, regardless of his clear desire to pick up the vibranium disk, and Tony had thought he was just being all righteous ‘Captain America-y’ about it, not that he was uncertain because he feeling unworthy due
“Wow, you really must hate me.” Steve’s weak chuckle startled him back to reality, having him look towards the man, who had a sorrowful look in his eyes as he watched their girls on the playground’s swings.
Barton groaned, shoving a cushion against his face, "Again? But the baseball game is about to start!"
His legs failed him when Steve actually pressed him against the wall, but the big hands that were still holding his released their hold on them and proceeded to snake through his waist, pulling him flush against the wall of muscles that was Steve Rogers, traveling through the expanse of Tony's back from under his shirt and successfully making him melt.
?” Tiberius spat the name in disgust, “The leader of the flea bags?!” Obadiah nodded, and Tiberius scoffed, “Oh
Which was why four years later when Peter Parker, then 13 years old and recently orphaned for the second time, needed a new home, he didn’t hesitate for a second before taking him in. Peter had lost his birth parents when he was much younger, then being raised by his uncle and aunt. However, fatality striked again when the boy’s uncle was victim of a violent mugging that ended in his death, and with his aunt suffering from chronic depression and not being able to care for him anymore, Peter would have gone into the system until he turned eighteen. Pepper, who was a close friend of the family, brought the situation to Tony one day when he noticed she had been crying at her table. Her distress was palpable since she adored Peter and was heartbreaking to see May in the situation she was, so Tony decided to step in to not only take the custody of the boy, but also pay for May’s treatment and keep her bills and house paid without her needing to worry about it, all while allowing Peter to make her constant visits.
Tony felt his insides melt at the man's concern that his son still got a lesson out of this. The way Peter behaved on a daily basis was already a clear sign of Mr. Rogers’ excellent parenting, but seeing the man doing it in person was even more satisfying than Tony could have imagined, since Tony's own references of parenthood turned out to be a distant cold asshole and a backstabbing treacherous snake.
“Shit. Shit. What the hell?” Tony gasped out as Steve continued to massage his prostate and slowly stretch him, and when a third finger was added, Steve had to actually shut him out with a kiss, unless they wanted Tony’s scream to actually wake up everyone currently sleeping at Clint’s main house. Steve quickened the pace of his fingers just as he fastened the strokes on his cock, panting himself against Tony’s mouth as he breathlessly chanted Steve’a name non-stop.
Howard beamed, “Thank you, good sir. I assure you, you will not regret this! I’m sure we can talk business afterwards, maybe an alliance? A man of your power with my weapons, you’ll be able to take over the continent in the blink of an eye!”
“You’ll love it, don’t worry.” Tony reassured while fumbling with the rim of Steve’s pants, which instantly had the man sitting up and holding his hands.
Tony had tried to warn his father once. He had caught Tiberius snooping around in Howard’s room, and he was pretty sure he saw the man slipping something inside a pocket as soon as Tony entered the room to question what he was doing. Tiberius had been dismissive, saying only that he had come find something his father was procuring for the king, but Tony had his doubts, so he asked Howard about it, only to be backhanded on the cheek and told to ‘stay the fuck out of royal business’. The explosive reaction had shocked Tony and stunned him into silence, and from that day on, he never commented to anyone anymore whenever he noticed Obadiah or Tiberius up to anything suspicious or entering places they had no business entering. Tony tried to force himself into obliviousness, his self-preservation begging him to avoid trying to push the matter, to insist, to ask questions—things he found himself wanting to do on a daily basis. He knew better than to incite Howard’s anger again, so despite his better judgment, he focused only on his studies and his inventions—Jarvis’ constant presence being what helped warm his heart during his often lonely days.
Hey peeps. I have been dealing with some emotional hardships lately so I'm not feeling the best, which means I'm not overly satisfied with the quality of this chapter. I do hope y'all like it though, maybe I'm just being too hard on myself.
“Hey, shush,” Tony placed his index finger against Steve’s lips, shutting him up. “You are not forcing me into doing anything, Cap, and I’d be lying if I said I’m not inclined to do this. I mean, have you
"Jesus, what the hell? Do you two really need to be so good at sneaking up on people?" Tony complained, massaging the spot on his chest where the arc reactor sat. That earned him a chuckle from Steve and a smirk from Natasha.
“Does he hurt your daddy?!” Mary angrily questioned, tightening the hold of her little palms on the chains of the swing, “Or you and your big brother?”
“I don’t know,” Steve looked right into his eyes, in a way that made Tony shudder beneath the gaze that seemed to be seeing through his very soul, “are we?”
He pressed play and allowed the video to resume, unashamedly demanding F.R.I.D.A.Y. to zoom on Steve’s cold expression and focusing on every detail of the captain’s face, while completely ignoring whatever bullshit Ross was yapping about. Just the man’s voice was enough to annoy Tony, but he couldn’t care — he was far too distracted with the sights.
Mr. Rogers openly scowled at that, but otherwise remained silent while gripping at his son's shoulders. It was clear he was a second from snapping at the woman and her twisted ideals, but something kept him from doing it, and Tony had the feeling it had something to do with being chivalrous – even though the bitch didn't deserve it. What a man.
to find skin, touch starved as they were for each other due years of wait and patience. The feelings were so overwhelming that Tony was a panting mess in a matter of seconds, his mind a complete disarray of desire and anticipation — scrambled everywhere like the stars that seemed to shine underneath his trembling eyelids. Steve’s touches were hungry, demanding, borderline
Tony backed out slightly, allowing Steve to lie down on the bed and looked up at him while he remained propped on an elbow. “That bad huh.”
"No need for that. I thought you said you didn't regret anything, Peter?" Tony smiled warmly at the boy, "Or you are going back on your word? True men never go back on their word."
“For a one hundred year old virgin, you sure kiss like an expert, Mr. Rogers.” Tony teased, which had Steve backing away slightly to look at him with a half-smile and a quirked up brow.
"I just earned my third legal process this week in order to defend your kid, so I guess that makes us friends."
“You sound heavenly, love,” Steve practically purred against the column of his throat, which he was currently kissing, “So good, so beautiful.”
Carol hadn’t suffered the same amount of damage that Bruce had after the snap, but her arm was in a terrible shape and she needed immediate medical attention if she wanted to keep the limb and have it functioning again. Natasha volunteered to look after her, saying she owed Carol for saving her life back in Vormir, and nobody really argued with her since she looked as fierce and deadly as she had looked when Carol had fallen clutching her wounded arm.
Tony’s thoughts balked for a moment at the usage of his given name, since this was probably the first time ever Rogers had used it, but he wrestled his thoughts back to their conversation. He had no business getting fluttery just because Captain America addressed him differently. “Yeah, right, says America’s Golden Boy.”
Tony released a low grunt as heat pooled in his gut, causing him to clench his fists on top of the table as he attempted to gather his bearings. ‘
Steve smiled at that, “That’s good to know,” and then proceeded to remove Tony’s own shirt and force him to lie down on the bed this time, “my turn.”
“Alright, so let me try to be more specific,” she pinned Tony with a serious look, which had him perking up and promptly focusing on her, “When I arrived on earth for the first time due Fury’s distress call, Rogers was sporting this ‘hot’ look you are so over the moon about, and quite frankly? He looked like
Mr. Rogers paused at that, just so a curious smile could tug at the corners of his lips, "I thought only friends were on a first name basis with you?"
When Steve's laughter died out, both remained where they stood, neither moving or speaking as they looked into each other's eyes. Tony wasn't sure what had gotten into him today, but he just didn't seem able to look away from those glorious blue eyes that just happened to keep his own captive. Time seemed to stand still between the two of them, and Tony took the opportunity to drink in the glorious sight before him.
"Is that so?" Steve softly asked, interlocking their fingers and gently pressing the pads of his fingers on the back of Tony's hand, practically swallowing it, "I disagree."
"Hey, I haven't done anything!" Bruce protested at the same time Tony said, "He called me tiny, so I want to prove him that I'm not that small."
Steve Rogers had two gifted children – one as gifted as Tony himself –, and he didn't parade them around like circus animals because of it like Howard had done to him. The only thing Steve cared about was providing the best life for the both of them, and hopefully, offering both a healthy dose of normalcy any child needed during their childhood, away from Harvard professors, stupid tests, and the vultures of the media.
The aftermath was a disaster. Pepper had to step up to look after Morgan with the help of Rhodey, because Tony completely lost it. He threw himself into vices, never ending one night stands with both women and men, got himself a terrible long list of scandals that only served to rile up Howard more and more each day, so much that he transferred most of Tony’s power on the company to Obadiah - his until then “trustworthy” friend -, not that Tony gave a damn.
Tony couldn’t help but to bark out a laugh, “Nevermind, not worth your time.” He then proceeded to trace lines on the planes of Steve’s pecs, taking his sweet time as he felt the muscles under his touch tensing up slightly, “But… that means you have never been with anyone
. The amount of times I had to lecture him about his lack of self-preservation.” She sighed in exasperation, which caused Carol to chuckle.
Morgan held back the urge to yawn for the third time in the last ten minutes. Her teacher kept going on and on about animals and how to spell their names, and there was no doubt Morgan
“Not that I want to interrupt our mighty leaders’ from biting each other’s heads off, but already interrupting,” Sam’s voice cut in, getting two pairs of fiery blue eyes to glare daggers at him and cause him to raise his hands in surrender, “No need to take a bite of mine as well, I just wanted to relay some important info I got ahold of.”
“Honestly,” Steve laughed in amusement, resuming his assault against the skin of Tony’s neck and whispering against it, “you could have just asked, darling. I’d do anything for you.”
Talking about the harpy, Tony finally focused back on her just in time to hear her last sentence, "— and I should have known better than to allow Flash stay in here when you came up with this ridiculous scholarship announcement! If I wanted my child to be near dirty commoners, I would have placed him on a public school!"
”Therefore, seeing how Tony cares greatly about that old man - and seemed more devastated about the prospect of his death than of his own father’s -, I decided to spare him and use him to keep my darling nephew obedient. As long as he obeys me and stays put, Jarvis lives.” He turned to Tiberius, “If he disobeys, the butler dies, and I’ll be sure to make him watch it.”
Steve was staring at him as if he had grown a second head, but after a minute of thought, he relented, "4 x 67"
” and then proceeded to laugh, the bastard - Peter still went after the big bad wearing nothing but pajamas and homemade web-shooters. Tony, who had been on a romantic date night with Steve at the compound then, was justifiably
“Just arrived. Sent him for a shower. Can you believe he tried to skip showering just because it was a ‘slow night’? God, this is your fault. You are a terrible role model when you camp out inside that workshop of yours for three days straight.”
The war was brutal once the armies clashed, and the battle would make into history books as the day life on earth as it was almost ended, but thanks to the overpowering conjoined leadership of Iron Man and Captain America, Thanos’ forces had no option but to retreat once their leader was overwhelmed by earth’s mightiest heroes, and as the Titan was defeated and his head rolled, a message was sent to all the other worlds out there: think twice before attempting an attack on earth.
Tony felt his entire face warm up at the lustful gaze currently bring directed at him as Steve's breath ghosted against his knuckles and caused a crushing amount of want to pool inside his stomach. He licked his own lips, suddenly feeling hungry and thirsty at the same time, as he uttered a small and simple order, "Bed. Now."
Tony felt his feet moving and he walked towards Steve until they met halfway, his eyes dripping uncertainty as he asked, “How come? I thought I was the guy who didn’t have value of a handful of other men you’ve met?” He boldly questioned regardless of his stuttering heart, not missing how Steve’s eyes sparkled with guilt, “How come I have more worth than the almighty Captain America, Steve?”
As if on cue, the door opened again, and in came the new student accompanied by Mrs. Romanoff. Morgan rose her look once more to meet the newcomer, and found herself tilting her head slightly. The new girl didn’t seem shy and out of place like most new students got. Instead, she had an annoyed expression and a frown that screamed she wanted to be
“Angry?!” Tony exploded, turning to glare daggers into Steve as he proceeded hotly, “Oh no, Steve, I’m not ‘angry’,” he made air quotations with his fingers, “I’m absolutely
Tony paused for a second, but only a second, "516,720142 plus other 8 numbers I'm too lazy to list."
” He heard himself beg as his body continued to burn like a furnace, and it should have been revolting to him - Tony Stark did not beg. Tony Stark
He shook his head, “That’s exactly what I meant by saying I’m not perfect, Tony. No matter what comic books or even history books say about me, I’m not a god, I’m just a kid from Brooklyn who happened to get juiced up by a mad scientist.” That fond and breathtaking smile made a comeback, “and isn’t it just ironic how I’m always getting entangled with mad scientists that just happen to turn my world upside down somehow?”
backpack - and once the girl hung it on one of the colorful hooks on one of the classroom’s walls, she went for a seat across Morgan and sullenly sat down; frown never leaving her forehead.
“I’m not!” Morgan immediately denied, earning a raised brow from her daddy, “I swear, daddy! And didn’t big brother say he would spend the night at his friend’s house today? It’s the perfect opportunity!”
Howard rolled his eyes, focusing back on his scrolls, “Spare me of your theatrics, Anthony. It’s just marriage, not the end of the world. And besides, I’m sure Tiberius will become quite reasonable as long as you keep him satisfied. It’s come to my knowledge he fancies you and your useless petite body for some reason, so might as well indulge his needs since you are not good for much else.”
“He is, but he is also coming home tonight,” Steve explained, turning back to the stove and to the meal he was preparing, “so we will be welcoming him with a family dinner. Your aunts and uncles must be arriving soon.”
Do you know the real reason why Pepper wasn’t at the party?” He inquired sullenly, to which Steve only shook his head negatively, “We had a fight. I was supposed to let this whole superhero gig go after what happened with the Mandarin, when she
, he hadn’t even seen Barnes and Wilson pass by. “Told you I’d make him look ravishing.” She said with a proud smile, while Wanda chuckled against her hand.
Suddenly, a pair of strong arms were pulling him into a tight hug. His head came to rest on Steve’s collarbone as the man’s hold on his back tightened in a way that would be almost painful if it wasn’t just what he needed right now.
That had stunned Tony into a shocked silence. That had been the cruelest thing his father—should he even address that man as ‘father’?—had ever said to him in all his 20 years of life, and it had been too much for him to bear, so he did nothing but flee the throne room without waiting to be dismissed, heading straight to Jarvis’ quarters crying inside his caretaker’s embrace until he had no tears left to cry and passed out of exhaustion.
“I haven’t attacked any barbarian lands, whatever do you mean?!” Howard countered acidly, causing Tony’s heart to acquire a frantic rhythm. “My armies remain by my kingdom at all times! The only time anything of the like happened was when— when—”
The class chorused an agreement and then an excited greeting towards Mary, who just grasped the straps of her backpack tighter and narrowed her bright blue eyes at everyone. “Hi”, she whisper greeted back, seeming awfully unsure of herself, and Morgan couldn’t help but to wince a little bit in sympathy fot the girl’s uneasiness. Yes, Mary was truly just as uncomfortable as she had been on her first day.
concerned about allowing a teenager going off against the big guys, so Tony relented about benching the kid at least until everything about the adjustment of the accords was solved and they would have time to give Peter the training he needed to maybe become a part of the Avengers one day.
Steve barked a laugh at that, resting his forehead against the base of Tony’s neck, “You are incorrigible.”
Tiberius cackled, “Now that’s just rotten, Obie!” He pointed out, taking a swing of his scotch and loudly setting the glass down on the table, “I love it!”
Flash's laughter in the video ruined the tender moment for Tony. "As if someone dirty and poor as you would know anything about how the high class behaves!"
“Shut up,” Tony pushed his face away whilst laughing, causing Steve to chuckle and nuzzle against Tony’s hand and then nibble at it, “Stop it, you grizzly bear.”
Morgan’s eyes widened, and she felt justified anger spark within her little heart. “Don’t call my daddy that bad word! You take that back right now!”
?! Tony didn’t remember EVER being thanked for willingly giving head, even though he was pretty sure he always did a great job, but Steve was just so genuine and absolutely
Mrs. Romanoff guided the new girl towards Mrs. Maximoff, and after a quick nod, she turned around and left from whence she came. Mrs. Maximoff’s smile hadn’t dimmed even a bit, and as she placed a hand on top of the new girl’s golden hair - it was so pretty! - she addressed the class once more, “Darlings, this is Mary Sarah Rogers. Please be kind and welcome her with open arms, yes?”
To say Tony was impressed was an understatement. "Is that so? And do you think that hurting people is the correct way of fixing things?"
Tony stared at her serious expression and considered his options, worrying his bottom lip as he thought about the possible consequences for any step he decided to take.
They were talking about something Tony couldn't quite hear, but Barton and Steve were sitting on one of the couches while Natasha sat atop the kitchen island, munching on a PB&J sandwich. The sight was almost too domestic, and the thought of it warmed Tony's heart in a way he wasn't quite expecting.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve greeted softly, warmth radiating from him like he was Tony’s own personal sun, “been awhile. How have you been?”
Tony worried his lower lip. There is no way Steve meant Strange or the kid, seeing he didn’t know either that well back then, so unless any other avenger had gone into space after him, Steve had most likely referred to Tony, and he had no idea how that made him feel. Happy? Shocked? Fulfilled? Confused? Tony groaned. Arousal was somewhat easier to deal with since it was just a carnal desire, but
"F-Fine! I'm fine." Tony eased him with a placating gesture, causing relief to flood the blonde's expression and an amused smile to stretch his lips.
Steve's beard looked even softer from up close, and the need to run his fingers through that beautiful brownish-golden mane was almost too overwhelming for Tony to handle. The man was some inches taller than he was, but was still tall enough to force Tony to look up in order to be able to remain hostage of Steve's mesmerizing gaze. He seemed to be assessing Tony, trying to understand him and his motivations perhaps, and Tony was one step from closing the distance between them and making his intentions
“Because it was!” Obadiah slammed a fist against the table, causing all of the objects on top of it to either jump or tremble, “She was onto me, that damn bitch, so she was certain to provide Howard and Tony their own loyal hound for protection! And this is why I had to act fast, lest I wanted my plans to be foiled before they could even begin.” He shook his head, trying to calm down his hammering heart.
“No, you don’t.” Steve smugly said while inserting a second finger and causing Tony to cry out in pleasure as Steve stretched his entrance with an infuriating amount of carefulness, “at least, I’ll give you reasons not to.”
Every single thought raging through Tony’s mind came to a screeching halt once Steve collided against him, and suddenly, his knees became jelly, which means he would have gone down if Steve hadn’t enlaced his waist with one of his arms and kept him in place. Tony was not one to appreciate being manhandled, but the gentleness in each of Steve’s touches successfully erased any discomfort from Tony’s entire being as he opened his mouth and gave Steve full access to plunder as he wanted - which he did with so much gusto that Tony actually heard himself whimper as his insides coiled with both excitement and want.
In other words… it was the first time in his life Tony didn’t feel less than the person he was in love with, and that realization was the most overwhelming thing his gifted brain could ever have understood.
was in low spirits, but Rogers? He never stopped to grieve like everyone else. He seemed hell bent on finding you, or at least trying to figure out if you were gone or not. I lost count of how many times he begged me to search for you, and when I returned empty handed, insisted I returned back there to try a little more, to go a little farther. I told him
When Steve had to run with part with the Avengers because Ross was not going to let Bucky Barnes’ existence and Steve’s involvement go unpunished before Tony succeeded on working on the amendments for the accords, he left a phone with Tony so he could reach Steve whenever he needed, and Steve would be there. Because whatever it was they needed to face, they would face it
Tony felt a wave of warmth engulf him as he lowered his head and smiled faintly, cheeks tinged red at the thought Steve had been so adamant about finding him while he drifted in space, “Sounds like Steve…”
"Since the first day you showed how to make one of your mother's Italian recipes," Steve calmly answered, causing Tony's eyes to widen considerably, which seemed to amuse him, "What? I'm a fast learner, and I do like to learn about you, so I might have been training a few recipes in hopes of surprising you with a special dinner and then confessing, Nat has been helping me with that too, but well," he shrugged, smiling, "I guess I jumped the wagon a little bit."
Morgan sighed, looking across the playground towards where her daddy and Mr. Steve were seated on a bench. They seemed serious, uncomfortable and silent, so she was growing worried if their plan really would work, so when Mary asked why exactly Morgan had suggested this idea of them pairing up their daddies, she decided to confide on her new friend.
Tony gazed upon Steve, bright blue eyes soft and searching and at pure ease, confident, and he couldn’t help but to smile. “Our kids will be lucky to have you as a father.”
Regardless, the pain is needed, so despite all odds, do enjoy the fruits of my labor. This was such a difficult chapter to write, I've been at it for the past two weeks, jesus.
Upon his arrival the children seated before his table turned their heads towards him, and so did a woman standing by one of them who seemed ready to pounce at him at any moment. Tony's frown deepened before the woman's clear show of disrespect, but decided to brush it off since a certain pair of brown eyes were glued on him oozing both tension and fear.
Tony had been skeptical, of course. He still thought himself to be too much of a loose cannon to actually be able to look after children or even be a good reference to them. It was outright terrifying, and now he would need to care for countless children of strangers? Excuse him for freaking out a little bit.
Tiberius only nodded brusquely, turning around and hurrying out of the office. Obadiah’s smirk immediately disappeared, and his expression grew both anxious and annoyed as he looked down at the letter sitting on the table - the one he had been reading when Tiberius invited himself in. In it, a brief message written in messy handwriting read an ominous warning.
Tony was about to ask what he meant with that, when Steve suddenly turned him to face down on the bed and stretched his buttcheeks, causing Tony to gasp out a curse as Steve proceeded to rub himself against his entrance in a tortuous pace.
Tony stared at Steve in a complete loss of words. Some days he had wondered if Steve truly was the perfect man everyone idolized and he absolutely
King Steven continued to stare at him, and Tony found himself blushing at the intensity of the stare. He hadn’t noticed during his fight with his father, but the king had been staring at him like… like
, Steve is a handful when he’s away from Tony. You had to see how he was during those two years of their separation — absolutely
That had been the last blow, and before Tony knew, he had completely crumbled inside Steve’s arms, needing to be carried to the medicinal aisle of the compound so his debilitated condition could be taken care of.
be able to come anywhere near Tony, which is exactly my point. He probably thinks Tony has died along with Howard and Maria, and we must keep it that way, because it’s already bad enough he is coming for our heads to avenge the Starks, and I have absolutely no doubt he would do
"I'm saying I do not want the likes of you or your offspring anywhere near my property, so feel free to find yourselves a new school, since mine clearly doesn't live up to the expectations when your son is so inclined to be as disrespectful and laid-back as he is."
“What you said about me being ‘earth’s greatest defender’,” Tony choked out, watching as Steve’s eyes widened in apparent realization, “Did you really think that high of me, even after everything that had happened between us?”
That only proved that Steve, even after all these years of pain and solitude he had brought Tony, still held an overwhelming amount of power over his heart and soul, and Tony wasn’t sure if that was a good thing. Because yeah, there was the possibility that Steve was the only one that could properly heal what was left of his broken soul, but that also means that... if Steve broke his heart a second time, it would be broken beyond repair, and Tony wasn’t sure if he was willing to take that leap of faith.
The answer Steve gave him, however, threw him for a loop, "Not really... I mean, Peter is very smart and I'm sure he surprises everyone around him, but Mary is..." He hesitated. "Special."
Steve’s hold on his waist tightened so much that Tony had no doubt the digits would leave marks, but he couldn’t bring himself to care, not when Steve pulled him down on his own accord and the hard clash of their bodies actually caused Tony to gasp as an unrelenting wave of desire crashed against him and left him breathless. Steve was fully hard beneath him, and Tony could feel
But then, the kingdom was attacked, and Tony still wasn’t sure if that had been a blessing or a curse.
Tony released a breath he didn’t realize he was holding, and then felt some relief wash over him. So they
Which clearly meant that his current predicament was a special case, since Natasha was not one to pass these issues for him to deal with. She could be rather ruthless when she wanted to be — hence why the kids remained in their best behavior in order to never incite her icy wrath, and the parents did their best to stay out of her way —, so the fact she had shoved this situation into his hands without as much as a quick explanation showed that Mrs. Thompson hadn't gotten on his nerves only.
"Daddy!" Peter jumped out of his seat and crossed the room in an instant, tackling his father in a tight hug and hiding his face on the man's midsection. The guy didn't even move once his son collided against him, only lacing an arm around Peter's shoulders while he continued to glare daggers at Mrs. Thompson. "You're here!"
Mary’s mouth clamped shut and both girls turned their heads in alarm towards Mrs. Romanoff’s voice, only to find the woman standing by the door with her arms crossed tightly against her chest and a stern expression on her face. Behind her stood Mrs. Maximoff with a concerned look, and before either Mary or Morgan could answer, Duncan pointed at them and accused mid wails, “Morgan was being mean and then Mary pushed me!”
“H-hush, master Anthony,” Jarvis ordered in a whisper, voice shaky, “stay quiet, and whatever you do, do not attract that man’s attention to yourself, ok?
A breathtaking smile appeared on Steve’s beautiful lips, “I’d never fail you like that,” he reached for Tony’s face once more, gently caressing his cheek with his thumb and causing Tony to close his eyes in ecstasy as another tear fell, “not again.”
“Sorry,” Steve chuckled sheepishly, and Tony found himself loving the sound of it. “Guess we are more similar than I thought.”
The sound of something snapping and the unmistakable noise of Tony’s armour assembling around him sounded through the phone, “
But Mary continued, “Can we move along the subjects?” she asked, earning a surprised look from Mrs. Maximoff, “I already know how to sum. Will be boring to learn about that again.”
Realization seemed to struck Tiberius, and his eyes narrowed, “You set Rogers up so he wouldn’t be around during the attack to help?”
“You need to… prepare me. We don’t expand as easily as women do, so we need preparation. I normally use lube, but-”
“Goodness gracious, what’s next, you’ll say I smell really good and start watching me in my sleep like that Cullen guy?”
“Get inside me.” Tony hurriedly ordered, which had Steve tilting his head in an adorable way and smiling teasingly.
“Steve, I swear to every single deity that I don’t give a rat ass about that if you don’t get on with fucking me in this exact second, we are not finish-aAAAH!” He yelled once he felt Steve start to slide into him, causing Tony to punch the bed and moan helplessly. “Son of a BITCH!”
brotherhood?” Carol released a pained sigh while resting back against the bed’s headboard, “Captain Hard-head is so into you that makes me want to barf rainbows and hit both your heads together until they become one.”
Steve smiled knowingly, leaning forward and capturing his lips once more, this time, on a quick but tender kiss, "I don't see why not, but no take-outs, let's cook together instead."
He could make himself a fortune if he 'used' his children's intellect, but Steve was clearly the kind of man that would rather starve other than to force his children to do anything of the like. So, yeah... Maybe Tony was being an asshole for doing this hoping something more carnal in exchange, but that was not the only reason why he was doing it.
“You talk like you have any choice on the matter, Anthony.” His father mused, an eyebrow raised. Tony saw red.
Tony wondered, opening his eyes and contemplating the situation for a moment, before he mustered the courage to ask, “The thing you need to tell me… that you wanted to say before we did this,” he felt Steve’s body go rigid under his touch, which had him momentarily biting his lip, “how bad is it?”
Suddenly, the blade of a double edged ax was pressed against Howard’s throat, the cold sharpened metal that was causing a superficial cut on his neck being more than enough to shut his mouth. Tony watched in awe as the petite redhead pressed the ax against his father’s throat, her expression steely as she hissed in a language unknown to Tony, “
“S-stop thanking me, you doofus.” Tony fondly scolded, having Steve to take a hold of his hands and spread kisses down his spine, “Fuck. You are too m-much, did you know that?”
Happy stared at both for a moment, until realization seemed to dawn on him, “Oh, yes!” and he proceeded to search his pockets, until he pulled out a single wedding ring while beaming a smile from ear to ear, “I’ve been carrying this since 2012!”
Tony continued to stare at him, completely at a loss of words. How was that man even real? “Yes.” He granted breathlessly, earning one of the most beautiful smiles to ever grace that fucking planet. “Yes, you can.”
“I- uh…” Tony stuttered, having a hard time to gather his bearings before Steve’s overwhelming gentleness as he kissed down his neck.
"That sounds great," Steve agreed, suddenly hauling Tony onto his arms on a bridal carry and causing the engineer to yelp, "off we go then."
“I noticed it. You were able to lift the hammer, weren’t you?” Tony asked, earning a hesitant look from Steve, “Back at the party, when everyone was giving a shot. It moved a bit when it was your turn.”
“Tony? Where’s the kid?” Steve asked as the door swung close behind him, drowning the deafening noises of screaming reporters and camera shutters and flashes.
of reporters outside waiting to record whatever it was the big announcement Tony Stark would bring forth that day, and now that Peter had sauntered off happily into the sunset like the righteous good boy that learned a valuable lesson he was, Tony was left with nothing to show.
He hated Howard, oh how he did, and he could only wish that the man and his god damned advisers got what they deserved when it was their time. Maybe Rhodey would take upon him to avenge Tony and the rest of them? He could only hope. Rhodey did always say he would move mountains and tame seas in order to protect Tony, and it felt like the kind of thing he would do once he found out Howard sold him out to save his own neck.
"It's fine, he's a good kid and his heart was in the right place, so I rather don't be too hard on him. And besides," he gestured for Mr. Rogers to sit down, which he promptly did, "It's not like caring for animals is anywhere near easy."
It was then that realization hit Tony like a rocket, and he almost slammed his palm against his face for not having noticed this earlier.
"I'm filthy rich, honey. I don't need to do anything I don't want to, and I want to help you and your children." He smiled in a way that he hoped it looked charming, "so please, Steve,
“I’m not telling you to be calm about anything, dammit! I’m only telling you to back the fuck down for a moment and let me plan this out, because if you honestly think that going head on against a fucking
Peter seemed uncertain for a moment, looking up towards his father who had coaxed him back to the chair and now stood behind him. Golden Adonis placed a supportive hand on his son's shoulder and nodded in reassurance, so the boy finally looked back at Tony and inhaled nervously before speaking, "Ned and I were having lunch at the cafeteria, minding our own business, when Flash and his little crew arrived and started to bother us!"
“No, listen to me,” he stepped closer, shortening the space in between them, “I mean it. I’m still a man of the past, who is good at some planning and barging into enemy territory, but
“If Tony doesn’t willingly accept you, good luck with forcing yourself on him,” Obadiah nonchalantly said, turning his uninterested gaze towards the papers he had been reading, “that boy is currently the most powerful being on the realm, so I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”
His tone may have sounded a bit too flirty, but it seemed to go unnoticed by Steve as he gaped at the principal once again. "Your way of requesting me to pay our debt... is by giving me a job?
Mary poked and then winked at her, subtly gesturing with her head to them. Morgan smiled brightly and nodded. This could work. It could really, really work!
They continued laughing and teasing at each other for some time, and eventually, their laughter died out and their eyes locked on each other, causing Tony to smile dumbly at Steve and be unable to look away from his velvet soft expression.
Flash visibly gulped but still didn't respond, looking up to his mom in a clear request for help, but her attention wasn't on him. Tony quirked up a brow at the distracted woman, who was ogling Peter's dad just as bad as Tony had been. Worst, even.
— not seeing him as someone worth of respect sent his mind into a spiral of despair that he just couldn't quite handle.
He never did, because he knew that as soon as he got to hear Steve’s voice, all his resolve and anger would dissolve and he would immediately crumble — probably caving in to the desire of forgiving Steve. He couldn’t allow it, not that soon. He needed time to allow things to heal, and he couldn’t trust Steve that easily anymore, not after learning what the man had kept from him out of fear he would attack Barnes.
"Pete says he did, and I've taught my son the value of truth above anything else," he crossed his arms against that absurd chest and cocked an eyebrow at the woman. "Have
Well, the sight of Steve covered in motor oil and sweat sure sounded more than acceptable, but the rest didn't.
with you two morons being slower than a turtle and a snail during a race, so tell me, what do you plan to do?”
"Saying I got small hands that are good enough to help with tinkering? What kind of compliment is that?!" Tony's nostrils flared, earning himself an eyeroll from Bruce as he turned his attention back to the hologram they were studying. Tony's eyes narrowed, "Bruce!"
The captain shook his head fondly. His children truly were too much like their dad, "Tell them to clean up as well. Tony and I will bathe Mary again after dinner."
every single second of it. It was incredibly fun to be taught about all kind of things by her incredibly smart daddy, since he always made little jokes and found interesting ways of introducing each subject to her, while in school everything was just… terribly boring. Mrs. Maximoff was great, and Morgan had no complaints about the sweet kindergaten teacher, but she just couldn’t see the appeal of the woman’s teaching methods. It was unfair though, after all,
Mr. Rogers chuckled knowingly, "I'm well aware. I volunteer on a place that rescues street animals on the weekends, and I usually take him and my youngest."
"No," Peter growled, and Tony could see him balling his small hand into a fist, "but you will. " Then he landed a punch square on Flash's nose, which caused him to land on his ass and proceed to shriek in pain.
Steve reached for Tony’s face, and he placed a hand on top of Steve’s, caressing it slightly while taking in the person lying beside him and who looked at him with nothing short of raw adoration and fear, instead of disappointment and betrayal. A man whom he fought with non-stop, but still found strength within himself to see through Tony’s masks. Tony was Steve’s absolute opposite, but it was absolutely undeniable that they fit perfectly together. Be as team leaders, or as people.
“Back off Bucky, do you really think I give a fucking damn about my feelings right now?!” He turned around to face off with his second in command, while gesturing wildly, “Howard and Maria are gone,
Carol groaned, “For crying out loud— Stark, he addressed you as his ‘everything else’, grew a damn hobo beard—”
Of course Nat would see right through him. Carol and her made one hell of a duo when it came to seeing right through Tony’s bullshit. It was impressive.
The morning had been calm. He mostly solved a few issues regarding his company and attended to an early meeting per Pepper's (very passive-aggressive) request, which had been absurdly boring and uneventful, but as soon as he set foot in the premises of the school half hour past noon, his assistant was quick to reach him with a rather annoyed expression set in her usually stony face.
"Pete..." His father released a deep sigh and— oh. Oh my God. The man was blushing. "I'm having a serious conversation with your uncle about the kind of bedtime stories he tells you."
Obadiah scoffed at that, “None of that, you fool. I couldn’t care less about what happens with the boy, I’m only warning your arrogant ass of the consequences. Tony is stubborn as a goddamned mule, so if you want him to cooperate with your demands without him going berserk and killing us all, you’ll need a little incentive.”
“What? Don’t tell me you thought those were fabricated tales as well?” Obadiah humorlessly chuckled, causing Tiberius to dry swallow, “Well, those things are not called ‘Dire Wolves’ for nothing, and they also have other less than friendly animals tagging along, so I’d get on with it if I were you. We need to leave as soon as possible.”
He exhaled a shaky breath, immediately making his mind and getting to his feet, “F.R.I.D.A.Y., is Danvers awake?”
“Oh, so now I’m father?” Howard shook his head in disbelief, “My word is law, and you will abide to it, Anthony, whether you like it or not. Tiberius is like a son to me, and the son of my greatest confidant, not to mention a phenomenal warrior. He will do great to my court once I am no longer able to rule, so you will marry him and that’s final.”
And before Tony could even try to formulate an answer for that, Steve had closed the distance between them as he surged forward to capture Tony’s lips with his own.
“Actually, we are tired of the playground... but I don’t want to go home yet, it’s the first time I ever made a friend.” Mary declared, taking a hold of Morgan’s hand and looking at her, “Right, Morgan?”
That was until Howard announced that he was to be betrothed to Obadiah’s devil spawn, and Tony’s already frail self-control completely shattered.
Tony sighed in relief while Steve’s eyes became wide as saucers as he stared at the ring, then at Tony, then back at the ring and back at Tony again, “What…?”
while tearing that log in half back in 2015, he would have done way more than just stare and lick his lips.
Steve stared away for a solid second before giving out a resigned sigh, “Of course I did. I still do, in fact. After all, who figured out how to navigate through time travel in only one night and basically saved the universe?” He asked softly, a charming smile sprouting on his lips and causing Tony’s heart to acquire an even faster pace as the man stepped forward and towards him, “You are amazing, Tony, so yeah… I have no doubt you are the best of us.”
Tony regarded him for a moment, thinking about how that night had started and how much guilt and despair had been eating at him while he paced inside that barn by himself before Steve arrived. He thought about the nightmare that had been shown to him, how he watched the lifeless bodies of his entire team lay unmoving before his very eyes, and how the very man now staring at him had nothing but words of disappointment for him on his deathbed. How he said Tony could have done more, how Steve had been the one to say that, and nobody else.
If Tony’s smile could widen more, it would have. Of course Mr. Perfect volunteered to care for rescues. "Ah, so he will already be somewhat familiar with some of the care. Good, but we have everything from chinchillas to horses, so I wouldn't worry about him getting bored."
"Because my daddy is a retired superhero who fought bullies in other countries when I was a baby, and he never apologized for standing up for others!"
"They seem perfectly made just for mine." He huskly answered, causing Tony's heart to speed up inside his chest and almost push out the arc reactor in the process.
“Very well, your highness,” the leader spoke, catching Tony by surprise by his much less accented English. “Since you so politely asked, I’ll answer. I am Steven Rogersson, and I’d say I come with no desire to cause any harm, but alas, you wouldn’t be able to say the same.”
The group was clearly on a level above the men and women who had been holding them hostage. Their armors were of clear silver aside the steel, and each had a different intimidating level to them. The first ones were a man with short blond hair that carried an interesting bow seemingly made of bones and adorned with countless runes, and much for Tony’s amazement, a
“For the love of the great lord, do you lack a fucking brain?!” Obadiah snapped rather loudly, stunning the other man into silence, “I
"Ah, that's very kind of you Mr. Stark, but as you might be aware, I can't afford your school. Peter is only here because of your scholarship program, which I must say I'm really grateful for." Tony once again felt his insides melt due being the target of such a groundbreaking smile. He never reacted this much to a guy in his entire life, and it was being overwhelming even if he was no stranger to the whole prospect of same sex attraction. "Your school truly is one of a kind, and I've never seen Pete so happy to wake up early to learn, and he always has a lot to tell me when he gets home."
“The boats?” Jarvis whispered to himself, not seeming to have heard Tony’s question, “Why bring them to the boats?”
— round, Tony called quits once his body pretty much stopped responding and he felt blissfully sore all over. Steve in other hand, aside panting heavily, seemed completely fine and ready for more, and the lazy, satisfied smile that stretched his adorably rosy lips made Tony wish he had energy for a seventh last round.
“You shut your mouth right now, boy! Don’t you dare shame me even more!” Howard finally exploded, but Tony didn’t flinch away this time. Not this time.
"Can you stop overthinking everything?" Bruce grumbled, turning his annoyed gaze to a pouting Tony, "I didn't mean anything by it, it's not that deep."
"Maybe I don't have to, but I definitely want to woo and spoil my special fella before making love to him," Steve argued, trailing kisses down Tony's neck and causing him to shudder and bite his lip.
By the time Steve asked, they had already returned to the small room Tony was staying in. He pulled Steve inside, locking the door behind him, and turning to face the human equivalent of a golden retriever staring at him in adorable confusion.
The captain surely didn’t help, since after things went back to normal Steve became one of the most wonderful companies Tony could have around. His stubbornness had toned down quite a lot, seeing he was more flexible and inclined to hear Tony out when the engineer disagreed about something during a mission or on the casual days. He also was extremely soft and caring, always bringing him meals when he forgot to eat — “
“Why not- Tony!” He sounded exasperated in a way that was almost cute, “You are talking about- this is not-”
He forced his legs to move until he was back behind his table and seated on his comfortable chair. His mind was racing, and he couldn't quite organize his thoughts as he poured yet another glass of whiskey for himself. He leaned against the leather backrest and brought the glass to his lips, having a sip while a thoughtful look came across his features.
“Definitely,” Tony agreed as he finally managed to open the pesky piece of fabric to run a hand over Steve’s sculpted abs and torso. He backed away slightly, and Tony couldn’t help but smile softly as their gazes met, “You always pack the best surprises, Cap.”
Tony felt the telltale of a headache start to nag at his head as he pinched the bridge of his nose. Great. Another parent to have a scream match. "Sure. Let him in."
The next two were a dark skinned man who had an actual falcon perched on his shoulder, and Tony tried his best to keep from shivering at the sight of the bird of prey assessing the occupants of the room as if it were looking for something to sink its sharp claws in. By his side was a man whose scowl rivaled Rhodey’s when the Chief of Guard was in one of his bad moods, and differently from the clean shaven head from his dark skinned friend, he had a head full of brown hair also styled in countless braids—much like the redhead’s—and carried a concerning amount of weapons, which Tony did his best to ignore for the sake of his sanity. They were all very good looking, and it was hard to look away from them, since their presence was so overwhelming that it felt like they owned the room as soon as they entered it.
Steve heard Bucky curse under his breath, but he couldn’t focus on anything else. Without hesitation, he turned to his pack - soldiers and wolves - and yelled, “Everyone, gather your things and break down camp. We are leaving immediately!”
"Okay! Thank you, Mr. Stark!" Peter hopped off his chair and quickly rounded it to give his father another hug. "See you later, daddy! Sorry again for causing trouble."
Silence once more impregnated the room, and Tony could do nothing but remain frozen in place, shivering and feeling tears roll unchecked down his cheeks. He knew Howard hated him, God, he knew, but this… this was… he choked up in tears, outright sobbing by the feet of the Vikings who watched in silence. They might as well kill him right then, he just didn’t care anymore.
“I cannot believe this,” Tony sniffled, backing away slightly and gazing up at Steve’s tear stained cheeks, which actually helped him not feel ashamed of his own. “You are such a huge fucking idiot.
“Never been much of a cuddler, but,” Tony yawned, shuffling closer and burying his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, “you are ridiculously warm, so I’ll allow this once.”
Tony had sputtered and sent a scandalized look towards the assassin, who just chuckled and fondly patted his cheek before waltzing out of the room after the others. Tony had wordlessly stared at her retreating back, until he chuckled to himself and shook his head.
His retort was interrupted by a knock on the door, which caused Tony to snap his mouth shut and exchange heated glares with Mrs. Thompson. "Yes?"
“YOU CAN’T DO THIS!” He heard himself scream through the panic, “IF YOU DO IT, YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN HIM.”
Of course it almost got them all killed, but thanks to Carol Danvers, that hadn’t happened a second time. Tony had decided to wield the power of the stones and do to Thanos the same he had done to them, but before he could even get to Thanos or the stones, Carol had pounced at him again. With much struggle, she managed to rip the stones off the makeshift glove Tony had made, and the next thing he knew, Thanos and his gigantic army were dust flying in the wind.
? He turned his attention back to Peter’s father, whose attention was entirely focused on the screen.
However, to his surprise, Steve explained anyway. "War left me with a few psychological issues to deal with, and I need to be with Mary as much as I can, she—" he paused, briefly biting his lip, but mustering courage to continue, "She is the other reason why I'm so reluctant to accept your offer. She is not like the other children her age, so it can be a bit difficult."
“I wish that was the case, but I have seen with my own eyes what that man is capable of.” Obadiah took another swing of his drink, his eyes seeming haunted as he proceeded, “His group may be large and vicious, but he makes it clear that they are mostly by his side out of option instead of actual support. Once I actually witnessed him going against an entire army of bandits that attempted to ambush us during a trip that Howard had him tagging along for protection. I had questioned him how only one man would be enough help in case we needed, but Howard assured me I would understand in case something actually happened,” Obadiah watched Tiberius’ eyes widening, “and understand, I did, since Rogers actually faced over thirty heavily armed men and came out as the winner, with nothing but a scratch on his cheek and somewhat rumpled clothes.”
of polishing before that could happen. The kid had the brains, the brawn, and the heroics to become a pretty great addition to their team, but Peter was still, well,
Morgan nodded, silently accepting the stuffed bear back and hugging it tight against her chest. It had been one of her daddy’s birthday gifts, and the one she loved the most and that always chased away bad dreams when daddy couldn’t be there. Mr. Fuzzy was probably her best friend, and she couldn’t explain how relieved she was that he was safe back into her arms.
Flash scoffed at that, "You know very well who owns the school, Parker. My parents are like this," he rubbed his two index fingers together, "with Principal Stark, so you should know better than to back talk me!"
“55,” came the easy answer, causing both of the teacher’s brows to shoot upwards now. Morgan stared wide eyed at Mary, who hadn’t changed from her bored look.
“You are! You act all smartpants and stuff, like you know better than us, but I bet you do it just for attention. My daddy says it’s because you inherited your daddy’s arrogance, so you are a prick just like him!”
the leader’s estimate and most trusted warriors, and to think a woman have made place among them just completely threw Tony for a loop. He was used to seeing women being delicate things, meant to be seen and not heard, not warriors who bathe in blood and are strong enough to server heads from enemies, and way less being able to stand on equal ground with other men at a higher spot on whatever hierarchy the Vikings possessed.
Tony glared at him, but was caught off-guard upon finding the man smiling teasingly at him other than seeming as serious and stone-faced as he used to be.
Maria was overly protective of that boy, so don’t you find strange that she willingly accepted a foreign man of unknown power into Howard’s life and suddenly started to tell him about her treasured son?”
"And I already told you there is nothing to figure out! My son is innocent, and that little bastard is a violent delinquent that should not be allowed near other children!"
Tony blinked dazedly at Steve’s sultry tone, suddenly feeling helpless under the intense gaze. Between their arguments and fights, Tony never stopped to
She just didn’t understand why her aunty Pep was so demanding about her going to school. Daddy was heavily against it, and they had fought over and over again over the decision. She always spoke about how important it was for Morgan to be around other kids her age, but Morgan didn’t quite understand why that was so important, since it has been a bit of time already and the young girl had yet to make any friends.
He looked up in order to ask Jarvis, but his words died at the tip of his tongue once he saw the horrified expression in the servant’s pale face. His eyes were wide and focused on King Steven, and now that Tony had stopped to notice, Jarvis arms were shivering around him. “J…?” He hesitantly asked, but Jarvis didn’t even blink. He looked like he was seeing a ghost. “J, what is it?”
"She, uh— I didn't really find a good school for her yet, so she's being home-schooled for the time being."
He felt a spasm, and he took that as his body vehemently protesting against the idea. Tony huffed. What wouldn’t he give to be 20 years younger.
King Steven then looked ahead towards Howard, and the gentleness in his expression morphed into one of contempt, “I do accept your gift, and the debt will be paid, so worry not. I’m sure you’ll get what you deserve once you reach the realm of the dead.”
” Steve released yet another pained chuckle and dropped down on the nearest chair, burying his face in his hands and practically choking out the next words, “
truth, Rogers? Hm? That sounds okay with you?” Tony snarled, his patience wearing thin as he was finding more and more difficult to keep his voice low, given they were in a public space.
With that taken care of, Steve focused back on dinner. Tony would undoubtedly arrive starved, and the thought made Steve chuckle to himself as he imagined the absolute havoc his husband was currently wreaking in whichever enemy base had successfully 'captured' him back in Berlin.
Tony massaged his rear and glared at Natasha’s retreating form as she walked away with a giggling Wanda.
“Stark,” there was that resigned sigh that often seemed to accompany his name, and Tony tried to keep himself from feeling hurt once he realized Rogers
"C'mon Pete, it's not worth it..." Ned tried to intervene, only to have Flash pushing him off his seat with unnecessary brutality.
“It was literally my pleasure,” Tony heard himself saying, having Steve to back down to look back at him, “You lasted a lot too, which is quite impressive for your first time.”
Tony eyed him in confusion as the king swiftly removed his pelt cloak from his shoulders and draped it around Tony’s nude body instead. He gasped in surprise as the soft fur caressed his skin and hid his modesties from prying eyes, revelling in the warmth and dizzy with the delicious smell that wafted from it—King Steven’s smell—which was heady and intoxicating,
“Yeah,” he chuckled humorlessly, “there’s always something eating at me, but it takes one to know one, and I know there’s something else other than your good intentions that made you do this.” Rogers smartly pointed out, once again catching Tony off-guard, “The enhanced girl made you see something as well, didn’t she? Like the rest of us?”
“Am I now?” Tony purred, slowly moving on Steve’s lap and earning a surprised gasp from him, “Careful, soldier. If you continue to sweet talk me like that, I just might fall for you.”
“Nonsense, every man has a price. What is it then? Riches? I have silver, and gold as well! You are free to take from the castle chambers, consider another gift for finally ridding me of this ungrateful brat I happened to sire.” Howard sneered, and tony heard Jarvis grunt in outrage and probably turn to glare at the man. Tony didn’t bother to do it. He refused to even look at Howard’s face.
If he remembered well, this would not be the first time he hears of the Thompson's kid breaking that specific rule. Being aware of these situations in specific was one of the few demands he made to Natasha, and she had already reported to him once about the Flash Thompson case. He was surprised, though. Natasha was usually intimidating enough to keep the young ones from repeating the mistake. He lost the count of how many bully-to-be's were successfully turned into little angels after only one encounter with the redhead’s icy glare, but apparently, Flash was an exception.
The woman startled back to reality, "What?" She blinked at Tony, and then her confused expression morphed into one of anger, "What do you mean 'potential misbehavior'? I already said my son is innocent! "
No, the one currently in front of him was Steve Rogers. Not a larger than life legend, but yes an overly strong man who sometimes broke the microwave while trying to understand how it worked and who loved to just spend time with Tony at the workshop, sketching away in one of his countless art notebooks while lying down on the couch Tony had procured for him once he made a habit of it. A man who loved dogs and was weak for pizza, just as Tony was weak for a good cup of coffee. A man who had the strength to break bones, but still gently swayed his fingers against Tony's, almost playfully.
Steve momentarily inspected what Tony had been gesturing at, only to openly laugh the most beautiful laughter that ever graced the principal's ears. "I suppose it sounds ridiculous now, but I wasn't like this when I was younger. I was far more... thin."
“Get. Inside. Me. Right. Now.” Tony growled, pulling him down by grabbing at his dog tags and taking claim of the infuriating man’s mouth. Steve chuckled against his lips, clearly amused by his despair, the bastard.
His attention was dragged back to the screen when the recording began to play, and Tony immediately recognized Bruce as the scientist approached Steve; the others having cleared the room for whatever reason.
Mary seemed thoughtful for a moment, which prompted Mrs. Maximoff to open a satisfied smile, “Mary, you shouldn’t-”
Pride welled inside Tony's chest and he preened at the praise. He was used on getting praises for his school's teaching methods, but it felt like a whole new world of pleasure to hear it coming from Mr. Rogers. "I'm glad to hear that. This place and its methods all came from my mother's lovely mind. I only added a few things here and there."
“Incentive?” One of Tiberius’ eyebrows shot upwards, “Which incentive could possibly work against him? We literally killed his entire family!”
A loud slap echoed through the eerily silent room, and Tony eyed his father’s wrathful expression as his left cheek stung from the slap. “Shut your mouth, you foolish boy! What do you know of how the world works?! Be quiet, before I personally ask these barbarians to rid you of your tongue.”
Obadiah set down his glass, now empty, and pinched the bridge of his nose, “That would work wonderfully if Tony actually had full control over the stone, Tiberius, which he
They stared in disbelief at him for a second, but the redhead soon was pushing them away to do whatever they had been told to do. Tony watched wordlessly as they marched towards the castle servants and ushered them out of the throne room. They whimpered and hugged each other, some feebly resisted, crying out for Tony and begging for mercy, certain that those would be their final moments, that they were being carried to their deaths, and Tony could only continue to cry because… because he didn’t know either.
called Tony cute for whatever reason, the man could do nothing but melt. A little secret agent who learned a bit too much from her aunt 'Tasha', much for Tony's chagrin and Steve's neverending amusement.
Tony had told them to only disassemble their ‘characters’ once they arrived home, using the excuse that they should leave the country as soon as possible to avoid any attention from the European authorities, because even if the new accords had been revoked in an act of faith before their efforts and sacrifices to save the universe against Thanos, it was better not to push their luck.
Peter's expression clouded over in the video, while Ned only lowered his head. "Go away, Flash. I already told you I'm not going to join your little group, and leave Ned alone!"
Tony was everything but graceful as he took a too big of a swing of his whiskey and ended up choking himself.
Steve chuckled, watery and rough, but just as beautiful, “I have to confess, I expected less insults whenever I confessed.”
Hell, he was finding a barbarian more pleasant than his own father, so he supposed that spoke for itself.
After the greetings, Mrs. Maximoff told Mary to go along and pick a seat for herself after she hung her backpack - which had Morgan interally gasping, since it was a
With his head a whirlwind of confused thoughts, and his heart thundering wildly inside his chest, Tony could only stare at the star in the center of the king’s gleaming shield and wonder:
Carol stayed at the compound with the others, where Tony could offer her the best medicine care one could provide, and albeit grumpy about being grounded and forced to be out of commission by Fury until she was properly healed, she enjoyed the accommodations and the company, so she never really complained.
“Alright! Thank you again, Mr. Stark!” Peter happily said before turning around and practically hopping away from whence he came.
Sure, his family was everything but conventional and his white picket-fence house turned out to be a luxurious penthouse on top of one of the most expensive buildings in New York, but he had already come in terms with that "little" details by now. Tony sure didn’t rest until he did, which was adorable, even though the engineer absolutely hated when Steve used said adjective to describe him. Mary was his little partner in crime on the matter, since when
“Wait a second,” Howard suddenly said, causing Tony to glare daggers at him, “so you are saying all we need is to pay a sacrifice for this to be sorted out?”
Sam had raised a brow once he finished his reasoning, and Bucky shot him a shit eating grin as he pointed out, “
“Tony?” He heard Steve ask, his soft expression morphing into one of concern as he stepped closer, “Are you alright?”
Tony kept looking through the window of the compound while restlessly bouncing his leg in place, continuously checking his wristwatch to consult the time. They should arrive at any minute, but every minute of wait felt tortuous as the seconds ticked.
"Of course I am champ, and I'm sorry I'm late." He finally looked away from the woman to focus on Peter — who was now staring up at him — and the way his furious expression morphed into one of unrelenting tranquility as he offered his son a breathtaking smile, which caused a sudden wave of something warmth and unexpected to crash against Tony and leave him momentarily breathless. "I needed to wait for your uncle to arrive so I could come."
“Oh, isn’t he now?” Steve had grinned, enlacing Tony’s waist and pulling him close, “And what is that brand new suit I saw being build in your workshop? Far as I know, we don’t have any spider-lings in the Avengers yet, Tony.”
The elevator's doors opened, and Tony immediately sauntered off of it and headed straight towards the big living room where he knew his team currently was.
Peter had been so happy about the prospect of being in contact with the animals that he didn't even flinch before the added punishment. "Okay! No problem!"
Steve raised his head to meet Bucky’s frown across the table where the map they were currently studying sat, and felt a frown of his own crease his forehead, “Why wouldn’t I be?”
“That’s what you barbarians are always after, is it not? Conquest? Well, I have the biggest conquest you’ll ever find right here! Don’t think I missed how you were looking at him earlier, Viking lord,” Howard sneered, grabbing Tony’s face and making him whimper, “Such a pretty face, do you know how many offers I got for the hand of this boy? Countless. Countless, I say!”
“Maybe,” Steve agreed, moving a hand from Tony’s hip down towards his length, grabbing it and massaging the tip calmly with his thumb. Tony moaned loudly and landed another punch on the mattress, while Steve released a shuddering exhale. “You sound and feel so good, you have no idea.”
Tony considered his options for a minute, until he came across a good idea that would not only help Steve in a lot of ways, but also help himself, "If you insist, I have something you could do for me."
“Pshh, you’ll have a hard time then, buddy. I’m a talker.” Tony simply said, grabbing at Steve’s cock and causing the man to shiver and whimper, “It’s so damn pink, like, literally the prettiest one I’ve ever seen. Are you sure you were not sculpted by Greek Gods? Because this is ridiculous.”
“Tell you what,” Tony, feeling bold and that his legs were back on a working order, stepped away from Steve’s embrace and laced their fingers, pulling him along as he walked towards the stairs, “since both of us could use a distraction and you are way tenser than even myself, I have a proposition.”
Which was exactly why Tony had decided to, in fact, give Peter another chance - that chance being a free pass to the Avengers and a brand new and fairly indestructible suit to pair with it. When he had announced his idea, most Avengers had protested (Wilson and Barnes mainly, since apparently the kid had annoyed them greatly) but Steve only laughed and supported the ludicrous idea, which was all Tony needed, so he prepared everything and had Pepper setting up the press just outside the compound where he would walk out with Peter and announce to the world that Spider-Man had officially joined their ranks and would officially be under Captain America and Iron Man’s wings.
Inside the Iron Man suit he felt safer, taller, powerful... Now outside of it? There was just so much his charisma and masked smiles could keep away. He felt vulnerable as he looked, and he fucking hated it, hence why Bruce's attempt of a praise had set him off. The idea of the team — of
Steve smirked, leaning back down to capture his lips in another breathtaking kiss, to then whisper against Tony’s ear, “I’d like to see you try, shellhead.”
Tony felt his entire face heat up. This was useless. Howard would never listen to reason, so this screaming match was fucking useless. He turned back to the watching king, and found the courage to force himself to ask, “Please, there has to be something we can do.”
They held each other’s gazes, and Tony took his time to drink of the sight that was Steve Rogers with flushed cheeks and deliciously sweaty after a long round of intense lovemaking. His long hair had long been released from the bun it had been in, and it was wild hot mess, sticking to his forehead in what Tony decided to be an adorable way. He was gorgeous, so gorgeous and
Obadiah shot another unimpressed look towards his partner, “Being this daft, it doesn’t surprise me your father didn’t want you anywhere near his throne.” Tiberius’ nostrils flared at the insult and he opened his mouth to argue, but Obadiah proceeded, unbothered, “I obviously have leverage against the boy, or you honestly thought he has been listening to me and staying put because he still has a place in his heart for his ‘backstabbing asshole of an uncle’, as he so smartly called me earlier?”
“It’s fine, big guy.” Tony managed to say, even though his throat was awfully sore and his voice came out scratchy, “You were great, tasted great too.” Tony leaned forward and captured Steve lips, causing the man to grunt in surprise but kiss back with enthusiasm. Tony smiled and licked at Steve’s lips, hearing himself pant, “See? Delicious.”
, because of you. Because you steered me through this strange new world I was thrust into, and you helped me understand I could belong somewhere else that wasn’t my past. You gave me a reason to keep going again, and then I lost you, I
That immediately caused Steve to tense up, while Bucky raised a brow at his husband, “This really is not the best time for this, feathers.”
Tony brought a hand to Steve’s stomach, allowing his touch to wander through the rock hard abs that moved with Steve’s erratic breathing and seemed to glisten with a sheen layer of sweat. It was one of the prettiest sights that ever graced his eyes, and he honestly couldn’t get enough of it. “Fuck, you’re so damn pretty it’s a damn crime. I should call the authorities on you.”
Tony released a humorless laugh, shooting Steve an unimpressed look, “Sure. As if you didn’t move on with your life, seeing you have a daughter and for some reason went from a sickly twig to a muscled log. Bet you had the time of your life with the ladies before you settled down, hm?”
But Tony had already opened the door, and the outside noise immediately drowned whatever Steve had been saying. Tony smirked in satisfaction.
Tony looked up back at him, only to meet the forlorn gaze Steve now sported as he became lost in the memories of his past. Tony bit his lower lip, bringing his hands up to Steve’s face and forcing him to focus back on him, “Hey… you still with me?”
“Of all of Howard’s friends, she liked me the less. The woman was polite and helpful as they come, but she always made clear she didn’t trust me much, so she must have had her suspicions regarding my plans, which is why she was all too glad to bring Rogers and his people into her home. Then, one day, she began to speak of Tony to the captain, even though Tony was a forbidden subject to
The name hit a little too close to home, but Tony decided to ignore that for now. "Seven? That's quite young. Where does she study?"
planning and even sewing by hand, always concerned Steve would be protected during missions. Steve had yearned to hear his voice and see him, even after he lost his mind when he figured out about what Barnes had done, even after he had demanded for Steve to leave the shield behind.
losing you too. I can’t lead this team without you, I-” he choked up, not being able to bear the weight of the truth as it slipped out of his lips, “I’m not half as good at anything as I am when I’m doing it next to you…” the arms around him tightened even more, “And that’s the truth.”
’. He remembers how the already broken Steve seemed to shatter even more at his outburst, but Tony didn’t care back then. He was too pained; too mad to see any reason, mainly because he had to hear that Pepper had been dusted away too. God, it had been too much. They hadn’t been together since they broke things off before Steve and Tony had their apocalyptical altercation, but Pepper was still one of Tony’s biggest treasured friends, and to hear she was gone, too? Because he had been an incompetent? Because
Tony paused, gazing at Steve and how he was using his Captain America uniform. Tony lost himself on the sight for a little bit, delighting himself on the thought that that whole man was
“There’s something I need to tell you,” Steve ground out, actually sounding a bit more in control of himself, “before we- I can’t go further with this- with
Flash stiffened on his seat and shuffled nervously, but Tony didn’t bother paying him any mind. Now, Parker-
Steve stared at him with those round blue eyes, which seemed to spark with both uncertainty and excitement, "Not sure if you'd like it."
That being said, enjoy this clusterf*ck of emotions, and have kerchiefs at hand! Just an advice, heh.
times. He wanted to call and yell at him that he was a damn coward, that he would never be forgiven, and that he could take that half-assed apology of his and shove it up where it hurts… but, at the end of the day, Tony never did it.
“I know he wasn’t, and you probably had the best intentions in the world, but doesn’t erase what happened.”
Tony smiled lazily at that response, “Ah, so I’ve successfully corrupted Captain Rogers? I am so deeply sorry, America! What a heathen!”
Man, it's always strangely satisfying to write Steve intimidating the shit out of self-conceited people fmealkaeg also, Tones can be frightening too, mwah.
She had been quite the beauty. Smart, charismatic, a genius that immediately picked Tony’s interest and didn’t take long to win his heart. Pepper, however, never liked her much, which Tony never understood, since Darlene was an absolute delight and was immediately adored by anyone who met her. He had asked Rhodey about it, but he didn’t understand it either. Differently from Pepper, Rhodey did like Darlene, and thought she was great for him.
Carol grinned, “Tony is my friend, and Rogers may be a royal pain in the ass sometimes, but I like him. Besides,” she climbed up to kiss Natasha gently on her lips, “their happiness is your happiness, so there is no way I would just stand by and do nothing seeing how frustrated you were getting at those two butting heads.”
“Sure, and you are just the man who designs everything and makes us look cooler, right?” There was that teasing smile back again, and Tony felt a sudden urge to do
“Your highness, please stop—” Tony heard Jarvis faintly ask from behind them, but Howard continued as if he hadn’t listened.
That actually startled out a laughter from everyone, even Tony, who just slapped his palm against Clint's, "God, I hate you."
It was ironic how all of this had happened because Tony wanted to prove to everyone he wasn't the smallest in the group. He had always been self-conscious of his height, growing insecure and worried that his smaller-than-average stature would look like an open invitation for vultures such as Obie to see him as easy prey, like Howard used to say he would be.
An hour passed, two, three, and Steve never showed up. Tony tried calling him, his friend Bucky, and even his mother - Mrs. Sarah, who was a delight of a woman -, but no one ever answered him, so five hours later, he gave up, and went back home.
“G-great. You are doing- Ah! Fuck!” Tony yelled once Steve inserted the finger even deeper, successfully finding his spot in the first go, “You are b-better than I was expecting, a-actually.”
Alright, that caught him off guard. He subtly looked in Peter's direction only to find the boy blushing and looking down as if suddenly his sneakers had become really interesting. Tony smiled.
Jarvis gasped at the same time the burly sentinel smiled deviously and strolled back into the room, yelling something that riled up the other Vikings. Jarvis quickened his step and forced Tony to do the same as they followed the Viking King out of the castle, but even in their haste, Tony was still able to hear it: the unmistakable noise of a massacre taking place, and Howard Stark’s screams echoing through the frigid walls of his iron castle until they ceased completely. Realization struck Tony, and his eyes widened in both horror and amazement. The king had killed Howard after all? But why? Hadn’t he been the price to even things out? And if he would kill Howard anyway, why he accepted to take Tony and the servants away before he gave the order?
times that I was doing what I could, and that the universe is an endless place so the probability of me finding you without at least a little hint would be practically nonexistent, and every single time we argued about it — because the damn stubborn-headed ass wouldn’t let up for a single moment.”
“I know! It’s just… you had to see him, Steve. All righteous and adorable and talking about learning lessons and how he needs to grow himself before he could join us,” Tony pouted before Steve’s annoyed expression, “Couldn’t force him. Didn’t have it in me, and besides,” Tony’s pout merged into a smirk, “he sounded much like you, even asked if he could meet you.” And he sighed dramatically, “Guess I’m not his
“Not really… I was hoping I would with Peggy, one day, but we didn’t do more than kiss once before I went under the ice.”
“Yeah, I gathered that much babe, but given Cap here seems very eager to go after our current targets, I figured he should know that Stane knows we are after him and is planning to escape.”
"What?!" She was seething, "How dare you want to kick my son out just because of a little school fight?! That's how boys this age communicate!"
“Father, please, don’t rile them up.” Tony hissed, earning a pointed glare from the man, “We saw what they are capable of, we shouldn’t—”
Tony almost scoffed. Was he serious right now? “Wow, guess my response to your kiss wasn’t as good as I expected. In my defense, my head wasn’t quite working right, so I declare my sloppiness justified.”
But it turned out alright in the end. Tony still struggled some to properly talk with the kids, but in most part he did well. It also helped that Natasha was the one doing most of the job, so there was that.
Bucky released a sigh, “That’s not what I meant. You are allowed to grieve Stevie, but it wasn’t exactly your fault. The bastard actually had the Northern kingdoms attacked and left in a dire condition, they would have been wiped out of the map if we hadn’t gone there.”
“But that’s stupid! Even if he figures out about Anthony and wants to rescue him, he won’t be able if we use Anthony and the stone against him! Didn’t you just tell me you have leverage against him, so he will answer to us no matter what? Well, let’s use that!”
Peter turned around still in his father's hold to glare at Flash,  "Did not! You were the one who was picking on Ned!"
animals - she was currently in the process of convincing her big brother to try and convince her daddy to give them a puppy -, but the slow pace in which Mrs. Maximoff was using in order to coax the other kids to repeat after her was just
Mrs. Thompson looked between outraged and aroused, and Tony honestly had to bit his lip to hold back his laughter.
“Is that so?” Steve asked with amusement clear on his tone as a smile tugged at the corners of his lips, “Does that make me less awesome?”
Tony, for one, was constantly looking after the female captain along with Natasha, also feeling indebted to her for what she had done for them — not to mention he adored her strong personality and how the two of them hit it off amazingly, and before both knew, they had fallen into a great companionship that Tony just couldn’t see himself without.
"'Suppose I am," Steve backed down again, looking deep into Tony's eyes while gently pulling his hand and placing a tender kiss to his knuckles, just like Tony had done with Natasha earlier, "I'll guess that shows not only our hands fit perfectly together, hm?"
busy man, but even like so, he found time to give her and her big brother attention! Sure he had grown a bit distant after he figured out Uncle Obie was actually a meanie, and lately he hasn’t had much time since he was dating that scary
Oh yeah, and Captain America sporting a beard? That was something he never knew he needed — Tony nuzzled up to Steve’s soft beard, causing the man to chuckle —,
Her daddy’s expression immediately went from soft to unsure, “I don’t know, girls. It’s still school day tomorrow, and I’m sure Morgan is tired-”
“I don’t think—” King Steven attempted, but he didn’t get to finish since in the next second Howard successfully managed to strip Tony bare from his robe, and was shoving the young prince forward, causing him to fall by the other king’s feet completely naked and shivering from both disbelief and humiliation.
Could someone orgasm just out of hearing pleasantries? Because Tony honestly felt like he was about to.
Tony, however, frowned. “What gave you that idea? Oh, maybe the fact I’m justifiably uncomfortable having to talk with a guy that vanished from my fucking life without even bothering to say goodbye? Yeah, that sounds like a good reason, maybe.” He spat out, causing Steve to flinch.
Steve, who hadn’t been suspecting a thing, looked at Tony in askance, somehow missing the way Tony’s face burned crimson as he hissed, “
“I needed to summarize it somehow?” He feebly suggested, plopping down the nearest comforter, “I really need your help with this.”
Tony hitched a breath, looking back up towards Steve, who kept eyeing him hungrily in a way he never imagined Steve would be capable of looking at anyone. He opened his mouth to say something, when he felt his back soflty collide against a nearby wall, surprising him and causing his mouth to fall shut just as Steve shortened even more the space between them, their mouths inches apart, breaths mingling together.
“Of course I would! Anything for our kingdom.” Howard laughed, almost hysterically. Tony wasn’t sure if the man had gone full mad or not, but he didn’t really find strength in himself to care, “Isn’t that what he wanted? To save us all? Well, there is it! Everyone wins! Now take the little whore and get out of my territory.”
"Oh shit!" he beamed at Steve, who visibly relaxed on his chair at Tony's positive reaction, "Then one more reason to bring her here! She needs special attention."
Silence stretched on after that, and after a few minutes, Tony felt Jarvis tap gently at his head, which he raised questioningly only to meet the Viking Lord’s impressive blue eyes. King Steven had lowered himself to their level, the previous fury absent from his face as he gazed ao them with a look exuding sorrow, empathy, and much for Tony’s surprise, a twinge of concern.
Steve groaned in embarrassment and threw an arm over his eyes, “Please, don’t just say these things.”
Steven stared at Howard unimpressed, seemingly having expected the answer, “Of course you don’t. You weren’t there when your men and the weapons manufactured by you slaughtered my people, now were you?” He flatly said, and Tony’s stomach dropped, “After all, only a cowardly king doesn’t follow his armies into battle to witness the carnage they wrought.”
"Do you ever shut up?" Tony complained, removing his hand and huffing slightly, "Your hand is kinda bigger than mine, which is ridiculous. You are not that much bigger than me!"
Standing by the door with a look capable of making even the bravest of people soil their pants, was possibly the most beautiful specimen Tony had ever laid eyes on. He had short blonde hair and a full beard that looked far too soft to be real, a pair of piercing blue eyes that burned with poor concealed fury and sent a pleasurable shiver down Tony's spine, who was having a hard time to try and stop ogling those absurdly broad shoulders and the ridiculous muscles that were just as poorly concealed by a flannel long sleeved shirt — sleeves which were folded up to his elbows. The worn out jeans and the brown shoes assembled an outfit that would usually make Tony scoff and look the other way — affronted by such an insult to fashion — but the guy somehow pulled off in the hottest way possible.
Perhaps things had started rocky between them, and maybe their path together hadn’t been the easiest, but if there was anything Tony was certain about, was that a love that survives through adversity, grows to be the strongest of them all — and he was more than happy he had found it with Steve.
Who, given her naturally overprotective nature, clearly hadn’t liked what she heard given her narrowed eyes and serious expression.
Steve, however, stared at the device in such a painful way that one would think the thing killed his mother. “
… And perhaps other things as well, if the opportunity came to pass. Tony smirked inwardly. Yes, he sure could offer that man
Sure meeting Rhodey at MIT a few months later helped, as did Pepper’s appearance in his life a few years later, but he kept his circle of friends as small as possible, keeping even Pepper and Rhodey at arm’s length for quite some time after they met, but they never gave up on him, and if wasn’t for them, Tony was pretty sure he would have drowned in his own sorrow and self-hatred - mainly after Morgan’s mother appeared in his life and managed to make everything even worse.
Tony wasn’t proud of how Steve Rogers turned out to be his weakness, but it was useless to deny the truth any longer, mainly seeing how stupidly fast his heart had gotten upon watching Steve being heartbroken about their separation and Tony never having used that damn phone that yeah, he carried everywhere because he had some masochist hope that one day Steve himself would make contact. Tony sighed.
Gasps echoed from the king’s subjects, while the surrounding Vikings sneered in agreement in the same foreign tongue. Tony blinked in exasperation, looking around in both concern and uneasiness. They didn’t speak English? How would they be reasoned with if they didn’t speak English?
Yeah, Tony had gotten over his crush on Captain America... But his crush on Steve Rogers was a completely different story.
“It will be alright, your highness, you’ll see.” Jarvis whispered to him while keeping his trembling body close, “I’m sure these fine men can be reasoned with. We’ll be alright.”
That was too big of a blow on his self-control, and a single tear rolled down Tony’s cheek, “I yelled at you.”
Morgan’s eyes widened as she marveled at the fact that Mary had just said exactly what she had just been thinking.
Tony bit back an amused smile. That man truly was adorable to think Tony hadn't already think this through, "You don't have to worry about that. Until I properly equip the academy with suitable classes and qualified professionals to tend for gifted children, I'll tutor her myself."
Tony, in the meanwhile, watched the scene unfold in pure confusion. He had read about the barbarians, but his knowledge was very shallow and superficial. He had no recollection of learning about any King capable of causing even Howard the Great to cower and shiver like a pathetic wimp. Howard was arrogant, and overly confident. Not even the worst Kings with the worst reputations had ever managed to scare him, seeing how most kingdoms were highly dependent on the Iron Kingdom and the weapons they manufactured. There was no king who wasn’t under Howard’s thumb, so what…?
And to be really honest, Steve couldn't put into words how glad he was to find out how wrong he had been.
“122,474447138 plus lots of other numbers,” Mary confidently answered, causing the woman to blink in shock and gawk at her for a moment, and then proceed to reach for the calculator sitting on her desk.
Smirking proudly at himself for his success, Tony lowered himself to the edge of the bed and kneeled by it, pulling Steve’s pants along and leaving him bare with nothing but his black boxers, which presented quite the impressive volume. Tony felt his mouth water at the sight, and he didn’t remember ever feeling like this with the prospect of giving someone head before. He had his share of good looking dudes to fuck and fuck him through his life, but he had to admit that absolutely all of them paled in comparision to Steve Rogers, whose happy trail led inside the boxers and actually left little to no imagination to what expected Tony inside of them. Wanting to take his time and not spoil the surprise, however, Tony started his ministrations over the cloth of the boxers, sucking and biting at the twitching member and succeeding to cause the man to whimper. Tony couldn’t help but to smile. There was something empowering about having Captain fucking America as bare and vulnerable as he was at this moment at Tony’s mercy, to do whatever he want. A shrill of pleasure wracked through his spine as he continued to suck and bite through the fabric. Yeah. This was definitely good.
Smart kids were his favorite, however. They were easier to understand, and far easier to entertain for him in particular, so if Mary was anything like Peter, then he was more than inclined to help her out.
There was something. A very intimate and immediate something that could happen right now in this room once he gave JARVIS the order to lock the door, but Tony held back his tongue.
Peter whimpered on his seat, while Flash seemed all too smug as his mother continued to bark more biased nonsense at Tony. He breathed deeply and did his best to reign in his sudden need to kick both the woman and her stupid brat out of the room —
That is until her first word came along on a morning where she saw Tony stumbling around during a particularly bad hungover, and even if one would expect her to barely know him given his absence, Morgan immediately beamed up as she called out “Da!” and reached for him from her little raised chair, where Pepper had been feeding her.
almost ripped through the fabric of the damn flannel, Tony felt his mouth watering and being unable to criticize Steve’s questionable fashion sense.
Seeing that there would be no more interruptions from the Thompsons, Tony calmly turned his attention to the Parkers and had to hold back a smug smile. Peter had a starstruck expression on his little face while his father eyed him with a quirked brow and curiosity sparkling in those beautiful baby blues, which could make Tony bend the will of the world if asked of him.
Clint gasped, faking outrage, "Stark, you wound me! Whatever shall I do without your sweet kisses and praises!"
Steve stared at his friend for a moment, taking his words in consideration and processing what they meant, but then moved his eyes back to the map, “They are dead, Bucky, and all because I was a fool to fall for a distraction, so forgive me for not being in a good mood.”
was more than enough to get his head back where it should be. Tony had lost himself during that year because he also thought he was unworthy of being Morgan’s father. That if he was fooled and abandoned twice by people that he loved, then maybe he truly was the screw up Howard always said he was, but Morgan calling him “Da” despite the fact he had been absent from her entire first year life showed him that it didn’t matter what he thought he was, or others thought he was worth it, the only thing that matter was that Morgan still saw him. Morgan still loved him.
The little shit looked too smug for his own good, and Tony found himself laughing at the absurdity of the situation as he felt the heat creep up his neck and tinge his cheeks.
"What is this about, Tony?" Steve curiously asked as he came to a stop before Tony, Nat right by his side. Tony almost jumped at the sudden — and rather silent — proximity of those two.
Mrs. Thompson was redder than before now, and if Tony didn't know any better, he would say she was about to explode. She took her son's hand and forcefully pulled him out of the plush chair he had been sulking in. "You'll regret this. My lawyer will be hearing of this absurdity, so consider your school's pristine reputation ruined."
“To reestablish the balance between life and death, the debt must be paid in blood,” Grumpy Brunette explained with a thick accented voice, apparently noticing his king was otherwise preoccupied, “Your father has slaughtered our people with no concern. Evil men died, as much as innocent ones did, so it’s only natural for the debt to be paid the same way.” The man twirled the mace in his hand, “The natural order must be restored, unless you want the wrath of the All-Father to be wrought upon your souls in the afterlife.”
"Nat is a woman, Tony," Bruce rolled his eyes good naturedly, "and for the average female height she is quite tall. I meant between us guys."
First were Wilson and Barnes, who remained the same except for Barnes who had miraculously cut down that wavey mane of his. They were engaged in a lighthearted conversation as they walked down the platform, soon to be followed by Wanda and Natasha, who were sporting perfectly sandy-blond wigs that helped on their disguise of looking like the wife and daughter of Big, Blond and Beautiful. They seemed to be laughing and talking about something Tony didn’t bother trying to decipher, since he was too busy trying to look past them to try and see—
against his thigh, big and overpowering, causing Tony to moan in both surprise and elation, “Steve…”
But now, surrounded by Steve's warm embrace after being kissed silly by him, Tony didn't feel at all scared or insecure. In fact, he had never felt safer.
Peter whimpered again, and Tony was about to jump to his feet to tear the woman a new one, when a deep masculine voice beat him to it, "What did you just call my son?"
Steve's seductive look was soon replaced by one of concern as he straightened up on the chair and worriedly asked, "Are you alright?"
And spill he did. He told Carol everything, from his idea to watch some footage in order to end his boredom to the discovery of Steve’s ‘hot look’ and all those absurdly nonsensical things he kept telling Bruce about how he missed Tony and how Tony was important to him. Carol just listened with full attention, her expression shifting from surprised to intrigued depending on what Tony relayed, and once he was completely done, Carol had this amused twinkle in her eyes that both unnerved and annoyed Tony.
but my mother, who I don’t know if you fucking remember, died before you left me like you said you wouldn’t. Do you know how much time I spent waiting in that damn park for you, Steven? Five hours. Five
He was not ready for Steve's charming smile, however, and neither for the words that followed, "Sure looks like a dream."
“What do you want, new girl?” Duncan demanded as he scrunched up his nose, but Mary continued to glare at him.
Tony stared at him for a moment at a loss of words. Was this a dream? Would he wake up at any moment with a raging boner and a huge amount of disappointment? Because if it was the case, then he hoped he would never wake up again in his life. Might as well fall into a coma for all he cared.
Tony had no idea what was going on, nor why the king was looking at him with sad, concerned eyes, which held so much gentleness that Tony felt his face warming up. He frowned and hid his face partially with the furs to keep his damp blushed cheeks from sight. He expected lecherous looks, or even angry ones, not this.
Mr. Rogers chuckled in embarrassment and rubbed the back of his neck, and Tony counted that as an ultimate win. If that man didn't smile as often as Tony hoped, that should be considered a national crime against humanity.
“When I arrived from space all of this was gone, though,” he pointed out with a small smile as he gently tugged at the dark blond strands adorning Steve’s sharp jaw, “Did you shave just for me, Mr. Rogers?” He teased, which earned him a weak smile from Steve.
, right? There’s no way. Sure there had been two years since they had broken things off in terrible terms, and Steve did send that half-assed apology in the form of a letter and a prehistoric phone, but… there’s no way Steve could have such a high opinion of him.
"I'm not happy about a fight having breaking out on my school, but I can understand why you lost your cool." Tony then moved his eyes to Mr. Rogers, "Besides, with such a cool superhero as your father, I'm sure it would be difficult to just sit around and do nothing while a friend of yours is in trouble."
you to understand that, because we can’t face this or any other threat and win, if we are not working together.” Large hands came to rest on top of Tony’s shoulders, “I need you to focus and tell me what is wrong, so maybe I can help you lessen the burden out of your shoulders. I’ve failed to tell you this before, and I won’t repeat this mistake again.”
,” he rumbled, causing Jarvis to pull Tony closer again almost automatically, but the protective gesture didn’t keep the Viking from proceeding, “would you like to come with us?”
The boy is terribly unstable, so at the moment, he’s a double edged sword. He might both cause damage to Rogers
“M-move,” Tony demanded, moving his hips slightly and causing both him and Steve to gag, “Please, Steve.”
That startled a laugh out of Steve, who just shook his head and kissed the top of Tony's head again, "Not yet, sweetheart. Let me take you out on a few dates first, starting tomorrow."
Which was why waking up to Darlene gone along with several other expensive items and the stash of money he kept in one of the Penthouse’s vaults cleaned out, was an absolute and terrible shock to Tony.
it doesn’t matter, you stubborn ass! You say that now, but as soon as you’re done you’ll be destroyed, and you know it!”
“I’m pretty sure the beard gave Tony an incentive to force his stamina to last a little longer.” Natasha chuckled, pulling Carol back down and returning to her task of caressing the blonde’s head, “I’ll be sure to make him thank me for it tomorrow. I worked pretty hard on grooming Mr. Grouchy for these past two months, you know?”
He wasn’t sure if that was a blessing or a curse, but judging by his racing heart and flushed cheeks as he stared at the screen?
Once everything at Morgan’s school was solved - what ended on the Williams being very disgruntled as Fury warned them to keep their kid under control, since his behavior has been a headache for him even before he started to pick on Morgan - Tony found himself sitting on a bench park with Steve by his side as they watched their girls have a good time at the local playground outside the school. They were silent, since Tony was unsure how to even start a conversation with a man he hasn’t seen for the past two decades, and Steve was not trying to start any conversation either.
Steve took his sweet time pleasuring and worshiping Tony in a way he had never experienced before. He had no idea for how long Steve did it, but by the time Steve was sliding into him in order to connect their bodies as one, Tony could no longer hold back his moans, and he could only mentally pat himself on the back for having made the room walls soundproof.
She never told daddy, however. Just recently he started to feel better - uncle Obie’s betrayal hurt him really bad - and started to accept the fact she needed to attend to school. She didn’t like it, and would much rather stay with him at all times, but she couldn’t be selfish right now. Daddy had a lot of work now that he couldn’t rely on uncle Obie anymore, and the only person who was helping him was aunt Pep, so Morgan didn’t want them arguing about her situation anymore. He daddy would be overwhelmed with worry if he knew of what she was enduring, not to mention how bad he would feel to know she was being picked on due who he was - Morgan was
the way his biceps were marking and stretching the shirt. The poor thing looked about to rip apart at any second.
“T-Tony, Tony wait. God.” Steve Sat up, placing a hand on Tony’s hair while he grabbed a fistful of his own. Tony didn’t wait, however, and kept on with his agenda of deepthroating Steve like his life depended on it, “J-Jesus Christ, you’ll kill me.”
"I— uh—," Tony stuttered, looking from Steve's face to their hands, and then back at Steve, "Yours is, uh, hilariously bigger. Yeah."
“No, I haven’t, much for his damn luck!” Tiberius crossed his arms against his chest and jutted out his chin petulantly, “I’d have decked the asshole on sight otherwise.”
Tony felt something warm roll down his cheek, and was quick to wipe it off before the reality he was crying settled in. Yeah, he almost did call Steve,
Other than that, the universe had been saved, those who were lost had been returned, and things were back as they should be — but some things? Those never change.
Peter hummed an agreement as he walked down the corridor, and Steve felt a wave of warmth crash against him as another smile stretched his lips. It was truly crazy to think that this was his life now. Not only a renowned superhero in which the world could rely on, but also a husband and a father, who just happened to be cooking a special dinner in order to welcome his beloved husband back home after a long, tiring trip. If someone told him this would be his life, he would have laughed non-stop for a long time - mainly if it was pre-serum him - but he couldn’t imagine himself anywhere else. Now
Tony, however, was not entirely engaged on the conversation going on between father and son. The guy was in the military once upon a time. He probably was one of those veteran soldiers with a whole lot of medals and achievements behind him, and that explained pretty well why his body seemed to be sculpted by the Greek gods and brought to life by Aphrodite herself.
Not that Tony would be against Steve a second time. If the world ever decided to demand them to sign themselves into a leash again, then this time he’d be right by Steve’s side, proudly snarling at them to back the fuck off.
"So?" Steve's gentle voice pulled him back to reality, causing Tony to blink confusedly at his smiling face, "What is your veredict?"
His chest tightened at how small the young boy seemed. His eyes were glossy with unshed tears and his lower lip trembling, but he had this determined spark in his eyes that told Tony he did not regret what he had done.
That being said, TW for some homophobia, depressive thoughts, abandonment and the fact that Howards Stark is a class A MOTHERF*CKER in this story. That alone is a trigger warning, just, ugh. You'll see what I'm talking about.
“God dammit, Steve, are you even listening to yourself? You sound completely out of your mind! I sure hell am all on board with splitting skulls and letting our animals feast of what is left, but that’s
There was a stunned silence for a moment as the three children looked at each other, and then the reality of what had just happened seemed to dawn on Duncan and he broke into tears as he cried loudly.
.” The leader rumbled, once again silencing the room. His voice was husky and held peacefulness to it, but Tony wasn’t sure if he trusted any peace coming from the barbarian, “
“I’ll use my mouth, then.” Steve announced easily as he nipped at Tony’s collarbone, catching Tony by surprise yet again, “I want to taste you as well. All of you.”
Dodger howled and departed, prompting the rest of the pack to follow after him. The ground beneath their powerful paws shook violently as the great pack thundered through the fields, with the countless birds of prey that belonged Sam flying like bullets above their heads and Bucky’s saber effortlessly keeping up with them. From anyone looking from outside, their assembly was nothing short of terrifying, but Steve couldn’t care less about appearances at the moment. On usual days, he would be concerned if their group looked scary for bystanders and would cause unnecessary ruckus, but right now, the only thing he cared about was arriving in time to keep Stane and Stone from escaping and avenging his friends. If he died trying, well… then he would just be getting what he deserved for having failed Howard and Maria in the first place, but he was
Tony’s head jerked up at Steve’s words; eyes widening and heart thudding violently against his chest  as his eyes focused back on the forlorn looking man.
so I can’t afford to just… stop.” Tony looked right into the depths of that absurdly blue gaze, which held his own with… was that… adoration?
Tony groaned, moving to his next test subject, "Please, stay away from the internet. The last thing I need is you communicating through memes."
"But— but—" Steve clearly was trying to form an argument against the idea, and Tony let him. He sure was cute when he was fumbling. "Don't you have a company to run? And the school? I'm sure you have a lot of—"
Tony cursed himself for allowing his mind to wander off in no helpful way, and decided to latch on the first thing his mind supplied him with, "You said you have a youngest?"
had passed, and Tony wasn't just missing the captain like hell, but he was also terrified of what awaited him whenever his team landed back in American soil.
, so Tony tried as much as he could to keep him away from harm and grounded before something bad could happen. Steve, ever the concerned Team Dad(tm), had also asked him to do so, and Tony couldn’t help but to smile as he remembered the Captain’s words when he confided in him that he had brought a fourteen year old into the battlefield back then.
Tears rolled freely down Tony’s cheeks now. He just couldn’t believe this was happening. “I am your son, not him! And you are practically condemning me to a life of suffering!”
” FRIDAY’s agreed sounding far too amused for a computer program. Tony huffed and shook his head fondly. Why did he need to give his creations so much personality?
The boys were a no-go as well. Even though they shared most of her tastes, they never really wanted to play with her since she was a girl, and some - like Duncan - were particuarly mean to her due something to do with his parents disliking her daddy. He constantly teased and picked on her, either about her intelligence or about her daddy, but she refused to cry in front of him or anyone else. Her daddy had told her once that Starks were made of iron, and while it’s alright to be vulnerable around people that care about you, you must
"So..." Mr. Rogers' sultry voice interrupted his rampant thoughts and dragged him back to reality, "if this is solved, what else you needed to talk to me about, Mr. Stark?"
.” Tony bit out, his sarcasm not going unnoticed by Howard, who finally directed an annoyed look towards him. “You might trust that bald weasel he has for a father for whatever reason, but I don’t. Tiberius already torments me enough as it is, imagine if I belong to him in any way!”
The assassin grinned even wider as Carol sit up with a large smile, her scarred arm already free from the sling, “Did they finally talk things out?”
Tony gasped in outrage, eyes wide, “Obvious infat— okay little miss, just put the damn video and hush unless you want me to donate you to the nearest college.”
“No, just… come with me.” He demanded briskly, taking a hold of Steve’s bare forearm — he had folded the damn sleeves up to his elbows, the heathen — and dragging him along.
"Unsure which rock you have been living in not to know your daughter and I are much alike, but as you can see, I can help you more than you know."
"Say, how about we start these dates nights tonight, but up on my floor with movies and some take-out?" He suggested gingerly, causing Steve to cease the tender assault against his neck — much for Tony's disappointment — and quirk up a brow at him. "No 'love making' yet, old man, just some cuddling, and maybe..." Tony traced a finger over the planes of Steve's broad shoulders, "some really intense make out sessions?"
and that he was donning nothing less than Tony’s own craftsmanship. It practically stamped Steve Rogers as Tony’s and his only, and while he knew it was silly so think like that when all the other Avengers used his creations just the same, it was different when it was about Steve. For Steve he would sew the uniform entirely by hand, and for Steve he would even sew in ‘Rogers’ into the fabric, purely out of a whim to make his man’s clothes as impeccable as he could. It was pleasant, almost gratifying, and Tony couldn’t help but to enjoy the sight of how well the suit hugged at Steve’s stunning form and made him look powerful while being incredibly well protected. It was a truly formidable sight, and it was
“Not right now, no, but tell you what,” Tony smiled, “swing by next week on Friday, and I’m sure Cap won’t object teaching you some of his moves, hm?”
King Steven finally seemed to find him through the throng of people, and once their eyes met, Tony felt himself freeze in place. The king stared at him, eyes narrowed but sparking interest—interest that Tony fully intended to take advantage of. “And who might you be, mouthy one?” King Steven demanded, stepping forward once more. Tony inhaled deeply and ignored Howard’s outraged glare. This was his chance. If there’s any way he could save what was left of his people, then he would take it, consequences be damned.
That had the Viking King stopping in his tracks and then turning around; a frown etched in his features while he looked for the source of the desperate scream.
“A-are you kidding me,” Tony moaned, grabbing fistfulls of the sheets when Steve quickened the pace, “you smug bastard, where did that shy idiot go?”
Steve grunted against his ear, continuing to move inside on a steady pace that was sending all kinds of possible shivers down Tony’s spine. “You feel so good, Tones. Shit.” Steve growled against his neck, tightening the hold on his hips and causing Tony to moan louder and louder, “There. There you are.”
“Shut up, space-brains.” Tony huffed angrily, crossing his arms in front of his chest and looking away as his entire face acquired the same red hue of his cheeks at the prospect of his fight with Steve being seen as a ‘divorce’.
The hands around his waist tightened their hold, “Would that be so bad?” Steve asked shakily, looking at Tony with so much adoration it actually caused his heart to skip a beat. The engineer smirked wolfishly at the man beneath him, grinding against him with abandon and causing Steve to grunt deliciously in response.
"If you say so, but I'm glad that it pleases you, which is why I'm inclined to keep your children in here and properly nurture them."
"I have the feeling that we will get along just fine, Steve." Tony pointed out once he regained some of his dignity, getting up from his chair and prompting Steve to do the same. He started to walk towards the door, and Steve followed suit. "I'll have my personal assistant contact you about the job, but I'd like you to bring little Mary tomorrow once you come to drop off Peter. I'd like to meet her as soon as possible."
"Oh shut it, birdbrain. You know JARVIS can just record anything you guys want to watch, so stop making a scene." Tony rolled his eyes, earning a petulant pout from Clint.
“I-I c-couldn’t,” Steve choked out, clearly not being able to think clearly due Tony’s ministrations, “It moved a bit, y-yes, but I couldn’t lift… all the way…”
Mrs. Maximoff, in other hand, just arched up a perfect brow and asked with a smile, “Already knows, huh? Very well then sweetheart, would you mind telling me how much is 20+35?”
The response was far better than what Tony could have expected, since Steve turned the tables and was now shoving him on the bed, devouring Tony’s lips with so much despair and need that Tony felt himself become delirious. He fumbled with Steve’s shirt, doing his best to try and rid him of the pesky piece of fabric that insisted on staying between them, but feeling far too light headed to actually manage. Noticing Tony’s annoyance, Steve briefly sat up and removed the shirt in one swift movement, leaving nothing but the dog tags Tony hadn’t noticed before hanging on his neck. Tony felt all the air inside his lungs get knocked out of him as he drank the sight before him - Steven Grant Rogers, a panting mess with reddened lips and mussed hair who looked down at Tony as if he was ready to devour him in one bite, and god, did he want that.
“Thought you were supposed to be the genius,” She teased with a grin, earning a pointed glare from Tony that caused her to laugh, “Fine, fine, it’s just… Honestly, Stark? Rogers is so stupidly obvious that is painful to watch.”
. "Why don't you bring her around for her to have a look at our school? Our grades range from preschool up to the senior year."
Steve stepped closer and Tony felt strong arms snaking around his waist, pulling him against Steve’s broad chest and keeping Tony’s eyes captive of his own, “As you should have. I broke your trust, I tore the team apart, I tore
The letter that let him know Darlene - which wasn’t even her real name - had actually fooled him this entire time, and had wanted nothing from him but his money.
Mr. Rogers hugged his son back and smiled that warm smile of his, "That's alright, champion. Just see it doesn't happen again." Peter nodded against his father's shirt, then released him and darted for the door, quickly opening it and running out as his father called out after him, "And no running!"
aware of Steve’s body, which was still glued on him since he hadn’t backed enough to actually release Tony from his embrace. The hard planes of his stomach, the sturdy chest that was far too broad to be fair, the power thighs that just happened to be brushing against his own. Tony hadn’t really noticed how close Steve had been, but now that he did, he didn’t really have the strength to fight the man’s hold. Something told him to back away, to put some space between them, but a bigger part of his mind successfully shut that little voice as it slapped Tony with the actual truth behind his fears and his actions, and Tony heard himself gasp when realization dawned on him.
apart,” he nuzzled Tony’s palm again, seeming to seek absolvation from his sins through Tony’s touch, “I didn’t deserve any forgiveness, but I was so happy you were safe. That you weren’t gone, too.”
From this close, Tony could never miss how Steve’s cheeks acquired a lovely crimson hue, or the pink tint that colored the tips of his ears, causing the engineer’s heart to swell with affection and emotion and how adorable the sight was, “You heard that too?” Steve asked feebly, which caused Tony to chuckle.
It was hard for Tony to like anything regarding the military seeing how often him and his father head-butted when Howard engaged on his 'I was in the military once and proudly served my country, so I don't get why you won't do the same' talk, but somehow, Mr. Rogers had absolutely nothing that discouraged Tony's from entertaining the great amount of sexual fantasies involving a uniform that struck him like a bullet.
“Alright, now, it’s time for math!” Mrs. Maximoff piped in, erasing the blackboard and starting to write down her numbers. After a few scribbles that resulted on a simple problem of how much is 5+5, she turned back at the class and asked, “So, who would like to give a try today?”
Also, be warned, Tiberius and Obadiah are disgusting human beings, so they will speak as disgusting human beings. They might discuss the possibility of abuse, but it's very light and just hinted... but trust me, there ain't having none of that in this story, because I ain't a fan of that. Thx.
Maybe he had gone a bit overkill on his plan to get Steve’s beard back, but with Tony Stark it was either go big or go home, so he didn’t hold back any punches when he decided to tell Steve about the undercover mission he had requested Coulson to find a week later after his chat with Carol.
"There is nothing to understand! This is what happens when you decide to do charity and bring these kind of people into our midst!"
“Hey hey, none of that now,” Steve gently said, seeming to read his mind through his tearful eyes and pulling Tony against his naked chest, nuzzling the side of his face in a comforting way, “I know what your mind is doing, and I’m not going
There was a moment of silence, which Tony was endlessly grateful for, and then he heard Rogers getting onto his feet and walking. For a moment, Tony thought he was walking back from whence he came, but was proven wrong when the man stepped beside him and gazed in the same direction as him. “Men are fated to commit mistakes and learn from them, so what you did or not doesn’t matter now, what matters is how we fix it.” Tony finally brought himself to look towards him, who eventually did the same, “Nobody’s perfect, Tony.”
Steve hesitated, and Tony didn't push this time, only offering the man the best supportive look he could come up with. He was the director of a prestigious school, was he not? Helping kids was one of his duties, even though he absolutely sucked at dealing with them directly. Rhodey used to laugh at his lack of efficiency when it came to dealing with children, and in Tony's defense, he had gotten a lot better at it, but Howard's terrible parenting didn't really help his references. All he knew he learned through Pepper, who forcibly made him study some pedagogy on his free time.
." She had reassured him when he was too panicked to actually be more of a constant in the academy. "
even, but she never picked up either.” Tony noticed hurt flash across Steve’s bright blue eyes, but he was too upset to care, “You
Suddenly, Tony completely forgot what he was even doing there as he was held captive by Steve's eyes. It wasn't fair, really. Tony was sure he had gotten over this stupid child crush he had developed for Captain America when he was a kid — Howard's obsession with the man helping to stomp down those feelings fairly easily as admiration morphed into hatred — but again, this wasn't quite Captain America who was looking at him with affection and as if he was something worth admiring, was it?
He clapped his hands, interrupting the talk going on between the three of them and earning their attention, "Attention, my most illustrious team! You are about to partake in a scientific experiment!"
Tony grinned openly as he watched the kid beam at the Iron Spider, which gleamed from behind the glass case in which it lay waiting for the taking. He had been proud of Peter, and that was no lie. After his participation in the fight Tony ended up having with Steve about the accords and his old pal Bucky, which had ended amicably thanks to a lot of misunderstandings cleared and a stupid villain’s failure that consisted of the guy thinking that using something Steve had already told Tony about a long time ago would tear them apart - disclaimer: it didn’t. - Tony honestly thought the kid had it in him to become something great in a distant future, but still needed a
"Call Mrs. Potts. I need to let her know I have a security guard to hire, and also reschedule all of my tasks for the day," he downed the rest of his whiskey and picked up the Stark Pad, "I have a whole new section of this place to plan."
“I know sweetheart, I’m so sorry.” Steve apologized again, voice as shaky and tear filled as before, arms tight and warm around Tony, keeping him safe.
“It wasn’t your fault.” Steve told him firmly, and Tony couldn’t help the dry chuckle that escaped his lips.
“No, I’m tired, which is a bummer, since I’m sure you could go for a few more rounds.” Tony pouted, opening his eyes and seeing Steve, who had laid by his side and was staring at him adoringly, “What?”
Later that same night, he had snapped at Steve; all the anger, all the pain and all the grief becoming too much for Tony to hold any longer, and in the next day, when Steve and the others returned with the crushing news that Thanos had destroyed the stones before dying, Tony snapped again — only this time he sent them away and yelled at Steve that he ‘
She then proceeded to call what seemed to be Mrs. Romanoff’s number, since Morgan heard her teacher call the monitor’s name as she spoke in hushed tones. Morgan then she turned her gaze towards Mary, who seemed completely unaware of the impressed looks sent her way, until she wasn’t, “What?” she asked, frowning, “Those were simple math problems!”
The girls cheered and threw their little fists in the air, triumph clear in their faces while Morgan’s daddy laughed and Mr. Steve stared at him, dazzling smile on his lips as he looked at Morgan’s daddy like he was the most breathtaking sight he had ever laid eyes on.
“God, Steve, sucking dick is not the end of the world, will you relax?” Steve blushed so damn red that Tony actually feared he would explode, so he laughed and pecked the embarrassed soldier on his swollen lips, “It’s really no problem to me, and it’s real good, so I feel like you deserve a good experience in your first time.”
Carol yawned and nuzzled up to Natasha’s chest, “Sure, we’ll do that whenever your slowpoke leaders decide to do the same about their relationship. For now, I just want to enjoy you since I had to stay two whole months without you because Stark was desperate to satisfy his recently discovered beard kink.” Se grumpily complained, earning an amused chuckle from Natasha and a kiss on the top of her head for her trouble.
“You’ll fix nothing, you idiot! I rather go to an early grave with my dignity intact rather than bow my head to these savages!”
“Well, we are in luck then,” Steve apparently found his voice, releasing Tony’s waist and placing them on each side of Tony’s neck, with his thumbs gently caressing his cheeks, “because I sure hell feel the same.”
“Rogers has returned from his trip to the North, and it has come to my knowledge that he has already learned of the Stark Clan’s demise.”
Steve backed away slightly but Tony chase after him, throwing his arms around the soldier’s neck and pulling him closer as he took his turn on getting to know each inch of Steve’s mouth. What was chaste and timid became wild and desperate, and after what felt like a lifetime, they finally moved away, panting against each other’s mouths with their foreheads glued. “God, that was better than I expected it would be,” Steve admitted breathlessly, to which Tony chuckled in amusement.
A knock interrupted Morgan’s wandering thoughts and the sloth paced lesson, and she rose her head just in time to watch the school’s monitor - a cool but scary looking lady called Mrs. Romanoff - appear on the door and ask to speak with their teacher. Mrs. Maximoff went to her and they started to speak in hushed tones, until Mrs. Maximoff opened a bright smile and nodded eagerly. Mrs. Romanoff then nodded and proceeded to leave, leaving Mrs. Maximoff to turn her pretty smile to the rest of the class and clap her hands excitedly, “I have great news, sweethearts! Seems we’ll be getting a new friend to join our little class. Isn’t that exciting?”
Tony had a hard time picturing anyone being able to pick on Mr. Muscles and leave the conflict unscathed, "People bullied you? I have a hard time believing that since," Tony gestured towards him, or more specifically, towards said muscles, "you know."
"Tony," Steve called in a low voice, almost a whisper, regaining Tony's attention in a second, "thank you for stepping up for Peter today. You didn't have to, but it means a lot that you did."
He smiled lightly. As silly as it may sound, he did find a family in this gathering of freaks, didn't he?
There were little speckles of green midst that world of blue which stared at him; like a set of aphrodisiac islands situated on the vast blue sea that you can only see by magnifying a satellite's image. There was no better adjective to describe those ocean eyes other than 'groundbreaking', because the intensity of the feeling that wracked Tony’s body and almost made him go weak on the knees could not be addressed as less than earth shattering.
He finally forced himself to look away from their hands and meet Steve's gaze, and Tony was immediately struck by the overwhelming softness that seemed to ooze from the captain's eyes, which somehow had become even bluer since the last time Tony had looked into them a few minutes ago.
friends? The idea made her feel warm and happy. She had always wanted a best friend - other than Mr. Fuzzy, of course.
Which was good, because there was no way in hell Tony would manage to hold himself back tonight. Not when Steve Rogers was this damn good with his mouth.
Tony groaned, "Come on Steve, this isn't the forties anymore. You don't need to woo me before we have sex."
didn’t stop. “I’d have no home if wasn’t for you, and I’d probably take years to catch up with everything I’ve missed in the past 75 years if wasn’t for your help, so, yes… you are as much a leader of this team as I may be, and I hope- no, I
“One would think the guy with the military background would be the strict parent.” Tony whined, “Do you know how difficult it was to take that suit away from him?!
My lovely friend from Twitter, Eva (@cosmicstony, GO FOLLOW HER SHE'S A DELIGHT) made a manip for my story, and it looks so good!!!! I'll put it up on the beginning of the chapter, and it's the scene where Steve and Tony recognize each other on the last chapter. IT TURNED OUT SO GREAT I'M JUST EMKFAELGMAEGKLAEGM!!!. Ugh, Eva, this chapter is dedicated to you, you absolute talented treasure!! I cannot.
“Sure, sure,” Natasha humored the other woman and kissed her girlfriend’s pouting lips, “We should tell them about us, though. Keeping secrets in no the greatest idea in this family.”
"Nope!" Steve denied, popping the 'P', "I've been wanting to do this for years now, so just enjoy the ride."
“In my vision, the one that scared the shit out of me? Everyone was dead and the Chitauri were attacking again, a threat from outer space which we were not a match for this time, and…” he trailed off, suddenly feeling his throat dry before Steve’s attentive gaze, “I-I checked you first, you were closer, and I just wanted-” Tony shook his head, trying to ban the image of a bleeding Steve off his conscience. “You were not dead, yet. You woke up and stared me straight into the eyes and said I could have saved all of you.” Tony turned away as he blinked back tears, “And then you died. Right in front of me.” Then he looked up back to Steve, who looked in between haunted and surprised, “I could have done more, but I didn’t, and you died. It was my fault. You
“Alright, that’s enough,” Mrs. Romanoff snapped, successfully shutting up all three children and turning to their teacher, “Wanda, go tend to the other kids,” She ordered, uncrossing her arms and placing her hands on her hips, “I’ll accompany our troublemakers to Principal Fury’s office. I guess we’ll need to have a word with their parents.”
clear, but then Steve shook his head slightly and broke eye contact, bringing an end to the enchantment and causing Tony's wandering thoughts to come to a screeching halt.
"You know..." Tony rasped, tightening the hold on Steve's hands as the super soldier pressed both on the wall by the sides of Tony's head, completely pinning him down, "if this is some kind of dream in which I'll wake up from in a few seconds, I'll be pretty pissed."
All in a low, deep voice, that was honestly pushing Tony over the edge and giving him energy at the same time, which was great, since Tony was already at an age that keeping up with the insane stamina of a super soldier was basically impossible, but Steve was so damn delicious in every aspect that Tony kept pushing through since he just couldn’t have enough.
Tony closed his eyes and felt the bitter taste of guilt souring his mouth. He had never considered how that entire situation had affected Bruce, struggling as he was, because there wasn’t really any time for him to ruminate on that. Then the snap happened and there was so much pain and grief and—
Tony chuckled at the expression of exasperated fondness present on Mr. Rogers face as he shook his head and turned around to meet his waiting gaze. "Are you sure this is alright, Mr. Stark? He always wanted a pet, and we can't really afford one right now, so this will be more of a reward than anything else."
It didn't cross Tony's mind earlier in the lab once he had this stupid idea, but Steve was much bigger than him. Maybe not as much as Thor or Hulk, but his physique of carefully crafted muscles made Steve seem far bigger than he actually was, which had Tony swallowing in hesitancy as he moved his eyes from Steve's ridiculously blue gaze towards his large palm.
Tony blinked a few times. She couldn't be serious. "I'm saying we don't know all the facts, and that's precisely what we are trying to understand here."
"I'm not lying! I never lie!" Peter barked back, and the boys clearly were about to fall into another fight when Zeus' offspring finally graced Tony's ears with his voice once again.
With a poor concealed frown, Tony decided to be a bit daring and ask, "And why don't you have a job in natural security or something? You are a consecrated war veteran, aren't you?"
"And now you are throwing punches at people as a way of communicating! This is exactly why I don't tell you these things."
“Nope! Still badass!” Peter assured him, apparently hopping off the stool, “Are you sure I need to shower though? It was a slow night, I barely broke a sweat.”
“Yeah?” Steve asked with an infuriating knowing smile as he brought Tony’s hands to his lips in order to kiss his knuckles, “S’that so, sweetheart?”
Bruce then proceeded to reluctantly sit by Steve’s side on another chair, remaining silent for a moment longer before he removed the burner phone from a pocked and offered it to Steve, “
Was it improper to be coveting the parent of one of his students? Absurdly, and Pepper would probably tear him a new one if she found out, but just looking was not a sin, right?
, which was quite the stark contrast with how the man usually carried himself — always so clean, prim and proper; the perfect image of an American golden boy.
There was a pregnant pause, and Tony felt his eyes water as he witnessed just how distressed Steve had been. God, he had no idea, and the way he had yelled at Steve when they met after everything that had happened…
Tony blanched. To the boats? So they were being taken as prisoners? Tony shuddered. He had read about that too, how Vikings took in the ones they didn’t kill as slaves—or Thralls, as they called them. Suddenly, dying didn’t feel so bad, and Tony could only curse Howard and his selfishness for having doomed him and his loyal servants, doomed
“Yes,” Tony moved closer, pushing Steve towards the bed and making him sit down. Once he did, Tony easily climbed on his lap and straddled his hips, causing Steve to flush to a beautiful shade of scarlet as he looked up at Tony, “I’m currently single, and I find absurdly unacceptable how America’s biggest eye candy has never been properly unwrapped, so how about I show you a good time, and both of us can get out minds out of things for awhile? It’s a win-win.”
The weeks after that passed by in a blur. Tony refused to leave his room, and only ate when Jarvis begged him to. He didn’t want to see the king, nor his royal adviser or his bastard of a son. He knew things were already being prepared for the royal wedding that would take place, but he wanted to have no part in it. Just the thought of it made him want to throw up, hence why he hardly bothered to eat. Who knows, maybe if he becomes ugly and thin, Tiberius won’t be so keen to this marriage. Jarvis obviously protested against such foolish plan, but Tony didn’t feel like he had other options. In a week’s time, he would be married to the bane of his existence, a man who would never treasure his genius or who he was, other than perhaps his body. A man who would probably seek other affairs when Tony became too used and his body wasn’t as satisfying and exciting as his younger body used to be. A man who would make his father’s already cruel reign even worst, and would never allow Tony to give any opinion about it. In a week’s time… his life would officially end, and he would do nothing but exist. In a week’s time… he would be as good as dead.
Steve Rogers used to be a man of war, who used to think his only home was the battlefield. A man who woke up from a 70-years nap and was thrust into a world completely different from the one he had grown knowing, with technology beyond what he could understand and lacking the people he had come to call a family. A world where Peggy Carter had moved on with her life, a life without him. A world where he clearly didn’t fit in.
He thought amusedly. He had been a possessive mess earlier, but now he couldn't quite blame her. His train of thought was all over the place as well.
Tony choked out a sob, hiding his face further against Jarvis’ sleeping tunic. They had been caught by surprise in the middle of the night, so everyone gathered was wearing nothing but their sleepwear, much for Tony’s discomfort. He liked to sleep in the nude, which meant he was wearing absolutely nothing under his robes, and that was unnerving when you were surrounded by barbarians whose infamy involved plundering and sexual-assault.
“No, it kinda is. If I didn’t need you so much by my side while we do this whole ‘saving the world’ thing, maybe you could have what Clint does.” Steve’s expression was clouded once again, his jaw clenching as guilt stormed inside his eyes. “A little farm with a family and nothing but peacefulness.”
Tony saw Parker flinch in his seat and immediately felt a spark of irritation surge within him. He was particularly fond of the boy and was not liking the effect the woman's wrath was having on the already teary eyed kid. "Mrs. Thompson, although I can understand why you are upset, I'll need you to tone down a notch. Peter is still a child, and I know enough about him to know he would not have attacked your son unprovoked."
The women stayed silent for a solid minute exchanging impressed looks, until they finally burst out laughing.
Mr. Divine shot her a disbelieving look, "Are you seriously trying to tell me how to raise my kid when yours walks around playing bully?"
Tony’s lips, hungrily swallowing his moans like only a starved man would. It didn’t take long for them to become blissfully naked after that — mostly courtesy of a very desperate Steve, whose impatience ended up causing him to rip off most of Tony’s clothes in his haste to get to feel his body. Tony would have complained, but the display of power and desire had been so absurdly hot that he could do nothing but moan and kiss Steve with the same enthusiasm he would have kissed him back at Clint’s place after Steve ripped that log in half; Steve who was already making him see stars as he worked with his tongue and fingers across Tony’s body.
chance. A single chance, and if I disappoint you, I’ll leave you alone. I swear to you, Tony, but please,” he inhaled sharply, eyes glistening with unshed tears that Tony just now happened to notice, “don’t go where I can’t follow. Not again.”
"Really?" Amusement was clear in Bruce's tone as he pocketed his hands and smiled teasingly at Tony, "Does that really count when I can turn into a giant green monster with hands bigger than your head?"
If Tony thought the others had presence, then he knew absolutely nothing. This man’s presence was so overpowering he silenced the entire room in a way that if a needle fell, Tony would be able to hear it hitting the ground. His expression was solemn, unconcerned, and his bright blue eyes scanned the occupants room in such a thorough way that Tony felt himself shiver in fear. His hair was dark blond, longer than the brunette’s but shorter than the redhead’s, and with less braids, which allowed it to fall freely and beautifully against his armored shoulders with a grace nobody would expect from a barbarian. He had a full beard, differently from his other male companions whose beards were thinner, and had a pure white fur cape strapped to his shoulders. There was a star in the middle of his chest armor, which was clearly the work of a highly skilled smith if the intricate details in the metal were any indication. It looked sturdy, almost… impenetrable, and Tony couldn’t help but to be impressed. He had heard pagans were nothing but filthy brutes who knew nothing other than to kill and take, but if that was the case… then how were they able to create such amazing pieces? The weapons were just as impressive, after all. Even more than the ones the Stark clan manufactured.
“You don’t need to tell me that,” Tony snapped, turning away from Rogers’ overwhelmingly soft gaze. “And I don’t need your pity, so you can move along and check on the others or whatever.”
When Thanos’ children invaded earth to demand the stones, Steve Rogers had snuck into the country out of a gut feeling, and was there to fight by Tony’s side against Ebony Maw and successfully keep Stephen Strange and the time stone from being abducted. They succeeded because they did it
King Steven eventually scoffed, shaking his head and stepping back, “Enough. I will hear no more excuses. I was expecting the least that was an apology for those whose lives were taken, but you are capable of not even that, Iron King, so we are done here.” He announced, turning around and walking back to his group and giving Tony a clear view of the silver shield strapped to his back—slick, thin, shiny and with the same star shining in the middle. He marveled at the intricate runes carved into the metal and surrounding the star, wondering just who had been the creator of such a masterpiece, but his admiration was short lived, since the next words that came out of the king’s mouth caused Tony’s blood to freeze and his heart to stop, “Burn the place to the ground.”
Natasha rolled her eyes and didn't bother answering, turning on her heels and walking down the elusive corridors that led to his office. Tony ended up sighing and following her as concern sprouted inside his chest. Whatever had happened must have been pretty bad to leave her in such a (worse) foul mood, and Tony was not particularly excited to find out just what kind of headache expected him inside his office.
"And Flash, I'm actually impressed at how assertive you were over there. You know blackmailing is a crime that can land you in jail right?" Tony casually asked, successfully freaking out the kid. "Not to mention this is not the first time I hear of your name causing trouble in my school, where things as bullying and inflicting bodily harm on other students is strictly forbidden."
To say Tony was surprised to see Peter Parker inside his office was an understatement. The kid was one of his brightest students, with an impeccable set of grades and exemplar behavior to match. Never, ever since Parker had been admitted into the Maria Stark's Academy, had he ever been sent to the principal's office for misbehaving, so Tony imagined the patched up broken nose Flash Thompson was sporting had something to do with it.
Not only big, but also thick, which had Tony shivering in anticipation of having the man burying himself inside him. At the beginning, he had plans of topping and allowing Steve to feel all the pleasures sex had to offer since this was his first time, but after laying his eyes on the beauty he was now worshipping with his tongue and hands? There was no argument. He could show Steve Rogers’ the wonders and pains of bottoming another time if this ever came to happen again, but not tonight. Tonight,
. He had been expecting pity. “She decided we needed a break, for me to evaluate what I want for my life, because she wouldn’t live a life with the uncertainty that I might not come back home one day.” He smiled sadly, “And since I can’t… I can’t just…
Mary, for the first time since she had arrived that day, smiled back, and Morgan felt happiness bloom inside her chest. If Mary had defended her, does that mean that they were friends now? Uncle Rhodey was very protective of daddy, and they are the bestest of friends, so if Mary saved her from Duncan’s teasing, then that should mean they were friends now. Maybe
“Apologize.” A familiar voice demanded, surprising both Morgan and Duncan and making them turn towards the source of it. Standing by their side was Mary, and she had a
” She responded and then smirked, finally switching to a heavy accented English, “Disrespect him again, and say goodbye to your head,
Steve faked offense, “Shut up. You know they’d pick their aunt Nat over the both of us in a heartbeat.”
” His playfull thoughts were once again interrupted, prompting Steve to look up from the pan and towards the ceiling.
"There has to be something I can do to repay you, Tony." Steve insisted, and he really loved how his name sounded on the man's beautiful voice. "I can't let you do all of this for me without at least giving you something in exchange."
King Steven scoffed, “I’ll have to refuse. There’s nothing you can offer me that would be suitable to my needs.”
But he never got to answer, since Mary - without any further warning - simply stepped forward and yanked the plushie out of his grasp. He was shocked for a moment, soon scrambling to try and retrieve Mr. Fuzzy, but Mary was having
“At ease, soldier.” Tony placed a palm against Steve’s bare chest and pushed him down towards the bed again, “I’ve done this before, so you don’t have to worry about anything. Just relax and enjoy the ride.”
Steve already looked attractive by default with that symmetric and angelic face and those bright blue eyes, but slap a beard on the picture, and suddenly the man becomes the type of guy Tony would have constant wet dreams about — not that he already didn’t have those involving clean shaven Steve.
So, after picking up his daughter and covering her in kisses while Pepper cried and laughed watching the both of them, Tony focused on fixing himself up and getting his head back in the game. He had a company to earn back, a child to raise, and no matter what Howard said, Tony would
Steve hummed in agreement, coming to a stop next to Tony once they reached the door, "I'll be sure to bring her. Should I look for Mrs. Romanoff again?"
at it. His movements were balanced between intense and comforting in such a masterful way that had Tony falling apart faster than he would have, but that didn’t deter him from asking for more, to which Steve happily obliged, only changing positions and proceeding to make Tony scream his name into the night every time he made himself home.
He might have resented the image of Captain America at some point in his life, but there was no denial that most of his life he idolized the guy and everything he stood for, and right now, said guy was holding him like his life depended on it and was regarding Tony with so much affection and understanding that his knees would have buckled if he wasn’t being held in place.
Steve beamed at him, and Tony praised his own self-control when somehow he didn't jump the man for the third time for the past ten minutes, "I guess I'll see you tomorrow then."
Seeming satisfied with having a taste of Tony’s nipples, Steve continued his path of kisses down to Tony’s stomach, seeming to worship every little spot he burned with his lips. It was torture, in a way, but Tony couldn’t bring himself to complain about it. He didn’t remember the last time someone cared for him like this, with this amount of tenderness and care that easily succeeded to triumph over every other kind of things he ever experienced. Worship kink was never much his thing, but he was having a hard time not liking it when it was being directed
