"Don't tell me you're worried about betraying Tiberius. We both know right now he's probably knot-deep in some limp-wristed twink who’s barely sprouting hair on his balls. Come
“Maybe.”
Tony imagined Steve Rogers' pretty pink blush coloring his face, his neck, and his chest. His nipples going hard at being exposed to the cool air of the exam room. Tony wondered what his tits looked like. His plaid shirt last time hadn't done much to hide his generous chest. Even beneath the boring pattern, his tits looked bountiful, begging for hands to squeeze them, a mouth to suck them.
He left the bathroom and grabbed the radio in his hands, eyeing it curiously. He wondered what he could make using just the parts it held.
"You never told me."
Tony shook his head, “Just goes to show you how good a kid I was. Never heard that.”
Steve exhaled slowly, “Thank God. I was- worried-“
When Jarvis left Tony introduced Steve to the television and offered to show him how it worked. After about 3 minutes of commercials, Steve asked him to shut it off, mumbling, “I don’t think I’m ready for that yet.”
"I'm not-" Tony started to protest but Sharon cut him off.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Meeting Captain America… might be worth being your partner.”
Sharon stared at him and it was as if she was seeing him in a brand new light. Where had her sweet-natured boyfriend gone and when did he turn into this?
Tony swallowed against the sudden lump in his throat, “Right.”
“Big news, sugar pie, honey bunch. You'll never guess who I've been hanging out with this week.”
“Oh wow, you don’t say? No duh, Cinnamon Bun,
Her word against Captain America?
"Since when have I known I was attracted to men, too? Oh… since before the war. Tony isn't the first man I've been with. He knows that. We didn't have a name for it then. If you fucked men you were a fairy, didn't matter if you also enjoyed sex with women."
Steve kept his eyes averted, looking away from Tony in humiliation. His chest heaved and the movement drew Tony’s eyes to Steve’s pretty pink nipples, still hard and absolutely begging for attention. Tony cleared his throat and breathed in, getting a lungful of Steve’s scent.
Steve stared up at him, his mouth hanging open in shock. Tony furrowed his brow in concern.
“... I’m fine.” Steve croaked.
She turned her attention back to Sharon's mother, "Howard's a fool, he doesn't know what a treasure he has in his hands. Reminds me of Steve," she said wistfully, "A diamond in the rough. Tony just needs someone to see the value in him."
Steve stopped walking and turned to look Tony in the face, “You’re… do- ah. Do you-?”
“We can discuss trivialities later! Do you want to meet Captain America or not? Don’t bother lying to me, Criss Cross Applesauce, I’ve seen your comic collection.”
The two men watched Tony on the dance floor, twirling Natasha impressively.
His face, sadly, didn't seem keen on sprouting a mustache any time soon.
“He’ll flip his lid when I tell him.”
Ideal for any Alpha to want to sink their teeth into, especially when fucking their knot deep in Steve Roger’s begging hole.
Steve was staring at the door as if he’d expected someone else to walk in. His shoulders sagged in relief and Tony smothered the urge to tease him. Instead, he shouldered the door closed and hung the shirt behind it. He washed his hands and walked back to Steve’s side.
“If your dad has found Captain America, why isn’t it all over the news? Shouldn’t the President be throwing a parade?”
“That’s a good idea,” Tony murmured, his attention fixated on the idea of Steve Rogers on his exam table, pink-faced and embarrassed about how much slick he was producing, his legs spread and resting in the stirrups.
“Oh– yes! Test results for Ms. Brown, ok - thanks for letting me know, I wanted to look those over before the end of the day.” His MA stepped away and Tony looked back at the counter but the Adonis had already stepped away and was seated in the waiting room.
Keisha’s expression brightened. "Okay, I'll tell Mr. Rogers."
“That’s- debatable and not what I’m interested in arguing about for 3 hours today. Did your dad really find Captain America?”
When Sharon walked into Steve's apartment, intent on surprising him, she hadn't immediately heard anything. It wasn't until she drew closer to his bedroom that she could hear soft music and moaning.
Steve had agreed and left the room for a moment.
Tony shifted uncomfortably. This train of thought seemed to be headed in a familiar but currently unwanted direction.
“Steve…” Tony said finally, turning to meet Steve’s eyes, “It’s been a long time. Please… trust me when I say that you should eat first – get your strength up and then I will answer every question you have.”
The two stared at each other for a long moment before Tony spoke up, the words spoken as though they were carefully chosen, “Are we- sharing dreams?”
Sure enough, Steve visibly recoiled. He gaped at Tony, his wide blue eyes darting around the room as though they were in a crowd of people. He recovered quickly, though, confirming the symptoms. He mentioned that his heats are usually on-time and that his symptoms were out of the ordinary.
The car continued forward.
Bucky laughed then, “No, nah - IED got me during a routine patrol. Lemme tell you, though, that fucking sucked too.”
Reading through it, he understood why Mr. Rogers may have been worried. He wasn't due for a heat, and usually his heats were punctual.
“There’s nothing to be sorry for, Steve. Really. Everyone has different reactions and one response isn’t more valid than another.”
Steve shrugged, easing out from under Howard’s arm, “I- I guess. This is… a lot to take in. Look- I- I don’t want you to feel pressured to do anything, Tony.”
Steve let out a shuddering breath and Tony was pleased to see that his blush went past his throat and colored his chest and no doubt further down where the sheet teasingly covered.
“In Stark Industries?”
Rhodey smiled sheepishly, “Well… admittedly, I can be a bit of a pitbull about it. I really hope I didn’t offend you, Steve.”
A beautiful babe with Tony’s dark hair and Steve’s wide blue eyes. They’d make gorgeous children together and after each pup was born, Steve would ask Tony for help milking his luscious tits so they wouldn’t be so full. And if Tony took a taste for himself - well, he knows Steve wouldn’t mind.
“Yes, Dr. Stark.” Steve whispered as Tony moved closer to him, refusing to break eye-contact. Tony rewarded him with a gentle curve of his lips and lifted his hands to touch Steve’s neck. Tony marveled at the strength beneath the skin and drew his hands down. Beneath him, Steve shuddered, and Tony withdrew his hands.
“Mmhm.” Rhodey knocked his knee against Tony’s and two immediately dissolved into another shoving match.
The figure straightened and hesitated before turning in his chair to face him, “You’re awake.”
Tony's eyes widened. His father told him how they had found Steve trapped in Red Skull’s plane, buried within tons of ice.
“There was a blackout before you arrived and I was going to check the machine. I know it’s unorthodox but would you mind if I stayed in the room while you undressed so I can boot it up and input your info? It’ll save us a lot of time.”
Rhodey lifted an eyebrow and Steve lifted his palms in confusion.
“Listen, if you can’t close your blinds, you’ve really got no one but yourself to blame.”
When Sharon walked in Peggy had happily shown her the article too. "Aren't you proud of him, Sharon, darling? He's like a cousin to you, you know."
Steve jabbed at the waffle on his plate for a moment.
“I’m so sorry.” He whispered and Tony sighed. If only every Omega Tony slept with was so responsive to him.
“Sorry, let me get out of your way, gentlemen.” Tony moved closer to the counter and Carson and Steve Rogers squeezed by him so they wouldn’t bother the older woman.
“I-I’m sorry.” Steve trembled.
Steve garbled out an excuse about being unable to call and Tony waved it away, too distracted by Steve's dripping wet clothes clinging to every inch of him and his proudly pointing nipples.
“Salt in the wound, Hershey Kiss, salt in the wound.”
She'd never heard Steve sound like that before. He was grunting and groaning, his breathing labored. He was the louder of the two. The bed-springs squealed beneath him and his partner.
“Uhh, if you’re bored we could watch some movies here.”
Tony breathed in deep; he could remember the sweet-musk of Steve Rogers scent, taste it on his tongue. Not overpowering but comfortable. Familiar. Like apple pie on a hot summer day, the scent of honeysuckle in the air. Fireworks exploding overhead.
Steve sat in his easy chair, facing her, "What's up, Share? You wanted to talk."
Jarvis chuckled, “And Master Tony?”
"No." Steve sighed and leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees, "Tony and I have been together since… oh, a few months after I came out of the ice. I was lonely and stranded in a strange new world and he saved me. He gave me a home. I fell for him quick and he returned my feelings."

Sorry it's taking me a while. I'm fighting writers block but hopefully the next chapter won't come so slowly. Hope y'all enjoy, tell me what you think!
“Sure. Sweet Mrs. Silverstein - she was from England - she would take care of me while my mom worked and my brother was in school. She taught me how to knit and we listened to records. Later on when I was old enough to stay alone she gave me a record player for my birthday. It was real swell. I made her a pair of mittens as a thank you.” Steve explained as they trooped to the town car.
“One of those things is not like the other. Tony! I am still so so hesitant to believe you.”
Tony giggled and then moaned softly, "Oh, that's good. I like that. Mm, Steve. Okay, okay, I'll give her that. She has better tits than me. But be honest, I give way better head. No one sucks dick like me."
Doctors examining him soon realized he was in a state of suspended animation.
Sharon struggled for a moment to find her next words. "You're not gay."
DUM-E, Sharon remembered.
“What if, instead, we don’t talk about that?”
Tony made a pleased sound before flashing Steve a wicked smile, “Then please imagine how good I’m going to look tonight when you take off my tux and see the lace I’m wearing underneath.”
Laughter, breathless and delighted. "You're so voracious today, Cap. Am I not putting out enough for you?"
"Sure." Steve shrugged, "Maybe some folks would even believe you. 'Captain America's ex-girlfriend, Shield secret agent tells all!'"
“No! I did that
"Then you and Tony are, what? Just going to keep fucking? What about… us?"
“He did.”

The truth washed over her like ice cold water: her straight arrow, plain vanilla boyfriend was in bed with someone else.
news though to wake me up, calling at
He studied her, her words unable to push past her lips, and he uttered a soft sigh.
Tony could have his friendship but never his heart. Or so Sharon had believed.
“Do you think you could call me Steve? I don’t… all the titles and Masters… I don’t really like it.”
Steve laughed, causing the two to stop.
“Who’s there?” he said in a sleep-roughened voice.
to be his friend.
Tony grinned, taking another gulp.
Steve gave him a questioning look and Tony explained what the Yellow Pages were.
Steve nodded, staring down at his hands, “Ice shifts. Temperatures rise and it starts to melt, sun beats down… temperatures drop and it solidifies. It moves. I never knew that until I was-
"Since when?"
“Kind of…?” Steve laid his head back down and curled his fingers over the edge of the table.
Steve glanced at Tony but stood, “I'm ready if you all are.”
“I will?” Tony frowned, “But you said that I’d be starting at Stark Industries in R-and-D…”
Tony paused, “Still, it's not like I'm saying you have to go anywhere
At six the local news began playing and Tony began pacing. Overhead, the storm that had been threatening all day finally broke and the rain was coming down in sheets, drumming on the windows of the clinic.
"There's the Rumiko I know. It's been a real treat hearing from you. Do me a favor and lose my number, hm?" He hung up as she continued her hissing, spitting vitriol. Tony stared at his phone, half expecting it to ring again. He considered the repercussions of blocking Rumiko, yet again. He'd done it before and even changed his own number but she'd always found him and coaxed him back into being quote-unquote
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony slid off the stool and stumbled over a pair of shoes on his way to the door, yelping when he managed to step on his own toe, “Ow- ow- I’m awake. I’m up, what’s up? What’s wrong?”
Tony spent his car-ride home imagining meeting Steve at a coffee shop. Asking him to dinner. Seeing his cheeks go pink, his perfect pink lips parted to speak.
Steve returned the smile.
“You got it, Dr. Stark.” She nodded, smiling. Tony gave her a grateful grin.
“He had some concerns about the veil.”
One wrong move and Steve may have been hesitant enough to run but from the outraged look on his face, Tony didn’t think Steve was thinking about anything other than the orgasm that was denied to him.
“Uh, yeah, of course. I'll grab two blankets.”
Steve shook his head, looking pole-axed, “Not exactly.” Steve’s voice slightly cracked, “It just felt weird.”
Though, Tony could be lazy about a great many things. Selfish. Tony’s relationship - or lack thereof – with his father would also help sculpt him into a man much like alcoholic, pleasure-seeking Howard.
Steve smiled then, “I never thought I’d meet anyone who could out-talk Howard Stark. He’s very interesting, I almost can’t believe he’s only nineteen.”
“You're right, I never will. Can we skip the guessing game and just go to the part where you tell me and I act aloof but am secretly impressed?”
“It was Tony’s idea. He said, and I quote, ‘I’m wearing my Ironman suit and a veil during the ceremony. It’s my goddamn wedding and I’ll wear whatever the hell I want to wear.’” Steve assured Rhodey.
“Uncle Sam?”
They were both stubborn as mules. They were both generous to a fault and always willing to do the right thing – even if it seemed like a bad idea at the time.
“Ah.” It wasn’t uncommon, Tony had had two or three omega patients like that. It happened.
Steve nodded, “I can believe that.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony pushed back his chair from the table and left the room, his hair still standing in an impressive act of defying gravity.
“He’s listening to CDs on a Walkman, he can’t hear me.”
“You really shouldn’t worry so much, Steve. As far as embarrassing behavior goes, you’re not even in the running for first place.” Tony chatted amiably as he watched Steve’s nipples impressively harden even more.
Sharon shivered, "That's not what I asked. Why- why did you have sex with me and- we were talking about moving in together."
“No, I’m not- really sure. Dad is on the board for some other companies. I think one of them is like… security or law enforcement? They've mentioned it a couple of times but mostly keep quiet around me. Shield.”
“Do you think you could stay?”
. Then he and my mother- they- got me… 19 years ago. Steve- Cap- Captain… you’ve been asleep for… a really long time.”
Tony didn’t know how to respond to that.
Steve gave another low whistle at the sight of the Stark’s home, chuckling with embarrassment when he realized what he’d done.
Tony had years of learning to control his face to keep from loudly displaying his emotions - a useful skill as a doctor especially when one had to deal with a litany of different issues that many would consider gross. Steve Rogers did not have this skill, it seemed.
Tony set down his things, calling back, "Steve Rogers?"
The Stark’s New York penthouse was situated in one of the greener areas of the city, overlooking Central Park from the top floor of a high-rise. It would show a beautiful sunset later, Tony assured Steve.
“You’ve had me watch how many movies this week?”
Comment, kudos please! :)
"Mmhm, that's why you dumped me for him."
Tony shrugged, “Anytime I fall asleep during a movie I end up dreaming I’m in it.”
“Aside from that, how are you feeling?”
Steve sighed and angled his head to deepen the kiss.
Tony had to fight the grin threatening to split his face.
After all, there was only one
At seeing Tony the man's face cycled through several emotions: shock, unease, and something like desire among them. He went pink and his voice caught in his throat, issuing a soft noise that he probably wasn't even aware he'd made.
Peggy had smiled, "Yes, I suppose you're right. He certainly needs more than the pittance of attention his parents give him."
"I do like your tits. Hers are nicer."
“You know Steve, I practically had to google Tony Stark and show him his wikipedia page before he knew who he was.”
Tenderness in his lower abdomen, leaking slick, hot flashes.
“You’re not gonna send me to the loony bin, are you?” Steve asked lightly but Tony could see the very real worry in his eyes.
“Jarvis, pull the car over, we’re kicking Steve and Rhodey out.”
, I don't want details but- what? You two are always butting heads- how did it go from that to… to that night?"
Tony blinked at Steve over the rim of a mug of coffee.
Tony had changed out of the suit after the ceremony and now he wore a black tux with a red vest. The only gold on him was his wedding ring which seemed to catch the light as he danced. On his head was a white veil, pushed back out of his face.
She looked down at the patient log. “Uhh- Steve Rogers is scheduled to see Dr. Edwards today.”
Steve would probably come immediately. He’d probably cry and beg for mercy. Plead for more. Tony wondered just how many times he could get Steve to come just by playing with and sucking his nipples.
“Thank you.” Steve murmured, “Your offer sounds great, Howard. If I decide to accept, I’d be more than happy to have Tony help me out but only if he’s willing.”
“Mostly sarcasm.”
our images, whatever that is."
Tony wondered what Steve liked to do. What kind of activities Steve might enjoy that Tony could happen to meet him at. Like, a movie theater or a bookstore. Steve Rogers looked like he enjoyed quieter activities. A gym, Tony snapped his fingers, Steve Rogers definitely worked out.
“Do you just think I’m an awful person or is someone whispering in your ear about me?”
, Tony, stop being such a bitch and come
thing or is that something I can expect from a lot of men I meet?”
He moved to the end of the exam table and began pulling the stirrups up from their hidden position. As he began adjusting them into place he heard Steve suck in a shuddering gasp.
“No… it’s- it’s been longer than that.”
“Tony, what are you telling me? You've got some poor guy in a Cap costume? What have I told you about hiring people in costumes to hang out?”
Steve didn't flinch, "I'm willing to do what's best for Tony and I
would speak of him.
“Of course, Dad never shuts up about you.”
She didn't even have proof. Her word against theirs and when it came down to it,  she hadn't even
Steve gave him a strange smile, “I’m uh- I’m only kidding.”
“Rogers.” Tony said to the receptionist, “Is that patient one of mine?”
"I’m not insulting you, Tony, I’m calling you a liar. Anyway, Ty's out of town for the weekend and I’m bored and horny. Want to come over and try to break our record for number of times you can knot me in a night?"
Sharon remembered seeing a Life magazine spread on Tony when he was a young teenager in college. There were glossy photos of Tony, grinning and standing beside his robot.
God, he was gorgeous.
There were times when Tony theorized that Howard had been in love with the man, but he’d seen the way his father flirted with women. He never even glanced at other men.
You can't seriously expect me to believe that." Sharon laughed humorlessly, "It must kill you that so many people want Steve and I to get back together but no one even
20 minutes later Tony fell asleep to the combined sounds of the movie and Steve’s deep even breathing.
“Steve.” Tony pushed down, keeping the man under him pinned down. “Steve,” He repeated, returning to his soothing doctor tone, “It’s okay. It’s
Sharon didn't reply. She refused to surrender the elevator and leave but she didn't have to make nice with Tony either.
“Give me your phone and I’ll type my number in.”
Steve felt a chill crawl down his spine at the drawn-out silence, “Weeks?”
for updating
“You two remind me of me and my best friend.” Steve’s smile flagged a little, “Wish you could’ve met him. Buck-”
Howard merely nodded before leading the two young men out of the room and into the empty space beyond, “Steve,” He started, his voice echoing, “The world has changed so much in just 46 years. It’s unbelievable the leaps we’ve taken in technology and science. I realize that to you, yesterday was 1945 and you were a soldier in a great war. That war’s been long over and the vast majority of people would be hard-pressed to remember anything beyond a few key dates of significant battles.”
“It better be
Tony could imagine it. Steve Rogers on his table–legs parted, secure in the stirrups. He could practically smell his excessive slick leaking out of his hole, pooling on the table and dripping off onto the floor.
He held his hand out and Steve reached to take it. They shook - firm handshakes on either side.
Cold realization dawned on her. "You used me."
"I know, I know, it sounds odd but biology can be very powerful and occasionally, the body wants something without any input from the brain." He watched Steve taking in the information, slowly coming to a realization.
“I thought Captain America was always honest?”
Sharon rolled her eyes but kept quiet.
Before long it was 5:30 and the cleaning crew was finishing up. Keisha waited until they left and took her leave behind them, wishing Tony a good night.
“Let me… let me take some time to think about things, Howard. I… yesterday was 1945. I was- there was-“ He cleared his throat, “Do- do you think I could try to get in touch with Peggy?”
“I realize this could be overwhelming.” Howard murmured, “But you’re in luck, my boy.”
Maintaining his unaffected but kindly doctor’s tone, Tony told Steve about infamous patients he’d heard of or had in the past. One man belonged to a colleague and he would mewl whenever the doctor would insert or remove the speculum.
"Going down?" Tony smiled as he spoke and stepped in.
“Yeah, that’s fine. I don’t mind.” Tony beamed at him and Steve gave him a tremulous smile in return before dropping his chin and raising his hands to undo his shirt buttons. He froze and stared down at his chest.
“Bucky was a better alternative?” Tony chuckled and received another elbow jab from Rhodey.
"Who gives a shit? He's not here to do the job, fuck him. Besides he's not dumb enough to believe I'm gonna sit around for
Tony stretched.
Tony immediately thought of Rhodey, “Well, I’ll just have to make sure he and Steve are never in the same room together! Or you. Especially you. I can’t imagine how terrifying seeing you and Rhodey working together would be.”
No matter what sort of trouble he caused, there were always people willing to run to his defense. Her Aunt Peggy included.
Tony took the opportunity to follow his gaze and get another look at Steve’s prettily begging nipples. They practically demanded Tony’s attention.
Tony placed the first two fingers of his hands below Steve’s nipples and his thumbs above and, staying on the areola, began rubbing and squeezing.
“Everyone’s against me.” Tony whined.
“So you box?”
Steve gave the younger man a wan smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes, “Finally? You know about me?”
“So no rocket launchers, got it. What other kind of extras are available?”
Tony couldn’t help but note that, according to those stories, he and Captain America held a few similarities. They both held a rebellious streak a mile wide.
“Uh oh,” Tony said, “someone pee on you again?” Dr. Edwards and his assistant both laughed, exchanging a knowing look between them.
“I can’t believe I’m saying this but you’d better be outside my window and not have installed a camera in my room like you keep threatening to do.”
“James ‘Sugar Baby’ Rhodes, I am telling you. Howard Stark’s team has found Captain America and he’s alive, well and kind of hot.”
“But Rhodey, think of the money I could make!”
“Good communicators though.” Steve was sitting up, elbows on his knees as he listened intently. Tony snorted.
“Of course I’m listening, Professor. What kind of jackass do you take me for?” He snapped, flinging himself from the puddle of drool on his desk and nearly toppling off his stool. He steadied himself and blinked at the blindingly bright light of his desk lamp.
Rhodey gestured to Tony, looking to Steve, “Have you ever met anyone who can stay awake as long as he does? Either he’s part robot or he’s got major brain damage by now.”
“Yes, thank you. I’m fine.” Steve’s face burned red, his hands still hanging in the air as he tried to figure out what his next move should be. Just then the air conditioner kicked on as if to mock him and Steve physically flinched.
. You’re an actor for
“You guys sure I shouldn’t go home?”
“Thanks, J. Oh, Steve. I can't tell you how excited I am to be the one to introduce you to junk food.”
“I’m sorry, you’ve got to be freezing. You don’t have to take the scrubs but you might consider removing your shirt. You’ll never warm up in that wet shirt. I’d raise the temperature for you, but the thermostat is locked thanks to the infamous summer of 2018.”
Tony tugged more, the pads of his fingers pressed into the warm soft skin of Steve’s areolas. He pushed in gently and plucked at the flesh. Tug, tug,
The two men exited the office and Steve graciously waited while Tony locked the door behind him. They walked together, following Nat and Bucky who were far out of earshot.
The man was staring down at his lap.
"Gotta say, you're doing a shit job of convincing me here, Ru." Tony's finger hovered over the disconnect button, "sorry, I'm wiped from work. Not gonna happen."
Jarvis knocked then and entered, bringing along a rolling cart piled high with all kinds of edibles.
Thanks to Cheer Readers from the Put On the Suit discord:
“Tony mentioned you met Howard in the war.”
Tony figured his father must have stepped out for a moment and turned back to Steve’s door.
“Oh, okay, then I’ll just tell Stevie don’t bother coming over.” Bucky pulled his phone from his back pocket.
Tony swallowed hard. Despite the bad blood between them, Rumiko’s offer was tempting thanks to all his fantasizing about Steve Rogers. It would feel amazing to get his knot deep in someone right now. But he and Rumiko hadn't been together in months–not since he turned down her father's offer to set him up in a private clinic with wealthy and celebrity patients, and Ru dumped him. Within days he heard she was with Tiberius Stone–his on-again-off-again friend and once upon a deeply misguided time, his fuck-buddy.
“Let me try one last thing and then we can move on.” Tony barely allowed the warning to leave his lips before moving to Steve’s hardened nipples. He rolled them between his fingers and to his great delight, Steve uttered a bone-deep moan. The omega attempted to catch it behind his hand but was far too late and the sound filled the exam room.
“No. Look, that… kind of stuff happened in the 40s too - I was in the Army. Not a whole bunch of women around and guys got lonely. Wasn’t something you talked about in polite company but it was what it was. It’s just- strange to see it so out in the open. Movies, general conversation.
Jarvis shifted in his seat, “Well,” He took a deep breath, “Exercise is a good start. Physical health can often make quite an impact on one’s mental health. Professional help would not be amiss. After my wife was… gravely injured, I was deeply affected. Master Stark- the agency he is a part of, Shield - they employ a good many doctors. I’m sure they have one who could talk with you, especially considering your circumstances.”
Steve grinned, “Moms were like that in the 40s too. Nothin’ sent a chill up my spine like hearing ‘
Steve’s voice caught as he spoke.
Tony bit his lip to keep from smiling. He could smell the fresh slick Steve released.
Steve and Rhodey burst into laughter as Tony groaned, “Jarvis, how could you?
Steve flipped the page of his pad and wrote down one word.
Her Aunt Peggy had been reading the article to Sharon's mother and exclaiming about his successes. "He is going to do great things, I know it. He's going to change the world."
“Does he know and approve of your brand of wingmanning?”
Tony sat back in his chair, “Well… I'm telling you there's nothing wrong with seeking help now. There are some mental health facilities around but nothing like that.”
Tony snorted, “What’d he say?”
Had he always been like this? She'd always known Steve to be good-natured and friendly, even something of a goofball beneath the cowl. Was he that good of an actor that he could hide such a cold and calculating demeanor from her?
Tony cleared his throat, “Come- come in.”
Steve sighed, "Tony thought it would be easier to keep up appearances if I had a steady girlfriend and he maintained his playboy lifestyle. You're beautiful and together we make a very lovely couple. Exactly what the media wants to see from me."
Steve nodded, “Sleepovers? Sure.”
“Forty-six. It’s been forty-six years.” Tony admitted. “The year is 1991.”
“Enough of that.” He murmured to himself.
A normal-looking ceiling except things were a bit blurry. Not normal but then the last thing Steve could remember was sitting in a plane that crashed into ice and snow. So it made some sense that he may have been asleep for a longer-than-normal amount of time and that would affect his sight.
Tony heard a pause in Howard’s excitement.
“Tony.” he said after a moment and released Tony’s wrist, “Sorry.”
That, Tony knew, he could fix.
Sharon rushed from the apartment, not caring whether or not they heard her departure. She didn't think they had. Their cries of mutual satisfaction and completion chased her out the door.
Tony laughed in a short huff, “Can’t be bad, Jarvis wouldn't have been smiling. He’s probably just nervous.”
Tony barked a laugh, and Rhodey snorted, “I have no idea. A wrestler? I'm sure there are plenty who wear the American flag on their little shorts.”
Steve rubbed his face with one hand as he fully sat up, “Stark? Where am I? I was in the plane- the Red Skull’s plane and I had to bring it down before it hit-“
Everything was actually
“I would wake up sometimes. In the ice.”
Steve looked up at him, startled out of his ruminating, “Oh- jeez, Tony, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t talk about this. No one wants to hear-”
But then, Sharon realized, she could hear the bed-springs creaking. Could it have been the porn? The noise was loud.
"You'd still date me… you're still willing to have sex with me just to keep people from knowing that you prefer fucking Tony?" Sharon scoffed, "How much can you really love him if you can't even be honest about who you really are?"
“So I’ve been told.”
Jarvis retrieved a bulky mobile phone from his coat pocket, “Excuse me, gentlemen. Mr. Stark only calls for emergencies.”
Steve shook his head, too, “Confusing. Regardless, I liked him. Batman was depressing and Superman was a little too perfect.”
Steve lifted his head then and looked at Tony, eyebrows knitted together in confusion, “Why?”
Steve looked up at him, silent and expressionless.
"Hello?"
“I know… but it's only been a week. Can’t I hold his hand a little longer?”
Tony ignored the mumbled complaints and grabbed the phone, nearly yanking it free from the wall-mount, “Dad? Dad, what’s wrong?”
The man laughed, brightly, “Oh, I like you. Damn… no fair. Why can’t you really exist?”
Below him, Steve panted and squirmed on the exam table. Tony fought to keep the grin off his face, doubting that Steve was even hearing a word he was saying. “There was even another patient who used to urinate during an exam. I mean, once can be excused but twice and then three times in a row?” Tony chuckled softly.
“We’ve discussed boundaries before. I know we have.”
"You're such a sweet talker, Steve. That how you talked Sharon into bed?"
Steve nodded slowly.
Tony didn’t think he looked nearly enough like Howard to fool anyone, let alone a super-soldier with perfect eyesight. He wondered just how angry the Captain would be once he realized the deception.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about. I’m innocent as a lamb.”
“I’m sorry.” Tony said, his tone impassive despite his racing thoughts, “I’m going to have to touch them again.”
“A helper.”
Tony grinned, “What kind of extras are you looking for?”
The three men stood, unmoving, for a few moments before Steve broke the silence. “Forty-six years, Howard? Is- is Peggy still-?”
How many mutants and people with powers had she personally met that could do exactly that?
“Don’t kid yourself, Rhodes, you’d replace me the second you got a chance.”
Tony raised both hands and shifted them in the air, palms up, as if he were weighing both, “Little from column a, little from column b. You’re not gonna flip out if a guy says you’ve got a nice ass, are you?”
“You said it helped to hear the movie while you slept? I can turn it on again.”
Steve took a deep breath, "Sharon, I am sorry. I should never have allowed this to go so far. It was never my intention to hurt you-"
“I’m assuming you’re both in the car. Did you call Captain America hot in front of him? Is he confused about that? Does he think you’re saying he’s overly warm?”
“Forty-six years…” Steve breathed out, putting his head in his hands, “You’re lying. You’ve got to be lying. …
Howard frowned, looking anywhere but Steve’s eyes, “… I suppose that’s up to her. She’s been notified that you’ve been found. She… she hasn’t sent word back yet.”
“What the hell?” He glanced around for a moment. Steve’s room was built into an old building that Howard had bought in Brooklyn. It was cavernous on Steve’s floor to reduce any noise but the other floors were residences.
“Oops, nevermind. Time for damage control, get your butt out here, Rhodes!”
Tony grinned at the other man, his husband. He held out his hands, “May I have this dance?”
“Yeah, Dad. This is… great. Amazing. I’ll put clothes on. Throw some stuff in a bag. Yeah… uh- just… I’ll be waiting for the taxi. Tell him to honk once so he doesn’t wake the dorm… uhm-“
"Go so far? What happened? No- I don't want to know what
“Oh, I rode him about Bucky all the time. I thought James was a perfectly good name - better than Steve anyway and here he was goin’ around tellin’ everyone, ‘Call me Bucky!’” Steve laughed again, his Brooklyn accent slipping through.
Thank
Jarvis had already been up and was in the process of making breakfast when the two arrived in the kitchen.
“That’s even more incriminating!” Steve put his hands on his hips, “Howard doesn’t have a kid – he’s not even married!”
“That’s–that’s never happened to me before.” Steve looked down at his own chest as if to make sure Tony wasn’t still touching him.
“Fuck, yes. Please.”
“Yes, Steve. Is there something I can help with?”
The wrench he’d been clutching slipped out of his grasp and clattered loudly onto his desk.
She wondered that as she texted him several days after her discovery, asking if he was free and available to talk.
Steve’s eyes grew huge as his thighs clamped together and he bit his lip between his teeth. His whole body flushed red. It was truly beautiful to see.
“I think Jim Rhodes thinks I’m terrible and or one of George Washington’s generals.”
"Hi, beautiful,” Tony ground the heel of his hand to his eyes, too tired to ignore the call and face her wrath later. Better to get it over with now. “To what do I owe the pleasure?"
Steve coolly met her gaze, "I suppose that's up to you, Sharon. Tony and I aren't just fucking. We're in love but it still isn't a good time for us to come out. If you're willing to keep dating me, I'm amicable to that. It's up to you, though."
“I'm sure it's fine, Tony.” Steve murmured.
When they reached the penthouse, Jarvis led the young men into the sitting room where Howard sat facing a woman with dark hair, sprinkled with elegant-looking grays.
Steve turned and looked at the other man, his gaze clear and searching and Tony felt as though his stomach flip-flopped.
There is more to come. But by all means, please continue to send comments! They give me strength!
Maybe it was the lack of ongoing noise that finally pulled him from his sleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can hear you.” Steve called out.
“There’s a condition, a pretty serious one, actually. It causes omegas to falsely lactate. If we catch it early, it’s not a problem but if we don’t…” Tony trailed off, keeping his eyes trained on Steve's reaction. “I think the best course of action would be for me to massage your breasts and nipples to see if you secrete any fluid. Considering how sensitive you seem to be, it may hurt a little but I highly recommend you allow me to try.”
Steve inhaled deeply and pushed himself up, catching sight of a dark-haired figure hunched over a desk.
“Scrub faster, Tony. I brought you breakfast. I even brought coffee.”
," she said the last word in a mocking tone. "You think you've changed just 'cause your patients are poor and ugly, but you're still the same rat bastard who fucked all those Maxim models behind my back, Tony Stark, you haven't changed a bit and you never will."
“The hell? At least let me put on a nice outfit.”
“I’d hardly call six comics a collection.”
He drank down a glass of water before he spoke again, “How… how do I deal with it?”
“Real swell.” Tony repeated, “Also, write down Alien. That’s a good one. It’s real swell.”
6:10 and nothing. No Steve Rogers, no calls. Silence but for the anchor on the TV reporting an accident on the freeway that was causing long delays for drivers headed home and the rumble of thunder in the skies above.
Sharon had wondered what it was about Tony that drew people to him so strongly.
“We’ve gotta stop meeting like this.”
Tony couldn’t help but feel a little intimidated by the man sleeping soundly in the bed sitting in the room attached to the bathroom he currently stood in. Even sleeping and stretched out Steve Rogers struck an imposing figure.
"Sure. Want to come over?"
He’d been saying something but still in a fog of sleep and then startled into consciousness, Tony hadn’t understood anything.
“What can I say? Serving together causes you to form a bond. Like uhm, Stockholm syndrome.”
look like you’re a teenager.”
Sharon sat on his couch, not bothering to remove her coat.
“Now I’m gonna be nervous every time I hear a car door outside, it’s the FBI come to arrest me for knowing government secrets.”
“Excuse us, Dr. Stark.” Tony smiled brightly at the two men, making sure to aim his charms directly at Steve Rogers who blinked owlishly at him.
“He’s fine, Tony! He hasn’t aged a goddamn fucking day and isn’t that just his luck? Tony, I need you here – he needs to feel comfortable when he wakes up- we’ve got to ease him into this-“
“I'll get you a blanket,” the younger man said around another yawn.
"Sounds like shit. What a surprise! I told you working for that clinic would be garbage. They allow in
," Rumiko elongated the last syllable, her voice going plaintive and sweet, "I miss you, baby. I miss your big fat knot deep inside my pussy. You hit all the right spots. I get so wet remembering your perfect knot and how you taste. You know you're a much better lover than Ty."
“Just about, I had a question about this section.” Tony swallowed hard. Even his voice was sexy.
Tony surged forward, his hand out to shake Steve's, "It's alright. I heard about the accident on the freeway and assumed you were stuck in it. I'm Tony Stark, by the way, I'll be standing in for Dr. Edwards."
psst more comments! more! i crave them
Steve worked with several women in both Shield and as an Avenger.
He stepped away from the exam table and subtly adjusted his own erection; a reminder of how careful he needed to be.
Rhodey groaned, “Fine fine.”
Steve seemed uncomfortable.
After dinner, which included another round of Howard deflecting questions about one Agent Carter, they took Steve to their New York penthouse. Howard disappeared into his study, explaining he had more calls to make.
"We all do what we have to," he'd told her once when she brought up their varied schedules and asked if it bothered him.
Tony climbed out of his car, furious at how quickly his ex had been able to rile him up. He was different than the man he was months ago– a cheating, lying, drinking dipshit. Being around Rumiko and Ty was like sitting next to radioactive waste– sooner or later their poison would infect you and everything else nearby. He had cut off most communication with them and felt better for it. Still, as Tony stepped into the elevator headed to his floor, he couldn't help but hear Rumiko's words on repeat:
“Remind me to bring a change of clothes next time he comes in.” Dr. Edwards was packing up for the day and was chuckling about something with his assistant.
“Yes–you too, Dr. Edwards.” Tony gathered his things and checked around the clinic to make sure no one else was lagging behind. As the newest doctor to have joined the practice, he was entrusted with closing up shop at the end of the day and locking everything. He shut off the lights and locked the door, contemplating the chances of meeting Steve Rogers outside of the clinic as he walked to his car.
“Who could ever understand what it’s like to die in 1945 and wake up in 1991?”
"Right, no problem. Steve Rogers is the name? Got it. Keisha, he's still on the phone? You can tell him if he's willing, I'll see him at six o'clock."
Howard reached forward and clasped both men’s shoulders, a pleased look on his face.
Rumiko had never been so wet for him. Steve Roger’s reactions to him were so thrilling Tony was having trouble hiding his own growing erection.
Imagine that. The Steve Rogers. Captain America, himself, was interested in
Tony shaved his chin of the few hairs that were sprouting into what, he had hoped, would have been a respectable beard. Judging by the look his father cast his way when he arrived, however Tony was forced to assume the beard was a failure.
Alpha Dr. Tony Stark continues his thorough examination of omega, Steve Rogers.
. A good one- you’ve got his speech patterns down pat.”
Steve watched as a young black man slid into the car, his shirt different from the one he’d been wearing before.
The sweet little nubs were probably hard as pebbles. With how swollen his areolas were getting from Tony’s massage, it would be such a delight to bend down and draw the man’s nipple into his mouth and suck
She was always working. Always stopping by for a few hours before she was off on yet another mission.
Tony cleared his throat, “Something like that. Give me just a minute, okay?”
– was comfortable when he awoke. It was only a matter of time now. He had to believe, until they could ease him into the 1990s, that he was still in 1945, give or take a few years.
“Not at all. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to dance with my husband.” The two men shook hands before Steve stepped onto the dance floor and the couples seemed to part before him.
Tony smiled tremulously, “That's rare to hear.” he swallowed against a sudden lump in his throat, “Listen, I hope I'm not being annoying- you sure you don’t want to rest instead…?”
“You are no fun. One guess.”
Tony froze at the sound of the voice coming from the waiting room, the vortex of his frustrated and dark thoughts suddenly stopping.
"Tell me the truth, Cap. You like her body more than mine, don't you?"
“If you’re sure.” Tony chanced another glance at Steve’s chest.
Tony turned his head to meet Steve’s eyes and gently began milking his chest.
career is a casualty. Think about what's best for you, Sharon. Do you really want to go up against me
Steve made the sweetest sound— confused, frustrated. He sounded like he was on the verge of tears. Tony bit the inside of his cheek to keep from reacting.
It was more likely that
about you and Steve. You've got him twisted around your finger and you can't even crow it from the rooftop like I know you want to."
Steve quirked his lips up into a brief smile, “Who knows, maybe I’m supposed to be here.” he sighed, “Still, I shouldn’t have dumped that on you.”
“You seem troubled, Captain Rogers.”
Tony only smiled, “No worries, Steve, it's kind of fun watching your reactions. Kind of like a puppy.”
“Are we in a hospital?”
“It’s been a long-“
“Stevie’s talked about you to our friends.”
A voice was murmuring softly nearby.
“Can’t say I’m surprised.”
Tony smiled reassuringly at Steve. “Alright, here we go.” He finally got to fully palm Steve Roger’s gorgeous tits.
Steve gave a long-suffering sigh, "Well, if you want the truth, Tony. She does have nicer tits than you."
” He glared into the room, noting the bright lights, “Doesn’t look like you were sleeping much though.”
“I read the entire dossier you prepared for me - I know folks are, generally, more open about-” Steve ducked his head, “Sexuality and alternative lifestyles.”
Tony nodded as she turned away, then walked to his own office.
After a few moments the door opened and Bucky Barnes walked in, alone.
that Howard had been searching for, long before Tony was born.
“Ah.”
"You never even made it onto the racetrack."
“It’s me, Steve.” Tony said, proud at how calm he sounded, “Howard Stark.”
made the mistake, Tony. Not me!" She snapped, losing the cloying voice, "you should've just taken the job Daddy offered but
Pushing it open, he stepped in quickly and found Steve standing at the window, looking out.
The smell of fresh slick wafted from beneath Steve’s sheet.
Tony leaned in, keeping his voice low and soothing, "Good. Very good."
Tony audibly groaned. He couldn't just sit around fantasizing about his patient. Well, a patient. Either way, it was wrong.
Tony had recently shown him the latest mobile phone, a Mobira Cityman 900,
“Gotcha, sorry, thought I recognized the name on my schedule. Has my next arrived?”
There were several tense minutes of confusion and panic before Steve seemed to come to his senses.
Bucky brightened at the sight of the lovely redhead. She carried with her a bag of takeout boxes and the smell of food.
"My ass is nicer, too."
“No-”
"Can't argue that."
Steve was silent for a long time. Tony shifted uneasily, wondering if he should say something. Staying quiet was not something he did well.
“It’s just that you were born in like, 1872.”
Howard led the two men to one end of the space where several windows looked out onto New York City’s Times Square.
“Maybe not.”
Tony worried the man would not take the news well.
“He wasn’t married in 1945, you’re right. He is
He’d been there for 5 days now, sleeping on a couch close to the bed. He took breaks once a day to shower and shave. He took his meals by the Captain’s side and read books and newspapers from the 40s. When he needed a break from those, he listened to a radio that somehow only played music from the 40s and 50s.
“Was it painful?”
“Guessing mental health wasn’t something people talked about in the 40s.”
“So the nicknames - that’s all Tony.”
Finally Steve spoke, “You sound exactly like him. I mean… the way you talk. Your voice is… Is- is Howard alive? … is Peggy?”
“Neither are most of the people who go to psychiatrists. Though, I suppose in my case, it depends on who you ask.” Tony smirked, “
Tony walked towards the waiting room and turned the corner to see him.
went, at first, because dear ole Dad thought it might help my- well… Dad and I have a less-than-stellar relationship...”
He’d been having the nicest dream about a gorgeous blond Adonis who seemed to like science.
Tony couldn’t help the huge smile that blossomed on his face, “For what it's worth, I'm glad you're here too, Steve.”
"I'd appreciate it, Anthony. It's imperative I leave early today. I will send you his file. I'm not too greatly concerned - he seems to be in the best of health however, he is showing symptoms that are quite out of the norm." Dr. Edwards patted Tony's back as he passed him on his way back to his office.
“Aide.”
She bit her lip and wondered what he was watching. Whoever was moaning was giving it their best pornstar rendition.
With no time to think too hard about what he’d do with Steve’s briefs, Tony grabbed a hanger from behind his door, and after rubbing Steve’s shirt on his own mating gland a few times and across his chest, he hung the shirt and returned to Steve’s room.
“I was actually going to skip the chest exam but your nipples look swollen. Do you mind?” Steve squeezed his eyes shut and squirmed on the table for a moment.
Steve stared at him for a long time before slowly nodding.
"Get over yourself, Tony. The act is old. Steve chose you. Not that anyone will ever know but congratulations," she raised her hands and gave him a slow clap, "You stole Steve's heart. You won."
, I asked Dad if it’d be okay to introduce you as a helper to me.”
“All set then?” Tony moved to the sink to wash up. “Now then, according to your chart you just had your semi-annual exam a few weeks ago but we’re gonna go ahead and make sure nothing’s changed, alright?”
Steve looked away, “Not in polite company.”
The sound was like music to his ears. Tony wanted to hear it again and again.
Tony turned down the lights and snuggled under his blanket.
Tony hung up the carphone, “How much of that did you hear and or understand?”
He thought about the symptoms Mr. Rogers was concerned about.
“Nice one, Friday.” Tony murmured and Steve smiled against Tony’s shoulder.
Behind him, Tony heard another medical assistant talking to a patient, “Just this way Mrs. Mendez, that’s fine.” He looked back to see her leading an older woman on a walker.
“Oh, definitely.” Rhodey agreed, “Takes some getting used to but it comes from a place of love. Or whatever his android heart manufactures.”
It was months before she found herself standing in an elevator at Shield Headquarters, face to face with Tony Stark.
"Thanks for the offer but I'm gonna have to decline."
. Ste-
Did Steve Rogers stand him up?
“It was Dad’s idea!”
waiting for his disappointing knot." Tony sighed inwardly.
“You should talk to someone though. You can talk to me, I- uh, I didn’t mean to freak out. But maybe a professional?”
"You and Tony. Has- has this been going on for long?"
Steve looked down at his hands, "No one would look twice at Tony and I spending so much time together if they thought I had a beautiful girlfriend on my arm. It helped too that you're so… career oriented. That made it easier for us."
“Howard Stark is 3 years older than me.” Steve said, “
"You just get home to your kids and don't worry about it."
He tossed and turned and when he finally drifted off, it was to a restless, dreamless sleep.
He restarted the movie and as the music began Steve spoke up, “Thanks, Tony. I'm glad you're here.”
Soft music flowed from his bedroom and it was, she realized, the same record that had been playing that night.
“I’m hungry.” Steve murmured.
Her reputation would be in shambles. Putting her personal life on display as an agent would be career suicide.
The sound made her freeze. If Steve was watching porn and masturbating, he was doing so
“Do I look crazy to you?”
"We couldn't come out, Sharon. Everyone holds up Captain America as this ultra-American patriot. If I came out and said I love Tony Stark there would be protests. People would lose their entire goddamn minds. The media would go nuts and
“I’m your RA, Stark. I have been since you came- you know what? Nevermind. Your dad is on the phone – says it’s important and to wake you up
Sharon hated that she knew he was right.
Tony was startled awake by the sound of a rapid knock against his dorm-room door.
“Oh no, you’ve grown an ego!”
“Right- you did it, Steve. Saved the city. Saved the day. Then we- we came out and found you.”
“You woke up?”
He was amazingly easy to talk to. He didn't just hear Tony talk, but he listened and asked questions when he didn't understand a reference or when he wanted to know more.
"Would you mind cutting off the music?"
At that, Steve turned and looked at Tony, his face reddened, “But this can’t exactly be comfortable for you.”
"Absolutely, at the last place I worked, I had to be the receptionist, the medical assistant, and at the end of the day, the cleaner." Tony chuckled, thinking of when he worked for Doctors Without Borders.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey Tony?” Steve scribbled on the pad, keeping his head down.
“He releases quite a bit of scent and slick during his exams." Dr. Edwards confided in him. "He gets so embarrassed about it but it’s nothing I haven’t seen before. I have no issue when a patient is like that but his scent seems to stick around and another patient complained about it. I’ll just have to have the receptionist be more cautious in the future about his appointment times. Perhaps later in the day so he’ll be the last.”
“All’s forgiven. I know you only want the best for Tony.” Steve smiled at the other man, “I’m glad you’re always on his side, Jim. Ready to go to bat for him no matter what… or who you might have to face.”
“I started after I…” Steve gestured to himself, “Before, I’m pretty sure if I picked a fight with a punching bag, it would have won.”
No one agreed which way was best. Obie thought they should take as much time as possible before telling him but Howard disagreed. Once Steve started asking questions and Tony, posing as Howard, began dodging them – Steve would only grow more and more suspicious.
“He is.” Steve and Rhodey spoke at the same time.
A short one, i'm afraid, as we're winding down to the part of the story where i've slowed down.
Steve smiled back then, teeth shining in the light of the movie and for the first time since he met him, Tony thought it might be the most real smile he’d seen on Steve’s face.
Tony focused on the wet spot at the tip before remembering why they were there and shifting his gaze back on Steve’s face.
Steve never seemed angry about it. He never complained about not spending enough time together.
“Dr. Stark? Mr. French is ready when you are.”
she thought with a smile,
When he was a child, Howard’s stories and the piles of newsreels and propaganda films he’d amassed enveloped Tony’s imagination. Captain America was a hero - a real life hero!
Steve laughed again, “2 minutes.”
“It really doesn’t bother me.” Tony assured him, “Let’s move on to the next part, okay? Are you ready?”
. God, I’ve got class in four hours. Unbelievable.”
Who else but Captain America could have survived?
“I’m nineteen.” Tony snapped.
She remembered seeing Howard Stark's Captain America memorabilia and how Tony's face lit up when he spoke about his childhood hero.
, and ShalinaBianca
Tony could feel the warmth of him as Mr. Rogers moved behind him. Tony lifted his chin and breathed in. There was the slightest scent in the air–
Tony huffed and grumbled as he began gathering his things to leave. The lightning and thunder overhead mirrored his dark mood. Worse, he had left his umbrella in his car, so not only had he been stood up but now Tony had a fun run and a damp drive home to look forward to.
“How are you tainting the name?” Steve asked, cocking his head to one side.
“Yeah,” Steve said, settling back onto the bed.
One of the medical assistants, Carson, bustled past him and pushed open the door leading to the waiting room.
“Yes, Doctor, Mr. French is having his vitals taken, and then he’ll be in room 4.”
“That’s great!” The figure stood and paused, “It- it’s me, Steve. Howard Stark.”
"Mm, guess so."
“As I’ve already said, it’s not at all uncommon for patients to exhibit signs of arousal during an exam. No one likes to talk about it but it happens far more frequently than you’d think. I personally know one couple that got together after the omega went into heat on the table and I’ve heard several other stories similar to it. Alright,” Tony said, “I’m not seeing any signs of discharge so far.”
Tony asked if Howard had built it in record time after the man had been found or if he had it built years ago – anticipating his success. His father ignored his question and continued talking about just how necessary it was that Captain America feel comfortable when he awoke.
Tony’s eyebrows rose.
Steve Rogers in all his gorgeous blond glory and absolutely soaking wet. At the sight of him, all thoughts and concerns of ethics swiftly drained out of Tony. Steve Rogers’ sodden white button-down shirt was nearly translucent and Tony could clearly see a pair of flawless, pink nipples.
Despite his assurances, Steve fell asleep ten minutes into Return of the Jedi.
“Heard everything.” Steve called out again, “Understood most of it. I know what ‘hot’ means.”
“I heard,” Jarvis nodded, “I will look for one immediately. Master Tony, do you think you should get in contact with your school about your extended absence?”
want me to inform Cap that you’re a major fanboy?”
Tony laughed, “You’re one to talk! You know they made comics about Captain America, don’t you? Movies, too!”
“Well yeah but- wait- are you serious, Tony?”
The clinic was empty and silent save for Tony walking the halls. He turned on the TV in the waiting room as he waited for six o'clock to arrive.
Rumiko chuckled, her usually sexy, throaty voice grating on his ears.
“If you really thought I was lying, you’d have clobbered me over the head and made your escape.” Tony reasoned, “But… you believe me. Don’t you?”
Steve’s chest rose and fell, almost making it difficult for Tony to keep his fingers rubbing but Tony was determined and kept up the massage.
“Is that so?” Rhodey exclaimed, “Please tell me more.”
Steve looked him from his plate of food to find Jarvis watching him.
Steve licked his lips. “It’s fine– it’s my own fault for forgetting my umbrella.”
Tony walked into the prepared exam room, turning to face the handsome omega. He directed Steve to undress, gesturing at the table and happened to catch sight of the dark screen of the computer. Protocol dictated that the attending physician offer to leave the room when a patient undressed so as to afford them a modicum of privacy but Tony wasn’t going to miss his opportunity to watch this perfect specimen undress.
“Excellent. Thank you, Keisha…?”
“Have a good night, Anthony,” Dr. Edwards was saying, pulling Tony from his thoughts.
“No, I-“ Tony lifted his chin to find Steve striding towards him, one hand extended as if to grab him.
Tony laughed, the sound of it filling the space, “Guess you decided.”
The man took a deep breath, “Yes.” He cleared his throat; much like Tony did and attempted a smile aimed at Steve, “Steve. It’s been a- a long time.”
"You were having sex with Tony."
Steve stepped into his embrace and like magic, the music changed to a slow-beat. Warm and sweet.
No, that wasn't it, she knew.
Steve smiled coldly at her, "Go ahead and see how far it gets you and your career. You're supposed to be good at keeping secrets, aren't you? Up until it hurts your feelings. Besides, who do you think people are going to believe? The jilted ex-girlfriend or Captain America?"
Tony placed his hands on Steve’s glands again and this time Steve only gave a fine tremble as Tony rubbed–gently at first and then with more pressure. Steve’s eyelids began to droop closed. Tony bit the inside of his cheek to keep from reacting to Steve’s enjoyment.
It was totally possible Mr. Rogers' symptoms were indicative of a more serious issue and Tony needed to focus on that–not getting his knot off. Determined to do his duty, Tony consulted Dr. Edwards and continued looking through his journals in between patients.
Steve laughed, “As far as I’m aware, I’m Steve Rogers. I crashed an airplane in 1945 and woke up last week and Tony was there dressed as his own father.”
Tony Stark, Boy Wonder!
“Steve, listen, I’ll explain everything to you but first, you’ve gotta eat. You haven’t eaten… the serum can only do so much. We put you on IV to feed you - did we have that in the 40s? Shit, no- the 60s… you know what? Forget the explanations. Let me grab some food for you.”
He was curious. Of course he was. This was Captain America.
“Dad…? Did, did something happen to him? My mom!?”
Tony’s shoulders dropped.
The two turned to see him and Natasha gracefully bowed out, “Thanks for letting me borrow the groom, Cap.”
Tony glanced at the mirror dominating the wall where the door was located. It was a two-way mirror.
“Well, the guy is famous, that’s hardly strange.” Sam glanced between the two men.
Steve shook his head, “It, uh- it was kind of nice hearing the movie while I slept.”
