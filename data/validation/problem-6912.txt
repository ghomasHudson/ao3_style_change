Jarvis was not a fan of animals, but Buddy and Bailey; he was fond of them if only for making Tony happy, for returning to his young master’s eyes some of the light that he was losing with the time.
When they were in their way to the company, Mr. Rogers talked to him for the first time since they left the restaurant.
This was signal. To move on and did what he wanted in the beginning. It was a high time for him to resign this PA sting.
There was Anna Jarvis with her warm hugs and delicious meals, she was the one that taught him to cook even if Tony didn’t have the patience for it and most of the time he burned the food. She also taught him about kindness and forgiveness, though the last one Tony had a lot of difficulties with. Anna was perfect in a way that it was comforting; her definition of perfection didn’t have the pressure that Howard’s had. For Anna he was her perfect little gentleman.
By then Tony would have forgotten about his love for Mr. Rogers. But that was not now, so he had to take actions.
“Your group is a menace” A old man with a severe problem of baldness interceded, “You need to be watched”
They were more; Tony knew that, a lot of them in the shadows and didn’t want recognition. Though the world needed them, every time that the Avengers came out it was something bigger than the previous, it was harder and had more casualties and sincerely they were understaffed.
Meeting Steve was like breathing after being a long time underwater, it was exhilarating and it made him feel alive again.
Even if it means to work as the PA of Steve Rogers, the CEO of Rogers International, a post that he didn’t imagine for him. When he came to RI was for a post in de R&D department, with his PhDs it would be a piece of cake or that was what he thought; in the end it was his MBA what won his place in the company. As a personal assistant, of the CEO, because apparently the HR’s secretary misplaced his curriculum and he was interviewed for the PA vacant, and the R&D that he originally wanted was occupied for a CalTech crony ten years older and only one PhD, and there was only one vacant so for the moment he had to endure being the PA, until another post was open. Or if he finds more investor to found his own company, whatever comes first.
If he has felt betrayed when he knew that Steve hide the true about his parents death, this finished to kill the hope that he stupidly harbored; because he knew about the Reactor and his issues with it.
“Welcome to the Avengers, kid” Tony said flippantly, “You have a life insurance, dental program and the worst working hours in the world”
Tony also discovered that Steve was not perfect, but it made him more perfect for him. Bailey like Buddy ¾and Tony¾ loved Steve at first sight. Steve loved the three Starks.
Natasha rests her hand on his shoulder in a silent support, Tony relaxes a little and abides the anger that threats to overwhelm him. He can hear Peter’s exited commentary of how amazing the quinjet is, Rhodey is going in the armor and his Highness has his own transport.
But he itched to return to inventing and designing the future, he was an Engineer not an Executive; he needed to put his mind and hands working in projects, loosing himself in equations and code. It was nice for a little while, he playing the role of a personal assistant, but he need bigger challenges that organize and impossible schedule or resume kilometric reports.
The place chose for the reception was tasteful and classy like the bride, the only thing that said Steve was the fact that it will be held in a little church near the hotel where the salon was. At least they had rooms so if the party become too excruciating to him, he could retire to his room for a moment to get his bearings.
“He was the one to propose, he asked me to be his best man so I think that it was answer enough, honey bear” Tony said bitterly, “It’s better this way”
(Cassie, Johnson’s assistant, called him apologizing when she heard about the spectacle that her boss mounted outside the CEO’s office.
crush that he is harboring towards his boss, the man was handsome and he is not blind, and when he quitted he will forget about it anyway, so no problems for his part.
The only time he tried to speak about it the other person fell sleep, he didn’t judge him but he wondered if Bruce hadn’t fell sleep that time, he would have helped Tony or it would be worse.
The more Mr. Rogers asked, the more Tony felt guilty. His boss was eager to know the reason and fixed it, trying to found a way to avoid Tony leaving.
“Bingo” he said quietly when two heads of rather scrawny puppies peeped up from the box, “hey there, um, boys?”
Tony took the cellphone and put it in a desk drawer, in a couple of days he would put it out again and stared at it for some time, a routine that he begun for weeks now. He would ask himself why he hadn’t destroyed the cellphone yet, why did he not prevent his teammates fugue of the RAFT, he would think about million of ‘ifs’ until the next meeting, or the next time he accompany Rhodey to his rehabilitation session.
That was when he heard that familiar bark, Tony looked at the floor and he saw him, there was Buddy barking happily and trying to hug him if not for the lash that was in the hand of the stranger that was trying ¾and failing¾ to talk to him.
“Ah, that is okay…if that was what you want, then I couldn’t say anything more to convince you to not leave”
Everett Ross smirked while he got up; he arranged his suit and smoothed the inexistent wrinkles on it.
“I…” Why was Mr. Rogers fighting so hard? For a simple employee like him, “I don’t think so, my dream was, is to build a company to create my own projects and do what I want”
Tony might never forgive him, but he wouldn’t put in risk the life of the people they fought for with something so petty like revenge. So he would wait for his call.
Then Rhodey falls and Tony is screaming inside his mind flying towards his friend the fastest that he can; but he doesn’t reach him in time and his friend doesn’t answer his calls, there is pulse and Tony can breath.
Apparently Natasha Romanov and Bucky were going out, still it didn’t make his chances with Steve more promising.
Then all the scheme of Zemo came to light and Tony hoped…he finally saw an exit, one with the less repercussions. One where Cap could have his bestie while he tried to forget that Rhodey could end paraplegic as the result of this wanton fight.
There in the center of the table was Everett Ross making the same question of their last meeting, the man had a placid expression in his face immune at the sound of disagreements of several members of the UN, waiting calmly for an answer he already knew. Waiting like a good part of the Committee, of those who wanted to reach and agreement, all of them names that Tony and Natasha agreed in the possibility of being in their side…the side that wanted to save people.
“I know” Tony said a little angry, “I know and I am working but they didn’t realize that…they just put us in a worse position.”
“We need to talk to T’challa” Steve stated getting up from the loveseat, “We need inside information”
It said something about being sorry too for not being able to protect their teammates and explaining that he didn’t know about the Raft. Tony wasn’t sorry for their last fight, he was still hurt but he understood that Barnes was only the gun and not who ordered the attack, that he would never be okay with it, but at least he would be civil with Barnes.
Darcy and him get a long like a house on fire, it made the things easier, Mr. Rogers would be in good hands.
They fight, Tony wants to kill his parent murderer all logic disappeared and is replaced with grief and visceral anger. It doesn’t matter that he has to pass through his soulmate to get him, he wants revenge like anything else.
At some point Tony tries to maintain eye contact with Steve, but he receives a text and leaves the room without explanation. Another feeling unusually quiet pass…it’s grief.
“With great power comes great responsibility” Peter said, “That was one of the favorite phrases of my Uncle” he explained to him, the boy didn’t see him at the eyes preferring playing with his long sleeve shirt, “He said it for last time a little after I acquired my powers and he died.”
“No, you are people too…but I know where they come from, you are more than us and that sometimes is scary”
Tony had to begin consider giving another call to another investors, to stop trying to delay his dream. He knew that they were more possibilities for financial help and he only remained in RI because his stupid crush in its CEO. It was a valuable experience, he couldn’t deny it, but it was pass the time that it was actual beneficial for him and turned up in being an excuse.
“We present an initiative, one of some of you I am sure already heard of it, The Avengers Initiative, though with some changes”
He forgot that Peggy was Tony’s family too and took Sharon’s words to the heart. Maybe that was the first mistake or the second… perhaps he would never know.
An incoming call comes from his own phone and Sharon Carter tells him that Aunt Peggy is dead. His world crumbles a little more, another piece falls and he is alone to deal with it; his soulmate is already in a quinjet flying toward London so lost in his own sorrow that he does not remember that he has another person who he can share it with, Steve lost his girl, Tony lost the last member of his family.
Tony wanted to make a world for them, one where their laws protect both, the civilians and their heroes. One where they could receive help and training; where accountability meant a fair trial.
Tony didn’t believe that Rhodey knew it and wondered when his friend would abandon that cave. How could he lose the Tony from MIT? And why did he not do anything to recuperate him?
There were other noises around them but Steve’s declaration sounded amplified to him along the sounds of his heartbeat.
“I believe that you have misunderstood it, Steven”. He said pointing Tony’s name in his right wrist. “This is the proof of Anthony’s love, that your name was the one that disappeared was the consequence of your choices; it was not for the lack of love that a bond ceases to exist…”
He remembers tracing, over and over, the name on his wrist ever since it appeared at his eight birthday; the elegant penmanship forming his soulmate’s name, his finger following each curve and sharp angle the move full of longing and heartache. He still does it, when he feels especially anxious it seems to help him calm, it’s like a balm for the hole in his soul a kind of painkiller for the ache that resides in his heart. It is a little silly, taking comfort in something so childish, but it has been one of the few touches that had lighten some of the burden since childhood…only comparable to his mother’s and Jarvis’ hugs.
Tony is not sure where this situation leaves their relationship, if after this they will still have some resemblance of it.
Tony didn’t like the idea of more people getting his hand in that document before it was presented to the UN, but he asked Carol’s opinion and now he was getting a help he sincerely didn’t expect and Tony wouldn’t be a fool to reject it.
“That was my first option, y’know, but they said they were no vacancies” Darcy explained, “But being a PA is not that bad, I know what to do, I had to work with Dr. Foster in my graduate school credits, so is no problem”
He left his shield, because he almost killed his other half… the love of his life with it, he didn’t deserve it.
Another reason? Because for all the wanted to put all the blame on Steve, Tony drowned in guilt in what he could have done better to prevent all that happened.
There were a lot of things that he couldn’t tolerate; one of them was not being in control and in that moment it what was happening.
He only remembered being angry, almost like the first time when he met Tony; however, now without the interference of Loki’s scepter (the mind’s gem); he also felt betrayed.
“I deserved to know, they were my parents” Tony nearly shouted, furious like Natasha has never seen before.
He is talking with his team when he feels it, for a moment he has the absurd wish that what he felt was from his too quiet bond-soul; but it is the flip phone. The package was due to arrive that day, so he is surprised that Tony contacts him so soon (Steve knows Tony and he has already acknowledged how resentful the brunet can be). It s a text, it isn’t the call he was hopping…but it’s something.
Steve stared at his phone with conflicted feelings, he passed his index finger of his right hand at the sides of the piece of technology, waiting for a call he was not sure he would ever receive. Waiting for words but he didn’t know what kind of them he hoped to receive.
They have power and a great responsibility along with it, their life come to second to those they swear themselves to protect when they accepted the role of Avengers.
“Thomas was indisposed sir, I can make a call to asking for another driver… but I am sorry, but after Mr. Johnson interruption we will be late for your ‘appointment’” Tony said in the most regretful tone that he could muster.
The blond directed Johnson to his office, but before he closed the door he glanced at Tony in apology, like he was guilty of the rudeness of the other man. Tony waved dismissing it and Mr. Rogers smiled again. He was accustomed to people reacting poorly to him.
Is the least that he could do it, to leave someone capable to manage the difficult schedule of Mr. Rogers.
Tony’s idea and Natasha’s approval, Laura was sure as she saw the coordinates masked in the package.
He wonders if Steve knew that he was there, he chose to sit the last row trying to pass unnoticed and went through the ceremony in calm dealing with his loss. He heard Sharon’s speech and the glances that she and Steve shared. It was when he knew that Steve wouldn’t sign the Accords.
“Invite me a cup of coffee” Tony elaborated while he walked towards his boss, “There is this little café a couple of blocks from him, you left your wallet in yesterday’s suit so you need to take it, you have to paid since you will be inviting me.”
It is still there and Steve breaths a little better; there isn’t discolorations or signs of decaying. He picks up the flip phone again and dials the only number it has programmed.
Then there was Maria Stark, mom, with smiles that brighten any place, agile fingers that could produce music that soothed his soul, warm voice that told him ‘I love you’ every time he needed it and kisses that warmed all his being. She taught him to play piano, she told him that music was similar to the mathematics that Tony loved, she told him about patience and skill, how to wait and not rush…he wasn’t very good on that. Maria taught him sacrifice and resistance, what real love had to be about; she told him to love with almost all his being, because if he gave all, he wouldn’t have anything to return to.
He named them Bailey and Buddy, well Jarvis named them when he called him asking if he knew something about the care of puppies. Apparently those were top names for dogs, and Tony had been ban of any kind of naming after DUM-E and if his thesis works as he planned JARVIS.
Tony didn’t know a fuck about taking care of puppies, but he just couldn’t leave them in that storm waiting for dead; he wasn’t so heartless.
After that, getting to know Steve Rogers and being in his presence was a pleasure. Even when his boss was being obnoxious, stubborn, a punk or a tease. All the quirks that formed Mr. Rogers were endearing instead of unpleasant for him.
Then Peggy died and the Government wanted to kill his best friend, the man that Steve was in debt with. He couldn’t leave Bucky alone, he had to help him and Steve hoped that Tony understood that; he already has failed his friend once, he could not repeat that, Steve wouldn’t loose his best friend again.
Each hit is painful and the burning in his wrist worsen minute after minute but Tony does his best to ignore it. He tears Barnes’ left arm and he feels a vicious satisfaction with that, Steve increases the power of his punches but FRIDAY finishes to analyze his fight pattern. He is in the floor and Tony wishes he remains there.
Tony was a professional, a businessman, he made his relationship with her what it must have been since the start just a business transaction.
Tony shrugged diminish the flattery, yeah he looked good in his tailored tuxedo but he did not radiated happiness like the blond.
Tony feels fear because this Steve is not pulling anything and with each hit of his shield seems nearer to be a fatal hit. For a moment he can see the shield going down towards his neck, and he has the ridiculous impulse to say
Maybe he wasn’t worthy of being Tony’s soulmate and the moment that the genius realized that…it was when Steve’s disappeared.
“Hey Cap” Sam interrupted his musings, he left the phone on the coffee table in front of him, his friend smirked at the sight of that, “Missing Sharon? man you have it bad”
He just…Steve needs to believe that they will solve it, that this is not the end of their relationship, they
Whimpers could be heard even with the rain falling without mercy, whimpers from a box that cached his attention. Now hearing it and not only seeing, he couldn’t ignore it even if he wanted. Whatever, he checked his phone for the hour, 00:05, officially a new day…so his odds were good.
Steve doesn’t surrender so they fight, teams against team, all of them friends in different sides, all them wanting to do the right thing. Tony is tired and the anger resurges, he wants to finish this and return home…to have a movie night with all of them, to cuddle with Steve in the loveseat and being so unbearably sweet with each other that Clint will throw at them popcorns while the others watch the scene fondly.
Tony persuades General Ross to let him in charge to the persecution in hopes to protect his wayward other half.
“I missed you too, I am sorry, so sorry…please don’t do it again” Tony whispered with his head buried in his dog fur. “Don’t leave me, Buddy”
If Steve is able to do the same, hitting him to protect his friend, he will do the same and avenge his Mother.
Tony couldn’t care for anything else; he just wanted to kiss Steve like all these years he had dreamt.
Not that Tony minded, he was sure that if he worked in SI he would be worse; Mr. Rogers was actually pretty tame. Moreover, it had nothing to do with the little
So he found himself in the pathetic position of searching refuge, watching out for a store with enough space in its exterior to protect him of the rain; a café would be perfect he really needed his daily fix of caffeine. However, it was late and most of the stores were closed or had already packed with unfortunate souls like him.
Someone put Stark interview in the TV of the conference room and begun to whisper trying to dissect Stark’s corporal gives.
SR formed a partnership with RI and together launched a medical accessible program for the poorest communities.
“Whatever he is proposing it didn’t change the fact that the control is in hands of the UN, a new name and more specifications don’t make it different from its predecessor” Steve declared with a sour face, “They still wanted us as their attack dogs”
Wanda was silent watching her teammates discuss the contents of this new proposal, all them sporting the same range of emotions from bitterness to anger, talking in circles about the same things. It was a little tiring, after months of hearing them complain and they being stranded here it was exhausting. She changed of jail from the Avengers Complex, the RAFT and now Wakanda; Wanda wondered if Cap saw it as that.
But maybe it was a high time for him to visit his ghosts, he could start with his mother and when being in London Peggy’s and Jarvis and Anna’s, and if he had the courage he could end with his father.
almost inexistent) crush he had been harboring for the almost entirely all the time of their friendship with Steve; that hopeless feeling that was born with Steve’s ridiculous
“I certainly had a difficult morning, but that was not a date” Mr. Rogers said looking at him puzzled, Tony dismissed the look and concentrated in his driving, trying to see the rear-view mirror the least he could.
The puppies were time consumers, and with his schedule already packed, it took a toll of him to try to be on time with all his work. The sensible thing would be looking for a house where they could play and receive all the love they deserved.
So Tony complied and reserved the perfect place and arranged his schedule according, what he did not anticipated was the driver being sick as a dog.
Once upon a time he might have believed those words, but now he couldn’t afford it. He still had accords to emend, the UN to convince, a best friend to help and an ex-girlfriend to make rights to.
“So you didn’t agree with the Accords” He wasn’t asking her, “Which was something that will protect normal people and keep us in control”
It’s after T’challa comes for him that he can leave the armor, he looks at his wrist remembering the burning and find it blank, there is no name…Steve Rogers is erased from his skin leaving his wrist clean in a way he didn’t remember.
Bailey and Buddy were growing up nicely and were very smart, Tony was training them and they cached up quickly the instructions.
In the first place he just left the University’s laboratory because he was starving since he couldn’t eat on breakfast and at lunch he totally forgot; however, he didn’t check the hour when he got out, the supermarket was open till ten o’ clock, it was quarter past eleven when he decided to go and see if they could offer something more nutritious ¾Pepper would be so proud¾ since the vending machines near the laboratory only offered some cookies and a weird looking sandwiches, but now they seemed better than a hour ago.
He now wakes up from those dreams panting, bathed in sweat, tears running through his cheeks and heartbroken. He deserves it, though he only hopes that Tony doesn’t have the same nightmares.
Tony could tell Aunt Peggy about the Accords and asked Jarvis if he did the right thing supporting them, he could tell his mother about how much he desired that the things didn’t end like that how much he regretted that it cost them their team. He could have shared in a whisper, like he used to do as a kid, that he wanted them to be a family with Anna.
So, he was there staring at his phone like every day when he was not training or exploring Wakanda with the rest of his team. He could have call Tony and end that pathetic waiting, but he had this fear of Tony not answering…of finding the number disconnect…unreachable.
He traces Steve’s name from memory inside his left wrist again and again, the gesture is less soothing that he remembers.
But Wanda’s custody in the Complex changes it all and Steve turns in someone Tony doesn’t recognize.
, smiling when the puppies kept head-butting his hand for more attention, they were cute and lively enough to discard a serious disease, so the visit to the Vet could wait until tomorrow at a more decent hour.
“I will forgive Steve given the time, but I won’t forget what he did” Tony said with a bittersweet smile, “Anna taught me better, but I am not as a good person as her”
Steve hugged him and whispered sweet nothings at his ear, it was the last time he hugged him like that, after that came Ultron and his retirement, the drills and Steve’s quest to find Barnes.
Now walking towards Steve room, Tony wondered if it would be possible for him to make an early exit; something to escape the breakfast (more like brunch) the day after and obviously the newlyweds going for they honeymoon. He reached his destination sooner that he would have liked, he took a minute to breath deeply before he knocked on the door and this was it the final time that Steve would be free.
And now it was Steve and Barnes, both of them hitting and breaking…hearing the same line time after time.
“Just Stark announcing a revamped Avenger’s Initiative” His friend spited, “They didn’t give details but it caused commotion…”
, but I can’t because I know you wouldn't want that and because it’s not really his fault, but how I want…because you never deserved that”
Natasha observed him, the defeated stance without the cocky charade that was normally in his features, the sadness in his eyes and all the discolored bruises of a painful fight, pain from fighting a super soldier or a friend maybe from both. It was a Tony that she had never seen even when the man was dying he didn’t look like this.
Really, he liked James, he had this sarcastic and witty personality and even when they fought ¾and that was more common than the appropriate¾ Tony didn’t hate him, they could be like friends with more time, their personalities almost similar make it difficult and easy at the same time. But asshole calls an asshole.
Mr. Rogers looked at him right in the eyes, those blue eyes determined and sincere, trying to transmit all his feelings.
Tony sighed and stalked his face with the palms of his hands trying to put aside those useless thoughts.
The travels were not problem either, apart from his mother, Jarvis and Rhodey, he didn’t have another person who cared or wanted his presence; and he had the opportunity to practice and picked up more languages.
But if they were there since the beginning they could have a tell in what those regulations would be; they could turn the accords to their benefit with compromising, but that word apparently didn’t exist in Cap’s dictionary.
When he finished to read Steve’s letter, Tony did two things; the first was burning the letter, he couldn’t let evidence of his contact with them for their security and his own, the second was to write his own.
There is the memory of the first time that Steve told him that he loved him, but Tony can’t remember the last time Steve repeated it.
Tony opened the lids of the box with care, peeking its contents. He guessed that it must had contained some kind of animal, probably kittens or puppies, some unfortunate animals that had been in the unlucky place of their owner being an A+ douchebag.
He knew that he let himself be blinded by facts; something not especially unusual by him because hello he is an engineer…a scientist if you wanted, hard numbers and facts were his life. However, he decided to ignore that little voice that told him how wrong all of this seemed, in his defense that same voice was usually the one that had those ‘
And it hit him, it was his last chance...after this he would have to keep quiet and tried to live as this man friend, maybe he even would be the godfather of Steve’s children or they would call him Uncle Tony. Steve would get married and he would left alone with his broken heart and what if’s. Maybe was too late, but he couldn’t bear not trying…if it failed Barnes could keep his job as best man.
Maybe she would be the one, she certainly seemed like a one, she could be the final date and turned in a steady. Tony always knew that this day would come, but he didn’t expect to hurt this much.
The man could be edgy before a deadline, even anxious in some situations. However, he was always in control, he liked to know all about what happened in his life and had the ways to confront everything that was put in front of him. He had the intelligence and the meaning to do it.
He recognized convoluted politics miles away and he did know the game after decades playing it. He told the congress assclowns a couple of years ago. That’s why he knew that he had to sign the damned accord…
“I am an Engineer, what I love it’s not the administrative work, but inventing…finding alternatives, another ways to work a problem” Tony tried to explain, his frustration, his dreams, “It’s not that I didn’t like working for you, but it is not what I see myself doing in the future, I don’t want to became frustrated and doing poorly my job because of it”
So here I am, I won't call quotes of the movie in what I wrote here...because they are not, 'cause I am terrible in remembering word by word without hearing at least five times?, but I tended to keep the feelings that they gave me in that moment. Thus I hope you can deal with that.
If this woman could make Mr. Rogers smile like that, then Tony could leave in peace. The blond would have her and with another competent PA he would be good, he wouldn’t miss Tony, and that was good, because Tony would try his hardest to forget him and concentrate in building his own empire.
Grumbling to himself and thinking of awe inspiring equations for his investigation project, he kept on walking as fast as he could and trying to protect his face of the wind; that was when he noticed it, he didn’t know how it cached his peripheral vision but it did, he stopped for a moment deciding if it was worth returning and exposing himself more to the rain, or it would be better just walk away towards his warm apartment. Choices.
Tony dreamed with the sound of her heels and the wheels of her suitcase leaving their home. But some part of himself ¾an ugly one¾ feels free, he could be Iron Man again without excuse, he could return with his team. He could protect people.
He was so fucking angry, when Steve told him that they would deal with Ultron together, he believed him and then just saw what together ended to be. Captain America decided to sacrifice all that they were, Tony sometimes wondered if Steve realized the extend of that, he would have to know.
Buddy went missing, it was stupid, it just took a second of Tony being entertained by Bailey for giving a chance to Buddy to wander alone. And neither of his dogs knew
He felt the same every time Steve smiled at him with proud in every line of his face. That usually made him uncomfortable after some minutes and he didn’t know why.
Tony smiled at his friend and left the room to search the groom and started his functions as best man, he touched the box in his pocket’s pants gingerly through its expensive fabric. He wished that Steve had chose Barnes instead of him, it would have made the things a little easier for him.
“Yes, no” Peter seemed frustrated with the answer, “In part, but when you saw something happening and you have the power to help, how could you not?”
“No, no, no” he whispers with increasing anxiety dropping the phone to touch his own wrist with misery.
Tony sometimes woke up screaming, his throat on fire and having not recollection of crying but feeling the moisture in the corner of his eyes.
That Tony knew that’s why he was working on something else…in something that it was impossible for this man to have knowledge of it.
Just look at him, his fantastic ideas destroyed a country. They were a threat and it didn’t matter what Steve had to say, they couldn’t control themselves.
There was Peter and after him were Sam and Kamala, all them so young, so eager to do the right thing…to save people.
“They’re different, a new Avengers Initiative or so he is saying” Sam specified with a serious expression, “We need to get a copy of that Initiative even if we won’t sign it, only to know what kind of deal they are offering to the UN and whichever accepted the document”
There was a package curiously sent via FedEx than the usual messenger from Stark Industries, it had passports for her and the children, some credit cards and an envelope with a lot of hundreds.
cellphone that Cap sent him and Tony didn’t know what to think, he has spent some hours here and there thinking about its meaning, he had thought about call him but that impulse didn’t last long; at least not when he remembered about Steve lying to him, about his teammates in the RAFT and those that didn’t want to be found. When he remembered why there were not more Avengers.
He could see her rimmed red eyes, the tense lines around her eyes and mouth, how the light in her eyes diminished every time he returned from a mission with the Avengers. How being Iron Mas was consuming her and how not being was killing him.
“You aren’t dreaming” Steve said blushing, he was adorable and he had to be talking aloud, “Yeah, you are…also thank you I think that you adorable too”
“My contract was really loose in those clauses” Tony said with humor, “Don’t worry about it, what it matter was that you had a nice date after the horrible morning that you had, Mr. Rogers”
But after New York all of it changed, then came Ultron and their secret was exposed to more people, Earth’s mightiest heroes, yes, but they were more persons in which the safety of her children laid. These heroes were still humans (except for Thor, but sincerely Laura didn’t see the difference between the blond and the rest of the team) so they were prone to make mistakes, and that was good because that made them reachable, people could emphasize with them; nevertheless their mistakes usually lead to destruction at grand scale, and people was afraid even if they had save them, it didn’t mean they weren’t scare.
She also read the new Avengers Initiative, Carol took her time but finally mailed Tony to schedule a date and talk about his proposal together.
Because Bruce Banner was only another person that he managed to drive off from him, just other name in the large list of people that he was too much for them.
He tells Sam about one Colonel Helmut Zemo and his part in the bombing in Vienna. Tony also talks a little about Rhodey in crisp tone because he is angry with him.
Thus Tony was not so sure where Everett Ross loyalty lies. If he wanted to help the Super Heroes community or just, like it seemed the rest of the UN, wanted dog attacks for their personal agendas.
It could be that when he was a CEO himself they would meet again, but now as equals, inclusive they could make deals…even if he wanted to concentrate in Green Energy and not the Medical that RI was focused.
Tony scoffed; he was capable of taking care of himself without the pups. He reminded Jarvis of that.
They were his fucking parents he had the right to know how they died. He lost that day his mother, aside for Jarvis and Ana, the only of light in his childhood; his innocent mother whose only crime was to be there with Howard.
He endured months of these without him noticing, but he was not happy, and being in love with his boss was not the only excuse. He had to leave before he was truly unhappy.
“The thing is Mr. Stark that they’re fugitives, we can ignore that and pretend that every time they go and ‘save’ someone they’re right”
“You are a good person” Vision said without seeing him, preferring to concentrate in the concoction on the stove, some Paprika dish that Tony or Rhodey would end trying, “You make mistake like the rest of the people, but the difference, like the other in our position, is that we have power and that makes our mistakes more dangerous”
But his mother’s death was what begun the spiral of destruction that his life turned into, well at least more destructive than before. Because the only good thing about being birth in the Stark family was Maria, with her soft ‘
So Tony gets to know how to run a fortune 500 company, gains a nice salary, and the cherry on the top was his handsome boss.
“Don’t…just don’t decide what I feel, you didn’t asked you, like always, just presume to know what the fucking hell is going on with me” Natasha nearly flinched at the look of betrayal in Tony’s eyes, in the cold on his voice, “It is good when everyone but me keep a secret something, I don’t have the right to keep something for myself…but you know what I don’t care anymore, you could still excuse yourself saying it was for my own good or whatever reason you thought it was the right thing to do; however, you and him loose the right to demand not to keep secrets, the fucking trust that I made myself believe I had in you… This was the last time I let you betray me”
“I don’t need the money, I am really glad that he found his owner” the blond ducked until he was at the same height of him and Buddy, “but if you want to reward me, how about a date?”
Something breaks and he feel his wrist in flames a distraction that Steve takes advantage of and now he is in the floor, the other forces his helmet out and they are seeing eye to eye, Steve furious like he has never seen him, hitting with his shield all in reach, it doesn’t matter that he can’t defend properly himself.
So when the time to call Tony came, he accepted Sam’s reasons not to call him. He also forgot what he preached on the Ultron’s debacle.
Natasha saw him regain his self-control and put on the mask he used on strangers…in people he didn’t consider close to him and it hurt more like she believed it would. She didn’t know how much she cared for Tony and appreciated his friendship until now, when she didn’t have it anymore.
, , but the last didn’t went well with what she saw the last time. Stark was disconcerted seeing they there, she wasn’t able to use her powers but she could read his corporal behavior; Wanda knew better Stark after the month working together.
Sometimes Tony woke up feeling cold and shivering, his body remembering the hours in Siberia until Vision came for him, the suit powerless and making everything colder…the shield in front of him and the sounds of a quinjet going up and going far from there.
But how could he remain calm? Steve Rogers was the perfect specimen of the human race, tall, blonde and his muscles had muscles ¾all in the perfect way¾, but also he was a decent person; he liked to help and was always polite, he had this little shy smile and blushes adorably when someone make a pass to him, like he didn’t believe it possible…and lets not talk about his eyes, they were so blue that they reminded him of the sky when it was clear.
“So in summary, you’re telling us that we have to give our life and hope with doing that we don’t end in a prison, because I only hearing that” Tony said tersely, “That every time we think in doing the right thing, of saving people, we have to wait for you to get your collective asses out of your head and deem the situation appropriate, risking with that the lost of several life”
Sorry for the delay Mother's day and present hunting was my excuse. Hope you enjoy this chapter, thank you for the support and let's give this author your opinion. Happy Mother's Day btw!!
He seemed so sure, so determined to do well, just like him in the beginning when he searched for all his weapons. When he was arrogant enough to believe he could single-handed put peace in the world, just to now know that he put on march something bigger than him.
He recalls the memory in the route towards Leipzig remembering that it’s his soulmate who will be there, it will be Steve his other half and he will be able to
“About the reward, we need to go to my apartment for it…I don’t usually carry cash” Tony said because he was unable to hold a normal conversation with Steve Rogers, if the pinched expression on the other face was clue enough.
It’s an image (a low quality image that Steve is so sure had Tony cringing with utter disgust, it was obviously taken with the same device that he has sent) and for a moment he doesn’t understand what he is seeing. It’s the inside Tony’s left wrist, he knows that because he has spent a considerate amount of time memorizing his lover’s body specially where his name resides; said wrist has a little mole under the beginning of his thumb, he loves that mole.
There was an awkward silence…Tony was not good with feelings and people insisted in talking to him about them. But Peter is young, so painfully young for the kind of living that the Avengers had; however, the boy needed them and Tony wanted to protect him.
Tony searched for hours, in the neighborhood and outside it, shouting Buddy’s name until his throat hurt. Bailey noticing her owner distress begun to yowl, in an unusually sign of empathy from her, but it was her brother, Tony guessed, so she must have been worried too.
“You are an idiot” a voice murmured in his ear, Tony’s face on a warm chest and Steve’s fragrance filling his nose. “Years convincing myself that it was impossible, that someone like you couldn’t love someone like me…years trying to moving on but still loving you and conforming myself with whatever place you want me to take.”
Tony hears Clint’s painful jabs stoically, he doesn’t have the time to discuss with him, and he needs Sam cooperation if he wants to save Steve and Barnes.
His nightmares had a lot of sources: sometimes it could be Afghanistan, other times Obadiah, for a time the wormhole was the principal and with it the anxiety attacks, then it was Aldrich and Pepper falling, after Wanda it was his team death that still remained, Ultron.
Sam talked a little more and Steve begun to guess what Tony was playing at, didn’t the Accords already caused a lot of damage. He still wanted to play God after Ultron.
The anger subdues a little and Tony only wants this farce finish and return home to recuperate some form of peace.
Like his first day, he was introduced to this tall, blond, muscular with outstanding blue eyes and kind smile and Tony became tongued tied in his presence only having mind to return the handshake presented. Because never in his life was gifted with a smile like that, one that didn’t wanted something in return or expected something of him. It just seemed to reflect that the person who gave it to him was glad to meet him, without second intentions, and it was for Tony, not Stark. That was when Tony decided to give a chance to the PA position.
He called for a debriefing after hearing Sam’s information about To-Stark. Steve couldn’t understand Stark’s insistence in those Accords, in giving another people, people with hidden agendas, the control; the power that they hold was dangerous and in the wrong hand it could be devastating.
So his actual situation, he is not a CEO not for lack of want, more like the legal system and the Government campaigns to help the start up was so tangled and restricting, that instead of helping it was blocking his advances. Even when he went with his proposal to private investors they were more difficult to crack than he imagined, though, he is suspicious of Howard. His father is prone to use his contacts to make it more difficult for him, he could be using his influence trying to teach him a lesson and making him return begging for another chance.
They were his friends too (even if he didn’t know two of them, gosh, where the heck did Tony find that kid?) he didn’t want to fight.
“As in the Astrophysics Jane Foster?” Tony asked a little impressed, he was fan of Doctor Foster’s work.
That’s why he is doing it now, inconspicuously as he can, telling his team about Charles Spencer’s death and his position towards the Accords, he can feel Steve’s disapproval through the bond a feeling so muted that makes Tony wonder if his partner is trying to quell it.
Tony sometimes dreamed with eyes so blue like the sky and smiles that shined like the sun at noon. He woke up from those dreams with the sensation of a fresh essence in his nostrils and relaxed in a way that only seldom times he could achieve.
Bucky was the one who opened the door and glared at Tony for some confusing seconds, he had an expression to wanting to say something and not knowing how to say it. Tony learnt with time that it was easier to wait for Barnes to speak than doing it before him.
He believed he was more to Steve, but apparently he didn’t meant enough to try for him; the same way he did it in the helicarrier when he let himself being punched by his best friend in order to recover some form of memory. Tony isn’t worth enough of the sacrifice. So he fights for himself.
“Nah, they’re a just nervous…leave it to me, I’ll talk with some of them to read it and give a shot”
So Tony maybe had miscalculated, taking care of puppies was difficult ¾and he was a genius working for his third doctorate, so imagine¾ at least he discover that puppy one, the light gray and black spotted, was a girl, the black was a boy. It was what the Vet had told him when he took the puppies in the morning, that and aside of a little infestation of fleas and undernourishment, they were healthy; some shots for the fleas and their first vaccine, and a recommendation for a good branch of dog’s food, was all that the Vet had to offer them.
Steve excuses himself from the meeting and leaves the room wanting for privacy. His mind makes wonderings about the content of the text while he is walking towards his room.
“It was worthy Tony” Rhodey said after a hard rehabilitation session, “I believed in those Accords, they were not perfect…but the essence? They were right and if my injury was the price at least it was me and not civilians this time”
’ , was a outgoing woman with an uncanny knack for scheduling than even surpass him, also she would be a mean PR if a post was available.
He didn’t know what he would do if Buddy didn’t return, he didn’t want to think about that. He kind of zoned out with those thoughts while he was pasting his missing post with the ridiculous exorbitant reward.
But today he would lose Steve forever, so maybe he was not really feeling nervous and he was more sad and worried than anything else.
They fought, Bucky was innocent and he couldn’t let Tony kill him, if that meant that he had to fight his soulmate, he would do it.
“Talk to him” Bucky said with a gruff, “It’s your last chance, Stark” he gave him a meaningful look, “you aren’t a coward”
Carol read the Accords and agreed that they need some kind of control, she didn’t agree in what those Accords propose as a form of control; she was disgusted at the RAFT, but she was willing to compromise.
“Really Steve, you can’t have an incompetent person for your PA it reflects a bad image of the company, you need to fire him before he make an unforgivable mistake” the man said.
“But not the only solution” Laura knew it and she also knew that Tony realized that, “Not everything is white and black”
Steve shook his head and didn’t answer that, left Sam imagining whatever he wanted. However, Sam mentioned Sharon reminded him that he hadn’t call on weeks, neither do her…and it was weird, because you must missed hearing of your lover one way or another if you were separated. He would think about it another time.
He still could hear the broken tone filled with defeat and wanted to scream and told that infuriating mind that he still was his friend.
Stark and his dumb proposal was making his work harder, giving hopes to those all unruly vigilantes. That man didn’t know what he was playing with, all that power and without control? Bad idea; just like the Hulk or now Captain America.
’ ideas like Ultron, so disregarding it was not so difficult and having Natasha’s not exactly approval but understanding sold it. He forgot about how fucking white and black the law seemed to be sometimes.
He run at the door after that, he was a coward even if Barnes thought the contrary. Maybe he had the courage to say something about his feelings, but he was not brave enough to stay and hear Steve’s answer.
He stares at the flip-phone and checks at the contact, he takes a photo of his blank wrist at sends it.
He fires a repulsor towards Sam and forgets everything aside from get Rhodey medical attention, he goes with him in the ambulance; he left Ross’ men deal with the rest of his teammates, Natasha and Vision arrives at the Hospital some minutes after them.
Their reunion was emotive ¾if Tony said so himself¾, full of dog kisses and threats and praises from Tony. He nearly cut off the leash keeping Buddy from him, he managed to untie it after a few tries and gained a lapful of overexcited pup.
“I’m hopeless” Tony grumbled, Buddy licked his face trying to cheer him up, Bailey was lying in the opposite love seat seeing them unimpressed. “You could be totally a cat, doll,” he told her, “with that apathetic response to your owner suffering”
One of their first talks with Rhodey was about his parents’ death…about why Vision had to go to Siberia for him.
“You know, Hank (the guy that invented my suit) told me to never trust a Stark” Scott begun in apropos of nothing, “But I know Stark’s work, y’know, in my sting as thief I had never encounter better security than his, only with the suit I was able to pass some of the more difficult defenses of the A-Complex, so if he was really involved in the RAFT thing, why Steve was able to free us”
¾his actual situation¾ but it also is not like he imagined himself two years after he got out of his father’s house and consequently renouncing to his inheritance. He naïvely believed more on the lines of being more successful than his father and having a miracle start up worthy of millions, the entrepreneur dream come reality. The harsh true, it did not happen yet, because if Tony Stark is something, it was stubborn.
“I will notice” Mr. Rogers grumbled, “Of course I will notice that you are not here, I will notice that my PA isn’t this wonderful man, with this beautiful smile and lovely eyes, with his sarcastic comments and stubborn way to not say my name, my PA who seemed to predict the future and always was ready”
Sam must has seen something in his eyes but Tony doesn’t care in what, he thanks him and goes for his stubborn mate with all intention to help him in that suicide mission of his.
The only person who came close the truth was Jarvis and that was another can of worms that he didn’t want to touch.
Fights usually came with collateral damage, not only from the bad guy, but some of them from their heroes. How could a normal person understand the death of a loved one? A death caused for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, death that was from a mistake for a carelessness of one of the team.
The thing was that Tony believed that he was happy without adding Steve Rogers to the mix, but if that was he being happy…he didn’t know what he was feeling anymore.
“We can begin trying to drop the charges against Captain Rogers, Wanda Maximoff, Clint Barton, Sam Wilson, Scott Lang and if we are good and our ‘guest’ Zemo cooperate Sergeant Barnes”
He did present his resignation letter the next morning, the secretary that received it looked at him with surprise. Tony imagined that with the salary and all the benefits, it was uncommon for someone to resign instead of being fired.
“It’s not perfect” that was the first thing that Carol said to Tony after introductions and small talk, “But it could be, if you want this to have a go, you will need more supporters”
>>“You are telling us to fight your wars and bleed for you and your political agendas” Tony paused taking air and seeing each member of the Committee, “Then we have a disagreement, we didn’t sign to that…we sign for an opportunity to reach a compromise not to turn us in your watch dogs.”
“Of course I will notice that you left Tony, why not if in these months you become more a friend than a employee, that you took care for me…and I know that this is terrible unprofessional but since it seem that you won’t be working for me anymore. How could I not notice that you left, when I always do is looking for you, that I miss you when you are not by my side, that I fell for you without noticing, so hard that is ridiculous”
He searched in the glove box for another black AmEx, with how careless his boss seemed of the money, he thought opportune to have some kind of back up in all his cars. It was not like it would hurt him to have some more cards, he certainly could maintain them.
Rhodey told him he looked like he gained more muscular tone ¾though, Tony suspected that his friend didn’t wanted to say ‘chubby’ ¾, his best friend fell in love with Buddy and Bailey, he wanted one. Tony refused.
“About that, I think I left my wallet in my other suit…do you have another of my credit cards?” Mr. Rogers said sheepishly.
He sent Tony the letter and the flip phone hopping that it would be the first step to mend their relationship.
“Don’t, if he wants, he will call me”, Laura said calmly, “You are doing your job, I don’t agree with your actions but I understand that you’re following orders, and it was strange coming from you”
Steve Rogers was some of the kindness people that Tony had met in his life, though he also had that touch of unkindness towards the person who dared to hurt one of his loved ones. The blond was also one of the most stubborn people that Tony knew, and took for example that he too was obstinate when he wanted, Steve was sometimes too inflexible to Tony’s taste, but it also gave the blond a solid moral compass that he sincerely admired. There were a lot of qualities that made Steve but for them the had also something that balanced them, Tony begun to fall for the man the moment he discovered and had still been falling even if he didn’t want to admit it.
There were hearings and a lot of reunions with the UN Committee scheduled. Every each of them more tedious that the previous; always repeating the same tirade, the same charges and the need of control, the fear concentrated in the form of an unjust Accord.
Parading in the rain must count as a shower, like hell he would wake up early tomorrow to take a proper one, his assessor must have to endure the smell of science and awesomeness.
Bailey liked to eat lying and slowly, her brother on the other hand ate as fast as he could and always wanted more, he was like a black hole. Tony had to program an alarm to remember to feed them and while he did it, he also ate. It was a win-win situation.
He grieved his father’s death in a way too paradoxical to explain in public, he hated and loved Howard at the same time, what had hurt the most was not being able to demonstrate his worthiness of the Stark surname, to not obligate Howard to say that he was proud of his with his achievements. He was selfish with his Dad’s death, his ego was what hurt the most.
That Steve cared for him and he regretted that the things ended like that, but he didn’t lamented defending Bucky.
But aside from that he didn’t really know what else to expect, they hadn’t changed of opinion, Tony was still in favor of those ridiculous Accords and he couldn’t think of them without wanting to destroy something.
He ends the call and dials again…and again all the times with the same results. He doesn’t know how many calls he has done but the battery of the flip phone discharged before he can make another. He feels the dry tears making his skin uncomfortable and a headache that for a moment surprises Steve, he hasn’t have one in a lot of time. But it doesn’t matter, nothing matter anymore.
could agree with those Accords, how he can give up his freedom when not a long time ago Tony called the Congress assclowns for trying to obtain his suit. In that moment he thought nastily that Stark could only ‘compromise’ when his tech was not in the line, Steve regretted the thought almost immediately; he had already misjudged his other half once and he paid it nearly losing him, even if they were at odds, he didn’t want to loose him.
“But I put a reward in the missing posts” Tony insisted, he didn’t even know why he was so adamant to give Steve money.
However, he still couldn’t believe how he did it to win the job, in first place he only took the MBA because his father insisted ¾more like obligated him¾ and ‘cause he thought that it would be handy when he created his own company; sincerely he didn’t like too much all the administrative jargon that came with owning a business.
“It’s not money and neither the rest, Mr. Rogers” Tony finally said, “It’s only that I need to leave”
The flight pass to quickly and he is in front of Steve trying to convince him in signing, he wants to explain that it’s their best shot if they want to have a hand in something that appears to be irremediable.
Mr. Rogers laughed at that, and Tony cursed him for having a ridiculous imperfect dorky laugh that seemed perfect to him.
It’s not like Tony hated his job, actually it was pleasant and he gets to see how the executive office of transnational company operated; it is one of goals when he gets to establish his own is make it as big and important as he can. So he is learning with the actual benefit that his boss is hot as hell as he is competent.
“I don’t have to hold a grudge? Maybe but you are my best friend not him and Tony I will always be on your side, you ride with me, remember”
“I am really sorry Tony, but I swear it that he told me that he wanted a date for tomorrow, not today”
Tony smiled wanly and waited for his receipt, he cached Mr. Rogers glance and nodded in a way to say that he already took care of the bill. The man smiled and continued talking with his date, Tony couldn’t made up what they were talking, he was a little far from them; but they seemed cozy, and more importantly Mr. Rogers looked happy, genuinely pleased for the company of the other woman.
Though, Steve missed his friend and those silly calls the genius sometimes did when he wasn’t in the complex improving their gadgets; his lame jokes that Tony didn’t recognize as bad, the crazy ideas of outings for bonding, and their own get together in some restaurants in New York.
He was so tired of fighting; Tony sometimes cached himself wishing that instead of hitting the arc reactor Steve had hit his skull or destroyed his trachea with his shield. He knew that it was the depression talking, but it was a current theme since Afghanistan.
Just like hundreds of others, people with super powers, normal people…all of them inspired thanks to them to do the right thing. Some of the positive things that the Avengers achieved and Tony was proud of.
Tony didn’t write that he forgave Steve, but he put on paper something that it was almost like forgiveness.
Jarvis was not amused when Tony returned two hours after with Buddy, neither were Rhodey and Pepper. He forgot to inform them that he had found Buddy.
His wrist hurts and Steve’s name feels a little hot, Tony nods to the pilot and goes to Vienna with Natasha, he sees the news in the middle of the flight.
But Steve lied to him…to ‘protect’ him he said, and didn’t it was so deliciously ironic?, it wasn’t what started all the Ultron debacle for him. Was trust not what Steve demanded that time? He knew since then the fucking hypocrite; who gave him the power to decide what he could or couldn’t know?
Tony glared at the cellphone for minutes here and there and asked himself about the reason of why Rogers sent him that. He had read the letter a couple of times, more like hundreds of times, but he didn’t dare to believe what the missive said.
“I’m training them, and they were smart” Tony said proudly scratching behind Bailey’s ears, to her delight. Buddy was doing and excellent impression of a leech onto Jarvis’ legs demanding attention.
They lived to serve them, those who had to rely in their powers…so those who had the experience need to be in control; not some loose canon like Tony Stark. The UN needed to put in charge someone with experience like him, General Ross, he who had the temple to follow the Accords as it said, without all that sentimentality that the law mustn’t have.
Tony saw the accords as both: as a form of accountability and as a form of protection for them. It’s practically impossible battled without some form of collateral damage. A lot of ‘super’ ‘enhanced’ humans begun to pop everywhere, some of them with the right motivation but without training making them just as dangerous as the super villains they fight for the people they swore to protect.
“This is for you, something old that was Howard’s cufflinks and something borrowed my favorite pin tie the one that you called obnoxious with his red and gold colors, good luck Steve and I’m sorry”
Tony was so out it that he didn’t hear when another person was talking to him trying to gain his attention. He just grunted.
“My mom played the piano, she was a prodigious without doubt, she played for me when I had nightmares, also when she was happy or I’d bugged her enough to play for me” he said with a small smile and subdued tone, “She also taught me how to play, I was not as good as her but well…I loved her and I hate that I couldn’t tell her that before her death…she deserved to feel loved, I wish that that day I stopped her from going with Howard and I hate myself for that too”
“I know that you only were doing your work taking care of me, but I couldn’t help feeling like this, I, I love you Tony…and I don’t want you to leave my side, but I also don’t want you to feel unhappy”
Steve touches his right wrist where Tony’s name is tattooed into his soul, he has always liked to trace it with his fingers (something that he discovered share with his soulmate) the movement and the familiar pattern of Tony’s penmanship kept Steve calm and helped him to concentrate.
Now his nightmares included Tony dying by his hand. He could see himself lowering his shield with all his force to an unprotected throat, the sickening sound of bones breaking and the vibranium hitting the floor; he watched the blood flowing and Tony’s lifeless eyes judging him.
He was so lost in his thoughts that he didn’t hear his cellphone; it was until the last moment that he accepted the call.
They were still the safest option, they knew about their weakness and how to calm each other in case of emergency. As a team they could go to missions where they were needed without waiting a committee giving them the order and with that losing the lifes they were supposed to protect.
No, Tony was so much more…but Steve lost it when he saw the unibeam tore Bucky’s arm; then his hits were less controlled and with much more power behind each of them, he didn’t stopped until Tony was on the floor and he could see his face. Steve saw the terror reflected on Tony’s eyes and he didn’t stopped it until the last moment when his shield almost went to his lover’s throat. He hit the reactor instead, but as he also Tony could see the original trajectory…it was when Tony’s eyes turned blank and almost immediately full of hate.
think, even if DUM-E kind of act like a puppy, but the bot didn’t need much care. However, he still didn’t regret to have picked them up, not when Bailey and Buddy looked at him with those eyes filled with affection, not even when DUM-E was so damn exited seeing his new little friends ¾and if he record it with his phone, anyone but him would ever know¾ and tried to douse them with the fire extinguisher.
Now he would have to wait in the car while his boss ended enamoring another person that was not he, and possible driving them to the nearest hotel.
And Tony was, well, Tony; that means that he didn’t have any possibility, even if he managed to talk with Steve without putting his foot in his mouth.
’ before he returned to the boarding school, the afternoons in front of the piano with him most of the time hearing his mother playing while laying in the divan or him learning to play with her agile hands guiding his clumsy ones. Maria Stark consisted in moments all of them so precious.
are the halves of one soul something like the Accords can’t be more powerful than their love (the will of people with hidden Agendas).
“Stark likes to play being God and deciding what it’s the best for everyone, without hearing our opinions with him backstabbing his teammates without care” Clint said bitterly, “Didn’t really surprise me that he is still promoting those damn Accords”
“And for your information, I had never made peace with their death, with my Mom’s death; I’ve always blamed Dad for her death now I know that he didn’t kill her driving drunk it was just for being with him, that’s something I guess”
So Tony kind of understand where Steve is coming from with Barnes, but Tony will never forgive himself that in doing that he hurts innocents of put them in risk…Also, Rhodey will never forgive him too.
“Too late I’m already working on that…so tell me Ross what do you really want? You’re with the UN, you expect something from us for this ‘help’”
But he knew the answer, because after all Iron Man was an Avenger just like the rest of them, and if they could not be a team
He hugged him like when he founded him in Afghanistan and Tony felt safe like that time, because Rhodey was on his side and if someone know about doing the things right it was his best friend.
Some of them wanted to remain anonymous, something Tony was sure General Ross would not approve. But at the end, the Secretary of Defense was not a member of the UN, Tony would sure as hell revoke any position of power from this man on their Initiative.
“Don’t worry, also don’t make that call, you could drive” Rogers said smiling, “I have to return to the office to sign more paperwork, haven’t I?”
Sighing he decided on walking, he was already drenched so even if he did not find refuge, he would reach his apartment. At least his house was only a couple of blocks more.
Anthony Edward Stark, all in capital letters with his other half penmanship…the same mark that appeared in his eight’s birthday.
“Sorry Johnson, but it can’t be, without Tony I couldn’t last a day…he is very competent” Mr. Rogers said with a forced smile, “forget it and come in, we will discuss now whatever have you preoccupied and couldn’t wait to the next meeting”
Bucky Barnes’ face is in all the news, the count of deaths is rising and General Cross is filling his voice mail with angry demands for information. He closes his eyes and breathing is difficult, he waits for something but nothing comes from Steve’s end not anger or hurt and it scares shitless Tony.
