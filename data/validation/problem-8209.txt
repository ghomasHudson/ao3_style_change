“That… is a pretty good idea, actually.”
Green was an ugly colour on him. He had no right to be jealous, he was still close friends with both Tony
Tony grinned devilishly, before reading out the instructions to Clint.

“Oh, nah, do you know how many times we all had to evacuate our dorms in college because
A few hours later, when they didn’t come down for dinner, no one bothered to disturb them. Steve didn’t need anything else that moment anyway, peppering kisses across Tony’s face as they led in his bed, sheets tangled between their bare legs.

as well?”
“Yeah?”
walk on eggshells with her. Even Clint, when she first met him, had taken a little bit of time to adjust to her. They’d worked up to a point in their friendship where they could banter with one another. But Tony had come right out the gate with it as soon as she was properly introduced to him as Natasha, not Natalie. Even back then, dying and reckless and just a fucking
Steve shook his head, an easy smile breaking out across his face. God love them, they were all so stupid.
“You’re even

“After the next round of fire, we need to make a run for it. We won’t have another shot after that.”
“Right, mechanic.” He wet his lips, “I know you’re important to me, I just don’t know why.”
buy it-”
Panic swelled in Tony’s chest, and he scrambled towards Steve’s body, hauling the larger man into his arms as the downed bots began to beep expectantly. Tony dragged Steve’s body, occasionally using the last drops of energy in his suit to push them forward - towards the abandoned office building opposite them, carrying him deep into the building. They collapsed in an ungrateful heap, and Tony turned back in time to see the small red lights on the bots flash angrily for a second before the beeping came to a halt, and the bots blew up spectacularly in the streets. But Tony wasn’t filled with the usual relief that came at the end of a battle, as debris rained down from the outside of the building, collapsing in on the entrance, trapping the pair inside.
Steve spun around at the commotion, gun raised, before lowering it when he saw Tony. Tony was leapt down from a hight like a bat out of hell and sent himself and - and a hydra agent (how did he miss that, damn it?) skidding across the clearing.
“You know, Rogers, if this is some backward-ass way of apologising, just drop it, okay? We were fine! Why did you have to bring it up, like I’m not fucking embarrassed about it? Get over yourself, Jesus,
“Stayin’ alive, stay- alive,” the words escaped his lips in a whisper, barely forming in his mouth.
“Hey listen man, I know I fucked up back there, I didn’t pan it all the way through. It
“Okay, yeah, alright - I’m not actually as competent as I pretend to be when it comes to super-spy training.”
Three days ago, after a particularly gruelling mission against a horde of alien creatures, the team had been blindsided by an attack from a group of former Hydra agents, gone rogue trying to establish their own little cohort of baddies. They hadn’t even been on the Avengers’ radar. S.H.I.E.L.D was supposedly on their trail, but clearly underestimated the group’s abilities. Both Nat and Tony had been injured in their last fight - no more so than normal, but enough that they weren’t equipped for an ambush. They’d been drugged and hauled out of there before the others had even known they were in trouble.
They were both getting hits in, but overall both had been dodging the others’ attacks well. Clint was pushing Tony, Steve could tell, clearly just as interested to see what Tony had apparently been holding back. But since when could Tony-
The rest of them slowly joined them, and they lead under the stars of the Moroccan sky, feeling lighter than any of them had in a long time, and it wasn’t just because of the pot.
coffee all day), gradually leaning his head against Steve’s shoulder.
Maybe it was the warm air surrounding them, or the alcohol swimming through his system, but Steve languidly curled an arm round Tony’s shoulders. The brunette didn’t seem to think much of it, as Steve suspected - it was a common way they all treated each other, it was friendly. Taking a hesitant breath in, Steve slid the arm down until it settled over Tony’s narrow waist, and he resolutely looked at the sea in front of him - his stomach churning like the waves below.
Nat was quiet for a moment before she got to her feet and stood in front of Tony. Determined, she grabbed his wrists and pulled him up so they stood eye-to-eye. He gave a small smirk, but rather than exuding his usual charm, it just seemed so uncharacteristically unsure.
With that, Clint surged down the rest of the slope - Rhodey having already dropped Tony after the archer came sprinting at them - as the brunette scrambled back up in the sand, running from the archer cackling madly.

), and were comfortably chatting in various places in the living room.
-?!” Tony was growing hostile now, walls coming up to mask any hurt he was feeling.
This time it was Sam that cut him off, “I don’t regret doing it, hell, I know it was going to shit before I went and broke my damn arm, but still, I held you and Buck back. Pro'ly would’ve gone better if I landed right but,” Sam hissed as Steve wrapped up his injured arm, but carried on a beat later, seemingly ignoring what was bound to be an apology from Steve, “but, like I said, I’m not going to be sorry for saving your ass - again.”
Nerves hit Steve like a train. “Are you
“The coughing-up blood thing? Yeah, not what you thought it was. It’s not bleeding in your lungs, but looks like you’re bleeding internally somewhere else. Nothing much,” Tony added when Sam turned to took at the two of the with wide, concerned eyes, “probably just knocked something on the impact, but take it easy, y'know, in case.”
The group paused their eating to look at Bruce, who had opened up the dishwasher to get another glass for the juice which was rapidly declining among them.
“No, no! I’m not laughing
Infiltrating a Hyrda research base never was a picnic, especially since unlike some of their other foes – namely AIM, Hydra seemed to actually learn from their mistakes.
“God, no - it’s not even… it’s stupid.”
It seemed none of the others had cottoned on to the shift in their dynamic, but slowly the bickering became some odd form of flirting, the the shouting matches - which, granted, were far less frequent now - left them both leaving for air, feeling hot and tense, fisting their hands by their sides to stop themselves reaching out and just grabbing for one another.
Steve didn’t dare breathe.
Nabokov had been an agent inside of SHIELD, had access to security footage from every facility, including any places the team chose to grieve. SHIELD had let him watch, lured him out of the shadows just to gloat.
Steve eyed the brunette dubiously, “That’s not how a functional family operates, Tony.”
“You know I am.”
Once the gunfire subsided, Nat looked up into the dense treeline a short distance from the run-down army base these agents had set up camp. Raising their guns, they both poked out above their shelter, shooting back. They managed to clip a few agents, but handguns were only so good at long-distance. They ducked back down, both grunting at the exertion.
living with men?”
“I could wing-woman you, y’know,” she suggested, raising an eyebrow at him, “It’s not like you don’t get hit on every time we come here.”
“Wow- I’ve never seen the reactor before, only specs from your papers…” came Jane’s voice from beside him, as she perched on Thor’s shoulders. He gently put her down next to his smaller friend, smiling, letting her inquisitive nature get a better look.
“Okay,” Steve rubbed a hand across the nape of his neck, “I wanted to talk to you about something if that’s okay?”
“Didn’t say you were, Stark.” He said, mostly to himself. Since the ordeal with the accords, the team had shoddily come back together for ‘the greater-good’, as out by Agent Hill. Hydra may have crawled back into the shadows they had come from, but they were certainly no-less of a threat than they had been before. If anything, their recent losses to Cap and his team made them itching to strike back, harder and more efficiently. Steve was so tired of fighting them, a bone-deep kind of tired that permanently was etched into his features.
“Wait, that wasn’t part of this…this bullshit-lie, you were
Bucky smile cut short when he saw the concern etched into Natasha’s delicate features, looking at Tony who hadn’t responded once. The gap made by the hulk was big enough for the medics to get  a pair of gurney’s in. Steve was hoisted onto one, his head rolling side to side as he furrowed his brow, muttering something about being fine, while Natasha rolled Tony over.
“Was I the only one that noticed?” Tony asked casually, not taking his eyes of the projection, which he was currently trying to decode with lightning-fast finger strokes.
“Uh… I spoke to Clint about…
“It was necessary, only myself, agent Romanoff and Barnes could know Captain Rogers’ status. We were tracing a
“What’s the second row say?” Clint asked, stirring the pot in front of him.
Natasha sighed, “I figured as much,” she hissed as Tony gently dabbed at the wound clean with an anti-bacterial wipe they’d plundered from the rather underwhelming first-aid kit they’d found in the bathroom. “God, you
he didn’t say. “I don’t have many good ones, you never sit still long enough!”
“You’re going to be the death of me, Tony Stark,” there was anxiety in his tone, but he seemed comfortable enough that Tony could stay. They were in a hospital room after all, just not Tony’s.
“I mean, cool, you kissed Steve-”
When Steve first met the man, he was fooled by the charismatic demeanour he threw over all of their eyes; but after living with the guy for a few months and seeing his guard slowly lower down, he let his quirks show.
I hate to look into those eyes
Soundlessly, the three of them got up and crept across the floor of the cabin, Bucky nudging Steve awake as he did so, bringing a finger to his lips when Steve eyed him curiously and was about to speak up. Steve clearly sensed something was wrong too, and joined Natasha in looking carefully out the window through the drapes, riddled with holes and frayed at the tips.
“Light?” He mumbled round the blunt between his lips, and Steve moved his hand into his pocket, suddenly very aware of his own tongue. He cleared his throat and pulled out a lighter, holding it to the joint at Tony’s lips.
Clint couldn’t sleep, being away from home got to him a lot lately. God, he missed them all. He’d wondered in the dark room, hands shoved awkwardly in his pockets, reminiscing of more comfortable times.
“Would like to say it’s fine, but, shit if it doesn’t make wanna make me throw up!” Sam laughed shakily, earning a smile from the older man in return. Sam and Rhodey had gotten on like house on fire before the accords, both being military men through and through. Sure, Rogers was too, but after many a late night at college with a seventeen year-old Tony Stark drunkenly ranting about never being good enough for 'Dear-Old Dad’, and then catching wind of what was said on the helical river of their first meeting, Rhodey was less inclined to like the Captain. Yes, it was mildly petty of him but damn that man for making his best friend feel so small. He’d worked very hard to get that out of him over the years, thank you very much,
She merely cocked an eyebrow at him. It was like she knew what he was thinking - was in his head, running circles around him. That woman was an anomaly to him, totally unpredictable, unreadable - perhaps the only person he’d ever met that made him feel exposed. Even when he wore a mask - literally and figuratively.
Natasha nodded and made her way to the door. Thor got up to do the same when Tony tried to get up again, until his friend gave him a stern look that made him settle back down.
. She made his mind roll over, but each time it came up blank.
“Well, it was that or be shot, and I know how tedious you find bullet wounds.”
“I’ll take your word for it, itsy-bitsy.”
, at Steve. The blonde didn’t try and hide his crooked, nervous smile, or the way his shoulders were slightly hunched, making him look smaller.
“Oh yeah, so selfish.
- and he looked to find Natasha peering over to look at the contents of the pan.
“I’ll call down Doctor Banner and the rest of the gang,”
Tony ignored the way Steve’s Brooklyn drawl made his heart flutter because dammit he hasn’t felt that way since Before™. Tony was at a loss for words for a moment before his mouth came up with
An hour before that Clint and Sam had been exchanging quips, keeping up morale. Though at this point, no amount of familiar banter could distract any of them from the fact that the longer they were out here uncovered, the worse off they’d be.
Steve was glad they’d decided on a lake that was safe to swim in because, by
“I’m an Avenger too, fatal injury or no fatal injury!” Tony called out to Thor’s retreating form, who turned mid walk, grinning at him,
Still not ready to confront that.
Natasha gave a confirming nod and slipped out the door, ready to track down Steve and Bucky to relay the information. They’d need them there to defend the room.
“It’s like a hundred degrees right now, Tones, you really not getting in the water?” Sam asked, plonking himself down on the towel next to Tony, who was watching the others toss each other over into the waves.
Steve took a rattling breath in, before signing and closing his eyes. Bucky leant forward, momentarily concerned, when Steve spoke up.
The battle had been going on for six hours.
“Well - theres that,” the archer mused, the corner of his lip turning upwards, “But I mean, if the base was so important, why didn’t they get more backup out there after the first strike? Why was it so… deserted, almost, the second time we -
“It hit you.
“What-”
“Alright.”
An hour or so in, and Thor was out, having lost all his chips. Jane rubbed Thor’s massive arm consoling while he pouted. Half an hour later, and Bruce had conceded , though he looked very amused and kept casting glances at Tony, who - fair play to the man - was exceptional. A few minutes later, Natasha also ducked out the game, an air of understanding between him and Bruce. Rhodey hadn’t even joined in the first place, instead choosing to overlook the whole game with an observant gaze.
Aesthetically, Tony was absolutely beautiful. But in the past couple of became harder and harder not to notice the little quirks of the man’s personality. He cared for those around him fiercely, it drove his ambition - developing ways to help them, to keep them safe. Contrary to his initial beliefs, the man was anything but selfish - he was selfless, and under the bravado, he cared frighteningly little about his own wellbeing.
As soon as she spoke, Tony had decoded the file, which exploded into hundreds of top secret documents, all of which had been produced in the last six months.
From where he stood, Steve couldn’t see what, but he could see blood, and the way Tony’s hands shook as we went for a bottle of ethanol he’d brought with him to the table. Steve often wondered why Nat seemed so easygoing with Stark, and eventually Steve caught on to the fact the two were remarkably similar in a number of ways. For one, they both chewed out the others for hiding any injuries, taking the responsibility of making them better into their own hands, but then slinking off to lick their own wounds in private.
the best part!”
Tony and Steve just laughed as a collective shout of disbelief sounded from the kitchen, save from Bucky and Rhodey, who just hollered suggestively, whistling and howling from their positions I front of the TV.
Steve was panting, shoulders heaving with adrenaline and fists clenching and unclenching as he caught his breathe. Tony kicked himself internally for not coming out sooner, since they clearly had needed the extra support. Steve was tired, which said a hell of a fucking lot about the current mess they were in.
pretty.
Tony winced as turned back to the monitors, stitching on the device and getting to work on the coding. He’d memorised the digits needed to send Fury a direct signal in code, he’d done it enough times.
Tony scoffed “W-o-w,” he drew out, “Carrying your limp body through the woods and to our lord-and-saviour Jim not enough for you?” He was already helping her up, manoeuvring them both to the only bed in the place.
They heaved a collective sigh of relief (well, in Clint’s case, wheeze of relief) when Nat announced she spotted what looked like a shack of some kind. Any form of shelter was welcome at this point, they’d just been following a sparse amount of trees in the landscape hoping to end up near water. Usually by water there was some form of civilisation. The trees had grown more concentrated in the lead up to the cabin as it turned out to be, and Steve’s heavy footsteps where all anyone could hear as they all waited at the foot of the cabin, waiting for their Glorious Leader to pry it open.
“Tasha!” The archer squawked, looking offended as he scurried down to catch up with her, ignoring the snickers coming from Bucky and Sam from beside her.
“No, he didn’t,” Steve admitted to himself, “he was pulling his punches - he, he could’ve shot you with that missile, instead he just used to to trap you. He showed us mercy, despite-” Steve glanced up at Tony, gazing at the smaller man, striding forwards determinedly.
“Always thinking of little old me, hm?” Bruce teased, pushing down the nerves that came with the image of his two friends almost being killed like that.
comment was. Sam just looked between Steve and Bucky, frowning at the way Steve looked like he’d just been told something utterly horrendous and the way Bucky was shooting him a look of utter disbelief.
Natasha asked the doctor if she could do it instead, staring Tony down, eliciting a nervous twitch from Tony. The doctor merely snorted and carried on - Nat hadn’t been serious anyway, but the threat carried through.
“I’ve never been more excited to have a shower,” Tony sighed, watching as the jet settled onto the ground amongst a large clearing not far off from their cabin.
“Well call for the team in the morning since the only phone around here is probably in that reception building.”
“Yes,” Tony said after a while, voice shaken and nit sounding too convinced.
“You draw me?”
With Nat’s experience, it really wasn’t hard to reach through the bars and snap the neck of their guard while Tony picked the lock. Nor was it that difficult picking up extra tactical gear and weapons and storming their way out, scrapping with any agents who got in their way. What had made it more of a nuisance was the fact they were handcuffed together with reinforced cuffs that looked suspiciously like S.H.I.E.L.D’s design for supersoldier-proof restraints. Not to mention they still hadn’t properly treated any of their injuries - Nat still had a slight limp after sustaining a minor stab wound to her thigh (Clint would probably yell at her for calling any stab wound
Steve leaned in the last few inches, pressing his smile against Tony’s. They kissed slowly, intimately, and so gently, as if scared the other person would suddenly realise what was happening and jerk away.
Of course, not all of them would be going. Sam and Clint still had broken bones, and Rhodey needed more time between missions than the others at the moment; field work was out of the question. Instead, they would stay at the farm, sifting through the data and using their resources to see if they could find any leads on this rumoured vault Hydra had been infatuated in for over seventy years.
Tony looked momentarily hurt, before Steve signed and lifted his own covers.
Clearly it was, because the tension from Tony’s shouldered rolled off, and he gave a tentative smile.
“We didn’t do it in the kitchen!” Steve blurt out, dragging a hand over his face.
hard to keep himself busy, to not let his thoughts get away with him as to why they would be sleeping in for so long and
“Give up now. Many have tried, it’s futile.”
Tony, aside from decking the guy, was shaking with anger; eyes glossed over and knuckles white.
“I can’t believe you made it out of scraps, it’s impossible - I had such a science-crush-thing on you when I read about it,” Tony’s gaze snapped up to meet Thor’s, hand reflexively coming around his one throat to protect it. Thor’s faux-storm gaze cracked into a large shit-eating grin, and he clapped the brunette on the shoulder.
Steve and Natasha got to work searching for possible food in the kitchenette, while Bucky and Clint lead Sam to one of the sofas. Clint sat himself down with a groan, and Tony silently perched on the arm of the sofa, gently prying away the archer’s vest to get a better look at his damaged ribs. Rhodey shut the door once everyone was inside, and noticed the small fireplace tucked behind one of the sofas. Bucky noticed too, and the two silently pushed the sofa into another position so they could access the fireplace, then began searching for anything they could burn. After all, Inside or not, it was
Steve sat up, gently helping Tony into a sitting position, smiling at him sweetly.
Steve sprung upwards, ready to jump in to get Tony, when a stiffness overtook his body. It froze his arms at his side, he grit his teeth and trying to surge forwards, only to be betrayed by his own two feet, which were currently digging his heels into the ground.
Hydra weren’t incompetent, they knew how to launch an attack. Agents had hounded on each division of the team like a pack of ravenous dogs. By now, they knew what to expect from the Avengers, and were merciless with their approach. Rhodey and Tony had been disabled by an intense EMP developed for their suits especially, delivering excruciating electrical shocks through them, weighed down by motionless tonnes of metal. Sam had a clean break to his arm, and Clint wheezed with each step he took. Possible broken ribs, Steve had thought - praying it wasn’t a punctured lung too. Himself and Bucky weren’t badly off, though both exhausted enough that the trek in the middle of knee-deep snow was taking its toll. Besides, neither of them had particularly fond memories of the ice.
Everyone else was enjoying it, oblivious to the fact Steve just couldn’t get
“Just, I don’t know… side streets are more…” Tony waved a hand round, as if trying to will an excuse to himself, “…
“No, no you need to get us somewhere we can stay for the night, with a phone,” she mumbled, trying as best as she could to enunciate properly. “Drop us off somewhere, then go home - and make sure no one follows you. There are…” her head dropped for a second, and Tony was at her side instantly, gently leaning her back “We don’t want you in any sort of harm's way”.
Natasha tossed him a look that screamed really, and crouched down next to her friend. Sam took it as his cue to get back in the water, muttering something about thinking this kind of thing would be over after high school.
“Decided not to go for the hot pants in the end, huh, Sam?” Clint quipped, settling his hands on his hips.
“Nat being one, I suppose.”
, and things went to shit. He heard a spectacular whine from behind him, turning just in time to see an immense electrical pulse slam into Steve’s skull. The stubborn jackass only stood back up shakily, fists raised - as if he were a skinny kid from Brooklyn all over again, standing up to the latest bully in the back-alley of a movie theatre. The Doombot swung a heavy metal fist in an uppercut, which Steve only just managed to block. The impact left him dazed though, and he was oblivious to another bot approaching behind, bringing down it’s fist with a sickening crack over Steve’s head.
Steve sighed, stepping further into the room until he was leant against the table, Tony pointedly not looking at him.
Tony looked beautiful, his eyes glistening in the moonlight, soft curls of hair stroking the nape of his neck and flopping over his eyes. He smelled of sea-salt and vanilla, his bare feet hung over the balcony as he sat in shorts and an oversized t-shirt that read The Runaways across the front.
Clint snapped out his thoughts when Steve worked up the nerve to speak again.
Moments ago, it had been just playful banter – nothing too complex or witty, they were all too tired for that.
“Wait – you’re over me?”
And that’s when Rhodey began to play.
because then I don’t feel like such a dumbass.”
The man looked at them through his rear-view mirror, recognition creeping across his face. Tony’s albeit overgrown goatee, Nat’s fiery red hair, and the sheer amount of weapons they’d managed to strap onto themselves started to paint the picture. Despite knowing they probably needed medical attention, when an Avenger tells you you could be in danger for helping them, you’re more than inclined to just do what you can then get the hell out of there, no questions asked.
They both knew it wasn’t true, and they both decidedly didn’t mention it.
Tony watched the steady rise and fall of Steve’s chest, vaguely aware of a grumble outside, the crack of rock and cement being hauled to the ground, before he closed his burning eyes, feeling fait relief before his mind swum backwards impossibly far, and abandoned him in nothingness.
Thor was beaming at hims he strode across the living room, nodding a thanks to Laura and Clint as they welcomed the rest of their team inside their home.
Steve’s voice had risen beyond a stern to full out yelling, earning a few concerned stares through the door from passers-by. The door mysteriously closed, and Steve sighed. One of the team must of closed it, meaning all of them were listening in.
Money wasn’t a problem for Tony, but that didn’t mean he didn’t understand the problems it made for other people, so, he did things like that fairly often, though always under the radar.
- got in,” he amended himself, recalling the fact his ribs were too broken to actually go out into the field the second time.
The team were all settled on a quinjet in far better shape than their current one, trashed in the middle of some Norwegian wilderness. Bucky considered Natasha carefully as the woman sat next to him, filling with the chamber of her gun.
“How long you been able to speak Italian anyway, man?” Clint ventured, peeling cloves of garlic and crushing them under the blade of a knife.
“Heard there was a situation, I ain’t got guns like Thor but I got ones better than his.” he added playfully nodding at Bucky - who snorted in response, though the effect was dampened by how tired he sounded. Sam began digging alongside Nat, noting her discomfort
“Not that Clint told me, or anything,” she shrugged lamely, taking her cue to guide Cooper and Lila out of the room, tossing a playful smirk at her husband, who just shook his head fondly.
“-Please don’t finish that sentence until I don’t feel nauseous anymore, Christ,”
Steve was led on the ice, unmoving but hyper-aware of his surroundings. In his line of sight, Tony was straddling an agent, both of whom were frozen mid-scramble. Natasha raised her gun, reading herself to take the shot if the agent tried anything smart, when the ice cracked - echoing around the small valley they were in, before crunching and collapsing, dropping Tony and the lackey into the inky-black waters below.
She smiled at him, giving him one more pat on the shoulder before taking a seat. Tony sat down next to her, pushing one of the mugs in front of her.
Steve pulled Tony’s face towards his own, pressing their lips together harshly. The Captain ran his hands down Tony’s body, trailing from his cheeks to his hips, using them to pull the other man flush up against him; Tony moaned, running his hands over the expanse of Steve’s shoulders, letting the larger man push him back against the surface, climbing over him and deepening the kiss.
“No, that's not it. Try again,
- she supposed there would be a slight awkwardness. Not so much on her part, she didn’t really care when it came to her team; she knew them more than they probably knew themselves and
“I guess? But it’s not set in stone.”
They eventually reached the base, only visible by a few bunkers inconspicuously poking up through the snow. They were concealed as old war bunkers, but Steve had studied the layout religiously, and recognised which one was a concealed entrance.
Steve was a little worried; Tony had admittedly been slacking off when it came to training. It had only been going on for two weeks or so, so he hadn’t really felt it necessary to bring up just yet. But if his performance was off today, it would give Steve the opportunity to suggest coming back to more regular sparring sessions that didn’t involve the whole team.
“Come on, really?”
Inside it was dark, filled with a few bookshelves, but namely a large sofa some of them occasionally used to read on.
“The Runaways - why the hell is Tony’s shirt on the street?” The man questioned, looking bewildered. Rhodey’s eyes widened, and he resisted the urge to burst into laughter. Son-of-a-bitch actually did it. He kept his mouth shut.
“What, no - why did you even ask that-?!”
Tony and Bucky sipped at their tea, resolutely not looking at each other, before Bucky opened his mouth, mumbling into his drink, “'Back at you, Cap’?
“You’re jealous of Nat? For...
“Its… its barely anything, we just…”
After hastily retrieving the data they had come for, they withdrew to the quinjet. The jet wasn’t much better off than they were, and in the mist of the battle, they hadn’t noticed a one piece of critical information.
“She not responding at all?” Sam asked warily, eyeing his friend from where he sat next to Tony.
Suddenly, she was jolted by Tony straightening up. Lifting her chin up off her chest (
than he had been before.
“I mean, I draw.”
Tony plucked himself out of Steve’s grip, who apparently locked his arms around his waist in his sleep. Steve’d never do that consciously, surely (right?). Looking down fondly at the blonde, the hairs on the back of Tony’s neck stood up suddenly, sending chill down his spine - not a pleasant one, either. Glancing around the room, Tony took a sudden intake of breath when he noticed Barnes had silently gotten up too, looking alarmingly alert for such an ungodly hour in the morning.
She takes me away to that special place
The room was cast in a brilliant blue, swimming in projections of blue-prints, transcripts, photographs of mission sites, of them, of Hydra’s top agents, of Pierce’s scheme, of the Winter Soldier. Steve and Bucky involuntarily stepped back slightly, as if avoiding being struck by a hologram - knowing full well it would merely phrase through them, made solely of light.
“Stark- Tony, it’s not that you aren’t capable-”
“Well we didn’t actually

, when she looked at him, but he hadn’t placed his finger on what it was and where it came from.
he was so pretty. He was too occupied trying not to stare at the other man’s lips that he didn’t notice how Steve’s smile began to look a little stiffer.
Barnes’ mouth was set in a thin line, barely making a sound as he breathed. He’s listening for something, Tony realised, when a noise outside drew his attention towards to door. He almost didn’t hear it, but a rustle of movement beside him and Nat was now wide awake too.
“Well- I know what you
“You just failed t'mention, right?” Bucky said, voice eerily calm.
“You stretched that out on purpose, Romanoff,” Tony’s voice accused her, though was sorted with the tone of fond amusement wrapped around it.
“Yes - thank you for asking
“Okay, I gotta know - how drunk did you two get to actually sleep with each other?” The man asked incredulously, earning a few curious looks from the others.
you look ugly.”
“No, no, sorry, I’m just playing around,” the brunette smiled, looking up at Steve now. His hair was dishevelled from where he’d obviously been running his hands through it, dressed down in one of his oversized sweatshirt and sweatpants.
guys). It was like the usual context of a man and woman sharing a bed - no matter how ridiculous said ‘context’ is - hadn’t even crossed his mind. She guessed she understood, in a way, not that he would know why; the only time she’d ever felt that awkward tension was when sharing a bed with women, particularly women she found attractive-
a bitch while they’re piecing you back together, the nerve-”
Between them and the ladder escalating to the exit, was an experienced-looking agent. He’d clearly anticipated which exit they were headed too, and decided to take them down himself.
“They recently began to make ground in Siberia, after the programme was dug-up again,” the brunette said, mind going a mile a minute.
. But, God, I’ve just been kidding myself, and when Sam told me they were dating I realised-”
Tony noticed he did that a lot. Rarely accepting a compliment or anything of the sort, so he’d started lingering back too, helping the soldier with his pottering around. Rather than verbalising these things so much, Tony found himself returning the little favours. He hoped the other man saw it for what it was, as a thank you, but even if he hadn’t caught on, the smile of appreciation he always sent Tony’s way was more than worth it.
- I just thought since you two were so close, and I was
“No! Ah, no, actually, I was… I was actually waiting for you,”
“…right?” Tony winced, before shooting out of his seat when Bucky lunged at him from across the table, much to Thor’s delight, as he boomed with laughter.
mean?” Clint asked, squinting at the cook-book lead out in front of him. It was written in Italian, which Clint claimed was the only way to cook authentic Italian food.
“Huh, why’s it look all funny like that then?” Clint asked, feigning genuine curiosity. Sam merely rolled his eyes, nonchalantly taking his right combat boot off to throw at the archer’s head.
Tony shook his head at her, holding back a smile, before nodding seriously. “Fine, I’ll assist you in your cheap shot at illustriousness.”
“No one except Rhodey and I even know you’re bi, and he doesn’t even know you like Steve, so don’t panic.” She levelled him with a sympathetic look, “We both know none of them would have any sort of issue with us if we came out to them, logically, of course-”
“I tried to tell the surgeons not to bother with it - your liver that is - hardly valuable, damaged beyond repair. Definitely wouldn’t be worth the trouble. They neglected to listen to me.”
, the tiniest smirk on her face.
“Ugh, please stop doing that”
“You son-of-a-bitch, Stark,” Bucky muttered, folding his hands back against his neck in defeat.
“Nothing? You mean I
“Nat… you
The room hung in a contemplative silence, before Tony spoke up, leaving across the table intently.
. Remember the first real lead we got, it was right after he made Bruce hulk out,”
So as unpredictable as the guy was, they had come to be able to predict that he would do unexpected things.
Oh God, Steve didn’t think he’d ever laughed this hard.
“You’re precious.”
“Yes, dear?”
“But, there are four couches, and most if the guys have taken them, then your buddies - Wilson and Barnes, they’re in the spare room round the front of the house, then theres the girls, in the other one-”
As per most evenings - when they managed to catch a break from superheroing, that is - the team were gathered on the communal floor, transfixed on whatever film they’d settled on this time. Steve had already forgotten the name, only vaguely aware of the general plot - some zombie comedy Thor had declared was his favourite film. Though he did say that about most films, so it really wasn’t an accurate measure of how great it was.
The others filed into the room, taking up respective places, perched on windowsills, plastic chairs, and at the foot of the bed. As the others joked around, throwing pizza crusts at Steve when he got doe-eyed, Tony settled back against Steve’s chest, and smiled.
Steve inwardly grimaced at himself. He was being bitter and petty, he knew that. But he couldn’t figure out
When Steve and Bucky stood through the door, Sam glared back at them. Shaking his head, he took one last glance outside, and tentatively shut the door. Rhodey had thrown more paper onto the fire, and Tony was set down in front of it. He was dripping wet, and Rhodey threw blanket after blanket over his friend. Bucky lingered back, until Sam approached his side.
“No, Tony,” Steve huffed around a smile, “I mean, I haven’t been totally honest with you,”
” He grumbled, swaying on Steve’s shoulders, before sighing and pushing up on Steve’s head, coming to a shakey balance stood on the man’s broad shoulders. Reaching up, he pulled himself up through the hole he’d created, shimmying into the ventilation tunnel it had revealed.
“You know they did - you did see what they did to the place, right?” Clint laughed, while Rhodey stood in the middle of the room, despite their being plenty of seats.
“...No.”
And if he also happened to loiter behind as well because it gave him more alone-time with Steve, then frankly that was his business. Also because he could pinch some of the leftovers Clint always put aside.
“Cheating is a dirty word, I prefer… Manipulating the situation to my advantage,”
“We were just kissing, for christ’s sake!”
“So you’re gay?”
When they descended the stairs into the kitchen in the morning, they were met by a sea of mischievous smiles.
“...Yep.”
“For me?”
Tony froze before looking,
“So I’m a lesbian.”
“No,” Steve smiled, resigned in a way Tony didn’t quite pick up on, “No I really didn’t.”
“-Clint, for the love of-!”
Tony shook off the remains of his armour and the dust settled around them, ignoring the steady drip of blood down his own body, and leant over Steve’s unconscious form. Propping the man’s legs upwards, Tony then cradled Steve’s blanched face in the palms of his hands.
The room settled into a comfortable silence, only interrupted by the scrape of cutlery against the various pots and pans they ate from.
“You better have some decent food for me in that other pocket, Cap,” Nat quipped.
“You’re such a brat, my Ma would’a slapped me up the side of my head if I sat on her kitchen tops.”
After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, the doctor finished redoing the stitches Tony pulled, then applying a fresh gauze over them, secured with a bandage wrapped tightly round his torso. She took off her gloves, balling them up to throw away into the biohazard bin, and said casually without looking up once, “If you touch those again I’ll kick you out and leave you to bleed on on the curb. You’re not making a mess in my medical suite again, Avenger or not."
An electric chirp sounded from the computer Tony was leant over, fingers tapping away furiously, “I’ve sent the signal, but the tech here is - is
However, she couldn’t help but grin through bloodied teeth at her latest escapade, finding that she genuinely hadn’t seen herself in this particular situation. Leaning her head back against a stab of upturned concrete, taking shelter from an onslaught of gunfire, she rolled her head to look to her left. Her eyes travelled down her left arm, along the pair of handcuffs latched onto her wrist connecting her to her companion. She was met with Tony’s frantic eyes looking back at her, incredulous at her grin.
“I draw everyone, but yes, you…”
nicely, Steven.”
They all fucking hated paperwork.
about him?”
“I know I knew you, and not just on the side of the road with your - technician, was it?”
Tony was about to make his presence know to Steve when a spot of light caught his eye from amongst the trees a few yards behind Steve, who was busy kneeling down beside the agents, searching them for anything useful. A figure stepped out the shadows, raising a large looking blade into an offensive position.
“T'is true!” Thor called from in front of them, Jane wrapped up under one of his arms.
“Yeah, exactly - how did-?”
And the rain
“...No.”
“You do.” Tony teased. Steve huffed, praying he didn’t look too flustered.
The next morning, a couple of them were nursing considerable hangovers, and stumbled their way into the lounge, basking on the cool surface of the tiled floor. Bruce was cooking up a monstrous amount of bacon, eggs, and sausage, while Steve pottered around the kitchen scouring together mugs of tea, coffee, and juice for Rhodey - because he was healthy like that.
The others had all stripped down to their bathing suits - even Bruce, usually more reserved, exposing an impressive amount of chest hair.
Clint was frantically looking side to side, as if trying to figure out what happened. He looked up at Tony and Nat, who were jumping up and down like children, clutching onto each other while the rest of the team let out excited shrills of disbelief.
Tony surveyed Clint for a few minutes, eventually pulling away and looking Clint in the eye.
” Spittle flew from the agents mouth, and Natasha loosened her hold on her weapon - and the agent visibly relaxed when he saw it slip out her right hand - dropping down a few inches before her left hand snapped it up again, firing two precise shots between the man’s eyes. His body fell into a heap on the floor, foot twitching a few times before permanently stilling.
“Tony,” Steve urged, smiling despite himself, before sighing. “I like you, I have feelings for-”
“No, no, it’s… It’s okay, honestly I thought it would be weird, but…” Tony cautioned a look down at the scarred skin around the reactor, and felt a knot in his chest loosen faintly. “But I guess I prefer having it out there, rather than people speculating about it - it’s not exactly something I, y'know, flash about,” he finished lamely, rubbing a hand over the back of his neck. Thor frowned at his friend.
Steve felt himself flush in embarrassment, before looking towards the direction of the archer’s voice, grimacing at the worried look the other man was giving him.
As proof to his claim, a little girl had nudged one of the clowns, who fell backwards dramatically, knocking into another clown, who knocked into another and so on.
“I just-! I misread your closeness as a romantic thing, up until… well, just recently, actually,” he conceded, rubbing his sweaty palms together. “Nat told me she’s gay.”
“Yeah – well, I was speaking English pretty soon after I begun to speak Italian, but when I was born my Mom, she wanted privacy, so we stayed with her family in Italy most of the year,” he shrugged, reading off the next line of the book to Clint, who threw a thumbs-up back at him. “They all spoke it, so guess I just picked it up first,”
There was an uproar from the living room, and Steve squeezed balled his outstretched has into fists, wincing at the sound of footsteps clattering towards the doorway. Tony awkwardly slung his legs from where they hung over the edge of the counter.
Thor and the Hulk were currently drawing in the most attention from Doombots. The heavy-hitters were being rained down upon my an onslaught of bots, swarming on them like locusts. They’d manage, though, they always did. Like always, the pair seemed to be enjoying the fight more than was sane.
special and different.”
According to Jarvis, Nat was in her quarters - alone, thankfully. So he took the elevator and approached her quarters.
“Yeah, actually! As much as an ass as
– do your thing,”
“Come on! You laughed at that!”
Bucky drained the last of his cartridge, before shutting the door, sliding the rifle between the handle  to hold off the agents from coming in. He and Steve jumped up, easily pulling their weight into the vent one after the other - their only difficulty was squeezing their shoulders through.
a great teacher and that really was an asset for the overall effectiveness of the team, and...
“Of course, darling.”
And here was Tony, practically petrified by them.
Thor shifted awkwardly in his seat, sniffing loudly.
Tony was kind of an unpredictable guy.
“Eh, we can just throw it in the fire, he’s not looking.”
He maintained a steady rhythm of beats, before taking in a huge gulp of air - which was heavy with smoke and dust - and brought his lips to Steve’s. They were cold and lifeless, but Tony beat on, filling Steve’s airways, until bringing his attention back to maintaining compressions on Steve’s chest.
“Why was it not guarded more heavily?” Clint asked, voice flat like it was out on the field. Natasha huffed out a laugh at that.
He worked the brunette slowly, so gently Tony felt his entire body flush, his heart skip a beat, moaning obscenely when Steve curled his fingers. Tony stroked Steve idly, with each pull earning a delightful moan from the soldier.
“We feared we’d lost you, Anthony,” Thor said, “your heart was weak and you lost a great deal of blood, I’m afraid. I am, I’m so sorry, my friend, I didn’t get to you sooner. Had I been faster, perhaps Doom wouldn’t have been able to inflict such a grievous wound upon you.”
Which is why Steve almost crushed the hand of cards in his grip when Tony laid his hand down on the table.
“You reckon you could piece something together?”
“A functional person can just, you know, ask a person out on a date instead of kinda-” he pulled an awkward face, flailing his hands around, “-pining from afar and being kinda a jerk to the other person when they’re just trying to talk to you.”
wounds you,” she said, gesturing to the blade with a nod of her head, all while perching on the end of the medical bed by his feet, “You’re an idiot, by the way, Stark. Strangling Doom? Not your best plan of action.”
“Mister Stark,” Clint declared, stepping up to the mat, giving an exaggerated bow and flair of the wrist, “care to join me?”.
“Wait,” she whispered in a low tone, sticking her hand out at the same time, making a stop gesture to Bucky. Buck crouched down low upon seeing the scene in front of them, as if readying himself, monitoring the situation before him.
“The site in Siberia was put on lockdown by the UN, theres no way Hydra can infiltrate it - no one has clearance to enter the premises,” Natasha prompted, arms folded as she leant over the wooden table they were all seated around.
Clint eyed Tony warily as the smaller man gently felt around his ribs, trying to get an idea on the damage. Since the ordeal with the accords and the barbs Clint had directed at Tony from behind bars, their once playful friendship had become cold and unsettled. Clint had trusted Tony, but after the…
Rhodey was watching cartoons with Clint’s kids, joined by Natasha who has sat cross-legged in the carpet, braiding Bucky’s hair. Laura and Clint were squished together on a love-seat, talking in hushed voices, sharing private smiles, and Sam was engaged in the cartoons more than the kids, unsurprisingly, every-so-often asking if anyone wanted a cup of tea or juice. He was good like that.
“Alright, alright - we’re going to Morocco, I’m putting my foot down-”
After a moment, the hair on the back of his neck stood up, and he pushed himself up from the bed from being led on his front. Turning over, he stopped abruptly mid stretch to find his teammates grinning devilishly from the doorway. Save for Clint, who was flat out howling with laughter.
Steve accepted, pulling at the fabric of his trousers as he did so, not quite ready to look Tony in the eye.
Steve tilted his head and kissed the palm of Tony’s hand, clasping his own hand over Tony’s. Tony wet his lips and started to shuffle, adjusting the way he was led. Steve flushed a soft pink, stomach lifting into his chest as the ends of his fingers began to tingle with anticipation.
They split off into pairs, since hydra agents on patrol usually were in groups no larger than three unless they were headed somewhere important, like to secure the perimeter. The base was much scarcer than it had been their previous visit, which sent a wave of satisfaction through them all.
Steve was doubling over now, full belly-laughs rippling through him, as he wheezed around laughter. He swore he even felt tears prick the corners of his eyes, and was earning a fair share of bemused looks from onlookers making their way down the street.
The brunette was picking slices of pizza from the discarded takeout box from their meal since getting back home in one piece; the others were in various states of passed-out in the living room, save for himself and Steve.
“Uh, actually - not that drunk,” he added casually, immediately stuffing his mouth full of toast.
“Yeah… I’ve really not wanted to admit it to myself, but…” Steve paused. “Wait, you said they’re not together - how do you know that? Did they tell you they weren’t?”
,”  Clint panted to himself, sprinting over to them “thank fuck they’re alright.” He slowed to a jog, grinning ear to ear as he approached them. “You kids enjoy your sleepover?”
Tony was led back on the beach, having discreetly slipped out of his wet clothes and into swimming trunks and a t-shirt with sleeves that finished at the elbows.
Bucky stared after her, torn between bewildered, jealous, and impressed. Steve leant in to his friend’s, raising his eyebrows knowingly and pursing his lips together to hide his amusement.
“...I didn’t say you were
“People might judge - it’s not pretty,”
“You just said 'snot’.”
“Do I even need to tell you that it’s not as bad as it looks? C’mon, I’m fine, Nat can vouch for me,”
Making their way through the entrance, they immediately were taken back by the scene in front of them.
Rhodey seemed to be urging Tony, who was violently shaking his head in a negative motion. Between his hands, Steve noted Rhodes had picked up the guitar that had been mounted on the wall of the bunker above the stove, tightening the strings.
“You totally did not, Rogers, and quit acting like I’m embarrassed. You have googled me, right? A few pages into YouTube and I’m pretty sure Perez Hilton has a sex-tape of mine from the 90’s.”
“Nonsense! This is far better, you’ll thank me later, Samuel.” Thor grinned. Sam just shook his head, chortling.
Tony let himself be guided downwards, his back pressing against the rug as Steve settled over him, chin tilted upwards as he eagerly kissed back, hands roaming across Steve’s back.
“Uh, I don’t know, the water makes my hair funny - it the salt, y'know’,
“What’s eating you up?”
Click
“How’d you do that exactly?”
“The elevator is that way-” Tony breathed around kisses, pointing to the opposite direction in which they were headed.
Steve grinned at the pair, before looking up to when Tony and Clint began a ridiculous high-pitch screaming. Both had jumped backwards from the fire, crashing into the ground and scrambling to get back from a fire that was now impressively roaring. Bruce and Rhodey were shouting at them - all while laughing - as Nat just cackled, throwing her head back and letting her red hair curl and bounce with the movement.
Thor bellowed a laugh, striding forward, “Aye, who wants to catch these hands?”
Steve took the stairs to get to Tony’s quarters, only two floors up from Nat’s. He was buzzing with anticipation, but also felt himself dragging his feet. He didn’t want to get his hopes up too high - he didn’t think he’d be able to cope with the disappointment.
Tony.
“Star-
(he refused to call it a Civil War, for gods’ sake), he had questioned whether Tony had their best interests in mind or his own.
“Stay back, slut.”
“Please don’t tell me you’ve finally become totally unhinged. God, are you
Thor’s hearty chuckles were heard from beside his head, and Tony peeled open the eye that wasn’t currently pressed into a pillow.
“Right,” Clint announced, clapping his hands together and rubbing them profusely as he strode in, Tony and Rhodey in tow, “What’d we get from Norway, then - other than a cold?”
Click
Steve took the opportunity of Tony distracted in his banged with Clint to peek under the fold of the zipper, revealingly a deep cut in Tony’s abdomen. Steve winced before pouring the alcohol at it, holding Tony firmly in place while the other man let out a started Yelp and hiss of pain. He couldn’t tell from the outside of the undersuit Tony was hurt, which was predominantly due to the fact the dark material made it extremely difficult to see the bleeding.
Laughing so hard it hurt, Steve tried to keep up with Tony, who was walking as fast as possible without it being called running away back towards the safety of their tower.
owe him anyway.”
“I guess,” he sucked at his bottle, taking the opportunity to spend a bit longer to think over how to respond, “I just try to pay attention, I guess.”
“Yes, because I’m excellent at it. You on the other hand, well-” she he turned playfully to his current state.
“All right,” Steve announced, standing up from his perching position on the floor, “I say we rest now, get some energy and figure out food when we wake up. After that maybe one of use will be sane enough to think of some way we get outta this mess.”
When Tony woke, it wasn’t light like he was expecting.
“How do you suppose we get outta here?” Bucky called over the sound of gunfire, ducking behind the cover of the reinforced doorframe. Steve turned to Tony, who stilled before aiming his gauntlet skywards. Firing, a large hole emerged in the ceiling from the impact of the blast, and cold air whipped into the room.
Natasha had heard the commotion over the comms after Thor warned Tony to hold back before he got there. She then heard a crack of thunder and Thor launching into the air, but looking up he wasn’t landing down on the avenue Tony and Steve had been fighting on; the Thunder God had intercepted a Doombot mid-air.
“If we finish it in half an hour we get free coffee for a week.”
“Well
“Hydra intel from this place is exceptional,” Steve spoke, causing the others to straighten up and regard the projections intently. “The system from the base acted as a kind of hub, gathering information from hundreds of other branches of Hydra.”
Upon surveilling the crash sight, they found their systems had been hijacked and dismantled, preventing FRIDAY from reading for any other life-signatures or readings of foreign devices on board. One ambitious Hyrda agent had concealed themselves in the belly of the jet, with a huge electromagnetic bomb strapped to their chest. On detonation, it released a shock thought the jet, sending its systems into shut-down.
On the rare occasions she’d had to bunk with one of the guys, they’d always been quite rigid, staying as far away as possible from her without making it too obvious. But Tony… she didn’t even think it was just that he was comfortable with sharing beds with people, or that he didn’t have the same respect for women (he was best friends with Pepper Potts, for fuck’s sake, she’d never tolerate any of that shit, and if she loved Tony, that was enough of an indication that he wasn’t one of
, earlier - on the jet, I was conscious enough to see what happened, what happened to you, and I-” Steve seemed to think carefully about his next words, swallowing the lump in his throat and licking his bottom lip, avoiding Tony’s gaze. Not that Tony was looking at Steve either.
“First off, I wanted to apologise. I know you might not know why, but…” he ventured a look down at Tony, who was looking up at him from his spot on the floor, “I’ve been pretty resentful towards you and Nat recently, seeing you guys so close just made me... bitter.” At Tony’s slightly hurt and confused expression, Steve hurried into an explanation.
Tony blinked at her, mouth twitching the slightest amount as if testing out how to produce the words he was about to say. He looked at her, saw the intent in her eyes, but behind that noticed how she had all but stopped breathing, and her fists were clenched so tightly he was sure her fingernails must be pinching her skin: she was just as nervous as he was, which was more than interesting, and perhaps the only reason why he did the unthinkable and answered honestly.
“’M'not a goon,” Steve mumbled through a barely concealed smirk, “I could’ve handled it jus’ fine.”
Clint bit his lip. “They didn’t need to-
Damn. He was maturing. Giving advice and being all responsible and shit. He pulled back the bowstring, and made a bullseye (of course), before slyly looking back towards the bench, noting that Steve had gone.
“Yes, I am - but you’re still the annoying one”.
“Hey! I’m trying to learn, don’t be so fuckin’ condescending,” Clint chastised, pointing a wooden spoon in Tony’s direction accusingly, flicking the engineer with tomato juice.
“Laura,” came Steve’s warm and grateful voice, and she turned at him smiling gently, “thank you for this, it’s so good to see you under better circumstances.” She waved him off fondly, and patted his arm softly.
To their credit, the pair managed to keep their voices so level that anyone else who didn’t know them so well wouldn’t have even guessed how anxious they were.
“I do think you’re capable, Tony,” Steve said softly so only they could hear (well, Bucky could too, but he was strategically very hard on anything but the exchange going on beside him) “It’s just, you take it the wrong way,” Bucky whistled lowly, hissing a breath of air in an obvious cringe, and Steve backtracked quickly.
“Should I take you to a hospital?”
Tony let out a deep breath. Damn, he’d really been holding onto that one. It’s not like he thought the guys were dicks, in fact, he knew if he were to honestly tell any of them that he didn’t quite click with that banter, they’d feel terrible and stop. But he just didn’t want to seem weird or difficult. He was already pretty sure everyone found him at least mildly annoying, so why add to that?
Steve seemed taken back by that, expecting more of a fight out of Nat - it usually took her a while to back down, she only did so if she knew she was going to be beaten. Steve couldn’t help feeling rather smug - intimidating the Black Widow in a game of poker.
“Well,” the engineer said, casting his eyes up to meet Steve’s, which were dancing as wildly as his own were with joy and amusement, “You got me there.”
“You can get hold of Thor?” Sam asked, voice distant as his attention was mostly drawn to reading the transcripts before him.
“Jesus fuck, Tony, do you ever shut your goddamn mouth?” Steve said hopelessly, eyes swimming with mirth.
Another 10 minutes passed (well, actually 8 minutes, 37 seconds,
“Whatever, you straight-up look like a Dad from the suburbs, man - purple flip-flops,
Cap had decided just he Bucky and Nat would be going out armed, taking Tony with them for the technical stuff, as Bucky put it.
“Oh, controlled yourself, did you?”
“You… you let me think you were
? Okay, okay, I see you,” Clint said, a mixture of confusion and delight on his face. He amped up his game, and Tony was actually
Steve was there, wrestling three agents off his back. One agent deliver a swift jab to his gut, only slightly making Steve double over, before he delivered a far more devastating uppercut to the hydra goon’s chin, knocking him out cold. Steve then grappled with the agent over his back, trying to crush his windpipe with the rifle he was carrying. Steve got a grip on the rifle and tossed his attacker over his shoulders, where the guy landed in a graceless pile at Steve’s feet. Scrambling for a handgun, the agent was cut short with a swift step to the neck from Steve.
“I have nothing to prove, Mr Stark,” the agent snapped bitterly, voice dripping in what sounded like a Scandinavian accent, pressing the gun harder against Tony’s head.
without-” Tony stopped his tangent when Steve procured his Starkphone from his back pocket, holding it out a few inches in front of Tony’s face. “Oh, light of my life, what would I do without you?”
And those eyes were gazing at his. Steve felt a spark in his belly, the sudden dryness of his mouth - a metallic clang rung from below them, and the two men shot up and aimed their guns at the door, which creaked before swinging open, revealing Bucky’s plain expression.
In the light of dusk, Tony’s face was nearing a dangerously blue-grey tone, waxen and covered in ash which matted his sweaty hair to his skull. Brushing the hair out of his eyes, Natasha set her features determinedly, getting the two injured men to the quinjet where they’d be taken to the Helicarrier’s medical wing.
- right. Just hang on!”
Tony’s world suddenly turned sideways - he’d collapsed, he realised distantly - and he struggled to maintain a steady flow of oxygen himself. He felt the warm trickle of blood oozing from his side, and pressed a hand against the wound absently, eliciting a strangled cry of pain from his mouth, which tasted like copper.
“Tony! Thank you last time, for the tractor, I never got the chance to thank you properly-”
Nat nodded, understanding. She glanced up, noting the man at the counter ordering a coffee. He was another regular, and from what she could tell, the looks he shot Tony’s way weren’t just because he recognised him. He was objectively attractive - tall, muscular, a strong jaw, cute glasses, dressed well… she was sure Tony must have noticed, he
Natasha persisted - she was nothing if not to the point when she wanted to be. Frankly, she wanted her friend to know he could be honest with her; and if part of her - the little part that longed for affinity - was secretly hoping he might say yes… well, no one else needed to know about that.
“Tony?”
, you son-of-a-
Tony ducked Clint’s next strike, and in the same motion, swung a precise kick out and swept Clint’s feet out from underneath him, sending him to the floor with a short shout of alarm.
because they were hers, and I paid for these, ergo, I can do what I want.”
“Yeah, painkillers will do that,” he grinned.
They’d taken a complete detour, instead of going the most direct way, Tony had lead them down a bunch of side streets, just to end up at the end of the road the store sat on, rather than just walk down said road to get there.
“Very true… so what are you suggesting?”
“You’re scared of them, aren’t you?”
-?” Tony asked, eyebrows raised and playful attitude completely lost.
“What?” Steve asked, trying and failing to hide how jarring
Even in this state, being steered off somewhere unknown without hope of being able to stand upright on her own, what perhaps surprised her more than anything else these past few days was the fact that she without a doubt trusted the man at her side with her life.
Steve woke up his his head smushed in the same pillow Tony was lead on. His head felt as if it were stuffed full of cotton, but one thing was clear, his night with Tony was perfect.
“Tony, you should wear your wounds with honour, as James does, and Clinton does with his listening-devices - ‘hearing aids’, you call them?” He asked, looking down at Jane for confirmation, who nodded fondly, “They are not to be ashamed of, my friend, they honour you!” The God pulled an arm round the brunette, smiling fiercely.
A way down the street Steve noted Tony almost cringe – almost
Doom’s breathing had become strained and rapid, and Tony only tightened his grip. He wanted Doom to suffer, to die
“I didn’t read wrong, then?”
The smaller man’s hair was damp, appearing black in the dim lighting of the upstairs hallway, and he had shuffled into a large baggy sweatshirt and boxers, trying to appear nonchalant as he leant against the banister.
More gunfire spat at their make-shift shelter, sending shots of concrete dust around them. Nat instinctively curled inwards, grabbing Tony by the back of the head and pulling him closer to her. She made note of the shouting that was growing louder; it wouldn't be long until their captors caught up with them.
, she thought, hobbling over to the jet with Tony’s hand linked in hers.
to stare.
“No, no!” Steve laughed, pointing his finger between Tony and up at the ceiling - he always looked up when addressing Jarvis - “I don’t consent for my voice to be used like that out of context, get rid of that right now.”
“They tried, they failed.”
Steve and Bucky shot up from where they stood, only to stumble when the jet shuddered unnaturally. Clint reached across towards Sam and strapped him in, despite the other man’s protests, and gripped firmly onto one of the bright yellow handles swinging idly from the ceiling of the jet.
Tony unleashed the last remnants of the suit’s energy into his gauntlets, which he’d quietly aimed towards Doom’s gut while he was monologuing.
“We don’t care, there’s nothing wrong with you or it, Tony,”
Nat had pulled down video footage of conferences shared between the heads of Hydra, Clint glossing over them which craning his neck over her shoulder.
“S'good job you’re rich, or you’d be stuck like that forever man,” Clint interrupted, pulling a face at the awkward angle of Tony’s nose, “
They approached the steps leading up to the entrance of their home, when Bruce scooped what looked like a t-shirt off the cobbled road.
- but your ribs are definitely broken. You’re a lucky son'f-bitch that it hasn’t punctured anything, but it will if you move too much.”
“I’m gay, Steve.”
Tony breathed, shifted in his spot next to Natasha, and began to sing. The other’s around them perked up, surprised smiles playing on their faces as the brunette sung, accompanied by the gentle strums of the guitar.
“Miss Romanoff, can I help you?”
“Oh, come on! Why the hell are we just staying here?” The man threw himself to his feet, clapped his hands, and turned to face Thor, who was taking up an entire sofa to himself, Jane sat haphazardly on his hip. “You - where haven’t you been yet? Statue of Liberty? The MET - oh! Empire State Building?”
Inside, the floors were coated in intricate tile details, some forming mosaics. Flourishing plants potted in glossy ceramic pots were littered around the space, which wasn’t huge, but large enough for all ten of them. The rooms were open plan, save for the bedrooms, and draped in rich colours. The curtains at the windows were delicate, wisps of a sheer fabric that was slightly transparent, swaying in the soft evening breeze from the sea front a short stroll away.
in Tony’s case most the time) battling off Doombots while trying to get close enough to Doom - who was controlling the entire fleet from the safety of a bank. He’d set up a perimeter of bots defending the building, and hostages behind them as a safety net, the bastard. Doom was tucked away in a reinforced vault, using remote monitors to oversee his attack.
Tony spoke barely above a whisper, and Steve’s heart clenched painfully.
“Doing what, Buck?”
just, no, he was not going there. He resisted the urge to squirm, then tried to collect himself enough that he would sound as casual as possible when he asked:
Clint nodded. “Yeah, I guess so…”
“Jarvis, let the others know I’m demanding we get takeout from that pizza joint I like for dinner tonight. No arguments, I’ve earned it.”
Sam and Bucky waggled their eyebrows at the Captain, who resolutely ignored them, regarding his team with  a firm nod. None of them bought it, but pitied him, and let him carry on acting like He Was Totally Not Flustered.
cosy?
“Tony.”
But this- there was something… different, but
Tony looked gorgeous under the beating sun. His normally perfectly styled hair was messy and plastered down his face, curling over his sparking eyes. His skin was golden and tan, and looked irresistible to touch- smoothly running down his muscular yet lean figure, which sloped gorgeously at his ass. Steve felt a wave of warmth run down his body, pooling in his gut, and he resisted the urge to break the distance between them.
“I thought the birds around here were pretty? These ones just keep squawking,”
“Ugh, whatever - if we played darts like originally planned, your ass would be kicked, buddy,”
After that escapade, Fury had informed them he’d received word from local authorities that Avenger intervention for menial matters wasn’t necessary. Basically, a polite way of saying Kindly piss off next time.
Tony closed the gap between them on one swift movement, bringing their lips together tenderly. Steve got with the programme quickly, and kissed back, bringing an arm round Tony’s waist, drawing him closer. Tony deepened the kiss and Steve moaned softly into his mouth, letting his mind drift upwards. He’d wanted this for so long, it ached in his chest and throbbed around his body. He tilted Tony’s head backwards gently, kissing Tony deeper and leaning over his body slightly, letting Tony lay back as Steve gently climbed over him, careful of his stitches.
“You were -” Bucky squeezed his eyes shut, as if trying to dig pack into his past and turn over the right stone that would give him the answer he knew was there, but couldn’t find. He remembers her face, her hair, the way she moved, the way she hunted. He felt…
Sweet love of mine,”
Natasha brandished two steaming mugs of tea in front of Tony and Bucky, snorting loudly at Tony’s purpling face. Shaking her head, she fetched a wash-cloth from the kitchenette sink, and carefully scrubbed the trail of blood cascading down Tony’s nose, lips, and chin.
“No,” Steve tried to play it cool, so why he said what he did next was beyond him, “I was just taking in your face.”
“That makes no sense,” Bruce cut in, clearly frustrated but keeping a lid on it – unlike Tony, who was wide-eyed and practically seething, “why did he need to think Steve was dead, why not tell us?”
Steve swore when Tony took him inside his mouth, making him throw one arm over his face and another to the back of Tony’s head. Steve pushed the brunette’s head deeper, thrusting forward into the movement. Tony expertly got him off with just his lips and tongue, humming strategically, Steve barely able to stop himself sliding down the wall. He gripped at the handle of the banister, which gave way under his strength.
Clint had spent the majority of the mission perched on top of rooftops, giving the rest of the eyes over the entire scene, picking out bots with explosive arrows which strayed too far from the centre of the battle.
“I’ll raise you fifty bucks, Bucky,” Clint grinned, tossing the chips in. They turned to Tony, who gave nothing away on his expression. Steve was practically hanging off the edge of his chair - if Tony fell in Bucky’s trap of playing the hand off nonchalantly, Clint would be out, and Tony would be next to go. Tiny had played well, but he was average - managed to hold his own, sure, but certainly didn’t stand out, Bucky noted.
The following silence could be cut with a knife. Rhodey just smiled to himself, feeling oddly gleeful for his best friend; since coming downstairs, Tony had been deliriously happy, humming softly to himself.
Wanda hung back with Tony, casting a concerned look at the dishevelled brunette, who didn’t look too comforted.
Clint was clearly joking as an effort to ease the sense guilt he and Steve both knew Sam was harbouring. He’s saved Steve and probably actually given them a great chance of getting out alive - two super-soldiers is better than one, after all. Though, Sam had felt particularly useless while he was consumed in agony and had to rely on Steve to keep his head on straight while they made their escape.
- yeah, alright. Well, this is a close second.”
“I’m kinda used to being made fun of, and I get it, it’s, what, gym-room banter? I-” he made a
“Oh that stupid son-of-a-bitch.”
, again, with the rhyming, I didn’t mean to, this is very serious and I’m so sorry
His calloused fingers spun through the projections, pinching and flicking through the data, seemingly randomly, before he scaled up a discrete file blandly labeled as ‘
How wrong they were. This man was brilliant, so fiercely intelligent he’d managed to pick out a needle in a haystack of intel - hell, it was a needle disguised as a stand of hay, if they were sticking with he metaphor. He didn’t think Tony would ever stop surprising him, and the thought of it made his stomach leap in a way that sent warmth etching into is bones. By some stroke of luck, Tony wanted him - the grunt who barked out orders and punched bad guys in the face.
Okay, so maybe not all of that was down to Tony being half Italian, and more to do with the restless thumping Steve’s heart did when he locked eyed with the brunette.
“I know. I wanted to make sure you did too, punk. He cares about you too.”
Clint was egging them on, Bruce looking thoroughly amused, while Rhodey tried to get around Nat. Tried being the keyword. Eventually, she just turned and picked Tony up herself. With her truly freakish strength was able to hold the genius with one arm under his thighs as he wrapped his legs around her waist, a shit-eating grin pointed his best friend’s way.
“Well, given that I run the operation here, I grant you permission to disclose,” he gestured a hand out, as if inviting them to speak. Tony shrugged at Natasha, who had already walked up to the man and snapped neck in one swift movement.
They’d found the place scrolling through some
“Nah, it’s fine, I don’t mind…” Steve smiled in return. Bruce was exactly the kind of calm and comforting presence a person needed in the morning, especially this one, since he knew Buck wouldn’t have forgotten about the night before. Hell, he’d probably roped Sam into his business already.
, I’m so glad to hear you saw those words” Clint moaned, already getting up and talking to the elevator.
They sat there for a few minutes, smoking together, passing the item between them tenderly. It was intimate, and usually Steve would have slipped away by now, back to the safety of his other teammates; but Tony… Tony was intoxicating. The knots that had formed in his stomach felt eased under the buzz of alcohol and steady mull of weed. Steve mouthed the end of the joint each time he brought it to his lips, as if  trying to taste Tony. It was sensual, and Steve felt himself lean towards Tony - and amazingly, Tony was leaning towards him too.
“Why the hell are we looking at this?” Bucky snorted, furrowing his brow at the folder, which was password-protected.
Steve really, really couldn’t take this anymore. He’d walked past the common area, only to spot Tony and Nat passed out on the sofas, curled into one another while reruns of
“I did turn it on!”
“Counting cards is foul-play and you know it, Mister Stark!” The blonde laughed, eyes glistening.
“Oh for the love of-
Tony had gone stock still, eyes wide and sad.
A month later, and Tony and Steve were back to talking as usual. Sometimes Tony joked about his feelings for Steve, brushed them off as nothing more than physical attraction. Really, its an appreciation for the science behind the serum, not the meat-head piloting it, he’d said, cackling like a madman at Steve’s mock-offended expression.
Following up the staircase, it opened up onto a landing which branched off into four bedrooms, with enough space that each of them would have a double bed to themselves. Thor and Jane claimed one for themselves, while Tony lunged into one of the large rooms he was sharing with Bruce and Rhodey. Bucky slung his bag off his shoulder into another room, which he, Steve, and Sam decided to bunk in together, leaving Natasha and Clint to fight over the bed closest to the balcony. Clint won, surprisingly, only to realise Natasha was smugly sat on the bed he then realised was closest to the ensuite. Damnit.
The team looked at her in varying stages of amused shock and admonishment.
“I’m holding you to this, Wilson.”
Natasha nodded, and began to open her mouth when a loud electrical whine sounded from under the jet. After a moment the whine grew into an even louder blast that thrummed through the belly of the jet.
Steve was leant in the kitchen against the counter, watching his team through the doorway. Tony joined him, covered in motor oil after being under Laura’s car, which had been acting up lately.
The pair weren’t playing together, but found satisfaction in being the last two remaining. Steve suppressed a gleeful grin expertly.
Clint’s quip only served to deliver himself a considerably sized handful of snow from Natasha and a long-suffering sigh from Rhodey, who was largely consumed in a startlingly orange SHIELD-issue puffer jacket he’d picked up before everything went to hell on the jet.
“I guess it’s not me, since you’re talking to me, and it can’t be Jane, because Thor’s strangled you before - and I think he’d break your neck,” Tony rolled his eyes, and Natasha continued, more gently this time.
resent being called little).
Steve sighed, having expected this conversation. Since the coming together after the accords, the divide among the team had never felt more clear. It cut deep, and God if it wasn’t painful. The way they physically broke off from each other in missions.
it’s not. Not that I don’t, or wouldn’t ever… I’m just not…”
Came FRIDAY’s voice through the comms, no doubt had the A.I altered the rest of the team too.
“Where the
Not exactly the kind of civilisation they had hoped for, the cabin definitely hadn’t been lived in for a long time judging by how stiff the door was and the coat of dust covering the minimal amount of furniture inside.
“A’ight, but don’t cry to me if it all falls into the fire.”
Steve broke the kiss for a moment, resting his forehead against Tony’s, looking into the other man’s eyes before huffing out a soft laugh, heart fluttering at the way Tony grinned back at him, hands once again coming to rest on Steve’s face.
“Well, our plan wasn’t cheating, if that’s what you mean - just tactics,”
“Noticed what?” Nat asked, gaze flicking intently between the engineer and the schematics hovering between them all.
So here he was, heading up the stairway, passing pieces of artwork Pepper had no doubt picked out, as well as the more recent additions of picture frames encasing moments captured between the team: All of them sat across the Hulk’s shoulder’s, blood and dirt across their faces, still in their respective armours and suits. But there they were, smiling brightly, running high on adrenaline as well as the indescribably relief that there were no fatalities that day.
“I’m not sure, that’s more your call…” she then untucked the menu from its stand, facing it Tony’s way, tapping at one of the special offers with her fingernail “But for now, they have a cheesecake the size of Hulk’s head, and you
Ignoring the way his stitches burned at the motion, Tony sat down on the edge of the chair next to Steve, propping his chin on the mattress. Closing his eyes, Tony’s mind wandered back to the battle.
Five minutes passed, and as if on queue, sirens howled throughout the base, lighting turning a pulsating red. Voices declaring unauthorised personnel rung from the speakers I. The building in various languages. Tony straightened himself and tore off the sleeve covering his single remaining gauntlet, finding solace in the familiar whine of the repulsers firing up. Heavy footsteps were approaching, when Steve burst into the room, gun raised.
“You kissed
Plus the occasional laugh from Thor, though even those were now somewhat empty, not filled with their usual mirth.
, she taught me to play.”
“Wha-? Cap… you feeling alright? Helmet not squeezing your brain too much?”
“Thanks - thank you, Tony, you had my back out there and I’m just sorry I-” Steve fumbled for the right worlds, before signing and settling on, “I promise I’ll have your back next time, Shellhead.”
“Someone on the team?”
Steve wished he could say he was a good friend to Tony when they wandered over. Though he didn’t think any force on Earth would have stopped him practically collapsing in fits of laughter when a clown came up from beside them, honking a horn playfully, and the prompt shriek Tony let out from the top of his lungs, clawing at Steve’s arm.
“Okay, you’re up.”
, Tony.”
“It was taking forever!” Clint protested, rolling off of his back.
That evening, when they returned from their night out, Thor had boldly declared he would start mixing drinks at their bar. This shortly turned into a mixology competition between himself, Clint, and Rhodey. Rhodey was victorious, ending in a greatly put out Clint and a ton of concoctions they all challenged them selves into finishing.
Nat levelled him with a deadpan look. “Brunch, Steve.”
“Ooh, so it was
, are you walking around after just having stitches.” The statement wasn’t really a question, Steve had already lifted up the other man’s scrubs to reveal that yes, in fact there were recently sewn stitches and yes Tony had pulled them enough to bleed considerably.
Steve was quiet now, the previous bubbling excitement and nerves tangled together dissipating, replaced with a cold wash of dread.
“Then
“Not your type?”
“If I see a single one of you listening in outside this goddamn door in the surveillance tape later I will personally have you put on paperwork duty for the next fortnight,” Steve said plainly. The sound of shuffling stirred up and eventually faded out down the corridor.
Stretching out his muscles, Steve looked over to the other side of the gym, watching as Tony and Nat pushed each other around, laughing and goofing around while they waited for the rest of the team to get there.
Steve dropped his head onto Tony’s chest with a sigh, closing his eyes as if to say why me, why now. Tony snorted gently and dipped his head forward pecking Steve’s forehead. Steve sat up and turned to look at the voice coming from the door, eyes already rolling back good-naturedly.
Nat, Barnes, and Steve took a final once-over of the scene from the window and filed outside, gens turning signals to each other as they went.
Nat? Nat can you - christ - can you get the-”
“No - Rhodey, he’s very wise. An old-soul and all that.” Tony mused, gaze flittering over Steve’s face, his chest, his arms.
“One wrong move and that broken rib becomes a punctured lung, and we’re royally fucked if that happens, Clint” Steve said sternly, challenging Clint to protest again. When Clint opened his mouth, Steve raised his hand, “That’s an order, Barton. Just because you could go out right now, doesn’t mean you should. It’s not a necessary risk.”
The nods and hums of approval from the others settled it, and they all began to gravitate towards the warmth of the fire. Bucky secured the door shut, shifting a heavy bucket of wet rocks of coal that sat by the doorframe in front of the door as a half-assed barricade.
“-okay, but we’re in the middle of nowhere, and with what we have to hand, I doubt anything I could make from it would reach far enough, we have no satellite dishes or anything to transmit a strong enough frequency-”
“Why- oh… oh, shit, you said you were jealous? Do you… do you like Nat?” Clint questioned, beginning to look apologetic.
“I already have, thanks to Clint,” he said without much heat.
Tony and Steve were on the ground (well,
“I think I just have better delivery; don’t take it personally, I’m better than most people at most things.”
“Don’t even joke about that, I’m shocked and offended and would like you to go away. I’ve had enough of you. Goodbye.” Clint just chuckled in response to Tony, and it felt good, familiar.  There was an unspoken element of hope in the air that things could get back to normal, and Steve ducked his head to hide the smile that played on his lips.
“If I hadn’t have stepped in, Thor would never have reached Doom in time and he wouldn’t be sealed in interrelation, ready to be held trial for what he’s done. Civilians died, Steve, you could’ve-”
Tony’s attention was snapped back to reality when Natasha came to loom over him. He peered at her over the rim of his sunglasses, eyebrows raised in question.
, Tony,
“Yeah- uh, if that’s okay? You look pretty cosy here.”
His head whipped back to face the team, faces set determinedly, and yelled over the loud whistle of air around them.
They’d easily been able to pick the lock of the cabin door - not exactly fort Knox, they’d agreed once they’d settled down on a sofa. Nat had her leg raised, digging into a cup of instant ramen Tony had foraged from the back of one of the kitchenette cupboards while trying to hold Nat up by his side. They’d still not been able to get out of the cuffs.
She sat up a little in her position, tilting her head at him with a quizzical look on her face.
couldn’t you tell
“Wait,” Steve interrupted, “What do
“…more or less, I suppose…”
Steve almost flushed when his stomach unleashed an unceremonious growl, causing a few head to turn.
“The only way Cap could get close enough is if the guy thought he was dead,” Bucky tried to explain.
The God levelled him with a mock-serious look that Steve had long gotten used to, “This is why you make an excellent leader, Steven. Stern, but compassionate; firm, yet fair. I’m truly grateful-”
It was Nat’s turn to take an obnoxiously long sip of her drink, innocently fluttering her eyelashes at him.
“Oh. Oh, God, I really look like a fuckin’ ass right now, huh?”
She clawed at his back, laughing manically, before using her weight to throw them both under the waves.
Bucky vaulted into the building the second the gap was big enough, followed closely by Nat. The others stayed outside prepping medical supplies just in case, Clint taking a business call with S.H.I.E.L.D who were on clean-up.
Steve wasn’t quite ready to admit to himself that Tony’s laugh sent butterflies fluttering through his stomach, blossoming warmth into his bones. God, he was such a coward. Letting Tony think that… that he didn’t feel the same damn way. But he just wasn’t
Steve watched from the corner of his eye the interaction taking place between Tony and Thor, barely noticing Bucky toss seaweed over Sam’s face.
Clint listened carefully. Tony didn’t speak about his mother, especially since finding out about her death, the real reason, but she clearly meant the world to him. Tony had gingerly played the piano, and they began to talk, and eventually laugh. They watched movies, Tony spoke about his mom, Clint spoke about his family. One time he mentioned missing being able to come home to family, to hold them when he came home. He lived mostly at the tower for his duty, and he and Laura and agreed that his Avenging life stayed away from their home on the farm - there was to be a regular family, to keep his children safe.
Steve kissed the reactor, feeling Tony still at the intimate gesture. Steve just carried on, delicately touching the edges while sucking hickeys into the skin around the device. Tony whimpered, and pulled Steve back to his lips, gave him everything.
They were hovered round Clint’s dining room table, freshly patched up after a few days rest on the farm. Laura was as welcoming as ever, not caring in the slightest when she interrupted a highly-confidential briefing, or a potentially fatal sparring session outside in her barn, pitchers of home-made lemonade in hand.
“Hey, yourself,” Steve mumbled around a smile, glancing over the other man’s shoulder to see if they were alone. They were.
They hydra outpost was desolate and practically impossible to reach on foot. Out in the wilderness of Norway, it had been hard enough locating the outpost which - like most of hydra’s bases - was underground. The landscape was covered in a thick layer of snow, making the mountains in the distance barely visible through the snowfall which was beginning to pick up at a reasonably worrying pace.
He smiled, “That’s not true… you would have let me in regardless.”
“I think he was actually stood on the roof on the Empire State Building last battle? Conducting lightning or whatever it is you do, buddy-” Tony supplied, legs thrown over the back of the chair as he dangled off the edge of the seat backwards. Steve cringed at the sight when Tony moved too fast, seeming as though he might land on his neck and snap it or something stupid and not unlike Tony.
Tony pulled out a screwdriver and undid the bolts on the casing of the vent below them quickly, dropping down onto the floor below. The others followed closely behind him, when they heard the click of someone clicking the safety off their gun.
Tony was brilliant.
Steve stood stock still, blinking a few times and noting that his upper lip was now wet. Bringing his hand up he dabbed away the blood trickling from his nose.
He grinned despite himself at the silliness of it, singing a song in his head to will Captain America into breathing again, but it worked damnit, sue him.
“Shut up. Pizza. Move.” She countered, noting the way Steve hadn’t laughed at Clint’s little joke.
Tony stares after her, bewildered and disgusted at how efficient she was even hungover, before Rhodey snapping  his fingers together to get his friend’s attention back.
“Hydra is pulling together its major Think Tanks from across the globe, pooling all their resources into digging up all the lost information of the serum used on Cap back in the good ol’ days of Polio. Doctor Abraham Erskine ensured he was the only man alive who knew the formula for a successful serum, but he wanted to ensure that he kept all of findings safe for when he needed to refer back to it.”
The room was lit warmly by the light coming from the lounge and a few floor lamps, casting a peachy glow over the two men.
He set his jaw hard when Natasha nodded, a little more warmly than she was a few moments ago. She patted his knee, letting her hand linger for a moment, before walking up to the cockpit.
“What?”
That is until Nat was led back in his lap, laughing at something Tony had whispered to her.
“They are” Natasha stated matter-of-factly, before letting Tony continue.
“Well, seems there are some things you’re not too old for,” Rhodey mused, a pointed look on his face. Tony’s expression was hopelessly blank. Rhodey let out a long suffering sigh.
) Nat looked up towards what caught Tony’s attention: a light.
Natasha and Clint turned on their heel every so often on their sprint back to the jet, firing minimal but fatal shots to their attackers who were starting to get desperate. Usually, Hydra wanted to keep most of them alive; Avengers made for spectacular bargaining chips - or so they assumed, since it wasn’t like they’d ever managed to hold on to one very long (Bucky’s time as the Winter Solider doesn’t count).
“You haven’t seen it,”
As punishment for his deception, Tony had been assigned cleaning duty for the remainder of the evening while the others hit the bars. As a good team leader which absolutely no alterer motive, no siree, Steve stayed behind to help, claiming he felt bad leaving Tony alone, even if he was a sneaky little shit.
Clint grimaced, then sucked in a sharp breath when Natasha appeared over his shoulder with a rag soaked in alcohol, dabbing it over the wound without so much as a warning.
Sweet child o’ mine
- I’ll get to it, before you say anything - and he told me I should come talk to you to clear up a few of the, uh, misconceptions I’ve been having.”
Bucky shifted awkwardly next to Tony, who was barely suppressing the body-wracking shudders escaping from his control.
“The Hydra base,” Sam cut in, “it’s risky - really risky, we’re down by quite a bit - but it may be the only realistic chance we have to get a strong signal out fast. And let’s face it,” he said, looking at their various current states of disarray, “we won’t manage without proper medical supplies and food out here for much longer.”
For a moment Steve didn’t even chew it, before he quickly snapped back to reality. Looking up, his shoulders sagged in relief at the fact no one had seemed to even notice. Tony was holding out another one, and Steve liked to think he was more blasé when taking it this time. As Tony took the last one, Steve found himself looking intently at the brunette, taking in the man’s ridiculously full eyelashes, which only emphasised his ‘Bambi eyes’ - a phrase he’d heard
“Okay. And this has nothing to do with the fact you have some incessant desire to run throughout New York with a menagerie of gay women shouting ‘let’s go lesbians’, does it?”
Maybe Steve should have accepted her offer to help, then he might not have to listen to their endearing small talk. Christ, he was being so fucking
“It’s really not that obvious,” The blonde sighed, though he was already following Tony out of the kitchen.
, that was awful”.
“And something men continuously seem to think is that sheer size is a measure for ability. Don’t get me wrong, yes, they’re all very,
It was his penance, and he deserved every stretch mark, scar, discolouration, and mutilation the device projected onto him. It was freakish, he knew - Pepper, bless her heart, had never mentioned it save for the situation where she had to stick her hand through his chest.
“I’ve missed this, being like- like a
“No! No, no, no, no, no - I’m perfect right now, perfectly fine, I could pilot the suit to prove it-”
Steve wiped at the steamed-up mirror in the bathroom, hair wet and dripping not his shoulders from the shower he’d just taken. He stared at himself, droplets of water hugging his eyelashes, and face recovered from any scraped and bruising they got in Norway; but his eyes were heavy.
“Agent Romanoff is allowing you to enter, Captain,” Jarvis said smoothly before Steve even had a chance to knock. He nodded in thanks and walked in.
He tossed the book over to Tony, ignoring the frustrated grunt from Bruce as the book landed in the middle of his notes, scattering them across the island in the middle of the kitchen where most of the team currently sat.
Steve head out first, making a gesture behind himself a few yards from the cabin. With his left arm, he raised his forearm up, making an 'o’ shape with his hand.
Doom stumbled backwards, waving a command with the gesture of his hand, and one of his lackeys gathered his vulnerable form in it’s arms, and retreated, firing up its own, more primitive repulser technology.
And if I’d stare too long
He knew her, better than anyone here. But that was all he knew. He was missing the vital pieces.
And he did.
Oh, oh, oh, oh
“So what - you decided to come down here, a lone gun-slinger, to save the day or- am I close?” Tony questioned the agent, hands raised tiredly at the barrel of the gun currently pressing against his temple.
“Yeah, well,” the brunette shrugged aloofly, but the way his feet were fidgeting ever so slightly gave him away; he was nervous.
Steve laughed, weeks of bitterness and angst rolling off his back, leaving him with a euphoric kind of weightlessness he’d not felt in a long, long time. Then something clicked.
"Sure, sure… I could sort it out for you afterward if you like?” She said, playing along with his game.
“Clint said that, too.”
“Yeah, just the bar, the table, the walls, the stairs…”
It was supposed to be a straight-forward operation: get in, retrieve the data from the hydra outpost on the Winter Soldier project, and get back out. Sure, they hadn’t been cocky about it, they prepared well and took the necessary precautions; what they hadn’t counted on, however, were the agents to be armed with extra-terrestrial weaponry. Tony had marked it up to being modified Chitari weaponry. Apparently not even S.H.I.E.L.D had the scope to track down every piece that went missing from the Battle of New York - alien weaponry tended to sell fast and at insane prices on the black market.
“You have more of a preference for men, no?”
Natasha pinched Tony by the ear as she strolled past the pair, holding on to the smaller man as she went, ending the discussion from heading any further.
Bruce, Vision and Thor hadn’t come with them this time – it hadn’t seemed necessary at the time. They were almost relieved, though, that the Hulk hadn’t come into contact with the empath like they all had.
Clint started to hum along – not being the greatest of singers, but good enough to hold a steady tune. Sam started to bob his head, murmuring the words softly.
“Worry about yourself, Rogers!” He shot back with gritted teeth; though the prosthetics wrapped around his legs allowed him to move his legs again, it wasn’t exactly easy sailing running through snow while under fire.
To quietly pass me by”
Bucky practically snorted milk out of his nose next to Sam, who was hiding a smile behind his coffee mug.
Tony grinned devilishly at Steve, who just huffed an amused sigh back.
The room hadn’t been lived in in a long time, filled with ghosts of memories of old movie nights, homey meals, game night and conversations that spiralled on for hours.
“Are you gay?”
“Please, that’s just an average day in our line of work. You’ll need to do better to impress me, Anthony Stark.”
“No, not for her.”
Tony had never been body conscious before in his life - plenty of scandalous articles from his adolescence speak for themselves. But, since the reactor had buried its way into his chest, he was reluctant for anyone to get a good look at him. Not only did it expose a chink in his infallible armour, but, in his opinion, was an ugly, grotesque reminder of the man he used to be.
“Honey-bear, I think we were too old for that kind of thing about a decade ago,” Tony snorted, wincing when his headache kicked back at him in protest.
“I’ve been out on worse ops with even worse conditions, Cap, I’ll manage with a broken rib.”
So, as per Natasha’s advice, he repressed the perfectionist within himself and did as she told him. Rhodey would be so proud of him - if he or anyone else even knew he was getting one-on-one combat training with
“I’ll sit still when I’m dead.”
Ten minutes past and Tony still hadn’t seen or heard from the others. Rhodey had woken up, not nearly on as main pain meds as Sam and Clint, and had a pistol in hand from his spot on the sofa. Tony cursed whatever hydra goon had set off the EMP immobilising the suit. He and Rhodey had had to abandon most of their armours, not having enough time to get it back into working order. They’d made sure to blow it up first of course before retreating back to the jet.
“What, no, no, no… why are you stopping?”
“You’ve been bested, Hawkeye!” Thor jeered, pulling Bucky into a firm grip round the man’s shoulders. “I thought you would be wise enough to realise-!” another belch “-the mighty son of Odin cannot be beaten!”
They were like that a lot nowadays, ever since they got back from their little kidnapping escapade. Sure, they’d been close before then - they all had - but now… it was different. They were
After those encounters, Steve wasn’t ashamed to admit he either retreated into a cold shower, pound the hell out of the lunching bags, or perhaps as on one occasion, take his problem into his own hands… not just figuratively.
Steve crouched down, eye-to-eye with Tony, gently taking the smaller man’s chin in one hand and angling it to the side to get a better look at the wound. Nat rolled her eyes; Steve cared for them all equally, she knew, but he always had had an odd affection for Tony. She supposed she wasn’t one to judge, though.
Six hours was a long time to be fighting, but it wasn’t unusual in their line of work. But this one was taking its toll. The usual chatter on the communal comm was now filled with sharp updates and commands, the occasional brisk response, and mostly of grunts and yells for their teammates.
She let her book drop forward onto her chest, and gave Steve a soft smile.
“Right, coming back to that ‘jealous’ part,” she warned, “But he wanted me to tell you because he said it wasn’t his place?”
about the moves Tony was making. He and Clint were properly going at it, the archer actually grinning: he was actually enjoying the challenge Tony was posing today. The rest of the team were just as interested now as Steve was, so he didn’t even try and pretend
“You have children, stop recycling stupid jokes from sitcoms,” Clint squealed when Natasha landed a solid punch to his shoulder, earning a deep rumbling laugh from Thor as he and Jane joined them.
Steve always lingered behind as the others trailed off back to their quarters for the night, putting the empty takeout boxes or dinner plates away, folding up the crumpled blankets and tossing the cushions back onto the sofas. Tony had always found it endearing; it was just so Steve, looking after them all in quiet ways, always brushing off the ‘thank you’s.
“Sure looks like it from where we’re standing,” Steve grumbled darkly. The agent only grabbed Tony’s arm, pulling the man closer to him and pressing the gun at the base of his skull, eyes manic.
“Can you help me?” He tried, earning a cautious look from the woman, “I want to remember, I want to know why I feel… this, when I see you.” He finished quietly, having revealed a close intimacy about himself.
thought they could do their little experiments
of them.”
Steve surveyed the situation from the kitchen; Bucky and Sam were talking in hushed voices, Buck wrapping Sam’s broken arm up in a makeshift swing from a ripped up shirt (his ripped up shirt, he noticed fondly), Nat was sorting out Clint, pretending not to notice the way Clint was glowering at her ankle, which come to think of it was bending rather oddly. Rhodey and Tony sat I front of the fireplace, Rhodey starting up a fire and Tony checking the prostheses structure supporting Rhodey’s legs.
Tony’s eyes went wide momentarily before he seemed to catch himself. He tried to look amused, huffing out a short breath as if to appear incredulous.
“How long have you…?” The man waved his hand around ambiguously, trying to find the right choice of words. Tony sighed, knowing of all people, he couldn’t hide anything from Rhodey.
Steve sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, before continuing.
“Aw, Cap c'mon, it’s visiting hours! We all wanna see how our leaders are doing,” Clint said with a smirk on his face, already strolling into the room and plonking himself into an armchair my the bed.
Steve didn’t really mention it – drawing up the conclusion that Tony had thought better they keep to side streets to avoid too much attention. Yet, when they were in the store, Tony made to move to pull up the hood of his jacket or keep his head down; in fact, he even knelt down and spoke to a few kids shopping with their parents, discretely paying for their groceries just to ease some of the tension the parents seemed to carry in their shoulders.
“Steve-”
, and Tony was ready to call it quits.
Tony barked out a surprised laugh at that, wincing as he jolted his ribs - an icepack bound loosely around his chest with bandages to hold it in place while he busied himself with Nat’s leg. “Did you seriously call me a bitch? I’ve never heard you call anyone
“Oh - piss off!” He lobbed a pillow at the group, who all scattered with varying noises of horror and disgust at the projectile.
Tony blinked, started by the sudden turn in conversation.
Ah, memories.
Sam swatted the archer over the back of the head, kissing his teeth at the man in disapproval. Rhodey sat on the couch by Tony, leaning down and tilting his friend’s chin upwards, evaluating the damage to his face, before placing a hand either side of his head firmly.
“The building has ventilation above it to release carbon dioxide, since it’s totally underground - those bunkers act as an airlock, which is what makes this place so hard to detect. Our best bet is to get out through the dead space above us, since we’re not exactly in the position to just walk back out the way we came.”
“You can cry about it later, but we’ve still got more running to do.”
“...I mean,” he could feel his face burning, “It’s not Tony I’m jealous
When he opened them, he caught Steve directing an open and fond gaze his way, which transformed to mild panic when he realised Tony saw him. Tony felt a leap in his chest, and just grinned genuinely at Steve - not one of his practised media-smiles plastered over his face, but a soft and slightly crooked smile, easily forming on his face.
Tony had paused, fist frozen mid-air, and the agent’s eyes were blown wide and startled. Steve only had a moment to realise what was happening; the deep echoing crack underneath them, and a split in the ice coming from under his body, headed like a bold of electricity towards the fight I front of him.
“Steve, you got my husband home in one piece, that’s better than what most people can manage - it’s my pleasure.”
“Uh - what the fuck is this?” Sam asked carefully, eyeing the viscous white-goo Steve had just played up in front of him.
“Not exactly,” he breathed. God - he thought he’d made some progress in flirting since his first attempt with Peggy, but Tony made him feel simultaneously like he was a scrawny kid from Brooklyn all over again, and like he was on cloud nine.
So they stayed at the tower, watching episode after episode of
And then there was Steve, the Adonis himself. His skin was smooth and water glided off of his chest like silk, and despite his skin being on the paler side, he looked absolute radiant. His golden hair had been plastered back on his head, beautifully exposing his strong features which were pulled into comfortable smiles and laughter. Tony’s heart skipped a beat at the sight of him, but instantly felt a pang of hurt at being stuck on the sidelines.
“You’re ridiculous,” Steve wheezed, trying to pull himself together, but he couldn’t wipe off the amused smile from his face if he tried. “Look, just, wander over there – I’ll be there, don’t worry – and just, try not to freak out, its just people in costumes, I mean, c’mon, shellhead-”
Sounds about right, Tony mused.
They brought him back up, and the gulped down the hot air like he was starving for it, only when we did, he choked and his airways flooded with ice, choking him intensely. Tony was suddenly grossly aware that he wasn’t in Afghanistan, he was drowning in a frozen lake in the middle of nowhere, scrambling for life with a fucking
“I’m serious! I mean, sure, that’s
“Well, I hope you’ll be considerate enough to have an open-casket then, since that’ll be my only chance at drawing you properly.”
be ready for it.
“Of course, Captain.” Jarvis unlocked the door, and Steve took one last shallow breath before grabbing the handle and entering. He’d been more calm infiltrating a Hydra base on his
” Clint cut Steve’s next question off his hand, watching as the blonde’s mouth snapped shut, jaw jutting forward. “That’s not something I’m gonna tell you.”
Bucky looked over at Steve, mouth in a casual frown and shrugging nonchalantly. The blonde nodded, considering, and stood up next to Sam.
Nat knew just as well as Bucky that they had a better chance of survival making a jump for it out the bay doors than being in the cockpit, where they’d most likely be skewered by the glass of the windshield when it shattered on impact.
, he’d told her, dead serious. Also… it was nice, dipping their toes into a community they’d always technically been in, but never felt
“The thought of losing you because you were saving me that kills me, Tony. Why didn’t you think of-?”
“You ran on this leg, didn’t you?” Bruce chastised, having settled down in front of her with a far more technical first-aid kit in hand than the one in the cabin.
“They were fucking on Clint’s kitchen counter,” Bucky said flatly, expression not betraying any form of lie.
She laughed despite herself. They were both exhausted, bloody, and bruised, it was honestly a miracle they’d gotten this far.
“Daddy, you said we couldn’t sit n’the counter!”
Putting years of media training to use, and acting as if he didn’t care, he shrugged of the shirt he was wearing, exposing his chest. Natasha turned to him smiling, but it quickly turned to a scowl when Tony ran up to her, and scooped her up in his arms, charging at the water.
Fifteen minutes later, Natasha emerged in the entrance hall in a beautiful white sundress, dark blue pumps, and a large sun hat - the brim extending enough to almost cover her shoulders.
“Okay,” Steve smiled back at him giddy with joy. He held Tony’s face, stroking his thumb across the brunette’s cheek, coaxing out a blush from him, before leaning back down and pushing their lips back together as he gently settled his weight over Tony’s body.
. Brunch is a cornerstone of modern gay culture - if you didn’t know that before, it’s vital that you do now, since…” she gestured at him with her hand.
“Fine, fine!” the brunette grumbled, begrudgingly following Steve over the edge of a small crowd watching the antics of the group.
Their gazes met then, for a few moments that felt like an eternity, living his stomach swimming wonderfully. And if Steve’s touch lingered over Tony a little longer than anyone else’s while they all shoved each other around playing volleyball, the brunette didn’t seem to mind.
Tony huffed irritably, though it lacked any real heat, as Clint chucked to himself.
Natasha and Bucky appeared in the doorway, walking backwards in a crouch, open firing into the corridor.
“I’m just going through some stuff right now, that’s all,” he smiled tightly, and Clint just gave him an unimpressed look.
"Why did you engage with Doom without backup?” Steve asked in a disturbingly calm voice, as if holding back from exploding in a fit of anger, avoiding  eye-contact all together. Steve had fished the StarkPad off his bedside table - Sam must’ve left it for him - and was skimming over the mission report.
“Hey, do you wanna sit down?”
Before one in the morning, Clint and Rhodey had drunk each other under the table - funnily enough, they were also passed out under the table - while Natasha and Jane danced childishly with Bruce, who was more or less merely being caught in the fray. Thor’s intoxicating laughter filled the room as he watched his Jane, usually more subdued, dance without a care in the world.
Now that Sam had said it, it was so painfully obvious.
After a few moments, the pair had shuffled closer to Nat, who made no indication she even knew they were there.
did you get that idea?”
Fury exchanged a look between Barnes, when Natasha piped up.
“Oh for god’s- don’t be such a baby-!”
where you look at each other nicely. Disgusting” Bucky mock-grumbled as he sauntered in, dropping himself on windowsill, followed by the others pizza boxes in hand. Steve just tossed a pillow at the guy’s head.
“Are you asking me?”
Steve had lit a fire, knowing they’d be there for a good while longer because of the storm messing up tracking technology, even my SHIELD’s standard. It was a pretty nasty storm after all. The team crowded round the small furnace, faces illuminated in the warm glow, despite feeling cold and bitter on the inside.
, that’s good,” the archer drawled, laying back against the tiles on the floor. Natasha crouched down next to Steve with Rhodey following closely behind her.
“Oh, so ‘
Steve grinned into Tony’s hair when the smaller man shuffled himself into Steve when they’d gotten into bed, making himself the little spoon. Contrary to popular belief, Tony Stark did like affection; he just had to be certain it would be mutual, save embarrassing himself.
Tony smiled - it
“Well, were off to Switzerland, I see,” Wanda smiled at him, just as Sam threw his head back and sighed something forlorn about not even getting over jet-lag from Norway, yet.
“-you okay?”
Steve had been living under the same roof as the other man for some time now, and in all of his unpredictable quirks and mannerisms, he still found himself being surprised by the genius in ways he had not before even considered.
“Nah, c'mon, let’s finish the game,” Steve announced, clapping his hands together.
I’d probably break down and cry,”
Tony came up spluttering and laughing, momentarily forgetting about the reactor. He stood up, and realised he’d popped up right in front of Steve, who was staring at him. What’s more, he was staring into his eyes, not his chest. His eyes were the most startling blue in front of him, despite being surrounded by the glittering waves around him.
“Yeah,” she agreed, “Clint knows about me - not about you though. Maybe we start there: I tell Rhodey about me, you tell Clint. That way, it starts off smaller, y’know?”
Tony was actually starting to look forward to training with the others again. Perhaps he might surprise them this time.
They crawled far enough until coming to a stop. Steve had been directing them, having analysed the buildings layout, guessing which way would get them closest to an exit. They heard voices coming from inside the vents being them - they’d managed to get into the room, then.
“He doesn’t have a problem with Morocco,” Bruce supplied, patting Tony on the shoulder as he walked past them to the elevator. “He has a problem with you being the one to decide,”
“Yeah, just…” he waved at the bag, still swinging as if that answered the question even remotely. (Hint: it did not.)
Steve held out his palm towards Tony, as if trying to soothe a wild animal, “Hey, it barely clipped me, but-”
Once in range, Tony focuses the barrel of the gun on the mark and pulled the trigger.
?” Clint was actually looking concerned now. Huh, maybe Steve hadn’t been wrong.
“Uh, excuse me? Didn’t I mention earlier I just naturally count the cards, or weren’t you listening?”
, Nat had lamented at some point, and now… Tony had to agree. Ever since he spent more time training with her, getting shit done rather than feeling like he needed to protect his ego. So, he didn’t really mind if they joked about him not keeping up with them, not just because Nat’s ‘take no shit’ outlook was rubbing off on him, but because he knew that in reality, he was training
“Yeah, probably not, I imagine they’re all running for the hills by now,” he half-heartedly shook his fist in the air, deadpan expression on his face “they’ll rue the day they messed with the Avengers, or whatever. Still, kinda didn’t wanna risk it - getting him more involved than he was already forced to be.”
“Really? Not even after we dealt with those mutant-things in the sewers a few months back?”
“Excellent,” Nat said without missing a beat, “Get a few, and some cheesy garlic bread while you’re at it,”
Steve just groaned, slumping back into the mattress. Tony’s big dark eyes gazed back at him, bleary with sleep. He hummed in confusion, and Steve pressed a kiss against his forehead, salty with sweat.
Tony had surged forward then, and firmly placed his mouth over Steve’s, enticing a whimper from the blonde, who cupped the back of the smaller man’s head and held him close. Tony’s lips were soft and pliable, and he moaned gorgeously when Steve led him back against the cool tiles of the floor, swinging a leg over the brunette’s hips, pushing him down with the weight of his muscular body and deepening the kiss.
“What’re you doing, agent?” Tony spun round at the voice, thankful he decided to keep his helmet on, visor down. Natasha entered the room, discretely shutting the door behind her.
“How long do you reckon?” Natasha asked, brow furrowed curiously.
again,” Steve admitted.
“But what?” Tony snapped, causing Steve to flinch inwardly.
this is your doing, how the hell did you teach him that?! Actually, better yet, how the
“She’s uh - she’s pretty good I guess.”
“Which is an asshole-way of saying cheating, got'cha, Shellhead,”
“HOW COULD I NOT, TONY!”
Daylight was starting the break over the horizon, illuminating the snow outside, casting a soft glow into the cabin.
“Tony, what are you doing?” Steve asked slowly, eyes flicking around the street for any signs of danger.
find him funny.
Steve retreated this in his head like a mantra, but still couldn’t will himself to move. Sucking in one last breath of air, Steve jumped as Bucky slid past him, and dove headfirst into the ice.
“We’re hardly functional.” Tony deadpanned, before nervously chewing his lip and speaking up again.
“I mean, like you said, you’re happy single.”
“It’s not infected, thank God, but you’ll probably need stitches.”
“Can you get ‘em on the line, FRIDAY?”
The following morning, Tony and Natasha were sitting on the steps of the cabin porch when the familiar sound of the quinjet’s engine came within earshot. Nat adjusted her grip on the paper cup full of sickly-sweet hot chocolate that the resort owner had given them when they asked to use the phone, clearly taking pity on them. They’d been too exhausted to properly wash, and with no other option, has slept in the same clothes they’d made their great escape in.
Bucky and Sam approached him, rolling their shoulders and stretching out their quads as they did so.
“Nada I’m afraid,” Natasha tossed a glance his way and a frown made its way between her brows.
“Wait! I lost my flip-flops!”
, he’d said. If his friends had picked up on his half-assed excuse, they hadn’t called him out on it.
came Thor’s voice over the comm - Tony kept an earpiece on separate to the armour, so he wouldn’t be out the loop if he ended some air against his head. Thor’s voice was strained and curt, no doubt busy with another wave of bots keeping him occupied.
Steve suddenly stopped, pupil’s blown wide with lust, yet unease settled behind them.
Tony was still smiling as Steve came to stand in front of him, passing him one of the mugs in his hands.
? How did I miss that and you didn’t, you were basically passed out!” He huffed, amused, “He’s an opportunist, then. I can appreciate that - we
“I think I know that hat - that hat abducted me, it did things to me and now I can’t have children!” Clint said, stood in his obscene purple flip flops.
“Everyone else seems to have forgiven me now,” Steve sighed, twiddling his fingers together, casting a cautious look at the other man.
“Because it wasn’t the most important thing Hydra has on their agenda,”
“Yeah, please.” Tony would never admit to Bruce he actually didn’t mind the stuff - it had become kind of a group joke to gag at whatever blend Bruce was having, even though they all pillaged his stash behind his back. Not that Bruce hadn’t caught on, of course.
“Do you reckon we’re starting to get too old for that shit?” Rhodey groaned, shielding his eyes from the sunlight that was slowly basking the room in an orange glow from where it peered over the horizon, already enticingly warm.
On the other side of the jet, a medic was evaluating Sam’s arm, raising it to see when and where it hurt, nodding sympathetically when the man grit his teeth. Rhodey was laughing with Clint, who was currently shirtless with a large bandage wrapped around his torso, applying light pressure to the break. Steve was smiling at the two men, laughing alongside them every so often, while Tony was sat at Rhodey’s feet, receiving a gentle head massage that made his eyes roll shut.
“What do you want to ask me, Nat?” He sighed fondly, nerves beginning to prickle up his spine.
Tony and Nat answered unanimously, “It was shit.”
, her mind supplied. Before she could say anything, she felt the weight being lifted off her feet entirely, instinctively hooking her arm around Tony’s neck as he pulled her into his arms and bolted towards it. She realised he was talking - well, shouting - between ragged breaths.
“You too, bitch.
It became a regular thing between them, going to this little upscale but cosy place to have brunch. They weren’t ever bothered by anyone, and always got the same table towards the back. The servers started to expect them, always smiling happily when they came in. It wasn’t one of those places that made a statement about privacy - NDA’s and phones taken at the door to stop unsavoury photos of celebrities getting snapped and spread all over social media. But the staff and customers alike respected a need for a private and safe-space; not for famous-faces, but for a community that was far too familiar with the fear of being ‘caught out’.
“You’re soaked through - don’t try and tell me super soldiers don’t feel the cold, you need to start warming yourself back up, and I don’t care if it hurts your dignity,” Sam pushed Bucky down by his shoulder, plonking him next to Tony, and bringing the blankets that currently swamped Tony over the other man’s shoulders too.
Bucky collapsed forward onto his hands and knees, dropping a limp Tony on his back on the bank. Tony’s eyes were blown wide, and his nose was at an awkward angle, gushing with blood. Natasha scooped him up, supporting him from under his armpits,mane started leading him back to the cabin, Steve and Bucky a few short paces behind.
Crashing out of the trees, they came to a stop, Tony panting frantically - feet now planted on tarmac instead of dirt - and Nat aimed her gun at the figure silhouetted by headlights, hands raised.
Steve watched the scene with a warm buzz from the balcony, having used Thor’s mead as a mixer for most drinks just to feel the effects. Tony skunk in beside him, his head rolling back in a hysteric laugh at the scene before them. Steve jumped suddenly when Tony seemed to lose his footing, easing them both into the cool tile floor as Tony continued to giggle to himself.
“Care to join me, fellas?”
Tony noticed the other three looking at him expectantly, and he huffed an air of annoyance. Of course, because he was without his suit he should be the one to stay behind, because without it, he’s as good as a civilian. Steve read as much on Tony’s scowl, and sighed gently.
“I am, but you don’t have to date the guy…” she teased, wiggling her eyebrows, “or is that not really your thing, anymore?”
“Get off my damn kitchen-worktop.”
That wasn’t good news.
Then Barnes issued the order, and they jumped.
played softly in the background.
Natasha hadn’t made one comment since the battle finished, absorbed completely in her own thoughts.
Thor was wearing a tasteful Hawaiian shirt - as tasteful as a Hawaiian shirt really can be, though, which isn’t very tasteful - accompanied by Jane who had a simple pair of loose fitted trousers and a clean button up shirt.
“It’s not luck, I think you actually might like me, really.”
“…Wants to sleep with you?”
Natasha and Tony marched in unison toward the communications room, while Bucky and Steve patrolled the corridors surrounding the room, ready to notify the other pair of any suspicious activity. They couldn’t blow their cover before getting the message to S.H.I.E.L.D out.
Okay, so he wasn’t oblivious to the tension between him and Tony. Everyone knew about it - they were like hot and cold, they bickered relentlessly, started shouting matches only every week it seemed, and had a very complicated past when it came to each other, extending prior to their actual first meeting. But the tension had started to dissipate into something more… interesting? Was the best way Steve could describe it.
Steve was jealous of the bond Tony and Natasha had. That was it. It was understandable as well, they were clearly open with one another, and comfortable in a way Steve himself hadn’t seen them be with other members of the team. They weren’t better friends with each other than anyone else, they just had something… different.
Tony realised he’d been quiet for a few seconds, before nodding.
“You, uh… you
did you pull that off man?!” Clint was getting up, not even remotely upset, just genuinely interested. Clint could laugh at anything - but between a strange mixture of being impressed, shocked, and turned-on, Steve began to feel an icy, creeping realisation.
“Nope. Not robbed.”
“Gentleman, it was a pleasure-” Tony grinned, scooping his winnings into his arms. “So, just to get this right - each chip is an hour worth of you filling out post-mission paperwork, Steven?” The brunette asked innocently.
Bucky flicked through the files on him, the other Winter Soldier projects, tossing relevant ones over the Steve, who was mostly engrossed in them, but kept flicking his gaze up to Tony.
“Shut up man, this is
“God, no one warned me you were as much of an ass as-”
he had no doubt that this would be the hottest they’d get for the rest of the year as well. They’d spent most of the afternoon kicking around in the shallow ends of the water, blasting music and eating an obscene amount of food. But between an entire team of superheroes that also happened to consist of a literal demi-God, two supersoldiers, and Bruce - who’d transformed for a mission just the day before - so, it was a little more understandable.
“No, no don’t tell him I told you-”
When he entered, Tony was sitting cross-legged on one of his rug’s. True to Nat’s warning, there were bits of wiring and metal, circuit boards and intricate tools Steve was sure he’d probably snap between his fingers if he attempted to operate them.
She nodded her head in agreement, before quirking an eyebrow, indicating a counter-argument to his rather weak excuse. “You
“Tony can count cards,” Nat grinned mischievously, and Rhodey hid his laughter behind his fist.
He’d told them about his… feelings, more or less. He’d not been as honest as he could have been, but he also didn’t want them thinking he was being irrational (or for them to look deeper into the things Steve himself was stubbornly refusing to acknowledge, like said feelings towards Tony).
“Do you need help?”
sulking on the sofa. “You’ve been awful quiet, you good?”
“Buck.”
“Good news is they won’t be able to intercept it unless the physically dismantle this computer, so we’ll have to hold them off long enough for it to reach Nick, then get the hell outta here.”
“We probably should have just asked that guy for his phone. I honestly don’t think they’re still after us.”
“Y'know… I gotta be honest with you, Tony… When this first started happening, I didn’t think much of it,” Steve mumbled, barely able to hold Tony’s gaze. “I jus’ thought it was a step-up from being at each other’s throats - bet then it just kept going up, and it still hasn’t stopped,” he wet his lips before continuing.
“What I mean, is that, when I…when I knew how you felt – about me – I was scared because-”
The doors hissed open and immediately the team were encompassed my the freezing-cold air whipping through the door. Bucky grabbed onto one of the yellow handles with this metal arm and craned his head out the door, judging the drop distance from the falling aircraft.
Her eyes widened as she snorted loudly. “What, no, of course not - why the hell do you need to ask?”
interest in any man - but rather over Tony, who actually
AI- you’re my AI, Jarv!”
He told her that while they’d been stuck in that cell; she’d asked him why he’d turned down her offer so many times, and Tony can still see how she was trying to so casually bring it up, but that he’d actually hurt her feelings and
Clint and Tony got into their stances, before the archer made a quick-pace forward, striking out at his opponent. To his credit, Tony made a very sharp dodge - precise even. The next time Clint made that manoeuvre, Tony not only dodged it again, but locked Clint’s outstretched arm in a hold and managed to swing Clint to the side. Of course, the archer rolled with the movement elegantly, landing in a crouched position and looking up at the genius, surprise adorning his features.
His hand was trash, then.
Steve collapsed like a rag-doll, as if the strings holding him up had been slashed, he dropped to the floor and made no motion of getting up.
, that makes me sound like such a jerk, shit, sorry-”
“I will hurl this at your head, Tony,” Natasha said mildly, twirling a fork between her fingers. Her eyes were sparkling though, clearly seeing the humour in the situation.
Before he could even finish his sentence, Steve had turned to look at whatever Tony was staring at, and he felt realisation wash over him.
Hulk made easy work of the debris, taking less than a few minutes to get through. He would’ve made even faster work of it if the others hadn’t made him promise not to smash through, something about not letting the building collapse on their leaders.
waking up seeing our carpet on fire?”
“Couple of months-”
“I wanted to, Tony,
“Certainly not like you do.”
Steve pulled the Asguardian into a hug, huffing out a sigh when they pulled back.
Steve gave her a steady look, hands out as if approaching a wild animal in submission - not a seven-year-old.
“Detonate the others” Doom seethed through gritted teeth. Tony watched as Doom gave him one last murderous look, before the bot took off in flight, far away from the current battleground.
Before Steve knew it, he reached Tony’s floor. He ducked back, using one of the glass frames to check his reflection, inwardly berating himself for fussing with his hair and checking his teeth.
Tony wet his lips, and cleared the lump in his throat with a small cough before speaking.
“Kotonyok, he won’t care - whoever he is, and if you tell anyone I said this I’ll just deny it, but you are a very beautiful guy,”
Tony saw red, firing up the repulsers on his boots and lunged at Doom, swinging at his metal-coated face, then tightening a lethal grip around Doom’s neck. Doom scrambled at the armour, trying to maintain a grip out of desperation, Tony thought maliciously. This coward had put his team, his family, through hell and back more than enough times, and now had almost taken his Captain from him. Because although Steve wasn’t technically his per say, Tony felt it like a throb in his heart that Steve
Steve watched over Nat with concern written all over his face, before noting a silent exchange between Rhodey and Tony at the corner of his eye.
“Some essentials,” she replied, “emergency food, spare clothes - ones in one piece, that is, flashlights, first-aid, few rounds of ammo. It’s all that I could really recover.” Bucky nodded in understanding, the jet had been a wreck when it landed; they all salvaged as much as they could, but they weren’t exactly in an abundance of supplies.
“Thing is, there are, like, three guest rooms in this place - not that I need to tell you, we’ve been here before and have been staying here, but…”
That evening back at the villa, everyone sat down around the dining table which was littered with poker chips and playing cards. Sam dealt the cards round expertly, and Steve grinned at Bucky who was sat towards his elbow.
