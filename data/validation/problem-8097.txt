“Yeah,” Steve can’t keep the bitterness out of his voice. He’s envious of the ways in which Tony survived their falling out. He still gets to be Tony Stark and Iron Man and an Avenger. He gets to keep his name, his team, his purpose. Steve gets a damaged shield and
.” Tony laughs, high-pitched and hysterical. “I even let you fuck me to keep you here so what exactly does it take with you, Rogers?”
Steve doesn’t know how to gag anyone safely. And besides, he needs to be able to hear Stark speak because he still clings to the hope Tony might say
“Easy, Rogers,” Tony says, not unkindly, but the use of his last name almost throws Steve out of whatever uneasy peace he’s made with the situation.
“You aren’t sleeping,” she said. It was not a question.
“It looks even worse in person.” Sam eyes the facial hair and Steve is suddenly conscious of how different he looks since they last stood together. He doesn’t need to shave or keep his hair regulation short anymore. Now the length only serves to mark the passage of time.
Steve swallows thickly. “I was wrong.”
“I want what you want,” Strange replied, remarkably even-keeled.
Clint looked up. “It’s spooky when you do that. It’s not mine. With that bruise you’re sporting you sure it’s not yours?”
Bucky’s basement apartment is small and cramped. His neighbours are ex-SHIELD agents. He has an outpatient schedule taped to the wall and a mattress on the floor. Steve knows Tony offered more but Bucky declined. On the coffee table is a cardboard box containing an array of brown envelopes standing at attention; all unaddressed, all unsealed. Bucky doesn’t try to give them away anymore but he still writes them. It’s what the dead deserve.
“You can’t stop me,” Tony said thickly. Exhaustion had worn him thin leaving only caffeine to prop him up like a marionette.
Just a collection of songs I wrote to for
He starts with the top two buttons of his shirt. “Yes or no?”
“I don't want to hurt you.”
She does, even if she never answers him anymore. The globe shudders and the data from the weather radar satellites update in real time. The swirling mass of the typhoon is approaching the Accords-blue cluster of islands that are Maldecia and Steve’s fists clench tighter with each iteration as it inches closer. From above it looks harmless, a messy swirl of colour. From ground level it is the closest thing in existence to the wrath of God.
Steve isn’t around enough anymore to catch the lie.
“Beautiful,” Steve whispers.
More dark/horror one-shots can be found here:
That’s the detail that Steve keeps circling back to day after day. He adheres to Natasha’s instructions and keeps Kovalchyk off the record but he picks at him like an open sore. Neither Tanaka nor Bucky have heard of him but even though FRIDAY is nominally kept out of the North Wing it’s not like Tony couldn’t get access to the Winter Soldier’s files -
, and the sting of being left behind. Hanahaki is the disease of the lovelorn and Steve reached deep down into Tony’s lungs and tore any such love out by the root.
He’s sure sex isn’t supposed to be like this. They used to be a team.
. It’s every dark accusation Steve has ever wanted to hurl at Stark but packing more weight because they’re coming from someone Tony still respects.
A bite, a bond, a whisper in the right ear.
Tony is correct. The doors are locked but that has never stopped Steve. Even through the layer of burlap, the first hit with the shield dents the triple-ply steel. The sound isn’t the sharp ring of years past but the vibrations the impact sends up Steve’s arm are familiar on their own.
“My name is Dr. Robert Kovalchyk,” the stranger lifts his teacup in acknowledgement, “and you are Captain Steven Rogers.”
Tony keeps pacing the corridor like a man before his execution. “How much?”
“There weren’t a lot of them in Poland,” Steve says quietly.
“What are we losing? Our fantastic working relationship? Our friendship built on mutual trust and respect?” Stark counts them off like those were never things they had and lost. “C’mon Captain America, save me from myself. Pep’s gone, Rhodey’s gone. There’s a bottle of scotch upstairs screaming at me and there’s nothing in my workshop anyone wants me playing with right now.” Stark’s voice is unsteady. “If it helps don’t think of it as doing me a favour, think of it as saving the world from me.”
coming from you, Cap.”
Steve backs off, a strange lump in his throat. “I know. You’re doing your best and - thank you, Nat.”
Tony flicks his wrist and tosses the keys to Steve. His voice is raw. “Can’t have me die in an actual car accident can we? I’d never escape the irony.”
. Peter had used those exact words but they didn’t come out as light as intended. Nor should they have: when Steve and Tony fought they tended to take the Avengers down with them. The team was unsettled like birds before a thunderstorm sensing the charging electric currents in the air. A hurricane was on the horizon and they instinctively took up their positions, choosing before being forced to. Luke began hanging around the Mansion more, Carol hung around less. Someone sent the cadets away early every day.
“Don’t move,” Steve orders and before Tony can dispute it, “I just want to look.”
I am absolutely dedicated to the idea that Steve has never taken more than three minutes cumulative thinking about his sexuality. He was a sickly kid raised in the forties and was in his early twenties when he joined the army. I just don't think he spends too much time thinking about esoteric subjects.
He motions toward the pit. “Crew will be in at first light to fix it. I’ll get Vision to put in a temporary seal when he wakes up. Or gets up I suppose since he doesn’t need to sleep but insists on trying anyway.”
“Some nights he can barely look at me. But he still comes.”
The yellow paint of the Lamborghini is glossy and obnoxious but the leather is cool as Steve slides behind the wheel. He makes a show of checking the mirrors so he doesn’t have to look at Tony in the passenger seat.
“That was literally the first thing I asked when I got here, you said no.”
“Can I help you, Stephen?” Steve asked, still engrossed in the latest road rage pantomime being performed before them.
Bucky gives a smile back, sweet and soft, and Steve doesn’t recognize it at all. That’s when he realizes that Stark hasn’t taken this from him.
Kovalchyk clears his throat and Steve suddenly remembers they have an audience.
It’s amazing how regardless of the situation Stark can instantly make himself into Steve’s greatest frustration. “You’re joking, right?” he growls. “There’s an unauthorized civilian in the Avengers kitchen at 3 am, FRIDAY’s ignoring me, and a Code White went out 20 minutes ago and you’ve only now decided to show up!”
“You really think the
“No, that’s never the way round it goes, is it?” Tony’s eyes glittered cruelly. “I play the part so much better than you.” He was too close now and Steve could feel the heat of his body. “You’re such a forgiving soul. What do I have to do to you before you finally get it? Erase your mind a third time?”
“No.” Steve doesn’t think his fingers would come loose if he ordered them to.
“It was,” Tony said mildly. “The small punishments I could live with; half a day in the gag, three without food… My first escape resulted in one person from every house I passed to be drowned. He found me through the bond ninety-six hours later. They died for nothing.
————————————
Stark shoots her a nasty look. “Don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing.”
Steve voice sounds like it’s coming from the other end of a long tunnel. “You never said no.”
The entreaty has the opposite of the intended effect. Frustration surges back into Stark’s frame, his mouth twisting. “Where was all this can we talk crap six months ago? You came back for him, you’ll beg for him, you'll throw yourself at my mercy. You’ll even say please. All for him. Why?”
“I’ll do whatever it takes to give Bucky a chance, you know that.” When Steve looks up he realizes he’s somehow said something very, very wrong.
Tony doesn’t know what changed.
“No,” Tony’s eyes are flint, “your mistakes just break other things.”
This is the worst, most intimate thing Steve ever learns about Stark:
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. No need to work yourself into a twist. It just chafes a bit.” The new arm is fiberglass and plastic and silicone, built for comfort and designed by doctors. That doesn’t make it faultless.
An eternity passes in the space of minutes, momentous in its hollowness.
The stranger nods. He moves slowly, whether due to age or caution is moot. The cane and overcoat are abandoned and he keeps both hands open and in Steve’s field of view even if he’s otherwise impervious to Steve’s gaze. He lumbers carefully to his feet.
and it’s killing him. Nothing so dramatic as murder but the lack of purpose is hollowing him out one spoonful at a time.
“What always happens with us. We were allies and friends and then we fell apart. We fought, I lost, but not before I did my share of damage; including killing the man the Captain actually loved. He caught other-me but apparently torture and hanging was too light a sentence, so when I came through he got a second chance. He took a different approach that time.”
Then again, “This coffee is terrible.”
. Dinner will be cold leftovers followed by restless sleep and tomorrow morning he will be right back here on this path, going nowhere except in circles.
Steve tries not to let his mind run wild. “I don’t know. Kovalchyk can't do much from Toronto - "
“You don’t remember?” came a sharp familiar voice.
Tony blinked and the same fire shower was raining down from the sky. It was impossible to say how much time had passed. He couldn’t even be sure he’d blacked out but there was semen on his abdomen, already cooling. He didn’t remember the orgasm.
Rogers? He has absolutely zero problems saying no to me regardless of the consequences, up to and including breaking international law and going on the lam. Barring that, he’s a super soldier with at least 40 pounds of muscle on me and last time even the suit didn’t stop him.”
“I can’t sleep in this place,” Steve confessed. The hushed words rustled past Tony’s ear and he wasn’t sure if he was meant to hear them or if they were meant for a dead man.
Psychiatrist, psychologist, behaviorist. Steve doesn’t remember the difference but he remembers what Zemo pretended to be and how terribly that went for everyone. Steve was a fool for believing that Stark and the government could keep Bucky safe. If the stranger’s here to activate the Winter Soldier then the Avengers are currently under attack and -
“I know.” Tony stared at the stained glass. “He knew it too. He didn’t hurt me, not really. His Stark had to deal with all the physical tortures, the Captain was bored of them by the time I came through. The bond was my punishment. He made it as tight and strong as he could. He could feel every bit of my distress like it was his own and he hated me so much it was worth it. He’d just look at me and it was like I was drowning inside my own head, in his contempt for me, his outrage. Every time he marked me he had to restrain himself from tearing out my throat.” Tony’s breath curled in the air. “And the bond made me want to please him anyway. How fucked up is that?”
One more time than he can justify to himself. Steve’s reached the end of his rope. He never anticipated how hard it would be to climb up again.
Steve’s breath catches, a sob stuck in his throat.
Tony looks at him skeptically and then shrugs. “It’s your home too. For however long it lasts.”
He tries for a reassuring smile but Bucky’s expression is flat. “You miss it. Avenging.”
“There are no electric sheep involved and unconsciously processing the day’s memories takes him all of 20 seconds.”
Tony came back smelling like the sea.
Steve turned and in one smooth motion used his shield to slice into Iron Man. The vibranium cleaved through the exposed thoracic seam as a garbled transmission echoed through the comms. Steve leaned over the downed suit and pried one of the mini-arc reactors loose. It may as well have been an armed grenade as he lobbed it towards what could only be MODOK’s broadcast antenna. There was a bang and then the robot swarm dropped to the pavement, lifeless.
When Steve opens his eyes he’s greeted to a different holographic display. It’s a Christmas that never - and could never - happen. Sarah Rogers was dead by the time her son left for the army, there’s no way she could by talking to Peggy who looks as vibrant as the day Steve first met her. On the love seat to their left are the Bartons; Clint and Laura restraining Cooper and Lila from darting for the presents beneath the oversized Christmas tree. Natasha has a fascinated Nathaniel slung over her left hip as she chats with Pepper.
Tony shivered and it wasn’t the cold. He looked into a puddle at the edge of the lake and caught a glimpse of a monster: a demon with tired red eyes and a too long beard with a ring of livid purple bruises around his throat that only ached now that Tony remembered they were there and who had given them to him.
Teacups are filled, two this time and Steve accepts his black without complaint. Kovalchyk adds lemon. “By 1941 he was here in the US, nursing his hatred of the Germans and with Walas’s ideas rattling around his brain. He was adopted by the American government who put him to work for a brilliant man named Howard Stark.”
Steve’s voice is hoarse. “At least I’ll know what I’m hating.”
The bright lemon yellow of a Lamborghini rounds the bend, lithe body racing too close to the ground as it pulls into the diner parking lot. Steve just stares into his coffee and waits for the future to catch up to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Shame smothered the primal urges down to embers. Stephen was Tony’s friend, he was
“Tony - ” Steve had murmured desperately as blood leaked through his fingers. “ - you can’t leave me. Don’t - “
This is the only ending I could think to write. One where Steve recognizes what he’s lost and what he’s never had and starts to rebuild something of his own. Tony gets sobriety, Rhodey and Pepper, and a version of Steve that he trusts to drive when he needs a rest. I will never not love the Steve-and-Tony recruitment scenes from the comics so that’s in there too.
“You didn’t. Tony’s stronger than that.”
and you’re still here. So what exactly do you want from me?”
————————————
“He’s killed fewer people than you,” Tony argues. “Fewer than Wanda, than the Winter Soldier, the Hulk, Thor. Me, of course. He’s ahead of Natasha as far as I know which isn’t that far. Barton’s somewhere around there too.”
“What?” Tony’s near panicking now as he squirms under where Steve is leaning over his back, partially pinning him. “No. Non-negotiable,
Instead he found the ocean: endless and clear. Pleasant enough, but nothing like Steve remembered.
The anecdotes were meted out in clusters. There would be hours of silence followed by a deluge. Once Tony started it was if a damn had burst and he couldn’t help but lance the boil. He told Steve about having his fingers broken and public humiliations. About separating the people who abused you from those you knew in a different life. He sung the song of his own death until Steve had memorized every word.
Every time he visits Francesca he brings flowers back from her garden. He gives them away to gas station clerks or diner waitresses. Some end up in the North Wing on Tanaka’s desk, others are gifted to Kovalchyk when Steve passes him late at night in the halls. The ones that avoid those fates end up in the kitchen in a glass of water. One night Steve finds the flowers neatly rearranged, stems cut, in a vase and he smells the old familiar scent of the sea. Rhodes is alone in the living room despite it being a Thursday all of which means -
Steve forces himself not to react. He keeps his tone even and matter-of-fact. “Tanaka says the one he has is the best they can do.”
refuse.”
“I know you are,” Steve replied leadenly.
“FRIDAY, verify.”
Stark smiles, properly bitter, but at least he still sounds like Tony. “What you told me to. I made myself
Steve can see the evidence of their (his) failure shining out of Stark’s eyes and Stark huffs out a laugh of victory when Steve has to violently wrench his gaze away. He finds himself staring at the shield lying on the couch. This morning he found it bundled in a burlap bag and resting against his door. It used to be Captain America’s shield. It’s corrupted now; dark flecks of long-dried blood spill across the white star and scorch marks from repulsors have obliterated the paint in places. The scour marks from T’challa’s claws mar the perfect geometry, throwing off its balance. There’s a shallow dent in the rim where vibranium met starkium and won.
Their visits take place in a secured room now. Neither of them can pretend that they aren’t being recorded. The exposure makes Steve’s skin crawl but Bucky doesn’t even look alive. His skin is sallow and pale, eyes red-rimmed. He drifts in and out of the perfectly compliant silence that is the Soldier’s default programming. He still eats like clockwork but he can’t keep anything down. Steve would suspect poison if he didn’t know better.
“FRIDAY, lights out.”
Steve let his eyes close. That explained so much. “I’m sorry.”
“I haven’t asked him for anything since he came back.” The words scratched Steve’s throat on the way out. “He’s said no, I don’t expect him to change his mind.”
did I need for that?”
They deserve to be remembered.
Steve’s head is still spinning. “You call him Anthony. No one calls him Anthony.”
They were all funerary cairns; every one of the dozen structures dotting the plain marked a death. It was then that Tony saw what Cap had: embedded in the torso of the cairn among the dazzling shards of ore was a cracked arc reactor. He curbed the urge to reach for it.
The meteorites should have been Tony’s first warning: gravity didn’t work right in this place. He fell like Alice down the rabbit hole; slowly through inky blackness, eyes wide open but with nothing to latch onto. A bright, sharp sting broke his fall with a heavy thud. Tony lay there, desperately trying to realign his reality before he realized that the pain he felt was
It’s not as if Tony hasn’t done this before and is proving that now, coaxing responses from Steve that he holds back behind locked teeth. Stark curls his tongue and sucks and a small broken sound leaves Steve’s throat. He quickly swallows down the ones that follow - silence the one unbroken rule.
and if that was the case there was nothing to tell.” He shuffles the papers around to give his hands something to do. “It wasn’t fine. Tony found out everything at once. His parents, the Winter Soldier,
Tony tried to control his breathing, his tongue suddenly too big for his mouth. “How bad?”
matttered less. The chorus of Avengers and henchmen alike had paused to allow the villain his moment in the spotlight. They all knew their roles by now. Evil appeared, the Avengers were summoned. They clashed, they retreated, and lived to fight another day. Deja vu.
“Three very unpleasant days that we could spare him,” Richards corrected.
Steve waited forty agonizing minutes before he used his override codes to enter the locked suite. Tony was stepping out of the shower, skin pink from hot water and scrubbing, but intact, whole, alive. Steve just crossed the room and hugged him tight, buried his nose in Tony’s still dripping hair and inhaled, hunting for the familiar scent he once knew so well. That mix of metal shavings, ionized air, and
“Do you know what happened to their Peter?” Steve asked.
Comments are welcome and appreciated.
as defined by Natasha has a different meaning than its accepted use but Steve takes her point. It’s difficult for him to accept that the battle is over and the crisis has passed. This is just what normal and home look like now.
The stranger doesn’t seem perturbed by Tony's miraculous appearance. “I thought I’d have some tea. I apologize for the mess in your kitchen.”
“You. I need you,” Tony confessed and Steve’s heart stopped. “Stay. Please.”
“Don’t lie. You don’t have to tell me specifics but - ” he bites himself off before please, “don’t lie.”
Steve had no idea how he got back to the Tower. He went through the motions with perfect precision but the actual journey was static. He was calm. It was probably denial.
The electronic voice sounds cautious.
They didn’t work well enough. Tony was gentler sure, but he still pushed Peter away, fobbing him off on Banner or Rhodey.
Steve shivered. The ice held.
“Iron Man,” Steve chokes out in warning. Tony’s armed and Bucky’s literally a sitting target -
Steve draws a sharp breath because that’s -
Steve had rasped. He was never good with words and putting them to paper twice had been like getting blood from a stone.
A single tear carved out a clean track as it streaked down Steve’s mud-stained face. “Yes.”
“How is he?” Bucky asks tentatively.
“Want to tell me what that was about?” Bucky asks, handing Steve a water bottle.
Tony's expression shuts down. “No.”
It was unusual for Steve to attend mass on Sunday. He sat in a pew at the back of the vaunted cathedral and tried to find comfort in the familiar prayers or the simple presence of people gathered for worship. The children shifted in their seats, trying to hurry the sermon along. Half the adults followed suit. The priest’s sermon today was on Community Acceptance and Steve wondered when fire and brimstone went out of fashion. If Rome still taught that the Devil had horns and a forked tongue or if they imagined beautiful fallen Lucifer with blackened wings. If they warned you of that most magnificent of his lies:
“No,” Tony said. He expected a rasp but his voice was undamaged. “That’s sort of the point. I know I’m getting us out of here. I know we’re going that way.” He pointed across the desert.
“None of us did it on purpose.”
Steve still needed to know, his voice barely a whisper. “When we were in the castle, at the very beginning, how did you fall off the parapet?”
“I promise I’ll stay away from him,” Steve says even though she didn’t ask it of him. She’d asked it of Tony.
Steve thinks of bruises and promises. “It doesn’t matter.”
The veil shimmered ominously.
“It started as a joke, I swear, but I wasn’t going to suffer alone so we’re all committed now.”
"You asked who gave us the authority to do this. Tony did," Bruce said, arms crossed. "His only rule was that you never find out. He knew you’d disapprove.”
Natasha’s mask hardens again. “For all intents and purposes you’re his jailer. He’s stuck here. He needs you.”
“No.” The irresistible smell of ripeness wasn’t enough to cover the rottenness of fear or the fact Tony couldn’t quite look him in the eye. Instead Tony’s gaze wandered down Steve’s body to his rather obvious erection and Steve had never hated his own biology more. He crossed to the door before a hand caught his wrist.
Natasha ends up in emergency surgery before they fly her back Stateside. Helen Cho is on her way from Seoul, Rhodes is presenting to the UN, Vision is onsite in Turkey, and Stark is doing damage control on all PR fronts. There’s no one left to stay by her side except Steve and mercifully after a few sharp words no one objects. He doesn't leave her side for close to 68 hours and the beard he’s starting to grow makes him look like a stranger.
“With some of it.”
By the time his fingers arrive at his belt Steve still hasn’t moved. “Stop."
“I did, didn’t I.” Tony sighs. “I hate it when you’re right.”
For a moment Tony looks chagrined, as if he’d allowed himself to hope differently and now only has himself to blame. “Then why do you care? Either the Accords fail or I do and you get to watch it all from the front row.”
Tony smelled sour, sick, like old sweat. The clean smell of the ocean replaced with the hollow scent of loss and rot. Underneath it though was finally something Steve recognized. “You smell like you again.”
"Very." There was gravel in Steve’s throat. “It was never your choice.”
This is how the dream ends: running through a labyrinth with hunters hot on his heels but Steve’s happy and Bucky smiles and it doesn’t matter if they’re right or wrong because they’re free.
“He tried to kill you?” Steve’s voice is dead serious.
The Captain still held sway, even here.
“You’re still pissed, message received,” Tony’s disembodied voice broke in. “Stephen just texted me your refusal along with an
Steve looks out over Francesca’s garden at the colours exploding in sequence. Green, blue, purple, violet, magenta, black, orange, yellow, red, pink, white, teal -
Tony would rather die. He still might.
Steve stands next to Tony as the patter of rain slows. “It’ll be enough for what comes. We’ll be enough.”
The sand was too hot for the warmth to be soothing so Tony just led Steve back to the nearest skeleton tree and shuddered when he saw his own chestplate subsumed into the trunk. Of the pair of them Steve was normally the one who ran hot but now Steve’s skin felt like death warmed over. Tony stripped him down as far as he could and snuggled close, careful not to jostle Steve’s wound. It felt like cuddling a corpse, albeit one who insisted he couldn’t feel the cold. Tony supposed, now that he thought about it, that dead men couldn’t feel one way or the other.
Really?”
It’d be easier to trust Tony if he wasn’t like this: unpredictable and independent. Operating on knowledge you don’t have and that he won’t deign to tell you. (It’d be easier to trust Tony if Steve thought Tony trusted him back.)
“I was afraid…” Bucky winces. “I was afraid if he found out you knew he wouldn’t come back.”
Tony’s lips quirked, mind decidedly unchanged. “Maybe. But we’ll never find out.” He got to his feet. “You’re not going to Hell, Steve, and I don’t believe in the afterlife. We settle our scores here or not at all.”
Steven Grant Rogers is ninety-six years old. He has lived twenty-eight years.
In the Ether,
“Hands,” Tony bites out when they break for air which isn’t the order Steve thought was coming next.
Steve didn’t say. It was such an unfair thing to ask.
There’s not another soul in the kitchen. It’s empty, but not quite. There’s a slight hum and the screen behind Steve lights up in blue. It’s a list of names, all with the prefix Doctor and with their SHIELD background checks attached. Steve has been trapped under FRIDAY’s watchful eye for an entire year and even if she wasn’t speaking to him she saw all of it and she never got to turn away. It’s no mystery why she hasn’t forgiven Steve.
Today the target was MODOK throwing a hissy fit in Times Square. He was delivering his monologue with his usual impotent vigor and Steve’s eyes glazed over.
Tony lets Steve’s words linger, then he tips his head back against the wall, exposing the column of his throat. “Why the hell are you still giving me this speech, Cap?”
Steve lay back in his wooden coffin. “That’s just it, I’m not sure I want to be.”
The words come easily because he believes in her. He doesn’t know all the pieces of herself she keeps buried but he believes in her; her ability to overcome, to conquer. He slides his hand across the railing, palm up in silent offering. When her hands remain clasped around the metal he tries to hide his disappointment. He aches for the connection Tony threw away without thought.
Tony waits for the conclusion to hit.
“Over and over again.” Bucky Barnes is a good man.
“I’m sorry,” Bucky says in a small voice, drawing Steve back to the present. This was supposed to be Bucky’s Christmas gift to him. A shared memory from the past.
They slept in the same bed from then on.
Steve stared down into the cooling coffee like it contained the secrets of universe. "You'd be surprised."
By the end of the dream, Steve is happy.
It’s Tony’s turn to pause. “Coulson.”
His heart will heal. His lungs will empty.
Tony spoke first. “Luke’s guarding the door even though I told him I left the armour behind.” He turned to face Steve. “That for my protection or yours?”
“Happy now?” Tony’s expression shuts down. “I need you present, accounted for, and moderately functional for the shitstorm that’s about to hit because I don’t know if you’ve noticed but I am a fucking mess right now and we can’t both be in pieces at once.”
“The AI won’t answer you. It’s been turned off,” the stranger says candidly.
“Thank you.” The stranger takes his drink and limps into the living room. He slips into the corner seat of the couch and Steve stands opposite, blocking the exits.
She remains stubbornly mute.
“He’s buckling under the strain,” Dr. Tanaka says after another week has passed.
(Tony would lose.
Steve tenses and comes, fascinated and disgusted at once as he watches Stark’s throat convulse as he swallows. The hand in Tony’s hair isn’t gripping anymore, just absentmindedly stroking through strands. Steve doesn’t want to draw attention to it by pulling it back. Besides, of the two actions Steve’s is hardly the more intimate.
Tony closed his eyes and slept.
The sky was always grey these days.
“No, plan’s off. We’re not risking Tony’s life to get him out of a rough heat. He’s not a danger to himself. It’ll last three more days at most.”
“- by which you mean I should be helping - ”
Tony removed a rock and studied it. “Corbicite. Raw vibranium ore. But unless T’Challa really let this place go I’m betting we’re not in Wakanda.”
“Tony.” She plants her hands on her hips at Steve’s surprise. “Out of the suit he’s not much of a challenge.”
“I’m really not.” The holes in Tony’s abdomen only stung when he remembered they were there. “How can I help?”
Something inside of Steve crumbles.
Tony takes the cigarette lighter from his pocket and flicks the flame. It takes the bouquet awhile to catch, the flowers are too stubborn at first - of course Steve bought the fresh ones - but the newsprint they’re wrapped in burns easily and soon the cloying floral scent is covered by the smell of smoke. Tony dumps the torch onto his mother’s gravestone and retreats to watch his marriage dissolve on a stone altar. A burnt offering: ash and flame and cremation. He fancies he can hear the flowers screaming.
Steve wakes up in his own room. The shield waiting for him: dumped on top of his bedspread in its burlap sack, haunting him like an old ghost. In the centre of his own chest is a fading red circular imprint from a repulsor.
“I’m sure I’ll be seeing you around,” Rhodes says with an outstretched hand.
“I’m clearing this with Tanaka and the council tomorrow,” Steve calls out.
Steve realizes he pulled his hands away the moment Tony told him. “I’m not - “
before he figured out the answer. It was so audacious he couldn’t believe it. He wouldn’t have, had he not known it came indirectly from Tony.
Tony hears a rebuke where there isn’t any. “Look Rogers, I don’t care. I like it even,” he adds with a wolfish grin but Steve doesn’t know if he can afford to believe it. “AIM just has shitty timing and got in a lucky shot. Medical won’t miss me.”
“He was gone for five months and you forgot everything you ever knew about him," Bucky accused. "Being bonded for him is different than for us. Bonds are unbalanced and not in his favour. Stark didn’t build an empire by being a sucker, he doesn’t take raw deals.”
The white of the Ether pulsed gloriously white as Tony screamed and the air in his lungs was replaced with water; one more beautiful, empty death in this beautiful, empty Hell they'd made themselves.
He’s out of practice and she takes him to the mat a dozen times. Punching a bag alone isn’t the same as fighting with a partner and she proves it to him over and over again. The Black Widow is an expert in hand-to-hand but it’s still embarrassing. He’s fast and strong but he can’t anticipate her moves like he used to. He’s forgotten and has to relearn.
—————————————
“I broke them. I’m sorry.” It rolls off Steve’s tongue naturally. It doesn’t hurt at all.
As long as those letters remain unopened and Tony takes his time assessing the prosthetic arm then neither has to find out where they stand. They can coast by on stalemate. The idea is anathema to Steve. It seems to be working for them anyway.
Tony’s bleeding from the mouth - he must have injured it on the way down. The blood is a stripe on his bottom lip and it streaks across perfect white teeth, crimson bright. Stark’s favourite colour. It’s the first blood either of them have drawn since Siberia.
Sam still calls him Cap. Steve doesn’t know the words that will make him stop. “I can’t leave.”
Tony had been innocent that time. Or maybe he had been just as guilty as all the other men before him. Steve wasn’t going to let Tony get away with it. Tony had cheated his way out of giving up the key just like he had cheated his way out of the fallout from their Civil War, out of his stunt in San Fransisco, out of the Incursions. Sometimes Steve believed he was merely a projection of Tony’s, like the sun or the moon, and this was Tony’s Hell alone because
In the Ether, in the beginning, there had been a castle and a wound.
Tony stepped out of the car. His spine straightened, his smile returned, the invisible armour assembling around him, piece by piece. Steve envied it. His hands flexed on the steering wheel. The cold that crept in felt deserved.
The roof of the Mansion was deserted. Or it had been when Steve had chosen it.
Tony drew close, his free hand drifting towards the hidden shiv. “I’m sorry, Steve.“
Bucky ignores him. “Thursday, Stevie.”
Steve feels like he’s drowning in three feet of water. He tries to remember every bit of frustration that ever leaked out onto Stark's skin, tries to guess how many bruises he’s laid. They’ve encountered one another once or twice a week for the past two months.
It’s been four days since Steve’s latest mistake. He’s not as immune to them as people want to believe Captain America should be. Bucky just nods slowly like he suspects that whatever truce between the two of them is fragile enough he should let sleeping dogs lie. Steve can’t expect Bucky to understand, not when he doesn’t even understand it himself.
“Way fewer than I have,” Tony interrupted sharply.
So Steve spends Christmas Eve in the North Wing with a box of saltines he stole from the common room. It’s barely enough to be a snack for them these days but it would have constituted a feast once upon a time. Crackers and company. Steve has no other gifts to give.
Tony’s stare is frighteningly even. He’s not wearing socks or shoes.
“At the moment? No.”
Tony just looks at her darkly. “I had better things to do.”
It's frightening, the magnitude of his feeling. He breathes through it and touches Stark like he’s glass. For once Tony seems grateful for the careful attention but he still winces as he steps out of his dress pants.
He’d carried it alone as far as he could.
. Not you.”
Steve doesn’t know how to answer. Frustration is already creeping back, afterglow cut short because nothing is different. Tony is still Stark is still Iron Man and they’re still stuck. The shield on the couch is still damaged. Tony must have known this wouldn’t help them. Maybe he just went along with it to prove that point to Steve.
Tony nods to himself and rolls his shoulder back. “Not here.”
“Keep moving,” Steve said whenever he sensed Tony slowing, never letting him stop and peer too closely lest he slip into a final resting place.
” Bucky concentrates very carefully on the basketball and not on Steve’s face. “Please don’t.”
There was a phantom sting from the puncture wounds. “Someone should.”
The swamp arose out of the barren flats like a stinking oasis, the stench permeating the stagnant air only when they were nearly upon it. The surface was opaque and gave the impression of being nearly solid due to the decaying layers of floating peat. Thin browning grasses that may have once been reeds were petrified at the edges in clusters. It extended as far as the eye could see.
Tony tilted his head slightly to the side and Steve saw through the layer of makeup to the tired blue underneath his eyes. The illusion of perfection slipping away. “You don’t remember how we were rescued do you?”
“That’s control!” Steve can’t resist stabbing a slice of french toast and dragging it onto his plate. “You always give more than your share because you want something back. It’s the reason you’re buying me eggs and french toast now. It’s why you gave the Avengers everything - ”
“But you can,” Steve accuses and he can see Stark falter.
The Avengers’ most sophisticated lead on HYDRA is the work of one Dr. Carl Relsen and the doctors in the North Wing haven’t been able to hide their interest well enough. They think Relsen’s work will help fade the last of the control triggers and bring Bucky out of his plateau. They Avengers have tracked the splinter group to Antwerp but there’s a problem: the Belgians absolutely refuse to allow any subset of the team to cross their border. Their reasoning basically amounts to
The further they went on the more Tony fell behind. He felt sick and hot. There was a buzzing in his ears as if invisible gnats had made a home in skull. His vision fuzzed around the edges. There was death on either side as he stumbled after Steve who led him like a will-o’-the-wisp further and further into the maze until finally they stopped. Tony fell to his knees and vomited, crawling forward on all fours to where Steve was leaning over an old stone well. The tableau reminded Tony of something he’d seen before, somewhere.
Tony’s lips twist. “Well someone keep giving me speeches about being
Nothing changes.
One night Tony kissed him across the divide, mouth soft but resolute and it had taken everything in Steve to retreat slowly instead of flinching back.
“I don’t remember.”
Tony sputtered. “You don’t believe me?”
“You did.” Tony still looks skeptical. “In Berlin.”
Stark is a wreck; wheezing and pale. Steve can’t look much better.
No one was fast enough to stop Peter running across the veil after them.
Tonight Vision is back which means Steve has the pleasure of eating over-seasoned and under-baked lasagna from a paper plate in the kitchen while Jim and Tony have a blowout fight in the dining room. They’re loud behind the closed doors. Vision seems utterly unperturbed but Steve’s sensitive hearing goes to war with his good judgement when it comes to how much he listens in.
Rhodey’s expression hardens.
Tony shakes his head.
“Fine.” Stark scowls as he stares down the hall at something that isn’t there. “We always have to have things your way.”
Every morning it hurts less and less.
There's a reason Steve is hyper-sensitive to his name when Tony says it and he's thankful for it now, but the rest of his auditory recall logs the rushing white noise of combat and nothing else. He tries to shrug, feeling every ounce of the weight on his shoulders resist. “It was a lot to take in at once.” He tries to make it sound normal, like a mistake anyone was bound to make.
Steve looked at him. “I’m sorry for tackling you, just - " he drew a quick breath before whispering, “...please don’t leave me behind.”
Tony laughs and it’s melodious. "You say that like you haven't seen me do much worse."
Instead Tony had reached for the nearest socket wrench and tore through him with four words.
Steve didn’t point out the obviousness of what had changed.
He doesn’t know what Natasha does but Stark up and solves any of Steve’s lingering doubts by leaving for California on an extended Christmas vacation. Part of him had hoped that Bucky would relax once Tony wasn't in the same building but it’s December 14th and Natasha’s prediction of Bucky’s worsening slide has come to pass.
“So what happens now?”
The bar is nearly empty when they arrive and even emptier by the time they leave. The scene that greets Steve when they return is comfortable and intimate. Pepper’s curled up on the couch asleep, her jacket tucked under her head, red hair streaming, her feet nestled in Tony’s lap while he taps on a tablet. It’s a gentle reminder of things he and Tony never had.
Steve approaches him slowly like Tony's a wounded animal. He takes the BARF glasses from Stark’s hand and instead of breaking them for Tony’s own good, he folds them neatly and places them on the vanity. “Sam’s his own man. He can decide on the Accords himself.”
“Steve,” Tony rasped. His lip was red where he’d bit it and there was a smattering of deep angry scratches around his mark, some of them still bleeding sluggishly. Heats weren’t painful in and of themselves but someone could hurt themselves trying to fight one.
The bouquet mocks him as he lets Steve take him apart and put him back together as faulty as when he started. Tony’s chest aches and it’s nothing to do with the passenger he carries with him.
“You changed.”
Steve looks back, fight momentarily forgotten. He spots Tony slumped in the opposite corner of the mat, arms crossed protectively over his chest where Steve had shoved him. His brown eyes are wide and wild.
Tony is opening his own belt one-handedly with impressive dexterity but Steve can’t wait. The few experiences he’s had with men were in places and times where speed was a necessity. He knocks Tony’s hand out of the way and undoes the man’s trousers himself before shoving his own sweatpants and boxers down around his thighs. He lines their lengths up as best he can and strokes.
Steve walked on ahead along the spine, his voice floating downwards. “Because they’re not trenches.”
Steve nodded slowly. “Okay, Tony. Okay.”
It shouldn’t be Stark.
“Find anything that jogged your memory?” Steve asked, gingerly setting himself down.
Tony’s head shot up and standing on the other side of the river was Steve glaring at him in full Captain America regalia.
Tony’s mouth twitched at the waste. He would always be greedy for whatever Steve Rogers would give him. He’d long since resigned himself to a life spent at the beck and call of that particular addiction. He was achingly hard in his undersuit but the prospect of jerking off with a sprained wrist was as unpleasant as it was inevitable. He pressed against his clothed erection before Steve was yanking Tony’s hand away and replacing it with his own.
Steve can’t help but laugh at his own inadequacy and Bucky just seems to smile brighter.
“Hypothetically, if I asked someone to repair the shield, could they?”
“You’re manipulative as all hell and you don’t even see it, do you?”
“He smells different, you notice that? Makes me want to hit something. I don’t know how Logan stands it. How have you not… ”
Tony taps his glass of lemonade on the table and hesitates. “They weren’t those kinds of meetings, Cap.”
He dumped the box of donuts into Tony’s lap the next morning before sliding into the driver’s seat. Tony handed him a large coffee. Neither of them apologized.
He grabs the sketchbook and wanders the halls until he finds himself in front of the guest room at the top of Tony’s workshop. He pushes open the door and finds Tony slumped inelegantly at the foot of the bed. Steve’s gaze immediately searches for the liquor bottle but it’s much worse than that. Tony’s staring off into space wearing the black BARF frames, fingers rubbing worriedly at his temple. He opens a pill bottle one-handedly and dry swallows two small white capsules.
Steve wants to know when Tony started experimenting on himself. When he decided to double down on the machine over the man to make up for the flaws he sees in his own humanity. How long he's been this in disguise: a man who cannot afford to trust and so made himself into someone who never had to.
“FRIDAY was worried when you didn’t come back for breakfast.”
“What Tony needs is not to be trapped in a strange motel room with either you or me while going through a maladaptive heat cycle. He needs to be at home and not on a road trip with the spitting image of the man who violated him. He needs some version of talk therapy and maybe mood stabilizers before he starts self-medicating the only way he knows how and we have an old familiar problem on our hands. I’ve given him my professional recommendations and instead he’s here. With you.”
“You smell good.”
It’s then that Steve realizes Vision doesn’t know what to do either.
They’re not talking about the Maldecian president anymore. Stark plants his silhouette directly in Steve’s sightline. “Which one is it, Rogers? You seem to think I control what entire countries do but in my spare time I’ve taken to licking the boots of whatever government official I can find. Puppetmaster or patsy, you can’t have it both ways.”
Behind him there’s the sound of shattering crystal. He doesn’t look back.
Steve stared up at the grey ceiling and remembered a hell of their own making. He loaded the single word with contempt as he pushed it through his teeth, aimed like a weapon:
“You don’t like that you kill me, or you like it just fine and you don’t like what it says about you?” Tony asked like he already knew Steve’s answer. “Because if it’s the latter I give you permission. Kill me in your dreams as often as you like. Go on a spree.”
“Moses,” Steve murmured abruptly.
“You're remembering?” Steve looked hopeful and distressed at once.
Later Steve would watch the exchange on loop:
Steve just shrugs because
Steve couldn’t argue with that but he hated the helplessness. “Shouldn’t you be in there in case something goes wrong?”
“You’re talking to her again.”
It’s over.
The bands around his lungs contract, waiting, but Bucky just gives him a fragile smile and bumps Steve’s shoulder with his. “You’re just upset I won. You’re getting rusty, punk.”
Tony raised an eyebrow. “It’s your name. Thinking of changing it?”
“The arm,” Steve repeats tonelessly. He remembers cornering Tony so many months ago, demanding he stretch himself further.
“You’re going to have to. You aren’t leaving this room until then.” Steve crosses his arms. “I have all night.”
“You have no idea what I’m capable of.”
Stark pinches the bridge of his nose once he realizes Steve’s strategically planted himself between him and the exit. “What do you want? Make it snappy.”
and you’ll toss me into the fire yourself.” The words came out unbothered but Steve still flinched.
“I didn’t lie to you before,” Tony had said while waiting in a drive-thru, “I kept my sobriety. The Captain never gave me alcohol. Water-only. So he did me a favour I guess.”
He doesn’t tell Steve because Steve is old-fashioned enough to believe the stories and there are only two ways it goes: either he’ll demand to know who it is that Tony loves so much and so fiercely he will die for them. He won’t believe it when Tony says there’s no one else. That it’s Steve. It’s always Steve. Or his husband - the man who kisses him goodbye, who makes the best pancakes, who holds him close - doesn’t love him anymore.
Tony bucks his hips again, deliberately this time, and Steve bites his lip at the pressure. Tony’s expression is vicious. “So have you been fighting me all this time out of some repressed urge to fuck me, or should I be glad we're having regular sex because otherwise you’d have killed me by now?”
“I said no,” Steve growled and pushed every frustration from the past week, the past month, into the word. It was an alpha’s order and blatant intimidation and even the Sorcerer Supreme took a placating step back.
“You got what you wanted. You refused to release BARF so you got Bucky under your thumb. You got Wanda exiled for disobeying you. Natasha hates her job and is being eaten alive. Clint and Scott won’t risk coming home. You’ve got the Avengers and the Accords and the world on you side. It’s your future, we just have to live in it.”
That was thirteen hours ago. Night’s fallen and Steve’s been locked out of the active floors. Instead he’s studying the holographic globe in the empty situation room. It’s the map Stark and the agents consult religiously every time the Avengers are called. It’s a soft blue orb with political divisions marked out. A bright band of cyan marks Accord signatory countries as it runs across North America and Europe, dotted through South East Asia and South America. It’s a stark visual reminder of how many people think Steve is wrong.
“Iron Man,” Steve orders and after months of disuse it feels awkward on his tongue, “you - “
For a man who can't get sick in the world's most accommodating prison, Steve gets asked that question a lot. “I’m alright.”
The blooms don’t stop. The first petal is joined by a second, a fifth, a forty-sixth: a rainbow of shapes and colours and sizes. His chest aches every time. The coughing accelerates. He hacks up showers of limp, spittle-covered flora; stuffing them quickly into pockets, burying them in garbage cans. He has an alcoholic’s gift for careful deception and not one escapes his eagle eye. Steve remains loving and none the wiser and ever-growingly absent. Tony used to dread the time alone but now he counts the days, desperate for the long windows of solitude when he doesn’t have to hold his breath and pretend the truth isn’t a living thing in his chest.
Her beautiful eyes glimmer. Tony believes her.
“I hate the Patriots - ‘specially Brady.”
Tony knew what that was like now. Steve had shown him. Over and over and over -
“I meant the armour. Explain it to me.”
Natasha comes back with the jet, alone and a little worse for wear. She gives Steve a slight nod but marches straight down to Tony’s workshop. The metal doors slide open and poised at the threshold, she hesitates (and the Black Widow never hesitates) before she disappears inside. Steve never learns more and neither deign to tell him.
Today Tony had insisted Steve take a walk with him under the fake sun as if it weren’t just as artificial as the plot Steve had dug. There was still dirt under his fingernails. Tony was walking the top of the parapet in bare feet, balanced like a gymnast between the crenollations. Steve wondered if Tony was self-aware enough to notice his own mental state unraveling or if he was too preoccupied with Steve’s to notice.
Tony had been missing for five months before Bucky and Logan brought him back.
Tony laughs, unobstructed and free.
The fledgling sinister blooms that will grow to consume his every moment are indistinguishable in the beginning from everyday aches and pains. His chest seizes at odd intervals and for the wrong reasons. He wakes abruptly, gasping for air, and can’t quite remember the nightmare that propelled him there. There’s a thickness at the back of his throat; easily ignored but never absent. The ghosting scent of spring permeates the bedroom.
“Of course, Mr. Stark,” she beams back. She scribbles down the order and flips the Closed sign on the front door before running to tell the cook who’s just shown up.
“This your version of the shovel talk? What are your intentions with my best pal?”
In addition, it turns out I can't write love declarations, apologies, or fight scenes, so I've skipped all of that. Many other stories cover that ground better than I ever could. (I hardly know people in real life who are emotionally erudite, I can't bring myself to write characters that way.)
“Well then, I guess he’s completely forgotten about it,” Bucky says dead-eyed from where he’s just thrown up in the garbage can. Steve allows himself a bit of relief that the sarcasm means Bucky hasn’t retreated into a silent shell of himself.
Bucky called him occasionally. Never to talk. The one time Steve called him back, Natasha answered.
It takes Steve a moment to follow the threads. “About his parents.”
“He doesn’t want them.”
“Dammit, Tony. You didn’t have to do that, there’s a rowboat tied up a mile upstream.”
followed by
, no one had been more surprised than Steve. Not even Tony, who hadn’t remembered any of it.
Logan tapped his nose. “I ain’t ordinary.”
. The Accords back Belgium; the Avengers can’t prove the HYDRA splinter is planning an international attack, nor can they justify three flying tanks and a nigh-invulnerable android when Belgian special forces will do. The council won’t risk pissing off most of Western Europe by overriding the decision. The Avengers have already passed on the relevant surveillance information, their part is over.
Kovalchyk’s frail hand encircles Steve’s wrist where he’s grabbed him. “To my knowledge no one is currently in any danger beyond the routine dodging of insane megalomaniacs. I’d tell someone if I suspected that had changed. Are you alright, Captain Rogers?”
Steve steers them back toward more solid ground. “Zemo’s a psychopath.”
, and if you think you’re any higher on his list of priorities you’re even more gullible than me.”
Tony confesses.
She doesn’t answer.
Tony looks up at him from below dark lashes, a smirk on his face. His fingers tease the waistband at Steve’s hips. “Tell me what you want, Dealer's choice.”
“Don’t come tomorrow," Bucky says and every muscle in Steve’s body tenses. “Just… I need a few days. Thursday, maybe.”
The fact that he manages to get both of them off is a credit to his determination more than his skill but for a solitary moment after orgasm Tony looks a little less like a force of nature and a little more human. It doesn’t feel like a victory. Steve’s skin feels dirty and too tight, covered in grimy sweat from the silt on the floor. He offers Stark a hand up but instead Tony drags himself to sit with his back to the wall; exhausted.
Steve’s already committed. “Listen, if people have to know about… us... for you to get help then I don’t care.”
Someone’s yelling. Someone’s been yelling this whole time.
He doesn’t need an interpreter, he knows what message they are meant to convey:
One hundred and eight days and counting.
Steve stared at his own hands gripping the steering wheel at ten-and-two and resisted the urge to hide them. There was no way to win. He wasn’t the one playing.
Sam looks as surprised as Steve was when he’d worked it out. “That… can’t be easy to hear.”
“You owe me a shirt, Rogers,” Tony’s hand relinquishes its grip as he slumps to the floor in a heap, “and a fucking
Steve meets Tony's eyes and desperately searches for truth in their depths. He tries to find some sign that he can risk Bucky's life on Tony's word. He doesn't know if he'd recognize it if he found it.
The dreams start up again.
trust you but if Kovalchyk’s above board there’s no reason for Stark to hide him.”
Steve let go.
Steve climbed into the bed and Tony followed, both of them fully clothed, under the sheets. It was a mercy, this peace, however temporary it proved to be. It was the long middle of the cycle before the wheel turned and they became their worst selves: succumbing once more to love and violence and treachery.
Tony rasped, the vibrations echoing through Steve’s fingers.
Tony walks to the edge of the porch to stare suspiciously up at the clouded sky. “We’re going to need them all for what’s coming. And more.”
For a moment Steve just watches, intrigued. Then his eye catches the cyan numbers flashing on the digital clock: 3:24 am. No one’s supposed to be up here. Steve’s not supposed to be up here.
Here time flowed like water. It was a ticking metronome in the back of Steve’s mind and the constant drip lent itself to a different kind of madness. He wouldn’t suffer it. He kept irregular days: thirty-two hours, then twenty-nine, then thirty-four. The sun rose and fell and Steve didn’t notice. Keeping the days had been Tony’s job.
It was a relief in a way. Bucky needed someone and Steve couldn’t be that person. Not right now. It was healthy and good and deserved.
The AI bypasses him completely.
He breathes in and feels the cloud of lust receding. When he raises his head Tony’s studying him with guarded eyes but Steve’s gaze is drawn magnetically to the remains of scar tissue marring his chest.
The phantom sensation of burning retreated to a tingle under Steve’s skin. He looked down at his chest and instead of a Cursed wound there was only a pink line held together with staples.
“The Avengers can’t afford for you to be you right now.” There’s no way Natasha misses the way Tony suppresses a flinch. “We need you here, sober, and not in Boston blowing up tombstones.”
The shield is still damaged but it’s no longer bloody.
There was a pause.
———————————
There was a frosted layer of white on everything before one of them spoke again.
Something twists in Steve’s gut. “You really hate him that much?”
“If I take you back, you’ll die.” The cursed wound in Steve’s breast would kill him as soon as they stepped through.
Steve sucked in a breath. “So you’ve been lying to me.”
The hologram resets and plays out again except this time Steve gets front row seats to the pained expression on his mother’s face when her son and his friend can’t hide their disappointment when she brings home nothing more than salted licorice as a treat for after dinner.
“What are they?”
There was a sharp intake of breath but Steve barrelled on. “Their Steve wasn’t dead. If I was dead over there I would have been able to cross the veil.” Bucky didn’t correct him no matter how much Steve willed it. “That’s why you hit me. It was me, in the other world. I hurt Tony.”
. Get in the car, we’re going back.”
“Because it wasn’t your fault and Tony will eventually see that. You didn’t owe him anything, you weren’t friends.”
Steve tucks the blank envelopes next to his heart. One for each of the deaths that left Tony an orphan at seventeen. Howard and Maria are dead ends; left to linger in the written words of their killer and the complicated brilliance of their son.
. We broke the Avengers and it only happened because the bad guy knew exactly how much of coward I was.”
Of course it’s Sam. He’s worked with Rhodes, Nat and Vision before. He fits the Avengers’ new fly high, fly fast motto. Steve couldn’t have chosen better himself.
—————————————
Steve smiles again and this time it doesn’t feel strange at all.
“Yes?” Steve tore his eyes away, the saturated colours imprinted onto his retinas. “What is it, Jen?”
Strange didn’t back down. “I don’t know.”
Somewhere on the other side, Peter Parker had died.
He supposes he should be grateful that Stark has banked his misplaced hate enough to allow Bucky breathing room but he can’t help but see Stark’s total abdication from the Winter Soldier’s reformation as a cheap dodge. Steve doesn’t know what he expected except more. Tony is extreme in the things he cares for - this caution is out of character and the longer it last, the less Steve believes in it. He wavers between knowing it’s easier on both of them if Bucky stays out of Stark’s line of fire, and the uneasy feeling that accompanies never knowing if Bucky could be doing better with Tony's help.
Eventually Tony drops his head into his hands. “Goddammit.” He pulls on his clothes and leaves without another word.
Steve repeats like he would know the truth from a lie.
————————————
“Give them FRIDAY’s scan of your ribs."
“What?“
“I only had the two parents. He kill anyone else I know?” Sober that remark would sting but Tony’s drinking so it rolls off his tongue without barbs.
“The newspapers?” he guesses. “That’s what’s really bothering you right? The part that affects you.” Natasha doesn’t react and Stark just shrugs. “They’ll get bored.
“Tony…”
Stark’s loud protests and gasping breaths are just background noise, processed somewhere else because the forefront of Steve’s brain is preoccupied with finding what truth Stark is hiding this time. The athletic wear of the undersuit is slippery and layered and Steve doesn’t take his time, just rips it open because goddamn it he’s right and -
“I prefer the term experienced.”
Tony twists his lips in derision, makes himself ugly. “I assume you heard.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers.
“I really don’t know. I’ve yet to meet a man who could claim to know what goes on in Tony Stark’s mind.” Stephen looked at him keenly. “Are you alright?”
Steve nods. He’s not entitled to this. “Might be good for her anyway,” he offers with a half-smile, “gives the old girl character. Scars.”
Tony lived. No one tried to convince him to go back.
Stark sinks to his knees with intent and all the air in Steve’s lungs rushes out. He can’t seem to get them to inflate again. He stays cornered against the desk, his escape forgotten in concession to more dire emergencies. Below, Stark’s clever fingers undo the button and zipper before him and Steve’s fists grip wood like a lifeline as he fights for control of his choppy, uneven breathing. The buzzing feeling rising in his stomach is mostly lust and only slightly apprehension because if Steve does this - if he lets this happen - then he can’t pretend what happened before was a one-off mistake.
“It’s not working. Why did you think I was so late getting here?”
From the parapet of stone Steve had looked out over their empty kingdom. The meadows of brilliant green rippled in the non-existent breeze. The sky was an unnatural crystal blue the exact shade of Steve’s uniform and the sun was nothing more than a topaz gemstone hung at high noon. The moon, when Tony remembered to call down the night, was a translucent pearl on dark navy velvet. Steve took no credit for the landscape, Tony was in charge these days. They could not sleep in the Ether, they could not dream. They could only create and so Tony had built them a home: this castle, this meadow, this sky.
The other edge of the mat is a flurry of activity.
Tony’s brow wrinkles in confusion before he hits upon the memory. He snorts, as if it wasn’t important at all - a tidbit thrown in the heat of the moment. “I was six, Rogers, I will not be held accountable for my questionable taste in childhood idols.”
There’s nothing wrong with Bucky sharing with Tony. It’s what Tony could tell Bucky that causes anxiety to well in the pit of Steve’s stomach.
If Captain America said it was Right who would oppose him?
In which sets of keys dictate the fate of the world.
He throws an arm over Bucky's shoulder and tucks himself closer. It reminds him of years ago in Sarah Rogers’s old drafty house when Bucky used to do the same for him when Steve was the one who was sick. It’s not a pleasant memory but it is an important one. Steve was a born fighter but everything he ever learned about caring is owed to one James Buchanan Barnes. There is nothing Steve can do to pay him back for those nights where Bucky did nothing more than believe Steve would wake the next morning. He wonders if Bucky always felt this helpless.
“You could - ” Tony stopped to fortify himself. “I’d be okay with it, if you still wanted to.” He didn’t strip down like Steve feared, instead he tilted his head slightly to the right, exposing the bloody column of his throat like he’d let Steve bite -
“I don’t know,” Steve finally admits. It’s a tangled mess of both. “I didn’t like seeing you hurt.”
“Stay on top,” Steve warned just as Tony jumped down.
Steve walked out.
He’s vaguely aware of Natasha stepping up to cover for him.
Christmas. Alone. “No - God, no. Tony’s got people. You don’t need to feel bad - You don’t need to worry about Stark. He can take care of himself.” Mostly, except for the mounting evidence that he can’t.
“I did. The others didn’t. Most died knowing exactly who to blame.” Tony’s gaze was glassy, fixed at a middle distance. “The only thing I ever did that hurt him was talk about Barnes. So I exaggerated, I lied. I made us best friends and lovers over your dead body. I knew just enough about Bucky to make it plausible.“ Tony’s breath was a slow rattle. “My punishment was watching. He found other-Tony’s apprentice and gave him a martyr’s death. I’m not religious, I never realized how long it took.”
Tony’s lips quirked. “You are severely underestimating how much the Captain hated his Stark. Take the worst feelings you’ve ever had towards me and multiply that by about a dozen bodies.”
———————————
His feet carry him off the beaten path and into the world. His last promise broken. He hopes Bucky forgives him.
“Is that why you're avoiding me?”
“Call me Francesca. Since I’m no longer practicing and Georgie’s stolen your shoe, Dr. Blancard may be bit formal.”
The stranger smiles and there’s something placating in it that sets Steve’s teeth on edge. “I meant, may I have my tea?”
Also, it’s Sam.
He was blindsided on Tuesday.
Rhodes has the qualifications, the experience. He signed the Accords from the off. “I’d have thought he’d be the ideal candidate.”
“No,” Steve kept his voice deliberately calm, “you’re going into heat.”
Rhodey exhales rapidly and Tony marvels at the ease. He slides sheets of medical proxy legalese across the table. He trusts Steve to do right by him but not in this final request.
. Stark never wanted to be bonded to
It shouldn’t be Tony but goddamn it if Steve won’t finish the job. He’s nowhere near as experienced as Stark so he just jerks Tony off, scraping his own fluids off Stark’s abdomen to use as lubrication. Tony lets his head fall backward against the wall and finally stops talking but the sharp breaths he takes are still too loud for Steve’s comfort. He knows it’s not the forties but anything not furtive and quick still seems decadent and inefficient. It’s not Stark’s fault he grew up in different time but it’s yet another incompatibility. When Steve did this last it was with -
Afterward Tony had rounded on him. “If I wanted his arm broken, I’d have done it myself.”
Benching Tony only hastened the spiral. It was like Iron Man was the only thing keeping him in check. It devolved: bars, tabloid headlines, parties. Steve held his breath, waiting for the self-destruction to take something irreparable but Tony balanced everything precisely on a knife’s edge. The nights he didn’t come back to the Mansion were cause for concern. The nights he did were worse.
“I won’t stop trying," he says stubbornly. "I won’t give up on him. Arm or not. With or without you.”
The anger that lies dormant in Steve’s belly surges as if Tony lying about his health was somehow a virgin offense. “You’re injured.”
The survivors were huddled under blankets as onlookers pointed and cried. They couldn’t see what Steve saw. The focal point glowing orange against the stunning landscape: the cerulean sea set behind, the manicured green lawn, the magenta of twilight, the raining fire, the absolute destruction. On the way into SHIELD custody, Sin looked back and smiled. She saw it too.
“So what do we do?” Steve asked.

grateful to be alive. He was grateful for the pain, for the cold, for Sam and Sharon who he never thought he’d see again. He was grateful Tony left him behind to save them both and so Steve could burn for his sins. He was grateful Tony was standing here in front of him so Steve could finally, finally stop killing him.
Bucky shifts abruptly, body lifting, and Steve takes the proffered hand.
———————————
The champagne has made Tony brave.
“We’ve already done I’ll show you mine if you show me yours,” Tony says but he steps aside and lets Steve enter. Every surface of the workshop is covered with contraptions and marvels built by Tony’s own two hands.
Her name is Dr. Francesca Blancard. She’s a Professor Emeritus at Pennsylvania State and did a bunch of pioneering work in veteran reintegration and the lack thereof after the Vietnam war. More to the point, she’s lovely. Seventy-two and spry, gardening away in her retirement and widowhood in a small cottage just north of Martha’s vineyard.
Tony trembled. “If it’s not this, it’ll be something else.”
“I’m not at liberty to say.”
Steve tried to ignore the way Tony held himself for the rest of the drive, curled imperceptibly away. They turned in early and Tony wandered out to the local pharmacy. Later Steve heard knees hit tile and the choking sounds of bile being evacuated from an empty stomach. There was a near empty blister pack of suppressants on the floor but Tony clearly couldn’t keep them down. It was too late.
“…anything. It wasn’t helping.”
Some of the graves had been dug deep, some shallow, some half-covered with earth. Any bones they saw had been picked white by desiccation and were all jumbled up like puzzle pieces fresh out of the box. Too many skulls were mixed in with too few spines. One grave held only ribcages with broken sternums where an arc reactor would have fit. Another had whole skeletons with their heads turned completely backwards, the empty chain of Agamotto still resting around their twisted necks. One ditch was perfectly orderly: row upon row of femurs stacked nearly to the brim with a crowning border of skulls resting atop, rising out to critique their interlopers like Waldorf and Statler at the opera.
Still, Steve breathes easier Friday mornings knowing that Rhodes was here the night before. He’s pretty sure it’s the only thing holding Stark together so Steve always errs on the side of good manners and gives them space.
Steve wasn’t breathing. He was sure if he could he would scream.
Steve waits for the shimmer to fade, his voice is cracked. “You fix things Tony, but people aren’t things.”
at this point.
“Really?” Tony hisses in a low voice. “You invited me here for couple’s counselling? Is there something about me that screams
“I can stop you. I won’t.” Steve was tired of being the immovable object. “It’s your choice.”
“No!” MODOK screamed.
“No -”
“I thought you said you didn’t believe in Hell.”
“The Compound should have a garden.” Steve watches the plants recover from the downpour, resilient.
“Excellent,” Francesca says briskly, standing. “I could use some help right now.”
Tony comes with his eyes closed, breath stuttering. Steve studies his face. There should be revelation. Instead he learns nothing.
“Listen, I know Tony deserved better. I’m not that callous. I know he deserved a chance to make up with his parents. I know he deserves memories of them that aren’t tainted by how they died.” Steve’s not sure why his own words hurt to hear. “The world owed him more than that.”
Tony had been right, getting the body out had been terribly difficult. Steve had paced like a lioness waiting for the retrieved corpse to wake to the new world in perfect innocence. Except in this version Sleeping Beauty awoke to a Beast instead of a prince.
She must have read it in his face. “Stark.”
The next day Tony was interviewed on Seattle morning TV. He pledged the funds to rebuild the church in Virginia and thanked the Avengers for arriving in time to stop further damage. He mentioned Carol and Jennifer by name. He didn’t mention Steve at all. The interview lasted eight minutes and fourteen seconds. Steve knew because he’d watched it over and over again on mute so he wouldn’t be distracted by seductive words. He’d searched Tony’s face for evidence. He wanted confirmation that Tony’s sins had crossed with him from the Ether into this world too.
Tony’s hands skittered around the edge of the well as another wave of dizziness took him. His skin felt too hot and his tongue felt like cotton. He collapsed and slammed his shoulder into the stone. He couldn’t have told you which way was up.
He threw it back into the river with a splash. He tried not to thing about hells.
“We know that, they don’t.”
It doesn’t help that they both know that Steve’s always the one who instigates. He reaches out and escalates the verbal to physical. It's a weakness he can't stop indulging. He wonders if Stark does it on purpose: dangling himself and his accomplishments in front of Steve like a matador.
Steve knows he should stop here but he doesn’t. “From public information only - guest list, known associates - just give me your best guess.”
He means the words to be a comfort but they hit like a blow. Tony shakes his head, agitated again. “What makes this time different, Rogers? Don’t say house arrest. Nothing’s changed.”
Tony shoots him a dark look like he knows exactly what Steve’s thinking. “Oh, we’re well past the point where you screw me, Rogers. We’re now at the part where you leave me with your shield and run off to bury your head in the sand for 3 months. Except I get to keep Barnes in the divorce this time. I’ll ask him if he’s up for another round of cryo - ”
The cold found every crack in Steve’s armour. The line of his wrist between glove and coat; the tips of his ears; his cheeks where tears dried slowly, taking heat and sorrows with them.
Tony’s charm flips like a switch and he gives her his most dazzling smile. “Hello there, we’ll take a spinach omelette, the French toast, and a BLT. We could use some privacy too if you could swing it.”
“I know, Steve, but
Steve thinks that maybe the serum fixed something in him that shouldn’t have been fixed. He has nightmares about the cold, but never about the war itself. The echoing artillery shells, the gunfire, the stench of bodies are just the backdrop to his memories. They don’t live in his head the way Bucky falling does - and
The awful truths he learns about Stark are second only to those he learns about himself. It feels like everything good in him is becoming corrupted. When Tony’s snide remarks hit too far below the belt he can’t stop himself from asking
There’s a hesitation in Tony’s shoulders before he shrugs which Steve knows that means Tony’s allowed himself to hope. “Natasha’s clearly already in contact with Clint.”
His mind tried to avoid the reality that now imposed itself. Tony was different but he wasn’t
“I never said that.”
———————————————
“Really?”
That’s when he saw the bite: the blush pink of a bondmark at the crux of neck and shoulder, years old. Tony’s throat had been bare when he left.
He waited for the fly to revive but it never did. He went hungry.
“It’s the only thing I know works.” Tony exhales and his breath crystallizes in the cold night air. “It slows everything down, calms my brain, warms me up. Not the healthiest coping method in the world but I’ve literally invented worse.”
Tony. Of course it's Tony.
“Stark.” Steve’s jaw clamped shut. So that was how it was. “Answer the question.”
, strong and pissed off.
Reed said “In theory,” at the same time as Stephen said “Yes.”
Nothing is special about the day Steve walks away. The idea doesn’t hit him like a thunderclap, it just creeps up on him during his morning run: you don’t have to go back. It’s true: Steve isn’t vital to any part of the Avengers machine anymore. No one’s asking his opinions, no one’s waiting on his shield. Only a handful of people will acknowledge his existence today and none of them will call him Steve. Another twelve hours of
“I think I’ll see that for myself.”
“Tony?”
“Have you heard from anyone else?” Steve asks, trying not to betray how desperately he wants the Avengers complete.
Steve hasn’t called him by his last name in months. Tony’s eyes narrow and he drops the act pretty damn quick. “Of course you can, Rogers. I bought you.”
Outside, the rain’s stopped. They leave the porch and the dark soil is absorbent and alive under Steve’s feet. The air is heavy and damp and clean. It tastes sweet, cleansed.
“We expect continued deterioration until the 16th, that’s the anniversary. Knowing Tony Stark’s in the building can’t help, but it is what it is…”
“Who?”
Steve says miserably.
—————————————
Tony started taking scent blockers again and Steve was remiss to admit he missed the scent of saltwater. They were laying in bed, Tony asleep and tucked across Steve’s front. The bondmark on his throat shone accusingly. It made Steve feel like a homewrecker but with Tony pressed close even the reminder couldn’t faze him. It was a part of himself Tony would never allow Steve to intrude on and Steve needed to make his peace with it. He pressed his lips chaste as he could just below the scar tissue that was as good as a wedding ring.
Steve can only answer truthfully. “They’re the best we can do.”
Tony halts and grinds his teeth. Steve can hear it from here. “Fan-fucking-tastic,” he mutters as he finally comes to a stop in front of Steve, nearly chest-to-chest as if their height differential means nothing.
is clearly no longer in her vocabulary.
“For fuck’s sake,” Stark's voice has the quiet flatness that covers simmering rage, “I didn’t invite a HYDRA agent into my living room. Let’s pretend you respect me enough to believe I’d check,” his lips draw into a thin line, “or did you think I’d do it on purpose?”
“I don’t remember following that rule even when you had the ability to enforce it. Besides, mission’s over Spangles.”
That’s all the warning Steve gets before Stark socks him. A sucker punch to the left side of his unguarded torso. It hurts.
Steve wants to live in a universe where he can be happy and good at the same time. He wants people to have the same faith in him that he does in them. “I want things to go back to the way they were.”
signed them.” Steve's finger hovers accusingly above Tony’s chest. They tore themselves apart over those papers and now Stark’s treating them as an a la carte menu. “You fought for this. You wanted to choose which bits to follow you picked the wrong side.”
“He hurt anyone?”
“What do you remember?” Steve had asked warily. This cycle had gone fast. Tony was unpredictable like that.
.” Tony grimaces. “Back then I was pretty sure affection was a conserved quantity. I thought if you never existed then maybe he'd have liked me better. I hated you because you were dead and it still wasn't enough.”
“I look forward to it,” Steve says and even he’s puzzled by how even it sounds.
Tony looks back and Steve stands tall. He has faced much worse odds.
Under his palm Steve can feel Tony panic, breath shallow and stuttering as Steve looms over him. Instead of guilty it makes him feel powerful. His forearm is resting across Tony’s artificial sternum with heavy pressure and for a few pounds per square inch more he could snap it as easily as if it were bone.
Steve rescues a potted hydrangea from drowning and tries not to feel Tony’s eyes on him.
“Just after.”
Then he shuts the door with a quiet click.
“He’s -” Steve has to look away so Tony won't see the secret in his eyes, "he’s my friend."
“I’m not. I kind of have a soft spot for the guy since he risked his life to rescue me and all.”
Sometimes Sam’s there panting to keep up. Sometimes Steve catches the red flash of Natasha’s hair disappearing around a corner. Sometimes he just
Tonight Natasha is.
“Stark’ll do it.” It’s the only answer Steve can think of off the top of his head. “He’s good at it.”
Steve’s heart leaps in his throat. “Tony?”
It’s easy after that to fall into old patterns, worn over but not forgotten. They migrate to the kitchen and miracle of miracles no one follows them.
“Off,” Steve grunted eventually and when Tony didn’t move fast enough he was wrenched out of the way as Steve came silently, stroking himself. He made no sound as spurt after spurt of his seed soaked into the saturated ground.
Strange’s eyes narrowed and Steve bristled. He felt his grip on himself loosen against his will. He loomed over the sorcerer, voice harsh. “Where’s Tony?”
Steve steps closer and the gold undersuit crawls up the vee of Tony’s throat as a protective measure or a warning or both.
Steve takes several long, angry gulps of whisky to prevent himself from retorting. In contrast Tony draws himself inward, wrapping his jacket to ward off the chill.
“Did the council at least send you somewhere with a beach?” Steve asks with a small smile when he finally catches her walking off the jet and into the hangar.
“You could go back you know.” The words were ash in his mouth.
There’s a familiar flare of self-righteous anger.
“No. Fury’s a real bastard when he wants to be.”
” The curse was the barest whisper, like Tony hoped not to be heard. Steve supposed in the Dark Ages such caution was warranted.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispered, achingly human.
No, this Steve’s ruined all on his own.
“Make me,” Tony grits outs with the tiniest hitch in breath and it sounds like a sob.
Blue eyes close, resigned.
, I’m saying you're pretty big and - “
He wondered if Tony designed them that way on purpose.
was the goal.
“You called, I came,” Tony says casually like he’s unaware of the significance of that. He looks around at the decor; the wicker furniture and portraits of flowers. “You going to tell me why I’m rescuing you from what are clearly the clutches of a little, old lady?”
“That all you want to say?” Steve has to fight to keep his voice even.
“Yeah,” Stark says thickly, “I should be there and I’m not,” he looks at Steve, "and neither are you."
” It comes out the same way Tony spits
Steve suppressed a shudder. “You’re only human, Tony.”
. It feels like Steve’s insides are being wrung out and exposed in front of an audience. She knows about Bucky and now Stark does too.
“It depends on what you want to get out of it.”
“Happy now?” Tony asks. The answer is obviously no and it’s little relief Stark isn’t happy about it either. “Am I at least allowed coffee?”
The mark on Tony’s throat was covered by a fashionable black coat from which a red scarf hung, streaming down like blood. A ritual sacrifice at the altar of Steve Rogers. His gaze was a million miles away. “His revenge consumed him. The night of the revels he was so fixated on punishing me he didn’t recognize his one true love, back from the dead, and standing right in front of him."
He said nothing more and Steve almost blurted out
Tony snorted and his eyes drifted shut. He was already asleep when Steve carried him back to bed.
Every bit of Steve comes alive at once, his muscles tense. “What kind of doctor did you say you were?”
“I missed your unrelenting support too, Wilson.” He makes a face at Sam’s pink tie.
“That’s excessive.”
Steve doesn’t know if he’d have preferred someone random or someone better. Either would be an improvement over knowing Tony chose his married, ex-childhood friend to fool around with at the Founder’s Gala. It feels like regression, like everything Tony learned after Afghanistan, after Pepper, is coming undone and leaving the alcoholic homewrecker behind.
They’d done it all before. It was all variations on the same theme: life or death, future or past, red or blue. Steve could hardly blame them for picking up the oft-worn script. He’d spent lifetimes going through familiar motions even knowing it led nowhere and changed nothing. Walking in circles. Steve won’t damn them for the same. Maybe selective memory was the secret to sanity in such a system. Maybe it was the only way people could be happy.
the sane line of Steve’s thoughts pierces though the deluge of physical instinct,
Steve waves Bucky off but all he can think later in the slow dead of night is:
He had expected the lab to be deserted. It wasn't. Bucky was busy checking his knives, Logan was replacing his cowl, Bruce, Strange and Richards were working fast and silently. All of them turned when Steve entered.
“Please,” Tony croaked, all desperation and no fight. The hand around Steve's wrist had blood caked under the fingernails. “Anything you want.“
memories?”
They went on. They made better time on the firmer ground though without the position of the sun Tony could only guess at their progress. Sleep eluded them but whenever Steve called for a halt Tony dutifully closed his eyes and counted Fibonacci sheep. Every time he reopened them the sky was the same flat, metallic ceiling and Steve was already awake. Tony never knew exactly how long they made each day last. During their long marches he tried counting the seconds when he wasn’t distracted by the burgeoning panic at the thought of letting Steve down if Tony couldn’t lead them back through the looking glass and home. He always pointed onwards though, towards the receding horizon.
“You lied.”
“Okay?” Bucky narrows his eyes in suspicion.
Tony didn’t deny it. “The question wasn’t about me.”
Strange was not amused. “I wouldn’t try that again, Captain. Ever. On anyone. Especially not me and especially not Anthony.”
That’s the difference between them. What is abhorrent to Steve is shiny new tech to Rhodes.
Steve watches it fall into oblivion. It doesn't make a sound.
He clears his throat, aiming for authoritative. “Make sure neither of them gets into a suit.”
He never figured out who’d sent for Sharon but suddenly she was in his study. Even dressed in white she had never reminded Steve of an angel. She was too grounded for that, too practical. Steve wondered how long she’d been sitting there in silence. He was skipping through time again.
Sam raises an eyebrow. “Where did you think he’s been spending all his time since he moved out?”
“I wasn’t. But it was the only thing keeping you from going into shock.“
Steve didn’t like where this was going. “You didn’t deserve it.”
Steve… had no idea. Away. It’s becoming harder and harder to envision life outside the Compound, object permanence dissolving at its borders.
But the middle -
It’s not a voice Steve wants to hear. He leans his forehead against the bag and relishes the sound of his own heavy breathing. He doesn’t dare look up. “Did you come down here to enforce it?”
“Mister I’m-an-old-man-and-I-won’t-change-for-anyone.”
“No.” Bucky’s voice is loud and almost vicious. Steve startles and the holograms freeze. “That never happened. The butcher shop was closed, she couldn’t afford anything anyway. She came home with… with…” Bucky looks at Steve a little desperately, like he’s questioning his own memories again.
A fly landed on Steve’s flapjacks, spoiling them. Its wings become saturated with maple syrup as it gorged itself before realizing it would never take off again. Steve watched it drown slowly in sweetness; a fitting end for a glutton. He could feel the blood leaking through his stitches, through his T-shirt.
Steve speaks over him, “ - It’s AIM’s fault your ribs are injured and it’s my fault for aggravating them,” he swallows, “but yes it’s yours for skipping Medical. That’s your responsibility to the Team. They rely on you. You owe it to them to take care of yourself. You can’t just hole up in your lab and wait out the bleeding. Enduring pain when you don’t have to isn’t noble, it’s indulgent.” Stark flinches and Steve finds himself transfixed by a discarded piece of armour. “People want to help you, Tony. Take it, it might not be around forever.”
Sam objects. “Two-vee-one? Not cool, man. I get Steve.”
He can’t let Tony kill Bucky. He can’t let Tony kill Bucky to save
“Time to go. Are you okay?”
Tony had made their Hell a marvel and Steve could never forgive him for that.
He up and retires to the endless prairie of rural Manitoba. That doesn’t rule out any secret work he could have done. In fact, the numerous silos and bunkers littered across the Kovalchyk homestead suggest otherwise, but to the world at large he becomes a landscaper, has his children, and changes his name.
“You’re too late, Avengers!” Sin crowed from the balcony above the melee. “In a few minutes I’ll have freed my father and you will all pay!”
“Well the tea’s very good, almost worth the rough introduction.” He spots Steve’s rigid posture and amends, “FRIDAY said you were waiting for me.”
Steve wasn’t the only one paying for another man’s sins.
Stark’s the respectable one now; all handshakes and goodwill. Steve’s the unstable vigilante with unsavoury friends and a reputation for violence. Still, “You really think that’d stop me?”
This is sex. This is Tony on his knees.
“That's… longer.”
Steve deflated. His uniform had seen better days and his cowl was pushed back revealing straw blond hair. The colour was high in his cheeks and his shield was missing but even in disarray he looked entirely too alive for the dead landscape painted around him. Tony stared down at himself and knew he fit right in.
It takes a moment for Steve to figure out what she means because her plans have always zigged where his have zagged.
. No name, just
“I know.” The only flaw in this paradise was in Steve; in the oozing wound that stung and reminded him that mortals were never meant to live without death. “Send me back. Please.”
“You mean you won’t.” Tony’s voice is harsh. “You’re just going to abandon them? Bucky and Natasha? Sam? I suppose it’s comforting to know I’m not the exception.”
“Was anyone
Steve closed his eyes. It felt like blasphemy to say
Steve would have corrected.
"Is it Betty?" Steve asked, aware as he said it that the question was too invasive for a man as private as Bruce. “Is there anything the Avengers can do? I can do?”
The first time he touches Tony in 27 days is in violence. Steve drives both of them across corridor before either has a chance to blink. Stark’s head hits the back wall hard enough that his teeth click violently. Steve doesn’t give him any time to recover. He spins Stark around, twists his arm behind his back as Steve’s other hand presses at the nape of Tony’s neck, forcing his head into the wall. The grip around Stark’s wrist will bruise, the one at the base of his skull is gentler but not by much. He’s being forced to his toes by the position of his arm and Steve’s body is preventing him from getting any leverage.
Purpose has to start somewhere, even with something small. He is no longer Captain America or a superhero or Tony’s friend, but he used to be all three a long, long time ago. Maybe the forest can wait for this one particular tree.
There was a bitter laugh relayed in bits and bytes. “No.”
Banner paused as if considering it, then shook his head. “I’m sorry for bailing but I won’t risk it.”
?” The word sounds like a punishment. “Cold fusion and flying cars? No?” He’s already brushing past Natasha to leave. “Cap always gave better lectures. Maybe he can give you some pointers.”
“It’s simple. We're off to see the Wizard.
“Like 40s back?”
Tony hums in assent.
He doesn’t seek out Stark that night. Instead he takes his frustrations out on the heavy bag in the gym long past the time when the day shift’s gone home. Natasha’s back which means so is Rhodes and Steve tells himself that whatever messed-up impulses he’s had are just cabin fever. Isolation driving him to things he’d never do otherwise.
"You don't think Tony’s going to - ” There are too many things still broken between them. "He wouldn't. He can't."
That’s not what it is. For so long none of it was real. Steve had carried the past with him like a scar nobody could see. He’d begun to think he’d imagined it: all the good parts and all the bad; like it was a particularly vivid story written down in a book, like it wasn’t his life.
He wonders if Tony told her they’re still falling into it together, if she knows Steve’s already broken that promise.
Steve can deal with Stark hating him but he’ll never forgive himself if Tony goes over the edge. He has watched one too many friends fall. “Please just step back. You can’t be drinking and that close to the edge. If you fell…” Steve inhales sharply. “If you fell and I did
“Go to sleep Tony,” he says gently.
Steve’s hands are wrapped well, white tape reinforcing joints, knuckles exposed. Weapons dangling at the end of wrists. Stark isn’t afraid, wasn’t all those times he should have been.
There’s a rebuke in Natasha’s stare. “As long as you’re complaining about rules being broken: Tony’s letting you drop curfew, Tanaka lets you sit in on classified procedures, and I gave you access to the North Wing.”
“I know you wouldn’t.” Steve can’t put Bucky at risk. Not again. “But mistakes happen.”
“Never,” Tony vowed. “I’m keeping my promise. I’m getting us out.” His voice turned wistful. “I know you don’t believe me but I will.”
“How?” Steve struggles to get the word out.
Steve slowly takes the glasses from Bucky’s loose grip and fits them over his face. Interfacing with machines has never come naturally to him in the way it does to Stark or was foisted on Bucky. Suddenly there’s a cool hand on his temple and Steve freezes as Bucky adjusts the sensors. The same Christmas scene reveals itself, taken this time from Steve’s memories. It’s incomplete, the holograms catch. The figures and solids bleed into each other.
. I misjudged us that badly. That’s…”
Oh Steve’s seen Rhodes angry - he’s even seen him pissed at Tony on more than one occasion - but he’s never heard him climb down into the mud-slinging contest that is fighting with Tony over something that you think matters and that he thinks doesn’t. Now Steve knows that he is not the exception; better men are reduced to it too.
Steve closed his eyes and went back to the Ether.
Vision cocks his head. “I don’t sleep.”
Also: that is not how you treat suspected bruised ribs.
It’s the first time she’s responded to a command given by Steve since he moved back in and he imagines he hears approval.
“I absolutely can.”
“You win,” Tony says hoarsely. He flips the sketchbook closed and Steve doesn’t know if he means in Siberia or the drawing or - “The bet. We didn’t fight.”
Tony twisted in anger and his beauty became monstrous. “No. I’m not helping you commit suicide, Steve.
————————————
Tony gave a tight smile. “Believe me, this reunion is going much better than I thought it would.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Guilt hits Steve like a sledgehammer. “It won’t happen again.”
. Likes to gives lectures of the do as I say, not as I do variety.” His smile slips off his face. “So this little speech about responsibility towards the Team, means
Steve’s head fell into his hands. “You promised you wouldn’t leave me.”
On the holographic globe the typhoon is a beautiful counter-clockwise spiral as it moves towards landfall. Stark sighs. “Fri, show me the numbers I ran this afternoon. Include the probabilities.”
Bucky snorts and it’s almost the same. Steve loses the next game by a respectable eight points. If he ever actually wins, Bucky’s competitive nature might compel him to wear the new arm purely for mechanical advantage.
The Soldier takes advantage of Steve’s wandering mind to hook his ankle and send him sprawling. From the ground Steve can see the Soldier advancing on Tony with intent and manages to reach out and drag him down.
Steve's mouth twisted as he looked down at his hands. “I really hoped this time you’d choose different.”
All Steve's thoughts of Stark are eclipsed by Bucky by the end of November. The Winter Soldier starts regressing and doesn’t stop. At first no one but Steve is concerned. Dr. Tanaka says
The forgiveness feels easy and natural, washing away the guilt in Steve’s stomach before it has a chance to turn cancerous. He’d forgotten what if felt like, how easy it was to breathe.
Steve blinked at the unchanging view. The wound snarled. “I’m not going to make it. I’d rather go on my own terms.”
“The Future had a good host.” Steve smiled and after a moment Tony matched it. “You should know there’s a bet going on about what invention you gave them first. Carol has her money on air travel, Rhodes has the machine lathe. I think Clint chose aqueducts.”
Steve coughs. Tony doesn’t.
“Your conscience never bothered you before so what - oh,” Tony alights on the answer. “It’s not that at all. The Golden Child got a speech from Natasha too.”
When Tony speaks again his voice is calm. “I knew better than to trust you the second time. I knew but I did it anyway because I’m an idiot and you…” His voice trails off and he shakes his head. “So this time ‘round I know. The moment Steve Rogers decides he’s done with me he’s going to pick up Barnes in whatever hopefully non-homicidal state he’s in and you’re going to hand him the keys to a Quinjet.” Steve heart swells when Natasha doesn’t dispute it. Stark nods like he expected nothing else. “You’ll manage to land on your feet I’m sure, and I’ll be here: sober and ready to suit up. That good enough for you?”
Steve tries to swallow down his anger but his voice still comes out low and accusatory.“You don’t get to hide behind projections and a piece of paper. Their government’s wrong but since they’re going to get their own citizens killed that’s fine with you.”
Steve’s grip tightened until the screen of his phone broke, breaks running from corner to corner like cracks through ice. “Yes.”
.” Tony shook his head. “
Sin stopped struggling and Steve dropped her to her knees and dutifully bound her hands behind her. She kept silent, studying Steve with a bowed head. Her eyes were so black he could see his own reflection staring back. He felt seen. He wondered if what she saw frightened her as much as it had frightened him.
“Please don’t joke.” That was the cruellest irony of them all: Tony was dying of a bond Steve had so desperately wanted and that Tony never did.
It hurts to admit out loud just how much Tony still gets to him.
“No.” Tony steals a piece of french toast from Steve’s plate. “Were you actually concerned or just being a possessive bastard?”
Of course he’s already figured out how Steve has access to the North Wing. “It’s not her fault.”
It will haunt him later that the seed goes unnoticed.
. I wanted to die a good man and you made me…“ He stared into nothing. “You saved me, but I’m not
Steve calls him by his first name often enough. Just never around Bucky. He’d hidden that familiarity away with all the other liberties he’s taken.
Wrong move.
Steve never turned him down. He would bury himself in Steve’s bed and they would sleep. It was the best rest Steve would get all week, knowing that Tony was back and safe. Sometimes Steve woke to him throwing up, his body rejecting whatever substances he had substituted for a good night’s sleep the rest of the week.
“Apparently you’re a creature of habit. You didn’t return and she woke me up pretty concerned I was going to find you dead somewhere on Avengers property.”
“I’ll deal with Tony.” Her voice, belying her words, is soft. She shifts her gaze to Steve’s face. It’s a warning. “Don’t go looking for him.”
It’s comforting in its own way. It reminds Steve that he is not alone. After the thin walls of poverty, the army barracks, SHIELD - Steve has never had the space or time to deal with silence. Only over the past few months is he finally learning why the lonely compulsively fill their space with sound. He leans his forehead against the door and counts beats. 1… 2… 3… 4… 1…
It’s a love bite. Faded in the interim hours but still visible, peeking just above his collar. Steve reaches out and swipes his thumb over it. Tony freezes. It’s too red on his skin, even redder next to Steve’s pale fingers. Without his brain’s permission he reaches under the vee of Tony’s unbuttoned dress shirt to flip the collar down, exposing the rest of the hickey and another laid high on Stark’s pectoral. Broken blood vessels in a perfect circle. This is what Tony was aiming to hide.
The harsh halogens are unflattering lighting for anyone but Steve can finally see how jet lagged she looks. Worn and tired under the yoke of responsibility and unable to dart for the safety of the shadows. Sometimes he thinks she’s the only one trying to hold them all together - everyone else is just trying to survive or rebuild or forget. It’s a wonder she hasn’t run off to join Clint yet.
“Rogers nearly took my head off in Siberia.” Tony knuckles are white around the handle of his coffee mug. “He beat me so hard my helmet cracked open, aimed for my head and then drove my father’s last gift to him an inch and a half deep into the arc reactor because your shared secret blew up in everyone’s faces.” His left hand is shaking uncontrollably. “
It leaves Steve feeling ungrateful and spiteful as he chafes behind invisible bars. He’s trapped by Stark’s generosity and the only respite is that Stark sees through the charade as easily as Steve does. It’s a gilded cage, one he walked into willingly. The BARF technology that was Bucky’s best chance is the intellectual property of SI and when T’challa had suggested sending it to Wakanda Stark had said,
They don’t consult him at all this time. He doesn’t even know they’re adding someone until an agent mentions Rhodes got another flier conditionally cleared with the council and Natasha is taking ‘the new guy’ on a tour around the Compound. Steve wonders at what point it’s appropriate to introduce the brand new Avenger to the resident prisoner and then -
He turns and gives Steve the same small utterly insane grin he sometimes got when he said yes to Steve’s riskier plans. The truth of it shines, bright and pure; all he has to do is say the word and Bucky’s all in. He’d forgotten that loyalty like that existed.
Steve never learned what happened with the two of them. He never asked and Stark’s not going to tell.
In fact, Hell was a half-baked compromise. Steve split the difference with an atheist and ended up in Dante’s Inferno. God couldn’t find him in the Ether, His Word hadn’t mattered. Tony’s did.
“I’m sorry, for everything,” Tony said quietly. Then, “I need to call Doc Samson, don’t I?”
In his peripheral vision Steve can see the bright lights of the repulsors aimed at him. Tony’s asking for trust and Steve can’t afford to make the same mistakes twice. That can’t be who he is, or at least it isn’t who he wants to be but he’s not known for his ability to change. It's why Erskine chose him. It's why he's losing Tony.
Tony hasn’t taken the glasses off and Steve knows the moment he leaves Stark will dive right back into whatever memory he needs to relive and rework. It’s an especially bad week for BARF to become functional again and Steve wonders how deep Tony’s self-sabotage goes.
“You’re lying.”
Tony just shrugged. “You’d have to ask him.”
“You’re right.” Tony’s voice was serious as the grave. “I’m bleeding and I killed an innocent creature and it’s not fun. You saved me. You saved Time Square. And now we’re going home.” He edged closer. “You’re scaring me, Steve.”
He had been swept a fair distance downstream before he managed to dig his feet into the muddy opposing bank. The tendrils reluctantly released him as he fought to pull himself onshore and spat out mouthfuls of swallowed water. From where he was doubled over coughing, Tony could only see Captain America’s black combat boots as Steve joined him. A heavy hand landed on his back and Tony stiffened, suddenly aware of his nudity.
The bloodstain was a crimson Rorscach test; you could see whatever you wanted in it.
There’s a moment of tension, the ultimatum vibrating between them.
Tony picks up one of Francesca’s walking canes with a raised eyebrow. “Girlfriend?”
The Soldier catches his left fist before Steve can take a second swing and now he is well and truly immobilized: stuck between the assassin and some entity in charge of the Iron Man suit. He's failed Tony and Bucky both. There’s nothing he can do except wait for the high-pitched whine of a repulsor charging at point blank range -
Tony catches him. “It’s not comforting that you get along with my shrink, Rogers.”
Today though, Avenger’s Compound is a madhouse: agents and officers running around in full flight. There’s a Category 5+ typhoon heading straight for Maldecia and the Avengers are all dressed up and going nowhere. The Maldecian government won’t let them in and under the Accords there’s no exception clause for natural disasters. It’s not a terrorist group or an alien invasion, goes the logic. Hurricanes are neither world-ending nor contagious except people are going to die just the same and this time the Avengers are going to let them.
Under his hands Tony is shaking with a mixture of pain and adrenaline and Steve pretends he doesn’t notice. Stark’s shirt is ripped up the side seam and hiked up to his armpits and Steve can see what he was trying to hide. There’s a swath of red-black bruise blooming across his left ribcage. It’s been hastily bandaged with medical tape, sloppily so, and Steve would bet his life that’s because Tony did it one-handed. Bruised ribs most likely. Hopefully nothing fractured or Tony truly is an idiot.
