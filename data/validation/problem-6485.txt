“And I broke the internet,” Tony laughs as he hugs her back, his closest friend, “I would never have been able to do all of this without you, Pep,” they stay there hugging for a long time, until Tony feels a tap on his shoulder.
“Tony,” Steve is smiling so wide his jaw is aching, “I can’t believe you beat me to it,” he laughs even as tears start to pour down his cheeks. “Yes. I will be your husband. Buck-“
“Not that I can see, Sir,” JARVIS tells him, “though there is a body shape in a room at the end of the corridor, Sir. It appears to be holding some residual heat, perhaps it worth looking at, Sir.” “JARVIS, can you tell who it is?” Tony sighs, praying beyond hope that it is not May or Ben.
“Right,” Tony sets his face in what hopes is a neutral expression. It helps, he thinks, having someone there who he has to keep calm for, someone who needs him to be the person who knows what to do. The folder is a standard manila folder, though its pretty full. The first page is taken up with a handwritten letter.
“You’re not allowed to die, James Buchanan Barnes,” he pokes lightly at Bucky’s arm, “you’re not allowed to die because, if you do then I will have spent all that time working on that arm, for nothing. You’re not allowed to die, because I was going to let you take Peter to that Adventureland thing when he got back, and now he’s back, so you’re going to take him. You can’t break a promise you made to a thirteen-year-old. You’re not allowed to die because,” he takes a deep breath, “because Steve loves you and he’d break without you. You only just got each other back properly. Don’t leave him so soon. Plus, I think I'd miss you quite a bit myself, who else is going to sit in the workshop and listen to me ramble?”
“I’m not stopping you,” Rhodey smiles a little, “Steve’s waiting for you, they’re being kept in room 103, he’s not seen them either; he refused to see them before you. Go to them. Go on.” Rhodey pushes him gently in the direction of the door, his hands on Tony’s shoulders, guiding him like a small child.
“In fifteen minutes,” JARVIS informs him happily. “Should I patch Ms. Potts through?” He asks. The cheeky sod, Tony swears colorfully.
Peter and Bucky had disappeared from their training session. No one has any idea who had taken them, where they had been taken from, when exactly they were taken; even the collective might of the Avengers hadn't been enough to find them. Clint sits on the roof next to Tony, as Steve falls apart downstairs. The only thing Clint can think to do is pull out a packet of goldfish and pass them to Tony. Tony takes them; Clint knows that he’s reliving the past ten days, he’s seen that look in Agents who’ve lost someone, he knows that he once wore that look about two years ago.
“Good well, I have a board meeting in four days, so, I’m just going to head back to the lab. Thanks for the bacon, Cap,” Tony takes the bacon out the pan and starts shoving it unceremoniously on a plate before moving to run down to the lab.
“If I may,” JARVIS interrupts as Steve starts to send himself into a panic. “Here are some resources detailing polyamory; they might be of use to you, Captain Rogers. Another thing, Captain,” JARVIS pauses like he’s waiting for Steve respond.
“Night terrors? From New York, right, the portal?” Bucky’s moving quickly towards the living room; he doesn't even think about it before he’s running silently down the hallway.
“Yeah, Buck, sure,” Steve sighs and walks with him, his stomach a boiling pit of confusion and nerves; it feels like a whole company of dancers are tapping in his insides, there’s nothing he can do to get them to stop as his mind dwells on what just happened.
“Stuff the rules,” Steve mumbles as he buries his face in Bucky’s neck, he curls his hand around Bucky’s neck and pulls him into a kiss. “Stuff the rules. You’re both stuck with me now, unfortunately.”
“Jesus, I wasn’t kidding when I said we should attach bells to you,” Tony snorts, “you both move too quietly for your own good if I’d had one of my gauntlets on. Anyway, good to see you home, Robocop, I’ll need to take a look at your arm, now that you’re here; don’t even want to think about the damage it got hit within the last battle.”
The ride home is quiet, they are sitting in the quinjet in silence; Tony is tapping at his holoscreen, murmuring quietly to JARVIS every now and then, Peter is pressed up against his side, his head on Tony’s shoulder. He’s sleeping, his breathing slow and measured, Tony allows himself to relax just a little; basking in the warmth of his son breathing and alive beside him. Steve is on Peter’s other side, he has his arm around him, his hand is resting on the back of Tony’s neck, playing with the little hairs there. Sam, Clint, and Natasha are stitching up their wounds; Thor is staring out the window, his arms folded, an unusually severe expression painting his face. Rhodey is flying the jet, he's talking to air traffic control, getting the positions of all civilian and military aircraft that could be in their way; his face is set in a grim line of determination.
“What? No! No, I am most certainly not nervous! How dare you suggest that I am nervous, seriously Barnes I thought we were cool,” Tony sputters as both Steve and Clint turn to face him, a bright red blush is spreading across his cheeks.
Tony shifts as Bucky leaves, moving so that his head is in Steve’s lap. Steve looks down at him; Tony is so far gone, Steve knows that if Tony weren't exhausted, he wouldn't have his head in Steve’s lap. It is not something Steve has never seen before when Tony is tired he tends to use the nearest person to him as a pillow, but it’s never been Steve before, always Bruce, or Natasha, even Clint sometimes, never Steve. He doesn't quite know how to react, Bruce usually just sits there; Tasha pets Tony’s hair, and Clint draws funny things on Tony’s face. Steve opts for Bruce’s approach, keeping still, letting Tony do whatever he needed to do. That works for a while before Tony grabs Steve’s hand and puts it in his hair.
“Ye-yeah,” Peter’s voice breaks a bit; it just about rips Bucky’s heart out. But the kid is still gazing up at Bucky with nothing short of wonder in his eyes and Tony is also looking at Bucky like he’s a godsend, and who is Bucky to deny two sets of beautiful brown eyes.
The only light in the room is Steve’s small bedside lamp; it gives out a soft orangey glow; Steve can’t take his eyes off Tony, his tan skin and soft brown eyes, he perfect hair and the blue glow of the arc reactor. Steve doesn't think that he’ll ever see anything more beautiful than the man in front of him. Tony steps into Steve’s space, he places his one of his hands on the back of Steve’s neck and trails the other down Steve’s face, leaving burning skin in its wake. Tony smirks when he hears Steve’s breathing hitch, but there’s no venom or negative emotion behind the smirk, Tony looks very much like the cat that got the cream. Steve isn't quite sure what to do with himself, he’s forgotten how to speak since they went into his room, all he does is draw Tony close to him. His hands finally work out what to do, and he cups Tony’s face.
“Hi,” Steve walks into the room, his hair is slightly damp from his shower, and he hasn't bothered to put a shirt on. He leans against Tony on the huge sofa, not before he leans forward and presses a kiss to each of their cheeks. “JARVIS said you wanted to set up my twitter again? I still don’t know how it works.”
“And what happens when you’re captured by some lunatics? What happens when he becomes a target, you know he will. Tony, please, think about it before you leap headfirst into this. Having a kid is not a joke-“
Bucky’s looking down at his screen, he’s gained about ten thousand followers in the last few minutes; his account has also been verified, not that he really knows what that means. Most the tweets he’s been receiving are about this morning’s press conference. A lot of them are coming from veterans. He replies to as many as he can, he changes his header to a picture of Steve and him watching Tony fix Steve’s bike. His profile picture is still the default one, so he replaces it with a picture of him in his army uniform, his medals pinned to his chest; he adds the pride flag to his username.
Steve looks at Bucky with a raised eyebrow and a smirk dancing across his face; Bucky at least has the decency to blush and mutter something along the lines of that not being what he meant. Tony, instead of feeling left out, like the two had shared a private moment, feels like he is incredibly privileged to see two people so completely in tune with each other. When they turn and face him, Steve looking like he’s the cat that got the cream; Bucky looking mildly horrified, all he does is smile and walk out the room. He valiantly tries not to skip, but if he hops a little, then no one’s going to stop him.
“What if I mess things up, Bucky, you don’t know what it was like before; there was hardly a day where we weren’t at each other’s throat over something. It was awful. We barely spoke, unless we were fighting. I don’t want to, you know, creep him out. What if he doesn’t like men?” Steve looks at Bucky, panic visible in his eyes. Bucky softens, he knows that Steve is really freaking out, and no matter how much it hurts him, he won’t let his feelings get in the way.
“So you’re a wizard?” Tony raises an eyebrow, “because I can say now that there is nothing that magic can do for him that medicine has already tried.”
“Thank you, Tony,” Clint smiles, and pointedly takes out his hearing aids. He turns back to fletching his arrows, letting Steve and Tony that he’s not listening or watching them. He signs to Steve, ‘it’s okay you can carry on.’
“Right,” Steve laughs, as Tony blasts off, heading towards Bowery. “Okay Avengers, what are we looking at?”
“You have an AI?” Peter asks, which throws Tony because, damn, even Coulson had taken longer to work JARVIS out than that.
“Thanks, Steve,” Tony exhales, his chest sinking as he scrubs a hand across his face, “let's do this then.”
“You can’t stop us,” the words are barely whispered, but Tony hears them all the same, “AIM.” The man breaks one of his teeth and foams at the mouth, the gross liquid runs down Tony’s gauntlet, the guy twitches for a few seconds before he goes limp; Tony drops him to the ground.
“He says he is your son, sir, should I let him in?” JARVIS sounds almost amused; there is a small of tiny of worry in that usually impassive voice. JARVIS zooms in on the picture the boy is holding something to the camera. A crumpled piece of paper with the tower’s address hastily scribbled on it, there’s a name there too and a photo of a girl, Mary Parker, looks about twenty-five; she’s smiling at the camera. Tony feels like ice has been poured down his back; he knows her, they had about two dates back when Tony was trying to fit in with what his father wanted him to be.
“Not long, the matte black is really just a hyper-durable vinyl wrapping, and the star is just some grey paint so like four hours I reckon? J?” Tony sticks the wrench behind his ear and takes out the screwdriver.
“Yes, Steve, they made signs. There are always going to be people with signs, but I love you, and you love me. That is all that matters. That I love you and you love me and that you, Bucky, Peter and I are a family. I don’t care about the people with signs, I care about my family, so if I’m happy and I’m not hurting anyone then fuck the people who don’t like it.” Tony pecks Steve on the lips then drags him over to the table where a plate of scrambled eggs lies steaming in front of his place.
“You okay in there, Petey?” He asks, placing a hand on the glass, “we won’t be too much longer, just checking out that ankle.”
“Hey, do you think you could call me James?” He asks, softly, once he’s out of Steve’s room, “Mr Barnes was my da’s name.”
There’s quiet in the room as each of them just sit and absorb the words, Steve and Bucky remembering events that brought them to that moment. Tony’s eyes are far away, he’s preoccupied with something else like Bucky and Steve had triggered some forgotten memory. Steve can see a single tear running down the side of Tony’s cheek; he stops himself from wiping it away by gripping is mug tighter than before. Tony doesn't seem to notice he’s crying until tears are making a steady stream down his face.
“You don’t think…” Clint asks, shaking his head. “It can’t be- it won’t be. There’s no way he’d do that right?”
“You want me to help?” Bucky asks incredulous, he’s not exactly the picture perfect upstanding Avenger that the rest of the team seem to put together. “Why not Steve?”
“Take a breath before you pass out, kid,” Tony grumbles, his voice low and soothing, “we should take this somewhere a little more private, huh, we don’t want everyone here knowing all your business, do we?” He gives Peter a little smile and moves to steer him towards the offices, stopping before he starts to walk. “I have a room here still which we can use to talk some things out, okay?” Tony asks, looking at Peter, waiting for the boy to answer.
“Then you don’t have to,” Steve squeezes his shoulder once before dropping his hand, “as long as you want me there, I will be.” He knows its true; it has been for a while, it only just hits him then just how much Tony means to him.
Bucky laughs as he opens the picture and sees Steve’s face with Tony’s poking out from just behind his shoulder. He saves it to his personal file and reminds JARVIS to print it out and frame it for their bedside table. It has nearly a million retweets already, and it’s not been up more than an hour and a half yet.
“Sure thing, Captain, on my way,” Bucky says, his voice all business; Tony can hear him clipping his gun to the holster on his back as the metal arm whirrs next to the mic on his comms.
“Maybe they're in the gym or something?” Tony can hear that Steve is starting to worry too, his eyes are open now, and tension is setting into his shoulders in a taut line. “JARVIS, are Bucky and Peter anywhere in the tower right now?”
He’s cut off as Bucky’s voice comes through the comms, “I’ve been hit, uh,” there’s a terrible, rattling breath, “it’s not good. Stevie-“ Bucky’s cut off by something, Tony can feel his whole world shrink, he can’t focus on both Bucky and Peter, he’s frozen to the ground; he can hear Rhodey shouting at him, he can feel the other man’s hand on his shoulder.
“You aren't dangerous Peter,” Steve wants to punch Nick Fury, he wants to hurt him so hard, he hasn't felt anger like this in a long time. “Fury shouldn't have said those things. There’s nothing wrong with being strong, and there is nothing wrong with you. You are not a monster, and you are not dangerous. I’m sure your dad said that too. You just need to learn to control your powers, that might take some time, but it does not make you anything like dangerous. You are a good boy, Pete, you are kind and generous, smart and big-hearted. None of those things describes a monster. You are a good person who had a bad thing happen to them.”
“I’ll talk to Fury, no point being Captain America if I can’t use it for anything, is there?” Steve grins, as they pull apart. He starts to lead Tony out of the room by his wrist, Tony shakes his head a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.
“Rhodey,” Tony looks up, sitting down in the long-abandoned chair by that sat by his desk. “What’s going on? You guys have been silent for days now; I was beginning to think-“
“Nope!” Tony pops the ‘p’; he makes Peter walk in front of him, his hands covering Peter’s eyes. “You alright like that, Pete?” Peter nods and grins, Steve can see him starting to vibrate almost from the excitement. “Okay, come on then.”
Tony looks down at his menu; he takes a deep breath, his heart swoops like it does when he takes a risky dive in the suit. When he looks up both Steve and Bucky are looking at him, not like he owes them something, more so with patience and indulgence. His heart is telling him to go for it, to take the leap but his brain has blocked the words from coming out; he knows that his face is colouring with effort. The corner of the menu is bent and dog-eared from where he’s worrying it between his fingers. There’s a churning feeling ricocheting through his gut, his stomach is twisting and turning; he knows that he should just take the leap, that he’ll regret it if he doesn’t, but it’s still taking him everything to actually do it.
“So, this has happened,” Bucky smiles as he comes into the room, sitting across from Tony. “Honestly I think I should get twitter, I wanna see what people are saying.” He looks at the screen JARVIS has just popped up in front of him, all the well wishes that are coming through Tony’s personal account. “Hey look, this World War Two vet has just come out to his family, ninety-five years old and he’s just come out.” Bucky shoots the tweet, from the vet’s son, over to Tony. “Tony, will you help me set up a twitter?”
“Four hours will be ample time, Sir,” JARVIS responds, “we should have you up and running in less than a day, Sergeant.”
“We’re just gonna go grab something,” Bucky grins and ruffles Peter’s hair on his way past. “No peaking kid. We’ve tried real hard to keep this secret, don’t you go ruinin’ it at the last second, you little rapscallion.”
“Not without me, I hope,” Bucky presses a kiss to Steve’s cheek, “you were up n’ gone pretty early this morning. Long run was it?” Steve kisses him back, before he ruffles his hair.
“Sir, I have located Mr Parker’s aunt and uncle,” JARVIS says, the mood in the kitchen shifts, Tony looks at Peter who has a hopeful expression on his face. “They are being held in a Hydra facility just outside of Düsseldorf, I should warn you, Sir, that I cannot tell whether they are alive,” JARVIS says.
“You know,” he says quietly, words barely above a whisper, “I never cried over my parents before. When it happened, I think I was too in shock to do much, you know? Then I figured I was better off without them, well, without Dad anyway; so I just kind of dealt with it, I signed off the company to Obadiah and moved on. I just, didn't think about it, and then I was too busy with SI, and the Avengers, and you know the world ending. This is the first time I’ve properly thought about it,” Tony’s voice is soft and full of barely disguised pain. “My Dad, he’d have given Peter a drink and told him to get over it. He was an asshole, but he was still my Dad. I think a part of him loved me in some twisted way.”
“Yes. Fuck yes. Patch her through to me, now.” Tony sits up, his heart pounding; luckily the conference was always going to be held in a room in Stark tower, so he doesn’t have far to go.
“It’s okay,” Bucky smiles, “we talked, and I have a ring as well.” He shows Steve his ring, red and gold wind through a thick band in a plait. “And Tasha is actually ordained, so she’s gonna marry us all. Stuff the rules, right?”
The movement is familiar and alien all at once; he’s carried Steve a hundred times before; but not after he’d been defrosted. He hasn't really touched Steve at all since leaving Wakanda, and he can’t help but miss the natural touches they had shared during and before the war. Bucky shifts so that he’s carrying Steve bridal style, it’s a strain this way, but a fireman’s lift would wake Steve up. Steve’s room isn’t far away, and the metal arm was designed to take a lot of weight, he knows Stark made it so that Bucky could lift buildings with it; it’s his human arm which complains because of the weight.
He glances between the two of them; they both show their happiness in different ways. Tony can pick out the signs of it in Steve, and he uses them to guess at what’s going on in Bucky’s head. There’s a moment where everything seems to still, where Tony’s breath catches in his throat. Steve gives Bucky a look, words are passing silently between them; Tony thinks he knows what’s being said. Bucky is suddenly pressed just a little closer to Tony, he’s looking at him more intently. Tony doesn't want to pull back, and this time he knows that he doesn't have to, that now it’s all out in the open. Just before Bucky closes the gap, Tony looks at Steve; he’s glad he did, Steve’s eyes are focussed on Bucky’s hand, where it rests on Tony’s arm. Red is prickling its way across Steve’s cheeks, and his blue eyes are completely obscured by black; any concern that Steve could be thinking that they were doing something wrong is dashed. Tony feels no guilt as he leans forward and brings his lips to Bucky’s.
Natasha, as usual, is right; Steve and Tony are both pacing downstairs, they look up at Clint as he walks down the final few steps. Tony looks like hell, his hair is a mess and he’s wearing his workshop clothes, a tank and some tracksuit bottoms which are both covered in oil and various other stains Clint does not want to know about. Steve doesn't look much better, even if he looks less tired because of the serum; Clint doesn't know how to tell them what they've worked out, he doesn't want to tell them what they worked out. So he just sits down on a chair and cradles his head in his hands breathing deeply for a few seconds.
“I love you too, kiddo,” Tony looks over to Bucky, who hasn't let Steve go since he let Tony go. Tony smiles over at him, and mouths love you to the both of them; Bucky smiles back a little tired, a little broken but there and alive. Steve runs his hand through Bucky’s hair and mouths the words back to Tony. It has been a long, long time, but Tony finally feels at home again.
“He’s going to be okay though?” Peter pales, visible even in the dark, Tony can see his face drain of what little colour it had. “He’s not gonna die is he?”
“You alright, Bucky?” Tony asks, tilting his head even as he picks up the wrench and starts working on Bucky’s arm again. His fingers are moving slowly up the arm, “you know I’m going to have to take this off completely if you want the respray done? Do you wanna do that now or later?”
“Captain America! Mr. Rogers!” Steve tries not to stop. He really does. But he does stop. He turns to look at the person who called his name. “Do you support having Avengers who are gay? Is this the message you want our children to see?”
The workshop is a chaotic mess of tools and various different holograms; Tony is buried under hologram of the suit. He’s humming along with the music, something by AC/DC, Bucky assumes, judging by the guitars and the voice. Bucky can’t see Tony’s face, his back is to the door, and he’s pretty sure that Tony hasn't heard him come in. There’s a moment when he considers walking out, but his arm is now starting to hurt constantly, small sparks of pain flying up and down it and into his chest.
“We combine to make the ultimate dad,” Tony laughs, his face breaking into a huge smile, “it’s perfect Petey. On the count of three, let’s break the internet. One. Two. Three.” They press post. “JARVIS. Turn all notifications off for every device on the Stark Network in this building. Put out the statement that we prepared last week and send it to the New York Times.”
Clint and Peter are in the kitchen; Tony pops his head in, Bucky can’t hear many of the quietly whispered words but before he knows it Tony is kissing the top of Peter’s head and leaving the room. Clint gives Bucky a thumbs up and a wink, Bucky can’t help but smile a bit before nodding, he does roll his eyes when Clint waggles his eyebrows though. Tony shakes his head and takes Bucky’s elbow leading him to the elevator.
The room is so cold and clinical, there’s nothing in there save for a bed and two chairs. There isn’t even a window. SHEILD insists on caring for Bucky at HQ and Steve knows better than to resist. He wishes that there was something to take his mind off things. The walls are painted a disgusting off-white colour, like rotten milk. Steve feels himself falling apart, slowly, but surely with the beep of the heart monitor, tapping out a rhythm to which he’s losing his mind. There is nothing he would not give for Bucky to wake up, he would lay down his life so that Bucky would live. His best friend has had far too harsh a life, far too sad an existence to die now. Steve is crying, he knows he’s crying; he’s pretty sure he hasn't stopped since he sat down in the chair some time ago.
All in all, Steve really should have seen the big lizard coming; turns out there had been a nest of them under Bowery for ages. The babies, they’d dealt with, now the mom is pissed. And Steve just happens to be in the path of her destruction. He looks up as she crouches on to her six limbs, black eyes glinting into the sun, her teeth are covered in venom and spittle; her forked tongue lolls to one side. She’s nearly the size of a building, and she’s looking right at him; Steve knows that he should call for backup, maybe for Doctor Strange to conjure a portal into space. He doesn't though, he squares up to the giant lizard, turning on the ball of his foot to face her. His heart is hammering in his chest; his body is flooding with adrenaline as she starts running towards him. Her tail swings through the street, throwing cars and smashing windows. At the last second Steve jumps, he hadn’t been listening to the noise the lizard had made as she thundered down the street, he’d been listening for the familiar sound of Tony’s suit. He is pulled out of the way at the last second, watching as the lizard impales herself onto Natasha’s blade, spilling green blood all over her.
“I could do it?” Bucky says, “I’m better at jumping off buildings than you anyways. It’d be good for me to get out, I need to get back in shape again; I’m feeling like an old man.”
“Aunt May said I should go over to my friend Ned’s house last night, just while she and Ben sorted things out,” Peter takes a deep breath, he looks so small sitting on Tony’s couch. He just wants to go over to the kid and make him feel safe. Tony nods shifting a little closer to the boy. “So I did what she said, but I remembered I’d left my school stuff at home because I packed so quick last night. When I got there, the house was empty and I couldn't find Aunt May or Uncle Ben anywhere. I didn't know what to do so I figured I needed to grab the folder and come here.”
“Our feelings? Tony, nothing is going on between Bucky and me,” Steve is shaking his head, his blue eye wide with surprise, “I wouldn’t do that to you, you know-“
Warnings for this chapter: graphic wound description, mentions of PTSD and a panic attack (that's not in detail and not POV but it's there).
“Nothing, kid. I’m takin’ you for ice cream and that new Jurassic Island flick, your Dad said we could,” Bucky watches as Peter’s face lights up, “then Clint is gonna watch you tonight, I think he wants pizza or burritos or something, while Tony, Steve, and I go get burgers and talk about boring shit.”
“The press conference where you are to announce the charitable foundation, and your sexuality, Sir.” JARVIS sounds vaguely amused. “Ms. Potts has called you several choice insults now, Sir, you are advised to answer the phone.”
“Try nationwide. We don’t know how long its been since they were last seen in the local area,” Tony says, smiling as he watches Peter try and work out where the voice is coming from.
“Thank you, Evan,” Tony smiles takes the proffered menu, Evan leaves them, and Tony clears his throat. “We should start I guess, no time like the present. I was going to say, before this evening, that I didn't think I could do the whole three people relationship. I was going to say that if you two wanted to date then, that’d be fine like we could share Steve.” He notices how Bucky shrinks back from him, so Tony squashes the bubbling anxiety down, he thrives on the nervous energy that is pulsing through his veins. It feels like the moment Steve first kissed him, and he loves the electricity that is coursing through him. “I was going to say all of that, but then I guess something changed. I don’t want what I thought I did.”
“That’s cool too I guess,” Peter shrugs again, he’s turned from excited and full of energy into the quiet and vaguely scared boy Steve had seen that morning, which is honestly heartbreaking. “Is he gonna be our bodyguard or something?” It’s a childish question, but Steve knows that it isn't uncommon for children to regress a little when scared or nervous.
“Ready to break the internet?” Tony grins up at Bucky and Steve, the others have slowly filtered out the room, most of them heading to the bar. It’s a private moment. Well, as private as it can be with so many people around. “Peter! Have you posted to instagram yet?”
“Honestly, Sir, Tony has to go and tell his twelve-year-old son, that he only just found out about and met, that his aunt and uncle have died; so really, Sir, with all due respect I will shove my shield so far up your-“
“No really, I know what grown-up shit means, Bucky,” he grins, “as long as you keep being the fun dad, its fine. I need someone to sneak me chocolate cookies at night and stuff, so if you get to be my third dad that doesn’t mean you become all boring like Steve and Tony. Also, it’s Jurassic World, not Jurassic Island, Old Man.”
“Permission to advance in through the room on my own, Captain?” He hadn't noticed Wanda entering the room, but he looks up an sees her standing there; there’s something soft in her eyes. “I don’t think it would be good to leave Sergeant Barnes on his own at the moment.”
“Clint! Tasha! Get to Ben,” Cap yells as he sees, through the splintered wood, Peter’s uncle collapse on to the floor. They surge forwards, moving together like the well-oiled team they are, each of them following the plan they hadn't needed to speak to make.
“They never stopped looking,” he whispers, his finger tracing the words, slowly as he reads the rest of the article; it is a desperate plea to whoever took him and Bucky, begging them to come home.
“Right away, Captain,” JARVIS sounds warm and fond, it makes Steve smile more before he starts to stroke through Peter’s hair.
“Okay, we gotta go, sir,” Natasha stands in front of Steve. “I will report to you at HQ tomorrow morning at 0900.”  As Fury hangs up with a huff, she turns around. There’s a huge smile on her face. “Don’t worry; I’ll save your ass.” She shrugs, “I do it for Stark on the regular anyway. Besides sometimes, when Fury gets really annoying, Clint will take out his hearing aids, and I’ll pretend to have forgotten English.” She grins, “Stark needs you to be with him in this, the kid practically worships the ground you walk on, and I think Stark really does need help. So, I’ll cover for you with Fury, and you get Iron Man back up to where he was.” She walks away and goes to sit with Clint, signing to him, her hands a rapid blur.
“Tony,” Bucky says, prodding him lightly on the shoulder. “Tony, you need to go back to bed, you’re gonna get a crick in your neck, man.” But Tony has fallen asleep, he huffs and leans further back into Bucky. “Fine,” Bucky sighs, leaning over the sofa to prod Steve. “Hey, Stevie, we need to go to bed,” Steve seems to be asleep too, Bucky knows that he’s not been getting the best nights sleep for the last few months. It had started in September when the weather turned cold, now the weather is warmer, he had hoped that it would be easier for Steve to sleep properly, but he knows that Steve just hasn't fallen into a good sleep pattern yet. He’s half tempted to leave them like they are, give something for Clint to laugh at in the morning, but a slight wave guilt rises through him. “Fine,” he says again, shrugging his shoulders, “I’m a super soldier, how heavy can you lumps be?” He wriggles out from Tony, lying him gently on the sofa, before pulling Steve into his arms.
Tony still can’t quite believe that he’s sitting here holding Peter in his arms. Peter, who had grown so that he was nearly as tall as Tony, and honestly twice as strong; his hair had been grown out, and it looked like it had been dyed a honey blonde, but nothing had changed as Peter curled into Tony’s arms. Steve is currently sitting with Bucky leaning against his legs; Bucky has a few of his memories back; they’ve been in Avengers Tower for a few days, long enough from him to have undergone some treatment. He’s got huge dark circles under his eyes, but he looks mostly at peace. The Winter Soldier seems to have been easier to dispose of this time.
Peter doesn't reply, he nods and stays in the same position, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder; his arms are wound around Steve’s waist. Steve smiles and presses a kiss on to the top of Peter’s head, he feels privileged that Peter thought he could talk to him, but he also feels a surge of worry; he hopes that Peter has told his dad about how he was feeling. Steve doesn't want to discuss Peter without him present, but he knows that Tony should be aware of how his son is feeling. Peter’s breathing slows and evens out, he’s fallen asleep, snuggled into Steve’s side. Steve is sure he has never seen anything more adorable in his entire life, but he is also completely trapped. Peter has huge black bags under his eyes and Steve is pretty sure that he hasn't been sleeping, so now he can’t move, because if he does he’ll wake Peter up. He sighs and looks up at the ceiling, wondering if he could talk to JARVIS and get Tony in here without waking Peter.
“You. You read about polyamory?” Tony asks, raising an eyebrow, his brown eyes glittering with something akin to amusement. “You read about a relationship like what we could have?”
“Yeah, yeah, make sure he’s safe, get him to Tones; then go and sweep the building with Falcon and Widow. See if you can recover any information about what they did to him, I’m sure Tony will want to know as much as possible. Then, Hawkeye, tell the whole team to get some rest, good food and sleep are what we all need right now. Contact Fury, tell him the team is out of commission until a week from now; tell him that he shouldn't contact us for anything short of the end of the world.” Steve is wearing a tired smile, he’s looking at Peter, “Pete, it’s going to be okay, you’re going to go and see everyone, then you and your Dad are going straight to the doctors; they’re going to help you, then you’re going to get some burgers and go to bed.”
The get to the living room and Peter looks around with wide eyes, Clint and Steve are just about visible in the kitchen, which is just off to one side. Peter freezes at the sight of the other Avengers, but instead of fear on his face, he looks almost awestruck. Tony wants to laugh but he knows that this would be exactly the wrong thing to do in front of his son that he only just met.
“Oh yeah,” Clint grins, “but when we’re put together, we make a sort of functioning family. You know, teamwork and all that shit.”
>>captain america and the other avengers represent doing the right thing even when it’s hard to do i am so proud of them all for sharing this with us #gayvengers #calledit #captainBImerica<<
Clint fully expects to fight his way out of the facility, but the building is empty as they move through it. The bodies of the agents they fought their way through on the way in still litter the corridors, he tells Peter to look up and straight ahead as they pass them, the kid is too young to see death like this. He ignores the voice in his head that tells him, that when he was Peter’s age, he saw deaths ten times worse than this.
“No, Sir, there are no signs of life anywhere near your current position. Captain Rogers does wish to inform you that the rest of the team is moving into the building.” JARVIS says, “he also wishes you to turn on your comm, Sir.”
“I know, you’re with Tones, I know, Stevie. It’s okay, you’re my brother, you know. You’re my brother, that’s never going to change,” Bucky nods, his voice sounds strangled like something is lodged in his throat. The words sound like they’re causing him pain to say, and Steve really doesn't know what to do. “We don’t need’a talk about it, Stevie, I get it, don’t worry ‘bout me.” Bucky swallows, “can we go to the kitchen now, I’m absolutely starved.” Bucky squeezes Steve shoulder and starts moving off to the kitchen.
“I’m glad he’s okay,” Steve mumbles into Tony’s chest, he can feel Tony’s hand combing through his hair; he loses himself in the touch. “I’m so tired.” He yawns Tony can feel it against his skin, the small puff of air. “I’m tired of watching over friends as they lie in hospital beds. I just feel like there's nothing I can do, I'm supposed to be a hero and there's nothing I can do.”
Thank you for all the kudos so far, it really means a lot! Maybe consider leaving a comment? Tell me what your favourite part of the chapter was or something idk lmao!! Thanks for reading!
“You built hand and footholds into your suit?” Steve asks, his eyes going a little wide as he finds the holds.
“Oh shit, oh fuck. Did you just ‘young man’ me, Barnes? Oh, it is so on,” Tony’s laughing so hard he’s doubled over, there are crinkles around his eyes, eyes which are now filling up with tears. “Fuck me, Barnes, that was flawless.”
“No, I was cryogenically frozen for 70. I don’t appreciate your tone young man.” Bucky deadpans, raising an eyebrow.
“Tomorrow, at eight is perfect,” Tony says, pulling him in, for another kiss; as though any moment where their mouths are not touching is a moment of their lives wasted.
“I do have an apartment in Bed-Stuy, but Simone lost the electrics, and hot water in her’s so I said she could have mine while I bunk over here. She has two kids in school so she can’t deal without electric and hot water.” Clint smiles looking at the slightly shocked expression on Tony’s face. “Yeah, Stark, I’m actually a nice person. Do miss my dog though.”
“I will never be angry with you for something that wasn’t your fault, Peter. You didn’t ask to be kidnapped, alright, you did nothing wrong. Now can you get down here, so we can check you over, please,” Tony gestures down to the ground. He looks at the building watching as Steve comes out of the doorway, a slightly disgruntled Sam in tow.
“No, no, I’m fine. I’m not in pain.” Peter gasps, he shakes his head turning to Tony, “please, Dad, I can’t do that.”
“Aw, fuck,” Clint groans. “Steve and Tony have gotta know and this is gonna break them, Tasha, this is going to completely break them. What are we gonna do?”
Sam steps up with a knife holding it out to Steve who bends and starts picking at the webbing. Peter is sniggering from where he’s moved to stand with Clint, who produces a flashlight from his belt and points it at Peter. A quick field examination is not going to be good enough to figure out what AIM did to him, but it’s enough to point out the obvious. Clint runs his hands over Peter’s wrists feeling the web shooters that are apparently embedded under his skin; there are ugly red, raised scars that run from his wrist joint all the way down to halfway to his elbow. Peter flinches and makes a small sound as Clint touches them, he takes his hand back and continues the examination just by looking. Bruises are littering Peter’s face, his lip is split, a nasty lump of clotted blood sits on it; that must have bee the cause of the lisp Peter has developed. Clint can tell just by the way that Peter is standing that he must have hurt his ankle, probably from landing on the floor awkwardly; that would have to wait, and it seems like Peter can walk fine. All Clint wants to do is get the boy out of there, he knows that he and everyone else in the team would take a bullet for the kid, he rests a cautious hand on Peter’s shoulder, giving him time to pull away from the touch. There’s a tiny sound from Peter’s mouth, and then he’s leaning into the touch, his big brown eyes that are so much like his father’s, widening and misting over.
“Uh, so my mom and dad were working for shield when they died in a plane crash, it was when I was real young so, ‘m used to not having them around so much. I went to live with my Aunt May and Uncle Ben and everything was fine until like a month ago?” Peter pauses and takes a deep breath, “May and Ben were fighting because it looked like someone had broken into the house. In to the room where my dad’s stuff was kept, it looked like they’d read through it all but hadn't taken anything. Aunt May wanted to move, but Uncle Ben kept saying that we shouldn’t let em win.” Peter stops and fiddles with his hoodie again, the cuffs are fraying and coming apart and the dusky blue material looks like its been through three or four too many washes.
“I’d love to see what it looks like on the inside,” Peter mumbles, yawning a little, “I bet you’ve replicated nerves as well since it seems to have sensation capability.” Tony’s mouth just about falls open before it stretches into a huge grin.
“Send a tweet from the official account stating that we might give a press conference in the New Year, if we feel like it. And say that we don’t want loads of people camping outside, campers will be dealt with in the usual way.” Tony smiles, “I’ll give them hot chocolate and ask them nicely to leave.”
“How often does this happen, JARVIS?” Bucky asks, he doesn't dare move Stark just yet, keeping the other man close to his chest.
“Sir suffers from night terrors, almost every night, a warning sign that they are about to begin is an elevated heart rate. You are the only Avenger awake, I thought it prudent to warn you,” JARVIS sounds like he’s almost pleading with Bucky to do something, “it would be best if Sir had some company, James.”
The phrasing made Tony wonder if Steve meant Earth or back in the place they built up together, where they had been together.
So he kept his kinky thoughts to himself. Even during the “mirror” strip scene. Working in unison like the two strippers required some seriously sexy talent, but looking at the clenching jaw of Steve, he decided to finish his drink instead of talking.
Their clothes came off by both of their efforts, Tony’s shirt the last item to be discarded. The perfection of the naked man in front of him was everything Tony remembered. When you see art made flesh, it was a hard thing to forget.
The rest of the movie went by pretty quietly. Except when “Big Dick” Richie complained that woman didn’t like having sex with him because he was too big.
After a long night of working on his armor, Tony went back to his room, brain still whirling with his schematics that he barely registered his door was ajar. Pushing it open with a little caution, he peeked in.
Balancing one knee on the chair, Bucky shifted his body closer to Steve’s torso. Bucky traced Steve's nipples with the tip of his cock, the smooth head tantalizing against the hard buds. Then Bucky pushed those two large mounds of flesh together, pressing his dick between them. Very carefully he thrust back and forth.
“That happened once. That exact scene.” Steve said, pointing at the portrait. “We were talking about something. I made you laugh and that is how you looked at me. I'll never forget it.”
“And you.” Steve said to Tony. “Keep those hands on the headboard and take it. Just like I know you love.”
“How do you go from talking about a family to jumping on an alien spaceship that may or may not result in your death?”
For a moment Steve only stared at him, maybe the cat got his tongue. “Actually, I wanted to show you something or give it to you, if you want it, that is.”
They hugged and Steve was on his way back home to his "beautiful men". Bucky was going to love that one.
Landing at the Avengers compound was a relief. Not that anyone was really safe anymore but the false sense of security was nice. Bruce greeted them with the other remaining Avengers, in addition to a talking racoon who was just delightful. Steve's absence was painfully obvious.
He opened the door to see a weathered, bearded, and fucking beautiful Steve Rogers standing in his doorway. Seeing him was a weird combination of feeling like a kid on Christmas and being punched in the gut. He had been so worried about jumping on Steve, or doing something equally embarrassing, when he saw him yet now he was paralyzed.
“Are you both hard already?” Steve asked knowing Bucky was, his erection curving upwards towards his belly.  “You two are insatiable.”
Sometimes he wanted to throw the crappy thing off the top of Stark Tower, let it smash into a million pieces and that one phone number would be lost forever.
Things became slow again. Steve was gone a lot. In a way, it was probably a good thing. But Tony missed him. He felt the ache all the way to his bones.
Spinning on his heels, he faced away from Tony. Steve rolled his feet and hips slowly, then faster until his entire lower body was moving.
“Protecting Tony Stark is my primary objective,” there’s a warning in that sentence, Steve can feel it. “You make him happy, Captain, please continue to do so.”
“Yeah! I actually looked it up to see if it still existed, but I didn't know about the name change, so all the google results came out with the definition of what a beefburger was,” Bucky is smiling so wide that Tony’s heart melts a little.
“Where?” Tony’s voice is shaking; he’s on his ninth coffee, the black bags under his eyes look almost purple. The rest of the team, including Thor, have woken up now, all of them blinking sleep out of their eyes; Steve is by Tony’s side in less than a heartbeat, his hand on Tony’s shoulder, thumb rubbing circles into the skin.
“I’m okay, just,” Peter takes a deep breath, Tony knows they need to move quickly, “just hurry up, there’s not enough room in here to breathe.”
“JARVIS,” he says his voice cracking, “scan for vitals.” He knows deep inside somewhere that even if they find a pulse the chances are May won’t wake. Everything in that moment seems hopeless because if the people here killed May, her husband probably went the same way. He curses again because he’s going to have to be a dad, something he is very much not ready for. All the confidence he was feeling that morning seems to have fled from him.
“What’s not a date?” Peter walks into the kitchen from the other direction, through the door that leads down to Bruce’s lab. The kid is covered in marker, different equations, and such pepper his skin, he’s got some sort of dirt on the side of his face, but his eyes are bright and excited in a way they haven’t been since he got taken by AIM.
“You’re Captain America’s best friend,” Peter nods, “I like the comics, you’re the coolest!” He gives Bucky a small smile. “Ned showed me them; I like your arm.”
“I got it Tones,” Bucky grins pecking Steve and pulling back only to be drawn in again for a deeper, longer kiss. “I gotta go before I’m physically made unable to move for the next couple’ hours.” He winks as he stands up and walks out the door.
“Let me drop off Cap then I’ll be right there, Katniss.” Tony snarks as he flies right into the middle of the fighting. Sure enough, there are huge lizards running all over Bowery; they have two foot long teeth lining their faces; they also seem to spit some form of acid. “Really? On my kid’s birthday? Lizards? Fucking really?”
“I guess I could eat,” he mumbles, shock and horror not being enough to deter a hungry twelve-year-old boy.
“Pepper told me that you once did heart surgery on yourself,” he says, now he definitely is pouting.
“Fine, we’ll be down as soon as, can you stall them?” Tony asks, stealing a kiss from Steve as he leaves in his running gear. Now that he’s up, Tony is running at a hundred miles and minute, his brain is working overtime; JARVIS has loaded Pepper’s briefing and is projecting it in front of Tony as he moves around the room.
The first thing he feels is Bucky, big muscular arms scooping him up off the floor; lips are pressed against his, hot and insistent. Tony doesn't even think about not returning Bucky’s kiss; he’s waited all year to feel this feeling again. Bucky’s lips are slightly chapped, and his metal hand is cool against Tony’s cheek. Bucky strokes Tony’s cheek with his thumb, Tony’s arms are winding themselves around Bucky’s waist, resting at his hips; he strokes the tiny strip of skin that’s exposed from where Bucky’s t-shirt has ridden up.
I wanted to add a little bit to Peter and Tony's relationship, but I didn't want to make the last chapter so long.
It's done. Thanks for coming on this ride. This really isn't the ending I'd envisaged but it's nice one, I was going to continue this story, but I really can't. It's too much what with my degree, and my novel. But leave a kudos and a comment if you've enjoyed this story.
“Alright, Petey, don’t worry it’s okay, just as long as there is no pain. I mean it, you need to tell us the truth so that we can help you,” Tony places a hand on Peter’s shoulder, he’s standing by the bed that Peter’s lying on.
“On it,” Bucky grunts; Tony can hear him tearing agents apart with his arm. Clearing the way through to the room. “I’ve cleared the guard but there’s a keypad, it wants some kind of code. JARVIS do you think you could get me in?”
“I’ll give you the menus now, and you can just yell my name when you wanna order, Mr. Stark,” Mr. Evan Cyprus says to him, slapping Tony on the shoulder.
“But,” Natasha raises her eyebrow, snatching the vodka back after Bucky has his gulp, she gestures with the bottle.
“Alright, bud, but if I catch you slaking I’ll send you to the backline,” Steve looks at Bucky with his Captain America face on, until a wobble at the corner of his mouth breaks into a full-on Steve Rogers smile. He claps Bucky on the shoulder, “really though you get tired or feel anything but one hundred percent, you let me know.” His gaze flicks to Natasha, but she’s already walking out the door, following behind Clint fiddling with her gun.
They’re still sitting in the same positions on the couch an hour and a half later, Tony leaning into Bucky’s chest, his breathing is slow, and he’s not shifting around like he usually does. Bucky smiles, Tony’s half asleep, if not entirely and utterly dead to the world; as far as Bucky is concerned, he could stay like that until morning. Steve is looking at them from eyes that seem to be shutting on their own accord; he has Tony’s feet in his lap, one arm resting on Tony’s legs. Bucky knows that if they all fall asleep there, not only are questions going to be asked in the morning, but they’ll all wake up with horrible aches and pains. He doesn't want to make them all move, he’s enjoying the warmth and quiet contentment in the room far too much for that, but he knows that they need to go back to bed.
“You don’t know do you?” Steve sighs scrubbing a hand through his hair shaking his head, trying to stop himself laughing.
Tony’s sitting on the roof when Clint sits next to him. It’s three am. The wind is howling around them, but the roof is safe; Tony has installed an invisible exo-dome around it. It’s raining too, but the dome allows them to sit there, dry. Tony has been sitting on the roof since eleven pm. Since eleven pm eight days ago; he’s not moved a single muscle, he’s just been staring out at the city spread below him a map of glowing gold light. Everyone has tried to get him off the roof, none of them have succeeded; JARVIS has done everything an AI can do. He hasn’t even noticed the dark abyss above him, the thing that has stopped him from going to the roof at night since 2012. Clint worries more about that than anything else, Tony has this way of deflecting everything away from his anxieties, but Clint has always seen the way he never looks up when the sky is dark. Now though, Tony is just sitting, staring; he’s not moving off the roof to go back inside, he’s not glancing worriedly up at the dark; he’s not acting like Tony Stark has always done. Tony’s just sitting there, not talking, not moving, barely breathing, his eyes scanning every part of New York that’s lit up like he can see all the way to Washington Heights and through the hole in the light that’s Central Park.
“But you don't need to?” Steve guesses he’s pressing on a pressure point between his eyebrows, Clint only then notices how pale he is.
Clint doesn't know how to answer if Tony has no idea how to fix this; Tony Stark the genius, the one they all always go to to help them fix things, if he has no idea how to fix this then Clint has nothing. He’d been out a week, a solid seven days looking for them, he’d gone to Asia; where they knew a HYDRA base was, the mission was only a partial success. There was no longer a HYDRA base in Manila. Natasha had taken Europe, somewhere just outside out Dubrovnik; where they had last seen a few high ranking AIM officials. The officials are dead now, and Natasha is sitting in the living room cradling Steve in her arms. They had worked solidly for the past week, in Steve’s case the past nine days, and none of them had found anything.
“Stop picking at the presents,” Tony comes up behind him and wraps his arms around Steve. “Or I’ll have JARVIS make this area out of bounds for you.” Tony pecks him on the cheek, Steve spins around and draws him in. Then they’re kissing properly, Tony’s lips are soft and warm against his and it feels like Steve is home, wonderfully; truly; deeply, at home. “Alright, now it really is Christmas,” Tony laughs. He looks so happy, it’s infectious. “Why don’t you go get a shower and then we can definitely find some mistletoe to get lost under for, I don’t know, like an hour?”
Trigger warnings for this chapter: someone gets hurt, quite badly, there's not hugely graphic wound description but it's pretty bad.
“Tony!” Peter is pelting out of the living room, on to the balcony, throwing himself at Tony and wrapping his arms around him. “I heard the alarm, so I turned on the TV; those lizard things were awesome! But I couldn’t see you; the camera people were too busy focusing on the lizards, not the people fighting them. I thought you were dead because I couldn’t see you; it was terrifying, but then I saw you lift Steve up away from the monster! That was pretty cool by the way,” he pauses for breath looking up at Steve, who has moved so that he’s not in the way of Tony and Peter. Steve nods at Peter, smiling a little. “I thought you weren't gonna come home,” Peter says it directly into the Iron Man suit, and it’s only because of Steve’s enhanced hearing that he catches it.
“Yeah,” Steve says, like he wasn’t picking up their presents, “I didn’t want to miss anything, I thought I’d get the run out the way so I could come home for breakfast.”
Bucky smiles back and walks forward; he knows that Steve is standing in the doorway, he can hear his breathing. He knows the man behind him so well, to know that Steve is watching him very carefully, it hasn’t been too long since Bucky threw the Winter Soldier off. “That’s right; me ’n’ Stevie have been best friends for a long time. Is Ned your best friend, then?” Bucky asks, noticing that the sniffling has stopped, though the tears keep falling.
“Mr Stark!” Peter yells as he runs to Tony, “Ms Potts showed me the newest Stark Phone, it’s awesome! That holographic camera is so cool! Is it true you designed it all yourself?” Peter takes a deep breath. “Wait, no don’t answer that just yet, did you find my aunt and uncle? Are they okay? Can I see them? Where are they? Are they waiting for me at home? Are they hurt? Can I go home?” Tony doesn't say anything he puts his hands on Peter's shoulder to still him a bit.
“Are you going to be okay with this, Doc?” Steve asks, looking up at Bruce, who just nod resignedly and kneels next to Tony.
“What kind of family am I, though?” Tony stops crying; the tears are drying up leaving streaks of salt water that shine in the low light of the room. He sounds more broken than Bucky has ever seen a person be.
Tony smiles as he opens the clips on the box and presents the arm to Bucky. It’s honestly a gorgeous piece of engineering, slimline while matching the dimensions of Bucky’s flesh arm exactly. It’s lightweight, and Tony knows that it’ll feel as natural as any biological arm could ever feel. He had asked Bucky’s choice of colours as a finishing touch to what would have been a boring grey arm. Tony looks up and watches as Bucky’s eye widen, Steve’s do too, he knows that he’s done something right when Bucky gathers him up in a hug, squeezing him so tightly that Tony can’t breathe. Not that he minds.
“Don’t- please-“ Tony pauses and seems to struggle for the right words, “I can’t do this alone.” The words come out rushed and quiet like Tony has been keeping them deep down for a long time. “I can’t tell him alone; I can’t.” He runs a hand through his dishevelled hair; Steve notices that it shakes a little.
“You were singing,” Bucky asks raising an eyebrow, he’s looking at Tony strangely, Steve mentally traces the curve of his mouth, imagining what it would feel like to kiss it. He pulls the thought back quickly, he had been thinking that with Tony standing in front of him, he thinks Bucky can hear the small intake of breath but he elects to ignore it. “What song?”
Steve is panting as he gets back from his run, he means to go around the back of Stark Tower, the entrance that looks like the back door of the restaurant next door, the way he knows that no one will bother him. There’s a crowd that spills out from the main lobby and on to the street though, a mass of people with placards and huge signs; they’re yelling and glaring at the building. Steve knows he’s been out a while, and that Tony and Bucky have likely already finished the press conference. He’s not stupid, he puts two and two together. The crowd must be a protest. They must be angry at Tony and Bucky. Anger bubbles up inside him, burning hatred. He’s been fighting all his life, not just in wars to keep these people safe but in battles against his own mind. Steve has only just come to accept himself being the way he is. These people, they come to his home and want to make him feel like he used to. Like he’s sick. He pushes down the rage, and squares his shoulders, he turns to the front entrance and starts to make his way to the crowd of angry people.
“Bruce was here?” Tony asks, cocking his eyebrow at Clint, who dares to smirk as he fletches his last arrow.
“You eat like a college student,” Tony groans, resting his forehead against Steve’s shoulder, “there’s some more of Natasha’s borscht left over, maybe you could eat a vegetable for once in your life.”
“You need to get him out there as soon as possible,” Tony mutters to the doctor, “he has PTSD, he doesn’t like enclosed spaces, just get him out of there before he has another panic attack.”
“Where are the bodies?” Tony blurts out because really, that’s the only thing that could make Rhodey look like that. “Can I see them?”
It takes three months for Peter to get kidnapped, he’s on his way to school when the bus is stopped, and the bad guys call his name. Peter steps forward. From there it takes them a whole week to find him; Bucky is ninety percent sure that Steve and Tony don’t sleep, in fact, the whole team doesn't sleep. Not properly anyway, they all drop off from exhaustion at some point; the entire team is camping in the common room; mattresses, blankets and pillows move in there, migrating from bedrooms. The room is littered with files and paper, all their research on where Peter is, and who took him; there’s a board where bits of red string links different suspects and areas of the world, it’s mainly for Steve’s benefit, holograms never suited him. There’re take-out cartons on every other available surface, various bits of other detritus clutter the space, the team has basically been living in one room since the first few days that Peter was missing. Thor even came back from Asgard to help look; he’d been going back there semi-regularly to visit his family.
“But what? She, not your type? You into redheads and she was a blonde or something? Or did she not have a winning personality?” Tony looks at him, the soft look has been wiped off his face, it’s been replaced with a look of someone who is focused on one singular thing, and Bucky is pretty sure it’s not his arm.
“I saw you,” Tony smiles a little, he’s handing over the arm to JARVIS, so the AI can paint it. “I saw you with Steve, I see the way you look at him,” Tony looks Bucky in the eye, there’s none of the sadness or disappointment or disgust that Bucky expected to see here. Instead Tony looks understanding and kind, he even looks at Bucky with curiosity in his eyes. “Okay, look, I’m going to wait for JARVIS to finish off your arm; you’re going to take Petey out for ice cream, Steve has SHEILD shit all day, then we’re going to go get burgers and have a proper talk about this shit. Honestly, it’s like neither of you guys knows how to speak, and if there’s one thing my therapist loves to shove down my throat, it’s that using your words is important. So we’re going to do that, yeah, we’re going to get burgers and talk about our feelings like adults. I can give Peter to Clint this evening.”
Tony doesn't know what to say, he’d never even thought of allowing himself to have kids and now his son is standing in front of him. There’s no room in his mind for doubt that this kid is really his son, they have the same nose, the same straight line in the jaw, the same shape to their eyes. There’s an uprising of emotion inside him as he realises that this might his chance to have what he never thought he could.
“First of all, everyone who went in after you chose to be there, all of us knew and accepted that risk. We are your family, and we look after our own, we care about you, Petey,” Steve makes sure that Peter understands, he can’t bear the thought of someone so young carrying so much guilt. “You’re too young to feel this kinda guilt, Peter, Bucky knew the risk he took. No one died. We train for hours every day to make ourselves harder to kill, even if someone died on that mission, it still wouldn't be your fault. It would be the person who killed them’s fault.” Steve places a hand on Peter’s shoulder. “Do you hear me, Peter?”
“What the hell happened to him?” Steve asks, breaking eye contact with Tony, he looks around the room; the rest of them seem just a lost as he is. Suddenly, he turns to Tony looking at him with really soft eyes, “do you want us to go, Tony?”
Steve can hear Tony’s breath catch; he can feel Tony’s hands grip his biceps a little tighter, he knows when Tony smiles and nods, then Tony is back to kissing Steve’s neck. Kissing Bucky is like coming home, a breath of fresh air at the end of the day; it is less weird than Steve worried it would be. He feels like they should have been doing a long time ago, but somehow he knows that it was right for Tony to be the one that gave them the push to do this. Steve also loves how he can feel Tony at his back, stable and warm, and practically vibrating with excitement; Tony’s whispering in his ear, he really hasn't stopped since they got home. Tony is everywhere, his hands are running down Steve’s back, through his hair, rubbing along the waistband of his jeans; Steve breathes in, and he can catch a mingled mess of Tony’s cologne and something that just smells like Bucky.
“Yeah, I know,” Clint sighs, “I know. They’re together though. Barnes will keep him safe, you know he will. He’d die before anything happened to Peter.”
“Um, yeah,” he scratches the back of his head with the arm that’s not currently being detached from his body. “He got really nervous and ended up buying nearly the whole of that Barnes & Noble parenting section. The cashier thought he was real cute though he wouldn't give her the time of day, you know, not now he’s with you. She turned her attention me so fast I got whiplash, but uh…” Bucky freezes, Tony’s humming some nameless tune, but he’s looking mildly interested in what Bucky’s saying.
Warm water sluices down Steve’s back as he lathers shampoo through his hair. The realisation hits him slowly, it feels like a comforting, pleasant, light spreading through him. He loves Bucky, and he loves Tony. There’s no panic, just a little confusion, he wonders as he’s washing the shampoo out if loving two people at once is accepted in this century; he knows that there’s so much of what is and isn’t okay nowadays that he’s missing. He's torn in half or feels like he is. Not one thing he read about this century could have prepared him for it, Tony has been there for everything, every panic attack; he's there at the end of every SHEILD mandated therapy session. In return Steve has been there for him since he got back from his cross-country road-trip; they had fallen for each other without even noticing it. His feelings for Bucky, though, they have never left him, not since Steve was old enough to know what love meant. Pondering on his feelings for a moment, he doesn't notice when he gets shampoo in his eye.
“Clint,” Bucky breathes, his eyes widening; Natasha smiled at him, she didn't say anything else. Instead, she just took a swig from the bottle. “How? How does it even work? I’m not sure I feel like that about Tony, I like him, but…” Bucky trails off, taking the bottle from Natasha.
“Yeah,” Tony says, “tell everyone else to get ready and meet me in the living room; I want as much detail as you can get on the case, J. Hey Clint,” Tony waits for Clint to look at him, “suit up.”
Tony takes his place by Barnes’s bedside, he’s alone with the sleeping man. Memories, from when they first brought Barnes in, fly through his head, he can see them as clear as day. Barnes was silent for the first week, he never said anything, just followed Steve around like a lost puppy; Tony remembers the first time Bucky spoke to him. They were in his workshop, Tony was working on Bucky’s arm; he’d been drawing up specs, he’d threatened to give Bucky a bright pink arm if he didn't say what colour he wanted. Bucky had looked at him right in the eye and said, ‘do it, I dare you.’ Tony had been a little in shock, but he’d laughed anyway and told JARVIS that he could keep the silver. Since then, he likes to think that they have become pretty good friends, sometimes, in the darkest crevices of his mind, Tony wonders if they could ever become more. The thought dies before he can truly mull it over, every time, he wills it so; he has Steve, and Steve is good and kind, and amazing, and so far out of Tony’s league.
Tony runs out of the court, colliding with Steve, as he sprints; he grabs Steve’s wrist and pulls him through the building. They run out into the back car park and dive into Tony’s car. Tony sits behind the steering wheel for a full ten seconds, before he bursts into incredulous laughter. He officially has a son, a child who is his to nurture, to guide for as long as he needs. Steve watches him as he laughs, Tony looks at him. The sun streams into the carpark, gold rays catching Steve’s hair, shining into his eyes, turning them to the colour of tropical seas. Tension fills the car for a minute building in the small space like a summer storm. Tony cannot bring himself to look away. He’s always been a sucker for beautiful things. Steve is a beautiful man. There’s no denying the high cheekbones, well-sculpted jawline, leading into a long neck and broad shoulders; Tony knows that Steve is beautiful. He is no stranger to the spark of desire that’s pooling somewhere deep in his gut; he’s also no stranger to the destruction and eventual misery that spark can lead to. Without thinking they have drawn closer to each other, he can feel Steve’s breath on his face.
"We're practically dead on our feet at this point." Clint bitched as he dodged a laser beam, loosing an arrow at the alien and exploding it.
Bucky steered Peter into the bathroom as quietly as possible. The pup needed no encouragement as he took the towel and PJs from Bucky. A few minutes later the pup came out of the bathroom clean and dry; hair still damp from his shower. Bucky steered him towards his bed ensuring that he did in fact make it to his bed rather than just giving up cuddling up with Tony and Steve.
Tony cut in before Steve could reply, grabbing his pup and holding him to his chest. “Absolutely not. I am not letting you near those gigantic homicidal deer.”
Clint cursed under his breath glancing at Peter who looked just as unwilling to wake the beta. “rock paper scissors?”
"Already called Eye Patch!" Tony cut in "He bitched about it a bunch, but I managed to barter from now until noon Sunday and all for the low low price of some paperwork I’ve already had underoos sort and stamp for me." He reported an air of smugness coming into his voice at the end.
Steve hummed thoughtfully "Maybe, Pup. Maybe. We'll have to see if we can get S.H.I.E.L.D to cover for us-"
Almost everyone was asleep and snoring peacefully by the time they returned except for Tony, but there was no real surprise there. He gave them a small wave from where he was sitting up in bed with Steve sleeping beside him. The soft blue glow of his reactor contrasted with the harsher light of his pad. Even at its lowest brightness the screen still seemed too bright against the darkness of the room.
“If you keep inhaling your food like that you are going to choke'' Natasha glanced down at Peter’s syrup-drenched pancakes “or drown,” she added
“Come here- I'll take you to go get some,'' Steve said, gathering up the omega into his arms, then princess carrying him into the kitchen.
Tony sighed contentedly, pinching a piece of strawberry from Steve's plate when he was too busy with his contest with Bucky to notice; popping it into his mouth and chewing it slowly to savor the sweet tangy taste.
Bucky looked back in the rearview mirror at Sam's chuckle. Upon catching sight of the awed pup, his face so close to the glass it was fogging up with each breath the hyperactive omega took, Bucky's usually stoic face lit up in amusement. In a teasing tone, he asked "You tryin' to merge with that glass, Pete’?"
Peter was practically bouncing off the walls of the elevator by the time they reached the common room floor. He dashed for his spare room as soon as the elevator doors opened.
Natasha cut in “Actually it was Bruce who woke him last. Remember? You told him you would buy him butter masala if he did. ”
Steve shot them ‘help me…..’ eyes as they filed into the kitchen. Nobody paid any mind to him knowing that it wasn't any hardship of his to cuddle the sleepy omega.
About two-thirds through breakfast Sam started passing brochures down the table. It was for a hiking trail called the South Kaibab Trail. The pictures showed steep trails with views that could take your breath away. Tony could only imagine what it would be like covered in a blanket of snow.
Peter smiled, opening it up and taking out a handful. It was full of oats and fresh blueberries. One of the elk cows sniffed, taking a step towards him. Peter held out his hand to the cow and she took the treat from him. Tony watched anxiously as his only pup fed the elk with a glow of pure happiness around him.
"And do what? Hike? It'll be freezing! I say we go to Hawaii and do nothing but lay in the sun and eat chocolate-covered strawberries for 5 days straight." said Clint, Tony quickly agreeing with the beta.
She growled at him from her seat at the table “You wish, Soldier.” adding on “Maybe then you’d stand a chance against me in the ring.”
The grumbling of a certain pup’s stomach pulled Steve from his moment, chuckling he opened his eyes to see a very much blushing Peter Parker ducking his head in a terrible attempt at hiding it. Shaking his head fondly at the pup’s obvious embarrassment he got up motioning for Peter to follow. Peter immediately tossed aside his tablet in favor of following Steve into the kitchen.
Peter looked up when he heard his name, making eye contact with Bucky in the rearview briefly before looking away blushing slightly at the teasing look in the alpha’s eyes. “It’s pretty,” he mumbled defensively with a slight pout on his lips.
"Seven! The lizard showed up as we were leaving from the giant robot fight." Peter corrected the wind roaring in his ears as he swung through the air.
"Why don't we have Jarvis decide? Jarvis put all the options into a randomizer and pick one." Tony suggested as he landed next to where Bucky and Steve were waiting for the jet.
Peter grinned, bouncing over to Bucky excitedly. Bucky huffed, slinging off his bag and opening it up. Peter tilted his head curiously. Bucky smiled, pulling out three things. A water bottle, a pack of their specially made protein bars, and finally a small black plastic bag. Peter zeroed in on the bag immediately “What’s that? Bucky? What is it?! Can I have it? What’s in it? Who’s it for?” Peter questioned him excitedly.
“Thank you. Thank you.” Tony said without an ounce of humility, soaking up the praise like the attention-loving omega he was. When it quieted down he continued “So, where are we going for this little vacation?”
Peter was bouncing up and down in anticipation, his mouth practically a waterfall; eyes as big as saucers. Bucky grabbed Peter before he could jump the pancakes like a starving animal. Steering the hyperactive pup towards the bathroom “Go wash your hands first.'' He told Peter leaving no room for argument. Peter went with little complaint just wanting to get it over with so he could eat.
They looked between each other and the box. Nodding a truce Bucky grabbed the box from Clint. Natasha finished off her tea in one gulp getting up from her seat to come help with breakfast.
Peter shrugged nonchalantly as they walked over to where the jet was landing to take the pack back to the tower. "I'm Jarvis's favorite,"  he said as if that were a perfectly reasonable answer to always winning when it came to the randomizer.
Peter nodded “Yeah. Ground is moving beneath my feet and everything.'' Peter replied, rubbing his eyes a bit as they stumbled into the cabin.
He held it above his head in offering as he walked back outside. Peter nodded enthusiastically, his eyes trained on the old ball which Buck passed back and forth between his hands as he made his way to a clearing. Upon reaching the clearing Bucky turned in a split second and chucked the ball back the way he had come. Peter took off like a rocket after it, returning and dropping it in Bucky’s outstretched mitt just a few moments later.
The pack cooed at Peter's thoughtfulness as they ate on the way to the park. Peter practically glowed from all the praise, his happy marshmallow scent mixing pleasantly with the rest of the pack’s collective scents.
Quick as a flash Peter tore the lid off and lifted the jug to his lips taking a big gulp. Natasha vaulted over the table, grabbing the container before the pup could get in another gulp of the sugary drink.
"Why stay in the United States? I say we go to Rome or Italy." Natasha said as she smashed the final goop-filled creature.
Clint huffed crossing his arms over his chest in defiance “No. No way. I woke him up last time!” he bitched
Peter nodded enthusiastically, digging through his bags to find his suit. Bucky stretched his hands above his head smiling as he watched the pack pup slip on his suit. Almost immediately the suit began steaming as the heaters worked to bring Peter's body temperature up to his optimal range The pup grinned like a Cheshire cat enjoying the heat of his suit. Bucky knew the heater was undeniably Peter's favorite part of his suit. He had seen the teen wearing the suit around the tower when he didn’t have enough times to know that it was more than just a convenience or laziness thing. Not to mention the dead giveaway of the way he purred whenever the heater kicked on.
Having silently nominated himself for tiring the pup out as much as possible before 3 am, which was Peter's designated bedtime, he made his way towards the door. Bucky gave him the signal to wait as he opened the door wide, holding the pup there for a good few sounds longer than he had to just to watch the pup jump up and down like a kid on Christmas, before giving him the okay. Peter shot out of the cabin like hell was on his heels diving headfirst into the nearest snowbank and burrowing underneath it. Popping out a few seconds later in a flurry of snowflakes. Bucky chuckled scooping up a handful of snow and lobbing it at the pup when his back was turned. As expected, the pup dodged it easily throwing one right back at Bucky.
Tony huffed fondly, waving off the over-excited pup "Oh hush. You'll have plenty of time to do everything you want to." He assured Peter, helping him up into the jet.
Steve got up to see what it was. Sitting outside the front door in neatly packed backpacks was all the things they would need for their hike. They were sensible, sturdy canvas bags of varying shades of browns and greys. Complete with walking sticks to match. Steve turned around to scowl at the two betas who at least had the decency to look sheepish. When Steve's back was turned Peter had come following him to the door. Squealing with delight when his eyes landed on the bags he dashed past Steve to kneel beside them excitedly checking the tags to see which was his. His smile widened to a Cheshire cat’s grin when he found his. It was the light grey bag with light brown leather straps that complimented it well. Flipping the top open he was greeted with everything he could possibly want during a hike. There was a plethora of snacks, a water bottle, and a pair of hiking boots and socks among other things.
Rooms on the common floor were generally just for hosing off after a mission and grabbing some clean clothes, or in this case, their go bags, so it wasn't hard to meet back by the elevator in under 30 minutes. Peter, of course, was the first to show, followed closely by Natasha, Bucky, Steve, and Clint. Tony, in typical Stark fashion, was late. Fashionably late as he would say whenever anyone complained about his tardiness.
Steve shook his head fondly at the pup's fleeing form. "Meet back here in half an hour?" He asked the rest of the pack.
Steve nodded “To keep us safe.” he repeated sternly “You have to have more self-control, Peter. If you were to dash out like that during a mission you could be seriously hurt.”
Natasha flicked on the lights of the kitchen blinking at the sudden brightness but otherwise unreactive. Clint on the other hand hissed like a pissed-off alley cat and tried to block the light with an arm. Natasha rolled her eyes at the dramatic beta.
Peter was just setting the table when a very sleepy Tony stumbled into the kitchen. Immediately the sleepy omega made his way over to the coffee machine which already had a pot brewing and made himself a large mug of straight black coffee. Sipping it with a purr the omega sat down at his normal seat at the table, just to the left of where Steve sat at the head of the table.
Until the witch messed with his brain and he saw everyone he cared for dead. He saw that face, Steve's face, dying. He was the one Tony ran to. The one he can't live without.
Walking into the room, Steve found his two favorite people already in bed. Of course neither were asleep because they stayed up til the crack of dawn. Steve had caught Tony sneaking into bed on several occasions as Steve was getting up for a morning run.
“Not when it is covered in chocolate. Then followed by alcohol.” Steve said with a sigh. “Just give me one.”
Suddenly feeling warm, Steve unbuttoned his shirt to expose his chest. Bucky watched him, face not giving anything away. But Tony crawled towards the end of the bed like some exotic cat.
“Ain't no rest for the wicked.” Tony said, returning the smile and closing the door. “It's fine. Can I get you something to drink?”
Panting, Tony opened up his legs a bit to give Steve more access. Which Steve gladly took advantage of, pivoting his finger and crooking the tip. As Tony loosened up, Steve added a second finger. He worked Tony like Bucky worked himself, thrusting and opening. Before long Tony was pushing back towards Steve and rutting his front against the bed.
Unofficially, Tony hopped for another near-death experience so Steve would kiss him again. This time he would be waiting for it and kiss him back like his life depended on it.
Grasping Steve’s large shoulder with one hand and his hip with the other, Tony rocked his hips until he could hear the slap of skin on skin. Tony couldn't resist and smacked  Steve’s ass cheek playfully.
That wonderful man twerked so hard his pants slid off in a graceful movement, exposing a red thong that encompassed his ass like a fucking picture frame.
She nodded, tears streaming down her face. “I love you too but we both know your heart was somewhere else anyway. It's just better this way.”
The next few weeks went by in a blur of activity. On the one hand everyone was always busy, working on simulations, finding intel on the stones, scouting to see where Thanos may have gone, and repairing damages done by battle. On the other hand Tony felt they were no closer to the purple dickwad than they were when they started. They were just spinning their wheels.
The other man shook his head with a disbelieving grin, like Tony had just suggested they could win the lottery.
Rubbing his cock along the area where lace meets flesh, Tony made a strangled noise. In agreement Bucky made quiet little humming sounds and wiggled his hips ever so slightly back towards Tony. The light glistened off the line of pre-cum Tony's cock was leaking onto Bucky.
So why was it always with him? Why did he cling to it when he was scared, or frustrated, or lonely? Why was it always with him? Why did he brush his fingertips against it while he slept and Pepper was clear across the bed, a huge space between them? They were engaged for Christ’s sake and he didn't touch his fiancee half as much as he touched the stupid cell phone.
Tony wasn’t dreaming. He was dead. He was completely sure of that when Steve hit the first hip thrust on beat. This was heaven and he was dead. That was the only explanation.
When Tony’s brain kicked on again, he was leaning against Steve, both of them sweaty and breathing hard.
Steve’s apartment is destroyed in a fight. Tony does the friendly thing and offers him a room at the tower, which he accepted. Steve now lived at his house. Slept at his house. Showered at his house.
“Fine. We're both assholes but you started it.” Tony said, sounding like a petulant child even to his own ears. “And it's over between her and I, FYI.”
Pulling his hand out of Tony, Steve grabbed the smaller man and in one movement slammed him on his back, head landing on the pillows. Before Tony could speak Steve kissed him, plunging his tongue into Tony’s mouth.
Steve slept peacefully at Clint's secret family home. His chest swelled with each deep, easy breath. Tony watched like a man hypnotized until he fell asleep.
Getting behind Bucky, Steve whispered into his ear. “You’re going to fuck him and I am going to fuck you at the same time.”
Bracing himself, he called her on a large video screen. Her face appeared, bigger than life size and looking as weary as he felt.
Dragging his finger through the lube puddle he made, Steve generously coated hsi digit. Keeping his eyes on Bucky, he ran his slick finger down Tony’s crack searching out his entrance. Finding it, he traced the edges where the cheeks surrounded it. He traced the pucker, slowly. Bucky was working himself like Steve had never seen, really putting on a show. As Bucky pulled out his fingers, Steve timed pressing his finger into Tony while Bucky did the same motion to himself.
Part of Tony always thought of Steve as the blushing virgin type, that image was quickly erased. Lips of an angel that moved like sin. A strong tongue that knowingly worked it's way into Tony's mouth.
Almost from far away, Tony could hear Steve murmuring Tony’s name over and over. Trying to focus his eyes, Tony looked at Steve. He tried to pour every ounce of love, lust, and feeling into that look.
Steve laughed. “Nah, I give them the uniform. That's what everyone wants to see. I save the civilian wear for my friends.”
Steve was inside, leaning against the foot of the bed, obviously waiting for Tony. He wasn't wearing his uniform for once, just a plain white shirt and jeans. Relaxed and basic, still looking amazingly gorgeous. His longish hair was slightly wet and combed back. Must have finally taken a moment for himself and showered.
Unofficially, Steve kissed him once, a few months back after a horrendous battle and a suit malfunction that caused everyone to think Tony died. Nothing was said after the heated locking of their lips. Steve just walked away. No one else saw it. For a while Tony thought he imagined it because, well, officially Captain Rogers was straight. Well, for the most part so was he.
Maybe he had offended him with the movie? Maybe it had awoken feelings Steve had buried inside? Maybe his 40’s sensibility couldn’t stand hot beefy men dancing around? Whatever it was, he thought it best to give Steve his distance for a while, let him figure stuff out.
One night he worked late into night. Drinking, working, same difference. He walked into the living room area where Steve was sprawled on the ground drawing in his sketchbook. It must have been engrossing since he didn't notice Tony sloppily sneaking up.
The shower was scorching and wonderful. As he got his pajama pants on, he felt numb and relaxed. He might be able to sleep soon. Tomorrow he would get to work, not tonight.
In tandem they worked their bodies. Steve's one hand gripped Tony’s hip with brutal force, guiding the rhythm as Tony loved it when he did. His other hand wandered all over Tony’s thighs and caressing his cock.
The nervousness suddenly coming off of Steve was palpable. A long time ago Steve would get this way around him, before they really knew each other.
Bucky shot Tony a look that Steve couldn’t read before getting on the center of the bed, which in that bed he was still just out of reach of the other men. With his metal arm Bucky propped himself up and brought the opposite knee up to the side, spreading his other leg the other way.
“Now that you are all stripped so I can see all of you.” Steve said to Bucky. “I want to sit on the bed, open up those long legs, and finger yourself open while we watch.”
“Nah, you're the beauty. I'm the brawn.” Bucky said. “And that lovely thing with his head in your crotch is the brains of the outfit.”
Then Steve started to move. No, not move. Dance. Not just dancing to the music. Magic Mike dancing to the music.
Steve removed his boots while still leering at the others. It could have been the booze or just seeing the two of them laid out so prettily, but Steve’s blood was suddenly on fire.
Tony remembered that day. He was so in love with Steve. Seeing it from this view, seems like everyone else could see it too. Before Bucky, before loneliness, Tony had thought he would feel like Painting Tony for the rest of his life. Before his heart had shattered into a million pieces, he had felt for Steve what he never had for anyone else.
Aww, Tony thought, Mike’s got his own business. He’s building furniture just like he wanted. Sipping his scotch he watched the plot start to unfold. Already he could tell that this movie was going to be way better than the first one.
Tony's fingers tugged lightly on Steve’s thong, riding them up his ass crack just a little more. Wiggling his hips, Steve broke the kiss.
Steve went to the nightstand near the head of the bed and grabbed a bottle of lube before settling himself on the bed, back propped against the heavy wooden headboard. Pointing his finger at Tony, he silently motioned for Tony to come to him. Smoothing the blankets next to him, he indicated exactly where he wanted Tony to be.
A haze overtook him and he moved like he was underwater, slowly falling down to Steve to kiss him. At some point Steve must have joined him in the release because Steve rolled them on their sides to catch their breaths while lying close.
They roared with laughter. Something about Thor made Steve feel a little bit more normal and at ease. Or maybe that easy feeling was the alcohol. The combination of beer and Asgardian spirits mixed together hit him like a freight train.
After Bruce explained it, he looked sheepishly at Tony. “See, I told you before you wouldn't believe me. How does a god like him fall for someone as messed up as me?”
“Maybe try to paint while you're here. We have a lot to do but it might be nice to paint something beautiful, so we all remember what this fight is about.”
Steve shrugged. “We do. We also bring out good in each other. We have to work together on this Thanos thing.”
Tender kisses from Steve's lips covered the sore. Against the tender skin, Steve whispered a prayer of “I'm sorry” over and over again.
It was true. The panties rode up Bucky’s ass just the right amount to gently spread his cheeks open. Tantalizingly there was barely enough fabric to hide his sweet hole.
“Like what?” Steve looked even more confused, like a puppy when it hears a dog whistle for the first time.
“Oh, come on, don't tell me you forget how devastatingly handsome you are.” Tony said with a flirty smirk.
Movement happened around him, to him. Weightlessness as Steve's hands grasped Tony’s ass, lifting Tony onto the bed, laid him against the pillows. Steve's body a heavy, wonderful weight on top of Tony. It was calming in a strange way, being slightly crushed yet feeling utterly safe.
Tony let out a shaky breath, the tightness in his chest finally relaxing. Thank whatever deity let Tony have this small victory. If Steve would have been gone….no, can't think about it.
Since then Steve is all he could think of. Even with Pepper. Especially with Pepper. He loved her but she wasn’t what Steve was to him. He loved Pepper like a painter loved a sunset. He loved Steve like something all consuming. After an argument with Pepper, when he knew it wasn’t going to last between them, that they made better friends anyway, she asked him something that put it all in perspective.
Faster than most mortals can move, Bucky was at the foot of the bed kneeling next to Tony, pulling him up in a matching position. Taking the lead, Bucky kissed Tony, deeply and dirty, making a show of it. Those strong hands, pale white and flashing silver, roamed Tony’s body.
“Were you that desperate to get fucked?” Steve asked. “You guys had to prep that hole to be ready for when I got home?”
Steve looked at him, arms crossed, his blue eyes looked dark and turbulent. “I'm happy you're home.”
It was a few days later when Tony walked into the living room and saw them together for the first time. Steve was whispering something quite into Bucky’s ear, Bucky smiling with his eyes downcast. It was so tender and intimate. Tony wanted to throw something at them but he couldn’t.
Steve stared at him. “The real reason I came here tonight was to see you and tell you I love you. I love you more than I can say, more than anything I have ever known. We're not going to ride off in the sunset together, I know there's too much baggage for that, but you had to know. After all of this insanity, I couldn't stand the thought of me dying and you not hearing how I felt about you.”
Shimming backward, Steve’s back was flat on the ground, knees up and legs spread open. He thrust in time with the song, sending shivers down Tony’s spine. Kicking up in the air then back down, Steve was suddenly standing in a feat of agility that Tony could only marvel at.
Laying on his stomach face towards Steve’s feet, Tony nestled up next to Steve. Tony’s legs bent and rested against the headboard.
With his right hand Tony grabbed at his own prick and pumps back and forth while taking in the vision that is Bucky’s ass. Steve noticed Tony can’t seem to help but steal a few glances at Steve as well.
Tony nodded. He was being petty with his own bullshit when they had a real crisis on their hands. “You're right. We'll start in the morning.”
Focusing, he kicked Steve’s legs a little farther apart. Intending to go slow, he eased the tip of his cock past that tight ring of muscle, however once he was in Steve moaned like a porn star and Tony couldn't help but ram completely inside.
“Tony, help Bucky out of those pants.” Steve said, his voice taking on that commanding tone that caused the other two to shiver.
Starting with his hips, Steve came to standing, sort of moon walking over to Tony. Then Steve dropped to the floor on all fours, ass presented to Tony, pivoting it into the air. Steve’s ass had always been one of Tony’s favorite things to look at but highlighted in those unforgiving sweat pants, it looked to be sculpted out of marble.
Following his orders, the robe tumbled onto the floor leaving Tony completely exposed. Steve knew Tony so well.
It especially infuriated him because “Big Dick” was the hottest guy in the crew. Really, what woman, or man, wouldn’t want to have sex with that guy? Too big, psh.
“Listen carefully.” Tony said. “I'll give you thirty seconds to run from this room. Or else I'm going to kiss you then I'm going to fuck you, Captain Rogers. And once I start I do not possess the willpower to stop.”
Just a few more views of the scene wouldn’t hurt anything, especially because no one was around to tell him not to.
Listening to the radio, Mike worked in peace. Then the music shifted and in three seconds Tony knew “Pony” was starting. Of course Mike couldn’t resist dancing to it. It was like a siren’s call, beckoning him to thrust in time with it’s rhythmic beats. And Mike answered the call, with gusto. The way he moved his body, in a strange gyration that was ridiculously sexy.
"Ah, yes, I can understand wanting to get back to Barnes and Stark." Thor nodded. "Once I would have been envious of such an arrangement between three such beautiful men."
Clearing a spot on the table, Steve hopped on top. It wasn't until then that Tony realized Steve had removed the thong and was completely nude. On his workbench. Knees wide apart. Dick hard and wanting.
Nodding, Bucky ghosted his fingers over the end of the plug, running over the area where plastic met flesh, where his skin was stretched tightly. Grasping the small handle of the plug Bucky pulled it out a little and rocked it back in.
Exquisite pain and glorious relief washed over him as he sank down onto Steve's sizeable length. Before either man could really adjust to the overwhelming sensation, they were both moving. Steve thrust up into Tony as Tony rocked down, their movements beautifully complimentary.
Tony dragged his fingers down Steve's chest, tugging roughly on Steve's nipples because he knew that was one of the man's guilty pleasures. Tony knew the angle to tilt his hips and Steve mirrored with a piston of his cock against Tony’s sweet spot.
Steve shrugged but leaned back into the couch cushions. Tony felt his heart racing a bit, he was suddenly thankful for the arc reactor, just in case he actually had cardiac arrest.
"I will watch a match with you, if you drink something special with me. Something favored in my homeland."
“You both sound like fucking whores.” Steve said before he could stop himself. “Daddy’s little whores.”
Steve was drunk. He could count the times he had been drunk on one hand, almost all of those from the pre-serum days. Before he never saw the appeal but this felt nice. Warm and fuzzy and everything was great. He would have to tell Tony he finally got it.
In the blink of an eye, the sweatpants were gone and Steve was an all fours again, crawling towards Tony. Not quite a crawl, as his legs were open and he thrusted up and down with every inch his arms carried him forward.
“Did you have fun, Stevie?” Bucky asked, dog-earing his place and setting the book aside on the nightstand.
Tony was able to muster enough strength to get up and walk to the beaten up couch in the corner before collapsing.
Officially, he had been in love with Steve Rogers since he snuck his dad’s top-secret files out of his office when he was 13.
The bed groaned with the force of the thrusts. Tony’s knuckles were white from gripping the headboard so tightly. At least they were getting Tony’s money’s worth out of the thing.
Bucky wore black pajama pants that contrasted beautifully with his naked torso and dark hair. He held a paperback novel with the cover folded back, just like every other time Steve saw him read. Tony held his tablet, probably reading over some engineering theory that Steve had no hope of understanding. Or watching porn. Steve noticed Tony had on his favorite red satin robe, which meant he was naked underneath. Tony loved the feeling of the robe all over his bare skin.
Getting in a tiff with Steve was one thing, seeing Steve rip a log in half with his bare hands was another. It triggered his flight or fight response, which was oddly arousing. The physical power this man had juxtaposed with the sleeping beauty only hours before...how could Tony not be in love?
He was truly happy for his friend, even though it made him feel all the more lonely. Tony thought about his own experience in loving a god. He never understood how he hooked Steve either.
Suddenly Steve walked out of the room before Tony could argue. Well how did he fuck that up so royally?
Closing his eyes, Bucky pulled out the plug in one quick motion and tossed it aside. Shoving in two fingers immediately, he thrust them in and out, sometimes scissoring them apart to show how open and loose he was. That drove Steve crazy, his cock was already beginning to stir. He loved when Bucky was ready for him to shove inside.
In the irony of ironies, the fate of the world depended on him calling Steve and all he could do was stare dumbly at the screen. As menacing aliens crashed down into New York City, again, he couldn't call in Captain America.
“Yeah, Buck, keep going.” Steve said, entranced by Bucky’s cock sliding on him. “Do you like fucking my tits?”
Totally jealous, Tony could tell by the clenching and unclenching of Steve’s jaw, which he only did when he was agitated. Interesting.
On the trip back, Tony was able to jury rig the communicator on the ship to get in touch Bruce. They shared their stories of unprecedented loss. Bruce listed of the names of their friends that disappeared like a grocery list, shock still not worn off.
Scissoring Steve open had them both panting with need. Just for good measure, Tony slid a third finger in. Steve thrust down on to him, yeah he was ready.
The corridor is long, it stretches off into the darkness; there are no lights, well there are some, but the bulbs are completely gone, they would be no help to him at all. Tony thanks himself that he installed night vision into the suit. He’s humming some random song to himself as he sets off, checking behind him now and then. Doors line the corridor; they are solid steel though they are rusty they look strong still, their frames provide a small amount of cover, enough for someone clad in black to jump out from behind them.
“Alright,” Steve says as he slams his shield into one of the lizard’s neck, “Iron Man I want you to get Hawkeye to the top of that building over there, Widow stick with me I want to use protocol one eight three nine. Bruce hang back we don’t need the green guy just yet. Thor, you can just do your thing. Flacon, can you assist Iron Man with air support.” He pauses glancing around the streets, the team shifts into action, they might joke about like kids when they can, but when it comes to the wire, Steve can count on them.
Bucky raises his eyebrow, willing himself to hide his feelings deep down, “and what way would that be?” He laughs, trying to play it off for cool and collected, but it comes out as nervous and unsure instead. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Tony-“ Bucky is panicking, thoughts are going through his head at three million miles an hour, he wants to assure Tony that he’s not going to do anything, but Tony just pats him on the back shaking his head.
“Yeah, it’s definitely six,” Tony’s starting to get little worried, “they were supposed to be back in an hour, right? We decided that Peter wasn't going to wear himself out before school, right?”
“Ms Romanov is currently in her room,” JARVIS answers, “she is not asleep, would you like me to inform her of the situation.”
“Yeah, yes,” Steve nods and smiles. He watches as Tony stands, he can visibly see him pulling himself together; the things that make up Tony Stark slowly knitting together again.
“What?” Steve mumbles into Tony’s hair, his muscles flexing one by one beneath Tony. “No one’s come or gone, Tony, are you sure it's six?” Tony can see them by the light of his arc reactor that Steve’s eyes aren't open; that he’s wearing a frown that speaks of him just waking up.
“Can we come back now?” Clint pops his round the door, “also why are my twitter notifications off? Do you have something to do with this, Stark?”
“Right, back to work then,” Rhodey groans aiming the gun on the back of his suit down the corridor in front of them as Tony looks up, one eye on the scan that JARVIS is completing.
“Don’t have to do anything, nothing, I don’t want anything,” Tony shakes his head, he’s acutely aware of how close Bucky is to him. They’re only a few centimetres apart, and Steve is a substantial barrier at his back; Tony can’t move anywhere, not with his workbench pressed up against his left hip and Steve’s arm wrapped around his right. He’s not panicking, JARVIS would have warned him if he were, but his brain can’t catch the train of his thoughts, and his breathing is fast. Tony knows that his heart is pumping out a quick staccato rhythm, but he’s too caught up in the electric grey-blue of Bucky’s eyes.
“Right, that means Cap’ll be up, good, okay,” Tony nods absently and starts to head towards the common room. “I should probably let someone know I’m alive,” Tony mutters before walking down the corridor.
“Don’t get your panties in a twist, Barnes, we’ll work something out.” Tony stands up straight, from where he was hunched over Bucky’s shoulder. “Now, where did I stick that non-mechanical prosthetic…” He turns to a shelf that has a whole load of stuff on it, Bucky thinks he can see several different repulsers for Tony’s suit hit the floor before Tony pulls out an arm that looks just like any other prosthesis. “Here! The only difference between this and the arms they give you at the hospital is that this is made out of carbon fiber and vibranium, so like it’s pretty much indestructible, and I even painted a little “A” logo on the shoulder for you! It should just…” Tony walks over to Bucky, and slots the arm on to his shoulder. “Clip in like that, nice to know that works, I’ve never made anything like this so.”
“Yes,” Steve knows now, that this child, Peter, is worth his life. “Of course. But Tony, we aren’t the most normal family are we?”
Steve and Bucky are standing in the doorway, waiting for Tony before they leave. Tony walks towards them; his face has lost the stressed pinched look that it had worn when Bucky had first entered the room. He smiles tiredly at them before nodding his head in the direction of the living room, one eyebrow raised in question. Bucky looks at Steve, a conversation happening between all three of them, completely silently. Steve shrugs and heads on over to the large communal living area; it’s set out over multiple floors, each with various doors and halls leading off it. In the very centre of it all is a platform with sofas and cosy armchairs. Bucky immediately falls into the high-backed, deep winged armchair; Steve collapses on one of the couches, he doesn't try and contain his surprise when Tony sits on the same one, resting his feet in Steve’s lap. Bucky grins and winks at Steve who blushes deeply from ear to ear, rolling his eyes at Bucky.
“I know, Cap, I get it.” Tony shakes his head, “Tony Stark shouldn't be a father. Peter’s mom thought so too. Well, maybe I don’t find myself hating the idea, maybe I want to be a dad to this kid. Maybe, I could be.” Tony is muttering like Steve isn’t there, he is completely in his head. He looks up at Steve with pure determination in his eyes. “I’ll take him, if we don’t find his aunt and uncle, I’ll take him.”
“‘M not sure I can handle so much talkin’,” Bucky mumbles, though the vodka has no effect on him he’s starting to feel sleepy like time has slowed and he’s already dreaming.
“This okay, right?” Bucky pulls back, looking at Steve, “We’re okay, yeah?” One of Bucky’s hands is tangled in his hair, and the other is on his shoulder.
“I guess, I don’t want to remember if I did something horrible,” Peter sighs, he shivers a little, “But I do want to know some things, I feel like there’s a gap in my head. I know time has passed, but I can’t see myself as part of it.”
“I remember,” Steve nods, “we talked about how we’d use our army pay to go there when we got back to New York. It was like the biggest thing around town, this fancy Manhattan burger place that served the best burgers in the whole city. Most of the food I ate was boiled, and then there was this diner that served fried things, I was so mad that it opened when I was in France.” He laughs, running a hand through his hair.
“Now is a very good time to tell me that,” Tony laughs, stealing another kiss; Steve mentally amends his earlier thoughts. This is the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen, Tony’s lips are red, his hair is mussed from where Steve’s hands have ended up in it, and there’s a slight flush spreading across his cheeks.
“I missed mom though; she never did anything like what my dad did.” Tony says, “she would always pick me up after a bad encounter with Howard.” Tony sighs he’s still crying. “I guess seeing Peter in there reminded me of what I never had. It was horrible because he had it, with May and Ben, and now he doesn't and all he’s left with it me. A father, he never knew, with some pretty serious daddy issues himself. What kind of life can I give him?”
“Come on, Peter, let's get you back to your dad, yeah?” Clint taps Peter’s shoulder to set him going in the right direction, “keep in touch on the coms, Cap, if there’s any trouble. Tell Tony we’re coming in.”
“We could,” Bucky says, he says them like they’re a secret, passed only between the three of them; his tone is quiet and soft, almost cautious. Tony finds that he likes the tone, it sends something through him, straight to his core.
“You don’t have to replace them, Tony, you just have to be there for Peter. He’s always going to miss them, of course, he is, and you’re not ever going to replace them. That’s something you really need to come to terms with. But what you are going to do is you are going to be a father to Peter, you’re going to make him better when he’s sick, you’re going to help him with his science fair projects, you’re going to help him through breakups with friends and partners, you’re going to take embarrassing photos of him before his prom. You’re going to cook him dinner and take him to the movies, and you are always going to be there for him.” Steve smiles, “you don’t need to replace May and Ben, you just need to be you, and that’s it.” Steve looks up at Bucky, blue eyes wide, the light shining in them; Bucky nods, and smiles at Tony.
“It wasn't any trouble, honestly,” Tony shakes his head, he looks tired and a little worn out, but his face is warm and open as he gives Steve a smile. “We should probably head out pretty soon though. Not before I’ve given Bucky his new arm; I wanna see his face when he sees the paint job.”
There is a child sitting bolt upright in bed in the guest room, tears and snot dripping down his chin. Bucky can see even in the low light that the kid looks just like Tony; this child must be the reason for the Avengers’ latest impromptu trip to Düsseldorf, the one he’d been prevented from going on. This must have been the kid that Pepper had ushered out from the main tower before Bucky had had the chance to see him. Stark is already in the room, pulling the kid into his arms, making soft hushing noises.
“Mr- Mr- Mr Stark? Please, you gotta let me in!” The boy says, “you gotta let me in!” Peter is wearing an old hoodie, and torn up jeans; he looks like he hasn't slept in a week, he has various bits of garden stuck in his hair.
Don't forget that I have a marvel tumblr if you want to come and yell at me on there: wxntxr-sxldxxr
“You’re right,” Steve nods, following Bucky out the room, “I’m going to tell him tonight. Thanks, Buck, you always know how to make me feel better.” Steve slings his arm around Bucky’s shoulders; Bucky tries to stop himself from falling apart.
“I can walk on it fine, there’s no pain, it just twinges every now and then,” Peter says, looking at the doctor steadily.
“Yeah,” Peter’s voice is quiet, tension leaks through the words as he says them, “there was one other thing, after that, they knocked me about a bit, but nothing really hurt that much. They made me run up the walls and stick to the ceiling, then they pulled me down again; I think I sprained my ankle when that happened. Not sure.” Tony can see him getting antsy, there’s a tight set nature to his shoulders, and his hands are starting to fiddle with the hospital gown.
“What happened to us?” Peter asks again, and now Tony knows that there is no running and hiding from this problem, not when it involves his son. Tony runs his hands through Peter’s hair, feeling the soft, clean strands underneath; he’s missed the feeling of holding his kid in his arms.
“Got any lovin’ for me?” Rhodey asks, taking Tony away from Pepper, “it’s not every day your best friend gets engaged. Never thought I’d see the day that someone managed to tie you down, Tones,” Rhodey is laughing as he gives Tony a hug; Tony can see over his shoulder that Steve is getting a clap on the back and firm handshake from Bruce and Bucky is getting a cautious hug from Natasha.
“I wanted to talk to you, котенок,” Natasha gives him an easy smile, dropping into the armchair he salvaged from a purge of living room furniture Tony had a week ago. “I see the way you look at them; I know that look.”
“Who even says rapscallion, anymore?” Peter mumbles, Tony high-fives him with a proud smile plastered across his face.
A knock at the door startled him, part of him forgot he was at the compound and not the tower so other people were actually around.
When he was about two feet away from Tony, Steve pivoted his weight forward onto his arms, lifting his legs straight into the air.
Slicking his cock with the remaining lube, Tony resisted the sudden urge to beat himself off all over the other man.
The bar was small and crowded with people. It was just full enough to detract any unwanted attention from the two large blonde men in the corner. Steve enjoyed the average joe feel of the evening. Well, as average as a night can be for a super soldier and a god. They drank pitchers of beer while Steve tried to explain the wonder of baseball.
Stretching out his right hand, Tony reached for the nightstand drawer. Lube, they desperately needed lube. Fumbling for a moment, his fingers closed around the familiar bottle shape. Removing one of Steve's caressing hands, Tony shoved the bottle into it, trying to illustrate what the next step was going to be.
Watching his cock slide in and out of this man, this god, this hero who Tony just made cum against a fucking workbench...that was it.
“Can I come in?” Steve asked, the weight of the universe in his voice. That fucking voice, it undid Tony just like it always had.
“Pony” was blasting through the speakers of his workshop, the windows were blacked out, the door was locked, and he and Steve were alone. This had to be a dream.
The next morning Steve told him all about Bucky. Who he was, what he was to Steve...obviously something Tony could never be...and that he was searching for him.
“If you keep that up,” Tony said. “You are going to have to lay me across and do it for real, big man. No more teasing.”
As Steve stroked himself, ever so slowly, watching Tony through his lashes, Tony shoved a second finger in his hole.
Holding Bucky’s hips, Steve pushed Bucky into Tony in one smooth thrust. The two dark haired men moaned loudly. Still holding on, Steve slid himself into Bucky the same way. Growling through his teeth, Steve didn’t let Bucky have much time before he started to fuck him.
Standing up Steve fully removed the shirt and pants that still clung to him. By the looks on their faces he knew they were ready for more. Tony looked like a kid on Christmas and Bucky was doing that thing where his mouth was neutral but his eyes were all lit up for Steve. He couldn’t help himself then, he kissed each one of them sweetly, trying to show them how much he loved them.
As if to demonstrate, Steve wrapped his fingers around his own cock and jerks himself at a steady pace.
It was kind of strange seeing him like this. Occasionally they had worked together or discussed the mission recently yet they were never really alone together, not like this. Everything had been very professional, maybe some friendly banter, no fighting or blowouts. It was as if they ensured other people were always in the room. It kept them in check, for better or for worse. Although, even if the room was packed with people, he felt the space and tension between them, like an invisible tripwire.
“Goddamnit!” Bucky yelled as cum shot all over Steve’s chest and neck. “Steve you have no filter and I fucking love it.”
“I didn't think, you know me, I just gotta do what I gotta do.” Tony tried to joke but it fell flat.
Their eyes met, then they were kissing again, as if their lives depended on it. Oxygen didn't matter anymore, just inhaling the other man, that's all he needed.
Glaring at him, Tony remained silent for the rest of the movie. Although he did have to bite his tongue over the “Closer” scene since Steve would probably call him a perv or ask what kind of person enjoys being tied up.
“That’s a silly question.” Tony said as he reluctantly pulled away from Steve to search through the drawers of his work table.
Breaking his silence Bucky moans almost as loud as Tony, like he just came. Steve knew Bucky loved when they came on him but not quite enough to completely lose it himself.
Breaking the kiss, Tony did as he was told and Bucky’s pants joined Tony’s robe. Expecting Bucky to be nude also, Steve was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. Against Bucky’s flawless skin was a pair of black lace panties. Those booty short kind that did very little to hide his luscious ass or the swell of his hardening cock. They had discussed lingerie before but it was much different seeing it in reality.
Biting his lip Bucky all but jogged to Steve. He leaned over Steve bringing their lips together. It was sweet and calm, as they mapped each other's mouths like they had so many times before.
Running his fingers through the mess he made, Bucky picked up as much cum as he could and shoved it in Steve’s mouth. Steve sucked them clean and Bucky gave him more. He was in a lustful daze, taking in as much as could. Steve closed his eyes, letting taste and feel wash over him.
Steve’s movements are fluid. When he runs it is like water flowing effortlessly over the rocks. Tony could write novels just on the way he moves. Even he, the master engineer, could not craft something so flawless.
That’s when Steve got the joke, Bucky had a sizable plug shoved in his ass. Oh yeah, these two were so innocent when left alone for too long, they could not be trusted.
That was too much for Steve, Tony’s debauched face, Bucky’s defiled hand, the vice around his dick. He was done for. The force it hit him with caused his vision to white out and he pumped everything from the bottom of his toes up, into Bucky.
Not waiting for a reply, Tony ripped his shirt off, exposing the complicated mess of scars the arc reactor had left behind.
“I'm sure that gets them in a tizzy too.” Tony said. Steve looked good in anything and who didn't have even a slight uniform fetish, especially when it came to Captain America?
Tony looked at the painting and it took a moment to process. It was stunning and expertly done, where it appeared more like a photograph than a painting, yet somehow more alive. It was the subject matter that left him…
Pepper knew he always had it. She probably knew he was clutching it in his pocket when he had proposed to her. It was something they didn't talk about, better to pretend it wasn't there.
But it did happen because he had felt Steve against him. Felt the relief and the lust and the love washing through him. After that he noticed, maybe, possibly, Steve watched him and cared for Tony like the old man did for no one else.
An explosion came through Clint's earpiece as he said "I know. What number monster are we on for this week? Five? Six?"
Snarling mockingly when the snow clump hit him square in the chest he gave chase. Peter yelped floundering through the snow in an attempt to get enough momentum to swing from tree to tree. Together they raced through the dark, silent forest until they looped back to the cabin. Bucky ran inside and dug out his mitt and wore out baseball from where he had stashed it in his bag. It was always a sure-fire way of tiring the pup out when running him just didn't seem to be cutting it.
They moved on heading down in the canyon. The trail was wide enough for two to walk side by side at first but it progressively got narrower as they continued down till they reached a point where they had to go single file. The ground was slightly dampened from the now melted snow but the air was still crisp and a slight breeze blew down the canyon cooling the sweat on their necks as it formed.
Later, when the early birds of the pack began to stir, it was very much apparent that Steve would not be joining them in helping make breakfast. At least not without prying himself away from a very cuddly Tony who was currently starfished onto him and having no intention of letting go any time soon.
A yelp drew Tony’s attention to where Peter was glaring at Natasha rubbing his backside as if he had been swatted by the older omega.
Clicking her tongue as she looked through the bags of food they had brought with them “Clint?” She asked looking up to see the archer starting on a pot of coffee
Sam followed, choosing not to comment when he saw Clint slip a twenty to Natasha upon Peter walking into the room. He had decided long ago that some things were better not to ask about.
The smell of fresh pancakes and friendly banter eventually managed to rouse the rest of the pack. Sam, surprisingly, managed to pull himself out of bed just as Buck was finishing off the last of the batter flipping the final pancake expertly through the air and onto the towering pile on the table.
Peter pulled out his boots and looked them over. They were also a light grey that matched with his bag. They were made of waterproof material so he wouldn’t have to worry about his feet getting wet and they would be easy to clean should they get dirty. Having tried them on Peter found them to be his exact size as well as very comfortable. It felt as though he were walking on clouds.
Bucky hummed as he made himself a mug of coffee “More than average.” He shot a teasing look at Natasha “Losing your edge, Widow?”
Peter grinned triumphantly at the older omega who was screwing the cap back onto the container and putting it back into the fridge.
“Then yeah. You are. Now if you’ll excuse me I have a date with some pancakes.”Peter sassed, wiggling out of Steve’s arms and sitting down at his seat in between Tony and Natasha. Picking up his knife and fork and looking at Steve expectantly; waiting for him to sit before he started like the good pup that he was.
“Yeah, I had JARVIS look it up, it’s not even far from here; I don’t know if you Brooklyn boys would have actually gone there, and it’s had a name change since but hey, it’s supposed to be good.” Tony wraps an arm around Steve’s waist, looking up at him with his big, beautiful brown eyes; Steve is so caught up in them that the whole world seems to halt for a second. “I heard they do the best chicken quesadilla in Manhattan-“
“Fuck off Barton,” Bucky rolls his eyes, “Tony wants you to watch Peter tonight, he’s going out for burgers with Steve and I. And hot pockets are not food.”
“Coulson, Nat, I got something,” he grimaces because he knows exactly what he’s looking at, he’s seen them before. It's a mark that’s been carved into the wood, and it’s supposed to tell everyone in the business who killed the man in front of them. “You seen this one before?” He asks Natasha, because if anyone is going to know this assassin’s mark then it's going to be Tasha.
