against an angry alpha.
Jarvis snorted, unimpressed. “Ana knows she can’t cook. That’s why I do it.”
Victor swiveled around to scowl at her. “And why didn’t you?!”
“I’ll run you a hot bath,” Ana added.
Ezekiel jerked him back towards him, smile going mean around the edges. “Tony, come on. You’ve missed two parties. I can’t have my fiancée turn down a dance with me when we’re finally at a party together. People will talk.”
He should have asked for Jarvis to be his guardian. Jarvis knew him, knew what he was thinking and feeling, without even having to say a word. Jarvis was better to him than even his own father had been.
Tony’s heart warmed. She really was much too generous. “Actually, I was just going to ask to use your address as my return address for all of the letters that I’m going to send out in response to all of these marriage ads Ana has found for me.”
“You okay, Tony?” Jan asked, voice muffled.
Hank came to stand by him, likely to avoid Jan making him try on perfume himself. “Are you alright? Do you need to sit down?”
It was beautiful.
Tony stared at her, brows furrowed together. “I—I don’t… know?”
“Come on,” Reed said again, tugging on him, and he stumbled a little before finally matching his pace. Reed had his own motorcar. Tony didn’t know where they were going, but at least it was away.
Jan smiled, letting out a wet laugh. “So what are you going to do now?”
“My name is Anthony St—ah,” Tony cut himself off. “Um. I actually prefer Tony. I’m Tony… von Doom?” The name felt strange on his tongue. It was one thing to put that on a telegram to cause confusion if anyone came looking for him, but quite another to introduce himself to another person like that. Victor had looked unbothered by the idea when Jan had suggested it though (had actually looked rather pleased with her idea), so he figured the fib wasn’t too bad.
“Hey,” the beta ahead of him said around the crunch of an apple.
him. He just… very much liked the idea of him. So if Steve… If Steve had decided that they weren’t a good match after Tony’s admissions, he’d accept it. He’d just mourn the idea of Steve and make sure to take extra good care of the drawings he’d been given.
“Why don’t we give Anthony some privacy,” Ana suggested suddenly, making him jump.
“…I’ll get my coat,” Tony said weakly.
Victor looked embarrassed as he tried to shrug it off. “I’m glad I could help,” he said softly, apparently unable to dodge his thanks anymore.
“…You… could… dab a little perfume on the letter,” Jarvis said, like every word hurt him.
Hank was overjoyed when he learned that he didn’t have to go to Susan’s party. Tony was pretty sure he was so happy that he could have dropped to one knee and actually proposed then and there except then Jan would have told him no for being so completely unromantic. So instead he just happily let Jan drag them around the department store, holding each and every bag and box she was given as she purchased things.
Jan pursed her lips at him, entirely unamused, then opened the telegram to read it. “Honestly, Tony, it’s not that funny—” She stopped, frowning in confusion, before reaching out and grabbing his wrist. “Tony.”
Tony snatched it from her with trembling fingers and looked at the return address, shoulders falling in relief when he saw Steve’s name. He slit the envelope open quickly and pulled the letter out.
“Oh, well, he’s not really—” Tony began, then stopped, thoughtful. He’d
“Oh, um.” Tony looked down at his feet, then back up at Steve. “That sounds fantastic, actually.” He glanced back at the wagon, frowning. “Will my things be alright?”
“That’s so romantic,” Jan sighed, smiling, and picked a chunk of apple out of her punch to pop into her mouth. “It’s not fair. All of these older people have such sweet stories of meeting their partners in Europe, and we got stuck here with the Stanes.”
“Sweetheart,” Tony whispered, blushing. Steve had called him ‘sweetheart.’ How… how
“Thanks,” Tony said, glancing at the walls of the trunk he was going to be closed inside of.
Tony sobbed into his shoulder, clinging to the beta’s shirt. “I don’t even know how to cook, Jarvis! What do I
“Mail call!” Jan shouted gleefully as she pranced into the kitchen with the letters held triumphantly above her head, then paused, hand slowly sinking until the letters were pressed to her chest. “Oh. Am I interrupting something?”
he’s called me ‘Janice’ in writing?!” Jan exclaimed irritably.
Her hands were shaking. Tony didn’t mention it, because his were shaking too. “Thanks.”
“I’m not your fiancée,” Tony whispered harshly. “And you’re not mine. Take your hands off of me at once. You have no right to be so familiar with me.”
It took a moment for the haze of anger to pass, and for Tony to realize what he’d said, and for him to notice how quiet it had gotten around him. He turned his head a little, mortified when he saw all of the other partygoers staring at him in shock. He looked back up at Ezekiel, terrified. Ezekiel still looked angry, but he also looked stunned, as if Tony had slapped him, his grip on his shoulders going lax.
Tony didn’t grab for her again, but only barely, instead murmuring a shy, “Sorry…”
“Oh! Please be gentle with my trunks! Someone’s already cracked my dress form!” Jan said, not sounding even slightly upset like she had when she’d been stopped outside her home.
Jan looked down at him again, concerned, and said, “You know you can say anything to me, or ask me anything, and I won’t be upset.”
“You really are a small town,” Tony said, not quite managing to keep some of the ruefulness out of his tone as Steve offered him his arm again. He curled his fingers around his forearm and reminded himself that squeezing Steve’s arm to feel his muscles would be inappropriate, considering they’d literally just met in person. “I guess I wasn’t quite sure what that meant until I got here.”
“Tony!” Jan exclaimed excitedly, throwing her arms around his neck. “Tony, he wants to marry you!”
Jarvis pulled away from Tony, blinking back his tears quickly, and sniffed once. Then he was all business again, helping Ana button Tony’s coat and then lifting one of the bags to put into Tony’s hands. “Unfortunately, I couldn’t fit anything of much value in these.”
address to an alpha he technically didn’t have ties to.
Tony turned from the table, glass in each hand, going up on his tiptoes to look for Jan. Both she and Raven were petite, and he was almost certain that Raven’s beau Max had abandoned the two omegas to their chat, so he couldn’t even depend on his height to find them in the crowd. He resolved to scold Max about this later. He was sure Max would get a kick out of it.
“I know,” Tony whispered, reaching out for her, and she came into his arms immediately, burying her face in his chest to sob into it. “I know.”
“You like that he likes ants,” Tony pointed out.
Tony put off writing to Steve by responding to all of his other suitors first, telling them that he was sorry, but he’d found a spouse, and he hoped there were no hard feelings. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to write to Steve—he just… didn’t know what to say. He wanted to write back that he’d be on the first train to Timely as soon as he could manage, that he would marry him at the train depot if Steve could get the preacher there, that he was excited to get away from New York and to Steve—
Tony doubted they would hurt Jarvis too much, but he hurriedly snatched them from her grasp anyway. It would be just their luck if Jarvis got a nasty paper cut to the face. “Thank you for your help. I’m sure they’re fine now.”
“He calls you that in person, so I’m not surprised,” Tony replied, reading over the telegram again and ignoring the way she squawked in outrage. God, it had probably cost more than the groceries Ana and Jarvis bought for the week. He read it a third time, just to be sure, before looking back up at Jan and frowning. “How is this helping me?”
“I will make him eat his own hands,” Jan cut in.
Dinner was another quiet affair. Jarvis had tried to set the food out on the table, but Tony still didn’t want to be alone, so he and Ana just quietly carried the food back into the kitchen to place it on the island and sit on the stools there. It felt better in the kitchen, homier and more intimate. Even his dinners in the dining room with his parents had always held some air of isolation.
“Is this all?” Steve asked.
Tony sat up immediately and wrapped his arms around her neck with a relieved sob. “
He flinched as the trunk was slammed shut, yelping into his hands again when it was tossed carelessly back into the car. Luckily it couldn’t be heard over the sound of Vernon yelling, “Get her to the station
“…Do you have bittersweet memories, Ana?” Tony asked softly.
Tony laughed and then laughed harder when Jarvis tried to scold him some more.
“I can’t say that for sure, Tony, but I can tell you this—Steve’s been alone for a very long time,” Jim told him gently. “It’s like he was a jigsaw piece, and no one ever really matched up. During my visit, everyone in town was talking about how he’d been smiling more. I think he needed someone entirely different from who people thought he needed—someone soft to temper his hard edges, or someone who would always anticipate his needs so he could relax more. I’m an outsider, of course, so I can’t be entirely sure that I knew more than anyone else, but looking at him… he just needed someone who would take him as he was, and would insist that he take them as they are, too.”
“If Ezekiel touches you at any party while you are wearing my clothes,” Jan said, voice devoid of all emotion. “I will cut off his hands and make him eat them.” She leaned in very close to Tony’s face and whispered, “And I will tell him that.”
“It is poor manners to run outside screaming about your engagement,” Jarvis said mildly as he picked up the empty coffee-cup from beside Tony’s elbow. “Steve gets a pass because he has no neighbors to wake.”
Ana blinked up at him, surprised, then leaned in to press her face against his neck and breathe. “Edwin…”
There was no reason to prolong his misery. He’d need to decide soon anyway.
Hank stared at him. “…What does that mean?”
Jan looked like she was seriously considering grabbing one of the decorative pillows off the couch and smothering him with it. “Tony!”
“Everything is moving too quickly,” Tony whispered, knuckles white, then turned his head to hide his face in his pillow.
Mr. Jarvis’s tea,” Jan sniffed. She snatched up the tray of bread and jam too. “And I’m going to snoop through what you’ve been reading about.”
“You’ve always been so brave,” Jan whispered, and leaned their heads together again. “I hope you’ll be happy, Tony.”
Ana blinked slowly, then let out a bark of laughter when she realized what he’d asked. “Ha! No. The shop owner thought that I’d bribed Edwin with my feminine wiles.”
Tony ran to Jarvis immediately, throwing his arms around him, and didn’t care that Reed was there to see it. “Jarvis!”
Tony entertained the idea for a moment before dropping it, sighing. He needed to be realistic. Even if having Jan murder him would solve a lot of his problems, it would just cause a bunch of new ones. For both of them. “No, you can’t have him murdered.”
“I am being quite reasonable,” Jarvis said. He grabbed the bottle of bourbon on the way out.
She smiled sadly and whispered, “Too many to count,” before she gave him one last kiss on the cheek and took her leave of him.
“Take that awful shirt off and try on this one,” she ordered, tossing a shirt over the screen at him.
horrified. Why do you continue to do this to yourself?”
Instead, he straightened his shoulders and walked down the steps from the mansion, silently getting into Reed’s car, careful to keep his head high and face forward. He would do this last thing Jarvis had asked of him. He would not look back. Not when Jarvis could see him doing it.
“Oh, pish posh,” Jan cut in, waving him away. “You know each other well enough. It’s not like I was going to sit in your lap anyway, Hank.”
Tony frowned, brows furrowing together as he read through all of the ads. “I—I don’t know, Ana, this all seems so—so childish. It feels like running away.”
.-.-.-.
“I think,” Jan finally said slowly. “That this is the only option you have with the lot you’ve been given. Your father always decided no one was ever good enough for the Stark name, so you decided not to sign it in your correspondence. And Obadiah has taken your fortune, so you’ve had to learn to make do without it or marry a sorry excuse for an alpha. I think… I think this is your right thing. The only thing you can do to make your life yours. The only thing you can do to make yourself happy.” She smiled, but there were tears threatening to spill from her eyes as she did. “I think you should choose to be happy. You could be happy with this Steve. You could learn to love him. I don’t think you could learn to love Ezekiel Stane.”
“The best cake,” Tony repeated wonderingly. He hadn’t gotten to learn to make pound cake for Steve. Steve had said he’d teach him himself, but he’d really wanted to learn it before. Maybe someone there would be willing to teach him?
“You could even add just a little dab of perfume to the letters to really get your potential beaus riled up,” Ana added.
Steve, to his credit, took some time to mull the information over. “And you’re afraid that I’ll think… what,” he finally asked, frowning in confusion. “Nothing you’ve said makes me think any less of you, Tony, and it doesn’t make me doubt any of your feelings. You just gave me this letter that you wrote on the train,” he added, holding the letter up in one hand, as if Tony needed the visual evidence. “Do you expect me to believe that your thoughts and feelings are fake in this? In any of your letters?”
Tony paused in refolding the letter, then smoothed it back open, frowning. It really was so impersonal. He hoped Steve wouldn’t be offended. He really was just trying to protect himself. He was pretty sure that Steve would respect that. Steve seemed like the kind of alpha who would want someone to be safe and happy. Tony stared at the letter a little longer. Perhaps Jan was right. Maybe he did know Steve better than he thought.
“S-sir,” the officer replied, and Tony swallowed back another yelp when they yanked their hand back and nearly tore his shirt off with it.
“HA!” Jan snorted, pointing at him, then ducked her head demurely when Jarvis shot her a look. “I mean. Oops. Bad luck, Tony.”
Tony trusted her judgment and did not pick the letter up. Jan was good at reading people. “Obadiah might get suspicious of you coming around so much,” he said after some thought. “If it’s not too much trouble, would you mind separating them from the next batch though?”
Tony huffed but changed into the red slacks, too. “Listen, just because you want to single-handedly bring culture to America through fashion doesn’t mean I’m always going to be your stupid dress-up doll,” he complained, taking the matching red jacket she threw over at him and putting it on as well. “I can’t even pay you properly. Obadiah thinks it’s frivolous, and I honestly have so many other things to pay for with my allowance that I can’t feel guilty about this too—”
bold.
“Ana!” Jarvis gasped, scandalized, as his wife began to laugh, then turned to Tony sharply. “You are not riling anybody up, young man!”
“And that you were raised by some dear family friends,” Steve agreed, nodding.
Tony felt his smile freeze on his face. He hadn’t realized it would be that much. He took out the money purse Victor had given him. He wondered if he’d even have enough to pay for third class seats. He opened the purse and looked inside, mouth dropping open.
“It’s not fair,” Jan whispered helplessly. “He has to leave everything he’s ever known to be happy. He has to leave you and Mr. Jarvis. He has to leave
Tony sat up straighter at the thought. “Oh!” That would be nice. Steve might even be pleasantly surprised.
Steve be okay with that? He was inviting another alpha to their home even before they’d married. But then… if he told Steve what had happened, surely he’d agree? Steve had seemed like the type to repay a debt. And Jim hadn’t made any advances toward him at all, so if he just told Steve that, he’d probably be relieved enough to allow it. “I don’t think Steve would mind,” he finally decided, then frowned when he noticed that Jim had stopped walking and was staring at him with the queerest look on his face. “Jim?”
Tony felt his shoulders relax at the assurance. He clasped his hands together and couldn’t help smiling up at Jim. “Oh, do you really think so? He won’t be disappointed?”
Jan was supposed to make his wedding clothes, and they’d pick out a dress for her as his maid of honor, and she’d violently elbow her competition out of the way when he threw his bouquet. Now he was on a train to Chicago, where he’d find out if he could go to Steve or if he needed to wait. He was alone, with only his two carpet bags, his gifted trunk, and the little satchel of money that Victor had pressed into his hands before he'd stepped off the train. He couldn’t even reach out when he arrived at his final destination to tell the people he loved that he was safe. They’d all have to sit there, wondering if he’d made it, wondering if he was safe and happy, and he couldn’t alleviate any of their worry for his own safety.
Tony tipped his head back to look up at him, pleasantly surprised. “You remember what I said in my first letter? Steve, that was so long ago!”
Jan burst out, and began to laugh.
Steve took it between careful fingers, flipping it over to rip it open. Tony couldn’t help but smile a little at the thought of Steve doing this every time he got one of his letters, ripping them open to read as soon as he got them.
Tony let out a reluctant huff of laughter. “Really?”
And it probably wasn’t, to him, which made it all the more important to them.
“Jarvis,” Tony whispered, swallowing thickly.
Tony frowned, pulling his finger out of his mouth just long enough to mumble, “I wouldn’t want to put Hank out…”
“Are we really going to be late?” Tony asked, concerned.
protective of him. And he’d never thought that on the day he married, he wouldn’t have Jan at his side.
Tony blushed a little. “Oh, uh—I—well, the circumstances were—”
“Thank you again, Victor, for all of your help,” Jan said softly, taking his hand.
,” Tony told her sincerely. He knew they were friends, and that Jan loved him, but he thought it was nice to tell her how much she meant to him sometimes.
Tony turned to look at him. “Well clearly I can’t have all the letters sent here. Someone would tell Obadiah about my influx of—”
“Well, Reed had mentioned it was only a matter of time before the Stanes got their hands on you, so I decided not to let them have any time at all. Besides, the Stanes already believe I’m a shallow idiot,” Victor sniffed. “Just because I wouldn’t allow myself to be bored by the younger Stane, somehow I’m the problem and not him. Americans are quite boorish, aren’t they!”
Tony nodded, trying to keep his head from swiveling around too much as he took in everything. The town really was just one road leading up to the railroad platform and back out to the prairie. “If I was going to California, I’d probably stop here just to stretch my legs and avoid getting too cramped on the Pullman car,” he agreed, eyes lingering on the general store. Steve had said some of his friends owned it. Then again, if the town was this small, and Steve was as gregarious as he claimed, he was probably friends with every store owner. “It’s very pretty,” he added belatedly, because there were flowerboxes on all of the windows, and the storefronts were all well-kempt and clean.
“No trouble at all. I actually made a chart with all the names,” Jan admitted, blushing. “Sometimes when I’m getting really frustrated with a design, I organize your letters.”
“Timely?” Jim repeated, sounding amused. “I’ve been there a few times visiting a friend. It’s… nice enough, I suppose.”
At least this way he had a choice.
“Hush, Edwin,” she said, getting up from her seat and hurrying over to the drawer where she kept her envelope for her niece. “You married me because you knew I was wild enough to smooth your square edges.” She pulled out the envelope and peeked inside it. There were at least a dozen ads in it, and she was certain she could find more if she looked hard enough with someone else in mind. “And I’ve got just the idea to get our sweet Anthony if not his money, then to safety.”
“Right,” Steve answered hurriedly. “Right, of course, I just—” He leaned his face in his hand and made a noise that sounded a lot like a squeak. “Oh God and you’re right here and you’re seeing me react to one of your letters. You’re seeing how I reacted to all of your other ones. Oh God.”
part. He was not that kind of beta.
Tony tilted his head, frowning. “Is it okay that we’re leaving it here longer, then?”
“How many times do I have to do this?” Tony asked, grunting with the effort of pushing the dough back out.
But he also wanted to appear… calm. And collected. Even if he also wanted to run outside and shout, “Steve wants to marry me!” So he got all his nerves and excitement out by calmly and gently breaking it to his other suitors that he was now affianced so would have to end their courtships, and telling the select few that he’d made a connection with that if they weren’t too terribly hurt by his rejection, he’d still like to correspond with them. He could understand if they wanted to cease contact though. They’d started correspondence with the expectation that they might marry him.
Steve reached across the table and took his hand before he could stop himself. “Tony, all you just told me was how strong you were to escape all that and leave the only support you had behind. Of
“I’ll have Johnny and Ben keep Reed occupied so we can gossip freely,” Susan offered.
an alpha, but… he
“I’m serious,” Steve began.
Tony was able to beg off attending two more parties with the Stanes, but eventually, a party was scheduled that he actually wanted to go to. Susan Storm was hosting, and he loved Susan. He didn’t quite understand why she was allowing herself to be courted by Reed Richards, of course, but he supposed Reed must have some sort of redeeming quality. (He and Jan couldn’t think of one, but Susan wasn’t stupid, and her little brother Johnny was very protective of her and didn’t mind Reed too much; not to mention, Reed’s friend Ben was a doll. Clearly there was something about him they liked.)
Well, he’d soon learn, he decided. And he’d do his best to make Jan proud. Jan, and everyone else who had loved and helped him make his way to safety.
“And I don’t think either of you will ever understand how thankful I am for that,” Tony added softly. “So thank you both again, from the bottom of my heart, for helping me escape the Stanes and getting me to Steve.”
“Stane wouldn’t dare cross me and mine,” Vernon said sharply from the doorway, making the younger alpha yelp. “Anthony, Janet, come inside at once before you catch cold.”
“I’ll go top off our drinks,” Tony offered. “And you can go interrogate Raven on her charmeuse.”
he say? “I… I guess…” He chewed on his bottom lip nervously before continuing, “I guess I’d say… I answered a lot of marriage ads. Some of the replies I got were… awful. And Steve’s first reply kind of was awful too. But I decided to give him a chance anyway, and his second reply to me was beautiful and thoughtful and… and he gave me a present.”
“I–he’s glad I said yes,” Tony answered after a moment, breathless. His lips began to spread into a wide smile. “He’d be honored to call me his omega.” He laughed a little, helpless, and lifted a hand to wipe the tears forming in his eyes. “He’s going to go shout it to the world that I think he’d be a good mate.”
Jim allowed one of the porters to take the cart, instead going to stand by Tony. Tony worried, for a moment, that Jim would put his arm around him or grab his hand, like the alphas back home had, but was pleasantly surprised when Jim’s hand merely hovered over the small of his back, urging him to follow the porter, before it fell back to his side.
“You will not marry Ezekiel,” Jarvis growled. “I will let you marry anyone else but him.”
Tony grimaced and folded his arms on the table, shoving his face into them as he mumbled, “Tiberius Stone.”
don’t like alphas taking advantage of their station to bully the omegas that depend on them. So… I
And nearly choked on it as the end of the trunk where his feet were jerked upward, slamming his head into the opposite side.
“He’s beating what appears to be the head officer very soundly about the head while the others try and pull him off,” Jan declared proudly, probably pressed up against the window to watch.
“When they died, I wasn’t yet allowed to control the estate. I was too young. I can’t say I fault the logic,” he added with a reluctant shrug. “I’d just lost both of my parents. I’m sure I would have made many poor decisions in my grief. So I went into the care of my father’s butler and his wife.”
“Are all Americans gossips?” Victor complained immediately. “Susan asked the same thing. So unrepentantly nosy. It’s none of your business!”
“I do not!” Tony exclaimed, glaring at her, and hoped his cheeks weren’t as hot as they felt.
“The hotel has really good food,” Steve said after a moment, looking a little guilty, as if he’d hated to bring it up. He was starting to open the envelope again.
“What-?” Tony asked, startled, and lifted the pillow to stare at her in surprise. “What do you—”
Jan dropped Steve’s reply directly into Tony’s hands, but he set it down onto the table, too frightened to open it, too afraid that Steve would expect something, and Tony wouldn’t be able to live up to it. He wanted desperately for it to say, ‘Dear Tony, I’m looking for you in a mate,’ but he knew that was childish. His life wasn’t a romance novel. This was real life, and real life was messy and difficult and… and had real consequences. Like being destitute or marrying a philanderer and his scummy father.
Tony turned back to the mouthpiece of the phone. “Yes, I’m quite alright. Janet, I’m going to do something duplicitous and I need your help.”
“But Jan, you
“Come on,” someone said sharply, grabbing his arm.
moved, it had taken all of his effort to do so. Tony circled the cart and grabbed one of the handles to see how heavy it was. He was dismayed to find he couldn’t budge it an inch. What had Jan sent him off with? An anvil? Did she expect he'd need one?
“I’m sure we can always take the anvil out if I do,” Steve assured him, smiling in good humor.
“Ana,” Tony said, sitting up, completely bewildered but hopeful. “What are you talking about?”
“U-um—” Tony blushed a little. “A drawing. Of the view from his porch. It—it was beautiful. And he was so humble, said he wished he had something better to give me. We exchanged additional correspondence, told each other what we expected out of a partner, and… um… I traveled west to meet him.”
Tony immediately felt some of the tension in his shoulders ease. Steve thought he was pretty. He’d known, logically, that he was an attractive person, but he’d also known that that didn’t mean he’d be attractive to everyone. He couldn’t help his lips tipping up into a smile. “The picture you sent me didn’t do you much justice.”
“Tony!” Jan hissed immediately, pushing herself away from the window and toward one of the air holes in the trunk.
There was a knock on the door, and Tony hurriedly shoved the letters and sketches under his pillows, terrified. Though Jarvis and Ana always gave him privacy, Ana rarely ever gave more than a quick tap before she walked in, and Jarvis rarely ever came into the rooms he was occupying without Tony expressly asking for him, because he always had something to do in the house. If he was knocking, that meant he was buying time.
He comforted himself with the fact that Howard, who had been
“I never really swore,” Hank replied, shrugging.
Ana paused mid-sip, then set her glass down to frown at him. “Why?”
Steve, who was earnest and kind and nothing at all like Ezekiel.
have to offer him? What can I do?”
“I think it’s sort of unfair, that I’d get to have my family and friends at the church, and you didn’t,” Steve admitted after a moment. “So I thought we might have a quick ceremony now, and then later, when you could invite your friends and family, we’d have a big celebration. It’s already unfair enough that you had to leave everything and everyone behind. I’m sure everyone here will understand once I explain it to them.” His mouth quirked up into a wry smile. “Besides, Bucky isn’t back from taking the herd to market. He’d never forgive me if I had my big wedding without him standing at my side as best man.”
Jan dashed back into the room, dressed in a beautiful light blue dress with a pretty dark blue peacoat with a cinched waist. “Alright! I’m ready!”
Tony blinked at his back in surprise, then finally stepped around him to see what he was looking at. It seemed like the entire town had shown up at the depot. Everyone was goggling up at them like they were one of the displays at the zoo, some looking deliriously happy and others shedding a few tears. Tony remembered, suddenly, what Jim had said at the train station in Chicago—Everyone knows everybody. You can only keep a secret if you don’t share it. Everyone had been trying to find a partner for Steve and hadn’t managed it.
much to offer. You’re clever, and kind, and resourceful. I’m sure you’d figure something out. But I’ll teach you, as much as I can before you leave. I’ll teach you everything you need to know.”
“And Edwin was so charming,” she sighed, and covered her mouth for a moment. “So sweet, and kind. I fell in love with him immediately. Of course, I did play hard to get,” she added hurriedly. “And my mother didn’t approve, but… then the unrest started happening, and I was frightened—everyone was. So my mother told me she approved, and I went to Edwin, and we married immediately and followed your father to Italy. He paid for our honeymoon. He struggled to show his emotions, but… I think he did try to show Edwin that he was happy for him in his own way. We were so happy.” She stroked her thumb up and down the back of Tony’s neck gently. “We’re
“I… I’m a little embarrassed about how frank I was in it,” Tony admitted. “But I—I think I really do want you to read it.”
Tony had imagined Steve’s face for months, but nothing he’d dreamed of could have prepared him for the real thing. He wondered, in the back of his mind, if he’d been too afraid to hope that Steve would be earnest, kind,
“The hotel isn’t very far,” Steve said, cutting into his thoughts. “And I know it must have been a long trip from New York. How would you like to stretch your legs?”
“Just the regular amount,” she replied, fluffing a pillow before gently putting it over his head to help block out the rest of the light. “I just added a hell of a lot of gin to it.”
Jarvis looked surprisingly unworried about the idea. “I’m sure that Steve will have a cast iron pan.”
Tony fought reflexively as he was dragged down the front steps at a run, but stopped when he recognized who had a grip on him. “Reed!”
” and then letting out a furious roar as he turned on the crooked police, or private detectives, or whatever they were.
Jan said nothing, just swallowed around the lump in her throat as she continued gently scratching over his scalp.
, and
Jan snorted, patting his shoulder fondly. “You may not know his favorite color or what he looks like, but you know he’s modest, and kind, and that he’ll provide for you. You know he’s a great artist, and he enjoys reading, and he’s a hopeless romantic. You know he’ll be kind to you. Think about all the things you know about him.”
Greer nodded, taking another bite of her apple. “Hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but you must be on the train a long time if you’re in the Pullman car, right? That’s a long time with nothing to do. My father gave me an entire carpet bag filled with books. Yeah,” she added with a grin at Tony’s appalled expression. “The porters hate me. Anyway, I have all these books, right? And you’ve got nothing to do. Maybe you can help me and do the porters a favor at the same time. You want a couple books?”
So Tony sent a response saying he would be there, and then promptly fled to Jan’s home in a cold sweat over what to do.
Tony froze, terrified, realizing a moment too late that he’d crushed the sandwich quarter in one fist in terror. He thought, in the back of his mind, that he might have ruined several of Jan’s lacy things with the mayonnaise. He would be very sorry about it if he didn’t die from a heart attack first, as it was becoming clear they were not just moving luggage around, but were actively carrying the trunk out of the baggage car.
Tony looked up at him in confusion. “A cast iron pan?”
kill the yeast between proofing and leaving it to rise?
“Word travels fast, dear,” Ana told him gently as she grabbed a coat from the closet for him. “Especially when Edwin knows the Storms’ doorman.”
“Will you get lost,” Steve hissed, waving at them. “You’re embarrassing me!” The crowd slowly began to disburse, but not without many of them giving Steve knowing smirks or rolled eyes. Steve muttered to himself, still flushed.
Tony sighed and went to go look in her full-length mirror again. “Jan, you know I don’t really like having oh well how do you do.” He turned, eyebrows raised in surprise, and hummed happily when he saw the way the fabric held him just right, making his shoulders look broader and his waist trimmer and—wow, his butt looked fantastic! “Jan, I love it!” he exclaimed, spinning toward her.
“Thanks,” Tony said again, and offered her the best smile he had in him to give before he curled up on the bottom of the trunk, feet pressed to the carpet bags at the bottom, hugging himself when he realized he didn’t know what to do with his hands. He squeezed his eyes shut as he felt her begin laying clothes on top of him, whispering, “Jan, I’m scared.”
“Everyone called you ‘
cottage pie!”
Jan was quiet again before she whispered,
“Anthony,” Jarvis whispered into his hair. “You have
“Oh, don’t be preposterous, Anthony. That’s not what’s happening,” Ana scoffed, rolling her eyes. “How else are you to fake a fever?”
Tony was hurt, but only for a moment, because then he noticed Steve’s ears were quickly turning pink. As he watched, Steve’s ears flushed darker, and he realized with a start that they were just as red as the rest of his face, which he was trying in vain to hide behind his hand. “Do you… like it?” he couldn’t help but ask, too cautious to immediately decide that he was happy about it.
“…Jan tells me that she’s made a new suit for Susan Storm’s party,” Hank said.
“This is really good, Tony,” Jan said, slathering some apricot jam on a slice of bread. “At least you’ll be able to make bread for Steve, if nothing else.”
Tony squirmed in his seat and fought the childish urge to declare ‘it’s mine!’ and snatch it back. He was more mature than that–had been trained better than that. He couldn’t help feeling pleased when Ana and Jarvis looked impressed when they examined it too, though. He told himself it was irrational–this was his second letter from the alpha, and even though it was much better than the first, he had no claim on Steve. Steve had no claim on him. He shouldn’t feel pleased as if they were approving of an intended mate.
your fiancée. I don’t want to marry you.” He was Steve’s fiancée and no one else’s. Especially not Ezekiel’s.
Tony scowled after him, wrinkling his nose a little, before he grabbed a handkerchief and turned to blot at the letter to Steve. It was ruined though. He sighed and turned his attention to the finished and addressed envelopes, glad that they, at least, weren’t too terribly damaged.
“Steve doesn’t need to know that,” Jan scoffed.
always late,” Tony pointed out, frowning.
Tony got up and hovered over the books, peeking through them thoughtfully. Finally, he decided on a few with interesting titles, and a couple he knew he definitely liked. He couldn’t help but look them over proudly. He was coming to Steve with so little, even just these few things made him feel like he was providing for himself more. Maybe Steve would like these books, too. It would be nice to be able to talk about them with someone. Ana had preferred mysteries, and Jarvis and Jan enjoyed romances.
“One day you’ll get him fully trained,” Tony joked. “Although having his life flash before his eyes will probably keep him from mentioning how awful my life is to my face ever again.”
Jan snatched the paper once his hands were away from it, letting out a triumphant ‘ha!’ “Is it vulgar? Should we have let Mr. Jarvis read it first?!” she asked gleefully, smoothing the paper as Jarvis and Tony both squawked in affront for entirely different reasons. She looked down at it, grinning, but then her expression softened into something more awed and impressed. “Oh.”
Jim tilted his head, intrigued. “Like railroad tycoon rich?”
Tony, wisely, moved further down the counter to examine soaps, because he didn’t fancy the idea of wearing a scent that smelled like dead roses. He paused, hovering by the fancier ones. He could probably charge it to the house expense account. They used soap after all. And if Obadiah found out it was fancy soap instead of the regular lye soap Jarvis usually bought, well… Tony supposed he could demure and insist he wanted to smell nice for Ezekiel. They might let their guards down a little then.
Some of it was correspondence for him. He began going through it faster, hopeful, and let out a triumphant ‘ah ha!’ when he found a letter from Steve. He’d been waiting on pins and needles for it. Hopefully, this letter would tell him how long he’d have to endure Ezekiel before he could go to Steve. He groped blindly for a letter opener and nearly snarled when he couldn’t find one, pulling open a few drawers and slamming them shut again.
“That sounds wonderful, Steve,” he finally said when he realized Steve was waiting for his answer. “I… Yes, a small ceremony sounds fine. Thank you.”
He also wondered about Steve’s friends. Steve had mentioned that they’d been excited about him finding someone. His best friend and partner on the ranch had even insisted on taking Steve’s place taking the cattle to market because he wanted to make sure Steve stayed and replied to any letters he received. That meant that they were invested, right? So they’d want Tony to be happy too? He really wanted them to like him. He hoped he measured up to their expectations, too. He wanted them to think he was good for Steve, like Jim had.
He’d never know either way if he didn’t make a decision, though.
Tony sniffed. “Thanks, Jan. I’ll see you tomorrow? After your date with Hank?”
He’d thought he might worry about other things, like how long he’d need to be married to Steve before it was safe to send word to his friends, or whether Steve would turn out to be just like his letters or not. Now, though, he mostly worried about things farther in the future—Would his garden turn out? What should he try to plant first? He’d read that beans were an easy plant to care for, and maybe tomatoes and squash. He wondered what Steve’s favorite vegetable was. He’d said he’d eat anything even if it tasted bad, but he must have a favorite, right? He liked pound cake, after all. Surely he had a favorite vegetable.
He clutched back at her, burying his face in her shoulder as he whispered, “He wants to
“That far?” Tony couldn’t help but ask, dismayed.
“The highest of compliments from a man passionate about ants,” Tony answered affably.
“My foot you’ll leave,” Jan cut in immediately. “Show him in please, Samantha!”
“Just a few of your mother’s things that I was able to hide from Obadiah. Your father’s favorite book. The book on gardening you were taking the most notes about.”
Ana helpfully dropped a spoonful of honey into his cup. She knew that Tony didn’t like tea but could stand it with a touch of honey.
And then the calmest, angriest voice he had ever heard said, “Officer, what are you doing rifling through my daughter’s underthings?”
Instead of continuing to argue (Tony was delicate right now, it might hurt him too much to lose), she fussed with his carpet bags. “I’m putting lacy stuff on top of you, so you shouldn’t have too much trouble breathing.”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed softly.
he didn’t say, but he didn’t need to, and gently touched Tony’s back as Jan helped him inside. He turned back to Reed and inclined his head just slightly. “It appears you’re not a total nincompoop, Richards.”
Tony turned to look up at him, both hands clasped around his money purse. “So?”
“So may I use your address?” Tony asked, because her glee seemed like an answer, but he didn’t want to put her in any trouble. “I don’t want Obadiah to get suspicious, and—”
that the Stark heir abandoned all of his money for love?”
“You certainly are,” Tony agreed, looking over his shoulder into the mirror, then paused. The suit was so nice, fitting him like a glove in all the right places. He hadn’t had a full suit that fit him so well in a long time. He frowned, shoulders sagging, and whispered, “But I can’t wear this to parties.”
Tony smiled a little.
Tony sat back in his seat, feeling a little shell-shocked.
“Tony,” Greer said firmly, and shoved the carpet bag next to her onto the floor. It hit with a loud thud. Tony stared at it in horror. “I don’t want to sell any of these to you. I want to give them to you. I can’t read all these! And I don’t particularly want to travel with them, either! Can you imagine me lugging these all around California?”
“I am not,” Tony lied, covering his cheeks to hide how hot they were.
too bold. So he nodded to himself, folded the letter up, and put it in an envelope, then put it in his carpet bag. Then he fidgeted, wondering if he should write another letter he couldn’t send to Jan.
“Oooh, Tony’s got a crush!” Jan squealed, clapping.
Tony clutched at her, burying his face in her shoulder. “
He’d just… really, really wanted to, was all.
Jan scowled at him. “You’re going too, Tony.”
Jan slammed the last trunk closed and whipped around to give them both a glare. “Yeah, what’s that all about?!”
“I just don’t want you to strain yourself—” Tony began, then nearly swallowed his tongue when Steve grabbed the handle on one end and tugged upward, easily pulling it off the ground and dragging it toward the steps. “Oh,” he squeaked instead. “Um. Okay. Never mind.”
. It was olive green and salmon pink. My lord, what an ugly tie,” she whispered, mostly to herself, but smiled when Tony reluctantly giggled. “And, well. I was the tie girl. I had to pretend I thought that tie was great. I tried to up sell it to every customer, but they always turned it down. Then one day, the owner of the shop came up to me, and he said, ‘Ana, if you sell this tie today, I’ll give you a raise.’
When his parents had died, Tony had
Well… Maybe not so little time. He hadn’t heard back from Steve, yet, after all, and who knew if Steve still wanted him after his reply? Perhaps he hadn’t sold himself well enough. Steve had an awful lot of desires in a mate and Tony probably hadn’t been incredibly reassuring when he admitted that he wasn’t necessarily very skilled at these things. He’d asked for Steve to be patient as he learned, but maybe Steve couldn’t afford to be patient. Tony understood that.
“Johnny and I could cause trouble,” Reed offered. “And I know this would be the sort of thing Ben wouldn’t mind getting caught up in.”
Jan wiped at her eyes quickly. “Yes, of course!”
Jan was such a strong girl, a strong omega, that sometimes when he saw her like this, it jarred him. Vernon didn’t know what to do. On one hand, Tony was obviously so terrified that he could not possibly even fathom the idea of handing the omega over. On the other, even with all of the prestige, power, and money behind the Van Dyne name, he wasn’t entirely willing to put it out there that Tony was under his protection, especially when Stane still technically had custody of him, or at least the Stark fortune. That could start an entirely different legal mess.
“Should I get someone to help?” Tony couldn’t help but fret. Jim had been able to push the cart with his trunk with ease, but he’d had wheels to help him at the time. There didn’t look to be any carts handy, and he doubted he’d be much assistance when he’d barely been able to move the cart himself.
He turned around sharply, putting his back to the trunk to see who had spoken to him. He swallowed thickly as he looked up at the alpha, forcing himself not to wring his hands. He wouldn’t show he was nervous at all. “I-I’m fine!” he assured the alpha.
“I’m not bothered. I just noticed you don’t seem to have much to do,” she replied carelessly. She held a hand out to him. “I’m Greer.”
Victor looked supremely put out by this information. “Disgusting. You can have one of mine then.”
Could he really just say ‘that makes me really happy?’ It seemed like it wasn’t nearly enough. He wasn’t just happy—he was elated, excited, relieved. He was nervous and scared out of his wits to fail. He was afraid to leave the city life he’d always known, but Steve had made ranch life sound so romantic, if a little lonely. And Jan was right—he was also a little afraid that he’d thrive away from everything and everyone he’d known.
“It’s alright, sir,” the maid told him, smiling. “I know you wouldn’t have knocked me down.”
naturally suspicious, had been fooled, too.
Tony was getting really tired of Ezekiel pinching him. It was bad enough that Ezekiel couldn’t keep up with him in discussions of things like cars or chemistry or politics, but Ezekiel had no ambition. He didn’t want to work toward anything; he just wanted to be catered to. Tony was becoming increasingly aware that as long as Obadiah continued to provide funds for Ezekiel’s shiftless lifestyle, he would do anything Obadiah asked as his ever willing, comfortable pawn.
Tony saw that the telegram was addressed to Janice Van Dyne and, despite his terror, despite his anxiety and distress, he began to laugh.
“You’ll wear the red and marigold suit I gave you, is what you’ll do,” Jan scoffed, not looking away from the dress form she was currently working on.
He pulled the letter back out and reached for a fresh piece of paper to start over again, then paused, nib hovering over the parchment. He stared at the blank sheet for a moment before pushing it aside and instead unfolding his original letter again. If anyone asked, his stationery was expensive, and he couldn’t afford to waste an extra piece of paper just because he accidentally wrote ‘dear Steve’ instead of ‘Mr. Steve Rogers.’
Every lawyer he’d been to was either too afraid to go against Obadiah or had told him that legally there was nothing they could do—Obadiah was his guardian, and as such legally had control of his fortune. If he had been mismanaging it, they’d be able to do something, but from what they saw, he was just investing money into sure ventures just like Howard had always done. Tony could find no way to get proof of Obadiah’s underhanded business dealings safely, and his money was all tied up in places he wasn’t even certain about, so there was nothing to be done; Obadiah would continue to be his guardian, and in doing so would continue to selfishly keep his money under the guise of ‘taking care of it’ when he really only meant to blackmail Tony into marrying his son, and Tony could only watch helplessly.
“The wagon,” Tony repeated quietly as he was led over to the steps of the platform.
“Red slacks?” Tony asked in disbelief. “And a yellow shirt? Come on, Jan, that’s just—just—”
“Oh, no,” Samantha answered quickly. “I wasn’t cleaning–just delivering Miss Jan’s correspondence. I hear you’re engaged,” she added in a whisper, leaning in. “I just want to say–I’m very happy for you, sir. The Stanes—well. Servants talk. Even if only half of it’s true…” She looked incredibly uncomfortable. “I’m very,
“I can drive myself,” Ana scoffed, glaring at him.
Tony snorted his tea out his nose.
Tony stared at the drawing for a few long seconds before letting out a screech of laughter, unable to help himself. And then he couldn’t stop.
“See? You know a lot about him,” Jan said, smiling. She stroked her fingers through his hair again, tilting her head. “Listen, Tony. You have the privilege that few of us will ever have–Steve doesn’t know you’re a Stark, or what that would even entail. He doesn’t know you’re an heir to a fortune, or that you’ve been financially abused by your guardian. He just reads your letters and knows you only as ‘Tony,’ a penniless omega willing to leave everything he knows behind to start a new life with someone he is willing to get to know after he marries.” Her smile went a bit sad around the edges, a little wistful and, perhaps, the tiniest bit jealous. “That’s a very attractive person to be.”
“Johnny,” Jan growled, gripping her hands into fists. “I’ll remember this.”
“Sweetheart,” Ezekiel drawled, resting his free hand on Tony’s hip, and casually sliding it back to grasp a handful of cheek. “You must know that you don’t really have a choice.”
“No,” Tony admitted. “But we really don’t have much of a choice now.”
“It’s true,” Tony added when Victor looked disbelieving. “One way or another, Jan learns everything. She’s someone you definitely want on your side, though. She recently threatened Reed with a shrimp fork.”
“…What about Johnny?” Jan asked after a brief pause to get her bearings. “Other than he needs to stop teasing me about Hank.”
“STEVE,” someone barked again.
“So…” Steve began as they stepped out of the hotel, shoving his hands into his pockets.
Jan offered him a smile, apparently deeming his offer enough to forgive him for his horrible statement earlier that night. “Oh, Reed, thanks. We’ll keep that in mind, but hopefully we’ll figure something out that
“That—that would be greedy,” Tony answered weakly. “And rude! I don’t have the right to be so demanding. I—”
Steve smiled even as he rolled his eyes a little. “There won’t be another train stopping for another sixteen hours. I think it’s fine.”
Tony reread Steve’s last letter, frowning. He could… he could be a companion. He could be someone to talk to, someone to come home to. Steve wouldn’t need to spend each night alone, watching the prairie. He had lots to talk about. His parents had always laughed about how he could have a conversation with himself, too, so if Steve were ever too tired to talk, Tony could… talk for the both of them.
“Spoken like someone who Jan has knocked down,” Tony answered, smiling reluctantly, and the beta laughed. “Will I be in your way if I stay here?”
Well… he supposed it was bigger than it actually was. After the first letter where Jarvis had gasped and clutched his chest, mortally offended, he’d shoved a bunch of the ones he’d opened and read in the wastebasket. He’d simply hissed like an angry cat as he shoved the letters down as far as he could.
“It’s lovely,” Ana said knowingly, handing it back. “I’m sure he would be pleased if you asked for more drawings.”
Then there was the rattle of keys and the sound of his trunk being unlocked before Jan cried, “Tony!” and began digging through her clothes for him.
“Sure,” Steve began carelessly. Then he noticed how concerned Tony actually looked about leaving his things and quickly corrected, “Yeah, they’ll be fine.” He slapped his hand against the side of the wagon. “No one’s going to be able to hook up their horses to it without someone else causing a fuss, because they know this wagon’s mine, and I’ve paid Gabe to keep an eye on it while it’s here. He’s the telegrapher,” he added when Tony raised his eyebrows. “He’s actually a good friend of mine. Think he only accepted the money because
Tony tapped his bottom lip thoughtfully. He’d met the Goulds, and while he’d been impressed with their finery, he didn’t think it really matched up to Victor von Doom. “More like, ‘we’re pretty sure he might have a claim to the throne in his home country’ rich.”
When he started fidgeting, Tony reached out to look through Jan’s correspondence. She’d said that organizing it had helped her when she got stuck on a design. Maybe having something to do with his hands would help ground him, too.
Jarvis finally turned, laying one lightly floured hand over her clasped, trembling ones. “I doubt it would come to that, dear.”
Tony rubbed the soft fabric between his fingers nervously before softly asking, “Will you—will you tell me how you and Jarvis met again?”
“Well,
Jan scoffed. “No. We figured this would happen, so Daddy had me leave early just in case. But you know, hysterical omegas, always thinking they’re going to be late.”
She turned to offer him one of the most derisive scowls he’d ever seen. “You may not be a big crybaby but I’m still going to protect you. You’re my best friend, and life dealt you a useless hand. Of course I’m going to do what I can to make life easier for you when it’s possible.”
Tony bit his bottom lip, then whispered, “But what if I don’t marry Steve?”
engaging, and Jarvis had nearly fainted dead away when he read one of them.) This alpha, Steve, hadn’t really tried to engage further at all, just answered his questions. Would their marriage be like that, too, Tony putting forth all the effort and Steve doing as he was asked or told and nothing else? He couldn’t imagine a marriage like that. He was about to drop the letter in the ‘no’ pile but then noticed a postscript on the back of the envelope, almost too small for him to have noticed.
Ana continued to frown at him until she lost the battle to keep a straight face in response to his giggling, instead smiling wryly as both Tony and Jarvis finally relaxed, even if it was only a little. “Have fun at Ms. Van Dyne’s, Tony.”
If Steve still wanted him now that Tony was making this real.
The mansion was no longer his home. He had to keep pushing forward. He had to keep moving toward Steve.
Tony frowned, confused but knowing it would be futile to argue. He began unbuttoning his shirt, mumbling, “…You gave me this shirt last year…”
Ezekiel came to hover next to him, pretty sure that if he tried to pass into Tony’s room without permission, Jarvis would happily gut him.
“Maybe you’ll work out better as friends,” she suggested when he picked up the envelope and frowned at it. “Just because you’re not compatible as spouses doesn’t mean you have to give up on him. Weren’t you just telling me that you had an interesting conversation about… what was it… atoms or something?”
Tony couldn’t help a shocked giggle. “Oh!”
Finally, impatient, he peeled it open, letting out the quietest of curses and then frantically looking around just in case someone heard. Then he remembered he wasn’t at home and there was no Jarvis to box his ears over it, and hurriedly turned back to the letter, nearly bouncing in his seat when he realized there was another drawing in the envelope.
“Steve,” someone barked suddenly. “Are you just going to stand up there in the sun all day?”
“I am
.-.-.-.
Except he wasn’t sure he could even offer Steve the barest bones of what he was looking for in a mate.
“‘The vegetables we know as beans and peas, called legumes, are members of the large Fabaceae family and represent some of the most important vegetable staples known to mankind…’”
“What is it?” Ana asked, and then scoffed and smacked her husband’s arm when he tried to grab for it. “If it was raunchy, she wouldn’t be looking at it like that.”
“Steve,” the waitress gasped in affront as she brought their food out. “Have you made your beau cry already? You’re never going to get married, you idiot!”
“…I hear you’re engaged,” Hank said after a moment. “I’m… glad to hear that.”
“Incredible,” Tony said, impressed with how awful Jim’s answer had been.
Jarvis couldn’t help a fond laugh. “You really don’t need to write these down immediately, Anthony. I’d repeat it for you later.”
“I would like that very much, Jarvis,” Tony murmured softly. “And I could introduce you to Steve, and show you all the things I’ve learned.”
“When Edwin started courting me, he nearly tripped over himself when I said I liked his tea and promised that I would have it every morning once we married,” Ana explained, smiling when Jarvis blushed a little. “And he hasn’t let me go one morning without a cup of his delicious tea since. I’m sure this alpha would love to provide you with something that he’s skilled in.”
There was only one trunk left, probably because everyone else getting off the train had known where they were going. Still, Tony answered, “Yes, that’s the one.”
“I suppose that will change when I go to Steve,” Tony mused.
“Yes, but then I’d have to break you out of jail, and then we’d both be fugitives. I can’t imagine Steve would want to marry a fugitive.”
“C-Can I write the telegram to Steve that you’ll send?” Tony asked after considering the plan again. “So—so he knows it’s genuine, since he knows how I write,” he added when Victor looked at him in confusion. He did not want to throw the other omega’s kindness back into his face by telling him that he didn’t want to send Steve a telegram that was probably more expensive than his house.
.-.-.-.
“Ezekiel, he—he’ll try to… touch me,” Tony admitted haltingly, wincing when Jan’s face began to turn red with anger. “I’ve been trying not to dress as nicely to try to discourage him. If I wear this, he… He’ll try to be sneaky about it, but… he’s not… very good at being sneaky.”
“Jarvis!” Tony whispered again, eyes filled with tears.
Tony felt hot with mortification, and then cold with terror. If even the help was happy he wasn’t going to the Stanes… What happened in that house? He was so lucky he’d been allowed to stay in his own home with Jarvis and Ana.
“Did you ever get your raise?”
“Chicago,” Tony whispered, and couldn’t help hugging himself. He’d been to Chicago once before with his mother, to go shopping, but he didn’t remember much of it. It was kind of terrifying to think about. Then again, most of the last few months had been terrifying to think about. He couldn’t—
or anything—she was taking projects, swatches of fabric and baskets of thread and needle. And she was going to hold Victor to buying her some souvenirs, too. So she needed the trunks. (She didn’t tell him she was bringing a fourth trunk and would probably buy more in Maine, because his side-eye had been lethal over just three.)
to the imagination. Tony didn’t really have any idea who to look for. And maybe—maybe he was getting nervous again. He looked around the platform, frowning, wondering if he’d know Steve if he saw him. All he really had to go on with a brown blob with yellow hair, and Jim's halting description of ‘alpha with a face that isn't necessarily bad looking.’
Tony couldn’t help a somewhat hysterical giggle.
Tony sighed, leaning back to look at her. “I think I knew from the moment I started writing letters, I was going to make this choice eventually.”
Hank made a very sad noise at the idea. “Oh, yes. That’s probably true.”
Ana squeezed her eyes shut, frustrated, but said nothing; she knew that her husband was feeling the same way.
Ana slid an arm around her shoulders and drew her away to give the boys some privacy. “Janet, may I speak freely?”
Tony couldn’t help but shiver and be very, very glad that Jan had decided they were going to be best friends instead of worst enemies when they’d met as children.
“They were my mother’s favorite,” Victor offered, apparently the only way he would accept his thanks.
“Jarvis will know what to do!” Tony told him, then sat back in his seat, whispering, “Jarvis always knows what to do when I’m in trouble.”
Tony wished he had something to do with his hands. He knew that Jarvis hadn’t had time to pack much, and he and Jan had been too preoccupied with escaping at all that they hadn’t even thought to grab a book or something. He went through his carpet bags anyway, since Jan had already surprised him with a key to a trunk. Perhaps someone had secreted away another item of interest, or a book. Unfortunately, all he could find were the bundle of letters from Steve, his stationery, the cookbook Ana had bought for him, and his notebook detailing the basics Jarvis had taught him. He wished he’d had more time to practice homemaking before he’d had to leave.
“I have to write it down or I’ll lose it,” Tony insisted. He had so much to learn in so little time.
Ezekiel’s eyes raked up and down his body like a physical touch, so obviously that Tony shivered in disgust and wanted to hide. “Miss Van Dyne made that suit for you, didn’t she? It’s quite flattering.”
, of all people, had made every omega at the table flee to the bathroom to be able to laugh freely.
Victor considered this, then nodded, looking pleased with the thought. “Yes, that’s a good idea. Good thinking, Anthony.”
Tony immediately flushed bright red, and he wasn’t even entirely sure why, except that maybe he hadn’t really expected Steve to be so familiar immediately. Then again, he thought, smiling to himself a little as he looked back down at his feet. They’d shared enough letters to be that familiar, hadn’t they?
Ana and Jan kept glancing at him worriedly, but Jarvis simply waited, quiet, a soothing presence, until finally he set down one of the letters he was reading and looked at Tony with soft eyes. “Anthony, putting it off isn’t doing you or your beau any good.”
“You’ve murdered me,” Tony whimpered again. “I will heave all my innards out if I move ever again.”
Tony couldn’t help a smile. “Putting your first letter to shame already? You told me you were a better conversationalist in person.”
“Tony,” Steve murmured, finally looking up from the letter. He swallowed thickly. “Tony, did you mean it?”
“Steve,” Tony asked after a moment of thought. “Did you have other omegas that you wrote to?”
am going back to bed.”
When Jan brought the next batch of correspondence, Tony squirmed impatiently as she handed each of them a stack of envelopes to open. Tony flipped through his stack until he found a reply from Steve, dismayed when he realized there wasn’t one. Had Steve lost interest? Had he been writing other omegas? Omegas who didn’t have so much to learn, who didn’t come with so much baggage? Omegas who, perhaps… might come with money?
Tony waved the drawing around helplessly. “A p-picture of Ste-he-heve!” he laughed, hugging his stomach. God, he hadn’t given himself a bellyache from laughing in
“Oh, you don’t have to—” Tony began, but Jan and Jarvis were already getting up out of their seats.
“Edwin is making you a tonic right now,” Ana assured him, running a hand up and down his arm gently. “Just be glad you’re not Janet.”
Ana yelped as Jan ducked past her, then grunted as she had to spin with the motion to avoid Tony and his floury hands, too, holding the bag of groceries she’d bought over her head. “Children!” she shouted after them, like she had so many times before, and smiled when they shouted happy, giggly apologies over their shoulders.
“Victor von Doom. Is trying to help. Me,” Tony repeated slowly in disbelief.
—give up now, just when freedom was within reach.
“Thank you,” Tony replied, still embarrassed.
“What?!” Jan asked, bursting into the room. “What? What is it?!”
“Then you kindly tell him you can’t give him what he wants, and tell him you’d still like to be friends if that’s at all possible, and be understanding if he tells you ‘no,’” Jarvis replied, reaching out to place his hand on one of the omega’s shoulders. He gave a firm but gentle squeeze when he felt the fine tremors running through the younger man. “Sometimes even when you
“Yeah. Just don’t tell Mrs. McAvoy that her miniature roses are prettier than Mrs. Langdon’s. They both got cuttings at the same time and have been at each other’s throats about it ever since,” Steve whispered conspiratorially, and when Tony looked back up at him, he gave him a playful wink.
Tony smiled a little down at his stationery. Well, Jarvis had just been trying to help, even if it had fallen flat. At least he’d gotten a good laugh out of it. He picked up his pen, twisting it in his fingers as he tried to figure out what to say, but couldn’t make it further than ‘Dear Steve’ without blushing and letting a high-pitched noise pass his lips.
“Yes, my compliments are the best,” she preened. Tony rolled his eyes so hard his entire body moved with it. She primly said nothing, instead shuffling through the letters she’d brought him. “That chemist you were talking to sent another letter.”
Jan and Tony watched her leave the room. “She’s so neat,” Jan breathed. “How did Mr. Jarvis ever manage finding a girl like that?”
Tony looked up at her, startled. “Hello? Oh, I’m sorry. I must be bothering you,” he added, tucking his hands in his lap.
“Not damaged, just a little sticky,” Ana said lightly as she waved a couple of envelopes to help dry them. “Edwin, I can’t believe you forgot all about cottage pie. That’s one of the simplest beef dishes. You
“Of course,” Tony said, confused. “Aren’t omegas affectionate with each other where you come from?”
Tony looked back and forth between them as they stared at each other, each of them silently and frantically trying to figure out at what moment it had apparently gone so wrong. He did not know whether it would be appropriate to laugh or not. Here Jan had thought that Victor had been snubbing her the whole time, but really, he’d misheard when she was introduced and thought he had her name correctly. Would it be rude to laugh?
“I don’t want that for you, Anthony. And neither would your parents.”
The train only stopped in Manchester long enough for Tony to give Jan and Victor hurried hugs. He might have managed something a bit longer if Victor hadn’t insisted on it not being necessary, but Tony had wanted to show him how sincere he was in his thankfulness. He’d noticed that Victor had looked at he and Jan with a silent sort of longing, as if all he’d ever wanted was an omega friend to hold hands with or cuddle. Tony wondered if it was a culture thing, that omegas in Latveria weren’t physically affectionate with each other, or if it really was all because of how Victor had been separated for his safety. Victor had been so stiff in his arms, but the hands that he’d hesitantly placed on Tony’s waist had been gentle, not pushing him away, so he was pretty sure he knew the answer, but he didn’t really like it.
Tony couldn’t help but smile down at his hands shyly. Victor might not have had a lot of patience for things he didn’t like, and he probably didn’t even think about how much he was giving him, but it was nice that it looked like a friend being concerned to Jim.
“Maybe Ana can find me an inexpensive cookbook while she’s buying herself a new penny novel,” Tony mumbled, frowning.
” Tony scoffed, then covered his mouth, blushing a little.
Still, he grabbed the pen and added a postscript, just for a little peace of mind.
Tony reached out with shaking fingers to pull the false bottom out of the drawer and draw Steve’s letters out, too. His eyes trailed over the looping scrawl again and again. Steve was so earnest, all those
“Here,” Jan whispered, handing him one of the small throw pillows from her chaise lounge. “For your head. It shouldn’t block your air.”
Tony stopped pushing and leaned back, letting out a breath as he scowled down at the trunk. It was on wheels. It was simple math—he applied force, and the trunk was supposed to move. While it
“And I’ll speak to the maids,” Jan added, frowning. “Most of the gossip I overhear is how disgusting it is that Tony has to do this though, so I think they might understand.”
Jan appeared touched and dismayed all at once. Tony was disappointed to say she looked like that when it came to him a lot.
“I know,” Tony said meekly, and stuck his pricked finger into his mouth.
“What is it?!” Jan asked, wild-eyed. “What did he say?!”
“I think he knows,” Tony replied. “And I think he likes it. Would you mind if I…?”
Tony’s shoulders hunched, and he set his clasped hands in his lap to hide how much they were shaking. “What if what he wants is something I can’t give him?”
Jan frowned but accepted the envelope. “Thank you, Samantha.”
. So why am I crying?”
Tony couldn’t help but stare at him, in awe, because where he came from, no alpha would casually admit that someone was actively embarrassing them. Steve didn’t look ashamed of it, though. In fact, he looked a little… fond. And Tony found the way his ears went pink to match his cheeks, in conjunction with his casual admittance of embarrassment, was incredibly charming.
Tony squirmed again. “You’re sure it wouldn’t be inappropriate?”
“It looked like you were,” Jim said, amused. “Have a pleasant trip, Tony.”
Tony laughed, and then let out a startled noise when Jarvis pushed a lock of his hair back behind his ear and leaned in to press a kiss to his temple. “What was that for?” he asked, surprised, because Jarvis usually didn’t indulge in shows of affection unless Tony clearly needed it. It didn’t upset him when Jarvis showed him affection without cause, but… it made Jarvis extremely vulnerable in case the wrong person saw it and reported it back to Obadiah. So he didn’t indulge himself often.
“Honey,” Ana said, smiling at him in amusement, and passed a letter over to him.
stopped to help a hysterical young omega, regardless of whether the danger was real or not. So he inclined his head in agreement. “Alright. Maybe I do need help.”
He was going to laugh, Tony decided, regardless of whether it was rude or not.
“I’ll always look back for you, Jarvis,” Tony whispered. “For you and Ana and Jan. You’ve all done so much for me. I won’t look back for anything else but you.”
“I’m sorry,” Reed said immediately.
“Don’t worry about it. We all know Reed isn’t… consumed with propriety,” he finally said after some thought. “I knew he’d probably say something awful tonight. Alphas just… aren’t concerned with that kind of thing.”
Tony frowned as he thought about it, brows furrowing together, before his lips quirked into the smallest of smiles. “I know he’s a horrible conversationalist unless he’s talking about his ranch or the town nearby.”
“Oh, Edwin, we were all thinking of it,” Ana scoffed. “Anthony is an attractive young omega.”
“If that’s what you want, dear,” Hank answered obediently.
The view as they made their way to the ranch was breathtaking, for as simple as it was. Tony had never seen so much open space in his life, and every time he saw an unfamiliar bird, Steve seemed to know exactly what kind it was. Tony was certain that he’d never had an alpha be so attentive to him in his life, especially without ulterior motives.
Tony tried to smother his laughter with his hands, but it didn’t work.
Jarvis turned to look up at Tony in stony silence before he stood, shook himself off, and said, “
, not yellow, you fashion neanderthal.”
“I wish I was an alpha for you,” Jan whispered helplessly. “Or that I could use my money to help you. But I can’t. My father already told me not to get involved, that it would just make things worse for you.”
“The picture,” Steve repeated softly in confusion, brows furrowing together, before his face went bright red at the realization. “Oh. The picture the kids drew. Ah. Yes, well, the shape was about right, though.”
“Well, no,” Ana admitted. “But that doesn’t make your problems less, Anthony.”
Ana looked taken aback. “Oh, Edwin, you don’t have to stop fixing dishes just because I don’t like them!”
If he didn’t, maybe he still wouldn’t mind Tony talking to him about them. Tony was good at holding conversations with himself, after all, and Steve seemed like the type to listen.
He took a small bite, savoring the flavors of garlicky mayonnaise and cucumber and the lightest dusting of pepper on his tongue. He’d never thought a simple cucumber sandwich could taste so good. Maybe it was the freedom that came with it. He took another bite of the sandwich—
He still had the letter he’d written on the train in his hand. It was a bit worse for wear, now, after his anxious twisting and crumpling of it. He was tempted to hide it, suddenly embarrassed, but he wasn’t entirely sure why. He stared at the envelope for a moment, considering, then looked back up at Steve shyly. “Um… I might have written something for you. While I was on the train,” he offered hesitantly, holding the letter out to him. “I didn’t really have much to do, and I wanted to focus my thoughts… And I, um… I wanted to write you one last letter,” he added. “Because I loved your letters so much.”
“I don’t want to leave you,” Tony whispered helplessly, even though he knew that he didn’t really have a choice.
Tony waited until he was sure Jarvis was out of hearing range before laughing out loud. He wondered how much it had cost Jarvis to suggest such a thing. He’d been so offended at the idea originally, and he really was as prim and proper as any of Tony’s teachers at finishing school.
“I like the way you smell, whatever you wear,” Hank cut in. “You could dab cabbage juice behind your ears and I’d like it.”
Tony could not stop even if he wanted to.
“Thank you, Jarvis,” Tony sighed. “Now I need to write to Steve.” He still didn’t know what to say beyond, ‘Dear Steve, I am getting on a train tomorrow and you’ll be stuck with me before you can regret saying yes.’ That didn’t seem polite.
“Hey, I was just protecting the travelers of Chicago,” Jim replied, smirking a little. “You looked like you were frustrated enough that you were going to pick up your trunk and throw it across the platform.”
“It’s not how many,” Jarvis said. “It’s how long. I usually do it for about five to ten minutes.”
“Daddy, what do we do?” Jan asked, voice shaking.
“Jarvis it burds. Oh by God id's combing oud by dose.”
“Shouldn’t be… coming… away on hands… add… flour,” Tony whispered, writing that too.
“Someone has to cry for you, when you have no tears left to cry for yourself,” Jan told him, and leaned down to press a kiss to his forehead.
“Tony,” Jim said, lips spreading into a grin. “I watched that man snarl at his friend because he thought he was going to fold one of his drawings to send to you wrong. He’ll definitely still want to marry you. I don’t think
Tony choked on his tongue, but it couldn’t be heard over Jarvis’s screech of outrage. “JANET VAN DYNE!”
Tony couldn’t help but be in awe of how sincere he was, even as he began, “My parents were wealthy. I suppose I am now, too, technically.” He scowled a little as he thought about Obadiah stealing his money again. “In theory.”
“Tony,” Jan whispered again, gripping his coat with white knuckles. She let go with one hand to instead lift it and gently run her fingers through his hair, nails dragging along his scalp the way she knew he liked. “Oh, Tony. I’m so sorry.”
“Obadiah doesn’t have to,” Ana said gleefully. “Getting an alpha’s permission isn’t as important out west as it is here. The pickings are slimmer, after all. And as long as you’re frank about how you’ll come with very little money, you won’t have much to worry about. Your husband will have a legal claim on you, and it would be bad press if Obadiah forced you away from the husband that
Obadiah had ruined everything he’d ever hoped and planned for. He’d even ruined Tony’s planned escape to Steve.
“Yes,” Ana said, smiling, even as her eyes filled with tears. “Oh Edwin. I had no idea how much I missed the sound of laughter until just now.”
“If the Stanes try to stop Tony, I’ll kill them,” Ana whispered.
“Yes, I understand.”
Ana slid her hands from his shoulders down to his biceps and gently placed her head on his shoulder with a sad sigh. “I’m sorry, Edwin.”
Finally, too frustrated to try and sleep anymore, he pawed through one of his carpet bags. Jarvis had had to pack them hurriedly, but Tony had noticed that he hadn’t forgotten to pack his stationery. He pulled out one of the bundles of paper, penning a letter to Victor thanking him again for his help and, after some serious thought, asking if they could continue correspondence. They hadn’t really gotten to know each other very well, but he’d liked the softer parts of Victor that he’d seen, the uncertainty in the face of open affection, the discomfort when they expressed gratitude for his help. Perhaps he just needed some omega friends.
“I—of course I meant it,” he muttered, shrugging uncomfortably. “I’ve meant every word I’ve written to you.”
Tony curled his arms around her, trying to soak up as much affection as he could. He was having such fun with them that he’d almost forgotten that there was a possibility he might not get to see them again. He’d already had to say a hurried goodbye to Jarvis and Ana, and he hadn’t gotten to hug them as long as he wanted. Soon he would have to say goodbye to Victor and Jan, too. He hadn’t realized how many farewells he’d have to give just to be able to greet Steve. He wished he’d had more time.
“Poke it,” Tony repeated, reaching over for his pen to jot that down too. His pen and the paper he was writing on were already covered in flour, but now his pen had a smear of sticky dough on it.
Tony took another deep breath, setting the envelope back on the table and smoothing his hands over it. This piece of paper would decide whether his future was with Steve… or someone else. Tony took a moment to smile sadly at the address on the front. Something in him ached, and he figured it was because it wasn’t actually
Tony continued to smile at him, then tilted his head. “So… what’s our next step, Steve? I’ll follow your lead.”
to be lonely. Steve, an artist, an alpha who liked lemon chiffon yellow and didn’t mind that Tony didn’t know how to do everything he necessarily needed to for life on the ranch.
“Be useful and take something up to my room,” Jan said imperiously. “But you might want to hurry if you don’t want to watch me smooching Hank.”
“Ugh, I don’t actually care,” Jan sighed loudly. “It was like listening to Hank talk about ants. I support your endeavors but after an hour you could stand to listening to me bitch about the price of cashmere.”
“I’m so sorry, Tony,” Susan repeated softly, mortified. “Reed shouldn’t have said that.”
Jan took a moment to cup his cheek, brush his hair off of his forehead, before she leaned down to press a kiss to his cheek. “We’ll get you out of here, Tony. One way or another, we’ll get you to Steve.”
“Hmm, always at least half of the letters she sends get answered,” Ana replied after some thought. “She’s also told me that she’s usually able to tell they won’t be a good match after a few letters, so she sends a letter telling them so, and she almost always gets a response thanking her for her time.”
Tony began to nod, a little dazed, before he realized what he’d been asked and blurted out, “Oh! I have a trunk, too. A wedding gift from a friend.” He looked up at Steve in concern. “It might have an anvil in it.”
Jarvis lifted his head to frown at her severely. “Ana, my dear, please don’t take this too personally, but that is the daftest thing I’ve ever been told. ‘Make me eat something I hate.’ Preposterous,” he muttered, returning to blotting the envelope in front of him.
“Oh, well, if you’re going shopping,” Tony began, trying to squeeze past Hank.
The hotel dining room was small but elegant, at least as much as it could be: clean white tablecloths, fresh flowers as table decorations, and polished silver. The wainscoting could stand to be repainted, and the paintings were somewhat faded from the sun, but Tony couldn’t be anything but charmed as he looked around, carefully setting himself down into the seat that Steve had pulled out for him.
Jarvis took the tray from her hand, frowning. He didn’t want her to drop it. She was excitable even on the best of days. Ana took the teacup from her other hand just in case.
we could do.”
“I’m sure he didn’t mean that to be as offensive as it came out,” Susan said hurriedly as Ben yanked Reed away before Jan could stab his eye out with her cocktail fork. “I’m sorry Tony. Please don’t let Jan stab Reed’s eye out.”
Tony curled his hand behind her neck to draw her further down and press their foreheads together. “Thank you, Jan. For everything.”
Jan was incredibly unimpressed. “I
“Ana!” Jarvis gasped, affronted.
“I’mb dying,” Tony sobbed.
Tony was thrown by the sudden change in direction and could only manage to utter an inelegant, “Huh?”
Tony nodded slightly. He knew that. He felt the same way for her. But sometimes he needed the comfort of being reminded. “Do you truly think I’m doing the right thing?”
“Ana,” Jarvis hissed, appalled, as he rushed after her. He paused in the doorway to give a slight bow and distracted ‘goodnight, sir’ before continuing after her. “Ana, I’ve already bought everything for fish and chips. I’m even brining the fish already. Ana your fish always come out dry. ANA. PLEASE.”
“Yes, well, I sort of picked a favorite early on,” Tony admitted, blushing a little and scratching at his cheek. “But there were a couple that I—thought could be very good friends, if you didn’t mind me continuing to correspond with them.”
“…I’ll bring a towel,” Jarvis said, and closed the door again.
Tony privately hoped that Jan would make Victor comfortable with physical affection. He knew that she wouldn’t really give Victor a choice in the matter of accepting it.
you to take some time to consider it.”
Tony took a deep breath, then turned, feeling vulnerable and brave all at once as he looked up to meet the alpha’s gaze. “Steve?”
“…A butler,” Steve repeated, and now he looked bewildered.
“But I wouldn’t be dangerous,” Tony pointed out. “You’d be the murderer in this scenario, not me.”
“Alphas, honestly,” Tony sneered, and went back over to Jan with a huff.
Jim’s lips twitched as if he couldn’t tell whether he wanted to laugh or not. “Steve? Do you—do you mean Steve
The ticket man became visibly nervous and handed Tony his ticket. “Have a pleasant trip. One of the porters will take your trunk.”
Finally, Tony sighed, frowning. “You’re making me sound like a tart.”
“Um,” Steve began, apparently startled. He blinked down at Tony, thinking hard, before he finally said, “Well, we’ll need to start heading back to the house soon. It’s a few hours’ ride out.”
Steve dragged the trunk down the steps, propped one side up on the back of the wagon, then lifted the other to slide it in. It looked like it took no effort at all. Tony swallowed thickly and tried very hard not to think about it, but he found that very hard when Steve dusted his hands off with a few quick claps. He wondered if it would be inappropriate to take Steve’s arm again, even though he hadn’t offered it.
For the matter of children, well… He… He could probably… Tony had never really thought about children. He could admit he’d been too afraid to do it. Up until now, any children he had would be the result of… coupling… with Ezekiel. He hadn’t wanted to speculate what it would mean, in any terms—how the bedding would have happened, how he would have to suffer congratulations over the hypothetical child, how he’d fear for his child under Obadiah and Ezekiel’s thumbs.
“Ana,” Edwin said, scolding. “Don’t destroy the paper before Anthony gets to read it!”
Steve stared back at him blankly, then said, “I don’t feel used. I don’t feel used at all. You were upfront about your lack of knowledge and skills about working on the range. Someone just trying to escape would lie. All you talked about was wanted to learn.” He paused, frowning, then asked, “That’s not the end of the story though, is it?”
Steve nodded. “Okay. Come on. I’ll put your bags in the wagon and then grab it.”
“Janet!” Jarvis exclaimed, appalled.
“Jan,” Tony sighed, rolling his eyes, then yelped when she shoved him toward one of the changing screens set up in her room. “Jan!”
he would be pleased if you asked for more drawings.”
Tony scowled. “What, you think I can’t do it?”
Somehow, something in Tony settled with Jim’s reassurance. He was still frightened, of course—he probably would be until well after they were married, until Obadiah would no longer have a claim on him. But he was no longer scared that Steve would change his mind about him when he saw him, or that they wouldn’t be a good match when they met in person. Jim was just a bystander, so his views were probably at least a little flawed, but he’d admitted that when he’d talked to him. He was an outsider to Tony, too, but he’d thought they’d be good for each other. That had to mean something, didn’t it?
Tony moaned again, curling up on his side. “How much rum did you put in that daiquiri?”
Tony did nothing but nod, because he didn’t want to make Victor more uncomfortable. He’d always seemed a little cold, but with the knowledge that he’d been kept from close friendships as a child for fear of kidnapping, it made a little more sense why he was… the way he was. Instead, he said, “I was surprised to get your telegram.”
Jan—jumped in before anyone else could say anything, sobbing, “Daddy, they were going to go through all of my things! They broke my dress form and—oh, Daddy, I’ve never been so humiliated in my whole life! And now I’m going to be late to the train and Victor’s going to be so upset!”
had friends who gave me money like that.”
“Jan,” Tony whispered, then bit his knuckle nervously.
Jan frowned at him severely, in the same way she frowned at him when she thought he asked foolish questions about her fabric choices right before she changed his life with a new suit. “Tony,” she said, voice dripping with derision. “How would you have survived without me?”
Jarvis politely rammed his shoulder into him to push him away. “Even an uncle should not rip the bed clothes off an omega in his own room,” he told Obadiah primly.
“I don’t know,” Vernon admitted. “But I’ll buy as much time as I can, Janet.”
He nearly bashed into Samantha in his hurry to get inside Jan’s room. “Oh! Samantha! I’m so sorry!”
Like courting him aggressively even after Tony had asked him to stop.
really sorry about Reed, Tony,” Susan insisted one last time, voice soft. “That was so humiliating, I—”
Jarvis smiled a little, not turning from the dough, allowing her the privacy to get her bearings again. “You gave that back to him, you know. Not me, not Jan, not even Steven—you’re the one who suggested writing letters. You gave him his freedom again.”
Ana and Jan tiptoed out from behind the cellar door as well, Ana holding a bottle of wine. Jan slipped over to the table and picked up the letter with gentle fingers. Ana left them to it, walking over to cut up some oranges, grapefruit, and apples to dump into a pitcher with the bottle of red wine.
Tony froze, not just from the terror of being found, but because there was now a very,
Susan still looked unhappy. “I’m going to set him straight. Don’t worry.”
Tony couldn’t help but sag a little, both depressed and mortified. Even people who didn’t know him felt sorry for him.
“I’m indisposed,” Tony whispered. The light from the hallway was making his head pound again, and his stomach lurched as he squeezed his eyes shut.
“Oh, thank you, Victor. I mostly just said that so they’d be gentle with Tony,” Jan said, getting up to check her trunks. “But I really appreciate it anyway! I’ll take you up on that offer, don’t you worry!”
Hank’s expression conveyed that he wouldn’t allow Jan to drive within city limits either, but he wasn’t stupid enough to say the words. “Alright.”
Tony frowned, brow furrowing. “And it’s done after ten minutes?”
Instead, he focused on mechanically opening the other letters, reading them, setting them aside in piles for continued correspondence or piles for sympathetic apologies saying, ‘I feel we’re not a good match.’ There were plenty of other alphas and betas who were kind enough to him. He had options to fall back on.
“The yellow washes you out, but the red makes you look delectable,” Ezekiel added, reaching out for him.
“You wouldn’t have to deal with Ezekiel anymore,” Jan pointed out.
“Anthony,” Jarvis said gently, coming over to place his hand on his back. “Come here.”
Tony waited until the car had roared past the gates before he called out, “Thank you, Reed! You didn’t have to do this!”
Tony paused, hand hovering over where he’d just signed his name. Could he even really send these letters? Obadiah would probably look for him even after he was married, and he would be a fool not to have an eye out for any incoming mail for Jan. And Jan had left town with Victor, so Obadiah was probably keeping an eye on Victor’s mail, too. Tony frowned, trying to come up with someone he could send the letters to, but any time he thought of someone, he realized that he would either be putting them in danger because they were his known friends, or he didn’t actually trust them to hide his secret and get the letters to his friends.
Tony frowned down at his blank stationery for a long moment before lifting his pen, whispering a soft, almost embarrassed, “Dear Steve.” He hesitated, then set the letter aside again. He had to think a little more, even though he was pretty sure of his answer. Perhaps he’d come up with the words he needed as he thought about it. He reached out for the book Jarvis had brought him instead, flipping it open to the first page.
“Stop it,” Tony hissed, blushing, and snatched the envelope back.
“Society omegas and betas might find that romantic, too,” Ana said thoughtfully. “Especially if Janet hammed it up a bit. ‘He was so passionate about teaching the children out west, how could I say no,’ or something like that.”
“Sir, if your engagement falls through,” Samantha began, then stopped, and instead reached out to grab his hands. She gave them a squeeze, looking deeply upset, before fleeing the room.
be faster if he had help. And he supposed he could always play the wounded omega if he needed to get away—people
“…Mm,” Susan agreed after a moment. “That’s true. Make sure to get a good look at Raven’s dress! She’s done something with charmeuse, and I want your opinion on whether or not I can pull it off.”
Ana paused, then slowly sat on the edge of the bed. “Yes, Anthony?”
Victor coughed and looked away from them, cheeks going pink as he snatched his hand back. “Father asked me to visit Aunt Agatha at some point while I was here. It’s not putting me out at all.”
“I wouldn’t know. I wasn’t allowed many friends because the chances of being kidnapped were so high,” Victor said coolly, and then frowned. “Anthony, what is on your face?”
“She has a niece that she’d send marriage ads to in Hungary. She said that I should answer them, too. That way, at least, I’d have a choice,” he added, voice soft. “And I hadn’t had a choice in so long. It hurt to hide away the pieces of myself that seemed important. I’m Tony Stark. It’s a name in the echelons of high society. But I couldn’t tell anyone that for fear that word would get back to Obadiah. I knew that if he found out I was trying to leave, he’d make it impossible for me to do so.” He paused there, letting the information hang, the fact that he’d held things back.
Well. He couldn’t put it off forever.
“I need a pan,” Tony blurted out, jerking into a sitting position.
“Ow! All you had to do was say something!” Tony exclaimed, rubbing his arm.
“Yes, ma’am,” Ben said agreeably, and Tony assumed that Reed was about to get the scolding of his life as he was dragged away.
“Yes,” Jan agreed solemnly. “So I will make him sweat.”
Jan burst in immediately, still holding the cup of tea and the tray with bread and jam. Jarvis and Ana stumbled in after her. Tony stared at them, surprised, and then rolled his eyes. It had been foolish of him to believe they’d go too far when he’d been reading Steve’s letter.
Tony stared at her, uncomprehending, before letting out a mortified groan. “Oh no!” It must have happened when he tried to muffle his yelp after he crushed his sandwich in his hand. He looked down at his hands. They were also covered in mayonnaise. “Oh…”
Jarvis jerked the door open and poked his head back inside. “I forgot all about cottage pie!”
Tony remembered the exact expression she was talking about, when Ezekiel had been his slimy self and asked Jan out on a date even though he was supposed to be exclusively pursuing Tony, per his father’s orders. Janet never suffered fools and egotists, and he was both, so she was half as patient already. The dumbfounded look on his face when she’d said she was currently accepting the courtship of an
Jan was quiet for several minutes, so long that Tony frowned and was about to ask the operator if the line had been lost.
Tony couldn’t help giggling in amusement. “No,” he said once he’d regained composure, and clarified, “Jan. Why do you call her ‘Janice?’”
Jarvis took over kneading the dough as Ana began putting groceries away. “Did you hear that?” he asked softly.
He was so wrapped up in thinking that he almost missed Steve’s sharp intake of breath. He remembered with sudden clarity how frank he’d been in the letter and couldn’t help flushing in embarrassment. Maybe he’d been
Tony cleared his throat and busied himself taking a sip of the drink Ana shoved at him as well. Oh good. She’d put bourbon in it too. He was going to get gloriously drunk before noon and then he’d be too ill to go to the party he was expected at. Anything to avoid Ezekiel, and it would have the added bonus of making him forget Steve’s letter.
It was time someone finally allowed Tony to make his own decisions, too.
“I don’t want you to pay me,” Jan sighed, rolling her eyes, and shoved the changing screen aside. She ignored his embarrassed yelp and instead reached out to smooth his jacket over his shoulders, frowning thoughtfully as she tugged at the cuffs and then tucked a pocket square into his jacket that matched his shirt. After a few more seconds of primping him, she took a step back, giving him a firm pat on the shoulder. “Go look at yourself and eat your words to me.”
“Obadiah is a war,” Jarvis cut in solemnly, making Tony shut his mouth against what he was about to say. When the omega looked up at him in confusion, he quietly explained, “He will wage a quiet war against you until you have no choice but to marry his son, Anthony. He will spin his web like a cunning little spider, pulling threads until you give in. Until you are only a husk of your former self, until you have no will left to fight, just to let things happen as they may.
All he had to say was ‘Reed told me’ and one of the caterers made a face and pulled a flask from beneath the table. “Say no more, dear,” she said. “Hope you like gin.”
“That sounds nice,” Tony admitted to himself quietly, and decided that if he didn’t get a husband out of this, at least he might get some friends. “How am I supposed to make myself look favorable though? ‘Omega with no money and no skills’ isn’t very attractive. I don’t want to seem like I’m hiding that from them.”
, and
“Henry is courting someone, unfortunately,” Jan said apologetically.
“Janet, return to the vehicle,” Vernon growled.
Ezekiel’s face did something ugly before settling on anger as well, and Tony felt a real thrill of fear when the alpha grabbed his shoulders and gave him a little shake. “You listen to me, you spoiled brat,” he growled. “
“Some people cry when they’re relieved,” Jarvis explained quietly, lifting one hand to lightly scratch over the omega’s back, like he had when Tony cried as a child. “And I’m sure you’re very happy, Anthony. But you’ve had a terrible burden on you ever since your parents passed, whether you knew it or not. Now freedom is so close you can taste it. You’re crying years of terror out, my dear boy.”
“That’s all?” Tony asked, unable to help feeling disappointed. He couldn’t possibly make a roast every day. Although… he supposed it would help him practice…
. He covered his face for a moment with a squeak, trying to get hold of his emotions. Then he remembered the drawing and perked up. If he could just see what Steve looked like, even in the vaguest sense–
to be Victor’s friend, after all, hadn’t he? And since Victor hadn’t grown up with any close omega friendships, perhaps this was all he knew to do to show affection. “He’s… very, very rich,” he finally explained.
Ana blinked at him in surprise, but then her expression softened, and she leaned down to press another kiss to his forehead. “If you want, dear.”
“Oh, Hank hates these parties,” Jan sniffed in disdain. “But you know him. He prefers being by himself in a lab than making small talk. Alphas are such boors. How they’d manage without us, I don’t know.” She tilted her head thoughtfully before adding, “Also now I’ll be able to be by your side so Ezekiel won’t have a chance at putting his hands on you. I’m pretty sure even that dolt can understand how willing I am to put him in the ground.”
. Tony got the impression that he was kind. He wasn’t so sure about this… swearing problem that Steve had, but… he supposed if he got kicked by a steer, he’d swear a lot too.
If you’re wondering why Tony is so weak here: This society omega was never allowed to do anything physically strenuous in his life. Rest assured, on the ranch, he will be required to do some heavy lifting, and he will love it. (And Steve will also love it.)
drive yourself. But you always do it so fast.”
“I’m sure it’s a very handsome suit,” Hank said, and then, “Probably some daring color that I would never wear. I should thank you for that—she’s so busy making clothes for you that she doesn’t have time to make more than one suit every once in a while for me.”
Jan leaned back to sniff and frowned up at him, brows furrowed together as she whispered, “I’m so angry that this is happening to you, Tony, and there’s nothing any of us can do.”
“Will you need a driver today, sir?” Jarvis asked, trying to pretend he wasn’t glancing at his wife in concern and failing miserably.
“I assure you that your letters to me were happily received without any extras, Tony,” Steve assured him, reaching down to clasp his hand again. “Quite happily.” He tipped his head back up the street. “How about we go see the preacher?”
“That’s why it’s awful, honey,” Jan scoffed. “It’s
“I’ll apologize later,” Jan replied dismissively. She sat at the table and reached out to take Tony’s hand. It was still shaking a little. “Tony,” she said softly, eyes going soft and dewy. “Take some time to yourself with this. Just think about it really carefully, alright? Are you upset because you’re seeing you could never make it out west, or… because you’re scared you could do better out there than you ever could here?”
Reed raised an eyebrow. “You mean anyone other than you.”
“Jan,” Tony said chidingly.
Holy Moses. What the hell had Jan put in the trunk!?
The ceremony was quick, quiet, and relatively painless, except for the fact that when the preacher had said ‘you may now kiss your bride,’ both Steve and Tony had stared at each other in dismay. Finally, though, Steve had leaned down to press a kiss to his forehead, and Tony had responded in kind with a kiss to the cheek.
Jarvis cupped his cheeks, hands fluttering as if he didn’t know where to touch, how to convey how much he loved him. “You’ve grown into a fine young man, Anthony,” he finally said, then leaned in to press a kiss to his forehead.
Tony looked at her, mouth opening and closing uselessly, before he threw back the rest of his glass of punch.
“Dear,” Ana cut in sharply.
The alpha smiled even as he quirked a brow at him. “Now, I’m not doubting you, but where I come from there are some pretty proud omegas, so I’m used to being told someone doesn’t need help even though they really, really do.”
“Yes, well, most of Janet’s designs are,” Tony said, trying covertly to look for Jan again, grip on the glasses tightening so much he feared for their structural integrity. He wished fervently that Jan would sense his distress and come rescue him.
“You have skills,” Jarvis scoffed, offended on his behalf. “If nothing else, you could be a tutor. You know your maths quite handily, and reading and writing, and you keep up on what’s going on in the scientific world. You speak French beautifully.” He paused, thoughtful. “…If you can’t find a husband, perhaps you could find a job as a teacher. I’m sure Ms. Van Dyne wouldn’t mind spotting you some money to get out west.”
Jarvis stopped rubbing his back, but he let his hand linger, and Tony was certain it wasn’t his imagination that his hand was shaking. “I’m sure you will.”
“We love you, Tony,” Ana said softly, giving his hand a squeeze.
Tony giggled to himself as Ana shouted back, “Well your chips are garbage!” He knew they’d make up before they went to bed. They always did. They might bicker, but it was all in good fun. They knew their strengths and tried to cover each other’s weaknesses. Ana couldn’t cook very well, so Jarvis did it instead. Jarvis wasn’t always great at shedding his duties and being the comfort Tony needed, so Ana stepped in to hug him instead. Hopefully, he and Steve could gain a rapport like that, helpful and playful and snarky, with no real heat.
“You’re welcome,” Hank replied, smiling at her.
“No need to be sorry. It’s not as if I didn’t have friends who shared your sentiments,” Tony answered hurriedly. “So—Obadiah has a son. And I’m sure he wanted to keep control of me and my family’s fortune, so he made sure everyone knew that his son was going to marry me. Other alphas learned not to show interest in me, because Obadiah would go out of his way to ruin them. I was beginning to despair of ever getting out of the marriage when Ana—Jarvis’s wife—told me that there might be something I could do yet to escape them.
“If he’s your fiancé, I guess it’s okay,” Jarvis grumbled. “And he’s sent you drawings, so. …Never mind,” Jarvis muttered, and fled so politely that if Tony hadn’t known better, he wouldn’t have thought Jarvis was trying to escape anything at all.
“He said that he bought a tie from her in Budapest and immediately fell in love with her,” Tony replied, trailing his finger around the rim of his glass before plucking out a slice of orange. “The way Ana tells it, she saw this tall Englishman and thought his accent was cute when he tried to say ‘thank you’ in Hungarian.”
Tony sighed. “The one time your beau could have helped me out and his friend had to go and—ow! Jan!”
“Edwin, don’t be such a stuffed shirt,” Ana teased, but Jarvis began walking for the door. “Honey! Please be reasonable!”
Jan gave Victor a severe frown. “Except that it’s not my name, Victor.”
“Oh, well, I… I guess I enjoy adventures, or science fiction,” Tony offered, hoping the books she picked out wouldn’t be too sticky.
Jarvis frowned. “I’ll think on it some more, Anthony.”
“This is so many letters,” he sighed, leaning his chin on his hand. His ‘no’ pile was woefully small.
Tony looked up when he heard a knock on the door, managing a soft ‘come in.’ He knew he was too overwhelmed to do more, too likely to crack and burst into fresh tears if he said anything more.
Tony laughed a little, then groaned as his stomach lurched. “Oh, I’m actually going to die.”
Tony hesitated.
He covered his mouth to muffle his startled, pained yelp as the trunk was dropped on the ground, wondering if all luggage was treated like this or if it was just because they thought someone was in it.
Jan leaned her cheek against the top of his head and gave him an extra tight squeeze, as if knowing he wanted the comfort. Tony couldn’t help but despair a little. What would he do without Jan?
“Oh,” Tony said, beginning to stand, before all the strength left him at once and he slumped back down. He clutched the letter to his chest. “Oh, oh, oh. Oh my God. Jan. Jan?” He turned toward the door, voice cracking as he shouted, “Jan?!”
chose.” She smirked. “Remember, omegas and betas of high society still love romance, and won’t it be
’” Victor said, looking dismayed. “Never your full name-!”
Steve turned back to him, still looking vaguely embarrassed even as he smiled, rubbing the back of his head. “Well, I suppose up here on the platform
Tony stared up at him, stunned at the admission, before he finally threw his head back to laugh, loud and long, at the idea of anyone being able to cow someone as big and strong as Steve simply because he brought his intended omega into his home without marrying him first.
Tony tipped his head, acknowledging. “Well, I’m sure whoever it was you threw deserved it,” he decided after a moment. Then he smiled at Jim again. “Thank you for your help, Jim. I appreciate it.”
Tony listened to a door open and close, the sound of several pairs of feet walking away under the noise of the train wheels. He closed his eyes and breathed in, counted to ten, and let the breath back out.
“Not that I was ever made to eat any,” Hank added hastily, glancing at Jan.
Ana tilted her head, still gazing off into the distance. “Hmm?”
“Good luck,” Tony told her, amused, and lifted the champagne flutes. “Well! Can’t say you skimped on the giggles, Susan.”
Tony tried to say something, but all that came out was a somewhat squeaky and hysterical snort.
“Look, I don’t—I’ve got my eye on someone already and so anyone compared to her is just sorta… background noise,” Jim explained hastily. “Steve’s not… bad looking. He doesn’t set my teeth on edge when I talk to him but I’m pretty sure that’s because he once saw me pitch someone out of the saloon.”
“No problem, sir. If you need help, don’t hesitate to call on us again!”
“And I’ll buy you a new dress form in Maine, Janice,” Victor added. “I had no idea leaving your own home would be so treacherous.”
Jan roared, and Tony squeaked and hung up the phone immediately, giggling.
“I’ll help you pick out a bottle,” Jarvis replied magnanimously, and ushered both she and his wife into the wine cellar.
He hadn’t been planning on it, but he was feeling low, and Jan had always been able to take his mind off of things when he was feeling too overwhelmed about them. Besides… she was really the only other person outside of Jarvis and Ana who would sympathize with him instead of chiding him for not trusting his guardian more. Jan had been begging him to come over to try on some of the new suits she’d designed, anyway.
“Nice to meet you,” Jim replied, either missing or choosing to ignore his hesitation. “Do you have a chaperone or something? I don’t think I’ve seen an omega traveling alone. Not one who wasn’t wearing mourning clothes.”
Tony managed to flash him a small smile at the praise for Jarvis, but it quickly faded as he tried to figure out how to continue his explanation. “My father had another friend, Obadiah, and I trusted him to look after my finances. He was my father’s business partner, after all. It made sense. It wasn’t until later, when I became of age, that I realized I couldn’t regain control of my fortune or have it transferred over to Jarvis. Obadiah had gotten it too tangled up in his dealings. If I forced the issue, he could have simply said he lost it on the market. So I—I have money. I just have no way of obtaining it. The law says that since he’s my guardian on paper, it’s his right to control it until I find a husband.”
But with Steve… Steve had said that if Tony didn’t really want to have children, that that was okay. That was more than most alphas would allow. And it wasn’t like he was… opposed to children. Just… to children with Ezekiel. Steve seemed like a good, kind man. Tony thought perhaps that Steve would… would be a good father. And perhaps he himself might be a good mother, with a supportive mate instead of a selfish one. And of course, after all, Steve had only asked to discuss it. They were still going to get to know each other after he arrived in Timely.
Tony looked up at him, immediately curious. “You have? What is it like there?” Steve hadn’t really talked about Timely except to tell him it was full of good people and that he went there for supplies, but he’d obviously tried to make it sound good, to put Tony at ease. Jim was an impartial stranger, though, so his view of it might be more realistic.
Steve stared at him for a moment, stunned, then pulled his hand out of his pocket so he could lay it across Tony’s. “Yeah,” he said breathlessly. “Yeah, that sounds good to me.”
“I think the man searching my trunk did it,” Tony admitted.
“…Mr. Jarvis frightens me,” Jan admitted once she was sure he was gone.
Tony sat at Jan’s desk and clasped his hands in his lap to try and stop them shaking. He didn’t want Jan to see how upset he was. She’d doubtlessly demand to know why, and he’d never been good at lying to her. She’d probably go and interrogate the maids for more information. There was no reason to worry about that now. He was engaged to marry Steve. And if… if somehow it did fall through, the beta he’d been corresponding with had volunteered to house him on the west coast. He wasn’t trapped here.
Tony couldn’t help but fall limp in relief. If Jan was being pleasant, he had nothing to worry about.
Tony ducked his head to try and hide his pleased flush. “Yes, I did,” he agreed. He couldn’t wait to get to know Steve better.
Was this the end? Had he celebrated too early? Had Obadiah and whoever he’d hired found them? He tried to become one with the bottom of the trunk and wondered if he should stay still when it opened to lull them into a false sense of security or if he should lunge up and start swinging as soon as it unlocked.
curious. Even if he was scared.
“Very well, sir,” Jarvis began, only to squawk as Obadiah shoved past him anyway.
“You’re blushing,” Jan said, smirking, and when Tony ducked his head, mortified, she crowed again, “You’re bluuushing!”
Tony looked up at him, opening his mouth to say something, but he had no idea what. He looked back down at Steve’s letter, closing his mouth, and reached out for it, taking it carefully in two hands. Such an unassuming piece of paper had no right to hold his future so precariously inside of it.
I have him murdered?”
“I’m going to make you wear my awful Midnight Rose perfume,” Jan warned.
Victor pulled out his handkerchief and began wiping at Tony’s hands before he could do anything else. “And your shirt is ripped, too.”
“No, I still have the thermos and sandwiches you gave me.”
“A present?” Ana asked, sounding surprised. “What kind of present?”
“I mean, I doubt I will,” Steve repeated with a shrug. Somehow, though, it didn’t come across as flippant.
And his eyes… They were so deeply, stunningly blue. Tony couldn’t bring himself to look away, staring up at them in awe. He’d never seen such blue eyes.
“I can’t imagine you’ll say anything I can’t live with, but alright,” Steve agreed reluctantly, looking up as the waitress came back to take their orders.
so happy.”
“Tony,” Jan barked, but he couldn’t understand what she said next because the driver was laughing so hard.
Jarvis didn’t call him a baby. He was too professional for that.
Tony waited until she was gone again before he took a deep breath, clasping his hands in his lap to keep from fidgeting too much. “Let me figure out where to start,” he sighed, frowning. “You know my parents passed away, of course—”
“…Why wouldn’t he just send a letter,” Tony whispered after a moment. “It would have been cheaper to get a personal messenger than pay for this telegram.”
“Tony!” Jan cried as soon as he pushed the door to Reed’s car open, running to embrace him. “I’m sorry! If I’d known Ezekiel was there, I never would have—”
Vernon nodded and took the bags from him, carrying them inside before one of the maids could scurry out and try and grab them first. If one of the maids slammed the door harder than she usually did as soon as he was inside, he decided not to mention it, frowning when he found his daughter and her friend curled up on the couch in the den. He’d known that Jan and Tony had hatched some sort of plot to foil Obadiah Stane, but he’d never thought that it would come to this.
Tony frowned, thumbs rubbing over the fabric. The cut wasn’t the same, but it was a deep indigo color. Maybe that would look better on him. He turned to face the mirror and began to put it on.
“Now if you heard that story from somebody else,” Ana said gently. “You would think it was incredibly romantic, wouldn’t you?” When Tony stayed silent, she gave his shoulder the gentlest of squeezes. “It’s just as romantic as the start that Edwin and I had, that your parents had, that Janet is having with her beau. You don’t realize it, because it’s so new, and not at all what you expected, but you’ll look back, and you’ll realize how beautiful and sweet it really was.”
“I reread your letters a lot,” Steve admitted, smiling bashfully, and lifted his hand to rub the back of his head. “My friends have been teasing me since I got your first letter. I’m sure if we’d been apart much longer, I would have worn the paper out.”
a pretty silly place to stand around.” He glanced at the letter in his hand somewhat regretfully, then carefully slid it into his pocket. “Let’s go to the hotel and get something to eat. Are these your bags?”
Tony grabbed her sleeve before she could pull away entirely. “Ana?”
Tony sighed, frowning, and ran his thumb over the corner of one of the envelopes before he finally decided that he probably wouldn’t be able to send them until well after he was married. He turned to put the letters back into his bag and paused when he saw an envelope he didn’t recognize. He picked it up, surprised to feel something heavy inside it, then carefully pulled the flap open and looked inside.
Tony kept his head buried under the pillow for a while, thinking, before he carefully pushed himself to the edge of his bed and opened the drawer in his bedside table to pull out the drawings Steve had sent him. There was the clear night sky, and there was the retired cattle dog Lucky, and there was the steer that Steve kept watchful eye over until they went to market. It was terribly romantic, wasn’t it, that Steve sent him these drawings? And he’d been so worried, too, that they wouldn’t be good enough for him.
Tony curled closer to her, pressing his shins against her back gently, relishing the extra contact as she gently began to rub the base of his skull. “I do.”
Tony couldn’t help but swallow at the thought of Jarvis and Ana, wondering if the hurt would ever fade. “Yes,” he answered. “Let’s start there. I suppose that’s how we ended up here, after all.” He took another deep breath. “I can understand if you change your mind after this, Steve.”
“I love gin!” Tony told her happily. “Put more in mine.”
“Timely,” he finally answered. If Jim was also leaving the station, he’d probably not come into contact with anyone looking for him, anyway.
“One of these days I’m going to find out why Victor calls me that,” Jan hissed, even as she carefully ripped the telegram open. “It’s gone too far to be a friendly joke. He doesn’t even shorten it to call me ‘Jan.’”
Also sorry for all the exposition I swear next chapter will have more action.
Jarvis poked his head in. “Sir, the Stanes are here. They wish to see you.”
They didn’t make it very far, but then, Tony hadn’t really expected them to. Obadiah had probably already had a handful of crooked cops in his pocket even before Tony fled his home with the Jarvises and hidden out at the Van Dyne estate. Obadiah was probably saying something about an omega who had run away from home, who he was “so afraid” for because he had no money, had probably even told them that he was being manipulated and held against his will. Of course they were going to search any vehicle coming out from or going into Jan’s house.
“I need to be alone,” Tony answered immediately, and fled to the sounds of Jarvis, Ana, and Jan calling after him worriedly.
Reed was blessedly silent. Tony listened to the roar of the engine and imagined it was a bit like how his feelings sounded now—loud, and angry, but continually chugging forward. He whispered a ‘thank you’ that couldn’t be heard over the engine when Reed handed him a handkerchief to wipe the tears from his face.
“Through the first stretch,” Jan allowed. “Do you need anything before we get to the station?”
put anyone in danger of being arrested or put on Stane’s bad side.”
“It would,” Tony admitted, burying his face into her soft, clean hair. He took a deep breath and let it back out in a sigh, because how often growing up had he looked at Jan and thought the same thing? That if only he was an alpha, she wouldn’t have to put up with everything that she did? He wondered if it was the same for everyone that was born an omega.  “It would. I’m sorry, Jan.”
Tony hugged the letter to his chest and took a few deep breaths, blinking tears out of his eyes. It didn’t matter. He had other options. He liked Steve, but he didn’t really
Steve’s glare immediately softened. “Tony…”
speed,” Tony pointed out, and laughed when Ana pursed her lips at him severely.
Tony fiddled with the ads again, shoulders hunching. There were so many things he wanted to say, but… none of it really mattered, did it? His parents were dead, and Obadiah had control of all of his money, and there was nothing he or Jarvis or Ana could do about it.
Tony covered his mouth to smother a slightly hysterical giggle. “I was not!”
Tony dipped his head, pleased and embarrassed and overwhelmed. Steve had called him brave before, too, but somehow it felt much nicer in person. “I… I think I should lay everything out for you, so that you can make a more informed decision,” he finally said, because Steve might have understood the barest bones of who he was, but it was only fair that Steve knew what he was getting into before they married, especially if Obadiah ever tracked him down and tried to drag him back home.
“Charmeuse!” Jan gasped. “In that shade of blue?! I wonder if she can tell me where she bought it…”
know that. But Ezekiel thinks you’re joking.”
Jan was silent for several minutes before she said, “I suppose it’s a small price to pay for your safety, Tony.”
Tony stared at the bag a little longer, the very idea of it filling him with dread, and it wasn’t even his problem. “Oh,” he said weakly. “If you’re sure…”
are. You’re not,” Jan said, smiling mischievously.
Tony frowned, brows furrowing together as he thought about it. If someone asked him how he met Steve… what
think Steve would find you even more attractive if he thought you were dangerous.”
Tony laughed, then groaned when his stomach lurched again. “Oh my God.”
Jan cackled and lunged at him, fingers dancing along his sides, and then squealed when he gave back as good as he got.
Tony hummed agreeably, laying his head on his arms as he thought about his parents. They’d met in Italy, when Howard had been cheeky, and Maria had been unimpressed. Howard had sworn that he would impress her. Maria had promised that nothing he did would. And then six months later they’d gotten married. Maria had told stories about their courtship. Howard was apparently the typical blockhead alpha, but in the moments where he was soft and sweet, she fell in love with him.
Tony shrugged a little, helpless, because growing up he’d always known that Jarvis had not been ‘just a butler,’ but that had also been the only way he’d referred to himself. “I’m not entirely sure how they met or how the relationship ended it up as it did. I know that my father rescued both Jarvis and his wife from Hungary during a war somehow, and Jarvis remained loyal to him thereafter. They’d always taken care of us, and when my parents died, he and his wife just… continued taking care of me.”
Tony was pleased to hear that. He probably could have dealt with Steve being a little territorial, but knowing that he wasn’t settled some of his anxiety. He turned to look at Jim, intrigued. “Jim, is Steve handsome?”
Jarvis ran his fingers through his hair again, eyes soft and fond and sad. “You’ve laughed more in the past few months than you did in the rest of the time since your parents died. There’s a lightness in you now.”
“You know the Stanes, Edwin,” Ana said shakily as she looked up at him, allowing herself to show him the worry and fear she’d felt for so many years. “You’ve seen what they can do firsthand. How can you say it wouldn’t come to that?”
“I’m sorry,” Reed cut in before Tony could say anything, looking out the door nervously. “But we don’t have much time.”
Tony smiled back sadly, wanting to cry with her, but… sometimes he felt like he’d cried all his tears out already. He’d been surprised he’d had tears left to cry the night before, when it had been nailed home how hopeless everything was. He really couldn’t get control of his money without marrying Ezekiel, and then it would technically be Ezekiel’s money to control, and Ezekiel would always fold to whatever his father wanted.
“Come hold this lace for me,” Jan ordered, and waited for him to obey before asking, “What are you worried about?”
“We made it,” Tony whispered back, feeling watery with relief. He felt something poking at his pillow and moved it to reach out and delicately take the finger she’d pressed into his air hole, giving it a squeeze. “Jan, we made it.”
“I just—want to do everything right,” Steve admitted, turning toward him with a frown. “Especially after everything you told me. I don’t want to offend you, or hurt you, or—”
Once outside, the reality of the situation hit him. Ezekiel would doubtlessly come for him once he recovered, and he would be pissed. He’d ridden here with Jan in her father’s motorcar, but would the chauffeur take him without Jan? And where would he go? Home? Ezekiel would only follow him, getting madder and madder, and then he’d know the house so Tony wouldn’t even have a chance to hide from him. Jarvis and Ana wouldn’t have a
Steve flinched, turned just enough to toss an embarrassed glare over his shoulder, then looked back at Tony with an apologetic smile. “He’s right, I’m sorry—um, are you hungry? We could go to the hotel and get something to eat. It’s a long ride back to the ranch,” he added. He paused, then frowned, quietly adding, “Maybe you’d like to tell me about your sudden urgency to get here, too.”
Tony tucked the letter into an envelope, then paused. There was a possibility this could be his last letter to Steve that wasn’t a goodbye. It seemed so impersonal, even though its answer would be telling of whether or not a relationship could continue. Is this how he wanted what could possibly be his last letter to Steve to be? Just coldly impersonal, as if those previous letters hadn’t mattered? But he wanted to protect himself, too, in case what Steve answered was something he couldn’t offer him. He realized with a jolt that he’d started the letter with ‘dear’ instead of a more proper,
“I don’t know why I’m crying,” Tony whispered, even as he clung to her shirt so hard that his knuckles ached. “I’m relieved. I swear I am. I’m
Tony puffed his chest out proudly. “She can’t afford to kill me because I’m the only one who will listen to her talk about fabric for hours on end!”
Jan said, and he could almost see her derisive stare.
Jan sniffed some more, than hurriedly wiped her eyes, jaw setting with determination. “Well,” she said sharply, full of vim and vinegar again. “If I can’t do anything to help you out of the position you’re in, I can at least make you look good while you figure it out yourself.”
Tony’s hand shook when he wrote back to Steve. It was a simple letter, almost rude in its bracing candor, but he didn’t have the nerve for flowery language and burying his question in niceties now. He’d apologize when Steve rote back to him.
Jarvis made tea instead of coffee for him. Tony didn’t say anything, because clearly the man was just as upset as he was. He probably should have waited until he had some privacy to cry; crying in front of Jarvis was probably all the answer he needed for the unasked question of ‘is there anything to be done?’
“It’s not,” Tony answered, nodding, and felt his cheeks heat with shame. “Very few people knew about my plans, so when we became engaged, I couldn’t tell anyone. But Obadiah’s son, he cornered me at a party. Tried to force himself on me,” he added, ducking his head. “So I told him I was already engaged, and he was furious. Other partygoers had to help me escape him, and I holed up in my friend’s house for a few days until another friend came up with an idea to smuggle me out.
Well, Tony sighed, frowning. He supposed that could be true. Jan had always pouted when Hank had sent her letters, because they weren’t composed nearly as well as hers had been, but alphas were not often taught to write letters outside of for business. ‘Not everyone has the privilege of going off to finishing school, Tony,’ Ana had said only a touch reproachfully after he’d wrinkled his nose at the first letter he’d read. Tony gave the letter another long look before tucking it back into the envelope and setting it aside in his ‘continued correspondence’ pile.
“Very good,” the driver said. “I will pass by the police station on my way home to pick him up. Ms. Van Dyne, advise your luggage to stop giggling.”
handsome, because he never thought he would be so lucky.
“Hope you’re ready to read a lot abOUT GARDENING!” Tony called after her and smiled when she blew a raspberry at him before the door swung closed.
he was being insulted.
Jan opened her mouth to scoff an ‘of course,’ then stopped, frowning thoughtfully. After a few minutes, she tried again, answering, “Only a couple of the maids have seen it, and Hank. Hank thinks what’s happening to Tony is a bunch of b—”
“I think you’ll be good for him,” Jim added as he led Tony over to the steps leading onto the train. “And maybe he’ll be good for you, too. I wish you luck. And knowing it’s Steve, I’ll definitely come around for supper the next time I visit. He’s one of the most easygoing alphas I’ve ever met, so long as you’re not a bully.”
Tony flinched. He didn’t need reminding that Ana had fled from war and persecution. “Obadiah is no war,” he managed to say.
she laughed, snorting a little when she tried to stop.
happy about your engagement, sir.”
Janet’s tinny voice asked, concerned.
To her credit, Jan didn’t answer immediately. She pursed her lips as she thought, playing with the curls at the nape of his neck. Tony let his eyes drift closed, enjoying the gentle attention, even though he felt a dull ache when he remembered that his mother had done the same thing, card her fingers through his hair when she was thinking. He missed her.
“Ew!” Jan blurted out immediately. “Gross! He’s even worse than Ezekiel!” She grabbed the pitcher to fill his glass to the brim. “Drink up, honey.”
Jim scratched his chin thoughtfully. “Oh, you know, typical small town. Everyone knows everybody. You can only keep a secret if you don’t share it. I’ve only gone for short trips, so I don’t know much about the day-to-day, but somehow I’m always invited to tea with eligible omegas whenever I’m down there and they make the best cake.”
“Done,” the caterer said.
“Aim at either of the Stanes,” Ana said. “I hope it gets in their shoes.”
Jarvis frowned at her, looking simultaneously amused and disappointed. “That’s the problem. You
Tony winced, grinding his teeth together. “Uncle Obie,” he whispered.
“Right,” Jan said unhappily. “Well, here we go, Tony.”
Jarvis scooped up the few letters from new suitors to read and swept out of the room with a mild smile and nothing else.
Jarvis turned toward him sharply, sputtering, “You should always use your good stationery!”
“I’ll spot you the five dollars,” Jim told him, perhaps a bit more loudly than he might normally have if the ticket man and a few other curious travelers weren’t staring at him. He dropped some coins on the counter, staring the ticket man down.
