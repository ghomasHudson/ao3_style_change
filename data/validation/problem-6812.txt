Steve’s heartbeat echoed and thumped against his eardrums but that didn’t stop him as he rushed forward, finally feeling the missing warmth of Tony’s body within his grasp and he learned down to catch the brunet’s surprised gasp in-between his lips.
Steve raised their intertwined hands up to his lips and kissed the top of Tony’s hand which was still laced in between the blond’s fingers.
Students around the two who were still anxiously scanning the list for their names looked at the brunet in annoyance before backing off as Tony glared right back at them.
And somehow, Steve’s radiant smile managed to fill the coldness of the entire library with a sudden comforting warmth.
“I love him so much, and we’ve been such good friends — maybe even more at some times, — for so long that it hurts whenever I look at him and remember that he’s still not mine, yet. It pains me whenever I have to call out his name but I still can’t ever add the word, ‘love’, to any of the sentences that I say to him. Even in my dreams, I can never muster up the courage to admit my feelings for him and ironically, I suffer for it so fucking much, both in the real world and in my imagination.”
“Nah, I’m good, you can have it. After all, I’ve read it like a million times, already. One of my favorites, remember?”
The orchestra started cleaning their instruments and packing up as the remaining guests exited the ballroom and the castle. A few minutes later, the only people still standing in the ballroom were the castle’s maids and servants, Steve, and the stranger that had not dared to leave the prince’s side.
“I would do anything just to see him smile again, just to hear him laugh again, I would literally do anything.”
Steve shook his head and smiled him as he got up off the sofa, “Well, let’s get that sorted out then, shouldn’t we? Here, let me help you with that - no worries, I have plenty of time to help you get my kitchen cleaned up before dinner.”
, or slices of chocolate cake. As much as he regrets admitting it, Steve kind of started to miss those awful barbecue grill-outs that Bucky used to host once every two months. Extra well-done yet questionable meats sounded much better than the half-eaten pepperoni
“Well, guess what, Steve?” The genius raised an eyebrow as he beamed at the other. “Tonight, I get to be your angel. Sound good?”
“Language,” the genius chided his boyfriend in a mocking tone, as he climbed into the wobbly carriage awaiting them at the bottom of the Ferris wheel.
If the book that the genius was still holding had been housing a secret portal, in-between the creases of its chapters and pages, and magically teleported him into a whole new world where Steve actually wanted to take him out on a date, Tony didn’t want to go back to reality. This was unquestionably an unbelievable fairytale or some dumb teen-romance fiction, come true.
“That’s fucking amazing, Steve!” The brunet’s cheery voice cracked the cage his brain was already building around his burning chest.
It was probably unhealthy to be so colossally in love with someone this much — but if that’s what it takes, then Tony would unhesitatingly give his entire life if it meant he could never stop being so childishly in-love with Steve. It was honestly overwhelming how committed he was to the blond.
And if time suddenly stopped right here, at this moment, with Tony leaning against Steve’s side; not even a millimeter apart, and the genius’ hair sticky from the cotton candy that they were eating, — which just so happened to be the exact same shade of pink as the glowing, entrancing, magical clouds that were floating up in the sunset-sky, above their heads — Steve honestly wouldn’t care at all.
“We’re about to run through the choreography for ‘Satisfied’ one last time before we break for lunch,” Tony informed him with a huge smile. “Care to join us?”
“What’s got you in such a good mood, Steven?” His father, King Joseph, asked. “Were you thinking about Anthony again?”
Letting his imagination run wild, the blond sat down on the curb of the sidewalk and stared out at the blend of pinks, oranges, and yellows, beginning to fill in the void of the sky as speckles of stars danced and twinkled in the far distance, almost completely-invisible to the naked eye.
“I know,” He repeated, again. “I know I should’ve have went to go find him, but Rhodey just dismissed me every time I went over to Tony’s place to talk. He wouldn’t let me in, no matter what I did.”
The genius swore he had undeniably seen Steve’s neck and ears turn a little pink but shook it off once the tint of red had disappeared as fast as it had occurred.
“No!” Tony exclaimed, his whole body quivering. “This isn’t perfect because I just forced all of my feelings onto you and I didn’t even think about how you would react and—“
Steve ignored him and looked at Rhodey, “Uh, well, Rhodey… I don’t really know if I can even fit a personal chef into my schedule.”
“Oh honey, don’t fret,” His mother reassured him, her voice rapidly bouncing across the empty room as she sent a glare at the king. “Even if Tony is seeing another person right now, I’m positive he’ll fall for your charm and dazzling character, sooner or later.”
“I love you, so fucking much, you know that, right?” The brunet turned around, mumbling into Steve’s chest.
It was odd to see such a rich and famous person willingly help out his own personal chef to clean up his kitchen and frankly, Tony was still a little skeptic about Steve’s behavior but for some reason, the brunet just couldn’t shake off the realization that Steve Rogers was genuinely a good person. In fact, he’s probably one of the most down-to-Earth rich people that Tony’s ever met and Tony’s met a lot of rich
Pepper had been the one to find him outside of her complex’s front door; soaking wet, shivering in rain, and clutching what little belongings that he had managed to take with him at the last minute. His imagination could only picture the image that Pepper must have discerned before her that evening.
in the main entrance of Columbia University, his eyes widened as he read the very first name on the sheet of paper.
“Wh-what?!” Tony groaned as he buried his face into Rhodey’s chest. “Rhodey! Why would you give a millionaire my crappy, barely-have woken up
Tony quickly shaped his own wall of snow before rapidly forming snowballs and flinging them at Steve.
“That’s right.” The younger one laughed and began to walk backwards, his attention still turned towards Steve. “Look, I have to go now. I’ll talk to you later, Steve.”
“Steve — I’m so fucking sorry for evading you and trying to avoid you… I was just so scared of what you would think of me if you ever found out that I had this huge-ass crush on you. And I thought that if you did, you would probably leave and move to another kingdom, oceans away from me, and I didn’t want to lose you that way…”
At first glance, Tony saw that there was a piece of paper was stuck to the front of the red-hardback and he eagerly but carefully, scanned over its words.
“It is so on, Steve!” Tony hollered at his chuckling boyfriend who so happened to be hiding behind a mound of snow that he had built while he was on his jog earlier this morning, just so he could attack his boyfriend with snowballs from behind it later on in the day.
Steve, thanking the cosmos for blessing him with the perfection that stood in from of him and the new chance that he had just been granted, chuckled; his voice vibrating with love that erupted from the inside of his chest with every sound he made.
Although the library was often too quiet for his taste and full of college students with their textbooks stacked a mile high, Tony still found himself somewhat liking its calm but tense atmosphere.
sitting in his office and gently placed a glass container of food onto his desk. Bucky, who was previously leaning against Steve’s desk, perked up, swiftly picked up the fragile tub, and squinted his eyes, examining it and its contents closely.
Was it that big of a problem to the point that even Steve’s friends are noticing how blatantly apparent it was that Tony had fallen stupidly in love with the blond?
“I’m not sure what it is exactly, but…” Steve hesitated. “It’s just this…this absolute bliss that emerges from my heart and my guts whenever I’m around him, it feels so comforting. It’s like he’s subtlety rocking my heart back and forth without even realizing it, but it just feels so right.”
As the blond quickly scanned the unofficial "Broadway-Backwards" casting list that was tacked upon a bulletin board
Steve happily complied and dragged his lips down the side of his boyfriend’s beautiful face, leaving behind a trail of tingles and absolute euphoria upon the brunet’s skin, and settled his mouth right on top of Tony’s “sweet-spot” which the blond could find from pure instinct and memory — right under the the genius’ jawline on the left side of his neck.
Normally, at this time of the evening, Steve and Tony would be cuddling and studying for their university classes together; the two of their limbs tangled collectively in a mess on Tony’s apartment floor, which Steve had just recently moved into. As nice as it was, for Tony to be able to be in his boyfriend’s presence as they caught up on their assignments together, it was even better that they finally got the chance to spend some time together without the sole purpose of studying for a test or working on an academic project. It was about time for the couple to take a break from the constant burden that the Ivy-Leagued, Columbia University kept piling onto their shoulders.
“Thank you, Tony.” The buff, thunderous god cheekily grinned before moving on to place more bundles of mistletoe under other doorways. “I’ll take them down on Christmas Morning!”
“I-I’m so sorry, Tony,” He almost collapsed in his own sheer culpability as his voice rasped out a guilty apology and his vision began to cloud up with tears. “I didn’t mean to do that—I… I have to go…”
“Okay, Tones,” Rhodey said. “I think it’s almost time for dinner for Steve - we’ve just eaten lunch after all - why don’t you start getting started on it? Plus, I’ve got to leave for that new art exhibition, anyways.”
“Oh, right. I forgot,” The stranger recalled. “We were supposed to take off our masks hours ago, weren’t we?”
“Do you see how many people are crowded around that thing?” Tony raised his eyebrow at the blond. “This is so dumb to post a piece of paper as the official casting list, why couldn’t they just personally email us? I’m not going in there until all these people start to leave.”
Once the final song of the evening started to play, Steve and the brunet slowly soared throughout the ballroom, capturing the curiosity of the people around them as the whole castle seemed to watch them dance. The two of them took each of their steps gracefully during the orchestra’s performance, and gave no thought to the crowd that parted and gave way to their waltz. They passed by jealous onlookers and interested royal families as they maintained their artistic and fluid composure until the very last second of the musical piece.
Suddenly, the grand clocktower that resided in the tallest tower of the Americandian castle, rung deafeningly, signaling midnight had occurred and the start of a new day had begun.
“Yeah, Buck,” Steve grinned, jokingly. “If I can withstand the entire room’s eyes on me while they’re bowing in my presence — because they’re scared I would cut off their heads if they didn’t — why can’t you grow some balls to at least ask out your wife before she has to do it for you?”
Bucky started to cackle but thankfully Rhodey forced him out of Steve’s office, finally bringing some peace into the room.
Tony spotted several copies of “Harry Potter” in some people’s hands, while others happily read “Percy Jackson,” and still others were clutching copies of “The Land of Stories” in their clasp. He smiled as he read the titles of each individual book, recalling the exact years he had first read each one, during his lonely childhood. Tony was pleased to recognize a lot of the different works of fiction that many of the people around him were holding, but none of them particularly captured his attention, seeing as he had all of his most beloved books’ storylines from his youth, memorized by heart.
The person that he had been madly in love with had been been by his side all along, happily talking the night away with him, unbeknownst to the world that they were right there next to each other, all this time. How long have they been just standing here, pouring out their emotions to each other without being aware of it and not acting upon them?
They played more games, — Tony absolutely destroying the physics-based ones, — and won even more prizes — all of which they had to deposit into the trunk of Tony’s Chevrolet Corvette before they headed off to the main attraction of the carnival.
Four brand-new ovens sat eagerly awaiting baked delicacies to be placed in them, white, simple cabinets were bolted to the walls, a dazzling chandelier made of star-shaped lightbulbs radiated overhead, and glossy, dark marble counters outlined the entire kitchen, polished and seemingly unused. Clean kitchen appliances such as knives, toasters, mixers, and a coffee machine - which sparkled like a diamond in comparison to Tony’s own overly-used and coffee-stained one - were scattered across the kitchen countertops, and just like the rest of Roger’s kitchen, appeared untouched by anyone in the past few weeks. An expensive-looking flat-screen TV was attached to an open spot in the right-side wall, right over a glass breakfast table paired with metal chairs which were settled into perfect positions as if they’ve never moved in the entire time that they’ve been in the kitchen. Even the wood floor looked pristine as new as it glistened and shone with the light’s reflections. Tony’s head spun in circles as his body moved, turning in every direction repeatedly as he took in the sight around him. Why would a person who’s too busy to ever cook need
The moment he had left the Starks’ property, his phone had buzzed with an apology text from his boyfriend. When he didn’t respond, it continued to buzz, his messages inbox rapidly piling up with Tony’s anguished apologies. By the 104th text from Tony pleading Steve to forgive him, he resolved to turning off his phone while he tried to pay attention to the movie that his friends were presently watching. Natasha had suggested that he could sleep over with the rest of the group, and he was quick accepted her invitation in order to avoid the possibility of seeing his boyfriend at his doorstep the next morning. He ignored the genius’ texts all the way until the next evening, and began to skim through all of them while his friends picked out another movie for the following night. When he reached the bottom of his text messages, Steve briefly caught onto the seven last words that hauntingly stared back up at him from his phone screen:
“My god, Tony!” Rhodey said, the annoyance he previously possessed slowly turning into frustration. “Steve is literally one of the nicest people I’ve ever known and if you work for him, I
He couldn’t possible fuck it up anymore than he already had if he went to go apologize to Tony tomorrow, right?
The prince glanced at the stranger again, paying closer attention to his elegant features and continued to let himself be guided through the horde of waltzers and intoxicated guests. Coffee-colored hair ruffled in the breeze that was created as they were swept across the room, and calloused but delicate hands gripped his shoulder and left palm. Everything about this person that he had just laid his eyes upon, was already robbing Steve of his breath and his consciousness to think properly.
As if by magic, everything had suddenly just clicked right into place, all within the span of a day, all within the words of a single message from a good friend.
Steve pulled apart for a second to look at his boyfriend’s face again, “I will, but just wait until Christmas Morning, sweetheart.
Another crash rang through the building and the remaining Avengers in the living room erupted into a heated argument hot enough to probably warm up all of Manhattan.
As Tony and Steve exited the stage after a final bow with the entire cast and crew, unknowingly hand in hand, their feet automatically led them to the door opening to the parking lot at the back of the auditorium. Sitting down on the steps and leaning against the railing as they did almost at the end of almost every rehearsal, Steve and Tony chose to just enjoy the quiet accomplishment of their success of the entire week within each other’s comforting company. And their well-deserved silence lasted pretty long until—
Steve’s eyes flitted across Tony’s face as if he was soaking in the appearance of his boyfriend for the very first time and whispered, “Look up, Tones.”
Steve sighed, quickly swallowing down the last bit of his meal before running after the brunet, occasionally stopping to greet some of the gardeners that had already started working in the castle gardens.
Either way, after having to restrain himself from pressing his tongue to the bottom of the glass container just to get another taste, Steve ultimately decided that
“But the fact, that he keeps disappearing without a moment’s notice; that he keeps leaving me without giving me a reason as to why; all of these things that he’s been recently doing and every single time that I catch him avoiding me — it just deteriorates my confidence and my chances with him, further.”
“WHAT THE HECK, CLINT?! HOW THE ABSOLUTE HELL DO YOU COMBINE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT TOGETHER? THAT MAKES NO GODDAMN SENSE!”
The blond immediately looked up and nodded affectionately, “Yeah, it does. All the clouds are the color of cotton candy, too.”
But as he waited outside of Steve’s Art, Culture, and Technology (ACT) classroom, Tony suddenly realized that he just couldn’t do this.
He definitely needed to capture this moment in his heart forever. Steve made a mental note to paint this entire scene on canvas, later. If his memory ever failed him, he’d be sure to have something to remind himself of this evening — something that Steve would make sure would last forever. Just like it his love for the certain brunet sitting next to him — as cheesy as it sounded.
“I’m winning this battle, Stark. Understand?” The blond persisted in tickling his partner, hoping the other would finally give in.
His classmates would chide him for not accepting to go on a date with some of these “gorgeous” girls, but he couldn’t care less. Steve only had eyes for one person and after years of painfully watching from the background of Tony’s romantic affairs, the brunet was finally available after just recently breaking up with Tiberius Stone.
Steve finally shut him up by smashing his lips onto the other prince’s, causing the two of them to stumble into the bridge’s railing.
“Hey, Tones!” A voice pierced through the thoughts running at a million miles an hour in Steve’s head.
This was everything that he had ever wanted in his life — and with everything that he currently possessed, he was more than just simply content.
Steve hastily nodded and waited patiently for Pepper to come back through the door, his hands still queasily gripping the drink she had gifted him.
“Has it come to your attention, Steve, that Prince Tony may have possibly developed a love interest for someone else?” His father randomly told him. “I spoke with King Howard the other day, and he described a ‘longing’ look in his son’s eyes as he stared out the window while at a dinner party.”
“Sorry, Rhodey, but I guess we’re going to have to tell the rest of the guys that Steve won’t be able to make it,” Bucky turned to Steve at the end of his sentence and glared at him. “
Steve couldn’t remember a time in his life that he had ever been happier than the moment that he had learned that he and Tony would be attending Columbia University together and he would get another four years with the irresistible brunet.
‘Of course.” She started walking towards the door before promptly halting to quickly address him something.
“Tony!” Rhodey exclaimed and gave him a light, but forceful shove. “Sorry, Steve. This one here can’t really control his mouth sometimes.”
Rolling his eyes with fondness, Tony took one last sip from his Captain America-themed mug of hot cocoa and set it down in order to turn towards Steve and press his head against his chest. Their legs and hands entangled within each other as warmth continued to spread into their bodies from the fire and their close contact. The couple peacefully snuggled until several faint crashes interrupted their tranquil moment.
Perhaps it was just Steve’s imagination, and because of his closed eyes he wasn’t able to see Tony’s face, but he swore he could feel Tony reciprocate the kiss as hard as Steve was initiating it. The genius’ lips pressed into his mouth with a vigor that Steve could only dream of and the sweet taste of sugary coffee infiltrated his mouth and his senses. The fake bouquet of flowers that he was holding for the song, dropped to the ground, unnoticed by the couple as Steve snaked his arms around Tony’s waist and the brunet retaliated by clasping onto the blond’s neck, pushing their bodies closer together than ever before.
“Chocolate-hazelnut frappe with chocolate chunks and caramel drizzle,” the genius whispered in disbelief. “You remember.”
“Yeah, that’s right! Tony got told last night but when the talent scout went to go tell you the good news, you had disappeared and no one knew where you had gone so I told the the talent guy that I would tell you about this opportunity first thing tomorrow morning.”
He was weak-at-the-knees at everything the other prince had to ever offer to the world because Steve knew that anything Tony ever presented to the universe had to be his very best — after all, Starks never settled for anything less than absolute perfection.
“I’m just so—wait, did you get cast as well? I don’t really want to be in it if you’re not in it—I mean of course you got casted, you’re literally one of the best performing and visual arts students Columbia’s had in like, a century.”
Four feet in front of Steve, the blond motioned for him to stop walking and Tony halted in his place. The genius tilted his head an inch to the left, puzzled, as Steve grinned and signaled for him to start reading.
good; Bucky’s undoubtedly done it a couple of times before, too - especially with Sam’s mom’s hot fudge lava cake, - but Steve couldn’t remember the last time he loved a dessert so much. It was definitely more than just a strange craving and he was certainly not starving for sweets, so it must’ve been the specific way that the recipe was followed that could flip his stomach like this. Was this how Rhodey felt whenever he ate one of these dishes? How could he have such self-control to not have eaten the entire thing?
“Oh, — I’m sorry — I was actually looking for someone that I was desperately hoping would come so I could dance with him. But I guess he never showed up,” Steve sorrowfully sighed.
“You better.” Pepper threatened him. “Because if you make things any worse between the two of you, I’ll personally make sure that you’ll never forget it.”
“This is so much more better than my daydreams,” Tony exhaled suddenly in faint, relieved puffs of air.
Tony’s friends’ rage echoed around the house as they continued to fiercely holler their opinions of Steve at his guilty face.
“We can practice together! Just so you know, I know this musical like the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,” Tony quipped and Steve could only smirk, fondly.
“I…” Steve’s gratitude was stolen right from out of his mouth as he gently accepted it. He then proceeded to stare at her in wonder. “I… Thank you. So much. You don’t know how much this means to me, Pepper.”
“I may or may not know the guy controlling the Ferris wheel, and may or may not have persuaded him to stop the ride right when we reached the top for about half-an-hour, — just so we can enjoy the view together.” Steve gave a sheepish but hypnotizing smile. “I thought it would be perfect for a date.”
Rhodey opened his mouth to answer Rogers’ question but quickly stopped himself and looked at Tony, “I don’t want to butcher the names and your language so I’ll just let you tell him.”
Pepper almost scoffed, “You’re exactly correct. It wasn’t okay to leave him in such a state of vulnerability and defenselessness, but you never tried to make any of it right. Not only did you leave him there for a few days, but you left him for an entire
A blanket was lain across the ground at the very center of the hill, constructing the most perfect spot to spend the rest of the night watching the sun finally lose its last traces of light as it crossed lower and lower into the sky, eventually dipping under the horizon. Oddly, there was a vase in the middle of the cloth, but several sticks of cotton candy were arranged neatly inside the glass container, along with a few different shades of pink roses.
well-made food could have such a dramatic effect on him? Or maybe this feeling was all caused by the fact that he hadn’t had an actually delectable dish in a very long time and because of how he’s mostly skipped dinner for the past month or so.
Tony raised his head to peek over the top of the book and his mouth hung wide open, gaping at the blond behind the hardcover’s covers.
“Hey! Those scraps of paper are actually recipes that I’m working on! Don’t you dare criticize them!”
“You know what, why don’t we just let Bruce hold onto the bowl?” Tony suggested as he shoved the popcorn into the scientist’s hands to keep it away from Clint. “After all, he is the one who made it for us.”
Pepper delicately scowled but cleared her face of any emotions in order to talk to a cashier of the coffee shop.
He lazily sucked a careful hickey into Tony’s skin, savoring each quiet moan that escaped the brunet’s parted lips and kissed his jaw and chin, not-stopping until he felt completely satisfied. Desire took control of his actions and Steve couldn’t resist his cravings anymore, caving in to his own hopeless thirst, as he grazed the nape of Tony’s neck with his fingers and pushed their faces together, once more. Concupiscence and passion erupted between the couple once again, resulting in Steve nibbling and chewing at the genius’ golden-basked lips that had transformed into an enchanting, carnation-pink color as they flushed with blood, — and time seemed to fly by as he desperately tried to take in as much of his lover as he can within the passing seconds of each moment, and Tony, unconditionally, — let him have it all. After yet another round of ceaseless, love-consumed kisses with bare skin pressing against bare skin, and the taste of cotton candy flooding his senses and mind, Steve reluctantly pulled back but continued to cradle the brunet, cuddling into the other’s body as if he might suddenly disappear from his grasp.
! Also, I brought him some of your other foods but I don’t think Steve’s tried them yet. And I’ve known him ever since he was still in NYU getting his art degree.”
Around a fanatical, 14 seconds later, which Steve had counted in his head, he pulled back and cradled Tony’s head in his hands, forcing the genius to pay attention to him.
One last kiss sealed the end of the musical, the end of the entire week of routinely performances, exhausting dress rehearsals, and one of the longest and most memorable, compelling, and electrifying adventures of Steve’s lifetime.
Ignoring Tony’s pleas to come back, Steve jammed his key into the ignition and sped away into the haunting silence of the night.
“I know that we’ve been complete fucking idiots for practically all of our lives, but let’s skip the apologies for now and just get to the good part.” Steve remarked. “So? We’ve been unintentionally shunning each other out but that doesn’t change how much you mean to me, and hopefully, how much I mean to you, as well. It’s alright now, and it’s all fair. We hurt each other, we avoid each other — well now it’s up to the both of us to fix and heal each other. And what better way to do it, than this?”
His friends could be real assholes sometimes but he wouldn’t trade them for all the gold and riches in the world.
This man was gorgeous - but that didn’t mean that Tony should immediately start trusting him and acting as his personal slave just because he was a pretty blond. His face instantly twisted in a scowl at the thought but he held it back as Steve Rogers finally reached him and stopped in front of Tony, politely holding out his right hand.
One day after his frantic worrying; once Natasha finished telling him to stop panicking, Tony made sure to check that Steve had received a notecard from Bruce, during the blond’s biochemical engineering class, telling him to go to the library and find the book with the class number: PS3602.O255, from the MIT library catalog.
“Of course, Steve. But unfortunately, some representatives of your company’s business partners are visiting today and I’m afraid of them thinking that we have more than just a professional relationship.”
The brunet sighed happily, “This is so fucking perfect, Steve. I mean — just how? How did you manage to do all of this — for me?”
“I’m begging you, Pepper. I know I should have done this sooner, I know I should have tried to apologize right after I had left; but I’m doing this now and I’m willing to put everything I have on the line here, I’m honestly willing to. For him.”
“Oh, okay,” Steve reached for a handful of popcorn, wrapped his arm around Tony’s hips, once the brunet had calmed down, and pulled him closer so they could cuddle. “Hey, do you think we could watch something else after this movie?”
Steve sighed in exasperation, “I say it once in fourth-grade and now you’ll never let me live it down, won’t you?”
The sheepish and guilty-faced children nodded their heads before hurrying — more like scrambling — back to the nearest side of the lake as they chased each other in a mad dash for their parents.
There was no doubt that Steve had poured every last bit of his effort and love into this one simple, but extraordinarily detailed, sketch. Had he done this just for Tony?
“I’ll see you tomorrow at the gala, right?” Steve asked Tony, innerly-wishing that he didn’t have to leave so soon.
Steve gave Tony a sympathetic pout and the brunet immediately felt bad for ranting about his life’s problems to this random college student in the library, out of all the places. He didn’t want to scare away this insanely-gorgeous guy right after he had just met him.
Stopping their journey on the bridge above the relaxed and shallow river, the couple leaned next to each other against the railing, resting their bodies after a long night of commotion.
as this guy’s introductory dish to Italian culture and cuisine - it had never been the most favorited among his wide-selection of recipes by those who have tried it before because of the raw meat in the dish, but Tony knew that it was still a fairly well-crafted recipe and he could only hope that he hadn’t accidentally screwed up something while in the process of making it. He hadn’t tasted the dish beforehand because he wanted to preserve it in the freshest possible condition for Rogers but he desperately did not want a repeat of the day that he had accidentally mistaken a glass bottle of salt for sugar in one of his dad’s restaurant. The result ended up in one of the customer’s
“Well, Steve Rogers might or might not be looking for a personal chef right about now,” Rhodey informed him. “He’s a busy guy and honestly, me and the others are worried about his health with him skipping meals more and more frequently now. And I may have recommended you to him and told him that you’d be his personal chef.”
Steve frowned, “Why don’t we both get our minds off of these… situations, that we’re, admittedly and awkwardly in? Do you want to go somewhere that we can — I don’t know — talk in peace? If you would like to, that is.”
There were about three thousand things that could go wrong during the actual performances and was there even a possibility that Tony actually liked him back?
Tony stared unfazed, in the direction of the door that led to the Avengers’ common room. “See? Nat’s got it all under control. We don’t have a thing to worry about, Stevie.”
that Steve had stashed away in his fridge back home. However, throwing out the leftovers and ordering something new was not an option; Steve absolutely hated to waste food and letting it rot away in his fridge definitely did not sound sanitary.
“Sounds delicious although I have no idea what you just said,” Rogers said innocently. “Also, I’m just too busy to go out and buy proper food so…”
A couple of minutes later, Tony was bursting through the main auditorium doors as he despairingly scanned the view for Steve and his face instantly flushed with relief when he spotted the blond sitting alone by himself. Steve contemplated moving away and running off before Tony could approach him but eventually decided against it and shifted over a few inches to let the genius sit down next to him.
Tony. He won’t confess to you any of this, but he really does want you back, despite the trouble that you had left him in.”
Tony had barged into Steve’s room in the Americandian castle, at 7 AM in the morning, and practically dragged the blond down through his own castle’s garden, to show him something that he had apparently “just discovered the other day.” Normally, Steve would refuse to leave the comfort of the castle grounds without eating a whole meal first, but this was Tony who he was following, and Steve would honestly follow him to the ends of the Earth.
Steve went back to pecking his lips across Tony’s ethereal face and when he felt the brunet tense up under him, he planted his mouth firmly against the genius’ temple and softly dragged it down to his jawline without lifting it off his skin. Immediately, Tony shuddered, biting back a moan, and began to fall limp in Steve’s arms and the blond cradled his loosened form against his own body. He took this as an opportunity to run his hands through Tony’s feathery and silky chocolate hair, rubbing his hands in certain spots along the brunet’s scalp that helped relax him even more. When Steve pulled back, the other prince in his arms whined weakly and clung onto his torso, refusing to let go.
“Sounds perfect.” Steve turned around and started walking away when he abruptly spun back around and ran back to the spot where he previously stood. “Except for one thing: Can I ask what your classes are?”
“That’s a surprisingly really good answer, Steve.” Her eyes brightened up a lot more and she focused on him.
The butterflies that had been previously caged in his stomach, suddenly escaped from their captivity, exploded outwards with a tide of newfound emotion, and surged outwards in one massive wave; the flutter of their wings tickling his stomach and lungs.
“You’re right,” Bucky agreed. “I changed my mind. I bet it’s actually going to explode in your face and give you explosive diarrhea. Hey, Rhodes, how much you wanna bet?”
In-between the creases of Page 272 and Page 273, was a plain, white slip of paper and a pink Post-It note stuck to the right side. As he took out the first piece of paper and held it gingerly, Tony realized that there was a singular Oreo drawn expertly onto the bookmark. The brunet automatically smiled as he continued to hold up the thin sheet and examined it more thoroughly.
As if anything could possibly get better in the moment, intoxicated bliss combined with the sweet taste of Steve’s lips filled his head and made the brunet felt immortal to all the dangers in the world. Nothing could knock the two of them off of their victory pillar — and the brunet believed that they undoubtedly deserved this. Tony could loiter here, with Steve latched hungrily onto his lips, for hours on end — and he wouldn’t mind at all. If he had his way, both of them would be lingering here trapped within each other’s mouths until the end of the day — and the librarians would be ushering them to go back to their dorms as they closed down the library for the night.
Steve’s stomach lightly growled at the thought but he pushed his mind to concentrate on finishing those letters that he was supposed to have done half-an-hour ago. He could think about food later after he’d completed the rest of his ever-growing mountain of paperwork.
As the brunet discovered that he had wandered aimlessly throughout the fiction section for the past five minutes, he suddenly remembered the name of one of his all-time favorite books that he had read a couple of years ago before he had started university.
. Rhodey thought that I should make some fresh food just in case; apparently, you’re often stuck at home with leftovers and takeout for food - not the fabulous meals that I’ve always envisioned millionaires eating.”
Their silence pursued deeper into time until the still-masked-brunet beside the blond abruptly punctured it.
Bruce was the first one to openly agree, “Can we watch ‘The Princess Switch’ or ‘The Holiday’? We haven’t watched any romance movies during our previous Christmases together as a team.”
He loved him back. Or at least, he returned some amount of Tony’s emotionally-painful feelings. It didn’t matter; at least he actually had some form of a chan—
“You’ve been so out of it lately, I never know if you’re actually being honest or if you’re lying straight to my face when you say that you’re okay.”
There was no way to turn back time. Steve of all people knew this cold, hard truth.  Yet it had always been  human nature  to constantly muse over all the "could haves" and lament the ways in which things should have been done.
So despite some initial doubts and the questionable legality of the business, it was safe to say that Rent-tacle  had ended up being  an upstanding success. And maybe next time, he'd throw in jug of sex pollen as well.
Later on  Steve would leave the company a  glowing five star review, and Tony would deny enjoying the whole thing.
"He came seemingly out of nowhere.  Offered me a partnership of sorts. Showed me what he was capable of doing. And though I hate to admit I was impressed.", Tony paused for a bit, reliving some distant memory ," But it didn't take a genius to figure out it was all wrong...So I rejected his offer and took off-
Clint, Natasha, and Scott were great, but he couldn't help wishing  it was Tony here instead. Not only because Tony would know exactly what to do, but that..He. Missed. Tony.  Simple as that.
Putting the photo back, Steve went and sat down on the edge of the bed once more as he waited. And waited. Time dragged on slowly..forty-five minutes, an hour..hour and half. And though the rational part of his mind was telling him not to overreact, Steve started to grow worried. After another fifteen minutes passed, before he  decided to check on Tony.  Just in case.
IHis first impression was that it looked..shockingly ordinary. Like a factory more then anything else. Typical long rectangle brick building. Tiny windows placed at coordinated intervals, all connected to a square building with welcoming set of double doors. A white van was parked in the otherwise deserted lot.
Looking a bit  desperate, Tony tried once more to glare down at him, "Steve Rogers. I swear If you don't get me down right this instant I wil-"
Steve had probably never felt so hopeless, so straight up useless, as he did now, stuck on a twisted dimension without a plan or clue.  The lack of activity(shouldn't they be trying to find a way back? To rescue Tony?) combined with overlayering feelings of hopelessness, had in turn morphed into frustration and a seething deep rooted anger.
That moment, when Ultron had taken over Tony's body, had rendered  Steve frozen with shock and horror.  He could only watch helplessly as the humanity die out from those familiar soft brown eyes.  It had been one of the worst moments of his life and one  which he continued to relive in his dreams for weeks after. He had thought his resolve unshakeable, but now.. There had been no plan for what to do when the one you loved been turned into a monster.  No solution which he deemed acceptable.
It was only  Dr.Strange's last minute  arrival which had possibly prevented the unthinkable from being a reality. And of the two evils it had seemed like the obvious choice at the time,  a sacrifice which Tony himself had been willing to make.
Steve jerked into wakefulness with a start, heart pounding his ribcage with a force that was almost painful. Springing to his feet , he braced himself for the incoming attack..
"Soon after we lost contact with you, The Leader scattered us across different dimensions. Me,  Clint, Natasha, and Scott were trapped in a place called Dimension Z. A realm controlled by Armin Zola, which we eventually fought our way out. Hulk was trapped in another dimension with Kraven.  And Sam was trapped under Kang's rule " Steve hesitated,  before adding " time apparently worked differently there. What had been several  months for the rest of us, had apparently been years in that dimension. "
His pants were first soon to go after, whether through intent or accident, and the fabric of his shirt was only held together by a few treads. A couple minutes later his shirt joined his pants on the floor, in a shredded pile on the floor.
When Tony had first stepped out of the shadows, an almost literal  ray of light among those dark and musty catacombs, his heart had nearly stopped. Tony.  Tony whom he had lost for months and nearly given up dead.  Tony, who was sporting worn clothes and an unkempt scraggly beard. Looking a little rough for wear, but with the much loved familiar gleam in his eye.  The same aura of nonchalance, exasperating, endearing,  and wholly unfitting for one  had just blasted a hoard of mummies into dust.  Tony whom he had lost and mourned, and at times half wondered if he'd ever see again in this life.
He had become reckless and impulsive, in combat. Other times he would purposely isolate  himself from the rest of the team for hours on an end. And to his relief? (Was it relief?)  They had given him space. There were times, when  he felt like he was going to explode from all this pent up frustration. Fighting against Kang's robots gave him some outlet for his anger,  alotting a temporary means to release all the tension building up. But it was never enough. The anger was always there
"Does it look like I'm having fun to you?!" Tony retorted,  face already slightly flushed.  Steve wanted to say ,"yes, yes he did", at least  if the erection pushing at the front if his pants was any indication.Tony was locked in a losing battle, and the tentacles seemed to be growing restless. One had slithered its way up till it found an entrance at the hem of his pant leg, while two more were engaged in crawling  up his shirt, causing the fabric to strain and tear slightly against their combined girth (about the size of a man's forearm at their thickest point ). Tony couldn't quite suppress a gasp as one the tentacles had hit a sweet spot.
Having cleaned up once more, both men  sprawled lazily on their side,  turned so that  they could look into each other's eyes. Steve's hands threaded lightly through Tony's hair, a simple pleasure he almost thought he'd never experience again.
The following day the crate arrived bright and early just as promised. It was, Steve thought, significantly smaller than the one he had seen the other day, and surprisingly light for its size. From the inside an almost inaudible growling could be heard. Almost immediately he was presented with the first challenge, namely, getting it through the tower and into Tony's workshop unnoticed. The last thing Steve  wanted to do was explain to a nosy Clint,  or suffer Nat's judgemental stare.
Then the Leader had come calling. If the first time he had heard  Tony's voice come through the transponder had been one of the most beautiful sounds Steve had heard, then the brief note  of confusion before he was harshly cut off had been one of the worst.
"Good. Now there is one last thing for you to sign here."  The woman pulled yet another sheet of paper, one with less text but requiring his full signature. Never a good sign.  "This is a waiver of consent stating that Rent-tacle is not responsible for any injuries or death that could result from using our product."
Steve himself tried to bargain for  many days after the fateful day that had twisted them apart. He would have given almost anything for a better, happier, outcome, regardless of consequences to himself.
Early on Steve had been so hopeful,  perhaps naively so in retrospect, when he had first heard Tony's voice through the Inter dimensional transponder. Even if  the situation had been far  from ideal, hearing one another's voice had been a lifeline of sorts for both of them. They had kept one another company through the long and  lonely nights, working through this together while  talking optimistically about the future they were going to have.
“I like you.” Natasha, terrifying russian spy, said with a small smile, immediately causing the table to faceplant in shock.
Thor let a small smile grace his features as he took the offered cup from Tony. Tony went forward to grab a blanket and some pillows before he came back and laid down in Thor’s lap and covered the both of them with blankets.
“In fact you know them very well, they’re really close to you.” Cedric says, blush still evident, but gaining more confidence.
“We have.” Elena’s soft voice washed over Robin, immediately relaxing him, “I’ve especially missed you my dear star.”
“I’ll give you my number and we can talk later, kay darling?” Steve whispered in Tony’s ear, after he maneuvered him onto his lap.
“Jesus Christ that’s a big house.” Yamato says, actually shocked at seeing the house and the entourage of butler’s and maid’s.
Last is Tsuki Motomiya, who is more shy than Alexander and prefers to hide behind her brother or dad. She had long black hair, reaching all the way down to her mid back, and crystal blue eyes, showing intelligence far beyond a 10 year old. Her partner was Sunmon whose final digivolution was Apollomon, Dianamon’s counterpart in the Olympian’s.
“We accept as well.” Steve finally spoke up, causing Tony’s head to shoot up and stares at the others who all look as determined. Thor and Bruce shooting each other amused glances.
After a few minutes, Katheryne walked in and started to hand out the daily commissions to the Monstandt knights/adventurers and the Liyue group, since they could easily use the waypoint to get back easily.
“Dobby.” Harry called out, as the excitable elf popped in with various foods and drinks, leaving right after.
Robin slams his palm into his other hand with a soft ‘Oh’, “Also time works differently, one day here is around 3 months there. While one day there is around a few minutes here.”
“Kids time to wake up, we have to leave soon.” Daisuke slowly shook his kids awake, amusingly watching them blink their eyes.
“Always.” Cedric grabbed Harry and pulled him into his chest, both of them cuddling each other in the barren hall.
The others nod quickly in acceptance, packing everything up in record time, and following Daisuke back to his car.
“I divide my friends into levels based on what they do. Actions, speaking, mannerisms, lies, I analyze everything and place them in categories.”
Carol, Clint, and Natasha were laughing and shoving each other into the snow, making snow angels in the snow. Sam and Scott made snowballs and, while snickering, were sneakily throwing them at the others, hoping they won’t come and attack them. Tony was leaning against the door, arms crossed over his chest, covering his arc reactor over the fuzzy hot rod red bath robe he has on. Fuzzy slippers were pressed lightly into the snow, covering his feet from the cold snow.
“Coddle, Barmbrack, Irish Stew, Shepherd’s Pie, and Boxty, for Steve.” The hot blonde guy, Steve, grinned and winked at Tony.
Tony shuffled nervously in his seat, hand coming up to rub at the back of his neck, “Pepper, light of my life, what would that be?”
“Y'all finally figure it out?” Daisuke offered a wolfish grin, watching in amazement as the knowledge spread.
Tony smacked a palm as he just remembered that this was their first time here, “Shit forgot it’s your first time here. Well here we don’t have a menu. You order any type of food that you want, from any culture or part of the world and we cook it for you.”
Tony glanced and saw everyone’s attention on him, blushing quietly before speaking, “I have 4. Lady Aphrodite is the level for close friends who I sometimes initiate contact with. Lady Hestia is for friends who are almost family and who I will freely touch. Lady Artemis is for friends who I will offer a greeting too, but not close enough to touch or tell secrets. And finally is Lady Hera for enemies or others.”
Laid out across the whole couch, right next to Steve and Bucky, was Tony stark calmly tapping away at various emails and texts, his Beautifly perched on his head with her straw like mouth sucking nectar from a glass that Tony was holding between his legs.
Takeru walked into the bathroom, still robotically, and quickly got dressed before walking out to see Daisuke sitting on the bed.
Judith saw the exchange and decided that they actually needed to talk, so she bustled Estelle and Sodia out with the excuse of girl shopping, completely ignoring Sodia’s harsh comments, leaving Flynn and Yuri alone in awkward silence.
He turned the corner on the third floor as he walked up the staircase going to the 5th floor. He walked a little more before he came upon a strange group, the three Triwizard champions and a lone Slytherin, Theodore Nott. They seemed to be talking about classes, but Harry paid them no mind as he walked right closer to them, and he resumed his grumbling.
Tony moved his arms, revealing the sparsely covered chest which contained the arc reactor. Tony suddenly gasped, falling down with a quick “Fuck.”
Sully offered Robin a tense nod of gratitude, turning around and spurring her horse forward. Robin tiredly sighed as he went back into the fight, alone, always alone, after what the Shepherds found out. During a routine fight against Validar the truth of Robin’s existence came out, that he was actually a vessel of the Fell Dragon. After that everyone treated Robin with caution and a wariness that hurt, even if he expected this it still hurt all the same.
“I said that I wouldn’t mind being yours.” Regas shouted out, before quickly turning his head away as steam came out of his ears.
“We?” Taichi questioned, dragging Daisuke over to a chair with everyone sitting next to him, Takeru sitting as closely as humanly possible without seeming weird, ignoring the amused glances.
Aether nods gratefully, “Thank you,” Glancing at everyone he responds, “If you all want to know why I’m busy but we can meet at Starsnatch Cliff, at the highest point at around 8 PM, sound good?”
The next 5 minutes passed quickly as Hiakri and Mimi got drinks and snacks for everyone to eat while they waited, and eventually Veemon walked into the clearing followed by two kids.
Before Yuri could continue he was interrupted by a small crashing into him, letting out a large oomph as he fell to the ground, the group stopping to stare at him.
A quick “What?” came from behind them as they turned around and met the alarmed faces of the Shepherds.
“Don’t worry darling, I’ll make sure nothing happens to them.” Olivia says, her face taking a more serious look.
Yuri stares in surprise, as he didn’t think that Flynn would want to try again, before melting into a grin, “I would like nothing more.”
“Oh my god.” The dirty blonde guy, who could totally be a spy, said, horror etched in his face at the thought of so many classes.
Taichi grins as he brushes away his tears, leaning up to throw an arm around Daisuke's shoulders, “Look at that you ass, you’re taller than me. What are you a giant?”
“Hmmm.” Tony hummed as he measured and cut the ingredients with lightning fast movements, “I’m making Pastina and Chicken Gnocchi soup, Ciambotta, Spaghetti alla Carbonara, Frittata, and Tiramisu.”
“How are you alive?” Steve questioned, correctly thinking on knowing that this kid didn’t sleep much.
Tony resisted the urge to coo as he answered the man, “Well this place works somewhere in between a restaurant and a cafe. You can sit at the tables and order coffee and food or you can take it to go.”
The others all offered the same excuses as they left in a whirlwind, leaving Steve and Tony to blink stupidly after them.
“I-I thought you wouldn’t like me, since you spent so long liking Hikari. I didn’t want to get my hopes up, especially since you disappeared for 3 years, but this is like a dream come true.” Takeru whispered, drunk on happiness.
“Yea sure.” Tony mumbles as he hides his blushing face looking at Steve out of the corner of his eye.
“Finally a nice bed.” Wanda sighed as she snuggled into Tony’s side, Natasha laid out on Tony’s other side.
“Ah sorry about that.” Tony coughed, chugging his first cup of coffee, “I just don’t know how to respond. I only had 3 friends, now 5 just upgraded 2 people, and that's it.”
The Avengers were the same way, they just stared at him uncomprehendingly, until Tony got fed up and walked away. Nobody ever apologized for the shocked stares since no one knew it hurt him.
After that Daisuke spent his time working at the company, learning the ropes of how to be a good CEO and how to run a company. Thankfully the workers were very understanding of his circumstances and always helped Daisuke whenever he needed anything, in return Daisuke paid them back with noodles made at his ramen cart, which pretty soon everyone that worked them started to worship them as
“Oh you will don’t worry.” Daisuke grins at her, not noticing the tense Takeru and everyone watching amusedly.
“Yes,” Scott steps up, feeling a little more confident as Tony didn’t give a blatant rejection yet, “We all want to date you. We’ll wait until you decide who you want to date.”
It was a semi large room shaped in a half circle. Straight ahead of them was a large brick fireplace, already lit and roaring hot. Wall to wall, right next to the fireplace on both sides, was large bookcases of any book you could imagine. A large wooden table, intricately designed with mythical creatures, was surrounded with two single couches and a large three person couch.
“Yep so now that the nanobots are reprogrammed they basically act as everything for me. This is my favorite one.” Tony grins as he holds his hand out where the nanobots crawl out of his hand and form a usb stick on his finger, with other such cords forming on his other fingers.
Steve broke off in a large smile as he stared at Tony, grabbing the paper and holding it against his chest tightly, “Sure.”
Steve looks up, guilt and shame running rampant, “Damnit Tony, you could have died and we would’ve had no way of knowing until we saw your body.”
“Tony, what’s happening?” Bruce’s voice filled with concern brought Tony’s attention to him, looking up and seeing his family.
“Is that what you are Friend Anthony?” Thor said as he came in, dressed in a simple large t-shirt and sweats.
Tony just stares at Steve, “I’ve been experimenting with nanobots for around 5 years, I started it because without the Iron Man armor I’m not able to defend or protect, it made me feel exposed, weak. These nanobots help me call the Iron Man armor from inside me, instead of an outside force.”
Robin has a secret, besides the whole Grima secret identity, he fought in another war in another world against a whole country. When Elena and Yufine show up in the middle of a fight against Risen, everyone is understandably shocked as they’ve all been wary of Robin since his secret came out. They’re shocked that two strangers, to them, fight so perfectly with Robin despite knowing that he’s the fell dragon.
“Now my dear star, show us your lightning.” Elena calls out, coming to a stop next to the puzzled Shepherds.
“To me too, don’t worry.” Daisuke said, shifting him and Takeru higher and under the blankets, “But for now sleep.”
Tony walks into the living room, pulling a rather large blanket and settling it on the ground in the middle. Tony sits in the exact middle and waits for the rest of his lovers to join him. Steve and Bucky take up spots right behind Tony, letting him lean onto them. Natasha and Clint go onto his left side, cuddling together and leaning onto Tony. Wanda and Pietro take up the other side, taking the same position as Natasha and Clint. Sam and Scott lay across his thighs while Bruce and Thor lay stomach first next to his feet.
“What? But you’ve never liked anyone that fast.” Clint whined, still in shock that his best friend warmed up to someone that fast. It took them 2 years to be best friends, which included a lot of knife stabbing, and it took 1 day for Natasha to like the new guy.
“Bruce almost done?” Clint calls out, tucking himself in between Tony’s left leg and Natasha and Carol. Wanda, Pietro, Sam, and Scott were on the other side by Tony’s right leg.
Tony smiles and starts to work on Steve’s feet. He works down the thigh and down to the calves over to the soles of the feet, working out the tension and soothing the muscles. Tony finishes up and places the lotion away, then tucks Steve into bed.
Aether hummed as he set up the flowers in the lantern, which he was assured would be able to hold the weight of each flower, “My parents.”
So here's a Tony owns a cafe AU, I thought it was pretty cute. Any mistakes let me know and I can fix it. Also sorry if my writing is messy and all that but I don't really have a way with words even if I try.
“What?” Tony tilted his head, trying to think of what could cause the Avengers to look that horrified.
Chrome winces at the look, knowing that he has to do it now or he’ll never get the nerve to do it again. Chrom and Robin sit in silence a bit, Robin fiddling with the sleeves and Chrom staring at Robin.
“Yes yes but come now children we should leave them alone for now.” Natasha gestured to the others as they all quietly left Tony and Thor to their devices.
Tony usually just scoffed at most apologizes, never showing that he was grateful. The only way would be by knowing his ticks and in this particular case, getting armor upgrades and weapons is how Tony shows that he’s grateful.
As soon as Tony got out of his armor after the debrief, he came straight up to his bed, not even taking a shower yet.
Flynn just glances shyly at him before nodding, he gathers his legs beneath him as he holds his arms around himself in a pseudo hug, “It was because Sodia kissed me, I didn’t want it but she still did it, and right after that I decided to break up with you to, to…. I don’t know why.” Flynn whispers brokenly as he stares forlornly between his fingers, which causes Yuri to see how broken Flynn has been after they broke up.
Tony shifts his attention to the legs and discards the scrubber, rubbing with his hands and releasing the knots in the calves and bottom of the feet. Steve hums in appreciation when Tony soothes the soles of his feet, since they've been hurting from the end of the mission.
“Uhhh, Christmas is coming up and I still need to find gifts for Hermione and Ron, why are they so hard to shop for.” Harry quietly whined to himself as he piled food onto his plate.
Under the TV were 12 stockings with the initials NR, SR, JBB, TO, WA, PA, BB, CB, CD, SL, SW, TS. They were all filled to the brim with tiny toy’s and packs of cookies.
Harry turned back to see who was coming up and was surprised to see Cedric walking up to him, pinking tinting his cheeks.
“Well alright.” Flynn uncertainly says, staring at Yuri holding her with longing conflicted feelings rising in him.
“We’re going to leave also, the captain can barely contain herself as is.” Laella said with a gentle smile, glancing back at a stiff Jishuka who was trying to contain her excitement.
After the team raid against the 6th mage of the Vatan church, Grid decides to do something that shocks him and his teammates.
“Well you’re all acting like them.” Tony smiled  as he put the pastina, Spaghetti alla Carbonara, Ciambotta, Chicken Gnocchi soup, and Tiramisu on the table.
Tony smiled, immediately making a note, “Correction, move Meg and her girlfriend up to Lady Aphrodite friends, hovering on Lady Hestia friends.”
Grid blushed at the unexpected words, unsure on how to feel. He definitely knew he was attracted to the hulking mass of muscles, so he decided to be honest with his feelings for once.
While he was analyzing his best response, Pepper was quietly glancing over him with a critical eye, the others shuffling nervously beside her. She noted his dark bags, grease stained hair, rumpled clothes and immediately came to a conclusion.
Yuri stared at her impassively, “Stop confusing everyone and just say you’re like my sister, I don’t understand why you think kissing me is the way.”
Daisuke’s voice broke Takeru out of his wonder, and he looked at Daisuke with an indecipherable glance.
“That’s the third bet in a row that she won, what the hell? Goddamn lucky ass.” Harry grumbled as he walked through the hall, aimlessly walking around.
“How the fuck did you do that?” Clint asked, staring at everyone’s shocked faces and Tony’s smug face.
Steve just nods his head to the question and lets out a small moan of appreciation as Tony starts rubbing soothing circles over his chest. Tony moves lower onto the abs where he continues the small circles with the scrubber. He moves onto the arms, paying special attention to his wrist and fingers along with his deltoid muscle and biceps. He uses his fingers and soothes the tension in the arms that Steve uses to swing the shield all day. He moves onto Steve’s privates and keeps it soft and simple, since today was about comfort and not about arousal.
“Trust me, I’m not lying Takeru.” Daisuke’s voice seemed to make Takeru come alive since he threw himself at Daisuke, sending them tumbling on the bed, as Takeur nuzzled Daisuke’s chest.
“I will honey let me get undressed.” Tony smiled, a smile full of love and adoration at his boyfriend. Tony takes off his shirt and pants, changing his boxers and crawls into bed, right next to Steve. He pulls Steve against him, tucking his head under his chin, Steve’s mouth breathing hot breaths of hair on his skin. Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist and intertwines their legs as Tony puts his arms around Steve’s shoulders.
“Finally this is Steve Rogers.” Muscle hunk gave a small sweet smile, immediately giving Tony butterflies in his stomach that had nothing to do with what he’d eaten, or lack thereof, earlier this morning.
Tony stared at Steve for several moments, Steve’s heart frantically beating in his chest, before answering.
“Wait.” Pepper held up a hand, stopping Tony in his tracks as he glanced at Pepper confusingly, “Let me introduce you all to each other before you tell us your horrible schedule.”
Aether joyfully laughs as he processes the statement before shaking his head, “No, no. In fact I’m older than all of you combined.”
“Does that feel better love?” Natasha asked with a soft smile as Tony cleaned off the soap from the massage.
Pepper looked over at Tony, humming in quiet thought, “I didn’t know you were taking Biology this semester.”
“Finished before I went to bed last night.” Daisuke called back, heading to the bathroom to freshen up and get dressed.
Steve leaned over to put his face next to Tony’s, both sporting a brilliant blush once they realized, “Can I talk to you after the movie? Alone?”
“Fry put ‘The Knight before Christmas’ please.” Tony said, voice wavering only slightly from the clacking of his teeth.
“No, no we didn’t.” Lissa says, staring in excitement at the tail, frowning as Chrom pulls her back.
Tony waved off Steve, feeling oddly giddy and happy, getting ready to tell Pepper, Rhodey, and Bruce all about his new date.
Pepper slammed her hands on the table, which would’ve spilled Tony’s coffee if he hadn’t already finished them.
“Ooo I wanna watch, I wanna watch.” Yufine grins, hopping up and down and raising her arm like a little kid.
They still have plenty to talk about, and plenty to say, but this new thing between them looks like it’ll last an eternity.
“Sounds intense.” Theo said, glancing at Cedric as they both blushed at the fact that Harry was wearing female garments.
This usually shocked many people since they always believed that Tony’s pokemon soul would manifest in something that would evolve into a pokemon with a massive ego or a massive temper. But when Tony introduced his pokemon as Beautifly, Bellissima, everyone stared at him in shock.
“Can I help you?” Harry bounty asked, wanting to get to the Room of Requirements and relax with a bottle of butterbeer and treacle tart by the fireplace.
“Y-you love me?” Robin whispers again, staring at Chrom through his lashes, before straightening out and demands, “Kiss me.”
“Is there anything else you’re seemingly hiding, Daisuke?” Koushiro says, a glimmer of interest in his eyes.
Tony sighed, “I never told anyone?” He looks around and gets nods, “I have a condition called Congenital Analgesia, which means I don’t feel any pain. For example I could be having a heart attack and I’ll never know, or I could be dying and I’ll never know.”
“Hey J, how’s everything looking?” Tony called out as he got up to put the glasses back by the coffee machines.
“Man you really are living the life Dai.” Jou says, glancing around at the wine rack, the snack rack, and all other things strewn around.
“That’s pretty insane, not gonna lie.” Sora said faintly, trying to recover from the massive influx of information.
Now here's the prompt Teresa asked me for. Again maybe rather short but there's not much talking for them to do so mainly fluff and jealousy.
“What was what? I really have no idea what you guys are talking about.” Tony just stares at the team, thinking of what he had done to horrify them.
“He didn’t because he’s afraid of what other people would think,” Yufine answered before anyone else, surprising people with her mature answer and voice, “So he always hides them, but after we found out he sleeps better with others everyone always pulled Robin into their bed so he could actually sleep.”
Tony gaped at Bucky as the statement settled in his mind, he glanced at the other Avengers and saw all of them looking self conscious and shuffling around waiting for Tony’s response.
“Yea but I got Friday monitoring me 24/7 for any presences outside of mine and the bots and Friday.”
14 hours later the plane touched down in the airport right next to Odaiba, where Veemon promptly woke up Daisuke and the kids. They took out their baggage and walked over to the black limo that waited for them, popping in their luggage and getting seated.
Daisuke grins at the friendly banter as they slowly walk toward the confused group, whoo all banded together after watching a crying Taichi hug a total stranger, “No I’m just a giant at 6’4” no biggie.”
“Let’s go to sleep.” Tony beckoned the other two and without delay they all went over to the closet, getting dressed into loose fitting clothes ready to sleep.
“Just relax, I’m going to take care of you baby, you don’t have to do anything.” Tony coos as he places some vanilla massage lotion onto his hand starts to massage his shoulders. Tony rubs his hands up and down Steve’s arm, pushing at the knots and easing the tension out of them.
“You can take all these and put them away from me.” Hermione demanded, “I swear everytime I wake up, I’m surrounded by your damn weapons. You are insane with all of these.”
Yuri grinned as he pulled out his ID from his wallet passing it forward, “I know they scouted me out when I was job hunting and said they wanted to hire me, and after explaining my circumstances to Don he tested me and immediately promoted me to his personal assistant.”
“And what’s so unrealistic about this standard?” Clint raised an eyebrow, raising himself slightly to stare at Tony.
Before Daisuke could react he found himself at the bottom of a pile of Digidestined, all of them crying and shouting, besides Taichi who sidestepped with a wry grin.
“What’s the pile of scrap metal for?” Steve asks, tilting his head in confusion as he tries to think of possibilities.
“Yep my darling Bellissima helped me a lot with finding some good Pokemon.” Tony’s smile made Steve melt right by him, the others sniggered while Tony looked in confusion.
“Y-you actually work in the biggest tech company in the world.” Estelle stuttered out, proud and happy for her friend.
Regas cheerfully nodded as he started to walk toward the pointed direction, not even pausing to let Grid on the ground.
The first kid, Alexander Motomiya, was curled up on his chest, his back against the couch. The other kid, Tsuki Motomiya, was curled up right next to her brother, her arm thrown over him while her legs were tucked under Alexander’s. Over his legs were the two digimon, Sunmon and Moonmon, who were in a ying yang shaped ball right on his knees.
“But it’s also fun, I love seeing everyone’s reaction if we do a larger bet.” Harry said, yawning from how tired it was.
“Very well, but you haven’t had any fights with the other dragons have you?” Robin asks, watching in amusement as the Shepherds pale.
“Sure honey.” Tony leaned his head back against Steve’s broad chest, feeling content and safe and happy.
“Meh somewhat, I was up until around 1 doing my homework. I should probably take a nap or something since I’m gonna be really tired the rest of the day if not.” Harry muttered the last part.
After a few minutes passed, Steve was thinking on what to do, he wanted to ask Tony out on a date but didn’t know if Tony would say yes since they just met, eventually he decided to say fuck it.
Tony leans back and looks around him staring at all of his lovers, before sighing in contentment and sitting back and watching the movie with them.
Cedric finally seemed to wake up, and asked in confusion, “What the hell? How many bets do you have going?” The others seemed to agree with his sentiment.
The others looked scandalized at the many classes, while Pepper just groaned pitiously, “I swear to god you stupid motherfucker, you better not have taken any hard classes.”
“I decided to do something a little out of the ordinary so I wanted to know if I could tell you guys about it.” Grid winked at them, grin wide on his face.
The others all sat down, restless with anticipation on what Aether could be doing today, but they all resolved to do their commissions and wait for Aether on Starsnatch Cliff.
It was a rather nice day out in Manhattan as the clouds were not seen and the sun was shining brightly.
“Robin…” Chrom trails off, unsure how to continue now that he has his full attention, “I, uh, I have something to tell you?”
“I don’t know, it’s been 3 years hasn’t it? You reckon you can help me?” Daisuke questions, butterflies in his stomach as he lets the secret loose.
Chrom grunts as he parries an attack meant for Lissa, who’s currently healing Vaike and Sully, as the rest of the Shepherds converge around them, enemies slowly closing in on them. Suddenly Robin and a strange girl burst through the enemies, killing them all as they twist and weave to a harp.
“All right here’s the pizza and drinks for Clint and Bucky.” Tony said, setting it down in front of them, both of them saying a quick thank you.
Harry walked out of the common room and quickly walked through the halls toward the Great Hall. In a few minutes Harry arrived at the rather empty Great Hall.
Right behind Aether was another table which contained Zhongli, Xiao, Ganyu, Tartaglia, and Albedo who were just watching in silence and drinking their Dandelion wine.
Harry groaned as he woke up, rubbing his eyes, as he forced himself awake. He took a glance around and smiled when he saw the others, Neville, Ron, Seamus, and Dean, were all dead asleep and snoring in their beds. Harry got out of bed and quickly got dressed and walked out into the common room.
Yuri fondly thought of the chaotic moments in the house after he found a big enough one with the money he earned, having gotten a job as a Tech assistant to earn money and a stable house to adopt Rita and Karol. At first it was rather tense as Rita and Karol were getting too used to the fact that they were adopted, and that the fact that their father is only 3 year older than Rita, not that it mattered much as Rita loved living with Yuri and Karol as a family. About 2 weeks after they both started to call him Papa or Father, and they let themselves be more at ease with him and more cuddly.
Harry finds gifts for all of his friends, has an argument with Ron and Hermione about his weapons in the great hall, and finds love in Cedric.
“He’s asking if you’re Italian.” Bucky gruffed as he sat down next to Thor who sat on Bruce’s right. Natasha, Wanda, and Clint sat opposite the 3 men with Steve sitting at one end of the table leaving the last spot open for Tony.
“Yes before my home planet was wiped out, we were all immortal beings because our life force was in the stars. Me and my sister kept our stars inside ourselves so we didn’t die when something wiped out the rest of the stars, and ever since me and my sister have been travelling for a few millenia looking for somewhere to settle down.”
The others all nodded as they gathered their stuff and stood up, Cedric and Theo to Harry’s right and Viktor and Fleur to his left.
“We will talk later now, let us sing and dance my darling star.” Elena says, a fierce look of determination adorning her face as she preps her harp.
So like hope you enjoy more fluff, I'll try to update Hidden Secrets but I don't know when, especially when school is starting in like 3-4 weeks, and thats gonna be stressful as all hell. And like I know that people have asked for commissions for writing, and like I'm trying to do them but my motivation comes in short bursts, and my head is constantly filled with different ideas so I'm trying.
“T-too c-cold. R-reactor.” Tony stuttered out, trying to bring his arms up to cover his chest. Steve and Bucky pick Tony up, carrying him over to the large 12 person couch.
“Yea, have a safe trip home.” Robin says, pulling them both in a tight hug, “Bring Yuna next time, maybe she’ll love whatever she can find here.”
Tony blinked and tilted his head, causing Meg to coo at how cute he looked, “Sure sure M, I’ll text you tonight.”
Harry shook his head in amusement, “Nope we actually ask each other for stuff,” Harry looked up and down the corridor and thought to ask them but thought again, “Actually I’ll tell you guys somewhere else, I don’t want anyone to overhear.”
Meg offered a worried smile, “I know hun but you really need sleep.” She made an ‘oh’ sound before she scribbled something on a piece of paper, handing it off to Tony.
Tony glanced down and saw that she added her name with a little smiley face, he glanced up at her questionably.
“Oh we’re going deep.” Yuri mutters as he places down his cup of coffee and looks at Flynn, who’s looking at him through the corner of his eye, “Then would you like to tell me the reason now?”
Flynn felt like he was riding a cloud to heaven, finally tasting Yuri’s soft lips and the sweet taste of coffee with blueberries.
“Thankfully my assistant is amazing and helps with a lot, and the two companies who are supposed to be my enemies, are instead some of my close friends and they help me a lot.” Daisuke perks up as he looks at the mansion on the outskirts of Tokyo, “Oh we’re here.”
‘After that I completely stopped talking to Flynn, Sodia, Judith, Estelle and their friends. Partly because I don’t want to reveal that Flynn was an asshole to Judith and Estelle, both of whom are close to Sodia.’ Yuri shook his head to clear his thoughts as he thought of the after, ‘About 5 days after the break up, I was passing by an orphanage where I met little Karol, and after a week of getting to know him and his older sister, Rita, I decided to adopt them making them Karol and Rita Lowell.’
“I mean sure, I’m just a lot more tired than I was before. I’m constantly up until 2 in the morning each day, and I only get around 4 hours of sleep but I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”
Tony practically vibrated in his chair with excitement as they regaled him with tales of what’s been happening in their respective areas (Rhodey, Pepper and Happy in California and Bruce in India).
“Raven, just admit it already you are an old drunk.” Yuri huffed, picking himself up before taking Karol in one hand and Rita under his other, “The only thing you do is drink, it’s a good thing you’re a high functioning alcoholic cause I’d kick your ass for drinking around my kids.”
Grid tilted his head as he watched his fellow guild members, the ones that survived that is, party after they defeated the 6th mage of the Vatan Church. Jishuka was harshly reprimanding everyone while Laella tried to calm her down. Regas, Grid blushed as he watched him, was doing some shadow boxing while Faker, Pon, and Zednos watched with amused smiles.
“You better, we want to make sure you’re okay. You’ve really been worrying me these past few days.” Meg’s worried voice called from behind him.
“Awwww King Kitty you remembered.” Tony;s voice echoed throughout the room, causing everyone to turn to him. They were taking a break from negotiations to eat some dinner and on Tony’s plate was a wakandan speciality with a large pile of metal scraps right next to the plate.
“Thanks Henry.” Daisuke smiles at him, watching Henry blink in surprise at how Daisuke knew his name.
“I only hate Malfoy and his entourage, you’ve never been part of them so I have no reason to hate you.” Harry reassured the tense Theo, smiling when he relaxed, “And in response to your question, we have no idea. We started doing it in the first year and we just kept doing it every year. Now it's just fun, especially with the rewards we give out.”
Harry took off his shoes, pulling them up and laying them in Theo’s lap, and placed his head in Cedric’s lap.
‘It’s been three years since I’ve seen them,’ Daisuke sadly thought, reaching over and tracing the last picture he had of them before he went AWOL, ‘I’ll see them today but I wonder how they’ll react.’
“I missed you too Flynn.” Yuri wrapped his arms tight around Flynn, thinking that if he let’s go then he’ll lose him again, “Do you want to go back to my place and cuddle? Watch a movie or something?”
Tony looked surprised as no one made a pass on him in quite a few years, and considering the one who just made the pass looks like Adonis, Tony was shocked.
They got up, Yuri leaving a tip on the table after paying the check, and they walked off hand in hand, holding tight as if afraid to let go.
“Wait what do you mean help you out in the lab? I thought they were just AI bots that could move and understand.” Bruce asks, feeling confused.
“Yes I can communicate with them telepathically. Even if they don’t know much about coding and are much better at helping me out in the lab.” Tony waves it off.
“Yea I’m the only one willing to be his therapist about him since I can be neutral towards him.” Tony says before he goes over to the kitchen just as he sees Thor come over, a moody expression fell over his face as he sat down on the couch.
Daisuke walked out of the bathroom, towel on his wet hair, and grin in place, watching Takeru look around in wonder.
“Well we can talk more tomorrow, I actually want to sleep right now.” Daisuke stretches a bit, before he grabs Takeru and drags him along, “You’re also coming with me. The maids will show you your rooms.”
“Have I ever said that I love you and you are the best boyfriend ever?” Steve whispers as he turns around, his head carefully placed on the lip of the tub to keep him from diving in the water.
“Enough small talk. Tell me what classes you’re taking.” Pepper demanded, pointing at Tony almost looking like a regal queen.
Tony quietly blushed at the praise, causing Steve to internally coo at how cute he looked, and as soon as that happened Steve realised that he had a huge massive crush on this guy he just met.
“You can lay down on me and Theo if you really want to sleep.” Cedric asked, a light blush on his face as he saw the teasing smirks on Fleur and Viktor’s face.
“C-can you kiss me?” Flynn questions, as he leans into Yuri, uncertain if he asked an unreasonable request or not.
“Robin.” Yufine excitedly says as she hugs Robin into her bosom, suffocating him, “It’s been so long, we’ve missed you.”
It’s been a while since Grid joined their guild and he’s been thinking of doing something completely unexpected that he thought he’d never do, make equipment for people without asking for gold in return.
“Yep.” Harry said, as he walked forward before coming back, doing that three times. Everyone jumped as a door appeared to their right, Harry walking up and opening it without hesitation. He held open the door as everyone filed in, and when closed it disappeared to everyone’s confusion. They chalked it off as magic and looked around the room they found themselves in.
“An accident my ass, that was the 300th time I had to do that. Honestly with your stupid ass I can become a Medi-Wizard without even having to go to an actual school for it.”
They soon reach the camp as everyone disperses, the Shepherds shooting Robin with indecipherable glances, as they all think about what they learned.
Tony shuffles, hopping right left, before he blushes and starts to stammer, “W-well i-if you guys don’t mind….”
“How many categories do you have?” Steve questioned, shy smile in place with a hint of red dusting on his cheeks.
Aether immediately went back to writing on his paper and after a few seconds realized that it became absolutely silent in the bar, he raised his head and looked to see everyone, even the normally stoic people, have wide eyes and dropped jaws in astonishment, even the normal unflappable Katheryne is shocked.
So recently I've also been playing a lot of Genshin Impact and have fallen in love with it, and I love baby boy Aether. I decided to write about Aether offering worship to his parents since I assume they're dead, haven't gotten past Liyue in the story so some characters are off or don't have lines here but they're still there.
He grinned at his girlfriends, and wow wasn’t that a major surprise to him since he almost never had a healthy relationship, and gestured at them to follow him.
Bellissima thrills as vines grow from the ground and grab a basket of puffs before Bellissima takes off into the air, vines trailing behind her with the basket.
Daisuke just handed the noodles to the guy, turning around to continue cleaning when the guy started screaming about this being the most perfect bowl of noodles he’s ever had. The rest of the day passed by in a blur when the guy brought him to his office and all of a sudden Daisuke is the CEO of the Hakamura group, the leading company in the noodle field.
“Oh geez I forgot that I told no one about this.” Tony tiredly rubbed a hand at the bridge of his nose.
Daisuke lightly groaned as he slightly moved, careful not to dislodge the four lumps laying on him. He blearily rubbed his eyes as he yawned, waking up fully as he glanced down. Laying over his chest and legs were 2 kids and 2 digimon, all laying in strewn out positions.
“W-wait.” Ken’s stutter didn’t go unnoticed as he bypassed a confused Takeru and Hikaru, going to stand in front of the guy, “I-Is that really?”
“Sorry Sorry but a lot of shit went down. I'll explain it to all of you eventually.” Daisuke assures Taichi as he notices his confused expression, “Let’s just meet everyone first.”
Thor agreed and they stayed silent as they were watching the movie and eventually fell asleep to the soft sound of fighting from the TV.
Yuri grins at that, “Yep but she never liked staying in one place too long so her father said that if she can sufficiently protect herself then she’s free to do whatever she wants, which is good cause her brother can inherit the lordship in her place, leaving her free to travel.”
“Me and my girlfriend are happy to help you at any time. Just text or call for anything, even if you just want to talk.” Meg winked as she ripped off a receipt and handed it to Tony, his usual order of two black coffee’s with some added blueberry pastries.
Tony grabs the papers and places them into a briefcase that he had as he glanced up at Steve, “You’re free to come back whenever you want. The compound has been the exact same since I’ve been living in the tower working with my lawyers to create these and working with my engineers.”
“Why thank you.” Tony blushed as he stammered unsure of the praise, the others watching in slight concern of how Tony is unable to take a compliment.
After coming back from a long and tiring mission, Tony decides to surprise the team with home cooked Italian.
“I’m pretty sure all of us are having a foodgasm right now.” Steve dryly says, trying to hide his small moans of appreciation.
Steve sat down while Tony immediately laid down and leaned right on Steve. Steve unsure of what to do, froze for a moment before he brought his hand up and wrapped it around Tony’s shoulder, pulling him into his side more. They silently ate their cakes while Clint put on some type of action movie from Tony’s massive collection.
“Robin cuddles?” was heard from several of the Shepherds as they stared at the group in front of them.
Tony offered a frail smile, running a hand through grease soaked hair, knowing he looked horrible. He had dark blue bruises of sleep under his eyes, with exhaustion seeping through every muscle. His clothes looked like they’d been worn all week, which is exactly what happened, and his posture slipped into a low slouch.
“We will.” Elena regally nods, placing a kiss on Robin’s cheek, as Yufine does so on the other side.
Tony glances at him before turning around to glare at Bellissima, “Yea since I’ve been with her so long I got used to understanding her different pitches and matching them to words. Now I can understand anything she says.”
So this is a small funny idea I had, "What if they did everything using bets?" And I also love Harry becoming friends with the other Triwizard champions, and he starts to date Cedric and Theodore Nott (My all time fav threesome) and it just rolled into this.
“Mo chuid bia go leor, ach faoi deara.” Tony grinned through the blush as Steve just stared gobsmacked at Tony.
Aether sat at a high chair in front of Diluc right by the bar, currently focused on the paper in front of him. Venti was sitting next to him, merrily laughing and drinking Dandelion wine, happily chatting with Rosaria, Barbara, and Bennett. Sitting at a table right next behind Barbara was Jean, Kaeya, Lisa, and Amber who were discussing their jobs and commissions for the rest of the day.
“We won’t be needed anymore today, let’s sleep now.” Robin tugs Chrom over to the bed, both getting dressed in lighter sleeping clothes, as they lay side by side.
They take off leaving a smiling Robin along with a contemplative Lissa and Chrom. Robin turns around and spots Chrom and Lissa, standing just behind him.
“Well I don't have much to do today so we can just walk back for a bit if you want.” Grid suggested as he pointed towards the horizon.
Without any more questions, JARVIS restarted the movie while the others all got comfortable in their previous positions. Only thing that changed was that Steve had Tony’s feet in his lap as Tony spread out on the couch.
‘Who knew that I would end up liking Takeru after realizing that my feelings for Hikari was pure friendship, but I guess it was good I moved before realizing.’ Davis thought, his face contorting into a contemplative face. ‘I found out I was aromantic and asexual after I moved, only after I talked too an employee of mine who was able to help me realize. Sadly I haven't been able to see them for the last 2 years, not even any messages, today will be the first time I see them so I hope they enjoy my surprise.’
Tony grinned as he got confirmation that in another week, all four of them would be coming over to help him with the cafe. Pepper would help him with finances, Bruce would be the wizard in the kitchen with JOCASTA, and Happy and Rhodey would just help out occasionally when he had a sudden influx of customers.
Daisuke’s grin softed as he crossed the distance, bringing in Takeru for a soft kiss before backing away.
Harry had to pause and think about it, causing the others to stare even harder in disbelief, “I think we’re at around 400 current bets, Mione has the actual record, but only around 100 are currently done and over with. The rest take years to actually be done and we also add a good few every day.”
“Sure.” Steve rolled his eyes, but didn’t stop the fond smile that grew on his face, completely ignoring all the looks they received as he bent down and kissed Tony’s head. “Good night.”
“Robin.” She says softly, not noticing the risen coming her way but is bisected by a large serrated sword belonging to Yufine.
So I added a bit about Aromantic and Asexual stuff in here for once, It's something that I've learned about myself a few months ago, and seeing how there isn't enough representation in fanfiction about it I decided to write a lot oof stories about aromantic and asexual things.
Everyone turned toward the voice, except Raven who vanished with a quick smile at Yuri’s nod, and saw a woman wearing little clothing (Imagine a girl wearing Olivia’s (Fire Emblem Awakening Olivia) dancer outfit) as she walked toward them.
Jishuka was next to Laella and Faker, talking about where they were going to look for the production recipe and hunt for the materials.
A hand hovered over his food, making him stop and stare at the incredulous looks of his team. Scott speaks up, feeling horrified and slightly guilty, “What do you mean you can’t see it? You should feel the dislocated shoulder and broken ulna and radius.”
“But I’m nothing special, I’m not pretty or anything important. I’m just a nobody.” Tony whispered softly.
The kiss ended sooner than they both wanted, as they moved away and looked disappointedly at their lips. But soon they both grinned at each other, euphoria surrounding them, feeling a lost piece of their souls sliding back into place.
Daisuke ended the call and walked back to the group, who all looked to be finally processing the information.
Tony waved it off, “Not many people do since they would definitely try to get them from me and dissect them. I don’t try to advertise what I can actually create.”
The Avengers were out on the balcony playing around in the snow, which was being helped by Thor’s powers. Steve and Bucky were wrestling out in snow, laughing and giggling while shoveling snow down each other's shirts. Thor and Bruce were nearby watching the scene, shaking heads in amusement. Wanda and Pietro were making a small snowman on the bar of the balcony.
Lady Aphrodite friends- Close friends that know everything and anything, including panic attacks, allergies, and anything of importance. Current: 1
“Why not just make a schedule? There’s 6 of us and the last day we can make it a day for all of us.” Wanda rolled her eyes as she mentally made a rough schedule for them.
Robin tilts his head in askance, “Hush they only did that for jokes in front of me, they never told anyone but they definitely cuddled me close when they found me.”
“Yea well this shit is tiring.” Daisuke sighs, running a hand through his hair, “Hold up lemme call Veemon to get the kids, they need to sleep.”
“Goodnight my star.” Robin softly says, wrapping his arms around Chrom’s midsection, falling asleep intertwined with soft smiles on their faces.
Steve turned around, face aflame in red, “Will you go out on a date with me? I know it’s sudden but it feels like we have a connection somehow.”
“Don’t try to change the subject my star” Elena pinches Robin on the cheek, “You do need a husband, the amount of times I had to stop someone from attacking you is far too many.”
“Yea unfortunately in the business world if you don’t arrive in style then it won’t work.” Daisuke tiredly sighs, thinking back to all the moments.
They place Tony down in between them, crossing arms over the reactor covering Tony in warmth. The others take up positions around Tony, each bringing a blanket to cover each other with.
“Also Veemon brought up a good point, he asked if you all wanted to have a sleepover at my house.” Daisuke said.
Yuri went to visit Flynn, who was his boyfriend around 5 months ago, and found him kissing Sodia, and it looked like it was about to go farther. Yuri gave a heartbroken look to them before he hightailed it out of there, resolving to not talk to any of them again. The next day, Flynn came over and broke up with Yuri, in which Yuri accepted, based on what he saw yesterday he knew that Flynn didn’t look like he loved Yuri anymore.
Tony squirmed in his seat, ignoring the concerned glances from the two blondes, the two red heads, and the two brown heads.
“That’s it baby, feels good doesn’t it?” Tony coos at Steve as he squirts some body wash onto the scrubber.
“All done.” Tony grinned before he turned around to Wanda doing the exact same treatment and at the end they all felt relaxed.
Steve flopped down with a groan, “Tired and sore everywhere, my back is killing me, my arms and legs are sore, and I have a horrible migraine.”
“Ummmm 5.” Tony said, a question in the air, and as Pepper still glared at him he deflated and responded glumly, “12.”
That afternoon the Avengers would learn that they’ve been wrong about the man with the pokesoul of a Beautifly.
There were a few kids from each house milling around their tables, quietly chatting and eating. At the Slytherin table was Daphne Greengrass along with her friend Tracey Davis. Right next to them at the Ravenclaw table was Luna Lovegood who was quietly talking about her mysterious creatures. Right next to Luna was the Hufflepuff table who only had one occupant, Cedric Diggory, who gave a nod and quick smile in Harry’s blushing direction. At the teacher’s table was Pomona Sprout and Filius Flitwick.
Daisuke softly laughs as he tugs the kids in his lap, the girls cooing how cute they are in their dress and suit respectively, “Nope not married, I ran into these two in an abandoned orphanage and after gaining their trust I adopted them. I also found out they have Digimon.”
“Ahhh that feels good.” Tony sighed in satisfaction as his muscles untensed under the hot water spray.
Tony Stark (Not billionaire just a normal Stark family and regular income) owns a cafe called worldwide where he works as the Waiter, Chef, and Cashier. He has JARVIS working the cashier when he’s away and JOCASTA working the kitchen. His cafe is unique as there is no menu and everyone can order whatever they want from whatever culture or heritage and JOCASTA will cook it.
‘Man I don’t know what I would do without Ri and Kar, they are my whole life now, I can’t imagine a life without them,’ Yuri fondly recalled as he thought of his past a “Don’t care” kind of guy, ‘They really changed me, and I even told them about my secret friend that no one knows about, making them very excited to meet her.’
Robin comes to a stop as he hears a harp being played in the distance, heart beating fast as he recognizes the steady beat of harp and starlight.
A few weeks later comes a large fight against the Risen as they venture forward to Tiki’s abode to talk to Naga through her. Robin slowly moves forward, shouting and shooting Thunder from his tome and swipes with his sword.
Bellissima let out a sad thrill as she stared at Tony, everyone still confused as shit about everything.
Soon after everyone finished their food, placed all the dishes into the sink, and each took a slice of cake into the living room. Clint and Natasha curled up on one of the single couches to the left with Thor and Bruce taking the couch right next to them. Wanda took the single couch to the right with Bucky laying on the couch there leaving only one couch right in front of the TV for Steve and Tony.
Tony waves his hand nonchalantly, not paying mind to the nauseous looks of the others, “I could handle them, I got all the backup armor in the lab to fight an army.”
“I’m a computer Bruce, I can get hacked and get viruses even if I add multiple firewalls.” Tony deadpans at Bruce.
Throughout the room was more tinsel along with other floating candles and other ornaments, all floating throughout the room.
Daisuke walks forward, leaving Alexander and Tsuki with Veeemon, and starts to go into the direction he’s memorized 3 years ago. On the way, Daisuke’s mind threatens to overwhelm him with “what-if” instances, but he pushes the thoughts to the back of his mind as he gets closer.
Tony pulled Steve into the bedroom and sat him on the bed, “Now you get undressed and I’ll go set up the bath for you and then I’ll lead you in.”
“Songstress let us sing and dance, it has been so long since we have.” Robin tugs Elena toward the camp, as the Shepherds follow behind.
Evidently as Davisuke gets closer, the others start to notice the stranger (In their eyes, Daisuke reasons, especially with how much he’s changed) and Taichi slowly jogs up to meet him.
Pepper perked up, immediately dissecting the information, “Oh really you upgraded two people up on your list. What level?”
Daisuke pulled out a white button up shirt along with black dress pants and walked into the bathroom, quickly taking a shower. He dries himself off and pulls on the clothes, pulling his long hair into a loose ponytail.
Tony has Congenital Analgesia, meaning he doesn't feel any pain at all. The team finds out that Tony has this when he resets his dislocated shoulder and splints his arm. The Avengers then decide to confess to Tony and watch out for him on the field. Part of the team don't have any speaking but everyone is still there.
Steve shrugs, “I have no problems with sharing Tony, we’d just need to make a schedule to keep things in order.”
“Honestly, no reason. I like you guys so Imma make you some equipment, also the pseudo-quest has no time limit, you have as long as you want to do it.”
“Why should I have gone to the hospital if I didn’t feel anything. I thought I was okay until I stepped out of my suit, but I’ve done this hundreds of times by myself.” Tony waves off the looks as he starts to prepare his bread.
Yuri glances up with a smile, Flynn’s shocked face and Estelle’s wide eyes greeting him, “She’s my oldest friend, about 3 years before I met Flynn, I met Olivia and we hit it off and started to correspond with letters.” Yuri glances at them and starts again, “And before you say why I didn’t introduce her, she usually travels all over the world so I never know when I’ll meet her again, I haven’t seen her in 5 years, well besides facetime and texts, so there was never a good time to mention her.”
While Thor is thinking about his brother, his mood starts to deteriorate, causing the others to not know what to do. Tony jumps in and saves the day with cuddles, blankets, hot chocolate, and a movie. The others get jealous.
Tony walked out into the bathroom before he set the water to a temperature bordering on too hot. He set out some shampoo, body wash, conditioner, and a scrubber before he laid out a couple fluffy towels. When the tub filled up he turned off the water, and preparing for Steve, he took off his shirt and set it aside. He walks into the bedroom and sees Steve completely naked on the bed, showing off his whole glory. Tony ignores that and takes his boyfriend, by the hand, into the bathroom.
“Hah no thanks, I don’t need a husband.” Robin stubbornly says, not noticing Chrom’s pinched expression. “Anyway how are you and Ray doing? Enjoying married life?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermine have done everything by bets. Doing the homework, let's make a bet, being partners in class, let's make a bet, etc. Harry walks through the hallways grumbling about his last loss when he runs into Cedric, Viktor, Fleur, and Theodore.
This startles a laugh out of Tony, causing Steve to melt as he listens to the sound, “No not just for that. DUM-E is able to code and hack. Butterfingers is the doctor able to perform surgery while also being able to engrave. Finally U is the producer, producing all of my materials needed for making anything I have.”
“Ummmm.” Tony smartly responded, still processing the statement in his head, “Wait really? All of you?”
“Ve just heard what you vere talking about and it amused us.” Viktor explained, seeing as Cedric and Theo were still not talking.
Daisuke stretched, loosening his muscles and popping his bones, as he walked up to the master suite.
Daisuke lets the smile fall as he sighs, “I know you meant about actually seeing Takeru, wondering if he has a girlfriend or something, and about seeing the rest of our friends that we haven’t seen in 3 years, including my family. I’m nervous, extremely so, but we just have to deal.”
Harry was about to start again before he noticed that it was suddenly quiet in the hall. He glanced up and saw the four looking at him, Cedric and Theo looked to be lightly blushing and gaping while Viktor and Fleur looked amused.
“Sure dad,” Rita hesitates before she leans up and places a kiss on Yuri’s cheek, leaning back and blushing, “Be careful you hear.”
Tony hummed as he ran a hand over Bellissima’ wings, “Well she wanted me to set her a pretty strict training schedule because she thinks what I had her doing before is too light. Now she does two trips across the Pacific Ocean to England twice a day at her highest speed. Flying push-ups with two boulders tied to her waist. After that is two hours straight of move training endurance. Followed by move strategy by watching challenges.”
“Man was that a dump.” Takeru broke the silence, causing everyone to laugh out loud, a hint of hysteria in their tones.
“So if they want the info, they’d have to kill you?” Steve asks, feeling slightly nauseous at the thought of a dead Tony.
It was a rather large work space in the shape of a small n. It had 3 large tables on both sides with 8 chairs at every table, all decorated with fresh roses in the middle on top of some embroidery. The entrance to the kitchen was located right in front of the main entrance, with a counter extending the whole backway of the shop. Over to Tony’s left (He’s sitting on a chair facing the main entrance) was a glass display case showcasing sandwiches, cake pops, doughnuts, various cake slices, and other sweets and food all freshly baked and ready to sell.
Harry laughed nervously as he grabbed a knife and twirled it around his hand, “Sorry ‘Mione, they have a mind of their own.”
“What the hell is going on in your life that Veemon is working?” Yamato speaks up, wondering what’s going on.
Bruce, Thor, Wanda, and Sam took the long couch that was lined diagonally from the recliner with Clint and Natasha. Bruce’s Vileplume laid by his feet dozing lightly, Thor’s Raichu was seated on his shoulder, Sam’s Staraptor was on the other wooden peg right next to Braviary, and Wanda’s Alakazam was meditating right behind her.
Last thing I promise, I decided to stop adding the characters and just start putting "Epic Seven Characters" (For example), cause I didn't want to add so many tags, I already feel like I have way too many so I wanna put the least amount possible from now on.
“Hush children I finished the Pastina, Spaghetti alla Carbonara and the Ciambotta. The frittata is almost finished along with the chicken gnocchi soup and the Tiramisu is just chilling.”
Tony turned around and saw the three patiently waiting bots, “Thank god you guy’s didn’t fuck anything up this time. I don’t want to have to donate you to a collage.”
Eventually she got to Aether but before she could hand them over, Aether raised up a hand and said apologetically, “Sorry I won’t be able to handle the commissions today, I have something else to do.”
“Sometimes.” Robin says, “They usually last around 4 hours after they appear, and after they stay gone for around 2 weeks before they come back. So if they miss the 4 hour mark they’re stuck here, or us stuck there for 2 weeks.”
The others nod in agreement, making Tony brighten up. Tony walks around and offers a kiss to all of them.
“Just some old friends who invited me today.” Yuri says as he glances at them and points them out, “That’s Flynn, Sodia, Judith, and Estelle and whoever else they decided to bring.
Soon the thirty minutes were over and Tony came out holding two large plates, three robotic hands trailing after him.
“You’re a goddamn giant is what you are.” Taichi throws in the last shot as they stand in front of the group.
“Yes,” Robin nods, “Those Chaos Rifts allow you to travel through to their world, so I traveled through it. I fought in many wars and battles with them on my side, it was a good time.” Robin wistfully sighs.
Olivia again ignores Flynn’s breath of relief and Sodia’s fury, beaming up at Flynn, “But darling what a way to confuse everyone, you know you like it.”
“Wanna study together?” Steve asked as he moved over next to Tony, also blushing full bright when Tony nodded, smiling goofily.
“This is Natasha Romanov.” Taller redhead gave nothing besides staring at Tony with a piercing look.
Tony gave an unimpressed stare as he replied, “Yes because I am very much gay and my future bf or hubby, if I have one by then, will be the opposing groomsmen. If not Arthur, my other friend, will fill in with me. Also yes I will be wearing a dress, I don’t give a fuck what people say and I will absolutely rock it with 5 inch heels.”
“Hey Tony back for more?” Meg, the cashier, greeted with an easy smile which turned into a worried frown as she took in Tony’s appearance, “You should get some sleep, you look horrible.”
“Well at least it’s going to be comfortable.” Takeru shrugs as he gets into the car, everyone following behind him.
Daisuke, surprised at how Taichi seems so close to crying, only nods and barely has time to catch a flailing Taichi. Daisuke grabs Taichi as he tugs him up, getting him into a better hugging position, uncaring of the shocked looks aimed their way.
One thing too keep in mind is that everything I write is basically taken from my POV, so this is how I feel about it all,
Veemon, Alexander, and Tsuki follow them as they pick up their luggage and walk to the entrance of Odaiba Park.
Harry grabs the weapons as he shoves them back in the bag  and walks  out, but stops as he hears a “Wait I’ll come also.”
“Thanks Alex, Tsuki.” Daisuke picks them up, a soft smile on his face, as he sits down next to Veemon.
Chrom doesn’t say anything as he stands up and closes the distance between them, leaving them standing chest to chest. Chrom raises a hand and cups Robin’s cheek, leaning forward slowly and finally meeting Robin’s soft velvety lips. Chrom groaned at the feeling, tasting the blueberries that Robin ate at breakfast, and feeling the heat go to his gut.
Steve stared at Tony, bringing up a hand to cup Tony’s face, gently lifting it up to stare at Steve in surprise.
“I know, I know but I didn’t trust any of you at the moment, even if I acted like I did.” At their downtrodden looks, Tony hurriedly continued, “It wasn’t because of anything you guys did, I became part of a team almost as soon as Stane almost killed me, my trust towards anyone was broken. Eventually I started to trust you more but I just never had a good time to tell you guys. But now you know so you can help make sure I’m not dying.”
Harry smiled some more as he saw all  the christmas decorations lining the common room. There was a christmas tree in the corner of the room, adorned with globes of spinning light. There was sparkly tinsel lining the arms of the tree, with little army men marching to an invisible beat. The star was brightly shining, matching the shine of the fireplace.
“Kids want to go play with Coronamon and Lunamon? The adults are going to do some boring adult talking.” Daisuke speaks softly to them, whose faces scrunched in distaste before they ran off with their digimon.
Once he gets a little closer he can spot the people he’s longed to see for 3 years. Mimi and Sora, both grown up and older, are off to one side setting up a table laden with food. Next to them is Jou and Koushiro, both manning the DJ station, while Taichi and Yamato run around making sure everything is done. Hikari and Takeru are off to one side, talking quietly while making party supplies for the get-together. Inoue, Ken, and Iori are all at one table, all of them not having anything to do and stay talking quietly. Surprisingly Jun is also there, helping around all the circles.
The only people who knew how Tony acted and his usual ticks would be Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy. Rhodey knew because he’s been with him for 20 years and Rhodey knows him inside out. Pepper and Happy know because they see past his various facades and over time Tony learned to trust them with his usual cuddle hungry self.
“Are you guys busy after this?” Grid spoke up, slotting the sword into his inventory. Everyone stopped what they were doing and looked over at Grid.
“Of course my dear songstress.” Robin bows, and to the tune of Elena, dances around the enemies with Thoron at his fingertips.
Aether stood up as he lit the lantern and walked to the edge of the cliff, before he whispered a foreign prayer and let the lantern fly upward into the night sky.
Steve let out a quiet huff, staring at Tony adoringly, for he only knew the guy for a few hours but he was already in love.
Steve was not stupid. He didn't miss the way his teammates conversation would often dwindle to a hush the moment he entered a room. Or the way they all had started acting as if they were  walking on eggshells when around him.  Treating him as if he was too fragile to handle the "truth". Tony had become the taboo subject that was on all their minds, but which none would dare to speak of.
Tony nodded mutely, legs almost seeming to give out as he sat down heavily on the edge of the mattress. It was like all his earlier bravado had suddenly deserted him.  Steve followed suit a few seconds later, staring at him intently.
With his slightly exposed flesh , and strained expression, Steve thought Tony looked gorgeous. It was almost a shame there was no way for him to join in.
Steve still held his silence, and Tony shrugged before continuing his story at a faster pace," Not too long after I ran into the Beyonder."
"I know . Just..." Steve paused, trying and failing to put sentiments into words, " ..just let me do this." FTony seemed to understand fortunately. The frown on his face softening just a little as he tilted his head to the side in open invitation.
The Beyonder was formidable no doubt, perhaps their strongest foe yet, but together..together Steve felt they would prevail. And as he felt himself also start to drift off, he was certain that for the first time in months,  there'd be no nightmares.
Steve would have been content to drink in the moment forever. His entire being reverberated with all consuming fact.. Tony was alive!
A hastily scribbled, but seductively enticing note  left in their shared  bedroom would get the ball rolling.  Purposely mysterious, but all the more tempting  because of it, with just enough of a hint to insinuate that good times were just ahead. (He had even left the little winking face ;) ) It would be the perfect balm after a rough day at work, and hopefully a birthday Tony would remember for years to come.
After  Steve had helped Tony clean up from the ordeal,  the two of them had spent the rest of the night cuddling and making gentle love to one another.  Tony who was wrecked but, deeply, blissfully,  satisfied had conked out in the comfort of Steve's arms not too long after.
For several moments he remained thus, poised statue still  in empty room  that had been his home for the last few weeks. In the stale silence ,  his breathing came out unaturally loud, while  shadows stretched out to obscure  every corner. It was these moments, at his most vulnerable, where the demons that haunted him would come out to play.  They'd dig their claws in, playing into his worst fears, while almost vertigo inducing waves of grief threatened to upend him.
Instinctively he turned to make a move. At the exact moment,  a voice called out to him, stopping him dead  in his tracks. Turning around he was greeted by blonde  woman dressed in a crisp business attire hurrying to meet him.
Steve had watched the entire time as the tentacles continued their attack in a thrusting, throbbing, slick ,many limbed assault until finally,  a pressure point had been breached.
Steve cleared his throat, and tried to steer Tony away from brooding too much," Also I think it's safe to say we were making fair progress toward restoring relations between Inhumans and humans.", he added in a desperate effort to bring some good news.." Just like you wanted."
Steve paused in stroking Tony's hair, "You've been through hell. " It was not a question. Once again he felt the all too familiar  pang of guilt that he hadn't been able to do more.
The only detail  which gave any indication that he was indeed at the right location was the sign out front, hereupon  the company name was written in a bold green lettering evocative of some sort of leviathan monstrosity. Underneath this, a smaller line of text proudly proclaimed " for all your fantasies, fiendish or fun". And below that, in even smaller script of  lovingly embellished cursive  "established 2010"
Only Tony had gone where he hadn't been able to follow, and Steve had never felt less worthy of the Captain America mantle.
"Yes." Steve answered, feeling what he considered  a justified amount of pride. In the ensuing silence, the only sound was a series of  wet squelching sounds as the tentacles continued to explore. Steve assumed Tony was rendered speechless with gratitude.
"You were in there for a while." Steve explained, suddenly feeling very sheepish," I thought something might have happened to you."
"Other than the fact that I'm pretty sure I saw my life flash before my eyes during that group hug?", Tony paused in his wandering long enough  to shoot Steve a sardonic look," peachy."
After being starved of affection for so long, both men had fallen into one another's presence vigorously, ravenously. Starting with sweet, hot kisses in tender spots, and  quickly evolving into more. In the dim room, their taut  bodies were silhouetted  by the pale blue light cast from the arc reactor. The silence punctuated only by Steve's growling voice, hot and low in his throat,  and Tony's sweet desperate moans. It was as desperate as it was quick, just long enough to sate that need which had been itching at both of them for months.
Most telling of all , was the anger he directed at himself. It was less explosive, but no less vitriol, being  more of a slow burn nagging feel which left him all  hollow and burned out inside. This self hatred was  kindled by the guilt that he should have done more, should have tackled it together.
But was it really the only choice? He would never know, but always wonder. Fate was set in stone. For better or worse there was no bargaining.
His nerves felt flayed and skinned almost down to the bare bone, ridiculously sensitive to the slightest touch. Cool, yet hot, as the tentacles danced around, questing, touching, setting flame to his senses. Contrary to appearance, the tentacles were neither cold or slimy, being warm much like a human body, and slick with a substance not dissimilar to lube. This substance left streaking trails across his chest and belly.
" Not too long after I had lost connection the entire dimension  started to warp and collapse on itself.... I thought for sure I  was going to die." Tony paused," I've had a few  close calls before, this time however felt more final. You know  I've never been worried about what could happen  to me, but this time I had no idea what was happening to the rest of the team. I didn't know if you guys had been injured or if you were even still alive. I thought about it every day I  was  here."
" For a while, I had  started to  believe I'd never see you again."Tony murmured low, burying his face into Steve's chest.," I was starting  to think you had forgotten about me. Or had given me up for dead." Tony broke off, swallowing hard.
Fighting the sadness was a constant battle, and one which he  never truly got the upper hand in. But he was a soldier through and through. There was too much at stake to give in.
"We also ask, being that it is one of our pleasure packages that you do nothing to unduly agitate or injure our rental. This is for your own safety as well as the maintaining the integrity of our products."
Steve sank slowly  back down into a  halfway sitting position at the edge off the mattress. The disarray state of the covers, sign of the silent battles he had been fighting in his sleep. Battles he had lost, and which had cost him everything. Shakily he sucked in a deep breath.
Tony threw his head back  as he screamed release, abused cock splattering his cum on floor below. The experience had been rougher, faster paced, then when he and Steve had sex, and the experience had left him  trembling, and gasping softly. The tentacles too seemed to have had their share, slowly loosening their hold until they had retracted back into the crate once more. Steve had rushed forward to support Tony before he collapsed on the floor.
Steve sighed slightly, at the perceptible shift in tone. He had been so happy to have Tony back, that for just a few moments he was able to completely forget  about their current unfortunate circumstance. "You want the long version or short version?" Steve asked dryly.
"No.  thank you. Hope the two of you enjoy your day" The woman beamed at him before shaking his hand to complete the deal. Steve put on his best fake press smile, still not quite believing that  the last hour really did happen.
Steve waited at the counter for a few minutes without anyone showing up, before ambling over to the coffee table, and picking up  one of the pamphlets. On the front  cover was, surprise... more tentacles. Flipping it over he saw that  the back cover had listed several different modes of contact, including the website he found. Opening to the first page he was surprised to find  the typical company history blurb (which he began reading out of a morbid sense of curiosity) . In all aspects, the company seemed determined  to present itself as a legitimate, albeit nontraditional,  business. He had only read partway through  the first paragraph of the company's history before a sudden commotion caused him to whip around.
Steve turned to leave, making it only halfway to the door before the woman called out to him once more," By the way, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?"
"Now I just need you to sign  a few things  for me." The woman continued, talking in a much more sedate tone now that the sale was done. From a compartment in her desk, she procured a  couple sheets of paper which she layed out before Steve. She continued talking in the same tone as Steve hunched  over the papers., " Just so you know, all our tentacle monsters are locally sourced from the dark dimension, and are run through sanitation procedure before being tested-
"It doesn't look like we'll be  going anywhere for awhile, we have plenty of  time." Steve insisted stubbornly, folding his arms in a stance that if suggested he'd make time if he had to. Tony glanced at him sidelong, smiling one of his first  real smiles since he got here.
"It's nothing." Tony answered without answering, hurriedly waving away Steve's words. "You know, same old same old."
"I'm.. sorry Tony." he  apologized, grabbing a clean cloth, before making his way to Tony's side, " Let me get that."
After some hurried shuffling of papers, the woman turned to gaze up at him wuth nearly folded hands, "Okay now first things first, may I ask what made you choose our services?"
"What about you? What happened after we lost contact with you? We tried to find you, but Dr.Foster said it'd be like finding a needle in a haystack. "
Steve hesitated before signing as," Roger Star". Feeling only a mild twinge of guilt at the partial lie.
Tony sighed softly,  as some of the earlier tension left his body. A few minutes later, he finally succumbed to a combination of exhaustion and wrung out emotions. Within a matter of minutes he was snoring softly, wrapped in the warm and protective embrace of Steve's arms.  Tucking his chin on top of the other man's head, Steve tightened his grip.
"At Rent-tacle customer satisfaction is our highest priority.  Not all test subjects meet our standards."
At any rate, it had given Steve purpose. Useful, in serving as a distraction from his troubling thoughts,  while allowing him to pretend that he was still fighting for something.(what would he do if there was nothing left to fight for? ). Still,  it was never enough. There were times when he had been  lulled into the false comfort of sleep, only to wake up nearly paralyzed by the force of emotions running rampant through his mind.
After a long hot shower, Steve found himself staring blankly at the dinghy mirror which adorned his private  bathroom. It was not exactly a pleasant visage. His reflection stared  back at him with hollow eyes that spoke to several nights without adequate sleep and a certain aura of world weariness that he'd never noticed before.  He was coming undone at the seams, and  looked like he had seen hell and kept going  back for more. Unbidden, a small smirk flitted briefly across his face, as he tried to imagine  what Tony would say if he could see him now.
Now Steve wasn't one to judge, but it was transparently clear that fulfilling this particular fantasy was beyond his efforts alone. Cue the internet.  The  world's gateway to everything one could ever want, and about several dozen things which would have been better left never  seeing the light of day. He hardly even had  begun to look before he found  himself among a plethora of underground black market  services ranging from body dissolving chemicals to sex pollen("organic! Grown in small batches at our greenhouse",  Steve hesitated only a  beat before adding it to his bookmarks for later. Just in case). In the end it took only  half an hour and a few traced links, for  his efforts to yield a solution...Rent-tacle. A tentacle beast renting service.
When that was said and done, and Tony was clean, and  shaved, both men had inadvertently made their way to the sanctuary of the bed. It had been a long day to say the least, and while sleep sounded good, neither was quite ready to be lulled into the blissful nothingness just yet. There was something else which they had both been missing out those long months.
With or without  suckers? Energetic or slow moving? How many tentacles? Did he want an aquatic one? Ridges? Knots ?This one secreted a temporary paralyzing enzyme! This one was thermally heated! This one expanded in size! This one had tentacles of various sizes! Did he plan on renting it for just one day? Three days? A week?
"Iron Man in the flesh! " Steve exclaimed, closing   the distance between them on slightly unsteady legs. Ignoring Tony's muffled protest, he lifted the other man  off the ground in an enthusiastic embrace.  He may have even twirled him around a bit,  just like the titular  characters out of a romance novel.  The final  chapter, the two lovers reunited at long last.
"Damn Steve,  I've missed you. " Tony whispered fiercely, as at long last the  barriers of his emotional gate had been breached., "It's been...too long."
Tony almost lost it right there and then the second one of the tentacles had finally found his back entrance and slowly started pushing itself deeper. It was a tight fit,  wet, hot, and slick,  and just shy of being too much. This was nothing like sex with Steve. This was something new. Alien in the most extrodinary sense. . Pain and pleasure intermingled as it continued to relentlessly worm its  way through his most sensitive entrance. Combined with the ones still teasing his cock, he was powerless to do little more then gasp and sob around the one in his mouth.
"Sorry about your wait, how can I help you?" she greeted enthusiastically. The name tag on her shirt read "Janice". Steve regarded her blankly, taken aback for a few seconds. He didn't know what exactly he had  expected, but this certainlywas not it.
Though his thoughts drifted with dreamlike irregularity, the one one cold hard  truth was that acceptance equalled defeat.
"I see." Steve commented simply. He didn't. But by now he figured it was prolly for the  best to leave all his unanswered questions as is. The woman waited a few more seconds before continuing in a breezy tone.
As Steve went to  put away the razor,  Tony stared at his reflection for a few seconds, critically examining himself from several angles before running his fingers across his now smooth skin, "Not bad Cap." he admitted approvingly. A clean shave  may have been a small thing, but it did wonders to help feel in control again. More human.
Things were starting to feel like a home again. Steve felt the usual feeling of belonging, while mong the familiar white washed wallls and the  furniture that was a mix of modern and old fashioned. Exactly the way he had remembered it. Eventually Steve's wandering brought him to the  small bed stand situated at the headboard.  Clustered on top were numerous framed photos of varying sizes.  A small smile graced his lips as he picked up one of the larger ones. It showed  him and Tony posed on the tower's balcony as fireworks went off behind them. New Year's day. Where both had finally made a resolution worth keeping, a fresh start for a better future.
Fortunately, in an almost unheard chance of events,  fate was on his side, and he had managed to make it through without bumping into a single one of his teammates. The second part of the challenge was setting it up and coaxing Tony  to come to the lab while still keeping it a surprise. Stark Industries work had kept Tony busy as of late, leaving him  tired and irritable by the time he had arrived home.
"Hey, Cap." Tony had  spoken softly, lips twisting into a tired sort of half smile.  Tony was thinner , and hollow eyed from the trials he had been put through the last couple months, but otherwise appeared unharmed. A wordless  exchange of sorts passed between them, lingering looks that spoke of sentiments too strong to put into words.
The other man  shrugged, " I survived. Thinking of the team helped. I was determined that one way or another we'd be reunited. Though as time passed I found it harder and harder to have hope", he admitted, '' Sometimes I still have a hard time  believing you are really here and this is not just a dream."
"It's fine." Tony recoiled, while trying to wave him away., "You don't need to babysit me Cap. I'm not helpless. I'm perfectly capable of doing this on my own." Steve hesitated with the washcloth still gripped firmly in his hand. His shoulders slumped as a huge sigh was forced out of him.
"I'll find you Tony. Just hang on a little longer." Steve promised softly, forcing a determined expression on his face.
Steve smirked and kicked the opening latch without a word. Tony's eyes went comically large as a heaving mass. of grey-green tentacles surged toward him like some kind of twisted jack in the box. Without his suit, Tony was physically outmatched and  didn't even have time to set up a minimal struggle. Within a matter of minutes the tentacles had efficiently coiled  themselves around his torso, and the joint of his forearm and calves. He tried to struggle , but the tentacles only tightened their grip, stringing him up  till he was completely immobilized.  A couple  of the other tentacles were reaching up to join in,  trailing over  his body lazily, almost seeming to sniff around  as they investigated their prey.
"St-teve please ..."  Tony murmured low in his throat, by now scarcely coherent. A plea? A praise? His thoughts were floating discordantly, muddled by  the delicious high he was currently riding.
Everyday ran like  clockwork. His thoughts taking him through the same well worn path over and over again, without any signs of stopping. Denying that Tony was dead, anger at his inability to do anything, bargaining with fate which wouldn't give, and the depression that had trailed him like a cloud. He has already gone through the cycle a dozen times, he was prepared to go a dozen more. In his heart, he knew the only way he could end the cycle was through acceptance.   The bigger part of him  however refused to accept it, irrational perhaps, but  to accept was to  admit defeat.
Steve made his way to the wooden door and hesitated, hand lightly gripping he doorknob. He listened for a couple seconds, straining to hear a sound. Nothing. Now he was really starting to get worried. He  rapped lightly on the wood with his knuckles. Still nothing. He tried again, this time louder, " Tony?" he called out trying to keep the desperation out of voice. No response.
"I was just a little bit preoccupied." Tony answered icily. For a few seconds both men stared at each other intensely..but neither one's heart was really in it. Steve ran a hand wearily down his face.
Steve wandered aimlessly around the room while Tony showered. It was the first time Steve had been in their shared room since Tony had been trapped in that no tech dimension. The thought of sleeping alone in an empty room which had once held so many happy memories, had always seemed wrong to him. Too painful. With the reminder of Tony's absence shoved in his face from every direction.
Steve's lips twitched into a faint smile,"The whole team really missed you Tony. We were never  really a team without you."
Tony  was always on Steve's mind though.  If not at the forefront,  then lingering in the background like a ghost. Haunting him. There was happiness mixed in sure, memories of fast action and many, many nights spent making sweet love to one another, without a care in the world. If  anything it only made the absence more sharp and painful. Tony's absence felt like a hole in his soul, always there, steadily growing larger and more painful every day.
"Of course not," Tony retorted, before cautiously approaching the crate. Steve followed behind, careful to stay off to the side as he watched Tony investigate it from all different angles. "It seems to be  sealed pretty tight..how do I open it?" Tony turned to Steve once more, curiosity by now, fully aroused.
He gagged once again, as he was forced to spit another eager tentacle from  his mouth. They were getting bolder, more desperate. A parallel to his own need.
After some careful consideration, and more than a bit of guesswork, Steve eventually settled on a standard mid energy, terrestrial, tentacle monster with extra arms of varying size. Apparently a best seller if the sales woman was to be believed.
It was moments such as waking up alone  in an empty bed that hit hardest. For Steve their relationship \ had always been the small things, falling asleep in one another's arms, listening to the sound Tony's breathing after Steve had won in persuading him into a rare early night's sleep, and  waking up together so that the first thing he saw was Tony's face.  Steve would have given anything for just one more day.
Even when they had been whisked away to Dimension Z. Even when the rest of his team had started to lose hope or give up, he stubbornly held on to the belief that they would find Tony. Even when the chances of a happy ending drifted further and further out of reach, Steve still refused to give up hope.
Steve wasn't called a master tactician for nothing though, and could be quite persuasive when the situation demanded.
Steve tensed at the mention of maniacal being they had encountered within minutes of arriving. The mastermind behind all this. The one who put Tony through all this.
When one of the tentacles lightly brushed his balls, he moaned long and deep around the one in his mouth, far past the point of caring anymore.  This had been one of his most deeply buried fantasies for a long time, and he damned well was going to enjoy it. It may have been wrong, but it felt so right.
"Of course, right this way." she exclaimed, setting off at a fast clip toward the guest counter. Stebe followed behind more sedately, keeping his eye on the Hydra goons the entire time.  When they arrived at the desk, Steve shot one more glance at the place where he had last seen the Hydra agents, but they had already vanished. Glumly, he supposed they'd see what had been bought soon enough.
‘I’ve also changed plenty.’ Daisuke reminisces as he twirls a strand of red hair between his fingers, ‘Oh well we’ll see what happens when I get there.’
The blonde guy looked around and the entire group just pointed towards the table, the blonde nervously laughing as he looked at Tony, who just nodded in acceptance watching the group shuffle around.
“Actually scratch that, it seems something got Thor into a mood.” Natasha remarked as she stared at dark thunder clouds gathering outside.
“Mostly because its another world in a far off place, so they’d have a different time compared to us.” Robin says.
So it's been a little bit and I bring to you another chapter I've been working on, and this time it's on one of my favorite games of all time, The Tales series, to be more specific, Tales of Vesperia. So I bring to you an OOC Yuri Lowell and Flynn Scifo where I made Flynn more breakable and Yuri more caring. I'm still working on my two prompts that have been given to me, taking a bit to make sure they're going in the direction I want, but I'll have a few more chapters to post in the meantime, one's I've been working on for some of my favorite ships.
“Sure, I guess.” Robin shrugs as he follows Chrom and Lissa to their tent, he glances around and spots all the glances aimed his way from his fellow Shepherds. Robin goes forward to sit on the chair as Chrom and Lissa sit on the bed.
“Does anyone else feel incredibly envious of Thor?” Steve questioned, jealousy in his tone as he stood to the side with the others.
Yuri glances at them, before seeing the crowd of people around them, mentions them forward as they walk through the crowd and says, “Well her name is actually Olivia Montague.”
“T-t-thanks guys.” Tony tries to smile bashfully, but it comes across as a grimace with chattering teeth.
Each person has a pokemon that resonates with their soul. Steve and Braviary, Bucky and Liepard, Natasha and Weavile, Clint and Talonflame, Bruce and Vileplume, Thor and Raichu, Sam and Staraptor, and Wanda and Alakazam. Tony has a Beautifly which constantly gets him underestimated not knowing that Beautifly was the strongest out of all of them.
“Just as beautiful as before.” Yufine says, giddy smile in place, “Look how the lightning arches on his fingers Elena. He looks so dangerous and pretty.”
Tony glanced to look at Burce, from where he was looking at Sam and Scott, where Bruce beckoned him closer but Tony just shook his head. Bruce shrugged and turned to look at the super soldiers who were shoveling snow down each other’s shirts.
“Jesus christ Clint, no need to have a food orgasm over my awesome cooking skills.” Tony arrogantly says, hiding his small smile.
“Yes he does.” Elena said, finally addressing the group for the first time, “He sleeps a lot better with people than he does by himself, when he came to us he slept with basically everyone, which we imposed after Robin had a nightmare that woke up the whole castle.”
“This feels absolutely amazing love.” Steve whispered as he was overtaken in the pleasure of the massage as Tony continued to work on his back.
“What, can’t I drag the guy I like to my room to sleep with him? I also mean sleep as in actual sleep.” Daisuke said, clarifying the last sentence.
“Of course it’ll be good, it’s homemade Italian food.” Tony scoffed in response, putting the chicken to a boil in the pot, while preparing the vegetables for the Frittata and the Ciambotta. Off to the side he prepared the mixture for the Tiramisu and the spaghetti for the Frittata and the Spaghetti alla Carbonara.
“If you allow me to, yes.” Yuri says, grinning as Flynn leans back and looks up at Yuri expectantly. Yuri leans forward, and savors Flynn’s soft lips and the taste of caramel coffee on his tongue.
“Well we should get going, I wanna start on this quest and I gotta level up a bit.” Pon and Zednos were the first to leave, waving goodbye to the others.
Lady Hera friends- More like unknowns, people that Tony wants nothing to do with. Current: Everyone else
“Yes, I want some Tony cuddles also.” Clint pouted as he stared longingly at them as Tony and Thor got comfortable and put on a movie.
“This’ll feel even better.” Natasha smirked before she started to massage Tony on his left shoulder and arm while Wanda went over to his right and did the same treatment as Natasha.
“Yea don’t worry about it, I’ve done this before with him.” Tony got out some milk before he added a generous amount to the pot, enough for everyone to have some hot cocoa before he let it simmer for a bit to heat up.
“Yea it’s Meg and her girlfriend, Jewel, they both were really nice and concerned about me, and Meg gave me her number to talk to her so I immediately bumped her up.” Tony offered another shy smile, devouring two pastries in one hand.
It was slowly approaching Christmas time in the Avengers Tower. The entire tower was decked out in festive lights and streamers throughout the entire common floor. There was a large 12’ christmas tree off in the corner, decked out in globes and lights. There were several plates of cookies on the countertop with 12 glasses of milk, in various stages of being drunk. Next to the cookies were plates of Fruitcake, cupcakes, cake, and other sweets.
Steve groaned as he stepped out of the elevator into Tony’s penthouse, arm massaging his neck. He was on a mission all day and right after was debriefing and Steve didn’t even have a chance to relax. His back was killing him, his arms and legs are sore, and he has a killing migraine. He just wanted to rest the rest of the day with his boyfriend in bed, doing absolutely nothing. He stepped into the living room and saw Tony bent over a tablet, typing something with startling speed. Steve snuck up behind Tony and snaked his arms around his waist pulling him close.
“Enjoy.” With an exaggerated hand movement Tony sat down and filled his plate, the rest of the superheroes doing the same.
Obviously everything's OOC like all my characters usually are, I love to portray them in an image I feel like they could achieve if they took different choices. I'm still working on everything slowly cause the way I write it takes me a good 3 weeks to finish a single oneshot for the sole fact that writing so much gets boring after a while. My mind also swirls with plenty of ideas on everything, plus I get like 3-4 new story ideas a day. So just be patient with me, please?
So I read this manhwa a few days ago and I decided to do a slight crack pairing of Grid x Regis, alsoo this is most definitely OOC Grid cause he's actually a money hungry person and would do anything for money but I decided to write him a little less money hungry. Also the relationship happened pretty fast but since there isn't gonna be a sequel I decided to make them boyfriends real quick, regardless of how long they're known each other. I got a few more prompts happening in the next few days, one Avengers, a few Digimon, and some Oregairu HayaHachi pairing.
“Why thank you Captain Muscles, I’ll be out with your food in 30 min.” Tony winked through his blush, leaving Steve a stuttering mess.
“Everything is going good sir, all systems to optimal performance. JOCASTA is also ready to make more food at any time. I would say that we are available to open.”
A thrill broke through the calm silence of the group, who were currently watching a random comedy that JARVIS set up, and made everyone turn at once to see Tony glancing up at Beautifly with a frown.
“Damn alright.” Tony muttered as he grabbed the same copy of papers he gave Wanda, and handed them over to each of the heroes, “Same thing as Wanda, sign at the bottom of each page.”
Robin wrapped his arms around Chrom’s shoulders, pulling him in even tighter as he deepened the kiss. Robin loved the feeling of Chrom’s lips, has been dreaming of them for ages, and he can taste the fruit that Chrom snacks on throughout the day, along with a cup of tea.
Robin softens a bit more at that, “And I you my dear singer and the dragoness of course.” He adds as he sees Yufine’s pout.
Alright so like the training fro Tony's Beautifly is completely unrealistic since a bug cannot do that but I thought Wynaut? Also I picked a Beautifly for Tony because while he may be abrasive, arrogant, and arrogant at times he has a soft and beautiful inside. Beautifly is there to represent Tony's "pretty" side that he usually only lets out amongst actual friends.
“Well my star, it was fun while it lasted, but sadly we must leave before the Chaos Rift closes.” Elena says sadly, smiling at Robin.
“Y-Yuri mind introducing us?” Estelle asked, finally getting her voice back, as she glanced at the others in the group.
Tony casually strutted into the empty kitchen, looking for a snack. The Avengers just finished a fight against some Doom bots, which was pathetically easy. They all decided to skip debriefing today and come back to the tower and relax for the rest of the day. Tony decided to fly ahead since he had to fix the armor.
Robin stops dead, staring at Chrom like he’s an interesting specimen, “Y-you love me?” He says, a small blush rising to his cheeks as he processes the statement.
Aether nodded gratefully to Venti and took a deep breath, “Yes normally I would but as I said I have something else to do today.” Aether then glanced over at Xiao, “I know the Lanturn rite isn’t on anymore but is there anywhere I can find a Lanturn?”
“Yea,” Grid waved his hand, “All you have to do is find a production recipe for a set of armor and weapons for your class, along with the materials x3, and then I’ll make you the full set of armor and weapons. And since it's x3 the materials then you’ll get the armor and weapon that has the best stats.”
