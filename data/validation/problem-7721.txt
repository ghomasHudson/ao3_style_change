― finger, quickly getting up and pulling Tony into a deep kiss.
Bucky shook his head, laughing. “Yes, punk, no limo. And don’t shower this guy with gifts either. You remember what happened the last time, right? With…”
Mario’s. They had their first date there. It’s sweet.
“Seven it is”.
“I’d rather not talk about the skull in my workshop while I eat, thanks”, Tony replied, opening a container of food and moaning as the smell hit his nose.
“Well, it’s settled then. Let me call my PA and she will be here in a second. Then, we can discuss dates! Excuse me”.
“NO, we’re just friends”, Steve tried to explain, but Tony’d had enough.
Stane merely glanced at the pictures and sighed, making a quick gesture for the reporters to stay away.
Steve smiled as he put the ring on his boyfriend’s ― no,
Hope you guys enjoyed it. We're almost done. Two more chapters to go, I think. Again, sorry for the delay in posting this and leave me comments and kudos cause I love those! lol
Tony throws a party, is tricked by a beautiful spy and decides to trust someone unexpected, if only just a bit.
“I promise you it’s not going to be like that. I…”, he sighed and lowered his voice a bit, “I need someone I can trust, Pep. I’ve never been all that involved with the company and I’m about to make some huge changes to it. It’s going to be a PR nightmare and I’m pretty sure we’re going to lose a lot of investors, not to mention the board…”
Director Carter was already waiting for them when they arrived at the small, inconspicuous office building, and she didn’t look happy at all. Steve knew there was no possible way for her to know what he and Tony had been doing just hours before, but seeing her like that, with her icy stare and displeased expression, made him tremble on his feet. They all sat down in front of her and waited as she connected with Natasha.
Steve looked like he was about to disagree for a second, so Tony quickly reassured him:
That took Bucky by surprise. “No. No, you didn’t”.
The Avengers arrive at the island.
“You what?” Bucky asked with tears in his eyes ― and most likely a couple of broken ribs.
“Thanks, you guys. For everything”.
Bucky and Steve looked at each other, grimacing and then back at Tony, forcing a smile.
Without thinking, Tony stepped out of his hiding spot and shouted ‘Hey!’, getting the attention of the man, who quickly turned around and pointed his gun at Tony.
Buck snorted. “Why the fuck would I bring you a fake skull?”
They looked at each other for a second before bursting into giggles.
“If you were in my shoes, would you have waited?”
“Nah, don’t worry about that. It’s not like you lied to me all this time, you just figured out that maybe you and Bucky are not ready to marry, that’s totally understandable”.
“I gotta say, it’s nice to finally meet the guy who had my friend by the balls after just one date”, Bucky said, throwing his arm on Natasha’s shoulder. He looked relaxed, too relaxed.
Steve had never been to Tony’s workshop before. The engineer had always been very overprotective of his space and Steve accepted that without a second thought. He walked down the stairs and came across a big glass wall that simply opened for him as soon as he stepped in front of it. Gun at the ready, he walked inside and just… let his arms fall in surprise.
“We’re not going to let anything happen to you, Tony”, Steve whispered, kissing the brunette on the head, “I promise”.
Jarvis cleared his throat and took Tony’s plate. “Well, some people are worth committing a crime for, master Anthony”, he said, earning himself a kiss on the cheek from his wife.
"You'll be hearing from Hill soon", she added just for good measure as the doors closed.
Natasha just stared at them, arms crossed in front of her chest. “So tell him it was a joke and that you two turn into the stupidest people in the entire universe when you drink”.
He’s going to do it tonight.
Natasha turned the card in her hand, “You really think so?”
He smiled. They had exchanged phone numbers that night after the hospital and ever since then they’d talked pretty much every day. From their childhoods to their favorite TV shows, they discussed everything and anything, as if they’d been friends their entire lives.
“Honey, I’m home”, he called out in a playful tone.
“My father made guns. He taught me how to shoot”.
, Tony thought. But that was the thing, wasn’t it. Steve hadn’t introduced him as his boyfriend or his partner, he had introduced him as a friend. Not only that, but he was desperate to see Tony gone as soon as possible.
And as his heart was ripped apart, as his sobs made it difficult to breath, as he fought to keep his eyes opened, unblinking, because he could not
Steve nodded and got up, going straight for his room. He took his clothes off and lay down on his bed, checking his phone. No messages from Tony.
“Tony knows and brought a minister”.
Steve froze. He opened and closed his mouth, trying to find the words, but having no success. He glared at Bucky, who whispered a very remorseful
. He put his head back, completely hidden behind the cabinet, and closed his eyes, trying to visualize the whole building in his mind. The elevator was too far away and he would probably run into ‘crazy man with a gun’ if he tried to get there. The stairs were a closer and safer option. He could run down a few floors and then take the elevator all the way down. He could do this. He just needed to run down the hallway, pass his godfather’s dead body, turn right, run a bit more and he’d get to the stairs.
Natasha simply rolled her eyes and took Clint by the collar of his suit, “We’ll go check the Rooms. You two check the Labs and we’ll meet back here. Got it?”
Tony smiled. “Well, soldier, it’s been so long I don’t even remember anymore. I’ll get back to you on that after you fuck me against the wall in the shower, how about that?” He asked, walking towards the bathroom, dropping his pants on the way.
“Explain? You asked an FBI agent to do a background check on me. I’m pretty sure that’s a crime”.
“No. There’d never been a sighting of them near Kunar until yesterday. That’s what’s bothering me. They knew we were coming and they knew who was with us. But the thing is, no one knew T… the target“, Rhodes quickly corrected himself, “was coming that day”.
Bucky shook his head, “That’s not true and you know it”.
Soon enough, Steve was spending more time at Tony’s than at his own apartment. It had become such a common occurrence that every day he would tell Happy to pack him a small bag with necessities like clothes, shoes and a toothbrush. He’d leave the office early whenever he could and go straight to Tony’s, where they’d shower together until all the hot water was gone and then eat dinner, talking about their day and their past and whatever they felt like it. Sometimes, they’d cook. Steve was a great cook, thanks to his ma who’d taught him everything he knew. Tony wasn’t all that great, but he was eager to learn. While cooking, they’d drink a glass of wine and feed each other pieces of whatever they were making. They’d laugh, kiss, and occasionally make out and forget something in the stove, almost causing a fire. It was fun, it was easy, and Steve loved every second of it, which was precisely why he was so damn worried about Tony meeting his friends.
“Steve, I was kidnapped by a terrorist organization, waterboarded, tortured, starved… And I lived. I shouldn’t be alive unless it was for a reason. I didn’t always know what to do, you know. All I ever knew is that I’m good at creating things, making things, and I thought I could use that to make a better world. And even when my dad made me design weapons, I thought I was doing some good, you know? Saving some people, protecting people like Rhodey”.
“What happened? Natasha, what’s wrong with Steve?”
The brunette laughed. “What? You can touch my face all day?”
, he read. God, what would his mom say if he got arrested? Worse, what would happen to his mother if he couldn’t work to at least try to pay for her treatment? Without much choice, Steve decided the best course of action was to get the hell out of there was quickly as possible.
“That’s not even the worst part. It also says she had a baby when she was fifteen. Artificial insemination. She carried the baby to term. Kid has yet to show any signs of having powers, though”.
“Can I just say what everybody is thinking?” Clint shouted through the loud noise made by the helicopter. Natasha, who was piloting it, pursed her lips, knowing that whatever her partner was about to say, it would not be good.
“Those two can never get a break, can they?” Wanda asked out loud, looking very upset.
“Yeah, sounds like Thor”, Clint replied, snickering.
She narrowed her eyes, closely watching Barnes before turning her attention to Steve. She circled her desk and walked slowly towards him, putting both her hands firmly on either side of the chair armrests. Steve’s eyes widened and he discreetly pulled back a little more, trying to put some space between the Director’s irate face and his own.
They took the elevator up, both completely silent, not really knowing what to say to each other. When they arrived on the communal floor, Nat went straight to the couch, sitting beside Bucky, and Tony went to the kitchen. He was getting close to the door and could hear the voices inside.
“Yeah, I’m gonna submit a written complaint about that later”, he replied with a nervous laugh.
“He was the most amazing person I’ve ever met”.
YOU DID WHAT
“Captain Rogers is going to be just fine”.
“STEVE!”
move – and finally landed them on Obadiah’s smiling face.
“Or texted”.
“But we’re not, are we?”, asked Steve, his eyes full of regret when he finally lifted them from the paper in his hands and looked at Tony, “Are we ever going to be okay?”
The Director slammed her fist on the table with a curse. “I knew it. I knew that big old bald walrus was no good, I told Howard a thousand times he wasn’t trustworthy”.
“Tony… Tony, I know a lot just happened all of a sudden”, Steve said, kneeling down in front of his boyfriend, “But this is good. Tony, we can fight him. We can get you your life back. What do you say, love?”
“Where are the bodies, though?” Steve asked, slightly lowering his shield, “There’s enough blood here to fill a big water tank, but no corpses. It doesn’t make sense”.
“You know, Stevie, I always knew you were a huge prick, but you didn’t have to take it out on Tony”.
“Yeah, yeah, of course, it’s amazing”.
Right under the saying was a drawing of a football field with many players. On the side, there was a small brunette cheering and, beside him, a robot (who looked very much like DUM-E) holding a sign that said “Go Team”. Tony smiled.
She called Jarvis as soon as Tony hung up, desperately trying to reach the butler who did not pick up the phone. She would later find out that Jarvis was busy receiving the most disturbing news in the hospital, being held by his crying wife as the doctor explained his chances of survival. In that moment, however, she couldn’t help but curse the butler as she sat on the plane, worried sick about her darling boy who had sounded so terrified over the phone. She arrived at Malibu a few hours later, taking a cab to the mansion. Margaret wasn’t stupid. Howard and she had been friends for many years, a friendship that had started based on their mutual desire to prove their worth in a world that constantly told them they were not enough. She knew the man’s qualities and she knew his flaws. On her last visits, she had noticed how there was always a glass of scotch attached to Howard’s hand, how fast he lost his inhibition, slurring his words as he talked about lost hope and business difficulties. But, most of all, she had noticed how his eyes always seemed to narrow every time he turned his attention to Anthony.
Steve stood there, unsure on what to do. He was shivering, his teeth clattering from the cold. He hated the cold. It reminded him too much of a time when he and his ma would sit in a freezing living room, trying ― and failing ― to keep each other warm under old, torn blankets the church had given them. He didn’t have much time to dwell on memories, though, because soon enough the mechanic came back, a change of clothes in his hands.
Sam and Clint nodded.
There was a faint light coming from a small TV, but no sound. The room was poorly lit, but enough so that she could see the many newspapers stuck to the walls.
“Damn, man. It was literally killing me inside to stay here and wait around. But, you know, I figured you had everything under control and it’s best if he doesn’t know there’s a third spy, right?”
“I’m going after Tony. Buck, you and Sam stay here and keep an eye on this asshole. Coulson, the agents and I are going to the Tower”.
Again, Tony didn’t answer. He couldn’t. The truth was too embarrassing. He pointed to his jaw and then to Bruce, who was watching the exchange between him and the ex-assassin while holding a huge plate of pancakes.
he lost his eye in a knife fight with a suspect back on his military days”.
Steve discretely glanced at his friends, who were too busy playing Mario Kart to notice anything else happening, and sighed, turning back at the phone.
“Well, this was… Not fun at all and I need a drink. Or four”, Bucky said, taking of his tie and grabbing his girlfriend’s hand, “Anyone up for some champagne? I feel like celebrating the fact that I didn’t in fact marry down”.
He wanted to say something. Maybe ask Steve out on a date, like dinner at Pop’s, their favorite Italian restaurant, and then a walk around town while they had some ice cream. He was pretty sure he’d be able to romance the pants out of Steve, both literally and figuratively. There was only one problem: Steve had a boyfriend. His name was Bucky and
“Well, when I was younger, I was small and sickly and no one wanted anything to do with me. I wasn’t exactly people’s first choice for romance, you know”.
and ignoring FRIDAY’s pleas for him to go meet his teammates in the communal floor.
Bucky snorted and then yelped in pain when the red head gave him a sharp jab right on his side.
“Own, you think I’m hot?” Cassie asked, mockingly batting her eyes at Harvey, who blushed like crazy and was ready to retort before being interrupted by Peter.
“I said what I said, Barton”.
The next morning, Steve came over. Tony met him outside of his building while he was getting out with Rhodey. He told his best friend to go along without him, that he and Steve needed to talk. Rhodey wasn’t happy about it, but left anyway, although not without giving Steve the nastiest look first.
“No, no. It’s not the five failed exams I’m interested in. It’s the five tries. Tell me, Mr. Rogers. Do you want to punish some bad people?”
He forcefully let go of his face, throwing it slightly to the side, before taking something out of a small suitcase on the table.
“You’re not a very good spy, are you?”
“Yeah, okay. Clint comes back next week so we’ll do it then”.
Tony shook his head and motioned with his hand, as if telling Natasha to go ahead and do it already.
“Don’t worry, Myshka. He flirted with me, so he must want something. We’ll try and see where it goes, okay?”
“I’m Tony”, the brunette introduced himself.
“Good. Romanoff is an excellent spy and I have a job that she would perfect for. You three, however, will have a different mission. I believe that whoever made an attempt on my godson’s life will most likely try again. He must be watched carefully. However, knowing Anthony as I do, he will outright refuse a bodyguard”, she explained, and then smiled at the Captain, “Tell me, Rogers, have you ever gone to college?”
“Maybe she was drunk”.
“Over here”, Tony called them, touching the wall in front of him with interest before taking a step back. He raised his hand, emitting a red light that slowly covered the wall before disappearing again.
“Focus”, Natasha said in a loud tone, making Clint cross his arms in annoyance, “You can all gawk at the pretty toy later”.
“Do you?”
Tony knew he had to be strong, but it was hard. Stane knew him too well. He knew exactly what to say, what buttons to push to turn Tony into a scared little child filled with insecurities. He could feel his hands slightly shaking as he tightened his grip to the doorknob, his lips trembling as he thought of something to say… and then, he saw it. From the corner of his eye, he saw a figure. Steve. He was standing nearby, close enough to put himself between Stane and Tony if needed be.
“No, just… This song reminds me of something I’m trying very hard not to think about right now”.
“Okay?!”
“But you told them you dislocated your jaw while sucking my cock?”
“He is DEAD, it’s what he is! LOOK AT ME”, Harley complained, touching his gigantic dragon face with a painful moan.
“Do you think the problem is his hands are too big?”
“Look, Buck and I, were friends. We’ve been friends ever since we were kids and sometimes we get drunk and we do stupid stuff and we got drunk and thought it would be funny to send you an invitation to our fake wedding so maybe you would send us like a gift or something and then you called and you wanted to pay for the whole thing and I kinda wanted to spend time with you so we didn’t tell you anything and then it just got bigger and bigger until we couldn’t tell you because you were spending a shitload of money on this and we felt so bad but I can’t marry Bucky because I’m pretty sure Natasha would cut my balls off and I kinda really like you and I wanted to ask you out and I wouldn’t be able to if I married Bucky and I’m just SO SORRY”.
“What happens if they don’t have a copy?”
“Do you remember what I told you about the X-Men? Mutants have this extra gene on the 23
“We’re more of the take names, kick ass variety, if you know what I mean”, Bucky replied, taking a sip from his water bottle.
“Yeah. Yeah. I just don’t think we could make each other happy”, he insisted.
“Did you see that? I BREATH FIRE, you guys!”
“They throwing a benefit with my name on it and no one had the fucking decency to send me an invitation. The reporter was saying the reason I wasn’t expected to show up is because I have PTSD, Steve”.
“Good. You’re all dismissed”.
and followed his best friend to the table.
, he thought groaning loudly and hiding his head under the pillow once more.
Steve walked over to Tony and stopped close to him, slightly bending over to get his head closer to his stomach.
The brunette nodded with a small smile and eyes full of tears before burying his head on Rhode’s neck with a soft cry.
“Greg?” Tony asked, confused.
“So you’re saying I have to marry you to save my life? That’s… original.”
Eventually, the waitress came to bring their water and take their orders. Tony chose the salmon while Steve ordered the steak. When she left, they returned to their conversation.
“I came to talk to you, of course, to discuss business”.
“We’ll take care of everything. Just show up, would you? It’ll be good, man, a good distraction from all this crap”.
“Yes, Clint, we heard, we’re right here”, Natasha replied, rolling her eyes. She turned to Steve, “How are you going to do it?”
“Yes! Hogarth and Associates!”
“Tony? Tony, my darling, what’s the matter?”
As he walked, he replayed the whole scene in his head. He couldn’t understand it. He’d been so sure Connie was going to say yes; so sure. He could feel the tears filling his eyes again, but he took a deep breath and refused to let them fall. He was heartbroken, yes, and confused and angry at himself and miserable, but he was definitely NOT going to start crying in the middle of a Walmart. No way.
“JARVIS will use his access to the tower to lead them away. You know, turning lights on and off, making the elevator go crazy, messing with the computers, the whole ‘Paranormal Activity’ shebang”, Tony explained, “And with them away, Natasha can get into Stane’s office”, he pointed at said room in the hologram, “and get the documents we need”.
He snorted and shook his head, “No. No, I wouldn’t have”.
Tony didn’t answer, merely turning his head towards the window once more, watching the clouds go by. Steve got up then and sat beside Tony, pulling his whole body towards himself and resting his head on the engineer’s. He felt the younger man tense under his touch for a moment and then suddenly relaxing, as if finally giving up. They exchanged no more words about the matter, but stayed like that for the rest of the trip, simply holding hands and feeling each other’s warmth.
“Can’t we use the footage as proof?”
“I did”.
“You know, when I had your parents killed”, he said in a light, nonchalant tone, taking great pleasure in seeing Tony’s eyes widened at the confession, “I had a whole different plan for you. I was going to keep you around, be the nice father figure you so desperately needed… After all, you were right about one thing, Tony: you really were my golden goose”.
“Look, I know I screwed up…”, Bucky started to say, suddenly looking desperate.
, the scientist replied and then hesitated before continuing,
, he thought, wide eyes going from one side to the other,
“The point is I designed it and I have a very good memory. I’ll need some materials, but I can use JARVIS and my holographic technology to recreate a full 3D model of the tower, with every entrance, every exit, every room”.
"Why the hell would he call Stark?"
“Yeah, sure, an exploding goblin head is the same thing as opening up a dead frog. Okay”, Cassie complained, looking very green.
checking for the message that had just arrived.
“That is quite enough of screaming, thank you very much”, Margaret reprehended the women, who kept staring at her like she had just grown another head, “Take Howard to his bedroom and make sure to leave some aspirin by his bedside, I’m sure he’ll need it later”.
“He’s trying to take Tony out of the game. A death right now would be thoroughly investigated, so he’s trying to gain time, keep my godson out”, the Director explained. She stayed silent for a second before sighing, “We need to bring Tony in on this. He’s the only one who can hack Stane’s computer”.
I hope everyone is doing well! Please, leave kudos and comments if you like it!
“He… Tony, why the fuck didn’t you tell anyone?”
“Tony”.
“No, I was naïve before, when they said ‘hey, here’s the line and we don’t cross it, and that’s how we do business’. But if we’re double dealing under the table… Are we?”
“We’ll be fine here”.
(See the end of the chapter for
came soon after.
They looked at each other in awe, the information sinking in for the first time.
With that, he got up, putting the arc reactor inside the small suitcase and closing it. He took one last look at his godson and smiled before leaving the house, and Tony, behind.
“Are you okay?” Rhodes asked, sitting next to his friend with a worried expression.
I hope you like this chapter, let me know what you think!! More comments means I'm more determined to get on writing the next chapter sooner!!
All heads turned to Tony. He struggled a bit with his pocket before taking out a small flash drive.
Steve and Tony go out on a date.
“Sorry. But hey, all I’m saying is take it slow, ok?”
“First of all, we’re not accusing you, we’re informing you, you dumb dork; and second of all, we love you, man, but you are really dumb when it comes to relationships and stuff”.
The nurse smiled at him and nodded back. Steve sat down in one of the uncomfortable chairs and took his cellphone from his pocket. He smiled sadly at Bucky’s message.
Game Night happened once a month, on a Friday. Basically, Harley, Ned, MJ, Cassie and Peter would get together at the penthouse, order lots of junk food, buy a shit ton of candy and play board games until one of them passed out from all the sugar. Lately, though, they had found a new passion: Dungeons and Dragons. Shuri had introduced them to the world of D&D the last time she was in town, helping them create their characters and coming up with the most amazing and intricate adventures to send them to. They had loved it so much that even after the girl was long gone, back to Wakanda, they continued to play every month without fail, using Mr. Stark’s holographic technology for the maps while Shuri did her job as Dungeon Master through a video call.
The little man looked surprised at the phone on his hand, then at both his minions, before begrudgingly giving the device to the red headed woman.
So, that night, after waking up from yet another nightmare, he got up and dragged himself to the kitchen, careful not to wake up Rhodey, who was most likely sleeping peacefully in his own room. He opened the cabinets and the fridge, trying to find something, anything, sweet that could bring him some comfort, and then he saw it. He touched the small piece of paper taped over the box, smiling softly when he read the words.
“Oh my God, you
“Magical friendship bracelets?” Clint asked, putting his hand up and showing the Captain the weird looking watchband in his wrist, “Yep, got them”.
“They’re shit”.
“Calm down, my boy, it was just an idea. I have some new tech I need to show you”, he said, typing something on his phone, “The engineers should be here in a minute”.
“You don’t like it?” Steve asked, confused, “It’s just like the one you broke the last time we fought the Wrecking Crew. It took some time because they no longer make this kind of watch. I thought you might like it”.
. Steve could understand the need to blame himself, really, he could. He’d done it more times than he could count, really. But, somehow, Tony’s self-blaming was different, deeper, much more fueled with self-hatred and self-doubt. Throughout the entire meeting, as Director Carter talked about the small device Tony had created containing the program needed to access Stane’s computer without setting off any alarms, the engineer remained silent. His eyes were unfocused, cold. He kept staring at one particular spot of the table, not really seeing anything, seemingly lost in thought. Anyone else would think Tony was distracted, but Steve knew better. He could see the determination shinning in those brown eyes. He was formulating a plan and Steve was pretty damn sure he’d hate it.
Tony exited the car, looking around with a suspicious look. He hadn’t told Steve, hadn’t wanted to bother or worry him, but for some time now he’d had the feeling he was being watched. Whether it was at the car shop, at his apartment or when he was arriving at Steve’s building, it was look he could feel someone’s eyes trained on him. It was disconcerting to say the least, but every time he looked around and searched for the source he found no one. By now, Tony was convinced his mind was playing tricks on him. So, once again, he shook his head, trying to get his paranoia out of his mind, and walked inside the building.
“Let’s move to the next building. Whatever happened, we need to neutralize the target before anyone else gets hurt”.
“What the hell are you talking about? You’re a wizard! This is a simple amnesia case, it’s not like we’re asking you to kill freaking Voldemort here”.
(See the end of the chapter for
And that’s when a cell phone rang. The man on her right tapped his own pockets, looking for the device, and answering it when he finally found it.
“Well, she keeps looking at me, right?”
Steve still looked unsure, but in the end just took a deep breath, nodding to Tony. “Okay”, he got up, answering the cell phone while mouthing an angry
“I… You… What? When… I didn’t… What?”
“How do I do it? Like, do I just think about it?”
“Alright, then I have two questions: first, were you two making out? And second, who the fuck is that talking through the celling?”
Steve makes a decision and then shit happens.
“WHAT?”
Natasha doesn't like gossip, but hey, sometimes it can be useful! Also, Tony and Stane meet up. It's not good.
“The day I met you under the bleachers, with the flowers and the note. Why didn’t you tell me they weren’t meant for me?”
Tony nodded once more and pushed his face into Natasha’s hands.
Steve just stared at him disbelieving while Tony glared from behind him.
“Hey”, Tony replied in a whisper, gesturing for Steve to come with one hand while holding the tiny baby with the other, “I can’t believe you waited all this time”.
Steve forced a smile. “Yeah, I’m okay. Just nervous”, he replied without taking his eyes off the road.
“You’re right”, he finally spoke, looking at Tony once more, “you’re right, Tony. I didn’t trust you with this and I should have. I’m sorry. I’m sorry for lying to you. I’m sorry for hurting you”. He wanted to say more. God, how he wanted to tell Tony all those things he should have told him, but never did. What he meant to him, how much he cherished every moment with Tony.
“My God, look”, Dr. Connely said, pointing at one of the screens.
“Yes”, Tony replied in a dry tone.
“So, what you gonna do?” Clint asked, bits of jam spitting out of his mouth as Bucky yelled
“I’M A DRAGON! OH MY GOD, I’M AN UGLY DRAGON!”
“Great, you’re here, let’s start movie night, huh?” Clint asked, apprehensive.
Steve did not have to be told twice. He turned his head and captured Tony’s lips with his own, kissing him slowly as he pushed Tony back into the couch, taking extra care not to squish his belly. They kissed for a few moments before Tony huffed, annoyed.
“We… We can get married?” Steve asked in a soft whisper.
“Tony Stark! Yes, of course. Who doesn’t know Tony Stark?” Reed exclaimed, enthusiastically shaking his hand, “It’s a huge pleasure to meet you again. The last time we spoke, you were talking about creating an Artificial Intelligence. Any luck with that?”
, and left.
“I loved them”, Tony replied, locking his door, “Best chocolates I ever had, to be honest”.
He just stood there awkwardly as they laughed. It was embarrassing, sure, but hey… He’d done worse things before.
“Yeah, you definitely looked like you were struggling”, the man said, putting his bow back on his back, “What’s going on?”
he thought, leaving the room in a hurry.
“You and me both”, Steve replied, filling Morgan’s glass with water, “By the way, sweetheart, we need to buy more oranges, we’re all out”.
A soft melody started to play as soon as the doors closed. The Avengers stood there, awkwardly, as they descended. Finally, after almost a minute had passed, the doors opened again.
, again, Steve ignored Clint’s little quip.
By the end of it, Tony was standing in front of Steve, his face all red and his loud voice echoing through the room with an accusing finger on the other man’s face. Steve just stared at Tony, seemingly at a loss of words. He stared at his best friend ― the man he loved ― for a few seconds before dropping his gaze and leaning back on the chair, aggressively rubbing his face as he closed his eyes with a sight.
Tiberius looked at him and stayed silent for a whole minute before sighing and getting up from the bed. He walked slowly towards Tony and stopped right beside him, turning his head to look at him.
He was talking to Dr. Connely about the recent events when the alarm went off.
“Would you like to sleep over at my place? You know, since there’s probably going to be some very loud sex happening at your place tonight”.
“Tony? Are you okay? What are these?”
“Which I still want back, by the way, but continue”.
“This is a special robot…”, Stane started, but was interrupted by the other.
“They are late”, she complained, her English accent much more accentuated, as it usually happened when she was angry or nervous.
Widow and Hawkeye landed close by a few seconds later, the blue light of the repulsor in the parachute slowly dying out.
For the rest of the day, Steve thought of nothing else. He even made a list with all the pros and cons of each decision. If he said yes, he would become better in every way: no more asthma, no more colds, no more tiny, sickly Stevie who got his ass handed to him by a tall asshole in the movie theater. He would be able to fight his own fights. Hell, he would be able to protect people who couldn’t protect themselves! Plus, he’d have enough money to help his mother. Working ten years of his life for a somewhat shady sounding government agency seemed like a small price to pay.
Steve thought for a moment, before smiling, “I am counting the hours to see you. No, wait”, he said when Maria turned to leave, “that’s too much, I think. Maybe… ‘A thank you for being the one good thing in an otherwise shitty day’. How’s that?”
Tony, in his turn, knew his aunt well enough to know that she meant every word. He nodded, agreeing to her terms, and left the room without another word, being closely followed by Steve and Bucky.
“Ok, let me make this quick because it’s midnight and I’m actually planning on having sex tonight…”
“That’s a mouthful”.
. She took him to zoos, and picnics, and parks. She told him stories about secret spies who fought for a better world and fell in love with sassy waitresses. She spent hours on the phone, listening as the young boy recounted his day and shared with her everything that had happened. They were inseparable, even when separated by thousands of miles, and Margaret loved the boy more than she’d ever loved anything or anyone in her entire life, including her darling Angie, which was why, when that fateful call came, she dropped everything (including a very important meeting with the Minister of Defense) and went straight to Malibu, a whole new level of anger burning inside her chest all the way there.
“Punk. Just for that, I’m ordering extra fries today”.
“I… I know I hurt you. Bad. And I’m so sorry. I’ll never forgive myself for causing you so much pain, Tony, really. You were right. The problem was me. Deep down, I knew my ma wouldn’t care if I was gay. And I know Bucky and the others wouldn’t care either. I just… I don’t know, I had this idea in my head that it was different with me, you know. That it was okay for Clint to be gay, but if they found out I was? They would hate me. I don’t know why I thought that, but I did”.
. God, why did he have to tell his friends all those things about not ever being chosen? Now they knew how he felt AND they knew Steve had never really liked Tony, he was just being polite, like always. And
“Yeah, he hates lemon”, he replied, already taking another bite of said lemon cake, moaning as he chewed, “this is absolutely delicious”.
were a sick child”.
Tony had paid for Nat, Bucky, Sam, Clint and Steve to stay at the hotel that night, so they wouldn’t have to go back home only to return some hours later for the actual wedding. They were all in Steve’s room, drinking and chatting, when the blonde finally walked in, looking more terrified than he ever had before.
On Monday morning, he got dressed and turned on his cell phone. He sent Rhodey a text, asking for a ride. His best friend promptly answered
“What is happening here?” a voice suddenly came from Peter’s right side, causing him to yelp loudly and drop the pizza he was holding on the floor.
“I don’t know why everyone thinks I’m afraid of commitment. I proposed to Pepper when we were together, you know. I like the idea of getting married, of spending the rest of my life with someone I love who loves me back”, Tony said, taking a navy blue shirt from his wardrobe and putting it close to the door, “Just because I slept around when I was younger doesn’t mean I have an aversion to commitment”.
“None taken”, Steve replied with a smile, “If you don’t mind me asking…”
“IS THAT A REAL SKULL?”
“Rogers”.
“Friends is also a problem”, Clint started saying, but was immediately interrupted by Steve.
They walked up the stairs in uncharacteristic silence. Steve and Tony walked ahead while Natasha and Clint stayed a few feet behind them, bow and gun at the ready, in case someone decided to attack. After a long walk, they finally arrived at the building. Steve pressed the button near the gate, but nothing happened.

“You guys never looked at each other’s dicks? Really? Rhodey and I used to walk naked around each other all the time. By the way…” Tony said, making a wide space with both his hands, “… huge prick”.
He could hear Stevie’s voice saying them. He could see Tony’s smile hearing them. He could see them, together, happy.
“Yeah? What if he passed out because he started remembering and the spell turned his brain into mashed potatoes because of it? Did you think of that?”
“Yeah. Yeah, okay”, he replied, getting up and shutting the holograms down.
“You remember this one, right? It’s a shame the government didn’t approve of this; such a useful little thing”.
“What about the soldiers, sir?”
Steve smiled. “Until you”.
“We’re trying to cut the drinking for a while, Mr. Stark, so just water is fine if you don’t mind”.
So, the reason I didn't finish this sooner is because I watched Endgame Wednesday and I've been crying ever since, so I needed a few days to... Cry less, I guess, 'cause I'm still crying lol
“Well”, Steve replied, defensively, “that’s his name, isn’t it?”
He zoomed in on one of the corridors, showing two small figures. “Meet Jack Rollins and Brock Rumlow. Stane hired them a week ago and they’re not in SI’s payroll. And it gets worst…” Tony looked at Steve with an apprehensive look. “They work for HYDRA Corp”.
“He’s been getting these weird calls lately. Something about a deadline. He gets jumpy every time, scared even. I don’t know what it is, he wouldn’t tell me, but I know it’s bad. It’s gotta be bad to scare a guy like Obadiah”.
“Hey. James Barnes”, the man introduced himself, offering his right hand for a shake, and that’s when Steve noticed he was missing an arm. The blond took his hand, shaking it.
Something was wrong. Something was definitely wrong. Steve looked behind him, finding a warning on the wall.
“Good idea”, Tony agreed.
“I can’t do this. Okay, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, Tony, but we were lying”.
He sighed and got up, walking from one side to the other, glancing at Tony sometimes to make sure he was still unable to move.
“They need to have at least one copy, otherwise the will becomes null. As the deceased’s son, Tony has a right to view the will. Once we get our hands on a copy, we’ll file for suspicion of undue influence or forgery”, Matthew explained, “I believe we have enough to get a judge’s attention, at least. And, about your parent’s accident and the lawyer’s murder, I can try and request the reports on the investigation. I have a friend on the force, he owns me a favor”.
Steve wasted no more time and quickly threw Tony back on the bed, completely forgetting all about work and tardiness as he devoured the mechanic’s mouth.
“No, not now. But we need to start the fighting, otherwise Tony won’t believe it when I actually dump your ass”.
So Steve pulled the nearest chair closer and sat down, his hands still touching Tony’s stomach as he began to sing the very same song his mother used to sing to him when he was a baby. As he sang, his mind started to wonder… He pictured Tony and himself lying down in a big bed, a beautiful little girl asleep between them. He could picture her curly brown hair covering the white sheets and her chocolate brown eyes, so similar to Tony’s, slowly closing as they sang to her, together.
As always, leave kudos and comments, please!
“I missed you”, he whispered with his face buried on Steve’s chest as the soldier tried to exit the elevator while holding his boyfriend.
Natasha just stared at him for a long second before saying, “Yeah, that’s true”.
The young man stopped suddenly and turned towards Steve, staring at him with incredulity, “It’s two am and I’m sitting on the floor of a supermarket, wearing sweatpants and an old Batman t-shirt, and eating ice cream directly from the carton while using a stick of cookie dough as a spoon. What about this particular scene gave you the impression that the answer to that question could EVER be yes?”
Steve felt his heart skip a beat and he smiled at his husband just as Morgan turned around and looked at her father, excited, “Really? Were they nice?”
“Leave Steve out of this”, he demanded in a firm tone.
― WTF Barton, saw what
Bucky and Steve sat down while Tony ordered them all something to drink.
“You lied to me”, he shouted, turning and pushing Steve away, “you lied to me for three months! You know, when we started dating, all I could think about was how can someone like him choose someone like me? I’m nothing special, I’m barely a functioning human, so why would the captain of the football team, the school’s favorite, perfect student choose me? And now I know. You didn’t. You were stuck with me, just like everybody else. You didn’t want me, you just learned to tolerate me, just like everyone else in my life”.
“Jealous, Birdie?” Tony asked in a suggestive tone.
Steve discreetly looked around the table, trying to read his fellow agents. The red headed woman sitting next to him seemed unfazed by Fury’s introduction of the Director at first glance, but Steve could swear he’d noticed her eyebrows going slightly up for a moment before she schooled her features once more. The man on her side, however, had no such reservations. His eyes were wide, mouth hanging open, and he stayed like that for a few good seconds before the red head not so subtly kicked him in the chin, as if trying to remind the poor sap to be at least somewhat professional about the whole ordeal. Steve didn’t need to see Bucky’s face at all; his soft
“Hey, mozzarella sticks”, Tony exclaimed, taking one.
“If I may interrupt, sirs… The others have an interesting theory about that. They think perhaps the spell did more than just erase the Captain’s memories, but also blocked something in his mind, making him incapable of falling in love with you again, boss”.
“Hey. There was a slight issue with the program, but don’t worry, everything is fixed. My friend Rhodey is ordained and he’s gonna marry you guys. So, chop chop, it’s time, lovebirds”.
They followed the Lieutenant inside one of the barracks and into a small room. There was a table in the middle of it, with four plates of food lying around. Clint quickly sat down and took one, stuffing his mouth with whatever it was the plate contained, looking quite happy.
The couple turned around and stood there, face to face with not only Obadiah, but also Tiberius Stone. Tony knew that he should be scared right now. After all, he was looking in the eyes of the man who most likely had his parents killed, who had stolen everything from him without a second thought. But he wasn’t scared, not anymore.
"I know, Marcus, you said that...", the other replied, rolling his eyes, "You just need to watch them, man. It's not like you're gonna change their diapers or something".
“Why can’t you just have a huge fight tomorrow morning and be done with it?”
The restaurant, as it turned out, was on the sixty-fourth floor of one of the most beautiful buildings in New York. Tony had been there before, once with his parents and twice with one of his ex-boyfriends. He felt a pang of sorrow strike his chest like a knife. This, all of this, was a reminder of a life he had left behind, a life that had hurt him and left him broken on the ground. His thoughts were taking a dark turn and his face must’ve been showing it because Steve’s smiled disappeared the minute he turned to look at Tony.
“We’re the help, dear. The help knows everything”, Ana said, laughing softly.
(See the end of the chapter for
When Dr. Cho came out of the surgical room much later, they were all standing there, holding each other as they waited for news. And when she smiled, it was like the world had exploded in color once again. Tony felt light, free, like he’d been carrying the entire world on his back for a century and, suddenly, the weight had been lifted.
“Yeah, I guess”, Steve said, closing his eyes and touching his forehead, frowning as if he was in pain.
Steve groaned, taking a long sip of his beer, “Here we go again”.
“Excuse me? Hold the fuck up, Mystery Inc.”, Clint said, raising his hands to his chest as if surrendering, “Have you guys never watched a fucking horror movie in your lives? You don’t split up, that’s rule number two!”
“How much for him?”
“We’d also have to wait for him to open all those documents right in front of the camera. It’s just not practical”, Tony completed, “Not to mention… Obie is a lot of things, but stupid isn’t one of them. He most likely has different kill switches to make sure everything disappears if the authorities are alerted”.
“So, you’re single?” Tony asked in a hopeful tone.
There were too many goblins. Even with the bear’s help, it was still a difficult battle. They fought as if they’d been using swords their whole lives, which was weird but still very awesome. The gang killed the goblins that came at them with ease. Apparently, it was much easier, morally speaking, to kill people when you knew they were just illusions created by the God of Mischief. While they fought, Peter continued his work, liberating more and more animals, including a huge goat that Ned was pretty sure was actually a horse in disguise.
Tony took Morgan from the floor and sat her in his lap, smiling, “You know, Moguna, I once ate cookie dough with a stranger in the middle of a supermarket”.
“Thanks for the help”, Natasha said sarcastically, walking with purpose towards the door, quickly taking her high heels from the floor on the way.
“Maybe I do”, Steve replied all defensive.
was reaction enough.
Steve whimpered and moved his torso forward, both hands going for the edge of the counter, holding it as if his life depended on it. He had his eyes closed and his mouth was slightly open as he tried to breath. Tony smirked when he heard his lover’s whimpers and continued to work, taking Steve’s hard cock until it almost hit the back of his throat before pulling back slowly, sucking and circling the head with his tongue. He did it again and again and again, moaning once in a while, knowing the vibrations drove his lover even more crazy than normal. He felt Steve’s hand on his hair and knew the man was about to come; with a final moan, he took all of Steve’s length as he came hard into his mouth. He swallowed all of it and let his now flaccid cock go, giving it a long lick before getting up. Steve quickly pulled him closer, kissing him, tasting his own come in Tony’s tongue.
she promised him quietly with a kind smile,
Tony laughed. “Oh, yeah. He congratulated me on my upcoming engagement and offered to teach me a few tricks for the honeymoon”.
“Was that little bird my very bigmouthed secretary?”
Tony smiled, nodding. “Yeah, yeah, okay. Thanks, thunder thighs”.
“I’m gonna kill all of you, Barton”.
“Is that illegal?”, Steve inquired.
The voice sounded awfully familiar. Almost like… “Quill?!”
“As a matter of fact, yes, it did”.
Bucky tried to reply, but was laughing too hard to actually make any words come out of his mouth. It was Sam, wiping away tears, that answered the Captain’s question.
Steve wakes up.
“Oh no, he lost his Peter Tingle”, Harvey mocked him, making the boy glare at him.
“What on Earth do you expect to achieve there, Anthony?”
“HOLD IT”, Bucky exclaimed, turning his whole body on the couch to look at Steve, “Natasha Romanov? Red head, tall, looks like she could murder you with her pinky?”
It was strange... these emotions running through her body. It was none of her concern, not really; and besides, she worked for SHIELD. She was an agent; she was the Black Widow. She didn't have feelings... she had the mission. That was it. So she couldn't understand why she felt the need to warn Stark, to help him... He meant nothing to her. And yet, a part of her couldn't help but think about everything Stark had written in that diary, hidden away from everything and everyone.
I did it! I finally did it! Sorry for the delay, guys, but life's been pretty hectic. Also, I cut my finger while cooking three days ago and typing was just a motherfucking pain in the ass D:
“So, you’re not mad at us?” Steve asked Tony, looking lost.
“Shhh, it can hear you”, the mechanic replied, caressing its hood like it was a prized possession, “How old is it?”
“I couldn’t find any water”.
"I ain't dumb, you know. I don't know if you're FBI or CIA, but you had no jurisdiction! That ship belongs to Mr. Stark and you stole it!"
“Yes?”
Steve and Tony walked around, talking to some people, drinking some champagne and discreetly looking around for Obadiah. They saw Bucky standing at the bar with Sam. They raised their glasses when their eyes met, as if saying hello, and went back to their conversation. They looked quite natural, just two men talking and drinking, but Tony knew them well enough now to know that they were focused on finding their target. He was starting to wonder if Obadiah had not shown after all, when he heard a voice behind him.
“I eat”, Tony defended himself while stuffing his mouth with a huge piece of garlic bread.
date”.
“But if the entrance is secret, how is he gonna know where to go?” Peter insisted with a frown as he pulled on the hem of his father’s sweater.
Tony stopped for a moment, confused.
Tony and Natasha sat across from the boys and then, very discreetly, got their chairs a bit closer to each one of their ‘targets’. Natasha put her elbow on the table and threw a flirtatious smile at Bucky.
“Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I was just passing by and I gotta… I gotta go now, so… Yeah, sorry to bother you, Steve, I guess I’ll see you around”, as he said the words, Tony was very aware that he sounded like a kicked puppy, but he couldn’t help it. Without waiting for a reply, he just turned his back to Steve and his friend and got the hell out of there.
“Rhodey said the same thing”, Tony replied, nodding, “But Stane has a legion of lawyers. It’s hard to go against rich people. Trust me, I know”.
Tony simply showed him the middle finger and walked away, into the living room.
“You”, he pointed at Bucky, “tried to jerk off with your bionic arm and ended up getting it stuck in your penis and Tony had to turn it off to get it off your prick. And you”, he finished, turning to Sam, “forgot to zip your pants after you went to the bathroom and was banned from Taco Bell for walking with your dick out like a pervert”.
It was almost eight when the doorbell rang. He thought about ignoring it, almost sure it was Bucky coming to apologize yet again after Steve ignored his calls, but then he remembered that his friend had a key and had never once been shy on using it. When the doorbell rang again, he sighed and decided to get up and answer it.
“I know. I know”, Steve sighed. “Did I tell you my first date with Tony was not so good?”
“What, the friends part or the movie part?”
“You told him?!”
“I’m a spy, I know everything”.

“It’s a very nice surprise!”
, “but if you guys scare him away, I swear, Bucky, I’m going to kill all of you”.
“Yeah, look…”, Tony took one of Steve’s hands and put it on his belly, “Feel it!”
Steve looked at her a bit confused. “Uh, thanks?” And left the kitchen.
“Uh, I’ll have a gin and tonic, please”.
“Holy shit, those are real life goblins!”, Cassie exclaimed excitedly.
Everybody turned to Natasha, who was typing on her laptop, staring at the screen as if it had personally offended her.
“Natasha worked for Pepper for a little while. I got her phone and called. She thought my plan to pretend to believe you guys was hilarious and helped me out”.
“Any reason why he refused to go with you?” Natasha asked, putting a small piece of bread in her mouth.
“You know what that means, right? That’s where they keep the really freaky stuff”, Barton said, crossing his arms.
Steve and Tony checked each room, one by one, and found nothing but blood, bodies and broken equipment. There was glass on the floor, from the destroyed windows and flasks, and in some rooms the mixture of chemicals on the floor produced such a bad, strong smell that Steve had to wait outside while Tony checked the room for anything important. There were burnt marks on the walls and floor and even on some of the corpses. It was a gruesome scene.
“Jerk”, Steve replied softly under his breath, turning all his concentration back to the papers in front of him and trying not to lose himself on thoughts of Tony. Friday night couldn’t come fast enough.
He turned a corner and sighed in relief when he saw the fridges, full of all types of beverages and frozen meals and ice cream and… a guy. Steve frowned, stopping dead in the middle of the aisle to stare at the man; the man who was sitting on the floor, eating ice cream directly from the carton. He looked to one side and then to the other, as if looking for someone, maybe a concerned parent – even though he was pretty sure the man was at least in his twenties. His eyes turned back to the young man, who looked as if he had no idea Steve was standing there. He thought about leaving, just grabbing his beer and going away to an empty apartment where he could sob about his failed relationship, but he found that he couldn’t move. The young man looked sad, so sad. He couldn’t leave.
Steve quickly stepped to the side, opening the door wider for Tony to go through, which he did. He looked around the apartment, whistling.
to be called Bucky”.
“So, you’re going to take that?”
he had already said ‘hello’.
, Tony thought every time Steve even uttered the bastard’s name. He’d go on and on about his adventures with
“Sorry about your asshole fiancée”.
“Sure. I’m going to warn Bucky and I’ll be right back with your food. Text me the address and what you want”, he kissed Tony’s temple.
“Captain America!”, a woman sitting closer to them said, getting up. Soon, others started to do the same.
“Steve”, Bucky said on the other side of the line, “I’m in the bathroom closer to the entrance. Get your ass in here, we have a problem”.
“How do you know about that?”
the Director of the world’s biggest intelligence organization, you know”, she said, raising her eyebrow at them.
“Nope, it was hilarious”.
“Uh, ten minutes ago? Is something wrong?” But Steve was no longer listening. He left his drink in a nearby table and started running towards the bathroom.
“Hey, Tony. How are you?”
“Yes! He was angry because someone didn’t do their jobs and he told whoever it was that he was going to take matters into his own hands. I don’t know who screwed what up, but someone is definitely getting fired. I hope it’s Cindy, she’s always stealing my yogurts, that bitch”, she finished with a roll of her eyes.
“Wow. Scratch that, you’ve gotta be the worst spy ever”, Tony laughed, rolling his eyes, “Seriously, does Aunt Peggy know me at all? I’ve just been kidnapped. And then suddenly there are two guys showing up everywhere I go! I’m a genius, you know”.
He turned towards the patio, shouting “
“Good morning”, a voice spoke from the door.
Tony took a deep breath, turning from his computer to finally face Clint Barton.
“They are the best damn soldiers we have. They’ll stop her”, Ross said with a confidence he didn’t really feel at the moment.
Natasha and Bruce were still laughing like crazy when the elevator doors finally closed, cutting the others out of their line of sight.
He didn’t know why he was so worried. Tony wasn’t his friend; he was just an attractive guy at Walmart, that’s all. However, he couldn’t get him out of his mind, nor could he convince himself to just walk away. So he stayed there for what felt like hours, even though he was pretty sure it had been only half an hour, pacing around like a lunatic, worried about a man he didn’t really know and a baby that wasn’t his.
“Yeah, there’s only one problem”.
He shook his head and threw his head back, hitting the back of the couch.
Sorry about the delay, guys. I hope you all like this chapter. I'm still trying to decide if I'll post part two before updating my other fics or if I should update the other two first and then come back. But don't worry, I'll try to be faster this time lol
“Forget it. I’ll just die from stiff dick, I guess”, Tony offered dramatically, throwing his arm over his own eyes.
“Because we’re both men, Clint”, Steve explained like he was talking to a five year old.
“They found a way to harvest her power. It says here they drugged her and took her blood, every single day. Then they gave her blood to other subjects, I’m guessing the soldiers we just read about before, hoping they’d have similar powers. They called it Project FEAR: First Enhanced Army Reserve”.
“Do a quick view of the videos, J. How did they die?”
“Uh, it gave Stane all of our properties and all the money. It also gave him SI. He now holds 60% of the company’s shares”.
Natasha just threw him an unimpressed look before returning her attention to the phone, “Look, you can’t pull us out from this right now”.
“Right”, the brunette said, sitting down next to Steve, “So, you single?”
“I have some papers for you”, the woman said, somewhat apologetically, leaving yet another pile of documents on Natasha’s desk.
They watched, confused and horrified, as the soldiers, one by one, started killing themselves. A knife through the eye, a bullet in the head. Some turned their own guns against themselves, others simply dropped their weapons and started hitting their heads on the walls as hard as they could.
Steve sighed again and looked around, scratching the back of his head. “I don’t know…”
Steve frowned and opened his mouth to retort, but Tony shushed him with a hand gesture and a roll of his eyes.
Loki’s eyes widened slightly at the name of the game. “Interesting. What exactly is that?”
That seemed to bring the mechanic back from whatever thoughts were going through his head and he smiled, blushing. “Thanks. You too”.
“Here, I got Morgan a little something”.
“He was manipulating you; lightly calling out the abuser so it would seem he was on your side, but never doing anything to fully stop the abuse you suffered; playing your weaknesses: your need for parental approval, which is pretty typical on abused children, and your desire to protect those you loved, like Rhodey”, Natasha replied, looking away with a sigh, “I know something about being manipulated. When you’re surrounded by violence, it’s much easier to accept whatever kindness is bestowed upon you. It’s easier to just believe them”.
Harley snorted, “We’re not even talking”.
It was almost 7 PM when Tony finally got back home. He had spent the entire day putting out fires ― sometimes literally ― and, every time he thought he was done, Pepper would show up with something to sign or a problem to solve. He was tired. He was hungry. He wanted a hot shower, some food, and a bed ― preferably with 180 pounds of prime American beef right on top of him.
“Look, I’m telling you, he’s looking over here. And he won’t stop looking. You think he recognized us?”
“Steve, are you okay?”
Peter looked at the others with a grimace. “Well… Have you guys ever heard of this really old tale called ‘Empire Strikes Back’?”
And Tony thought about it. He remembered every happy moment he had with Steve, and how much he loved him. They had hurt each other, he knew, but they could get past it. He knew they could. So he smiled and took the flowers from Steve’s hand, holding them to his chest.
?” Clint asked in a mocking voice, “dude, of course we have to invite Tony, he’s our friend”.
But he didn’t have to say anything else. If this could help his mother, then he’d do it, no matter what it was. Besides, these papers were only to find out what exactly the solution the doctor had mentioned was. If it happened to be something Steve wasn’t comfortable with, he could just walk away and never mention it again. Without a second thought, he got up from the chair he’d been sitting, taking the pen from Dr. Erskine’s hand and promptly signed the papers.
“There’s nothing I want more in this world, Tony, than to make it up to you. There’s nothing I want more than to gain back your trust and, if possible, your love”, Steve said and, this time, there were tears in his eyes. He closed them, trying to keep himself for crying. And then, he felt a hand on his cheek and opened his eyes abruptly, surprised, only to feel Tony’s mouth on his. He held Tony’s face with cautiously, as if he could break him, and surrendered himself to the kiss, trying to show all his love and regret through it.
“…With me, right?” Bucky whispered with a frown.
“We were drunk”, Bucky continued, “and we saw this thing on the internet, right, about how these billionaire have personal assistants who probably go through their mail, right, and how it would be incredibly easy to like send a wedding invitation to a billionaire and the assistant would probably send a dope gift even if they don’t know you because they probably wouldn’t even bother to try and find out who you were, right”.
“Right, so, we made a wedding invitation using this weird website we found and sent it to Tony Stark and he kind of called today to invite us over for brunch at this stupid expensive hotel and to RSVP to the wedding”.
“I don’t know. I don’t much feel like throwing a party, Katniss”.
“I don’t know what you mean”, Natasha replied with an innocent smile that Tony knew was full of shit.
“… And there was a car shop nearby. That’s where I met him. His name is Tony”.
Ned smiled at Loki, “I’m Ned, the half-orc bard”.
Jessica knew this wouldn’t be an easy job. In her experience as a Private Investigator, a perfect crime usually required only two things: money and connections. And, sadly, her target had both to spare.
“He has a brother named Loki”, Steve repeated to himself, shaking his head.
“Relieved?”
“Tony? He was here… He was… Someone hit me from behind. We were talking…”
“Just not much for drinking in general, Mr. Stane”, he replied, trying very hard to sound polite, “Now, the purpose of this meeting?”
The whole situation sucked; there was no other way to put it. Steve was adamant that nothing could happen between them, especially given the fact that he was an agent working to protect Tony, and that a romantic relationship would be not only unethical, but also might complicate his job too much. Tony wasn’t thrilled about it, but respected and accepted Steve’s reasons nonetheless. The fact that they couldn’t be together, however, did not mean they couldn’t flirt shamelessly all the time. A touch on the arm whenever possible, holding hands when they went out to get food, lying his head on Steve’s shoulder during a movie or even running his fingers through Steve’s hair when he lay down with his head on Tony’s legs. The touches were harmless, but they were enough to drive him insane. There were times, however, when Steve seemed to forget himself and he’d just touch the engineer in an intimate way. Like when they were both on the line for Tacos and Tony felt Steve’s arms slowly encircle his waist. He held his breath and even closed his eyes, feeling the strong arms gently squeeze him just a bit, and then… his lips were on Tony’s neck, not exactly touching the skin, just… hovering there. He could feel Steve’s breath on his neck, slow and steady, making him shiver… His lips stood there for a few seconds, just blowing hot air on Tony’s neck, before he came to his senses and, with a sigh, stepped away, letting his arms fall from the engineer’s waist. Tony had turned them, his breathing erratic, only to be met with Steve’s sweet, sad smile. They never talked about these moments of weakness, preferring to pretend they had never happened instead, and cherishing them when they were in their own bedrooms, alone and free to remember and fantasize about things that could never happen.
“Oh, so it’s not a double date, you’re full on ganging on him”, Steve said, exasperated.
They smiled at each other and exchanged one last kiss before walking, hand in hand, towards the kitchen, where part of their beautiful family awaited for them.
“I’m okay. Meet Morgan Stark”, he said, showing him the tiny buddle in his arms.
we’re supposed to be doing this in secret?”
Things weren’t so different on the other side of the table. Tony and Steve had gotten so close together, their legs were touching. They talked about movies, about class, about their summer plans. Tony smiled at every word that came out of Steve’s mouth, touching his knee and moving a bit forward every time he laughed. When their orders came, they shared their food, feeding each other pieces of parmigiana and pasta.
“Obadiah Stane”, Director Carter clarified, “A few days ago, Agent Romanov overheard a conversation between him and who we assume was the Ten Rings. He’s been supplying them with weapons. And from what we could gather, Stane was the one who ordered the hit on my godson”.
“Oh, hey, I’m Bucky”, the guy said, offering his hand.
“Yeah, yeah, I know, quit messing around. Will you come?”
“Come on, Stevie. I’m really sorry, ok? I couldn’t have known…”
Tony looked down at their joined hands with a pained expression before taking his own hands back in a slow movement.
“Tell me about it”, the woman replied in a conspiratorial tone, “I heard some real weird things”.
“Oh, I know”, Tony smirked, giving him a final peck on the lips, “I ordered Chinese, by the way, so you should probably change”.
Tony looked away for a second and then back at Natasha, looking more determined than ever before, “we have a week before the charity ball. That’s more than enough time for me to create a program that can hack through anything Ty might have put in Stane’s computer”.
He heard a loud crashing sound, as if someone had just dropped something very happy, and then suddenly… Was that… beeping? Tony turned around, confused, and saw it. Looking at him like a child who has finally found his long lost father, was none other than DUM-E.
The workshop, as Miss Potts had called it, was like something out of a sci-fi movie. Steve couldn’t name half the things in there.
And so, that day, Margaret and Howard’s friendship had ended. The Director of SHIELD knew she stood no chance. The world wasn’t yet ready to embrace the love between two women and should word of her love life get out, Margaret would lose everything she had fought for her entire life, including access to her darling Anthony. That day, Howard promised to never again lay a hand on the boy, but she knew that wasn’t enough. She could see the man her friend had become; his cold eyes said it all. She knew there would be other forms of abuse and she would have to watch, helpless, as this shell of a once great man destroyed her darling boy’s spirits, unable to protect him from it. That day, Margaret’s heart broke in a thousand pieces, never to be fixed again.
Tony immediately closed his eyes, grabbing his husband by his jacket and pulling him closer.
“I love you. And I want to make you happy. Always”.
“I’m sorry, ma’am?”
“We need to find her first. Come on, Jarvis has already made a copy of everything. We should meet up with Nat and Clint, see if they found anything”.
“If it’s who we think it is and they’re talking about a deadline…” Sam started saying.
“So, let me get this straight… You all decided to go against the only thing I asked you to do and threw a party with the sole purpose of trying to make Steve, who doesn’t even remember me, jealous?”
Tony stood right outside the front door of his family’s mansion. He opened it slowly and watched, almost hypnotized, as the door softly bounced at the wall. The noise echoed throughout the empty room and it seemed to get louder and louder inside Tony’s head. He was very aware that Steve and Bucky were right behind him, patiently waiting for him to move. With a deep sigh, he finally managed to summon up enough courage to step inside the place that had given him so many nightmares.
The workers exchanged a very confused look amongst themselves and turned their heads back to Iron Man.
Tony huffed, rolling his eyes. “You didn’t rescue me. You spent three months doing God knows what while I rescued myself. The only thing you’re doing right now is giving me a ride. You’re my Uber. And you’re definitely two stars. I’m writing my review right now, takes too fucking long to show up and doesn’t even have fucking candy. Bullshit”.
“No, I’m not mad. In fact”, he said, turning to the people who were sitting down behind them, “great job, everyone, time to party”.
“So! You want to be a soldier. Kill some bad people overseas, is that right?”
“Wait, you’re not mad at Bucky for cheating on you?”
Stane and Tony confront each other.
Tony shrugged. “I like to live on the edge”.
“Good to see you as well”, he replied before pulling Tony closer, “This is…”
“Wow. Hi, handsome. You waiting for someone?”, he heard a voice from behind him and turned around, smiling.
“NO”, he shouted, grabbing the corners of the intercom like he could grab Tony through it and pull him into the apartment, “Please, come up!”
“Please”, he begged, spitting blood as he did so, “please, please, don’t…”
“How… How did you…?”
Steve turned his head slightly to the side and smiled when he saw his best friend.
But after two weeks of feeling miserable and sorry for himself, Tony decided he needed to get back to his life.
bad. Tony, in particular, looked like someone had stabbed him in the stomach. He excused himself and quickly left the room.
Natasha quickly, but discreetly, hid the screen of her phone from Steve.
A week had passed with no changes. Steve still didn’t remember Tony and didn’t seemed bother in the slightest by it, which only made the billionaire feel worse about the whole thing. Tony wasn’t giving up, though. Even though he remained adamant about the whole “we don’t tell Steve the truth” plan, he still tried to make him remember by doing small, simple things that could maybe spark some memories.
Stane chuckled. “Come on, now, my boy! I wasn’t happy about it. Do you think I wanted to give up my golden goose? I didn’t! You gave me no choice! But then… You had to go and put that stupid code on the Jericho and make everything harder than it had to be. That’s so like you, Tony, always making things harder for me”, he said, shaking his head, “So, here’s what’s going to happen, okay? You’re going to give me the code for the Jericho”.
When Steve finally realized the phone calls wouldn’t work, he started sending other things. On Friday, he sent flowers with a note.
“Sure”.
Suddenly, Steve was there, holding flowers and looking very nervous.
“What the hell are you doing here?”, Tony exclaimed, surprised.
“Oh, my mistake, then”, T’Challa said, unworried, “I did not know that, thank you for warning me, my friend”.
“I’m fine. And for the record, when I said I was into some pain, I was thinking more like a spanking or something”.
was lying, bloodied, unmoving and dangerously pale. They took him straight to the surgical room and Tony tried to follow, but was stopped by a set of big, strong arms, who held him back as he fought and screamed and cried Steve’s name over and over and over again between sobs.
“I’m sorry”.
Tony quickly put his hands on Steve’s neck, pulling him into a passionate kiss.
“Bucky!”, Steve exclaimed, “’Till the end of the line my ass, what a…”
“Yeah”, Tony replied, his eyes losing focus for a second as he touched his own chest where, Steve had just noticed, a faint blue light was coming through the shirt. His eyes met Tony’s for a moment before the young man looked away, closing his eyes with a long sigh. He would tell Rhodey about the arc reactor later. Right now, all he wanted to do was to close his eyes and think of home.
“Adrian Toomes?” she called.
“It’s a long story”, Tony replied with a grimace, but Steve was having none of it.
“Uh, are you alright?” the brunette asked, confused.
“I’m not interested in any new tech…”, Steve started to said, but was interrupted by something grabbing and pulling him by the shirt. He turned around and found himself face to face with what appeared to be a very big robot.
“It really is”, Steve agreed, standing right next to Tony, “you’ve been doing a lot for us, Tony. You really didn’t have to”.
“No, I have allergies, your cologne is gross”.
Tony shook his head, trying not to show just how scared he was. There was a crazy man pointing a gun at him. The same crazy man who had shot Obadiah in the head right in front of him.
“Don’t knock it until you try it”, she replied with a wink.
So, no computer yet, guys! I bought a SSD on Amazon to fix my computer, but they sent me one that didn't work so I had to return it and it's been six days and they still haven't given me my money back, so great!
“Stop that, you two! We need to work together here to fix this mess”.
, he wanted to say,
“We are not interest in that. We do security, that’s it. And if that’s all you called me here for…”
“Natalie, good. You have the copies, my dear?”
“Pepper, you be here by next week and I’ll not only give you a closet for you shoes, but I’ll ask Janet Van Dyne to take you to every single fashion show in New York for the next year”.
Tony served both their glasses. “So, when is the wedding?”
Tony didn’t hear Clint’s reply. He felt like his heart had just shattered into a thousand pieces. It felt just like when Obadiah tore away his arc reactor, only so much worse. So much worse than the torture in the desert, so much worse than Thanos sticking a piece of his own armor through his stomach. The pain was almost unbearable. He took a step back, looking at the floor but not actually seeing anything, his eyes losing focus. He didn’t even notice when Clint opened the door.
“Why don’t we just tell Steve about Tony?”
“Dr. Strange said they would. He’s the Sorcerer Supreme; he must know a thing or two”.
"Look, kid... Mr. Stark... He needs to know we found him, okay? He's been looking... He needs to know. It's all I'm asking here!", the man pleaded.
Everything so far was going according to plan. The people Sam and Clint had invited to pretend they were Steve’s and Bucky’s friends and family had all arrived and were sitting down in their respective seats, all quietly waiting for the ceremony. Both Steve and Bucky were already dressed and waiting to walk down the aisle. Everything was going fine. And that’s, of course, when everything went wrong.
Tony was confused. “Wait for what?”
But Tony did not have time to answer him because, at that exact moment, they heard Bucky’s shout coming from right ahead.
“It was fine at first. But then, something happened, I don’t know what. Tony wouldn’t tell me, refused to even talk to me the whole way back”.
“The whole family is coming, then!”
“How was the funvee, asshole?”, he asked, hugging the smaller man, “Next time, you ride with me”.
Thunder once again exploded outside, making Tony jump. He tried to calm himself, tried to get his breathing under control, but it was useless. He hated storms, always had, ever since he was a little boy. Although, back then, he’d had Jarvis to keep him company. He closed his eyes and smiled, remembering the old butler. He’d make hot chocolate with little marshmallows in it and talk to Tony about anything and everything, distracting the little boy until the storm outside had passed. It was one of the few cherished memories he had from his childhood.
Margaret shook her head with a quiet laugh, kissing his forehead once more before letting Rhodes take him to the bedroom, “I’ll be with you in a minute, Anthony”, she promised, watching both man disappear into the corridor before turning to Steve, a very serious expression in her face, “I received your report, Captain. It seems we’ve both come to the same conclusions”.
“Okay, we need a backup plan”, Steve said, trying to calm himself down.
“What do you mean,
“Tony, is that… Did you really?”
“The Mechanic has been taken”.
And, in that moment, Steve’s smile could light up the entire city.
“Dude, I’m following the plan, remember?” Bucky replied, rolling his eyes, “We need to make this breakup look real, dumbass”.
Tony, on the other hand, had met Steve in a Graphic Design class he once took. The soon-to-be engineer knew pretty much everything the professor was teaching, but noticed that the very attractive blond on his right was looking completely lost and desperate. He offered the young man, Steve as he soon found out, a little help with his project and they hit it off right away. They’d meet between classes to talk about some TV show or some book they were reading and, sometimes, Steve would come down to the labs with a cup of coffee and listen to Tony talk about the Artificial Intelligence he was creating, called “Just A Rather Very Intelligent System”. By the time Tony had finally noticed just how far in love he was with Steve, it was already too late.
She knocked softly on the door. “Anthony? Everything is alright now, my darling. Open the door”.
“I’m sorry about what happened that night”.
, Tony had asked with a small voice.
“I know, I don’t get it either. Maybe we should just come clean”, Steve replied, shaking the hand of a person he was pretty sure he had never seen before in his life, “who are all these people anyway?”
Tony tried not to roll his eyes at Steve and, instead, took a deep breath.
“He did this”, Rhodes insisted, looking around, “He escaped. We need to check the area around it”.
They had some fucking planning to do.
“Okay, Tony, whatever you say”.
Steve just stared at Natasha.
Tony nodded absently, not looking at Strange. ”So, we need to find Loki, then”.
“Yes?” He asked grumpily in the intercom.
“Trust me, I’m going to have a full meltdown once we’re back on the Quinjet. But right now, I’m trying to focus on getting the hell out of here”.
“With all due respect, Aunt Peggy, I wasn’t asking”, Tony answered with defiance.
“Already did it”, a voice exclaimed from behind him, making him jump.
“No. You’re right, you couldn’t have known, so you shouldn’t have exposed him like that”.
“Oh my God, it has a little lab coat!”
They looked at the body on the floor.
His apartment, once a beloved place where Tony would come up with amazing scientific innovations or just chill after a hard day of work, became a strange place he no longer recognized. Most of the time, he felt like the walls were closing in on him, somehow sucking out the air from the room. Sometimes, he’d find himself in a corner, sweating like a pig, hands gripping his hair, almost tearing it out, rocking back and forth with his eyes closed, desperately trying to rid himself of the memories that threatened to suffocate him. When that happened, he’d feel Rhodey’s strong hands touching the sides of his face, his soothing face assuring Tony that he was home, that everything was alright now. But the young engineer knew it was all a lie because
The engineer paid Steve no mind and continued to button his shirt, facing the mirror with a very determined look on his face.
“Keep your hands to yourself”, Steve growled, forcefully pushing his hand away.
“How long until JARVIS is done?” Steve asked, stealing some of his best friend’s shrimp.
Natasha and Bucky looked at each other and then shook their heads, looking down.
“Yes, about that…” Bucky started, looking at Steve for help.
“Uh”, Tony replied, confused, before huffing a laugh and saluting him back, “at ease, soldier. So, what happened to your friend?”
He sighed. “Okay, Clint, yeah, a party”.
“And now you die”, the man said. Tony moved quickly, ducking behind the pillar while Natasha jumped on the man, her legs circling his waist and holding him in a tight chokehold. The man yelped in surprise and dropped his gun. It fell to the ground with a loud clank and slid on the floor until it stopped right next to Tony, who, without thinking twice, took it and pointed at the man at the same time as he grabbed Natasha by the hair and shirt with both hands, pulling her forward with every bit of his strength, sending her crashing to the ground with a scream of pure fury. He raised his head and looked at Tony, his face red and contorted in rage, and stepped forward, arms extended to grab the mechanic. Natasha quickly hugged the man’s foot, trying to hold him back. And then, there was a shot.
“They probably put it on lockdown, to keep the woman out. JARVIS, can you override this for us?”
“What’s that?” Bucky asked over his shoulder, frowning as he looked at the phone.
“Barnes, Rogers. A word. Now”.
“I’m starting to sense a little threat in your words, Stane, and I gotta tell you, I don’t do well with threats. So you should measure your next words very carefully”, Steve replied in a warning tone.
“Agents Barnes and Rogers will be accompanying you in your trip. You are not to step foot inside Stark Industries without my say so and you will leave the airport and go directly to the mansion, do you understand? Do not try me, Anthony”, she warned when he frowned at her stipulations, “It’s either this or I will put you in a cell until this whole matter has been resolved”.
And as Tony continued to cry, hugging the blonde tightly, face buried on his neck, Steve kept on stroking his hair, whispering in his ear…
The files were then suddenly replaced by a folder named ‘Subject 0’, containing various documents and videos. Tony clicked on one of them and started reading aloud, so Steve could listen as well.
OUR BOYS ARE GROWING UP SO FAST
She checked her phone, opening the digital file Romanov had sent her a few days before. Obadiah Stane: an excellent chess player, top of his class, Business major. Father was a degenerate gambler, accidentally shot himself in front of his son while playing Russian roulette. Some people might say the trauma of watching his father get his head blown off made Stane the vile, cruel man he was today. Jessica thought that was bullshit. Trauma changes people, sure, she was living proof of that. But she was goddamn tired of these assholes using that to justify their shitty behavior.
The morning after.
“That’s… Actually a very good point. Was Steve attracted to Tony from the beginning?”
The party went on without any incidents. They ate, they drank ― well, they drank water because Tony wasn’t old enough and Steve was on the job ― and, at one point, they escaped to an empty balcony and Tony taught Steve how to dance amidst laughs.
, Captain, but for a… let’s say business proposition. Just hear me out. SHIELD trains the best people. And I happen to know a few people in very high positions in our government who would be very interested in a… let’s say… merger”, he started, gesturing to the chair nearby. Steve sat down, still looking very suspicious. “We both know how the world works. Civilians think it’s all black and white, good and bad, but
“Well, we were drunk…”
“I’m sorry, Stevie. But Greg checked their database for an Anthony Carbonell and the only one he found was some Italian rich type who died before this kid was even born. So, forgive us for being overprotective of you, but this piece of shit is lying to you about who he is”.
“So…”, Steve said, unsure of himself, “I have to confess, I haven’t done this in a while.
Steve smiled brightly at him and held Peter on the side to give Tony a quick peck on the lips.
Steve let his mind wonder as he waited for the bartender to finish his order. He pictured a house, maybe somewhere outside the city, with a big basement that Tony could transform into a workshop; a big kitchen, too, where they could exchange kisses as they cooked. He smiles just thinking about it. A big yard would be nice too, big enough that the kids could run and play. Kids… God, Steve was already thinking about kids. He shook his head, but couldn’t keep the smile off his face. He didn’t know if Tony wanted them, they hadn’t even discussed it, but it was a nice thought. A family… with Tony. He couldn’t wait.
“I’m pretty sure he would’ve hit a home run if I hadn’t interrupted it”.
“You too, T’Challa. How’s Wakanda?”
“You look relaxed”, Steve whispered in his ear, sounding pleased.
“That’s not true…”
Please try to control yourself.
with you, Nat”.
“What elevator?”
Not knowing what else to do, Steve and Bucky just nodded and turned as the doors opened. The music started playing softly on the background as they walked down the aisle. Sam and Nat took the front, with Clint and Wanda right behind them. Steve was sure the whole scene looked beautiful for anyone watching, but he, well, he just felt like throwing up.
Tony threw Bucky a very distasteful look, but ended up following him up the stairs and into the kitchen, with Steve right behind him.
“You wound me, sweetheart”, he replied, feigning hurt. He extended his hand, ready to touch Tony’s tie, but was stopped by Steve, who grabbed his hand midair with such force that Tony was sure he’d break it.
Warning: some sex talk. Not too graphic, imo, but some people don't like that stuff so be warned.
, Jessica thought to herself, getting closer to one of the walls. A picture of Tony Stark with what appeared to be a robot, a picture of him accepting his diploma at MIT, another of him at his parent’s funeral. On the desk right under the pictures, there were many photos, recent ones, of Tony… in his shop, at Roger’s house, walking in some random street, having a bite at a food truck. Jessica swore under her breath, taking her camera from her bag and snapping some quick pictures; this was getting more fucked up by the second.
“Yeah, but just to make Nat… No, wait, Tony, stop”, he said, jumping down from the counter, but Tony was already leaving the kitchen.
, the AI replied,
“Did you hear the conversation?”
“Calm down, Man of Iron. Your Midgardian doctors will help the good Captain now. But you must calm yourself”, he heard Thor’s voice in his ear.
“Thanks. Uh, I’m Steve, by the way”.
The little man looked at his minions, surprised. “I did not... give… everything?”
“I don’t get it”, Michele replied, confused.
The gate soon opened and the team stepped inside into what appeared to be an empty reception. Clint lowered his bow and put the arrow back into his quiver.
“I’m sorry, what?”
“Tony”, Steve said, relief dripping from his voice. He engulfed Tony in his arms, burying his face in his neck.
Steve smiled back at him. “Here, let me help you with that”, he said, taking Tony’s tie and tying it with amazing skill.
Steve didn’t quite know how to respond to that. Sensing this, Tony sighed and turned back to him while struggling to fix his tie.
“Oh. So, yeah, I… I do like Bonnie, a lot. But, hey, the serum fixed a lot of things, but my awkwardness in dates was not one of them”, he said, smiling sadly.
“Uh, Tones? There’s more of that”.
“Uh... You’re kinda of famous. I mean, youngest student to ever get into MIT, right? How old were you when you got in?”
“Why, though?” Clint asked, closing the door behind him as they left the room, “Why would she make them do this? Just stay there, sitting comfortably in an air conditioned room?”
“The same for me”, and, with that, the hostess quickly left.
Tony smelled coffee. He slowly opened his eyes, blinking. The other side of the bed was empty, but it was very much obvious that it had been occupied before. He smiled as he remembered the events of the night before. The way Steve had worshipped his body, his mouth slowly discovering every inch of him, his hands memorizing every curve. The young mechanic had been with his fair share of partners, men and women alike, but he could safely say that none of them had ever pulled him apart like Steve had. He had fallen right asleep after hours and hours of lovemaking, too satisfied and tired to stay awake any longer. He could still feel the delicious ache in his body as he moved on the bed, stretching his arms and legs like a cat.
It was Peter’s turn to snort, “Castle of Vania?”
, he thought, frowning. And that’s when he saw it. A huge piece of paper on the message board that almost took half of it.
“Okay. I’m not going to pretend I actually understand the politics behind this, because, honestly? I don’t. But if you think this is the right thing to do right now, then I’m with you, one hundred percent”.
“Can you come pick me up? Please, aunt Peggy? I wanna leave”, he begged between sobs.
“Hey, sweetheart”, he looked at Tony and frowned, worried, “Hey, something wrong?”
She nodded, raising an eyebrow. “Maybe I do. Why exactly would you like that most valuable piece of information, Barnes?”
“Savages, all of them”, Natasha whispered as she walked behind him towards the fridge to get a beer.
“You know, I find it very strange that Steve hasn’t tried anything with Tony”.
“Cookie dough!”, she exclaimed, eating her apple slices.
“We can get married. Holy shit, I can propose to Tony?”
“And if I told her, she would’ve told me that we needed to investigate, to confirm, she would’ve told me to wait… I couldn’t wait, Steve”, he replied, looking at him with so much feeling that Steve took a step back, “Those were my weapons, the weapons I designed!”
The teenagers suddenly looked up in alarm. Peter quickly got up with wide eyes, waving his hands in front of himself, knowing exactly what was going through the god’s head.
“FREEZE”, someone screamed from the door.
“Bucky’s right, we’re idiots”, Steve said when he finally managed to stop laughing, flipping the pancakes into a plate and putting it in front of Tony.
He pocketed the phone without looking at Bucky’s immediate reply and spotted Tony being brought back to the waiting room in a wheelchair. Steve quickly got up and walked towards him.
“Do you hear yourself? You sound like a crazy person right now”.
“Mr. Stane. I don’t usually make house calls, but I was nearby so it was no trouble”, he said, shaking the man’s hand, “I
, he thought to himself,
Oh, no
, he kept screaming at himself inside his head.
“Interesting. And this Dungeon Master… He decides what
The gang wakes up in a very strange land!
Tony could feel his eyes watering once more. He smiled softly, nodding. “I never… I never really had that. I mean, I had Jarvis, but…”, he sighed, biting his lip, “Thank you. For everything you’re doing for me. I hope one day I’ll be able to repay you”.
. It should be operational within a few weeks”, Stane said, gesturing to what seemed to be a simple missile.
“Yes, bad. Only dad says it, but that’s because he’s naughty”.
“Well, they’re all dead now, so… Maybe we can leave the forest?”
“We don’t know, Tony”, Natasha replied, “But we’re not ruling that out. We just think it’s weird that both your parents died in an accident days after the will was changed. It may be just a coincidence, but…”
Steve couldn’t decide what was worse: the fact that he had feelings for his very pregnant friend or the fact that Bucky –
“Hey, look who came to eat with the lower class”, the archer exclaimed with his mouth full, pointing the dripping spoon at Tony, “I thought you’d lock yourself in your room and cry over Cap’s absence”.
The old lady nodded, seeming satisfied enough. She walked to the counter and stood there for a second. She must have pressed a button or something, because Steve immediately heard a buzzing noise. The blond looked around, confused, until the lady gestured to the door behind her. Steve walked shyly through it and found himself in a smaller room filled with a huge bookcase. He looked around, confused as to what he was supposed to do, when the bookcase simply opened like a door, revealing a huge space that looked an awful lot like an army base.
But he couldn’t. He couldn’t say yes and he didn’t want to lie.
, the AI responded with what sounded an awful lot like an amused tone.
They blinked, looking very confused.
Steve stared at the picture on his phone with a smile on his face, completely ignoring the conversation happening around him. He was about to send a quick text to Tony, curiosity eating him up, when the man himself beat him to it, sending him the one piece of information he’d been dying to know for weeks now.
“Yep. Pretty good, too. But they shelved the program when it became Stane Industries. In fact, they shelved every single program that didn’t have weapons in it”, Bucky explained, flexing his metal arm, “I was lucky to get one before they did. It could use an update, but at least it’s still working”.
“Did you fuck it up?” Clint asked from the door while he ate his cereal.
“I deserve that. But come on, just give me a chance to explain myself?”
“See, that’s what I’m saying”, Bucky interrupted, pointing at Steve, “That right there. You fall too hard too fast and they take advantage of you”.
Tony turned in his arms and kissed him, making everyone else boo them and make gagging sounds. He paid them no mind, smiling up to his partner.
He closed the door to the car, turning to her with a curious, yet welcoming look. “That’s me. Can I help you?”
Anthony later learned that Natasha had just been adopted by his mother’s friends. She’d come from Russia and had been abandoned in a very bad orphanage by her parents.
This time, a drawing of a small brunette figure making a face at a cup of coffee while holding hands with the blond little man.
“Uh, I’m…”, Tony started to say, but a desperate Steve interrupted him immediately.
“Yeah, right, ice cream. You’re crazier than I thought”.
Natasha stayed silent. The man on her right came closer and slapped her as hard as he could.
“I can take a hit”, Steve replied full of conviction and a determined look.
With his imminent death, he reminisces...
“He’s looking at you”, Bucky whispered in a very low tone, putting his head even closer to Steve’s.
“No drinks before lunch, Captain? What, the missus will be mad or something?”
They looked at each other, confused, before turning their eyes back to her.
“Don’t worry. We’ll have plenty of time to celebrate just the two of us later, right?” Tony said suggestively to his fiancé.
“Thanks, Tony, I needed to hear that. You know what, I’m going to call her right now. Thanks a lot!”
“Loki did say he wanted to hurt you, man”, Clint shrugged, “so it makes sense”.
nervous. He kept tapping his foot and looking around and then at his watch every five seconds. He knew he was early, but he couldn’t help it. Steve knew deep down that nothing could happen between him and Tony. He knew that, he did, but he couldn’t help the excitement that threatened to burst out of his body.
Steve look appalled. “What? No! That’s so rude! I’d never say something like that about a dame!”
A palpable silence filled the room.
Michele stared at him for a moment, “That sounds like the worst plan ever”.
It took his driver twenty five minutes to get to the car shop, which was great because it gave Steve some time to get to know Tony. Apparently, the brunette wasn’t just a mechanic, but also a recently graduated MIT engineer. He had opened the shop not too long ago with the help of a friend. Paying rent wasn’t easy these days, he said, but business was getting better so he had high hopes for the future.
They took the elevator up and when FRIDAY asked where to, Steve promptly answered
He looked at her with a disbelieving look on his face. “And who’s going to put me in front of a judge, Miss Jones? You?”
“Why were you talking?” Sam asked, crossing his arms with a menacing look on his face, glaring at Stone.
“Where’s your ring?”
Steve loved his friends. They were his family, the only one he had. They had been together for years now, always helping each other through the tough times and celebrating together when life was going right. He loved them, he really did. But Steve also knew them very well, he knew just how protective they were of him and he was terrified of what they’d do to Tony when they finally had him at their mercy. He knew they meant well, but… God, Steve liked Tony. In fact, he was pretty sure he was very much in love with the mechanic already. Even the thought of losing him made his insides twist in an agonizing way. The uncomfortable feeling must have shown on his face, because he soon felt Tony’s hand softly touching his leg.
“So, apparently, they’re very strict about the whole no sex in the bathroom rule”, Bucky said with a shrug.
“Thanks”, he said, stepping away from Iron Man.
“We’ll call this Jessica Jones person, send her to Malibu, ask her to investigate the accident”.
Steve frowned. “I don’t feel anything”.
The dinner part passed without any problems and they actually had a lot of fun. They talked and drank good champagne with Clint, Sam and Nat while Wanda danced with some guy Steve could’ve sworn said his name was Vision and Pietro flirted with a girl who was clearly enamored with him. It was only after the best men toasts ― Sam and Clint had told every dirty little secret they knew about the fake couple ― that Steve finally found time to talk to Tony.
Tony threw him a confused look. “Who’s Ophelia?”
“Bad?”
Bucky choked on the brioche he was eating, prompting Steve to give him a very hard slap on the back.
Tony nodded. “JARVIS, you heard him”.
“No, not really. He left right after. But I was talking to Michael and he said that the whole engineering department got an email, like two minutes ago, saying they’re not supposed to go to one of the warehouses today”.
He smiled as he watched his husband and son laughing. Steve had Peter in his arms and was throwing him up only to catch him right after, making him scream in delight.
The link is down below but I don't recommend watching it unless you want to know what happens next! But I DEFINITELY recommend watching it after you're done with this fic, cause they are awesome!
With a nod, Hill left the office, closing the door behind her. Steve, then, took his phone from his pocket and quickly sent a text to his mechanic.
They never spoke about it again. It was an unspoken rule between them, it seemed.
“Uh, it’s Pe… Eldrin. My name is Eldrin”, he introduced himself with a nod, “Listen, Quill, I have some friends over there, on top of that hill, and we’re here to free you and all the other animals. But we need your help! If I get you out of this cage, can you attack the goblins?”
Tony is kidnapped and the team goes to save him.
“Well, I guess now we know where the bodies are”, Clint commented, trying to sound light but not quite managing it.
It took Steve three weeks to finally wake up. And during all that time, Tony did not leave his side. He slept at Steve’s room, showered at Steve’s room and the only reason he ever ate was because Natasha ― and sometimes Vision ― would bring him something and remind him to
“So…”, Tony said, smiling at Steve.
“I’m sorry, what?”

“Stevie, you monumental bag of potatoes, why the hell didn’t you say something? You could’ve just told him it was a joke and asked him out”.
Tony nodded. “I believe you. You didn’t remember me, Steve, it’s fine”.
Bucky was surprisingly well behaved after the whole “dead parents” incident. For hours, they shared stories, mostly about Steve’s childhood and army years and how they had all met.
under his breath, covering his mouth to stop the giggling from getting out. Clint, on the other hand, threw his head back so hard to laugh that he ended up falling from the kitchen island.
“I don’t know what to say to make it better, Tony”, he finally replied in a defeated tone.
“So, how was the party?”
“I know. But we have to stop her. Maybe with some guidance she could overcome all this. I’m sure the X-Men wouldn’t mind helping her”.
They walked together to the living room, where Natasha immediately sat on Bucky’s lap. Tony gave Steve one of the beers he was carrying and sat down beside him, accepting a peck on the lips as thanks.
"Now, for the weather..."
“Why can’t we tell Steve that you two were together? Doesn’t he deserve to know?” she asked softly, running her fingers through his hair slowly.
“The terrorist group has made no contact with neither family nor work relations of the prisoner, which leads us to believe that they are not interested in money. The Mechanic is quite the ingenious engineer and is the sole developer of most of the technology SHIELD uses, including our weapons, communication equipment and espionage gadgets. If this information fell in the wrong hands, it could mean the end of SHIELD”.
“Yeah, yeah”, he replied absently and then stopped, looking over at Steve with a raised eyebrow, “So, what’s the last thing you remember about this place? As in, the last time you were here?”
A very loud, mechanical noise was coming from the next clearing. They couldn’t quite see what it was exactly, but they could tell it was big. They exchanged a worried look, thinking back on what Dr. Strange had said about some beast they were suppose to defeat, and started down the pathway, looking apprehensive. Upon reaching the end of the path, they finally saw it. A gigantic machine in the form of a beetle was standing in the middle of the clearing, blocking their way to what appeared to be the edge of the forest. The beetle turned around every so often, smoke coming out of its head, stomping its big foots on the floor.
“Why the ever loving fuck would we do that?!” Bucky asked, “Pal, we already have a plan, a perfectly good plan, a plan that doesn’t involve me marrying your sorry ass!”
“I… What?”
Even though he very much wished to be anywhere but there, Tony had to admit that Natasha really could throw one hell of a party. The engineer walked around the room, smiling at everyone he encountered, trying so very hard to show everyone he was fine. Overall, he was doing a great job. He had pointedly avoided Steve ever since he had arrived and intended to continue to do so for the entire party. He knew he had to face his partner ―
“Thor! What are you doing?”
“Did you hear anything else?”
… Tony seized the moment and entered one of the offices, hiding himself between the wall and a big filing cabinet.
“Basically, you’ll become a special agent of SHIELD. And the pay will be enough to care for your mother’s medical needs, I’m sure. But I’m afraid, until you sign those papers, that is all I can tell you about it”.
“Okay, okay, we’ll tell him the truth”, Bucky agreed, “over brunch”.
With that, she got up abruptly and left the room, completely ignoring the surprised look on the agents faces when she passed by them, almost running to get to the elevator. As soon as the doors closed, she took her phone out and dialed; consequences be damned.
“Yeah, you’re going to need a lot more to convince me this was a good plan”, Tony replied, rolling his eyes.
“Is he okay? Are you okay?”
“You look as handsome as I remember, Tony”.
“Yeah. Apparently, Steve proposed the day before Loki came and fucked everything up”.
“Hi. You look incredible”, Steve whispered before pulling his boyfriend in for a long kiss. They were suddenly interrupted by a loud sniff.
“Well, if you noticed it was definitely strong flirting because you’re as dense as a wall, pal. So, he flirted, which means he’s not exactly into his girlfriend, right?”
Steve snorted and let his finger hover over the phone for a moment before replying.
On Sunday, nothing came. No phone call, no gift, no note, nothing. Maybe Steve had finally given up, realized Tony wasn’t worth the hassle and it was better to just take this opportunity to get out of the relationship he never even wanted in the first place. Tony was fine with that. He was
The extremely hot days and excruciating cold nights were driving him crazy. Well, there was also the whole torture thing going on, like how they water boarded him every single day for hours as he desperately held to his car battery, trying to keep it from getting wet like his life depended on it ― and it did. Yeah, the torture thing didn’t help his mood, but honestly, it was all the desert’s fault. Stupid desert.
to be handled”.
“You don’t get to tell me that, Rogers”, Tony replied, getting up and looking into Steve’s eyes as he softly caressed his face, “You died, Steve. You died and I just…”
“No punching, Uncle Buck! That makes you naughty!”
“Mr. Rogers, as I told you not even five minutes ago, we still don’t have any new information. You will be informed as soon as we do”, she said in a firn, but very tired tone.
“My father had the best lawyers in town”, Tony said, confirming Matthew’s words, “I remember the name of the firm, if that would help. They were from NY”.
Holy shit Steve is going to propose
Meanwhile, a very well dressed man was standing in front of Tony’s auto shop, staring at it as he smoked his cigar. He stayed there, watching the windows above the shop for a long time. He threw the expensive cigar on the floor, stepping on it with his very shiny shoes before taking a cell phone from the inner pocket of his jacket.
“Name?” Jessica asked, although she already knew.
Tony waited until they were far enough before turning to Steve, “Do we tell Natasha the mission is a go?”
“The computer Obie uses is a private one. It doesn’t have a connection to the internet and it’s not connected to the other company computers. JARVIS only found out about the weapon deals because Pepper hid a camera inside Obie’s office”.
“You said I was annoying and clingy. That you wished you saw less of me. I can’t help but wonder if you always felt that way and just… pretended for my sake”.
“No playing while we eat”, Morgan chastised them, repeating the same words her father always told her when she tried to bring her tablet to the dinner table.
“JARVIS, can you use these pictures to try and find something about these people on the internet?”
Jarvis wrinkled his nose, as if trying to stop himself from agreeing. “Maybe so, master Anthony, but she made her choice. Other people, like Mrs. Jarvis and myself, are victims of fate”.
“Great, we’re gonna have to fight goblins!”
He understood the words, of course he did. He was a genius and, even if he wasn’t, they were easy enough to understand. Still, he asked:
Tony scooted over so Steve would have more room. He happily took the place offered, getting even closer to the other man.
“Nat went to the workshop to get Tony”, he heard Clint say, probably answering someone’s question. Tony was about to open the door when he heard a sigh.
“Steve Rogers”.
Tony smiled and, instead of using words, just pulled Steve down for a kiss, holding him tight and letting himself be held by him. The people near them started laughing, and cat whistling and clapping. But suddenly, all the noise stopped and the couple heard someone clearing the throats forcefully. They interrupted the kiss, looking for the source.
. Tony took a deep breath, trying to get himself ready to face the day, and walked down the stairs, straight to the kitchen to have some breakfast.
thing, he couldn’t exactly tell people what he did or who he really was, which made dating so very hard. Not to mention the shared life experiences. The only other person who could ever understand what he had gone through was Bucky and he was very straight. But now, now, here he was, with a very handsome man not much younger than him asking him out with a smile. He had given up so much of his life already. He didn’t think he could do it anymore.
“Real bad flirting, but yeah. And if he was flirting with you, that means he’s not happy in his relationship!”
“What do you mean? There was an investigation, there were CCTV footage reviewed. Obie made sure…”, but then his voice faltered as he stared at the pity looks everyone was sending his way, “Obie… You think Obie had my parents killed?”
The SHIELD agent smiled sweetly at the other woman.
“Oh, really?”
STEVE IS GONNA PROPOSE Y’ALL
Please, forgive any mistakes, it's almost midnight and this is the only time I have to write D: Hope you guys enjoy the second and last part!!
“I’m sorry, what?”
At the end of the meeting, when the Director finally stopped talking, an eerie silence took over the room. Nobody knew what to say. It was in that moment that Tony finally lifted his head, brown eyes meeting the blue ones of his godmother.
“I’m sure it was a very mighty watch, nevertheless, my friend”, Thor spoke, slapping Steve in the back in solidarity.
Tony threw him a small smile, “Nothing all that interesting. What about you, Cap, what have you been up to?”
“HE DID WHAT?”
“Do you want to run? Or do you want to stay and fight them? It’s your choice, love”, Steve asked softly, cleaning away a tear with his thumb.
“Hey. You need something? I’m kind of busy, I have a date with Steve”.
“I know you’re here, Stark”, the man shouted, “You die tonight”.
he thought angrily to himself. He slowly put his head out, trying to listen to the man’s steps or screams. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself.
He should’ve known something like this would happen. He should’ve seen the signs.
. He was talking about Rogers. Stark had been paying a crew to search for the Valkyrie for years, ever since it had disappeared into the ocean, taking the man he loved with it. And now, they had found it... They had found Rogers... and SHIELD had his body... and Stark didn't know.
“What the hell was that?”
They were about to celebrate their one month anniversary and Steve could not be happier. After that particular night in his apartment, where they spent the night together in each other’s arms and Steve had woken up to a
“Thanks, but I should finish these”, then, she lowered her voice and got a bit closer to the other woman, who stepped forward, as if ready to hear a dirty secret, “the boss’ being a bit impatient lately”.
“Okay. So, we have the will taken care of. Now, what are we going to do about the rest?” Bucky asked, crossing his arms and letting himself fall back on the couch.
“Are you okay?”
“Shut your fucking mouth, is that a ring?”
The party was a typical frat party. Lots of booze, lots of people, lots of chances to hook up. And it was there Tony met Steve. He had been in a corner, looking around like he wanted to be anywhere else but there, drinking beer from a plastic cup. Years after, Tony would swear to anyone that it was love at first sight. The minute he saw Steve standing there, with his way too small white shirt, and his blue pants, and his hair looking like freaking Johnny Bravo, he knew he had found the one… The one to spend many nights under the sheets doing things that would make a very experienced hooker blush.
“Tony”, he started to say but shook his head and got up, exasperated, “Why didn’t you tell me? Hell, why didn’t you tell your Aunt Peggy? She is literally the director of the biggest secret organization in the world”.
“Tony…”
“Yeah, okay, I like him. Happy now?”
“Hey, guys. This is Tony Carbonell. Tony, this is everyone”.
“I’m horny, Steve! Do you have any idea how many times I’m masturbating every day?”
Tony is dying, there is no denying it. Even though he still has hope that somehow he will find a replacement for the palladium, he is a practical man, always has been. And so, he starts to get his affairs in order.
“I’m in”.
“OH MY GOD! This again! I was stupid, I fell for the wrong person, I got my heart broken, BIG FUCKING DEAL! It’s happened to everyone. Or do I have to remind you of Connie?” Steve replied before covering his face with his hands, “How many times are you going to remind me of that? I fell in love, I got played, I was sad and I moved on”.
“Cool. So… Since we’re on the same page… You wanna come in and watch a movie?”
And, with a short nod towards the reporters, Obadiah walked away, leaving a perplexed Tony behind.
Tony threw him a look at the word
“Stop looking at him, Buck!”
“So… This is awkward”.
“That’s a very serious accusation”.
“Right, yes, of course”, he said, shaking his head with a grimace, “I promised I’d behave tonight. No shop talk, you understand”.
“So, what’s wrong with it?”
She was absolutely beautiful, there was no denying it. And incredible at her job, which was a plus.
“There’s nothing to talk about”, he replied, sounding more tired than Steve had ever heard him.
and smiled awkwardly at Steve as the blond pulled the chair for him. They sat down at the table outside and the mechanic took a moment to admire the beautiful view they had of the city before accepting a menu from the hostess.
“We should keep looking. Come on”.
“It’s hard. Yeah, I know”, Steve said softly while they both fastened their seatbelts, “Hey”, he called out when he noticed how nervous Tony had suddenly become, “everything will be fine”.
“She doesn’t want to hurt us. We didn’t know. So we just need to stay here until it’s over”, a man said, sitting back down and turning his eyes back to the front of the room.
Steve took a deep breath and nodded firmly. “I’m going out with Tony Stark”, then his eyes widened, “Oh my God, I’m going out with Tony Stark. What should I wear?”
She watched as Toomes arrived in an Audi and got out of her own shitty car, walking slowly towards him.
Steve turned around, coming face to face with the nurse that had taken Tony away. “Is he okay? Did something happen?”
“I’m tempted to just let her, if we’re being honest”, Tony said with a sigh, “I mean, what they did here? It’s just…”
“I met him yesterday. I was taking Clint’s car home and it broke…”
“Oh… Uh, I’m… Yeah, I’m single”, Steve stammered, nervously tapping his pencil on the notebook he had on his lap, “Yeah, single, I’m single”.
“Wow. Well, you need to really think about this, Steve. You don’t want to make a mistake and have to live with it for the rest of your life”.
As predicted, Tony burst out laughing at the sight of him, “Nice shirt”.
, he thought with tears in his eyes.
If Steve had had a choice, he’d have chosen to go to art school. He would’ve stayed with his mother, happily using his creativity to create beautiful pieces of art and hopefully one day his work would be worth something, at least enough to give his mother the quiet life she deserved. But as it were, destiny had a very different plan for Steve Rogers.
Bruce looked up from his phone. “Oh, he had to go to the bathroom”.
“Yeah, yeah”, he replied, “sit down, Tony. Hey, Steve, why don’t you go get your man a drink?”
Originally, I planned for three chapters, but I couldn't finish on this one. I have two endings in mind, a happy one and a sad one. So, which one would you guys prefer? The sad one? The happy one? Both? Let me know in the comments!
Tony was angry; angrier than he’d ever been before in his life. Here he was, completely vulnerable, having his own tech used against him. He’d felt hatred before in his life, mostly towards his drunk, abusive father, but this… This was a whole new level. His blood boiled inside his veins as he looked at Stane’s smirking face.
“I’m checking his workshop, stay alert, we might need reinforcements”.
Natasha turned to look at him with an arching eyebrow.
“Okay. Let’s have a wedding, then”.
Tony just blinked, staring at Steve.
The little man laughed. “Solohob? A bagman. A front. Your outdated information betrays you. Now, you will tell Lermentov that we will no longer require his services and… Well”, he said, taking a pair of pliers from the table nearby, “you might have to write it down”.
“Would you like to come inside?” Tony asked with a hoarse voice, his eyes full of desire as he looked at Steve.
Bruce gave Steve his own glass ― he never drank at these functions anyway ― and the soldier gulped the entire glass.
“It’s true, he’s literally broke down walls before to get into a room”.
“Perhaps the spell did not merely erase the Captain’s memories, but did something else as well? Maybe it blocked something inside the Captain’s mind, making him incapable of falling in love with Mr. Stark again”.
“Wonderful”, Loki replied with a wicked smile, “Well, then, are you ready to embark on a new adventure?”
“Oh, cool, you wanna come in? We’re just gonna play some Call of Duty and chill”.
“Sorry, can’t today”, Natasha replied with a fake apologetic tone, “Maybe next time”.
“Aren’t you coming?”
“What’s up, love birds. I brought food”, he said carrying a big brown bag and putting it on top of Tony’s table.
“YEAH, WE’RE PLANNING A WEDDING, BABY”
“Cheating on me? Natasha is the one cheating on you!”
“I do. I trust you”.
The line went dead as soon as she finished talking.
Tony should have noticed something weird was going on when, right after the dance with Thor, T’Challa approached him with a plate in his hands, looking far better than anyone had a right to, in Tony’s opinion.
Tony wasn’t afraid to say that he panicked a little bit when he heard the news. Okay, not a little bit, a lot. Like, a full panic attack that had him sitting down in the middle of the parking lot at the hospital, just looking like a maniac as he desperately tried to breath. He vaguely remembered a little old lady asking him if he was alright. He couldn’t recall what exactly he replied to her, or how he got inside his car, but somehow he did both those things. It took him a long time - maybe half an hour? He wasn’t sure - to finally calm down and, when he did, it was like he was back at the doctor’s office, hearing the news all over again. A baby. Tony was going to have a baby.
Tony, on the other hand, was anything but calm. In fact, he was terrified. He couldn’t tell them the truth because, if he did, he’d have to explain a lot of things from his past that he was definitely not comfortable talking yet. Or, even worse, they could turn on him and tell Obie where he was, which would be a complete disaster. He took a deep breath, trying to come up with a plausible lie.
“You can’t hack it?”
A lot happens!
have a bad feeling about this, Cap”.
“What do you want in your pancakes?”
“Don’t, Hawkeye”, Bucky warned, eye still trained outside, looking for possible hideouts.
“DUM-E?”, he asked in a whisper.
She noticed a shadow from the corner of her eye and quickly slid the phone into the open drawer, pretending to take the stapler.
, he told himself, trying to remain calm,
Clint opened his mouth, then closed it, looking at the others for help. When none came, he shrugged and looked down. “It was Bucky’s plan”.
They were currently at conference room B. The compound was completely empty except for them, Friday and the bots. Natasha was visiting Clint at the farm, Vision and Wanda were out having ― Tony shuddered ― a date and the others, well, Tony had no idea where the hell they were.
(See the end of the chapter for
“MY INCOMPETENCE?”, Stane shouted at the phone and then lowered the tone once more, glancing at Rushmore’s desk to make sure she was still out making copies, “
(See the end of the chapter for
“DAMN IT”, Ross screamed, punching the table in front of him.
Tony shook his head. “No… but I will be”.
“Yeah, that one was to die for. I don’t think I’ve ever eaten a cake this good in my entire life. Stevie, which one is your favorite?”
As if summoned by the mere mention of his name, Tony showed up, a big smile on his face.
It’ll become much harder to sell the weapons without his knowledge”.
, Clint shouted in his ear, but Steve just ignored him.
“Remember when Danvers was showing us her powers and she aimed a beam at that watermelon?”
“Hi”, Tony replied, biting his lip.
, he thought to himself, hearing the footsteps behind him becoming stronger,
“I’m sure we’ll find him soon enough, Lieutenant”, Steve replied, softening his expression, “Very soon”.
“Even though you
Mario’s was completely empty. All the tables had been removed, leaving only one in the middle of the restaurant, with a white tablecloth, two blue orchids and some lit candles.
Steve, still confused with his boyfriend’s reaction, nodded. “Okay. Yeah, let’s go home”.
Miss Potts was staring at them, apprehensive.
AYE, YOU CAN EXPLAIN THESE CONFUSING CUSTOMS WHILE WE BATHE.
Tony smiled. “More than okay, soldier”, he said, kissing his future husband.
The bear looked up and around, apparently searching for the origin of the voice, and finally set his big eyes on Peter, “Hello, little one. You should run before they catch you too”.
“We should split up, we’ll cover more ground like that”, Natasha suggested, very clearly trying to ignore the scene in front of her.
“Sorry, sorry, it’s just… She wasn’t right for you, you know. But hey, maybe you’ll meet someone at the party, huh? Try dancing a little with some people and who knows, maybe you’ll find that the right partner was right in front of you all along”.
It was past eight when Steve finally managed to leave the office, tired and angry. His meetings had been a complete disaster and his head hurt from spending so much time with such egotistical, selfish people who cared about nothing but money. It never ceased to amaze him how awful these rich types could be.
He felt strong arms encircling his waist and closed his eyes, smiling.
Steve snorted. They shared a look and just started giggling. The whole situation was ridiculous.
Steve rolled his eyes, “Just find us something to explain all this, Tony”.
Bucky and Sam were laughing their asses off, holding their stomachs and desperately trying to breathe. Clint stood in front them, his mouth wide open, moving his hands back and forth in front of his mouth. Steve narrowed his eyes.
“Tony”, he replied with a mouthful of cookie dough.
"Agents", Natasha called out, making both agents slightly jump. They seemed to finally realized she was there, "Jones and Hernandes, is it?", she read the names from the cards stuck in their chests.
“What the hell are you doing, Clint?”
“What do you mean?” Bucky asked, but Steve shook his head.
The next morning came and there was still no message from Tony. Steve tried to respect his obvious wishes to be left alone, but when lunch time was approaching and there was still no text or call, he started to get antsy. Clint assured him that everything was fine, that Tony hadn’t left his house nor anyone had come over since yesterday, but still… He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Finally, he decided that enough was enough and called Clint, saying he was on his way to relieve him for the day.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh, sure, yeah”.
“You should call her. Worst that could happen is she says no, but I doubt she will. She’d be crazy to say no to you, Steve. You’re good looking, you’re kind, you’re funny. And, more than anything, you deserve to be happy. You own it to yourself to at least try”.
“I spent all my life in the spotlight”, Tony replied, squeezing Steve’s arm as they neared the end of the red carpet and climbed the steps towards the entrance, “I never really liked it. Not so much because of the attention, because, if I’m being honest, I love being the center of attention”, he laughed under his breath”, but the scrutiny, the judgment… It was tough growing up like that”.
“Who’s the big old bald walrus?” Clint whispered to Steve.
And with that, Tony left, Pepper and Rhodey right after him.
Steve bit back a smile as he watched Tony turning his whole body to the side with an expression on his face that said
They jogged down the corridors and back to the starter point, where Steve and Tony were already waiting for them. They didn’t have time to talk, however, because as soon as they stepped inside the room, the bodies on the floor started to get up. Steve pushed them back with his shield while Tony used his blasters to keep them away. Natasha and Clint drew their guns once more, shooting anyone who dared to come too close.
“The super soldier serum?”
Tony turned to the others, excited. “I designed the tower myself”.
“We met at the army”, Natasha told him after, sipping her drink, “He was my Captain and one of the few men who didn’t treat me like I didn’t belong there”.
Confused, he gave the cell phone to his boss. “It’s for her”.
“You put on a metal armor, flew to a town controlled by the most dangerous terrorists in the planet, fought them, destroyed the weapons that Stane sold them under the table, was hit by a missile and then almost killed by the US Air Force… I am the worst bodyguard ever”.
So Tony approached him carefully. He’d learned the hard way to never assume a guy was, well, interested in guys. Straight men could be real dick heads about getting hit on by another man. So he introduced himself with a smile, asked for Steve’s name, which he promptly gave, and they started talking. As the party went on, they talked about everything… college, parents, favorite movies, favorite food, how cool is the new Star Wars movie, and on and on. At one point, Tony asked if Steve was interested in going somewhere private. They ended up in Steve’s apartment, with a very satisfied Tony being thoroughly fucked against a wall.
“You think making him jealous is going to break the spell?”
But he never finished. Tony winced when he heard the shot, thinking maybe Obadiah had finally grown tired of the whole conversation and decided to kill him right there and then, but then he remembered… He hadn’t seen a gun on his hand before. Obie took a step back and looked confused, raising his hand and putting it on his chest, where the blood began to stain his white shirt. He fell to his knees and took one last look at Tony before crumbling down on the floor. Tony watched, horrified, as he coughed and gasped for air. The shooter still had his gun pointed at Stane. He walked slowly towards him and Tony with a determined expression on his face.
“I loved it”, Tony replied with a fake smile, taking the watch from the box and staring intently at it, “I absolutely loved it. It’s beautiful, thank you”.
“POPS!” Peter shouted, dropping his half sandwich on the plate and jumping down from the stool, running towards the living room as fast as he could.
Tony thought about it for a second and, in the end, nodded slightly.
“Very well! You won’t regret it, Stark”, he said with a wink before allowing his wife to pull him towards another couple that had arrived, waving at them as he went.
“I mean, didn’t Obadiah tell you to keep a low profile?” Steve tried again.
In a blink, a memory from a few weeks ago suddenly appeared on his head.

“Come on! Nobody exploded, nobody’s face melted off. This is already way better than the last time we were in Budapest”.
Natasha and Clint were the first to arrive. They stepped out of the elevator and looked around. They expected to see Tony pacing back and forth, pulling his hair from his head, panicked at the very idea that his partner of three years wanted to spend the rest of his life with him. They did not expect to find Tony in his closet, an excited smile on his face as he looked through his clothes.
“Mogan!” the baby girl screamed, laughing out loud when Steve picked her up in a swoop, drowning her in kisses.
Hope you guys enjoy the chapter! (; Remember to leave a comment, I love reading your opinions and thoughts about the story!
He pressed send and left his phone on the nightstand before closing his eyes and drifting off to sleep.
Steve just threw his hands in the air, in a clear gesture of surrender.
“Uh, the pork one, please”.
“Heeeeeeeeeey. Where’s Mr. Rogers?”
Steve frowned and looked down at Tony.
“It’s fine. Here”. It was only when he pulled the chain with Steve’s dog tags over his head that the soldier finally noticed something different in it. A ring, a simple golden band shining amidst the silver. Bucky took them for Tony, feeling his hand shake a little as he stared at it.
Stane, however, slammed his hand on the door, keeping it open. He glared at Tony and puffed his chest, making Tony take a step back. His heart was beating faster than ever before.
(See the end of the chapter for
“TONY STARK WAS ABLE TO BUILD THIS IN A CAVE”, he suddenly shouted, turning all of a sudden and putting his finger right on the man’s face, “WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS”.
“You went out with someone?”, Tony asked again, the pain now clear in his voice.
“Something  wrong?”
“Really? Why?”
“This is not very sexy”, he said in a sad tone, throwing his head back, “It’s like trying to fuck Moby Dick”.
, Bucky thought, shaking his head as he walked his best friend inside his apartment.
“Drogon, the dragon born paladin”, Harley said with his mouth full of M&Ms.
“You have a bit of sauce here, hold on”, Tony said with a laugh, using his thumb to clean the corner of Steve’s mouth and then, without breaking eye contact, put said thumb in his mouth, sucking it lightly. Steve just stared at him, openmouthed, his eyes slightly widened. He cleared his throat a couple of times and blushed furiously with a shy smile.
Leave comments and kudos, please! Let me know what you think!!
“Pete can turn into animals! He could turn into a cat, go down there and open the cages with his tiny claws”.
“Steve!”, someone called from behind him. Suddenly, Bucky and Sam were there, jogging alongside him.
And so the years had passed as she watched the abused bestowed upon her godson. Anthony, however, never once lost his natural glow. He stood his ground, staring at his father in defiance, never once wavering. Margaret could not be more proud of her darling boy. But as Anthony grew, his sense of self worth diminished. He thought of himself as unlovable. After all, if his own parents did not care for him, then how could anyone else? And no matter what Margaret or Jarvis or Ana did, they could not convince the young boy that he was loved and it broke their hearts a little bit more every day. As time went by, Jarvis passed away, Anna soon following him. Anthony was sent to a boarding school, where he spent every holiday season alone. At first, he would call his godmother every day. After a while, the calls became rarer and rarer until one day they simply stopped coming. And Margaret wept, unable to do anything but watch her boy from afar. She sent him cards and gifts for him birthday and Christmas. She called frequently, although Anthony rarely answered. She had expressed just how proud she was of him when he joined MIT at fifteen and stood there in the middle of the crowd, applauding him when he received his diploma, his parents nowhere to be found. She was there to hold his hand as people from all around the country paid their respects to Maria and Howard Stark.
“I’m guessing not. We should take that path; it looks strangely lit when compared to the others”.
Tony didn’t turn, nor did he acknowledge Natasha’s presence in any way, keeping his eyes focused on the suit in front of him. Natasha sighed.
“Does everyone have their…”
“Why are you like this, Stevie?”
He turned to his right, watching as the elevator doors suddenly opened and laughed upon seeing a very sheepish Steve walking out of it with one bag on each hand.
Part two of two.
Steve raised his eyes, surprised, “What?”
So he stayed quiet, never uttering a word about what had happened over there and never sharing just how broken and completely defeated he felt. He smiled to reassure the people around him that he was fine. He got up every morning and went to class. He worked on his thesis and he came back home. He ate whatever Rhodey put in front of him, chewing and swallowing like a robot, and then he went to sleep, too exhausted to try and stay awake. And that’s when the nightmares would come. And every night, without fail, he’d wake up covered in sweat, shivering, tears streaming down his face as he desperately tried to calm his erratic heart, to erase the memories that seemed to claw their way into his brain. And then, the memories of the desert started to slowly blend with the memories of his childhood, making the whole thing so
She looked surprised for a second, but hid it quickly, “And the card? What should it say?”
as the blonde hugged him back as best as he could, burying his nose on Tony’s hair and he whispered back
He was about to pull the trigger when suddenly the lights became unbearably bright, blinding him. He hide his eyes with the same arm that was holding the gun for a quick second before extending it again and shooting. But Tony did not wait. Finally able to move, although not with as much agility as he usually had, he rolled out of the way just as the bullet hit the desk that had seconds before been serving as a backrest. He thanked JARVIS in his head and considered his options quickly: Whoever the man was, he was between Tony and the elevator; there was another one, however, on the other side of that floor. Determined, Tony got up and made a straight line for the long corridor filled with offices. He heard the man shouts and another shot fired, thinking
The next building looked very similar to the last one, the only exception being a small plaque beside the door that said
“I have something you need to see, Mr. Stark”.
It was three in the morning when Tony got the call. He woke up to FRIDAY’S voice whispering “
cock”.
“Oh, it’s a great restaurant. You like French cuisine?”
Steve frowned when he heard Tony’s last name. It sounded awfully familiar, but he wasn’t sure where he’d heard it before. He accompanied the nurse and Tony to the entrance, where the young man was finally able to leave the wheelchair behind. They said their goodbyes to the nurse and walked over to the car.
“So romantic”.
Tony didn’t know how to react. He remembered when he first came out to his parents as bisexual. His mother thought it was just a phase, something that would pass with time. Howard, on the other hand, almost ripped him a new one. He screamed for hours, called Tony every name in the book, told him he was a disgrace to the Stark name and so on and so on. It was horrible. Then he thought about Rhodey and how terrified he’d been when the older boy caught him in a compromising position with Tiberion Stone. He looked livid. He threw Tiberion out of the apartment and he was so angry Tony actually thought Rhodey might hit him or something. And then he started screaming. And Tony almost burst into tears out of sheer relief.
, he would think to himself, taking a deep breath, trying to calm himself,
Suddenly, all Steve’s blood seemed to go south in a hurry. He adjusted his legs to hide his half hard dick while trying not to picture Tony… Tony in his big bed, lying down, naked, slowly stroking himself…

Tony shrugged, smiling. “At first I thought maybe you were embarrassed of me. You know, introducing the mechanic to your rich friends”.
“Good”, Tony replied, satisfied, even though deep down he felt a little sorry for Steve.
for us”.
“You know the target?”
The captain stood up, a determined look on his face, “I’m going to propose to Tony”.
“We don’t need a chimney; we have a secret entrance just for him”.
“You’re going to take the elevator to the tenth floor. There are two security guards who watch that floor; JARVIS has already given us their entire route, so it will be easy to avoid them. You’ll take the main elevator to the sixty third floor, where Stane’s office is located. And that’s where it gets tricky”.
Tony makes a decision and Peggy is not happy about it. Also, Stane.
Steve had to admit, that hurt a bit. They hadn’t started their relationship in the best way, but they had been together for two years now. He really thought they had reached a point in their relationship where they could be completely honest with each other.
Steve nodded with a sigh.
“It probably would”, he laughed, shaking his head, “Unfortunately, I don’t have any milk”.
The woman looked to both sides and, seeming satisfied that no one was near enough to hear their conversation, started talking in whispers.
“Tony, I… I’m sorry, but I just… Shit. Okay. The truth is I didn’t want to break your heart, okay? You looked really happy and then you kissed me and I couldn’t tell you, you know? I’m sorry. But it doesn’t matter…”
PS: About the 'legal' pieces in this chapter, I know absolutely nothing about injunctions and, well, law in general, so let's just pretend all written in there is super correct, ok? lol
“Wait here”, the doctor said, leaving the room.
“You know, when I ordered the hit on you… It wasn’t personal. You’re good at this creating thing, Tony. The weapons, the missiles, the tech… They were all amazing. So much better than anything Howard ever did, that’s for sure”, he explained, grabbing Tony’s face, smiling down at him, “but you’re turning 21 soon and that means you’d get the company. I worked too damn hard to let that happen”.
Suddenly, “The Way You Look Tonight” came on and Tony felt like crying. He took a deep breath and swallowed the tears that threatened to fall while Thor swayed him from one side to the other.
“Good news is I found our guy’s hideout and there’s enough here for a judge to overlook the ‘illegal acquired’ part of the evidence. He most likely planned the accident and I have the missing footage proving that he killed Howard Stark with his bare hands”.
Tony told Steve about college and how his parents had died in a car crash on the same day he had presented his thesis for his PhD. He told him that he had very much wanted to start a second PhD, but was unable to because he didn’t have the money to pay for it. So he had left MIT and opened the auto shop with the help of two very good friends.
Tony.
“Wow. It’s like his brain just vacated the premises”, Bucky said, shaking his head, “Steve, are you seriously thinking of asking Tony Stark out on your WEDDING REHEARSAL, you muppet?”
“Gotcha. Well, I’m going to take a look under the hood to see what’s happening. But before that… Wait here”, he said, leaving through a door on his right.

from Howard himself. Margaret, however, heard none of it, too enthralled by the baby in her arms to pay attention to anything else.

Morgan immediately raised her head at the word ‘cookies’. She turned around and, using Steve as her support, got herself up. She looked at her feet and then took a shaky step forward.
“No! Don’t winkle my dress, uncle Buck!”
itsy bitsy chapter for you guys. Are you guys quarantined as well? We have "voluntary isolation" in my country right now, but it's pretty much the same thing. I had to stop working because of it so it's been a struggle, especially to pay the bills. I hope you guys are all okay! Stay safe, stay home and wash your hands as if Justin Hammer just kissed them!
―, and he took a relieved breath when all the man took out of the bag were small pieces of paper. Photos, as he discovered when Dr. Beesly gave them to him.
“You sure? Some of us are going out for drinks in a few. You should come with us”, she offered with a gentle smile.
“I had a great time. Thank you”.
“Hi”, he whispered, “I’ve been coming here every day, waiting for you to come out”.
“Just wait here”.
“Hold on. His name is Bucky?”
“I’m aware, Mr. Stark”, the doctor said, once more looking around with fear in his eyes, “I came upon these photos thanks to a reporter who has been investigating this situation. But I can tell you, it is not the first time something like this has come to my attention”.
“That’s real funny, but I actually meant the dating part”.
Steve shrugged and, with a final kiss to her temple, put Morgan down so Tony could tie his tie.
“I would like a dance, Man of Iron. As you know, since my Jane left me, I have not had the pleasure of dancing with anyone. I very much enjoy this activity and know you enjoy it as well”.
First, there was Private Johnson. Good kid, good soldier. He was an overall happy person, his roommates said. Funny, optimistic, always making sure everyone was okay. Which was why it was so weird when Private Smith found him in his room one morning, a gun still on his hand and pieces of his brain mixed in with the blood that covered his once white sheets. Suicide, they had ruled. Strange, but not impossible, after all, the secrecy and isolation required for this mission could take a dangerous toll on some of the more weak minded soldiers. So they sent his body back, gave his family enough money to make sure they’d keep quiet and simply moved on.
“I know how much you hate when people keep interrupting us. I thought maybe we could have the whole night for ourselves”.
“Do you really like her?” his mouth moved and the words that came out of it surprised Tony, who didn’t even notice he talked until he heard his own voice reaching his ears.
building knew something”, Clint whispered to Natasha.
“Yep”.
“That’s a possibility too, but… You know, I didn’t really want to give myself hope before but Steve had flirted with me a few times, so maybe they’re both unhappy and they need a way out!”
Steve and Bucky had the decency to look sheepish.
“Tony thought I was proposing. He thought I was giving him a ring and it was just a stupid watch”.
his Tony and
Clint, Steve and Bucky stared at each other.
I'm incredibly sorry about the delay, guys! I'll try to update this fic more frequently now, since it's almost done! lol Thank you for all your kind comments on the previous chapters and I hope you can leave me some more nice comments on this one! (; Have a nice week, everyone!
"I want my damn phone call".
“Call Sam. He’ll do it”, Natasha replied, looking at her own cell phone, “We also need flowers and a caterer”.
Toomes looked down at his glass before drinking all of it in one go and sat down on the couch in front of Jessica, looking defeated.
“Steve, I know you and Bucky were never together. I know Bucky and Natasha are the ones dating. And I knew you were lying”.
Steve and Tony talk about their feelings and Team SHIELD discovers a few things.
“I told Clint and Sam to invite some people, to pretend to be our friends and family”.
And all Tony wanted to do was scream.
“So, we make Steve jealous. That’s the plan. Okay. How do we do that, though?”
“He’s amazing, actually”, Steve replied, unable to keep himself from smiling. He looked up and frowned when he noticed the serious look on his best friend’s face, “what?”
, she warned.
Pepper sighed on the other end of the line and Tony could almost hear the smile in her voice.
The gang makes plans to get Tony his life back.
Everyone turned abruptly to see a dragon-like person, eyes as red as blood, and a mouth full of very sharp looking teeth. They all immediately got up, stepping away from the beast with gasps and yelps of terror.
overprotective and how he was absolutely terrified that they would somehow manage to scare the mechanic away. At the time, Tony had reassured Steve time and again that there was no way in hell anyone would be able to scare him away. And he had firmly believed that because nothing in this world could be worse than the life he’d led before coming to NY. So, when the day arrived, Tony put on his rich boy mask, the one he hadn’t used since his last encounter with Ty a good year ago, and got ready to face wherever Steve’s friends could throw at him. The thing is… He was expecting something else entirely.
