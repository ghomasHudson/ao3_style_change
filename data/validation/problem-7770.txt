It was different from last time, from the beginning. They had come a long way.
“I made a mistake, but it was never because I didn’t trust you. You always kept your end of the bargain. I haven’t been so great at that,” Steve said quietly. “But I’d like to do better, to try and show you that I was serious about what I said, if you’d let me.”
“What are you talking about?” Steve asked all of them, baffled. He turned to Patsy. “Three weeks?”
Tony laughed, a rusty, jarring sound that scraped his insides bloody. Darkness bled across his vision and he tumbled into it headfirst, falling and falling, in a dizzying descent with no end.
When he has enough composure to continue, his voice trembles with shaky reproach and regret, with the loss of everything—of Tony, their friends, his home, his purpose, billions of innocents, of everything—he had to endure.
It was stupid. He knew that Steve wouldn’t hurt him, not like that. Not now, at least, and even back then, Steve had done it to stop him. Because the only clear thought in all the muddled confusion and heartache, the relentless rush of rage howling through his mind, had been to hurt Steve, to pummel him into the ground, to take Barnes away from him so that he would know what it was like to watch his family, watch someone he loved, being hurt in front of him like Tony did.
think
A permanent reminder branded on Steve so that he could never forget, a mark of punishment and shame that would never fade even as time marched on, as new as the day he had gotten it.
, he thought because there was nothing else but this, his entire universe, bright and glorious and full of hope, existing just in Tony’s eyes.
“Could’ve, should’ve, would’ve if we weren’t both idiots. We were a match made in heaven,” Tony said. “Anyway, we had one really good one, right? And years of being friends before that.”
“You’re running yourself to the ground. You need to get some rest even if it’s for a few minutes.”
His soulmate’s…
“I lost track of time,” Tony said except that wasn’t entirely true. He hadn’t set out with an end time in mind; he was just going to go until he exhausted himself or stopped feeling so jittery.
And for the first time, Tony understood the depths to that truth, the profound, limitless eternity of it.
Imagine that.
“I know. I’m sorry. And I know that it wasn’t my secret to keep and that there’s no excuse, but I did it because I was afraid I’d lose you, Tony. And I didn’t want that.” He smiled thinly, his mouth crooked in a bitter, jagged line. “Like I said, I did it for me.”
“Uh,” he said for the second time in minutes.
Tony is, most likely, a ghost speaking from the past. Natasha tries very hard not to think of his body floating in space, an empty and abandoned corpse devoid of his spark.
“Didn’t expect to see you in the gym this early,” Steve said. “You’re usually in the lab.”
He had waited too long again, and a part of him wondered whether he had done it out of respect or cowardice.
“I’m going to remember that the next time you disagree with my tactics in the field.” He clenched his hands, reveling in how perfectly tight the bandages felt around them. The pain from the contusions was muffled under them, and he could still move his fingers. “I’m good. Thanks.” He paused before adding, “You didn’t have to do this, you know.”
, he had thought only minutes before. He elected to go for the truth; Steve had opened up to him, and he never did that. Tony could understand the urge not to even if his didn’t come from an entirely self-sacrificial place like Steve’s. He set the apple down and kept his hand there, a foot away from Steve’s, kept calm and kept from fidgeting. “Hard to imagine anything can hurt me after everything. And yet,” he said, smiling humorlessly.
“Not going anywhere. Not leaving you,” Steve breathed out. He turned his hand over so that he was holding Tony’s and squeezed, but his gaze grew dull, his eyes losing focus. After one last heavy blink, they remained closed.
He had stayed in the shower long after Bucky’s remains had washed down the drain.
Steve seemed to take that as affirmation, nodding once as if he had expected it before looking at Tony again. “I do mean it, though,” he said. “I want you to know that.”
Steve paused, bowing his head, and Tony knew his blow had landed, four sharp hooks gouged into Steve’s skin, ready to slice his back open the moment he took a step away from him.
He brought up a bandaged hand to wrap around Steve’s arm instead. Steve leaned in, pliant under his tentative touch, and wonder and the beginning of something else bloomed inside of him as Steve let him draw him close, as all of Steve’s fatigued tension fell away under his caress.
There’s no answer they can give. There’s nothing they can do.
And yet.
He settled on his wish after a moment, committing every atom of himself to the seed of that idea, believing in it, hoping for it.
They were losing badly.
“C’mon. Let me treat you to breakfast. It’s the least I can do.”
Tony scrambled out of the building, tripping over the pillar in his haste. Concrete rushed to meet him and he shot his hand out to break his fall.
Steve faced him. For the first time since they met, Tony thought Steve showed all of his hundred years.
He bent forward so that their foreheads touched, bringing Steve’s wrist to his heart with his left hand and putting the Gauntlet on his right, never once letting go.
The last time they spoke, he had lashed out at her, an ancient distrust that she had worked so hard to break down rising up to the surface in an instant.
“Tony, I don’t even know what that is besides that it’s obviously cheese.”
Natasha sees but doesn’t comprehend. None of them do.
a teen. She has to be a little annoying. I say so as your resident expert on spoiled rich kids. Not to mention, I saw her troll her poor, unsuspecting brother in front of the Dora. She and Peter are going to get on like—ouch!” Rhodey had dug his elbow into his ribs and given him a look. “Okay, sorry. Sorry. No joking about princesses, got it. She’s not annoying."
“You’re gonna want to clean this. Come on.”
And they would reply, “So was I.”
Tony had been prepared for the situation and knew that despite the measures they put into place, there would be huge casualties, destruction on a scale that he had never seen before. Still, it was daunting and left him scrambling, feeling like everything was spinning out of control.
Jim directs FRIDAY to play Tony’s video immediately. His calm authority, so different from Steve’s fragile calmness as he asks if this is an old message, reminds her that Jim led the search for Tony a decade ago and refused to give up long after Tony’s chances of survival dwindled to almost zero and there were no signs of Tony still being alive.
“I thought you’d be the kind of guy to warm things up before prep,” Tony shot off his mouth because never mind what he had thought before; this was too much too fast, and Steve was going to break him down treating him like this until there was nothing left if he didn’t prevent him from doing so.
This wasn’t any kind of life he wanted for Tony, utterly alone in a town where nothing ever happened except when he visited. Tony was movement and color, was life itself, and all Steve ever wanted was for him to be himself completely again, not a half-shade of who he was.
He observed Thanos raising the Gauntlet to the sky before swinging it down to take out a fleet of massive tanks in one go.
There was nothing left for him here except ghosts, and not even that anymore, he thought as he swung a leg over the seat and started the bike. The engine roared to life underneath him, and as he drove away, choosing to look up and ahead at the stars silent above him rather than back, he thought he could see one shine bigger and brighter than the others. Tony would be there, exploring the whole universe like he was supposed to—like Steve wanted him to.
No. That isn’t right.
“You need your hands to work,” he had said, and there was a meaning there that Tony couldn’t interpret but wanted to study up close so he could, one day.
But at some point, an oppressive hush had fallen outside the shelter, blanketing the world in a terrible, too-still silence.
This was not going the way Steve had expected. He had seen Tony flustered before, but he was always able to cover it up quickly, either by appearing cool and collected or by managing to divert everyone’s attention while he tried to recover. He had never seen Tony like this.
Pepper flies in straight from Tennessee as soon as they tell her what Tony left them and Thor sends Carol to the coordinates Tony gave. They argue whether they should, if it’s crueler to get her hopes up when they might fail or to let her continue thinking there’s no way to reach him, alive or dead. They choose to tell her but feel stupid when they do. Of course Tony would have left her a message.
Steve put his hands over Tony’s, stilling them. “I’m here. I promise.” It was the first sign of fire that Tony saw in him since he had found him slumped against the rubble. His eyes were clear even as he struggled to breathe, intense in their focus. “Put on the Gauntlet. You can end this.”
Briefly, Tony considered lying, of veering the conversation away from Steve, but there wasn’t any point of doing so. He was at Steve’s desk, the phone in plain sight and the letter open on his lap.
Steve was chatting with Rhodey and Natasha at the other end of the room, but as soon as Tony entered, he broke off and glanced at the door as though he were psychically attuned to Tony’s whereabouts.
Several of the Chitauri had noticed their noisy arrival and had started to descend on them. Steve held out his shield and Tony blasted it with a repulsor, the beam taking out the closest lines. A few remaining soldiers skittered back, but the majority swarmed in, stepping over the fallen without hesitation.
She feels like an intruder.
Natasha doesn’t have an answer, only an understanding that she can’t put into words. She opts to hold his hand instead, the one curled over the phone, as though she can hold onto Tony with Steve and pull Tony back in from whatever place he’s lost in.
Rhodey snorted.
This was Steve staying for him. This was Steve choosing him.
Sam. James. Wanda. Vision. T’Challa.
Tony’s careworn heart skipped a beat and lurched into overdrive, each overtaxed pulse piercing his chest like leftover shrapnel. Everything was too bright, too sharp, and the light cleaved his head in half, jabbing his overly sensitive eyes. Someone said something that resembled his name from close by, but it was muffled as though he were underwater, and he couldn’t tell where it came from.
It wasn’t even about Steve. Once he entered the room, all eyes would be on him.
But it was futile, trying to provide assurance. Cold comfort. He knew how Tony felt even though it was irrational. Thanos would have called the culling fair and objective, but it wasn’t. Not when he had cheated death time and time again, not when he always survived and others didn’t, and not when Sam and Bucky and T’Challa, Wanda and Vision, and all those who had died hadn’t had a chance.
“You wouldn’t. That’s not why I didn’t tell you about Bucky and your parents if that’s what you’re thinking.” Steve sank onto his bed, resting his arms against his knees. “I thought about telling you more times than I could count, but every time, I’d imagine how you’d look like when I did, and I couldn’t…I couldn’t bring myself to hurt you. I didn’t want to reopen an old wound, not when I didn’t have to.” He studied the floor, then his palms as though there were hidden answers there. “I thought that maybe if I got there in time and fixed things on my own, no one would have to know,” he said after a moment.
, but he was invested. They had spent the last of their change, and they were going to see it through even if the station stank like shit and only moments before, he had seen a fat rat clamber up the stairs from the tracks to the end of the platform before scampering back down again, abandoning the forlorn bag of chips that someone had dropped after discovering it only held crumbs.
As Tony continued to cry silently, speechless for once, Steve thought they understood each other better than they had ever thought they would.
He had sat on the bed, after, calcifying in blood and dirt and ash. Had listened to the steady stream of water pouring down in the shower, not feeling guilty about the waste, not feeling anything, before he eventually got up and washed off half an hour later.
“Be safe, Steve,” he said because that was allowed. A benediction, not a promise.
Soul marks.
“Sounds painful,” Bucky said, wincing, and Steve wanted to blurt out that no, it hadn’t been when it wasn't true. It
“That wasn’t your call to make. You can’t decide things like that for me,” Tony replied tightly.
He was Tony’s, which meant—which had to mean—that Tony was his. His happiness was Tony’s happiness. His pain was Tony’s pain. His love was Tony’s. His body, Tony’s.
His wrist was smooth and untouched, his mark just as dark and crisp as it had been the night he had gotten it.
They were nothing to Thanos.
Maybe he had to go smaller. Rearrange things and erase his and Steve’s words. Rearrange things so that he didn’t love Steve.
“I’m glad you’re not hurt,” Steve said, and Tony was stuck between replying in kind and wanting to punch him.
The video blinked out, a black screen replacing Thor and his colorful team. Thor’s news didn’t come as a surprise as they had long suspected that the Power Stone would be one of Thanos’s first targets due to its proximity and known whereabouts, but it was the speed that was shocking. Thor was right. They had to act quickly and, as plans mutated with every battle, make decisions on the fly with precision, a hard thing to do due to the scope of the war and number of players involved and made all the more difficult when any wrong move could have catastrophic consequences.
“Steve,” he said, his voice tight with panic.
Tony’s jaw dropped. “Wait, that’s why you’ve been acting weird lately? You paid that much money because you wanted a date with me?”
As if he cared.
, he thought, but he couldn’t peel his fingers off of his wrist even so.
They weren’t out of the woods yet. They had to gain as much distance as possible from Thanos and the Order, and a few foreboding signs were already flashing on his HUD.
Tony laughed brightly. “Sure does.”
He couldn’t say the same for Steve’s words; whatever they were, he had meant everything he had said. But even so, Steve would be holding onto something that he wasn’t sure he could give Steve anymore.
Around the world, around every known and unknown corner of the universe, this is all anyone will find. A death toll that rises and will continue to rise—billions and trillions and higher still—untold numbers both horrifying and meaningless in their enormity.
“Listen up, everyone,” he said grimly. “I’ve got a plan.”
“Yeah? Got any good stories to tell?” Tony sat down on the grass, gesturing at Steve to do the same. “Big ragers, nasty hangovers...” A leaf fell gently into his lap, and his words tapered off. He moved to cradle it in his palms before he looked up at the trees, still mostly in their summer dresses although bursts of red and orange had started to bloom amongst the verdant green. His gaze sharpened as though he were seeing his surroundings for the first time. “It’s too early for you to be back. Why—”
But it’s not the right question to ask, when Steve already answered it somewhere along the way even if she can’t pinpoint exactly when.
“Must have thought it was stupid to keep trying, huh?”
She’s not sorry for who she is and what she did, but she is sorry that everything she worked hard to repair was gone just like that with one decision. She repaid Steve’s belief in her since their days in D.C. She didn’t do that for Tony, not nearly enough if he thought she was double-crossing him when it wasn’t about choosing sides.
, she tells Tony in her head like he can hear her,
“This feels like Afghanistan all over again. We’re just missing takeout from Dynasty Kitchen.” She smiles humorlessly at the bottle of beer, picking it up and rubbing the ridges of the cap but not popping it off.
“So was I,” he said, watching as Steve broke out into a wide smile full of wonder. “So am I."
He supposed that was why he let Steve examine his hands. They both spent long hours in the lab and gym on bad nights. Some days, he would walk by on the way back up to his floor and see Steve by himself in the large gym, lifting heavier weights than even the strongest man in the world could hold or sprinting at full speed, the way he couldn’t on the streets or at the park.
“Hey, handsome. Fancy seeing you here,” Tony said. He spoke casually, almost lazily, but his eyes were bright and alert with happiness.
“You look good,” Natasha said. “Relatively speaking.” It would almost be funny the way that she and Steve scrutinized every change, every injury in sync like an unsettling pair of overly observant blond twins, if it weren’t for how it made his skin crawl.
Tony could feel the weight of Steve’s eyes; he hadn’t looked away from Tony once since he had asked the question. He concentrated on his hand instead of returning Steve’s gaze, on keeping it flat and unmoving against the table.
“Let’s run away,” he said quietly.
was real. This moment was real. Steve, solid and warm under his hands, was real.
, he read under the street lights blinking on in the velvet evening. He ran his thumb reverently over his wrist, thinking about how, out of the hundreds of millions of people in the world, the two of them were somehow chosen to be destined for each other. He felt small and significant at once, set apart from the rest of the world even with rows of cramped apartment buildings sandwiching him on both sides and people milling about on the street. He was separate and singular—alone—but he had never felt less lonely than he did in that moment.
There was no sight more beautiful than the one in front of him. Midtown was in shambles, and Tony was in love.
Steve nodded at his group, hanging back as they climbed into the Quinjet. He was waiting for something.
Something shifted in the air, atoms coming apart and rearranging almost imperceptibly, and he heard Tony suck in a shaky breath.
But as they looked at each other, Steve couldn’t help but think about the years lost and the years that they would never have.
Steve would discover new things about Tony every day the way he would this city. Another layer of paint to coat the canvas he had known. Another to peel away and reveal history that had never fully disappeared but had just been out of sight. Never changing and changing all the time, familiar and new all at once. A patchwork of contradictions that came together to make one complicated but cohesive whole, a place where past and future rendezvoused, where his New York and Tony’s coexisted.
“No, Tones has a thing for kids who are too smart for their own good.” He glances at the untouched beer before adding, lightly like it’s a joke and lightly like he’s afraid of hurting her, “I wonder why.”
, he registered as its fragrance reached him. It was spring. Nature moved on, indifferent to all death and destruction, catkins hanging heavily from branches and the flowers that Wanda had left behind beginning to unfurl their buds.
The sun was almost completely gone now. The world was in monochrome, everything awash in shades of blue and black, and Tony’s face was shadowed. For the first time Steve had known him like this, he looked distant, unreal, a part of the past Steve couldn’t reach.
There was a question hanging off of the end of Steve’s words. Even if he was careful not to probe, he stripped Tony bare.
An everything that amounted to nothing, Tony thought, numbers multiplied by zero.
The lands shifted below him, tens of thousands of feet away, but this high up where the movement was imperceptible, he was fixed in limbo, white space stretching infinitely in every direction, his thoughts on a numbing loop.
Steve curled his fingers over them, stilling them. “Me too,” he said. His hand felt warm and clean, reassuringly solid over Tony’s. Protective.
, and if Steve had never said his word, Tony thought furiously and hopelessly, if he hadn’t realized it had been his word, then he wouldn’t have let—
He was fine with that. Not caring meant not hurting which meant no distractions, and he needed to be as focused as possible. There were things to take care of. Laws to amend, teenage spiderlings to mentor, inventions to be made. He needed to fix Rhodey’s legs, he needed to fight off Ross, he needed to do something about the Raft, he needed to improve BARF. He needed to make his suit more impenetrable. He needed to prepare the world for intergalactic threats.
—and it was more beautiful than anything he had ever seen. All the doubt he had had disappeared in a flash, leaving him defenseless against a wave of awe and joy that pulled him under so quickly, he was drowning before he could think of bracing himself.
The wrong voice.
“Probably because I wasn’t what you were expecting.”
His muscles were tensed as though he anticipated a fight, his breathing erratic. He hated the way that Steve always got under his skin and made him act like this, much as he tried not to show Steve how much he got to him. He wondered if this was what Steve came for, if that was the only way Steve remembered how to act around him. He didn’t want to deal with this.
who were bidding on him because some surprising bidders had come forward, and Steve…hadn’t been able to handle that.
He could leave everything untouched. Avoid the common area. Keep the doors to all the rooms closed. But that was like gingerly picking his way across a minefield; it didn’t change the fact that those bombs were still there, liable to explode in his face at the slightest provocation unless he defused them all by the time he saw Steve again.
“How?” she asks.
She allows herself to skim the nape of his neck, near the spot where she stabbed him, even though she’s been careful about touching him since that moment in the diner nearly a decade ago. Linking arms was okay. Touching his shoulder when he knew she was there was too. Gestures that are carefully and loudly telegraphed but nothing more intimate than that.
His stomach flipped as he took in his soulmate’s untidy scrawl. It was dark and impossible to hide—
Steve looked him full in the eye, his gaze never once wavering even as he clenched his jaw, eyes wet.
Altogether it happened in less than a second, but time seemed to stretch indefinitely even as it sped by too quickly, slipping out of his grasp even as he desperately wanted it back. Between the time that he had tossed Tony’s faceplate to the side and had swung down his shield, Tony’s words from earlier came to mind, an unbidden whisper strong enough to have brought him to his knees had he not been on them already.
“I can’t believe this.” Tony huffed out a laugh, changing tack, but his eyes still retained an unsettling blankness to them that Steve didn’t like. “I thought I’d be the one regaling you with tales of the wild college life, not the other way around.”
, a voice whispered in his head.
Tony used to say sorry or try to explain himself in the face of Steve’s ire because he wanted Steve by his side through everything. Loved him through everything. Steve knew that. Had proof of it even if they had never spoken about it. Steve’s lungs had stayed spotless through all their disagreements, through the fight over the SHRA, as healthy as they had been ever since he got the serum, and he had cursed himself for it, despaired over it, and then been thankful for it, that his love for Tony had never left him. If there were no flowers, Tony wasn’t out of reach. There was hope for them yet, however much it dwindled day by day as they remained divided, until he had forgotten what the absence of flowers meant because absence was so easy to overlook.
Thirty hours without sleep and Tony had been about to shake out of his skin. It was as if he had been stretched out, his body taut for hours with stress and unease until he snapped, and he had vibrated, vibrated, vibrated, little more than a blur, moving so fast and with such force that he was going to tremble past the lines of his body, fracturing them, uncontained and near invisible because of the strength and speed of his trembling. He was a buzz in physical form, the sound of it, the sensation of it, the movement—he was an intersection of shifting black strokes scribbled one on top of the other, dark, violent, and loud.
Theirs—because “You’re this city,” Tony once told him, and that was what Tony was to him too. That was the only way Steve could aptly describe him, someone so impossible to capture whole in an entire poem, an entire story, let alone a few short words.
Fire ran through Steve untempered, frothing, volcanic blood incinerating everything in its path: his veins, his muscles, everything he had felt for Tony. All had burned away and the little that remained had liquefied, melted into his rage, so that he was no longer himself, only that beastly anger.
He knocked his shoulder against Rhodey’s.
What came out when he shut off the faucet and dried off his hands with the towel that Steve handed him was this: “You gonna patch me up, Doc?”
“I didn’t. I don’t know what’s wrong with it,” Steve replied. He moved his arm away from himself gingerly, careful not to jar it in any way, before freezing. Black ink peeked out from under his thumb, stark against his fair skin.
“No,” Tony croaked as he stumbled forward. His legs were clumsy and uncoordinated under him. “No.”
It’s all wrong.
“You know me so well,” Steve said dryly, but he was grinning widely. He had been worried throughout the entire ride over that too much time had passed and too much had changed between them after they had gone their separate ways, but it was easy talking to Tony, as if nothing had changed since high school.
But he didn’t.
He’s talking and she should concentrate, but all she can focus on is the limitless darkness beyond him that she’s only seen once before. The same desperation that she felt back when she craned her neck and stared at the wormhole years ago, urging Tony to come back so she wouldn’t have to do what needed to be done, lights every single one of her nerves on fire. She feels like she condemned him to his fate again, making the call to leave him to die, leaving him no choice but to go into space alone once more.
he begged, though to whom he didn’t know. In the tranquility of the small hours and snow-buried street, they were the only two people in the world.
Steve swallowed, hard. “No, they’re not.” He spoke slowly as though every word brought him pain. “Even if they weren’t mine, they wouldn’t be.” Tony wanted to ask what he meant, but the question sat on his tongue, leaden and unwanted; he settled for watching Steve gather himself. “I know this is a lot,” he added softly. “But I’m not saying it because I expect something from you. I just wanted you to know.”
“We had a good run,” Tony said quietly, and Steve wondered whether Tony knew what he had come to do and whether he would do it before he himself did. He wondered if Tony would be upset.
He wrenched himself away from the image, his mind taking a jerky turn and speeding off course across uneven ground until a replacement brought him to a halt.
Steve reached out as Tony picked up another swatch before putting it back down and snatching another one, stroking the curve of Tony’s cheek with the back of his hand. He didn’t like seeing Tony like this.
Ten ships down. Ten huge ships manned by some of the best pilots in the intergalactic military.
, he reminded himself.
Rhodey’s mouth was set in a grim line.
He didn’t know what he deserved.
Part of him wondered if Tony had done it out of fear or anger. Out of pain.
“See you,” he whispered, though he knew he wouldn’t get an answer.
In her mind, Tony faces all of the deaths he wasn’t supposed to come back from but did—Afghanistan and palladium poisoning and the wormhole.
Tony.
“I know what I’m gonna do. Gonna kick Captain Asshole’s ass to Wakanda and back when I see him again. But whatever you gotta do, Tones, I have your back. You know I always do.”
He knew that in all likelihood, his soulmate had passed away years ago and that even if they hadn't, he had left them behind, been absent all the years that they had needed him. He knew that some people moved on after their soulmates died, that some settled for others when they figured that they would most likely never find their soulmates.
And he was, even with the grief inside him that he knew he’d carry forever.
Steve hadn’t told him his secret because he wasn’t sure how Tony would respond, but Tony couldn’t because he wasn’t sure what his response would be to Steve’s. It would be unfair to bring it up, pointless in a different way. Steve wanted him, maybe even thought he loved him because Tony was his soulmate. All telling him would accomplish would be to give him false hope when he wasn’t sure he would be able to give Steve what he wanted.
“As a bargain for my life,” Thor had explained brokenly, turned away from the screen, bitterness and grief wearing lines into his face.
“I know,” Steve told him, tears warm against his cheeks. “I know.”
“And that’s what counts, right?” Tony added. “That we had all the time we did get.”
What had he known about loss? What did the loss of his relationship with Tony matter in the face of losing Tony entirely?
She doesn’t understand why she asks. Steve faced everything straight on except matters that would force him to reexamine his relationship with Tony or put it in jeopardy. But maybe that said everything.
Peggy’s hand was warm where it was curled around his wrist. She was the only person he had ever allowed to get close to his soulmate’s words like that and the only one who had seen them aside from his mother, Bucky, Dr. Erskine, and Howard, all of whom were long gone.
He faced the window, and Tony followed his gaze. The others were gone. The sun was low in the sky, the grounds tranquil and undisturbed. Years ago, when the original team had been together, he had caught Steve doing the same thing at the tower. His fingers had traced a pattern across the glass as if he were superimposing his city over the one in front of him, trying to excavate familiar lines from under the sweeping sprawl that had grown over his home. Tony wondered if he was doing that now, pulling forth a memory, sliding a transparency over the window.
“What’s that you got there, Cap? A love letter from Carter?”
They could have had each other was the thing. But Steve never thought he had a chance with Tony and didn’t even walk up to the starting line, and Tony never thought Steve would want a chance and didn’t even give him one.
“I mean it,” he said once he broke off the kiss. He leaned his forehead against Tony’s. “I don’t need much. If you want a wedding, then we’ll have one, but it doesn’t have to be extravagant. It can be simple.”
“Uh,” he managed to say intelligently, the strong stench permeating every inch of his room and apparently his brain so that he couldn’t think of anything other than “Big cheese in room. Why?”
There is no victory.
“Oh, Shellhead,” she nearly sighs, but he’s speaking now and none of them want to talk over him.
Just once so he would be able to give them everything.
He never knew the city could be like this. Peaceful despite the battle that had broken out in the early Sunday morning. Beautiful even at its most congested, most hideous heart. It felt like some other place this high up, some place that only belonged to him. His and no one else’s.
An awkward pause ensued where no one was quite sure where to look. Tony had to nip this in the bud before they started talking about things he would rather not deal with. At least not tonight.
He couldn’t be sure either way, he told himself, not when he had so little to go on. Just six letters in total—nothing like Bucky’s mark, eight words in two rows across his wrist, a dark band nearly an inch thick.
, he thought drowsily, and then
A violation for a violation then, that’s what he wanted. It was only right. It was only fair, when he had been reduced to this, was bleeding like this.
, he wanted to say again, but he didn’t think either of them would believe it.
Tony was a harmless flirt, Natasha had said. He flirted with everything that breathed because it was safe, never meaning anything by it or expecting anything to come from it. He always got flustered when it was reciprocated.
Together, he thought, and maybe that word was his to make his own, to be whatever he wanted to make of it. Raw material that he had at his disposal to create something new.
He rubbed his thumb across Tony’s knuckles before letting go. He was still smiling and now that he wasn’t about to shake out of his skin, Tony noticed for the first time the shadows crescented under Steve’s eyes.
His word had always been his cure and now that it was ripped away, all his scars, all the marks that life had left on him, split open again. Every memory was now a gaping wound, countless cuts, countless contusions and burns and broken bones slicing him, mottling him, distorting him, as he sifted through his memories, losing more of himself as he swam through time into the deeper currents of his mind.
Tony watched as Steve dropped the shield and walked on, not looking back once.
“Fly safe, Tony,” he said softly, and with a smile, he rode out of town, out onto the highway again and into the quiet night, the skies and the road open in front of him, towards Brooklyn and the future.
“Okay,” Tony said, dazed, “you can have it then.”
Steve didn’t answer even as the seconds trickled by excruciatingly slow, every second an uncomfortable weight stacked on Tony’s back, trying to bend it forward.
He had always been able to get under Steve’s skin from the very beginning.
Steve was careful anyway, rubbing slow circles before he let go and took care of Tony’s other hand. He grabbed the bandages he left on the sink counter, unrolling them and tearing off two long strips, winding them firmly but gently around Tony’s hands.
“I know how to handle a little scrape, Rogers,” Tony replied, but he was more amused than offended by Steve’s motherhenning as he followed him to the door. He did have to tend to his hands anyway. They would be in bad shape otherwise. Already, all the pain that he had blocked while pummeling the bag rushed back now that he was no longer zoned out, and his hands were hot and throbbed long after he stopped moving.
But Steve didn’t look angry. There was no fight in him, only Tony. “Okay,” he said agreeably, and Tony didn’t know what to do with the energy pent up inside him with nowhere to go.
, he thought, watching himself in Afghanistan, shaking, sweating, delirious from cold and fear and agony, pretending his soulmate was lying with him on the cot, holding him, reassuring him.
Tony glanced over his shoulder. Through the entrance, he could see Steve taking out four opponents, five. Six. Steve was fine. Whereas he had been starting to flag before they had seized the Gauntlet, he was a man made anew by hope and fury.
, Steve thought, not for the first time.
Steve flinched, his hand automatically going to his wrist before he was able to fully stop himself, and he knew what Steve's answer was whether he said it or not. Everything.
His name sounded intimate on Steve’s tongue. Private. There was a weight to it, a carefulness to the way it was spoken, as though it were a secret Steve had been protecting for these past years, holding it inside him until finally, he decided it was safe to let it go.
“I didn’t want to hurt you. I still don’t,” Steve said. “And I won’t ever hurt you like that again.”
“That’s right,” Jim agrees. “Now let’s help him come home.”
“You too, Tony,” he said. And against his lips, lower but more fervent: “Godspeed.”
Grab hold of him and not let go.
That’s what he was to Tony when he couldn’t make Tony mean nothing to him even if he tried.
Here was Bryant Park, a small, green postage stamp he could collect in his pocket. Here was the Chrysler Building and its majestic crown, close enough that it was on private display just for him. A little down the way to his side was Times Square, effervescently and unapologetically neon at all hours. And even farther, avenues away, beyond the industrial plainness of the Garment District, the Hudson, the railcar yard. On the street there, or even as far from it as Penn Station, he could see the white wing of a seagull boomeranging through the sky if he looked up, could hear the seagull’s searching call. It brought Brighton Beach to him here in Manhattan when he needed it, when he missed home and the Fourth of July with his mom and the Barnes, Bucky making eyes at Betty or Ruth or the new girl from two streets down, Bucky’s sisters shrieking as they sprinted down the shore, the waves lapping the soles of their feet a shocking reminder of winter.
He could cure cancer.
Tony simply blew the hinges off of the doors.
“You could’ve just asked me for a date, you know,” Tony continued, completely unaware of Steve’s internal crisis. He was still smiling—but there had been a subtle undercurrent of nervousness below the surface of his words too, taut as invisible wire, making him sound less flirty than shy and making Steve recall a conversation that he had overheard some time ago.
Natasha thinks, incongruously, of the empty compound grounds, of Avengers Tower, the mansion in Malibu, and the old Stark mansion on Long Island. She thinks of the large expanse of them all and of the darkness of space, Tony in the middle of it, alone and as small as he is now, and the spell breaks.
, it shouted.
“And you? Anyone on your tail?”
And although this had been the reason he had come out here and he didn’t want Tony to stay, “You sure?” Steve asked.
The video’s a day old.
“I want you to know that I didn’t want any of it to happen the way it did. I didn’t mean to hurt you.”
Steve might not be there when he needed him, but if the world was in danger, that was a different story. Not that he had the power to do much, on the lam halfway across the world. Tony guessed it was the thought that counted, but he couldn’t bring himself to believe it; he had learned his lesson—words didn’t mean anything unless they were backed up by action.
Dispensable.
In her mind, he’s off to the side as she and the others take in Avengers Tower for the first time, too deliberately casual to be anything but as he floats the idea of forming the Avengers again.
, his father scoffed in his head, and Tony thought of how Howard had reacted when he had come home and found out that his son’s words had come in.
“In case of emergencies,” Tony said, and it came out more caustic than he had assumed it would. “He said if I ever need him, he’d be there. No matter what,” he added flatly at Rhodey’s sharp expression.
There were no victories in his dreams, no happy endings.
Now, punching the heavy bag and feeling each blow detonate inside of him, defusing every one of his tremors, he felt less like he was going to break free of his body and more like he was collapsing; he was still shivering, but he was weak, all of his bones turned watery.
There was an opening. It could be a long shot, a risky one especially as the margin for error was slim, but if they could get in right as soon as Thanos powered up the Gauntlet, if there was an all-out effort to distract him and hold him off at that exact moment, then maybe, just maybe, for the briefest of seconds the Gauntlet would be vulnerable and there for the taking.
Their home had cracks. Parts of it had crumbled and caved in. But they had rebuilt it once before, and Tony knew they could do it again.
The phone sat in his palm, blockish and crude as a brick and just as useless. There was no point in keeping it.
“Steve,” Jan said slowly, “what did you think you were bidding on?”
“Is it true?” he asked. “What Natasha said.”
The ground around Steve glistened with dark red pools, and a large, wicked slash cut diagonally across his abdomen, threads of the shredded uniform sticking to it. Blood poured out of the laceration steadily and profusely.
Steve wondered how long it took for Tony to scrub the kid’s ashes from his skin. If part of him had refused to do that at first, to get every last bit of him out from underneath his fingernails, because it was all he had left of him.
“Hey. Stay with me,” Tony pleaded. “You have to stay with me, okay?” He cupped Steve’s face in his hands, stroking the curve of his cheek.
Steve sucks in a breath, and she zeroes in on him again as she retreats to the safety of her question, on Steve’s emotions rather than her own.
Bucky turned, zeroing in on the arm he cradled against his chest. “I knew you hit that ball wrong,” he said. His lips twisted into a displeased pucker.
“Why?” he rasped out.
But this, he knew, this was beyond that. The answer to their prayers rested inches away from their hands.
The video cuts off, Tony visibly exhausted even just from talking as he reaches over to end the recording. He’s shaking, clumsy, bumping the helmet before he finds the switch. The screen turns dark, and the black void leaks out of the screen and into the room. It fills the hardened hollow Thanos left inside of her, tacky and deadly like poisonous sap.
Tony moved away, and Steve let his hand fall to his side as he watched Tony bring up his legs and fold his arms over his knees, resting his chin on them.
“A souvenir,” Steve had teased, eyes sparkling with mirth. In a way, they were both tourists in their own city; New York wasn’t the same place either of them grew up in. It was nice, having dates like this. They got to explore the city together and make their own version of it. His parents’ mansion uptown lay dormant and abandoned, nothing more than a landmark that people occasionally took photos in front of, and there was a museum downtown dedicated to the history and preservation of tenements like the ones that his father and Steve had grown up in. But now the Upper East Side belonged to their first date, an after-hours visit to the Met, and their first kiss, under the arches of the Bethesda Terrace bathed in silvery moonlight. The Lower East Side belonged to dinners at their favorite French restaurant, cozy and tucked away like a charming neighborhood secret, and a long conversation about classic films in Seward Park after a screening at the Metrograph on a frigid January morning.
“No, he has us,” she allows herself to promise.
“Well, don’t mind me. I’m just gonna…” He gestured with the hand holding the apple as though he were going to eat it, not put it back the minute Steve left the room.
And that was the problem right there, he knew. It would be so easy to step back into this, to pretend that things could work out just for a little while. As Tony looked at him, those brown eyes he loved so much so wide and incredibly young, Steve thought about how very easy it would be to forget everything and stay.
A sigh shuddered out of them both, a shared exhale that trembled between them until Tony placed a hand against the blackened star on his chest and it broke, returning to their lungs a ragged sob.
pounded dully in his head over and over again.
But he didn’t think that he could do that. He didn’t
He didn't think it mattered.
He guessed it didn’t matter. They both knew she wasn’t his from the beginning even if they hoped or tried to pretend otherwise.
All that mattered, he wanted to say, was that he had a soulmate. They were out there somewhere waiting for him, words that he would one day say to them tattooed on their skin. That was worth the pain, any pain, ten times over. He had finally gotten his words—and before anyone else did too.
Except for the wounds Tony had inflicted.
Fact number two: There were others.
He smiled, and Steve wondered if he was teasing him or if he meant it because what Steve had done was mortifying, not sweet. He had misread the situation and had rushed into things, thinking Tony needed help when he had been perfectly fine.
he didn’t say.
A thought came to mind, vague and half-formed but with hooks that sank into him so that he could think of nothing else.
They stayed like that, not saying anything and not letting go, sitting together in the too empty room, waiting for dawn to arrive.
But he had known this was a possibility. He had spent days—weeks—after Siberia turning the idea in his head like a pebble in his hand over and over, wearing it down, enough that even as part of him caved in with devastation, a bigger part was tired. Angry.
Steve crossed the room and sat down on the bed next to him. “You can’t blame yourself for something like that. What Thanos did…it was random.”
“I hope I wasn’t interrupting your beauty sleep.”
Pain bound them together, loss, apology, and relief their lingua franca.
He took a moment, taking in every inch of Tony, trying to commit to memory the exact way Tony looked, beautiful and immortal in the dying light of their last day, before holding out his hands, palms up. Tony carefully wrapped his hands around his, making sure not to go through him.
Steve breaks their gaze, something complicated that Natasha can’t decipher crossing his face but Tony can.
Tony bared his teeth. His smile was all wrong.
Natasha realizes that Jim is right. Tony always comes back, and the person who saves him has always been Tony himself. This is his signal flare in the desert, an explosion they have to follow.
He had said it aloud without thinking. Steve was looking at him now, as surprised as he was, as tired as he sometimes looked the few times they had bumped into each other at the tower during the dead hours of the night.
Even as he pretended to survey something beyond the trio, his clammy hands tucked in his pockets, he saw how Steve looked at him from the corner of his eye. There was a tenderness to his expression, and he hated that he recognized it, that it wasn’t something exotic, peculiar, and never-seen-before but something familiar.
Steve came into view.
Here was something that surprised people, that most people didn’t know unless they were from New York themselves: The city could be quiet.
He switched on the comms, sitting on the floor with the Gauntlet to his side. “We’re ready,” he said tightly.
He walked down through Chelsea from there, walked east of the Flatiron Building, walked down until the buildings slouched and shrank and grew old and grimy but more colorful in character, past the college kids crowding into their favorite hole-in-the-wall on St. Mark’s, past Little Italy which had very little Italian in its makeup left and the vibrant markets of Chinatown, and then down and down, going everywhere and nowhere in particular. His mind took him every which way, and it occurred to him only when he roamed far enough that he was looking for something, but he wasn’t sure what until bright fire streaked across the sky and his heart soared at the sight.
That was the first time.
It helped him on the days that he didn’t think that he would live to see the war end.
Tony washed the mug, dried it, and shoved it to the back of a cabinet. Tossed the throw into Steve’s room and didn’t pay attention to the colored pencils Steve had laid out on the desk, the sketchbook he had always been so curious about but never brought up, the first edition copy of
But there was no battle to continue this time, no fight to jump into. Only loss, an unfathomable one for which there were no words, only an unnatural silence that spanned continents, spanned planets, spanned galaxies to the ends of the universe. Half of the universe was gone, the world eerily quiet and vast in their absence.
He stepped to the side to let Sam, who was trying to peek into the room from behind him, get a better view.
They were ash floating—
Steve smiled at him, soft even under the fluorescent bathroom light but not quite happy. Something ached underneath, too muted for Tony to make sense of it. They were still strangers to each other in the end.
Howard hadn’t said anything then, just thinned his lips in sour distaste as he saw Tony’s wrist, but he didn’t need to; his disdain had been palpable, thick and overbearing like the stench of whiskey that remained long after he had left the room. And then he had spit it out later, when he could let loose because Tony's mother wasn’t there to intervene, to shame him into behaving.
If he got to Tony this very second, if he immolated himself with all his grief, all his hope, all his love, all the things that he had kept locked up so as not to fall apart to reach Tony
“I was waiting for you,” he would say.
He couldn’t breathe. Steve’s betrayal sat heavily on his chest, lodged there in the shield’s stead, keeping air from his lungs. He was cracked open, naked. He was shut in, trapped.
It was as though he had been sending out a distress signal all this time, too faint for him to notice until Tony had picked up on it from the depths of space and answered.
Up here, the sounds of the streets dropped away, the tumult not entirely muted (and Steve was glad for that, glad of the reminders that the city wasn’t frozen, that he wasn’t frozen) but removed.
He watched as everyone around him refused to stay down, as they did what they always did, no matter if there didn’t seem to be any way out, no matter if it seemed that all hope was lost. They kept fighting.
He looks too young and too worn at once. He looks like the man he was two years ago, but Natasha can see that he doesn’t feel any more like himself than he did on the run. She doesn’t have to tell him it’s because that person no longer exists. He’s not who he used to be—none of them are after Thanos—but he hasn’t been the same since his fallout with Tony.
Up here, the city could breathe. Could just…be.
“Like he was there when you needed him at your back,” Rhodey scoffed.
“I’ve seen colder,” Tony had said then, and no one had listened until the prophecy came to pass.
“Tony was up there, and he looked uncomfortable,” he said instead of answering Sam’s question, his ears on fire. At this rate, his entire body would be as red as Tony’s armor.
“Someday, someone will choose you, Tony,” she had said, her hands back to cupping his. “And no one, not your father, not anyone, can ever take that from you.”
“He wants you to stay in contact with him?”
“But I want to give you all this.”
The sky ripped open, darkness lying beyond the wound.
It’s so quiet out here. The grass rustles in the breeze, the only perceptible sound for miles, the air rippling through it the only change. Had it not been for how well the grounds have been maintained, the compound would feel abandoned.
The difference is that she remembers as reparation and he as preservation. He had carried his loved ones forward, clutching them to his chest, stepping inside himself and sealing the entrance behind him to keep them and himself safe. He let no one in and let nothing out.
“You can’t blame yourself for seeing the best in your soulmate, Tones.”
“My goal in life,” Steve said, and Bucky cheerfully quipped back a reply as they made their way home again although Steve didn’t hear him, his mind once more on his words.
Statistically, it was highly likely that that would happen—but his gut told him otherwise, told him that he would get to meet his soulmate one day, and he had always trusted his instinct.
She knows what he’s saying and why and Jim does too. Only Steve doesn’t, but he will soon.
Or maybe silt.
“Was I yours?” he wanted to ask, but he wasn’t sure if he really wanted to know. Peggy always had a band on every time he visited, her wrist never bare in all the time he had known her. Steve didn’t know whether that was because she wanted to keep her mark private as some people did even after finding their soulmate or because she wanted to keep it from him.
Okay, he could admit that it had a lot to do with Steve.
Love, he thought, holding Tony close to him and breaking, finally, as Tony returned the embrace, tightly like no one could make him let go, like he was afraid someone would rip Steve away from him. He buried his face in Tony’s hair, his breath hitching as Tony shook in his arms, great sobs racking his entire body.
“You were able to do those things yourself.”
Another flash.
“Then this is me asking for a date,” he said seriously.
Tony descended on shaky legs, wan but alive, eyes wide with a fragile desperation that Steve couldn’t interpret but innately understood, and he was on fire, his lungs, throat, and eyes burning as he pushed himself forward.
His words came back to him as he hovered in the doorway, tracing every line of Tony’s body, making an inventory of all his injuries, all the ways that he had changed since they had last been together.
“I kind of—” he blurted out too loudly and too quickly, getting ahead of himself in embarrassment. He rubbed the back of his neck self-consciously. “I might’ve thought you were putting yourself up for auction.”
Except…except now that he was next to Steve, it had seemed silly, that fight or flight impulse, when all he wanted to do was lean against Steve’s shoulder and close his eyes, to go to sleep with Steve solid under him, his presence a weight that would anchor him as he slept, that would remind him that Steve was alive and with him, not dead, not countries, planets, or galaxies away.
He got up again, scanning his surroundings wildly. Dozens of Chitauri were strewn across the ground, and Tony would have been impressed by the body count had it not been for the pressing matter at hand.
It wasn’t like they were at each other’s throats either. No one could complain about their behavior. He made sure to be civil. There wasn’t any room for fighting when Thanos loomed on the horizon, threatening to rain down punishment any day now. More Outriders had popped up, higher-ranked ones. It was only a matter of time.
If Steve didn’t move away, he would be soaked. He stayed put.
The ship docked far off in the distance, its gusting propellers cutting off as soon as it sank into the loamy soil. The grass swayed and then straightened. A ramp began to slide down and before he knew what he was doing, he shot forward, unsure of whether the fear that pumped through him like adrenaline came from bracing for another fight or from hoping, even when he tried so valiantly not to, that not everything had been lost.
He didn’t want this.
“How dare you?” he wanted to snarl.
She catches him staying in one place for hours at a time when he isn’t going through the motions, peering out at nothing and saying nothing. He’s a lighthouse waiting for a ship to return to him, one unaware that it’s gone dark and deserted. There’s no light to guide the ship, nothing to welcome it if, by some miracle, it made it back.
“No. No, I can’t,” he choked out.
He looked down at the band.
Steve curled his fingers over the simple, gunmetal gray band and clasped it tightly, remembering the day that his mother had given it to him. She had stopped wearing it long ago, she and his father exchanging their words not long after they had met each other, but she had kept both bands in her jewelry box to give to Steve when the time came.
“My words,” he managed to choke out. A lump formed in his throat, trapping his words inside him, growing painful the longer he waited for it to disappear. He lowered his arm to explain instead, trying his best not to tremble.
“You have me too,” Steve reminded him because Tony had won his auction too and because everything Tony was offering, he wanted to give back to Tony as well.
“The Nova Corps lost ten of its ships already keeping Thanos and the Black Order from landing on Xandar. There are troops on the ground and in the air and more coming to their aid, but it’s only a matter of time before they reach the Power Stone. He’s come well-prepared,” Thor reported grimly.
Huh. Maybe the beard was some depressing show of solidarity for his cyborg BFF.
“I’m just saying unconventional methods are surprisingly effective sometimes. There. All done. Tell me if it’s loose enough.”
Used to be that he thought Steve believed that too.
If there were really such a thing as fairness, she wouldn’t be standing here instead of them.
“No, that’s not…” Steve sighed and reached out for Tony’s hand, playing with the engagement ring that he had picked out for Tony before he continued. “I didn’t know there were so many things to take care of, that’s all. It’s a lot to take in for me, and it’s stressing you out. I just want you to be happy. I don’t need all this.”
“They’re just words, Steve,” he said, and his reply came out gentler than he had meant it to. Kinder. More than hurting Steve, he needed him to understand that for a reason he couldn’t fathom.
There were too many for his liking. He couldn’t leave Steve alone to deal with them. He shifted his stance, digging his feet into the ground, his back against Steve’s until Steve turned around.
He's standing strong at the airport, his voice breaking, allowing it to break, allowing them to see how much they mean to him, how much he needs and wants Steve at his side.
turned into
They were retreading old territory. The familiar ice-cold fear trickled through his veins. He drummed his fingers against the desk, trying to keep it at bay before it punctured his heart.
Sometimes he managed to brush a few on their way back, but they were as lifeless and dull as he felt in his waking hours. Opaque flashes of gray, murky and unsaturated.  Fleeting glimpses that slipped through his outstretched fingers, leaving him alone on a remote shore once they were gone.
Tony’s throat closed up, sealed by a drum of unshed tears too large for such a small space. It hurt when he swallowed around it. He wasn’t sure that he would be able to speak even if he knew what to say.
“Pretending we’re fine, like we don’t know why the other person’s in the kitchen at four in the morning when we’ve done this before. I know why you’re here; it’s why I am. There’s no reason for us to keep doing this. But we do.”
This was what the Greeks had gone on about. The shackles came off during those nights and uninhibited, with no reason to hold back, Steve was fearsome, a myth come to life.
“I’ll close my eyes,” he said, and even though he was okay, even though they had had years to arrive at this moment, where they both could let go at the same time, his eyes stung. Tony always tried to protect him, even now when they reached the end.
There. Ten clicks away. An outcrop of rubble. It was exposed, and there was a horde of Chitauri too close for his liking, but it was a smaller group than the ones they had passed and he couldn’t push the suit any farther.
That wasn’t what he was afraid of, betrayal. He knew, just as Steve did, that there were decisions—mistakes—that he had made that he would never make again.
“I dreamed of him tonight. The kid,” he offered carefully. Evenly. His hand felt dirty. He wanted to pull it back into his lap, under the table and out of Steve’s sight, to rub his palm against his thigh over and over again.
“You’re pretty good at this,” he noted. It was true. Steve knew what he was doing, and he was doing a better job of wrapping the bandages than if he had done it on his own.
“All those back alley scraps came in handy, huh?”
“But this is the one where it does. It means we have a chance,” Steve said. And as Steve did, he found himself believing in it. All of them had sleepwalked through the past few days, going through the motions mechanically as they struggled to come to terms with what had happened, but the hope that had fluttered awake inside him with Tony’s return grew stronger with his words. For the first time since Thanos had left Earth victorious, he was filled with a sense of renewed purpose.
“Yeah,” Tony said, leaning against him again. “I do.”
“What did he do?”
“I’m done keeping secrets from you.”
All his preparation for this exact moment flew out the window. He had spent the past years alternating between thinking Steve never cared about him and thinking that he did but not enough or not as much as he had wanted him to (“So was I.” But had he been?). He wasn’t sure what was worse.
But Steve was convinced that that wouldn’t be him. He loved his soulmate too much. He would be happy with whoever they were and whatever his words meant because having a mark meant that he was loved, that he was enough, and that was all that mattered in the end.
He ignored the fact that Steve stayed until it was only the two of them at the end of each team meeting, that he straightened up every time Tony accidentally entered the same room as him alone, that his face twisted into something awful whenever Tony left as quickly as possible. That he stared and stared and stared like Tony was something just out of reach when he assumed Tony wasn’t looking, something precious, something loved, something lost.
He couldn’t bring himself to see the pity on Rhodey’s face. Shame coated his tongue, rancid and fermented like stale alcohol.
He had read once that old injuries never fully go away, that under certain circumstances, the lack of collagen to sew together the wounds forced those that had faded, those that had long since healed and been forgotten, to suddenly reappear, each one painfully fresh.
But Steve was right that he was running himself into the ground, and if he pushed himself too far, he would negatively affect their efforts. They couldn’t afford that.
Vision was gone, the Mind Stone plucked from his head. Wanda had died shortly after, taking out hundreds in her grief, before Thanos had crushed her. Countless others, the last line of defense, had fallen.
Because this was the terrible, inescapable truth: he loved Steve, had fallen in love with Steve long before Steve had said his word—and in doing so, placed his faith in a man who may have never existed.
“You seem to have held together okay.” He waved a hand at them carelessly as though he hadn’t thoroughly scanned them for injuries too. “No big injuries, new looks. You know better than bleached eyebrows, Romanoff, but that beard isn’t half bad, Rogers. I guess with all that downtime between illegal missions, you had plenty of time for maintenance and buying beard oil.”
“Stop,” he said, and he felt everyone freeze on the field. He felt everyone’s wounds stitch together, the bleeding staunched. He felt everyone pulled from the brink of death.
It’s one of the rare times that Steve wants to talk. Most days, he doesn’t say or do anything beyond what’s necessary to keep the world from descending fully into chaos.
He knew, logically, that his words could have a different meaning from the one he had ascribed to them and that some people didn’t put as much weight behind them as he did.
“You think I haven’t tried?” For the first time in days, Tony faced Steve full on, refusing to look away. It was easier and harder than he expected. “I did that before, told him to stick to old ladies crossing the street and playground fights, and Teenage Rebellion decided not to listen.”
“I didn’t know it was going to be cheese,” he said a little more defensively than he would have liked.
“They were your parents, Tony,” he whispered.
He marveled at the tips of Steve’s ears flushing before Steve looked up and then at the discomfort on his face once they were face-to-face again. He had never seen him this uncomfortable before, not even when he cracked a lewd joke just to see how he would react.
. In his mind flashed a fleeting memory: Steve raining blows on him, Steve with his shield held high, harshly disfigured by a grimace of fury—and grief.
There were so many words that had been unsaid between them, that had died unborn in his mouth because he had been too afraid. He didn’t want to regret not saying them anymore.
, she thinks, but communication had always been their downfall.
And then when he had all three, something to fight for again and the team reunited and at the compound once more, and home still didn’t feel like a home: Tony. Tony, who was gone. Tony, whom he had hurt so deeply and realized he loved too late.
“For now, no. The Guardians and I are trying to gain as much distance as we can from both Xandar and Earth. But we have to act quickly.”
“I don’t know,” Tony lied.
And it was true. He had said it then with such conviction that Tony had no choice but to relent. It should have changed things, the fact that his word did have meaning, that it was something that Steve believed in with all his heart.
Tony was fiercely glad that Steve was still looking straight ahead. Happiness surged through him like electricity and strangely fear as well.
The idea he had was a rash one, a suicide mission with a low probability of success, but it was something. And something was better than nothing.
He went back to the beginning.
“I do. You deserve everything, Steve,” Tony said, so forthright that Steve had to resist the sudden impulse to hide or say the opposite.
They hadn’t had much time to talk after it was over, too busy being treated in medical and then heading out to help with recovery and reconstruction plans all over the country and the world once they got the green light.
His soulmate wouldn’t have to know what it would be like to lose him.
“Tony,” he said carefully. “Do you want to stay?”
He wanted to hold it, but there was something grimy stuck under his nails and his entire hand was coated with a layer of something thick and suffocating. He couldn’t touch Steve like that.
“You can’t—” Tony shakes his head, but the familiarity of whatever impossible stubbornness Steve must have shown makes him break into a disbelieving, almost exasperated, laugh. There’s a tinge of hysteria to it, a sob lurking under the surface. “That’s not something you have any power over. You didn’t have a say in this. None of us did.”
She wonders how he can believe that. Oxygen’s running dangerously low for Tony if it hasn’t run out already.
With Pepper. With Steve.
Steve thought of the past few years, the first year and then the years after that, once he transferred to the same college as Bucky. The way that he felt and remembered almost nothing that entire year after Tony had died, as if he had plunged into the ocean and fallen asleep in the ice, and how Tony’s presence grounded and comforted him then. The way that he had slowly but surely thawed. The way that Bucky was there just like the old times once he moved, and the way that he met Natasha and Sam and begun to live life again.
And soulmates or not, Tony loved him even as he had hated and then mourned him, even as he missed him, and in spite of all the anger, all the raw pain that he carried, he didn’t want that for Steve.
Uncharted territory was dangerous; one wrong move and what they had built, stone upon uneven stone, a structure that was precariously cobbled together but remained intact if left alone, would come tumbling down. They would go back to where they had been at the Helicarrier, so they did their best not to do anything to rock the boat.
“So?” he asked dully. “What does it matter?”
But he was never keen on being safe, and neither was Steve.
But Steve had never been there. And he had gotten this far without him.
The serum was supposed to change every part of him.
He had his answer.
For him, Tony realized.
He could shape the universe to his vision, a utopia free from strife and suffering.
He could stop death.
Tony didn’t know what to say, years’ worth of words that had gone unsaid crammed in his throat, dying before they reached his lips. All he knew was that he couldn’t let Steve go without saying anything.
There are new items in it too, ones that were prototypes before she left but are now complete.
It was a little past midnight on a weekday, and the platform was nearly empty save for a few stragglers trying to get home. They had been waiting long enough that Tony was dead on his feet, the exhaustion from a hectic workday and the long nighttime stroll finally catching up with him. He wanted nothing more than to go home and curl up in bed.
Sam. James. Wanda. Vision. T’Challa. And on and on.
“All the checks have been run. You’re good to go,” he heard a SHIELD officer inform Steve.
Like ash.
“You have me. Always. In this and in everything else,” he said softly, and he meant it in all the ways he could mean it, in all the ways that Tony needed him.
Steve still didn’t know whether he should be glad about that or not.
The suit was starting to strain from both the heavy hits it sustained over the course of battle and the unwise number of times he used the thruster he had recently built into his boots.
He could feel the heat of his blush creeping down his face and neck, and considering its intensity, he knew he was as red as a fire hydrant.
He never could, now that Steve thought about it. Tony had always hidden behind masks and bravado when he felt that he needed to. It had taken a while for him to see past that. Once he did, though, he had been able to read Tony like a book, to see when he was joking and when he was putting on his public persona or was wary of showing that he cared too much.
He wished they could stay like this forever.
There.
Being let in is a privilege. She doesn’t know if she’s won it and lost it or if she’s ever truly earned it in the first place when it comes to him.
, Tony thought.
The remaining Avengers are all caught in a loop, playing a reel of their friends’ last moments in their heads. They build their dead back up from the mounds only to watch them fall apart until Thor rises out of his stupor and speaks. Slowly, as though awakening from a collapsing dream, everything disintegrating but the single idea occupying his mind, he rasps out the first words after the massacre, cementing the nightmare they’re in as their new reality.
To Tony, he had been something that needed to be crushed under the tires of what was necessary on the way to his better, safer future, a loss that was regrettable but unavoidable.
Steve gave a short nod. He put his hands in his pockets as though he didn’t know what to do with them. “I won’t keep you.”
No pressure. Just another day at the office, Tony thought a bit hysterically.
The end came like a cascading failure, one catastrophe rapidly leading to the next.
He couldn’t stop the hiss that slipped through between his teeth. Steve didn’t notice, too busy opening a first-aid kit that he had had for some inexplicable reason when he approached Tony at the punching bag.
Tony could hear the train clattering down the tracks on the other side of the platform in the opposite direction and kept his eyes closed. He wanted the moment to last.
“I know how he operates,” Loki had said among other things, and Tony had no choice but to hope that despite his misgivings, with Loki and Thanos’s daughters, Gamora and Nebula, protecting one of the most dangerous of the Stones, they could have some control over the timeline of events. Thanos could destroy with ease, obliterate planets with a blasé flick of his hand, but he was still bound by the restrictions of space travel.
“He doesn’t know about it.”
“You don’t deserve it,” he said because for a second he thought that Steve was going to kill him with the shield that his father had made, the one that he had chosen out of all the ones that Howard had offered him.
“I’d like to talk to Tony alone,” Steve said to all of them firmly, his expression quelling any form of protest that might have otherwise risen.
Steve blinked at him in surprise.
That never let him forget Steve so that Tony would be thinking of him and only him to his death, to Steve’s death, to their world’s as he would Tony.
He wasn’t sure if Steve would be okay. He didn’t know the first thing about stomach wounds, didn’t know the extent of Steve’s, not without peeling back the uniform and hurting Steve even more. He didn’t know whether it was fatal or not, but there was a lot of blood. Too much blood. He was kneeling in it, the legs of his armor coated with it.
Their eyes locked and instantly Steve was all but seventeen again, heart pounding unevenly in his chest, painfully awkward in his skin, as he asked Tony out the day before Homecoming after years of pining. Autumn had come early that year, the streets thickly carpeted with fallen leaves and the air sharp with the hint of oncoming frost, and Tony had stood there, almost at the very spot he was standing now, a wrench in his right hand and dark grease stains smearing his cheek and shirt, more beautiful than their surroundings—more beautiful than anything Steve had ever seen.
He thought of the way that Steve had looked at him when he stopped him from destroying the bag, the way he held his hands in his, so crestfallen over their swollen, bloody, shredded state. He thought of the way that Steve had brushed his torn skin, the calluses and scars that he had collected over the years, with a kind of reverence before applying the ointment.
“I’m not leaving you to—”
Tony came to him, his armor slipping off until he stood in just the clothes he had slept and left in when the call came through. His eyes were warm, and his hair curled at his temple just the way Steve loved, flattened as it was against his forehead by sweat and his helmet. There was nothing between them, not like when they had first met and the only thing Steve caught was his veneer. Tony’s brashness had been too loud for him after decades of silent sleep that he missed the beauty of him, the little glimpses Tony offered of what lay beyond that exterior.
He dropped into the chair by Steve’s desk, dragging in a deep breath that sounded wet to his ears. “You ever consider that you might not have? I wasn’t mad at you for what happened; it wasn’t your fault or Barnes’s. I was mad at you for keeping me in the dark. If you had just told me, I would have had the time and space to process it and helped you. Tell me you know that I wouldn’t have held that against you.”
“Upset?” Tony smiled, and Steve was relieved to see that it was genuine, absent of anything Tony would try to hide when it wasn’t.
He followed Steve’s gaze down.
And underneath it all, this close to the man he had been afraid he would never see again, a scent that Steve could only describe as
It shouldn’t have hurt this badly.
She called him narcissistic and said he didn’t play well with others, that she recommended Iron Man but not Tony Stark, but it’s Tony who’s in that suit. Tony, who flew that bomb out into space without hesitation, not sure of what he would meet and the end he would meet. Tony whom she abandoned to the wolves twice. Three times, she corrects, as the phone lights up a belligerent red again, no doubt Ross bullheadedly refusing to leave them alone.
“That was him, wasn’t it?” Bucky asked, and Steve didn’t have to ask him how he knew. He had been there when his words came in after all, and whatever Bucky said about not being the same person anymore, he knew Steve, would always know him no matter how much things changed.
Steve knew Sam was offering to check up on him after, and he was grateful for it although if his hunch was right, it would be unnecessary.
If there was no escape for him, there would be no escape for Tony too. An eye for an eye, a heart for a heart.
It knocked Tony off-kilter except it shouldn’t have. Despite his misconceptions of Steve that had carried over from adolescence and their botched first meeting, Steve had turned out to be less uptight and callously judgmental than he had assumed he would be.
But he could change the meaning of his word, make it hurt less. He could make it mean nothing like it did for Steve, if he even had Tony’s words on his wrist.
Tony’s eyes were big and bright with incredulity, as if he were struggling to believe his good fortune.
Home had been purpose. Then, as he wandered nomadically and the inability to settle anywhere for too long wore him down, a place to return to at the end of the day, somewhere safe where he belonged and could finally rest. Family, despite having told himself that he was fine being on his own and Tony that the Avengers were more Tony’s family than his.
He resisted the urge to rub his chest.
His New York.
The thing was, he didn’t agree with Rhodey, but maybe it wasn’t about agreeing. And maybe it wasn’t about trying to change what had already happened. No matter how far back he went, there were some things that were outside of his control as much as he hated to admit it.
“Congrats.”
“How much did you hear?” he asked weakly, breaking a long moment of awkward silence where no one quite knew where to look.
The video floods the screen and shows the innards of an alien ship. Natasha has no idea what she’s looking at. Tony is off-screen.
His words had come out without much bite; he wasn’t hiding his discomfort too well. Steve’s expression only confirmed it, heavy and serious as he studied Tony. Tony didn’t know what to do with such undivided attention. He never did. He didn’t know what Steve meant half of the time when he observed him like this.
“Tony,” he breathes out like an apology and a wish, like there’s nothing in the world but the name on his lips and the half-dead man in front of him.
Tony watched it disappear over the treetops before speaking again, his words picking up speed. “Everyone left for college, and I knew you wouldn’t want to talk about it with anyone—you never do—and well, I told you once that I’d stick around as long as I could, as long as you needed me. And no matter what people say about me, I don’t—I don’t back out on promises like that.”
Or take his hands out of his pockets.
—you know what, I have an excuse for not being up-to-date on ghost movies. I’m dead,” Tony huffed before he grew serious again, just as Steve knew he would if he waited the nervous chatter out.
A second chance, he thought.
“Yeah well, I don’t have to babysit too much. Peter’s great. Smart too. He’ll leave me in the dust one day.”
He couldn’t be so fucking maudlin. He couldn’t wallow in self-pity. Rhodey needed him. Vision needed him. He had to pull himself together before Rhodey got discharged from the hospital. He could fool Vision. That was easy; there wasn’t any precedent for his behavior in Vision’s memory. But he could never fool Rhodey as much as he wanted to, and Rhodey didn’t need this right now. Rhodey's pain was real. It existed outside of his head unlike his. Tony couldn’t make him worry by moping over a broken heart like some stupid teenager on top of everything too.
Tony turned his palm upwards and linked their fingers together.
He didn’t have an answer for Steve. He didn’t know how long it would take for him to figure it out or if he would ever have an answer. And it would be cruel to give Steve hope when that was the case.
Steve at least had the tact to look chagrined.
Relief rushes through Natasha, so electrifying that her brain goes fuzzy with numb shock.
“I know you might not want to hear this, but I meant what I said in the letter. You’ll always have me. Even if you want to go separate paths after all this is over, that won’t ever change.”
“Don’t knock Vegas. I’ve had some nice times there.” Tony frowned. “Okay, maybe nice isn’t the right word.”
“I watched you for a while,” Steve admitted after a pause. “I didn’t want to interrupt you, but it seemed like you’d been at it for a long time and I wasn’t sure if you had wraps on under your gloves.”
“Earth just lost her best defender,” he said to Ross, to the team, to everyone but the one person who needed to hear it most.
He wanted to see what a future with Steve would be like. He hoped it would be a bright, happy one. He knew that they both would work towards making that happen. All that had happened to lead up to this point had taught him that.
“I graduated.”
Rhodey cut him off with a wave of his hand.
But the universe doesn’t care about fairness. If it did, she wouldn’t be standing here instead of those who were truly good, those who deserved new beginnings, though she can’t tell which fate is worse, being killed the way they were or being one of the lucky few to survive by pure chance.
Midtown, ugly and raucous, became something else when given the chance. A different side emerged when seen from a new perspective, with enough space. Like now.
It’s fitting that they're the only ones present, meaningful in a way that of all the Avengers, they’re the ones receiving his message. They’re inextricably and eternally tied to Tony, more so than any of the others on the team had been. They’ve known Tony longest. Their lives have been intertwined with his since the beginning. Before the beginning. Before they formed the Avengers, before Tony became Iron Man, before Tony led Stark Industries. In Steve’s case, even before Tony was born.
On this, he could trust Steve.
except he didn’t know what he wanted to accuse Steve of doing. How dare you take this from me, how dare you keep this from me, how dare you act like this means anything after all that happened. He didn’t understand what the point was, saying this now. If Steve had known before he found out about the murder, if Steve had known before Siberia, he hadn’t mattered enough. If it had been after Siberia, he only mattered because some random twist of fate put his words on Steve’s wrist.
“Netflix and chill?” Sam replied a bit disapprovingly, as if he were disappointed on Steve’s behalf. “I thought you’d have better game than that.”
New York belonged to them.
Tony hadn’t been able to make the call in the end.
“Be safe, Steve,” he said. “Win.”
“Of course.” Steve closed the door behind him as he entered.
There was a clarity to the brisk air. Everything was sharper and cleaner, more crisply defined, but it all smeared into a blur, smudging into the background, because there was only Tony in the sky, only Iron Man’s brilliant crimson and gold form standing out in sharp relief even in the watery daylight.
“He’ll find a way to sneak in. I took his suit away before, when he put himself and other people in danger because he got too in his head, and he...” He faltered, the regret still stinging. “I almost got him killed because he tried doing the right thing anyway, suit or no suit. He won’t stay away if people need help even if I try to baby-proof everything, Steve. I’ve
And now, whether Loki had indeed surrendered the Space Stone to save his brother or whether he had weighed his choices and concluded that it would be in his self-interest to shift loyalties, Thanos had the Stone in his possession and was heading their way.
To pummel his hands to pulpy shreds, apparently, enough times that he wasn’t surprised by Tony’s injuries or explanation.
Tony had always been like that. He took what was his, but he gave everything else, and sometimes—many times—what should have belonged to him away too. And when it came to the people he loved, he always gave without expecting anything in return, and never was it more true than with Steve.
“It’s fine. This’ll only take a few minutes,” he promised.
The question looms between them, eclipsing everything but its present and future. Nothing is as important as Steve’s answer and nothing is as meaningless. It changes everything. It changes nothing.
“You still have your band,” she remarked. She rubbed the tiny
Tony was content simply standing next to Steve, watching in comfortable silence as the city they both loved came alive. He could wait for Steve. He always would.
And Peggy looked at him sometimes when she thought he wasn't looking too, understood him in a way no one, not even Bucky, did, and that had to count for something. Or at least he hoped it did.
but he knew that would make things worse.
He didn’t have to fix everything. That was what Steve would tell him. The Avengers would figure it out somehow; they always did when they had one another.
“Are you saying Captain America fights dirty?”
They had done it. By fighting side by side, by preparing, by listening. By never giving up. And this was the result. Broken and in pieces but still there.
They had to make do with what they had, and the little they had was enough. Would have to be enough. Just to see them through the war, Tony thought, and then… And then… He always stopped himself from thinking any further than that. The future was a tapestry of spider silk—beautiful, but easy to destroy. Insubstantial.
Something flickered across Tony’s face, too quick to analyze. “You...”
So what? So what if he would have been? He would have gladly offered himself to be ripped to pieces while he did, to die wielding the Gauntlet, if it meant that Steve would be far away, alive and whole.
But there were no signs of thorns or leaves or petals. No sweet sickness perfuming Tony. No bloodstains on his mouth, faded like lipstick he hadn’t managed to wipe off entirely, or careful, labored breathing that made him hunch over and carry himself gingerly.
“You didn’t. Is everything all right?”
Threads ran out from every inch of him, from his fingernails, his toes, the roots of his hair, every pore on his body. They connected him to everyone and them to him, down every floor of every building, down to the pavement, down below to the subterranean city of tunnels and trains crisscrossing under Manhattan. They were invisible from where he sat, but he could feel them under his skin, thrumming with energy, could feel them move about in their homes and in the city they shared, readying themselves for a new day. They knitted themselves together, became the sinew binding muscle to bone, strengthening and shaping him.
“Oh, that. I can’t believe it got to you in one piece,” Sam said as if this wasn’t odd at all but was rather something expected, which Steve couldn’t understand because he hadn’t ordered cheese, no one had mentioned getting cheese, and there wasn’t any note attached to it explaining where the cheese had come from.
“Even I’m not arrogant enough to lone wolf this whole thing.”
“There. Happy now?” Steve asked, but there was no irritation to his voice or anything really, just the palest shade of fond exasperation. He seemed steadier now, not as hesitant.
Tony laughs humorlessly. There’s something wrong with the sound, a wheezy breathlessness that Steve instantly recognizes. Color drains from his face rapidly, leaving behind a ghastly pallor. His lips move with a silent message to Tony that she can’t read; he can’t seem to work out what to say. It doesn’t matter. His clenched fists and his eyes say plenty. Terror washes in behind the wave of relief, consuming it before it even reaches shore.
He was by himself out here but not alone.
He had never been like this with Steve before either.
He was part of something bigger. A part of a great, hulking organism composed of the millions who lived and worked and moved around here, little cells circulating oxygen through the arterial streets to make it something living and breathing.
Tony looked virtually the same as he did then, honeyed skin and easy smile, handsome in a coltish way. As he ambled over, he ran his fingers through his unruly hair like he had done in high school, a gesture that he did by habit and most likely wasn’t fully aware of. The familiarity of the movement made Steve breathless with heartache. He wanted to reach out and touch Tony, to hold him in his arms like he used to and breathe him in, but he kept his hands at his sides instead.
He could do it, feel every bit of it, with none of the pain that came along with destroying himself.
Tony’s face was unreadable.
Steve hummed in assent, leaning into the touch. “I’m here,” he mumbled.
“Where’s Tony?” he asks, feeble in a way they’ve never seen him before, and for the second time in minutes, all Natasha can do is watch her loved ones fall apart, Steve, Jim, and Bruce caving in from the fatal hit.
“Relatively speaking? And here I was, thinking I aged like fine wine.”
“Why are you telling me this?” He tried to keep his voice even, but the words came out coarse and tight.
He let go of the railing and turned. There was a distant sadness in his eyes, faint and veiled; he was far away, a dying solitary star outside of Tony’s galaxy. Whatever he was going to say, it was a message that had traveled for years and miles, one that Tony wasn’t sure he had the power to change, so removed by time and distance from its genesis. He wanted to tell him to stop, but his lips were too numb for the protest to slip through.
“There’s no time,” he snapped, but it came out more despairing than acerbic. “There’s no time,” he repeated. His hand was trembling, though whether it was out of fatigue or anxiety, he didn’t know. He put down his fork. “I knew it was going to happen quickly, but not this fast. What if I—” He couldn’t bring himself to finish.
Rhodey cracked a smile. “Oh, you’re right about that. You can’t take all the credit.”
for Sarah. His mother was still with him, made eternal through the vibranium that had kept his band from rusting during all those years in the ice.
Tony ignored him. He managed all this without Steve. A five-minute conversation wouldn’t kill him. Less if he had any say.
She lets go of him and turns, stepping to his side.
Their plants have been tended to, upright and healthy even in their absence, and Natasha’s weapons cache is as spotless as she left it, not a mote of dust in sight.
He wanted Steve to understand how he felt and hurt like he did—but there was no point in yelling something that Steve already knew, no point in driving home something that had clearly already been hammered in. All of Steve’s pain was reserved for Tony; he hurt for Tony with no regard to his own suffering, and it left Tony aimless and lost in his anger and pain.
Tony glanced at him, startled, and Steve could tell he was ready to say no, his heart already sinking, but something on his face must have changed Tony’s mind because he frowned and then bit his lip.
A steaming plate piled high with chicken biryani appeared on his desk. The fragrance hit him immediately, making him realize how hungry he was.
Tony paused at the end of the hallway. The lab or the kitchen. Left or right.
The bidding war had started almost immediately, the numbers jumping up second by second. Steve wasn’t going to bid, wasn’t going to do anything that made it obvious just how sweet he was on Tony like blurting out an extraordinarily high bid, but Tony had seemed taken aback by how fervent the bidding was and how many people were bidding on him—by the
He used to know how to be gentle, he thought, but he walked on, not looking back once.
Because Tony shouldn’t get away with what he did, he told himself, but pretense didn’t come naturally to him the way it did Tony. He knew, however small-minded and obsessive and pathetic it made him, that it was because Tony shouldn’t be allowed not to care about this when he cared too much.
She goes by facts. Solid ground. Things she knows with certainty, things that will ground her and help drive the static out of her head.
This must be what it was like then, to be loved and to be made aware of that love. Yearning roped itself around Tony’s heart, tugging at it. He could take a step forward. He could slot a leg between Steve’s, lean in and run his hands through Steve’s long hair down to the nape of his neck, hold him there where he was vulnerable, where he would be at his mercy. He could choose to heal instead of hurt, pull Steve to him and hold him to his chest.
He reached out, slipping his hand into Steve’s. Steve turned to him in surprise. He had been wrong earlier. There was no sight more beautiful than the one in front of him right now, right at this very moment. A fragile hope was starting to blossom on Steve’s face, his eyes wide with it.
? Why?! I’ve never shown any interest in him.”
So maybe he hadn’t gotten over Steve entirely, but he was working on it.
He wanted to throw himself at Steve. Get one last shot in, push him as hard and as far away as he could. Leave as permanent of a scar on him as Steve had left on his wrist.
, he thought again, and as he pressed a kiss to the paper-thin skin on the inside of his wrist, wishing that his soulmate could feel that somehow, he hoped that they knew how much he loved them, how he would do anything to keep them safe.
But his mind ran too quickly, memories playing in his head before he could stop them, light years ahead of his thoughts. They burst to life on an unstable frequency, fractured images and sounds breaking through the loud gray static in his brain before skipping to the next memory.
Fuck.
The bridge has been swept away, but they’re on the same bank now, Tony pulling Steve to his feet onto safer ground.
But of all the backups, he chose that one and Natasha knows it’s because of all the suits Tony made him, that one was made for SHIELD, tailored to their specifications. Commissioned work rather than a gift.
Nothing could grow in him, not even death flowers.
“What are you doing? Put your bag down and let’s go. We’re late for dinner and I’m starving,” Sam complained.
“Natasha!” Jan cried, taking pity on both him and Tony.
“Funny, I was about to say the same thing.” Tony sighed. He felt wobbly and deflated. “He’s a good kid. Better than the both of us,” he added after a beat.
Steve hadn’t known whether Tony had his words—but he had shown him that it didn’t matter anyway. Had shown him that he didn’t need something in return, that he would be there for Tony, that he would try to atone for the past and do better in the present, regardless of whether or not he belonged to Tony and before he had found out that he did.
Sometimes Tony wondered what it would be like to be normal.
“Scatter,” he said, and he felt Thanos’s atoms disperse until he dissolved into nothing. He felt Thanos’s allies lose purpose and fly home. He felt the Stones shove back as he tried to destroy them.
, he thought desperately, though he didn’t know what he was asking for.
“What?”
“No,” Steve answered thoughtfully. “But I wouldn’t want you to be any different either. If soulmates didn’t exist, I would’ve fallen in love with you anyway.”
“Of course I did. I promised.”
There was more he could have added, a tease about him being the prettiest nurse he ever had, something facetious to return everything to the status quo, but that desire to understand what Steve meant stopped him.
“Don’t I know it.” Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, though it did little to alleviate his headache. “Thanks, big guy. Keep us posted and stay safe.”
A part of Tony, the part that was still healing, warned against letting Steve in, against letting his guard down so that he could never get hurt again, because it had never been a matter of whether he loved Steve or not. He always did, and he always would. It was a matter of whether he could let Steve in.
A flood of exhilarated relief washed over Tony, nearly bowling him over.
It was a while before he spoke, but when he did, he decided to meet Steve halfway and give him what he wanted. Answering Steve’s promise, telling him he knew Steve would keep it, would be useless. Steve wouldn’t believe him, and it would be a long while before he would. But this…this he could give. His nightmares were worthless to him; he had a surfeit of them. But to Steve they would have value, would represent something else—a different form of trust.
“It’s not like last time,” Pepper replies, and it hurts more than it should, but the pain eases when she explains, “We have you, Bruce, Steve, and Thor, Carol and Rocket…the whole world. Tony’s got all of us trying to get him back. We’re not doing this alone.”
“He’s so young. He should be having fun with his friends, not—” Steve ran a hand down his face, exhaustion and worry in every line. “I’m just worried he’ll get hurt.”
, he left unsaid.
And for the briefest of moments, as he traced the round, loopy letters printed on his skin with shaking fingers red and numb with cold, he was cradled in joy. It blossomed inside of his chest and wrapped around him, a protective cocoon against the cold, as bright as the Christmas lights running along the deck railing far behind him. It was quivery and silver-delicate before growing stronger and brighter, as though all the stars in the December sky had been switched on at once, as though the sun had come out, dazzling him and consuming his entire vision until he went blind with happiness.
Steve’s voice splinters. For the first time, Natasha sees him laid bare.
He remembered how nonchalantly Tony had raised his paddle and given his winning bid.
By the time war broke out, Steve had stopped thinking about his words as often as he had used to. He had had them for more than a decade now, and the novelty had worn off once he realized he couldn’t spend his entire life constantly jumping whenever someone said his words or wondering if they would whenever he talked to them. His words weren’t that common, but they weren’t unique either, not like Bucky’s were, and he had heard enough variations of the line on his wrist over the years that he had forced himself to ignore it, only thinking about it occasionally.
“We have to hold a team meeting and update everyone on Thor’s report.”
His own, thin and asthmatic as he picked up the call and said Tony's name, anticipation and fear clashing inside of him.
“Fourteen million. That’s how many timelines there were where this doesn’t end happily.”
And so Natasha says the only thing that comes to mind, something that isn’t empty words of comfort but the truth.
Tony swallowed a sigh. “Team meeting in here at 9 A.M.” He gestured towards the general vicinity of the living quarters, stopping in his tracks but not bothering to turn around. “Your room is as you left it.”
Hope wasn't a plan, Steve thought, looking at Tony, but there couldn’t be one without it.
Because it was the same for him as it was for Tony—Tony had someone to come home to, and Steve…Steve had someone who chose to come home to him, who brought the whole of New York back to him every time he did, one that was theirs.
“I can do both at the same time.”
The last time he had was at the Expo. He had watched Bucky salute him and leave with their dates and thought that that was it, that he was on his own for real now, at least until he managed to make his way into the army. He had rubbed at the band around his wrist then, comforted by its familiar weight and smooth texture. Even without taking it off, he had been able to picture his soulmate’s handwriting in his mind, the words that they would say to him in the future as clear as if they had been photographed.
“Got it!” he couldn’t help but shout.
“Like lightning.”
“You always say that, and I can’t help but worry anyway,” she said, and all he could bring himself to do at that was smile back and turn his hand to hold hers.
him. He didn’t have the right to be hurt. But Steve had acknowledged that he had and the truth was, he had hurt Steve too.
Tony was all of it.
Nothing moved in the wake of his call. As the silence stretched on, the air seemed to grow heavier, weighed down with the stillness that came from absence; even the owl he had heard earlier seemed to have disappeared. He began to wonder if he should call out again when Tony appeared from behind the house, slinking around the corner with soundless, feline grace.
“I know. I know you are, but don’t close your eyes. Focus on me.” A ragged gasp tore his lungs open. He couldn’t catch his breath. He was suffocating. “You’re going to be fine. We’re going to…we’re going to get you help. It’ll be okay.”
He took all the pieces he found of Tony scattered everywhere and put them together again, wrapping the bandages around them and around his hands, making sure that the fit was snug enough. It was soothing, the repetitiveness of it, watching the cloth go up and over again, feeling Steve’s hands around his. Tony started to feel more concrete, all his fault lines sealing up, all his nervous energy seeping out of him until he was solid again, until he was himself.
