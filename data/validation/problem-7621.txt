It could be worse.
Steve meets him halfway, looking at him with veiled curiosity.
He continues to fuck Tony's legs, no care about his cock getting wet with the piss dripping down Tony's thighs. "Come on,”  Steve moans, loud, his thrust growing erratic. “Piss on my cock.”
“I’m serious,” Steve adds, insistent. “You’re a good man.”
He parts his legs as far as they can go. Steve tugs them further apart, wordlessly. He fumbles for the side table, and smiles triumphant at Tony. He holds up the bottle of lube like a trophy.
“Don’t try to turn this on me, Steve. You’re so obvious. I’ve been tailing you all for a while now and every time Tony does something half as reckless as you, you get your panties in a twist, yelling at comms.” Bucky sighed, “You sure know how to pick trouble.”
he had said, waving his hand towards the showerhead. Steve just grinned, grabbed Tony’s arms and pinned them above his head, then kissed him stupid, hot and messy.
“No, it’s mine,” Steve says, throat dry.
French has always come easy, and while he’s picked up a little bit of Arabic in his travels, it’s not enough to hold a drawn out conversation. But that’s alright, he doesn’t talk much these days. With this line of work, there’s no grand speeches or televised lectures in packed auditoriums.
“‘Course. I know, you, Steve Rogers.”
Tony seemed fine to let him do so as Steve twisted to catch his lips, Tony shook his head, placed both his hands on his hips. “Work for it Steve. I do like to see you focusing all your attention on pleasing me, come on,” he said, amused.
I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you.
“No, it’s permanent.” He wiggled the thin paper, flashing it to her face. “No, I even have a certificate to prove it.”
Steve knows a little bit about that. He traces the curve of Tony’s face, the lines on his forehead, and wonders if he’s lost him, too.
Those eyes haunted him.
“Can I go next, Aunt Nat?” Harley said. “Morgan always goes first.”
Ten days. That’s the average. Averages are shit. They're all rough. He could speed up the process only if Steve would beat him to death. He's done it so many times before but he's holding back now.
You take. You take. You take. I think I gave you everything. All of it. Maybe it wasn’t enough. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, alright. I’m sorry, Steve. I am. Forgive me.
“Yeah.”
Steve kisses me again, like an apology, then he’s pressing against my hole, still wet and swollen from hours ago. He groans, kisses my cheeks, and tells me, “Shellhead, god. Tony.”
“Stark,” Natasha calls out, eyes never leaving Verenake. “We could use you during the interrogation.”
“Just Steve.”
I pretend I’m above the sky, flying away to another planet, another galaxy.
Tony reached up to twist Steve’s nipples. “You’re thinking too much. Stop. We’re supposed to be fucking.”
“Alright, yes,” Tony whispers, disregarding the rest of his thoughts. “There’s still us.”
A voice rang from above. “Certainly, sir. Anything for you. Hello, Captain Rogers.”
Simple, plain, human.
She’s never called him anything other than Steve all this time, and Steve has never asked to be called anything other than what she’s comfortable with. It has always been,
Another year without Tony has gone by.  It was too early in the morning. The sun was rising.
“Yeah, yeah.” Steve didn’t try to deny it. He watched Tony exchange words with Hill and some other agents. He rattled off directions to Maria and her second in command, pointing at the broken computers at the side of the room.
Steve could understand Pepper’s investment. She needed to ensure the future of SI. Steve couldn’t screw the business. Well, he had nothing to do with it anyway.
“Steve, it’s an illusion. It’s a memory.” She paused, eyes softening with pity. “It’s not him. It can’t be him. You’re not allowing yourself to move on.”
Parker and Drew punch and kick a few farmers, but all stop when the one that wears Parker’s face chokes Cassandra Lang.
There's a desk shaped like a semi-circle with teen magazines, several books, and bows and arrows. Across from it hangs a dart board with newspaper clippings of Thanos pinned to the bullseye. Beside it lies another desk, but it’s made of a sleek material, much like Tony’s own. There’s a version of the armor’s gauntlet, except it’s slimmer and the colors are pitch black with a splash of bright pink.
Like always, Steve is dreaming, grasping at the remnants of an unfulfilled fantasy.
“You can make Morgan a flower crown, just like you used to with dad. You always made him king.”
“JARVIS had some recordings of dad braiding my hair and he let me watch till I got it right.”
Steve kisses Tony’s shoulder, follows the line of his neck with bruising, wet kisses, sucking and marking his husband. Tony groans, pulls Steve by the hair to press their mouths together. Their cocks are lined up, and Tony works on getting them off, squirming his hips and saying,
Sheriff Red Wolf tips his hat towards Tommy. “The kid was just telling me that they found some footprints in the dam.”
He meets Steve's eyes. There's no choice. Steve won't leave. He'll be more forceful the longer Tony resists.
“Cut it, go ahead. It’s good for open wounds.” Bruce nods and offers Steve a pair of garden scissors. "I woke up in Sakaar and two years had passed. I get the confusion.”
He thinks back to dropping the shield and prying the red and blue out of his suit, as if he could strip off Captain America from his memories.
“Steve, it’s gonna be a fight. Everyday is gonna be like preparing for battle. But you’ve done that your whole life and you can keep going.”
He’s not entirely sure what possessed him to talk. Group today was bleak. He wanted to give a little hope.
Steve’s heart beats faster. Tony, Tony, Tony.  He clears his throat, relaxes into his body and wears an unassuming smile. “Does he usually come here?”
“He was showing symptoms of tuberculosis this last week,” Reed informs the room. He returns to slicing making a larger incision down its belly, pulling off what looks like intestines. Only, its dark green and black as tar.
From where he stands, Steve reads the P. Parker embroidered in the hanging lab coat.
Still loves.
“I’m never gonna love again, Buck. Not because I don’t want to. It’s just not possible. I don’t want to love someone the same way I loved him. Do you know what it’s like to
It was no longer attached permanently to his chest. Just a few months ago, he underwent a rigorous surgery to remove the shrapnel. Steve paced the waiting room, waiting for an update for hours. Tony assured him that he’d be fine, but Steve didn’t want to lose another friend. Not on his watch. He just got Bucky back. Everything was going well.
I repeat what he tells me, word for word. I tell him about Joanna, then Rumiko, and make myself cry when I speak about them, because I’m supposed to be vulnerable. This is part of the role.
“You don’t have to convince me.” Steve pressed his erection forward, letting the slick of the soap from Tony’s body guide his dick between Tony’s cheeks.
“Because I’m tired of seeing you bleed, goddamnit.”
“No, we didn’t.” Steve will be the first to admit that.
He snorted, Tony would roll his eyes regarding the therapist. He made B.A.R.F.
Tony turns on the bed, stares at the wooden ceiling. There’s a draft from the cracks on the window.
There was no end to grief.
Her lips quirk up. She shakes her head, and sighs. “Sure.” She smells like coffee today. Her eyes are clear, green and bright. Alert. Under the sun, Steve can see two freckles on the bump of her nose. “Let me know if you find him.”
Steve hums, watching the lights play patterns across Tony’s face. “It’s just life, I think.”
Tony woke up slowly and stood on shaky legs. The room was clean. There was a plastic bag by the door filled with garbage, old newspapers from days ago, empty water bottles, moldy toast. He could see the outline of the vase he threw across the room inside. The puke was cleared off, now a stain on the rug.
It’s about bodies and being human, all too human. His heart was a decaying organ that he wanted to pry out and substitute with something more durable.
He pictured Tony sitting there, a weld in hand as he turned to Steve with a grin.
There’s nothing else to do but try to mend himself.
“Fine. You can say it.”
Subject: [no subject]
Rumiko had asked for his help in planning a surprise for Tony. Everything would be fine—after all, this is
A quick scan with Extremis informs Tony that the Tower is empty except for Jarvis who’s away in his quarters.
He falls, dropping quietly. Resigned.
Steve shook his head. Thinking about possibilities would drive him insane. He didn’t want that for the kids.
“Yes. I heard.”
“Tony, don’t apologize. It’s alright, sweetheart.”
“I’m trying to be kinder, yeah.”
“You remember that?”
He hated Tony for leaving them.
I still remember the way you like your coffee in the morning. Made from a pot because you’re old fashioned and utilitarian and no matter how I tried to get you into the habit of using the machine, you refused. No matter, I had thought, it’s just a small thing. Then, you refused bigger things so much so that those small things didn’t matter anymore. Well. I thought they didn’t. I remember. I remember the way you like your eggs and how you smell late at night.
Tony has had a glint in his eyes these last few weeks. Anytime Steve raises an eyebrow and probes him, he mime zips his mouth shut and turns away with a laugh, telling Steve that he’ll see soon enough.
“I’m alright. Shower then dinner?” Tony stands and hangs his track jacket over the chair. “Think I can bully Victoria into investing in room service?”
He’s gone.
There's nothing else to worry about except the car in front of him and the one in the rear view mirror. He doesn't have to succumb to failure or fight with anyone. All he has to do is control his grip, keep a foot on the petal, and drive. Steve can just be.
But Tony is still mourning.
Steve splutters, trying to go against Bucky’s firm hold, but it’s insistent and unyielding. “Buck, I gotta go feed the chickens and the horses.”
“Try,” Steve echoed, remembering the promise he made to Tony.
The open space of the Compound allows him to see the photographs of Tony, Riri, and Kate hanging in the next room over. Beside it, the walls are lined with bookshelves, and there, serving as a book end, is a photograph of all of them from Before. In that small patch of time in the Tower.
Steve isn’t prepared for this. When he asked Tony if he wanted to join him on this trip, he may have already known that the invitation would likely be declined. Still he asked and had hoped to be proven wrong. Even if this is what he wanted when he asked last night, he hadn’t let himself imagine Tony on the road with him.
“I never said that I was good,” Steve whispers, giving into the urge to push Tony’s hair back. “You did. But yes, I’ll take care of you.”
Steve waits a beat before answering, “You are.”
With glassy eyes, he looked at the mess of his home. There’s unwashed dishes and dirty rags spoiling the imported tables. Tony’s never been one for fancy china, but he’s a Stark through and through. His flat is a combination of stylish imports he inherited from his family and tools for his inventions.
As they all finish their task, Steve conjures a list of excuses to speak with Tony, alone. He comes up short, and is unreasonably irritated when Tony leaves the dining room without him in tow.
Steve’s saving the suits for Peter and Harley if they ever want it. He opened the drawer and ran a finger over Tony’s hoard of watches and sunglasses. Steve sighed. He’ll save that drawer for another day. Maybe Peter could help him and choose which ones he’d like to keep.
“Go on, give him a lick.” She scoots forward, squeezing one of Tony’s cheeks, and pulls it to the side. She tips her three fingers in, humming as Tony’s glistening hole flutters. Rumiko fucks her fingers in, twisting and turning with expert movement. Belatedly, Steve realizes she knows Tony’s body in a way Steve has only ever hoped to understand. She adds a fourth finger, hushing Tony. Her hands are smaller compared to Steve, but Tony takes it with a sense of familiarity, hole expanding against her knuckles. “You like that, baby? Feels good? I’m making you feel good?” She turns to Steve, pulling her fingers out and licking them clean. “You should have a taste. Go on, you’ll love it.”
It’s only now that Steve realizes he’s also exhausted, and while he’d rather have company during the duration of the meal, he’s used to eating alone by now.
Steve from before.
“Please don’t be so earnest about it.”
“Jesus, these journalists have no respect.” Bucky grunted.
You’re missed Steve. If that wasn’t obvious by my increasingly asinine letters.
“Come on, Stevie, we wouldn’t have ambushed you if we didn’t check in with Tony first.” Bucky knocks their shoulders and twists the knob to pull the window down. They’re hit by the fresh autumn air.
Belatedly, he realizes he’s sobbing. Snot drips down his chin, and he feels nothing but shame at the man he’s become: thin and starved and weak to even fight back.
He hadn’t taken the subway since he was thirteen because his brain refused to erase the twist of her face and the piercing scream. When Tony walked the streets of New York, he avoided staring at subway entrances. Not even a glance to check where they led or what lines ran that street.
“Matching set, huh?” Tony paused, hand up in the air. He still looked keyed up, but his eyes were red-rimmed and heavy.
I wish we could have this Cap here. But that Cap belongs to another time, another world, another generation of people.
Steve traces the shape of my eyebrows. A stream of tears fall from his cheekbones. “Better, that’s better.”
The receptionist talks his ear off for a good fifteen minutes. She says she hates living in such a small town in the middle of nowhere, describes this little place as a step up from the unincorporated Amish town five miles away, then directs him to a cafe that must still be open.
It’s you. you you you you you you you.
“Yeah, I hope it works.”
Steve walked forward and crouched beside her to observe the drawing. He’s been remiss on helping her with her shading technique. Steve didn’t draw much anymore.
Instead, he ignores Rumiko’s watchful eye and pretends it's just the two of them. Steve settles between Tony’s legs, caressing his sides, counting his ribs, one, two, three… Tony’s broken them so many times in battle—with the Mandarin, with Doom, with whatever crisis came up, it’s rare for Iron Man to come out unscathed. And yet, Tony’s always persevered, and came out on top, better than before.
Steve,
He wondered whether being Iron Man might be an addiction too. Because once you're an alcoholic, you'll always be one. You drop the bottle and tell yourself that you're better, but you've just replaced your addiction with a healthy obsession. Something socially acceptable.
It was back to the trains. There was the lady in red jumping and staring at him.
Tony wasn’t having a good day. His skin was tinted with sweat and his breath was ragged.
“You’ve kinda been an asshole, Steve.” Carol took two of the drinks and passed one to Pepper. “No offense.”
Tony wiggled forward, grabbing Steve’s neck and pulling him down for a kiss.
“Thank you.”
He floated without direction.
Steve walked to the closet, grabbed one of Tony’s shirts and boxers. He turned his back to Tony and stripped, all mechanical movements. The muscles of Steve’s shoulders stretched as he pulled the shirt off. Pants were next, and even with his bare ass in front of Tony’s eyes, there was no seduction, no playfulness.
He smiles remembering that she’s a great pick pocketer. Natasha parts the case in half, takes a stick, then lights it with a match he got from a corner store back in New York.
The sun over them, surrounded by flowers. What happened next? Steve would lie Tony down in the patch of grass and fuck him so hard that the flower crown with fall off his head.
Said I’m dead and forgotten.
Steve,
I was prepared for you to lose faith in me. To lose your respect, if I had it in the first place. I like to think I did.
Except this
Pepper and I. It’s nothing, Steve. It isn’t. It’s just two people grappling with loss because there’s not much else. This is all I have. All we have. We seek comfort in each other because the men we love are dead. Yeah, love, Steve. Love. I can’t even keep it.
Some insisted that it’s a second chance and welcomed her into their homes.
” Tony smiled, settling his hand on the counters.
There’s no escape. Steve didn’t want to leave anyway.
Steve looked down, registering the words for the first time.
Tony’s still loose from this morning. Steve dipped a finger, then two, pumping it in and out of Tony. The water continued to wash over them, scalding hot, the way they both liked it. Tony leaned against the shower tiles, tilting his ass up in invitation.
“I didn’t think you wanted to see me. We didn’t part on good terms in Asgard,” Steve added.
Steve pulled the covers to his chin. His first thought in the morning was Tony.
you.”
“Rhodey is still pissed he didn’t get invited, you know. But whatever.”
“I’m fine, Nat.”
Gone. Gone. Gone.
Suspended animation meant slowing life processes for survival. The body’s one last hurrah; an attempt to preserve life form without terminating life itself. But it meant living in the barest, most minimal conditions.
I cradle his face and trace the line of his nose.
They both stand and walk back to the truck.
“Nothing.” Tony shakes his head as Steve stirs the soup with an encouraging smile.
Tony refuses to call it an outhouse, claiming that it brings him flashbacks from summer camp. Steve knows for a fact that Tony's never been to summer camp, much less use an outhouse. Even in their trips to Yosemite, he still refuses to bathe in the lake. Steve recalls Tony renting a cabin in Yosemite's Upper Pines campgrounds just to access the private showers.
In the morning, Tony wakes up with a hangover. He’s naked in the guest room on the second floor. “Fuck,” he massages his temples and lies back down on the bed. He has a blistering headache that starts at the base of his skull and wraps around both of his eyes.
“Yeah, and they’re good for it too. Tony is a good teacher.”
Steve examined Tony’s messy hole. It gleaned with Steve’s spit. “You think you can take me without it? Are you still loose from this morning, sweetheart?”
“Tony,
And then, Tony said,
For Steve, there’s nothing but deferred and lost dreams, ideals twisted and run dry, but then he sees the rest of the world, all the life in this green house, and remembers the waitress telling him,
They spent the week talking, discussing whether they want to adopt or get a surrogate. There were many orphans in the world looking for a home. But selfishly, Steve insisted on surrogacy. He wanted to look at their children and see Tony’s features in their faces.
Tony walks over and sits between them. “Only the best for the best.”
Tony’s eyes land back on Steve.
Tony meets his eye for a moment, then walks on as the man appears on the sign, forcing them to cross the intersection. He looks up at the sky.
“Didn’t know Tigra would affect you so much.” Tony doesn’t know how long he sits on the floor, staring, wondering how many more.
Doesn’t wear Steve’s face. Doesn’t have the same set of blue eyes. Just a faceless creature, a blurry nobody who takes pleasure in brutality.
He licks Steve’s cock, ghosting it with his tongue, teasing before letting a mouthful of saliva drip, slow, slow, slow on his thick shaft. He watches the spit lick Steve’s dick, dripping down to his heavy balls. “Fuck. Steve.”
Steve shakes his head. “Are you sure it’s alright to drink?”
“Thanks, Tony.” Riri grins, flashing her teeth.
to hurt you. I did, Tony, and I’m so very ashamed.”
“I’m asking.” He walks two steps forward and waits. Tony’s wide eyes track his movements. “If you’d like to come. Like you said, see the country. How it’s changed. How it keeps going forward.”
He stands outside, back straight, stifling the uncertainty coiling in his stomach. This is nothing but goodbye.
Steve grips his hips, steadying him. He lets Tony go with a slight warning and observes the mess on the floor. Steve’s eyes are wide, and he exhales heavily, still hard. He stands in front of Tony, just inches away, fisting his cock. Steve’s boots settle on the puddle, and he smiles, eyes focused on Tony as he twists the head of his cock. “You’re so gorgeous when you let go, Shellhead.”
I’ve always wanted you, always, Tony doesn’t say.
steve, steve, steve,
It’s the cold he hates.
He throws me over the coffee table after punching my face bloody. When I try to sit up, he walks over, slow, like it doesn’t matter whether I live or die. He places his leather boot on my chest and presses my back into the broken glass.
Steve congratulates himself for holding back a quick retort. It wouldn't do any good, and Samuel appears to be a man who will fight him tooth and nail for agreement. He could really use a smoke now.
“Ex, though,” Steve repeats, emphasizing the pastness of it all.
“So, I say we celebrate kicking HYDRA’s ass with food from my favorite Mexican restaurant.” Tony clapped his hands together, unbothered at the dried up blood from his face. The face plate was ripped out of his helmet earlier. His lips were split and bloody.
There were people of all different ethnicities. A diverse set of languages filled his ears: Arabic, French, British English, Vietnamese. There was assortment of accents. Striking words said in hushed tones, high laughter. There were words dripping in sarcasm, a pointed remark, a yelp from a dog sitting in a tiny carrier beside a lady with a funny, feather hat. People dressed in fashion of different eras, reading books, tapping on their phones, cheering at a baseball game playing from another rider’s portable stereo.
“As long as your local newscaster doesn’t come asking for interviews, then that’s all fine.” Tony quips, pulling out a small toolbox from his back pocket. Steve nearly laughs at the sight. Tony is never without his tools.
He’s close and watching them is its own form of penance.
There’s the garden he’s trying to build again. It’s slow going but he had all the needed materials to start planting cucumbers again. The row of dwarf carnations haven’t fully bloomed, but there’s two white flowers, striking in a sea of greens. Steve took the petals and rubbed his fingertips on the stem.
With those brows of yours quirking.
“Next time Morgan fusses, I’ll get up, it’s my turn next, anyway.”
“Behave, Ironheart.” Tony squeezes her shoulder, then does the same to Kate. “Same goes for you, Hawkeye.”
His fingers fly over to touch the car’s roof. He’s always liked the color red.
“She’s been giving my men grief. Screaming in her cell. I’m surprised she hasn’t worn off her vocal chords.  Won’t stop biting,” Steve laughs, shakes his head. “She’d be a good Avenger. Has a lot of potential. Now only if she stop trying to make a bow and arrow out of what she can scavenge.”
Steve dropped on the love seat. “What’s up?”
Tony leans up, and Steve meets him halfway.
It isn’t different than now.
“Just be you,” Steve insists, reaching for her head. She lets him grab it and squeezes, hard, three times, then lets go.
“That’s now what I mean.”
“I did my best. I tried to live up to his memory,” It kisses Tony’s wrist, pulls him closer. Tony thinks It might be crying too. “I’m so sorry.”
I suppose,” Steve retorted, frustration evident in his voice.
He tries to offer some truth, forcing himself to look at Tony when he says, “I told you, war changes a person,” he reaches for his pocket. “I take xanax to help.”
“I will, Tony. I’ll be alright.” Steve promised, moving as close to Tony as possible.
“Doesn’t that say more about you, then?” Tony leans forward, teasing.
They still had their respective rooms in the Compound. But Tony had to go to the city at least twice a week for SI. Steve thought it would be nice to spend their off days in Manhattan. Be with the city’s grime and bustle.
“Well, sir, that’s Tony Stark,” Steve replies with what he hoped was a charming smile. It’s his best caricature of Captain America these days.
“What are you doing here?”
“Ok, back to my presents now!” Morgan held out the box calling their attention. Since she was the youngest, everyone in the family spoiled her rotten as if she didn’t have Tony and Steve trained.
“And we have the certificate to prove it!” Tony spun them around the room, once, twice, before settling on a slow rock on the balls of his feet.
With shaky fingers, he types out a long explanation that he promptly erases, hoping there’d be time for that later.
“I mean, is this just a pit stop, a place to get supplies and gas, or are you staying?” Kate puts an arm around Riri’s shoulder and juts her chin at Steve.
Steve wonders if he could have had this if he stayed.
Does he? No, not really. He doesn’t want to talk at all. He prefers the silence. Watching Tony work on his projects. Steve, tucked on the sofa at the corner of the workshop. Still there, but out of sight.
Tony leans his back against the counter and crosses his arms. “Thank you for helping.”
I know what Andromeda looks like and how the war to build an empire means losing sight of meaning.
“The kids go twice a month.”
“Now, please.”
I shiver when his large hands make their way down my nape. He pulls me closer until I feel his cock against the back of my throat. He doesn’t fuck my face, not yet.
For leaving.
Tony’s eyes are heavy-lidded with sleep. There’s a new freckle on his cheekbones. There are so many new lines surround his eyes now, and Steve tracks each one as a reminder that they’re both growing old together. When Steve looks at himself in the mirror, he sees new lines on his forehead. Creases on his cheeks. It pleases Steve every time he counts a new one.
He can’t stand to look at Steve and let him see—
“Why’d you do this?” She whispered, voice calm.
“Alright.” Steve closed the box and rubbed his sticky fingers on a napkin. He shifted closer to kiss Tony’s temple.
“Brat.” Steve smiled.
Tony doubles his efforts, impaling himself on Steve’s dick. Eyes on each other, Steve shifts forward to capture his lips, sucking on the bottom before nipping at Tony’s jaw. He plants his feet on the mattress and begins thrust up just as Tony drops down. Together, they work. An approximation of a conversation unspoken. A kiss here and long, drawn out moans, Tony keeps shaking Steve’s entire torso. Steve meets his gaze head on but Tony can’t decipher what Steve’s saying with the sound of their moans and the pleasure building in his balls. He can come from Steve’s dick alone. Steve’s orgasm must be building too because his pace quickens.
“I’m alright, baby. Happy. With you.”
“Carol, that isn’t your husband,” Red Wolf says with a frown.
There's no escaping a rotting cell when the rest of the world is prison.
Tomorrow, they’ll start the day together. Steve will grind the beans and Tony will hop on the counter. They’ll share a cup of coffee on the porch because the weather allows for it. Then, Steve will move the chicken coop across the property and spread the compost bin by the gardens.
“Why what?”
Walking the streets is like being flayed open, his edges rubbing against each other as Steve remembers the team’s first mission as Avengers together years ago. He wasn’t stateside when Thanos’ army attacked and Tony went to space. He only saw the crater the alien army left in Fifth Ave through the papers.
“Yes, dear. They’re still my little babies and you’ll spoil us rotten by making almond flour pancakes.”
“Green, as in like Dr. Banner?” Tony follows up, grimly.
“The first time’s hard enough, Pops. I don’t think he wanted us to see it again and again. We’d go insane.” Peter said.
He knows Steve is here by the smell of tar and sweat. He recognizes the tang of iron as blood. Again and again, Tony wonders who Steve killed this time. If it’s one of their friends.
“Isn’t it?” Steve raises an eyebrow, waiting for Tony to bite.
“Tell him yourself. That man’s gonna come knocking down your door now he knows where you live. At least for the next few days.” Her laughter echoes down the hall. “Goodnight. If you need anything, I’ll be downstairs, but my shift is ending in an hour, so don’t bother me after.” She gives them a cheeky grin as Tony closes the door.
“Alright,” Tony replied, shutting the door and leading them to the elevators.
I’ve been thinking about Baldwin again: “To defend oneself against a fear is simply to insure that one will, one day, be conquered by it; fears must be faced.” You quoted Mark fucking Twain, so let me give you Baldwin, alright.
Steve smiled. “Good.” He inched further away, Steve sat between Tony’s legs and arranged Tony to plant his feet on the sofa cushions. “Be good.”
One day, a man woke up and 70 years went by. His SHIELD-instituted councilors wrote that Steve was “coping well,” on his report. He was cleared for the field and only required to see the councilors once a month. He was normal. He was fine. Fury had him leading missions across the globe because his psychological assessment was deemed passable.
There’s a crease on his face, and once, Tony would have read it as concern, but now, he can’t assess this Steve with the same certainty.
Steve is leaving.
“St—”
Steve nods, standing to toe off his shoes. His jacket and shirt are next, fast and efficient, followed by his jeans and boxers, which he tears off in one quick movement.
He couldn’t excuse his behavior just because his husband died.
“Fine, sweet talker, you can go. But just for today.” Tony offers his palms and Steve hands him the plates. They’re quiet as they clean the rest of the kitchen. Steve clears off and rinses the table with a rag, returning to the kitchen just in time for Tony to start the dishwasher.
His feet carry him to the bathroom, and once he closes the door, he stands there, his heart irrationally beating too fast. He's glad that Tony can't hear it's roaring thump, though, if he just turned, he would have caught Steve's face.
“You work with Red Wolf and myself, you need to show the town your face,” she says, patiently. “Come on.”
“Ugh, just get over here.” Tony waves him over and points to the empty seat beside Peter. “Eat. And for your information, honeybear, I do not garden, I sit here and look pretty twirling a glass of juice while my husband does all the work.”
Steve wished they still had the one Tony picked out last year. But by late January, the tree dried and waned, drooping like a sad reminder that the holidays had passed.
He unzips his track jacket completely and wraps it against his waist.
“These are Armani, Steve.”
There was no cure. If he closed his eyes, he’d see the doctors shaking their heads with matching grim expressions.
“What is it?” he asked, moving the fingers with nails still stuck in them. His hand had stopped bleeding sometime ago. Every time he swung the bottle, he eyed the way his skin protruded. He tapped the bed to a beat, waiting.
“Good, then we can both shut up.”
Tony does what he wants because it’s just for tonight. He forces smiles and turns to face Steve. “Yeah,” he cards a hand on Steve’s already mused hair, settles it on his shoulder, and they walk back to their bed room, steps in sync. Hand in hand.
Steve’s mouth is sour, but I don’t complain because at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter. He’s him; I’m me; and we’ll both still be here in the morning. Steve leads the kiss and I follow him through the ride. It’s like flying. If I stop thinking, if I stop documenting his expressions, his likes and dislikes, then I’ll be fine.
“You’re a dream,” Steve says, interrupting Tony’s racing thoughts. “I’ve always thought so.”
Steve stares at Tony’s flushed cheeks, the dried spit on his beard. Steve wishes he could see the long lashes framing Tony’s eyes. He pulls his fingers from Tony’s hole and presses them to Tony’s mouth.
Tony pulled off, trailed the come from Steve’s hole over his torso. He leaned over Steve and pressed their mouths together. Steve groaned, tasting himself and as he opened his mouth Tony dropped Steve’s come into his awaiting lips. They kissed, exchanging come and saliva.
He stood, fixed the bed methodically, ensuring all the sheets were fitted in each corner. He tucked it into the mattress and the box spring. He put the duvet on top, fluffed the pillows just the way Tony liked it—fixing the decorative embroidered pillows they got from a trip in Thailand.
In a moment of clarity, he mimicked her gesture, then struggled to get the words out. “It’s left to me. I have to do something.”
“No, I’m there with you.”
“I know an excellent place that serves Menudo. Ever had that?”
“Key word, bud, volunteer. She’s got it,” Bucky says, pulling him to the truck.
It was almost amusing—his body was trying to compromise for what he lost by hurting itself.
“You think I’m awful? My people wanted nothing but a home. That's what all species across this banal existence ever want.”
Steve led them out of the showers. He wrapped a towel around his waist and dried Tony off.
Steve makes a disapproving sound. “We’ve bunked together before.”
But that isn’t true.
They woke up that morning with JARVIS slowly filtering in the light from their tinted glass window. It crept up into the room like a slow crawl, painting the wooden floors in light colors. Steve kissed Tony awake.
Tony was really annoying. He insisted on hiring cleaners for their brownstone in the city. Steve, who was raised to pick up after his own messes, refused. He firmly believed that washing dishes was soothing. It just had to be done. It took only a few minutes.
Natasha caught him moping in the Compound’s communal area and teased him for hours.
They weren’t wrong. He coddled Tony, gave him everything he wanted, and could never say no to him. Rhodes and Carol teased that Tony would become even more of a brat, but so what? He was Steve’s brat. Alive and healthy, that’s all that mattered.
“That’s good, that’s very good, yes,
“Why are you here? You already said we aren’t friends. We’ll never be friends again, you said. In Asgard, you punched me, you —”
“Tony, look at me for a minute.” Steve pulled the box from his pocket. With a laugh, he presented the ring to Tony. “How about we make that statement true?”
Steve hates it. The curve is all wrong.
Steve offers him a final peck on the mouth before reaching an egg. He cracks it on the side of the pan and they watch it sizzle for a moment before adding two more. The yolks are bright yellow, almost like the gold of the armor.
“Steve, please.” Pepper approached, offering a hand. She led them both to the sofa.
“Open your eyes, and look at me, Tony. Please.”
His lips are chapped. He’s thirsty. Hungry, maybe.
His eyes flash and Steve knows his next words have to be careful. He hates this. He hates that he has to choose his words, he hates that he can’t just say the first thing that comes to mind.
“Steve, I remember what happened,” Tony insisted, feeling raw and cut open. “I remember...”
I only know two things now.
“No, Stark. Do not think I do not want him, because I do. But it isn’t him, it isn’t. I close my eyes and I know who James is. This isn’t James...I think I’m going insane. I tried to speak with Carol about Rhodes, but she wouldn’t hear it.” she trails off, eyeing something over the mines.
This results in Johnny Storm gloating that his brother-in-law, Reed Richards, also has an AI, so it’s truly no surprise for Johnny to be bothered by FRIDAY.
“Hmm. My favorite way to wake up.” Tony opened his arms, gesturing for Steve to settle on top of him. “I love this, Steve. I love how we’re making this home. Thank you.” Tony blinked sleepily, likely still on the edges of his dream.
“The kids, yeah, but you, Steve, you need that too. Someone to help you process this. You can talk to all of us, but it isn’t the same. I think it would help.”
His heart stopped. He wanted to hit something. Scream until he couldn’t speak. Steve had the same fleeting thought, but it wouldn’t be the same, would it? It’s like what Pepper said about the Grandfather’s Axe. How much of it would remain as Tony when they’d upgrade the AI, make him more real, more human. Could it still be Tony?
I can’t fucking do this without you. You were the one that was supposed to be in charge. You’re the only one who could do this. I’ve tried. I really did. I committed. And shit, look where I am now.
Always,
“Hold me, Steve, just like this. Your arms around me. I want it to be just like this.” If it wasn’t for Steve’s enhanced hearing and his acculturation to Tony’s mumbling, then it would have been difficult to make out the words.
Tony had remembered this last night. Or the other day. Whenever it was that he had relented and started drinking. The memory came up unbidden. Unlike some memories that were only snapshots, his recollection of Steve was always graphic, even if incomplete.
Lost in a trace, he was sure Steve left the hotel, but there was the sound of the faucet running in the bathroom. It went on for a while, the white noise lulling Tony into a fitful slumber.
She was serious, she had no time for bullshit. He liked that about her. Seen a lot of other planets lost, she had said. She wanted to do good work. Steve respected that, but he couldn’t picture the scenery Tony supplied him with: Carole in a long white dress, Rhodes in his uniform, both of them dancing barefoot on the lawn of the Compound.
This is how Steve and Tony were. Are. Should be.
Steve still finds himself looking up at the sky, hoping that the suit of armor would fly over him, but it never does, so he pretends each shooting star breezing through the darkest nights is Tony, too.
Maybe then, he’d stop seeing her dead body in the corner of his eye.
Steve nods and sets down his cutlery, keeping his attention on Tony who suddenly refuses to meet his eyes. “Queens.”
“No.” Morgan and Harley repeated.
He always gave Steve the choice.
He took a deep breath. “I’m here about your parents.”
printed on it.
On Christmas night, they eat a small meal made by Tony following Iz’s recipe for chile relleno and beans. He’s fallen in love with Iz’s place, and spends some weekdays hanging around the restaurant and following Iz through the kitchen. Iz relates a time when Tony simply snagged an apron and started serving their patrons. Steve kisses him that night, falling beside him, teasing, as his hard working man.
Steve stays there for a while longer, and breathes a little easier.
“Shall I take pride in that? When will you kill me? After you’ve taken my other leg, my right hand?” I laugh, and it’s my own voice I speak to him with. “None of that matters, just this face right?”
“Happy’s driving as fast as possible, Ms. Potts.”
“But you’re happy.” It’s a statement, not a question, and Steve breathes out the words like a heavy refrain.
He definitely took someone home right now.
“I miss you, please let me say it,” He says, eyes subdued, voice feather light.
“I lead us there.”
There’s the garden to tend to, and Morgan will ask for breakfast, and what will the rest of the team eat? He’s about to argue and forcefully break away when Bucky adds, soft, “come on, Stevie.”
“I thought you already thought of me all day.” He grabbed the back of Tony’s thighs, angling it up. Steve got on his toes and began thrusting hard.
When he read about the war, he remembered Steve offering a handshake in the battlefield. Then, the EMP.
“The moment I fall asleep, Morgan starts crying or Harley demands attention, and I can’t sleep when they need me.” Tony twisted, and turned on the bedside lamp. He sat up, stripped his shirt and threw it past Steve.
I didn’t cry at my father’s funeral. I cried on the way home. Jarvis passed me an embroidered handkerchief with a yellow tulip. He let me keep it. At night, when I think of you and when I’m weak — it’s often — I turn away from staring at the bottle, crawl into bed, and soak that damned handkerchief until the tulip turns a darker shade.
She wears a large bonet over her head, so unlike her usual attire when they’re off running patrols with Red Wolf.
He lived in a city with eight million people, passing by hundreds of faces every single day, but he never felt as alone as the day Tony took his last breath.
She didn't look back.
“Me too. But everything is awful and fucked.” Tony rubbed a hand over his face because he couldn’t keep looking at Steve. If Tony held their gazes any longer, he’d never look away. Instead, his eyes traced the crown molding on the corners of the room and followed it up the walls, past the puddle on the floor, the chipped sink, and up the mosaic ceiling.
“It’s gonna be difficult, there’s no lie there. BARF should help with the traumatic memories. The only downfall is that one has to relive them, but the projection is supposed to help him work through the experience. His assigned therapist will help him make sense of the process, too.”
“I really do think you’ll love it. Being a father.” Tony turned the shower knobs and ducked his hair under the waters. He grabbed the soap and passed it to Steve without a word.
“What?”
He thrusted his hips up and rubbed the head of his dick. “Come on, baby. Are you gonna fuck me or not?”
Steve kissed it, once, twice, then ran a hand through Tony’s hair, feeling for the scar on the back of his head. “It’ll be okay, Tony.”
of his belt is indented in Tony’s ass cheeks.
Tony’s judgement in people is right for once.
Tony Stark.”
You asked me a question. That’s the answer.
“Do you trust me?”
Everything will be fine, Steve tells himself, and when it’s not, Tony will be by his side and they’ll handle it all together.
“I can’t just make Carol do it. It’s my responsibility.”
“Fuck,” Tony barked, twisting the cap open. He didn’t bother grabbing a glass to pour the whiskey into. “I really shouldn’t drink. Rhodey and Pepper will have my ass if they find out. So you won’t tell them, right, Cap? Well, no.” Tony tilted his head after a swing. He dropped the bottle with a slam that echoed through the room. “You don’t seem to be good at keeping secrets.”
“Sure thing, sweet thing.” Tony winked. He laughed when Natasha raised an eyebrow. She glanced at Steve, unimpressed, and left without another word.
“Sure, I’ll bully Harley into helping too,” Peter snorted. “Yeah, right.”
Tony doesn’t say.
“I didn’t.” Steve’s behind him now. There’s a puff of air raising goosebumps on his neck. A shiver runs down his spine and Tony has to bite the gasp trying to escape when Steve puts a hand on his hip. Tony closes his eyes, gives in, rests his head on the curve of Steve’s shoulders.
Steve swallows, stilling the hand on the front of his jeans, and forces himself to watch Tony’s blissed out face. The sound of his groans, the dirty things he begs for—
“Oh, here we go again. Is it gonna be a heavy emotional confession or are you horny? Because, baby, I could definitely go for a quick round at the outhouse.”
Steve swallows, thinking back to this morning and his run. But he doesn’t know how to say otherwise.
“What happened to you fucking my face?” Tony grabbed onto Steve, settling both hands over Steve’s shoulders. He pressed kisses from Steve’s jaw and down to his neck, sucking at the spot that always made Steve moan.
“God, we’re bad parents, huh? We let them stay up way too late.”
But the choice isn’t his to make because there’s a tap on the window. Natasha appears on the passenger side with a raised eyebrow. She knocks again, a tiny smile on her face.
Steve knew that once the Christmas lights were turned off later, he’d go back to the kitchen and examine the lines in their little make-shift cookbook.
“Shut up, Steve. Shut the fuck up, please.”
. Claiming that orgasm as his and his alone. Not Rumiko’s, not even Tony’s. It’s just for Steve. He keeps twisting his fingers, thrusting in and out, until Tony falls back on the mattress with a satisfied laugh.
He can’t help but wonder if there’s any of him in her too, whether that will come around as she grows up and becomes who she is meant to be. He knows she’ll be her own woman, not a person bound by both deeply profound and paralyzing legacy. He can’t wait to meet the woman she’ll become, too. Steve hopes like hell that he’ll be around for that.
In lieu of speaking, Steve switches lanes, then signals back to the right to return to his original position. They've passed the high traffic volume of Cleveland and are now somewhere deeper into the state.
Would Steve count the minutes until his death? His children will likely come to pity him, see the shell of a man he’s become. Maybe, Harley already did.
Before all of that, there was Tony.
There’s people like Iz and Augusto who offer their friendships easily. There’s the usual kids who run around town sticking their tongues at him. There’s little pockets of happiness that give evidence of their work as worth it.
He might count five if he stopped lying to himself.
The place of death on the certificate could be more precise.
He managed it all—meals, sleeping schedules, projects, their education. Steve was doing it all himself. What else did they want?
But you died, he doesn’t say.
“Why do you make things so difficult for yourself? Come on, get up.” She dropped to the bed and reached for his hand. She wiped her face. “Fuck, Tony. Let me get these off.” Carol looked around, eyeing the tools beside the half-finished gauntlet. “Can I use this —”
He grabbed Tony’s tie and pulled him for a kiss. Wrapping his hand on the silky red tie, he ran his fingers through Tony’s hair, pulling softly. His fingers made their way to the back of his skull and Steve felt the ridges of the scar on his head.
“I know. You don’t gotta tell me that.” Tony pushes his plate back, burger only half eaten. “Even after all these years, it’s still there. I carry that shit with me.”
Tony doesn’t bother wiping his eyes. He curls into a ball, arms going to hug his knees.
Steve is shocked, but only for a moment, then, he's licking his lips with a fleeting smile.  He moves on top of Tony, lining their bodies, pressing their chests together. He’s inches away from Tony and he’s about to say something, instead he uses his thumb and forefinger to force Tony’s mouth open. He spits into Tony’s panting mouth,  slow like honey pouring out of the jar. “I prefer you spitting at me in another context.”
It’s just any other day. Steve had to live. He had to move on. It would get easier, he hoped. It was a flat-out lie that the living liked to believe.
Tony drops the spoon by the saucer and pushes off the tray. He turns to face Steve. There is nothing physically noticeable. No changes to catalogue but there’s a feeling in his gut he cannot write off as grief.
Tony stays silent, cataloguing the scuff on Steve’s boots, all the closed pouches on his utility belt, the determined frown on his face. There was a time when they walked the streets, shoulders brushing against each other, with the firm belief that they’d always be friends. Now, Tony doesn’t know if there’s anything left.
SHIELD found him in the Arctic. He survived because the serum preserved his body.
“There’s that support group in Brooklyn. The one Sam mentioned?” Pepper said. Her eyes were red-rimmed again. Steve wondered how she had so much control over her features. He’s never seen the tears fall from her eyes since the funeral. “Give it a shot? It might help be around other people who are going through the same situation.”
He suspected Carol gave him the room number. If he hadn't answered, Steve would have broken down the door.
Natasha knocks and picks the workshop’s doors open. Gone is the bonnet she wore when James returned. She’s wearing her riding boots. Pistol on her hip.
“STARK!” His name is called repeatedly from below followed by a series of rapid knocks. “GET DOWN HERE!”
“Gross.” Harley said, not looking up from his potato gun.
It’s paralyzing to speak.
He thinks Tony might have smiled back in the day, amused at Steve’s flustered state, but he doesn’t now. Instead, his eyes remain on Steve’s own as if he’s trying to stop himself from looking Steve up and down.
And because Tony asks him for it, that’s exactly what Steve does. He sits up on his haunches and kisses Tony’s waiting lips.
Tony interrupts, words forced, “There’s a certain joy in driving too fast. But you have to remain safe. Level-headed about it.”
Rhodes hummed, ruffling her hair. His face was grim, but he smiled at her. “Looks very pretty on you.”
It was the second Tuesday of the month. This was their third attempt to use BARF on Bucky.
“Oh fuck, I’m coming, yes, Tony, keep going.” Steve lifted his hips as Tony rubbed his prostate. He came in thick spurts inside Tony’s warm mouth. That fucking mouth of his. “Fuck.”
“Ok then,” Tony says, the words coming out drawn out. “Bye. See you.”
Steve looks up. His lashes are wet, and Tony wonders if Steve also cried on the way to whatever underground hole he’s hiding in. On his way back to the Tower, Tony snapped the helmet back on and pretended that the saltiness and heavy breaths fogging up his sight was just sweat.
Now, he doesn’t know if he ever had that.
Steve observed the empty pots stacked in the corner of the roof, packages of soil lining the east wall. “Where do you think I should start?” He couldn’t fathom where to begin. Even with his eidetic memory, he can’t remember what his life was like before Tony.
The waves crashed without remorse. All he could do was stay half-wake, half-asleep, immobile as the wreckage passed.
He recounted that evening to another person, one who didn’t wear a badge or carry a baton or asked him why his parents let him roam around the city so late.
“Yeah,” Steve says, because he knows the platitudes are ineffective by now. “But you’re still here. The rest of you.”
Dried blood on the dirt, washed away by summer rain.
It was his senses messing with him. There was a discrepancy between what his eyes saw and what he sensed.
Steve forced his eyes open as he hammered into Tony. He watched Tony’s fingertips escape from his fucked out mouth. Steve came with a groan and dropped his head to the sofa cushions.
“Tony, Bucky—it wasn’t his fault. I’m not sure how much he remembers.” Steve pinched the space between his eyebrows. He sighed, then glanced up at Tony. “Or if he even remembers me at all. I think he does. He could have taken a shot at me but he didn’t—I think…”
Everything was fine. Everyone said holidays were hard.
“And you aren’t being mean,” Steve continues, watching Tony serve a plate, and place it in front of Steve. “Oh.” He glances down at the humble serving then back at Tony.
Was Steve that obvious? Did Tony know?
“Maybe that’s what I want,” Tony cried, gesturing to the room. He didn’t bother wiping the tears on his face. He was so sick of crying, he was sick of remembering, he was sick of his brain telling him what he did wrong, and how he wouldn’t have changed a single thing.
“Tony. That’s not.” Steve tried, moving closer to the bed. He dropped on the foot of the mattress. “I didn’t mean that, Shellhead.”
“DUM-E dropped it.” Morgan and Peter looked at each other with a determined nod.
He’d stare at his children, feeling defeated and enraged that Tony
“Couldn’t even afford salt,” Steve says, honestly. “Just grateful I had food on the table to feed my skinny bones.”
Tony’s back is to him, and he’s staring at his own wall. His breath, quiet, measured.
“And then, everything will be fine?” Steve brought Tony’s hand to his chest. They were strong, calloused, and filled with scars. Tony’s survived Afghanistan, the wormhole, and hundreds of missions.
He wanted to tell her the truth—no, he’d never be ready; no one was ever ready to live their lives alone. Tony could come up with hundreds of research articles showing Morgan how humans were social creatures and evolved in community.
There was no other sound in the room except their moans and skin slapping against each other. “Ugh, baby, I love when you're so deep inside.”
I just poured a bottle of Black Label. It’s easy to dip a finger and run the liquid on the rim. Easy to put it on my lips too. Just a taste. Not too much. No, I won’t do it. Already did. Sorry. Sorry, goddamnit, sorry.
Steve wears the judge’s robes. He’s the single voter on the verdict, and he’s the one who puts the noose around my neck. The rope is his fingers closing around my neck.
“Alright.”
“How about that, Tony?” Steve asks, peering over the man. They’re nearly the same height, but Tony’s still blocked by the truck’s hood.
Steve slits my throat, just like I wanted, and I smile because I’m wearing Tony’s face as he kills me.
890 Fifth.
Steve must be bluffing. He doesn’t have them.
He was a goddamn mess, dizzy with the fear of facing life alone.
“Hush, baby. Just relax. We’ll take care of you. We’ll take care of everything.” Rumiko dips down, kissing the mole in the middle of Tony’s back.
Pepper didn’t know a single thing, who cared if she was one of the smartest women in the world. “None of you know the half of it.”
Tony sobs harder. He hits Steve’s chest, and it’s useless because he’s so weak these days. Not enough food to make him strong. It sustains him just enough so he can’t resist Steve when he enters him.
“No need to say that.” Steve tries to smile and fails. Tony doesn’t owe him anything, in fact, it’s Steve that has a list of things to apologize for, so much so, he doesn’t know where to begin. Steve’s hand automatically drops to his pocket where he feels the old, battered flip phone. Tony follows the movement, and realization seems to dawn on him, too.
He turned back to Steve. “You have the kids, baby. You’ll always have me. Be safe, Steve.”
“I saw the end, baby,” Tony starts, gripping his shoulder and working his hips faster.
“What happened, Tommy?” Tony jogs forward, wishing they brought their horses.
Tony cries, shakes his head frantically, his soft cock bouncing against his thighs. “I can’t —”
“I know.”
Tony kissed his cheek, licking at teardrop. “I’m not leaving you, Steve. Not for a long time. I promise, alright? We have all the time in the world.”
Tony holds the door open for Steve, eyebrows raised. “You mean like you are?”
“No, say it, going to be like what?”
He jumps up and runs out the workshop, with It behind him. He doesn’t have time to put on the armor because the screaming and crying from the townsquare continues.
“No, no, you’re not coming yet. You’re gonna come on my dick. While my dick is so deep inside you. So be good, baby, and suck.” Tony pulled his hair and used the movement to move Steve’s face back and forth over his dick. “Steve, you’re so good.”
“Well, dad always said you weren’t allowed to do a bunch of things, but you did it anyway.”
It’s no longer enough.
No, how could Tony forget the nights Steve slammed him down onto the mat, then, their mattress, crafting bruises along Tony’s wrists and thighs.
“Good morning, papa.” Morgan climbed on his lap. Peter and Harley flanked their sides.
you, always.
“I can’t go on without him, Nat. I couldn’t know how to live without him. You spend your whole life building a future with someone.” He searched his eyes, lost. They’ve all lost people, but goddamn, this was Tony. He barked a wet laugh. “He is a futurist and—no, he
“Obviously.” Tony huffs, letting the tension disappear. “Having kids around… they need regular meals and I’ve been bullied as the cook.”
Natasha bumped his shoulders like she used to when they were getting ready for battle. Maybe Steve was preparing for war. It seemed like every day was a fight to live.
“Hi, baby, what’d you bring me?” Tony beckons them both over a hand. Its red and gold coloring shines against the sky.
It had to be.
“Tough way to live,” she observes, opening her window to flick out the ash. “You trying to die?”
Natasha fetches him from one afternoon and suggests a walk.
Tony leans back on his hands and sticks his tongue out. “Shut up, you romantic.”
“I wish I could lie beside you every night. Wake up to you in the morning. Live the beautiful life we have. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The worst thing I’ll do.” Tony grasped Steve’s jaw, turning it with a light touch. He traced Steve’s lips with a cold fingertip.
“Steve?”
Natasha hops in. “Hey there, stranger.”
No, stop, he shakes his head and settles on the lumpy mattress, cross-legged. He’s stripped down to his boxers and day old shirt, placing the tobacco on the paper and rolling it. His jeans and jacket hang on the back of a chair, limp.
He’s deep in the Arctic, kicking his feet against the force of the water, raising his hands until his muscles tire, reaching. He’s grasping for land; asking for air; wanting freedom.
Steve pressed the head of his dick in and pulled back. He sighed; he didn’t want to hurt Tony. He scanned the room for anything that they might use as lube and gave up. He cupped a hand under his chin and spit, hard.
Steve laced their fingers together, keeping them on his thigh. He can do that now. “Can I kiss you?”
Rumiko cuddles Tony, rubbing his shoulders and kissing him. Kisses him where Steve’s mouth was. She mouths at his collarbone, flicking at Tony’s nipples with a laugh.
Tony has always been independent, tending to his wounds alone. But here he is, asking Steve to give him more. Hope burgeons in his breastbone, but it's short lived. There was once a time Steve told the world to stay loyal to the dream. Now, he knows that on the other side of that dream is disappointment.
Steve drops his head on Tony’s chest, groaning, rubbing his sticky fingers on Tony’s still hard cock. He takes their come between two fingers and rubs them on Tony’s lips, slowly thrusting his fingers inside Tony’s mouth. Once Steve is satisfied, he kisses, marveled at the taste of their mixed come.
“I came to just tell you about your parents. I understand if you don’t want to take any part of this. You shouldn’t have to—”
Anything else was said behind closed doors. In Steve’s deadpan. In his eye rolls that were softened with a small tilt of his lips. In the safety of Steve’s old apartment that Tony paid for so no new tenant would claim his belongings. In the quiet of the night.
“You like my pout, Steve.” Tony winced, sitting further up on the propped pillows. He moved a bit, rearranged himself, and let the kids eat.
“You alright, Peter?” He stared at the kitchen counter. Their house was a mess. Used tissue paper was thrown haphazardly all over the floors, dirty dishes in the sink, a mountain of letters addressed to the Rogers-Stark family offering condolences from fans and the public.
“Steve, I thought you didn’t — ”
But that’s always been the case.
Steve hums a quiet tune, like they’re back in the Mansion on 890th and he’s showing Tony his sketches.
The room is quiet, but if he focuses, he can hear the static of the matching tv across the room. The channel is local; the news anchor talks about a festival two towns over unveiling a monument listing the names of those that disappeared from their county.
“Sorry if I was short with you earlier. It’s just. Well.” Tony clasps the edge of the sink.
Tony lets the pride settle in his chest. He’s fucking Captain America into silence. A hand slips to hit Steve’s chest. He wants to spit on it so bad. If Steve was still wearing his suit, Tony would aim for the goddamn star.
He washed his face and uncapped the mouthwash. He dumped the contents down the drain. It would be too easy to drink it. Too easy to go down the hotel bar and drink.
Tony doesn’t open his eyes, but there’s a small sad smile on his face. “You can hope, then.”
There’s a burning in his lungs kin to smoking, but there’s no nicotine rush to follow this time. The air of the room is suddenly heavy now, and Steve wonders how they can go from a brisk walk, talking about nothing but the layout of the town and its people, to being here, surrounded by no one else but each other.
Steve’s husband — his husband, oh, he’ll never get used to the endearment — is grumpy today. Tony wears a frown despite the heating blasting from the truck. Steve knows that in days like this, when it’s freezing, Tony’s shoulder starts to ache with phantom pain.
“The townspeople,” Red Wolf says, standing straighter to flash his badge.
Steve had everything now: a home, a life, a family, and everything was right in the world.
“It’s fine. It’s alright, Steve,” I say, examining how his eyes look for mistakes in my form.
Steve felt the same exact way whenever he watched Tony in a tank top inventing something in the workshop. His hair would be crazy and he’d smell like a mix of his expensive shower gel, sweat, and oil. Seeing Tony in an inventive workshop binge always made Steve hard.
Steve kisses his belly button and gets off the bed. He grabs his clothes from the nightstand and dresses without a word.
“For this.” He scrubbed his face again. “There’s more. HYDRA infiltrated SHIELD. They’re so embedded into the organization that it's hard to distinguish who reports to who. Natasha and Clint are there now tracking and making maps regarding those in power… we could use your help, Tony.”
“Was this how Tony looked at you when you —”
. Steve wants to be able to do that, wants to verbally communicate how pleased he is with Tony's body taking him so well, wants to declare that he's so happy to be in this moment.
She pressed once, twice, three—four times.
God, Steve was falling apart and his kids were the one taking care of him. They’re so young, they needed to be protected from this—Steve was the one who was supposed to check on them, make sure they got enough to eat, that they were sleeping alright. He was the one who was supposed to take them to their doctors appointments, to soccer games, make sure they did their homework.
Tony's eyes shut, and he squirms when Steve presses on his abdomen. "I love seeing you lose it," he whispers to Tony's ear. "Come on, for me, let go, Tony."
SHIELD established standards of handling crime and crisis. He wasn’t allowed to question Fury’s authority and had to blindly trust the man. He didn’t understand how Natasha and Clint followed along. He was a soldier, so he was well-versed on keeping his mouth shut. But Steve reached the limit when his powers were just used to contain crises without question.
Gum on the concrete and the smell of foul garbage in scorching New York summers. Sometimes, Tony thought that might be all he had left. This tiny corner in the world, an island full of people who either despised him so much they called for him to be hung for war crimes or to be  put in the category of a hero.
“God, Stevie, please, don’t flirt in front of me.”
“So be it,” It says, voice determined.
“Darling, you don’t have to hope.”
Except, they don’t talk about that.
him. I’m sorry, Pepper, but I’m a selfish man, I won’t lie about that. I begged him to find a cure. Extremis, maybe? He perfected that, didn’t he? But no, it wasn’t— he said it wouldn’t work. Sometimes I feel like he gave up but I...He wanted to die human.”
Steve should be used to this suffocating silence by now, but he’s not. Once he’s in the car, he opens the glove compartment to shove the flip phone inside, rolls down the window and begins the drive towards the coast.
“The way you reacted.”
It would do. Better to numb his brain rather than swim in the murky waters of loose images he couldn’t exactly remember.
He’s still trying to figure out how to take his steps with Tony. What steps he’s allowed to take, what minefields have to be avoided for them to ease into friendship again.
“They’re protective of him.”
“Not everything.”
“I’ll be quick,” Steve says, averting his eyes as Tony yawns.
“Went South then west. This time, I’ll go North then west.”
Steve’s running his fingers over Tony’s hair, chanting words that sound like
All it is now is a quiet surprise that fizzles into thin air. Tony couldn’t catch it and hold it between his palms if he tried. Steve is always turning away, and Tony’s always left watching his figure get smaller and smaller as the distance between them expands, so much so that there’s an ocean of problems between them.
Tony shoves the menu to the side, and it’s just them now, nothing else to distract them from cataloging each other. No road to focus on, no view to divert their attention to.
Steve tries changing the topic. “Thor?”
In the shadows of the night, the city kept moving. He filtered out alerts from Exremis and focused on Steve. He refused to glance at the dark corners of the room, lit up only from the bathroom’s light.
Now, Steve lived his life suspended in gravity. Trapped in ice, his whole world was frozen.
Tony thought being Iron Man might be that. At least he would be doing good in this world.
They’re fucking, and it’s explicit and obscene, and Tony is making filthy sounds that go straight to Steve’s cock, but he can’t help the pang of envy that tugs at his chest when Tony turns his head to capture Rumiko’s lips, soft and sweet.
Instead, he licked his ice cream cone, eyes averting from Tony’s profile.
“I will.”
Harley found them that way, arms all around each other, eyes red-rimmed. He walked into the living room with an air of defiance that reminded Steve of Tony. He stood on his toes, shifted the tonearm, and played the record.
Fuck.
“You look like you need comfort. You saved me there, I’m just returning the favor,” Tony looks down at their hands, then removes his fingers. Steve can’t tell from the darkness, but he wonders if Tony is blushing. His movements are soft, laguid due to the alcohol and whatever cocktail of drugs he’s taken inside the beach house.
“It’s gonna be a lot of work, yeah.” He bumped Tony’s shoulder. “Thanks for doing this, Tony. I appreciate it. Not just this,” he looked at the panel, documenting the different buttons, too anxious to meet Tony’s gaze. “I’m grateful for everything else.”
Somehow it felt like those mornings when Morgan had a nightmare and she’d crawl into their bed asking to be cuddled. Tony would snuggle her and push her hair back as Steve kissed them both, wishing them sweet dreams. Then, in the morning, Tony would roll out of the mattress, bed headed and demanding breakfast.
“Hmm. But you came back after only a couple of weeks.”
On the desk across from him is an Iron Man helmet.
Steve waits until Tony’s ready before taking his first bite. Flavor explodes in his tongue. “’S good.”
Home is something that keeps people warm, especially when they’re at war and too busy getting their heads blown off, limbs chopped off, forced into camps and tortured, kept as prisoners of war.
“Really? From here it looks like you want to punch me. Come on, Steve. Do it. No one will say a word. This is a discreet hotel made for those with surnames backed by money. Even if they can’t serve me alcohol, they won’t say a thing about screams that come from closed doors. I deserve it."
Heat crawls up his spine, and he vomits on the bedpan.
“I love you, more.” Steve sat up, letting the sheets pool over his waist. “You want breakfast in bed with them?”
She opens the doors and waves him forward. “Come on, you have to face the jury now.”
But Steve couldn’t register the platitudes. It felt like the end of the world.
They were a mess of tears.  A portrait of a recent widower with his three kids crying.
The door shuts. The facet turns on. There’s a single heartbeat that isn’t his own.
Steve climbs into the driver’s seat and rests his hands on the steering wheel. He grips it for a beat and imagines himself driving further and further up north with no doubt in mind. He’ll only be there for a few days, and if he’s not allowed to enter, at least he can sleep in the back. Steve fiddles with the rear mirror, catching the way the back seats have been removed. The rest of the interior serves as an open space.
“Oh.”
Harley followed Tony around in the workshop and around the house that Tony got into the habit of calling him Shadow.
“Love you more.” Steve kissed his neck and ran a hand through Tony’s mused cowlicks.
“Is that really so hard to believe?”
And he took Steve’s with him.
He was never going to go through loss again. Steve wouldn’t bury his kids. He would die and they’ll have to put his body to rest. He won’t suffer the pain of burying another person in his life. This was the last time.
“You’ll love it. Rice, beans, grilled chicken.” Tony made a kissing sound and padded to check on Clint and Natasha. “You gotta get my favorite though, chile verde. But come to the Tower for that. I have a recipe from an ex-girlfriend’s grandmother.”
Steve hummed, kissing the top of his head. “Yes. It’s a nice song. It’s our song. That doesn’t change anything. You’re right, Harley.”
He swept the floor, waxed it, then dusted the art pieces. Steve stacked some of the books from the coffee table, tucking them to the shelves. He ran a hand over the spine of some of his favorites, picking up some books at random. They were Tony’s collection, a hodgepodge of books ranging from sci-fi, biographical, to journal annuals.
Steve whispers a moment too late.
“Because fuck you.”
Tony hadn’t heard that name in so long.
He tries and tries and tries to bury the past, how he used to be fucked, how Steve wasn’t always kind, deep inside him. Pushes it down. Tries to rewrite the memories, then fails.
He’s wearing simple clothes. Not the ones that are stained with blood, grime, and mud. His hair is bright yellow, even paler under the sun.
“All we can do is try to be better.” Her voice is flat, and it’s only now that he realizes she must be angry at him.
Steve closed it, inhaled, held his breath, exhaled.
“Don’t blame me!” She twisted around the suit and lifted Steve’s sketchbook. “I was drawing Harley and Peter.”
It’s warm. Temperature controlled. The left side of the house there are large buckets of soil, fertilizers, and an installed table filled with floral trimmings.
“Fuck, fuck, I’ll come, you’ll make me come—” Tony tightens his hold on Steve’s hair. “Oh, fuck, fuck, yeah, yeah. Yes, there, please, please.”
Steve didn’t know how much time passed, but he was resolute in seeing Tony Stark tonight. He slammed a hand down, folded the pages of notes neatly and pocketed them. Steve put on his jacket, grabbed his briefcase, and headed out.
I’ve already lost my right foot by trying to escape in the early weeks of this imprisonment.
Steve is lost. There’s a hundred different things he wants to say to express what he feels, but Tony simply nods, as if understanding what Steve means unspoken. “I saw the end. Then, there was you. You were all I thought of. All I ever think of.”
Steve groaned, jacking Tony off. He was a dirty bastard. He circled the rim, before pressing a finger in. He pumped it in and out, using his other hand to fondle with Tony’s cock head.
“Alright.”
It’s the ninth Monday of the new year. Mondays mark the start of the week, something new.
She accepts, and lights both their sticks with the matches from the cupholder.
It was supposed to protect and enhance his mind and yet, Steve Rogers struggled to reconcile with the fact that his husband was dead. It was supposed to perfect his mentality but it failed. Steve was weak for Tony, driving himself to recollection of their shared life together.
Up ahead, there’s a house with a plum tree on its front lawn and two kids stooping low on the grass. They wave and make faces at Steve, and he wonders what it’s like to be them, free with innocent wonder.
Steve sat back on his heels and pulled Tony’s stapled hand towards his chest. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t even look at Tony. Steve examined the unnatural curl of his hands and unlike Carol, he didn’t bother with the pliers, he just pulled them out without warning. Steve dropped the nails onto the coffee table and wiped the blood from his hand. He reached for Tony’s shirt, unbuttoned it, ignoring all protests, and removed it.
“She wanted to meet you.” Kate shrugs, then snickers, “Don’t know why.”
Fucking Stark, stupid fucking Stark. He hears them, and he can’t find it in himself to stop listening to how this is all his fault. Just because he believed Steve, and he thought…
Our protagonist is flying high on a plane in a free country ruled by a dictator. He’s sitting next to an Ambassador who’s called a communist sympathizer. Funny, I’ve been called the opposite as Director. Facist, pig, the journalists printed and hollered at me in the streets. Anyway, this Ambassador's wife wrote a letter to
They’re no longer battle-ready. Worn out and faded from their fight earlier, they crumble. A pretty sight that comes apart at the seams. Steve looks at him, eyes wet, an apology goes unsaid.
Steve leaves, and doors open and shut and open and click shut again. He returns with a tablet and a small, hand mirror. He places the latter on the pillows and makes Tony face his reflection.
Places to be, so he doesn’t have to face the fact that he’s all alone.
I fade away, and die with my own face.
Steve;;;
Parker stayed in their farm, but Drew and Lawson surveyed town and insisted on lending a hand with the building of a school.
“I killed the one that wore my husband's face,” Natasha says, simply without remorse. Her jaw is set and she cocks the pistol. “I’ll kill the rest of them, too. Now move out of the way, Danvers.”
“I have to —” Tony sobs the words out, hating how he can’t keep his mouth shut. His abdomen is starting to hurt, and his face heats all the way from his crown to his nape.
“If dad doesn’t have a bedtime, then why do we?” the kids had asked. “What happened to giving us our autonomy?”
“You know, you dad said something along those lines too.” Steve choked, not bothering to hide the sob that escaped him. “You’re both right.”
The choice to end it all.
Tony scrubbed his eyes and sighed. “I don’t want to miss anything. Not even it comes to the kids. When it comes to our family. I wish I could build something where I’ll never miss a moment. Is it crazy, Steve? That I want to witness everything. God,” Tony huffed, his mouth twitching into a smile. “Fuck, is this what it feels like to be happy, huh? To have everything you need—want—in life.”
“Because I’ll believe it.” Tony snorted. “Sometimes it’s a dangerous thing to have hope.”
Steve moved again, pushing his hips up as Tony grounded down. Panting, Steve pulled at Tony’s dick until he came with a loud moan. Tony grabbed his come from Steve’s stomach and brought it to his mouth, sucking and cooing at the taste.
“It sounds like a good life.”
“You feel so good,” Steve says, getting in between Tony’s legs. He kisses Tony’s jaw line, slow, soft, almost delicate. Tony grinds up on him with closed eyes. The movement is unhurried and slightly sloppy. Both his hands are on the sand.
Steve hates Los Angeles, but he wouldn’t be here if not for Tony Stark.
Steve could see Tony’ massive design sprawling against the blue lake glittering under the sun. Throughout the west, there are already trees of all kinds, pines and oaks. “What about a cherry tree?” Steve asked, one hand going to his hips. He could already imagine the area milling with people. A team. New recruits to be trained. “Maybe on that rose bush.”
Steve maneuvers Tony to lay his head over his shoulder.
“Do you really want to do that now?” Tony looks up at him. “You should get some sleep before your trek.”
That he’d be missing Harley’s first day in high school. Peter’s graduation. He wouldn’t be here to help Steve move the kids into their college dorm. Soon, Harley and Morgan would follow, and Steve would pick out the beddings and the decor without Tony. He’d have to do all of that, alone.
“Do you always ask such difficult questions?” Tony rolls his eyes. He bends to grab his bag, reorganizes the contents, then falls to the wicker chair by the window.
She snaked one hand on his back and one under his knees, lifting him with ease. “We’re going. We’re gonna get you help. Hold still, alright?”
Life was a thread in which people were cut. Steve’s life was patterned over Tony’s own, even if they lived different worlds, had different lives, had lived different centuries.
Well.
“Shut up,” he whispers, voice harsh. Half of this face is bloody. Steve wipes it, props me up, and leans down to kiss me. Him. His face. Tony’s forehead.
Morgan attends school in the city with Pepper from Monday toThursday, and then on Fridays, Pepper and Tony somehow convinced the school to allow Morgan to have Fridays as home-schooling days. She’s a little genius already, spending time with her father in the workshop or doing her work in their kitchen table as Steve does the washing up.
There’s a bedpan in the corner of the cell. No showers. Steve still fucks him even when he hasn’t been washed in days. Sometimes he relents and one of the guards enter the cell and hose Tony down like the animal he’s become.
It’s frightening to enter the place and witness how it’s been transformed. Without him. He’s afraid that he might be the only one who hasn’t changed.
It’s all fine.
Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve.
“Dammit, Tony.”
He cradles Tony’s face, willing the veil away so he can see those eyes. Blue, steady with resolve. It's always been that shade of blue, a seafoam he'd seen on the edges of a beach in France. But the center of his eyes are sharp, like the blue of a bluebird chattering away in the morning.
Tony pulled their intertwined hands and kissed her little fingers. He squeezed it three times before setting it back down on the table.
"Then you got here."
“She did.” Tony shrugs. “I just didn’t think you’d actually come.”
Christmas is a small affair between them. Peter is with May, but he FaceTimes them for over two hours, chatting about his first semester at NYU. Tony is still a bit sore that he traded off being  a Beaver to a Bobcat. But Steve reminds him that their kids have to make their own decisions and make their own paths, no matter how they wish they were both there every step of the way. Morgan keeps popping up from the screen to tease him about MJ and Peter’s new friend, Johnny Storm.
It felt like a mausoleum to return to the Compound with the day staff all gone, disappeared into a void or fleeing to their homes, to their families, trying to make sense of this new life they’re supposed to live.
Steve laughs and flips the eggs. “I’m no farmer.”
Tony doesn’t drink it. He sets it down and he tries not to cry.
Whenever there’s a crisis, Steve entertains these passing thoughts.
“Good morning, beloved.” Tony pawed at Steve's chest and settled on the space under his arms and ribs.
Steve got dressed, dropped the towel to the laundry basket, and got to work.
“No,” He shook his head immediately. They couldn’t take the kids. He didn’t want to be alone. “That’s alright. We’ll manage.”
All that’s left in the cabinet is his deodorant, toothbrush, razor, and —
When Steve finally turned to look at Tony, his eyes were red rimmed and his body was tense.
“My sister keeps telling me I just need time,” one of the attendees, Imogen, said.
Tony’s smiling so wide that his gums were showing. “Yeah. You didn’t know? It’s so obvious! He’s always following her around even though he pretends not to. She’s always got her eyes on him even though she acts like she’s just inspecting him for weapons. So obvious.” Tony popped the end of the ice cream cone in his awaiting mouth.
And yet, this is it: this is what people do. He's traveled so far, away and away, with no direction. Nothing but the dream, only but the dream. Now, it appears to be half-baked ambitions. He suspects this is it, this is the best the world can have: trite, boring, everyday life.
The tide washes over.
That’s what this place was meant to be. Only, it didn’t last long. When he entered the conference room, flanked by Natasha and the rest of his team, he had a hand on his belt, alluding to an air of authority he didn’t truly possess. He realized then, that no, this wasn’t home anymore. A base of operations, perhaps.
“Why is that?”
The sun continues to rise, drying the damp streets from the early morning rain. His feet hit the concrete again and again, until he’s zooming past the main street and running through neighborhoods with large wrap around porches.
Some people on the streets eye them, but don’t say anything, too busy with their own lives. Steve cradles Tony’s head, making sure to press Tony’s face into his chest to ensure no one recognizes him. Steve doesn’t want to read about Tony’s wild partying in the gossip rags.
and there was work to do. There was no time for deep, measured inhales.
“Iron Man. I’m not going to ask again.”
“It’s quite a sight.” He takes both of Tony’s hands and compares the feel of the prosthetic to the flesh.
“I know they’re yours—“
“It’s alright, I know, I know,” Tony hushes him, and cups Its face.
I nod, wondering if there was ever a choice, whether whoring myself out like this could still be justified as survival.
Steve stood by the windows observing New York wake up. Outside, a garbage truck made its way through through the streets, taking all the things people want out of their homes.
steve, steve, steve,
But every time those eyes looked at him in worry, Steve’s life flashed back to him—back to a time when he was happy. He hid his face on her neck and hugged her tight.
“He doesn’t hate you,” Steve replies quickly. He rests a hand on Natasha’s shoulder and forces her to face him. “He doesn’t.”
“No, nothing like that,” Steve takes some sand, closes his fists, and feels it leave his palms. Hold something hard enough, it’s bound to eventually slip away. “It’s stupid, actually. I thought I could come here and find someone to be happy with.”
Steve stays quiet, lets Tony talk about lecturing Riri and Kate for sneaking out with a glass of champagne and the prank that three of them played on Bruce that night. “He almost turned green then Riri kissed him on the cheek and it was all fine.”
Pepper barked a wet laugh. “You know he would, right? He could do it. Tony could have probably figured out how to build a time machine. He’s brilliant. Genius,” she trailed off, looking around the workshop and all the things that belonged to a dead man.
Birthdays were hard. But, it’s true, holidays were unbearable.
He kissed Morgan’s cheek. “Thank you, darling. You always know how to make me feel better.”
“You’re a man people look up to, Tony.”
He still doesn’t drink, even if his body is screaming at him.
“Yeah,” Steve scratches his hand, feeling awkward. “Anything else I can help you with?”
He comes out with a towel on his waist and circles the bed until reaches me. His body is drawn tight, exhaustion evident in the clench of his jaw and on the pull of his shoulders. My job is to make him feel better, so I tug the towel and get on my knees.
The minutes pass.
“What the hell are you both on?” Tony throws up a hand, but pads to mount his horse. “Ben Parker died last year.”
“Sirs, Ms. Potts has asked me to relay this message:
He dresses, scrubs a hand over his head, ignores the pain in his sternum, and grabs the pipe.
They passed the city and entered the freeway upstate.
Tony’s home, in a place where he’s comfortable. Steve's a guest, here just for the night.
Steve nods, examining the photos of Peter and Riri lining the walls, wondering if they ever met. There are diagrams scrawled on the floor, in ink, like an afterthought. There are several workstations overflowing, and there’s a post note from Bruce on the glass doors. This is Tony’s home, and Steve is reminded that he has none, only pit stops and fragile friendships to return to.
“I’ll take you home.” Steve pats Tony’s pocket and grabs his wallet. He fishes Tony’s ID to get his address.
“If you think partying around this area is such a bad thing, then why are you here?” Tony challenges with a raised eyebrow.
Grief was part of love. Horrible, but worth it.
“You have one unread message.”
I have nothing to say today.
“Yeah. We gotta go guys.” He sat up, scrubbing at his hair, but the movement was sluggish. “Come on.”
Tony grinned, getting comfortable on the bed with all his naked flesh. He shoved the pillows behind his back and asked JARVIS to bring his hologram screens up. He started working on schematics and Steve kissed Tony stupid just to get his attention back.
Steve,
He took a carnation with a long stem and started wrapping its stem around it. Over and over, grabbing a second flower, wrapping again, then a third flower, the yellow ones this time. Steve repeated the motion until he got a semi-circle.
“I’m an honest man.” Steve holds his hands up.
“I’m leaving tomorrow,” he forces the words out.
He inhaled deeply, releasing a sigh. Blinked once, twice, hoping his eyes weren’t red-rimmed.
Steve's hair is longer, perhaps a little too long for a professional man upholding the law, but he's clean shaven and the red scarf necktie sits like seduction personified, on the column of his throat. One day, he’ll give Steve a bolo tie, with vibranium tipped coils and a jaded pendant.
Tony stands, and offers a hand, and Steve is shocked that he waits a beat too long to take it, and when he reaches forward, Tony’s already dropped his hand. His mouth twists before it’s soothed out into something neutral. He nods at Steve.
“I’d rather do calculus than wash dishes,” Kate replies with a long-suffering sigh.
Tony drops his head to the side, slurs something, and Steve considers it means yes, because Tony was just kissing him and urging their hips together.
He doesn’t turn or acknowledge It, aching with the severity of truth.
“Well, you’re not supposed to be up there anyway.” Steve rolled his eyes.
“Good, good. I wish he’d come home. It’s hard. Laura and the kids vanished, too.”
“Look, let this be a warning for all those who are lured by the promises of false gods,” Red Wolf says, tips his hat, and they all watch the life bleed from Its eyes.
His memory is meant to be sharper, no alcohol to dull the aches on his back.
“Maybe.” Tony measures out the words, closes his eyes. “If it’s still there.”
I’m afraid.
“We cannot be sure, Stark, but it does raise some questions about the sudden appearance of our old friends,” Reed says, eyeing Rhodes and Jessica Drew. “I have to study the biology of this...this thing. Alien. Perhaps, I may be able to invent a detector.”
Tony snickered, but tilted his head up for a kiss on the lips.
“Like that will spare them, huh?” Samuel cups a hand over his mouth. A quick strike lights a fire. He smiles then blows smoke.
“You’re being very brave.” Steve smiles, hoping to distract the kid as Tony dabs the cut with pads of alcohol. It’s not deep, just a small surface cut, but it’s best to be cautious. For Steve, this might have resulted in an infection back in the day.
It wasn’t working for Steve.
Maybe it wasn’t right to have his entire life and source of happiness dependent on one man. But the statement was true. Steve was nothing without Tony, his anchor. His dream. Steve’s already lost too much. He buried his father too young, and his mother soon followed. Steve was familiar with loss, but it never got any easier.
He made his way down the workshop and pressed his hand on the access bar. Inside the workshop, he sat on the sofa, scrubbing a hand through his head with a heavy sigh.
“If you could bear a detour with any of the sightings, that would be appreciated.”
“I cannot harm him,” It kneels. “It’s done, Veranke.”
It's chilly. The clouds are clustered towards the east, a haze resting along the silhouette of the city. Their proximity to the shore makes abandoned napkins flap through the streets, floating and falling into the sea. Steve's learned to welcome the cold these days. Besides, the temperature is bearable, nothing like cold winters further up north. It’s meditative to stare at nothing in particular, like some sort of placid, everyday man. He’s nothing special these days, inclined to fall into anonymity.
“Well, if it was him haunting me, I’d never ask him to leave.”
He’s struck with a sudden urge to run along the tracks with them, hop on the boxes and give Kate some pointers on her chin-ups, but he doesn’t. It’s not his place.
He can’t say it.
“Thank you for joining me,” Steve says, meaning it, not being able to express his gratefulness. Something is building in the back of his throat, and he means to say more, only he doesn’t know what.
Steve falls on the foot of Tony’s bed, drops his head to his hands, and exhales.
But I know better. Steve is always alert. He’d catch my arms if I tried to push him off the mattress. He doesn’t even let me crawl on top of him. There’s no riding his cock. It’s always me with my back pressed against the mattress, his blue eyes always on me.
Here's something new for his inventory: Tony is content. Happy, even. There's no other word for it, and once again, Steve wonders how the world moves forward, how people no longer seem to be consumed by grief.
It was Bucky. The tape was blurry, but there was no doubt that he was the Winter Soldier they’ve been tracking for the last few months. They bastardized his best friend.
“She’s still got life to her,” Tony says. “Fierce, huh?”
In the bathroom, I shave the goatee to the classic cut. Steve will check and make sure I get the line precise.
Tony was gone and Steve’s entire universe vanished along with it.
“You, I just want you, Steve,” Tony tries the words out, blinking quickly because his eyes sting and there’s this loss deep in the cavities of his chest, an ache that hurts more than their fight from earlier. More than Steve pinning him on the Mansion’s ruins, fist up in the air, breathing heavily as Tony spits on his face. “I don’t care how.”
All these people surround him have never seen the grotesque bodies that litter a battlefield. But Samuel and the waitress in Hafa and the children Siwa and the farmers harvesting rice in their tiny villages at the coast, all find life.
Tony twisted his lips. “Please, Steve, don’t bastardize my coffee. I’d rather not drink it at all.”
Tony can’t do this. He can. He can.
Steve didn’t know him well and it’s unfortunate that the realization only came now, in a moment of crisis.
Tony breathes, the exhale measured, and he finds the courage to take Steve’s hand—the one patting his belly in short strokes—and bring it to his chest. Tony intertwines their fingers, stares at the moon outside, rising impossibly higher. It’s playful, almost lovely because it’s unreachable. But Tony’s circled its atmosphere and knows it’s a dead rock.
Tony is forced and pried, made into a bed of rotten fruit. Once sweet, once innocent, a barely there, ripe thing that remains of their friendship is now black and green with mold.
He tried not to think about Ru because when his meandering thoughts led down to that little file in his head he told himself to never touch, he wanted to strip himself from the suit and throw himself out of the window. He was stupid to believe that there’d be a time when grief would fade into dull ache.
The service was held at the Avengers Compound upstate.
said to join a support group, find people who understand.
“Did you want to — I was going to grab some dinner. Do you want to join me?”
“I didn’t. I wasn’t running away.”
Eventually, the song ended and another one began. Morgan fell asleep on his lap as the two boys started tapping on their tablets. Steve closed his eyes and breathed. In and out, in and out. Everything was fine.
Extremis had repaired him, but it couldn’t do anything to mend the fact that his life was in shambles.
Tony runs off.
“What? You’re tired of having it out at the docks?”
“Strip,” Rumiko commands.
Extremis showed him Happy and Sal’s death certificates. Then, came the vivid memory of the Mandarin attacking them, Sal smoking up in the Helicarrier and being in the line of fire. As he read about the Mighty Avengers and Ultron, he found himself reliving Jan’s death.
“I’m not ready to do that yet, Rogers.”
He stays very still, and thinks that if he puts enough effort, he might find anger inside him, the will to hate this man. But it’s a flickering fire now, smothered by Steve wrapping a hand on his throat.
“Just for a little while, sorry, I didn’t say. I didn’t want to disturb your sleep,” Steve explained. He eyed Tony up and down, head tilting. “Going somewhere?”
“I missed you last night.” Steve set Tony’s favorite mug in front of him. It was given to them by a gift shop owner in Tennessee after they assisted with disaster relief. “My Red Hot Lover.” Steve read the words from the mug and grinned at Tony.
Sam rolls his eyes. “You gotta do better than that.”
He was under the ice again.
So Steve stops inquiring and lets his two Starks keep their secrets. It’s alright, he tells himself, because he has his own jokes with Morgan, too. Peter comes over for his fall break and brings Johnny Storm. They stay in the house across the lake while Tony makes unveiled threats about FRIDAY watching the both of them so they don’t get in any trouble.
“Was.”
Tony tries to listen to their exchange, but he cannot, because he can’t take his eyes off Steve. Alive. Flesh. No organs hanging from a rotting body.
“We’ll hyphenate. I want my last name next to yours.”
“The truth is, Tony, I don’t want to be alone.” He cradles Tony’s face, like they’re lovers and this is a confession. “I want to build a better world. That’s the dream, I can’t do it without you.”
“You did?” Steve turned to Tony, finally meeting his gaze. Only, this time, Tony was staring at Bucky through the partition.
“Can you remind me what it was like to be us? Before.”
“They’re my life.”
He stayed there until his body stopped shaking and the sobs subsided. The serum was supposed to keep him at optimal condition.
Steve did.
Steve is surrounded by his friends and family. The world isn’t ending. It’s all fine.
Steve,
Frustration and grief were Captain America’s old friends. He knew them in the ways men made friends with horrible, awful things and believed they loved them anyway.
But he doesn’t.
Sheriff Red Wolf raises both hands, and for a moment Tony thinks he’ll be arrested, but Red Wolf takes him by the shoulders, and claps him twice in a friendly gesture. “Stark, relax. In a town full of crazies, no one will bat an eye about you and Rogers.”
When will Steve stop seeing Tony in Harley’s boyish grin, in Peter’s shy laugh, in Morgan’s eyes? It hurt that there were days when he couldn’t look at their children, afraid he’ll break down and never stop crying.
Steve,
There were jasmines at every corner of the Compound starting from the concrete path leading to the facility. They filed out of the vehicle, one by one, and gathered in the lounge.
Tony closed his eyes for the final time and he died in Steve’s arms.
Tony flips the shield. The symbol red, white, and blue quickly disappears to show the back of the vibranuium and the brown leather straps. Steve holds his right arm up, watches his fingers, then wrists, then forearms fit perfectly on the clasp. and Tony settles it there.
It should have been harder to fall in love with Tony Stark. They’re two men with fucked up pasts, veterans of violence and war, tainted by the cynicism of corrupt governments.
That’s under threat too.
In lieu of an answer, Steve kisses Tony soundly, and when Tony’s lips part, he slips in his tongue, trying to communicate that of course, the world is still a mess; half the universe returned.
Steve returns to his bare room. He used to find comfort in its plain white walls and minimal furniture.
Damn you, Rogers, Tony doesn’t say. He bites back the tears, seeing It battle-ready, so much like Steve.
With what little energy he has left, Tony lifts his head and the muscles on his back overwork themselves and he wishes that Steve would just break his neck so he doesn’t have to go through this every night.
“Whoever said love wasn’t,” he whispers.
“Hmm.” Steve rushed over, walking to meet Tony halfway. He tilted Tony’s chin up, smacking a loud kiss on his cupid bow. “You were great up there, Shellhead.”
“Isn’t that too much coffee you?” Steve asks gesturing at the newly refilled cup. It’s plain, black with a half a pack of raw sugar.
He is the last man I’ll see, the last voice I’ll hear.
“No, no, you come first.” He doubled his effort on working Tony's cock until he was shuddering. “Come, sweetheart. Come on me.”
“What do you want to do instead?” Tony asks, not realizing he’s been holding his breath.
“So we’re going steady, huh?”
Tony rolled his eyes and deadpanned, “The perks of being a liberal parent, Steve.”
Tony holds up his mechanical arm against the late October sky. There lies his wedding band. “And yet.”
She didn’t wait for an answer.
He hoped that there’s still some part of him that’s salvageable, a part of him that hasn’t been chipped away and worn off by the brutal waters.
“I love when you sing that song.
Riri waves her fork at Steve, mouth full of food. “Well, you’d know, if you know, called once in a while, checked in. People do that now. 21st century, you can connect in an instant, but you didn’t —“
“What is it with you, you can make these grand speeches while the world is ending, and you can’t say the simplest things?”
“Steve.” Tony pauses, surprised.
Here, he's nothing but a body providing Tony pleasure. That's it. Nothing more. Steve's just a fucktoy, invited to a couple's bed for the night.
Along the walls are mail Steve received during his tenure as Captain America. There’s a series of drawings from kids, likely in elementary school at the time the pictures were sent, featuring the shield, Captain America and Iron Man, the rest of the Avengers, line art of New York City.
He knew that.
A blush creeps up Tony’s face, and he reaches for his sunglasses again. Brown orbs are once again hidden.
It was as if Tony spoke the statement into existence. There was something wrong with his head.
Bucky padded over, settling a hand on Harley’s shoulder. “Hey, don’t talk to your dad like that.”
Tony’s face was tight with dried tears, and he suspected that he looked as messy and chaotic as he felt. But his lips curled into a tiny, uneven smile. Steve’s lips parted. He rocked forward, and their mouths met again.
Steve settled on the rug by the massive Christmas tree. It smelled sharp, refreshing, almost tender. He hurt all over. Holidays punched all the tender parts of him.
Steve turned on the water, testing the temperature with fingers.
It's a funny book. I say that without laughing. You’ll like it, I think. Though, it might be too fatalistic for you. You see, I'm a genius, but maybe I'm stupid to believe you're the perfect man. Was the perfect man. Steve, you’re filled with ideals and standards that could only be lived by you. I don’t mean it as a bad thing. I never did. Sometimes admiration sounds like jealousy. I do envy you. Even in death, you’re still what I measure everything against.
There’s no doubt that Tony’s been here before. Steve can imagine him now: sunglasses perched on his nose, the plant in the corner shading half of face against the sun, a glass of ice-cold tea under his chin as he sucks on the straw.
Just two lanes, one incoming, going south, and the other, where he and Morgan are following,  heads north.
“You could have,” Tony says, lightly.
Bruce frowns. “No, Steve, that’s what being human is.”
Steve stood, exited the tub and grabbed a towel. His clothes soaked the floor but he paid it no mind. Instead, he guided Tony up and dried him. Patting the towel over his shoulders and scrubbing his hair. A brief wipe over his cock. Tony wondered if Steve was like this with his lovers, too. Attentive in a domineering sort of way.
They could be anything.
“It’s alright, sweetheart. It’ll be alright,” Steve said, hoping that if he said the phrase enough, it would come true. “We’ll be okay.”
“Steve, I’m — ”
“No, it didn’t.” Steve grabbed the robe hanging in the closet. He didn’t offer it to Tony. Instead, he moved Tony’s limbs like a doll and wrapped him up. “I’m sick of fighting you.”
Before they decided to head out to a diner, Victoria knocks on their door, holding two glass containers in her hands. “Pot roast and potatoes, courtesy of Samuel’s daughter.” She chews and blows her bubble gum. “If you ask me, her mother was the better cook.”
Tony understands him, and it’s true. This is goodbye.
Even with half of the universe gone, reduced to dust motes recycling into thinning air, the cafe is filled with conversations that never seem to end.
The kid winces but doesn’t cry. “I guess,” he says, petulantly.
He’d taken apart the television set earlier, now he tasked himself with setting it right and improving the circuitry. Tony was lost in the wires and panels that ran on the machine, and he'd work much better with a glass of brandy, but he had none. Carol took all the liquor, even the fridge was empty save for a few bottles of S.Pellegrino.
“I know, sweetheart.”
“Iz is teaching me how to make herbal medicine from the yarrows and rose hips.” Steve places the eggs on a plate and re-heats the leftover potatoes on the pan.
Somehow, Steve couldn’t help but believe the words were a lie. He couldn’t feel well because he threw up late into the night. Tony was trying to be strong for them—but he didn’t have to. He never said a word about the nausea he must have felt after he finished vomiting.
Could Steve have this, too? He could. He should call Sharon tomorrow.
His eyes always found Tony, in the suit, soaring in the sky. Tony, at home, in their bed, asleep. Tony talking to their kids. Tony, Tony, Tony.
and just. It’s not about morals, not for these folks, no matter how much they recycle the same arguments to their constituents. To the people. Maybe people think I’m just as bad as the rest of them. Down to the mud.
“The song you were just singing.”
Tony doesn’t want to hear it because if he does, he’ll remember, and he’ll think about it, turn it over and over like a page to an endless book. He can’t have that. Not now.
Clean up is quick and efficient as they all help. Bruce takes all the plates and rinses them before placing them in the dishwasher. Tony puts away the leftovers as Natasha deals with the pots and pans. Kate shoves a dishrag at Steve’s face and signals for him to wipe down the table. Riri stands there, smug.
It would be easier to just let Tony hire the cleaners. But there was something about sweeping his own floor and replacing his own bed sheets that just screamed home to Steve.
At least there, I knew my time was finite. There would have been a bullet to my head after subjecting myself to medical prodings, to the experimentation, to interrogations about my biology.
Sometimes I wonder, Steve, I truly do.
His feet carry him away.
Captain America was supposed to remain determined and assured.
Tony smiled, lightly squeezing Steve’s hands. They used to be so strong—carrying soldering irons, building machines, now, they were still the same, but the veins on his wrists and the back of his hands were more pronounced. Tony’s lost so much weight.
“I didn’t forget,” Tony says. He stares into Steve’s eyes. Blue. An ocean of problems. An ocean to drown in.
“Does it have to be that black and white?”
He wants to see Tony’s face, nevermind that his eyes are obstructed. Nevermind that his eyes are the first that Steve seeks out after a battle. Nevermind it all.
Steve was raised Catholic. His mother was an Irish immigrant and she instilled the word of the Lord into Steve. When he went into ice, he lost the rosary she gave him when she passed. Tony spent years tracking it to no avail. Sometimes things were better left off not knowing.
Her eyes are filled with unshed tears and there’s a quirk in her left eyebrows that fade as her lips tremble. Her breath is harsh when she says, “I didn’t like who I was before this. This is who I am. I never thought that family would be so formative. Important. It’s childish, isn’t it? But it’s what I want. That’s why I stay. Why I’m here. Why I’m still trying, Steve.”
“Will you come for me?” Steve asks, and Tony nods, frantic now. He tries to get a hand between their bodies but Steve slaps it away, admonishing him with a huff. He leans back, spits on his hand, and jerks Tony off.
For the first time in forty-one months, he settled his eyes on the corner of the cabinet. There was Tony’s wedding ring.
Steve is saying something now. Tony refuses to hear it.
And, well, it’s true. They probably do.
“Er, yeah.” Steve bent down, getting to his knees, ducking his head to stop from laughing.
What was the use of this certificate? Tony’s dead. This was nothing but archival material that would probably fall into the hands of a university historian some point in the future.
Eventually, they make it back to Tony and his little crew of children. Samuel greets them all, and calls one of them over to deliver a message to their mothers. “Tell them there’s a man here that might be able to fix her washer and dryer. Oh and tell the Kim’s that we got help for them too.”
Be safe
He grabbed one, bit it, then set it back down. He looked at Morgan and the mess of salsa on her lips.
They stand by the welcome sign,
He looks at Rumiko, smug, and wonders whether she’s vindictive enough to hurt him this way, put Steve in his place, and realizes—no, she isn’t cruel. This was supposed to be fun.
That’s the thing with him, he’ll start and finish it to the end just with stubborn will alone. But when it comes to Tony, he falters. His steps grow quiet, and he finds himself glancing away, consumed by equal measures of guilt and yearning.
I still have 16 grams of coke and a bottle of vicodin. So, I guess not sober.
"I don't remember how or when I started loving you. All I know is why, and there's a million reasons for it, half of it is what I've come to resent you for. Only, that isn't true. Perhaps, that's my favorite part of you," Tony confessed, rubbing his index finger on the edges of Steve's lips. "I deluded myself for so long. But Steve, all I ever wanted was your friendship. For you to be safe." Tony dropped his hand, made himself smaller. He didn't know what to do, and he told Steve just as much. "Where do we go on from here, Steve? Sometimes love isn’t enough.”
His chest tightened with the wish that his children wouldn’t have to go through this. All children must, yes, it’s life. But she’s so young, barely even eight; she has so many years ahead of her that Tony will miss.
I throw the straight blade and miss his head. There’s a small nick on his temple. I used to be stronger. I can’t overpower him. I’ve tried.
They kiss, mad and deep, as if they haven’t seen each other in a decade. Nevermind that they had a tumble in the sheets just this morning. After Steve comes inside Tony, he takes Tony into his hand and makes a mess of their shower.
Tony doesn’t look up. Both of his hands are occupied by a set of wires and a long, thin tweezer. “What can I do for you?”
Steve makes him drink another full glass of water before he’s satisfied. He rubs his cock through his trousers.
Tony couldn’t help it. Steve found his weak points and rather than jab at it and press on the bruise, he caressed it, tutted instead, wrapped Tony up in this gauze pad of care and affection.
“Hey, we won’t bother you for interviews. We’re simple people. Got no time to chase a big shot superhero. All we’re looking for is a mechanic. That’s what you said you are, right? Anyway, fella, can I grab you guys a beer?”
“What’s the song?”
He didn’t know how long they sat in the tub. The water turned cold and Tony’s fingers were white and pruney. But Steve kept humming and kneading the knots on his shoulders, and all Tony knew was that he didn’t deserve this.
Steve hates the glamour of Beverly Hills, the large skyscrapers, then the endless homelessness that surround parts of Santa Monica. He hates, hates, hates. There’s so many things Steve has grown to despise, no longer seeing the world through the bright eyes of wanting to serve his country, do good things in the world. War teaches you that you pull the trigger not for freedom or democracy, but to serve as pawns of men in the Capitol.
Tony used to grill the tomatillos and the jalapenos until they were charred. Steve did the same, following the recipe by the dot. He blended the spices together and let the pork simmer for half the day. The entire brownstone smelled like the tang of peppers and cilantro. If he closed his eyes, he could pretend that it was Tony making dinner.
She looked so damned earnest, he couldn’t do anything but hide his head in shame. Tony dropped his head and turned to count the patterns of the flickering light.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” Steve yells, hands clenched to his side, battle-ready. His face twisted in horror.
You’d laugh. If you were alive. The Registration. It’s all gone, washed out and dry. Osborn wants to be called Commander, like he’s worth a damn. Like he’s half the man you are. I’ve learned long ago that no one can measure up to you.
Rumiko, though, is someone Steve’s still learning—learning to know, learning to like, learning to stop comparing himself to—because what does it matter now, anyway, how he compares to her? He’s seen the coverage in the papers.
He wasn't drunk enough. He felt for a small bottle on the floor and reached for it. He uncapped it and guzzled it down, almost choking with the way he couldn’t hold his head up. Tony drank another and another, and Carol was screaming and bearing down on him, holding his wrists too hard and prying the bottle away.
I used to be stronger. Faster. I was defiant. I was a warrior. Now, I’m just Tony Stark.
“I’m glad to talk to you without the mask.”
He calls Tony over and over again. Tony shuts his eyes, filters the words out, and retreats to the space in his body that Steve cannot touch.
He falls back against Steve, and lets the final trickles of piss out, utterly out of control. It drips down his legs, painting Steve's cock, and it splashes on his bare feet.
He can pretend, can lie to himself, like he’s been lying his whole life. Steve’s gotten good at denial.
“Wow, so if it comes from you, Pepper automatically gives a pass? I gotta use that more often,” Tony said.
Sometimes his head spins so much when he turns on the TV and sees an attack in New York. Sometimes he finds himself holding still, waiting for the fractures to further crack. He can’t help it. Steve’s always nervous, and even though Sam has the shield, there are days he putters around the workshop, unable to summon up the words to ask to Tony to make him something.
Sheriff Red Wolf tilts his head to look at the sky. The sun is high up, the heat of the summer turning blisters on their backs. “Did Ben Ulrich say something along the lines of Timely taking a supernatural quality?”
Tomorrow he’ll wake up, go for a run, and then maybe Tony will pass by the Mansion and they’ll have a cup of coffee. Maybe Steve might suggest sparring, just for fun, for old times’ sake, because it’s always a good idea to practice, and Steve will pretend he doesn’t know what Tony’s sweat tastes like, or the way his rim twitches as Steve slides out. Steve will pretend to not know how his hole flutters when come drips out, and he’ll pretend that being close to Tony doesn’t affect him.
He’s never seen her smile, much less laugh, but here and now, Tony’s eyes flash in excitement as he tells a story about her slipping a glass of red wine on her dress, then changing to her uniform to match Rhodes. All of them, watching the sunset at the docks, Kate and Riri skipping rocks at the creek and begging Tony to buy them a fishing rod.
“Is that a euphemism for something else?” Peter yells from across the table.
Someone—Rhodes—pried Morgan’s sleeping form from his lap, hushing her when she mumbled and reached for Steve. Natasha was suddenly beside him, pulling him into a tight hug.
“He could have called.” Clint’s mouth twisted into something sour. He perched on the edge of Natasha’s desk with a folder on one hand. “Let us know how he is, though.”
“Look at yourself.”
Over a pitcher of cold beer, the man introduces himself as Samuel. He lost his wife to cancer years before the Decimation, and he has lots of opinions on the current state of healthcare system. He finished his plate of cheesy fries and barked out facts about the town. He threw down his hat across the table and refilled their glasses, telling Steve about his only daughter, an adult now, and still alive. She wasn’t lost to the Snap, but one of his grandkids was taken from the Decimation.
Steve sighs and pitches Tony’s side. “I made it as fancy as I could to fit your taste. It’s an outdoor shower, not an outhouse. I know what an outhouse is,” Steve replies, shuttering at the memory of his time in the army. “You, sir, do not.”
He rolled his eyes and dropped the drinks on the table with a bang. He grabbed one and finished it off even if he couldn’t get drunk.
Tony’s always known he is simply a pit stop. A brief entertainment for a lonely man. He’s already written the narrative: Steve would continue being Sheriff and then maybe he’d find a nice woman, perhaps, he’d finally relent and meet Maria Hill’s distant cousin in the Capitol. He’s seen photographs of Sharon Carter, and she and Steve would make a handsome couple. Tony would drink all throughout the wedding reception if he’s invited, and pretend to forget the taste of Steve’s come in his mouth.
He doesn’t understand what it means, if not a boot to the ass saying, move soldier, move. Isn’t that what he’s done all these years? Left foot, right foot, left, right, left, until he’s marching to another battle, making more ghosts.
An octave lower, then: “It’s fine, Steve. It’s alright.”
Tony didn’t look healthy. He had circles under his eyes and he was so thin. But, his eyes twinkled and he had a smile. Steve wished he could kiss its upturned corners.
Clint whistled. “Damn, language, Cap.”
Steve’s full on crying now, ugly, messy, his face hurt badly and it was hard to breathe. He didn’t recognize the howl that came out of him until Tony’s hands were on his cheeks, pressing his fingers on Steve’s eyelids. Tony wiped the tears with shaking hands.
“Dinner’s ready.” He croaked out. Steve wasn’t going to cry. “What are you doing here? Didn’t I say not to—”
It looped and looped. A cycle of mismatched photographs with the same narration. It kept unlocking as the days passed, as if his brain was trying to rewrite the backup and force the truth out.
“And you know what happens to people like that?” Samuel adds, stopping just a few feet from Tony holding court. There’s a row of parked bikes perched down the road. Tony’s waving a pipe wrench and show the kids the engine of Samuel’s car. “They say they can’t find the right words, so they say nothing at all. It don’t gotta be like that, pal.”
Winghead,
The penthouse’s lights are dim. Steve slips in through the door and pads to the bedroom, reminding himself that he’s here for Tony.
He falters, lost for words.
Some people are able to go home, take the country road there. One foot after the other, and feel at peace. Some people know the way by heart and it comes easy for them. Steve wonders what it’s like now for empty homes after the snap.
“You never do things that are good for you, anyway.”
All he had was this single carnation.
“Bullshit. Just take it.” Tony bulls his hands away from the shield and shoves them in his pocket. “It’ll help all of us sleep better at night knowing you got that.”
Steve clears his throat. His chest feels like he’s been sucker punched.
He sits there, engine still running, seatbelt still buckled, documenting the changes in the Compound. Steve wonders whether Tony decided on the new updates himself, or if Natasha and the others had offered suggestions. There’s so much Steve has missed.
“Come on, please.”
Shit. That’s the thing, Steve. You and I have too many expectations of each other. Maybe that’s where we went wrong.
The justifications are trite. Tony’s seen the world, what would he do with Steve in a second hand car with a janky door handle and missing back seats?
If Steve was here, he might joke about paganism. Instead, Tony huffs, raises his shoulders, tries to shrug.
and there’s the cold memory of sleeping alone these past weeks while Steve’s on the run, and Tony’s tasked to hunt him. Tony returns to their bed, alone, cold with no one to pet him to sleep because Steve packed half of his clothes in an old army duffle bag and left.
That morning, Steve woke to his daughter’s wailing. Morgan screamed and howled until her throat was raw. Her face was mottled and her freckles were stained with tears. She hugged Steve’s bicep tightly, body shaking.
Only, the blunt head of Steve’s cock isn’t at his battered entrance.
He’s glad he doesn’t have to explain further than that.
It wasn’t his cells dividing rapidly. Tony died and Steve kept on living.
“Hi.” Steve wipes his hands on his faded jeans, and let’s himself look at Tony.
He walked, bare ass and all, towards the flowers and plucked a handful of the dwarf carnations. He took the pale yellow, deep red, and bright white ones and sat beside Tony.
I couldn’t talk to Cap though. Carol thinks too much of me. Said I'm the leader of SHIELD because I'm "stronger than anyone." It's not true, Steve. Sometimes a man just gets used to crisis and desensitized to violence.
Steve watches the muscles ripple on his back.
He didn’t use to be this pessimistic. He was the type of man who never settled for less than what was right, and what’s right by his standards. But that’s just Steve.
Grief makes men nostalgic and nostalgia is a reminder that men are irrecoverable.
“You’ll be well fed, Stark.” Samuel turns to Steve, measuring him up. “Now, you, sir, we gotta figure out what to do with you.”
She wrote,
“Tony!” Steve pulled his hair, a reaction to Tony slipping off from his cock to bite the insides of his thighs.
His little baby boy may be thirteen, but it’s just like yesterday when he and Tony took him home from the hospital.
“I’ll take good care of it,” Steve promises, realizing how young the salesman actually looks. He couldn’t have been older than his early twenties. Did he take over the family business? Steve doesn’t ask whether his father had Disappeared or simply died. In their minds, it might be the same, but he wonders if people are still hoping for a miracle. A resurrection.
The area is lined with an array of pine trees, and there, in the corner of the residential area, are cherry trees, still saplings.
Instead, a blow to his naked back side surprises him. He can't say he screams, because the blows keep descending.
“I suppose,” Steve acquiesces with a heavy heart. It’s a wonder how he doesn’t sink to the ground. He wants it, though. Bury him and let him rest with the rest of the dusted particles. “New life,” he says, voice dull, “And so.”
“Alright,” he smiles, bright and happy and seeing him like this fucking hurts. “Good, now let me finish opening you up.” Steve kisses him again. On the lips, then his chin, before moving back down to swallow Tony’s cock and lap at his hole. Steve continues to stretch him up, getting more lube and fingering him open with those mighty thick fingers. Soon enough, he abandons the lube and just starts dripping his saliva on Tony’s abused hole, stretched by his fingers. “If you could see how good you take it, Tony.” Steve kisses the inside of his thighs, crookes his fingers like a damn champ, and hits Tony’s prostate.
Can you tell us what happened, she had asked. Another said, he’s in shock. Then, a whisper, yeah, that kid’s a witness. A gasp recognizing him, that’s Stark’s son, you know, of Stark Industries? They got his contact info and gave him a ride home.
Tony would be at the saloon, but if he set foot in the premise, he’d spiral down.
The moment vanishes.
Hank's right. My hands are dirty. Always. Again and again. I'm sorry. For you, Steve. For Janet. For everything. We’ve lost a lot.
Of course, Steve would always vote for Tony’s tech, but he also appreciates the design of Shuri’s arm. Late in the evenings, sometimes he’d find Tony in bed, fresh him his shower, fiddling on his arm in their shared bed. Tony had glanced up at him with a smile as he closed the plates and set down his tools. He beckoned Steve over with his mechanical arm. Red and gold was a color Steve will never tire of. That evening, he learned exactly why Tony’s design surpasses Shuri’s.
Steve felt around for his pocket, holding the note in Tony’s handwriting, letting it ground him. Peter and Harley stared at him, twin expressions pained. Steve’s eyes stung and he wiped at them. His friends and family had seen him cry over the past year. It wasn’t gonna stop anytime soon.
“Yeah,” and he almost believes it.
He turns off the stove and reaches for Tony’s hair, wiping at the pieces of snow melting on the edges of his  forehead. Tony wears it longer these days. It’s not as long as Steve’s, but it’s floppier. Steve is quite fond of it, especially when it’s mused and filled with cowlicks in the morning.
“Looking for this?” She holds the slim cigarette case between her middle and index fingers.
“I never had that.” Bucky eyed him, suspiciously. They’ve worked a few missions taking out HYDRA once the fiasco with SHIELD was revealed. Bucky had been tracking them and assisting from afar, too afraid to get close to Steve and the team in case he was triggered.
The hologram—no, Tony—gestured with slow hands.
nevermind that Tony’s a stranger he met at a party. He swallows, eyeing Steve up and down. “Being in the Army and all, right?”
“Good, I’m glad someone is on his side.”
The next time he opens them, the only heartbeat in the room is his own. Alone again. Naturally. He swings his feet to the floor. He’s nearly in tears, and then, two tiny beads drip down his cheeks. He wipes them quickly, frustrated.
“My parents?” Tony furrowed his brows, confused. “If you want anything related to the 40’s or Howling Commandos, all of Howard’s professional papers and belongings have been archived in the SI museum. You can make an appointment with, you know what, nevermind. J, can you schedule Steve a meeting with the head archivist—”
I’m tired of arguing with you on paper, stringing along words you’ll never read. You’re dead.
Sometimes, when the kids were at school, Steve screamed until his throat was sore. He pounded on the punching bag wishing like hell he was still in the field just so he could take his rage out on something. Maybe, he’d even get hit just to feel like he was still alive, not this hollow shell of a person he’s becoming.
The burn is good. He’s well stretched with fingers, spit, and lube, but there’s nothing like being pried open by Steve’s thick cock. It’s stupid, but he feels whole. This is one thing he’s sure of. Fucking is what he knows. Tony stabilizes himself with both hands going to Steve’s shoulders and bounces up and down, letting gravity pull him down.
The gardens on their rooftop would continue to grow, then wither in the winter. He’d have to wake up tomorrow, get dressed and pretend to have his shit together.
You punched me in the face. I deserve that though. Killer left hook. I might have forgotten to mention that I had a trip to Madripoor and saw our old friend, Madame Hydra. She recognized my fighting style. I've got to thank you for that. Seeing you in action, spitfire and full of righteous demand reminds me of what we’ve lost. What the world lost.
Another memory: mourning Steve's dead body in the helicarrier.
Tony dropped his head on Steve’s chest, body shaking in laughter. “You don’t have to ask, baby.” He looked amused. “I really hope you’re not planning to take it slow with me. Because, Rogers, I gotta admit, I’ve been crushing on you for months. If you’re planning to woo me and take me to bed weeks from now, I might actually explode.”
There’s no resentment in his eyes. No blame. Like he’s let go of the fight, while Steve has no other choice but to keep holding on.
“Steve, seriously, it’s fine—”
He couldn’t look at Steve. Not after Tony followed him in Asgard and Steve pushed him off. Not after Steve walked away, spat on his face, and told him,
“I don’t know why you all keep leaving, anyway,” Natasha adds. “I really don’t. There’s a place for you here. You have to know that.” She kicks off her feet and stands beside the window, her back turned to Steve. “But I suppose I’m not one to say anything. This family… this mess of a family… I didn’t think that it would be me and Tony trying to make do.”
“I see Parker every day, are we really informing the press —”
“You did not just say beau.”
It’s not that Steve wouldn’t have expected that. Tony is a fixer. He sees problems and plans a million ways to fix them. This isn’t any different. The world is in shambles and he’s patching his world back together. Steve sighs, his thoughts circle back to Tony.
“But Dr. Lisk said that there were gaps in your memory. That your 'back-up' was formed before—" Steve swallowed and looked away. “Before the war.”
Somehow, Steve doesn’t bleed to death on the ride, and isn’t that just Mr. Steven Grant Rogers to defy nature herself? Tony still can’t believe that the scientist, Erskine experimented on Steve. Erskine was having tea with Strange, exchanging notes on a medical experiment, when Happy Hogan came rushing through the doors.
to move on. I do, I truly do. But grief is a fucking bitch."
“And do what?”
“You told me everything.”
It’s been happening more and more lately. He couldn’t stop looking at Tony. Sometimes he caught himself tracing the slope of his nose, the lines on his eyes, the curve of his smile. For the most part, Steve has stopped trying to turn away. But today, under the daylight in a hot New York summer with millions of people around them—Steve didn’t think he could keep his face neutral.
Home: comfort, a slice of happiness in a miserable life.
“This one is gonna be a mouthful. Wouldn’t stop barking in the car at every other thing.” Tony warns with a sigh. “But I suppose I should be used to the chickens you have by the now.”
He drinks, sips water, finally realizing how long it’s been since he’s had fresh water. Steve pulls away the glass and sets it back down.
Steve,
“Well, lucky for you, I’m a mechanic.”
Steve traces the lines of the buildings across the street with his index finger. Up, down, up, down, left, right. His results are a set of lines that somehow makes a picture. When his focus returns, he catches the circles under his eyes and the frown that follows it.
“What do you want me to say?”
“Not too loud, sweetheart,” Steve replies, kissing Tony’s mouth quiet.
Tony doesn’t turn away. He stares at Steve’s face. It. Pitt'o Nili.
He could be happy. What a thought.
“What? Uh, no, Buck, it’s not like that,” Steve directed his gaze back to Bucky. He didn’t realize he was staring at Tony. “Not at all. We’re just teammates.”
Steve shrugs, and because he doesn’t know what else to do, he presses the gas and drives past the gate and into the driveway. They reach the entrance of the main building in silence.
It didn’t matter. He was beside Tony. Their shoulders touched. He could smell Tony’s hair—sweaty, bloody, with a touch of antiseptic.
“Not so skinny now, though.”
People walk, and walk, and walk. With family, with friends, with their dogs. This is how normal people live.
“Look! Mr. Ramirez’s dog just had a litter of pups and she said I could have this one.” Morgan holds the dog up and it wills to sit still, but it barks up at Steve. "He said they're strong herders, so it's gonna be good for our place, right?"
“There were about three thousand songs in there.”
Steve ran his hand on the nearly dilapidated garden. The gardenias and dwarf carnations were blooming, growing even though he’s long abandoned tending to them.
“There’s also someone who calls himself the Daredevil, now,” Rhodes says. “Well, you got Lang in the West. Ever think of having a West Coast Avengers?”
Tony rolled his eyes but swallowed him down with expertise. He groaned, digging a hand on Steve’s thighs, and flattening his tongue to swirl at the shaft. Steve watched with a fond smile. “You’re perfect on your knees, Tony. Will you let me come on your tongue?”
Right. This is about sex. Just sex.
Outside, New York was alive and booming. Taxis honked, and a cyclist yelled for pedestrians to move from the streets. Tony smiled, and turned to Steve. “Did they have sesame?”
He ignores his shaky fingers and Steve is gracious enough to not say anything. Tony pushes his hair back for the second time that night, hand massaging Steve’s scalp. He presses their foreheads together. Breathes. Inhales Steve.
“You forgot Dr. Strange’s neurosis and proclamation that he’s a sorcerer now.”
Steve.
He catalogued the difference in the set of Steve’s shoulders and the way he held himself together with an air of righteousness.
It seemed to satisfy them all. Steve stared at his plate—a slice of chicken, rice, and beans. It wasn’t a classic Christmas meal, but it was Tony’s favorite. He cut the chicken methodologically, shoved it in his mouth, chewed, and swallowed. His stomach felt cold, but he forced the food down. He couldn’t taste it.
“Not really,” Steve shakes his head, hands going to his pocket. “I just want to check on you. Make sure you’re really alright.”
He wants to talk. He wants to say so much. But there are rules in place, and he’s trapped in limbo, at once having what he’s always wanted, but not in the circumstances he’s wished for. Steve imagined evenings in the Mansion, together in the workshop, walking around the city, crawling across the town and its people like they’re just two ordinary citizens. Breakfast served and eaten together, late evenings that end in soft kisses and the promise of more. More. More. More. That’s the thing with Steve, isn’t it? He’s always wanted more.
“Hmm.” Kate hops up and stands beside Tony.
For a beat, Steve seemed like he was trying to parse out words. His eyes were soft, too forgiving. “Can I walk you?”
Tony has never been good at saying goodbyes.
“Fuck, fuck, Steve.”
Tony would rather not leave the hotel, but he would if that was the only choice. He was going to get up, button his trousers and find shoes. They had to be here, somewhere. He’d go down the block and find a liquor store and buy as much as he could carry.
“But he died in the war!” Tony stops short, realization dawning into him. “Are all the dead coming back?”
He blinks because of course Tony would know what Steve wants without him having to say anything. “Sometimes I miss the old gal.” Steve is surprised by his own admittance.
“Low blow, bringing dad into this.” Harley sat on the kitchen table and shoved a spoonful of oatmeal into his mouth.
Every other weekend, they came to the brownstone with some excuse to check on Steve.
Tony thinks he’s good, thinks
“Tony.” Steve laughed, batting Tony’s hands away from his chest. He grabbed them both and pressed them above Tony’s head. “Fine, if that’s how you want to do it. Don’t move.”
Tony’s back is to him. He pauses, but doesn’t turn around. “Goodnight, Rogers.”
They spent the entire day staring at Peter in awe. Everytime he blinked, Steve and Tony looked at each other and said, “Did you see that? So cute.”
With one hand, he opens the door, deposits Tony inside, and gets into the passenger seat.
“Alright, alright,” Tony yells, cupping his hands and waving them off. “We’re gonna check on something in the back. Don’t burn anything down, Barnes! Wilson, you better watch your man.”
He is set onto the mattress. The sheets are soft. There’s a blanket this time. A pillow too.
It was just yesterday he was telling Steve about their happy ending.
Blood drips from Tony’s wrists.
No, Tony doesn’t say. It’s too much effort to shake his head, to scream his refusal, to beg Steve, no please no, this isn’t you, what happened, let me help you —
