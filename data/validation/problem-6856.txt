With a soft pat. "I'm sure you can make this all alright- I wouldn't push this onto Tony though so fast but start with something small- maybe start with seeing your son- don’t mention to him about you being his other dad yet,"
Steve nods and smiles brightly. "If you want to see me again." He says softly. "I'll stay until your dad gets here if you want."
“I believe we have it handled mostly here, Captain,” the head surgeon responded, looking up at him. “You could help set up a recover room with one of the aids, we’re finishing up here, I’m sure mister stark is just worried that’s all,”
Steve woke up a few hours later, rubbing at his eyes with a yawn escaping his mouth awake. He sat up in the bed, blinking slowly for a second as he noticed Peter wasn't in the bed like he was hours ago.
"Hey, you wanna see something cool?" Tony walked in holding a box in one hand the other was his coat. "Pulled it from dad’s archives," he opened the box, one of his dad’s prized pens. "50 råsunda lend-lease PO of these in 1941 provided support to the outlines when they needed it the most," he stuffed his hands in his pockets
"Why are you showing me this?" Tony raised an eyebrow sipped his bottle. "There's nothing in there, Monica just rambled off bullshit I get it,"
The assassin nodded. "You're here to help out in the hospital, don't forget that you can probably pull something from the surgeons and nurses," before heading off, probably towards the files storage.
"I said we'd lose, you said we'll do that together too," he pointed a finger at him. "And guess what Cap? We lost and you weren't there- but that's what we do right? Our best work after the fact what we're the Ah-vengers? We're the Ah-vengers? Not the Pre-Vengers? Right?"
"What the- Nat am I seeing things?" He said dropping his bag as he jogged over immediately. The assassin didn't say anything as she just played the hologram recording.
"You had to have known before the accords. You had to. There's no way you couldn't have known. You lied to me, Tony! If you would’ve just told me then, I would've had more to think about! I already regret my decision but then put the fact that you were pregnant with our boy..." He pulls away. "I don't know how to describe the hate that I have for myself. I love you- I still do- I know you hate me... But at least let me get to see my son before I never see him again."
But what he wasn't expecting was to see an old friend walking up towards his home along with this other teenage girl.
“No no bub,” He spoke, shaking his head softly. “We’re trying to keep you safe until you’re older okay?” he slightly lied to his son, yes people saw them with Peter as they walked out of the orphanage but they never spoke about it to the public, they didn’t see the reason to as they were trying to keep their life as private as they could.
"Shut up and don't worry I dusted off your Encylopedia collection when we got the door to our room open,"
Tony paused at this as he looked away with a groan, immediately he stood up walking away to the kitchen leaving Steve on the couch, he always hated this, hated how suddenly Steve would leave and he'd be alone with his problems and thoughts- his nightmares, god everything. He grabbed a flask of his favorite whiskey and some chips and made his way into the basement not even bothering to say goodbye to Steve, he didn't even bother to even attempt to sleep that night and deal with his nightmares all by himself. He immediately got to work on his latest project, a little surprise for Peter.
"You think i don’t want to be with you?" He rolled his eyes. "I don’t want to be with someone who’s not on my side instead, i want to do the right thing but i mean whatever floats your boat, what makes you sleep at night,"
"What's worse is Kamala here has-," He paused placing a hand on the girl's shoulder. "Found evidence that might show what really happened to..," he paused taking a glance at Tony before turning back to Thor. "To Steve...,"
"Well I make robots and machines that can do super duper cool things, like the iron man suits in the basement- but you're not allowed to go down there by yourself do you understand me?" He gave him a soft but stern look.
Peter pulled back, looking up at him before looking down biting his lip harshly. “I-i don’t know who to even blame- be angry at- i-is that bad?”
Steve gently kisses Tony's hand and smiles softly. "Tony, this worked." He whispers. "We'll hear from Peter in a little while,” Before anyone could speak another word, a loud boom as the compound exploded and crumbled into the underground, Steve covers Tony and quickly pulls him under him as the compound crumbles over on top of them.
The battle continued, they ignored when Tarleton started to mock Thor, calling him a false god, that he should have stayed where he was, he did what he was supposed to do. In response, Thor destroyed other of his DreadBots.
"Have you all lost your senses?" was the first thing Thor asked angrily when they all regrouped in the front of the ship near the war table.
The toddler smiled excitedly being so high up as he began his order. “I want a happy meal! I want some chicken nuggets and some fries and some apples!” he said with a cute little smile.
He shook his head. “No bud, that’s not bad,” he continued to keep his voice low. “You can be mad at me though,"
“I don’t mind at all- I need to change though, still got the suit you know,” Steve let a soft laugh out before hopping off the counter once his husband finished- the two perked their heads up when they heard their little sons feet dashing back down the stairs, he came dashing into the kitchen, wearing one of his silly little makeshift superhero costumes- definitely not fit for McDonald’s. “Ready!” he shouted excitedly.
Steve leans in to the hands of his lover. "I have you now... I just want to think of that, right now." He whispers.
"Does that mean papa can spend more time with us?" Peter asked, just now understanding with wide eyes.
He picked her up and grabbed a juicy pop from the fridge and brought her back to bed as he made them take turns eating it.
Bruce shook his head "Kamala, it's okay...," he softly spoke, crossing his arms across his chest as he gestures his head towards the quinjet. "Um... Why don't you... why don't you go head inside?"
"Who told you that? No, I didn't fight him," Tony shook his head slightly. "He wiped my face for the planet while the Bleeker Street Magician gave away the stone, that's what happened there's no fight, he's an evil-"
Tony smiled with a small chuckled, walking over and kissed the top of his head. "Papa should be coming home soon, what do you want for dinner?"
He knew he couldn't say no to that face so he smiled at him. "Alright alright, as long as it's okay with papa," So Peter turned his attention to Steve giving him puppy eyes as well with a small pout.
Tony nodded as soon as he heard the timer he pressed a soft kiss to Steve's cheek as the door was slammed open. "Alright times up!" Said the birthday boy- hoping his evil plan worked
Tony took a deep breath as he peered at the window before pushing himself up out of the chair turning to Bruce. "I would have gone with Rocket Man," he remarked before he walked to the middle of his RV, leaning down as he pulled up a latch hidden beneath the carpet. "Alright gotta get dressed then," he started down the stairs into the underground passage.
The many curse words going through his head at the moment would have made his brain explode if he didn’t already know how to handle it from the years of anxiety attacks, but he looked at his husband for help in the matter.
Steve walks over and gently takes his hand tightly. "If we fail, we fail together. But I have a feeling... That we won't fail." He whispers and kisses his knuckles. "This will work because my genius husband said it would."
"I'll make sure to get justice for you, no matter what," he muttered softly before jogging away into the mansion to find pieces of old suits.
Tony had made lunch and went outside to find their little girl, walking to her little fort. He smiled kneeling down. "Munch time!" she popped out. "Handss uppp," he laughed softly as she had a little iron man costume. "Where did you find this?" "In da garage," "no more going in the garage missy," he took off the helmet and started walking to the home with her in his arms
Peter slowly nodded as he adjusted himself in the bed wincing at the pain in his ribs looking down at his lap. Why does Steve's name ring the bell? He’s heard it around the compound but he had so many questions now that we’re now unanswered. He looked back up at Steve and decided to just ask him only one since he knew his dad would be coming any minute.  "Y-You were an Avenger too?" He asked, still a little stuttery.
Steve nods and smiles softly. "Of course, Pete. I'll move back to New York." He whispers and smiles.
Steve was driving back home, continuously worriedly looking back in the mirror to see if he was calming down, and luckily it looked like Peter was slowly relaxing in his father's arms. He started to just sniffle once finally calm while his dad continued to rock him as Peter just fell into a deep sleep after the whole ordeal that happened.
"He was born the same year we broke up- T-Tony," he choked up a little. "O-Oh god what have I done Nat- 2016-,"
Steve held Peter close and smiles softly. "C'mon. Let's get the juice pops then go back up to check on Tony."
"They expose them to near-lethal amount D.A.R.K terrigen," Nat steps in, crossing her arms across her chest.
Fuck tony was panicking as he told the others he was going after peter and getting him help as he sent his suits to help knowing he wouldn’t be back, he found him, he looked like he took a plane to the body. He picked him up and without thinking he knew Wakanda was the best bet to help him, he wasn't a doctor and the hospitals would see the spiderman suit. He flew off sending T'challa a message he was on the way and to prepare a room for Peter in panic. When he arrived he was met by Shuri and other scientists with one of those hologram stretchers. T'challa told him he prepared a room for Tony knowing he wouldn't leave his son’s side.
Tony took the go lass gratefully and drank it up before setting it aside, slowly bringing himself to sit up ignoring the iv pain as he looked at steve in shock.
Steve snuck off during the next night, walking off towards the medical ward. Even if he was sleeping he wanted to at least sit there and be there for him. He knew to make this right he needed to be there for the brunette and make sure he never feels abandoned never again.
Taking a deep breath trying to stop his shaky hands as he slipped into his bathroom, staring into the mirror as he applies his shaving cream and slowly raises his razor, and slowly started the process of making himself look presentable and not like a hobo. He just needed to take his baby steps.
Steve smiles and nods at Tony. "Thanks, Tony." He gently kisses his son's head. "I love you bud." He whispers to his son.
Peter gave a tiny nod. "Why does Papa always work so much? Whys is he never here?" He asked his dad sadly. Once they first adopted him, he was always their number one priority and his pops was always home. Now it's like he has only one dad, it was like his dad lived somewhere else.
Without saying anything he turned to his RV and gestured for the two to follow with his head, his arms slightly shaking as he plopped himself at his desk after fast walking inside, scooting forward in his chair.
He pulled steve back smiling with every kiss. "Alright stinky boy, shower time, kisses after," he joked a little unwrapping his arms
In response, Steve gave him a little shrug, not seeming very bothered. “Which car?” He asked curiously- of course with their kind of money and Tony’s obsession with cars- they had plenty of options.
"No, but it's something even better that i think you'll like, now please just hurry your super-soldier ass over here now!"
"Okay, okay," Steve cut him off taking a deep breath. "Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything,"
Slowly approaching it with caution until he was right in front of it, shakingly raising a hand to touch his cheek. "J-J?" he croaked, his eyes watery. "S-scan the life form for any identification..,"
Steve turned his head to look back at him, tears building up. "I had to do something- The entire San Andreas fault was about to blow- the ocean would have consumed the city- millions would have died if i didn-hmph-," he was cut off when Tony leaned down pressing his lips against his own, shutting him up instantly letting their lips mold perfectly against each other, sparks flying around them. They shared kisses like this on the satellite but this time they weren't worried about dying in space, about being attacked by AIM again. It was slow and passionate, felt like their first kiss all over again to the genius.
"Oh no..," Kamala muttered under her breath. "We have to get out of here," she immediately jumped onto her feet checking through the blinds.
Steve nods and smiles brightly as he gets out of the car. "Alright. Let's go in, then. I can't wait to see him."
"Eager," he muttered with a smirk before sliding in his tongue, kneading his fingers into his ass cheeks earning Tony's gasps and moans, a hand reaching back pushing his head into him deeper, his head lolling to the side as it goes deeper, adding a finger in after a while.
Steve chuckles and pecks his lips again. "We will get Peter back." He whispers. "I know we will. I believe in us."
The fight lasted what seemed like forever- well it felt like that to Tony- his boosters were drained and destroyed, he knew he wasn’t going to win, he wasn’t gonna make it out alive it felt like, two super soldiers versus a failing iron man suit it was obvious who was gonna win when he ripped off Barnes metal arm- he few he messed up big time a minute later he was back against the concrete, his mask was torn off and all he saw was a flash of red, white, and blue smashed down deep into his chest plate, his arc reactor went dead. He heard the sound of steve collapsing near him before soon standing up but instead of grabbing the shield out of his chest he left it there and went to go to his bucky- he didn’t say anything as they left- he was left there cold, alone, hurting- everywhere especially his stomach-
"No no, I was just leaving," the other male responded as he stood up heading him to the door. "I know you need this time anyways," he wished him luck before leaving the room.
"We failed him," He choked up, his eyes full of pain as he immediately turned away shakily heading back to his grill as silence hung in the air brought back the memories of A Day. He flipped over some of the hot dogs as he brought his plastic cup to his mouth sipping on his luke-warm coffee.
Turning to his asleep husband, nudging him hoping to wake him up, softly speaking. "Doll, hey..., hey you...," he croaked. "You know where Peter went off to?"
"Papa!" the toddler said excited giggling happily as his Papa picked him up and spun him around after he hugged his leg
Tony made small conversation as his dad talked about how his wife was pregnant and names. He was hating every second he just wanted to snap.
Since Peter woke up, Tony hadn’t left his side at all, afraid if he left for anything Peter would slip into a coma or something could go wrong. So here he was with Peter's first physical therapy after doing leg lifts and all, he was on crutches slowly but surely they were making their way around the ward before they’d go back to the room. They were making small talk about what Peter was doing in the school at the time especially what he was catching up on online. When they were walking Tony had looked up at that moment thinking they were about to turn a corner and when they did he spotted Steve and Natasha freezing up in his spot. Peter noticed and looked confused as he stopped as well, so his dad did know mister steve, he knew he could trust steve now. "D-dad can we talk about something-?"
"I agree, it feels more right than the past 15," he got off the couch. "Should we just leave him? He looks peaceful,'
Steve chuckles and kisses him again. "Well, I knew you could." He laughs cutely and kisses his lips again and again.
He nods and looks to the side slightly. He still felt guilty for everything he did so he believed that he deserved a punch in the teeth.
"Maybe another day okay Petes?" He asked hoping he wouldn't throw another tantrum, god he hoped it wouldn't. But of course, Peter started to tear up at this.
Steve stayed by Peter's side and gently holds his hand and plays with his hair gently. "I've got you, Peter." He whispers and gently kisses his forehead.
Once both shirts were off, he reconnected their lips once more, rougher as they made out on the bedspread, jerking their crotches together smiling in satisfaction when he heard Steve moan in reply.
"Yeah, you're damn right you deserved it!" Tony furrowed his eyebrows pointing a finger at him. "Do the Avengers pose a danger to society? That was the question, Bruce, THAT was the question,"
Steve chuckles at the pen and reaches for Tony's hand but stops as Tony stuffs his hands in his pockets, frowns at his reaction, and looks away to the side.
He moved one of his hands to Tony's hip lightly stroking it as he used the other to flick at Tony's sensitive nipples as he slowly starts flicking his hips up into Tony, lightly groaning, fuck it felt so good after being away for 3 years.
"Yeah definitely," he laughed. "Alright one pop before bed and that’s it, you should be in bed, didn’t papa put you to bed?"
Tony paused on that as he turned himself to face Steve, a breath caught in his throat in disbelief. But his gaze spotted Thor who was playing with his thumbs, staring off into space.
"I promise we'll go down sometime tomorrow okay? Papas coming home soon and it's been a long day for both of us okay? It's also a bit mess down there right now okay?"
Steve paused, his eyes reading over the same file over and over- he couldn't believe his eyes- he caused that? Why didn't Tony tell him this? His eyes reverted to the date of when Tony was admitted at 2 months- wait...
Steve frowns as he walks over. "You don't know that until we try." He says softly. "It's worth a shot if there's a possibility of getting them back."
Tony was about to close to getting a heart attack. "That's lovely- but come down, daddy is trying not to die here!" he watched as his son laughed as he looked around before he climbed back up onto the branch and continued to climb up higher up the tree.
Peter smiled at this before he rushed off to go play with his toys. The first thing he got was a nerf gun, coming back with it into the kitchen as he started shooting his dad with it making little "pew pew" noises as he usually did with most toys.
Tony pulls out his phone frowning when he hasn’t received any call or texts from peter- but Clint’s phone went off it was his wife- poor baby looked like he was gonna cry
Steve smiles as he watches Tony sign the papers. He helps him by holding the papers down and then kisses Tony's cheek. He then turns to Peter and smiles faintly. "Pete... Would you be mad if I signed too?" He asks softly.
"Steve, you gotta see this!" Nat called the supersoldier on the radio. The soldier was in the middle of his nightly workouts, beating his wrapped pale knuckles against the sandbag before sending it across the room, it always has happened so he had a few extras laying off to the side. Wiping his face off with the towel on his shoulder walking over to his duffel bag grabbing his radio and bag.
As he left, Steve sighed putting his face in his hands as he sunk to his knees, with a frown, feeling a hand on his shoulder. “I really screwed up didn’t I, Nat,”
Tony walks closer to him, slowly as he moves his hand to gently touch Steve's face, carding his finger tips through the short soft hairs on his cheek.
He came to a few hours later, at least that's how it looked , through the window he could see it was dark.
Tony removed himself from Steve's side to kneel in front of him, his hand on Steve's shoulder, the other on the back of his neck.
His vision begins to blur, and suddenly, everything goes dark, but not before he sees a flash of ungodly red white and blue...
Everything went dark around him, and Steve didn't resist. If this was his time then so be it. At least he's going to die knowing Tony didn't hate him. And that was enough for him...
It is 100 % not an illusion, Thanos is dead, the infinity stones where scattered across the universe a la Dragon Ball GT but because lazy writing and bad writer they got them bskc and used the gauntlet to reverse all the damage Thanos had done.
When he woke up the sun was going down , his headache had subsided to a dull throb in the back of his head.
Late February , Steve has convinced him to see the city as an average person, which meant taking the subway everywhere.
Tony went to the kitchen not wanting to deal with that voicemail anymore, he picked out a good scotch and drank it straight from the bottle.
"Didn't Bucky tell you? We saved the world. Well if you want to get technical it was Nebula. Cut that ugly purple bastards head right off. And we managed to get everyone back."
the cushions with little grace, it was so comfortable he had passed out as soon as his body realized it was in a soft surface.
"You saved the world buddy" Bucky smiled soflty at him, taking Steve's hand in his and giving a gentle squeeze.
"And you know? I know why... I know you'll just come crawling back , because, cause, I know that no one, NO ONE will ever put up with you  and your fucking bullshit and your baggage"
"Yes Tony... It's me..." Steve smiles bashfully. He had let his beard grow out and his hair was dark, it gave him a much more weathered appearance.
"I love you too Steve, even if you royally fucked me over, I love you, you and your perfect fucking teeth."
Steve's words are slurred and drawn out, as if he was... Drunk? Tony pondered for a second what Steve might have gotten into to actually get him hammered.
Not surprisingly there was no one else at the compound at the time. Natasha had left around a month ago, only saying she needed some time away from everyone. Rhodey was currently undergoing physical therapy at a rehab center, and had been staying there for the past week. Vision was away simply observing human life and normal interactions.
The punch had caught him completely off guard knocking him backwards. He could taste blood where is teeth had sliced into the inside of his lip, and he was sure his front tooth was loosened a little.
Considering he wasn't completely conscious he decided now would be the best time to listen to that voicemail.
Steve- Cap, fighting him... standing above him... about to plunge his shield down into his neck... then slamming it into the arc reactor of the suit... then him walking away carrying Barnes...
With maximum effort he tried to make it back indoors. It took much longer than he expected, he had stumbled quite a lot finding the door back into the compound but he did manage to get in.
Screaming, crying, insulting, anything typical of just being told by your partner of 3 years that they want out.
It was soft and slow, it felt like time had stopped around them and it was only them. No fighting, no peril. Nothing but them together.
They kiss softly, Steve's lips were still cold, and Tony has to stop himself from calling him Capsicle
Whether this was real , the afterlife, or some illusion created by the infinity stones, Steve didn't care.
It was probably better for him and everyone else if no one was around while we drowned himself in liquor.
Bucky, Peter, The Guardians, Sam, Strange, Wanda, T'Challa... They wouldn't be embarking on what felt like the final mission with half a team... If only he had been honest with Tony...
Steve nods and smiles softly. "I think that's best." He whispers and sighs softly. "I want to be with you... I want to forget everything that happened and I want to start over..."
Kamala's eyes widen as she quickly comes over to the computer to look at the green chat box that appeared.
Tony huffed and just nodded. "Fine, just for you," the videos just continued up till peters 15 birthday and an award he got at school
Steve looks away slightly. He looks down and feels a tear run down his cheeks. "I... I'm sorry Tony..." He whispers.
He shakes his head. "Steve I know I've conquered alot of things like time travel, 49 iron man suits that can fly all around with a small arc reactor I made from scraps to keep me alive, but I have never been able to make an expanding suit,"
"Not yet but he will soon, can you change out of these pajamas? Put something nice on for papa?" replied with a soft chuckle.
Avengers and SHIELD tried to rectify the situation but it was Dr.Banner's testimony that brought about the end of an era. They had turned San Francisco into an infectious, gas-filled quarantine zone as the council told them. That they had unleashed diseased powerful beings that wreak havoc throughout the nation, many that are unidentified. And Bruce was the one to tell the judge that yes, he believed the Avengers were a danger to society.
"Honestly at the exact second," Tony pointed a soft finger at the raccoon he's never met before or seen. " I thought you were a build a bear,"
"I'll send him a message okay? Maybe he'll take some time off for you," He spoke softly as he pulled out his Stark phone and sent a text to his husband before he stuffed his phone back in his pocket with a light sigh as he continued to eat his omelet.
"Where is the lab Monica?" Bruce started, laying against the other metal chair. "You can reverse engineer Terrigen, sure- but it will be catastrophic and you know it! You were there on A Day you saw what happened, it will endanger both Inhumans and innocent citizens,"
He smirked adding his third, moving his other hand to wrap it around Tony's waist to keep him steady watching the male just shiver in pleasure as he fell forward on his chest, his hands in Steve's blond hair, gripping on it tightly as the blonde's fingers stroking his inner walls so deliciously good, grazing against that one place that made him go so godly crazy and sent him into so much pleasure.
His eyes widen as he blinked- his hand slapped over his mouth as he leaned back in his chair. "Shit-," he said out loud.
After he turned off the helmet he grabbed the blanket he had found on the ship laying down on the cold metal floor curled up. Fuck he just wanted to go home, be with the man he loved. Their last date was before Steve had to go off the grid because of their stupid government. He dazed off wondering if Steve looked any different from the last time he saw him if he still loved him if he'd come back to him. What if he finally realized Tony wasn't enough for him and decided to go back to his best friend?
Steve ended up walking out in just some sweatpants, smiling at the sight as he walked over bringing the two into a hug. Tony kissed both of their heads with a smile. "Alright, alright, bedtime for the three of us,"
"Yeah look at it... Smart," he looked back at her gesturing with his head towards his screen. "See? They encrypted it to look like a corrupt file." he chuckled silently at her amazement, her eyes sparkled. "Need a few hours, I'll get all the rest."
Deciding to give the kid a break, he lightly chuckled as he pressed a kiss to his forehead. "Now go play, I'll make omelets for breakfast,"
He gently wraps an arm around Tony's shoulders and kisses his head gently. "Hey... We can't change that but I'm here now... The past is the past. We need to think about the future. Tell me about him when he was little. Tell me stories. Catch me up." He says softly. "It's the next best thing."
Tony joined them after a couple of seconds after letting Peter go off to greet his dad and well he's been gone the whole day so it's rude to not come to greet him.
Peter nodded brightly as he jumped out of his bed towards his closet, browsing through his clothes as he bounced in his spot before pulling out his Captain America costume holding it up to his dad. "Imma wear dis one!"
After waking up, fully cut out of the dead iron man suit, he was told that he was on the brink of death if Vision hadn't found him in time he could've lost his little one too.
Steve nodded gently, starting to scrub off filth on his body as Tony started cleaning himself as well. "I have a plan that I need to tell you about later, it involves Peter,"
Tony immediately stood up using the table as support, knocking over a glass or two that was in front of him. "You know what I need? A shave," continuing as he begins to rip out the IV in his arm. "And I believe I remember-," He hears his best friend Rhodes in the background calling his name as he rips it out a bit painful as he began raising his voice a little. "Otherwise that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world remember that? Whether it impacted other precious freedoms or not that's what we needed,"
"It's good to see you too, Bruce," Nat smiled softly back at him before walking past him, dragging her best friend away to the jet, Bruce following along after being lost in thought.
"Here take this, you find him and put that thing on- and you damn hide," he spoke before he collapsed on the spot, barely conscious to hear someone calling his name.
Steve nods. "She never told me she was with Peter but I think that's because she wanted you to be able to..."
Soon the support group ended, Morgan clung onto her papa as the people started leaving, Tony was up giving his best to another gay dude who talked about his date with a new guy.
Once he was finally pulled down, he sprawled wildly while crying in anger, balling his fists up, whining."Nooo!" His favorite thing to do was run away from his dad and hated it when he got caught.
"Dude- your password was I AM IRON MAN," she lightly snickered but kept the seriousness in her voice, making him pause slightly- jeez how many years ago was that?
Peter pouted at this, going back to his playroom and busied himself with playing pretend- but after his son left, he sighed in relief silently wishing he had a certain super soldier home to help him out. He lightly rolled his eyes, he dropped out just so he could be with his new family so why couldn't Steve do the same? Taking another deep breath, he finished up the two omelets for them both before calling out for Peter to come down for breakfast.
“What about my ice cream papa?” Peter cut in before he could say that was all, which made Tony mentally facepalm, cursing at himself for forgetting, immediately apologizing to him, and ordered a vanilla ice cream cone. He pulled out his wallet as the total was being read at him giving the cashier his card as he handed over Peter to Steve.
The philanthropist lightly chuckled at the remark and began digging into his food with a hum, occasionally looking at the young boy making sure he didn’t choke on anything. He watched Peter eat his ice cream happily, even though he was going way too fast. He had ended up giving himself a brain freeze from the cause. “Owwie! Brain Freeze!” He spoke, moving one of his little hands to his head but once he did though, his hand sort of instinctively shot a web across his face while having this terrible brain freeze that he’s never had to experience, it was terrifying.
Tony hummed lightly, gave his husband a quick peck on the lips before turning his head to his son.."Yeah bubs, he's gonna spend alot more with us,"
"Gonna need a stronger table then..," he muttered lightly as he shut up immediately watching how Bruce's eyes went back to normal and slowly but quickly took a seat, rubbing unconsciously at his knuckles, ignoring Monica's comment on how things never changed.
Tony tried to sitting up more but he felt really dizzy all of a sudden everything just seemed blurry
Things might be able to go back to normal after they take down AIM tomorrow, for now, we see what the future has to bring and hope that nothing will ever break them apart again.
Tony blushes as he pecked his lips back. "Love you too be safe," he kissed him again chuckling hearing Morgan say 'ewww' pulling back. "Hey hey hey, adults are allowed to do this,"
He shrugged slightly humming lightly as his hair was stroked. "Why do you think I have so many Marks?"
“He’s a superhero Petes, remember?” he told him with a soft smile. “He keeps the monsters away,” he lightly chuckled as he pulled out his phone, looking for a picture to show him.
He gives him a soft smile but turns back to a frown as he looks back at the envelope. "M-mister Stark was going to adopt me from m-my aunt before I t-turned to dust-"
Peter looked towards the voice as his vision came too, whining at his head hurting, moving a hand up to his head to rub at his temple. "W-where's my dad? H-how did i get here- who are you- where am i-," he kind of just started rambling on with questions nervously.
"Okay doll," Steve nods, just wanting to help Tony relax for right now, there was a small pause as Tony scooted over in the med-bay bed gesturing Steve to crawl in
Steve hugs his little girl tightly but not too tightly. "I love you, princess. You be good for daddy and I'll be back before lunch okay?"
Steve smiles as his little girl runs over to the living room with pepper, smiling as he watches Morgan.
Teeth clanking, lips messily drooling down their chins as Steve starts going faster, as they moan into each other's mouths. Tony cups Steve's cheek muttering praises as they slowly reach each other's highs as his hand moves to his hair, gripping it, his whole body feeling like it was in heaven right god.
"Mm, that's true, a little spider suit... his birthday is coming up anyway... we just need to keep him away from the basement,"
It took him all his might to not punch him in his perfect teeth. He took a deep breath before turning to face the man he loved for so long, he looked down before looking him in the eye.
In reply, the super-soldier stuck his tongue out before he headed into the master bathroom. "I'm sick of your sass, you never appreciate the work I do for this family," He chuckled grabbing his own comfy clothes from the closet nearby.
After hanging up and thanking the woman, Steve didn't know what to do. He was heartbroken, to say the least. He had no one after the snap. His best friend Bucky was gone, Wanda... Vision was killed by Thanos... Sam..T Challa.. all he had left was Romanoff, Shuri, and Banner, Thor stayed with them after the war, he couldn't bear it anymore he had lost his home... Asgard and about everyone in it along with his childhood friend who was also his adopted brother, poor Thor, wanted revenge for his brother.
Steve smiles and kisses Tony's cheek again. "come on in guys." He smiles and opens the door for his friends.
He knew he couldn't say no cause he was reading his mind, god he missed this man. Without even giving him an answer he reconnected their lips, pressing their clothed bodies together, deepening the kiss, shivering at the touch of Steve's fingertips as he ran his hands under his pajama shirt. Becoming more desperate and needy, he pulled back only for a second to pull both of their shirts off, of course, he got stuck on his own, struggling to get out of it, having to tell Steve to shut up as he heard him laughing at his mistake.
“We’ll talk about this later, okay?” He tried his best to calm the situation, he wasn’t ready for this conversation just yet and neither was his husband.
Steve looked over at Peter and Tony and smiled slightly. Every time he saw his ex and his son, he felt regret and guilt come boiling into his chest. Natasha notices and then looks over at Tony and waves softly, wanting to seem friendly to him still. She leads Steve away so that if he broke down, which she understood if he did, he wouldn’t do it around Tony and Peter.
Tony kinda kept his distance conversing with Bruce and all, Peter frowned he wanted his parents together that's all, so he had an idea. "As the birthday boy, i say we play 7 minutes in heaven,"
"Pillow Princess," Steve lightly rolled his eyes with a smile on his face, pushing all the way in. He gently rubbed circles on the other male's back, his lips curling into a smirk as he was gasping. "Hmmm, should I take my time with you or give you what you want?" he paused thinking, giving the male time to adjust to his girth as he leaned forward, pressing a kiss to his cheek. "I think ill go slow... make you beg," he hummed snapping his hips forward softly, rolling his hips slowly, ignoring the whines coming from the bottom as he sped up leaning over placing kisses on his jaw before tony turns his head to the side reconnecting their lips, pushing his hips back to meet his thrusts.
"His room is next to yours, ill clean up around here," he gave a soft smile before starting to clean up
He instantly shakes his head. "No... You're fine, kiddo. You don't have to apologize..." He was so happy to see his son, but he was heartbroken to know that Tony had never once mentioned him to his own son. He was actually kind of pissed but he didn't show it. "It's okay, Peter. Is there anything you need? I'm here to help so if you need anything, just ask."
At 15 he got bit by a radioactive spider and became spiderman with the support of tony and the rest of the team, the two fought side by side nothing too big but the day that the Chitaturi came back- they had Thor and Bruce back but it wasn't enough and peter was smashed into a building with the big alien thing.
Tony continued till they got to present day, the necklace that was on his neck that had the engagement rings that were the twos rings, were in peters hands he was fumbling with them reading the engravings in the inside as he listened to Tony, it was quiet as he took it all in.
"Doll, please," the man lightly whined, traveling his hands down to cup his ass cheeks, giving them a light squeeze earning a soft moan from Tony. "Its been forever... and i missed you and just want to appreciate what's in front of me...,"
"Doll, there was something buried, deep beneath the bay... somehow linked to the reactor, working its way to the surface every minute,"
"That's me! I big and strong like papa!" Peter said as he held up his arms, flexing his small muscles.
"Whoa, do i see the Captain America drinking? Dear, i must be dreaming," he laughed softly. "I'm doing alright i guess, how bout you?"
Steve sighed as he relaxed laying back on the bed, petting the boy's hair softly. "I think he's good and knocked out now, can I tell you what I had in mind?"
A week later, Steve had convinced Natasha to let them stay for a little while longer. He wanted to be around his son a little longer. Even though he was never able to speak to Peter again, being able to see him around and make sure he was doing okay was comforting at the least. At this point, Steve was sitting outside of a room with Natasha, talking, and trying to make sense of a lot of the confusion.
He pulled back just resting his forehead on Steves, lightly stroking the hairs on the back of his neck. "Fuck it's been forever,"
“Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.”
Steve kisses her forehead and smiles. "I love you, baby girl." He says before handing her back over to Tony. He then kisses Tony once more. "and I love you, babe." He whispers and smiles.
"Bunch of tired old meals," He started his way towards Steve continuing his rant. "I got nothing for you Cap, no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options- zero zip nada," he paused looking right at him. "No trust, you fucking lying piece of shit of a boyfriend, I needed you but you left me,"
Tony's lips curled into a small. "Cause someone's got to watch this little bug," He said before raising his son and started blowing raspberries, his son's squeals of stops but his giggles are the cutest thing his dad has ever heard.
He holds onto Tony and cries softly, burying his head in his chest. "I love you... I love you and Peter so much... I-I'm so sorry about everything..." He whispers.
"Wait...Tony?" Steve blinked as he tried to pull himself up slightly, barely doing much ." Tony..," he repeated, when he finally started to feel circulation again, he pulled himself to his elbows as he stared at his face, blankly as he ran his fingers over tony's cheek, the two just laying in silence as if this was just a dream to the both of them.
Tony snapped out of it and looked to his son and they started walking again cause that’s all he could think of to do, he didn’t want to turn around either. "Yeah? What’s up kid?"
"Oh, I think you and him both will absolutely love it," pumping some shampoo and conditioner into his hand, scrubbing it into his scalp and strands of hair. Tony nodded with a hum, finishing up in the shower, and stepped out. "Go keep the little bugger occupied, I'll be out in a minute," Steve spoke as his husband grabbed his towel drying off, getting dressed into his comfy clothes after, and went into the bedroom.
"See if not for these, you wouldn’t be in here," he sat on the table. "I’m trying to do what you call it- that’s an old french so we call it," he kind of started chewing on his fingernails.
"Don't feel bad about this okay?- I'm mean, actually if you grovel about this for a couple of weeks... and then move on with enormous guilt,"
"I know... I do as well bug... i do too," he softly sighed as he sat down on Peter's bed as he held him in his arms, running his hand through his hair, pressing a kiss to the side of his head.
He nods and smiles softly. "Tony... I want to be with you. The last 15 years have been hell because I couldn't have you... My nightmares weren't of me dying while on the run... It was you... Being a family with another man... I missed you so much, Tony."
The boy had to think about this one for a bit- but reluctantly took off his mask with a little ‘fine’ past his lips, just in time for Steve to come downstairs in more comfy clothing asking the two “We ready then?”
A week passed since their talk in the meeting room, Steve had escaped with the winter soldier and gathered up his own team, then the fight at the airport happened, even with his team of heroes against Steve’s, Steve and James escaped and Rhodey came out of the battle paralyzed from the waist down and they were sure he wouldn’t walk again. When Tony finally figured out everything, realizing it wasn’t James’s fault that King of Wakanda was killed, he decided he’d make this all right and thanks to Sam’s cooperation, he made his way to the old Hydra base where he thought nothing else could go wrong.
Steve frowns and stays behind Peter. "Mr. Stark, it's Peter. Peter Parker. We did it, Mr. Stark." Steve comes behind him. "He's going to okay, Queens." He whispers, calling the kid his nickname for him. He bends down and gently kisses Tony's head as he holds his other hand. "Tony? Can you talk to me, baby?"
"I will with aunt pepper!" Morgan nods as she dashes into the house giggles escaping her mouth. Pepper came over earlier to play with morgan.
Tony laughed softly as Morgan got down from his arms and ran at her papa excitedly. "I was about to call a search party," he joked greeting his husband
The super soldier looked over at his family as he spoke. “You want to have Peter order for himself?”
Steve looks over at him slightly, clearly, he has been crying for the last couple of hours. "I deserved what happened... But I still care about you..."
As the party ends, Steve frowns, wondering if Tony wanted him to leave. He sat on the couch and was now wondering if he should go tell Peter bye.
Tony smiled at him. "I bet..," he still felt so guilty, he took 16 years of their son's life from him over stupid accords
Steve nods. "I know bud... Me too." He sighs and smiles softly. "Let's talk to Dad together, okay?" He whispers and gently brushes his hair away from his face. "Maybe we can talk him into something."
It was still hooked up to many wires but still was in working order just as he last left it years ago, thank god AIM never looked for the Chimera since everyone taught it was a goner.
"I-i met an old colleague of y-yours- his name is Steve- and well- he’s really cool and nice- who was he, Dad? W-why have i never heard of him?" He tilted his head.
They needed all hands on deck when JARVIS was finally back online and took care of the rest of the enemies. It came to no ones surprise that Monica had escaped, they didn't need her anymore anyway, big robots had plopped themselves on the Chimera as it looked like they were drilling into it. What did come as a shock was when lightning and rain started to come down from the sky and a thud from the far end of the ship.
The hospital aid tilted their head. “I wouldn’t know the answer to that I do apologize- I only know that the King and his sister would go visit the uh- compound for a week”
"Have i seen you around before?" He asked, he was holding flowers and sauerkraut. "What’s your name feller?"
He blinked slowly as he slowly took the thumb drive, staring at it in his hands. He must be dreaming, there's no way this was real at all.
"What position would you feel more comfortable in doll hm?" He asked his eyes looking at him full of love as he pulled his hand away watching the brunette's cheeks flush.
"Well i think she wanted an excuse to have a juice pop," he wrapped his arms around his husband’s neck. "Or wanted to see why daddy was cursing,”
"No no you need your rest dol-," the nickname spilled as he forces Tony back down. He was surprised when Tony put one of his hands on top of Steve's bigger ones. "I-am s-,"
He swiped with a face with a wet towel having the faucet run as he looked up into the small mirror with a slight smile.
“Yeah that’ll work, here- you take the keys and get in the car,” He handed over the keys as he started packing up the leftover food back in the back they were served in as Tony headed out to the car in the parking lot, getting in after unlocking it and continued to try to calm down, rocking him in the seat as he waited for his husband to get back. As Peter was slowly calming down after all that, Steve finally joined them in the car, tossing the leftovers into the passenger seat as he started the car. “Still not calm?’ he asked with a worried glance back at them.
Tony smiled as he bounced the little dude before he put in his order of two cheeseburgers and some fries with a vanilla shake, Steve ordered his Big Mac with a side of fries and a drink.
Tony had woken up with a start from laying his head on his workbench, immediately checking the time- god how long was he out for? He wasn't planning to fall asleep down in the lab while he was working. He knew his husband was still out or he would be in their bedroom- maybe alone while he was taking care of his son or they'd be cuddling as their son comes to wake them up giddy. While his AI was reading the time as he was wiping the drool off his chin, he realized his son has been unsupervised for the past few hours. He immediately rushed out of his lab after locking it, looking for Peter.
Tony shook his head in response, lightly huffing. “I just at least wanted to treat it for you-,” he said as he pulled him into the kitchen, bending down to pull out the first aid kit from under the sink as he questioned. “Didn’t you promise to come home early?”
"And you say I'm the sappy one here," The blonde lightly laughed as he set his shield down against the wall, pulling him close to his chest as he let his body guide him backward let his body hit the bed with Tony on top of him, ignoring the whine he got in return.
"W-we really did?" Tony looked at him in the eyes weakly smiles. Most of the heroes had gathered around already
"Holy crap, Thor?! Where the hell did you come from?!" Tony blinked as he turned his head towards the god of thunder before immediately going back to fighting.
Peter gasped at hearing this. "Pleasseeeeee, can I go lookies? I wanna see some robots!" speaking hyper and excitedly
"Daddy watch this!" Peter shouted excitedly as he attached a web to the branch then went upside down on the branch only attached by a web string.
He takes a deep breath, he wanted to shot and tell him the news, maybe it would make him change his mind- they could be a family- but the damage was done and just watched leave shaking his head as he grabs steve's ring stuffing both rings in his pocket, a hand on his slightly bump muttering softly. "Just you and me now peanut,"
He rolled his eyes at Steve’s words finally turning his head to him pointing a finger. "You know what? I was going to tell you, that day in that room once you signed the accords i thought of telling you over a candlelight dinner with his sonogram but nooo, nothing would have made you stayed, not even your own damn finance’," he pushed his finger against steves chest harshly. "I don’t care what you think of me but we've been over for goddamn 15 years and nothings going to change that because you hurt me the worst way you could have, i don’t care if you go see him- go right ahead- if you want to see your son but once he’s healed we're leaving," Tony glared before he started walking off stuffing his hands in his front pants pockets
"Here take this, you find him and put that thing on- and you damn hide," he spoke before he collapsed on the spot, barely conscious to hear someone calling his name.
There was a sudden loud bang over on the Golden Gate bridge, pieces of the bridge would fly everywhere along with the vehicles that were driving on top, immediately families were, screaming, running around the ship, while security guards were trying to rush its passengers on quinjets and onto the ground as the Avengers immediately set to figure out this was.
"Well that didn't work out did it?" Steve cut in, his face continued to keep a blank face hiding all emotions, he hated seeing him like this.
"You know I'm only kidding," Steve chuckled, getting up and walked over towards Tony, hands-on his hips. "Promise me you'll head to the stage on time at least alright?"
"What if Peter wants to join?" Steve asked curiously. "You know how needy he is," he hummed as he stripped off his belt and pants after turning on the shower to warm up.
Tony brought her in his arms. "Good job, I’m saved," he lightly laughed, holding her close as he stood up. "I wish you guys came to ask me something else, anything else. Honestly happy to see you guys-,"
He lightly hummed, pulling the alcohol-soaked pad off and used the small bandages putting two on the scratch luckily not needing any stitches. “Mhm, Peter suggested it when I asked what he wanted for dinner- if you don’t mind,”
Steve nodded, deciding not to push for more information except for the boy’s name- which was Peter- as he followed one of the aids to an open recovery and started preparing it, pulling on new sheets, setting up equipment. When he spots Natasha again he gives the boy’s name asking her to give as much information she can get on the boy before she runs off again to the records room before going back to his job.
Steve decided he had enough of his beard, so he headed off to his bedroom's bathroom grabbing a new razor Nat bought for him and shaving cream and just carefully begun shaving every hair till there was none left.
Steve nodded  “Of course, You and Peter go first though, make sure he doesn’t order the whole menu or something,” He spoke with a light laugh.
"It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth," Rhodey cut off Natasha for a second before she continued.
"S-steeb- fuck...," He watched Tony's head as his eyes squeezed shut as he was eased onto Steves cock, his fingernails digging into Steve's forearm probably gonna leave marks by the morning, his head buried in his neck, he felt Tony's teeth nibbling at his neck, he knew Tony was trying to quiet himself but he was going to be very loud when Steve would start moving. He moved so he was laying back onto his back, pulling Tony with him, still inside of him.
They let the silence take over, only the sounds of the engine's lowly humming are echoing throughout the Chimera. They made they wouldn't be bothered tonight, telling everyone they wanted the night for themselves, no questions asked.
Steve frowns and looks up at him. "Tony, it’s not like that, you know that. He's my best friend. He didn't do anything after Nat and I got him back."
He turned Tony onto his side as he leaned up positioning himself behind Tony, pushing himself back into Tony, grasping the youngers hips as his thrusts were much stronger and faster, Tony's moans were music to his ear. He felt his lips curl into a smile as Tony grabbed for Steve's hand using his other hand to start stroking himself bringing them both closer and closer to each other's orgasms.
"We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now, few deep space scans, satellites and we got nothing," Steve paused before he looked at his lover. "Tony you fought him,"
"Oxygen will run out by tomorrow morning and well... that'll be it," Tony eyes heavied a little. "And Steve I... I said no more surprises before you went off the grid... and I gotta say I was really hoping to pull off one last one.. but.. it looks like- well you know what it looks like,"
"Scour the Earth, you will not find our lab," Bruce proceeded to ignore the woman as she raised her voice. "The Adaptoids will launch Bruce!" she watched Bruce turned around to face her as the doors closed and the angrier she got. "Saving the world requires sacrifice!"
"I will, can you put the food in the fridge for me?" he asked with a smile, leaning up to press a kiss to his cheek before heading to their son's room after hearing a confirming reply from his husband. After tucking him in, making sure the nightlight was plugged in and made sure he had his favorite stuffed animal, he headed out of the room with the door slightly ajar and went out to join Steve on the couch, smiling at the arm that was wrapped around him.
'Shit, Shit' he cursed in his head as he tapped the reactor in his chest, to let his recent Iron Man suit, - he always made sure he updated them in case of emergencies- Mark 85 wrapped around his body as he immediately flew up to grab his son, Peter immediately started throwing a tantrum, whining about wanting to keep climbing.
He rolled his eyes lightly. "If you promise me a good time maybe," he laughed jokingly shooing him off upstairs as he went to the study sitting down. “Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a Mobius strip, inverted, please,” in front of the holographic table, he starts looking into this time heist thing and the atoms
"Well, he's pissed," everyone's attention turned to the rodent, Rocket, who was sitting next to Nebula. "He thinks he failed- which of course he did but there's a lot of that going around ain't there,"
"So very big and strong!" He cooed as he started blowing raspberries onto his little neck as his son started squealing and laughing, squirming in his arm. They both paused at the sound of the door opening and closing, and Peter immediately squirming away from Tony dashing towards the missing parent with a gleeful shout as he jumped into the arms of his exhausted pops, who was covered in dirt and small scratches but he managed to pull off a tired smile for Peter who he pulled up in his arms after the boy dropped his items.
As the door panels finally opened, he had to squint his eyes at the sudden bright light coming from the inside- whatever was in there, it was kept frozen as puffs of cold air released around this shadowy figure was slowly being brought out. Looked as if they were chained up- he was right about they were trying to keep it in.
"I'm trying to follow my morals too, tony...." Steve felt tears poke his eyes and he tries to bury them as he slides off his ring. "I-I guess that's it then...? One disagreement and it's over...?" He looks down and gets up from the table and sighs. "I still love you, Tony... I do and always will... Even if you hate me..." He walks toward the door. "I'm still not signing the accords... But I still love you... I love you, Anthony Stark..." He then walks out and leaves the room before he starts sobbing.
It starts with Steve running in out of breath while Tarleton is typing away at a screen while. "George, we have to shut down the reactor- it's pulling us towards that heat signature!"
He whimpered at the heavy rubble on him before squirming his way out. "I’ll be fine," he looked around. "What happened-,"
The first one to greet him was Pepper immediately hugging him, carefully with a strain in her voice letting out a cry.
Tony's cheeks flushed, the offer was really tempting. "I probably need one so sure," he laughed softly walking in the bathroom setting the clothes he had aside, stripping off the clothes he had on from the night before.
The silence took over the room as Tony ripped off the detachable arc reactor, grabbing steves hand, and slammed it into his hand, already becoming breathless from the air supply.
"Well I’m here now, had to put missy to bed again" he popped his neck and strolled into the bathroom with the blonde.
His hate grew for Tarleton that he could punch his computer screen. His fists clenched up as he started trembling in his chair, he didn't even feel the hand on his shoulder. The only word that raced through his mind was why. Why did he smash the reactor? Why did Tarlton lock him in there? When he got his hands on Georgie Boy he was going to make him pay.
"His first word came out of nowhere," he laughed so. "His first word was thwip- don't even know where it came from," he hummed. "Of course i have his first steps, Pep helped- so did Nat when she was here before she left."
Steve nods and smiles as he gently picks Morgan up and sets her in his lap. "Just because the world looks bleak and sad right now, doesn't mean that the future is the same. You can come back from this." He says softly and looking down at Morgan with a smile. "I did. Tony did. Even Morgan did. Just find the courage to take the first baby step and you'll find your light in the darkness."
"Sounds pretty big for an accident," Natasha remarked as they stood by the quinjet staring out at the bridge.
"He would've taken it off years ago, today wouldn't change his mind," she laughed softly. "He spoke his mind, i think you should see him when he wakes up, sort it out"
Peter woke up to many birthday greetings, he got his present from tony and the others and it felt nice, he knew his other dad and aunt Tasha would come later and he was excited bouncing on his heels.
"Steve, can you hear me? Get the hell out of there!" Nat desperately and sternly spoke into the comms, Quinjets were taking off, a blue mist was spreading all around the Chimera as families were desperately trying to get off the ship that was floating and looked like it could blow at any moment, some of the teenagers or adults were passing out on the ground as staff and other standbys had to drag them onto each quinjet.
"Hi, I'm sorry, but who are you?" Tony replied with slight sarcasm as he walked towards the recovering Bruce.
Tony took another deep breath before continuing, angrily gesturing toward the exit noticing Bruce had stopped walking. "So unless you have some kind of astounding proof, I suggest you both get off my land..," He had looked back at Kamala and raised an eyebrow. "What is that," His voice was out of breath like he ran a marathon, but it seemed like it came back as Kamala pulled out some small thumb drive.
Tony's lips curved into a smile as he moved on from the bag over to the bookshelf near the bed, running the tip of his finger over the binder of Steve's rare collectible Encyclpida collection- he remembered how much of an oldies nerd the man was. He never really follow or understand the new world and preferred the old times. Always kept old things spread out around the room, he didn't mind one bit. He could feel the tears already building up- maybe it was cause he tried to push back what happened 5 years ago, try to move on but the guilt haunts him when he's awake... when he's asleep in bed- feels like it will always be on his mind every second of each day.
Morgan nods with a bright smile as she leans into her daddy. "I couldn’ts sleep." She says cutely and smiles brightly up to her daddy.
"Please know.., when I drift off and be like everything lately- I'm fine... I'm totally fine... I dream about you.. because it's always you..," before the recording shut off.
Steve sighs as he and Natasha drive to the compound. He looks up from the package in his hands. He hadn't gotten much just a picture of him and his son in a simple picture frame. He sighs again nervously, hoping that Tony wouldn't be too mad. He looks up at Nat and smiles nervously. "I hope doesn't punish Peter for this." He says softly.
"Because it IS awesome," the man laughed softly looking at her. "A 1.4 billion dollar vanity project- I may incinerate on takeoff but I'll look damn well good doing it,"
"Of course, we could have a glass wall to separate, that way he can play in there while doing your work and watch him at the same time," He said with a huge excited smile.
Steve nods and sighs. "We will never know, Tony." He says softly. "This is our one chance to get them back. To get Peter back."
Tony took a deep breath as he leaned back most likely after turning on his helmet message recording.
They disbanded, broke apart after the death of Captain America. All we have intel on is Thor's mighty hammer has been left at Heroes Park where the fallen Avengers statue stood. No one knows where our heroes have gone, all left without a trace. After the liquidation of Stark Industries, Doctor George Tarleton, himself a victim of A-Day and founder of Advanced Ideas Mechanics has taken over the part of our so-called heroes as their activities are now outlawed. With the idea that science is the solution to our nation's problems. What are George Tarleton's plans for this new era? What will-,"
By the time he got out there, his son was casually sitting in the tree, swinging his legs, he had to be at least 10 feet up in the air. "Hi, daddy!"
Peter was drugged heavily on anesthesia so he was still asleep, the surgeon stepped in seeing Steve and softly nodded. "He'll wake up soon, I’ll let Mr.Stark know sometime after," he knew the relationship of the two, and since it was the first time seeing his son so he wanted him to have a few words at least
He paused again. "So, fuel cells were cracked during the battle and we figured out a way to reverse the iron charge bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time but uh... it's now dead in the water.. 1000 light-years from the nearest 7-11," He always tried to joke in situations like this but he knew Steve wasn't going to laugh.
Steve looks down slightly and gently takes Tony's hand. "I made a huge mistake leaving for Bucky..." He sighs. "And I know you probably still hate me for it... That little speech you gave out there definitely made that clear... I just thought I'd tell you I'm sorry for what I put you through."
"No...," He could barely get out, it came out like a whisper as it sunk in and the sound of Hulk roaring didn't even comprehend to Tony.
Monica already seemed hostile from the start as Bruce walked towards her with shy- maybe he wasn't prepared to face her after not talking since the hearings. Tony immediately recognized the veins showing up in Banner's skin, as Monica tried to defend her tests. Imprisonment and torture was how they were planning to make the world a better place by removing Inhumans. That's all AIM saw them as, people who were evil, people who were sick, they were her test subjects to her experiments.
"Hey Mr. Rogers.., if you find this recording- most likely redhead is showing this to you if she gets this- Don't... Don't post this anywhere this is going to be a real tearjerker- I don't know if you're ever going to see these, I don't even know if you're still,"
He felt her hand on his shoulder, rubbing it reassuringly. "He must've been pregnant during the accords then…,"
Tony groaned, immediately shutting off the TV hung on his RV wall. God how much A Day has haunted him and he ran away from his problems like the only way he knew how. When the Avengers broke up, he left across the country to Utah, no one knew where he was and he was going to keep it that way. Sighing at the night sky and his belly rumbling, deciding on cooking up some of his frozen hotdogs in his fridge outside on his grill, was a little chilly but he just felt numb after all these years.
Steve laughs cutely and gently kisses her forehead. "Okay okay, well... Once upon a time, there once was a King. He lived in a tall tower that looked over his kingdom. It was a peaceful kingdom. Until one day, a God came to hurt his kingdom, bringing the war to the once peaceful kingdom. The king needed help. He needed a team of warriors to help him protect his kingdom. He had multiple heroes; a spy, an Archer, a beast, a God, and then the soldier. They all worked together as The Avengers. But after everything had calmed down at the war, something happened between the King and the Soldier. Do you know what that was, Princess?" He asks her softly.
Tony sat in his wheelchair, he has in one of his hand, an IV hooked up to his other arm as he listened on to the assassin, one eye peering at the now missing heroes, Captian Marvel- now known as Carol Danvers was looking at on another screen, her gaze froze on Nick Fury's picture, eyes slowly moving to the ground.
Tony thought for a minute on that, biting down on his lower lip looking down at Peter. "I mean.. It'd have to be separate from my workspace..,"
"See? It all fits together. You know he's going to want you to make him a suit though," Steve spoke honestly, knowing how the toddler has been wanting to be like his parents.
Notes: Born prematurely at 35 weeks, patient in a lot of stress. Had to be given a cesarean( c-section ). Patient Stark lost a lot of blood, had to be in an induced coma until the body healed correctly.
“There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.”
Tony whined a little tilting his head back, Steve stopped for a moment to strip off both of their shirts and tugged off Tony's sweatpants along with his boxers, running his fingertips over his length still keeping a soft smirk on his face, keeping his eyes on Tony.
Steve sighs and smiles at his son. "Okay... Okay." He walks over and gently kisses his head. "Let me at least get a slice of cake first." He teases.
Steve looked up when he felt a wave of energy pass through him. He looks over to Tony and runs over. "Tony!!" He yells but backs up slightly when Peter then runs in. "Mr. Stark!! Mr. Stark!!"
Steve smiles softly at Tony and reaches for his hand. He didn't know what to say but was happy Tony was giving him another chance
"Okay," He sort of mumbled. Once the web was off, he went over to eat after pulling himself up onto the chair. "When will daddy be home?" He asked with his bug eyes.
Tony paid for the order and waited near the pick-up counter, grabbing the two trays when it came out and walked over to his family, setting them both on the table as he took a seat next to Peter knowing what his husband did there. “And here’s a happy meal and an ice cream cone for Mister Village Boy~,” he said as he passed Peter his food items, he loved the boy dearly and whenever he was dressed up he loved to play along with no matter what.
"No...," Tony shook his head, his voice barely above a whisper now. "No, we failed HIM," he said pointing a finger towards the other male, his voice cracking, tears already threatening to fall out.
Tony froze in his place hearing the two-syllable word turning his attention to the teenage girl once more- the uh Kamala as she said. He noticed how awkward she was by the way she tried to look at him and smiled at him. He noticed the way the size of her hands would increase and decrease whenever she wanted- god he felt even more guilty.
When AIM finally left them alone and retreated, Bruce drove the 3 of them back to the surprisingly intact Chimera just broken down and in immediate need of repairs. Turns out the explosion took out the engines and some of its power since it was running on Terrigen and the Reactor inside. Stepping onto the ship brought back waves of emotions and memories so he headed to his quarters giving the two an excuse he needed to freshen up, he hadn't shaved or cut his hair in 5 years anyway.
Silence came over the group after Bruce and Pepper carried Tony back to the medical wing leaving Nat, Rhodes, Nebula, Carol, and Rocket, along with Steve himself who had to take a seat after the events, putting his face in his hands.
"Kamala- Kamala Khan," He laughed softly. "She's pretty adorable, you'd love her I bet, pretty sure she's a mini you from what I've heard minus the sass, of course,"
He shakes his head. "We both made mistakes. It's okay." He whispers  "I forgive you..." He whispers again
"Well if it isn't my little twin hm?" Steve pressed a kiss to the boy's forehead. "Like father like son hm? You look so adorable in that, it suits you," he teased as Peter started going on a rant about how much he missed him and how his day went, but it was through his mind, so climbing the tree was climbing a skyscraper and being put in timeout was a jail and all that while Tony stood from afar watching the two, listening while he grabbed a water bottle and headed over to the two to greet his husband.
“Is he one of my toys? Is he famous like you daddy?” He asked, gasping, his little dinosaur toys long forgotten. “Are we all famous?”
"Well that didn't work out did it?" Steve cut in, his face continued to keep a blank face hiding all emotions, he hated seeing him like this.
He hands him a pair of sunglasses. "Just don’t look at people hun," he laughed softly as he walked him to the elevator
"Perfect landing... but damnit not much juice left in these repulsors," Tony huffed as he finally got into the satellite without too many problems besides almost being sent back to Earth many times after having to manually remove his booster. "Hope this place isn't crawling with Georgie's guards...,"
He smiled as he watched him pick up his iron man figure and held it up towards him. "Ish Papa!" he said smiling, Tony cooed as Peter got out his little green army men and started playing, making small 'pew pew' noises as he flew the little iron man figure around, knocking them over, acting if these army men were the bad guys.
"Here, Capsicle!" He heard from the other side. His lips curled into a soft smile as he turned the doorknob, opening the door to find Tony dressed up in his Iconic Armor everyone knew well and loved. The reds and golds of his armor shined in the day's sunlight as his arc reactor in his chest shined brightly. Tony turned around from the mirror, flipping the faceplate of his armor up to show his face.
Steve wipes his tears away again. "Yes. I absolutely 100% know he still will, he missed you alot when you went to dust..."
Tony set down his tongs on the side counter beside the grill, turning around to face the two almost kind of pissed off that they're still trying to get him on their side.
Suddenly, everything just began to shake. Was this an earthquake? Steve thought to himself, turning off the water and throwing down his towel as he threw on one of his long shirts and ran out of the room to find a window. What he saw almost made his heart skip a few beats. He spotted a ship being carried by a bright-looking star as it was making a landing in front of the compound. Steve along with the others ran outside to meet the newcomer especially with a hope to see whos inside the ship, I mean there must be a reason for her to bring this here.
“Yeah I know,” He mumbled as he sat on the counter. “I was about to come home- then there was an attack blah blah, but I came home alive and that’s what matters.”
"Who are you and what have you done with Steve Rogers?" he gasped half-heartedly and dramatically putting a hand over his heart. "Steve Rogers would never say such a thing!"
He blushed to bite his lip. "I think he got the talent from you- especially your  immediately apologize for anything,"
"Whoa, holier than though," Nat turned to him pointing an accusatory finger angrily. "Where were you when the world went to shit?!"
"Yeah, and he'll probably take that ring off as soon as he wakes up..." He sighs. "and I don't blame him if he does..."Steve looks over at him slightly, clearly, he has been crying for the last couple of hours. "I deserved what happened... But I still care about you..."
“Hey Village Boy, how about you choose?” Tony asked as he set Peter down on his feet. Once set down, he looked at them all. After a quick inspection, he ran over to a red Corvette that they had, exclaiming. “This one! This one!” excitedly saying, jumping up and down.
He caught up and gently pushed Tony into a wall. "Why didn’t you tell me I had a son?" He asks as his voice breaks and he looks like he's going to start crying.
"Hey... You're okay kid, Relax. You're in a hospital in a country called Wakanda. You're safe." He whispers. "You're dad is here, just in a waiting room. You just got out of surgery. My name is Steve. I know your dad. We... used to work together." He says softly. "The doctor is probably talking to your dad right now."
Steve chuckles and smiles. "His neck and back are going to hurt if we don't move him." He says as he gently picks his son up.
Steve groans and grunts as he pushes the roof off of him and Tony and stands up slightly as he looked around. "Tony? Are you okay?"
He watched Bruce stand up after a moment, shaking his head as a scoff escaped his lips while heading towards the door but not without Monica getting her last word,
He let her cry as he weakly hugged her, lightly shushing her to calm her down a little. "I-i lost the kid Pepper... i-i lost him," Tony said as if he was out of breath, the two stayed there hugging, Steve watching as the others went over to greet him, Bruce immediately pushing- well not pushing but urging Tony inside, Pepper being his support to get medical treatment- but when Tony looked up- his eyes locked with those gorgeous sea blue eyes- fuck he was falling in love all over again.
"Look- we really should go... now," she turned her attention back to Tony, her eyes presented with worry but her voice stern.
Steve pulled back to rid of his and Tony's boxers, humming lightly as he held 3 fingers to the mouth of the other with a concerned look.
Tony hadn’t noticed, his attention fully on his son as he bit his lip harshly as Peter started again with more questions but Tony cut him off saying. "I’ll explain back in your room okay?" Peter huffed but he agreed as the two walked back to the room. He settled Peter in before he pulled up a chair, sitting in it backward of course as he pulled out his phone. He was gonna come clean to his son- he knew he was gonna be angry but he couldn’t stand the guilt anymore. He first pulled up pictures of captain America and slowly started explaining who Steve was, how he became who he was before the Avengers were formed. Of course, he didn’t mention his past abuse with his dad and why he was so terrified of being around the super soldier in the beginning. He went into the team, how Steve would always make sure he would eat, sit in the corner of his lab as he drew before they started conversations up before Steve had the balls to ask the philanthropist on a date.
I felt like years passed but really it was hours as they rushed to save the man after being notified there was still life left in him. Time passed as they all waited in the waiting room, anxiously, no news or updates no matter how many times they asked. Until finally the surgery light turned off and they wheeled him out now, one arm gone. The doctors informed the team that whatever he did to that arm damaged all nerves and cells that couldn't be saved and had to replace skin on his face and neck with skin grafts.
Steve looks down and away for a moment. "We used to be close... Now, I'm pretty sure he hates me..." He says softly and sighs sadly.
Tony was chasing around their little four-year-old toddler Peter, almost running out of breath himself, Jesus why do toddlers have so much energy- but that little bug was running around naked because he didn't want to get dressed in his onesie after taking his nightly bath so he ran off.
"I know, we have to teach him how to control it sometime as well- this isn't the first time something like this has happened you know," Steve said sadly as he pulls into the garage and parked in the spot they came out of, he turned off the car and grabbed the leftovers as he got out of the car.
Tony took a deep breath trying not to let out his frustrations. "Peter," He said his name with a stern voice. "Go to the timeout corner,"
"I-I..," Bruce started motioning towards the girl. "I... I can't- I can't, Tony," Before Tony can even open up his mouth, the quiet one had cut him off.
"SS-Steve... i y-yeah.. i-i- trust you... i-i do mostly," Tony broke the silence, his voice still a little hoarse, his other hand lightly touching the man's hand, eyes softly closing taking in a breath slowly, his knuckles tensing slightly, Steve always watched every single move he took in case he starts up a panic attack. There was a silent pause before Tony initiated another passionate lust-filled kiss, that lasted what felt like forever.
His cheeks flushed as he looked at Steve. "R-really?" He croaked. "After everything i-i put you through?"
Tony's lips curved into a smile as he turned to his son. "Papa's coming home early! I just got a message,"
Tony took a deep breath as he leaned back most likely after turning on his helmet message recording.
The party went on, Tony leaned on Steve's shoulder, hed noticed how close Peter and another boy his age a little taller, an hour later the party ended and everyone either went to their rooms or went home.
Steve smiles and looks down at the envelope. "I didn't know that." He looks up at Peter and smiles. "I bet you he still will." He says softly.
Tony smiled at him getting up to help Peter with the zipper on the back while adjusting the costume where it needed. "I think he'll enjoy this alot, you two could be twins," he teased his son earning a giggle coming from him as he went back int his closet grabbing his toy shield in one hand and the other hand was foam Mjolnir turning to his father with a bright smile on his face as he knocked the hammer on the plastic.
The portals open and the army of everyone marches in. Steve readies himself and looks over at Tony. He then looks forward and yells. "Avengers! Assemble." He then runs with their team behind them.
"Okay- well when I was captured, Monica and Tarleton had this argument- Tarleton had to leave the room," Kamala set down the tablet. "Then Monica pulled up the coordinates to this satellite called "Ambrosia","
"And I needed you," Tony interrupted him with a glare tilting his head at him. "As in past tense that Trumps, what you need is too late honey," he cleared his throat. "Sorry,"
Peter nodded slowly it felt better to hear both sides, now he kind of started to panic realizing that steve didn’t live in the compound and his dad was gonna make him go back to the compound and immediately hugged him hiding his face. "D-don’t want you to go- i don’t want you to disappear-,
"Where's the lube?" the blonde muttered pulling back to starts nipping at Tony's tan skin, running his hands up and down his body.
"Or we could immediately screw up, sadly high hopes won’t help us this time to safety execute said time heist, i believe our like outcome would be our likely demise,"
"I should have stayed in hiding," he croaked, taking a moment before turning around in his computer chair. "I should have listened to the others, now here we are, the world is doomed,"
Steve smiles softly and holds Tony close to him. "I love you, Tony... I will always love you even if you don't  want me..."
“He’s a little calm… just really shaken up,” he replied, running his fingers through whispering soothing words into the toddler’s ear including their love and support.
He laughs cutely. "I'm not surprised that you have videos." He happily curls up with Tony and watches them.
"They helped me get out of Jersey," the girl responded, anxiety already laced her voice. "I wouldn't be here if they hadn't warned me about AIM,"
"I don't know bug, I really don't," he said honestly, he didn't know the reason why it was like he and Steve switched roles, he used to always be in the basement working on new projects but he stopped to spend more and more time with their son.
Steve nods and smiles softly, sad that Tony has to go through these things but at the same time, he's not dead.
After about 5 minutes, Tony finally got up and kneeled down to his height, continuing his stern tone. "Do you know why I put you in timeout?" He seemed to be ignoring him, still facing the wall hadn't moved in a while, so he raised his voice a little. "Peter Benjamin Stark-Rogers, I asked you a question. Do I need to add another 5 minutes?"
Steve chuckles nervously and looks down slightly. 'Did he mean that or is he joking?' he thinks to himself
Not even too long after Bruce left the room the alarms went off, JARVIS in the intercoms informed the team of the AIM forces heading towards the Chimera, and that put the team to fight mode, they were most likely here for Tarleton's sidekick anyways. They split up, Bruce, Clint, would go outside on the dropship to the quinjet while Tony and Kamala would protect the insides.
Morgan skipped over holding out the juice pop. Tony smiled wiping his tears as he takes it. "Thank you, princess," he kissed her forehead and opened it biting at it, and offered steve some.
Steve chuckles and brings the glass up to his lips. "I'm doing a lot better than yesterday, that's for sure."
Peter’s head had snapped up at his voice- his eyes were filled with confusion- his emotions were so all over the place he couldn’t handle it. Should he smile? Should he cry? Be angry with either of his dads? He ended up just starting to cry frustratedly, Steve immediately rushing over to his side- but he hesitated.
Steve walks over to Peter and places a hand on his shoulder. "Hey, Queens." He uses the kid’s nickname and smiles softly. "You alright there kid?"
He shook his head sniffling. "W-what Thanos has done can't be undone- l-lets not take about him now okay?"
"Well, he's pissed," everyone's attention turned to the rodent, Rocket, who was sitting next to Nebula. "He thinks he failed- which of course he did but there's a lot of that going around ain't there,"
"Damn he's asleep," The super soldier spoke with a little chuckle, but sweetly. "Maybe you should go ahead and take him to bed,"
Steve kisses Morgan's head. "Why don't we let the adults talk, okay princess? Wanna watch your cartoons before lunch?"
Steve nodded with a soft sigh taking the folder from her and leaned against the counter, as he opened the folder pulling out its content one by one, carefully skimming through the boy’s information.
Is he just acting as if nothing happened almost 16 years ago? He flinched when he felt his strong hand placed on his shoulder, immediately harshly pushing it off as he pushed himself to his feet immediately scurrying off  If Steve hadn’t left him to die all those years maybe he would have taken him in with open arms, welcoming him back into his life. He muttered something under his breath hugging himself as he retreated to his room, he’d be back when his son was out of surgery, he didn’t even bother to listen to what Steve had to say. Quickly muttering lowly to EDITH to notify the surgeons to not let Rogers know about Peter knowing Natasha was probably with Steve that probably wouldn’t last.
The Terrigin, the element that the Avengers had created and showed at Avengers Day, shouldn't have been released to the public. And because of that, it caused damage on an unprecedented scale to San Francisco. Thousands of people died while many more bear the scars of what had become known as A Day, hundreds fell sick, encased in strange cocoons only to emerge with dangerous, otherworldly powers. With no known cure, it has spread across the country
"I could imagine, I mean if I had a random web-shoot at my face while I was eating ice cream, I'd be pretty scared too,"
He had Peter months later, 35 weeks, prematurely but he was perfect in his eyes. He grew up in the compound with the Avengers that were left, especially Natasha before she joined Steve sometime later then it was Rhodey and when T'challa visited from Wakanda, always brought small gifts, he loved playing with both of them, he'd call anyone who wasn't his dad in the compound his aunt or uncle. He spent a lot of his time in Tony's lab and being a normal kid, growing up never asking who his other dad was.
"Y-you're not playing with me right now.. right?" He bit his lip a little shaky. "This isn't- some prank you're playing on me- say sik-,"
Tony smiled at the boy’s costume, cooing as he bent down to his level. “Did you design this yourself, Pete?” While Peter was talking to Tony, Steve had gone off to change. Peter nodded quickly. “Uh-huh! I’m Village Boy! See?” He said pointing to the big V on his chest that was just really just some pajamas with a piece of paper with a V taped on his chest. Completing his little outfit with a red cape and black mask on. “I made it myself!”
He flinched a little as Steve rose his voice a little and looked back down still leaned against the wall. "I tried to do what i believed what waa right but i was wrong," he said a little low voicer
They weren't expecting this one bit, definitely not the events that happened after. Bruce had volunteered to question his ex-girlfriend no matter what- he seemed to be the only one who would talk to her while the rest of the team watched from a screen.
"There are no accidents though," Bruce responded, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his tan khakis.
'Oh god oH god-,' Tony cursed mentally as he panicked as Friday was grabbing a drone that Tony had created for these occasions that had a hand grabber to grab Peter from the ceiling or wall so Tony didn't have to call for one of his suits in the basement, that should probably scare the little one. Tony made sure Friday turned off the fan before he turned on the drone and made sure that Peter wouldn't just drop- he's done that a lot.
Tony with Pepper by his side fought with his suits and Rhodes too. He eventually reunited with Peter, he embraced him before sending him off. They tried to get the gauntlet to the van but it was destroyed. So Tony went for the discarded gauntlet after looking at Strange and he put up one finger. One in 14 million that they win. He dashed towards it fighting for it with Thanos, Carol got knocked out. Thanos put on the gauntlet "i am inevitable," he snapped, nothing. Tony had taken the stones as they attached to his armor hand, the powers running through his veins already burning him.
Tony, of course, noticed the scratched and lightly sighed. “Hey Petes, can you go get changed for papa? We’ll go for McDonald’s in a few minutes okay?” Watching his son nod before dashing off upstairs to get changed.
"Maybe I could help, I'm pretty good with technology I've worked with tanks ad stuff since you retired," Steve moved his hand down over to Tony's scarred up cheek from his final battle.
probably the shortest chapter but hey this fic in my google docs its almost 20,000 words, my longest fic yet which is surprising lol. hopefully by the end of this week this fic will be finished.
Stark sighed as Peter squirmed and hit him as he took him from the drone before sitting down on the couch just keeping the kids in his arms, he was tired and frustrated, just wondering how Steve kept him calm and in place when he was around, and he wouldn't let go and it wasn't long before Peter gave up, pouting in his dad's arms.
Mouths clashing together, lips sliding into place when they met like it was meant to be, Steve's tongue sliding into home, exploring around the wet cavern while his hand slides up the brunette's leg up into his shirt his fingers ghosting over his sensitive nipples, he knew how he was when he messed with his buds, pushing his hips more against Tony's, love to hear his little whines and moans.
"Don't feel bad about this okay?- I'm mean, actually if you grovel about this for a couple of weeks... and then move on with enormous guilt,"
After Tony spoke the three famous lines the enemies started dusting away. But it came with the consequence that happened to Bruce. His arm of the gauntlet was burned badly under his armor, one side of his face was the same as he weakly laid against the rocks as he watched the enemies go. He did it, fuck he did it
It wasn't long before Steve came as well, biting onto Tony's shoulder as he stilled against his ass, filling him up with his load. They didn't even want to move from their position when if it was tiring. Steves was pressing kisses where he left marks on his collarbone while Tony was just gently rubbing Steve's arms with his hands whispering soft "I love you's" until they went and cleaned up, taking a warm bubble bath together in their shared bathroom, just enjoying the other presences.
When Zemo played the video, the surveillance video of a recognized street- he knew it, the same street he recognized, the same street where the said car crash of his parents happened.
He heard the brunette whine when he so suddenly pulled out all fingers at once, leaving him empty. Steve spit into the hand that he used his fingers to prep, twice, using this as a not so less painful way lube, he knew how weak Tony was and didn't want him to do any work. He groaned softly as he spreads the spit over his length before adjusting Tony's hips as he eased himself into him, trying his hardest not to flick his hips up right away, trying to take his time showing him how much he cared for the man on his lap.
"Peter come on, be nice to dad and come down please- I'm begging you Bug," Tony begged as he pushed strands of his sweaty brunette hair away, putting his hands out to catch him if he decided 'i'll be a good boy and listen to daddy,' He grimaced a little as he watched Peter stick out his little toddler tongue continuing his little game on the ceiling
Peter thought for a moment as he looked away as he asked again. “Am I famous? Do people know about me?” He asked before he looked up to his dad.
Steve frowns when Tony starts to get upset about Peter. He kisses his forehead before suddenly smiling at Morgan. He looks over at his friends and nods. "Please stay for lunch guys," Steve says happily as the two nodded they were starving.
“Thank you,” Steve nods at her while he goes back to work on the room, waiting to hear back from the assassin. It took a while but eventually, she came back with a small folder in hand.
He didn't even bother to listen to his AI telling him that Steve just left the home for the night and continued his work while drinking and snacking on his chips.
With one arm holding his son, he removed the web and continued walking before plopping his son down on the chair. "If you move, I will take away your toys and we will not go to the park for a long time, do you understand?" He gave him a look and honestly he was just so tired and grouchy. But the toddler didn't even reply and just crossed his arms while huffing. He just sat there pouting with a glare towards his dad, so he just walked away sitting down on the couch with his head in his hands, massaging his temples.
"Yeah I would," Peter replied, slouching down in the stool he was in. "You're mean, I don't like you," He was saying purely out of anger.
"Honestly at the exact second," Tony pointed a soft finger at the raccoon he's never met before or seen. " I thought you were a build a bear,"
"You rea- oh fuck," he moaned softly, wrapping an arm around his neck, tilting his head. "Fuck babe-there- lubes probably e-expired o-or destroyed."
Tony jumped a little blushing setting the picture down that he was holding where it sat before. "Hey you Dorito," he joked lightly
15 years later, years after the civil war, years later after Siberia where he thought his unborn kid was dead by the time he was found. When he opened his eyes again, he could see bright lights, people yelling around him before it went black again
Morgan giggled as Tony let her take a bit as well before turning to Peter gesturing him to come over. Tony took the papers with his good hand laying them on his lap. Using his one hand he signed the papers, struggling a little since it was his left but he did it with a light shake in his hand.
Tony was getting drowsy by the second, he felt Steve pull out and pull himself into his strong super soldier arms as he let himself slip into the darkness of sleep.
He immediately nodded leaning up to wrap his arms around his newfound other father that he asked about for years- stuffing his face into his shirt as he brought him into a tight hug, feeling his fathers arms wrap around him, hand rubbing up and down his back, consoling him as he whispered reassuring words letting him cry it all out.
Tony turned around and saw the young version of his abusive father. He took a deep breath thanking him and tried walking off but the man stopped him.
"I have broken the encryption, so there is more to see," JARVIS responded as he pulled a holographic screen and the footage starts to play. The room was filled with a blue gas, the ship's walls were shaking, sparks flying around everywhere as the alarm and warnings of the reactor malfunctioning bounced off the wall.
Steve glanced in the rearview mirror at his husband, sending him a bit of a glare. “You told him about the basement?”
Peter stayed cuddled up to his father, loving the attention even though he wished he had both of his dads both here with him. The two seemed to relax before Tony's phone went off with the message appearing up on the front screen saying as he checked who could it be.
Steve frowns and runs after Tony. "Tony! Wait!" He yells. Tony had looked up shaking his head trying to speed up his walking muttering about wanting to be alone.
“No I haven’t,” Tony spoke truthfully, he didn’t want Peter to know about the bad of the world so he never mentioned what Steve truly did.
Steve smiles at the surgeon and nods. "Thank you..." He whispers before looking down at his son with tears in his eyes. All he could do was blame himself. If only he signed those damn accords he wouldn’t have missed the last 15 years of Peter's life... He would've been able to stop Peter from getting hurt... All he could imagine at this sight was Tony laying on the ground, bloodied and beaten from their previous fight over Bucky and those damn accords. He sniffles and holds himself together as he says something to his sleeping son. "Peter... I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you... I-I didn't even know about you but... I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you or Dad... I wish I could do something to make up for it... I-I just want to be your dad... Your other dad... I'm so sorry Peter..."
Tony raised an eyebrow looking at Natasha and Lang confused. "I’m scared to ask but what’s going on?"
Silence came over the group after Bruce and Pepper carried Tony back to the medical wing leaving Nat, Rhodes, Nebula, Carol, and Rocket, along with Steve himself who had to take a seat after the events, putting his face in his hands.
It was Tony who came first, from Steve pegging onto his prostate, him leaning down to kiss him passionately, whispering soft romantic things into his ear, telling him how good he was for Steve, that brought him to the edge, cumming all over the medical wings bedsheets, throwing his head back, trying to recapture Steve's lips once again moaning as Steve groaned from yim clenching around his cock feeling him fasten his thrusts as he feels hin cum inside pressing right on hid prostate.
Peter was giggling as he ran around the house without any clothes. He ended up climbing up the wall of the living room making his way up to the ceiling with his sticky webby hands and feet where he stayed on all fours out of Tony's reach, laughing as he watched his father struggle.
Tony turned his head lifting him not hurt arm his voice was hoarse it sounded so scratchy. "S-steve?" He croaked- was it just him or did someone take most of the oxygen-
Tony sets morgan down and heads to the kitchen greeting pepper in the living room that was scattered with barbies, he went to set the table
Snapping back to reality as he looked back into his son’s room, lightly knocking to make his presence. “Peter?” he called softly wiping his eyes first before stepping in. Peter was in his bed silently, he was fiddling with the necklace Tony was wearing- he realized they were their engagement rings- it made his heart clench- he kept them.
He grunted from the impact, keeping his eyes away as he tried pushing Steve off of him. "Get off me, Rogers," he grumbled ignoring his question refusing to look at his eyes
"Today's day? 21? No, wait- 22. You know if it wasn't for the existential terror of steering into the literal void of space- I'd say I'm feeling a little better today." Tony let out a small chuckle before coughing slightly and continued. "The infections run through its course thanks to the blue meanie back there- oh you would love her," He said referring to Nebula who helped them fight on Titan. "Very practical, only a tiny bit sadistic,"
He chuckled and got up, picking him up starting to spin him around, with Peter holding onto him tightly, excitedly shouting. "Faster, Faster!"
"And that's, why we need, need to make it a "quick" shower 'captain'," he gave him a look, poking his chest with his finger, laughing softly at Steve's eye roll letting him hop into the shower first- after he checked the shower temperature, gesturing for his husband to join in. As the water hit Steve's skin, dirt seemed as if it melted off his skin going down into the drain. When Tony stepped into the shower, he immediately flinched at the hotness, cursing under his breath.
He moves closer and gently takes his hands. "Tony... Do you really think I would've called you pathetic? All I've ever wanted in my adult life was to have a family with the man I love..." He says softly. "There's nothing I wouldn't do to have my family..." He sighs softly and smiles faintly. "I love you, Tony Stark. I always have and always will."
Tony just layed there enjoying the touch of his husband, tears escaping his eyes though pulling him closer with his only arm
"You're right," He hummed, with his other hand he ran his fingers through their fast asleep toddler's hair. "What do you say I have the person who made my suit, make him a costume for his birthday and maybe have an expanding suit in cloth form?"
He hummed slightly as Steve finally kissed him fully again, cupping one of his cheeks ad they stayed in that intimate position as if it were their last time they'd get to spend with each other kissing, holding each other, just getting to love each other.
Tony could see her smile through the reflection of the computer screen, it made his heart warm up as he tried to push the negative thoughts aside as memories from the past itched their way into his thoughts. He did his best to push it away, starting to type frustratedly, almost jumping in his seat when a chat message pulled up on the screen, making him raise an eyebrow in confusion.
What felt like hours later, Tony was peacefully still getting his rest but he slowly came back to reality trying to block out this new bright light out of his face as he opened his eyes surprised to see this.. woman.. she was surrounded by fire and just floating there, he's definitely never seen her around either.
Tony rolled his eyes, lips curved into a smile as he never to Peter, unzipping the Captain America outfit. "Go get into some pajamas and get any stuffies you want and come back, okay?" Peter got up at this and immediately headed off to his nearby room giggly.
It wasn't long before TaskMaster, one of their recurring nemesis mostly Nat's due to her past trauma as a Russian spy, released sonic bombs onto the bridge while Tony, Thor, and Bruce were fighting off the swarms of robots and keeping the bridge stable while Nat and Clint headed off for the Taskmaster. Thor called down Thunder from the sky as he bashed any enemies blasting at him, Hulk smashing whatever was in his path including the tanks and cars parked on the gravel road, while Tony was air support using his rockets and repulsors taking out any of flight or the turners. They tried to save the day like they always did, it was going well as they were taking them down easily, bringing the stranded citizens to safety, getting the detonator from Taskmaster after Nat had pinned him down and knocked him out with a singular hard punch as Clint used the remote that stopped the bombs from going off. After regrouping, they failed to realize how silent their leader was on their comms. When they looked back at the ship, it was in the air, a blue light beam under it. The city was collapsing, the realization that they had been played sunk in.
"Well, when ya know- thought you were dead," he lightly shrugged, wrapping his arms around him. "Tried to polish the things I had of you and cherish them,"
Having his repulsors up and ready to fire as he stood back and watched these panels open from this pod it looked like- he felt bad for whatever poor inhuman had been trapped there for this long. But whatever this was, it was going to put a stop to Monica's plans- to Tarleton's plans- to stop AIM at once.
He looks over at Tony with tears in his eyes. "I'm not playing a prank on you, Tony." He whispers. "I would never do something so cruel..." He whispers and bends down and gently kissed his lips quickly.
Tony let out a sigh of relief as he kissed the top of his head softly. "You and Pops are going to have a nice little talk tonight Pete," he whispered because he hated yelling- only if he had to- besides he was too close to breaking his eardrum.
He walked over to his son, picking him up in his arms bouncing him on his way to the living room. "My little strong Captain America,"
“I will don’t worry,” Tony chuckled as he pulled Peter upon his shoulder so he could be seen as they went up to the counter to order.
He heard Morgan going ew but he smiled into the kiss pulling away looking at Morgan. "You won’t do that till you’re older-,"
He slowly nodded. "Probably.. she knew i wanted to be the one to tell you one day- when i was ready... i guess i was never ready to face you again-,"
Steve stopped talking for a moment but before Tony could leave he said something else. "You know what would've made me sign the accords?" He asks, then pauses. "You and my son. If I would've known that if I didn't sign, I wouldn't see my son grow up with my loving husband by my side. You clearly had that idea- That if I didn't sign you would take him and not tell him about me... Not let me see him..." He says softly and walks away toward Peter's room and gently knocks on his door, hoping he'd be able to see his son.
Steve nods and smiles. "We really did. We got Peter back and everyone else. Morgan is safe too. She's with Happy." He whispers. "Everything is okay now."
He kisses her forehead again. "Daddy is going to be okay." He thinks of a way to tell her that his arm got burned. "Daddy's arm got hurt really bad and the doctors had to cut his arm off to save daddy. Daddy will be okay though."
"I always tell you if i discover something," he laughed softly pulling the male close by his legs and played with his hair softly
"No can do, I have another call in- Fury wants me back in before midnight and I'd barely get a nap in," he replied honestly.
"Why don't you ever work daddy?" Peter curiously looked up at his dad as he sat down, Peter in his lap.
His eyes lit up as he plopped on the couch and ripped into it and gasped happily as he saw the frame setting it down to hug his pops again starting with his thank-yous with a smile. Tony was just watching with a soft smile- fuck he was guilty of keeping steve out of his life but seeing peter happier with his other dad it made his heartbeat
Stepping back inside to grab his cup of coffee, he took a look around sinking in what his life became. In just one day, he lost everything- his friends, all his work, and the love of his life because of his mistake. Maybe he was listening to the media too much but maybe it was true.
"Okay no no no," he ignored Rhodes telling him to sit down as he pointed towards Carol. "We need you, your new blood,"
Nat shrugged. "He can be a mother hen but I'm sure we can just be a little sneaky, he is a human who needs sleep,"
His eyes widen a little surprised, raising a hand- no not to slap him- but instead resting on the back of his neck, the hand with his old ring.
"He kind of has an idea of what he can do but then again he was having a brain freeze that usually he doesn't experience at all," Tony frowned pressing a kiss to the side of Peter's head, his fingers running through his mop of hair.
Steve couldn't take it anymore and fast-walked over to Tony almost sprinting as he embraced him, tears already building up in his eyes, the brunette's arms wrapping around him as they just enjoyed the presence of each other, leaving the past behind them at that moment.
“Will I be famous when I grow up? Will people know you’re my parents when I go to school? Am I going to school?” Peter had started to ramble, all of this seeming really confusing to the 4-year-old.
Tony hummed as he looked down at his son as he asked him. “You wanna order for yourself or want our help?”
He took the plates away and set them y the sink, reminding himself mentally to do dishes later before picking up Peter. "I know you're bummed out but hey, I'm still here," he said with a smile as he took him to the kid's bedroom.
Peter looked up at his dad before looking back at the menu, mostly using the pictures to decide what he wanted then looked back at him after deciding what he wanted, he nodded. “I’ll do it myself, I’m a big boy!” he excitedly spoke.
Steve nodded and slowly made his way into the room where his ex once stood by, entering with his keycard. He really disliked snooping don't get him wrong but he just wanted to help Tony in any way, shape, or form, even if they hate Tony for him was still big.
“Mhm! We played with toys and dad chased me around while I crawled up the wall!” He replied with a huge grin on his face.
Steve nods and kisses Morgan's cheek and then pecks Tony's lips. "Mmm, I wouldn't miss it for the world." He smiles and turns back to Morgan. "Can I get a big hug before I leave?" He asks cutely to his little girl.
Tony groaned as the building collapsed on top of the two and everyone else was everywhere under the building pieces.
The interrogation continued, Tony guessed he was finally getting his pent of feelings out by asking his personal questions- Bruce probably felt used in their relationship- he felt... pity towards his science bro.
Steve got away and smiles once he gets to their meeting point and sees Peggy standing there. He was happy to see her once more. Especially since she’s young and happy and is doing what she loved.
Tony sat on the other side of peter and took steves hand of course behind Peters's head as he starts the movie with a soft smile
"What is this?" He asked, turning around in his chair to face both of the people in his RV. "Who is- Who is Tiny Dancer?"
He winced at every piece of metal he had to pull again, the metal of Steve's shield was jabbed so far into his chest he could feel his own blood dripping from around it. When he finally got a look at his stomach, he almost started crying as he turned onto his back, the bruising he saw, he knew one of them wasn’t gonna make it out alive.
"Okay... so what if we turn the spare room in the basement into a sort of jungle-themed room with places to jump and hand and crawl- Then we can help him learn his powers easier,"
Steve chuckles and smiles softly. "Thwip." She laughs softly. "That's adorable." He then sighs. "I'm glad Nat was around. I know she's always loved, children. She's always been pretty good with them."
"Papa would be grumpy pants," Peter said before he decided to run to his costume chest pulling out his toy captain America helmet before sliding it on his head and turning to his dad, deciding to play a little and mock what he's seen his other dad do a lot when he's home. "I've worked too much, I'm too tired, Do it yourself Tony," He said in a grumpier and deeper voice but started giggling after. Tony made himself laugh instead of a sigh, he didn't want Peter to know how lonely and sad he was without his husband around. "Ah my silly little Pete," he said as he picked up the boy and spun him around, Peter clinging to him after he was brought down from above. Even if he gave his dad a hard time, he did love him a lot, he loved his dads equally.
Before he could make a fuss about being so close, Steve had pulled out only to bring him up on his knees against his chest, entering him once again and started rocking into him, hard. "You gonna cum for me doll?" Steve asked, mouthing at his neck, slinking a hand down around him, starting to stroke his own cock fast
"We don't know," Steve stood a few feet away arms crossed. "He just opened a portal and walked through,"
"We're trying to take senescence- and it looks like he did what he said he was going to do... Thanos wiped out 50% of the population of the world,"
"Hey, baby... It's me." He whispers and kisses his forehead again. "I've got you." He whispers. "We did it baby."
A two and a half weeks had passed, It was slowly back to normal, mostly getting the situation under control, they had memorial stones for everyone who disappeared built in the center of new york. Steve started a little support group for the people suffering especially himself who didn't know how to grieve at the loss of his love and somewhat adopted a son. The three last avengers had recruited some new workers to help them out remake what was left of the new SHIELD with Natasha in charge of everything.
He did this for a while, listening to the younger fail to hold back his moans, he was moaning into Steve's neck holding onto his shoulders pressing his hips back onto Steves pelvis that was slowly speeding up but not too fast still wanting to take his time with him, putting his love fully into this, loving the way Tony would try to be quiet back then he'd let the whole tower know how much he was loving it, the next morning he'd say the hickeys were mosquito bites and when Steve walked in, Nat would always call him Daddy Mosquito.
"Steve," he looked at him half pleading and half-serious. "They’re not going to let you be on the same team if you- I’m trying to do the right thing here-,"
Tony finished up in the kitchen and living room before just grabbing a glass of scotch and perched himself on a stool, sipping on it
"Oh, 3000?" He smiles. "That's a lot." He kisses her forehead. "You know what? I love you 3000." He smiles and slowly gets up. "Goodnight princess."
Steve got up to walk after him but didn't enter the medical room Tony was in. He couldn't get himself to go in there. He just stood outside, looking into the glass room where his lover laid asleep and pale and sick. He unconsciously hung his head, upset with himself about how he left his lover. God... why did he even think leaving Tony was a good idea?
Steve chuckled lightly pulling his hips up so his lower body was slanted up. He spits into his hand stroking his cock as he slicks himself up, getting behind him. "This position okay doll? We can switch it up if you want mm?" he asked as he slides in, moaning at the warmth around him.
He looks down at his hands. "I can't-I just can't Tony..." He sighs. "Something tells me that this isn't right..."
He nods again with a sigh. "Yeah... I wish I could've done it differently.. pregnant or not- even before- I wish I would've done all this differently,"
Steve sighed but he did as he was told and fast-walked towards the room and when he arrived, Natasha and Bruce were at the hologram table- there was Tony- not in person but a hologram of some sort.
He moves both hands to steves cheeks, stroking his cheeks feeling the freshly shaven cheeks. "I-i'm sorry i didn't call-,"
Steve looked back at Tony, trying his best to think on the spot. “Uh… well… you see…,” he started, but he had no idea where to go with it. “When the stork… brought you to us… um… you just had powers?” He tried, praying that there weren’t any questions asked. But, Peter thought about it, seeming like he wouldn’t believe it before just shrugging. “Makes sense,” his son’s response getting a chuckle out from his dad as McDonald’s was pulling up close.
