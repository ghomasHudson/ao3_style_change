“I’ve had a vision,” Thor proclaims, somehow, even if his voice is at a normal volume. “A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life, and at it’s center is that.”
*That little blooper wasn't actually mine. It was from Matt Fraction's fabulous Hawkeye comics, and the page that it appeared on can be found at the link I attached in the story.
Ultron speeds forwards, arms outstretched, and I turn quickly, letting his arms close around my midriff. His momentum and my lack of resistance send us both backwards.
“No, I’m good,” Clint assures the other. “If you wanna get some kip, nods a good time, ‘cause we’re still a few hours out.”
“Hey, just thought everyone should know that I’m on the roof of a 60-story office building on 42nd because I think I might need to jump off of it in a few seconds.”
But he still has full use of his upper torso, and he ducks under my first attack, wrenching his feet from the ground as he does. I yank the whip back, cracking it again to deactivate it before stowing it inside my jacket, where there’s a special pocket for the whip.
“We can’t go anywhere,” I mumble under my breath. Releasing the slack body of the mercenary, I vault over the side and make a beeline for the catwalks opposite, hidden under a ledge that Clint might not be able to get without some wicked rebound shots. Bullets ping off of metal behind me. “Every time. Every single fucking time.”
“Swing up Park, I’m gonna lay them out for you,” I hear Tony say. I grin, taking off into the air and use another gun to fire a single shot at a passing Chitauri. The others growl as their comrade tumbles out of the air, spinning to face me. I don’t waste time, just turn tail and head towards Central Park with a little parade of aliens on my tail.
I hiss out a curse. “Stark’s on the other side of the damn world, how are we getting there in time to stop him?”
A pull on the other end nearly has me tumbling through the air back towards the control panel, but I manage to reverse my flight pattern and remain at a safe distance. The Soldier grits his teeth, putting more of his weight into pulling me back. I resist as much as I can, leaning back myself and pulling as hard as I can. And when the cord is taught and creaking dangerously, I let go.
"You know who killed him, don't you?" she asks as the call goes through. My posture immediately tightens, and I cross my arms.
“You! A TV anchor in Cairo, the Under Secretary of Defense, a high school Valedictorian in Iowa City, Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who’s a threat to Hydra! Now, or in the future.”
Steve stands at the center of the Quinjet, hands braced on the low cross between a table and crates, looking expectant. Slowly, everyone begins to drift towards him, and once I join the group the supersoldier straightens up.
Swearing ferociously, I risk a glance around the hood of the car that I've taken shelter behind and nearly get a nasty black eye from a laser heading my way. As it was, it still manages to clip the side of my face, and I spit out a string of curses, left eye clenched in pain. At least the laser doesn't burn me. I'd probably have to become a female, Spanish version of Fury if that happened.
The only thing any of us can do is watch, Tony’s neck craning from his position on the floor, Steve shielding his eyes from the bright glare of the lightning, even me, say astride Tony’s chest, awkward as this position is now that we’re no longer fighting.
“Not a great plan,” I deadpan. “Did I mention the guy with anger issues? I did, right?” Tony smirks minutely as he walks out from behind the bar, scotch held in one hand.
Lucky, a golden retriever Clint decided to adopt after the dog saved his own stupid ass, lives there now that Clint and I are staying over in the Tower a bit too much to keep asking Kate to take care of him.
“Auntie Cam!” she squeals, disengaging from Nat and throwing herself at me. I catch her midair easily, holding her up with a grin.
Steve sprints past the two of us, heading for the hole in the train car put there by Ultron’s last attack. I follow quickly, flying to avoid the glowing, smoking edges of each hole. It’s faster than I normally fly, but now that my feet aren’t on the ground I don’t have the privilege of being pulled along because physics.
“Вы,” I murmur in reply. The leather of the whip handle cracks under my grip. Neither of us move for a second.
Tony produces an unnecessarily large amount of alcohol, the kitchen counters are laden with both empty and half-eaten takeout boxes and someone has pulled up
“Get in,” the director says shortly. “We’ve caught Loki.” I swear, snatching my duffel bag from its place at my side and hurrying after the dark-skinned man, tablet tucked under one arm. My bare skin is covered by a jacket, even if it’s nearly summer.
Fury shakes his head, moving over to a spot on the counter that has a loaf of bread and a knife. “Now that the gang’s all here, we can get to the real dirt,” he says, cutting himself a slice. “Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he’s building something. The amount of vibranium he made off with, I don’t think it’s just one thing.”
“Barton told me about you,” Loki says, a grin creeping over his impish features. “But under a different name—Cam, if I’m not mistaken, better known as the Black Lynx? My, my, my, what I would do to get my hands on you…”
"Well, maybe it's not just about guns," Natasha reasons. Steve glances at my partner, just as more Chitauri speed by, dropping foot soldiers as they do.
"Stark, that's a one-way trip if you don't get out in time." There's no answer. Seconds stretch out, and I struggle to stay in the air. I manage to make it to the roof of an office building. Breathing is painful, and I'm praying that that broken rib didn't puncture a lung. The left side of my face is killing me as-is, and I shove my goggles up with a quiet yelp of pain.
Wind whips my ponytail around, and I angle myself up, spinning as fast as i can before stopping abruptly and letting my whip arc through the air, entangling an alien speeder. Pulling hard, I yank the speeder towards me and kick it back with as much force as I can muster. It spins like a top, crashing into a nearby building and exploding into flames.
I hear him do as commanded, and a couple agents that I recognize from STRIKE walk by me. I breathe a sigh of relief, turning back to rejoin the crowd, making a beeline for a Barnes & Noble. I'm not paying attention to Nat or Steve right now, but I do spot Clint moving away from another pair of STRIKE agents.
“So what’d they say?” Clint asks, in the kitchen now and examining one of the darts Tony had been throwing.
“Worth it,” I mutter under my breath as the ex-Russian superspy sits down gracefully. She sends me a glare, but before she can reply, Clint shoots bolt upright in bed. Both of us jump, focus tuned intently on our partner as he shakes his head violently, as if trying to get water out of his ears, arms straining to break the restraints on his wrists. I stand quickly, grabbing his hearing aids off of the side table.
I seek out Clint instead of a blade, because I know Natasha will be with him, berating him for not paying attention or just sitting quietly at his side.
He’s dragged into the Tower, uniform still smoldering, with third-degree burns on his right arm and laser-induced injuries all over his torso.
A jet lands barely four meters in front of me, in all its mysterious, intimidating glory. Through the clear glass that makes up the cockpit, I can see a familiar head of bright red hair and another of short brown strands. The ramp lowers in the back, and Nick Fury steps out of the jet, cool as a cucumber and looking at me with an edge in his eye that makes me tense.
Steve, Nat, Clint and I can only watch, half-terrified half-awestruck, as the rest of the massive being comes out of the portal in the sky. It's long, like a centipede, but has a turtle shell modified to conform to it's whale-like body that wriggling around like a fish. The teeth on it are probably taller than me, and holy shit, it's heading for the city.
“How could it not?” he counters. “The twenty-first century is a digital book. Zola taught Hydra how to read it. Back records, medical histories, voting patterns, emails, phone calls, your SAT scores. Zola’s algorithm evaluates peoples’ past to predict their future.”
"The world is ending,” I reply. “I wanted a normal life. And to do that, I have to do one last thing. After this, I’m in the wind.” Those words tear me apart to say, but it’s true. If I ever want the chance to remain semi-normal, then I have to distance myself from all of… Well, whatever you want to call this shitshow.
A pause, in whic everyone looks to Tony, whose braced his hands against a nearby table and hunched over a bit, and Bruce, standing at the billionaire’s side. And then Tony’s shoulders begin to shake as small, bitter chuckles leave his mouth. Bruce’s eyes widen, and he tries to shake his head subtly at Tony, but the genius takes no heed of the doctor’s warnings.
“Thor, Cam, you’re with Tony and me. Our job is to back him up, and if it comes down to a fight you three are going to be aerial support. Tony will be looking after Ultron, but I want you two to take out anything else up in the air that Clint doesn’t get.”
On the other hand, Wanda Maximoff is an easy fix. If her mind fuckery is linked to the sceptre, there’s a high likelihood her mojo won’t to jackshit to me. Still, might do me some good to stay away from her. What does intrigue me, however, is if I touched either of the Maximoffs, would their powers disappear? Or was it different, now that the energy from the sceptre was a part of them, not the weapon itself?
Unfortunately for me, Loki is a god with inhuman reflexes and he manages to dive out of the way. He comes up with a murderous expression, and I have to leap out of the way of the golden scepter that cleaves through the air with godly speed. Spinning to the side, I swing a leg out to knock Loki’s knees out from under him. He falls, but grasps my leg and pulls me forward.
The Soldier’s leg comes up and knocks the shield away, before slamming into Steve’s chest and sending him flying. The Captain tucks and rolls, landing with his shield held out in front of him. Clint looses the arrow just as the Soldier opens fire on the other blonde.
"Widow, Captain, get clear!" I yell, whirling around with my whip. Nat and Steve both oblige, and I bring my whip down into the pavement with both hands. Lightning lights up the ground a couple inches around the impct point, and a shockwave sends more flying backwards. Groaning, I straighten up and stretch. I'm going to be feeling that one tomorrow. Natasha jogs over and pats my back sympathetically, free hand holding her gun with a finger on the trigger.
“Does anyone have eyes on Hawkeye?” Steve asks. He grunts soon after, the sound of metal crumpling following.
It takes all seven of us Avengers twenty minutes to cart up every single box of physical files we have on Strucker and his time in Hydra. Thanks to SHIELD’s amazing forethought, none of the boxes are labelled, resulting in thirty minutes spent sorting the boxes into different piles. Only then can we focus on one particular category.
"So he's a ghost story," Steve says. It comes out a little more than a question than it was probably meant to. I straighten up a bit, and Clint's hand drops to his side.
“Yet you’re confused about why they didn’t want you around?” Rogers replies scathingly, ignoring the food. I rap on the table to get Stark’s attention, making grabby hands at the blueberries. The genius tosses the bag over, and I catch it effortlessly.
Nick Fury himself is a tall, African-American guy with a penchant for black trench coats. An eyepatch covers his left eye, making him appear even more mysterious than he already is, a tablet tucked under one arm. I’d learnt a long time ago to never mess with Fury. Doesn’t mean I don’t, but I’ve been diagnosed with authority issues.
"Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists," Natasha begins in a low voice. "The ones that do call him the Winter Soldier. He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last 50 years."
My feet kick uselessly at its torso, and my breath comes out in gasps. It takes effort to bring my wrist reapers up to slice the limb off of the alien.
“U-Gen,” Steve replies promptly, straightening. He’s back in Captain mode, face void of any emotion besides steely determination. “It used to be SHIELD-owned, so there should be something to get us back to New York.”
“This is a smokescreen,” Natasha says, brow furrowing. “Why send a message when you’ve just given a speech?”
“The kids are actual nightmares, I swear,” Clint’s prótegé complains. “No one should have that much energy at two in the morning.”
“Careful, wouldn’t want to upset the Captain’s delicate sensibilities,” I shoot back out of habit. Yeah. This is familiar, this banter. Everything’s going to be fine. Everything’s going to be fucking fine.
Bucky, as a concept, is abstract. There is nothing from my own experience that I can pin to that name.
They do almost nothing but scratch and chip the metal he’s made out of, but it does allow Steve to get in a hit with his shield.
“Person bodies,” Tony adds, frowning from his place leaned up against the doorway. “The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking. We’re outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.”
“Neither do we,” Tony sighs. He reaches out, switching off the monitor and standing up. I raise a curious eyebrow, to which the genius gestures to Clint at the controls. “Hey, you wanna switch out?” he offers.
White light is pulsing down the side of it, and as we watch, the whale-turtle-centipede-fish thing ejects more aliens. They're attached to it by harnesses, which snap once they're airborne and latch onto buildings. Even more are ejected, and now they're crashing through windows. I can hear the terrigied screams of tapped people on the buildings.
“We need to get a Doctor here. If we don’t put pressure on that wound, she’s gonna bleed out here in the truck.” The STRIKE agent he’s talking to raises their cattle prod menacingly, but Sam holds his ground, unflinching. A beat of silence. Then the agent lashes out to the side with the prod, jabbing their teammate in the stomach. They let out a cry of surprise as they crash to the floor.
“Where’s Nat?” I mutter. Clint’s head snaps towards me, hearing aids having been fine-tuned to pick up softer sounds if there’s not too much background noise.
“I think it’s about the mechanics,” Banner cuts in quickly. “Iridium, what did they need the iridium for?”
, and an arrow embeds itself in the road at the Soldier’s feet. For a split second it just sits there, quivering from the impact—and then it explodes, putty glueing the Soldier in place. I dart forwards, cracking my whip as I swing it around at the Soldier’s head.
"Ah, so it worked," the computer says. I gasp, one hand fisted against my forehead and one hand clutching at Steve's rock-hard bicep to keep me upright. My eyes are watering with pain, and my entire body aches.
"Yeah, bet you look terrible in them now," Steve replies, deadpan. Clint and I exchange looks, because the Odessa story wasn't one Natasha shared often. It was one of few failures that I could count on one hand with fingers to spare. This shit was serious.
Everything's so... calm. Peaceful, safe for the occasional supervillain attack. The first time I'd been reluctant to go out. By now, I'm always happy to go, because it means tha I'm out there with my team and we all fit together like puzzle pieces. Sure, Steve and Tony butt heads a lot, but it's mostly tempered by the quick glances at each others' asses. It's kinda funny to watch, actually.
Now free, Ultron bends down all the way and grips Steve by the throat, backing him all the way up to the edge of the the truck.
"Hey, fellas," Natasha calls after rolling down her window. "Either one of you know where the Smithsonian is? I'm here to pick up a fossil."
Laughing, I use both hands to fend the over-eager dog off as the rest of the Avengers file past me into the living room.
of their speeders eerily synchronized. Sheathing the blade that’s on the arm attached to my gloved hand, I use it to tug my whip off of its place on my belt. It comes alive with a crack and surge of electricity.
“Stark, we’re on your three and heading northeast,” I hear Nat say. I swing a leg around to kick an alien in the face, using the momentum to yank my reaper out of the corpse of the impaled alien.
Still, we'd apprehended Batroc, but it wasn't Steve. It was Clint, because the bastard had doubled back before I reached him and Batroc was running his way. Neither Nat nor Steve had told us why Batroc had gotten away, but I think that it has something to do with the looks that are ping-ponging back and forth between the two of them.
A cold metal hand closes around my ankle, swinging me around and off of the truck. I spin ass over tit in midair before readjusting, whip still clenched in my hand.
Getting back to the Triskelion is awkward as fuck, because Steve and Natasha keep on throwing each other these
“Yeah, well, Fury helped me set this up after New York,” Clint says, a shadow passing over his face. Laura snakes an arm under his and grabs his shoulder, pulling him in close for a side hug. “He kept it off SHIELD’s files. I’d like to keep it that way.” Sharp blue eyes scan over the rest of the Avengers. “I figure it’s a good place to lay low.”
And then Thor is standing in the middle of the lab, leaping off of the ground, hammer held in a two-handed grip as he brings it down on the Cradle containing whatever Ultron had been planning on creating.
"When Nick was... dying, he slipped something into my boot," I say, forcing the word 'dying' out of my mouth. I bend down to untie my boot in order to hide how I blink away tears. "I don't know what it was, I didn't think it was safe until now," I add, feeling around my boot. I'm proud of how my voice is strong and steady. My fingers brush against the object and I quickly pull it out. Natasha walks forward, snatching the thing out of my hand before I can even get a good look at it.
There's a few crashes, and then a thud. I let out a surprised yelp when the body of a Chitauri is thrown over the side of the bridge in front of me. The crunch of gravel meets my ears, and I squint up at Steve with my one available eye. He's got my whip in one gloved hand, his shield slung over his back.
I make it through the rest of the year of college and prepare to enjoy a summer of relaxation and full-time secret agenting.
"Just because we can't take care of Lucky doesn't mean that we're being sent on a top-secret mission for the government."
I don’t know where the goddamn cafeteria is, I can’t find Fury, Hill or Nat and I don’t want to ask any of the agents. Sighing wearily, I dig a pack of gum out of my pocket, popping a piece in my mouth. It should tide me over for a while—at least until I find something with caffeine.
"If it's all the same to you, I'll have that drink now." I sheathe my reapers, striding forwards and throw my strongest right hook at the god of mischief. He's out like a light before his body even hits the floor.
“You’re trying to get Bruce in bed with you,” I say flatly, locking eyes with my partner. “You want him in bed because you’re scared of the Other Guy. Getting him to have sex with you forms an emotional bond, especially if you spend so much time around him anyways, don’t think I haven’t read the psych book they gave us. You want Bruce in bed with you so that you’re not scared of the Other Guy anymore.”
"You will all fall before me,” he growls. I hum. Not gonna lie, he’d be pretty hot if he wasn’t trying to take over the world. But then Loki throws Tony out the window, with a final shout that I don’t quite hear. My jaw drops, and I hurry over to the broken window. The sound of rocket boosters makes me whirl in surprise, and it’s only instinct that has me moving out of the way of something big and red and metal.
"There's something wrong with me," I whisper to Clint in a corner of the viewing room. What we're supposed to be viewing is Nick Fury lying on an operating table, but my mind is so scrambled that I can't really think straight.
, the archer adds helpfully. My eyes widen in realization before narrowing once more in order to squint in pain. Clint rolls his eyes.
“Their powers,” Thor cuts in, gesturing to the twins, “the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they’re nothing compared to what it can unlessh. But with it on our side…”
"Really sorry, but I just broke up with my ex and she's here with another girl," I mutter into the girl's ear. Thankfully, she catches on quick and laughs, slipping an arm around my shoulders.
"Hold on tight, don't let go no matter what and if you do that right I think we should be able to make it over in one piece."
“I think I get what you’re saying,” Steve says softly. “And I also think that you’re making progress. And I’m glad that you feel comfortable telling me things like that.”
forward, and as it passes by I throw out the arm with the extended blade, hooking it onto the back and letting the cycle drag me through the air. A disgruntled, garbled howl lets me know that the driver knows that I’m tailing him, and I bring my free hand up. Grabbing the glove with my teeth, I yank it off quickly and slam my hand onto the motorcycle.
“Hill!” Nick yells, staggering to his feet. I scramble to turn my radio on, the best solution the tech department could come up with for my situation, just in time to hear Maria’s response.
Steve retreats, letting me drag past him to unload a clip from both guns onto Ultron. He holds up his arm to block the bullets, but I switch targets and go for his exposed stomach and chest.
"Just trying to keep them off the streets," Tony replies. He sounds a little out of breath, but I don't get much farther than that because a Chitauri slams me into the side of a bus.
“You think that’s what Bucky’s going through,” Steve says. And isn’t this a strange conversation to be having with one of us curled up in the vents with a mug of tea tucked into the crook of their elbow, the other sitting cross-legged outside of the vents with their own mug of tea.
We touch glasses, sipping a good amount. The alcohol lights my throat on fire as it goes down, and I shiver at the feeling. It’s nice to know that I can still be human, even if I literally can’t tan or hold a phone to my ear without shorting it out. Still, this tequila won't hit me for a while if I take it slow. I shift so that I’ve got one arm propped up against the bar, acting casual even if we all know that it's just an act.
I fly in feet-first, landing a solid two-leg kick to Ultron’s back, making him stumble forwards only to get a face full of vibranium. He recovers faster than expected, two beams of orange energy sending Steve tumbling off of the truck and into the windshield of the unlucky car behind. Using one hand, he gestures up, a translucent energy ripping the road behind to pieces.
As soon as the jet lands, I’m out and about as quickly as possible, taking in our location. Apparently, Nick had been serious about the flying bases. Helicarriers, that’s what he’d called them.
“Last night,” the genius replies casually. “The packet, Selvig’s notes, the Extraction Theory papers.” A blank look from the rest of the group. “Am I the only one who did the reading?” the billionaire asks exasperatedly. I raise my free hand as I begin screwing the lightbulb back on.
Laura tasks me with taking care of the kids while she and Clint have a quick talk. A look from Clint has me suggesting Nat help me grab some coloring materials for them to preoccupy themselves with.
“Don’t sweat it, I see you,” I call looping around. I angle myself down, eyeing the identified truck. As I draw closer, I can see Steve climbing up the door.
“The only one nagging and hovering is Steve,” I point out, grabbing a bowl and two plates. “I’m not here most of the time. And Steve’s got a good reason to hover and nag.”
“When you’re being shot at, sure. Otherwise you sleep until it’s night and stay up when everyone’s asleep.”
Reining in my speed carefully, I tilt a bit to the left in order to allow Stark more room to maneuver without risk of brushing against me and tumbling into the sea. The billionaire glances at me for a second, jerking his head forwards. I nod, and we both speed up, heading for the Stark Tower that I can see from across the city.
“You think I’m not?” the dark-haired man snaps back, producing a silver bag out of seemingly nowhere. “Why did Fury call us, and why now? Why not before? What isn’t he telling us? I can’t do the equation unless I have all the variables.”
“Shit!” he yells, just as the weight on the roof disappears and the car lurches forwards, propelled by the one behind us. Another hit and the car runs up against the inner barrier. There’s a loud crash, and crane my neck to see Steve ramming his shield against the passenger side door. Nat has her gun.
“You’re right,” the super soldier finally says, letting go of Sitwell and stepping back. “It’s not. It’s hers.” He steps aside, and Natasha lunges forward to plant a solid kick in the center of the Hydra agent’s chest, sending him tumbling over the side of the building with a scream.
I swear softly, eyes darting around frantically as the two supersoldiers engage in a fast series of blocks and jabs. There’s a cracking sound when the Soldier pulls his feet free of the putty.
“Hey, Nat?” I say into my comm, bringing my whip up to block Ultron’s advance. “Cap needs his shield back.”
The farm (“Ranch!” I can almost hear Clint protest) looks exactly like I’d left it a few weeks ago. The curtains upstairs twitch, and I smile quietly to myself as we near the porch.
"Keep talking, Hinojosa," the bald man replies. "Keep talking." He coughs again, and in the bright lights of the fancy hotel, I can see the red liquid that comes up. "Catch Rogers as he comes in," Nick manages to force out. "We should celebrate Hinojosa's first mission together." Clint goes to the door, pressing his ear against it. Nick shifts silently, reaching into a pocket and pulling out a phone.
I watch him walk away numbly, tablet dangling from my gloved hands. I’d just agreed to do something that I’d sworn I’d never do again. And I’m not worried. No, I’m… Well, I’m kinda psyched to do this. And that’s what scares me the most.
“Is it?” Steve asks sharply with the voice of a man who’s had their trust kicked to the side a few too many times. “Are you?” he asks, directing the question at Vision. “On our side?”
"Well, we got its attention," Tony declares all of a sudden. "What the hell was step two?" Clint grunts off to my side, swinging his bow under a Chitauri's feet and stabbing it with an arrow. Nat leaps up onto another alien's back, jamming her widow's bites into it's neck until it collapses.
"Is that what just happened?" Rogers mutters. I muffle a laugh as I float down onto the table again.
Gunshots from whoever is on top of the roof, and Nat is a blur of motion as she lunges into the front seat to shove Steve to the side. Another gunshot, and I lunge forward to cover Sam.
There’s no time to puzzle over Pietro and Wanda’s sudden change of heart, not when there’s another beam of energy heading towards us. This time, Pietro pushes me down to the floor of the train car, following me in a blur of silver-blue. The orange just barely grazes the tops of our heads, cleaving a path clear to the front of the train.
I laugh, taking my feet down from the coffee table as Thor suddenly turns away, towards the door. Steve looks over his shoulder, meeting my eyes and nodding before he follows the demigod out.
Ultron clambers to his feet, energy beam shooting out, and Steve is quickly o raise his shield. The force of the energy sends him flying back into me, and I let him bowl me over in order to roll back to stand in front of him.
"I was thinking that you fly me over to the next building over with a gun and I cover you if anything goes wrong." I nod, slinging the rifle over one shoulder.
“In the future?” I repeat, crouching down to look my former handler in the eyes. “How did it know?” Sitwell lets out a weak chuckle.
“Recall that?” Tony demands. “A hostile alien army dame charging through a hole in space. We’re standing three hundred feet below it. We’re the Avengers.”
"It means that the portal won't collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD," Stark adds as Phil breaks away from the billionaire. He's heading around the conference table, towards Thor. "No hard feelings, Point Break," the playboy says, raising a hand as he draws nearer. "You got a mean swing." He pats Thor's bicep as he walks by.
The clash of metal on metal has my head snapping around just in time to see Steve break free of Ultron’s hold, shield newly acquired.
"Close it," I hear Steve order. And then the beam connecting the potal to Stark Tower disappears, and it begins to shrink. But just before it can completely disappear, something small and red and gold falls out of it. I stagger to my feet, adrenaline pumping through me, providing me with much-needed energy, and launch off of the roof, rocketing towards the falling form of Tony Stark. Arms extended, I snag the Iron Man armor by the arms. There's a lot of momentum, and I can't stay aloft for much longer, so I settle for slowing down the inevitable fall.
"Call it a résumé," Sam says, arms crossed. Nat's arm snakes around my shoulders, lifting the picture from my grasp.
Steve's bicep is ripped out of my grip, and I nearly tumble to the floor as his fist rams into the computer. Natasha catches me by the arm, steadying me before letting go. The other computer screen flickers before Zola appears onscreen again.
"Okay," Steve relents, a frustrated note to his tone. Rumlow nods and turns, going back the way he'd come.
“I’m bringing some plus ones,” I warn, swerving around the corner. I can see Central Park up ahead. “Right about… now.” I make a hard left, coming out on Park and diving low. The sound of machine gun fire reaches my ears, and I grin. I risk a quick glance over one shoulder, and see plumes of black smoke fading as the borrowed SHIELD jet circles back around.
The lightning flares brighter for a second before it disappears altogether, Thor taking a step back on top of the Cradle. The sudden disappearance of the brilliant light leaves spots in my eyes, and I shake my head in an attempt to rid my vision of them.
“Yeah, a minute might be a little dicey, depending,” Steve grunts, ducking under an energy beam. I pull the end of the whip towards me, looping it around my hands twice. The wire digs into my skin, and the electricity rakes sharp needles of pain over the backs of my hands, but I can deal with it.
I was sick and tired of being a weapon. I wanted a normal life, powers or no. They wouldn't let me quit. Some bullshit story about me not being safe for the public. I decided to play their game and hacked their mainframe, threatened to post it online." I grin bitterly. Both Natasha and Maria are avoiding my eyes. I can feel Phil's gaze boring into my back.
“Trail went cold about a hundred miles out, but it’s headed north and it has the sceptre,” Thor recounts. He throws a nasty look at Tony. “Now we have to retrieve it, again.”
To make up for the super-long hiatus for no other reason than lack of motivation and a sudden burst of inspiration pertaining to a different story, I worked all night to get this chapter up and to make it as long as the last one. Hope you enjoy two (almost) back-to-back updates. Feedback is appreciated. I don’t have a beta, so if anyone sees any errors, please point them out and I’ll get them fixed. Again, I’m so sorry about the long hiatus.
There’s a loud bark, and then the sound of skittering claws on wood, before a golden retriever launches itself through the doorway that frames the entrance between living room and entry hall.
Bruce looks up. “Ultron isn’t just a machine,” he says. “He’s an AI. He can assimilate new forms. The real question is has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?”
Cruising just a foot away from the front of Stark Tower, it's gigantic body arches up as it nears the ground. A front flipper takes out a statue on top of the building that Steve, Nat, Clint and I stand in front of. The four of us all turn slowly, watching the massive... I dunno, the massive
“Nuclear codes,” Maria says grimly, seated on a stool and equipped with tweezers as she pulls shards of glass out of the soles of her feet.
"The answer is," Sam begins, rounding the kitchen counter with some sort of file in hand, "you don't." He placed the file down on the table, and my hand shoots out to swipe the file off the table before anyone else. Clint gets up from his seat and moves behind me to look over my shoulder.
“You’re tiptoeing, big man,” Stark says, drifting over to the center of the room. I quickly swipe out of the SHIELD records, returning to my earlier analysis of Loki’s scepter. “You need to strut.” I sigh heavily.
I wake up in tears a week later and crawl into the vents, shaking from the memory of the not-quite-dream.
“Insight’s launching in sixteen hours, were cutting it a little bit close here,” Natasha adds, sticking her head up into the front.
But I know that she’s going to go to my files as soon as I’m out of the room and jot down a note that says that my condition ‘hasn’t worsened’ or that I ‘seem to be retaining a state of mental stability’.
Someone calls me in the middle of the night, on one of the rare ones that I get any sleep at all. Needless to say, I'm a little pissy when I pick up.
"I can't ask you to do this, Sam," the supers oldies says sadly, brow furrowed and face reminiscent to that of a kicked puppy. "You got out for a good reason."
Between Nat, Clint, Steve and me, we get rid of the aliens easily, regrouping behind the two assassins' taxi cab. My radio crackles.
The gunfire has died down, which I take to mean that one of the others have taken care of the Hydra agents. All’s quiet on the bridge, so I figure that Sam has himself handled too.
Natasha’s head lolls back, and her red hair shifts to reveal a slowly spreading dark red patch on her jacket. Sam follows my line of vision, twisting his neck to do so. He quickly turns to one of the STRIKE agents.
The Norse god of mischief can only stare. I stare right back, a small frown on my face as I replay what I’d just said. I slap a hand to my face as I realize what, exactly, I’d just blurted.
I lunge off of the railing, arms coming up to wrap around Tony’s shoulders and swing around, dragging him to the ground. It’s a move that shouldn’t have worked if it wasn’t for the extra kick I used with my flight.
Over the past year, things have really slowed down for me. Sure, occasional supervillain attacks and the tracksuit mafia keep things interesting for me, but most of my life is just going to college and staying up all night, be it for homework or because of insomnia and nightmares. It's great, don't get me wrong, but I always feel like part of me is constantly yearning for something to happen and another part of me is clinging to the normal side of my life.
48 hours after the disaster of a mission, Clint and I are lounging around the hotel that we're in, a few doors down from where Steve is staying when the door creaks open.
There’s a moment in which I think that he’s going to attack, but then something big goes whipping by me and makes a car explode. Steve, Sam and I all turn around to see Clint lowering his bow, Natasha propped up against the car beside him.
Thor follows quickly, the rest of us on his heels. Steve, jumping from the balcony and myself flying after the two—but Thor holds out a hand, fingers splayed in a clear gesture of “stop.”
“It’s the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth,” Bruce explains, pushing himself off the wall he was leaning against and walking towards the table.
It isn’t because I’m scared. No, in fact, that’s exactly why I’m having this bizzare staring contest. These crates don’t scare me, and that’s what really makes me hesitate. How much of me longs to be what I once was? How much of me is always going to be that person at heart? How long can I resist this? What if I don’t want to leave? Squeezing my eyes shut tightly, my fingers clench around the bench, loosening when I open them.
After the day (was it a day? Time zones are the fucking worst.) that we’d had, I don’t blame them for the latter.
“I know,” Steve says flatly. “We’ll use Pierce to bypass the DNA scans and access the helicarriers directly.”
“Shit, Cap,” I say, tumbling to a messy landing at the front of the train. We’re no longer on any tracks, the momentum from its previous planned path having the train plough through concrete streets.
"I'm sorry to have to do this, but I had no place else to crash," Nick says. I raise an eyebrow as I lay my boss down on the white couch. Aw, shit. That blood is going to stain, isn't it?
"Call it, Captain," Tony says. His voice sounds small and tinny coming from inside the Iron Man armor. There's a brief moment of hesitation from Steve, but the supersoldier pulls it together quickly.
I swear, using my other foot to kick his hands away as the whirr of machinery draws nearer. Rolling out of the window and lying on air like it’s solid ground, I look up to see Tony, clad in full Iron Man regalia, repulsors held out like he wanted a high five or something.
"And there's Tony's dickbag dad," Clint mutters, peering at a photo of Howard Stark, which is directly next to that of Peggy Carter's.
“I don’t think we should be focusing on Loki,” Banner says. “That’s guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.” The (demi)god in the room frowns at the green giant.
"Captain, it would be my genuine pleasure," the blonde says, grinning. Then he turns, drawing the arrow and shooting within the space of a second, just as the Chitauri begin to fire. Steve and Nat surge into action, Steve going one way as Nat rises to her feet, handguns raised. I crack my whip, deactivating it as I leap over the hood of a car and draw my handguns as I land.
Natasha comes in from the entry way, where she’d gone to greet Lucky, walking towards Laura. Clint slips out of her grip, moving away as Nat moves into place, hands coming up to touch Laura’s swollen, very much pregnant stomach. “How’s little Natasha, hun?”
“Nuclear codes,” Rhodey agrees, moving towards the center of the room. “Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.”
“What will you do?” Vision asks, genuine curiosity ringing through his otherwise expressionless facade.
Waking up is painful, even if I haven't even moved yet. There's light piercing my closed eyelids, and I whimper when I make an attempt to bring a hand up to shield them.
"Army regulations forbid storing munitions within 500 yards of the barracks," Steve says, already hurrying over. "This building is in the wrong place." We reach the door quickly.
"I got a ride," she replies, walking a little ways away. "I could use a boost though." Steve looks up at the Chitauri speeders still whizzing by, and I see realization dawn on the part of his face that I can see from under the cowl. He backs up, and I watch their backs, wrist reapers sheathed and the alien gun-blade thing held at the ready in their place. It looks simple enough; small trigger on the bottom of the long rod (presumably the barrel), press that and it shoots.
“Bucky?” Steve whispers. My hand has subconsciously drifted up to the exact same spot as where my injury had been in the not-quite-memory, the phantom pressure of a bandage long gone lingering on my skin.
“When they come, and they will, they’ll come for you,” the billionaire says firmly, determination lacing his voice. He walking forwards as he speaks, confidence so real that I almost buy that he’s absolutely unafraid. But there’s no such thing as a human without fear, and I know that for a fact. Everyone gets scared. Tony is no exception, as invulnerable as he may appear to others.
“This could’ve been avoided if you hadn’t played with something you don’t understand,” Thor snaps, waving a hand around angrily.
“Tony!” I yell, walking into the workshop only to be greeted by unnecessarily-loud heavy metal. “Tony!” No answer. “Tony!”
I duck a blow from Ultron, one hand slipping into my jacket to grab a knife, jamming it up into what would be a human rib cage. Ultron stumbles back as electricity travels up my arm, and I curse at the sharp, zapping pinpricks of pain that flash across my skin.
“Alright, I’m clear,” Cap declares barely a minute later, coming online once more. I breath a sigh of relief.
The Soldier kneels for a brief second, and something rolls away under the cars. He takes careful aim.
“Stop it!” Ultron commands, tone seemingly genuinely offended. He bats the shield from his chest and puts a hand out releasing a beam of orange energy. I zip forwards, rolling into a landing on top of the truck and standing to cover Steve quickly.
"The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me." A pause. "Slightly." The speed of clicking keys increases a little bit, but it might just be Clint looking something up on the Internet. I glance over.
Clint has an arrow nocked and drawn in the space of a second, and I swap my whip to my right hand, the one with a bracelet, ready to move at a moment’s notice.
“Should we call ahead and actually tell Laura that we’re bringing five other people over for a visit?” I mutter. “It’s not too late.” Clint’s eyes meet mine in the glass of the cockpit, and he raises an eyebrow.
“Please tell me that you’re going to appeal to my humanity,” the god says, advancing forwards. I can feel Stark roll his eyes as I vault over the stone and metal guard that lines the ramp that we’re walking on, landing behind a bar stocked with alcohol.
"Uuuuh, mostly techs," Rumlow says, swiping off of the picture and pulling up a list of names with pictures beside them. "One officer." He clicks on a picture, and it enlargens.
Up at the window, the red of the creature turns into a scaly-looking dark green-blue and it turns, floating down to the ground beside Thor. I follow suit, albeit warily, hands resting at my hips, where my knives are.
“Not important right now,” I reply dismissively, setting eggs, milk, chives, cheese, bread and butter on the counter. “What is is the fact that you’re not fucking eating.”
The benefits of being invisible: your enemy never sees you coming until you kill them. The small group is quickly disposed of, and I leap off the ground, heading down a block and slicing the head off of a few Chitauri on speeders. There’s a howl, and I look up to see a larger group of aliens heading for me, the
“Like we weren’t doing that before,” I mutter petulantly, munching on a fresh handful of blueberries.
“If either of you want me to work anything, you need to get Ultron out of the way,” Nat replies. “Cam, Cap, you better keep him occupied.”
“The latter, I think,” Nat comments, as we pass by a coatrack with a hammer and a red cape hung up on it, a familiar red, white and blue shield leaning against the bottom. I look at the three objects with vague confusion. Also the coat rack, because when the fuck did SHIELD get coatracks?
I sigh, but crawl in on Clint’s other side. His hand rests on my waist, just over the scars, and there’s part of me that’s freaking out, but there’s still another part that whispers
“No, Ultron could’ve assimilated JARVIS,” Bruce says, shaking his head. “This isn’t strategy, this is… rage.”
“Do we have an ally?” Nat asked, a wary sort of hope in her eyes. It is a new look that I quite like, but Nick’s own eye is hard.
There’s a roar of effort from off to my right, where I’d last seen the Soldier. Steve is already beside him, muscles straining to lift a massive length of metal off of his former childhood friend.
Glass breaks as someone drops from the bridge above me, shattering the windshield with the force of the impact.
The door to my room creaks open quietly, and I stiffen instinctively, thinking of the vent cover that I’d left on the floor in my haste to cram myself into the air ducts.
The smoke fades, the figure straightens—then it surges forwards in a burst of movement, beelining towards Thor. The demigod is smart enough not to stand his ground, instead turning his body and lifting his hands to push the strange creature past him, out into the lounge just beyond.
There’s a loud shriek as I round the corner of the truck that Steve had been thrown over, the source of which was another knife of the Soldier’s being scraped across the aforementioned truck. Steve ducks, and I leap into the air, coming down almost immediately with one foot outstretched.
“You know, I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me,” Steve sighs.
It seems like an eternity, but the car door stops sliding and Sam rolls off of me and I roll off of Nat who rolls off of Steve and we all stand up to look around warily.
Clint takes the wheel, lifting the jet off the ground gently and navigating us into cloud cover expertly.
I scramble to my feet, propelling myself directly into his back, making him drop the blonde. Dropping back down to the platform and pressing myself against it in order to avoid the punch that the Soldier throws. Twisting my body so that my hands can grab the edge of the platform, I let the rest of my body follow my hands and swing myself under the platform, shooting out on the other side.
"Yeah," the STRIKE operative says, unbuckling his parachute. "You seemed pretty helpless without me." The rest of STRIKE floats down like snowflakes from hell, and Nat lands beside me, Clint a little ways away.
"Alright," Tony breathes. "Hey. Alright." He's grinning now. "Good job, guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just... take a day." The genius strains to look at the Hulk. "Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.”
"And why would I do that?" Clint goes eerily still next to me, rifle in hand, breathing steady, eyes focused.
“That’s just the prototype,” Stark replies proudly. “I’m kinda the only name in clean energy right now.” I roll my eyes.
“Uh, actually, we were planning to threaten you,” Stark corrects, making his way down the ramp at his own pace. Loki’s smarmy smirk makes me wrinkle my nose.
“What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?” Steve presses, backing Sitwell towards the edge of the roof. Nat comes to stand beside me, arms crossed.
“Holding up the damn base and buying you more time!” I yell, grunting as I force myself up a little higher, trying to keep the massive airship balanced. “Move your ass, ‘cause I’m not sure if I can hold this indefinitely.” My response is met by the sounds of shrieking metal, which makes me wince. The base drops half an inch on my side, and I swear vehemently as I shove it back into place.
"The answer to your question is fascinating," Zola says. "Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it." There's a whirring, and Steve whips around, shield already in motion. Too late. The glorified frisbee bounces off the closed doors of the elevator, and I duck so that I won't get hit as it returns to the supersoldier.
"Don't" —I whip out a knife, jamming it deep into the head of a Chitauri. Over to my right, I can see Clint being tackled by anothe alien— "die!" Nat got ahold of one of the alien's guns, and uses it to shoot one in the head before spinning into a crouch and firing another shot straight through another Chitauri's chest. Clint staggers upright, arrow jammed firmly in the chest of the alien that had tackled him.
"That's why I don't ask," he yells over the sound of the wind rushing past us. I walk over to the edge.
“Uh, I just want to finish my work here and…” Banner gestures vaguely, trailing off. Rogers looks at the doctor seriously.
“I think it has to do with the time you snuck out through the air vents with a stab wound, a broken ankle and a mild concussion,” Natasha points out. She looks at me meaningfully, gesturing for me to join the two on the bed. I look at it dubiously, but my two partners both edge a little to the side, leaving a small wedge of space for me.
“Right here,” I reply, turning visible once I’m hovering near the ceiling. Banner's eyebrows rise, making an attempt to merge with his hairline. Rogers looks suitably shell-shocked, and I laugh as I float down onto the table. "I’d rather not demonstrate it now, but I’m immune to all forms of energy except force, light and sound,” I explain. “Really irritating when you’re trying to tan, but useful when you’re being electrocuted.
“Sounds exhausting,” Stark says. I snort, climbing up on to the table and float off of it to begin unscrewing the crooked lightbulb, careful to only touch it with my gloved hands. Sue me and my OCD tendencies. Stark stares. Points at me again.
"Jury's out," Stark replies flippantly, turning back to Banner. "You really have got a lid on it, haven't you?"
"The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up SHIELD will know exactly where we are," Natasha is saying quietly.
“Well, you might not like this one as much,” Clint replies. “Guess who decided to pop up again? I’ll give you a hint: he’s got one eye.”
It feels like we’re sneaking through Avengers Tower, even if Steve striding Through the hallways, shield on full display is anything but. At the very least, Tony and Bruce don’t see us until we’re actually in the lab.
The front of the beast tips over the side of the bridge, and as the smoke begins to clear I can hear the sounds of Chitauri roaring their disproval. Hulk roars right back as the seven of us circle up, readying our weapons. Clint pulls an arrow from his quiver, nocking, drawing and sighting along the rise of his bow; Thor readjusts his grip on Mjölnir; Nat reloads her guns; Steve brings his shield up in a defensive position; Tony fires up his repulors with a whine; I holster my handguns, taking out my whip.
Natasha snorts, fingers moving to grip my hand. “I’ve gone soft,” she murmurs. “If even that birdbrain noticed, I don’t know what I’m going to do now. My days as a spy are over.”
“JARVIS,” I hear the billionaire mutter, pushing himself to his feet. “Any time now.” I pause as Loki catches up to the other ravenette, seizing him by the throat this time.
The sandy-blonde archer only stares at me, so I take that as a ‘go ahead’, slowly reaching for the cuffs that bind his wrists to the bed. The action gives me a brief moment of respite to recompose myself, to push all thoughts out of my mind. Once his hands are free, I hand him his aids. He only takes them after a few more beats of utter shock. Nat stands up to get him a glass of water.
"Hey, maybe swing by the Tower sometime, if I can get a look at those gloves then I may be able to hook you up with something subtler," Tony suggests.
I find Nat with Clint, sitting at his side in the medwing. The archer is comatose, cuffed to the bed. I clear my throat as I knock on the door. The redhead looks up, and the moment I see the faint tear tracks on her face, I know. I know that Phil is dead, that this is real, because Natasha doesn’t cry unless she has to, and this… this is definitely worth crying for.
Cam?” he asks weakly. I nod hesitantly, moving aside so that Natasha can sit on the edge of the bed to hand the archer a glass of water. “But—But you left.” I hug myself self-consciously, looking at my boots.
“Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew,” I rasp in rapid succession, nearly gagging as the hand around my throat goes slack. I remove the limb quickly, dropping it out of the sky. Another laser hits me, and I grunt in pain. “Alright, that’s it. I’m going glass.”
“No dramatic rainbow bridge exits!” I call after the two. “I spent two hours mowing that lawn, you don’t get to screw it up!”
Rolling my eyes, I turn my attention back to my screen and start flipping through the files quickly. Having read Stark’s files, there’s a 99% chance that the genius is going to hack SHIELD. I just have to be faster than him and take care of everything they have on me that wasn’t in the briefing packet. It’s simple; surprisingly so.
, he's typed out. I quickly retreat to the kitchen, but my enhanced hearing can pick out Steve's reply even a room away as I open up the cabinets. "Like I told these two, there wasn't any other place to party." I glance out into the living room, and see another message.
At some point, Natasha returns and hands Clint a fresh set of aids. The archer locks challenging eyes onto Sam as he puts them on, but the other man simply stares for a few short seconds before shrugging and continuing to eat breakfast at midday.
I blacked out at some point, but I know it’s not for long because I’m not dead yet and there are pieces of debris falling all around me, similar to the one that’s impaled in my leg. I hiss in pain as I attempt to lift myself to my feet, but collapse back to the floor.
I grin, bending down to plant two quick kisses on their foreheads, one hand moving independently to get my last spare dampener on my wrist.
Clint is a mess, even more so than usual. Especially with Barney popping up and then dying for him. That's not what he wanted for him, even if Barney was a peice of shit brother and tried to kill him. In the end, Barney gave his life for Clint and actually made an effort. I guess I can kinda forgive him. Not a whole lot, but enough.
“And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us,” Tony quips. I drop down to the floor, moving aside in order to allow Bruce a better view.
“So,” I begin, shoving the glove into a pocket and angling myself up once again, “turns out my ‘mojo’, as you put it, works on alien shit.”
“Demetrius Hinojosa, but I go by Cam," I say. "You might also know me as the Black Lynx.” Rogers' eyes widen for a moment, obviously over his previous shock, and he leans forward in his chair.
“Okay, come here,” I sigh, tucking the small box I’d been holding into my back pocket and reaching out to snatch the screwdriver in Tony’s hand away. When he makes a small noise of dissent and reaches for the screwdriver, I snag his wrist and drag him back the way I’d come. For some reason, the roomba follows us into the elevator and into the kitchen.
“Let’s play,” I mutter. And then I swing my whip at the first wave, the cord that’s channeling the electricity slicing through them like a scythe through wheat, or whatever you use it for. Expect for that one Greek myth. I’m not going to butcher my dad today. Several purple lasers hit my chest in rapid succession, and I stumble back. I recover quickly, whip lashing out with lightning (ha, get it?) speed in order to cut the next ones down.
“Oh, yeah,” I reply sheepishly. “Sorry about that. It was fun while it lasted.” My gaze skips over each person in the room quickly. There are two blondes, both with muscles the width of my head and blue eyes. That’s where the similarities end, though; one is dressed in armor that my fingers itch to touch and the other is decked out in red, white and blue; one of them has long, flowing locks while the other has a cut that reminds me of the military ones that some of the agents around me sport. Not surprising, since Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, fought in World War II.
And yet, I can't move. Because this isn't something that I signed up for, and there's an entire army of aliens in front of me.
“I don’t know about that, but it is powered by the cube,” Fury says grimly. “And I’d like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.” Thor looks up from his brooding.
The name is foreign to me, because I had known the Winter Soldier, the Asset under Hydra’s control. Not Bucky, whoever that was. Even if Steve gave me a detailed life recap of Bucky Barnes, I don’t think I’d ever be able to
“You three will be the death of me, I swear,” she mutters, ushering me out of the kitchen. My throat closes up at those ten familiar words, spoken over and over in a different, drier, male tone. Laura stills, hand on my back. “You need a second?” she asks softly.
"It's okay, I get the feeling," she replies, winking. I laugh, glancing over my shoulder to make sure that the agents have passed me by.
“Stalling me won’t change anything,” Loki says, in a tone that clearly communicates how highly he thinks of himself.
I didn’t expect Cap to actually come and ask my little trio to suit up, but he does. Clint and Nat go their way, and Maria tracks me down to drag me to the storage room, shoving a few crates at me and directing me to a room where I can change. There’s a single bench in here, and that’s where I sit. The boxes sit in front of me, and I’m straddling the bench, having the most intense staring contest with my past than any other that I’ve had before.
“Now, Maria!” I exclaim, because the Soldier had gotten enough leverage to flip Steve over and escape the chokehold and he’s heading straight for me. I bring my reapers up to protect my face from the metal arm heading straight towards it, the blades jamming themselves into the Soldier’s arm. I wrench them out, ducking as a shield flies forwards, slamming into the Soldier’s chest.
"Well,” the archer begins, “if I put an arrow in Loki’s eye socket, I’d sleep better I suppose.” He finishes off with a small nod, as if he’s trying to convince himself of it as much as us. We all know that killing Loki won’t do anything to help the nightmares.
I cock an eyebrow as I take in Tony’s appearance. If I didn’t know better and saw him walking down the street in this state, I’d put my life savings on him being a hobo. His hair is sticking out in all directions, grease and oil streaking through it. His facial hair is looking less like a carefully-sculpted goatee and more like a developing bread. His face is smeared with some dirt-like substance and oil is smeared just under his right eye. His eyes are bloodshot and have a sort of maniacal glint to them. He’s wearing a white tank top, but the bottom is ripped and torn, the rips giving away the fact that they were caught on something sharp and ripped away carelessly. His feet are bare, and the sweatpants are covered in even more grease and oil.
“Load ‘em up!” someone calls, and then I’m being dragged to my feet by a man, this one who I recognize. Jack Rollins, Rumlow’s second in command. Probably also Hydra. They slap some heavy-duty cuffs on me, and I’m not even sure if you can actually call them cuffs because you basically stack my arms on top of each other and close the whole thing around them. I swallow, finding my voice as I stumble over to a van. Two STRIKE members are already opening the back.
Nat turns back to the computer, fingers flying across the keys. “Yeah, I bet he… “ She pauses, before sitting back to reveal the standard SHIELD ‘RECORD DELETED’ in place of any useful information. “Yep,” the redhead says grimly. “Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.”
The three of us emerge into a massive room, where all I can see is a clusterfuck of activity that makes me slightly dizzy. The only thing close to this that I’ve seen in a year is the chem lab, but only after something explodes. Phil taps my shoulder, bringing my attention to a small group of people standing and sitting around a large round table.
“I’m fine, mama bear,” I reply tiredly, curling up and shifting so that my upper body is facing the exit to the vents. “Cool your jets.” The door to the bedroom creaks open, and soft footsteps make their way around the bed. A mug of tea, bold black letters on the mug spelling out ‘MY IDEA OF HELP FROM ABOVE IS A SNIPER ON THE ROOF’.
The Soldier has already collected himself, standing dead center in the middle of the catwalk and barring the way to the control panel. I can’t see Steve’s expression from behind him, but I can almost feel the sheer amount of sadness pouring off of the blonde in waves.
I clench my jaw, bracing my hands on the slippery glass, and drag myself over to position my hands underneath the metal on the Soldier’s other side. Together, Steve and I pull the metal up just enough for the Soldier to wriggle out from under it.
“It’s good to see you,” she says softly. I smile hesitantly, still unsure of what to do. It’s been a year without contact, and after all that we’ve been through… well, I’m not entirely sure if she’s had more time to think about what I’d done in the past. Fury is easy. Nat, though…
“You think I’m a child of Ultron,” the vision says. His tone implies statement, wording that of a question.
“Well, you did something right,” Steve retorts, arms crossed tightly across his chest. “And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.”
“And you do?” Bruce pipes up, voice uncharacteristically stony. His eyes are fixed on Wanda. “She’s not in your head?”
Tony and I make eye contact, and I grimace. Steve is staring stoically at the wall, Thor is standing off to the side, hands rubbing together nervously. Nat is hunched over, eyes staring at me, unseeing, an eerie likeness to when she was under Maximoff’s mind warp.
Sirens alert me to the presence of the police, and I jump out of hiding as a small fleet of speeders zoom by overhead, heading for the officers. Whipping around, I fire seven more shots. Shoving the empty handgun back into its place on my belt, I use the nearest falling speeder as a springboard to boost my leap. I yank my whip out from its place in midair, using it to snag the neck of another Chitauri without activating it. The cord easily chops through the neck, decapitating the alien.
"No, not until he tells me what the fuck he means by that!" I yell back, rounding on Zola. The computer simply smiles.
“Narcissistic, but the aesthetic is nice,” I reply cheerfully, touching down lightly in order to bound across slate-grey floors. A chill washes over me, and the sound of an extra set of footsteps alerts me to Loki’s arrival. I pull my goggles up so that they hold the loose bits of hair out of my face.
"I'm pretty sure that Nat and I know who killed Fury," I say. Steve steps away from Natasha, eyebrows raised. I bite my lip, crossing my arms. "Natasha probably knows more of the specifics, but when I was on the roof I tried to get him with my whip." I swallow nervously, glancing at Clint. "And, uh, I... I don't know what it was, but it was like a memory and..."
“Wondergirl, don’t waste your breath,” Stark recommends. “Cap, I’m gonna coach you through this. Don’t screw it up. JARVIS, remind me to look up unicorn fairies later.” I grind my teeth together, jaw clenching and muscles flexing as I struggle to keep aloft. It’s getting harder by the second, and I don’t think I’ll be able to hold on to it for much longer. There’s a few small explosions, and a lot of yelled instructions on Stark’s part before Rogers can be heard.
"Look, Fury gave me a separate mission," she explains. "One that didn't involve protecting the hostages. That's why he called for you two."
"Roger that," I mumble, prying the last arrow free and dropping it to the ground with the others. "Mind giving me a location?"
"I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstance. It's not all things to all people, all the time. Neither am I."
"Lynx, a block north and to your left is a restraunt. More of them are in there, about twenty civilians."
“I might need to visit Oslo, find our unknown,” Tony chips in, walking away from the dartboard and leaning into the kitchen.
"Too shy, or too scared?" Nat calls to Steve as he attaches his shield to the magnets on the back of his suit. I slip my mask on, tightening the strap that keeps it in place.
Vision’s hand sweeps down low, over the coffee table, and when he raises his arm, Mjölnr grasped in one hand, the whole world seems to grind to a halt.
“All our work is gone,” Bruce says tiredly, rubbing his eyes under his glasses. “Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.”
“Oh, we’re way past that,” Bruce says, tone dismissive. “I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.”
"Tell him to suit up," the playboy orders. "I'm bringing the party to you." Far down the street, I spot a small speck of red and gold round the corner. And right after Tony is the whale-turtle-fish-centipede, one of its fins clipping the edge of a building. The crashing catches everyone else's attention, and everyone readies their weapons.
"Taking History as an online major was not my best decision," I mumble. "Clint's asleep. I'm gonna let him nap until a reasonable time. There any deadlines we should be meeting for arrival?"
Steve’s shield whizzes past as Ultron flies back down to the roof of the truck, and I use the momentary distraction as an opening to snare the robot’s feet with my whip, activating it as I do.
"About time you showed up," I say, leaning against an overturned car. Banner simply shrugs as everyone heads over to where he stands, hands in his pockets.
“We’re going to loop around,” Clint calls over his shoulder. “Don’t expect us too soon. It’s gonna take awhile.” Rogers looks at me confusedly as I pass him, a small frown turning the corners of his mouth down and furrowing his brow.
I duck behind a nearby car on instinct, hands sheltering my head. When no impact comes, I poke my head around the bumper cautiously. There’s no one there, and so I edge out from behind the car.
“You came just in time,” Nat says, chin resting on Clint’s shoulder. “I was just about to tell Clint about what happened to the resident pining lovebirds.”
The not-roomba zooms forward at a much faster speed than it ha been moving previously, and slams into the Iron Man armor.
“Humankind,” I chip in. “It’s less sexist.” I’d watched Nick interrogate Loki on the way up. Banner looks at me, vaguely bemused.
“Ultron can’t tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it,” Wanda finally says grimly. “Where do you think he gets that?”
"Lynx, I trust that you can take care of this yourself," he says, "but Fury recruited you under duress. He said that you were only here to track the cube. You shouldn't be out here, fighting with us. You were never meant to be here."
Pietro runs in in a blur of silver-blue, the trail he leaves behind almost lazy in its appearance. Clint follows, lurking back in the doorway.
“I spent a good ten years dealing with things by myself,” I say carefully. “Or, I mean, I thought I did. Because I never told anyone, really, but some of them seemed to know.” There is sorrow clawing it’s way up from my stomach, working its way up my throat and lodging itself there in an attempt to block my words. I’m not sure how to feel about how comfortable I am with carving a cavity to force the words through. “And when I left, I realized just how much I wasn’t dealing when I didn’t have people to help. And I did bad things. Like, not bad-bad things, but things. And…” I groan, tipping my head to rest against the vents. “And I wanted to just stop. Stop being, I guess. But not completely, I don’t think. And I stopped with the bad things. But they left marks. They definitely left marks. And, uh. I didn’t like the marks, so I covered them up. And being back, that’s just peeling the shitty paint job off. And I’m not sure how to feel about it, but I know that I don’t want to stop anymore. And I don’t want to stop stopping either, so. There’s that. And. God. That must have been so confusing, I don’t know how to—“
Something red and gold shoots by, a white object balanced on top of it. I watch Stark ascend with wide eyes, ignoring the left side of my face and the pain in my torso. Up and up and up and up—and then he disappears into the portal. One, two, three, four seconds pass. And then one of the whale-centipede-turtle-fish things falls out of the sky, heading right for the building that I'm on top of. I sprint to the edge of the roof, leaping as far and as fast as I can. There's a heart-stopping moment where I'm terrified that my flying isn't going to kick in—and then it does, just as the alien aircraft slams into the roof that I'd just deserted.
“Drop the shield, Cap!” Rumlow shouts, gun pointed at the very center of Steve’s chest. “Get on your knees!” He advances forwards. “Get on your knees!” I raise my hands above my head warily, eyes narrowed at the approaching people.
"I'm going to try running a tracer," Natasha mutters. "This is a program SHIELD developed to track hostile malware after Clint bribed the Sci Div into bugging the system for Valentine's Day, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from."
“Can anyone make it down to the Disney store on 47th?” Steve asks. There is an explosion a few blocks off, and then the sound of a shield slamming into something big and fleshy can be heard over the comms.
"Office building, about a block and a quarter south of your position," Clint replies. I hear the sound of glass crunching underneath his feet. "I can see you from here."
The first Maximoff, Pietro, was hard. Staying off the ground seemed like the most logical option, although if the kid (and I shouldn’t be calling him that, because I’m only twenty-one, but damn, I have never felt so fucking old) could run on walls we might have a problem.
The kick collides with the Soldier’s metal hand, and I grit my teeth as the force of the impact reverberates throughout my entire body. After a beat of hesitance, I use the residual momentum to throw my body forwards, bending in half to grab the Soldier’s wrist and wrench my ankle free of his grasp. I twist as the ground comes up to meet me, hitting it in a roll with my right shoulder.
“This is insane,” Bruce mutters, walking over to stand just at the edge of the 3D schematic of what used to be JARVIS.
The moment I hear that Clint is back, I escape medical and go looking. It’s not like being hit with a laser is anything serious to me, so I figure I’m good. Besides, I need to confirm something. Because Phil can’t be dead, he can’t be, he’s definitely going to be alive, he has to survive. Nat will know. And Nat is with Clint.
"If you want to get up there, you're going to need a ride." Nat tosses the alien weapon at me, and I catch it with a grin.
"What the fuck is that on your shoes?" the blonde exclaims. I crack my eyelids to inspect the brown substance splattered on the soles of my boots.
“Steve,” I mutter, yapping the supersoldier on the arm and tilting my head a little away from the Maximoffs. The blonde raises an eyebrow but complies, walking a few feet out of earshot with me.
In the other room, Tony throws a dart. Clint makes his way into the kitchen. “He still going after launch codes?”
I jump, spinning horizontally over a swipe from an alien gun, step out of it gracefully and swivel to deliver a fatal headshot. More Chitauri are arriving. I leap over Clint, who's sliding and turning, ready to fire an arrow. Flipping over another car, I leap over one more and land solidly on top of a Chitauri. Slamming my armguards onto a nearby car, the blades whoosh out and I use them to decapitate another alien.
All the weight that the Soldier had been putting into pulling me back suddenly has nothing to balance it, and he crashes to the ground just as the door to the control room slams open to reveal Steve, shield held up defensively, probably from ramming the door that I hadn’t noticed the Soldier lock behind him.
I don’t miss the way that the supersoldier doesn’t say it. The Soldier. Two words, but not empty. On the contrary, they’re packed full of meaning. Meaning tied tightly to murder and violence.
Honestly, I feel like I'm running out of creative chapter names. Seriously, I named one 'Fuckity Fuck Fuck Fuck'. Ah, well. Getting to the juicy parts, so inspiration should be striking anytime now.
The hard drive that Nick had slipped into my boot is digging into my foot, but I make sure to act like nothing's there. There should be nothing there to anyone who's looking.
“Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet,” Banner says.
I’d feel bad for Steve and Tony if not for the fact that they’d been dancing around each other for nearly two years.
As soon as we're out of the city limits, Steve floors the gas on the stolen car. Clint and I are sprawled out in the backseat, and Nat is comfortable with her feet propped up on the dashboard. I have a few unfinished worksheets out, propped up on Clint's legs as I scrawl out answers.
I whip out my own, bracing my hands on the dashboard as I kick my legs up, body screaming in protest as my feet slam into the Winter Soldier through the hole in the roof.
"It was Operation Paperclip after World War II," the superspy says. "SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value."
Vision seems to take that as his permission to leave, because that’s precisely what he does, golden cape swishing behind him.
Tony jerks back when the dart embeds itself in the bullseye of the dartboard, and Clint shrugs smugly as the genius turns on him with an accusing glare.
Before anyone can get any further than that, though, the sound of human feet against floor becomes audible.
Surprisingly, Nat actually obeys, throwing a look at Steve. I rerun another string of code in my head before scribbling it down. She wants something from him, and she's probably going to get it. Natasha always does.
“He has an army called the Chitauri, that none of Asgard nor any world know,” the blonde explains. “He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth. In return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.” Rogers raises an eyebrow.
"Lets play, bitches," I mutter, charging them head-on. The first one I take out by rolling right before I reach the speeder, slamming my feet down on the head of the driver. It tailspins into a nearby building, the heat of the ensuing explosion making my hair whip around my face. The second one manages to fire off a few good shots before I twist, coming up underneath it and jamming my reapers into the bottom. Using the grip that they provide me, I let out a yell as I ram the speeder into another. The last one is taken down by Clint from afar, and I breathe a sigh of relief just as my radio crackles.
I follow her out, right behind Steve and Clint. Try not to wince when the hard drive stabs the sole of my foot.
"Get in the fucking car, man, we need to get coffee," I call, brushing my hair out of my face. Captain America is in jogging clothes, and there's another man beside him. About a head shorter than him, give or take a few inches, muscular, African American. Jogging clothes too. Maybe Steve's running buddy? Nah. It might not look like it, but the blonde is a little shit. I've seen it up close and personal when it came to hoarding popcorn.
Honestly, the Tower could single-handedly keep the takeout industry in business because that seems to be all we eat.
“Hey, hey, hey, I’m one of those people,” I protest. It’s safe to talk about ‘the kids’ over the phone, even now, with Ultron. ‘The kids’ is vague, and doesn’t flesh out any details about the brats. They’d be safe if Ultron ever overheard this conversation.
“The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it,” Thor argues. I raise an eyebrow mockingly.
"So, Cam," Clint begins carefully. I tense. "Now that this is all over you're going back, right?" I nod slowly. "And you're going to Tandon School of Engineering?" I nod again, this time a little more confident. "Look, I'm not saying you have to, but Phil said that you lived all the way over in East Williamsburg, and I checked and saw that Bed Stuy was closer and I already have an apartment there and I was wondering if you wanted to maybe move in?" There's a beat of silence. "Like, you don't need to be involved in any of the SHIELD stuff, but I thought that it would be nice for you to be closer to your college, and..."
Clint and I look straight at Loki, and Natasha leans in to whisper something to him. Clint smiles slowly. I flip the god of mischief the bird with my good hand. Thor offers one end of the tube to Loki. He takes it, albeit reluctantly, and Thor nods to us all once. Then he twists his end of the tube and the brothers disappear in a flash of blue light. I blink the spots out of my eyes, wincing in pain as the fading bruise on the left side of my face makes itself known. Clint's arm is heavy around my shoulder, his hand intertwined with Natasha's where it rests on my shoulder.
“I think we both know that the timeline doesn’t fit,” Steve says. “For the memories.” And I remember telling him, after the Winter Soldier fiasco, when we were both confined to beds and moved into the same room so that Nat and Clint could keep watchful eyes on us at the same time. Something had flickered behind his eyes when I’d told him of the man he knew as his best friend nearly scraping my eyeball out of its socket in a brutal sparring match.
“Hydra,” I breathe. Saying the name out loud used to never carry the weight that it does now, but from what I’ve been not-quite-dreaming, I don’t think they used me for two years then froze me for another fifty-so.
Sam soars overhead, depositing Sitwell back on the roof, before looping around and sticking a landing, wings retracting into the jetpack on his back. Natasha, Steve and I all make our way over to Sitwell, who’s on his hands and knees.
Clint’s expression tightens from where he’s leaned up against the railing of the staircase leading into the lab, arms propped up on the railing.
Movement out of the corner of my eye, and I bend over into a back handspring in order to avoid Steve's shield. Twisting mid-flip, I push hard with my hands to add momentum to my land, flying through the air and planting my feet in the chest of an alien attempting to come up behind Nat. Steve, Nat, Clint and I are back to back now, fighting off as many aliens as we can while watching each others' backs.
There's a quiet splash behind me, and I peer over the side of the ship. Steve waves at me from below. It only takes about thirty seconds for him to climb up the massive chain anchoring the Lemurian Star. As soon as he's up on deck, I take off running. Turning the corner, I see two more guards crumpled on the deck, arrows poking out of their chests. Tranqs, because Captain America was on this op.
"I'm multi-tasking," the redhead calls over her shoulder, splitting off to jump over the railing. Clint jogs up beside me, bow out and arrow nocked. Steve nods once to the archer, and Clint grins back.
“The Avengers,” Stark points out noncommittally, taking another sip of honey-colored scotch. Loki and I both raise an eyebrow. Me, because I didn't know that Stark knew what Phil had named the program, and Loki because... I can't even find the smallest part of me that gives a shit about why he'd raised an eyebrow. “It’s what we call ourselves, sort of like a team,” the billionaire elaborates. “Earth’s Mightiest Heroes type of thing.”
Tony hooks me up with bracelets that dampen my disruptor shield. Much subtler, easy to take on and off.
Vision’s eyes fall to my hands, understanding of sorts rippling across his face. “I don’t want to kill Ultron,” he admits, head bowing. “He’s unique, sndhes in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he’s built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others.”
An hour later, I peer over Clint and Natasha’s shoulders as New York comes into view, careful not to accidentally touch anything with my bare skin. My radio is clipped to my shoulder, hair pulled back in a high pony in order to avoid it getting in my way.
Visits to the Tower (nicknamed the Avengers Tower, since all of us had a place there) were regular. Movie nights were disasters. Bruce, Tony and Steve are living there full-time, and I would but it's a little far from Tandon.
An hour, a few stolen hats and four cups of coffee later, Steve, Natasha, Clint and I are all walking through a mall.
He stumbles, tipping backwards, but one of his hands manages to turn into a sort of propulsion jet and keep him upright.
"Right. Better clench up, Legolas." Grabbing Clint by the quiver, Tony fires up his boosters and the two take off quickly.
I hold my breath almost reflexively, reaching for my whip, and then the Soldier is doing a menacing model walk off of the car before he
And when Clint wakes up, one of us is going to have to tell him the news. Tell him that the unrequited love of his life was dead, and that he wasn’t coming back. Ever. I don’t want to be the one to tell him that, to tell him that another person he cares about is gone.
“You’ve gotta be shitting me,” I grumble, holstering my guns and reaching down to grab my whip. Another turn is coming up soon, and I crack my whip. I risk a glance behind me, turn drawing ever closer. “You better follow me around this corner, you stupid dinosaur,” I mutter.
"Invited," Zola replies simply. Steve glances at Natasha as I relax my grip on his bicep ever-so-slightly. The redhead has a look of sudden realization.
"Guys, we've got more incoming," Steve warns. I straighten up quickly, scooping my whip up from where I'd released the handle on the ground.
I walk forwards, careful steps, eyes glued to the creature’s. As I get closer, I can feel it unlike anything ever before. It’s pulsing and relentless and overwhelming and it makes me take a few steps back.
"And that's a bad thing how?" I steal a quick glance at our friends once again, before turning back to the archer.
“Just once,” I groan, tipping my head up to look at the ceiling, “can you tell us at least 50% of the plan?”
“Wait until Stark is in the smoothie and get out, Hinojosa!” Nick barks in my ear. “That’s an order!”
"After the war, SHIELD was founded, and I was recruited." Photos of Zola, then of a newspaper headline. "The new Hydra grew." A zoomed-in picture of Zola, then flashes of people, some of which I recognized from the SHIELD history course. "A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD for 70 years. Hydra has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war, and when history did not cooperate" —a flash of a metal arm with a red star— "history was changed."
"What's on this drive?" Steve demands. I glance down, shaking off the lingering wooziness. The drive that Nick had slipped me is plugged into the computer, and I can't remember seeing Nat do that.
Wtih a sharp, sudden flick of my wrist, I release all of the whip save the handle, snapping it through the air with a crack. And that's when it really comes to life, sizzling, buzzing and crackling with electricity. Reaching out slowly, almost trancelike, my free hand runs down the length of the whip that's covered in electricity, the energy sending warm tingles up my arm through the glove. I allow myself a brief moment to breathe in the comforting scent of ozone before snapping the whip again, deactivating it.
“I don’t know,” Nat admits. I’ve been hearing that an awful lot lately, and the fact that the redhead has said them makes me scared. Because the ex-Russian superspy isn’t exactly one to admit her faults out loud. “Whoever’s left.”
"Romanoff missed the rendezvous point, Cap," Rumlow says. "We have Barton, no Romanoff. He says that he was coming back and she disappeared on him. Hostiles are still in play."
Kat complains about not being able to see the dog as much as she’d like, but she drives out anyways and spends a good portion of her time off there with her girlfriend America.
"Don't do this to me, Nick," Natasha whispers. Her voice is thick and hoarse, almost like she was about to cry. Why shouldn't she? Her boss, her father figure, her guardian ever since she joined SHIELD, is dying on an operating table. Ever since Phil...
Then Steve leaps into the truck like some sort of pissed off, patriotic angel of honour, slamming his shield into Ultron’s arm. The robot doesn’t hesitate to fight back, retaliating with a blow that would have been devastating had it connected with flesh and bone instead of protective vibranium.
“We’ll get him back,” Nat says firmly, placing a hand on my shoulder. I nod shakily, hugging my arms to my chest as I follow the redhead inside. It’s a bit gloomy in true SHIELD fashion, with long hallways and numerous doors on either side. At some point, a door opens and a familiar brown-haired man joins Nat and me.
"Yeah," Natasha says. "It's gonna be fun." I lay down cover fire as I hear something heavy collide with metal—and then a speeder
“I may be a mortal, but that doesn’t mean that I’m pathetic,” I warn the ravenette. Then I turn on heel, stalking out the door. Right before I exit, though, I pause and look back. Loki’s eyes are still fixed on me. “I don’t beg for anyone’s scraps,” I add cooly. Then I sweep out of the room, jaw clenched.
“It’s good to meet you, Dr. Banner,” Stark is saying, shaking Banner’s hand. “Your work on the anti-electron collisions is unparalleled.” He waves a hand around vaguely. “And I’m a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.”
"You're a kid," Rogers insists heatedly. "You said it yourself, you're in college. You shouldn't be here." I shrug.
He recovers quickly, though, charging forward and grabbing my wrist with his metal hand before I can dance away, twisting it in order to make me drop the whip. He kicks it away, and it falls to the glass floor below. His grip is tightening, and I scream in pain. Yanking my hand up with all my strength, I wrench it out of his grasp at the cost of scraping entire patches of skin off of my wrist.
Ten minutes later, everyone is gathered in the penthouse of an absolutely totalled Stark Tower, weapons all aimed at Loki. The demigod raises his hands in surrender.
"Stark, are you seeing this?" Steve asks, turning. His voice brings me back, grounds me. I roll my shoulders cracking my whip and watch it light up with electricity.
Tony, of course, uses this as a perfect opportunity to grope Steve under the pretense of helping him to the medical wing.
“Hydra doesn’t like leaks,” Sitwell says, sitting in the back of Sam’s car, squished between Nat and me.
“Bags not it!” I manage to spit out, using my shoulder to shove against the metal underside of the helicarrier. “Stark, you’re the one completely encased in metal. All I’ve got is skinnies and a hoodie; Cap’s got spandex and the eternal spirit of freedom. You’re our best bet.”
"You kiss your mother with that mouth?" Steve gives me his Captain America glare, but it quickly turns uncertain.
My flight is shaky and irregular, and I barely manage to wobble my way to a nearby roof. I don't even have the strength to land, just kinda tumble to the ground, entire body protesting. As soon as I do, though, I force myself to look up at the portal. No Stark.
“Our number one priority is stopping Ultron,” Steve says. “We can’t let him get away with that vibranium. B-Clint, find a perch you can use to watch everything. We don’t know what he’s going to bring besides the Maximoffs. Comms are for emergency use only, since we know that he can hack into them. I’m trusting you to take anything we don’t see out. Natasha, watch him. We don’t want anything to try sneaking up on him if Ultron tries to take his hearing aids out.”
I can only gape at the growing hole in the sky—but not for long, because tiny specks moving at high speeds are suddenly zooming out of it in a black cloud.
"If you're already working in a secret office," Steve mutters, using one hand to pull the shelf away, "why do you need to hide the elevator?" There's a set of doors in front of us, and a keypad off to one side. Natasha holds her StarkPhone up to it, and numbers quickly pop up on the screen, which she types into the keypad. A light above it turns green, and the doors whoosh open.
I’m not stupid; what I did—cutting my skin open and letting the blood well up without a thought towards staunching the flow of red—doesn’t just vanish immediately. There are times, moments where I’ll feel the need to cut the pain away. That putting physical marks on myself might alleviate the burden that is anything but physical.
"I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs," the ex-Russian super spy murmurs, half to herself half to the rest of us. "What did you use? A stealth chute?"
"Who's sitting pretty in the most secure building in the world," Clint points out around a mouthful of egg.
The flash of memory is shoved aside as I hurry down the steps of the staircase. My safety goggles (an older pair I’d left behind last time I’d visited) bounce against my chest and hit me in the chin repeatedly, and I narrowly avoid running into Lila, who’s running about with a piece of paper covered in paint and crayon.
I salute the supersoldier jokingly before jogging towards the door that leads down into the belly of the ship.
“You better’ve gotten some coffee,” I say, ducking under another Chitauri and coming up to imple him with my reaper, stance wide as I drag another one off of its speeder as it whizzes by with my whip simultaneously.
“Civilians in our path,” Steve says without thinking to the passing silver-blue blur. Terrified faces disappear from the path of the train as silver-blue darts back and forth.
"I absorbed an explosion, Cap, I'm tired and hungry and sore," I reply matter-of-factly. The super soldier sighs.
I snort, cracking an egg. “You need it,” I say firmly. “If you didn’t have Steve, you’d waste away in that damn workshop.”
“Hey, there’s been a B&E at U-Gin Genetics Lab,” I say, quietly praying that it hasn’t been so long that my Korean is fucked. I gently thread my finger’s through Cho’s bloody one’s. “We have one serious injury, but she’s still conscious. There are” —I glance over my shoulder quickly— “four more injured, five unconscious. Again, we’re at the U-Gin Genetics Lab. Fifteenth floor. I can’t stay long, but I’m going to leave my phone here so that the injured can communicate with you until you get here.”
“Ultron got away, look out guys,” I say, pressing a hand to my ear. Pietro looks at me questioningly as he scrambles to his feet, and I wave him off as I push myself upright.
I’ve lost my grip on my whip, but I don’t particularly care as I lunge at the Soldier, hand gripping the metal of his arm. The thing whirs and clicks weakly, sputtering once or twice before going out. The sudden weight of the arm makes me grunt, but I don’t have much time to think about that because the Soldier is turning his entire body, and with it the arm and I’m flying through the air.
“If you see me” —I swing around the edge of the hole in the wall feet first, making contact with Ultron’s upper chest— “come find me.”
The chest piece of the Iron Man suit flies over and attaches to his back, but I barrel into Tony before it can cover his chest. The two of us slam into the computers. I push myself to my feet, but Tony is already vaulting over the railing separating the computers from the rest of the lab. He shoots two jets from his repulsor as another one attaches itself to his hand, the combined force of them sending Steve crashing through the glass wall and into the hallway on the other side.
I??? Am so??? Sorry??? I promise that I have been trying to keep on writing. After this chapter, I’m going to try and keep up a consistent publishing schedule. But one thing I can guarantee is that there is not going to be a massive, unannounced and unplanned hiatus like there was between chapters 13 and 14. (Even if this break between chapters was kinda turning into something similar.) So here’s another update, extra-long to make up for the hiatus.
I growl in frustration, eyes narrowing as I take the pressure off of the door, revealing the director of the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division. Or SHIELD, depending on whether not you have all day and the breath control to recite the full name.
Clint uses the hand that's not attached to the arm that's slung over my shoulder to scratch his neck.
Allowing a single, shuddering sigh to leave my lips, I set the clothes aside and pick up the coiled whip. For a moment that seems to stretch out forever, I stare at my old weapon that's gotten me through so much. It's been so long since I've held this in my hands, and it seems to thrum with energy. In its own way, it's welcoming me back, whispering static words only I can hear.
“By whom?” Tony has strolled over to collect his darts, and I make eye contact with Clint. Grinning, I mime throwing the dart in his hand.
“Shit,” I mutter. A STRIKE agent grips me by the back of the jacket, yanking me upright and pushing me onto one of the benches beside Steve. The supersoldier is staring down at his feet, blue eyes lost and almost scared.
"We've still got civilians trapped up here," Tony says. There's the sound of a distant explosion, and then another, closer one. Four speeders zip overhead, and I just barely catch a glance of a golden helmet in the sun and a flash of green.
In a move much too fast for my brain to register, Steve is flipping as the Winter Soldier twists his shield, falling back without it. The Soldier stares him down, blue eyes peering over the top of the shield. When the blonde charges, he throws the shield so hard that, when Steve dodges it, it embeds itself in the side of a truck.
More rapid-speed gunfire, probably from an automatic rifle. Natasha fires back. Tucking the handle of my whip under my armpit, I snap my goggles down over my face as gunfire from both sides ceases.
“What’s this?” Tony asks, sauntering over to Thor. The demigod slams the StarkPad into the genius’ chest, turning away. I hop slightly in attempt to look over his shoulder, floating a few inches off of the ground. The image on the StarkPad has me raising an eyebrow.
Clint’s face gets this pinched, pained look, but he doesn’t raise any objections. I know that he hates being what he sees as a liability to the team. It’s nothing he can help, but it’s definitely something he blames himself for. I want to say something, tell him that that’s not true, but the words get stuck in my throat as the archer nods.
Aka, take advantage of the free WiFi and play games while listening in on Steve and Nat on the other end of the store.
By the time Tony carries Bruce back to the Quinjet, everyone has shaken themselves of the lingering effects of the Maximoff’s mind warp. Clint had given them a rundown on what Tony was off doing, setting a somber mood all around. Bruce himself is huddled on the floor, blanket drawn around his shoulders but entire body shivering. His bare chest is gleaming with sweat, and my heart hurts for him.
Clint is propped up against Sam with a broken ankle and mild abrasions on his left arm from where he’d toppled off of the roof of another building while nobody was there to catch him. The other man is trying hard not to, but I can see his expression fighting valiantly to remain neutral.
“It’s powered by an arc reactor, self-sustaining energy source,” Banner explains. “That building will run itself for what, a year?”
“You know what, Romanoff?” Steve sighs, looking to the ceiling as if spreauesting divine interference. Nat lets her mouth form a full-on grin.
"STRIKE, you heard the Cap," Rumlow says, shutting down the screen he'd been briefing us on. "Gear up."
"Later," I say. "Right now we need to focus on the fact that iridium isn't the only thing Loki needs." The billionaire stares for a few moments more before turning away slowly in order to begin messing with the screens.
“If this is the kind of superpowers the people on your team have, I’m sure the world is safer than ever,” Laura deadpans, hands on her hips as she watches me scrub at the stubborn marks on the countertop.
"Uh, Steve is starting on breakfast if either of you want any," Sam says. I grit my teeth and muscle through the pain, because Jesus fucking Christ I am hungry and my stomach is screaming for attention.
“They don’t need to be protected,” Bruce says, suddenly and so quietly that I’m sure most of us have to double check to make sure he actually spoke. “They need to evolve,” the doctor adds, looking up at the room at large. “Ultron’s going to evolve.”
The wire catches around hi# feet, the other end coming back to me, which I grip in my other hand, pulling hard. The Soldier stumbles back into a car. Natasha’s legs are wrapped firmly around his neck, and she squeezes tighter as I adjust my grip on both ends of the whip. Before I can pull, though, the Soldier kicks one leg out with inhuman strength, whipping the end of the whip out of my hands while my grip is still loose.
“Fantastic,” I mutter, bringing my arms up to shield the rest of my face. I lean forwards a bit and bend my legs, before unfurling and crashing out the window. “Care to point me in the right direction?”
The flight from Seoul over to New York is long, but not necessarily gruelling. I catch up on hours of missed sleep despite Pietro and Wanda huddled in one corner of the stolen
"A), because he signed up for this, and B), because we don't exactly have a bottomless supply of blonde supersoldiers from the 1940's," Natasha snarks.
"An actual apology that isn't riddled with underhanded comments," I say. "That's some monumental shit right there." There's something more he wants to tell us, but he needs someone else to do it.
“Put on the suit,” Rogers challenges. Stark opens his mouth, but nobody ever finds out what he’s going to say, because at that moment, a distant explosion rocks the entire ship. I’m thrown off of my feet, but manage to stabilize myself in the air. The rest of the assembled team in the lab (Banner, Stark, Rogers, Thor, Nick and Nat), however, aren’t that lucky; part of the ceiling comes crashing down, filling the air with dust and disorienting me even more.
And then the sky booms and lighnting arcs out of the sky to electocute a group of advancing Chitauri. Thor lands a few seconds later with an earth-shattering boom. It's calm for a few moments, and the five of us use that time to regroup.
"Lynx, watch your six!" Clint warns me. I barely dive out of the way before four speeders bank in a wide arc in order to face me again. I crack my whip, deactivating it before unsheathing my reapers.
“Oh, we will,” the other Maximoff twin says patronisingly. Her eyes are rimmed with a dark eyeshadow and the hard glint to them reminds me of a different set of determined eyes. Green ones set against caramel skin.
“Then the Insight helicarriers scratch people off the list,” the Hydra agent says, words coming out in an almost-whine. “A few million at a time.”
Clint salutes, theralding his arm through mine and dragging me off. Neither of us have any sort of rifle on us with which to shoot, but the particular building we'd be sniping from today, there was already a bundle of weapons packed there for us, courtesy of Natasha.
“Not exactly a limousine,” I comment as Rollins shoves me in. Steve, Nat, Sam and Clint are already there, watched by three other SHIELD agents. “I would’ve thought that Captain America warranted cushioned seats at the very least.” Rollins slams the doors shut, plunging the back into semi-darkness. Someone knocks on the side of the van twice, and then the ground lurches underneath me.
“Considering I’m cranky, fighting things that aren't supposed to exist outside of movies and need caffeine stat, then yeah, this is the perfect time,” I reply dryly, kicking the Chitauri off of my blade and leaping into the air to intercept another.
“You’re gonna make it through,” I say, gesturing for Steve to leave. “I’m gonna call someone to help you and your people, m’kay? You’re not gonna fucking die.”
"We shall," I mutter darkly, just as the first Chitauri reaches me. Ducking under its gun, I fling my left arm out to the side so that my reaper takes out its legs. Kicking the gun away, I slam the blade into its chest to kill it completely. Heavy footsteps on my six, and I roll out of the way just as a purple laser is fired. I jump to my feet, and the Chitauri doesn't wait for me to come to it, it just dashes towards me. I stand my ground until its a foot away—then I jump to the side, bringing down my reapers so that they cut through the aliens arm. Pirouetting, I impale its back, right where the (human) heart is.
