They eat their food in silence. Steve dares to say he's never felt so out of place, so much urge to fill the silence with words than right now – and Tony, who always knows something to say, who so expertly fills time and space with the spoken word and knows to bend it to his will and forge a blade with it like nobody else he's ever known, doesn't say anything.
The other man hums in agreement. "You did," he says, sounding thoughtful. Then, he points at what Tony knows is his bruised jaw with a gloved finger. "That got anythin' to do with it, perchance? Runnin' away from somethin', maybe?"
is not havin’ to carry a damn corpse off this mountain. You need to take it easy, you’re in withdrawal.”
He forces himself to redirect his attention to Steve, whose hands now move up Tony's stomach, a sure, familiar touch that Tony leans into despite himself. There's nothing sexual about it, not really, even though he definitely qualifies as stark naked and his nipples are hard but that's only because it's too cold in here and he should've asked FRIDAY to turn the heat up ten minutes ago.
Said boyfriend squeezes his dick to the point of discomfort–ow, what's up with that–effectively jolting him back to the current moment in time. Tony's erection hasn't flagged at all, which is a small miracle considering his brain is occupied with everything but his carnal desires right now.
He doesn't seem to be in pain when he goes. His last moments are, despite the tragedy of his sacrifice, rather peaceful.
Had he witnessed it, Clint would boast and then jest about having quite the ear for the truth. Of course, Bruce would not share any of it with the archer; as much as the man loved to gossip and meant no harm, this pet interest of his was not of as much importance as another's right to privacy.
Tony has to hold onto Steve’s shoulder for support when the other man moves them closer to the mirror, close enough that Tony’s knees are near the edge of the mattress and he feels it dip beneath them. If he thought his own reflection was a turn-off before, this close-up sure is teaching him to be grateful for small mercies. Note to past self for when he finally cracks time-travel:
Strangely, that behavior changes Steve’s perspective of him, and for the better: it makes him human, shows that there’s more here than just a tightly coiled ball of anger, snark and defiance.
Tony startles, winces, and realizes it's because he's achingly hard underneath two layers of thick, cotton breeches.
The relief that overtakes him when Steve nudges his legs apart and then slides back into place without the littlest resistance is almost better than another orgasm would be. It feels right. Steve belongs with Tony–it’s a natural fact, like Newton’s laws or the sky being blue. There’s no argument to be made against it. They just are.
Steve presses its one button and the man’s whole body convulses instantaneously, choking him in his mockery. While powerful, the range on it is short. Steve appreciates Stark's decision to ridicule the tool instead of deciding on the smart move, which would be to flee. Someone who grows content with his superiority and underestimates Hi-dra’s potential rightfully pays the price.
Inside, he finds an old, torn-up uniform that can only be Steve’s, a StarkPhone he's hard pressed to admit is years ahead of anything SI is putting out right now, a journal and a strange, watch-like device that displays the date 3-21-2012.
Steve feels himself recoil in surprise or maybe even shock. Just an inch or so – it shouldn't be too noticeable, but Stark's pointedly lifted eyebrow speaks volumes. He might be a liar, but damn if he isn't perceptive. It's almost funny; for a moment, Steve was almost convinced that there had to be something more to this man than just his unapologetic defiance.
It’s funny, because he wasn’t even in heat then. Couldn’t have been, not yet anyway. A few days more and he would’ve been able to tell, but even if it had been closer–the chances of them conceiving should’ve been virtually non-existent. Should’ve, could’ve, would’ve. Even when the odds are in
Steve leaned over him, blanketing his body, and reached down to pull the ring off his straining cock, wet from the tip to the base and bouncing between his legs. He'd been aware it would be over soon after Tony would be free to reach his climax, but the speed at which it happened was still astounding. One moment, Tony was clawing at the sheets, bucking with a fervor to meet every single of Steve's thrusts, and the next–
Outside the city gates of King's Landing, the King's golden banners flapped in the wind, the jet-black, great eagle sat in their middle seemingly spreading its wings to take flight.
Making quick work of it, Tony slathers some shaving cream on and grabs the smaller razor from his side of the sink, opting to get the fine-tuning done outside in the big bedroom mirror. It's a lot easier to spot the wayward hairs when he gets a closer look without the bathroom sink between him and the mirror.
When the other doesn't respond, he keeps going, searching his pockets for the bundle of dollar notes. "Whiskey, maybe gin. A few bottles to get us through. It's a little dreary at times, up there, and– we'd appreciate it."
i'm pleasantly surprised about how well this is being received. just a fair warning that the last two additions might take a while longer because i'll write them from scratch to stay (somewhat lol) in line with canon.
"Gee, I don't know, maybe because I sound like I've got a screw loose? I mean, what, your doppelgänger invading our home life? You gotta admit that’s pretty out there. Hence I figured, benefit of the doubt. So what if the bruises look like handprints? Nothing else happened and I wrote it off as a weird coincidence. And it was, it was just that. Until…"
The Lord's response was to scowl and then avert his gaze, bashful. He cleared his throat and sucked in a hissing breath as Bruce pulled the bandages free.
"They would–" he paused, Adam's apple bobbing once more. Sir Steven moved in a way that elicited a sharp intake of breath from the other man. "They would call me the
While Tony slowly rises to his feet and wipes the worst of the grime into a well-used towel, his daughter is already speeding past him toward the house. Steve's gaze trails after the girl making her way over the lawn at astounding velocity – she really
More importantly, he'll have to leave to get it cleaned and he doesn't trust the people in HQ with Tony; his latest attempt at escape would've succeeded were it not for Steve's untimely return.
Not even a Lord as well-liked as Lord Stark would have all the people's good will in a matter where old, misplaced sentiments were as indisputable as time itself.
Only there is no initial surge; it's a low, constant thrum in the back of his head, and Tony feels himself tremble with it where he's still standing in the middle of camp, like abandoned.
Tony cracks his eye open to steal a glance at the mirror. Steve’s curled over him to be able to make kissing easier on Tony’s neck (because of course he’d consider this), forcing him to lean forward. The hand on his erection is pumping him with the clear intent to grant his long-awaited happy ending, and the upward-hitch of Steve’s hips is incrementally growing higher as he’s chasing his own release.
Pepper said. That's easy enough. The scent neutralizer makes him feel all sorts of gross, but he’ll have to put up with it one way or another. No way he can say ‘no’ after Pepper’s gone all out to get him some convincing fake booze to carry around a glass of for show.
He can't imagine the agony the man must've been in until the shock set in. This right here, it's more than just laying down on a wire. No, Tony took the wire and the barbs and pulled it apart with bare hands.
Fury sees the punch coming, of course. He dodges it with little effort, and in the next moment, a group of heavily armored agents enters the office and wrestles him out into the hallway.
Steve resists sheepishly clearing his throat and thanks Tony instead. Right. Because he's grateful for Tony's hospitality, and the fact that Tony puts up with him despite his likeness being a constant reminder of his dead husband. He isn't sure whether Tony has noticed his lingering glances, but if he did, he's been very generous in letting the uncalled-for behavior slide.
Luckily, nobody's around when he finds the fancy locker box he's supposed to place the Tesseract back into.
Steve doesn’t pretend there’s any use in hiding his grief. Despite his leader-shtick, Nat was essentially the person who kept the remainders of the Avengers (for the most part) together and occupied in the recent years. And now, after stepping up and holding on through the worst of it, she wouldn’t even get to see the fruits of her labor.
“Let me help you,” Coulson said, gestured toward the bag as well. At the bend of the action, the sternum strap of Tony’s backpack snapped open suddenly, shone the light of the cerulean insertion into Coulson’s view. He stared at it.
And at that, Tony was caught. Howard hadn’t explained properly the grounds for the lawsuit’s dismissal—he rarely explained anything to Tony in complete—but he never expected it to end with Clint still in attendance, and a student trailing him in his defence.
“We’ve never expressed that,” Coulson rebutted. “We attend to our divisions based on our proposed budget. Financing is released in sectors, and we have a timeline as to what departments acquire what—"
as properly)! I'm really excited for the rest of the characters to become regulars too. Chapters are getting a bit longer each update, but I'm sure they'll become more consistent in size once all the introductions are out of the way.
. No, he didn’t,” Peter muttered. Bruce pouted in a quiet acceptance, and went to turn to proceed walking.
, from a year ago…” Tony shook his head. "I never meant to put you in any shit, Bruce. I hope you know that.”
“Biology,” Tony said. Then, he rambled. “I do know quite a bit about the topic, don’t get me wrong. I just prefer the… mechanical side of things, you know? That’s my science. That’s the Stark thing.” He shook his head into a distant ponder. “And first it was Steve, coming to me with an organic problem. A
Peter twisted his sleeves around, removed his stare from the expectant senior standing across from him. In reality, it was either to tell him at that moment in time—rip the bandaid off with immediacy—or string him along until eventual decline of interest, or, really, never. “
“Because I got myself into some trouble.” Tony gave a considering shrug. “And, because, all things happen for a reason.”
Against the rain that persisted for the remainder of the days, he had managed to avoid Clint with great efficiency. It was too great, almost, like he had managed to vanish conveniently. Maybe, after everything, it became instinctual for Tony to keep his distance, and going through something as traumatic as he did repelled him from the cause without effort or warrant.
“This better be the result of a small nuclear explosion,” Fury said loudly, managed to shroud the hint of rage behind his austere voice, "or whoever’s in here is getting their asses
Peter then took some deep breaths, waited a bit. He nodded shakily, perked himself up at a sudden whim of small recovery. “Can… Can we do it now?” he asked. "I’m getting my second wind. I don’t know for how long, though.”
The offensive push of atmosphere at each step towards Tony strengthened the vignette around his vision. He blinked quickly, his respiration rapid. “Steve?” Tony called to him.
The nurses, who obscured the passing lights of the hospital’s ceiling as they spoke him awake, tried to hook his fleeting consciousness as they wheeled him to immediate medical help.
"With what measures, then?” Tony almost laughed into it. "Regular counselling? A buddy?” At the silence that emerged on Coulson’s end, he pointed his gaze. “Oh, that’s fun. A
. The stringy thing that slithered through the grass and back under him like, like...” Tony turned around, words beneath him, and furrowed a brow. He waved a thinking finger onto another instance. “The tiny,
Tony and Steve watched immediately the rope of white lattice emerge from his wrist—like an endless, fibrous vine—and attach itself to the roof embellishment in target. It weakened Peter instantaneously, and according to his own expectation. In all his enervation, Peter swung forward in collapse, let out a low shriek as he, once again, lost sight of his absconding pupils to his head’s swallow. Steve and Tony reached out in reflex, but Peter dropped promptly off the edge of the roof, drew in his webbing without so much as an attempt in the task he had set out to do. He fell flat on the grass beneath him, luck thwarting his collision with nearby cobblestone.
Instead, like a telekinetic ghoul, he extended his right arm, and protruding from the orange wristband came the white lattice. It immediately stopped the ball in its flight, held it there for a moment as Peter let out an uneasy cry beneath a pained face and slightly-upturned pupils. And then, almost instantaneously, the webbed limb retracted into his wrist, dropped the golden weight onto the floor with a heavy wallop swallowed by the thin rug. Peter regained his normality, stumbled backwards. He was breathing stronger than before, eyebrows slanted in fright, bewilderment, strain.
Tony looked at him a second more. The honest worst Howard could do was hang up. Or yell. And then it would be in Tony’s choice to end the call if needed. Put the power in
it happen without your control.” Steve hesitated. “And then, when you hit the peak of the anger, you completely—"
Jarvis paused again, this time in further deliberation. And, then, came a clearing of the throat. “One moment.”
He really didn’t have to, but Steve did it anyway. He fidgeted open one of his books, took a short pencil out of his pocket.
Tony played around adjusting something, squinted at a thought that came through his mind. He didn’t look at the other boy, though he ruminated. “What about you?”
The sound of the entrance creak signified promptly Fury and Steve’s return. They appeared at the bifold arch opening into the facility, the latter holding with two fists a large, handled first aid kit decayed from decades prior. Fury pointed at Peter, who was still lingering around the table. “
Peter didn’t duck, or vacate the path of the ball. He didn’t grab it, or hold his hands up in reflex to dim the impact. He didn’t even let it hit him.
Tony and Steve had stood up now, and were lingering behind Peter in examination of it all. There was something
from fishing for alumni, which would definitely be to Tony’s dismay if his repute didn’t already guarantee him a spot.
Tony’s face screwed almost in offence. He found himself pointing to his chest. The face of his pacer shone bluer than ever. “Do you think
And that’s when, from the figure, came a short, sharp lament, distanced by the steal of cool air. The student’s frame folded and fell promptly forward, into the grass and out of view.
It had been a week or so since Tony first met Steve. Nothing about the encounter had been particularly inspiring, except in that of creating a plan to filch in and out of classes promptly, quietly, and return to his dorm for the solitude Principal Coulson promised him not. There had been dry greetings—mainly on Tony’s part, as a result of his dismissiveness—and a couple more directives spewed when Steve had inevitably gotten lost. But it was
“Be polite. And don’t mention my name until he’s in full agreement. He won’t be able to back out once he’s said yes.” Tony tipped his head in consideration, thought back to a past time. “He’s morally-subservient like that."
Tony eyed him a moment. He was a jock-type, a large frame squeezed into a shirt and tight sweater, hair normal. An athletic boy also, almost
Fury reached into a box and pulled out a stack of stocky books, let them hit the clear area of the bench with a thud of dust. He seemed unaffected by the wave of grime, and merely waved away the particles that emerged from the activity.
Steve wandered further from the congestion of the campus, looked up at the silver sky and predicted another late-day of rain. He had worn a grey sweater vest that day, and, at that point, almost dissolved into his overhead as he walked. The wind put his hair aloft.
The weather had barely cleared for the day, left droplets of slow-falling drizzle against the facility’s gold-bordered windows, and Tony believed this was the perfect atmosphere to work in. His ideal atmosphere also happened to be among the mess of thought, in which he had actualised his thinking and tests on various sheets of loose paper and had them scattered everywhere. His tools and instruments were sporadically laid, and his wiring was out and wreathed around the tables. He had other aspects of his mess around, like bolts and screws, food wrappers and books, small devices he had found around the room and dragged out to ask Dr. Fury about using later. This afternoon, like those preceding it, Tony was already wired and ready to go with his testing. He stood amidst the cluttered tables, humming.
“And what use would that be?” He asked, screwed his face up. "You gotta put him in a situation that’s
“Hold on,” Tony said, brought his hands up. He meditated. “Are you one of the many wealthy sons of whom I’ve rejected friendship over the years?”
The choral director, sporting that familiar faculty-reserved look of annoyance, turned to Tony. “A reason, Mr. Stark?”
situation you got going on.” Tony returned his hands to his pockets, made the whole situation seem nonchalant. “You gonna tell me what that thing is?”
The student was dressed with the formality of a solider: a jacket of dark cargo resembling uniformity, and sharpness. He had hair placed in perfect side part, held Coulson in a hard frown that seemed permanent of his eyes. At the statement, he squinted. It was a flicker towards something stronger, something much deeper than whatever unsettle he already evoked at surface, and Coulson saw this immediately.
Tony had been watching from afar Dr. Fury transfer boxes from the school’s main division to the place for a few hours and decided, after a few more of the same journey, that he wasn’t going to let off the task anytime in the near future. After the black coat disappeared into the facility for a considerable moment, broke its own pattern of back and forth, Tony decided to follow down overgrown cobblestone leading to the entrance and inside.
When he heard the entry then slam shut, he couldn’t attribute such an action to Fury’s ingress. Tony looked behind him, puzzled as to whom it may be.
“Well, we don’t see much of him either.” Coulson looked up again. “And we’ve been expecting his participation in sport, community service, the
The former sighed, stared at his old friend. “Looks like Peter's heartfelt plea failed to penetrate,” he begun, “and so, now, I’m offering monetary bribes. To whom should I make out the cheque? The
beneath the unsettled array of dark tables, lay Steve considerably unconscious. Tony stared at him wide, pondered quickly his vitality as his own chest rose and fell atop the accelerated rhythm of his heart. If he wasn’t mistaken, a laser of such force was near fatal at contact. Tony took timid steps towards his sprawled, uniformed body.
” Then, he pondered out into the distance. “Kinda thinking now that, maybe, that stare was only ever reserved for me.”
things,” Bruce began. “And most of his conjectures are… unorthodox, to say the least. I mean, he’s a Stark; they’re ingenious people. Their thoughts—their
Coulson breathed in through the nose, prepared his answer. Something told Tony he wouldn’t favour what he was about to hear. “Well, we’re more focused on
Jarvis examined the blue circle glowing dimly from underneath Tony’s shirt. “You’re expecting a few people to, if you will,
And, perfectly, the chorus sounding from within the chapel froze, left the two in silence. That, barren of voice, was Peter’s part. This was his cue. And all things did, indeed, happen for a reason.
friend. “Things have changed, Bruce.” He looked down at his chest, felt atop the cotton of his shirt and gripped lightly the bright face. He gestured to it with his eyes, made sure Bruce could see it. “You know Barton did this to me?”
Watching him, Steve exhaled and put his sheet down. He stood up resolutely, pushed the stool out from under him. That was it for the day. “I’m getting supper.”
The student, who Tony found that afternoon, was not a freshman, but a sophomore. He took a startling number of AP classes, including Spanish and History, and was the most busy, busy,
“I figured,” Steve said, and there was a plaguing embarrassment to the sigh that followed it. Then, he thought of the worse. “Did I—?”
“Explains a lot, like why he’s so weak.” Bruce looked at the sample. "Why it's been hurting him, too.”
A month or so prior, Clint Barton left Tony for dead on the concrete of their school. He had delivered the hit to him fresh, put his foot straight in the balloon of Tony's stomach and
It was impractical—and highly eroding of all dignities—but sleuthing was what had to be done to find what he needed. And he got just that.
“Take the compliment,” Tony said. Then he spun to sit properly, outstretched his arms casually on the bleacher preceding him. "How’d you get good?”
Tony then remembered, fleetingly, the debriefing from surgeons that was horrendously non-penetrative in all his haze. He remembered the masked faces, boxed in by two mattes of drooping eyelids, almost as though the whole thing was cinematic and unbelievable. And then slowly, slowly,
Also, tags will begin to change once they become a bit more relevant, and that includes new characters. :)
, maybe, to provide a place for inheritors committing routine blasphemy (like the rich regularly did) to repent with the hopes of forgiveness, and their share of the company back. Considering the theatre had been under indefinite reconstruction since Tony was in hospital, it also happened to be the school’s main assembling point. In that moment, however, a small group of students were gathered in raised rows at the forefront of the room, and were being conducted into a smooth, harmonic ensemble piece. It echoed sweetly and wholly throughout the large, dome-like interior.
,”Tony started, pointed out towards the school’s remote infrastructure, "or jumping down from the top of that spire over there."
“I’m right here,” he felt was appropriate to say; to reassure him. And it was true. Tony wasn’t alone, or grieved with the task of swallowing his father’s vexation with sole face. Steve was sitting there, going no where, and was awaiting promptly his courage in the matter. He bore no judgement; he didn’t know him well enough to form any.
different types of balls and a stick) seemed untouched by a multitude of activities they refused to partake in. Tony knew some aspect of sporting occurred in his school, but a large majority of students preferred to remain prim and allow their sluggish distinction to exercise them instead. Nevertheless, the grass in that region burned almost lime, presented itself between two goal posts and a set of wooden bleachers of ten or so rows. In all his years at the school, Tony had never sat on them once.
pacer. However, Tony understood that such a contraption didn’t require a whole heap of potential to work. There was a large quantity of excess power he detected running. An
Peter nodded. And then Tony thought of something convenient, but unusual. He crossed his arms, eyed Peter like he was a circuit in his physics class: simple-looking, but complex in their solving.
The facility in which Dr. Fury traversed boxes that afternoon was a Victorian standalone. It sat ardently harmonious with the rest of the archaic campus, and Tony was barely surprised at the structure's camouflage. He noticed, preceding it, the lake—a shallow, leaden expanse of weeds and still water—which framed the building’s foreground like two looming hands.
Howls. One, in the beginning, but a few more are quick to emerge in way of answer. It has to be a small group at the least. Tony almost falls over himself as he wades through the snow back to the fire, but there's no need for the rush – Rogers is already up and alert as if he's never been asleep at all (and boy, does Tony not want to entertain that idea). Both of his hands have a firm grip on the hunting rifle, and it's clear he means to end this once and for all.
Tony clears his throat. It's still raw, and his next inhale is deeper and by extent also more painful.
get to decide what is and isn't fair to me?" he asks, voice increasing in volume with every word spoken, "I wanted you gone, yes, for including this reason, but the circumstances have changed. It's too late. You can't just up and leave now and tell me it's for my own
The utter confusion must show in his face, because Tony quirks a lopsided smile and clasps his hands before walking to a table at the center of the room. He taps the surface and a blank hologram pops up, drenching their surroundings in blue.
The girl jumps up as he approaches, both her and Steve's drawing clutched in hand. "Look at what we made!"
It first comes to his attention a few days after the fact, when Rogers is out riding down the mountain to get another week’s supplies and feed for the animals. As always, Tony uses the opportunity to refill his flask in peace; he still has the booze stored under the couch cushions and he has every intention of keeping its location hidden from the other man. Guy's self-righteous enough he would probably think pouring it all down the drain would mean doing Tony a favor in some fucked-up, roundabout way. Lift the curse of inebriety from him, like an angel descending from the skies (one that is also much too easy on the eyes to be allowed anywhere near him).
Steve flops onto his back next to him. After a moment, he rolls to his side to face him. Tony turns his head, reaching out to tenderly brush away the darker strands of hair sticking to the blond's forehead.
"So, how is Steven faring these days?" James asked, failing to keep the meaningful undertone from coloring his voice.
He looks old. Tony knows he's starting down the path where he could get his picture put next to the Oxford Dictionary entry for
What can he say? He likes his showers hot; scaldingly so, according to Steve, whom he spent the last shared shower with practicing a lot less sexy-time and a lot more wrestling for the temperature control than anticipated. That whole thing transpired notwithstanding the fact that FRIDAY could meddle with the settings just as well and with less effort – which she ended up doing, if only to force a compromise onto them. She averaged out their desired water temperatures and therefore rendered their increasingly slippery and hazardous shower spar useless.
He knows Steve’s willpower is wearing thin, can feel it in the harsher, faster thrust of the fingers in him and the way his breathing picks up. “I’m done, c’mon, it’s been so long, Steve–”
Romanoff then looks at Steve. He expects her to fully disregard the situation at hand, but ends up surprised once more when she says, "That answers why there's no decent nanotech to be found anywhere."
Sir James Rhodes was knighted by Lord Howard at eighteen, still young and green despite his prowess and claims to the contrary.
Generously slicked, he resumes his work. There’s little resistance, now, only the occasional spasm of Tony’s muscles as he scissors him open with two and then three fingers. He can tell Tony’s growing impatient, breathing harshly as he shoves his ass back into Steve’s hand and essentially fucks himself on Steve’s fingers. His eyes roll into the back of his head when Steve intentionally hits his prostate twice in a row (and then again when the keening sound that action elicits from Tony’s mouth is too sweet not to provoke another time).
Steve’s almost relieved when Tony nods in understanding. If none of this fazes him, their timelines might not be all that different after all.
His practiced nonchalance is nothing in the face of Steve, who so often reads him like a book in ways that make Tony want to scowl at and kiss him at the same time (and he has done both on a variety of occasions), now squints at his suspiciously neutral expression in the mirror–and promptly begins to look much too smug for Tony's liking.
The hymns written about this war did not do justice to the sacrifices made, but songs seldom spoke of horror and blood.
Ah, there was the core of the issue. Bruce remembered it, that impressive souvenir Lord Rhodes had brought with him a fortnight ago from last year's travels to the Frost Lands when he'd helped negotiate a peace treaty.
keep within the speed limit. Little does it know the man behind the wheel can, in fact, afford a speeding ticket or two (hundred).
Looking for leverage, Tony goes for Steve's thighs that are still encircling him and tries to heave himself completely into Steve's lap. Despite the bewildered stare Tony feels boring into him, Steve, bless his soul, doesn't question the change of pace. He lifts Tony up by the waist and closes his legs so Tony can settle on top of him, knees on either side.
sleeve, but you get the gist. Plus, he can be awfully efficient when he wants to be, and since he likes taking long showers anyway, he might as well use the opportunity for some added fun.
With a start, Tony registers the sound he's making. A low hum, the weak imitation of a long-drawn moan sitting in the back of his throat. He's been at it for a while if Steve's grin is anything to go by.
As fast as it's come, the exhilaration of his orgasm is swept away. Steve pulls out, ignoring the gush of what he knows is more than his own spend, tucks himself away and is clinical in his way of dressing Stark back up. A faint, satisfied something thrums in the back of his head as he sees that he wasn't alone in his climax, but he doesn't comment on the fluid dripping from Stark's stomach onto the ground below.
All the puzzle pieces come together the moment Steve rips the shield off his arm and breaks into a run toward the edge of the cliff. The shield comes clattering down on the floor in front of the Red Skull, who pays it no mind but instead watches the man who once foiled his plans jump to certain death with mild interest.
Blood rushes in Steve's ears, tuning out their combined heavy breathing, the slap of skin and the creaks of wood underneath them. Under the many layers he wears, he's sweating. Stark's moans vibrate against his skin and send pleasant shivers down his spine, again and again until – that's when he's done for.
"People already seem to believe that you are a bastard I fathered and have been made to raise in my home, which is, as we know, a perverse abomination of the truth. But while I detest the way some choose to speak about you, I have to admit these whispers are a welcome counterweight to a number of other, popular rumors."
Despite all that though, the devastating truth remains: Tony doesn’t have anything to do. At all. Nothing. Nada. Nichts. Niente.
As their bodies meet, joined so tightly you couldn't fit a sheet of paper between them, Steve lets them catch their breath for a second. He places fleeting pecks across Tony’s shoulders, ghosts of kisses as tender as he’s ever been, the beard a magnificent contrast to the softness of his lips. (Tomorrow, he’s going to want that between his thighs. No self-respecting man passes up some good beard burn.)
He thinks he's doing a pretty good job at hiding the uncalled-for hurt in his voice when he answers, "No, I do. I understand, Tony. It's only right to put your daughter first. Probably wouldn't be a good call to stay here anyway, after… everything."
Steve planned to check in on Pepper and Morgan again sometime, but not straight away; he doesn't intend to come off as pushy or intrusive. Then again, he has no way of knowing if he was sent back to the present, or even
The other man has it in him to lift an eyebrow, amused as well as sceptical. As one of his hands traces the inside of Tony's thigh and disappears behind his balls, the hint of a grin plays at his lips.
Tony cards his fingers through the hair at the back of his skull. Strangely enough, it's too short to play with like he usually does. And come to think of it, the shape of it's different at the front too.
Steve, who kneels by his side and knocks his bloodied knuckles against Tony's chest and looks at him with glassy, reverent eyes. "It's in there, isn't it? There always was too much, more than even the universe could handle. So, one day, it decided you had to go. Can you imagine?"
“I can distract them while you run,” Tony says, voice steely and mouth a hard line that almost doesn’t tremble. He’s always been selfless and stupidly reckless in such a way that comes with that kind of selflessness. Steve has enough of that himself, and he doesn’t even consider the ludicrous offer.
She shoves the sheets of paper into his hands, and Tony grabs both and regards them in turn, silence dragging longer as he studies them and Maria shifts on her feet in anticipation of his reaction.
Sometimes, ghostly shadows of unforgotten memories dance across Rogers' face when he's staring into the embers of their dying fire, and it makes Tony feel a little bit better, a little bit less alone, knowing that he's not the only one running from his demons.
After a brief struggle, his legs fold in on themselves and he slides down until the floor greets him. The floor, he finds, is still there. It shouldn’t be much of a surprise–rock bottom is an old friend that has never failed to welcome him with open arms.
me. Please stop choosing to put yourself in what you know is harm's way. You may not care for your own well-being, but I do."
Tony has revisited this riddle countless times, wanting to solve it, thinking he was going to go mad with the inability to and wished any of it would just
and knows they're alright. They'll miss their friend Steve once in a while, but they cope and heal, together.
Steve nods. “I’ll see what we can do about that,” he says, and points at Stark’s makeshift workstation in front of the operations room when he’s regarded with an inquisitive gaze. “Keep going.”
Tony doesn’t respond, already distracted by the numerous holograms JARVIS has pulled up for him. “What if we just… missed something,” he mutters, sifting through the data. In his peripheral vision, he sees Steve still lounging on the sofa, but he’s put the sketchpad away and his arms are crossed over his chest. Tense.
Many had speculated the eccentric Lord Stark would not care for the sentiments and customs of fellow highborn folk and announce his betrothal to Ms. Potts soon enough – yet, nothing of the sort had occurred.
Steve doesn't miss a beat and begins to slowly  guide them across the room. Having to balance Tony's weight on top of his own, he starts out a little awkward until he figures out the right rhythm. Tony nuzzles into his neck and allows himself to close his eyes. For a while, there's silence between them but for the woman's soft voice sounding from the speakers.
Shouldn't he be indifferent to these punishments of the flesh? After all, he's done worse things to himself dozens of times before, carved out meat and bone to replace it with iron and circuitry. What is a violation of bodily autonomy in comparison, really? Isn't this raw, animal desire of Steve's more natural than the whir of Stark's mechanical parts as he weakly pushes against him in protest?
At the crusted blood sticking to the corner of his mouth, at the long eyelashes brushing his cheeks and the lack of them on the damaged side of his face, at the gray in his hair and the faded laugh lines around his eyes.
gets stuck in his throat regardless; Tony isn't the one who wants him here, and by extension, he probably doesn't want his thanks either.
Anthony, of course, claimed that he did not need to be escorted by half a dozen men who could do many other, much more useful things with the time they now wasted, but James chose not to listen. He was the Captain of Guard, and he would not take unnecessary risks.
"If I ever– made you feel less, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, and I never would," Steve says firmly, once again cutting through Tony's internal ramblings.
that measures his harmonies, because Tony isn't playing along anymore. They can stop pretending to perform together when what they are is worlds, decades and a pile of bodies apart.
Steve spends some time searching for a dustpan and then cleans up the mess of broken glass on the floor he caused in his surprise. After, he makes himself comfortable in the living room while he waits and anxiously watches the clock as five, ten, fifteen minutes tick by.
Steve lifts an eyebrow in question but shakes his head slowly. He remembers Tony destroying the organisation (AIM?) that brought Extremis into being (without calling for the Avengers’ help, because despite everything, the guy was almost as much of a stubborn bastard as he is) but as far as Steve knows, he never did experiment with the stuff other than getting it out of Pepper’s system.
Tony didn’t move, or register the action, and remained within his thinking all lost and remote and hazy. Steve narrowed his eyes at him.
And before Tony could continue with what ever else he felt like (which was something along the lines of
For a moment, Tony was caught in a memory that divulged hard against his tongue. Seeing Steve—his wide frame, the possibilities and advantages of his force—and knowing he was capable of such behaviour, he swallowed.
they are.” Tony stopped at an old red cabinet and opened slowly its glass. Inside were shelves of medallions and awards, ancient mementos of rusted bronze and silver. He settled a hand on a golden football, placed unmoved for supposed years on a small stand, which the school had won back when they displayed sporting variety; the tiny plaque beneath it mentioned a final that had occurred close to a decade ago. Tony took hold of the award, and noticed his arm strain a second. It was definitely a bit heavier than the regular football.
That following afternoon, Bruce had concluded, finally, his work in the lab. There was a joy in his short step, and always was when a long-hauled experiment came to a close.He had just finished putting his equipment back in storage and was loading his book bag, humming lightly, when the lab’s door sounded entrance behind him. Bruce perked attention immediately, and expected his teacher. He was eager to show his results, after all. If he didn’t have to wait until class the next day to do so, then the afternoon was chilling even better than he thought.
“Save it, Coulson.” Tony’s eyes seared, twitched at his thoughts, and he dimmed his voice. "He almost
“Yeah,” Tony agreed distantly. He outreached his hand behind him, pointed it towards Steve. "Pass me that screwdriver, will you?”
Ignoring Tony, the director looked back at Peter. His eyes were wide in reluctance, head almost shaking in a silent
Peter walked up to him, stood by the side of the bench, and cleared messily his throat. The student in question continued to write for a moment, before glancing up.

flattering in the beginning. Kind of odd, too, but still… yeah…” He furrowed his expression, shook his head. “Uh, I… I can’t have you following me around anymore.”
“It was reminiscence,” Jarvis said earnestly. “Just reminding ourselves of the good and the bad of you. The good, mainly.” He shifted. "Well, I suppose everything’s a good memory when—"
, and Tony eyed him at the movement. They both remained outwardly silent for a minute or so (as they usually did whenever they were both together in the facility), but Tony's brain was seemingly ticking and brewing beneath the guise of prodding and twisting things. Steve could sense it, gave a scrutinising gaze over a held-up sheet. Tony bounced his leg for a moment more, looked elsewhere, before speaking.
Tony squeezed his face to the side, indicated to Steve that he was in anticipation. After a brief period, a stern voice pushed immediately through the small phone and into Tony’s ear, awaking in him a flash of tensity.
in case. Tony stood, hands still in pockets, expecting Peter’s speech first. He ensured he was at least two metres from Tony, had his left arm held reassuringly with his right palm, and wore a grey sweater vest atop a long school shirt covering awkwardly thick orange wristbands beneath both sleeves. Tony noticed this, and quirked a brow.
teenager Tony had ever regretted following around. The sheer number of extracurriculars the boy attended was almost disgusting: Chorus, Academic Decathlon
At the emergence of his father’s voice, Tony felt with great strength cornered, though he was nowhere near the edge of the room. “Come on, Howard. Not even a
“You wouldn’t happen to know where Algebra Two is?” He asked, trying for Tony’s attention. "It’s my next class.”
Steve stood in the wide arch that led to the breadth of Tony’s workspace. He kept his eyes on Tony, said nothing, moved nothing. Tony squinted in confusion at his stasis, turned around properly to face Steve's still figure behind him.
“Simple.” Tony pointed at a tapered roof embellishment beneath them, and the three of them looked down. “See that? Sturdy enough surface. Web onto it, jump down off the roof, and stop before touching the ground. Exercise both evils at the same time.”
Bruce turned around to him with wide eyes. He took immediately the glass from Peter’s fragile grasp, examined it oddly. Then, he furrowed his eyebrows.
athletic for the lack of sporting variety that plagued the brawn attending their school with all that energy and no one to tackle. If that was the case, why he had transferred—if not just to play bodyguard—was an instant anomaly. Maybe it was a parent’s decision on which he had no say. Maybe it wasn’t. Maybe Tony didn’t really care. “I’m guessing you’re the new kid.”
“Once he comes back,” Tony clarified. He waited a bit, dithered in his mind, and then narrowed his eyes in reluctant resolution. Peter waited, also. He felt almost urged to ask who, but Tony eventually said the name. It came out sad and admiral and reminiscent, all at once. “
“None other,” Tony said. And then Bruce flashed confusion, and so he explained further. “It’s a pacemaker. Fancy, I know.”
Dr. Fury stood serious, intimidating. Void of colour, he was, in which his entire demeanour was tenebrous. Sliced through the left eye, Tony noticed of him, was a scar that pierced through an iced cornea, and fit the sunken scowl of his face well. If he asked, Tony was sure it told an interesting story.
wasn’t. Steve was marvelling within whatever false recollection he decided fit him best, and Tony knew it.
The thing about Tony having no friends was that he didn’t want any in the first place. After his incident with Clint, that hadn’t changed.
The car window’s tint rose to separate Jarvis and himself. Then, in the black of its glass was immediately reflected a figure, standing atop the entrance steps. The individual's hands were joined together in waiting, a grey suit donned. It was boxed and terrible, and definitely only something a member of
In the lab, white and clean and almost empty (save for a few students working overtime on individual projects, like himself), Bruce was tiredly losing interest in his work. He had his cheek resting in the palm of his propped up arm, watched a distilling apparatus drop slowly liquid into a flask, and that just so happened to be a most uneventful pastime. It was quiet and clinical. It was boring.
It was his formality that hid Jarvis' sentiment well, mainly in protection of his own dignity. He had to keep his composure for the sake of his job, but Tony could see he worried; eyebrows all folded together, aged face melting in anxiety.
trellis, it retracted up and into a point of origin near the bend of his wrist swallowed by the grass. Then, it disappeared. The boy didn’t move.
Tony believed the facility resembled a home more so than the other infrastructure, with a portion of its first floor glassed completely as though sporting an attached greenhouse. How it related to the advancement of engineering was dichotomous and ironic, with all the reddish brick, manorial embellishments, snaked ivy on its external. But the facility—which had evidently been built for living or non-scientific ventures—stood and was to stay, regardless of what Tony thought of it. He was thankful for its existence, nevertheless.
“Senior. Dark hair, shiny waves. Kinda ruffled.” Tony gestured an unkempt hairstyle with his hands. “Trust me, you’ll feel this looming sense of crestfallen scrutiny the minute you lock eyes. Almost like you’ve messed up before you even knew what on
His school had never been one for technology. The sheer antiquity of the place—regardless of the calibre of families attached—seemed as though it would deter the likes of the
Steve raised an eyebrow in unbelief, held his paper still. His eyes looked around. “I wouldn’t know.”
His mother Maria, who gripped his wired fingers with her soft, sorry hands, let the vagueness of rose perfume drift off her cheek and onto his.
Tony skirted around the tables, took immediately to examining the apparatuses and all their height with quick, educated glances. It had been a minute since Howard had let him frolic among the labs back at home—been a minute since he could work on
Tony had been lazed on the fifth or so bleacher, legs raised, laid on his side in recline. A gaggle of students in jerseys ran around beneath him in pursuit of a purple ball, hollering uniform call-outs to their teammates. It was a nice day, no rain at that moment, and if Tony wasn’t placed awkwardly out in the open for a reason he’d have just done it to bask in the better weather. Plus, he used to watch the Super Bowl with Howard. This was
At that, Tony turned slowly, confusedly, back around to his workstation. Steve sighed through his nose, jumped at the need to keep Tony’s focus. At this rate, he’d be getting nothing out of him.
“Sorry, Peter,” Bruce said, put the instrument into a small vial containing already an unrecognisable liquid. “I’m sure that last one hurt.”
“And a lot of people do. You should know this by now.” Then, he paused again. “Is this the only reason you called?”
“Where’d you get the, uh, sandwich from?” Peter asked. Steve narrowed his eyes at the squashed bread between Tony’s grasp.
in this area, but…” Peter let him gawk at it a moment—a hesitant reach of the neck over in examination—and then rolled the wristband back atop his lower joint, brought his sleeves down with a quick jut. “Yeah.”
Tony kept his stare on his unidentified peer and wondered if he should alert the nurses that a freshman had passed out from the sheer fluster of the school.
“Something ‘bout the state of these damn books tells me the rest of your school didn’t know either.” Fury examined it a moment more, placed it back on the small tower from which he retrieved it. He then rested an elbow on the height of the stack, looked expectantly at Tony. “You gonna tell me why you’re here?”
The sequence next was fast, unanticipated. Tony felt as though he was roughly grabbed, thrown back in time a month or so, but not quite.
act, he swept the mess of the closest surface to him onto the ground, let measuring equipment, contraptions, lunch, a ray tube or so of Fury’s, aggressively clamour against the checkered flooring. Paper unsafe from Steve’s brutality flew around in commotion. Tony flinched.
—don’t make sense.” He huffed. “But the regular person needs some sort of explanation for peace of mind, even if it doesn’t reveal the entire truth of their genius. It’s practice. Gets people off your back."
Steve rubbed his mouth. Both himself and Tony were in great thought, wondered deeply their relation and just
. Something told Peter that—beneath trying to prove himself—joining his multitude of extracurriculars was to forge connections, and as many as he could to distract from their quality. But Peter knew all the nervous laughing and disguised enjoyment and depthless conversations would let up in finality. He wished he had something a bit more.
Tony looked over him and down at the students, who had stopped in a small gather to stare up at him for interrupting their game, eyes slim. Coach Hill stood, arms crossed and glaring expectantly. “Aw,
Tony Stark has always been a fool, but he has a feeling this man might just be able to bring out the very worst of it in him.
Server maintenance has an annoying habit of bringing to mind how much his A.I. isn't just all glib repartees to counter his snark. A weekend is what it takes these days, on account of JARVIS having become a little chunky over the years. No shame in that, but he’s definitely due for a defrag again. That should shave off at least a few petabytes.
But they need him, too. They need Tony. (And God, Steve does, but that’s of little importance compared to what’s at stake.)
at the front-desk worker politely bidding them goodbye a minor incident), Tony drives them home in the Audi.
you want to protect him, I get it. But if Tony Stark has orchestrated a secret experiment to kidnap Captain America from another dimension and is now trying to pass off his appearance as a mere coincidence, I need to know."
Except Steve has other plans, because when Tony sits up and starts working at the buttons of his shirt, the other man takes hold of both his wrists and decidedly peels his fingers off. He leans over him as he brings their hands up next to Tony's head, pressing them into the mattress alongside his body.
Two days later, they finally come to rest: the wounded are taken care of, the stones returned to opposite sides of the universe, and Tony offers up the mansion as a temporary homebase. The estate isn’t doing much but collecting dust–he could imagine turning it into proper headquarters with time. It probably says something that he keeps giving his homes to the Avengers, but then–and that thought gives him a stunned little pause when he catches it–whom is a home for if not your family?
Yet, Lord Stark had led armies to war, and his heart had not ceased beating. To some, he was the Man of Iron, to others he was Lord Stark, and to a precious few, he was simply Anthony.
Rogers' hand is big and calloused and wraps around his own warm like a full-body embrace, and it takes Tony longer to let go than it should.
The man’s an outcast first-class, sure, and a past version of Steve might’ve not been able to look past that one characteristic. A past him (and he doesn’t like to admit to that fact) would’ve maybe done what Stone expected them to do, what he
Steve chuckles and leans back, hand in his hair. He almost wants to cut in with a sneering comment along the lines of
Anthony was glaring daggers at Sir Steven but did not respond, opting to allow his body previously propped up on his forearms fall back onto the cot, energy reserves leaving him through a shuddering exhale. With a grimace accentuating the lines in his face and sweat slicking his hair to his forehead, he looked even worse for wear.
In the later hours, when Tony has officially lost count of the many times he's asked for a refill, a man pushing his way into the space of the saloon catches his eye. Despite what people seem to believe, he does keep an eye on the comings and goings; at least until a point from which on he's too out of it to care.
, he's an equally famed and ruthless gang leader running from the law, Tony ends up… not doing that. Perhaps the outlaw story is too much of a fitting allegory, only difference being that he hasn't committed murders in the typical sense and is now running from himself and his guilt.
They're so close to succeeding, so close to walking away from this planet as one–but no plan can account for blind rage. (Tony thinks he's heard that one before.)
” Tony mutters a string of profanities under his breath and considering the way Maria's eyes widen, Steve is pretty sure he's not the only one who's heard them. Which is strange, because the sound is faint even in
Or maybe he is being too optimistic; maybe he won’t get a grave, maybe they’ll never find his body or Rogers will decide to leave him here because Tony didn’t listen and thus sealed his own fate, and this is what he deserves. (And in a twisted, roundabout way, it’ll still be the booze that'll have killed him.)
Iron Man, Tony Stark isn't the first super-powered name on the call sheet anymore, not since the Avengers have made a considerable amount of recruits which are highly capable and also don't have an assortment of other things on their plate. Like, say, running the R&D department of the country's leading company in tech and many things more and in the meantime also making sure to provide the Avengers on active duty with a constant stream of updates and upgrades to their equipment.
Sudden, wet heat around his half-hard dick has him sucking in a lungful of air through his teeth. The only circumstance that's keeping him from rutting into Steve's mouth is the man's hands firmly keeping his hips pinned to the mattress.
Tony tilts his head in Steve's direction just so and breathes in deeply through his nose. It's like he's–scenting. He exhales a quiet "Huh, would you look at that," and Steve realizes that that is precisely what he's been doing.
Steve's already given most of his soul to this cause, sawing off bits and pieces of himself to earn them all one more day of freedom, one more day of being. Might as well offer up whatever's left, too.
Tony freezes where he's standing when the howls re-emerge, closer this time. Much closer. Close enough his brain suddenly suspects all the shadows around him to turn into the shapes of wolves any given moment. Tony looks around him, rotating in place frantically, but even the light he's carrying doesn't do much against the dark of night.
"Eh, you know," he answers, clearing his throat to hide the strain in his voice, "nothing too specific. Watching the people that find their way into this god-forsaken place is interesting enough. Makes you wonder what made them come here, where they came from, where they're going. Good way to pass time."
It felt uncharacteristic for the Lord to go to these lengths to hold a formal renomination ceremony for the Captain of Guard, seeing as he typically refused to take part in all dated civility simply out of spite.
They spent many a day in one another's presence, Anthony's head appearing in the window of the wheelhouse more often than not to greet the swordsman riding next to him with some jest or other. Even during the evenings, they would be caught speaking in hushed voices in the light of the fire.
Shamefaced and squirming because he’s just realizing the full scope of what living here really is like. They’d certainly have their own, private space for this sort of thing in first, Steve is aware. Well, not here. Welcome to reality.
Present Tony sits there for a long second, and finally, breathes out an exhale and rises from the swivel chair. In Steve's hurry to get out of his field of vision and not betray that he's been accidentally eavesdropping on him, he kicks over the bucket of spare parts at his feet – because of course he does. He told Tony this would happen.
His gaze wandered to Steven, who everyone knew was a miserable liar. Clearly, he suspected that this outing had not been approved of by the resident steward. Sometimes, the boy was more perceptive than he ought to be.
In the beginning, it overwhelms him, this airy light-heartedness he isn't used to from anyone. It dies, somehow, somewhere, when you grow older – but this young Miss Stark certainly still has it, and lives it with her whole being.
matter) message make way for silence as quick as they came. Both of them are long past those early stages of being fazed at one another's nudity, so that's not it.
“Okay,” Tony breathes through a sigh. “Should I show you to your room? It’s a little cramped, but it should do for the night.”
His early departure comes with a price, because despite the long journey, he waits another two hours or so until Cannon's men show up. Tony snaps out of his half-sleep with a jerk when he hears the voices of riders approaching, and straightens hurriedly. Without anything else to do, he's been dozing off leaning against Butterfingers' warm shape for some time.
"Please," Stark suddenly grinds out, hoarse and utterly wretched. Steve's eyes snap back up. He hasn't witnessed the man plead with anyone for anything – not even Bain as she left him here, all but throwing him to the sharks. And yet… "I need, I– just, the one time. That's it. I'll never ask you for anything, but, this once. I can be– I can be good,
As if following a command, Steve looks down at where they're connected. Where he's driving relentlessly in and out of Tony’s body, marking him and assuring him that he
It’s then that Steve decides to let go, as Tony’s bucking into the warm embrace of his fingers with every stroke and grumbling in frustration when his hand abandons his erection to trail back up his chest. Tony’s hand closes around his wrist, attempting to guide him back to his dick that curves up against his stomach, red and leaking.
He's lowered his voice to a whisper, wanting to disturb the other inhabitants in the wagon as little as possible. It isn't about privacy – there's no privacy here. Whatever you're doing, whenever you're doing it, people are going to know. At some point you either stop caring or you go insane. Everything he can hope to do now is keep the noise down and not wake everyone in the vicinity. (No sleep is bad for morale.)
The young knight handed the letter over to Anthony, who inspected the King’s golden sigil, now broken, and quickly skimmed the contents of the message.
Steve sighs, fondly exasperated, misconceiving his tentative denial as a joke. “I’m honored your dreams are so vivid when I’m not around, but you promised me to be more careful.”
When Bruce initially found himself under Anthony's regency, the first unwritten law of the Iron Castle soon rang loud and clear: do not ask Lord Stark for what reason the Man of Iron, Slayer of Thanos the Tyrant and Protector of the Kingdom of Shields needs to be escorted by the highest knight (and only the highest knight) in his guard on his rides through his very own lands.
Steve's pace grows more confident after a while, long pulls and deep pushes that leave Tony breathless. He’s close already–a little harder and a hand on his cock might tip him over the edge. Tony considers telling him to go slow, doesn't want it to be over so soon, but then Steve grips his hips in earnest and starts pulling Tony back onto him in time with his more urgent thrusts and the thought evaporates into nothing. Instead of words everything that comes out of him are small, needy noises that keep rising in pitch, Steve wringing his pleasure out of him with each movement.
"Did she not say she would not breathe a word of it? I understand those were her exact words. Believe me, Carol Danvers is on our side in matters of the heart."
Rogers nodded, missing the man's disappointment or maybe blatantly ignoring it, and Tony said, "Tony Carbonell, it's a pleasure," putting just enough ice in his voice to communicate the fact that it very much wasn't. The ranger grunted and shook his hand ever so tightly, unbothered by his presence as he went on to ramble about this and that and how his knee was giving him too much trouble or he would've gone up there himself.
Steve arrives at the ground floor when he sees it in the corner of his eye. There’s a flurry of movement on top of the stairs, but the moment he whips around to inspect it further, everything appears unchanged.
Beneath him, the other man shudders, finally reaching his climax at the sensation of Steve tying them together.
Nothing can distract him from the miserable condition of his existence anymore. Every waking minute is filled with the echoes of thoughts about one of two things: water or salvation. Sometimes, he dreads both. What if he lives? What if he dies? What if it doesn’t make a difference either way?
Tony looks almost curious now, urging him to go on as he leans back in his chair and settles in to listen. So, Steve clears his throat and gets ready to talk.
No, Tony can't blind anyone anymore. Those days are over. He just wants– he wants someone to stay without having to blind them, stupid as it sounds. And although Steve has been that someone for those last, blissful years, it doesn't mean he can't still slip through Tony's fingers. It happened before, it can happen again.
you were to me, it was already too late. I didn’t–do this because I wanted you for myself, if that’s what you think, it’s just that–we needed to be together for you to make it."
He doesn't get to react beyond a nod and a tight smile before she's already turned her back to him and enters the van at the very front of the convoy, the last person to arrive. They leave, after that.
Hell, it's a wonder they even got anybody on the phone. With half of humanity returning through the snap of a finger, you'd think chaos would ensue in a similar way it did when they disappeared. Not that it isn't chaotic, but it seems not everyone is so out of their mind with joy to let work be for a day or two.
He can’t say whether it’s true or what the real reason could be; only that that on the floor right there, in front of Bain’s stilettoed feet, covered in nothing but a flimsy piece of cloth with fear in his eyes but a snarl on his face and teeth bared in warning, that’s an omega alright.
Tony can’t hold back anymore and doesn’t bother to. He lets the torrent swallow him, drowns in Steve and his need for him and moans out a guttural, ugly noise that seems to do it for Steve. Feeling him spill inside chases another prickling surge of arousal through Tony. His own jizz splashes against the counter and onto himself, and Steve keeps fucking him through his own climax until there's nothing left to chase.
He tries not to let the fact shake him that, while they’ve set course for planet Earth, the exact circumstances of their arrival are up in the air. Neither of them has an answer to the
There was a time when regaining Tony’s trust seemed utopian. Steve still isn’t sure if he’s deserving of it.
“Like I said, it’s not much, but make yourself at home,” Tony says, walking over to the bed to swipe his palm over the surface of the nightstand. More dust swirls through the room as he does, testifying just how scarcely this part of the house receives guests.
If Tony dislikes how quickly she's taken to Steve, he doesn't show it. Maybe for his daughter's sake. She hasn't made it apparent that any of it weighs on her, this sudden involvement of his in their lives; children often cope differently with loss, so while it isn't surprising, it still makes Steve fear he might be doing something wrong for the whole duration of his time with them.
She flops onto the sofa next to him and turns the sheets of paper in her hand around for him to see. Steve squints – advanced high school algebra, he'd say.
The process itself is evidently harder, if only in consequence of Tony lacking a second arm. Usually it would be routine maintenance, but with the way things are, it becomes yet another task he has to re-learn the same as he needed to re-learn how to change clothes and prepare food. This might be the most difficult task yet, and he struggles accordingly: clamps the contraption between his knees to hold it steady, pulls at wires with his teeth, screws a nut in with his mouth.
"God damn you, Rogers," he grits through his teeth, and before he's even made a conscious decision, he is up and his feet are carrying him toward the cliff.
Anthony wound satin-clad arms around his neck and smiled, carding his fingers through the strands of hair at the back of Steven's skull.
"So good, Tony," Steve huffs in-between shallow breaths. "You're so tight, feels perfect. You're so beautiful, sweetheart, I could shoot my load just looking at you."
"That alright?" Steve asks quietly. Quiet and–worried? Tony squints at him in the mirror, his vision blurry. It's with a rather large portion of dread that Tony touches a hand to his face, more heat crawling up his neck as soon as he feels his fingers coming away wet.
A hand on his bicep startles Steve, and he whips around to come face to face with Bucky, who squeezes his arm in silent support and says
"These are both very cool. I'm impressed." Steve sees a familiar strain around Tony's lips, yet everything he does is pull his daughter in with one hand and press a gentle kiss to the crown of her head. "There's my little artist, huh? You haven't drawn anything for me in months, glad the creative streak's back."
but Steve ignored it in favor of leaning down and pouring his all into a kiss filled with deep affection that was for no one to feel but Tony.
close to resigning myself to the fact that this was gonna be another one of Stark's antics, but I've been pleasantly surprised for the very first time."
Steve's mouth twists into a lopsided smile. Not long after hearing those words, he's stopped needing sleep for the most part. If he presents his case convincingly enough, Pierce might even allow Stark to stick around his quarters during those nights he spends with both eyes open–preferring insomnia over another dream.
"Gonna make you take it, Tony." The words come out in time with his movements, hard and in increments, again and again, his hips pistoning back and forth. "'m gonna give you all of me and you're going to take it."
Pulling back his arm and folding it over his chest, Tony looks at him with an open expression. He pulls his brows upward expectantly, and Steve gets the gist. Alright; he can play that game. He thinks for a moment, and then,
Steve retreats, disappears. Someone else comes back. He isn't different, not in any physical way that matters. Except where before there was the Mediterranean sea in his eyes there's now the antarctic–he might have crawled out of that block of ice but he’s never gotten warm again.
damn time for him, too. Too long to pretend the sight that greets him when he pulls away the blanket-curtain that shields Stark from vision and looks at him as he lies there doesn't affect him.
When they part, Tony chases after Steve's lips and huffs an exaggerated, annoyed breath when he catches himself. To distract from the slip-up, he sniffs and says, “So much for making it home for dinner.”
Anyway, he’s going to stick to the more nebulous term of self-proclaimed visionary and leave the whole oracle shtick to Strange (Sorcerer Supreme, Master of the Mystic Arts and Keeper of the Time Stone, or however he referred to himself on a normal weekday. It’s a mouthful for sure. And the guy had the audacity to comment on
The man jumps and lunges for the metal staircase against the exterior of the building, his robotic arm bending at an odd angle as it curls around the banister to pull him up. Steve remains in relentless pursuit, taking the steps four at a time.
Steve forces himself not to look away as he brings down the knife. The overcoming of the urge to avert his eyes is almost a physical pain, but he knows he doesn’t have the right to speak of pain right now.
It takes a few deep breaths to calm his elevated heart rate, although the impromptu breathing exercise makes him all the more aware of Stark's scent that's now brimming with potency as everybody else's gradually dissipates. The stink of fear and trepidation has lessened as well, although it's still undoubtedly there.
Tony stares, befuddled, but Rogers returns to his work and doesn't utter another word, even after Tony has gone on a tirade highlighting all the very obvious reasons why leaving him in this condition is a bad idea.
Not that the idea of Tony taking his prick hadn't been arousing from day one. He had entertained the thought and got off on it often enough, but since their sex life was everything but unsatisfactory as it was, he had made peace with the fact that this simply was the one thing they wouldn't get to do.
In an ironic twist of fate, Thanos' armies disintegrate, the ugly hounds and beasts with blood tainting their chaps turning to dust one by one. Steve breath catches as he comes to a standstill in the midst of death and destruction. He believes, for the first time in a long time, in a just universe again. It's a freeing feeling.
Too bad for the big man in front. Because Stark, well, he's – a former first-class, and sometimes he complains about the most trivial of things like how he craves coffee, misses music, and would kill for a clean towel (Steve refrains from commenting that he'll get to do that soon enough) – damn fucking witty, and resourceful, and when Steve accidentally calls him ‘genius' in a roundabout way, Stark’s gloating makes him almost want to take the words back. But then he doesn’t.
He tells Steve as much, who snorts and then asks, a little apprehensively, if that’s an actual example from his past. Tony only winks at him, and that’s enough to spur him into action–maybe to prove that he can make Tony feel that way all by himself. That little possessive streak he gets sometimes is more attractive than it has any right to be.
Not when Steve's smiling at him like that, tender and eyes crinkling as he carefully studies Tony's shape before him. He's also tracing a line up and down Tony's side, over a small scar by his abdomen and up to his ribs. And it would be all nice and dandy just like this if Steve wasn't hard and his length
Surprisingly enough, it takes the rest of the compound longer to catch on than anticipated. Most of them are Fury’s lot after all, so Tony expected to be found out sooner.
It's a question he does neither need nor want an answer to, but asks regardless. Hope is the perpetrator: he hopes hearing it will wake him from this nightmare the same way you’ll shoot awake shortly before sleep because your body’s confused equilibrioception tricks you into thinking you’re falling from a high ledge.
The building's layout is unlike any he's used to from his days at SHIELD – then again, they've never had major headquarters in NYC, either. It's curious that this is one of the few things that would be different. Steve follows the agent's lead up an elevator and through a variety of corridors; he memorizes the way they came, just in case.
When he's pried the plates from Tony's neck, he removes the pieces from his arm bit by bit. The metal is singed and the shine of red and gold gone; Steve cuts his fingers more times than one as he hurries through the process. He wants to get them off quick as possible, like the moment the ugly blackened layer over Tony's skin is gone the memory will disappear as well.
He can't bring himself to look at Steve. There's a knot lodged in his throat that's making it hard to breathe. With every second Steve doesn't answer, his palms get progressively sweatier.
Flinching and curling away from a perceived threat is a humiliating instinct to succumb to. Shameful. Enough for his neck to burn hot and Ross to pick up on it. Which is worse.
The Steve who belongs in this universe; who's died like his Tony has. (It's not that he needs to remind himself of that fact. He thinks of it every day)
No, for the first time, he was entirely, truly alone – and although that isn't quite true now, the threat of it always lingers in the back of his head, waiting to make its presence known whenever he catches a glimpse of it on these occasions.
With the next sign of no, James felt at a loss. Only… He hesitated, taking in the picture of his friend's clenched jaw and downcast eyes. There was a possibility that revealing this to him would only serve to upset him more, but he could not simply leave it at just that. Anthony was visibly hurting, and he would be damned if he did not try to ascertain what was troubling him with all his might.
And erupt it does, because Ross gets wind of it. Tony is almost alarmingly calm when they request a meeting. It’s only ever been a matter of time, and he’s been reeking of
Tony sounded a choked-off groan somewhere up top, and Steve redirected his attention to rub a hand down his side, coming over to stroke up his heaving back. "You're so gorgeous like this, Tony," he told him, voice coarse. "My fella, doing so well. 'm so proud of you."
Steve increased the pace steadily, not getting all too brave and (re)collecting himself when he felt the want to, and he soon built up a satisfying rhythm, long, deep strokes. They coaxed one wanton
How in hell he’s ended up the recipient of this man’s unending affection may be an enigma, but that doesn’t mean he can’t enjoy what's being given. Tony pillows his head on his crossed arms and settles in for a longer session. Steve’s lips linger on the scarred center of his chest for a moment longer than they did on any of the other spots, and it feels as though his skin retains some of their warmth when they detach from him.
Fairy dust; right. He is in a gay relationship, so societal stereotypes dictate that he should be able to manage at least something vaguely glitter-related. He can be damn glamorous if he wants to. Maybe he'll put a glitter dispenser into the suit and then whenever he's doubting his role in this relationship or angry at himself for letting himself go or just generally disgruntled about his momentary state of being – maybe then he can shoot a cloud of pretend fairy dust and it'll all be gone just like–
The last shreds of daylight are gone and Tony’s hands are stiff from the cold when everything is finally over with and they're ready to retreat inside. The animals are taken care of and secured under the shelter, the equipment stored away, and there’s enough firewood inside to get them through the night.
Peter took another few, rapid breaths until his breathing finally slowed. Then, he nodded quickly. "Yes, yes. Where are you going?"
Steve pauses at the sight, then huffs an almost unintelligible sound of surprise when he realizes what feels strange about that particular movement. He's positive he's never seen the Tony he knew do anything like this. There's something endearing about it. Which Steve doesn't think about; Steve thinks about Tony's words. Because Tony's speaking. Right now, his mouth is moving, and Steve should be paying attention–
"Oh, child," he laughed, but taught her anyway. Later, she would know that it was because he, too, craved for someone to listen to his words and wisdoms.
The dying sun throws colors ranging from pale yellow to deep orange over the untouched blankets of white, and the occasional pine tree is clad with snow. In the distance, a small hut at the side of the mountain (the peak of which towers far above the plateau still and encircles the area with three others of its kind) oversees the planes.
A sigh of not-quite-relief escapes him as he slides the door close. Steve knows better than to give into that false sense of security; there are still actions to be taken before they get to sit back and wait for the herd to move on. Together, they push shelves and cupboards up against the door, the kind of large, steel furniture you’d expect to find in a place such as this. It couldn’t be more ideal.
Tony opened his mouth, about to answer, when someone piped in from the other side of the bed. "Yup," a voice that definitely belonged to a post-coital Clint said. "Ten out of ten. Would participate again. Five stars on Yelp."
The further he descended into the lower floors of the castle, the colder the air became. Moss entwined the old stone here, moisture making it appear slick and lustrous in the faint light of the odd candle lit in a rusty holder long ago hammered into the rock.
Still, the physician had no use for bystanders whose only purpose was to further trouble his patients, whatever the reason or however they may relate to one another.
He merely took one last look at Lord Rhodes with a spark of mischievous humor in his eyes and pointed them both to seats close to the head of the table, at which roast turkey and various side dishes were already being served.
There wasn’t much feeling in the act itself. They both were afraid what it would turn into if they let emotions surface. Tony preferred it like this: quick and desperate, something they both needed, one of the rare occasions they found themselves on the same page these days. Before the matter took a turn for the worse, before Lagos, they'd been with each other anytime their cramped schedules allowed for it–after going close to three weeks without, neither of them was too proud to deny themselves.
"So… I called. They're getting here tomorrow, and, uh, nobody said, but I bet you Fury will be coming to see this with his own eye. Thought you might wanna know, fair warning and all."
The brunet’s expression transforms into one of feigned suffering, and then he says, “I haven't had to utter that sentence in about four decades, but– I don't know two of the nine words that just came out of your mouth."
Well, that settles it. Steve blows out a breath, contemplating how and when to begin his quick rundown of the events that transpired back in 2015. He decides to work them off chronologically, starting with Strucker, the twins and the scepter, and Tony surprisingly nods along for most of it and comments that yes, they had that happen as well.
Someone’s stomach grumbles at the approximate volume of an approaching freight train, and Tony is promptly reminded that them not going out for dinner also meant missing out on a scheduled intake of sustenance, which has gone far from unnoticed by Steve’s metabolism–especially considering their most recent activities.
Tony, in an annoying and borderline sadistic way. He chooses to deny himself instant pleasure for something so small and insignificant, because he thinks it might go some way toward helping Tony.
Tony turns his head to smash their lips together. He relishes in the way Steve licks into his mouth, gentle and slow like he rarely is when they’re together like this. It’s almost as though he’s trying to find their rhythm again, cautious, probing with care.
"This is a waste," she remarks casually as she stands, pushing her chair in. She's openly observing Tony now, shaking and keening as he continuously fails to lift himself on Steve's cock fast enough to build a rhythm. All of Tony's focus is on the task and hand; he either doesn't notice her eyes on him or has stopped caring.
Then, he looks up and faces Rogers. “I don’t,” he says, and that’s that. It can’t be worse than the bed he’s been sleeping in for the last few weeks; he’s sure the springs must have left visible imprints in his skin.
Pepper leads them back to the house, where the rest of the Stark family is gathered. Steve isn't sure if it's his place to put a comforting hand on her shoulder, so he leaves it be.
He figures Tony will take some time with his daughter, so he walks up to the holograms still floating there and studies the information given for some time.
Between the pillars of the archway, a gust of sand grains carried by the winds beginning to pick up velocity transforms into a vortex of white and blinding light. With a flash, the movement ceases, sand raining onto the ground and revealing the shape of a… woman.
Steve's had a lot of time to think these past days, watching over Tony and pleading with a higher deity that doesn't exist for his recovery. He has come to plenty of realizations–but his burgeoning understanding that his motivations aren't always noble doesn't mean anything to Tony, who doesn't have the privilege to mull over the philosophical intricacies of his rescue.
There's no time to be wasted, Steve knows that. Carol has a spark in her eyes that tells him she'll pounce at him in the next five seconds, and Bucky is already on the move, only a few feet separating them.
Steve obliges by the request that is really an order, but not for the reasons Tony thinks. He takes the rope they’ll usually use for climbing and other related purposes and ties him to the shelf at the back wall that’s bolted to the floor–perfect for this use. The counterspace next to it is far from sterile, but beggars can’t be choosers. They’ve exhausted every single other option, and Steve’s going to take his chances; better a slim chance than none at all.
Mostly for the sake of a self-aware joke, he then makes a show of spreading his legs and dragging his hands down the insides of his thighs like he's this ripe, young thing ready for the taking–which, as established, he is the polar opposite of. He didn't account for the sense of accomplishment that overtakes him when Steve's throat bobs and his pupils dilate to the point the black is visible from Tony's spot on the bed.
He examined his peer in question, who darted through his opposition with close possession of the ball. For all the spreading himself thin he did, he was exceptional at the sport. A
He panted, collapsed back onto the bench preceding him, let his hands hold him upright as he attempted to decipher
Steve walked around the nearest table, put his hands in his pockets. “They, uh, said you’d be here.”
He got up and ran as good as he could; without fear or tumult, and just merely to escape the situation. He understood it.
He stared earnestly, atop the paper, at the student sitting across from him. Under an odd shadow, by choice of the light from the window, he was almost hidden in a present darkness.
Steve breathed in, looked back up to him with despairing, ashamed eyes. He uttered a few words that he wished he couldn’t articulate, wished he lied through with every syllable. “I… get violent."
Tony continued to rummage his belongings, without speech, until he pulled out a dark green, feather-edged book.
him), and so in negotiation he was not to go anywhere for that moment. While Fury had taken Steve to retrieve a first aid kit from the front office, Peter remained under Tony’s
Tony comically scrunched up his nose, whipped around his hand as if sensing aroma. “The stench of disingenuity, for some reason, is hindering my ability to come to a decision.”
appeared clearer than the one in front of Tony, and quickly selected a small tool that seemed adequate. He reached over, handed it to him.
And now Bruce was perplexed, dreaming. He had been monitoring his oil distillation project for that past week without so much as a single interruption. How was it that, unpredicted, a sophomore lured him out of his focus, brought him elsewhere, and showed him something so
Steve began to approach him. He walked stolid, heavy steps towards Tony, eyes devoted chillingly to him and nothing else in the room. Tony watched him, saw a placid hostility in his face, and felt the dumbbell of his heart drop slowly to his feet. The situation was so familiar, far too familiar.
“Did Coulson say, specifically, what he needed me for?” Bruce asked, and had stopped to turn around. Peter almost didn’t notice this in all his worrying, and halted himself immediately to prevent a collision.
“Well, I’m not calling him again,” Tony said bluntly. He tossed his phone onto a soft nest of loose sheets towards the end of the table. “You can forget that.”
He quirked his eyebrow at Coulson for a moment. Then, he flattened it promptly to emphasise the gesture.
Steve breathed in, planted his hands in his pockets, looked around embarrassingly. New wasn’t something the students around him seemed to ever be. Sure, they had new cars, new toys, uniforms that remained stately new no matter the years that went by. But being
At that, a dull but sudden pain throbbed in Steve’s head. He winced silently, put a hand to his right temple.
Fury dropped the box he held from the height of his clutch. Tony saw it hit the tiling with a dull thud, heard its insides rattle.
Tony quickly gripped his bag again from the ground, stood straight, tried his hardest with one hand to re-clip the strap. Especially atop the bulbous shape of his heart, there was no use. “Dammit.”
Behind the hill, the drizzle of the mid afternoon slimed on Peter's face. He was already embalmed with the sweat of struggle, and the mix of rain water and the chill of the day wasn’t a helpful addition. He looked down at his right wrist, which was bare and hived before his sweater’s pushed-up sleeve.
"I'm sorry, but these are too difficult for me. You're too smart," he says, smiling to make the news a little less bad.
Then, there was Steve and him, and if Tony thought there was one thing more unlikely than a wormhole opening up and an alien army coming down upon New York, this was, without any last shred of doubt, it.
There's a second of silence during which the man narrows his eyes at him, and Tony inwardly sighs in resignation; maybe he's combined the clues, or will reject the request out of spite. As a last resort Tony holds out the money to him and adds, "Our appreciation is of monetary value, of course."
He already feels like he won’t be able to string two words together in a hot minute. Is that a good enough excuse to just keep quiet? Can he dare? Steve’s narrowed gaze suggests that no, he doesn’t even want to try wiggling himself out of this one.
Tony guides him up the stairs and to a room on the righthand side of the upper floor. It has a roof slope that makes the space look smaller than it is; there’s a single bed in one corner and a row of cupboards and bookshelves on the opposite wall. A skylight drenches the room in soft daylight, highlighting the dust particles floating in the air.
, he holds onto the arc reactor – holds and guards it like he's never done Tony's heart enough. During the worst of nights, it seems to be the only thing tethering him to reality.
so clearly it almost made Tony squirm in discomfort where he was standing. Almost, because a Stark doesn't know such a thing as submission.
Tony knows that, too, because he groans in frustration meant to mask his fear and drags a hand over his face to (not so) subtly wipe the tear tracks away even before Steve opens his mouth to decline. “You’ll need to restrain me at least,” he adds, with a finality.
"It's called a… subliminal message, I believe. Thought you smart city folk would know all about that."
After two days, Steve gets restless. He's been cooped up in and around the house for a while, and his body has built up enough excess energy to last him… well, he hasn't had the opportunity to put the theory to the test, but he could do a couple of triathlons right about now.
It’s an instinctual response – of course it is. There’s nothing else to do for him here than comfort the heat-ridden omega and ensure he is content even after the act is over with, like nature has engineered him to.
Although he was careless in many ways, this was not one of them. Not even Lord Stark would simply appoint an heir on a whim; no, this was his life blood. If he considered Peter to be fit to follow in his footsteps, there had to be solid reasoning supporting this arbitration.
Truth be told, he figured he'd get an evening of extraordinarily extensive lovemaking and maybe some sappier-than-usual pillow talk whispered here and there, but nothing that would differ much from their usual procedure.
But that's not the main focus of this frankly uncomfortable realization he's having, no. It is more focused on the softness of his chest, the receding definition in his calves, the first hint of love handles and the too-obvious pouch there by his stomach where he thinks he's had defined abs sometime ago.
Tony takes a last sip and screws the cap back on. He allows the liquid to sit on his tongue for a moment and then swallows it down, relishing in the burn and the taste until every last trace of both is gone.
This is so different and dirty and wrong that Tony almost comes right then, when Steve's length drags past his prostate and the pain enmeshes with a sudden surge of pleasure.
"Fuck you," Stark spits. Saliva hits Steve's chin. "Who do you work for, huh? Who's so afraid of me they think sending some asshole to violate me is going to change my mind about anything I do?"
There's nobody in the house, but Steve hears the two Starks from the garage on the other side of the building, and so he uses that opportunity to have a shower and put his sweat-soaked clothes in the wash. He won't put anyone through the misfortune of being in smelling distance of his body odor after a five-hour run if he can help it.
He bites back a groan and his panicked gaze flits yet again to where the other man is sleeping. Swallowing down another noise of need, he tries to steer his thoughts away from the matter at hand, but it's to no avail. Tony fishes the flask out of his pocket to calm his wild, racing heartbeat, and waits out the initial surge of agitation.
In the last moment, Tony remembers himself. He wrenches his gaze away from the man's lips and passes Steve's face by, burying his face in the crook of his neck instead. Steve finally comes back to himself and slowly winds his arms low around his back, fingers curling into the jacket when Tony buries into him.
On his 46th birthday, they all sit together in the common room down in the Avengers' quarters at the compound. Most of the rooms are empty these days, untouched and unchanged but cleaned weekly in the unlikely case one of their original inhabitants resurfaces. Tony doesn’t want to be thinking about that, not today, but he’s never been a role model when it comes to keeping promises to himself.
The first face he spots is Tony's. He's flooded with instant relief and only so refrains from exhaling audibly.
. Here he is, another human being, and Rogers prefers to talk to a damn horse. Mostly though, it’s endearing to witness, and Tony often has trouble looking away. But he does. He does look away like he’s supposed to, and instead pats Butterfingers’ neck in way of apology for not being quite as big of a horse-sympathizer as Rogers seems to be.
waiting for it your whole life will make you mad. Steve's learned living in the past doesn't help, and it takes no genius to figure out neither does living in the future–maybe that is something Tony has yet to realize, self-proclaimed futurist he once was.
How can’t it, when this small, tired, grieving Tony looks just as heartbroken as he's been feeling during the worst of times?
After she had sent young Monica to sleep – her daughter of eight years only obeying after having a thorough exchange with Carol about her day's work and the mean boy from the fish market – Maria inquired what was on her mind, a hand on Carol's thigh and another caressing a cheek as they lay in their shared bed.
Tony slides his empty cup across the island and receives a helping of pancakes in return. He should probably ask what that’s about, but Steve’s words have presented him with the perfect opening and he’d be a fool not to make use of it.
mutual, but their coupling was a means to an end, nothing more. If Stark was conscious and in his right mind – well, he wouldn’t want him getting any more up close than necessary either.
When he lifts his head from his chest with a strain, Steve has him laid out over his lap, an arm on his back holding up his upper body while another hand rubs up and down his arm that looks disturbingly delicate underneath Steve’s palm. Tony hears the shouts and the frantic voices; someone’s turning the compound upside down in search of a medic right now, but he knows it won’t be long. He can feel it in his flesh, as macabre as the thought is, the long, bony fingers of death elongating themselves in their reach for him, not quite there but close enough to be tangible.
Even now, he could once again point out a slew of things in his reflection he can’t stand to see anymore–many of which Steve's managed to make him speak fondly of just a few minutes ago. Steve isn’t a wizard, though. (Thank God for that; Tony hates magic.)
It was only after many tedious bouts of defamatory talk later that the woman's interest was piqued again. Lord Hammer had not once allowed his cup of wine stay empty, his calls for refills growing harsher and more and more inarticulate as the evening progressed. (The servants were truly being tested for all their patience and willpower that day.)
“He’s asking for you,” the alpha tells him, voice strikingly level. What she says surprises him, but the things she’s
"We're beautiful," he tells Steve, through the cushions he's deposited his face on. It feels and sounds like something of an epiphany, a
She spoke only to Maria, whom she returned home to as night fell. Her lover and wife-at-heart greeted her with a kiss almost as soft as her smile, and she could read Carol like any open book.
For a moment, it looks as if Steve’s moving to get up, but then he relaxes against Tony's back again. Tony allows himself to bask in the haze of the afterglow while he still can.
He pulled the needle out again in a swift jut, which left a slot that dived into the blue contained within his chest. Tony was fine for a moment, chuckled even at the length of the thick needle as he brought it to his face. But then his eyelids flickered slightly, head swayed, mouth dropped. He stumbled backwards. Fury instinctively held out his arms.
, Peter,” Tony began, took another bite. “I understand you’re used to the cafeteria's black lettuce and
Tony watched as his peer blew out his cheeks in contemplation (or silent stress) and looked around, surveyed the field that glistened slightly in the day-before’s wet. “Uh, practice,” he said suddenly, coughed. “Practice.”
At once, the student wiped a grass-stained palm on his jersey, put a foot on the aisle's bleacher in found confidence. He extended the clean hand succeeding a sports wristband hesitantly up to Tony, though he could barely reach the gesture. “I’m… I’m Parker.”
“If it weren’t already presenting itself a load of shit, I’m far too busy doing other things,” Tony said, reached for his bag next to the chair. “Like, for example, entertaining the cadet you set onto me, and ensuring the engineering facility is never a day vacated. Considering you’ve managed to turn the entire school off the subject through your neglect, I’m the only one ever there.” He looked up at him promptly. “I’m thinking
was the scrutiny that Tony was talking about: an unspoken expectation of explanation (he had only said one word, though it was very much apparent) which Peter sensed came from interrupting him. He looked around, dimmed his voice to work below the silent room. “Uh… Principal Coulson wishes to see you in his office.”
At the sound of the entrance door open, Tony expected Fury, incurious about whatever he decided to work on until he inevitably booted him out for the day.
stance on bullying, of any sort,” Coulson said. “You’ll be safe, completely, under our administration. That’s a promise.”
didn’t happen to be Bruce, then he’d have to look elsewhere; he noticed the only other few in the room donned, coincidentally, blonde or red hair.
did that to you?” Bruce reiterated, needed to make sure he was hearing it all properly. Peter brought his wrist up again, showed Bruce the raised erythema atop the arm.
And then, like bad timing thought itself a saviour of the day, the front door of the facility opened in entrance. Tony stilled, widened his eyes into Steve’s weakened own, and scooted closer to him, hid himself from the view of the inciting hallway behind a table. He turned his head towards the arch devoid of the bifold doors. The shadowed, crisp footsteps of Dr. Fury’s stride fell into Tony’s line of view. He paused.
Tony let off his backpack behind him. He promptly took apart the buttons of his shirt just atop his chest, spread apart the fabric with both hands. Immediately, into Fury’s cautious stare, shone the effervescent blue light from Tony’s writhing heart. His eyes widened.
Tony then turned around properly, gave his back to the situation, and walked out. What a businessman he was.
“Oh, no, we’re not easing up now.” Tony softly slapped the table in emphasis. “But this isn’t my area of expertise. Interesting, yes, but not self-serving."
He put it to his ear, closed his eyes in waiting. Steve eyed him attentively, kept a calm composure so as to keep Tony balanced on whatever rocking, swaying horse his consternation had mounted.
That should be easy. There weren’t even upwards of ten in the room, and the lab benches were numerous enough for one student each, with a few spare.
“I’m just trying to focus on my work," Steve then said, tilted his head back to him. He also thought it wouldn’t be wise to bring up that
a question,” Peter clarified, raised his hands in defence. He stood slowly from the stool, let his arms accomodate the push. “What, exactly, am I looking for?”
Bruce took quickly a small instrument from the array he had out, stood next to him in expectancy. “Alright. Whenever you’re ready.”
“Coach said, uh…" He looked back and behind himself at his far-standing coach for approval, and winced as he returned to face Tony at her reaffirm. “Coach said that watching us won’t qualify you anymore for the team than you already
“No, you’re not,” Tony said, tutted in disbelief. In that moment, he surmised no possibility of Steve being truthful with him, and was absolutely certain in that.
At the sight of Steve’s enlarged eyes, Tony dropped the hand. He grinned something short and impish, returned his focus to an area of the bench.
Tony had settled in quite nicely; he expanded his clutter and workings onto multiple benches, made his fingerprint mark on the various machinery available in the space. Though Dr. Fury had initially declined him being there, Tony took it upon himself to speak the first few breaths of student life into the facility. He spent his time, between and after classes, working on understanding the device in his chest, and had picked up a rhythm of testing that Fury had unfavourably become used to. When Fury decided, one early afternoon, to push out a row of casement on the far windowed wall in an attempt to, as he had said,
The labs were particularly quiet at that time of day (and were particularly quiet in general), apart from a few dedicated students who added nothing more than breathing to the silence. At first scan of them all, Peter pondered one of them to be Bruce. Though Tony had said this was basically a home to him, it would be favourable if he wasn’t, say, out for lunch at that moment. Then, Peter would have to lead a goose chase. And he
after his incident with Clint—and a rush of fervent energy flowed through the pulse of his head. He threw himself in front of a random machine without approval, caring not for Dr. Fury’s permission. “Mr. Stark,” Fury said with linear warning, watched him ignore him. “I can’t let you do that.”
“He got me involved in something I couldn’t explain. A stupid experiment,” Bruce continued. “We were both suspended for a week, which... It’s not much, I know.” Then he shook his head, scornful and dismal, put a hand out to explain. “But it’s about what they put on your record.”
Like all laboratories happened to be, the school’s bio-science division was bright and soundless and cold, smelled like the distant future and chaste hospitals. The side windows displayed a mute, impending storm, which managed to reflect upon the lab and made it glow painfully like a colourless asteroid. Peter stepped inside, and felt an immediacy of misplacement. There was a sense of character and present almost a feeling of encompassment in the engineering facility when he had first decided to visit. This place was devoid of something similar.
. Even worse—though arisen was his empathy—Steve had failed to identify further familiarity in it all. If it wasn’t already adverse that Tony's father had declined his knowledge of him, Steve couldn’t remember anything more about him from that small exchange.
Bruce breathed, thought for a moment with his pen to his mouth, and then decided to stand. He tightened a leaver on the set in front of him, and placed his pen to his notebook that displayed lines and shapes of illegible, blue scribbling. Shrugging off his lab coat, he stepped in front of Peter and set for the door. Peter promptly followed behind him, saying nothing more.
“I’ve merely decided to refer him to you,” Coulson said sternly. “He enrolled while you were hospitalised, set his arrival date for this week.”
Principal Coulson, who stood formally, nodded away the comment with his decorous face. “I wanted to personally make sure your return to school was accommodated for.”
.” He gestured to the dim glow, looked around impatiently, let his hand glide through his hair. He was overwhelmed. “If you really understood as well as you say you do, Barton wouldn’t still be going here.”
While Tony donned his half-finished chest structure and pad enhancement—and was gazing with great scrutiny at the crystalline intricacies of his laser’s foundation—Steve appeared, as he always did, at the entering arch. It was the first time they had seen each other since the latter went to find Peter. Tony held up his right hand, aimed the gauntlet at Steve like he did the beam their first turning of acquaintanceship.
“Fibre and electrolyte supplement,” Bruce said, prepped some tools on the table. “Well, homemade, at least. It’s the best I could do.”
Peter huffed, looked back out into the blue day, too, with a solemn expression, and buried it into his arm to escape the cold. Then, he said something wise above his age, though not particularly unusual for how well-seasoned he was. But it was still profound. “We can’t escape our second face, can we?”
Tony sighed, and Steve couldn’t feign explanation. They both watched Fury kneel to Peter’s care, grab his upper arms and bring him slowly back to his feet, say things like
. He hadn’t cracked jokes of the sort with anyone since Bruce, and Steve and himself had been on an otherwise awkward basis until, visibly, that moment.
Peter sighed, looked warily at Steve. He looked back at him, exhaled too. Something about all this mirrored what they were beginning to think Tony’s definition of therapy was: self-destruction. Carelessness.
Peter watched him, chest rising and falling with great pace. His face looked a little clammy; green and plain. “Well, hunches aren’t
Peter, under Bruce’s instruction, had been exercising his webbing out onto the same spot on the table’s surface, and was now sat weak and wobbly. He was pale—clammy with his eyes dimmed—and happened to resemble with great replication the white mist of rain outside. In his uniform he shook, almost, in a sense of physical surrender. Peter had even managed, for that past hour, to swallow the noise that came with the exertion for the sake of everyone in the facility, and it was taking its evident toll. Bruce was aware of the strain. He eyed him warily.
“Give or take. Added to it whenever I had time during the day.” Tony turned to face him. “Which, you know, is never.”
Steve stood, remained staring into his back. He was restless with a desperation that Tony failed to comprehend, tried his hardest to restrain what he needed to divulge. "I
At his locker, Tony searched for an exercise book for his physics class. He didn’t directly understand
, Coulson. You can’t just show the fruits and hide the labor. The youth are smarter than that. You’ll be tempting no one.”
Steve moved his head back to him again, index finger still pressed into the side of his face. “I don’t know how I’d be able to answer that.”
“With all the sporting you do,” Tony said, looked at the ellipsoid in his hand and weighed it mentally. “I think you’ll understand when I say this.” And he paused, raised an eyebrow again. "
“Well, I’m quite enjoying the music.” Tony pursed his lips and thought deeply, though there was complacency to the action. "Which piece is this? Sounds like something from our fourteenth-century competitive catalogue. Fifteenth?"
Until that midday, when he decided to watch his target play soccer under a pleasant occurrence of sun through soft cloud.
“You’d know by the state of things if you did,” Tony affirmed. He brought a screwdriver to his hand. “And Peter's fine. Says he understands you, isn’t scared either. Honestly, I think he’s just saying that to rub it in.”
At the echoed movement of wood and wheels on hard floor, Tony—who had been engrossed in a snaked clump of wiring, tools, pencils, paper—looked up and saw his undesired visitor. He narrowed a complexed, almost unimpressed stare, then turned back around to his work. “Think you’ve got your classes confused again."
“Down the hall, turn right, then left,” Tony instructed. “When you see the columns, turn right again.”
And then Steve waited, contemplated how he would go about mentioning what he had remembered down at the pond. He disposed that there was no specific way to go about it, and spoke after a deep exhale.
in that moment, except for the pulsating of a blackened pain around his body, engulfing him in a sort of numbness that was inarticulate. He was motionless. Nothing animated apart from his chest, in which his breathing grew deeper, faster, and everything was almost synchronous. His eyes were open, too, but not one subject nor string of thought registered with him; his pupils were at a stasis.
Regardless of how frequently they saw each other throughout the lightless day, they refrained from communication until they met in the early evenings in the facility. It was an unspoken divulgement in which Tony ensured he remained the facade of friendless, strange, strong on his
Tony took a breath, let it rise and drop his shoulders like an insensitive shrug. “Forget it, Steve.”
Coulson breathed, tried to approach the situation with diligence. “Would I be wrong in assuming yourself? By the—"
And then, when Peter had removed the fabric from each wrist, Tony and Steve saw (in proper physicality) the strain of having his abilities. And there was mocking no longer.
Tony face eased up. “Sounds like you’ve got a bit of a selective memory under your own personal bias, there.”
“I’m trying to,” Steve said, wrinkled his brows in thought. He shook his head. “Actually, that isn’t the point.”
“We’ve been standing on the roof of the facility for five minutes, Tony,” Steve said, looked at his watch. “Are we going to do this thing now?”
Tony stopped in interest. He squinted, tried to discern who the student was, what he happened to be doing outside when the sky would weep at any moment. All he could see, from his position, was a short, hunkered back, the behind of browned hair, and the individual’s displaced focus out onto unseen ground. His predictions of weather came appropriately, and a few weighty droplets fell atop Tony’s cheeks. He kept watch of the student a moment, told himself that if nothing was too overtly suspicious he’d continue on his way.
An hour or so after school had finished—and the clouds were deep, shrouding stones that had begun to weep gingerly—Tony made his way over to the facility much more behind time than usual. He strolled, hands in pockets, under the darkness of the postmeridian, looked around into the shaded grass expanse through which he traversed. It was seemingly just him, walking the sea of blades that his school was built atop, the acreage of twisting mounds and ponds, being stared down at by the storeys of New England scales and their steeples. Most of the students, at that time of the day, did not pool around the clearer areas of the school, and preferred to be dining or inside their dorms. With the weather always looking the way it did, any opportunity to be indoors a student took.
Steve moved towards the rows of cluttered tables that distanced himself from Tony with inconvenience. In a sudden, violent,
, when things had gone south with Clint the last time—was something inexplainable. It was like he felt the situation was different, like something in his peripheral couldn’t equate Steve to the tyrant that pursued him,
Tony jumped up from the pew and proceeded for the exit in a gratified stroll, hands in his pockets. Peter yielded, sorted through his musical peers as he obligingly stepped down the choir stands. He surrendered his song folder sadly to the empty pew closest to the podium, set for the walkway, and followed Tony uneasily out of the chapel.
something, however, being concealed among all of it. Steve needed to divulge what it was. For his own sake.
Then, in sudden revelation, Tony turned around and opened his locker again, cut Steve off by the dividing action. He dug deep into the top shelve, sorted through loose sheets of paper. Steve stood there, lingering awkwardly. This
idea if what he was about to do was going to work, and it seemed like the stupidest idea in theory. But Tony was all about theory. Theory, and proof.
“This is ridiculous,” he said, gave up. “Don’t know who told you to harass the nerd and tell him to divide by zero, but I’m done entertaining.”
“Well,” Tony said, widened his eyes at the insensate false-ball on the ground. “Looks like I was right.”
Steve breathed, tapped some fingers on the dark wood. “Are you sure you aren’t—you know—taking too much on?"
Midday presented dust-coloured overhead, a tinge of yellow knocking to permeate cotton ball clouds, and—stood atop the first-storey roof of the facility—Steve and Peter and Tony. The latter was holding a sandwich.
seemed dredged of animation by conforming to that of the heir air. They didn’t ask Tony of his disappearance, nor why it occurred. Instead, they conversed between themselves about it, forced rumours and gossip through the mill. As a result, Tony continued on with his regular traverse around them, in and out of the elitist flow. Yes, the Starks were wealthy—probably the wealthiest of them all—and Tony definitely looked it. But he wasn’t alike them. The statement proved true: not one of them was a friend.
On a different table, Steve had his large frame hunched—in his usual grey sweater—over some schoolwork. Every so often he’d flick his gaze up at Peter and Bruce in interest, and then return promptly to his small conglomerate of books to continue working on whichever class he was behind. In the same manner, he would turn his head with same routine around to address Tony, who was sat behind him at a different table and threw pencils at his back like soft, though annoying, projectiles. At the throwing of a rather large pamphlet, however, Steve decided to address him.
Tony took the blazer he had laid atop his luggage and struggled immensely against the obscure tightness that came with putting it on. The stretching of muscle around his altered chest felt odd, almost tugged at an invisible seam Tony would freeze at so as not to rip something. Deprived of a tie, he wore his backpack, ensured the sternum strap of it was closed and clipped over the protruding globe underneath his shirt. It didn’t hide much of it, no further than the cloth of his shirt already did. It was more, however, in preliminary precaution of any wandering eyes, any questions.
Bruce gripped the strap of his bag again, and huffed. He looked at Tony, who stood with a present equanimity, but Bruce knew a desperation lingered somewhere deeper than his composure. And Bruce, above sticking to general morality (like Tony had mentioned), possessed something called
“You’d better go,” Tony then said all quiet and sharp, surrendered to spelling it out for him. His hand tightened around the wire he had picked up to commence his work. “Dr. Fury doesn’t like students who aren’t his in here. Doesn’t like students in general, it seems."
—he jabbed the probe’s needle into the raised side of the blue device, let it abruptly puncture through the metal with a contained burst. Tony put his focus on the machine’s switches with immediacy, flicked up the one he believed to be the power button, and braced himself for a power reading, a greater light,
Tony nodded, took another bite. He brought his free hand to his hip, looked out at the grey-dulled reach of green openness and the distant peek of the school’s main buildings, and felt like somewhat of a mad genius. “It’s time to put the two together.”
getting lost (but who could blame him; the campus was a small country) and really just wanted a stable, unchanging face to answer to. A
At that, he proceeded slowly around the three of them and towards the exit leading out to the back of the facility. They watched him leave, close gently the door behind him.
Coulson looked at him with a bit more intent. “I’ve also been informed you’ve been spending a considerable amount of time in our new engineering facility.”
For the first time in a while, both of them felt pleasant, irrespective of whatever was going on with the both of them personally.
, was unusual; Tony had forced himself not to frown at the exchange. Steve was looking to Tony for familiarity, just a reassuring glance between classes, and it would prove awkward if he dismissed this and failed to explain later on why.
tampering with a pacemaker—or, whatever that thing is—could kill you, right? Look at what putting in that needle barely did.”
And then, promptly—almost as if on cue—Steve’s neck turned slowly inward, let his eyelids scrunch into folds of reawakening, and he struggled slowly to the support of his palms. He began to push himself up without hurry or prompt. Tony stumbled back at the movement, watched Steve reanimate with caveat and preparedness. He shakily brought his left hand to his heart, all the while his stare kept on Steve, and took hold of the stray external wiring that had broken off the beam pad. It was of great preparation he powered-up his only form of formidable offence against Steve’s strength, as being
Making smaller, more diligent incisions—like he had planned to—allowed him to attach wiring that drove the energy into a beam pad, which he secured around his right palm for easy assessment. That brief stint of dizziness that occurred at first encounter of tool to heart was merely, as Tony had realised, the result of expectancy and self-hype, and it hadn’t happened again. For the time being, he had managed to additionally feed another wire into the face to collect readings in which he varied the prospective strength of emissions internalised through his computer. As a result, however, all operation of it had been pure, controlled simulation.
—and Steve hadn’t sifted the reason as to why. On one hand of importance, Tony was too familiar to just shake off and accept his ignorance. Steve swore he’d seen the eyes, the expression, felt the snarked embellishments of his conversation before. There was something recognised that kept him at a steady pull towards Tony. Steve couldn’t particularly discern what it was that he seemed to be acquainted with, but he hypothesised lengthened encounter was needed for it to be properly seen. And if Tony was evading him, that would be impossible.
He discerned first his age. A year or so younger, he seemed, fit cosily in a grey school sweater that was ridden up on one arm. He had fallen onto his face, let his head turn the opposite direction to his body uncomfortably, and had his lips slightly pouted and parted at his collapse of liveliness. The student was nevertheless incorrupt—definitely juvenile and guileless, with a clean countenance and unkempt hairstyle—and had no belongings or such around him.
“Near the pond?” Someone in the conversation asked. “Well, he picked a damn good place to run to. No one wants to go near that old thing."
, present yourself to someone in the manner in which you just did,” Fury said, pulled out another stool, sat on it too. He studied Tony for a moment, who straightened out his uniform atop the bulge of his chest. “You happy now?” he asked, lowered his face to address Tony directly. "Tick that stunt off your bucket list, ‘cause it's never happening again.”
Returning to his workspace, Tony braced his back to Steve in finality, pursued his continued disregard of him. He fidgeted with his tools, hoped in all his squinting and clamouring that Steve would just
Coulson brought a questioning finger to his mouth. “Any particular reason as to why you’re frequenting the space, though?”

Howard, who sat at his bedside only once, with dry eyes and a firm hold on his forearm. No emotion. No tears.
The possibilities were, in all of Tony’s lack of plausible reality and unrestrained thought, endless.
don’t want to throw myself off a building again, I’m still pretty curious about… about all this, you know? I don’t wanna live in the dark."
But Steve, as he lifted his body into a wobbled crouch, fell backward onto the bookshelf and slumped, opened his eyes into a pained gaze, wasn’t in that temper anymore. He looked at Tony, breathed steadily into the bricked pain of being thrown into wood against hard wall, and asked the question that repeated through both of their loud minds. “What happened?”
"Right." Tony swallowed his mouthful hard, like the revelation of what they had gathered to do came upon him. He turned to Peter properly. “You said the only things that came with the bite,” Tony said, circled a finger in gesture to his wrists, “was the webbing, and the—"
“I can’t even call him on my own favour, Steve. On the basis of someone else’s? You’re dreaming.” Tony fiddled with some tools on the table, went quiet. “That man has no time for any venture that isn’t actively making him money.”
larger and well-accredited institutions on the basis of post-high-school acceptance. Yale, Harvard, Columbia: these days, they want their alumni confirmed half a decade before their application.”
And Tony couldn’t comprehend what had just been said in the moment, and so a gesture of recollection wasn’t even possible. Instead, he let the statement wash folds through his face, and he morphed from that of expectancy to weighted confusion. “My
Again, like he had done before that day, Peter—with great deliberation—rolled up his sleeve. Bruce watched on, puzzled, and gripped his lab coat. Peter moved up the blue wristband, closed his eyes, and flexed the tendons of his forearm.
Tony scoffed. “And you’re basically seven.” He looked over, saw Peter’s eyes wide and anxious, and slapped his back lightly in encouragement. “It’ll be like jumping over two Steves.”
“I really don’t have the capacity right now to think about programs, or summer courses," Tony interrupted, shivered back into the conversation. He reached down to pick up his bag again. “Or university applications, or
Coulson nodded. He pointed a pen at a sheet on his desk, looked at it. “And... you’ve been keeping up with Steve Rogers?”
When Tony awoke, he found his chest compressed tight beneath wide bandages, and the small skin of his heart seared open around a flat blue bulb. Post-sedation, his frail fingers felt the glass face embedded within him, and a pool of dull luminescence shone through his touch, lit his blood faintly purple.
Tony saluted Jarvis, stood up and out of the window.Needing any of them was an ambitious assumption. While he knew he could depend on his driver, who had been answering to the Starks and himself for a variety of years, his own parents were another story. Needing either of them was a fantasy; impossible. Tony never let it happen.
, Peter,” he encouraged himself. He strained, compressed his face into folds, tensed the bottom of his forearm. At once, an elaborate webbing protruded from a raised vein within his wrist’s rash.
Tony was excellent in explaining science. His emotions—or, rather, behavioural inconsistencies—were another thing.
When he had closed the locker, and his backpack was again positioned behind him, Steve noticed properly the coloured gleam beneath Tony’s white school shirt, outlined by the black of his blazer. He widened his eyes a bit, cleared his throat. “Your, uh, undershirt is showing.”
The idea that Steve was meditating on the image of him, for one reason or another, made Tony wary about leaving him alone; his name was burned in his subconscious and his temper was a withering candle wick. Tony, on this notion, deduced it would be
much a natural, it seemed, as he scored another clean goal without so much of a tackle from his opponents. At that, Coach Hill blew her whistle, and the game stopped. She gestured him over to her. Tony saw Coach, hands on her hips, communicating something low and stern. The student resisted and was hesitant in his manner, rubbed his elbow and shook his head, until she nodded in Tony’s direction and mouthed
Tony doesn't groan in frustration, but it's a close one. Sure, it's necessary, a reasonable solution without doubt, but – Christ, he hasn't slept properly in weeks, and now he's, what, on guard duty because local wildlife decided to go for the easiest available dinner?
He’s too busy blinking away the blur in his eyes to be self-conscious about the speed with which he flees the scene.
They return to the compound. The world's in ashes, the people mourning, and there's no-one left to care about bureaucracy or the heroes that failed them.
The last syllable stretches into a quiet moan, and Steve's buried in him to the hilt. Tony moves against him to check. Yeah, no more leeway there. Balls to ass.
animals, no matter how many times Stone's tried to hammer that idea into all our heads. Alright? Let's not go out of our way to prove the bastard right."
"Don't think about it," Steve says, because he's found ignorance to be the only reliable way to stay sane when every day could hypothetically be the day he loses Tony for good. "We're here now and we'll be here tomorrow. That's what matters. Don't– just don't think about anything else."
Tony exhaled, put his tools and wires down, used his hands to rest upon the bench's edges and looked straight through Steve. He saw an actual undershirt this time—white, and beneath the uniformed guise of the blazer—which had cutout a hole for a blue, shining face that projected from Tony's chest. Steve raised his expression at it a moment. He’d never seen anything like it.
Tony tried to pull himself together. Regardless of Steve's veracity—whether what he said was true, any of it,
"That could be anyone.” Tony tried mentally to conjure explanation. “An estranged cousin, you know, or—"
When he had heard conveniently that talk of an engineering facility, an ample space previously omitted from their school without acceptable reason, he let his conjectures about his heart soar.
their connective lie. It was inconceivable for Tony, especially, to believe it was by great chance that Steve happened to have involvement with his father. If verifiable, it could mean something heinous for everything Steve happened to be in that moment. The lack of memory. The
His words taper off into a shuddering exhale, and then he's suddenly hovering over Tony and leaning down, lips closing around his for a fervent kiss before Tony can think of something deflecting to say or mildly self-deprecating to joke about. While Steve's tongue pushes into his mouth, his fingers continue to play with the plug, only pulling it free once he's coaxed another moan out of Tony that he muffles by smashing their mouths together again.
More and more often, he catches himself casting glances outside, watching stars and gas giants as they pass by. The sight elicits a feeling of forlornness in him that’s unlike anything he’s ever felt.
"Come and get it, soldier," he murmurs into the other's mouth, meeting his next stroke hard enough their skin slaps together loudly in the room's silence. It does an excellent job at driving the point home.
Tony wonders whether it'd be sensible to reason the size of other parts of Rogers' anatomy from the size of his hands.
Not to mention that it wouldn’t work with just anyone else. That much he’s forced to admit when he finally gives up on trying to imagine anyone but Steve being with him after the first two attempts have brought him nowhere near relief.
Without another word exchanged, they make for the door. Steve levers it open almost effortlessly with the crowbar Tony hands him without having to be told, their work as seamless and efficient as ever even (especially) with a threat breathing down their necks. Being outnumbered and in over their heads has never stopped them before, and it isn’t bound to now.
ways of being woken up, but that is just another in a long row of things that Tony doesn’t and will never bring up to Rogers in person.
Tony nods. Twice. A few times. His head is just bobbing up and down for a bit, like those little figurines people put on their dashboards. Then he stops and attempts a reassuring smile, but it's strained and doesn't reach his eyes.
Thing is, he's always liked most parts of himself. Sure, he's had to come to terms with the arc reactor and successive scarring, and about every other dude wants another inch or two on his dick, but all in all, Tony's been fine with what's been looking back at him from the mirror.
Well, almost. Whatever it did, it'll have sent him to this exact location for a reason. A reason that is, Steve can only imagine, linked to Tony Stark in some way or another.
They make it out of the crowd, just barely, and hightail it down the street. The next junction comes into view and it’s just as crowded as the one they just escaped from. Steve swears out loud as the group of idling zombies becomes aware of their presence. Tony comes to standing next to him just this moment–Steve curses himself for forgetting himself and the fact that Tony doesn’t have his stamina–still breathing heavily from the exertion of both fight and flight.
, and if there was one thing everyone knew, it was that he loved sex and flaunting his sexuality whenever he saw fit, and this most definitely was such an occasion.
The mules are still beasts, and if you were one to believe that horses can express complex emotions, Tony would say Butterfingers' soft whinny and twitching ears speak of surprise and mild disgruntlement. Mostly in response to being woken earlier than usual, but a part of him also thinks that she doesn't agree with being an active participant in this endeavor.
