Obie retaliated by denying him access to his trust fund. It didn’t matter much, because Tony had already lined up a position as PhD student when he graduated a couple of months later. He pretty much had free reign and he and Professor Yinsen had grand ideas about the direction of the research. It was going to be awesome. Best of all, PhD student was a paid position with only minimal course requirements and minimal teaching responsibilities. The pay wasn’t that much, but it was enough that Tony only needed to work at De Wijnhaven on the weekends.
"If you don't want to cook, just bring the booze, Stark," Clint suggested happily. "I'll give you a list for that."
It was a domestic little scene he was walking into, with Bors yelling and pointing at Percival and being generally disgusted by everything, even more so than usual, and Steve holding Percival back by the arms. A black boat was floating strangely still in the water behind them, where it should have been bobbing up and down in the surf. A stunning girl with long black hair was standing in the prow, holding her hands out, presumably at Percival. Ah, temptation had come for the man again. Of the female kind, rather than the equine this time.
All of a sudden it hit him. What the hell was he doing? How ridiculous was it to try and keep four cats on twelve square meters? Fifteen, once he moved into Bruce’s room.
He only almost slipped up once. It was on day three of Tony-wearing-the-boyfriend-jumper and Steve was getting cabin fever. He was pacing around the workshop alternating with morosely staring out the windows, when he spotted the gaggle of underclassmen running out the back gate for a snow battle. He perked up immediately. That was what he needed, a good snowball fight! Tony and he should captain, because obviously these kids had no sense of strategy. Tony, unsurprisingly, was being a curmudgeon about the whole idea, so Steve dragged him unceremoniously outside. He figured Tony could hex him easily enough if he really didn’t want to go out.
"Screw you, flying monkey, and your pop-psychology. If I'm not the Tin Man, and you're wrong about my heart, I'll have you know, very very wrong, just ask anyboy, then I am the great and powerful Oz."
“Wow.” It took Steve a minute to process this. “And you’re saying that Rumpelstiltskin’s straw did actually turn to gold and is, at this moment, still sitting in the Stark family vault?”
“Good,” breathed Steve, while he slowly slid a hand up Tony’s neck to his jaw, his eyes never leaving Tony’s face. It took Tony a few seconds to realize that Steve was still talking about the cat. And then he forgot altogether as Steve started pulling him closer, inch by interminably slow inch. The anticipation was unbearable by the time their faces were close enough that he could feel Steve’s breath ghosting on his lips. Steve might have stopped pulling at that point, but Tony kept moving anyway, he couldn’t stand it for another second. When their lips touched it was like the world fell away. All that was left was the fact that Steve was kissing him and he had never wanted a kiss more in his life. It started a little tentative, only barely there. Steve’s lips were a bit chapped and the combination of rough and soft was mesmerizing. As it became clear that this was something they both wanted, the pressure increased. Steve’s thumb was caressing Tony’s cheekbone and it was the sweetest thing anyone had ever done to him. He tilted his head more to chase the pressure of Steve’s thumb and then their mouths slotted together even more perfectly and he finally felt the slide of of Steve’s tongue against his own. He couldn’t help the small noise that escaped him. Steve’s hand slid from his face into his hair and, fuck, that felt so good. HIs own hands were grabbing fistfulls of the back of Steve’s sweater, as they tried to pull each other closer. Steve groaned and deepened the kiss when Tony pushed himself flush against Steve’s body.
“I highly doubt that that is going to happen, these things aren't that complicated.” Tony eyes Steve and adds after a second: “But if I can't then I'll put it back together and it will still be the same.”
Tony had JARVIS leave a message with Pepper about where they were headed and then blocked the 17 calls she made in the next 34 minutes. Steve's lips had turned blue somewhere over the Atlantic and he had ice crystals in his eyelashes and Tony couldn't spare any energy on bickering with Pepper. He needed to get Steve home fast, because even if the man probably wasn't dying, like he'd said, he still looked fucking uncomfortable. Even with the added weight, he made record time. Possibly putting a bit more strain on the arc reactor than was strictly advisable, his health being as crappy as it was.
"Who didn't? Fury asked me if I was 'planning to continue to bone Stark' and I didn't say anything, but I -"
and the loneliness and yearning for Steve became unbearable. Then he'd go back to making taser arrows for Clint or any other of the fourteen projects he was working on until he got a nice firm grip on his anger again.
For a few moments the Iron Man just stood there, all lights extinguished except for the faintly flickering arc reactor. A hush fell over the crowd as they took in this new development. Then, slowly, inevitably, the armor toppled forward and hit the mud with a dull thud. Steve's cry of dismay was lost in the triumphant scream that the people let out in unison as they surged forward to claim their fallen foe. Panic clawed at his innards. He did not just watch Tony die. He did not spend more than a year yearning to be found, only to lose the man who finally came for him. To helplessly watch him die. Tony was not dead, the armor was malfunctioning, that's all it was and Tony was fine. He had to be. He was just trapped inside. Holy mother of God, Tony was trapped in the armor and these angry yokels were trying to tear it to pieces!
"No! No, the point is that you'd be incognito. You know... like Clark Kent, our mild mannered reporter when he's not being Superman."
He gives Tony plenty of time to get ready for bed, before he goes up. He still checks: the bathroom is empty, the door to his mom's room is closed. Coast is clear. He takes a quick shower. Once in his bedroom he considers sleeping in just his briefs, because the night is still warm, but it doesn't feel right with someone else in the house. So he quickly shucks them and gets his pajama pants on. He is contemplating a T-shirt versus his pajama tops when he hears a noise behind him. Panic rises instantaneously as Steve whirls around to face his doorway. Tony is leaning indolently against the doorjamb, arms lightly crossed and a smirk on his face. Steve tries to get his breathing under control. Stand down, he tells himself. Stand down. It's just Tony. The panic doesn't dissipate so much as transforms into a different kind of anxiety as he calms down enough to notice the way Tony's eyes are roving over Steve's body. He clutches the shirt he's holding a little tighter to his chest.
Tony sprawled a little more pointedly in his chair and rolled his eyes. “Seriously, you guys need to expand your cyberspace horizons. Let me know when you're ready to move on from MySpace, we can start a support group for you.”
Maybe Loki put him here because there were plenty of other sanctimonious pricks to keep him company.
Tony realized that it might have been a tad naive to think that all that was expected of him holiday-wise was to import Russian vodka and show up for dinner on the 25th. Honestly, that had seemed doable, even for him. And so he remembered agreeing to that. But he did not remember agreeing to anything else and certainly not something as patently ridiculous as going skating at Rockefeller Center. Honestly, who even did that?
“Oh, Steve. Of course there is! Look, that lady over there in the jewel tones. What do her robes say?”
Well, he would find him in due time. First he was going to find a hotel because he needed a shower and about a gallon of coffee. Then he would put together a plan of action, and he would find Steve and catch a flight back to the good old US of A. First class of course, because sleeping in the armor made his back hurt. Cursing the fact that he wasn't twenty anymore, he cracked his neck and stretched his muscles and then blasted off, heading North. It was as good a direction as any.
“Very well,” said Entwistle. “I am sure I could have done a more satisfactory job if I’d have been able to design the set myself. Or if at the very least you’d let me know the design would need to complement one of his.” There was a minute nod at Thistlethwaite, who frowned at the sneer in his adversary’s voice.
“I know. The nurse told me. You spent all day every day by my bed while I was in that coma and everyday since, but
Steve whispered furiously, “Why didn't we get out of there as soon as it was obvious they weren't Hydra? Why make me listen to all... that?”
"But she just wants us come break our fast with her," complained Percival, when Tony had come into earshot. "And I am hungry, aren't you hungry?"
. They both ran around like maniacs flinging whatever they could find and shouting the most ridiculous things they could think off. Pillows bounced off walls, and oranges. Steve got hit in the back by a football and Tony got hit in the face by a teddybear. A box of paperclips exploded above his head and showered Steve in colorful bits of metal He retaliated with glitter, which made Tony curse creatively. Half an hour later they were both out of breath from running and laughing. Steve sagged down to the floor with his back against the wall, holding up his hands in surrender. Tony plopped down in front of him, panting, with glitter in his hair and a wicked grin on his face. He held out a brown feather.
"You could work for me. I need a bodyguard. It's a boring job in which you have lots of time to stand around and observe and think things over. I'd need you close by, so you can stay with me, and I'd pay you. Until you know what you want."
“Be quiet, whippersnapper,” he admonished, grateful when he felt some of the tension drain out of Tony's body.
kissing. It was a little tentative at first, as if neither of them could believe they were actually doing this, right here, right now in the Avengers' tower in the 21st century, but it grew more confident rapidly. Steve took his time exploring Tony's mouth and Tony didn't care how long he took. Every second, every moment, was perfect. He carded one hand through Steve's hair and snuck the other one under his t-shirt. Steve's breath hitched at the touch and then he was pressing himself closer to Tony, moaning into his mouth. Tony thought he might be able to spontaneously combust, just from kissing Steve. He lost track of time in the best way possible.
Steve didn't know for how long he was there but the pain didn't go away like other times. The tears seemed endless as they blurred his view and ran hot down his cheeks and no matter how many times he breathed he still couldn't get enough air into his lungs. He felt as if he was back into the ice, the freezing water all around him and getting into his lungs; he felt like drowning.
Their old bed was too big and the empty space on the left side of it was too evident for Steve to ignore. His clothes were still neatly organized in one side of the walk-in closet, his toothbrush was still right next to Steve's on the sink, and his ring was still resting on the left side table next to the bed, right where he had left it before leaving that morning, and he had never gotten back to wear it again. All those things he had left behind were just evidence of how much Steve had lost, and the pain of that loss was too great for him to stay in that room by himself anymore.
Clint moved and cleared his throat, loud enough to get Peter’s attention and it was almost as if triggering the Hulk out, in the form of a very pissed two year old leaving his spot on Natasha’s lap and crawling over two more people to reach Tony, who helped him sit back up, glaring daggers at Clint who laughed a bit.
“And for the great ending” Tony picked a bright red sock, showing it to the baby and smiling when little hands tried to reach for it “Oh, no, this for uncle Clint’s surprise” Tony crooned as he tossed the sock inside the laundry machine and closed the door “Now he’ll learn how not to break stuff around the house and not to eat your teddy cookies” Tony said as he kissed the baby’s cheek and picked him up easily “Would you do us the honors?” Tony asked to the little one and pointed to the button on top of the machine as he helped him closer, knowing how much the kid likes to press buttons, or anything really, as long as he could reach them, more so if Tony asked him to.
Steve didn’t even dare to question again, he just set the phone down in front of the kitten; whatever to get her to stop crying. He could hear Tony’s voice, if faint, whispering nothings at the kitten and even crooning, and it was working. The cat approached to the phone slowly, surely recognizing the familiar voice and just sat there, meowing from time to time as if answering whatever Tony was telling her.
Some days he made himself busy. After the battle there were so many things to fix all around the world (and the universe, but Steve would leave that to Carol and the Guardians). So many things that needed to be repaired, such as the destroyed compound, society trying to get back on its feet, all those people looking for the loved ones that had vanished after the snap, the memorials of those who died as an indirect consequence of the mad Titan's doing.
But he didn’t have to do anything. Upon exiting the lift he spotted Tony right away. The man was on the couch, dead to the world, sleeping for once, and there was a little fluffy lump on his chest. Steve couldn’t help the smile that curved on his lips as the kitten moved, yawning widely and stretching only to move up a few inches and curl up underneath Tony’s jaw.
The first cat had come and gone, adopted rather quickly only after two weeks under Tony’s care; Miss Peanut Butter managed to put some weight and her fur had lost the scruffy look, getting all soft and shiny. It had been strange to watch her go. He had gotten attached to her, sort of, she had been with Tony pretty much all the time during her stay, and since there hadn’t been any missions or emergencies that required his presence, Tony hadn’t gotten out much, taking advantage to advance with his ever-growing list of duties from SI and SHIELD along with the team’s equipment updates. To say the least, the bots appreciated their new, and temporary, playmate, even if Dum-E had been terrified of the kitten for the first hour, until the kitty purred at him, to which he had responded with his own beeping sounds.
"Please, what?" Bucky asked, lowering down to kneel down to Steve's level on the floor, to what Steve took as an opening to reach out to hold onto Bucky for dear life.
Tony stared down at the—he didn’t even know what to say as he eyed suspiciously whatever Steve was carrying and currently holding out to him, surely waiting for Tony to take it, but the brunet remained unmoving and right on his spot, tense and not quite enthusiastic of the whole ordeal. After a few moments Steve seemed to get that Tony wasn’t about to move and set the thing on the ground gently.
Their security consisted in a very balanced system between technology and human efforts. T’Challa had the Dora Milaje and Tony had Jarvis. The Dora loved and cared for Tony as much as Jarvis loved and cared for the king, even though T’Challa had a bit of a hard time understanding that at first because it was an AI. Due to their status both as King, business man and avengers, to keep themselves and their loved ones safe was their priority which meant there was always someone looking for them at all times, with Jarvis being the ever present eye that saw everything while the Dora Milaje took turns both to work, rest and train. So T’Challa wasn’t surprised when he found one of his guards, this time Okoye, standing by the door that gave to the living room, her dark eyes quickly spotting him and he greeted her softly when she bowed her head slightly.
Tony was sitting on the ground in front of T’Challa’s very large, very imposing panther who was waiting very patiently for her treat, which Tony handed in between his fingers, she took it and munched on it, the large pink tongue poking out. The little girl, with her attention always on everything her mama did, crawled over the soft grass up to Tony and sat down next to the panther and opened her mouth waiting for her treat, making Tony laugh and the Dora smile.
The words left his mouth in a whisper, before he scoffed and shook his head, a mirthless smile curving on his lips. Of course Steve had never loved him, they had had nothing but a few encounters and a few shared kisses that made Tony’s hear soar and hurt altogether.
But some things are too good to last forever and Steve couldn't let himself stop mourning and think on how lucky he had been to live that time with him,. How lucky he had been to be loved back by him, how fate had favored him and given him the chance to hold him in his arms, to have made love to him, to have looked into his eyes every morning and see himself reflected into them, to have seen his unguarded smile, to have made him laugh and to have hopes for a future together.
Rogers' words bring him back to the here and now, his voice a rumble sending a shiver down Tony's spine as he feels the vibration of the man's chest against his naked back.
and his hands were flitting over the mattress and between his legs in a frantic, desperate haste. Steve knew what he needed, and took mercy on him – he'd been so good for so long, had held on even through the tedious and painful bouts to allow Steve that kind of pleasure. He more than deserved it.
At least five spreads of the notebook are occupied by Tony's countenance, and the silence grows louder in his own ears as he keeps staring at the last filled page, where sketched Tony, not entirely finished, is perched on his horse and looking upon the sun coming into view behind a mountain range.
That last part makes her deflate a little, and she shrugs. "Yeah, I guess. It was just an idea," she answers, turning back to hash out some details in her drawing.
Tony can't even appreciate the view, because he's reduced to a single yelp as the bed under him moves all the sudden. Steve pushes it some ways across the room, away from the door and (oh no) toward the mirror. When he's done, the king-size is only a couple feet from the mirror, everything but the head section in view.
Steve makes the mistake of pausing for just the fraction of a second, and Tony grabs onto that reaction, white-knuckled and unrelenting.
Although Lord Anthony did not appear to root for anyone in particular while the tournament was in full effect, he also did not bother to hide the broad, contented smile splitting his face in two when the game master announced the results of the twelve challenges and thereupon declared Sir Rogers the unambiguous victor.
The prospect of going back to SHIELD and practically reliving the past eight years feels like he's stuck in a cruelly ironic catch-22. It's almost a deja-vu, save for the feeling of existential horror that overcomes him when he thinks about repeating the experience of being thrown into a new-old world all over
be the conversational topic is taking a lot out of him. Steve already knows he's going to cave eventually and feels the heady thrill of wanton anticipation zap through him at the thought.
Although the choice of words was insulting and infuriating, it was then that the pieces clicked into place. Natalia was not left with much time to contemplate this revelation about the resident Lord, as someone caused commotion at the end of the dining table.
Tony's voice is strikingly neutral; he's leaning against the wooden pillar at the porch, facing Steve as he balances a basket of laundry at his hip. He just finished collecting clothes (that had been soaked in the squirt gun incident) from the clothesline outside and seems to have only spontaneously been struck with the thought of informing him about SHIELD's nearing arrival.
have any time to spare, and Steve’ll be damned if he allows death to rip him out of his hands now of all times, by virtue of something so banal as blood loss or poisoning when he’s had to endure the worst of it already. Steve won’t allow it to happen. They made it this far; the suffering will pay off. It
Having listened in on some of the many conversations around her, it appeared quite clear that these men had been barred from attending the Lord's private dinings not without cause.
They had both matured over the years, so when Lord Anthony and Sir Rhodes, now Captain of the Guard, received word of a madman overrunning the outer regions of the kingdom with a tireless, ruthless army that was said to comprise of roughly four thousand mounted soldiers and another six on foot, it was evident the king and all high and low royals would have to join forces if they hoped to vanquish this tyrant and stop the bloodshed of innocents.
The Captain of the Guard was a straight-faced, level-headed and at times almost unpleasant man, but nothing and no-one could match his sense of duty or escape his watchful eye, not even a snipe snake hidden away in the undergrowth. He was nothing if not a master strategist, his mind half a dozen steps ahead at all times and his title most deserved.
“Uh, no, I think I’m alright, JARVIS. This is very insightful. Thank you,” he answers, and takes another sip from his juice. Wants to, anyway, but the glass is already empty. Huh. That was quick.
Turning on his heel, he sprints back into the alley that won’t take him anywhere and Steve lets him, wanting to indulge in a little play of cat and mouse. What’s the harm? Might even be a bit of a challenge for a change.
Tony's calmer, quieter. The lake house isn't the kind of place he'd have thought him to settle down in, but Steve can see why. Maybe he needs this, after everything that happened.
There might not be a real danger here (right now), but Steve still feels better turning his own back to the exposed side of the bunk, able to protect Stark’s naked body from the prying gazes of curious individuals.
While Tony gets himself off, Steve takes hold of him and slams him down on his dick like a ragdoll. Or another kind of doll, come to think of it. Either way, being manhandled like some fucktoy is criminally hot, and Tony feels himself shake as the pleasure ripples through him in building oscillations. God, he’s so close, he just needs–
While some of the high Lords in his attendance seemed to be positively fuming with jealousy at his antics, Natasha saw the man's jabs and flirtations as they were: empty talk and games. Despite making eyes at every Lady in the room, Stark did not look at any one of them any longer than it took to soft-soap them.
Bruce went ahead to apply a cooling paste and wrapped the foot in fresh bandages. By the time he began fixing a splint to Anthony's leg, two flat pieces of wood that would force his foot into a fixed position and limit its movement so as to prevent him from disturbing the healing process, the brunet was barely reacting at all but for subdued groans of discomfort.
The Lord halted in his step, a sensible amount of distance still between them. He regarded her curiously, and his lip twitched as if he did not know whether to smile.
Tony ignores their reflection for a moment in favor of looking up at real Steve with a wink. "You know I just like having my ego stroked in every way imaginable, handsome."
Steve keeps to his slow pace, pulls out as far as is possible with the limited range of motion and relishes the needy, mewling sounds Tony makes whenever he grazes his sweet spot upon pushing back in. Tony is squirming in his embrace and his hand comes to rest over Steve’s, which is leaving dark bruises where it’s clutching Tony’s thigh to keep him spread open.
Steve squats down next to him, putting one knee on his chest as he makes to rise. Stark sounds a choked, wounded noise when Steve presses hard against his sternum–and suddenly stops resisting. It takes no effort at all to force him down onto his back.
See, he can't be blamed for being a little over-eager. Steve could have sought out exclusive brothels or asked for all the premium escorts the city could possibly offer. It was even suggested to him during one of his physical exams; celibacy isn't recommended for someone of his kind, who should be working off stress in ways other than violence.
He snaps the journal close but doesn’t bother to hide it from view as he spins around and finds Steve descending the last couple of basement stairs.
It's decided that three of them should be enough to get the job done quickly without getting in each other's way, and so with a last moment of heavy silence, they leave the room.
There was a tonal shift in his words halfway through, going from demanding to pleading, and Steve couldn't deny him the request, not when the whimper following shortly thereafter was so very desperate and so very sweet.
It's like they've overcome some sort of barrier that was impossible to get over a few weeks prior. Suddenly, Steve exists, is spoken to and invited to miniature motorboat races (which he loses) and generally treated like just a new family member. Like that happens every day.
from day one, but he would've never thought them ending up in this position was even a possibility – there's millions of reasons why it shouldn't have been.
(Barnes was different. Their forever-to-remain-anonymous informant–Tony guesses a rat or someone with cold feet–pointed them toward a computerized Arnim Zola when SHIELD was still nazi-infested. Aside from the minor detail that HYDRA had taken Bucky against his will, well. It was also a lot more personal. Finding out about his parents was a lot on its own. Accepting that the hands of their murderer belonged to a man who was as much of a victim as they were? That took some time to digest.)
“You don’t want me to give him kisses now?” Tony spoke to her, smiling and leaning in to kiss her cheek “But I like kissing him” Tony joked and just for good measure he turned back to his husband to kiss him briefly, the little girl didn’t take longer than two seconds to protest and demand her own kiss, which Tony gave her right away.
“I was meaning to surprise you but I ended being the one surprised” T’Challa smiled, leaning closer to Tony and bending over to press a kiss on his lover’s forehead, moving to kiss Tony’s cheek and finally pressing another kiss on the corner of the brunet’s lips, only stopped by a tiny paw pressing against his cheek. The prince chuckled softly and pulled back only to spot the black kitten looking up at him; it didn’t look too content by having his nap interrupted, it almost made T’Challa feel like he had to apologize.
“It was a pleasure, Mr. Stark, thank you for your time” she aimed to hold out her hand to shake Tony’s own before a tiny chubby hand reached out to push away her own right when Tony was in for the handshake.
“Okay, okay” Steve smiled at his husband and leaned down over the couch to press a kiss to Tony’s lips “You want Chinese, right?” he asked, his lips brushing warmly over Tony’s own.
“And who’s that hiding there?” the reporter asked, smiling softly as she bent over just enough so she could see the little one trying to hide behind Tony’s legs, holding onto the brunet’s trousers, turning when the reporter tried to catch a glimpse.
Anyone who could see that would say that Tony was doing more than he should, that he had too much on his plate, anyone would tell him to take it easy, that he was trying his best and that was what mattered, but there wasn’t anyone there to tell him that, not that Tony would’ve believed them anyway.
I'm sorry to say this is not a new chapter. But in better news I'm turning this into a series, so people can read it in an easier way instead of having to skip chapters to find your favorite ship. No chapter will be deleted and will be all included in the series as a fic of their own after being edited and any spelling mistakes are corrected. When I open the series only the first chapter will remain in here and the other will be published once more, starting from the last chapter and so on.
“They say ‘I don’t deserve him, but the boy who lived married me anyway, so you can keep your opinion of former Death Eaters to yourself’.”
"Please," scoffed Tony, "Have you met me? Screw you guys. It's every man for himself, cookie-wise." He squared his shoulder and took another chug of beer. "Wish me luck, I'm going in." He stalked to the table before he could talk himself out of it.
"I think we've got it, Vincent, thank you." Tony used the clipped voice he affected as Corbin and Antonio backed off to Steve's overwhelming relief, but not before he'd slid his hands down and cupped Steve's ass. Steve's knees almost buckled.
“So, listen Stark,” Fury began, “I have some stuff to tell you about your imminent death and your father…”
to say and came up with nothing. His brain was like the blue screen of death. He’d imagined reuniting with Steve so many times, in so many different ways. It was what had carried him through those first few lonely months back at the mansion. He had been fairly busy during the day, strategizing with Pepper and Fury on how to get his company back, but the nights had been awful, bouncing around the deserted rooms. It was weird, he had spent more than two decades without Steve without feeling particularly lonely, but all of a sudden the only thing that would distract him enough from the emptiness had been imagining this moment. This moment, which was turning out nothing like he had imagined ever, with both of them paralyzed while the silence grew from awkward to uncomfortable to fucking mortifying.
Wanda's face lights up as he meets her eyes and Steve feels caught in her gaze. He wants to run, and yet he doesn't. This is what he’s here for. He’s fucking terrified all of a sudden, but he doesn’t run.
Tony did his best to describe the glowing sphere, indicating its size and glow radius and the slightly pulsating quality of the light. He had to use some hand gestures to fill in some of the gaps in his vocabulary. "I have no idea where to even start looking for something like that," he concluded.
a way out, now it felt almost unbearable. Worse even than in the very beginning. Hope was a double edged sword that way, and now he felt trapped all over again. In the wrong place and the wrong time. So much wronger than his seventy year jump into the future. He felt isolated and alone in a way he hadn't had time for in the twenty first century. First he'd been busy fighting off an alien invasion and when the dust had settled he'd had a team. Maybe even friends. Yeah, he'd been lonely and had felt out of place there, but not like this. Nothing like this.
"I believe the squid interrupted the meeting you were supposed to attend and he did bring some guns, sir, but those seem to be ineffective. And they're wet now."
Tony fairly quickly found the abandoned castle he was looking for. It was mostly intact but sat on a part of the coast that was slowly being reclaimed by the sea. The fields around it were too salty to be used and were lying fallow. The hovels around the keep were reduced to sagging, rotting lumber heaps, but the bleak looking castle itself had a few more winter storms to go before it would collapse. He couldn't have asked for a more perfect Evil Lair.
They shook on it, because that was the type of man Steve was and Tony felt a little bit better about himself just being in the presence of that kind of guy.
“It’s alright,” he hurried to say. “I’m over here. I’m not dead.” And then he wanted to bite off his tongue. Way to jump into a puddle of shit with both feet. Steve’s head whipped around and then he just… froze.
"Well..." Loki hedged. After another squeeze from Thor he added: "Someone can go after him. Then both of them will be able to come back together."
“Take it or leave it, Steve, but I’m not the one kicking you out at 3 am. You know where the bathroom is. I’ll be next door.”
Steve woke up early the next morning after his middle watch. He could see the gray light of dawn through the barn's doorway, but the light hadn't reached inside yet. Tony was still sleeping and so was Bors, who had had first watch. He looked around for Percival, but didn't see him. Maybe he had gone out to relieve himself. He waited a few minutes, but when the man hadn't come back inside yet, he decided to investigate. The storm had blown over, but the skies were still gray and the grass was very wet. The birds were loudly expressing their joy at the change in weather, though. The morning was decidedly chilly, a sign that summer was drawing to an end. There was still no sign of Percy in the immediate vicinity, so he walked out to the track they'd come in on.
Tony sat back and crossed his arms, considering her. "Not to mention disfigured. I'd say the money this country could save on health care costs alone would make it worth the effort. You'll probably get a medal."
Around 8 pm the previous night's lack of sleep catches up with him and when he finds himself nodding off while reading his book, he decides to just go to bed. Gwenna has already relocated to the foot of the bed. Steve gets into a fresh pair of pajamas, since he sweated through the previous pair, and climbs into his double bed. Just when his head hits the pillow, the loud noise of an engine starts right under his window. He jack-knifes back up and swears. The hell?! Padding over to the window he realizes he is looking straight down onto the top of the trailer. There are some badly rusted spots on its roof and Steve thinks the goat man should be praying for the drought to last. The noise comes from a generator. Soft lamplight spills through the tattered curtains of the trailer's windows, so Steve's new neighbor must be home. He briefly considers going over to demand he shut down the noisy thing, but it's only eight pm and Steve doesn't like... confrontations. Then he considers moving to his mother's bedroom on the other side of the house, where he won't be able to hear it. He's considered it before; it seems weird to still be sleeping in his boyhood bed, while there is a perfectly fine California King bed with a pillow top mattress elsewhere in the house. It's not like she died in the bed, she died in a car crash. Still, he wasn't ready before and he isn't ready now. Cursing himself for his paralyzing inertia, he grabs another pillow out of the linen closet and wedges his head between the pillows to block out the sound. It takes him hours to fall asleep. At least he doesn't dream.
Judging by the litany of curses behind Steve, Tony is having his own somewhat religious experience. He pulls back slowly, then snaps his hips forward again, causing Steve to gasp again and almost lose his balance. He braces himself and takes it, every pounding thrust a small epiphany of how utterly lost he's been. It goes from amazing to astounding to too much. Too close, too scary, he feels too vulnerable. And
The tingling was spreading over his chest an down his other arm now. He closed his eyes and gritted his teeth for a moment and forced himself to stop railing, because he could feel he was running out of time. He strode over to Loki and grabbed his ear forcefully.
"What was that monster making you see, anyway?" Bors was asking Percy, while he ladled food into a bowl for him. Percy looked back at him with wounded eyes. Then he hung his head.
"He's gone to ground," Bruce intoned a little morosely while pointing at one of the papers, "He's purchased enough food to lay low for weeks if he stretches it and he is physically capable of putting a lot of distance between himself and his last point of purchase within a short time. He doesn't want to be found right now. Believe me, I know the feeling. With a little luck he'll do a lot of thinking though and hopefully chisel away at the Hydra conditioning?" He looked at Steve, who was frowning too.
Steve looked at him funny. Had Tony not made clear yet that he'd had posters on his wall as a kid? Maybe that hadn't come up between the Cuban Missile Crisis and the fall off the Berlin Wall.
Then the conversation shifted to the Deeres' excursion to Monaco and the Monte Carlo Casino that day and Tony was jolted back to being at full alert when Hawaiian Shirt asked him: “You didn't do the excursion today? I would have expected you to.” Tony looked at him. Shit. Were they supposed to have gone and met this guy during the excursion? Was this what a Hydra agent on vacation looked like? Were they all phenomenal undercover artists? He quickly glanced at Steve, but Steve seemed to be trying to disappear into the background and he didn't seem to have caught on to the potential implication of the guy's question.
Lancelot flushed. Gaheris, who had a tenuous hold of his temper at the best of time, punched Dinadan between the shoulder blades and growled at him to not insult his brother. This caused Dinadan to almost drop his end of the litter and Galahad groaned in pain at the jolt.
"It seems, sir, that you and Captain Rogers are trending on Twitter. Except I do not believe Captain Rogers' identity is known yet. You are trending with a blurry picture under 'Tony Stark and his male lover share a kiss in a Roman art supply shop', hashtag TonyStarkIsG(r)ay hashtag IronManHasWood." Steve sat up straight, almost causing Tony to roll off the bench. He grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled him back onto the seat.
I..... Yeah..... How did you know?" Steve thought she looked like a porcelain doll, if porcelain could be as hard as titanium. Her words were scalpels performing precision surgery.
It hit him again a few weeks later. It was the day Bruce was to defend his PhD thesis and the man himself burst into Tony’s room at what seemed like the crack of dawn, but was in fact closer to 9 am. Tony blinked down at him sleepily from his bed.
“Doesn’t matter,” panted Steve. “Just, maybe you could-” He didn’t finish the sentence though. Quickly pulling out, Tony got rid of the condom and shoved his fingers back into Steve’s ass, curling them cruelly against the upper wall and then he leaned forward and bit Steve’s inner thigh again. Steve almost went airborne as he keened his release. Spurts of come streaked his chest. He nearly kneed Tony in the head, but Tony didn’t care. That was awesome.
Steve questions his own sanity anew when the man turns around to walk back to the trailer, but then he gets distracted by the shape of his ass in the cargo shorts as he climbs into it. The radio turns off. Goat Man returns just a few moments later with a laundry sack over his shoulder and a roll of what Steve presumes are clean clothes in the other hand. He jumps down gracefully and closes and locks the trailer door.
“Mark my words, Tony. It'll be the story you're going to be telling at parties of 'how we got together'.”
Del and Corbin had only preregistered for one shore excursion, two days from now. Steve and Tony didn't know whether they had planned to play it by ear or whether they were scheduled to meet with people on the ship, so to play it safe they had decided to stay on the ship unless the itinerary specified otherwise. The upside was that Tony thought they were less likely to be murdered while on the ship. Unless it was convincingly made to look like an accident a ship was easily closed down for a murder (or missing person's) investigation. It was easier to do away with someone and get away with it while wandering in a strange city. The downside was that Steve had looked kind of disappointed that he wouldn't get to see Nice and Florence. He denied it of course, but the man's poker face wasn't so good. That, or Tony was reading him much better already. Tony had to bite his tongue before he could offer to take Steve to Florence later, when this was all over. Because, really? That made no fucking sense at all. There wasn't going to be any after. Steve was nothing to him, after all.
“These are com units disguised as bluetooth headsets. All the posers have them, so besides the fact that we lose cool points, nobody will think we're odd. Just a bit more douchey than we really are. With these we can talk to each other and to JARVIS. I've set up a personal secured network in our bathroom that should cover the entire ship. Don't dick with the purple hairdryer in the bathroom, okay, it's not a hairdryer.” Stark tapped on the stubby thing that had no teeth as far as Steve could see, let alone blue ones, but whatever. The only thing he'd had come away with from that little speech was not to touch the purple hairdryer. That he could do. Then he suddenly heard Stark right in his ear when he said: “JARVIS? Say hello to captain Steve Rogers, known on this ship as Del Porter.”
"Sir Tristan, Sir Stephen, you have returned! You have just missed the most wondrous visitation. There was a chalice filled with wondrous light. It was shown to us by a vile demon who challenged the noblest and most virtuous of knights to come and find it." Before he could elaborate further, though, his eye fell on Galahad's litter as the party made its way into room and he paused.
Tony almost leaned back, until he remembered the bench he sat on had nothing to lean back against. He settled for leaning his arms on the table instead. He looked at Steve.
"Alright, guys, that is enough." said Steve. "Look. They've got a grappling hook for boarding. Actually, I think I see another zodiac coming in behind them..." He turned to Clint. "Is Black Widow still up there with the quinjet? Can she see how many there are? Can we.... JARVIS?" He tapped his com unit. "JARVIS, can you get us all on the same frequency?"
As the evening bled into night and Tony was gesticulating wildly beside him, jarring his shoulder, and ranting about something else that these Medieval dingbats needed to invent, like, yesterday, it occurred to Steve that he and Tony had never talked like this before. Never this long, for sure, but the quality was different too. They'd always been too busy snipping back and forth and finding the faults in each other's words so they could jump on them, to ever focus on their common ground. Now, stuck together in this alien world, they had nothing but common ground. And it wasn't like he hadn't enjoyed their previous pissing contests, because, honestly, as irritating as they had been, they'd also been kind of fun. But this was so much more. Steve knew he had been smiling like a lunatic all night, but he just couldn't stop. He looked aside at Tony, who stopped mid-rant.
"No more unicorns for you," said Tony, rolling into Steve's side and catching his eyes. Steve smiled at him widely, feeling warmth pool in his belly as Tony smiled in return. He slid his fingers into Tony's hair and pulled him closer. "You expect me to ride into battle on an ordinary horse now?" he muttered, faux put out. "Well," Tony whispered back, "I know this budding geneticist that could probably make you one with fangs and maybe a scorpion's tail and.... " Kissing was an excellent way of shutting Tony up, Steve had noticed.
“Let me see,” said Bruce-the-human, while Tony shrugged helplessly. Bruce took the kitten from Steve and examined it closely. Steve shoved his hand in his pocket and stood a little forlorn while a small puddle formed around his feet on the old industrial grade black linoleum.
"Oh! I crossed myself and it bucked me off and then it burst into flames and went screaming over the cliff."
It was Steve who finally did. He was softly stroking Clint’s belly, for which Clint had rolled onto his back, paws sticking up into the air and with an utterly satisfied little cat smirk on his face. Tony was almost jealous.
“My name is... uhm, Anthony, Lord Stark.” One could hardly claim to be a demon king and be a commoner, after all.
His hope of a quick return to more civilized state of living had died a slow and agonizing death about a week into the search. There were too many places Steve could be and there was not enough time in the day to visit them all on foot, or even on horseback. Tony had no tools, no connections, no communication skills, no friends, and no clout and it was fucking terrifying to think he might not find Steve soon. Life was a lot harder here than it looked in Braveheart, he'd realized. Appendicitis and diabetes and a score of other afflictions were death sentences. He'd seen people disfigured by polio and smallpox, and beggars starving to death. Hell, you could step on a rusty nail and die of lockjaw. The idea of being stuck here scared the shit out of him.
“I’m so glad you’re all supportive,” he announced. “And I want you to know it’s not for lack of trying…” There was a new round of laughter and a little ‘oh’ from Darcy and Steve lobbed a coaster at his head. “...but I was actually talking about my cat called Steve, who managed to get knocked up before I managed to catch him… her, a couple of days ago. He... she is going to be a teen mom and while I blame society and not her, God forbid,  anyone who wants a kitten in a couple of months, let me know.” Then he said back down and raised his glass to everyone, which was met with ‘Cheers!’ all around.
Well, then. It looked like Tony was going home with Steve. Not like there weren’t a million empty beds at Gryffindor. He untangled himself carefully, feeling a twinge at the little noise of protest Tony made. After a few seconds of deliberation, he carefully lifted him off the couch, bridal style, tucking Tony’s head against his shoulder. He was heavier than Steve expected, but nothing he couldn’t handle.
“The cats are good.” Off to splendid start, he was. What else? What else? “They didn’t like the flight. They really didn’t. I’m telling you, I am never flying with five cats again. Brucie yowled for seven hours straight, I think he may have extra narrow ear canals or something, I’ll have to ask the vet…” Tony babbled on, wondering if this really was what Steve wanted to talk about. Steve was nodding, so maybe it was? No, it wasn’t. It was like they were stuck in that courtroom again, talking about all that shit with impassive faces. Except for the eyes. Steve’s eyes were hungry. They were latched on to Tony, devouring the sight of him, probably not even listening to anything he was saying. And why the hell Was Tony still on the opposite side of the limo from him? He trailed off…
Tony fell back onto his back and stared at the ceiling. This time he could hear the front door loud and clear.
"We're never fucking again. There is no way we could top that one. It's gotta be all downhill from here."
"All of it." Steve stared morosely at his plate. "I don't feel ready for any of that. It's like... WWII was yesterday for me. I saw Peggy day before yesterday. I am barely here and I know nothing about this world. I need some time. Before I need to do anything. Time to figure out what's what." He looked at Tony beseechingly with those big blue eyes and Tony tried not to crumple like a wet tissue and start patting his hand and say ‘there, there’.
opportunity? But what the hell had that second one been about? Tony couldn't remember ever having been kissed like that. He could only think of a couple of kisses that weren't let's-have-sex-soon-kisses. There were the not-now-Tony-I'm-busy-pecks he'd often gotten from Pepper and the well-done-boy-kisses, also from Pepper. This kiss had been closest to the latter, but had been entirely different and he just didn't know what it meant. Or what he wanted it to mean. Actually, he had an inkling of the latter, but he should let that rest for now, for the sake of his sanity.
. He couldn't figure out if it was Steve's fault for virtually demanding Tony go too far, or if it was Steve's fault for having a direct line into Tony's conscience. Either way, everything was Steve's fault.
He brought his shield down with a resounding crash. A blood curdling shriek came from behind the stone, which now sported a small crack. Steve raised his shield again. Percival's grip on his sword became white knuckled. His forehead was clammy and Tony was surprised he hadn't bolted yet. He himself was staying way back, but not anywhere close to a wall, thank you.
told you 'not my circus, not my monkeys', no matter what Fury says, and I am sure they are handling whatever it is perfectly fine without me."
"Well, I think we are done here. Let's see if we can find a place to dry out and maybe find some food." Steve started putting away his sword and shield. The unearthly cold of the place was gone, but the heavy stones of this church would never get warm on a night like this.
“You left the door open,” Tony announces, almost as if he feels guilty for just walking in, even though he doesn't look it. “I locked it behind me.”
“Dear Captain. Would you care to explain to me why, after all we've been through, I haven't seen you since we got back?”
means, I think it should be fairly obvious,” said Draco and Steve had completely forgotten he was still there. “Wait, here comes Harry. I think he can explain it just as well.” He greeted his husband with a quick kiss.
Steve quickly felt around the bottom of his trunk for the familiar texture and offhandedly tossed Tony his Real Molly Weasley
He tipped his head towards Percival, who was groaning softly, and really not as happy looking as Steve.
The group had snagged some prime tables on the terrace and pushed them together. Steve hung back a little when they arrived, but he was hailed by all Tony’s former housemates and Natasha even got up and made a point of hugging Steve. Chairs were stolen from other tables and they all sat down. Steve was introduced to Betty, Jane and Phil and there was a bit of an awkward moment when Steve insisted he and Darcy had met and Darcy didn’t connect the dots right away. When she did, she had the good grace to apologize, however. Tony went to get a round of beer and after that conversation flowed easily. It was nice to see Bruce again, and Clint and Natasha’s wildly differing accounts of their trip to Budapest kept everyone entertained. Tony’s thoughts kept drifting, though. To Steve and the last few days and how much he wanted to keep him, even if he agreed that Steve had to do what he needed to do. He was spinning a coaster on the table when Bruce suddenly asked:
Then Dinadan broke into a grin, pounded Tristan on the back and proclaimed: "Well, that sure was some manly spear handling!" Steve started to smile tentatively, but then Galahad behind him bit back a broken sob. He turned to look at the boy, but not before he caught Gaheris crossing himself furtively out of the corner of his eye.
Steve shifted from foot to foot and wiped his palms on the robes that he considered ditching right then and there. His gaze sought Tony’s again and this time Tony caught it. Tony smiled. The not fake smile. Everything else faded away and Steve swallowed hard. Then Tony’s smile changed. It got that turn up at the corner of his mouth that preceded every occasion when Tony would do or say something to provoke him, when he would act deliberately to get a reaction out of Steve. Tony’s hands went to the top buttons of his outer robes and never breaking eye contact, he started to unbutton them. Steve’s mouth went dry.
a coffeemaker, praise Jesus and Princess Cruise Lines. He dug around the blanket for his StarkPad-camouflaged-as-an-IPad because the last thing he remembered was looking up Frank Sinatra songs.
"Go ahead," said Steve, dropping his bundle of wood by the campsite, "I am sure you can manage without me. I'll try to catch up with you in the morning." Or not, he thought to himself. If these guys were going to be sent on side trips by random holy men, he was better off on his own. There was a slight risk in not having someone else to watch his back while he slept, but he didn't need all that much sleep, and he'd be faster on his own.
"I can see that," said Tony, "Ignore the emo twins, dude, some popular girl will crush their black little hearts soon enough. Tell me how you're going to make the cat-snakes. What are you going to call them?" He steered the kid around the twins, ignoring them completely and kept the boy talking. At that moment, Steve thought he might love him just a little bit.
"Well I am happy my lack of skills are amusing to you, but I'd rather you just drape me over the railing and go have fun with Natasha and the other members of the skating elite."
“Hell, yes! Nothing better. Nothing better than getting the orneriness fucked out of me. God, Steve, the way you would be able to hold me down and just make me take it... to make me forget what I was angry about and to make me beg for you instead... ungh!”
the experiment, but how long before they realized Tony wasn't Corbin? How long before they found out they had snagged Iron Man instead? It would be obvious a soon as he was forced to take his shirt off. Would they kill him or was he worth more alive? Probably depended on how much they needed money. Steve hated the fact that Tony's life depended on a Hydra bookkeeper and he picked up the pace a bit.
wasn’t going to do anything here. He could probably get through, given a little time, Steve was good with wards, but it took McGonegall eight hours last time, apparently. He checked the walls next to the door. Solid stone, expansion charm, but no wards. Brute force it was, then. He aimed his wand and blasted a hole next to the door, following it up by a quick stasis spell to avoid being brained by any delayed downward action of the bricks. His mouth fell open after he’d crawled through the hole. Tony’s workshop was like all movie sets from all mad scientist movies ever, jammed together. There were cauldrons smoking and colorful liquids bubbling in glass flasks and tubes that crisscrossed the room like hamster tunnels on crack. There was a large collection of mysterious metal parts floating in the center of the room that looked like a slowly rotating cloud of asteroids. There were benches and tools everywhere and various walls were stained black by past explosions, by the looks of it. Metal rods were sticking out of the walls and ceiling at random intervals. Steve would have stood and stared like a dunce, if it wasn't for the frantic calls of the house elf, who had appeared in a slightly singed portrait across the room. And then Steve hear it, the angry rumbling of some large piece of machinery. He ran around the island of worktables with the asteroid cloud above it and came eye to eye with the strangest motorcycle he had ever seen. For one thing it had eyes to come eye to eye with and the wheels seemed to have thousands of tiny spokes instead of rubber tires and the spokes looked sharp and were- oh God, that was Tony Stark on the floor being attacked by a raging bike.
Steve rolled onto his side to face Tony and gently cupped his cheek with his hand. Tony's eyes were black pools in the dark of the night.
Tony tried to wrestle himself back into consciousness, but got stuck in some sort of halfway state. He was very comfortable there, so he wasn't trying very hard. He couldn't hear any more singing, which was a blessing because he could already tell he was going to have the mother of all hangovers come morning. Or come afternoon, more likely. But at the moment that seemed a long time off. He could hear Thor speaking quietly somewhere not too far away, but didn't catch the words. Then Steve answered him and his voice was close, very, very close. In fact, Tony could feel it reverberating under his cheek. He came marginally more awake as he realized he must be lying with his head on Steve's chest. He started a little and felt Steve's arm - Steve's arm?- tighten around him as if to hold him in place and then a hand started to rub soothing circles on his back. Tony felt himself slipping back into sleep. Just before he went completely under he thought he felt a kiss pressed into his hair. Must have been a dream.
He landed on top of Steve, but it wasn’t long before Steve reached between them, gripping his own cock and starting to strip it at a truly brutal pace. Struggling to come down from his high, Tony wanted to protest. To help. He pushed back on his arms.
The rest of the trip passed in a blur and the world didn't snap back into focus until Tony closed the cabin door behind them and Steve found himself crowding Tony against it. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck and Steve dove in for another kiss. Too low, Tony was too low. He placed his hands under Tony's ass and hoisted him up. Better. Even more so when Tony wrapped his legs around Steve's hips and that felt all kinds of right.
They sat in silence, munching chestnuts, which tasted much better than Tony had expected. Steve made little pleased noises while eating, which Tony manfully ignored. When they were getting to the bottom of the bag though, even Steve's warm presence couldn't counteract the numbness of his feet and ass anymore and he suppressed a shiver. Steve sat up with alacrity.
Natasha was home when they arrived. Predictably, she reamed Tony out for stealing her tuna and taking the dishpan, but she was surprisingly nice to Steve. Not that it helped. Tony could feel the tension in Steve starting to build as Natasha bickered with Tony. She might have noticed too, because she went to her room after only a few minutes. But it was too late. When the food was done, Steve wolfed it down and immediately got up to grab his duffel.
Steve had a question. One that he'd never thought Tony would answer, except maybe he had a feeling that if there ever was a moment he could ask it, this would be it. He mulled the pros and cons for a while. Then decided to go for it.
. Bruce claimed it was too much of a hassle to make frequently, so on the occasions that he did, they were all there. Tony had left the kittens trying to catch the raindrops sliding down the other side of his window and had joined the others in the kitchen while they waited for the lasagna to be done in another 30 minutes. He was playing black jack for toothpicks with Natasha (he’d learned his lesson about playing with real money after he’d been forced to live on grocery store bread and peanut butter for a week until his next paycheck came in), Clint and Thor were playing darts and Bruce was chopping tomatoes for the salad. Clint was (futilely) explaining the difference between force and finesse in darts to Thor, when the doorbell rang. Everyone looked at Tony. He’d lived here for three fucking years, but he was still the last one in, so he still had door duty whenever the kitchen bell rang (rather than one of their room bells).
“You sure you don’t wanna come over? We’ll get the food and be right back, some fresh air would do you good”
And he wasn’t wrong, after all, Tony had spent at least 12 hours a day with the cat, of course he used that time to work but he was in the same room as her, and had luckily avoided everything that required him out of the tower. Until that very morning of course. Pepper had arrived very early to pick Tony up to assist to a meeting he had to be present for, hence was why Steve was left on kitten-watching duty.
Then there was Steve, the epitome of perfection to many eyes; righteous, fit, holier-than-thou who thought he made no mistakes, that everything he did was right, the very same man who had scolded Tony for hiding and causing the whole Ultron mess when he himself had been lying to Tony’s face for years, and it hadn’t been something as simple as to not liking the color of the walls but the truth about the death of Tony’s parents.
Tony had never come to terms with his parents’ deaths. Sure Howard had been an asshole and a prick but even he hadn’t deserve to die like that, but Tony’s mom, Maria, had been the light of Tony’s life; for so many years she and Jarvis had been the only reasons Tony had had to stay alive, they had been the only reasons why he came back home on holidays risking to run into his father for whom Tony had never been anything but a failure, a creation because he had never earned the title of son in the eyes of the great Howard Stark. To his father the only one who matters was Captain America, Tony’s childhood hero and hated figure alike; later in life he found that Steve Rogers wasn’t as perfect as people claimed him to be, he was full of flaws but somehow people thought him worthier than Tony, and Tony had accepted a long time ago that maybe he would never be, but that was okay. But that day Tony had witnessed his parents’ death- his mother’s death and lashed out of anger; Barnes wasn’t guilty but neither was Tony.
"Maybe not," conceded Natasha. "Maybe he got kicked out somewhere else, though." She pursed her lips for a moment then looked at Tony again with a speculative look in her eyes. "You know, he could have bought his get up at a dump store near an army base in Germany. But what if he didn't?"
“Ugh. Those brown and yellow flowery monstrosities your grandmother used on Saturdays? Fine. Live! See if I care!” Then he smiled a genuine smile, maybe the first one Steve had seen all evening. “Good to see you looking well, cousin.”
don't understand. You're not just suing the Armed Forces for money. If that was the case they would have settled this out of court in the blink of an eye. You are suing them for access to Captain America. You claim the Howard Stark foundation is entitled to information that they deem classified and, most importantly, you mean to break their claim on Captain America by insisting the contract he signed in the 1940s when he enlisted is no longer valid and cannot be enforced. The goal is to get Captain America into the position where he can make his own choices, correct?"
He startles almost imperceptibly. Steve, can see it, though, because he's so close. Tony has himself back under control in an instant. He stops right in front of Steve. Steve swallows again. The moonlight through the bathroom window paints Tony all light and dark, harsh planes and angles, like an abstract painting. He looks like he should be cold as moonlight, but Steve can feel the heat radiating off him, he standing so close. Steve's libido comes roaring back and he knows his pajama pants aren't hiding anything. He wants to move away, flee to his room, but he can't. Saliva is pooling in his mouth, his throat refuses to swallow.
When he peaks, he has to bite the sleeve of his coat to muffle his shout. Tony breathes heavily for a few, long beats that make the silence much more prominent, and then tucks himself back into his pants.
Tony wanders into the tavern around five, which he thinks is an appropriate time of day to give into his less than admirable habits. He doesn't know why he's trying to keep up the pretense of the respectable citizen; everyone is aware of that not being the case, and he's never cared for small town gossip.
His mouth runs dry, and that's definitely not the cold that has his nipples (amongst other things) standing at attention. One of Steve's hands presses over the left nub while the other wanders down to do not what Tony very much hoped would happen but instead to yet again rub over his stomach and then pull him flush against Steve at his middle.
Tony has to swallow, hard enough it makes a sound and something clicks painfully in his throat, but it's preferable to allowing the tears in his eyes spill or what feels like a
Thinking about possible outcomes naturally also comes with another, rather unpleasant realization: if the Tesseract doesn’t magically return him to the world it’s taken him from on its own, he’s stranded here for good. Tony probably wouldn’t hesitate to tamper with the thing, but Steve has a feeling the risk wouldn’t be worth it. There might not be an army of Chitauri anymore, but he very much wants to avoid any repetition of that time SHIELD tinkered with the Stone back in 2012 and unleashed Loki on an unsuspecting New York. They have better understanding of it now and
Rogers' voice echoes through the valley, bouncing off the mountain ridges closing in around them and eventually fading somewhere deep down in the snow-clad plains below.
Tony takes a step back from the ledge, looking back up from where he's been studying the artfully crafted stone circle at the bottom of the abyss. Steve is still eyeing the Skull warily from where he's standing, shield clutched in one hand and his body strung taut, as if he's expecting his former nemesis to whisper "Hail Hydra" in that gravely voice of his and attack at any given point in the next minutes.
The sense of longing he had woken up with was specially strong so he dared to step into their old bedroom. Steve sat on the left side of the bed, reaching the gold band resting on the bedside table to run his thumb over the smooth surface while remembering how it had looked on his finger. And before he knew it, Steve was crying into the pillow, breathing in the lingering scent as he desperately tried to cling onto his memories of their time together.
The brunet chuckled and pushed himself up, leaving the kitten there as he occupied himself getting one of the little bowls they’d given him for her and filled it up with water and setting it down. Tony looked at the variety of cans of kitty food and without even looking over his shoulder he spoke aloud “What kind would you like best? You look like a fancy kitty, so what about…” he hummed and turned the cans so he could see all the flavors “Salmon?” he wasn’t exactly waiting for an answer so he went ahead and opened the can and he guessed the smell got the cat’s attention because soon enough he heard a shaky little meow that came from somewhere near his feet.
He looked up to where Peter was, sitting on Natasha’s lap at the other end of the couch, absently playing with her fingers, very interested in the dark, glittery purple of her nails, so Clint decided to start subtle; he scooped a bit closer to Tony, sitting by the brunet’s side and moving slowly until they were within an inch of distance and very smoothly, or so he liked to believe, wormed his arm around Tony’s shoulder, thing that wasn’t really odd since Tony was a rather tactile person and liked to cuddle, especially during movie nights, usually Steve was the one having Tony wrapped up all around him but he had been called away to a recon mission and wouldn’t get back till tomorrow afternoon. So it was a chance he couldn’t miss.
“Now all we have to do is load it” Tony said as he faced at the little person sitting nearby on the floor “Wanna help me?” he asked, smiling when the little boy nodded, giving him a gummy smile that showed only two tiny bunny teeth, the little one watched him with those big brown eyes that had anyone who looked at him wrapped around his little finger.
Opening his eyes he saw the blurry image of Bucky's worried face staring back at him, pale blue eyes looking somewhere to Steve's right, and soon there was a hand on his shoulder, squeezing and then rubbing his upper back.
Walking into the living room, he stopped at the threshold and silently looked at them for a moment. There was a sea of pillows on the carpet where the coffee table used to be, but it had been pushed to the side. Tony was laying on the carpet, his head propped on the pillows as Peter cuddled up to him, half on the pillows and half on Tony. Steve quickly snapped a photo with his phone before making his presence obvious.
And Steve wasn’t jealous of his own child, that would be absurd, but sometimes he could almost swear Peter gave him the stink eye whenever Tony wasn’t looking.
To Tony, Steve was the biggest example of a double standard he had ever seen for the soldier claimed he desired to protect people but he didn’t want to make himself accountable for his mistakes, he claimed he was fighting for the freedom of people when he ignored the several countries -129 now- that demanded for the Avengers to be regulated, to make themselves responsible for the damages they’ve caused. Tony understood perfectly the fear other countries had, that a group of American super-powered, enhanced dudes going around the world ignoring borders and people’s rights and leaving destruction and death behind. Tony was tired of being hated and feared, those were one of the reasons why he signed the accords, and it was an attempt to correct his past mistakes. If things had stopped right there it wouldn’t have been too bad, sure they had their disagreements but Tony know they would work around them and come to a middle point; the accords weren’t fixed yet, they could be modified if only Steve and his ‘side’ agreed to come to terms and review the actual version to propose ways to improve it, if things had gone that way, but then Barnes had to appear.
“I’ll get the teething gel, could you hold her?” Tony asked and made a motion to hand the baby to T’Challa and he King was already holding his arms out for her but she didn’t seem to agree, she let out a whimper and held tightly to her papa’s shirt.
Tony couldn’t afford to back down and run away like many other cowards have –like certain star spangled assholes- because so many people depended on him and so many people wanted to see him break down and Tony wasn’t about to give them the pleasure, he’d prove them all wrong, even if his life went out like a candle in the process. Stark men didn’t cry, Stark men didn’t break, they stood proud and shiny like gold, even when they were about to succumb at any minute.
T’Challa had an arched eyebrow right after his husband finished telling him about the little encounter with the reporter, another one. It wasn’t surprising really, and as amusing as it was at first, T’Challa knew Vela would have to grow out of it eventually. For whenever she didn’t like someone close to Tony, she would do everything she could possibly think off to get them to back off, and T’Challa had to admit she had proved to be very smart; she would demand to be held, try to get Tony’s attention or plainly push the other person away if they got too close, leaving the crying as the very last resource. T’Challa had to give her credit for that.
For the last few years of somewhat peace they had before Thanos came, it had been Steve's purpose to still defend the weak but he also had his friends, his team; the family that had come together out of a group of barely functional strangers, but also, he had his love. After all the pain and sacrifice he had left behind when he went into the ice, he had been given the chance to find love again, and he had taken into it without holding back. They had pushed through thick and thin together and made it. Steve had loved with all the strength of his very being, Steve had made his goal to make his love as happy as he possibly could and he thought he had succeeded in all the time they had together. It hadn't been easy to achieve, but it had felt natural to Steve, it had flowed and the chemistry they had had been effortless, as if meant to be.
He had seen T'Challa and Shuri a couple of times during meetings with the council that aimed to continue on the course of the accords to both regulate and train the actual and the upcoming generations of superheroes. Tony's futuristic views had showed and taught the world to be prepared for what was to come, whether that danger was imminent or just an odd possibility. He had met the Guardians, Carol and Thor to wish them farewell and good luck in their respective endeavors, from protecting those in need across the universe to continue on rebuilding their new home out of home. Steve shared a few handshakes and an enthusiastic, bone cracking hug from Thor.
"You have to breathe, okay? We don't want you passing out on us, buddy." The voice said, Sam, as Steve looked briefly at him before reaching out to Bucky, shaking hands grabbing onto the fabric of Bucky's shirt. "Breathe in five hold and out in seven, come on." Sam coached but Steve's mind couldn't focus.
Right there then there was nothing of that man, in that room lied a broken hearted man, soulless  and tearing apart at the seams. He had tried to give hope when he had none, he couldn't see the silver linings right then, all he could feel was crippling, soul-shattering pain. His world crumbled down on him the moment he saw the life leaving his eyes as he held him. His future, his hope, his love was gone. How could he possibly go on after that? Where was he supposed to draw his strength from? How was he supposed to move on if he missed what he had so much he could barely function on a good day?
“No, no kiss!” was the first thing that came out from Peter, the sleepy voice took away any effectiveness the anger could’ve had, making the kid look rather adorable with his big doe eyes and that cute pout.
"I had a meeting and he was supposed to stay with Happy, you know, like always, Happy even brought him the Legos to play with." Tony gently rubbed Peter’s back when the kid stirred ever so slightly in his sleep.
“Tony” Steve sighed once more “Look, we’ve have our differences” he ignored Tony’s scoff “But I’m trying, alright?” he tried again “Okay, I have a proposition, mh? You can try it for one week, and if by the end of that time you still don’t like it then you can back out and I’ll tell Fury it didn’t work out, what do you say?” Steve looked up at Tony, not wanting to look too hopeful, even though that hope faded the longer Tony kept looking at him as if he suddenly grown a second head, or like he had gone absolutely crazy, which Steve felt like he would soon if that situation didn’t resolve itself.
“Girls” Tony called without opening his eyes “Keep it and the two of you are going to sleep in your own beds”.
Tony stared at the kitten and she stared right back at him in what was their second staring contest, this time Tony was lying on his belly on the carpet, leaning his head on one of his arms as he reached out with his free hand, ignoring the mild warning hiss when he got to close. Very slowly, he reached to touch the kitten and scratch behind her ears and under her chin, smiling as the little thing closed her eyes, purring like a happy little engine.
It had been only one week, not the longest he had had to go away for, but God, he missed them to death.
“This is Vela” Tony said, not really making a move to try and get the child to greet the reporter like some parents did when they met with strangers, force the children to greet them and even give kisses or hugs. Tony was not fond of doing that, if the kid didn’t want to say hi then they didn’t want to.
The prince took his phone out and silently snapped a couple of photos, a few to keep them for himself, and some others to send them to his sister, he was sure she’d coo at the photos as soon as she saw them and maybe call to demand Tony to send her more.
The thing about Barnes wasn’t that he was an ex-assassin responsible of god knows how many assassinations through the last few decades, Tony knew that he couldn’t be held responsible for he was a victim of Hydra who had experimented on him, tortured him, brainwashed him into this killing machine who followed orders of whoever who said the right words. The thing about Barnes was that Steve lost all control and ability to reasonable thinking when it came to Barnes, thanks to that and Steve’s insistence of taking a trainee to the battlefield many lives had been lost in Lagos, and for that mistake all the team paid dearly. The thing about Barnes was that Steve hadn’t let go off him, he had never come to terms with the man’s supposed death, Steve had never stopped living in the past despite him reassuring Tony many times that he had given them all a home, that the Avengers were his family now, because the moment Barnes appeared on the map all had turned to shit. Steve left everything for Barnes, he had become reckless and selfish, risking the lives of millions of people for the sake of a single individual and wasn’t that supposed to be against the shit Steve had preached about at Tony so many times?
"So you're his now?" Steve asked still tickled by all of it and he felt a little bad for finding it funny when Tony was obviously very tired after the whole ordeal. Maybe Peter was entering his possessive phase, which seemed a little odd to Steve since the kid loved to share his toys and even his snacks. "I hope he doesn't mind me hugging you."
Steve smiled and attempted to kiss Tony again but stopped dead on his tracks when Peter’s lower lip wobbled, threatening to erupt in a full wail fit.
“No!” Peter’s shrill voice got almost everyone’s attention, except Bruce who was dead to the world sleeping on one of the individual sofas.
"Hey, munchkin, what's with the face?" Tony scooped him up easily. "Do you want hugs and kisses too, is that what you want?" Steve found himself smiling as he watched Tony kiss Peter's cheeks.
"Hey, handsome, are you coming home now?" Tony answered the phone without even waiting for Steve to speak.
"He didn't want to stay with him, he didn't want to stay with Pepper either, he didn't even let her pick him up!" Tony said, wincing a bit as he rose his voice without meaning to, luckily Peter didn't stir.
When Steve came back to himself, it took a few moments for his eyes to adjust after the blinding light from the Vita Rays receded, the searing pain that made him feel as if his very bones were melting also faded. He had woken up a new man, a better man. Not a soldier but a good man, Erskine had said. He had woken up ready to do good by others, to fight the bullies and protect the little guy, to defend those who couldn't defend or fight for themselves. And after feeling useless for most of his life, sick and barely able to make a living, Steve had been given a purpose.
“I present you your long lost son” Tony said, a playful tone in his voice. He scooped the kitten, the tiny thing was barely bigger than his hand, and held him out to T’Challa who took him with both hands, holding him carefully and as gentle as he could.
Friday’s voice brought him back to himself. He was in the middle of his lab and judging by the holograms near him, it was around 2:37am.
“Papa is going to get some food and meanwhile you and I can take a nap, how does that sound?” Tony spoke softly to the kid, who nodded and snuggled up closer to him.
Said kitten was soon distracted by Tony’s hand scratching right between his ears, making it close his eyes and purr happily.
Tony walked forward until he was standing in front of it, he lifted his hand, the one who wasn’t in a sling, and let his fingers follow the gash that mirrored the bruise across his own chest. Tony was the, luckily not dead, proof of how far Steve was willing to go to protect Bucky. A sharp edge of twisted metal cut one of his fingertips but he paid no mind. He could still taste the blood in his mouth and feel the hollow in his chest as he saw Steve leave with Barnes.
The little one pushed himself up, still a little wobbly on his feet but Tony didn’t reach to help him, knowing he could do it himself but Tony remained alert in case he fell or tripped with his own feet, all chubby and adorable, and damn, he did make cute babies.
Peter was a cuddly, tactile little guy. He loved getting hugs and while he liked being picked up by the people he knew and loved just fine, Tony was by far his favorite. Steve was a close second though. Maybe the arc reactor in his chest had something to do with it; Peter liked to put his hand on it and look how the pale blue light shone through his little fingers. Maybe it was because Tony would hum in soft little tunes, gently lulling him to sleep. Or perhaps it was because Tony called him all those sweet ridiculous names on a daily basis.
To tell the truth, he had never realized in how many tiny places a kitten could hide until he had squished himself between the wall and the some furniture, lying on the floor and stretching his arm as much as he could, trying to reach the very last kitten. The evil little thing just stood there, staring at him and not moving a paw to make Rhodey’s job easier.
As a prince and future king, T’Challa had responsibilities, a duty with his country and his people, and he was more than lucky to have a partner who understood that better than many, after all, Tony had his own company, his home, it would’ve been incredibly selfish of T’Challa to ask the man to leave everything for him, just as it would’ve been if Tony asked the same of him, so they worked around it. They were grown men, they talked to each other, though that part had been a bit of a struggle at the beginning, and if there was an issue, T’Challa would procure to bring it up as soon as possible; bottling things up had been the cause of some of their early disagreements.
"I can't... Can't do this." The words came out from Steve's mouth with a heart-wrecking sob, "Not without him, I need him." He swallowed through the painful lump in his throat, face buried on the curve of Bucky's neck and shoulder, "Bring him back... Please, I want him back." He begged, broken and helpless.
“Fine” Tony said after what felt like an eternity to Steve “But don’t get too excited just yet” Tony warned when he saw the blond smiling “I’ll try for a week, and you better not give me that look if I chose not to keep them”.
“Alright, alright, I’m not kissing him” the blond man held his hands up in surrender and pulled away, huffing a bit though he was still smiling; he just couldn’t help himself, it was rather cute.
“Vela” T’Challa chided mildly but the little girl paid him no mind, too entertained playing with the buttons of Tony’s shirt, poking at them with tiny fingers “It’s not right to push people” T’Challa said, brushing some of her hair off her forehead, getting her attention and he couldn’t keep with the little lecture when such a cute baby was giving him a bright smile “You will have to start trying to stop” T’Challa kissed her little hand when she reached out to pat his cheek.
Tony stared down at the pair of very big, round green eyes looking right back at him. The brunet lifted one of his hand and very slowly reached out, he didn’t even touched her –or at least that was what Jarvis said- when she hissed at him, showing tiny milk teeth. Tony stopped, waited for a few moments and tried again, this time he managed to touch the tips of the soft pointy ears before she hissed at him again.
As soon as Clint said that aloud, the pattering of little feet hurrying from the living room could be heard from the kitchen and soon enough Peter appeared, running clumsily up to Tony, pouting and raising his arms until Tony chuckled and bent over to pick him up.
“Maybe I should call you Hulk Jr” Tony chuckled, wrapping a soft towel around the hissy kitten while carefully drying him before setting him back with his siblings, who welcomed him with playful pounces and purrs.
Steve felt himself smiling fondly at that. Happy wanted to appear tough but he just melted like ice cream around Peter, and no matter how much he grumbled at being put on babysitter duty, Steve had seen him play with Peter for hours.
At times Steve ran himself to the ground in his effort to stay occupied and pushing the dark thoughts to the back of his mind. He usually got worried looks from Bucky and yet another attempt from Sam to get Steve to seek help, but Steve's answer was always the same; a little lopsided, fake smile and a failed effort to convince them that he was okay, even though he knew he couldn't even convince himself.
In those weekly therapy group meetings, he had told people to move on and to take baby steps, to fight the small battles as they came and to live day by day. But for him those words were useless as the days bled into each other, the hours passing by like molasses. While the void inside him grew, left by the big piece that had been taken form him, the piece of Steve that died with Tony.
“Young Peter fell asleep in the studio, Vision is in his room and boss is currently in his lab, Colonel” Friday’s voice spoke with ease, she didn’t take a second too long without responding to his question, indicating there were no abnormalities.
Prompt: Give me a Tony who gets a laundry machine just so the baby can sit on it and laugh when the thing vibrates as it works.
“Or maybe I’ll be totally wrong and you’ll like the most common food” Tony said as he set another bowl, this one with food, right beside the water, arching a dark eyebrow when the kitten pretty much tripped over her own feet trying to get to the food as fast as she could “Did they starve you back at the shelter by any chance?” Tony saw as the kitten pretty much inhaling her food, doing a great impression of Thor when the god chomped on food as if it’d suddenly disappear; Tony guessed she thought it would, after being abandoned.
Babies can be rather possessive, that was something Tony had seen from time to time; some kids were rather reluctant to share toys and maybe even food or candies, but people? That was something Tony learned, quite fast actually, even before Peter learned how to talk properly.
“You want one? But they’re Inathi’s treats” the brunet smiled when the little girl didn’t give up so he handed her a treat, knowing she would spit it right away, and that she did, upon tasting it she made a face, winkling her little nose and spitting the thing out “I told you, those are for her”.
“Jesus fucking Christ, what is all that noise?” Clint walked into the common area to a little concert.
“Then do something” Clint wasn’t good with animals, sure he thought they were okay but he didn’t know how to deal with them and he’d rather stay away from unpredictable forms of life, he got enough of that during his time at the circus and more of that at SHIELD.
It made alarms go off in Rhodey’s head because those were dangerous times; the line that divided the relative peace and world chaos was taut and it seemed like it would snap at any minute. After the so called war, things had stilled into what it appeared to be the eye of the storm, the exact moment before everything took a turn for the worse. They were at the point in which one single step out of place, one single mistaken action would start a chain reaction.
Steve had to smile at that because who on earth would’ve said Tony Stark would be god with kids? Let alone have one. But what most people knew of Tony was his public persona for the people close to him knew just how good Tony was with children, it was a thing that came natural to him, you just had to see the gentle way he treated Peter, how easy he got him to smile and laugh and how completely smitten Peter was with his ‘mama’, or rather, how much Peter seemed to dislike anyone who wasn’t Tony. Well, dislike was going a bit too far, after all, Peter was in that terrible age or stubbornness and he had to get his way or he threw a fit that no one was willing to subject their poor ears to, so they almost always ended up giving him what he wanted, which usually turned out to be Tony.
Steve could tell all of them still had preferences, like how Bruce and Thor would more and more often be found together just as Nat and Clint had their own thing going on (although Natasha seemed to have also taken a liking to Ms. Potts, but Steve didn't have enough insight to make an educated guess on the true nature of their relationship).
Later, Tony bids them goodbye with a provocative, little wave and retreats back into the house, in which peace is finally reestablished. Steve waits outside until they're about to leave – which is when an older woman with cropped hair who appears to have overseen the entire operation approaches him and quickly makes her intentions known.
Tony looks on, a little dumbstruck by the turn of events, while a few people raise legitimate concerns and ultimately join him in his staring when Steve slams down a fist on the table and yells, “I can’t
"From the cradle to the grave," Anthony said, a wry smile crooking his lips as he regarded the scene below.
Surprisingly, the first thing he says isn't directed at Steve. Instead, he turns to Maria, hands braced against his hips, and asks, "What are you doing up anyway, young lady?"
, it did its little magic trick and spit you back out in Tony Stark's backyard? Not, as one might assume, in at least the vicinity of the place it originally took you from?"
There's a momentary silence. When the similarities become evident, Steve releases a slow breath through his teeth. Now that a correlation between the two is on the table, the amount of possible implications are overwhelming. Little does he know the worst is yet to come.
ever since Tony removed a spring and his fingers nearly got caught in the jaws of the thing. God knows another injury is the last thing they need now. Leaving Tony to his own devices requires a lot of willpower, because Steve would much rather do it himself than have his gut twist uncomfortably every time the man gets parts of himself in potentially hazardous places. With proper instructions, Steve could probably get the issue resolved in a minute or two, but that isn’t what this is about anymore, not really.
Steve forgoes an answer and leans down to kiss him instead, tongue working to split the seam of his lips with gentle force. Tony smiles against his mouth and continues to move against him, getting just a little more insistent with every push. Previously resting over Tony’s heart, Steve’s hand strokes over his chest to pinch a nipple, applying enough pressure to make the brunet gasp into their kiss.
Stark has just sifted through all their equipment, stored away waiting and ready in the very back of the last wagon. Sooner, long before Stark came to join them, they’d sectioned off part of it to use as a sort of operations room, where everything related to the cause – including meetings – was held. Now, the place is filled with an assortment of tools, most of them crafted (torches, bludgeons, ropes) and the empty barrels they’ll roll out when the day comes to take the train by storm.
But Bruce brings news of what awaits them and Tony feels a not minor rush of vindication despite being out of his skin with terror. He doesn’t mean for it to spill out of him like it does, because they'll soon have what could turn out to be the biggest fight of their lives on their hands–and it happens anyway.
There's only one time he and Steve had gotten intimate while the whole mess with the Accords was going down and so there’s no doubt when it happened.
Steve hums quietly to himself as he cooks. The kitchen window has a nice view. With a dense forest in the back, the lake lies there still and dark, surface blanketed in a thin veil of mist. The early morning light drenches the world in bright, crisp shades, and Steve almost burns his breakfast admiring the peaceful scenery.
Tony uses a pseudonym to forward the schematics he designed in his prenatal engineering frenzy to a trustworthy company. Then he goes back to working on the suit, Rhodey’s prosthetics, an OS overhaul for all recent StarkPad models and everything else that isn’t directly or indirectly linked to the clump of cells growing in his womb.
Between armor plates and polished steel, Lord Stark was plastered against the back of the stone wall, most of him hidden from vision by the tall man pressed into his front. His fingers had turned white-knuckled as they curled into the ringmail shirt the man was wearing over boiled leather.
"You just sit," Steve tells him as another knock on the door announces the end of the five minutes. "If you so much as squirm, I expect you to go all the way and start fucking yourself in front of her."
Quickly, the other man clasped his hand. “Rogers. Steven. My pleasure. I am aware Strange does quite live up to his name, but I had the sense he might be the only one who would still be able to help a man in a condition as dire as Lord Stark’s.”
, which is more than an enthusiastic ‘yes’ in his book when it comes to lazy morning sex. Steve chuckles softly in return and lifts Tony’s leg a bit further as he starts moving at a leisurely pace, watching Tony sigh and twitch and worry his lower lip with his teeth.
Steve stays for the funeral and for one last goodbye, as they send a floral arrangement out onto the lake. An old arc reactor is perched on top, framed with the words '
“I mean, I’ll have to earn my keep somehow,” he counters, shrugging. Tony looks like he wants to argue, but doesn’t. They eat in silence until JARVIS speaks up, informing Tony that his daughter is already headed outside, closely monitored by the A.I. itself.
Next time Tony seats himself back in his lap, the impact produces a wet, smacking sound that has him hide his face in his shoulder. There's little (virtually nothing) that causes him to blush, which makes the rosy color high on his cheekbones currently all the more pretty. Mortification looks good on him, so of course Steve has to add a little something more.
Happy. That's nice, Steve figures. And she always seemed like a morning person – getting as much out of the day as possible and such. With Tony's daughter in her care, that would probably count double.
There was no time to cultivate old friendships when so much more was to be attended to. He had a greater responsibility now, had to not only command a guard but care for land and people, and so it came that half a year went by before he came to Anthony again.
The sun has disappeared from the horizon when they arrive at the cabin, its inside unlit and uninviting. Still, despite how worn down by time and weather the building looks – the boards washed out, stone chimney visibly crumbling, windows covered in old and new layers of dirt – it's preferable to the continually dropping temperatures nightfall brings. In another hour or so, it'll be freezing out.
Tony thought it a little strange that Steve would be squeamish about this particular thing, so he's been giving the matter some thought. Although he hasn't hinted at anything of the like as of yet, Tony figures it might be that for all that he can stand the heat no problem, his skin in a way responds to external sensations with the same intensity all his other senses do and is thus more sensitive than average.
The sensation was amplified hundredfold that very next moment, as the body around him trembled violently, Tony's walls tightening weakly as his every muscle tensed and he came with a keen that sounded of pure euphoria.
to busy himself with something, if only to experience a brief second during which he can forget about all these wrong choices he’s made that led him down this path and ultimately landed him here, in this shitshow of a situation.
Tony whimpers when something pulls inside, a resistance that Steve, although he must feel it too, completely disregards. He breathes out Steve’s name, his voice an octave higher due to either shock or pain. Steve doesn't stop or even falter. He works himself deeper in tiny rocking motions, and Tony feels more raw and open with each one.
This has been his body’s last act of defiance. Resisting, clinging to life, holding on. And now that it has persevered and achieved a final, stubborn feat of endurance, it feels content to let go. After all this time, this is what gets him. Not Afghanistan, not the many people in whose way he stood, not the heartbreak, not the snap. This.
Steve doesn't know how or why this would be possible, but he does know that he needs a confirmation, knows that he'll have to see it with his own two eyes to believe it.
Steve hums in wordless agreement. His hand moves down Tony’s chest with sure, determined pressure that has a renewed burst of heat flare up in his gut. Steve’s always been an unexpectedly assertive lover and Tony, well–he’s always been more than willing to comply.
When he turns the page again, the landscapes and animals vanish into thin air, making room for... Tony. It's all Tony, from a close-up of his mustache to a sketch of him outside the hut, brushing off Butterfingers with an easy smile on his face. It's him at the campfire, illuminated by its glowing embers, him with dishevelled hair and an oversized coat that the thinks might be Rogers'.
As afternoon blends into evening, crickets chirp and seagulls cry. Some nights, they find a bite to eat in a cozy restaurant in a sleepy, little town nearby. The staff is always delighted to find him ordering in fluent Italian, Steve loves to watch him have animated exchanges with them, and the food takes Tony back to the brighter days of his childhood. More often than not though, they'll stay in, cooking and existing just by themselves. Night falls quickly and fireflies swarm the patch of wildflowers next to the patio, their lights mingling with the bright dots of faraway neighborhoods on the other side of the coast.
With tears in his eyes and the residual power in his suit that is nothing more than a helmet, Tony records messages. The last one is for Steve, and he talks and talks until he’s given voice to every last trace of anger and bitterness left within him, and everything that remains is longing for a love lost or maybe never even had. Tony doesn’t know. Tony would just like to be held a final time, and that might be enough to send him on to the next place in relative peace.
Tony can't help but scoff. "Whoever we're dealing with here had no problem getting undetected into the 82nd floor of one of the safest buildings on Earth. Do we really think a lock is going to keep them out?"
Thank God. Tony doesn't voice his relief, but he's damn glad he's going to be spared that task for at least the day. He's pretty sure he's got bruises all over his ass.
They're all they have. And if what they have is cruel, is ugly, is barely an echo of what once was pure and good, then that might just be alright. That might just be what they need, to not break in this world.
Instead of commenting on Tony's habit, he says, "Wolf. Maybe wolverine, but they don’t go for game that large. Unless they're desperate." He swings himself back onto his mount, gnawing at his temperature-induced split lip. "We'll need to, ah, spend a night. If they made a kill once, chances are they'll come back for a second serving, and we can't have them thinnin' out the herd."
The wording makes Steve blink and his throat tighten uncomfortably, and even more so when he realizes the last sentence was meant for him more than it was for Maria.
, Tony." Shit, that’s a growl. Tony's knees buckle. He struggles to hold himself upright with the way Steve keeps thrusting into him with his whole body, and the caveman act isn't helping.
As soon as he notices, Steve gets what they'll need and picks Tony up from the bed, because he isn't about to wait and watch for something to happen. Tony can't bear to ask him outright, so he won't make him–even though Steve doesn't see the issue, because this is a biological imperative and there's nothing shameful about it. Steve’s already helped with the other thing, and much sooner at that because keeping him hydrated has been essential; everything Tony managed to do then was hide his face in Steve's shoulder while the rest was taken care of for him.
That’s what he was told, on that day. After he’d let a wanted delinquent get away because the man had blindsided Steve's rationale with pictures of his infant daughter and pled with him that he couldn’t orphan her. That it wasn’t right. That he would kill her too, leave her to starve.
Steve doesn't answer, doesn’t even spare him a glance until he's punched a new date into the watch. Then, he squats down next to him. Tony would flinch back if he could feel his extremities but as it is, he sits there, enduring the unwanted affection that resonates within the brush of Steve's thumb against his jaw.
With wobbly legs, he straightens and leans his back against the counter. Steve passes him a glass of water from the pitcher on the table and steps back again, hands on his hips, as if he isn't sure whether he's allowed in Tony's space. Steve looks away, drops his chin to his chest. He licks his lips and hesitates for another moment before he raises his head.
"I'm sorry," he tells her, or rather forces it out through grit teeth. Steve hears the reluctance but lets it slide.
There’s a throbbing ache in his left shoulder, the fabric torn where a particularly stubborn zombie dug its teeth into his flesh as he made his escape from the body shop, unable to wait out until the group lingering at the door was gone. Tony didn’t,
Steve follows the direction of his gaze, eyes widening a little as he hurriedly lets go and pulls back, using both hands for support to heave himself upright. His brows furrow in confusion as he takes in their surroundings, looking just as put out as Tony must have only minutes prior.
When Anthony had grown old enough to run and play, they became inseparable and remained it even after his mother's presence was no longer required. The young Stark, unwilling to leave his side any time soon and vocally expressing this unwillingness, soon broke his lady mother's last resolve. Lady Maria could never deny her son wishes such as these, so when the time came for them to leave, she requested James' mother stay housed in the castle as her own waiting maid.
His hand looks bad. The one with the bracelet. Nothing short of crushed, but already healing. Tony wants to tell him to get it checked out–it would be far from the first time he's healed wrong–but Steve's good hand pulls Tony in for a searing kiss, and he doesn't let up until they're both gasping into each other's mouths.
Tony hates having his chest exposed most of all, yet the dimly glowing center that is his heart is at full display now, the fur blanket draped over the side of the chair. Steve can practically feel the effort with which he resists the urge to twist away and hide from her intrusive stare.
Maybe he's being unreasonable here. For not being able to let go, or letting Steve have the dignity of his choice. Whatever he is, Steve is probably the bigger man out of the two of them, because Tony doesn't even have a notion of what he's looking to get out of this. Saving Steve won't get them the Stone. And if they both die in the process-- that's something Tony doesn't want to think about.
One of his hands reaches out to support himself on Steve’s arm as he lifts himself from his lap and halfway to his knees until he feels only the tip of Steve’s cock left in him. A soft moan escapes him as he sinks down, the pleasant friction causing the desire pooling in his abdomen to flare back up in the same way a puddle of gasoline will take to a lit match.
"I don't know how, but the Tesseract brought me here," he says, forcing out the words as quickly as possible so Tony won't get any more tempted to repulsor-blast him into the lake.
as the reality of their victory takes hold of him. There's a relieved, triumphant laugh clawing up his throat, threatening to spill as he watches the last of the fighting cease. Then, he turns, and his gaze catches on something that makes him still.
Tony manages to spend a few more hours with only himself, his thoughts and the booze before he can't stop pretending anymore. He has spotted the leather-bound book lying on top of the bedroll next to the fire a few hours ago, and he's been burning with curiosity ever since.
Steve rocks into his backside for a few more thrusts until he's climbed the peak and made it to the other side of the mountain, dazed and spent. They exchange a look in the mirror, and Tony grins, ths cotton candy still stuffed into the spaces around his brain making it increasingly hard to produce a quick quip. Steve shares the sentiment–he's slow to heave himself back upright from his bent-over position, and once he does, he rubs over the bruised patches of skin on Tony's hips, waist and ass with an odd kind of awe.
His back is pressed flush against Steve’s front, no space left between them except during those little instances when his hips hitch forward an inch or two, only to come back pushing against Steve’s groin again.
"Sir Steven Grant Rogers, it is my personal honor as the 12th Lord Stark of Mar'vill, to hereby name you Commander of the Iron Guard and every man–" the woman next to him shot him a narrow-eyed look, "uh, person in the Far Lands who has pledged allegiance to me and my name."
Frankly, he expected many things when he went to pick up this most treasured personal possession. He expected – well, Tony doesn't know what exactly he anticipated. Maybe to be disappointed. Disappointment would at least have been safe. This, however, is far from it. This means everything and nothing at once. It might be the man simply got tired of other motives and Tony caught his artist's eye, or Tony is intriguing him in a way that has nothing at all to do with their relationship, platonic or otherwise.
"Call if you need anything. Or– on second thought, maybe don't," he says, rubbing his forehead as it creases with a frown. "I'll get you some bedding and, uh, clothes. Later."
Steve feels his mouth fall open. Steve can tell he's pushing himself up from his seat. Steve hears the chair slide back and topple over with the force of it.
He moves forward and puts a hand on Peter’s shoulder as he pushes past him. When he kneels down next to Tony's unmoving form, Steve chokes back a sob at the sight of him; seeing it from afar is different. Half of his face and neck is singed, the skin open and blistered. The armor seems to have melted and merged to accommodate the Stones – it's scorched all the way up his arm, the red and gold indistinguishable.
There was no telling how the wrong person coming to find this truth like she had would harm his authority.
"We have suffered losses in this war, and a territory south of Mar'vill is currently without leadership. Lord Killian has left no successors, and so I meant for these lands to fall under Stark governance. But, I have been made aware that Lord Anthony considers this to be 'bothersome' and 'frankly, too much of a hassle', and he has suggested a solution which he claims will benefit all involved."
One day. One day, his tired, old heart is going to give out and nobody will ever know it was good ol' Captain America's sexual deviancy that did him in. Hell, there's worse ways to go.
. It wants to ride up into the mountains to herd damn cows in icy blizzards and hopefully not freeze his fingers off in the process. Unfortunately, Tony is under no delusions as to what caused him to acquire this unusual taste for adventure.
Peter had tried not to stare at the two visitors as he stood behind the counter, washing the seemingly never-ending supply of used mugs and plates.
Her parents employed an old housekeeper, a man who had fought in the wars of old and was now left with a limp and no coin to his name. Young Carol, only seven at the time, had been intrigued for as long as she could remember, and finally worked up the courage to plead him to teach her how to wield a sword.
Tony looks up at the peak of the mountain in their wake, recognizing it from their hike up to its peak, and frantically checks whether the gem in his hand is still there. He's not disappointed at the results. In his palm, the Soul Stone glows a more subdued orange than before, but it's very much there nonetheless. He shows it to Steve who smiles, having just picked up his shield that's magically reappeared on the ground at his feet, and Tony stores the stone away safely. After all this, he isn't taking any chances.
Talk about the hard truth. He'd have thought the city smell had finally worn off after all this time in Red Rock, but it seems luck isn't on his side. Hell, he knows he's mighty unprepared for something like this, not only because he has practically zero experience with both cattle and land, but also because his physique hasn't exactly thanked him for his activities in the recent past.
Stark knows he means trouble from the very moment they come face to face. Why else would he be strategically obstructing his only way out of the dead end at his back?
Gullible is what he is, more than Steve has ever been. He's tired of playing dancing monkey for a man who has stopped being on his eye level all too long ago. Let them have his head on a pitchfork; Steve will help put it there.
One of the most notable ones is on the desk next to his old drawings. It’s a photograph of them on their second anniversary, courtesy of Bruce, who took it right there in the communal kitchen when they were too busy smiling at each other with mirth in their eyes and laughter on their lips to notice their audience.
do, Steve lies with him and cradles his head against his chest, stroking the greasy strands of his hair in what he hopes is a comforting manner.
Tony doesn't look amused either. What kind of scene he had to cause and which threats he had to make to get Steve released is anyone's guess, but it seems everyone in the vicinity has somehow gotten wind of it. He shoots some of them challenging glares, daring them to so much as move their pinky, and appears a little– huffy. It strikes Steve that that may be why they seem to know their little party is approaching before even having laid eyes on them – Tony must smell the part as well, giving off a scent that would alert everyone but Steve to watch out for the emotionally loaded omega heading their way.
Steve pretended to be nothing more than exhausted, but frustration slipped into his tone at some point. Not without reason, either: they’ve been after the twins for close to a month with nothing lost and nothing gained. Natasha and Bucky usually manage to dig up new leads, but the Maximoff pair spooked badly after their last toe-to-toe.
These words seemed to fulfill their purpose, however – the drunken Lord stood abruptly and stumbled past the rows of chairs, his guard quickly following suit. The prospect of public humiliation appeared to be more frightening to him than any threat of violence.
Tony gives one last smile, maybe to soften the blow, and turns to enter his bedroom, shutting the door carefully behind him. Steve's left standing outside in the empty hallway, not ready to make himself move just yet. He watches the sliver of light shifting through the crack underneath Tony's door flicker and disappear, leaving the hallway a shade darker than before.
Sometimes, he'd feel like cuddling up to Steve and/or participating in a compound-wide movie night or just doing literally anything but getting a round of actual, honest cardio in. That wouldn't be so bad on its own, but then on other days his back or ankle or hip would hurt and he wouldn't feel up for any kind of endurance training, and then on others he'd feel under the weather or banged up from a recent day in the field–
His voice is laced with feigned incredulity and Tony hates him a little for it. Not really, but he shifts in Steve's lap to get his revenge, causing the younger man to suck in a sharp breath as his undoubtedly still oversensitized cock gets jostled with the movement.
Tony still drifts off hugging himself tightly with a fake knot as deep as it'll go, but the knowledge that he has, in fact, taken every measure to protect this fragile life within him makes falling asleep just that little bit easier.
Steve’s having none of it. His fingertips brush Tony’s parted lips, then, and Tony almost immediately stops resisting. As soon as Steve slips his fingers inside, his mouth closes around them and he’s sucking and lapping at the two digits like it’s all he’s been waiting to do from the start.
Steve swallows, his throat so tight he almost chokes on it. His eyes sting relentlessly like he's about to cry again, but the tears won't come. The other two haven't noticed yet that he's stopped his work, both occupied with the suit's lower half, legs and boots.
The mattress dips behind him. Tony tightens his hold around the pillow and mumbles some garbled sounds into the stuffing he hopes communicates his disgruntlement to whoever pulled him back into consciousness. Is this how Steve feels when Tony keeps his ungodly hours? He should know best to be more quiet, then.
Tony has managed to lift and turn his head and regards him with glazed-over eyes, swollen from crying but alight with white-hot fury. Sweaty strands of hair stick to his forehead, and he’s pale as a sheet of paper. It doesn’t come as a surprise that he passes out a moment later.
His fingers squeeze around the space above Tony’s hips; it’s that soft place where the hint of love handles comes in when he’s not lying down.
Steve comes with a shout that he just so manages to bury in the back of Stark's neck, digging his teeth in. Around his cock filling Stark with his spend, his hole clenches and flutters like it's trying to milk him for every last drop he's got. Steve groans, deeply satisfied, and only then does his knot catch, its inflated size slipping past Stark's fucked-out rim forcefully.
Tony thrashes against the ropes, going from pulling to glancing between them and Steve’s towering figure with a wide-eyed desperation, a plea that for a moment makes Steve consider thinking his intentions over. But then his gaze falls onto the marks in Tony’s right arm once more, the blood dried and crusted over but poisoning the rest of his body the same as before. He has to. It's the only way.
They just about manage to keep the fight confined to the vicinity of the compound. The building gets leveled in the first fifteen minutes, but Tony would take that a million times over the casualties they’d see in the city.
“You're everything I have,” Steve tells him, pained, and it isn’t what he’s meant to say, but he goes on despite the fact that his voice is already sounding like drowned in tears he hasn’t yet cried. “I’m sorry, Tony. I love you. It’s why I have to try.”
he thinks. It’s a thought he’s recited so many times the sound of it inside his head is bitterly familiar. Recited it in the hope that one day, he might be able to say the words out loud, with all the sincerity a letter wouldn’t convey.
Tony’s attention shifts, then, and his eyes lock onto his bandaged limb next to him while he chokes on a noise that is both a sob and a laugh. With a strain that makes his features twist into something pained, he lifts the butchered arm and stares. He begins to shake his head as though him rejecting the idea of it could reverse what has been done, his jaw slack, a litany of murmured disbelief tumbling from his lips.
Then however, Steve has the audacity to pull away entirely, leaving his now proudly standing erection glistening with spit against his belly. Tony groans at the sudden loss of stimulation, ready to complain, but the words get stuck in his throat when the reason for Steve's retreat becomes clear.
