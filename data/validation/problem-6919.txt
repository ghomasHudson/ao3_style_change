“What the hell are you talking about, Nick?” Tony growled, clenching his hand tightly around Steve’s arm.He looked fierce, protective; Steve was maybe a little turned on.
It was another couple of hours before anyone exited the operating room, and Tony pounced on the doctor, hungry for news.
“Well, Avengers, thank you so much for your time,” said Sandi happily. She and Noel seemed to be the only ones with any energy left in them at all; the Avengers were drooping, Peter had fallen asleep on a makeup table, and Tony’s suit was almost wrinkled (the horror!). “We’ll see you again next week for the first round!”
“Believe it or not, I find your silver hair extremely hot,” Steve informed him. “Now please shut up and brush your teeth so I can get back to kissing you.”
Maybe they couldn’t have sex the normal way, but that didn’t mean Tony wasn’t going to enjoy every bit of Steve’s new body.
Steve handed the beribboned box over to Tony, suddenly feeling nervous. This was stupid, he though to himself suddenly. Mr. Stark —
“Well, it’s all in the past,” said Tony, waving an airy hand in Steve’s direction. He rocked Peter back and forth a bit, which Steve could tell was his way of hiding his emotions. “He’s been dead a long time, Steve. I try not to think about him.”
“Morning, Cap,” said Clint, pouring himself a cup of coffee. “If you wanted coffee, I’m sorry, but you’re gonna have to drink Bruce’s tea for a change. We’ve run out, and JARVIS says he can’t get any deliveries til the blizzard’s blown out.”
Less than 24 hours later, Steve was seriously considering applying to be the first person who’d died after having a ‘few days of rest’, but he probably wouldn’t qualify given how little rest he was actually resting. And all of this was Tony’s fault.
“Give him back here, I don’t think I held him for long enough.” Steve dutifully handed Peter back to Tony. A wave of happiness washed over him as he watched his boys,
“Good work, boys,” Fury started, looking over them approvingly. “You can have a break until we have to resume filming.” The cameramen around them sagged in relief, but Tony didn’t seem to notice, tugging at Steve’s sleeve insistently. Steve followed him, confused.
“The structure of this thing is amazing,” said Fury mildly, popping a second piece into his mouth. “And somehow, you’ve managed to flavour it really well too. I’m assuming you stuck to the recipe?” He turned his beady stare onto Steve, who gulped.
Steve looked around him nervously. Now that he was actively trying to avoid it, he realized he’d never noticed how fully the marquee was covered with cameramen and assistants and producers. Not to mention the judges, and the hosts Sandi and Noel, who kept walking around the tent and watching everything. Stealing Tony’s brownies without anyone noticing would be almost impossible.
“No, no, Tony, it’s nothing like that, I promise!” said Steve, tumbling over his words in his rush to make his point. “I just — I knew I couldn't buy you anything that you didn't already have, and I couldn't let your birthday pass without giving you
To his surprise, everyone else was awake and gathered around the coffee pot already. In his almost three years living with the Avengers, Steve couldn’t once recall ever seeing them up this early.
, and he was sure Tony felt the same way. They’d made brownies together several times for the team, and even before he met Tony, he’d been baking brownies all his life. Steve knew he could do this. This wasn’t going to be a challenge at all.
He heard Tony call his name behind him, but he ignored it, rushing to his floor to take a shower. He stayed under the water for a long time, trying to focus on the sensation of hot water on his skin and the smell of the insanely expensive soaps and shampoos Tony usually kept for him. Suddenly, he felt an almost nauseating wave of guilt wash over him.
“Feel good,” he said, and then proceeded to throw up all over himself, and a little bit over Steve too.
“I’m not going to lie to you, this week will probably be the most difficult you have faced so far,” said Mary, addressing Steve and Tony at their stations. “This is a technical challenge as well, and only the most perfect loaf of bread today can crown you the Greatest Baker.”
“I’ve still gotta get my hair done,” Tony murmured, and Steve nodded, although he didn’t agree — Tony’s hair looked absolutely perfect.
“Oh well, I guess I’ll just resell the tickets I bought to next month’s Dodgers game—” Tony burst out laughing as Steve smacked him in the head.
Tony’s shoulders slumped, and he looked down at the table, avoiding his husband’s eye. “Steve… it’s not that simple. There’s so much—”
“Last I saw, he got hit with a ray of… something, and then he fell behind the building,” said Clint, “The building collapsed then, and none of us could get him out.”
“I can’t fix that mess, but I think I have enough of my dough left over that you can make a base, at the very least,” he said, quickly pulling out a handful of his blue dough. “Sorry, I’ve already coloured it…”
Clint beamed, looking around at the others with an annoyingly smug look on his face. The judges moved to Wanda next, who’d created one of the most technically perfect pies Steve had ever seen.
“He’s out. Running. That’s probably why the kitten’s up here, Steve usually takes care to keep it in his room—” Clint stopped, shrinking under Tony’s icy glare.
Steve felt his spirits rise, grinning like a madman to himself as the judges moved on to Tony’s loaf. The judges were very complimentary about Tony’s efforts as well, and Steve knew this would be a tight competition, but there was still that euphoric happiness at having created something and being praised for it.
“Really, boss?” Happy yelled from up front, but Steve didn’t care, focusing more on keeping Tony from falling head-first into his own vomit.
“You’ve proved yourself in every step of the way here, both of you. Tony, your pie was wonderful and flaky, and Captain Rogers, your brownies were the best thing I’ve eaten in weeks. You’ve done extremely well, you’ve listened and learned and moved up the ranks, and we’re all very proud of you both.”
“I love you,” he mumbled happily, placing a little kiss to Steve’s breastbone. “I love you so much and I can’t wait to marry you.”
“Thank you,” she said, her thick Sokovian accent clear in those words, and Noel went into raptures as he followed her out of the tent.
“They are very simple to eat,” he declared, and before everyone’s eyes, he picked up the 8-inch slab of burnt brownie and slammed it on the counter, so hard that it broke into several tiny pieces. Mary shrieked and fell backwards, clutching onto Fury’s arm for support.
“Y’know, sometimes I wish I didn’t ever come out. Life was certainly much easier when I was stuck in there.” Bucky had stopped purring now, and placed a soft paw on Steve’s shirt. Steve knew he was just getting ready to fall asleep, but the little action comforted him anyway. “But I guess I’d never had found you if I hadn’t, so maybe it was worth it.”
“New commands cannot be authenticated until after you have been away from alcoholic substances for forty-eight hours, and had eight consecutive hours of sleep.”
“Well, now that the emotional stuff is over, and as much as I’d love to stay here with you all night,” said Tony, standing up and straightening his tie, “I’m going to go mingle with the crowd for a bit before Pepper decides fifty is a good enough age for me to die at.” He hugged Steve — a casual, one-armed hug, but one that sent Steve’s stomach swooping as high as the clouds. “Thank you, Steve. You’re the best friend I’ve got.”
“I think,” frowned Steve with all the precision and strategic prowess that came with the serum and his time as a soldier in the largest, most fatal battle in history, “we’re trapped.”
all the time, a little less now, but at times like this, the hurt just came back, crashing over him like a wave. As much as he’d tried to deny it, Pepper was right in why he’d refused to wear that specific perfume: it reminded too much of Steve.
Steve had to laugh at that. He pulled Tony into a hug, which Tony gladly accepted. ”I’m sorry about your phone, honey.”
The barista, whose name-tag identified him as “Tony”, was one of the few people Steve could claim was the same height as him. He was still a little taller than Steve, but he was petite and lithe, his firm muscles visible as he poured out cups of coffee and handed customers their change. As much as Steve blushed even thinking about it, he’d spent quite a bit of time staring at Tony’s butt, which was very beautiful and round and lush, accentuated by his tight pants and the ribbon of his apron.
Steve pulled him into a kiss, not knowing how else to get the emotions out. He couldn’t tell Tony he loved him, not yet… Steve had had too much experience with scaring girls away for coming on too strongly too fast. “Okay, baby. I
He imagines Tony sitting on the other side, drinking alone, deliberately ignoring him. It burns a little, and he thinks maybe he should go. Pictures himself back in his apartment, sitting on blood stiff sheets and listening to his neighbours fuck.
‘I went through so much to have you here with me,’ Steve tells him and Tony feels lead in his stomach, feels grateful and guilty and lost and wants to say, you shouldn’t have gone through anything. I’m not worth it. He says nothing, because it would be a disservice to Steve, to his effort, to his faith in Tony.
But Steve has a saviour complex. It's not concern for Tony because he is Tony, it's concern for a life, a person in pain who Steve feels responsible for. Tony has been unmoored from Steve's life, drifted to the distance of stranger and civilian.
He looks at her sweat and spit smeared face, overdone makeup notable even in the half light. The patch worn carpet where she kneels, has kneeled, will kneel is puke green and feels as coarse as Tony’s insides do.
'Fuck, I'm such an idiot, Steve. I just wish... I wish you were here.' Tony breaks into a wretched fit of hacking coughs, strings of blood dribbling down his chin and catching in his beard. In spite of this, he feels a hit of renewed energy, like he's been jabbed with an adrenaline shot. The trickling blood flows to a stop like a leak that's been plugged. He looks down at the blood quickly drying, coating his skin like a fine coat of paint and it's like all the toxicity has been bled out of him. He is new somehow, clinging to the lifeline of reciprocation, jittery with an urgency to get up and move, to go home, to find Steve and kiss him and fuck him as he's never quite dared to imagine. It's a dream now, a wish, but no longer a fantasy.
Finally, Tony nods, his lips trembling. “Okay. Together,” he says, and Steve feels lightheaded with relief.
He can’t get it up. Blames it on the coke he wishes he’d taken and lets her suck his flaccid cock in vein for another twenty minutes.
He’s been lying in the silent darkness for hours. Blackout blinds are heavy across the only window in the room. It’s a good place for rest and yet he feels off balance, itchy and light, like if he wasn’t restrained he’d float away. He belongs somewhere else, he thinks, but doesn’t know where the thought comes from or where he is supposed to be. He wonders if the Steve from before was a dream.
Steve stops reading then. Watches him, his eyes fluttering. ‘That’s it, Tony, sleep now,’ Steve’s voice goes low and soft, lulling him to sleep. ‘Next time will be better, next time we can truly be together. Hail Hydra.’
‘I missed you, Tony,’ Steve says. He reaches for Tony’s hand, squeezes his fingers and it feels like the world mean more. ‘Everything will be okay this time.’
‘You understand how important you are to me, don’t you, Tony?’ Tony tries to speak, to say fuck you or spit in this mirror man’s face, but the gag limits him to choked hissing. ‘I can give you a better life.’ Steve rests his hand on Tony’s arm just above the restraint. ‘That’s all I’m trying to do. I hope one day soon you’ll understand. I’d like to kiss you now.’
“Fuck my face.” It’s not a request he has to make twice. Steve is already rock hard by the time Tony gets his pants open.
'Steve?' Extremis tells him Steve is still connected, but he wants to hear him - to know it in his human heart and not just in his computer powered brain.
He’ll puke, he knows, he has before. Nothing but bitter whiskey residue. Breathe and breathe and find his centre. He slowly tucks his dick back in, grabs his whiskey and, about to run, he hesitates. One glance back - the woman is on the floor nursing a split lip the same as his. He tries to apologise but his body won’t work, it moves alone, out that door, slam and run. He has lost control of his human suit. He wishes he was Iron Man now.
Tony rests. He breathes the damp lilac air, twirls his fingers through the grass and listens to Steve breathing down the line.
He read newspaper articles on Tony not so long ago, when they first started this team. Playboy extraordinaire gone off the rails. Suicide attempts. Just another dumb rich boy. They talked about his life like he was a fiction.
The vision of it feels off - off, like he’s looking at the world through a shattered lens and all of the details are slightly wonky. Steve is off. He walks a little different now, like his boots are too tight. His jawline is harsher, tighter, like he’s finally seen so much shit that he’s forgotten how to loosen it up. It’s not quite the Steve Tony know, but so close, like seeing him sideways. He wonders what else has changed. He wonders why he didn’t notice it before.
He pictures Steve and that kiss on a loop. It’s distant now, less like a memory, more like a delusion. Maybe he’s lost it. Maybe he’s tired and desperate and he wants this enough that his mind conjured it up. He wants to scream but before he can, the door cracks open slowly, letting in a sliver of light.
Tony knows that need and knows that he is a coward because he could never act on it, the way Steve is now.
He holds the whiskey bottle close and careful, like it’s as fragile as he is. He’s trembling like his body can’t contain all these volatile emotions, shifting inside, quaking on the surface like the Earth does when tectonic plates are shifting.
He thinks maybe if he had the choice now, he would choose to live. To give Steve all he deserves. He doesn't have that choice though. He should hang up, leave it here and let Steve hate him.
'I guess I've fucked up.' It's the understatement of all understatements and maybe Steve won't get it, but Tony has no better words to express his regret. He's here now dying on an alien world and as much as that's a fuck up too, he doesn't care. He fucked up everything important long before today.
Tony rouses slowly to the march of feet outside his door. A knock, and Steve jolts awake from where he still lies next to Tony. There’s a touch of artificial calm in Tony burying down the instinct that something is wrong. Something is always wrong.
There is blood in the grass, slicking the soil to mud. It’s a good fertiliser, he thinks, maybe that's why the grass on this planet is so vivid and alive. He recalls what the Lord had said about returning to nature, like it was a mercy. Perhaps they are right, perhaps there is some mercy in this, lying amidst the grass as soft as cotton and listening to the song of unearthly birds. It's a peaceful way to die.
Tony loves him, he thinks. The last time he felt like this was Rumiko and the sting it still leaves when he thinks of her tells him that was love.
He tries the door. Shouldn’t maybe, would’ve been better about a man’s privacy once, but he is here now and burning with the need to
They’d had five years. Five years after Thanos’ first attack, to lick their wounds, to mend the tatters of their friendship, and during the past few weeks, with time travelling together and working together like they used to, Steve had thought that maybe they had a chance at being something else. He wasn’t about to lose Tony all over again.
Tony pulls back, coughs, shakes off the poison images, replaces them with the sight of Steve’s cock, wet and hard and waiting for more. He dives back in.
He thinks maybe if he lets Steve down and proves him right, this will be easier for both of them. He should die like he lived. So he says
He starts to move his arms. Tug, pull, twinge of pain against bruised wrists. He’s still restrained. He draws a hissed breath beneath Steve’s lips and Steve draws back, smiling still.
'We never really talked after you came back, did we Steve? I'm kind of a coward. Do you want to know how many times I've stood on your doorstep late at night and walked away without knocking? Guess I kind of hoped I wouldn't have to. That I could project hard enough and you'd just know I was there, crawling, waiting for you to forgive me and I wouldn't have to say anything, because you would just know.'
Tony watches the drip, drip of some cocktail of experimental drugs running into his system and keeping him present in the world. He thinks of the countless families across the globe, sitting bedside vigil for comatose loved one, hoping, praying, never giving up. He wants to ask why him, but it’s Steve and by some standard, Tony is considered a friend and a hero and a celebrity, so of course it’s him. Tony Stark excels at getting his two dozen second chances. Second chances to live a better life - second chances to fuck everything up.
Tony tunes out the words, puts one foot in front of the other and tried not to dwell on the image of a man begging on his knees for his life.
Tony won’t leave. He glued himself to Steve’s side the moment he returned and now Steve can hardly take a piss without Tony following him. Steve’s very own black dog, the constant reminder of his crimes stuck with him like a scar.
Steve marks this gloating with a kiss. Everything Tony has always wanted his life to be; illusion shattered, mirror cracked. Steve who is not Steve. How many times has he seen people replaced or controlled before and yet he believed. Believed that he was important, believed that he was invincible, believed that he was loved.
Steve grabs Tony’s arms and yanks him to his feet. ‘You moron. You absolute fucking moron.’ It takes Tony a moment to find his balance and realise Steve is talking to the Hydra goon. ‘I told you and I told you again.’
Tony is dying a little more everyday. He thinks that Steve is still beautiful sometimes. He has the same face Tony has always know. The same muscles, the same golden hair and soft smile. He walks and talks like Steve always has.
His wallet is damp and the bills inside are sodden, but the young blonde he waves down takes them without complaint.
At the prospect, Tony’s stomach feels like he is dangling upside down over a ledge. He shakes his head but can’t get the words out.
Tony hops off, removes his helmet and stretches, catlike and with a faux casualness that make Steve’s skin crawl with the vision of Tony stretched out naked before the monster that inhabited Steve’s body.
is doing here. He yearns for the days when sex was so simple, and hates himself for wishing he could have that selfish oblivion again.
But Tony isn’t up for talk tonight. He drops to his knees in front of the couch and reaches for Steve’s belt.
He rolls over and watches the fires flickering in the plum coloured sky. Their cities look like shooting stars from down here. It's a little hard to breathe now, his lungs are noticeably tight but not unbearably, like when he pushes just a little too hard at the gym. It's a strangely human feeling that he hasn't felt since getting Extremis.
‘The world will be better like this.’ Steve caresses his face and slowly moves the gag back in place, so gently that Tony hardly notices him doing it. ‘We’ve fought so many times before, but you’ll see. The more you see of this world, the more you’ll understand. This is for the best.’
He peels his sheets from his uniform and his uniform from his skin, walks slowly across the creaking floorboards. Steps into a shower that runs hot and cold, watches the blood and mess still stuck to his skin spiral down the drain and thinks of the people it belonged to. It feels good to be free of it, but the thought hangs somewhere, that it’s not so easy to wash this all away. It runs too deep.
‘Sorry, guess I got a bit carried away.’ Steve runs a tentative finger across Tony’s lip and Tony feels the sting of it. Broken, tender, raw.
'Fuck you!' Steve shouts with a real rage now, a power that makes Tony flinch, even all these worlds away. 'Fuck you, Tony. You think you get to call me up with a love confession then just roll over and die? You're always looking for the easy solution. You think you're generous, giving me closure. Well fuck you, you can't heal all wounds with I love yous. If you die now, you'll be dead and there will be no fixing us because you'll be gone. You say you love me? Then for fuck sake
‘I do love you, Tony, I hope you can see that,’ Steve’s voice is soft and there’s a kindness in him still that Tony had thought gone completely. But it’s no surprise really, Tony excels at seeing the worst in his loved ones.
‘Sorry about these,’ Steve says. A sharp tug at the strap around his wrist. ‘Nightmares or something, I suppose, you wouldn’t stop struggling.’
It's like his body is an overused eraser, once clean and whole, now worn down to uselessness, the dust blown away to fix a mistake.
Steve hushes him again and Tony fights the touch of painful frustration tensing him up. His fingers clench and he wants to argue, but his words are gone. His eyes focus one last time on Steve, and he sees the syringe in his hand. Something pumped into his IV. He wants to resent it, but he’s tired and Steve is only doing what he thinks is best.
Tony likes to imagine it will go like this, time and time again, that he will never be persuaded and maybe eventually this shadow of Steve will see that and kill him. But then, he thinks of what Steve could do unchecked. He thinks of the itching needle of manipulation, the way Steve dipped his toes into the waters of Tony’s mind before throwing himself in. The way Tony was falling so fast under his spell before the hydra goon made his mistake.
He raps on the door, strong, unapologetic. Tony’s light is still on. Whatever he’s up to, he can spare Steve some time. A drink. A talk. Maybe more. He doesn’t think about it. Knocks the door again because he won’t be ignored.
Not when Tony gets out of the shower, not when they have breakfast, or dinner, or fuck the next night.
Steve and he are standing on uneven ground, sticky with mud and covered in the gaping wounds they have given each other. By some miracle, there is still something holding them together, some indefinable link that pulls them back with a snap every time. Maybe they will hurt each other again soon enough, maybe they will live forever in this back and forth of pain and love and betrayal and forgiveness. For the first time in a long time, Tony finds he wants to live to find out.
Tony's eyes scan him. The temptation to cover his emaciated body itchs like sandpaper on Steve's skin, but he lets Tony assess him.
Steve tries again. This time Bucky doesn't stop him, knows that he can try all he wants and it will only lead to Steve doing what he wants anyway. Steve slips out of bed. Bucky finds him some pants to toss on. The hospital gown is not flattering in any way that Steve wants half the hospital to see his butt.
Steve grits his teeth. He doesn’t let himself think of all the times he had wanted to say something, of the ways he had imagined it, or the memory of how it happened in reality. ‘It wasn’t a lie,’ he says and that's all he can manage.
A hot flush floods Steve’s face as he suddenly notices he’s still holding Tony’s hand with his uninjured one. But he doesn’t release it. Carefully, so carefully, he squeezes it; Tony doesn't squeeze back. His hand remains a warm, limp weight in Steve’s. With a shock of pain in his chest, Steve realizes that Tony might never move again. He braces against it and forces himself to speak: “I meant it. Every single word.”
Steve cleans him with a wet cloth and warm water, like Tony is an invalid. He enjoys the warmth, the soft cloth, the feeling of skin on skin and nothing sexual. He thinks he should hate it, but it’s calming, grounding, a real touch he can allow himself to feel as the rest of the world slowly fades away.
‘I blame me!’ Steve toes the ground, digging his feet in, the urge to run, to fight, to just be moving when he feels like this is so engraved in his very being that his inaction feels explosive.
The noise quiets, the light dims. He settles into his own body again. Thoughts lapse like waves, a crash of anxiety and then calm again. Where, when, how. Steve.
Steve sets the empty bowl aside and runs a hand through Tony’s hair. There’s a further intimacy to it, something that feels beyond friendship and Tony wishes his mind wouldn’t wonder to fantasy whenever Steve’s around.
‘I’m tired, I guess.’ Tired. It’s bone deep and there not enough rest to cure him of it. He’s soul tired. Maybe it would have been better if he stayed in that coma.
It’s messy and painful and not how it was meant to be. Tony was stupid to think they could ever find closure like this. Selfish. Even in his dying moments.
‘I’m here now though,’ Steve says, the warmth in his voice unmistakable and Tony questions it all for a moment. So many thoughts and wishes of this and he’s strapped to a bed, delusional maybe. Maybe this whole thing is the last wish of his dying brain or some fucked up mind trick.
He glances at the empty IV hanging limply, doesn’t remember when it was removed, and feels conflicted by the uncertainty of what he’s just seen and the knowledge that Steve loves him.
‘Commander, sir,’ the soldier speaks past Tony’s shoulder, and Tony almost loses his grip as he turns to see who else is there, ‘can you get this fool off of me? You’re needed urgently in conference room B.’
Tony remembers how to breath. The air expands his chest. In and out. It’s a tiring process. Ringing ears. Artificial darkness. Nothing but the company of his own heavy breathing. He feels heavy and slow. Opens his mouth, maybe to say Steve’s name, but it’s swallowed by the air. Too much effort. Just keep breathing. He wonders what Steve would do if he stopped.
He looks around, observes the other scumbags absorbed in their own narcissistic fantasies. He imagines each one of them on their knees like they make these girls get on their knees for them.
Time is just a concept. Whatever long days and nights lay before him, they will end. He believe this because he needs to believe this. He is a bogged down with the memories of a man that will soon disappear. There is a certain cruel self indulgence in how much relief that brings.
‘No, no. I’m not so simple minded, Tony, I thought you knew me better. See in a few days, you’re going to slowly drift back into a coma. The next time you wake, you won’t remember any of this. Right here, right now, I can do anything I like to you and soon you won’t even know. You’ll wake and I will show you our new world and you’ll come to know this is for the best.’
Over the ringing in his ears he can hear the pain in Tony’s voice. It had been a vicious fight, and if Tony felt even half the pain that Steve feels right now, it’s too much. Lifting his head is a big effort, but Steve does, looks around the battlefield, the dust haze and the wreckage of the place that had been his home for five years. Then he looks at Tony, who had been his home for so m much longer. The colours of the Iron Man suit aren’t as bright as they used to be. He blinks to try and focus his sight, but the blurriness stays. The ringing in his ears doesn’t let up either.
His heart beats uncomfortably fast, and with every breath, it feels like there’s a band tightening around his chest. His first impulse is to hunch his shoulders and fold in on himself; to make himself as small as possible. He wants to be invisible. Though the temptation is strong, Steve knows that hiding won’t undo anything that’s happened, and it certainly won’t rewind the last few minutes and make it so Tony never heard his confession.
Dreamy, dazed, he stands over the body and watches the man’s skull draining out across the cream carpet. The strain won’t come out and the whole carpet will need to be replaced. Whoever picked cream must’ve been an idiot.
‘It’s okay Tony, sleep, now. You’re back with us. Everything is going to be okay this time, I promise.’
Tony does as he’s told. Steve turns the lights up and dims the windows. There’s nothing outside but a barren wasteland, a canyon in the middle of the desert.
Steve had been hesitant in the early days of their relationship. He’d confessed to being scared to hurt Tony if he really let loose. But that had been months ago and the more they explored Tony’s masochistic side, the more Steve has come into his own.
“You’re right. My timing stinks. And I am sorry about that. More sorry than you’ll ever know. But you’re wrong. It’s early. You don’t know that you won’t heal. There’s always Strange. Helen Cho. Other doctors.”
They both come quick. Years of holding back, years of wanting and not having and now Tony has Steve here with him, something more than a friend. Something… something. He doesn’t quite dare put a name to it yet, because it’s just sex, sex and a kiss and Tony knows well enough that that doesn’t have to mean anything more.
They go for drinks and sit in silence. He wants to ask why, but doesn’t because it doesn’t take much to imagine. If he were more like Tony, selfish and impulsive and still living for himself. Steve understands too much and hates Tony a little for showing him that.
? Why are we here right now? Why did any of this happen? Why me? Why you? I’m not God, Tony. I don’t have your fucking answers.’
‘Sorry about the wait,’ Steve says like he’s a little late for an appointment. He flicks the lights on without warning, and Tony winces as his eyes react.
Steve laughs. ‘Hydra dear, I am the Hydra Supreme and I have waited for our victory for a very long time.’
Pepper steps aside and lets Steve enter the room. His heart stops when he sees Tony pale against the sheets but it's unmistakable that he's breathing. The machine buzzes and beeps.
Tony knows how much Steve needs this, how much he needs to feel some connection between them, how much he needs to let out all that pain and fear and loneliness. This started for Tony’s sake, but now, it’s like Steve needs to fuck Tony to believe he is really here.
Steve gestures to the IV dripping something florescent into Tony’s veins. ‘Some of the finest doctors have been working on a way to get you right.’
He extends a hand and for a moment all Steve wants is to leave Tony standing there unacknowledged. He pushes down the image of himself touching Tony all over and goes to shake his hand, but Tony notices his hesitation and drops his before Steve can take it.
Of course it fucking matters. He doesn’t say it, because Steve means no harm. Steve’s been waiting for this, and Tony knows what it’s like to be the one left behind.
Tony calls it heavenly, says every meal is like the best he’s ever tasted since he got a body back. In reality, Tony takes two bites and plays with the food like he’s seeing something enchanting in the ketchup swirls.
Steve is slowing now, his movements stuttering, his bruising grip relaxing. ‘Are you tired, Tony? Shall we stop?’ Steve climaxed without him noticing, he can feel it now, between his legs.
He wonders if he's always been missing a piece of this puzzle. If there was something, some word or scenario, that could wedge in that empty spot and hit his self destruction switch, or if he is too conceited to ever actually kill himself. He likes to pretend the world needs Iron Man, even if it would be better off without Tony Stark.
He is dizzy, breathless, nauseous. Altitude sick, but there’s no altitude. No armour. Just a bed beneath him and sterile white light above. A frantic stream of anonymous white coats come and go, blurs in his hazy vision. He wants to tell the world to stop. Back to sleep, closes his eye. They’re pulled open to a penlight stabbing like a butter knife into his eyeballs. A noise, a word, a voice. A muffled shout. Commanding. Familiar. Get out of here, morons. He has the desperate urge to punch someone, but his arms are heavy and stiff like he’s being restrained by his own body.
Tony goes flat, his face suddenly lifeless, like his insides have been tipped out and he’s been left hollow inside. ‘Oh,’ he says, monotone. ‘Okay.’
Puts his civvies on, and thinks of running somewhere. Opens the window instead, lets the night air hit his face and listens to the traffic and the shouting and the new nature of the city that isn’t his anymore.
It stings but Tony has no right to question it. He’s never been the most important thing in Steve’s life and never will be, not like Steve is in his. He’s accepted that long ago.
A steady beeping coaxes Steve to awareness. He feels groggy, his head is killing him and his tongue is heavy in his mouth. What he wouldn’t give for an aspirin right about now. He blinks at the thought. He hasn’t wanted an aspirin since - all at once everything comes back to him. Thanos, the gauntlet, his reflection, Tony - he settles on Tony.
But by the time he’s done in the shower Steve will have turned the TV back on and maybe the early mornings news will come on and maybe Steve won’t want to talk any more than Tony does.
Steve smiles at him, brilliant and shocking and a hint of something smug beneath, and for a moment, Tony wonders who he’s looking at. Steve’s hand moves from Tony’s, slides across his hip and comes to rest on Tony thigh, a hair’s breadth from Tony’s dick. ‘I am more real than I have ever been, Tony. I want you to see me for who I am. See the side of my that I’ve always kept buried. I’m tired of hiding my real self from you. Please,’ he says, and it’s not begging really, or a genuine request for permission, it’s a token offered so Tony can pretend he still has some control here, ‘let me show you?’ Steve asks, and Tony nods.
Maybe Steve will want that from him tonight. He likes Tony on his knees and Tony used to like it too.
Tony tugs at the distant mist of near forgotten dreams lingering in his brain. Goosesteps, salute, a twisted mirror of Steve’s smile, a familiar uniform in new colours. Hail Hydra. It’s fading fast already, with Steve smiling in civvies by his bedside.
, because he can’t lose another one tonight. He is losing his people before they have a moment to become his.
'You never said.' It's a ridiculous thing to say, because Tony never said either, but it's all he can think of. It stings a little to know they've been orbiting each other like this for who knows how long. Heroes supposedly, and yet never quite brave enough to be people.
There's a long growling sigh, and a part of Tony is relieved to recognise the frustration, half of their relationship was built on it. 'Tony please,' Steve says, 'I just want to know if you're safe.'
He knows Steve’s buttons. The pace, the pressure, the spots to focus on to wind him up until he’s desperate and out of control.
He treats Tony like he’s important. Tony is used to being someone. Flash of paparazzi bulbs, headline news, latest scandal, latest success. Someone has always been watching, looking for something from him. Never personal, just doing their job, just public interest, just, just, just. He tired of it. But this… it’s all personal. He hates it, but he’ll never tire of it.
'I'm sorry, Steve.' He doesn't say the words like they ought to sound, desperate and dying, , there's no dirt in his mouth, no rattle of unsteady breath, it's sure and strong in the way only Extremis can give him now. 'I'm so fucking sorry.' And the little shaky sound that might be strained breathing or half a sob is all him.
‘I’m going to fuck you,’ Steve says and it’s not a question, or a request. Like it doesn’t matter what Tony says because they both already know he’d never say no. And Tony doesn’t. ‘I’ve waited for this,’ Steve says, ‘watching you lying here for so long, I thought I’d missed my chance.’
Promise. He likes the sound of that. Promise, he mouths the word, doesn’t mean to speak, just enjoys the way it feels on his tongue, but Steve squeezes his fingers. ‘I promise,’ he repeats.
There's a warmth emanating from the ground now, burning the soles of his feet with the sense that he no longer belongs. He feels the undersheath shivering beneath his skin, calling to be called upon.
He thinks he'd like to get drunk. He thinks he’d like to get high. He thinks, maybe, he’d like to get one of these girls to wrap their lips around his cock.
"Oh yeah, I am peak 'okay'. Without the suit I can hardly move a muscle below the neck, but at least my chest doesn't hurt anymore."
It would be so easy to drink the rest of the whisky and pass out right here. Maybe never wake up, maybe embrace the life of the drunk street begger. He’s never been invisible before.
No one will recognise him now. No one will question the split lip still smeared with fresh blood or the cum stain on his pants.
The breathless joy of it envelopes him, because in Steve’s on words, Tony is his. Tony is at Steve’s whims and he wonders if he always has been. He resents his own vulnerability and around Steve, he’s always had something to prove, like a little kid who wants the popular boy to like him, he has always craved Steve’s approval.
Now, he fucks Tony silently and roughly, tugging at his hair and pushing his head and neck around as takes his fancy.
'I'm thinking...' Steve hesitated. 'I'm thinking this is a mess,' Steve says. 'Now, after everything, you call me up in the middle of the night and tell me you're dying and you're in love with me. You've had months to say something to me, anything, and you say this and now? Why?'
Without further explanation, Steve leans in and Tony lets it happen, telling himself he’s misunderstanding right till the moment Steve’s lips touch his. Tony wants to let it happen, wants to kiss back, wants to let his hand drift up and grip the back of Steve’s neck. Wants to let himself pretend he deserves this.
Steve kisses him again and it feels strangely distant, like he’s sealing a deal, proving a point. It’s less than a lover’s kiss, but maybe it’s too soon to expect that.
The dust doesn’t settle. It lingers in the air, catching the light of the setting sun, swirls in the wind over the battlefield, what once had been the Avengers Compound, and Steve tries not to think about how some of that dust had previously been an invading alien race.
He thinks again of Tony. Wonders if he’s fucking someone too – if he stepped out of that shining suit, as untouched as if he’d never been there. Smiled that easy smile and shrugged it all off as easy as he seems to. Steve envies him. His carefree attitude, the way life runs off him like water. Steve wants to be around him, like if he stands close enough for long enough he can absorb some of that vibrancy.
He imagines the look on Steve’s face. Resentment maybe, or the simple disappointment of someone who expected no less.
He lays back and lets Steve do what he wants, what he needs, and he thinks of his own needs and wants and they feel no different. What Steve needs, Tony needs. What Steve wants, Tony wants.
Steve holds the door only slightly ajar, so Tony can’t see who’s on the other side. They talk in hushed but sharp voices and Steve slams the door with a frustration that echoes through his whole body in a wave of tension.
“Get me a whiskey.” He gives her money, more than she needs for a couple drinks. The woman hesitates but turns to the bar without comment. “Make it a bottle.” He’s going to need more than Dutch courage to make this happen.
Tony shuts himself away from all of it. Flashes an easy smile at the paparazzi when he leaves the hospital and answers every question with a distraction. No candour now.
Tony didn’t sound angry or enraged. If anything, he sounded a little… disappointed. Sad, even. Steve suddenly felt guilty, and then angry that he felt guilty. He was allowed to feel whatever he wanted to feel.
“The only reason we lost,” said Natasha as they trooped out of the marquee, “was because Cap couldn’t think without his boner for a second.”
Steve stared at him. “Why… but what if your other one doesn’t bake well?” he asked a little hoarsely.
“He’s… he’ll be fine,” said Tony, clearing his throat. “Teenagers.” Steve nodded along, and the air was filled with an awkward silence.
But more than that, Tony seemed to be sincerely nice, something Steve could say about very few people. He’d seen Tony give children an extra slice of cake if they were being nice, and he almost always handed out fresh cups of coffee to any homeless people who happened to be outside the shop. He’d never seen Tony shout or yell at anyone, not even the woman who’d complained last week about her coffee being “too cold” and then demanded a refund. Tony had simply and politely explained to her that he couldn't do that, not if she’d already drunk it, and he’d even kicked her out with a sweet little smile on his face.
“I lost the serum, that’s what’s wrong!’ Steve exploded, glaring at Tony. “I’m tired all day, I can barely climb up the stairs without triggering an asthma attack, I hate this body, and now I don’t know if I can even…” He broke off, coughing. “Tony, I just… don’t want to, okay?”
“Welcome back, bakers, to the second week of The Great British Bake Off,” said Mary cheerfully. Clint, Thor and Tony followed her enthusiasm with cheers of their own, while Steve stood stoic and focused, as Captain America should.
There was a brief moment of silence, when neither of them realized what was going on. Tony’s eyes widened in shock, as did the stranger’s, and Tony let out a strangled “
Steve was a little ashamed of himself, but for the past couple of months, he’d often found himself distracted from his reading, instead spending his time staring at the barista who’d just recently started working at the café.
Steve stayed quiet for a moment, trying to digest everything that had just happened. “He does have a point, though.”
“I am not sure,” said Thor from where he was seated next to Steve’s bed. “It might be one of my brother’s usual jokes, but I do not believe it is anything more sinister.”
“Can we go outside?” asked Peter at breakfast the next day, the first words he’d said to his parents in almost 24 hours. Both adults eyed Peter like he was crazy.
Natasha laughed at that. “I’m sorry, tea isn’t going to stabilize anyone’s blood pressure around here,” she said, gesturing vaguely at the destruction around them.
“I don’t care, this thing tastes amazing.” He frowned at Steve, a little pout that made Steve want to kiss him right here in front of the crowd. “You’ve been holding back on us, Cap.”
“Well, if you know you won’t win, why would it be a problem to sign up?” asked Tony reasonably. “C’mon, Steve, it’s senior year. This is the last time we’ll ever be this young and carefree. This time next year, we could be doing-long distance at different colleges, and you’ll be
He taste-tested every single bowl, making sure it was the right combination of salty and buttery. He poured half the popcorn into the largest mixing bowl he could find and stowed the rest inside the oven, keeping it warm for later. Then he took a couple of minutes to pace nervously around the kitchen, scarfing down handfuls of popcorn to calm his nerves.
Steve deflated like a pricked balloon. There it was again. The dreaded F-word. And after all he’d done. Tony just thought he was being kind to him? That this was all a result of their
This was what came from accepting advice from sketchy websites, thought Steve morosely. He fiddled with the neck of his flute as he watched the party, his eyes locked on Tony. Tony, who was moving with such a perfect, effortless grace that Steve both admired and envied. Tony, who had beautiful people of both sexes clutching onto him, hanging off his every word. With that kind of selection, how could he ever see Steve as someone he’d want, ever?
First, there were the tuxes — which Tony had insisted they had custom-made, and insisted that he let Steve buy him one. Steve had given in in the end, and the royal-blue tuxedos that Tony’s personal tailor had made for them were both stylish and comfortable, but Steve had never felt more like a show clown than when he was wearing formal clothes.
if you gave me back my phone,” said Tony, taking a quick swipe at the pocket of Steve’s jacket. Steve, with his super-serum-enhanced super-reflexes, just stepped out of the way, making Tony barrel a few steps forward and tumble onto the ground. Steve burst out laughing, and a  young couple walking by stared in confusion at the dynamic duo. Steve ducked his head behind his cap.
“I am never working with Americans again,” she muttered under her breath; apparently nobody had told her about Steve’s serum-enhanced senses.
, in a way, when he was asleep. Younger, less guarded. His face didn’t have that firm set to it anymore, and his normally stoic expression was replaced with one of sleepy exhaustion.
“Shh, shh, honey. You’ve given me enough post-injury blowjobs by now that I know exactly how to make you feel better.”
“You’re ManWithAPlan,” said Tony, still shocked. It was a statement, not a question, and Steve chuckled slightly at that.
what I was doing on there, Steve? Work! I was working! You know, the thing I need to do to run my company and keep it alive? The thing that makes enough money for us to have
“Oh, shut up, kid,” said Tony, but he seemed pleased. Steve could tell, because at this point, he’d been in love with Mr. Stark for so long, he knew every minute detail about the man. “Nah, actually, keep it comin’.” He clinked their glasses together and watched as Mr. Stark downed the whole flute in one go. Steve was much more hesitant — he knew what a lightweight he was, and he’d never tried champagne before, so this was something he’d have to do slowly.
“You just love to make my job harder, don’t you?” he sighed, but he carried Tony out easily as Happy pulled up in front of the mansion, and soon had him in his bathroom, fully dressed in the bathtub.
Sighing, Steve quickly changed out of his running clothes, and went downstairs to look for his husband. He considered showering, but gave the thought up in a second. He was too cold to consider going anywhere near water right now, and it had been so cold outside that he’d barely worked up a sweat anyway.
Steve made as if to run forward, to stop Tony and whatever this mess was, but Natasha placed a soft hand on his arm. “Let them have their fun,” she said, smirking as the sound of Clint falling down the vent spread across the room. “You know you’re not gonna stop any of them.”
Rhodey snorted. “After we watched you almost kill yourself, I think we’ve earned the right to worry about you,” he said, firm but kind. “Just… let go of Steve for one night, okay? See if you can’t make this work out. This guy sounds like he’d be perfect for you.”
“Thor does that sometimes. You learn to live with it.” He walked around to Thor’s station, where the god was pulling out a pie that was, well, not uncooked. He looked happily around at everyone’s awe-struck faces.
he was. Their relationship was public knowledge, Steve knew, but the fact thatTony was willing to be so…
“Right.” Tony couldn’t help the pacing though, walking around outside the operating room like he’d downed a gallon of coffee.
“Let’s get out of here,” Tony mumbled, pulling at Steve’s arm, and this time, Steve allowed himself to be led, following Tony quickly as they escaped the range of the cameras around them.
“Little underdone, isn’t it?” Fury commented mildly, poking at the middle of Tony’s brownie with a fork. Even from four feet away, Steve could see the insides were liquid and sticky, only just managing to hold their shape.
“Sorry, the beds might be a little too small for you, Cap,” said Clint, breezing in with his arms full of pillows and sheets. “The kids are sleeping in the attic and Laura and I are on the couch, but Nat called dibs on our bedroom, so you and Tony get this one.”
“It’s only weird because you’re American, Clint,” snapped Peter, who was in full Spider-Man costume. He was fiddling with his phone, not having to go through hair and makeup with the rest of the crowd. “It was always called the Bake Off, but they changed the name in America because we’re too stupid.”
,” said Steve earnestly. He pulled his cap down to cover more of his face as a large group of tourists walked past. “That’s kind of the whole point of London. History in every street sign and whatnot.”
Clint was the first to stand up after the movie was done, much to everyone’s surprise, since he was usually the person staying until after the credits, boring everyone with his knowledge of the movie industry. Today, he stood up and ran across the room.
“I’m so sorry,” Steve whispered as soon as the judges’ backs were turned. “It’s my fault, I shouldn’t have taken your second batch.”
“The fourth best pie of the day was Clint’s, much to my surprise,” said Fury. “Your filling was runny and your dough was all wrong, but you made a pie we could actually eat, so you’re moving on.” Clint grinned around at everyone like he hadn’t known this was coming.
“What Cap means to say,” said Tony smoothly, rescuing Steve from having to say anything at all, “Is that we let you idiots hijack our date, and we’d like a little alone time now, if you don’t mind. And leave the popcorn, Thor.” Clint gagged and rushed out of the room making fake vomit noises, like the mature adult he was. Thor left as well, pouting because he wasn’t allowed to take the popcorn.
He heard Clint stifle a laugh behind him, and he had to suppress the urge to grin. In front of him, Mary was having the time of her life with his pie.
, he scolded himself, stopping his pacing abruptly. He grabbed the mixing bowl filled to the brim with popcorn and stalked back outside.
“This is wonderful! Your filling is exquisite, and the crust is technically perfect. One of the best pies I’ve seen in this competition by far!”
“Let’s hope he doesn’t rip his shirt in half like he did last year,” agreed Tony, settling into Steve’s side.
“You’re not allowed in the Tower until you go out and get me some real coffee, Barton,” Tony growled, panting and exhausted. “Don’t tell me Hawkeye can’t see in a blizzard.” Clint’s indignant protests floated out of the vent, but Tony moved to stomp on his fingers, and after a pained yell, Barton and his handkerchief disappeared, presumably to get coffee. Tony and Thor high-fived each other as Steve watched in exasperation.
“Now Nick and I had a bit of a disagreement over the third best pie, but in the end, we decided this baker deserved to move on. Congratulations, Thor!” Thor beamed at the cameras as well, as everyone clapped half-heartedly from around them.
“Calm down, Tony,” said Bruce, wrapping a still–pale green arm around his friend. “He’ll be okay. He may have had health risks in the 40’s, but… modern medicine, right?”
“How long is this taking?” he exploded, after about five hours of pacing. He was still in the undersuit he wore with the armour, and he’d categorically refused to leave to go change. “What the fuck am I paying these doctors for if they can’t even fix Steve up?”
Steve took advantage of the awkwardness to sneak a glance at Tony, who was huddled over his coffee, deliberately missing Steve’s eye. He looked tired, and his eyes were red; neither of them had slept well last night, for obvious reasons.
It was not at all what Tony had been used to, and it wasn’t the Steve he’d grown to love. Still, this body held a certain… attraction for him as well.
“I’m not,” mumbled Tony quietly. “I’m fine. Just cold.” He muttered, “and terrified,” under his breath.
He took a second to glance up at Tony, and smirked. Tony was, in theory, kneading his dough, but more often than not, he stopped to stare at Steve, completely pausing his work to drool over Steve’s biceps. More than once, Steve noticed one of the other Avengers having to roughly poke Tony in the side to get him to turn back to his dough, and invariably, Tony would be back to staring in five minutes.
“That’s fine. Thanks Clint,” said Steve sincerely. “You know Tony and I can sleep on the couch, right? I’ll even take the floor if you want. Laura can have the bed.” Clint waved his concerns away dismissively.
Finally, the corsages. Steve had elected not to buy one for Tony, figuring they were just for girls, but
While that feeling hadn’t really left him since he’d come here, he had to admit it was a lot better when he was surrounded by his friends and teammates, rather than polite but unknown SHIELD agents. And it was all thanks to Tony.
“Tony, stop,” said Steve when he was finally able to get a word in. “What’s— why’re you apologizing? I should be apologizing to
Steve was confused, and maybe a little woozy from the rollercoaster of emotions he’d felt today. “Tony, wait — what do you mean good enough for me?”
“Weirdly enough, I like dating you too.” Tony pulled the blanket towards them and rested his head on Steve’s shoulder. “You’re very nice to look at. And sleep on.”
He focused on his dough, trying not to think about Tony at all. For the next half an hour, he kept his gaze fixed firmly on either the dough or the multiple cameramen around them, who were too hot and sweaty to be conducive to any sexy thoughts.
Steve smiled wider than he had all evening, offering his hand to Tony. Tony accepted, blushing prettily, and Steve led him to the dance floor, standing in position as the music picked up.
They had broken up, and it was Tony’s doing. He couldn’t sit here and mope about it, not anymore, and definitely not when he was about to go on a date with someone else.
“Look, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I said that stuff to you, I know we were fighting, but it wasn’t fair of me. I’m sorry I’ve ignored you this whole time; that was my mistake and not yours and I fully understand why you didn’t tell me about the cat. I’m sorry I overreacted about the cat in the first place. Like you said, it didn’t do any harm.”
“My scans indicate that this kitten has had a very positive effect on your mental health, Captain. I would advise you to keep it.”
“You can’t bench me! I’m your Captain!” yelled Steve, and the Avengers, including Tony, had to try their best to hold in their giggles. The sight of their tiny, scrawny captain yelling at Nick Fury and asking to lead the team was almost hilarious.
So that was how Steve Rogers ended up taking a quick shower in Tony Stark’s en-suite, soon deeply asleep on the couch in Tony’s room.
Steve held his breath, trying to hold his hands steady so he wouldn’t spill any of the popcorn. He’d started out making just a little bit, enough for him and Tony to share, but then he remembered exactly how much of a popcorn hog Tony really was, and he’d kept adding more and more kernels to the pot until he pretty much had a factory’s worth of popcorn.
was gonna be daddy,” Tony griped, shifting ever so slightly so he could support Peter’s head. “You’re his papa.”
He’d brought the kitten back to the Tower with every intention of feeding him up a bit, and then asking Jarvis for a list of the best kitty shelters around the Tower. It’d been almost a week now, and well… Steve had to admit he was getting a little attached.
Tony cheerfully flipped them off, quickly pulling his hand down when he realized Peter was part of the crowd.
Steve sniffled, his brows knitted tightly together, but he relaxed further into Tony. Tony pulled Steve’s head down to rest in the crook of his shoulder, and even as he felt the wet tears run down his neck, he knew Steve was feeling better.
Behind them, Peter sniffled, quietly enough that almost no one but his Papa could hear him. Teenage boys had to keep up appearances, after all. A quick glance to the rearview mirror confirmed that Peter’s eyes were indeed red, and Tony, who was looking outside the window and studiously avoiding his family, looked as guilty as Steve felt.
“I mean—” Steve broke off a small bit and ate it; undercooked food couldn’t harm him anyway. “It doesn’t taste that bad, Tony. They actually taste really good.”
“Hmm, yes, street sign,” Tony mumbled, engrossed once more in his phone. Steve glared at him, then snatched the phone out of his hands. “Hey!”
“Damn,” said Tony, looking frustrated. It was a very cute look on him, Steve decided. “I was hoping your magic hands could fix this somehow.”
“No,” said Tony, whose eyes were now shining, and who seemed on the verge of sobbing as well. “No, Steve, this is perfect, don’t you dare…”
He pulled away soon, a huge, excited grin still on his face. As Tony released his arms from around Steve’s neck, Steve caught a split-second look at his face — his wide, excited grin, just for Steve; the delighted twinkle of his eyes; the pure
“You should have fucking tried harder,” growled Tony, his heart thumping. Even a supersoldier couldn’t survive a hit to the head, or a falling beam through a vital organ, or any of the million other things that could happen to someone stuck under the rubble of a collapsed building.
“Mr. Thor, this isn’t a brownie, this is a biscuit,” said Mary, breathing a little heavily after her futile attempts to cut a square out of the thick slab of brown chocolate. “And a biscuit that’s completely burnt through, at that.”
“Tony wouldn’t say no. He’s let us do anything and everything we want in here. Compared to Clint’s popcorn machine, a kitten isn’t even that bad.”
“Tony, I already have to deal with one child this weekend, don’t make me have to deal with two,” sighed Steve. He spared half a second’s glance at his husband before setting his eyes firmly on the road. Tony scowled from his seat beside Steve’s. Behind them, Peter fidgeted nervously, like he always did when his dads got angry. It was one of the things his therapist had pointed out specifically.
“I just mean,” he said, trying to get the words right, “I like dating you. Even if we’ve only been doing it for thirty minutes.”
“My point exactly,” smiled Steve, accepting Tony’s quick kiss to his nose. It was funny because Tony had to lean up to the very tip of his toes to reach Steve’s nose, and even then he couldn’t reach it until Steve took pity on him and leaned slightly down. Steve always took pity on him.
“I can’t belive this stupid body doesn’t even let me have sex,” grumbled Steve, “And I’m sorry you couldn’t finish, Tony.”
“We’re going to have so much fun with you! Oh, watch out, you might want to stay under the awning, we don’t want any moisture getting in your lovely hair…”
“No wonder you have so many daddy issues, Barton,” Tony snarked, while Steve looked around the room in complete confusion. Nobody even seemed surprised by Clint’s announcement; in fact, they seemed more annoyed by him than anything.
“Do you like it?” Steve asked shyly. “I, uh… let myself go a little bit. After we broke up.” He broke eye contact with Tony, staring awkwardly at the table in front of him. “Bucky helped me get my head on straight, but I kept the beard. I like it better.”
Bucky Jr., seemingly noting his father’s distress, climbed up the couch and settled himself on Steve’s knee, looking at him with an inquiring eye.
“It’s something that always confused me about cooking shows,” he started, “How am I supposed to give you soundbites today when I don’t know what my food will be like tomorrow?” The adults in the room had to stifle their laughter.
When there was no part of his body he could conceivably clean anymore, he wrapped a towel around himself and walked out of the bathroom. The Avengers had changed in and out of their suits in front of each other so many times that he was no longer embarrassed.
“What did I do—” Clint took a cautious bite out of his brownies, and grimaced. “Okay, that’s fair.” Tony and Steve looked at each other, confused, but Clint quickly spelled it out for them, and no doubt for the cameras’ benefit as well. “I must’ve mixed up the salt and the sugar.” He groaned, dropping his face into his hands. “I can’t believe I did something so
“You need — to see —” he gasped, pushing the phone towards Mary and Nick. The tent had gone quiet now, everyone staring at Noel with varying degrees of concern and confusion.
“Peter, honey, no!” Steve hugged his son tight, his anger vanishing in his need to make his son feel better. “This has nothing to do with… adopting you was the best decision we’ve ever made.”
Now that Steve thought about it, it really shouldn’t really have been a surprise. He’d been lonely and a little depressed ever since the Battle of New York, and it was only a matter of time before he’d need to find someone to help him through it.
When Steve had finally got his breathing in order, Tony brought him a cup of cold water and a quick handjob, trying to take the edge off.
Steve stayed perched in his chair, watching his son and his husband. His son and his husband; the two people he loved the most. The two people he’d caused so much hurt to over the last few years. How could he forget how much he loved them?
“No, it’ll go perfect with my blueberry filling, thanks Steve,” said Tony enthusiastically. He made a leap for the ball of dough, but Steve held it just just slightly above his reach, a shit-eating grin on his face.
“Oh, fuck the phone,” said Tony impatiently. “I have a million more. I’m more worried about the tourists.” He pressed his face into Steve’s shirt, grumbling. “I’ve never been more embarrassed in my life.”
He stormed away to his room, only calmed when he felt the kitten wrap itself around his neck, his cool fur gently cooling Steve down as well. He didn’t need to tell Tony; Tony had much more important things to do, like ignoring Steve and acting like a complete ass. Steve, on the other hand, could now get down the most pressing business he had: what to name the kitten.
Peter smiled, a wet, weak smile, but still a smile. It made Steve feel so much happier, too. He hadn’t seen his baby boy smile for a long time, he realized.
Steve raised the champagne flute up high, like he’d seen them do in old movies. “Happy Birthday, Mr. Stark,” he said, throwing a shy smile the man’s way as he gulped it down. “You don’t look a day over forty.”
“Take a chill pill, Nick, we didn’t do anything too bad.” A team of makeup artists and hair stylists had descended on Tony now, trying desperately to fix his hair in the thirty seconds before the cameras turned back on.
“I helped Tony out because he was struggling!” said Steve, grateful that the night sky hid the blush on his cheeks. “I didn’t do it because—”
“I know what you mean,” said Tony, who rested his head on Steve’s chest. “Years of this shit… and all we had to do to fix it was say sorry.” He smiled. “Funny how the kid figured it out before we did.”
“Well, that is a big disappointment, Tony, they did seem wonderfully well done on the outside.” Mary patted Tony’s back in a gentle, motherly fashion, and sampled a small bit of the brownie edge, which was the only part that was cooked through. “Pity, it tastes so wonderful too.” Tony looked appropriately ashamed, grumbling to himself as the judges moved on to Thor and Clint’s station.
when he’d promised himself not two minutes ago that he’d stop. Still, try as he might, it wasn’t easy. Everything around him reminded him of Steve, from the flowers on the table, which were the exact same shade of blue as Steve’s eyes, to the young man who’d just walked in, who looked amazingly similar to Steve. In fact, Tony thought, looking at him closer, this was an almost exact doppelgänger, down to the floppy blond hair, the little crinkles in his smile. Everything except for the beard.
“Steve—” Tony tried, but his husband only held onto him harder. They were pressed so close, he could feel Steve’s tears wet his own cheeks.
“The Queen of Hearts was the villain in that book, Tony,” smiled Steve, but the smile disappeared almost as quickly as it came. “Tony… you’re delirious.”
Steve sat there the rest of the night, wallowing in his thoughts. He hated parties anyway, he’d only come to this one because it was for Tony, and he’d go home right now if he didn’t know Tony would need him afterwards. His official job title might have been Tony’s ‘Personal Assistant’, but this job went way outside what it had said in the job description.
“You did good, big guy,” he said, trying not to let the amusement show on his face. Steve, on the other hand, was a little more than excited. Tony’s brownies
Clint popped out, shutting the door behind him, leaving Steve and Tony alone together for the first time all day. The smile had vanished off of Tony’s face and he was back to glaring at Steve, almost challenging him. Still, after the day they’d had, Steve didn’t feel like fighting anymore.
“Now this looks wonderful,” Mary gushed, picking the loaf of bread gently. “The texture is exquisite, and the colour is almost perfect. I”m glad I haven’t eaten all day, I could just devour this myself.”
Steve could see Tony was close to the boiling point, and placed a gentle hand on his shoulder to help him calm down. “It’s okay, honey,” he said, as softly as possible. “We can have some of Bruce’s tea instead. Maybe that’s good for you, really; it’ll help you relax better.” Tony brushed his arm off, glaring at Steve like an angry little kitten. Steve had never seen anything more adorable.
Still, if Tony had expected a booming sex life with this new, more attractive version of Steve, he was sadly mistaken. Not only could this Steve not finish a single round of sex withour having an asthma attack, it was also getting harder for him to maintain an erection for very long. He was soon becoming less and less interested in sex, something Tony had never thought he’d say about Steve “I can go ten rounds and still have enough energy to make us dinner” Rogers. Where their nights used to be slow, excitement-filled nights of passion, Tony now had to practically beg Steve to give him so much as a blowjob.
Steve couldn’t make head or tail of what Tony was saying, but he listened as Tony continued on in an unbroken flow.
Tony looked at himself, like he couldn’t really comprehend what Steve was saying. “You… carried me home?”
to. So he got the full blast of it when Tony picked his phone up and all that was visible were thin cracks running up the glass, spider-webbing out to make a pattern Steve sincerely hoped he wasn’t really seeing.
“Well, you already know the part about the knife stuck in your leg,” said Helen Cho, consulting her notes at the side of Steve’s hospital bed. “Actually, I’m not sure how much you know — what’s the last thing you remember before waking up here, Captain?”
He arranged the round loaf on a tray, quickly perfecting the slits he’d made before. He’d just cut the last slit when Fury called for them to stop.
“Tony, honey, I’m so sorry—” Steve started, but Tony wasn’t listening to a word he was saying; he continued speaking like he couldn’t see Steve or his phone or the people that had now formed a very large ring around them — they’d definitely been recognized now.
Clint and Wanda seemed to have done the best, at least at first glance. Their pies looked clean and crispy, and neither of their cooking stations was a disaster area. Steve crossed his fingers as Mary cut into Clint’s pie, praying for it to not be better than his.
Steve had to confess he was disappointed, but he knew Tony was right; they didn’t want to reveal anything to the others too early. So they settled back in their respective spots, trying to act like any other normal people watching a movie, but under the blanket, Steve’s hand never left Tony’s waist. Even when they’d paused the movie halfway through for Steve to fetch the rest of the popcorn, Steve’s hands returned right to their spot under Tony’s shirt, simply enjoying the feel of his soft skin and defined muscles.
“Fine!” Fury exclaimed, rolling his eyes in what may have been the most blatant show of emotion Tony had ever seen the man display. “You can go, Captain Rogers, and I cannot wait to say “I told you so” when you get hurt in some way.”
“I… I’m sorry Tony,” said Steve haltingly. Under the layer of constant pain, Steve felt an overwhelming wave of guilt wash over him. Tony had done so much for him; was it so hard for Steve to lie down like a good little boy and accept his pampering?
“She says she sleeps down there all the time anyway. Better for her back or something.” He looked disgusted. “After all the energy I put into dragging that mattress home from the dumpster, too.”
“It probably would be less cold than it is here,” Peter mumbled. Steve felt the guilt overwhelm him again, but he also felt his fatherly instincts rise.
The boys, Steve knew, were the ones who couldn’t get dates to Homecoming, and so had come together in a pack. Personally, Steve thought they were nice people, but they were too painfully shy to ever even talk to a girl, let alone ask one out. Tony seemed to understand this too, and he and Steve made a silent agreement to keep the boys company, and to tamp down on their couple-y behaviour in order to spare their feelings.
“You didn’t seem to think that when you were fucking me six ways to Sunday!” Steve glared at him, a manic glint in his eyes. “If I’m fit enough to have sex with you, I’m fit enough to go on a mission.”
Steve clenched his hands around the edge of the counter, willing it not to crack under his fingers. Tony had shuffled closer to him at this point, and Steve could almost literally feel the tension and the suspense Tony was feeling.
“Take her!” one of the stylists yelled from behind them. She pulled Wanda, who looked pleased but confused, to the front of the marquee. “We’ve finally got her hair to stay down and I don’t know how long it’ll take to look like Einstein again, so for the love of God, interview her before I have to go to war with her hair again.”
Mary was now very specifically instructing them that all dough had to be kneaded by hand, and he most definitely had an advantage in that area, too. If he’d deliberately worn a two-sizes-too-small, figure-hugging polo to set today with the sole intention of making his arms seem bigger… well that was nobody else’s concern.
