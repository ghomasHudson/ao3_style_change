"It will, eventually. In some worlds, the planet dies when it collides with another. These are called the Incursions. In other realities, the Earth is consumed by the sun when the sun goes supernova. And, in one reality I can think of... the planet and it's population are decimated by global nuclear warfare. There's no telling the fate of this universe." She goes quiet and allows the information to sink in.
“Former team? Against him? They have. They are. I bet you didn’t know that the stocks for Stark Industries are plummeting, the company is being forced to do budget cuts, accept low-profit deals, lay off staff, and– Pepper Potts, the CEO, is being hounded by the board to fire and cut all ties with the current head of the R&D department of SI. I bet you can guess who the head of that department is, Steve.” Cho doesn’t mince her words. Tony’s team has been blinded for too long to everything that he does for them. Helen will not stand for it any longer. She won’t.
“Over your right shoulder, right? ‘Cause it would be kinda hard to look over your left shoulder because of the eye patch,” Tony added helpfully. “You could do it, but you’d have to turn a lot more, and that sounds pretty exhausting.”
“Anytime, kid. Just do me a favor and stay safe,” he responded, saluting. They skedaddled off quickly, and he turned – just to be greeted with a familiar face.
“She’s going to be as bad as you one day,” Pepper said, her eyes sparkling warmly as she moved to sit on Tony’s work table. Tony smiled, taking one of her hands and tracing the fingers.
He just stood there, mouth opening and closing like a fish before he finally managed to gather himself enough to give his daughter a hard look. Her face was utterly serious, completely and utterly confident in her words. Tony was struck, not for the first time and certainly not for the last, by just how amazing his daughter was, giving him her
Natasha turned slightly when Steve and Rhodey rushed into the room, glancing around before coming to stand by Tony. She nodded at them, turning back to face the screens. “Alright, everyone’s here, Captain. Tell them what you told me.”
“I can really come stay with you? For how long?” His voice wavered, clearly on the verge between hope and tears, and Tony felt the sudden desperate need to hug him tightly and refuse to ever let go.
“I’ve got eyes on Cap,” Rhodey called. “Looks like Thor and Valkyrie are close, and Nebula’s not too far off either.”
“Yes, you dumbass, I like you too. God, I feel like a third grader saying that,” Tony muttered the second part mostly to himself, but then he was distracted by Steve’s sudden bright beaming smile.
And Pepper knew it, too, because she smiled at him, gently, so gently. “Tony, look at me,” she said, her voice soft, and he tried, head lolling her way and eyes locking onto her, willing her to be the last thing he ever saw. “We’re going to be okay. You can rest now.”
“She’s still sleeping. Little tyke must’ve finally hit her limit and conked out hard – she never sleeps this late,” Rhodey responded. Tony tried not to look disappointed.
was there, either physically or via uplink. Natasha had found her way to the center of the room, their unofficial organizer and she’d been in his previous world. Thor and Bruce were huddled in one corner muttering quietly to each other and exchanging worried looks. On the screens were Ayo, Wong, Carol, Rocket, and a couple of people he didn’t recognize. Nebula was glaring stoically at the screens, standing apart from everyone, and Tony approached to stand by her.
. It’s not what a Pepper of any world would have wanted, and he may not know what the hell was going on for everything to be so similar but so different from the world in which he’d just
, and you were going to just do it anyway?” Tony was frozen, unable to do anything but listen as Harley raged, and then the kid started pounding Tony’s chest with his words, metal ringing through the crumbled ruins. “You were going to
“Sorry, Boss, Peter asked me to play some of his voice recordings if I ever saw a situation that demanded it,” FRIDAY said apologetically.
Harley and Peter were at the front of the pack, beaming at him and not even looking slightly chagrined. Nebula was standing with her arms crossed slightly behind them, glaring at the back of their heads. Morgan was standing slightly behind Nebula, brown eyes eyeing Tony a little more…contemplatively.
destroy the stones – it was as though something was interfering, the energies turning away from each other and unable to be redirected. They did much the same thing when I tried to use them to will you out of existence,” he snarled, and Tony blinked.
And he punctuated the last word with a particularly hard hit that made Tony stumble back a couple of steps, Steve stepping forward with some concern, but Tony waved him off without taking his eyes off Harley. Harley stared at him for a moment more, fury and pain warring in his eyes, and then he launched himself at Tony – and flung his arms around Tony’s midsection, burying his face in Tony’s still-armored chest. “Don’t you
He turned to Rhodey, knowing if he spent any longer looking into Steve’s anguished eyes, he would lose his nerve. “Take care of my kids, okay?”
“There’s the Tony I know,” Rhodey said triumphantly when Tony went to fill the coffeemaker with water and accidentally slopped half of it down the side of the machine. Tony lazily flipped him off, yawning as he grabbed a paper towel and started mopping up the water before turning on the machine.
“Alright, you four get to Captain Rogers as soon as possible. Steve, wait for Colonel Rhodes and the others to join you before engaging, clear?”
“What about you?” he prompted. At Steve’s confused look, he clarified. “What were you thinking about?”
hope you guys enjoy!! if you have any other requests, please feel free to drop a comment! I've got a word doc with all the requests so far, for anyone who's already requested something, and I'm working my way through them :D thank you guys so much for sharing all your ideas!!! love y'all <333
, especially once the Avengers Initiative got up and running again, far more functional than the first time around. They were united, now, bonded in a way that only seeing some of their worst fears come to life and be powerless to stop it could make them.
“You’re not just ‘some old man,’ Tony,” Steve said quietly. “You’re one of the smartest men alive, and you’re also the only one who saw the armies the Chitauri had in that wormhole. Those two facts alone should’ve made us listen to you, not even mentioning the fact that you were our teammate.”
“You two are dumb,” Morgan declared, folding her arms and rolling her eyes and looking every inch like Tony’s daughter. “She was really, really happy, she just shows it differently than you two idiots.”
“We know,” Wong said, his voice grave – though that was always the case with Wong, in Tony’s experience. “I am assembling the other sorcerers at the Sanctum.”
?” Harley asked incredulously, helmet retracting momentarily to show a cheeky smile as he hovered a few feet away from Tony, who sighed.
“Tony?” she’d breathed, eyes wide like she was afraid if she closed them, she’d find out she was dreaming. “
But he forced himself to answer truthfully, forced himself not to sugarcoat it or hide anything from his kid. “If it meant protecting you? You and your brother and sisters? Yeah. Yeah, just like that, Pete,” he said, his voice quiet but firm, holding Peter’s eyes.
They flew into utter chaos. Manhattan was on fire, both literally and figuratively. Chitauri were everywhere, the giant ships raining ammo from the skies as the ones on speeders caused havoc closer to the ground. The city looked closer to a scene out of a post-apocalyptic horror movie than like the Manhattan he’d known growing up. The sorcerers had already arrived and brought with them the Dora Milaje
“How are you feeling, Cap?” Tony’s gentle whisper was a thunder clap in the quiet that had settled over them thick as storm clouds. A spike of disappointment was a lightning strike in his chest. Tony had stopped moving his hands. They now lay still, resting at his shoulder blades. Time, it would seem, was up. He squeezed his eyes shut tightly at the realization that he didn’t want it to end.
Steve hesitated. Not a lot of people knew what had happened that year. Steve told the story only two times since then, once to his original team (Natasha, Clint and Bruce) and once to Peggy. They were also the only people who knew what exactly had happened (with Bucky, who was there). Everyone else knew the watered down version of the story that Clint and Natasha spread around.
Iron Man threw his hands out as if in surrender, “Hey, just thought I’d point out you got that last wire wrong. Wouldn’t want you to crash because your pride didn’t allow you to accept help.”
The coffee shop across the Tower was big and expensive, not usually Steve’s type. But he was already there and the view was amazing, so he decided to treat himself.
“Can you disarm it?” asked Natasha. She seemed to be the only one still collected enough to talk, Clint and Steve looking at the bomb helplessly.
They waited mostly in silence, Thor and Clint the only ones in the mood for a conversation. Natasha kept shooting Steve glances every now and then but Steve ignored her. He knew what she wanted to say.
He was sitting sideways, his head on the back of couch as he watched Tony talk with big hand gestures and bright eyes.  There was an energy to him that Steve couldn’t help but admire and despite the late hour, neither of them was particularly tired.
). Steve tried to initiate civil conversations a few times but it was strained and Tony could admit that that was probably his fault. Bruce told him he should get over it and just talk to the guy, but Tony couldn't. It hurt him that Steve didn't trust him outside the suit and his comment hit a little too close to home (it also reminded Tony of that other sentence uttered all that time ago. ‘
And it was true. He spent most of those two years on the run thinking about it. If they weren’t both so stubborn, if they just communicated better. If Steve wasn’t such a coward. If he wasn’t so terrified of just being in the room with Tony back then, because he was still scared of his feelings, that thing in his chest that ached every time Tony looked in his direction.
“It doesn’t matter,” Tony said, looking at him earnestly. “I want to know everything about you and the place where you live is a part of that.”
“In my defense,” said Tony, laughing as well, “I was a kid at the time, so your friend still has no excuse.”
Tony being lucky (or unlucky in this case) managed to be the first one to get through all the doombots and close in on Doom all the while reassuring Steve that he was going to be fine when the other man yelled at him to be safe.
“You’re no fun,” he muttered, then said louder, “I’ve narrowed down the place of the meeting. We could go today, start at opposite sides and move to the center, trapping them in the middle. Should be fairly easy to subdue them.”
“We’ll brief him before we move tonight. Hopefully there’ll be enough time,” Steve said. He was learning to pick his battles.
Whiskey felt bitter on his tongue and not for the first time Steve regretted his inability to get drunk.
Steve used to blame Bucky for what he did that night. Sacrificing himself so that everyone could live. He’d have to stop doing that. It would make him a hypocrite, after today.
“What? Where are you? What is Loki doing?” It was perhaps worrying that Tony was so glad to hear the coldness in Steve’s voice replaced with worry.
“We are not telling Iron Man,” Steve said. He knew it would be the smart thing to do. And Clint was right, if anyone could breach Tony’s security, it would be Iron Man. But Iron Man was also a loose cannon. If Steve told him to leave Tony alone until they had more information, he wasn’t sure that Iron Man would listen. And if Iron Man decided that Tony was guilty here, who knows what he would do to him. Steve couldn’t let that happen. “Besides, I have a different idea.”
Tony bit his lip. “Actually, I was thinking… And you can say no if you want. But maybe we could go to your place this time?”
Steve knew, throughout all those years, that there will have to come a day when they will be given an opportunity to fix what Thanos did. To undo it. Steve knew in his soul that they had to at least try, no matter the cost.
Tony was an answer as well, to a different question, a question that a dream once asked and hadn't had the time to answer.
Once they were back at their quarters, Steve followed him to his room, and Tony's hopes that he won't be that mad about Tony's burst of heroism were squished to dust once he saw the look on his face.
“It’s just, you seem…” Clint paused, as if looking for a word, then turned toward Natasha, “What’s the word, Tasha?”
"You probably don't remember, but a few years ago, I disappeared for 3 months. Then I came back, as if nothing had happened, and the whole thing was swept under a rug. A few months later, Obbie died." Tony looked at Steve, and his eyes were vulnerable. He was opening up, Steve realized. And though he was mad and hurt and confused, Steve wanted to listen to him. He wanted to know what really happened.
Tony shrugged. He didn’t seem at all concern about the fact that they were tied up, unable to escape.
And it was all his fault. He was the one who invited Tony to his base, who told him about the Mandarin. He was the reason Tony went searching for his weapons.
He was given a clean bill of health (well, Bruce recommended rest because of his slight head injury but it wasn't like Tony was going to listen to him) and by the time they all got back to the Tower, Tony was ready to forget the accident had ever happened.
They somehow stumbled into Tony's bedroom, his bed. Steve didn’t notice much, apart from the fact that the bed was huge and expensive. But nothing about the rest of the room registered in his mind. It was a little disconcerting, because Steve was the guy who noticed everything, knew all the possible exits and items that could be used as weapons, when he was only five seconds into the room. But it was like none of it mattered now, the feel of Tony's hands on his bare skin after getting his shirt off the only thing worth noticing.
“I just think you could do better.” He closed the space between them, and they were close, so close, not yet touching but even a minimal shift could bring their bodies together. “So much better,” he whispered. “Don't you?”
Steve was an old-fashioned guy, but he could see how a building like that belonged to a man like Tony Stark. The man was not called a futurist for no reason.
“You're right, I'm sorry,” he signed and turned sideways so that he was looking at her (and if from the corner of his eye he could still see the two figures pressed together laughing, nobody had to know).
Tony glared at JARVIS’s nearest camera. “Tell him I’m doing something dangerous and it’s not safe to come inside.”
He was never letting go of him again. He lost him once, and he wasn’t going to do it again. He was happy for Tony and Pepper. Just being back in Tony’s life, being his friend, was the most important thing in Steve’s life, and nothing could ever change that.
“Actually I was thinking he could take you two with him,” Steve said. He wasn't even looking at Tony.
“Thanks for the tip,” she hugged him then said quick hellos to the others. “So, Steve,” she turned to him. “I saw what was in there,” she said quietly. She was looking at him like she was worried he was going to break any moment now.
Steve breathed a sigh of relief. The minions they captured that day in Hell’s Kitchen had to be left behind, since they attracted quite the commotion and they couldn’t risk bringing them on board. Steve knew that leaving them with their friends from Hell’s Kitchen was the right choice, and he trusted them to take care of it, but he was still eager to start the investigation themselves. One of them will have to talk sooner or later, and it will bring them one step closer to Hammer and the Mandarin.
“Down to business already, huh? People usually offer me a drink first, you know,” Iron Man said, amused.
Didn't mean the situation didn't go downhill (and it did, much sooner than even Tony had predicted).
She gave him a small smile, and everyone else was more into the idea once they knew she supported it.
“Which one exactly? Iron Man or Tony Stark? Or does she know you’re one and the same? Crap, everyone will know I’m the Captain now as well,” Steve felt a moment of panic wash over him before Tony spoke.
"He was someone who helped me during those three months in the cave. He died saving my life. So you see, when I care about people, they either betray me or they die because of me. Being alone seemed like a great option when those were your choices."
Tony nodded. Last night was a maze of confusion but he remembered every word Steve said to him like it was branded on his brain.
“Why not?” she asked. “I’m not saying you should tell him right away. But if it does get serious and you’ll trust him enough to keep your secrets, well…”
Tony didn’t speak first, not giving them the satisfaction of asking what he was doing there. Steve as a leader was supposed to be the first one to speak, but he was frozen on the spot since the moment he set eyes on Tony.
“It’s okay, it’s refreshing to have someone be so blunt with me. But to answer your question, the advantage is that when you appear to be like everyone else the interest in you decreases.”
biased. He wanted Tony to be innocent. Because he liked Tony. More than he liked anyone in a very long time. More than he wanted to admit, even to himself.
Because at the end of the day, what Bucky did that faithful day, years prior, was the right choice to make. And so was yours.
Steve couldn’t see Clint but he assumed the archer had found some high ground from where he could better see the flow of the crowd.
“It’s just… You seemed to get along with everyone except me. It was like I was the only one you didn’t like. And I think that bothered me more than I was willing to admit.”
“I’m not comfortable with that,” Steve said. It made him uneasy, thinking about breaching Tony’s privacy like that, betraying his trust.
The gala was for a charity. It was a huge event in one of the biggest hotels in Manhattan and almost everyone who was important in the business world was there. There were paparazzi everywhere and Steve got sick of watching these people pose and smile for the cameras, pretending they were there for the charity and not just the good press and good wine.
Tony laughed bitterly. “What do you think?” he was staring at Steve, at his blond hair and blue eyes. He was only inches away from him, but it felt like miles.
“But Tony,” Steve took Tony’s hands in his own, drawing strength from the familiarity of holding them, “I don’t want to assume anything anymore. I want to get to know you. Every side of you. I want to go out there and know that you’re with me, watching my six. And me watching yours. You were right when you said that I tend to do things alone. Even with the team, no matter how much I trust them, my default was always to try and take care of things my way, keep as much of the fight on myself and not get anyone involved more than necessary. But I want that to change. I want us to be together completely. To trust each other. To be able to go out in the field and know that the other is right there.”
The agents (or whatever they really were, but Tony was fond of thinking of them as Japanese SHIELD) were dragging the terrorist away and soon paramedics were there and then Tony was led from the room, Steve at his heels, to the lobby where they checked his injury. They gave him a couple of stitches and some painkillers and then he was good to go.
Steve sensed there was more to it. “As far as I know, the public interest in you has always been very high.”
Vague voices were getting closer now but Tony couldn't focus, he had to keep himself from freaking out, had to show the others he wasn't broken.
"I was waiting for you," Steve said, the realization catching him off guard and spilling past his lips.
“I’m sure he’s doing his best,” said Natasha, smirking. For some reason it always brought her joy to push Steve’s buttons when it came to Iron Man.
Tony chuckled. "And you know, I had a 1932's Ford Flathead Roadster and it looked badass and I wanted the armor to be badass."
“Like I said, you need to talk to him Steve. This is getting out of control and you know it will affect the team.”
Steve told him. Tony didn’t seem surprised about the SHIELD mole. He didn’t seem surprised that Steve let himself get captured so that his team could get away.
After, you think about what you could have done differently. You analyze every moment, every second, and think,
There was a noise coming toward them, and Tony pushed Steve into a small room. They waited, holding their breath, until they heard the guards getting closer. Just as they were about to come into view, Tony jumped out, knocking one of them out with his gauntlet. Steve joined him, thankful for the fight.
“So, does that mean you guys are okay?” Natasha asked. Everyone seemed to realize at once that Tony Stark being Iron Man would only complicate their relationship considering Steve’s previous feelings toward their armored ally.
“You know I love you, right?” he said, the words a whisper. And it was like he could breathe easier, ready to face every monster, because it didn’t matter anymore. All that mattered was that Tony finally knew, and Steve finally said the words out loud.
But while he would have been mad about it before (as he had been with similar situations) he couldn't bring himself to be now. It had taken Steve saving his sorry ass to realize it, but maybe Steve was right in benching Tony from time to time. Maybe Steve knew his limits better than Tony himself did. Maybe Steve just cared.
“Look, Tony, I’m so sorry. I know I shouldn’t have lied to you but… And now you’re here because of me, and if you get hurt it will be my fault, and Tony, I can’t… Tony, I’m so sorry.”
And it was true, but Steve couldn’t regret it. Once he stared talking to Tony, he couldn’t stop. Tony told him everything, about Afghanistan, about Stane, about the hunt for his weapons. And in turn Steve told Tony more about the war, about what led to the founding of the organization. They talked until it seemed like they would never stop, until JARVIS had to alert them that Black Widow was sending them more messages, saying that their hour was up and they better hurry or she would kick their respective asses.
Sam and Clint shared a look. “Definitely weird,” Sam confirmed, and Clint nodded, but they were both smiling so Steve didn’t think they minded.
Steve bit down a swear word, and just waved behind him, trusting Bruce and Natasha to finish things up with Iron Man.
Tony took the card but didn’t seem reassured. He only appeared more frustrated. “Why did you even have to involve them? Couldn’t you just have called Iron Man or something?”
Peggy smiled, a small, soft thing, like the one she used to direct at him when they first started dating. Steve was glad she found someone to smile at like that again. “He’s doing fine, thank you. And you? Anyone knocked you off your feet yet?” she said it like she already resigned herself to hearing
Natasha turned to look at Steve. “Hammer hasn’t been seen in a few weeks, but once he shows up, SHIELD will be there, waiting for him. In the meantime, the biggest lead we have is Tony Stark.”
“Nice to meet you, Steve Rogers,” Stark said, and he sounded amused but pleased, still looking at Steve like he was the only person in the room. It was a bit disorienting.
“We could have handled it. The back-up came pretty quickly and all you did was make a distraction, put yourself as a vulnerable target. Which they took advantage off! Because they know how valuable you are. You have a target on your back, Tony, and while I know you can protect yourself with the suit, without it everyone can have a go at you. Point a gun at your back and shoot without giving you a second of warning...“
It was easier than he thought it would be, in the end. He told them he was right behind them. He told them to meet up with Sam.
And Tony, he was… overwhelming on a good day. So full of energy and ideas, he was fascinating to watch. He could have the whole room eating out of his hand within the first few minutes of walking inside it. People were drawn to him, not only because he was the richest man in the country, but because he could make you feel like you were the most important person just because you had his attention, even for a few seconds. His charisma and ability to navigate any situation made him the most popular person in any room.
“I see the most amazing person I have ever met. Kind, generous, brilliant. Someone who would sacrifice himself for others, for a better future. You think those other people, that guy you were just with, see you for who you really are? They only see your money, Tony, and your looks. But you are so much more than that. You're everything. Everything, Tony, that's good in this world.”
Two weeks later found Tony in Japan without his suit but accompanied by his two superhero teammates.
“Steve, can you do that? Can you focus until we get out? I’ll answer any questions you have then, I promise.”
It was a good thing he brought his sketchbook, though he didn’t plan in advance to do any drawing done today. He still liked having it with him, for when the mood struck and the timing aligned.
A freaking bomb that was not quite nuclear yet it could still clearly level an entire city. It should not have been possible, the components inside that bomb not compatible to create such a thing yet there it was. Ticking. Melted to a wall. Fucking Doom and his fucking magic, because that was magic all right, nobody can tell Tony otherwise. He was a genius when it came to that stuff, after all.
And now Steve. But maybe... Maybe this time nothing bad had to happen. Maybe he can have this one thing.
He turned his head around to look at his hand and found another one clutching his in a tight grip. Tony's vision was still blurry so he had to let his eyes travel up the arm and shoulder before he managed to come across a face.
Steve clenched his jaw. He knew what Iron Man was doing. Trying to rile him up, mock him, patronize him. He wouldn’t give him the satisfaction.
Tony seemed to notice his hesitation. “You don’t have to talk about it. I’m sorry. I should have realized it would be a sensitive topic. We can talk about something else.”
They ordered take out and sat talking on the couch for hours. It reminded Steve of the first time he was at Tony’s penthouse.
“Tony!” Steve was knocking again, and if the glass was not reinforced, Tony would worry about him breaking it. “Come on, this is childish and you know it. Just… open the door so we could talk.”
With those thoughts he stormed into the huge hangar they had at their base, where they usually held their meetings with Iron Man, and gritted his teeth when he saw the armored man already talking and laughing with Bruce and Natasha.
“Don’t worry, guys,” Tony said, amused. “If I hurt him I have a feeling not even all of that will be enough to stop you from coming after me.”
Tony was just about to manually release the armor and make a run for it when Steve was suddenly there, tearing the stupidbots apart like cotton candy and looking like an avenging angel doing it (a feature only Steve could achieve, Tony was sure of it).
Tony shook his head. “I’m not worried about them. We got along fine when I was Iron Man, I’m sure we’ll get along fine when I’m Tony too.”
So they followed him, and believed in him, and Steve was grateful every day for them, because he knew that he could never do this alone.
“I'll have you know it was plenty interesting.” Tony said. His face was blank and Steve wanted to crack it again, to see the real Tony behind the mask.
Still, Tony's armor immediately crashed down and Tony watched helplessly as his HUD and JARVIS went all black as he tumbled to the ground (luckily he wasn’t that far up).
Steve didn’t respond. Didn’t even think, really. He didn’t know whether to blame it on the champagne or whether Tony’s presence made him do reckless things, but before he knew what he was doing, he was grabbing Tony’s shirt and smashing their mouths together.
“He was so young,” Tony whispered. Steve didn’t realize until now how haunted Tony was. How much the snap affected him. Everyone thought that Tony got lucky, having Pepper, Rhodey and Happy survive the snap. But he bore the effects of the snap, just like the rest of them did.
Tony raised his eyebrow. Everything in his workshop was dangerous. He put the gauntlet on his arm and aimed. The table on the opposite side of the room exploded, along with half the wall.
Most of the boxes had the stamp of Hammer Industries on them. There were some other, smaller companies that sold weapons whose stamps were on the boxes, but for the most part, it was all Hammer.
So there they were, in the middle of the meeting, Tony explaining all the ways in which both sides could benefit from forming an alliance (both in military, weaponry and financial aspects) when the first hit came.
“I hope you’re right about him,” she said then released him. “Hurry up though, I won’t be able to keep people from snooping forever.”
“He doesn't look like he wants to be rescued.” Steve murmured, looking at how Tony's arm started to move up and down the guy's forearm. All the hope that Steve didn't even realize sneaked up on him, suddenly left, leaving him empty.
A flash of anger crossed Tony's face. “Well, if my Captain wants to speak to me, I have to drop everything I'm doing so that he doesn't have to wait.”
Steve resisted the urge to sigh. “Well, you are certainly an interesting man,” Steve said and found, to his surprise, that he meant it.
“Why not?” Tony asked, irritated, but Steve thought he could see cracks in the carefully constructed mask Tony always wore in public. There was nervousness there, and maybe something else.
Johnson looked livid until she started batting her eyelashes at him, apologizing. She tried to clean up the mess with her hands but it was hopeless.  Johnson put his hand on her back, no doubt reassuring her that it was fine. Steve saw her lean in and whisper something in his ear until Johnson grinned and nodded. He started walking toward the restroom, Natasha on his heels.
). It was different holding the gun and aiming it at someone, shooting without knowing 100% that you're not going to hit something critical and life-threatening (and Tony really didn’t want to have any more red in his ledger, considering how many people had already died from his weapons before he shut down the weapons department at SI).
Steve started moving at the same time they did, getting in their way. His punches were brutally efficient but he was distracted, watching as more and more minions tried to move past him and get to Tony. He couldn't hold all of them forever, no matter how much he wanted to.
Tony kissed him, kissed him like a man drowning, like it was the last kiss they will ever share (because
But it was the kiss that sealed the deal. The kiss, that was soft and warm and slow and nothing like the rushed kisses of last night, when Tony was only trying to get through the night, fearing the memories and the pain they would bring him the next morning.
Natasha and Steve both stood looking up at the sky. It was always impressive, watching that armor at work, even when Steve hated to admit it.
And ever since they found Tony’s weapons in the Mandarin’s base, Steve couldn’t stop thinking about it. Yes, he had decided there and then that he believed Tony was innocent, but it wouldn’t be the first time that he was wrong about a person. And Natasha was right, he
They stared at each other for a moment. Tony was holding his breath but he wasn't even aware he was waiting for something, not until Steve's lips closed around his own and
“Iron Man could do it,” Clint said. Steve glared at him. “Well, he could. Nobody’s a match to him in the tech department, not even your precious Tony Stark.”
Steve felt a bit like an outsider among these people, but he didn’t let that bother him. Nobody paid him any attention anyway, so after buying his coffee, he sat outside on the terrace and decided to draw. It was very rare these days that he found the time for it, and it was one of the only things that made him feel like Steve Rogers and not the Captain.
Steve tensed. His first instinct was to attack, recklessly and uncaringly, but he had to keep their attention away from Tony, and involving one guy in a fight and letting the others roam free would not accomplish that.
“He’s about to walk by next to you. Stop him,” said Clint, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
It was… huge. Modern. Everything you’d imagine when thinking about the place someone like Tony Stark might live, and more. Yet it wasn’t cold or unwelcoming. It seemed lived in, in a way that places that looked like this rarely were.
Maybe it was because Stark was a mystery. A man that seemed bigger than life, but was so down to earth in reality. Maybe it was because Steve prided himself on his ability to read people, and yet he had misjudged Stark for the simple reason of letting the media influence his view of the man. Maybe he just wanted to know who Stark really was, when there was no camera in his vicinity. Or maybe Steve just had a type and gorgeous, snarky, intelligent brunets were exactly that.
Tony was silent for a long moment. “You’re going to love Peter,” he said in the end. “He reminds me of you. The way he sees the good in everyone. His optimism and energy. He just wanted to help. He thought that because he got these powers, it was his duty to help.”
They were quiet for a few moment. Steve still didn't know what to say, so he just murmured, "I'm sorry."
It was one of those ‘lazy’ fights. Hydra was becoming more and more uncreative, it seemed. They were fighting against one of Hydra’s robots. Although, robots was a loose term. They didn't really do much except create a lot of property damage.
Trying to hide when the entire building was looking for you, is very near impossible. They only managed it for as long as they did because they were the very best at what they did.
Bucky was on a personal mission in Russia. Steve tried to plead with him to stay, help him run the organization. But in the end, he knew this was something Bucky had to do. Hunt down the people responsible for what had happened to him. Steve wanted to see them brought down almost as much as Bucky did. Still, it was a constant ache, being without his best friend, and one he had learn to deal with over time.
“Doom. When I got here he was already trying to leave. Didn't even bother much with fighting me even when he had a clear advantage. Why would he go through all this trouble and then just leave in the middle of it?” Tony wondered.
Tony looked Steve in the eyes again. And he imagined himself believing it. The possibility didn’t seem so far away anymore.
His go-to has always been the gym, but he wanted to save all his energy for tomorrow. And staying in his room alone wasn’t an option. In the end, his feet led him to the living room, to see who else was up, or just watch some mindless TV.
“Fine, whatever,” Iron Man said. “Well, as much as it’s lovely to see you Widow, I’m afraid I’ll have to leave you now. I have something I have to take care of.”
“She looks like you,” he said finally, looking down at Morgan. It was the smile, yes, but it was also so much more. The brilliance, the energy. Big, bright eyes. Steve had no doubt she was going to change the world one day, just like her father.
One of the things that made Steve a good leader was his ability to leave his personal feelings aside when he was in the uniform. When he was the Captain, Steve Rogers took a backseat.
Still, this was an unusual job, even for them. Being at the gala, in formal clothes, playing the part of rich and spoiled members of the society.
Later, he would look back and realize how stupid he had been. The gas was clearly affecting him, as was affecting everyone else besides Steve (who apparently had an immunity to it, but that was hardly surprising) but Tony didn't care at that moment. If Natasha (who wrapped her scarf around her mouth but her movements were still much less graceful then usual) could fight, so could he (which was stupid, because she was one of the best fighters in the world and he could barely win in a fistfight with Happy).
“I’m guessing there’s a reason you interrupted me, J,” Tony was saying, sliding down the table and turning on a hologram. Steve was still staring in awe.
Tony’s expression didn’t change, nor did he say anything. Natasha was stating facts, after all, not asking questions.
She stopped abruptly. He wished to continue walking, feeling more exposed standing like that, in the middle of the street. But she didn’t look like she was going to start moving any time soon. She was staring at him like he lost his head.
And just because he had a highly-advanced suit of armor, it did not make him better than everyone else, as he seemed to think.
“Oh, man, you’ve missed so much,” laughed Clint. Sam had a family emergency back in DC so he had to fly back home for a few weeks.
One of the guys finally cracked. Natasha said he was a henchmen, privy to only the minimal amount of necessary information, but it was enough.
He was just thinking of diverging the topic to a safer direction, when Tony’s phone went off. Tony gave him an apologetic smile and then fished the phone out of his pocket. He looked at it for a second then sighed. “Well. Looks like I’ll have to cut this short. Duty calls. Or, well. Pepper. But same thing.”
“Yes, it’s very stealthy, all red and gold like that,” Steve shot back. He saw Natasha and Bruce exchanging glances but he didn’t care what they thought right now.
“Mr. Wright,” Stark interrupted and Steve wondered where he got the man’s name. He probably knew all of them. “I would love to hear more about it after I finish my conversation with Mr. Rogers over here.”
“Is he gone then?” asked Natasha, looking around for any signs of Doom but when she couldn't find any she turned to Tony. “Seems a bit unlikely he would just leave like that. Especially when he had you cornered like that,”
Steve clenched his jaw and stopped himself from speaking. He knew that Tony admired the guy and didn’t know what a jerk he really was. Steve was not going to burst his bubble.
Tony would have analyzed that more carefully and realized all the loopholes in that statement but his team was there and Steve was pulling his cowl down and was holding him by the shoulders asking him if he was okay and he looked so worried and Tony didn't want to think about anything else right now.
They walked to the little coffee shop located near the HQ. It was nice catching up with Peggy, having small talk and not worrying too much about what he could say. It was always easy to talk to her, despite the circumstances.
He was looking at Tony, but the man was now focused solely on the painting. “Can you imagine?” he asked softly. “A weapon like that in the wrong hands?”
Tony smiled at Bruce. “Oh, you have no idea how much I had to censor myself not to say something too out of left field for Iron Man. You have to let me join you in the lab.”
Nobody really understood it. Steve was usually so calm and collected, the kind of person who never engaged in verbal fights, but intercepted them and played the role of a peaceful middleman for opposing parties. And if anyone did dare to go against him, a glare and a stern but not raised voice was all that was needed to resolve the situation.
“Yeah, no offence Tony but the guy got rid of your suit without even touching you and then he just left? Something doesn't add up here,” said Natasha, her voice calculating.
Now here they were, in front of Steve’s small but loyal team. Steve knew that Tony probably connected Steve’s storied about his friends to Captain’s teammates, but he didn’t mention it, so Steve would wait until his team was caught up to bring it up.
Tony started moving, not back to the computers, but toward Steve. He didn't stop when he reached him, but kept on moving, and Steve realized he was getting out of the room.
“I mean, I won’t make you sign an NDA, even though Pepper would probably suggest it, but I trust you here, so I don’t think it’s necessary.”
But the hallway was quiet and the only thing you could hear were the lightning fast clicks of the keyboard. And Steve didn’t have any more excuses not to acknowledge it.
“Yes,” Steve got a faraway look in his eyes. “I… I have loved only two people in my life. I was attracted to a lot more than that.”
Steve noticed his hesitation. “I won’t change my mind Tony. I’m serious about this. More than I was serious about anything else.”
Tony didn’t say anything, but he moved aside, leaving room on the couch for Steve. There was tension between them, now more than in the light of day. They were both careful around each other, as if one wrong word could break the fragile friendship they settled on.
But his favorite moment with Tony happened one month after they first met. Tony remembered what they talked about that day at the gala and took Steve to the children’s hospital. Steve could still remember the look on the kids’ faces when they saw Tony. They were so excited. And Tony was so natural with them, like he was finally able to be himself with those children. Steve was surprised how much the kids liked
“So, the doctor suggested they do a surgery and turn him... more alpha. I don’t know the details, but it was successful. However… years later… when Gyeong tried to bond with a potential mate, he snapped. Everything to make deep bonding possible is absent in betas, but since he was born more beta than alpha, he didn’t have the necessary components, and it caused his body to be at war with itself. He went mad, Tony. He broke the fledgling bond with his girlfriend and tried to kill her.
Tony’s eyes tear up because he should’ve known that she’d know. Of all the people in his life, Jacey has by far been the most understanding. It’s just, well, he’s been really insecure lately. From the Civil War and from people telling him he’s all these kinds of things. And… Pepper. Pepper would’ve assumed that Tony wouldn’t have wanted to do those classes at all. That she’d have to force him to go because he thought they were unimportant.
"Frankly, I don't understand why the Supers haven't sent a designated party to appeal to the government and come to some sort of mutual compromise yet. Like, that's the kind of thing that needs to be done ASAP, yeah? I mean, from what I heard, the Act was all but a sure thing, so time is of the essence and all that jazz."
“I want the schematics, Stark. I want the formula and the equations; the blueprints, if you will. You know them, don’t you?”
He tracks down Bruce by dinner and sends him an encrypted and coded message. He makes sure no one can trace the signal back to him or be able to track the message to Bruce’s location.
“Coffee led to movies led to dinners… led to me going over to his place… led to him coming to mine… led to amusent parks and fairs, which finally led to sleepovers. Don’t look at me like that, Tony, I didn’t have sex with him until our wedding night.” She eyes Tony with a look.
Carol’s book, not shockingly, goes viral. Those bureaucratic assholes are not very happy, but Carol can’t really bring herself to care.
His head hurts. It’s nothing new, not really, technically he’s had the migraine since Ross had shown up and crashed their Avenging party. It’s been coming and going, and he’s been popping enough Advil that his liver probably hates his guts again. Pun somewhat intended. It’s exhausting, though. He tries not to think too hard about it.
The camera follows his line of sight to where Tony is being dragged out of the wrecked vehicle from the massive pile-up, resulting from the explosion, by none other than Hydra. He’s unconscious and bleeding. He’s pushed into a small car and then the car is driving away.
[1] a demi is a character who has characteristics of more than one designation. Jacey, in this case, is a beta with femalpha characteristics. i.e. she sort of smells like an alpha (pheromones) and she has an alphan presence (commanding, leader, badass, etc)
Steve’s face has suddenly gone very, very pale. “Are you saying… D’ya mean-- Are you tellin’ me Stark ensured that those documents would never fall-- never have fallen into the wrong hands? That… that he
did Asgard manage to get a hold of not only one of the gauntlets, but three of the infinity stones, too? Just what was Odin up to, and why didn't Thor say anything about it?
He thinks of all the people he’s met and their smiling faces. He thinks of his little Avengers family that ended up just as well as his biological one. He thinks what the two babies he’d have would grow up to look like… if he’d have to grow used to Steve’s face on of them.
She shrugs, like it isn’t a big deal. “By then, I’d say we’d only dated for a few months when he told me he loved me. I’m… slow… to love,” she admits quietly, “but when I do, I love with every fiber of my being; fiercely and all-encompassing. You should know, Tones, that once someone has my loyalty, the only way that loyalty ends is if the other’s does first. Do you understand?”
“Ancient teachings,” she explains, “it was given to many cultures by a good man– a teacher. Stark, why do you not know zis?”
“I was transferring from my community college to a university beach-side that Autumn, and I’d just moved in to this new apartment with two other girls. We were good friends, so we decided to go wandering around to explore the area. It was fun… up until it started pouring rain out of nowhere. So, the girls and I duck into a local, hippie coffee shop where I lay eyes on a man sitting in the far corner all alone on his laptop.” Jacey laughs and her eyes are bright with mirth.
also, i'm trying my absolute best to keep dialogue to a minimum so that the plot and speaking are kinda balanced– let me know if you think it's still too much dialogue and I'll try to tone it down some more.
Besides, now that he’s decided to give Steve a second chance he’s going to make the blond damn well earn it. He smirks.
Yeesh. Tony flinches. "Yikes. That sucks, guys, I'm sorry to hear that. How bad was it compared to Red Lake? Oh, shit -- that's right --
For a moment, tears choke Tony up a little bit. “Do you think,” he bites his lip, “you could help me do that with… with
“Congratulations, Mr. Stark, you’re having a boy and a girl, and they’re both quite healthy all things considered. Those stem cells the fet– the babies sent you really worked wonders for your recovery.”
Barton pulls out his phone and squats next to Tony. "Hey, Cap, well we got a little problem. ... No... No, it's another incursion. I know. It's the third one this month, but this one's in a bad way. He can't walk, Cap, so I'm gonna need some cappower-- heh heh--to get him to Reed."
“Really, and it didn’t occur to you to think about your kids or Laura before that? I received a phone call from her, Barton,
"I'm so sorry, Tony, I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you." He tries not to let his tears fall on the babies, but he doesn't quite manage.
The man smirks. “Thank you,” and suddenly Tony is encased in something dark and cold and claustrophobic.
The next ten minutes blur by with more agony and Tony belatedly realizes that the reason why he's bleeding is probably because the placenta has detached, or worse. He did do some reading after, since he has a heart condition and because of his more... advanced age. Ugh. He hopes he's not hemorrhaging. He hopes the babies are okay.
“In other words, Captain, any of the metahumans who’d signed would’ve probably still been able to continue on as their ‘secret’ identities with no one the wiser. Their lives would’ve likely remained wholy unchanged.” For the most part, he thinks. But there’s always exceptions.
Tony shuts down. His face shutters closed and his eyes go foggy. “Me, huh. Even after all this time, that’s still what you think of me? After
Is Tony's first thought. But how could she know? Only the Avengers and the higher-ups at SHIELD are supposed to even
“Steve? Wh–” He starts another round of full-body hacks and it’s probably a full minute before he can breathe even slightly again. His energy drained, he just looks at Cho weakly.
To say that Tony Stark was extremely disoriented would be like telling a rancher his cow was exorbitantly heavy. A completely and utterly obvious fact that most probably wouldn't even think to utter out loud.
Said soldier looks up from counting the lines in the grains of their wood table. It’s almost like Tony’s given out information that he definitely shouldn’t know about. And isn’t that interesting? Tony can tell by the surprise in Steve’s eyes that he hadn’t been anticipating that retort in the slightest. It has definitely, and delightfully, shaken the soldier off-balance.
Tony is thinking about his babies and the word 'incursion' when Barton turns to him and asks, "So, what happened to you before you came here?"
“What do you think that kind of guilt would have done to him, Captain? It would’ve destroyed him. So, yes, he would’ve beat Barnes to a pulp, but the man’s a deadly assassin, a partial supersoldier, and an alpha. I think Barnes could’ve defended himself. Plus Tony would’ve stopped eventually. Probably would’ve gone numb and boneless and broken down in tears. I know that, so why don’t you?”
Steve shrugs with a little hopeless grin on his face. “I didn’t have you to help me pick which movies to watch.”
Steve is wringing his hands and looking nervous. “I was just checking to see if you were okay,” he begins awkwardly.
per se, but it was quite difficult not to overhear a woman with very powerful vocal cords screaming at her rogue husband when Natasha shared the room right next door. Some might say she could have left her little room and gone… elsewhere, but Natasha had always had a curious nature that Tony would probably call her a gossipping old lady for. So, naturally, she couldn’t help but choose to stay.
If anyone would like me to go more in-depth/detail about my particular A/B/O verse I will post an explanatory prologue. The only thing I need you to know is that there is no discrimination against omegas-- omegas (everyone) get same opportunity/pay/rights/etc as everyone else. Hooray for equality!
“Ugh, FRIDAY, tell them I’m sick and in no mood for a lecture today. Tell Evie that he can come back here mm never.” Tony grins at that, “And copy the recording of his reaction. I wanna watch–” He hurls some more.
Tony gets a thoughtful look on his face. He tries wiggling his toes and commanding his brain to tell his legs to
“So, this dude says to me, ‘I’d love to buy you coffee again,’ and I was like damn. That was pretty smooth. At this point, I’m so out of character that I think ‘fuck it’, and tell him it’s a date.
fourth: this chapter may seem slow, and I know I'm back-tracking (again ahah. what's a linear story progression? i've never heard of it ahhHAH), BUT ch 12 will speed everything up so fast some of you will prob get whiplash, add. ch 12 will also COVER ALL PLOT HOLES. it's going to be a long chapter... whew. REJOICE.
An odd sensation floods through his belly when he's trying to pull his pants up. A warmth... and then...
Tony blinks and is quiet for a couple of minutes while he tries to fathom all the possibilities that a name like that could entail.
He didn't want to get up. He was not comfortable, but far too lazy to move from his secluded safe-spot by the window to get up and retrieve the bottle.
“In your sleep,” she wrings her hands together, “I did an ultrasound to check on your internal wounds. It seems, Mr. Stark, that you are carrying.”
“Go ahead, Rogers, tell him. Tell him what you did to Tony in Siberia.” There’s a fierce, raging fire in her eyes and Steve folds his hands in his lap. He looks down, ashamed.
The guy doesn’t look convinced and now that he gets a good look, the guy looks extremely familiar. “Who’re you?” Tony groans.
First of all: thanks for all the views, kudos, and reviews I've received. I love it all. Here's a chappie. OH remember to subscribe, k? ;)
Rhodey and Helen watch the cars pull away. They head back inside and ask FRIDAY to put on the news. It's bad. The footage shows Tony being led away and the cars driving off. The two of them are staring at the TV in shock when something even worse happens. The car in front blows up and sets off a chain-reaction for multiple wrecks. Helen and Rhodey both pale. "Dear God, no, not again." Rhodey sounds agonized.
“I know.” It’s how the bastard managed to overwhelm him and how he– he doesn’t want to think about the shield.
"We-- I need to take you to Reed. He can-- he explain all this better than I can. Uh, by the way, why are you still sitting? Are you okay?"
"I-- Vision--" Tony is deeply touched, and his hormones choke up his words and send tears to the corners of his eyes. "Of course."
"Reactor? Hell no! I got that thing out of me years ago-- thank God for Dr. Cho and 3D printers, am I right?"
“Nope, the eyes aren’t gonna work on me, man.” Rhodey shakes his head. “Tones, you should know better.”
Her expression becomes pinched and pained. "Tell someone what you choose their names to be, or write it down somewhere someone will find it," she insists.
Tony goes to look outside the window again. She’s helped with a lot of his problems, namely his PTSD and anxiety. He’s also managed to solve that irritating little quirk where he couldn’t stand being handed things. Tony hadn’t lied when he said Jacey used drugs as a last resort, but it just so happens that his PTSD was… incessantly stubborn. And, while therapy was giving him progress… his flashbacks and following panic attacks were relentless, so Jacey reluctantly passed over the prescription and told him that she would be switching the medication every two doses to prevent his immune system adapting to any one drug. Also she claimed it might help him not become so dependent on them as a sleep aid and antidepressant.
He hums to himself quietly. And, honestly, has the toilet always been so far? Or is it just because he's so massively fat now?
“Coupla days,” Reed’s giving him a look that means he’s probably thinking of their early conversation and how he said he was fine, but really wasn’t. The look reminds him of Steve. It makes him unreasonably angry.
Finally, Steve grits his teeth and says, lowly, “If you were faced with an impossible decision, like what signing the SHRA would mean for the supers who
“So, Mr. Ross, what can little ol’ me do for you? Surely the Secretary of Defense has better things to do with his time than question women about their most recent accomplishments?”
“Yeah. I know all about that,” he grumbles and thinks of the vision she’d given him before Ultron became the result.
.” He runs his fingers through his hair and shrugs. “Really. Everyone can stop pretending to worry about me, okay, because I am
They’re sitting in a good-sized conference room when T’Challa strolls into the room looking extremely haggard.
“There are no time outs in war!” Clint called, throwing a snowball, but Tony saw it and ducked – and it nailed Natasha right in the face.
He hurtled across the battlefield, spotting his best friend’s suit lying smoking in a crater and completely ignoring Thanos and the others to drop down beside him. Natasha was still calling his name over the coms, but he didn’t respond, retracting his helmet.
if you do not remove whatever spell you put on this hairdryer, I’m going to reset every device you own so that it runs on the equivalent of Windows 7!” Tony threatened, hollering down the hall.
Silence greeted his pronouncement, grim and stricken. Even Carol, who had stood strong and confident the last time he’d made a similar speech, looked a little rattled. Nebula and Rocket were wearing matching hard, black expressions of agreement, Nebula from having grown up with Thanos as her father and Rocket from having heard Nebula’s and Gamora’s stories of the destruction Thanos wrought. Thor only looked grief-stricken and empty, while Steve and Natasha were varying degrees of horrified and shell-shocked. He couldn’t see Peter’s or Rhodey’s faces, but he’d bet they were somewhere in that spectrum as well.
“I thought I lost you,” she’d said, voice breaking when she finally pulled back, eyes darting over his face like she was trying to memorize every piece of it.
And then Steve turned to look at him, expression so fond that Tony’s heart stuttered. “You’re willing to slow down and wait for me to catch up.”
“Busy day?” Steve asked, walking in, covered in a light sheen of sweat that unfairly just made him look like he was glistening rather than like a drowned cat, which was what Tony looked like while sweaty.
the universe (universes? Timelines? Confusing fuck-all parallel realms of existence?) had decided to pick
Tony nodded along, babbling about how Steve had the best plans. It was hard to keep their hands to themselves with the promise of what would happen next looming over them. Self-restraint had always been one of Steve’s strengths and he prided himself on the way he quickly and efficiently spread soap over Tony’s body. The same could not be said for Tony. He rubbed his hands over every inch of Steve’s body he could reach, no regard for where his hands had already been. He pressed his body up against Steve’s chest, spreading soap where he’d already been cleaned and initiating another round of rinsing.
Scenarios and strategies for each flew through Steve’s head as he thought for a moment on how he might answer. He needed Tony right now if he was going to be able to continue on with any kind of schedule. But he also could not bring himself to admit that he carried the same weaknesses as that other Rogers. And even if he could, those feelings would be for the original Tony. What was standing with him now was simply a copy that could be playing a game with him for all Steve knew. He could always lie, but the mere suggestion of doing so put a bitter taste in his mouth.
“It’s mainly so people can monitor their health and physical activity. Though if you don’t actually care about exercise, I can see why it would seem useless.”
“But you know, darling, films can only do so much. If you ever want to experience some man-on-man action up-close and in-person, you only have to ask. I’ll be going back to my bedroom now. If you want to join me, Captain, you know where it is.”
Behind him, a woman on the television screen wept into her hands while a man kneeled in front of her clutching at the knife planted firmly in his gut. The agent caught Steve’s gaze and grinned.
Tony’s hand travelled back up his arm and past his shoulder to his neck. Steve tilted his head back to the side. Tony’s fingers pressed up behind his ear and rubbed at his scalp. Then Tony moved to stand behind him at the end of the couch. Steve started to tense but the fingers merely trailed back down to his jaw and over his chin and neck, feather-light and barely there until they reached his chest. Tony pressed firmly down on his shoulders again and worked over his pectorals. He tried to keep his breathing even as Tony brushed over his nipples, hardened into twin peaks of sensitivity. Tony paid them no special attention, which only served to frustrate Steve more with the bare teases of pleasure he was getting instead. He felt hard enough to cut rock.
Tony’s smile was warm and inviting, the way it had always been. This wasn’t Tony, but that smile did things to Steve’s stomach nonetheless, and Steve blamed his other self. Damn that man and his weakness for Stark. Steve hadn’t been able to quite dismiss it, the longing and hunger that were instinctual reactions at this point. His gaze was drawn to Tony’s shimmering lips as he spoke.
When the episode ended with a shadowed figure watching the murderess burning evidence, Steve was fit to burst. Someone knew what she had done, but who? The soothing tones of the announcer assured him that answers would be given in the next episode. The agent turned to Steve with a grin.
Of course, Tony had thought nothing of it and promised to help Steve uncover this mystery. Yet, despite Tony’s initial enthusiasm, his expression had become more and more distressed as he typed. Steve placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder.
Steve pulled his fingers free and trailed them along Tony’s jaw to curl up the back of his head and grab onto his hair. He’d expected it to feel stiff or maybe slick with product, but was pleasantly surprised by the softness he found there instead. He used his grip to leverage Tony forward, pulling him down as Steve raised himself up to meet in a harsh kiss. Tony was panting, pulling in gasping breaths against Steve’s mouth. Steve held his head in place as he kissed Tony thoroughly. It occurred to him as he licked into Tony’s mouth that kissing was a level of intimacy that probably didn’t belong in whatever the hell they were doing here. He hadn’t really thought about kissing Tony. He’d just decided that Tony’s mouth was being wasted on his fingers and had wanted a taste of it. The brush of facial hair was a shock, though not an unpleasant one as it turned out. The foreign sensation spurred him on to press closer, bring his hand down to palm his face, rubbing at the bristles. Tony kept grinding down on him through it all.
Then after the serum, there was that time he thought that Howard and Peggy were a thing. But even that hadn’t lasted long, mostly due to the fact that they weren’t, in fact, a thing.
“Tony,” Steve sounded surprised for a moment, caught off guard. Tony figured he probably forgot to check the caller ID before answering the phone. “Is something wrong?” Steve sounded professional all of a sudden and Tony hated himself a little bit (a lot).
Steve forced himself to stop thinking about it. The truth was, he was nervous about the meeting with Iron Man. Not that he would ever admit it to anyone.
Steve grinned. “Naturally.” He hated to end the conversation here but he lingered for far too long as it was. He looked at his watch. “I’m afraid I’ll have to leave you to deal with Mr. Wright. I have to go, it’s already late.”
Tony opened his eyes and looked at Steve, sheepish. "I might have... upgraded the code a little bit."
But then there was everything else. Because Steve didn’t like Iron Man. He was arrogant and frustrating and he didn’t know how to take orders. He made unnecessary risks and he constantly breached their security just to show that he could. He was bright and loud and brilliant.
Steve didn’t like how vague she was. Mandarin’s bases were a closely guarded secret, even more so after Steve and his team found the last one. Who knew what kind of resources SHIELD had to put into this. But Steve also knew that Natasha would have told him more if it was necessary. They had the address. That was the important part.
Tony's eyes were shining with unshed tears and when he laughed it was broken and bitter and sad and everything Steve wanted to erase from Tony's voice. “I'm nothing more than broken, Steve,” he said, self-hatred in his voice cutting deep into Steve's heart.
“Well, how about that,” he murmured to himself, uncertain of what to do with this new information. His mind was buzzing, the sensation of
“Yeah, well. Pain’s an old friend by now.” He kept his tone light, refusing to let the discussion get any more serious than it already was; he didn’t think he’d be able to keep himself together if it did. “But anyway, you wanted to talk to me about moving forward.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Harley said, waving a hand and not looking particularly sorry at all. “But you gotta tell Neb you consider her one of your kids!”
Steve smiled, eyes lighting up, bright and delighted. “Good,” he said simply, and then he dived back down.
, and Tony wasn’t sure how many of the new memories that had been appearing in his head over the past couple of days were real.
“No, no, your face is fine,” Steve said quickly, the expression disappearing as though it had never been there, then turning mischievous. “Or as fine as it can be, I guess.”
Thanos ignored him, starting to pace. “Do you know what it is like to have them whispering in your mind every moment of every day of some insignificant
“I’ll be right back,” he promised, standing up and making his way out of the room. He wound through the Compound, waving at Natasha curled up in the reading room and nodding at Rocket, who was channel-surfing and looking progressively less impressed.
down his back. Tony shrieked, wiggling and turning around to give Steve an accusing glare and a piece of his mind, but their momentum made them off balance and then they were falling, falling, falling, until Tony was on his back in the snow, Steve hovering over him.
. But the words continued to pour out of him. “She didn’t want to do the decorating though, she just wanted to enjoy the final result. Well, and show off to people when she hosted for parties. She always had the maids do the decorating. Jarvis let me help sometimes, though, when he could get away with it. My favorite part was when he’d lift me up and let me put the star on top of the Christmas tree. Felt like a Hallmark movie or something, like I could really feel the Christmas spirit.”
“No, no,” Steve waved him off with a rueful smile. “I asked you that, after all. I was just thinking about how much this reminds me of nights with the Howlies.”
“Nah, he’s like this every morning – completely useless till he gets at least two cups of coffee in him,” Rhodey said, smirking. “You sure he’s not yours biologically, man?”
So this is timeline #2, the one we JUST left at the end of chapter 4 of Two More Miracles, when Timeline 2!Tony's just been stuffed back into his own body with the knowledge the stones shoved into his brain about the multiverse.
But she responded anyway. “None.” Tony, for his part, was baffled; they hadn’t interfered with the past, they hadn’t made

tell her this, but he was exceedingly proud of how quickly she’d mastered all the magic stuff. Or whatever. Stephen was impressed. (Except of-fucking-
“Ouch! Is that any way to speak to the guy who tricked out your garage? That’s just downright rude, really!”
“Uh, we don’t have to – I mean, I’m sure I can get them to back off,” Steve said awkwardly, fidgeting and suddenly unable to meet Tony’s eye. And Tony’s heart dropped. Of course, Steve wouldn’t want to. And he wouldn’t want to either, not like this. Not when it didn’t mean what he wanted it to mean.
“Sorry, Boss, Mr. Rogers, Harley and Peter have instigated the ‘Mom and Dad are Fighting’ protocol,” FRIDAY said, though she didn’t sound particularly apologetic.
“No – you can’t do this, Tony! You can’t – you can’t leave us! You’re my Mechanic, you’re – you can’t leave me!” Harley called, and
“Sorry, old man, I just call it like I see it. Also, took ya long enough to call me – what, did it take you weeks to figure out newfangled technology?”
that he just wanted to violently make out with the man for a few hours – and – and – wait, where had he been going with that again?
, and you keep fighting, then I guess I’ll give you one last piece of advice that I hope you’ll actually listen to: if you find him, or if he finds you – run. Run and hide, Hector, because you won’t walk away from that fight.”
“You know, this reminds me a lot of those Christmas ads I used to see pasted on store windows,” Steve commented thoughtfully as they decorated, and Tony cocked his head, an invitation to continue. “We couldn’t really afford to decorate like this, Ma and I,” he explained. “But sometimes I’d come across posters advertising Christmas decorations and such, and they’d show a place that looked an awful lot like this. Warm, homey, decorated to the nines.” Steve smiled, and Tony was entranced. “It’s nice, is all.”
“You’re here because of your wish, Tony Stark,” Steve said, his voice soft, caressing his name. And when Tony met his gaze, he could feel
It took them only moments to assemble, Rhodey and Tony activating their nanoparticles, triggering the suits but leaving their helmets off, Thor suiting up with his traditional lightning-induced flare, and Steve and Natasha dashing off to change. Bruce and Nebula, having not needed any adjustments, beat the others to the briefing room, calling up those abroad so that Rocket, Carol, and Wong were pulled up when the rest arrived, as well a Dora Milaje that Tony didn’t recognize.
idk I headcanon Morgan as just ??? being so smart ??? and somehow being able to tell her dad is different now and that him ‘only being gone for a few days’ with the time travel + the battle is some bs???? I would like to reiterate my ‘the author does what the fuck she wants’ tag, idek you guys.
“Excellent!” Thor boomed, and Tony would swear he could hear a soft roll of thunder echoing the god. Thor and Bruce also set off, dragging their luggage with them.
Okay, so I think it would probably be easiest for me to go ahead and set up this world in the notes so that there’s not a whole lot of random explanation in the story. So, here’s the backstory: this is timeline #5, the one in TMM where Steve was killed in Wakanda. So in this one, Morgan was an ‘accident’ that happened when Tony and Pepper were together, and they broke it off but were still co-parenting Morgan. Tony and Steve started dating and split after CW, although, though neither would admit it, they both assumed they’d eventually get back together. But then Tony ended up on Titan and Steve was cut down in Wakanda during Infinity War.
Tony smiled to himself, feeling strangely warm and content as he looked around at their ragtag little group. He hadn’t had friend groups like this growing up, always too small and too smart and too
Tony quashed down his moment of pity, knowing challenging Thanos would be pointless if this world’s Thanos did the same as his. But then again, the Steve he remembered had never mentioned anything about helping with the rebuilding efforts – so who knew what was the same anymore. “Sounds good,” he said abruptly, clapping Steve on the shoulder. “I’ll see if Peter and Rhodey are on board, and you can let us know where you need us.”
“It’s definitely not what it sounds like! Those were space metaphors for very, very pure, innocent things – like, uh, taking someone on a date! Or getting them flowers!” he said quickly, giving Peter a very convincing smile.
“Figures that you’d be a cuddler,” he said, shaking his head in amusement, and Tony flushed, mortified.
“I kinda figured,” Bruce said wryly, leaning against the wall, arms folded. “I’ll follow the rest of you out and suit up when we get there.”
him. Having to save 14 million universes before getting to return to his own? Jesus, that Tony Stark was going to be one even
Nebula’s face slackened in shock for a moment before resuming its carefully schooled emotionless expression. She nodded shortly. “If that’s what you want.”
.” And then Morgan was crawling onto his bed as Pepper hugged him, pressing a desperate, emotion-filled kiss to his lips that Tony had returned, feeling the weight of millennia without her, without
“Okay,” she’d responded simply, and he’d blinked at her, uncertain as to what to make of that strange acquiescence.
Also! Creds for the idea for the old man protocols to someone on either Tumblr or Pinterest from like a year or so ago??? I couldn't re-find the post, but I remember reading a post about Peter hacking Tony's suit and putting in all the old man protocols as revenge aaaages ago and apparently it stuck with me. It was def the inspiration for that part of the chap - if any of y'all know who wrote that post and want to leave a comment, I'd love to actually give credit!!
“Ooookay, before Nat eviscerates Clint and sells his organs on the black market, how about we call a truce and share a victory feast,” Tony suggested quickly. “I’m sure I’ve got some s’mores stuff in the house.”
“Hey, I’m 16!” Peter said indignantly, and Rhodey nodded, jabbing a thumb at him as he looked at Tony.
Tony manfully repressed an innuendo. Seriously, people should be awarding him medals for not taking advantage of the very obvious one there. But then Steve’s expression dropped again. “Look, this doesn’t have to change anything. I didn’t mean for you to even find out, I’m sorry, I – “
“Breathe, kid,” Tony said with a breathless chuckle, craning up from where he was flat on his back in the grass to stare disbelievingly at Peter hovering over him. “I’m happy to see you, too.” Peter beamed, so breathtakingly earnest and thrilled that it took some of the sting of Pepper,
“Dad,” Morgan called out, and he half-turned. Her face was open, curious, trusting. “Do you still miss Mom?”
“Wait, uh, could we talk?” Tony blinked at him, looking down at where Steve was still grabbing him and then back up at Steve, who took the hint and released his arm.
“It means you’re stuck in there until you work out your issues,” Harley called cheerfully, his voice muffled by the door.
“Aw, it hasn’t been that long, has it, bambino? Surely not more than a couple of days,” Tony had teased, smiling fondly at her. And she had looked at him contemplatively, eyes serious and far too intelligent.
drool!” Tony squawked, deliberately ignoring the incriminating damp area on Steve’s annoyingly muscular right pec.
yes I realized I published chapter 4 yesterday. should I have 100% been studying instead of writing this? yes. did that stop me? apparently not. so here we are. <3
idyllic holiday retreat that would do the job perfectly. On the down side, the cabin only had three bedrooms.
“Right, well, I’m going to get back to the relief efforts. You just keep doing...whatever it is you’re doing,” he said wearily to Harley, who was continuing to wriggle around. The kid saluted, then turned and repulsored away. Tony watched him go, then shook his head, returning to his work.
“Look, I have a lot of shit to get done over the next few days, and I don’t wanna have to be constantly looking over my shoulder to make sure you haven’t destroyed the entire east wing or some shit,” Fury said, glaring at each of them.
hadn’t created a murder bot, his program had been corrupted by the stone’s influence – even in the face of irrefutable evidence that had been accepted by the courts when he was exonerated. They hadn’t believed him, they’d blamed him, and they hadn’t trusted him. And when he became even more insistent about the looming alien threat after the vision Maximoff had given him, they’d dismissed him, rolling their eyes about his ‘conspiracy theories’ and ‘you watch too many movies, Tony’ and ‘we have
Tony nodded. “Thank you.” He activated his coms. “Peter, Harley,” he said calmly. “I love you both to the end of the worlds, and I always will. Tell Morgan – tell her I love her 3000, okay?”
“Well, I wonder how that got there, then,” Steve said innocently, indicating the damp patch. “I could always go ask the spy twins, they’re pretty good at solving mysteries.” He made to get out of bed, and Tony lunged at him, half-tackling him to the side.
And then he proceeded to do some wiggling moves that Tony assumed was supposed to be a victory dance in midair. Tony stared at him, resigned.
“We thought assuming forms familiar to you would make you more comfortable for our conversation,” Peter said, and Tony tilted his head.
Thanos only eyed him like a predator staking out the most satisfying way of catching his prey. “The stones have spoken of nothing else but you since I finally restored balance to the universe,” he said, and his voice was low and slightly unhinged.
“Mr. Stark, I – “ Peter choked off, looking away, and Tony could hear some of the others in their group cough and start to shuffle away, clearly embarrassed to be watching the family drama unfolding before them, but Tony’s gaze was focused on his boy. Finally, Peter turned his head back, looking Tony in the eyes, expression hard but heartbreakingly broken. “You were just gonna go? Just like that?” he asked softly, and Tony swallowed.
The first door they passed had what sounded like the Black Widow speaking in soft but dangerous Russian that, from what Tony could discern, was a veritable threat against Hawkeye’s liver and kidneys if he tried to take the window bed away from her.
Peter piped up, his voice earnest. “It’s for your own good! You two get in the worst arguments and then don’t speak to each other
of technology – nay, emperor even! And second, I don’t know if you watch the news, but I hitched a ride on an alien spacecraft a few weeks back – maybe you remember? Took me a little while to get back home.”
“Steve, Jesus, shut up,” Tony cut in, feeling like Christmas, close as it was, had come early. And also like he was a complete idiot for not having seen this earlier. His heart was lighter, buoyant, and he felt almost giddy with this newfound knowledge. Steve fell silent, looking at him like he expected an axe to fall at any moment, and Tony took a moment, searching for the right words, then decided
“Certainly, you are welcome to accompany me. I’m not there as often since I was put in charge of the New York sanctum, but it would probably be good for me to visit and check in on how our new acolytes are doing,” Stephen responded formally once he’d recovered, and Tony hid a snicker; hiding behind stuffy language was Stephen’s primary defense mechanism when he got caught off-guard, and Tony was always endlessly amused when it came out.
The feeling of impermanence, of the transience of a life, never got easier to bear, as Tony had discovered during his years; he wished he could wipe that pain away for them, but he had to admit that the renewed feelings of loss he’d experienced when one of his loved ones was dead in any universe he’d visited were part of what reminded him that he was human.
The tattoo guy smirked. Then he deliberately looked behind Steve, where Tony was still furiously typing on the keyboards, as if he knew Steve was trying to divert their attention from him.
He owned a multi-million dollar company and could do whatever he wanted? He was considered a spoiled brat and his reputation was dragged through the mud more times than he could count. Oh and his 'father figure' was selling his weapons on the black market to his enemies.
They started moving down the corridor, Tony in the front with his hand raised in a familiar position. Steve’s chest tightened.
For their first year anniversary, he took Peggy to this really fancy place that Natasha had recommended to him. Yes, he had had to save money for a few months to be able to afford it, but it was worth it in the end, if for nothing else but Peggy’s smile that didn’t go away for the entire night.
