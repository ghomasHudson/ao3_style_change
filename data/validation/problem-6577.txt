“A, I tailor those pants, and B, that’s an amazing seat,” Tony said. “But seriously, Rogers, you think that’s news to me? I’m Mister Make It Up As I Go. So are all of us. You think any of us have a grand master plan? That’s bad guy territory. That’s what Doom’s got, a master plan. The rest of us are just improvisers.” Somewhere during his monologue, Tony noticed that he’d turned on his side to face Steve, and Steve on his side to face Tony. They lay together, sharing the same pillow, close. It was… nice.
“I find,” said May, returning the bottle to the edge of the tub and preemptively uncorking another to let it breathe, “That being drunk in a tub is objectively better than just about any other state on earth.”
“Thanks. It’s not Michael Bolton’s den of sin, but it’ll do,” said Tony, and Steve looked confused. “Nevermind, it’s not important. Come on, let me show you the room you want.” He lead Steve to the second floor and far out the left wing of the building until they came to the last door on the inside of the curve. Letting it swing open, he gestured for Steve to pass through first. Ducking under the low threshold, Steve sucked a breath in. “Tony…”
“Holy shit, that was fast,” said Tony, digging into his pocket for his wallet. “How much do we owe you?”
“Alright, alright,” said Steve, rubbing the heels of his hands into his eyes sockets. “I admit it, I’m a mess. I’m going to see my ex… well..”
“That’s the spirit, Barton,” sang out Sitwell, then: “Aha! Snagged you, you little bastard.” The plink of glass falling into a tin dish, then: “One down, thirty more to go.”
Steve stepped in front of Barton and began carefully folding a new skein of cotton gauze. Barton’s shoulders were relaxed, but his gaze followed Steve’s every move. “So what’re you, like, a commando or something?”
Mr. Coulson sighed. “Yeah, me too.” The late afternoon sunlight, filtered through pine trees, stretched across the classroom.

I think that makes him Megan Markle, Point Break is probably going to win the battle of the pool noodles but that’s just because no one accidentally wants to piss off the God of Thunder and Lightning when they’re in the pool. Hap’s having the time of his life, Pep and Aunt May are
“What’d I miss?” Steve asked, coming up beside Tony, who gave the phone up as a lost cause and tossed it aside.
“Too bad, it’s the Avengers definition, we had this argument long before you showed up,” said Tony. “It’s literally written into the bylaws of Avenging.”
“Sounds nice,” Steve said, resuming a slow, soothing stroke pattern up Tony’s cock, leaning forward and pressing a open-mouthed kiss to the head before leaning back and pillowing his head on his fist, looking up at Tony.
“Well, damnit,” Tony said, and then he was scrambling out of the van, Clint and Sam and Natasha and Thor and Bruce and Scott tumbling after him. Tony was fast, but Steve had incredible stamina, and his long limbs ate up the steep hillside like it was nothing. Even Thor was panting, hands scrabbling for hold on the slick grass as they all leaned into the incline. Ahead of them, Tony saw Steve conceal himself behind a cardboard compactor as the garbage men got out of the truck’s cab, stretching and chatting. After a brief moment’s contemplation of the sun, they went to the loading dock’s rolling metal door and opened it via remote control, heading into the dark interior of the building and shutting the door behind themselves. As the door slid back down, Steve took off running, leapt onto the loading dock, and, in a move Tony had only ever seen peformed by Indiana Jones, rolled underneath the descending door. Panting, he and the rest of the group arrived just as the last inches of the gap sealed.
Many faces appeared beside Sam’s, as everyone crowded up from the back of the van to peer up through the windshield at the dank grey building which squatted like a thundercloud atop a denuded hill on the outskirts of Zemo, Delaware.
“Is this a sex thing?” said Clint, knee jiggling at double time on his stool. “I gotta prepare myself mentally if this is a sex thing. Also I am the god of sex things.”
security, instead of just outside it. Rhodey, bitching the entire way in from the tarmac and wearing only about half of his Iron Patriot suit, was called in to mediate between the panicked TSA and a—it has to be said—kinda
“Only if you haven’t been underneath it,” said Scott. “I’m really surprised they transport kids in this thing.”
“If it’s the touchy kind I heard there’s a hack for that. I just need a really big magnet. Did anyone bring a really big magnet?”
“—and he reports nothing to be seen in any direction,” finished Thor. “We are as alone as if we were in the Well of Wyrd, near my father’s summer home in Nor—”
“Yeah, well, they can also kidnap you and feed you to the hill people,” said Tony, peering out the windshield with an expression of deep misgiving. “Let’s make this a short pit stop, shall we?”
“Lucky for you, I’ve got an entire wildly smart building, plus multiple bots who’ve been trained to run every kind of sim routine imaginable,” Tony returned. “Friday, move Dummy down to the lab and get him caught up to speed on Dr. Banner’s work with, what is it, subatomic noise? Done. Hey, could someone get Coulson on the phone? Last time we tangled with Doom he was looking a little crispy around the edges.”
"And, in answer to your question, I don't know what's changed," said Tony. "I didn't used to take this long to make up my mind about someone. I used to know by the time they had my pants unzipped. So like, fifteen minutes? I'm slowing."
,” Clint said, reaching over Natasha’s shoulder and pointing directly at the hickey on Steve’s neck. “That right there is a hickey.”
“This is going to need a nurse to get all the glass out,” said the History teacher, and before Steve could open his mouth to volunteer, said, “Mr. Rogers. Do you think you could walk Mr. Banner here down to the infirmary?” The
an improvement,” Thor commented as they deboarded the plane, squinting in the blinding sunshine of the Aegean. “How come all Midgard is not like this?”
“BAM, anticipated. Anticipated! I’ve already called the X-Men, they’re happy to take point for a few days. NEXT OBJECTION.”
drunk that he couldn’t hear a door opening. “Is that so,” he said, setting his drink down with a faint clink.
“You look so pretty when you beg,” murmured Tony, dropping his mouth to Steve’s ear. “Did you beg for him?”
“Wh—Barton!” Steve sprung up, running a hand through his hair and stepping away from the bunk, feeling himself turn bright red.  Looking curiously at Steve, Tony curled up from the bunk as lightly and gracefully as he did everything else. “Hey, Barton,” he said, as if nothing out of the ordinary was going on, “What can I do you for?”
The security guard, looming in the doorframe, hitched up his belt in a way he obviously thought looked threatening. “We have reason to believe that Mister Banner—”
Steve could have sworn he heard a tiny puff of breath—a snort, almost—from where Natasha was bent over her linoleum. Nah. Couldn’t have been. Natasha didn’t understand English.
Tony woke up next to the most gorgeous man he’d ever seen, and had a solid twenty minutes of making out before he had to slip downstairs to the suite where he and Pepper were staying. Not that he was ashamed, or anything—he just didn’t necessarily feel like explaining the finer points of their arrangement to, say, Thor. Not at eleven o’clock in the morning with a hangover.
Carol looked at him. After a measured beat, she spoke. “You’re really making some life decisions these last few days, huh?”
, like an alarm clock or a cell phone. Tony’s stuff was all just… stuff. Steve reached out to inspect what looked like a partially dismantled cordless drill.
“I was not far behind you all,” he said, “When I fell into the well. The ground gave way beneath my feet, and I was struck badly. I do not know how long I slumbered, but I had a strange vision while I slept.”
Steve found his feet and moved. When he returned with two Dixie cups of icy cold water and a roll of brown paper towels, the injured boy was sitting up, looking embarrassed. “Thanks,” he said quietly as Steve handed him the water.
Natasha, stepping over Bruce, didn’t answer—instead, she squeezed through the space between driver’s and passenger seat and, balling up her fist, punched the glove compartment, which fell open. Several large folding maps, plus a pocket Rand McNally, fell out.
“Because it’s a discussion that occurs with surprising regularity,” said Tony. “Pep gets on one of her health kicks, Thor brings home a new girlfriend, not to be sexist or in any way imply that the ladies in our life like to litigate the amount of kale we eat,” he added as Pepper walked by their pool, visibly rolling her eyes but continuing on her way. “But it’s surprisingly handy to have an all-purpose definition of what constitutes salad for whenever one’s health credentials are questioned. Speaking of which,” he said, watching Happy lower himself gingerly into the hot tub containing May, among others, “Shouldn’t someone tell Happy that men with high cholesterol shouldn’t be in hot tubs?”
They sat in silence for a while longer, listening to the cicadas, the soft dusk chorus of songbirds, Scott Lang’s voice asking if anyone had orange slices.
Tony snorted. “Naw, I’m thinking we’ll do just fine with the eight lock picking sets and several genius juvenile delinquents I brought along. And one heavy hitter, that’s you, buddy.”
“No. No. No! My blood pressure can’t take this shit, Stark, are you trying to make me have a heart attack?”
Sam grinned for a second, letting Tony’s face cycle through disbelief and shock. Then he held up his phone. “Naw. Uber. I knew Barton couldn’t go without a pee break.”
“I believe my father thought it beneath the dignity of the family,” said Thor. “Then, of course, he went into a coma.”
“What was your vision?” said Clint. There was quiet for a moment, and he looked at Tony. “What, the man said he had a vision. No one else is curious?”
At that moment, one of the boy’s wild, blind punches connected—with the security guard’s ear. Even Steve flinched at the hollow thud.
“I’m sorry, I know it’s past curfew,” said Steve. “I went for a jog, hurt my foot. Decided not to run back.”
Steve’s grin didn’t budge. In fact, it got bigger as his eyes stayed steady on the horizon, until it was a mischievous moon, splitting his whole face in half. “I’d like that,” he said.
That didn’t sound like any kind of culture shock that Steve had ever heard of, but he did know something about waking up not knowing where he was, so he kept his mouth shut.
“Anyway. My dad was furious, not much he could do at that point since technically I’d been kidnapped. Turns out you’re not supposed to take a minor out of the country when you just have temporary guardianship. Not that it mattered. Obie made the call, I got the pacemaker. This little… toy-sized taser keeps me alive. Keeps my heart going so I can keep inventing stuff.”
“Jesus,” said Bruce, snatching the map. “OK, this isn’t terrible. We just missed the turnoff for 287… about an hour ago.”
“Yeah, right, budge over, short stuff,” Sam Wilson said, nudging Tony over and rolling up his sleeves. “I know you like to be in charge of everything…”
Peter obediently jogged off to the sidelines, nodding at Stark, who came onfield looking uncomfortable.  He stayed uncharacteristically quiet all through the huddle, and Steve wondered if he’d perhaps found the one arena on Earth where Tony Stark was not possessed of superhuman self-confidence.
“I used to set a lot of minor injuries for my… back at my old school,” Steve said. “A bloody nose is no big deal. If you’d let me, I can help get Barton patched back up while you work on Banner.”
“C’mon, Sitwell, just one little incision, in and out, you’re telling me you don’t have faith in my electronics? After the job I did for you?”
“…of the heavily guarded and vaguely paramilitary school full of heavily armed Republican teenagers?” said Bruce Banner.
“Oh, come on, Sitwell, where’s your sense of adventure?” Tony said, grasping him by both shoulders as he slid down from the table, setting his weight experimentally on the angle Sitwell’d bandaged and braced for him. “Jail is terrific for good-looking guys like you. I’ll mail you some soap.”
“Soooo, you gonna convince me, or what?” Tony said several minutes later, regarding Sam over a mound of heavily jalapeno’d nachos. Behind them, at another of the bright red picnic tables, Thor was entertaining Natasha by chugging a bright blue Slurpee at speed, while Bruce was soothing his sorrows with a mound of cheese-soaked fries.
a car!” hissed Peter Parker, hopping from foot to foot in an apoplexy of anxiety. From beneath the school van, Scott Lang’s legs shifted.
The splash, when it came, almost spattered into the deep Japanese soaking tub in which Bruce, Rhodey, Coulson, and Sam were luxuriating. Almost.
“To the thigh bone,” Lang said, rolling back out from under the van. “All done,” he informed Tony, tossing him the screwdriver. “You can tell me I’m fucking sexy any time now.”
“Yeah,” said Carol. “It does. Tell you what,” she said. “I’m not even going to ask if you’re on Facebook. Instead, you’re going to give me one address where I can send you a picture postcard. You still believe in the mail? Good old-fashioned US Postal Service?”
Steve said warningly. Barton’s posture was relaxed, his shoulders loose, but his eyes were rock-steady, fixed on Stark—Steve thought that of all the people he would very much like
“Did you set up the whole, pick me a sport thing so that I would put you on Ultimate and then you could hit on me?” demanded Steve.
“All right, all right,” said Tony, ignoring Bruce’s quiet moan of distress. “Do what you gotta do, just hurry up, wouldja?”
Of course, then Steve kissed him, big nose nudging Tony’s out of the way, big hands moving to cup Tony’s skull, and it got way more than
They all looked. Some three feet above the door, there was a rusty, folded fire escape that zigzagged up the side of the building. Scott Lang squinted at it. “Ah, shit.”
“You little SHIT,” the guard bellowed, only to be pulled away from his target—the history teacher was dragging him upwards by the jacket, and continued tugging until the backpedaling guard was hauled completely out of the classroom. Then Steve’s teacher slammed the door behind him, a gesture which might have granted privacy had all the glass not been knocked out of the window. As it was, the entire class heard it when he said, “If you ever lay a hand on one of my students again,
“Well, I wasn’t the only one in the car. This buddy of mine, he was also there. And, uh, he’s still in a coma.”
“Too bad,” said Steve, tugging himself up the wall and landing lightly on his feet on the soft leaf litter that cushioned the other side. “I would’ve enjoyed having you on this side of the wall.”
“No. You, is OK,” she said, and then pointed at the auditorium benches. Then she placed her finger over her lips.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” said Clint. “In the rooms, technically they can’t do anything about it. You’re both minors, trying to figure out if it’s mutual statutory or just really loud porn is real awkward for them. All kindsa liability if they start questioning you about your sex life, because again, minor. But you go having sex outside on SHIELD property, in public, that’s a real law. Indecency. They can actually nail you for that.” He waggled an Xacto blade at Steve. “Face it, you’re our auditory floor show every night.”
“Nothing, on the house,” said Tony. “Just ask her to tell me how they work out for her? Or, she can write a note, whatever. Pigeons. Just. Feedback. My inventions would never get better without it.”
Steve went back to the dorm and kicked the door open. Stark, startled in the act of blowtorching a Pop-Tart, flipped up his welding visor. “Hey there, didn’t expect you home so early.”
“Come on, I’ll explain it to you on the way,” Scott Lang told her, pulling her by the wrist towards the sliding door of the van. “Tony, I assume you’re driving slash talking nicely to the cops who will inevitably pull us over and arrest us all?”
The music coming from the dance studio got louder as he approached the door, loud enough to muffle the heavy fire door as he pressed it open. Inside, Natasha Romanov stood at the barre, one leg describing half-moon circles on the floor, hair up in a severe bun and posture so elongated she gave the impression of trying to see over a very high ledge. Her eyes caught his in the mirror and her extended foot snapped back into fifth position.
“If a Tony makes a goal in the forest and no one witnesses it, does it still get talked about?” Sam asked.
“Okay,” said Steve a bit sheepishly, and followed Carol and her towering stack of hair inside the rest stop, where a trucker-style diner had been jammed sideways into a Sbarro’s, with the rest of the space given over to a jarring hodgepoge of arcade games, 18-wheeler parts, pay-by-the-minute showers, and racks of cheap pornography. Carol made a beeline to the pastry case; Steve stood bewildered in front of a refrigerated case of pre-made sandwiches until she came back and grabbed him by the hand.
Maria handed over the clipboard wordlessly, and Steve could swear he almost saw the trace of a smile hiding in her lips.
in a coma.” Steve realized he was drifting and snapped back to the class. Mr. Coulson was asking a question. No. Wait. Mr. Coulson was calling a name like it was a question.
That settled, they continued wandering in companionable silence, into a hallway lined with photography darkrooms. Steve stopped to look in at the finished pictures hanging up in the framing room; apparently, the photography students were working on still-lifes. Lots of close-ups of feathers and leaves. Bruce stopped too. “You like art?”
Natasha tilted her head quizzically to the side, and he struggled to think of a way to make himself understood, struggled in a way Natasha clearly didn’t need to. Why would she ever struggle, when she walked around the world in a body that was like a poem? In the end, he settled on a word in Italian that he hoped she knew.
.” And Steve heard the underlying rumble in his voice that was more subsonic threat than purr. His cock stiffened suddenly, painfully; before he could even register the decision, he heard his own voice: “Yes sir.”
of them. Sitting on the sidelines, looking bored except for how they weren’t—their eyes kept tracking Tony, and whenever he’d go jogging past two or three of them would sit up straighter, laugh a little louder, adjust hair and cleavage. Steve couldn’t even really blame them, which was also kind of annoying; Tony was a sheer pleasure to watch. When he stretched out to catch a low disc, he seemed to hang in the air a few milliseconds longer than a normal human would, like Jordan hovering at the net, the laws of physics mysteriously inapplicable. And on defense, his speed and ferocity made him seem a half a foot taller—even though he was physically smaller than almost everyone on the team except Parker. Steve frequently found himself just stopping to
“Don’t mention it,” said Tony, already backing out of the room. “It’s been here for you since you joined the team.”
Steve’s breath caught in his throat, audibly, giving the game away as Tony, triumphant, unfurled over him, slotting their dicks against each other. “See, the thing is, Captain Rogers—”
“Yeah, well,” Tony said, standing up and quickly gathering the scattered trash from their lunch. “Don’t go spreading it around, I kind of enjoy my, genius playboy billionaire philanthropist reputation.”
“And you think there’s gonna be a Shasta machine, really specifically, on the roof of this creepy-ass mental institution?” said Sam. “Barton! I think I got your voice of optimism right here.”
Tony blinked. Chewed. Blinked again. “Son of a bitch.” He finished chewing, reached into the bramble, pulled out another fistful of berries and jammed them in his mouth.
“Hey, Thor,” said Sam. “Let’s get you outta there, okay?” It took three tries to get Thor to reach up, but once the dazed Norwegian brushed Sam’s hands, he was gripped firmly and pulled towards the rim. “Everyone, gimme a hand, this guy weighs a ton.”
“Friends, it has occurred to me that we are all going to cause our parents much distress by disappearing in this manner.”
“Culture shock,” said Clint. “Uh, the bad kind. The kind that wakes you up screaming and fighting and not knowing where you are.”
“О, ради Бога,” muttered Natasha, stepping between the two boys and lifting the map out of their hands. Climbing to the front of the van, she squatted between driver’s and passenger’s seat and spread the map out, pointing to a spot a bit before the Junior Military Reserve Academy. “There. This is place we go into the school.”
The group was lying on their bellies on the far side of a chain-link fence, looking into the manicured grounds of the Chester Phillips Academy. The chain-link fence was not particularly tall, and the ground they were laying on was not particularly steep; nor was the campus teeming with students. They were lying on their bellies because the group had collectively decided that it seemed like the cool thing to do.
“Friend, not ex, who said anything about an ex,” said Tony, glancing in the door at the old guy. “Too old for high school, let’s move on.”
“It’s when you follow your boyfriend to Connecticut and then just stand there staring at him instead of—ow! What’d I say?” Clint rubbed his bicep, and Tony turned back to Steve.
me, not really the outdoors type,” said Tony. “Plus I don’t go in for… uh. Calisthenics. Whatever—this is.” They’d come to the six-foot wall.
“Wow, that’s a lot of deflection from someone who’s just stolen a van to chase down his boyfriend,” said Scott Lang.
"Well, for starters, you don't think of him like that," Pepper pointed out. "He's only twenty-seven years old. Granted, he's got an unusual amount of historical perspective, but still. He's a lot more lost than he looks. Listen to him and point him in the direction you want him to go."
“I don’t think you’re in danger now, but I agree,” said Bruce. “It’s possible you may have encountered a hallucinogen when you fell into the well. Maybe a pocket of natural gas trapped underground that you disturbed when you fell, a fungus, some kind of spore…”
“I could try,” Scott said as the gangplank opened, and then, as Shuri, Okoye, Nakia, and finally T’Challa appeared and descended the plank, “Nevermind.”
“Has Bruce not explained climate zones yet?” said Tony, coming down the stairs after the Norse god. “Seems like a kind of a basic thing—hey, look who beat us!”
Steve opened his mouth, then closed it again. After a moment, he admitted, “Actually, I have no idea what would happen if he tried that.”
Steve dropped his face into his hands. “Why did I ever think asking you guys for help would be a good idea?”
“I suppose not,” the boy readily agreed, and they continued ambling at a more leisurely pace, heading through the laundry room into a corridor marked with mid-century radiation shelter placards.
Tony let Steve’s cock out of his mouth to look up at him incredulously. “You’ve gotta be kidding me. Xavier School is the definition of a joke. It’s an
“Apparently she’s like an actual no-shit Communist and went to like some hardcore ballet academy. You know, like where they start them out at seven and work them dawn to midnight. Like, Olympic-level shit, tiny little ectomorphic gymnasts with no periods, in Soviet Russia, pas de deux does
, kid,” crowed Carol. “Easy! Please oh please don’t ever go to Los Angeles, you’ll be taking three dicks on video in a van before your first sunset, my God.”
It was kind of hard to miss the SHIELD Academy van and parking lot full of sleepy teenagers on the way up the road. Steve walked up to the group with his backpack slung over one shoulder, ruefully noting how no one even seemed to hear him until he was practically standing on top of them. “Hey guys.”
Tony shrugged. “I ‘unno. Don’t really like to plan that far ahead, I’m kinda a seat-of-my-pants kind of guy.”
resting on his lips, was the thing—it was warm, and heavy, and enchantingly pink and smooth. It thudded, very slightly, juddering to the interior metronome beat of Tony’s heartbeat; Steve let his lips soften, just slightly, to cushion it against the moist pad of his tongue.
“Thor, buddy, give me your hand,” Tony said, pushing up his sleeve and dropping to his belly on the ground next to the pit. It was a strain to even brush Thor’s fingers with his own, and Thor was too woozy to grip properly; “Come on, guys,” said Tony. “Lower me in a bit.”
“It’s the swipey kind,” Tony said as he felt very gently around the edges of the reader, looking for somewhere he could jam a metal shim, maybe get into the circuitry. He felt Scott’s breath puffing over his ear. Jesus, it was worse than eating bacon in front of a dog. “Lang, I swear to God, if I can’t get into this thing you will get first crack.”
“Hello, Natasha, I’m Mr. Coulson, I’ll be your History teacher,” said Coulson, extending his hand, and Natasha shrunk away, looking to Barton for help.
it, darting right into the center of the fight, deftly avoiding the boy’s wild swings as he prized the two combatants apart. Steve rose to intervene, but his teacher held up one hand—“Don’t! Stay back!”
“Any time,” said Tony, patting Clint on the back as he turned to leave. Right before Clint stepped out the door, he stopped and looked over his shoulder at Steve.
“He definitely shouldn’t be here. You should have seen the way he went after Banner. That guy packs a wallop.”
,” Tony says, firmly. “This whole expedition, the one that you and your colleagues sent Steve on, it was to stop the Nazis from getting their hands on the gem, wasn’t it? Or was that the reason you gave Steve so that he could bring it back and you could use it?”
Tony looks at her, uncertain and almost childlike in the way that he does. “You think I’m overreacting, don’t you?”
No, he won’t be friends with Natasha; that’s not something in the cards for them; too much has happened, and Tony doesn’t think he can forget.
Tony’s world shifts for the final time, stretches at the seams to include James in some significant, permanent way that he’d always been aware of but just needed some tangible effort on the universe’s part to put it square in front of his eyes, eight months after they have the conversation about including James into their family with the children.
“You don’t talk about him,” Steve reminds him. “Peter, I mean. You don’t… you don’t mention him at all.”
Steve nods, determined. Then, he gets a bit uneasy. “Is that okay?” he asks, worriedly. “I mean, the oil and the fried stuff and… stuff?”
Tony digs his hands into Steve’s shoulders, and Steve lifts him onto the bar, sliding between the space that Tony leaves for him with his legs spread. Steve continues to kiss him- slides his tongue into his mouth and curls it behind his teeth, and all the control that Tony had assumed in this exchange goes out the fucking window as Steve destroys him, sets a fire in him that he hasn’t felt in years, makes his heart thunder in his chest as if it’s about to burst. And then, Steve pulls away, and Tony heaves an unsteady breath.
Natasha’s fingers are stained with blood when she completes the last note, awkwardly hanging off Rhodey’s shoulders, considering that Toni is still seated on his lap, since all of her male relatives are dead now, and Rhodey is the closest thing to a brother that Toni will ever have.
Tony reaches back behind him and spreads himself for Steve, showing the rawed, fluttering rim that he’d just been fucking, and Steve groans, coming hard and wet, painting Tony’s hole obscenely with streaks of white, making Tony shake from head to foot at the warm wash of heat between his legs.
Tony’s eyes droop shut, and then he jerks awake, rattling his head as if it were a radio drifting off station. He tumbles out of bed, throws open the window and takes a deep breath.
. I’m just saying that shit isn’t fucking simple, okay. I love you, I do. In general, yes, I am happy with our life. I love you, I love our home, I love our kids, but yes, I was struggling with what my life is, but that doesn’t mean that I was fucking unhappy. I am happy, Steve. I want more, but that doesn’t mean that I’m not happy. I was
Steve would do anything for those kids, and there was a time when Tony equally thought that Steve would do anything for him as well.

“We do want to marry you,” he says, gently, “which is why we got the ring. We know, uh, we know it’s not the sort of thing that you could probably afford for yourself, and we know some people, you know, that could get us a bigger ring if that’s what you want–”
He slips into the driver’s seat, behind the wheel, and James closes the door for him, leaning into the window.
James winds his arms around Tony’s waist. “It’s because you love so much, doll,” he murmurs into Tony’s shoulder, his arms tightening like he fears Tony will fade between the grip of his embrace. “And whatever you were stressing out about, they were normal, reasonable worries for a parent. But they were all dealt with. Did we do good?”
“Even if I have other babies. You were my first baby. When I had you,” her throat flexes, “when I had you, I didn’t know if I could be a mother. You know, I’ve told you that your
“Come here to save you, has he?” Steve says, his face warping into anger. “He’s sure protective of you, your boyfriend, isn’t he?”
Howard makes a noise of derision at the back of his throat. “You know what, you still sound like a fucking child.”
James cracks a smile. “When I got home last night, I felt strange in my apartment. I did a sweep, found three bugs. She must have broken in earlier that day and placed them around the apartment. She’s been following me ever since.”
“My brother has gone hunting, but I know that he will be a most attentive bond mate to you when he returns,” Grant tells him.
Grant, though, Grant reacts in a much more placid manner, goes about dressing himself calmly, tucking his cock back into his breeches, as though this is normal behaviour for him, between goodbrothers, and he takes a seat, stretching his legs out in front of him.
Steve’s brow furrows further. “Tony,” he says, gently. “Hey…” he wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, pulling him against his chest. “If you’re sick, you tell me, okay, and I’ll… I’ll make some arrangements, okay. Someone, we can get someone to come and stay with you, today, help with the kids. What about Pepper?”
, and I have an inhaler on standby. There’s a lot of scar tissue, and I’m at constant risk of bacterial infections at the wound sites. The pain was…
“Steve is my friend,” Natasha confesses. “He’s one of my only friends. We don’t… in our line of work, it’s not exactly easy to make friends. So, yeah, Steve is one of my only friends, and I knew he had kids and a husband, and he didn’t, he didn’t want to introduce us, and I was
Tony sits up and throws himself at Obadiah, knocking both of them to the floor, and then, Steve’s phone lights up with his ringtone for Tony – Iron Man by Black Sabbath.
Tony tightens his robe around his shoulders, as Steve murmurs something soothing to his horse, before approaching him.
The longing turns painful, aching, and he wants to run, run and help him, but reason wins out, especially when he looks back over at his family at the table, and the twins giggling to themselves over some lame pizza joke that Steve had told them.
His mouth lands on Tony’s with bruising force, stealing all the air out of Tony’s lungs, and Tony can’t help himself, can’t stop himself from reaching for Steve with both arms, draping them around Steve’s shoulders, dragging him on top of Tony so that he can feel his weight atop his body.
The recruits whisper, loudly, behind her back, and only the alpha from the fair looks especially pleased.
He grabs one of the oil canisters that he’s found amidst the pillars and splashes oil on the floor in that direction, then lights it. A path opens toward that wall.
“Wow, are you finally realising that it’s not all Twister and chocolate milk when it comes to raising two kids?”
He didn’t used to be like that; he was shy once, when it came to Tony looking at him naked, a vulnerability that he only shared with Tony. When had he changed? When had he become so confident? Had Tony done this to him, or was it Natasha? Did she make him more confident, more loved, more attractive than Tony had?
He baulks immediately, and that’s how Tony knows that this picture is odd, that it’s not just him who finds this picture horrifying and distasteful. The boy tries to protest.
Steve turns on his side, so that he can face Tony properly. “Why are you so bothered by a nightmare?” he asks, softly.
Tony backs away, slowly, one step, then, two steps, and then, three, and then, he’s running, his bare feet smacking against the metal in a way that should leave bruises, if he wasn’t so certain that this was a dream.
“But you were able to live without me,” he says, woodenly, nodding to himself, as if acknowledging some terrible reality.
Somehow, that feels too private, for his children to share this part of his life and for James to share that part of his life – they should be kept separate.
He reaches down, threading their fingers together and raising them to press against his arc reactor (Steve, Pepper and Rhodey are the only ones who have tried and succeeded, because he knew, in his bones, that they would never hurt him the way that Stane hurt him).
“Oh no? Is the noise of my Ultimate Frisbee domination just too loud?” Tony said, shooting a three-pointer into a nearby trashcan with the wadded-up lunch trash.
As the group piled in, Steve sidled up next to Tony. In an undertone, he said, “I really won’t blame you if you wanna get them back to campus. They shouldn’t be paying for my choice.”
Tony blinked, and Steve wondered just how little Tony’s parents had ever sent their son outside to play. “OK, give us just a minute to score and then I’ll swap you in for Peter, he’s getting tired.”
“I’d say more than good,” said Steve, lightly tracing the rim of Tony’s cockhead with a thumb still slightly chalky from today’s Frisbee practice.
“Looks like Cap’s got that covered,” said Barton, and Tony shot a sly look over his shoulder at Steve.
“In the meanwhile,” Mr. Coulson said, “Let’s talk about the War of the Roses, and why generations of inbreeding between royalty is a bad idea.”
Steve winced at the phrasing—thankfully, Tony was listening to Bruce’s muttered counsel, and didn’t seem to hear. Hoisting Bucky to his feet, Steve looked at the group. “Listen, you can leave and go back to SHIELD without me. But I’m taking him out of here. This isn’t the right place for him.”
“Shh. You have. It’s my fault. My responsibility. I figured out what you were a while back and I haven’t been taking the time to discipline you and give you what you properly need. That’s on me.”
Steve shook his head. “OK, so now that everyone apparently knows my business already, help me figure out what he wants? I can’t tell. He runs hot and cold with me.”
“This is NOT what New Haven is supposed to be like,” said Tony ten minutes later, as they all studiously avoided eye contact with the low-slung turbo next to them, where the ratio of passenger to Adam’s-apple tattoo was 1:1.
“A lesser country?” Bruce inquired mildly, and Tony noticed in the rearview mirror that Natasha was sitting up ominously straight.
“We’re climbing on Thor,’ Tony announced. “Yep. That’s what we’re doing. Thor buddy, think you can hold one of us on your shoulders long enough for us to pull that fire ladder down?”
“That was very good cocksucking,” Tony purred, running his thumb over Steve’s cheekbone. “And now it’s made you all pretty and flushed. You’re blushing like a virgin, Steve.”
“A, that was a spider, and B, way to keep up the positive attitude, buddy,” said Tony, and that’s when the shouts of “Here!” “Over here!” began. Running was impossible in the densely brambled forest, but Tony bull-rushed his way through the underbrush to the spot where Bruce and Natasha were already laying on their bellies, aiming their flashlights down into a dripping, rocky hole. At the bottom, Thor was standing chest-deep in a pool of black water, looking dazed and a bit bloody, and swaying like he’d take a heavy concussion. Tony knew that feeling.
“My brother committed a conspiracy once,” said Thor. “It was against our father and got him banished from our home for several years.”
“Alright,” said Tony. “Well, if you wanna talk, you’re gonna have to follow me to the can. Is this one of the Sheetz with nachos?”
“Yeah, well, that only works if you haven’t had your nose set before,” griped Barton, before letting his hand drop so Steve could take a look. “How’s it looking?”
, or so the truancy laws say. And after Buck, there just didn’t seem to be much point in going back into the military. So Steve enrolled at SHIELD, and felt guilty every time he enjoyed it.
“All right, everybody get your stuff in the Jeeps,” Happy yelled from behind them, puffing under an armload of luggage and already reddening in the Mediterranean sun. “We got limited daylight and the roads aren’t great on this island.”
“I hadn’t thought to put a numerical value on it,” Steve admitted. He licked a stripe up Tony’s cock. “You know you’re kind of a nerd, right? I mean, I get that you have this reputation as the playboy of the century—”
, the voice in Steve’s head named it, before Steve himself got a chance to. Tony’s hair, emerging from the sweatshirt, was even more rumpled than usual; his eyes had a glint of mischief in them, and Steve swore he saw Tony
“Yeah, but where would the fun be in that?” Tony asked, to general approbation, just as the nut gave way with a sharp crack. “Awesome, let’s get that spare on there and get moving.”
“Love you too, Tony,” Maria Hill called back, her tone dry ice. “Pick up your trash out of the hall.”
“Right, so moving on,” said Scott Lang, pointing with his fork at Clint. “You. You’re always out of your room after curfew. What’d you see?”
Tony was the type to spread his conquests around—something about the softness in his roommate’s expression this morning—but maybe he was wrong.
to have a problem with, it’d be Clint Barton. “Why does Natasha need it. exactly?” he asked Clint, trying to keep his tone polite and neutral.
“Honey, I live my life in public,” Tony told him, and then they were making out again, and someone walked by in the hallway and said, “Gross, get a room,” and Tony laughed his ass off as he closed the door.
“Today, class, we’re going to talk more about the Magna Carta.” In response to the chorus of groans, he held out his hands. “I know, I know. But consider this: the great charter is the first document the English managed to come up with which pushes back against the idea of the divine right of kings to basically act like tyrants. It is a resistance to absolute power, an assertion of the rights of the governed, a safeguard against bullies.” His eyes rested briefly on Bruce’s—then flicked away, a subtle beat, just long enough for a hush to descend over the class. “And that is why we are basically never going to be done talking about the Magna Carta. Everybody got their notecards for the debate? Right, get them out.”
“He’s never been on a private jet before,” Hope Van Dyne added helpfully. “He agonized the whole way over about how much you were supposed to tip the flight crew.”
“She’s bluffing,” said Tony, but his voice cracked, and he darted around Steve to the hallway, where he scooped up his tr—components—in a scattered armful, dropping a lot of it as he shoveled it back into the very small dorm room that Steve was (allegedly) supposed to be moving into. It didn’t look like there would be enough room for Steve. Every horizontal surface was covered with… stuff. Steve wasn’t exactly sure what to call it. Lots of it had wires, and some of it was humming, but nothing was a recognizable
“Hmm,” said Tony, his tone unreadable, his eyes locked on Steve’s from the other side of the fountain, the underwater spotlights casting rippling ribbons of green across his face. “Do you wanna stop?” His tone was mild, neutral—Steve shook his head.
,” said Tony, a hint of incredulity creeping into his voice. “You knew, and you didn’t fucking tell me.”
The thought was startling, like a jolt from one of Tony’s tasers, but the strangeness was in how the thought
“Thanks,” Steve said to the truck driver who’d picked him up outside Philly and gotten him almost all the way to Chester Phillips Academy. “You really helped a lot.”
“Tony, I swear to God, you offer me that taser one more time I’mma jam it up your ass,” Lang responded. “Now, shut up so I can concentrate. Make yourself useful.”
“Everybody shut up,” said Tony, who was beginning to sweat. From beyond the door, he hears what sounded like someone throwing a shopping cart down an escalator. Steve, operating with his usual subtlety. He felt a light tap on his shoulder. Looked. Scott was holding out a folded scratch-off card, the metallic paint facing out.
“Too bad,” said Mr. Coulson, and smacked Clint gently on the shoulder. “Come on. Dinner. They’re gonna eat up all the chicken stirfry, leave us with the tofu.”
“I have taken no drug,” said Thor. “I merely saw what the waters wanted me to see. Time, power, space, reality, mind and soul—these are all components of truth, but without each other, they are as beams of colored light. Together, their true beauty is revealed.”
“What, Thor, no, we aren’t gonna find shawarma this late a…” Tony said, climbing out of the car and looking up at the sign for the pizza place. The sign read “Moore’s House Of Pizza And Shawarma.”
Shuri grinned as she saw her brother emerging from the great glass house; scanning the pools until he saw Nakia; and, pretending to be casual, heading in her direction. “Him.”
“Let’s get one thing straight,” said Tony. “I don’t care how long you were in that coma, you’re not getting top bunk. I get off up there, it’s convenient and private and I don’t have to worry about getting ogled by our friendly resident RA-slash-tyrant overlord,
. He couldn’t have waited until we were in the building.” With that, he hoisted himself over the edge of the roof’s ledge and jogged across the wide tar-paper expanse, heading to a small shack that stuck out of its center. Leaning on the handle, he muttered, “Please be an unlocked door, please be an unlocked door, please be an unlocked door—yay!” as it swung open beneath him. Heading down the darkened stairs within, Tony dug in his pockets for his cell phone. “Siri, launch flashlight app.” The white light illuminated a narrow staircase littered with cigarette butts and scratch-off tickets, then a door marked “Access to 4
“And to think you’re the genius in the car,” said Sam, pulling up at a tiny pizza place next to a check-cashing joint.
,” Shuri said. “And heat and cooling settings too. I’ve never encountered that outside of Wakanda.” Okoye shot her a stifling glance, but as she was nose-deep in bubbles with a wineglass in her hand, the censorious effect was somewhat lost.
“I don’t care if you think he traveled back in time to assassinate President Kennedy,” Mr. Coulson cut in smoothly. “He is in my class, and so I need to teach him now. Good day, Mister Ross.” He swung the door shut in Ross’s purpling face and pivoted on his heel, ignoring Clint’s delighted hoot of approval and heading for the board.
“I never thought I’d say this, but I miss Bucksnort,” said Clint. “Why the hell are we in New Haven?”
“Jesus, can we can it with the doomsaying?” said Tony. “Thor, buddy, how many fingers am I holding up?”
Steve gave him a rueful look, then nudged past Tony and reached shoulder-deep into the thicket of pale, hairy-looking canes. He rummaged around for a moment, then withdrew a fistful of berries, glowing red as cold-water tuna. He popped one in his mouth—Tony watched the berry disappear—and offered the fistful to Tony. “Want one?”
“Yeah, me too,” said Scott Lang, dropping his chin into his cupped hands. “Come on, buddy. Tell me about your vision.”
“You know,” said Sam Wilson, following Steve’s gaze to where Tony, caught in an eddy of players, was having his hair aggressively ruffled by one guy and his back patted by another, “You really did that guy a favor.”
“Hey, any of you kids know who got sent home on America’s Next Top Model last night?” the attendant asked, yanking on the tire jack to loosen the lug nuts. “We had a thunderstorm in the middle of it and lost DishNetwork completely.”
“There will be snacks involved,” said Tony quickly, and Sam sucked his teeth, staring off into the greenery of the lush Pennsylvania forest, trying not to laugh or smile. After a second, he said, “You know, I’m not the only funny one in this conversation.”
“He’s talking about Tony Stark,” said Clint. “What?’ he said when Steve stared at him. “Cone of silence only applies when you’re not actively begging for help with your sex life. Your sexy, sexy sex life.”
Steve stood and made his exit with as much dignity as possible. Once he got out into the hallway, it occurred to him that he’d gotten completely turned around and, once again, had no idea where he was. It was getting to be a familiar feeling.
as Tony Stark, that was it; he seemed utterly comfortable in his skin, confident and free in a way Steve, for all his size and strength, never did. And just as Steve was about to open his mouth and say something truly disastrous, something like, “You’re incredible,” his eyes fell on the scar bisecting Tony’s chest. Jagged and rippling, it followed his sternum, but roughly, as if whomever had done the surgery had been in a great rush to get at Tony’s heart. When Steve looked up, Tony’s dark eyes were steady on his face.
“Obstacle course,” said Steve. “Low ropes, mainly. It’s part of SHIELD’s campus, how have you never been up here?”
Tony had hopped off the bed and was rummaging around in one of the many plastic bins he kept components in. “Getting my tools. I can’t work without my tools.”
Tony joined him at the window. The boy lying in the bed was their age; Steve’s age. Dark hair, a strong jaw, long limbs. He looked like he could have been an Ultimate Frisbee player, if he hadn’t been comatose. Tony looked at the greasy hair, the circles under the eyes. The boy looked like him, after three straight nights of engineering. He wondered if Steve had a type.
“Potato potahto, you’re missing the point. The thing is, Rogers, even though you are the very image of a modern major general, and while you know that my respect for you on the field as an athlete is
“Nevermind,” said Steve swiftly. “Here. Here’s your sport.” He circled a listed item and passed it back to Hill, who looked at the selection and smiled. “I’ll see you at practice Wednesday at six, Tony. Have a good evening, gentlemen.” She walked off, and Tony turned to Steve.
“Wait, we’re all gonna bust in just to look for a record? Seems kinda like a one-man job,” said Scott Lang, jaw working furiously around a wad of Juicy Fruit.
Stephen Strange, whose transformation into peaceful sorcerer from arrogant surgeon was still maybe only about 95% complete.
Steve allowed himself to relax into the current of the lecture, a smooth river punctuated by little eddies of laughter and the occasional question—Mr. Coulson didn’t try to trip people up, but he wanted opinions, and he liked to take polls. Today’s poll asked if they believed monarchy could ever be a just system of government. And Steve was just about to get in a pretty significant argument over the issue with Carter the Brit, when the door to the classroom opened. Barton stepped inside, his arm around a tiny, huddled teenage girl dressed all in black, red hair falling across her face.
going on over there with the whole hair-and-nail salon but it, you know, seems kinky.” Tony sniffed, then continued. “Oh and Clint’s been talking a big game all evening but hasn’t gotten the balls to go fish his longtime crush out of the pot of old man stew over there.” He indicated the Japanese soaking tub. Steve followed his gaze curiously.
“What’sa matter, trouble in paradise already?” Sitwell said from his crouch in front of Barton’s busted face.
“Shit, come on, help me, Hill told me if I set off the fire alarms one more time this semester she was gonna make me join sports.”
. And besides, you think I can follow Steven fucking Rogers when he doesn’t wanna get seen or followed? Lemme tell you, it’s not like following
“Yeah? Make me,” said Tony, and Steve swallowed him down. Later, as they were lying close in the darkness, it occurred to Steve that Tony had been trying to start a conversation about something. He was just damned if he could figure out what it was.
“Right?” said Tony, before being interrupted by the back doors of the van flying open. Barton, along with the red-jumpsuited gas station attendant, stood there. “All right,” said Barton. “Everyone out so we can change this tire.” As the teenagers piled out, Tony pulled the archer aside. “Think it’s a good idea to let him see all of us?”
“OK.” Steve went and sat down on the third row, feeling as if he were about to be on display, not she. Natasha switched the music back on and returned to her position at the barre, reassembling herself like a robot fitting itself back into place. Her leg extended again, tracing half-circles on the floor—after a while, as the movement started to become less rote and more hypnotic, dreamy. She dipped into a plie and rose again, her arms loosening, mirroring the gesture of her leg—she was still at the barre, still performing the same six steps, but they were slowly melting into a dance, her body telling a story instead of reciting it. By the time she stepped away from the barre and floated, on point, to the center of the stage, Steve felt like he’d watched a butterfly fight its way out of a chrysalis, then perch on a waving stalk until wind blew it aloft. It wasn’t a warmup, it was a transformation; as he watched her stretch and move, extending her arms as if beseeching someone and just as quickly retracting them in fear, he felt as if he were in the presence of an entire life, expressed simply by movement. It went on, for an hour, two hours, impossible to say. He was so hypnotized he didn’t even notice that it was over until she’d turned off the stereo and picked up her towel, flipping it over her shoulder and coming to the middle of the stage to face him. In her eyes, a cool and steady question.
May mouthed incredulously, and Shuri nodded. “She works on humanitarian and border issues. Six months out of the year she’s in the field, and the other six she’s working on her doctorate. We hardly ever see her. I had to bribe
“Probably not,” said Steve, “Which is why we’re not going to the infirmary. We’re going to the administrative building. I want to find out where they moved him, and they won’t tell me because I’m not related to him. With any luck, it’s a fairly local hospital.”
Steve didn’t look over at Tony, but his grin grew just a little bit. “Yeah,” he said, looking out over the glowing pools full of drunken Avengers, the sparkling ocean beyond. “That’s so.”
Tony’s gaze snapped off to a spot on the wall beyond Fury’s left ear, a move calculated to infuriate.
“This is something we’re caring about now?” Clint said, only to get thwacked soundly across the chest by Natasha, who up until now had been silently shoveling in food at a grim and furious rate.
Thor shook his head. “No. It ceased when I left the well.” He looked around the van at the others. “I owe you all a debt for retreiving me. While it was beautiful to dream of such things, I do not think such visions are healthy.”
“You know what, IKEA, I don’t go over to your lingonberry bog and call it backwards,” started Clint, and Bruce held up his hands: “Woah, woah, woah, let’s all calm down a little—Natasha, where are you going?”
“Is that it? I thought Belorussian. Russian, Belorussian, potato, potahto, right? Anyway, you hear about her?”
“Yeah. Um. That’s. Yeah. Really good to hear.” Tony’s eyes were scanning Steve a mile a minute, like Steve’s face was written in very small print.
while ignoring the smell of Tony’s… soldering? Was it still soldering, or had the project on the radiator technically crossed the line into welding? Steve snapped back to Tony’s question.
Steve joined Tony under the smoke detector, waving a rolled-up copy of Spin. “Why only this semester?”
Tony, hair standing up on one side, was stepping out of the van with a toohbrush sticking out of his mouth. “Has anyone seen my copy of—oh fuck.”
“What,” Steve said to the bird. Right on cue, thunder rumbled overhead, and a clump of rhododendrons overhanging the driveway decided to dump its cold leaf-load of rainwater right down the back of Steve’s neck. “Yeaaargh,” he said, shaking the water out of his sweatshirt. Then he looked up at the white, flat sky. “Alright, alright, you made your point.”
“Yep.” He hopped off the ledge, stepping towards Steve and taking Steve’s hand in his, pressing Steve’s fingers to a point a few centimeters to the left of the jagged scar. “Right… here.” Under Steve’s fingers, Tony’s heartbeat thudded warmly. “It happened when I was fifteen and under the custodial care of my father’s business partner,” he said, almost conversationally. “My parents were divorcing and the courts decided both of them were too drunk to be parents, so…” He sniffed. “Anyway. That’s when my heart decided to start going haywire. Panic attacks, or at least they thought at first. I don’t remember too much except I blacked out on spring break and woke up in the cardiac unit of Dubai General.”
Steve moaned, lost in the sensation of Tony moving over him, that blunt nudge of Tony’s cock opening him up, the push and pull and salt and sweat of it—Tony’s forearm was right there, and to stop himself from moaning something too raw, something like “I love you,” he opened his mouth and sucked a reddening bite against it, marking Tony’s arm, at least, as his.
“Don’t touch that,” Tony said shortly, brushing past Steve on the way back into the room. “That’s a taser.”
“Well, you could be back at SHIELD. What is it, one-thirty? What would you be doing right now?” said Tony, wading through a waist-high bramble.
“Coma this, coma that, Jesus, why is everyone hopping on this coma trend?” Tony griped. “First Steve, then his suuuuper secret boyfriend—”
“Well, I have a boyfriend, but I hear Barton’s looking,” said Tony. “Barton! Thor! Let’s get a move on! You too, Borscht Spice,” he said, looking Natasha up and down. “You any good with batting your eyelashes at military types?”
To Steve’s immense surprise, Tony showed up on Wednesday, ten minutes late and wearing jeans.  He stood at the edge of the field, looking embarrassed and confused, until a foul call gave Steve a chance to jog over and greet him.
“If we don’t get shot. Hey, has anyone thought about the logistics of breaking into what is essentially military property?”
Tony managed to close his mouth—barely—as Aunt May padded in from the bathroom, wrapped in a white towel and wearing an identical grin to Pepper’s. He blinked. Opened his mouth. Closed it again. “Well, I’ll be damned,” he finally said. “Good vacation.”
A wadded, wet napkin hit him in the face. Then an empty soda cup. Then a small hail of other assorted lunch trash.
“This looks like the kind of place they’ve got at least three places you can buy meth,” said Scott, inching the van around a hairpin turn that included a railroad crossing, “during recess.”
“I know, that’s their beauty. Lightweight, tempered aluminum, look like nothing at all, but these puppies can take five hundred pounds of pressure per square centimeter before they buckle. You get hit in the face with one, it’s gonna leave a mark. But they feel and wear just like rings—sleepable, comfortable. They’re rust-proof, so she can take ‘em in the shower if she wants to, feel less vulnerable there. They’re slightly articulated—basically, she could play piano in ‘em without compromising dexterity. Or, you know. Just knock seven bells out of anyone who bothered her. I think your girlfriend will like them.”
“Yeah,” said Clint Barton, climbing forward through the van. “Budge over.” Taking the seat from Tony, he adjusted the height of the steering wheel and the mirrors. “Jesus Christ, Stark, how short
A half-sheepish chorus of hellos greeted him from all, except from Tony, who stood motionless in the center of the group, the folded scratch-off ticket slipping out of his fingers and fluttering, unnoticed, to the floor.
“If you don’t talk about it with me, at least talk about it with somebody,” said Sam sagely. “It’s not good to bottle feelings up. It makes white people climb clock towers and start shooting people.”
Yawns and general assent greeted the idea, and sleeping space was quickly ironed out and flashlights extinguished—which Tony was glad for, because everyone needed sleep. He wouldn’t, of course—he rarely did. He lay awake, listening to the thud of his heart in his own ears, until dawn.
“No, his last known appearance at SHIELD and his run times,” said Tony, pulling a tattered envelope out of his other pocket and passing it backwards as he steered the van around a hairpin curve. Barton, who sat within direct flail range of Tony, took the paper and read the scribbled notes there, his eyebrows climbing into his hairline, before passing it to Bruce. “Stalker much?” the archer asked Tony.
She watched him in the mirror as he backed away, waiting until he’d re-opened the fire door before speaking.
Steve pressed the exposed end to his neck. When he came to, Tony was leaning over him in the bunk, thumb prying one of Steve’s eyelids open.
Steve flushed, stumbling out of his jeans and into the fountain, where he had to catch himself against the SHIELD sign to keep from slipping. “Hey. It’s warm.”
“Pssst. Psssst. Pssssst. Rogers. Psst.” The knee-jiggling was now dampened by two desks and the still-silent Natasha Romanov, but nothing on earth could stifle Clint Barton when he wanted to get your attention. Steve sighed.
Thor, grimacing as he rose from the ground, wiped the small, sharp pebbles from his hands. “Aye, I am sure you did,” he said graciously to Barton. “Would you like to loosen the others before I begin on them?”
The next play went quickly as Steve, distracted by the sight of Tony looking ill-at-ease on the sidelines, missed an easy interception and watched the disc go floating airily into the hands of a visibly surprised Sam Wilson.
Walking across the tarmac from a smaller Cessna, Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne waved sheepishly. “Hi, guys,” said Scott. “Thanks for inviting us.”
A few moments later, Clint spoke: “I want it on record that we’ve now been through this forest three times.
,” he whispered against Steve’s mouth, and before Steve could gasp sealed it with a rough kiss. Steve felt Tony’s fist, wet with sweat, grip down on his shaft and tug it hard, and he whimpered into Tony’s mouth as his own hips chased Tony’s hand upwards.
“Ugh,” said Barton, but obediently tilted his head back so Steve could finish the job. By the time he was finished, Barton seemed to have forgotten about his earlier line of questioning. “Hey, thanks. Sitwell, am I good to go?”
“What is crankshaft?” Natasha asked Peter Parker, who nearly swallowed his tongue at having been addressed by her.
“No I mean the other movie! Damnit, Banner, which movie do I mean?” Lang said, smacking the cafeteria table in frustration.
“Are teenagers not trusted to travel in America?” Thor asked. “In Norway, many youths have apprentice jobs that they drive to in the evenings—”
“Kitchen’s through that door,” said Sitwell. “Ice pack’s in the freezer. Help yourself and bring it back tomorrow.”
“Don’t forget brilliant Ultimate Frisbee player,” said Tony, whose team had administered Steve’s a rather sound drubbing earlier in the day.
Steve walked through the small crowd of rousted-out, grumpy-looking SHIELD Academy students to where Tony stood with Maria Hill, who was brandishing a clipboard. A group of girls with wet hair and facial masks gave Steve dirty looks as he passed, as if he—just by being Tony Stark’s roommate—had been responsible for the fire evacuation. “Yeah?”
“You alright, man?” Sam said, straightening up as his teammates cheered. “Normally I wouldn’t even get close to that.”
“That’s true,” said Sitwell, still without looking around. “Mister Barton is the soul of discretion, I never get so much as the name of a coffee table out of him. Other students, though, are very interested in the state of your love life.”
“Well, maybe that’s your problem. Chop chop, everyone in the Mystery Machine, we’re going for a ride.”
“Hey!” Steve said, shaking the heavy, sleep-scented sweatshirt from his face and running after Tony, up the long and curving driveway, past the turnoff for the maintenance sheds and the soccer fields, to where the big SHIELD Academy sign, lit with floodlights, presided over a decorative multilayered fountain outlined in expensive slabs of sandstone. The SHIELD Academy specialized in the problem children of the rich and powerful, kids who’d gotten kicked out of Andover or Phillips Exeter or Nassau County Day. And while they supplemented their ranks with ESL and international students like Natasha and Thor (and charity cases like Steve, a little voice whispered), near-delinquents like Tony Stark were—quietly, unspokenly—the school’s bread and butter. The school made up for it with window dressing; the expensive fountain and laser-cut copper sign; buildings named conspicuously after minor Gettys and cousins of Carnegies; mottoes in Latin. Scratch the surface and you’d find a crumbling Victorian edifice, cracks in the foundation, dandelions growing up through the tennis courts. Algae in the fountains.
After a while, Tony begins to study him, his heart pounding like a jackhammer in his chest, something akin to fear slithering against his lungs.
skin, and the acceptance that Steve and her would get in society by being together, by performing the way society wants them to, by fulfilling all of the expectations and becoming the ideal monument to what beautiful, happy, in-love people look like, something which Tony, even with his wealth, with his dark skin, and the babies that he has with Steve, who have inherited Tony’s dark skin, will never get.
He watches a myriad of expressions flutter across Ms Lewis’ face, watches her hesitate for an agonising moment.
“Steve, I… I had a really bad dream in class,” he stutters, feeling stupid even as the words leave his mouth.
, because she knows this, and I know this – she and I were meant for each other. She will always come back to me. I know it hurts, man. I know it sucks too, ‘cause you’re willing to do all of this for her, but come on, you didn’t really think that the two of you were going to end up happily ever after.”
, again, I will hurt you,” he says, softly. “You do whatever the fuck you want when you leave this house, Steve, I don’t care anymore. I don’t… I don’t have the bandwidth to care anymore, but if you bring your whore near me or my kids, it won’t end well for you, I can promise you that. You won’t like what I do at
Finally, Steve returns and climbs back on the bed. Tony hears the shutter of the camera and he clenches down again, with a low, keening whine at the back of his throat.
Tony punches Steve in the chest; Steve just tips with the blow, and he’s a little irritated that it does nothing to him.
. I was only seventeen and I was fucking tired, so I started searching out an assassin that I knew was capable of disembowelling old, white men.”
“Please,” Tony says, his voice pained, breathless, “please, I don’t want to talk about this. I just…” he trails off. “I want to explain it to you, and no offence, Sam, but I’m already baring my insides to you in a way that I never even thought I would, and I want to give you that explanation that you’re owed. Please, please, just let me do that.”
After all, they have two little children, and frankly, most of Tony’s time is taken up with them, and he’s exhausted when they finally go home, and Steve is exhausted when he gets home from work.
His hand moves to the centre of Steve’s back, feeling the notches of his spine through the thin shirt that he’s wearing. He tilts his head, nudging his nose against Steve’s shoulder.
“I didn’t. There was… well, in my head, there never seemed to be a good time. We were looking for HYDRA and the sceptre, and then, there was Ultron, and then, you’d left and I was training the new Avengers, and then, there was the Accords… I kept putting it off. I kept telling myself that I had time, that this wasn’t a good time for a whole host of reasons. Now, I know… or rather, I can acknowledge that the reason why I didn’t tell you was because I didn’t want to, because I was scared to tell you, because I knew that it would change things.”
Tony breathes sharp and hot, and Hodge is pressed up against him, head to toe, his scent turning Tony’s stomach, clammy with lust and sweat, and there’s a hand nudging between their bodies, a wet, smacking noise of Hodge’s hand on his cock making the bile rise up in Tony’s throat, sour and bitter.
Grant follows his eyes and finds Barnes standing there, staring at them. He leans into Tony, their shoulders knocking together (Barnes terrifies him so greatly, a powerful alpha figure, that he doesn’t even baulk at his goodbrother touching him with so much familiarity).
Steve’s hand surrounds Tony, sending something vivid, like shock, up his spinal cord, and then he’s being dragged away, dragged out of the bar, which is what leads Tony to watch as his bar burns down right in front of his eyes.
“All I’m saying is that Stevie and me, we don’t want to do anything without you. If something happens between us right now, and believe me, I’d really like for something to happen between us, but it has to happen between all of us, or it doesn’t happen at all,” James says, finally. “You’re just as important to this relationship as we are, and there’s no fucking way that you’re sitting on the sidelines during this.”
Phillips approaches, with that permanent grouchy expression on his face. “Rogers, you just embarrassed a senior senator in front of a dozen reporters and ten members of Parliament.” He shoves the medal into Steve’s hands. “You should get a medal just for that.” He nods at the cartridge in Tony’s hand. “You figure out what this is, yet?”
“Maybe he does, but that doesn’t mean he’s a good husband or the husband that you deserve,” James points out.
Steve rolls down his sleeve, once the nurse removes the canula from his vein. “Erskine deserved more than that,” he says, quietly.
Tony shoves him off, an angry word on the tip of his tongue, but Grant just laughs it off, tells him that he was so beautiful in the moonlight that he couldn’t help himself.
“Yes,” Tony blurts out, eager to foster some kind of relationship with his alpha. “Yes, I would like to go riding.”
He hesitates for a moment before laying his hand on Tony’s shoulder, worried that Tony might react in fear or anger – after all, it makes sense, considering that he is the spitting image of the men that had raped Tony over and over again.
“His name is James,” Tony replies, without taking his eyes off the man in question. “He’s an old friend of mine from college.”
“I was quiet,” he finishes, lamely. “And I was a genius. So… I knew a hundred times what people my own age knew, and then, I was skipping through grades at warp speed. Oh, and I was in boarding school, and my cohort didn’t like the fact that I was smarter than them. So, by fourteen, I was in college-”
Steve takes a deep breath, and Tony thinks that if he flattened his palm against Steve’s chest, he would feel his heart pounding like a jackhammer.
“Tony,” Steve says, sharp and taut, staring at him, “you’re keeping something from me. Don’t lie to me.”
That done, Steve brings a brass, painted spittoon down on the Giant Nazi’s wrist, and the gun slides away. Steve climbs to his feet and kicks the Giant Nazi in the face, who barely seems to feel it. He grabs Steve and flips him effortlessly onto a table.
. That’s not…” Steve looks away, his jaw clenching down hard. “I love you. I love you so fucking much. And maybe it sucks, maybe it’s really fucking terrible for me to tell you this, but I love you enough to lie to you, just so you’ll be safe and the kids will be safe. I’d do a lot worse to keep you safe and alive, Tony, even if it means you hate me by the end of it. I don’t…” He rubs his hands over his face. “You and the kids, you’re everything to me.”
“You see, Ser James has a face that rests in anger, which makes him more fearsome than he intends to be,” the woman says, her eyes flashing like a cat’s. “Conversely, you might see him singing to cats, soft his heart is.”
Warnings for this chapter: past implied/referenced attempted sexual assault of a third party, issues around consent when Tony was younger, implied/referenced past drug abuse.
Fear curdles in his chest, and he backs away, something lodged in his throat. He edges into a stairwell and looks down, seeing a strange orange light dancing that makes him think that there’s a fire somewhere down there.
James smiles a smile that is no smile at all. “A picture of you and me, at that fair we went to. You remember?”
So, what does his pride matter in the long run, if it means that he can keep Steve and his family whole?
remember what Stane did to me back then?” Tony demands. “Because I sure as hell don’t. So, isn’t it possible that we, that I, some of us, all of us, we lied. The only evidence that would… paint him as this child abuser are those tapes, our testimonies, our voices. If we destroy those tapes, maybe, just maybe–”
“I have lied about a lot, I know. I lied about my job, about the late nights, about Natasha and what we were to each other.”
“Not a very healthy coping mechanism,” Sam says, his voice softer than it’s been since Tony knocked on the door of his hospital room.
Steve smiles at him, the line of his mouth trembling somewhat at the edges. “Oh, you know, a little nervous. Got the jitters, I guess.”
Steve grunts, and Tony can see his hands fisting in the sheets. Tony smiles, and his fingers curl around the base of his cock, and in response, Steve ruts against his grip, his cock jumping. Tony’s hand starts sliding his fist along his shaft, while his mouth angles over the head of his cock, sucking softly.
The pantry is quiet and dead-silent when he steps in, and the lights switch on after they track his footsteps when he gets closer to the wine that he has stashed behind a dark wicker basket full of pasta. He pulls back the basket, so he can reach behind, wince at the skin of the basket’s bristle against his bare skin in that tank top he’s wearing. He almost shouts with a thrill of triumph when his fingers curl around the neck of the bottle, and he grits his teeth a little when he tries to pull it out, without toppling over the entire basket.
Tony flinches, and Steve’s muscles bunch tight under his skin, his hand turning to steel around Tony’s.
Tony had told him the stories all those years together when he was more than just Steve’s colleague’s son.
He closes the door to their bedroom behind him, once he enters, and turns to face Steve, his back pressed against it. His throat flexes around the lump that forms in his throat as he considers Steve.
Tony collapses against James’ chest, fisting his hand in his shirt, deflating like a tire with a hole in it.
It’s not that Barnes isn’t his type, because he absolutely is, but he remembers what it felt like to have Steve’s hands on him, and that’s what he wants, nothing more, nothing less.
James grins, slightly. “You know, baby doll, you slept for a long time. I think you were really tired. Stevie and I woke up a couple of hours ago. We were gonna wake you up to eat something, but we figured you needed the sleep. When it was time to pick up the kids, Steve offered to go and grab ‘em, take ‘em to wherever they needed to go today. So, I decided to grab another nap with you.”
Tony slants a disbelieving glower over her shoulder. “Who do you think you’re talking to?” he demands.
“Yeah, kid, we’re not fighting anymore,” Steve says, and Tony can feel it, the weight of his stare on the back of his skull.
The three of them run into a hiding spot behind some water barrels near the Command Tent. They peek their heads out at the sound of activity. In the big space near the command tent is parked an open German staff car; inside is a blond driver and an armed guard. Directly behind it is a canvas-topped troop truck. At this moment, Rumlow and another Nazi are supervising the careful placement of the crated gem in the back of the truck, as if they are terrified to let it fall into open hands.
“No, we shouldn’t do this,” Steve says, his eyes focused on Toni and then, they make their way to the set-up of the wedding behind them.
“She’s okay. They just knocked her out with something,” Sam says, his face drawn and thin. “So, uh, they want to keep her here overnight to observe her, just in case she’s got a concussion. She just got to bed.”
“That’s not what? Not true?” Steve mocks, and he coughs again, wrapping an arm around his ribs, his fist pressed against his chest, before he lifts his head, his expression momentarily irritated with himself. “At least be honest with me.”
“No, Steve, it happens to humans too,” Tony insists. “Or, or, maybe there was something in the water last night, and we all drank it, and we just had… like a communal nightmare experience or something.”
Steve drags his hand over his face. “I didn’t… I didn’t want to fight,” he says, wearily. “I’ve had a long day.”
Tony shakes his head. “There are… he has so many secrets from me, Wanda,” he says, more of a whisper than anything. “He doesn’t tell me where he’s going; he’s out of the house constantly, and he tells me that it’s just work, that he’s so busy at the office; what fucking insurance claims agent is
Tony knows who is believed when such things are given voice, and the newly bonded omega is never believed.
, in Steve’s vicinity, which leaves them cowering in fear when Steve absolutely loses his shit and calls them
Coulson and Steve rush into the cell. Steve climbs to the bars and unties the knot, which leads to Natasha sliding down over Coulson’s shoulders, limp as a marionette with its strings slashed.
Toni smooths his hair back away from his face. “Amma loves you more than anything, Petey-pie,” she murmurs, her heart swelling in her chest.
Steve’s fingers work their way between his legs, and Tony exhales, when a finger slides inside Tony’s body, stretching him dry.
“I’m a grown-ass adult, Steve,” Tony reminds him, mouth a flat, unwavering line. “I know when to drink and when not to drink.”
Tony lets his hands slip from the bedposts and wraps them around Steve’s broad, pale shoulders. He lets his chest tilt upwards, lets it rub against the thatch of blonde hair covering Steve’s chest, so fine and pale that if you blinked, you would miss it.
“Hey, this is actually because of you,” Steve retorts. “I have no fucking idea what you got up to back in college, but that’s who’s come back to haunt us, sweetheart, not my job.”
He takes a deep, steadying breath, and then, mashes the burning point of the light against his forearm. He grunts as his skin begins to broil and sizzle. When he pulls the lighter away, there’s a red, shiny streak across his forearm, matching the one on his other arm from when he’d burned it on the smoking pipe.
Tony lifts his head. “You’re okay with this, aren’t you?” he asks, wondering if he’s too heavy for him.
That being said, he doubts there is no such thing for an easy life for a father who is actually interested in having children, raising them, loving him.
“Don’t ruin it,” Tony says, sternly. “Don’t. I don’t…” He takes a deep, steadying breath. “I already know what you’re going to say, and I don’t want to hear it. I just, I think we’ve both had a long couple of days, and I just want to sleep.”
“And I’ve noticed lately that he seems to be down. To be honest, I’m worried about him,” Natasha says, carefully.
you for sex, used you for your skill and expertise, when in reality, I fucking broke my own heart at the same time I broke yours. You didn’t just lose me; I lost you too.”
Steve turns to Tony, pleading and pained. “Tony, Tony, shit, I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have… I shouldn’t have kissed him without talking to you first, and I know, I know we were supposed to talk about this and take this slow, and you, Bucky, Bucky, you’re still healing, and you’re probably not ready for this step, and-”
Tony purses his lips, and there’s rage now, rage burning hot and fast, lumping up in his throat. He turns on his feet and storms away from the library, before he says something he regrets.
His hands slide down from James’ hair, over his strong jaw, where the stubble is shallowly growing, down his neck and over the line of his shoulders. His hands still when they reach the raw, ragged muscle where his metal arm meets his shoulder and ribcage, but he doesn’t stop his exploration. In fact, his hands get curiouser, and he smooths them down his chest, over all of that hard, ridged muscle, and his abdomen, before reaching between his legs and grasps his cock in his slim, dark hand.
“And then, when I’m done, you’re going to grab one of those fake, plastic dicks that you keep in the box in the closet, and I’m going to fuck yourself with it until you come and film it, okay?”
He looks over his shoulder, unlatching the lock on the door that Steve had so responsibly attached when he’d closed the door behind him.
“It’s okay,” Steve says, fiercely, dragging his hand over his face. “I love Tony; I love Bucky, and I… I know where that conversation was coming from. I’m not… I’m not
“So… uh, you work at the insurance company with Steve?” Tony asks, a little confused by the idea of a redhead who looks like her working at an insurance company unless they
PhDs, and you were simultaneously writing theses for four other doctorates. You were the most terrifyingly intelligent and capable person I’d ever met. You were on your way to becoming one of the richest men in the world, the CEO of an insanely large company. Your life… there was nothing that I could give you that would match that. There was nothing that I could give you that would make you feel like you’d given up something

Steve nods. “Natasha had a very complicated upbringing. She… she was stolen from her family as a child, taken to this secret facility where they raised little girls to become cold-blooded assassins in service of the Soviet Union.”
“Bold of you to accuse me of being a liar, considering you’re the one who’s been getting in bed with the fucking Black Widow,” he says, in a flat, gravelly voice.
“Thor was going to officiate the wedding,” Toni reminds him. “We might be missing a key component of the wedding if he leaves.”
, and maybe that’s fucked me up more than I realised, maybe that’s fucked up my concept of trust in a relationship. Because I genuinely thought if I pointed out my flaws, the cracks in our relationship, you would leave. Because I scared to have you stand here and tell me that you were screwing someone else, and
“Gone,” Tony says, adamantly. “I sold it all, It was all junk. The junk he wasted his life and my mother’s life and my life on.”
compromised. I… I thought the Winter Soldier was hurting you, and I was going to go into that apartment and kill him for it. I thought you’d fooled me all these years; I thought you were screwing around with the Winter Soldier and using me to get intel. I thought you were honeypotting me, and I was going to let you leave.”
“Hey,” Bucky says, gently, and his big, warm palms land on her shoulders, his thumbs dragging over the sharp curve of her collarbone. “Look at me.”
His lungs are in his throat when he stretches himself out like a cat on top of the bed, naked, waiting, allowing himself to be as alluring as possible, when he hears the door creak. Grant slips in between the shard of empty space between the door and the door frame.
Tony’s hands are trembling when he rips open the condom packet, and the rubber falls out into his palm. It’s greasy, much to his surprise, most likely designed to help ease the way, not that Tony needs that help, considering that he’s still leaking slick like a sieve.
Peter’s eyes track up to catch Tony’s, widened in obscene awe. “Really?” he says, straddling the line between hushed amazement and excitement.
kids from school? Are you angry that I was out and you didn’t know where I was? Are you angry that I was out at
Lord Steven joins him moments later, thrust into the bedchamber as well, with scraps of his clothing hanging off his broad, muscled shoulders and hips.
The dip in Sam’s brow furrows further. “Why do I know that name-” he pauses, and Tony waits as realisation sets in. “Wait, fuck, that was…” the words look like they dry up in his mouth, “Steve, he had a friend, his best friend, from Brooklyn, right? That was… that guy was-”
He closes the door on his way out; Tony waits until the footfalls fade, and then, he spits out the pill in his hand, before moving out of the bed and throwing it out of the window, before he pops one of the Adderall and swallows it.
in this thing,” pointed out Sam. “If this thing is about to fall apart I think—you know what, on second thought, I’d rather not know,” he said, and Scott shrugged.
“Bet I could find a way to make us fit,” Tony said, nipping at the underside of Steve’s chin, pulling a high-pitched whine out of him.
“Really shoulda had a name in mind before you started that sentence, genius,” Sitwell told him, handing him a wad of gauze. “Here. Bite down on this. It’ll stop your bleeding problem and your speaking problem.”
Tony shrugged. “I’m amazing at lots of things. Speaking of which…” He stopped, looked around, then grabbed Steve by the shirt and tugged him into an empty custodial closet, backing up until he was sitting on the rim of the tiny, rusting sink. “C’mon, close the door.”
“Was it? Yeah, I guess? I guess it was? Anyway. Uh. I got some… some work I gotta… get back to,” said Tony, sitting down at his desk and tapping his laptop’s keyboard to wake it, shutting Steve out as firmly and smoothly as if he’d closed a door to an office. Steve waited for a second, but Tony’s back was a wall, and so he let himself quietly out of the room. It was only when the door closed behind him that he realized he had no idea where he intended to go. All his homework and his sketchbook were in the room behind him, and the idea of slinking back in to retrieve them was less than appealing. So Steve did what he always did when he felt at loose ends; he went out for a run.
“It’s based off the Beverly Hills Cop thing, you know, with the old foil chewing gum wrappers,” said Lang.
Tony looked sideways at Steve. “Are you sassing me right now? Cause I gotta say, it kinda feels like you’re sassing me right now.”
“Actually, come to think of it, no,” said Nurse Sitwell cheerfully. “It’s more the state of Tony Stark’s love life that everyone is interested in. You’re just the collateral damage,
Clint reached across Natasha’s shoulder to poke, gently, at Steve’s skull, tilting his head over for inspection. Steve let it slide. He was getting used to Clint’s total lack of boundaries. Either that or it was like a Stockholm Syndrome thing.
“Not likely, next week we play Hydra in Ultimate!” Tony yelled over his shoulder as the door closed between them. In an undertone to Steve, he muttered, “That
“Hey, if the shoe fits, then steals a car, straps itself in diapers, and drives across Florida with its romantic rival in the trunk.”
asshole.” Steve spoke up for the first time since leaving Queens, and twelve heads—Tony, Pepper, Clint, Natasha, Coulson, Rhodey, Sam, Bruce, Thor, Stephen Strange, Peter and Aunt May—all swiveled in unison to look at him. Steve was peering darkly through the rear window of the limousine like he was trying to discern which of the dozens of near-identical Embraers and Gulfstreams and Bombadiers could belong to the real estate tycoon.
“Not much,” Steve said, letting himself down into a chair with relief. “What happened to you this time?”
“I’m pretty sure this is meth country,” said Bruce, watching a hard-faced mother escort two children out of the convenience store and down the road.
“Let’s have a look at that, shall we?” he said mildly, and turned the boy’s arm over. Deep in the scrape, tiny bits of the shattered blue glass still sparkled. Steve watched the boy’s eyes. They never left his teacher’s face.
“Are you serious right now?” said Scott, “Ow ow ow ow ow,” as Sam grasped him by the ear and gently lead him down the hallway. Tony ignored the hissed whispering behind him and kept checking doors: woman, woman, three empty rooms, old woman, old man, young boy, empty room, teenage girl. All were comatose; none looked like they’d had visitors in a long time. Which seemed… off, somehow. An old person could have no living relatives, sure. But a teenaged girl should have cards, pictures, lots of glittery posters reading “Team Taylor”. Stuff like that. Tony kept moving, kept listening for Steve, who’d gone ominously silent.
“Because of course he is,” moaned Bruce Banner, who had been sitting on a pile of snow tires with his head in his hands for the last five minutes.
“Ditto football, basketball, baseball. Soccer doesn’t really have a uniform, technically, but they have practices twice a day at four and seven—”
“My father tried to send me there,” Tony said. “Professor Xavier himself took exactly one look at me and sent me back out the door. My hand to God.”
“Holy shit that’s a lady,” said Tony. “I swear to God until I saw the ponytail I had no idea. Now it’s all I can think about.”
“This would… be… easier, if you would all… stop… staring,” the large blond gritted out, straining against the tire iron.
“Yes!” said Thor with relish. “I fell in and was struck mightily. But I am mightier, and I merely dreamt while others might have drowned. My good friend Sam pulled me out! With friend Stark’s assistance,” Thor added, after a glance at Tony and Steve.
said Clint, but his tone was tempered by admiration as he inspected the wad of gauze before jamming it between his back teeth.
Later that night, as the SHIELD students huddled close in the van around an upturned flashlight, Thor told them about his accident.
“Face it, you decided to get in the van the second I offered,” said Tony, walking backwards towards the open passenger door. “Guys! Rally! Let’s burn some rubber!” He looked directly at Sam for a fraction of a second, and Sam could swear he saw the whisper of a wink, before Tony turned and was climbing back into the driver’s seat, and Sam was shaking his head, running for the open door.
“Sir, this is Natasha Romanoff,” Barton said, something new and awed and tender in his voice, and Steve noticed Barton was standing a lot taller than he normally did.
“I will keep that in mind,” said Shuri, grinning. “Really, you should have seen the begging I had to do to get my brother to agree to this vacation. He is such a workaholic. I had to bribe him.”
“Holy shniekes,” the nurse said, dropping the cotton balls and tape on the exam table and grabbing Bruce’s arm. “Barton, your nose is gonna have to wait while I do triage.”
“You are a very, very odd person,” Tony informed Barton. When no response was forthcoming, he went and sat beside Bruce.
“Have care how you speak about Steven’s friend,” came a voice from the end of the table. Thor had apparently pulled himself away from the tiny brunette he’d been nuzzling and joined the conversation. “Tony Stark’s mind may be far afield, but his heart is obviously cleaved to Rogers.”
“Yeah. Come on, get up and come in. You won’t be sorry you ate something, come four in the morning when everything’s closed, trust me, honey, the Port Authority in Philly is next to
Tony looked around. Everyone else was vaguely trying to look as though they were busy keeping watch. The administrative building was completely deserted, Sunday-quiet. Occasionally, the A/C would click on with a soft whirr. Tony hated the soft administrative Xerox-scent of this building—something about it went right up his ass. “Does this feel weird?” he asked Steve, who was standing next to him, ams folded. “Being back here like this?”
A chorus of groans arose, and Tony rose above them with a hollered, “All right, all right, settle. Let’s pull over and get pizza, backtracking will be less awful once we’re all fed.”
“Well, are we even on the right side of campus?” Bruce asked reasonably. “Steve, which building is the infirmary?”
Steve stilled, abruptly, around the guffaw which—damnit—was definitely happening, blowjob or not. He let Tony’s cock slip from his mouth. “Your parents have a vacation house in the Hamptons?”
“Just so you can keep inventing stuff?” Steve asked, hoping that his voice didn’t sound so damn hopeful.
“Who, Barton? Who knows. Shoelaces, banana peels, I tripped over a nun. I just patch ‘em up, man, I don’t ask questions,” Sitwell said lightly. “Time for you to go back to class, anyway.”
“So saying I did,” said Steve, trusting that Sam would pick up his meaning from before, not make him spell it out. “Um. How much trouble would I be in?”
“They can if they’re a black widow,” said Scott. “Are you having numbness and tingling in your left arm?”
“Don’t feel bad,” said Bruce, reaching over and patting Steve’s hand comfortingly. “It’s Tony Stark’s world, we’re all just playing in it.”
Clint snorted. “Trust me. Even disoriented, Tasha’s not a klutz. She’ll be smart with it. I just think she’d sleep better knowing she had a weapon handy.”
“There were situps,” Steve admitted, tilting Barton’s head back to get a better look at the nose. “Your nose is out of joint.”
. Steve had never realized how intense a hookup could get while still remaining, technically, a hookup: Tony and he didn’t hold hands down the hallways, or send each other lots of texts, or do anything particularly romantic at all, and yet every time he stepped in the room at the end of the day Tony would come at him with that
“Oh, no,” said Steve. “That wasn’t it, see, he set off the fire alarm, and he had this deal with Hill that if he did that he’d have to pick a sport.”
Tony took the card, set it into the card reader crease-first, and swiped. With a thudding sound, the lock opened.
They both watched the opposing team horsing around, Tony capturing Scott Lang’s head under his elbow and ruffling his hair. Sam shook his head. “You know that little punk put me on the ground once?”
“Yeah well, it wasn’t your choice,” said Tony lightly. “I followed you. They’re following me. Ergo, not your responsibility. No muss, no fuss. Hey, someone save me a seat!” He climbed into the van, leaving Steve to wonder why he still felt guilty.
“That is disgusting,” Tony said, looking back to the road in time to avoid a particularly pesky tree. “Please, someone strap Barton to the roof rack.”
“Yep. It’s perfect. Meets twice a week, no uniforms, no helmets, you won’t even mess up your hair.” Steve clapped Tony on the shoulder. “Trust me, it’s fun.”
tilting an empty desk in the next row over with his other foot, Steve was gonna go with “undiagnosed ADHD” instead.
nice.” Okoye wriggled her shoulders against a jet of the deep Jacuzzi that already contained Natasha, Hope Van Dyne, Aunt May, and Shuri. Once she was comfortable, she accepted a pour of the pinot noir that they were passing around.
“Here, I’m solving our problem,” Barton announced, peeling up the grooved matting from the floor of the van. “Pardon me, coming through, carpet full of pee.” At speed, he opened the back door of the van and pitched the matting—a long, wavering horn tone sounded from behind the van as Barton tugged the door shut. “There. Problem solved.”
“Here,” called Barton, still at it with the knee-jiggling. It felt like he had a belt sander going underneath the desk. Steve tried to maneuver his shoulders to get the vibration right at the sore spot under his left shoulderblade where Peter Parker (not looking) had run straight into him at last practice.
“Yeah, no wonder he likes you,” Sam said. “I ever tell you I saw that guy walk straight into a Young Republicans afterschool meeting and punch their president right in the face?”
"Oh no," said Pepper. "I know better than to insert myself into this romance. Go, enjoy yourself. I have eyes on another prize this weekend, anyway."
“Clean up your components or they’re going in the trash next time I come round,” called Maria, her voice floating off down the hall.
“Guys, guys, back off, give him some space,” said Tony, and everyone moved three to four steps away, where they tried to look vaguely interested in the office furniture. Steve opened the folder and began reading.
“Shut up, Clint,” Steve grumbled, trying to conceal his smile. It was nice, having friends. And right on cue, there came the rush of guilt—like he’d somehow betrayed Bucky in some complex way by making friends here at SHIELD. Like he should’ve stayed there, where Bucky was. Like he never should’ve woken up, or should still be waiting there for Buck to do the same. Steve would’ve, is the thing—he wanted to stay. But there’s only so long you can spend out of school before you have to be enrolled
. And Tony did taste good—he might’ve smelled like solder and grease, but he tasted like coffee and clove, dark and rich and sweet, like the kind of spice that people used to carry back from India. And before Steve could say something like,
“And here I thought we were gonna make it to a whole hour without mentioning that,” said Sam, and Steve snorted.
“What, this?” Clint said, and gave a long, obnoxious stretch, pulling the shirt up another three inches and stroking his stomach lewdly. “I’m also the god of not shrinking my laundry.”
“Come on, why so modest. I’ve heard about how you throw down, that security guard coulda killed you and instead he went off with his tail between his legs.”
“And to think they put other people’s kids in this,” Scott Lang said virtuously, as Thor stepped forward and wrapped both meaty hands around the iron’s handles. Straining slightly, he tugged—and the nut gave way immediately, dropping him to the gravel.
“I guess,” Steve said, stepping over the laundry basket to place his backpack on the bed. It looked pretty small next to all Tony’s gear, but after three years of military school, Steve didn’t carry much in the way of personal items.
“Yeah well, this is the mark eight,” said Tony. “Wouldn’t be much of an engineer if I didn’t keep improving the design. Try it out.”
“Ahh, Bucksnort,” Scott Lang said around a sprayed mouthful of Pringles. “Home sweet trailer park. Hey, do you think we could buy moonshine around here?”
“Good boy,” Tony said. “That was very nice. When you’re a good boy, you get rewarded.” His hand closed over Steve’s shaft, pumping him lazily once; twice. “Does that feel good?”
“Is that your reputation?” said Sam. “Must be a quiet kind of reputation. I haven’t heard anything like that.”
“You know it,” said Tony, watching Pepper go and lower herself into the same tub. “Explain this to me, Strange. How come all the pretty women are over there and it’s a total sausage fest over here? Are we not geniuses? Is Clint rubbing off on us?”
“A van full of unsupervised teenagers, I don’t see why not,” said Tony. “What is it, three in the morning.”
"I think I might wanna sleep with Rogers," he blurted out fifteen minutes later, as Pepper puttered around their room, tidying away her--and Tony's--belongings for the weekend, swatting out the wrinkles on a shirt before hanging it in the closet.
“Прекрати это дерьмо прямо сейчас!” Everyone froze and looked guiltily at Natasha. She pointed at Steve. “You. Get him back and away from Tony.”
But Steve was already brushing past all of them, a purposeful bent to his stride as he moved to the first filing cabinet and yanked open the top drawer. “You,” he said, snapping his fingers at Bruce. “Take the second cabinet. You,” he said, pointing to Peter Parker. “Are you any good at computers?”
“Here,” said Steve, and Mr. Coulson smiled over his glasses at him. Steve didn’t think he was very special, at least not in a school with Tony Stark in it, but in Mr. Coulson’s room he got treated… differently. Not in a bad way. Just in a way that made him forget being “that weird military kid.” “That coma kid.” “That kid whose friend is
a hard challenge,” said Scott. “My cousin CiCi, season 3? She said it was a relief to get sent home before she ever had to do it.”
“Maybe,” Tony said, giving him an unreadable look, and Steve flushed even though he was pretty sure he hadn’t actually said anything dirty. “Come on, if we head down the east stairs during freshman curfew they won’t even notice we’re gone.”
“Well, it’s official. I officially hate nature,” said Tony, wiping his tongue on the hem of his t-shirt. “Even the stuff that’s supposed to rule sucks, it’s all just a bunch of smug hippie bullshit—”
“It’s all right,” said Steve. “Just because it’s grim doesn’t make it wrong. Now, how do we get in?”
“Stark Industries reports real estate holdings of three private islands and the majority share of a fourth, boss.”
me? Coulson, it’s always been Coulson, Barton’s been carrying a torch since shortly before the continents separated. It’s kind of sweet but mainly frustrating,
It’d just finished raining, which in this corner of Pennsylvania just meant that that the sky was gathering its breath for another shower; Steve’s sneakers splashed in the muddy driveway as he began to pick up pace, his body building up warmth as his muscles loosened in the cold air—by the time he got back, he’d be steaming like a horse, all his muscles twitching pleasurably. Which sounded great, except for how he couldn’t seem to get out of his head, stop running over the filmstrip of Tony’s face in the exact moment between when Clint had interrupted them and the moment when the Tony Stark Charm Offensive had been switched on. In that brief second between pure self-indulgence and pure business, had there been something like—hurt? Right as the penny dropped, Steve’s foot fell badly and a shooting spike of pain darted right up the top of his foot, all the way to the  knee. Steve went down in a cluster of tiger lilies, right next to the SHIELD Academy sign. Clutching his soaked sneaker, he sat up and tried to massage his spasming foot back into some semblance of looseness, when he noticed that the fountain was turned off. A sparrow hunched under the dry ledge of the fountain, staring balefully at Steve. Even for a fluffy bird the size of a handball, its gaze seemed accusatory.
“We were going to break into your old school and find you,” said Scott Lang. “Because, uh, reasons,” he said, shrinking under Tony’s glare.
"Ooooh. You telling?" said Tony, and she shook her head 'no', smiling broadly. "I don't want you gloating if I fail."
“Uh, okay,” agreed Steve, and turned to leave—then, a thought occurred to him. “Uh, Nurse… Sitwell?” he said, reading off the diploma on the wall.
“In Norway, the GPS signal is always very strong, even in the most remote areas, such as in glaciers,” said Thor. “I had heard that America did not have such a good cellular network, but I am surprised at just how backwards it really is.”
Steve, stretched out on his belly on the floor with a sketchbook, looked up. “She’s in my History class,” he offered. “Russian, right?”
when Sam sighed. “Of course, if he keeps on hogging up all the pretty girls, I’mma kill him myself,” and jogged off to rejoin the team.
“Good,” said Tony, and didn’t say another word until they got back to SHIELD, where he didn’t have to say a word because he was too busy getting yelled at by Headmaster Fury. He went to his room. Looked around. His stuff was everywhere, like it’d always been; parts on every surface. The only sign Steve had ever been there was the rope, still looped around the bedframe. Tony looked at it for a long time, then toed off his shoes and collapsed into bed, losing consciousness before he had a chance to feel anything.
“Sir yes sir,” said Barton, darting out of his chair (damnit—Steve had just gotten the corner of the desk where he wanted it) and out the classroom door. None of the other teachers would let Barton out of class, because Barton would never come back to their classes. He’d get found three hours later, climbing the stacks in the library or the ivy on the outside wall of the Academy or a cheerleader named Bobbi. But Coulson always sent him on errands, and Barton always came back to Coulson’s class.
Steve hissed out below his breath, wanting to die of embarrasment, but wanting this sensation—this drowning, overpowering, headswimming sensation of all-encompassing lust—more. His whole body felt like it was being funnelled through his cock, like he wanted to pour all of himself through the narrow keyhole Tony’d made with his fist, end up pooled and sated on the other side.
The security guard’s response was too low to decipher, but Steve caught the trashcan ricocheting across the hallway loud and clear.  The class sat riveted—through the door’s shattered half-window, Steve could see his teacher standing in the hallway, breathing deeply as he watched the security guard leave. Once the guard rounded the corner, he smoothed his tie and came back into the classroom, swiftly kneeling down by the black-haired boy, who was unsteadily trying and failing to sit up.
"You're just now realizing this?" she said, her voice rich with amusement. "Tony, I've watched you pine after him like a schoolgirl for years. I once pulled an entire, rooted hair from the middle of your scalp while you were looking at him, and you didn't even notice. What's changed?"
“Oo could ry,” said Barton around the gauze as Steve let himself out the infirmary door and into the hallway. There was music—muffled, faint music, but music—still coming from the ballet studio. Someone was dancing, this late at night? Steve wavered, weighing the possibility of running into Hill against the terrible awkwardness of going back into a room with a pissed-off Tony Stark. It didn’t take much weighing.
Clint’s eyes widened, yet another torrent of questions visibly building, when Mr. Coulson’s voice came from the front of the room: “No, I will not allow you to question my student, he is in class right now.”
, Tony pulled back and said, “So not that I wouldn’t like to fuck you right here in this fountain, but there actually is quite a lot of algae.”
“Nothing yet,” said Clint, working his way down the other side of the hall. “Ah, wait, we got a live one here.”
to be ordered around. And lucky for you,” Tony said, punctuating the thought with a kiss, “I am more than usually bossy.”
Natasha? As in, Romanov?” Tony mouthed a ‘wow’ at Steve. “I mean, what are the odds, we were just discussing her and her terrifying Commie athletic training. Couldn’t she just kick someone to death if they pissed her off?”
“Absolutely,” said Tony. “Remind me never to experience the real America ever again. Into the van, everyone!”
“OK,” said Steve. Carol gave him her phone, and he typed in his SHIELD Academy address. Even if they kicked him out after this, he didn’t think he could go home to Brooklyn. It just wasn’t the same.
“Only the ones which really piss me off,” Barton said cheerfully, and then Nurse Sitwell  came into the room, frowning at a chart. When he looked up, his face fell even further.
and Steve’s whole world would collapse. In science lab, he looked down at his notebook and saw only Tony’s eyes, warm and dark and inviting, looking up at him—Tony’s mouth, wrapped around his cock. In English class, he had to turn in a piece of short writing unfinished because he zoned so badly on the sense memory of Tony’s hands sliding up his thighs that he simply froze, staring off into space, until the kitchen timer dinged and Ms. Danvers made them all turn their papers in. Steve obeyed, but was haunted for the rest of the day by the nagging worry that he’d somehow written down some of the things Tony’d been whispering in his ear as he stroked him, things Steve had no idea people could even
Tony moved fast, undoing him, mouth moving a million miles a minute because of course it was. Steve didn’t hear a word of it. He yanked his wrists free of the ropes and he was gone.
By the time Steve came down, stars were starting to appear in the velvety blue, and conditions at the pool had taken a turn for the drunk. Nakia, straddling T’Challa’s shoulders and armed with a pool noodle, was trying to unseat Clint, who was straddling Thor’s shoulders and wielding a largish inflatable seahorse. Happy, stretched out on a picnic table and steaming like a beached whale, was babbling a drunken but completely line-accurate monologue from “Die Hard” while Pepper, armed with a pair of tweezers, picked broken glass out of his left foot and May held a flashlight and a bucket. Peter Parker was behind the bar—not because he was drinking, but because he was the only one still sober enough to mix drinks, and fast and coordinated enough to flip bottles behind his back. He had a polo shirt on, the collar flipped up and dabbed with wet spots from his still-soaked hair, and he was gnawing his lip fiercely as he worked. Hope Van Dyne was braiding Natasha’s hair, Stephen Strange was painting Okoye’s toenails, Scott Lang was pretending to only get cell service near Hope Van Dyne, Shuri was pretending to only get cell service next to the bar where Peter was working, and Tony was actually not getting cell service anywhere, which what the fuck, he
“Tomato, tomahto,” he said. “I don’t know about all of you, but I’ve had enough nature for one night. What say we all turn in, get some rack time?”
Bruce leaned over to look. “Tony, how did you manage to get a whole tree branch inside your eyelid?”
“A line if ever I heard one,” Tony said, but crawled in next to Steve, who arranged the covers over them both. “Did you used to use that with the boys in the Army?”
“Uh… huh.” said Steve, noticing that part of Barton’s eye and a lot of his knuckles also seemed to have come into conflict with the coffee table. “You get into it with coffee tables a lot?”
“Also there was a pretty sizeable detour slash navigational fuckup, did you know New Haven is mainly black?”
“OK then. I’ll mail you a postcard from Philly in a couple days. When you get it, if you feel like it, you can send me back a postcard explaining that you’re not dead and I can stop worrying. Capice?”
“That appeal really should not have worked as well as it does,” complained Bruce Banner, rising and reaching for his milk carton.
“I saw,” said Tony. “What a shitshow, huh? I’m really sorry Happy made such a sloppy mess of himself, I know how you were hoping for something different.”
“Good boy,” Tony said, lightly, almost casually, all the threat gone out of his voice as his gaze flitted up Steve’s arms to the spot where Steve’s traitorous hands—completely without his permission—had begun to wind themselves around the slats of the bed. “Eager, are we?”
Everyone in the back of the van looked at Thor until he hunched defensively. “It was for Loki’s own good. We sent him to a lesser country, it’s not as though we sent him into space.”
“You will shut up,” said Natasha to Scott imperiously. Then she pointed at Tony. “You will explain. Now, please.”
“Friday, belay my last and keep me in the loop about anything juicy, okay?” Tony was saying when Steve came up behind him. “
pawn shop?” said Barton. “Tell you what, you go in there and tell em you got both kidneys, see how many you walk out with.”
“You can if your ID says you’re eighteen,” said Clint, gently guiding the van back onto the road and beginning the climb of another steep Pennsylvania mountain.
“Da,” said Natasha, already stretching and wiggling her fingers in preparation. Thor knelt on the loading dock.
“I was asking if you could contribute your vote to the current polls,” said Mr. Coulson, and Steve went to the blackboard to add a hashmark under “Development of the Printing Press” in the poll for the Best Of The Middle Ages, and one under “The Spanish Inquisition” for the Worst, where the bubonic plague was the clear leader. At the end of class,  Mr. Coulson held Steve back with a subtle glance and gesture—as the last of the students shuffled out, Mr. Coulson sat on the edge of his desk. “Cadet Rogers, I hope you won’t mind my observation that you seemed a million miles away today. Is everything all right?”
“Everyone, we’re going to Norway after this,” Scott Lang hollered. “It sounds nice! I like IKEA. Loganberries are good.”
Tony’s eyes weren’t on his cock—they were on Steve’s, his gaze dark and intense. “Suck it,” he said, simply, and Steve opened his mouth and gave a soft, wet suckle, purling lushly over the soft pink head of Tony’s cock and ending with a protracted tonguing of the sensitive underside of the rim.
“Well, seems like you crazy kids could use a break,” said the mechanic. “Also I just ate a chimichanga and it is
Tony, looking utterly relaxed about his blowjob’s interruption, gave a tiny shrug from where he lay, one arm tucked behind his head. His other hand, draped loosely over his chest, lightly guarded his pacemaker’s scar—Steve guessed Tony wasn’t even aware he did that. “They never vacation, so. Is a vacation home a vacation home if you never use it? Anyway. It’s ours, and it’s private, so we could be naked all the time if we wanted.” His fingers fluttered, drummed on his chest, a tiny signal of some interior stress, coming out.
Steve, unnoticed by all, had slipped out the back of the van and was sprinting up the hill, zigzagging as he went to take cover behind every sign and low wall the sparse territory could offer.
“This tire has not been well maintained,” said Thor, straining against the next nut. “Truly, if we were in Norway—”
“I wanted to put you in the shower, get you a drink, make you sleep it off, but before I could even say anything, you stormed up to me and you kissed me. I was so surprised that I couldn’t kiss you back,” Tony says, ruefully. “And you pulled back, and you looked so hurt, like you thought I didn’t want you back, so
you’d finally admit to what the hell you’d been doing behind my back and apologise and tell me that it wasn’t just some cheap, sordid thing, that it had nothing to do with me, that I was still great, you know, the whole
Steve is wearing a brown leather jacket, a black shirt and jeans, and Tony could honestly jump him right there.
The two of them approach the altar through the dying flames, Steve slinging the submachine gun over his back. The long carrying poles are still in place.
Steve stares down at him, Tony’s pale, grey body, lying there in front of him, and he can feel it, even if he can’t see it, he knows that he’s gone; he knows that the spark that had made Tony’s eyes so bright has gone out, and there is nothing left in Tony’s body, nothing that makes him
Steve grins down at him, unashamed, and saunters out the door, calling out, “Tomorrow,” as he leaves.
look, when he was in the thrift of his life, when he was eighteen and he had a handsome face and intelligent and his body was tight and firm and muscled, the sort of body that made boys and girls alike stare, and he thought the world would belong to him, all on that alone, and people,
Tony laughs and then stands up, abruptly, settling himself in Steve’s lap. Despite his momentary discomfiture, Steve doesn’t hesitate to close his arms around Tony’s waist as if he’s afraid that without his intervention, Tony will slip down to the floor.
“It’s okay, Tony,” he murmurs, sorrow lining his face, even as he bears a smile for him, just for him, like now, faced with the harsh truth that Tony is dying, Steve wants to be strong for Tony, wants to give him comfort even in this moment where his world is ending. “We’ll be alright. You’ve done your job now; you saved us. You can rest.”
“You defend her so easily,” Tony says, softly, his smile turning hard and reckless. “I wonder if you’d defend me so easily as well, Steve.”
“Nice try, Rogers,” Tony cackles and makes his way into the kitchen so that he can fill up a vase and place the bouquet inside. “So, where are we going for dinner?”
James enters the lounge in a leather jacket and jeans, and then, Tony watches as Steve’s face pales in a rush.
He wonders if his father thought he had an easy life – knowing the man, knowing how perpetually disappointed he was with everything, with Tony, with his mother, with his life and everyone and everything around him,
“I know what you meant,” Tony says, fondly. “Now, come on, don’t stop,” he says, wiggling the lower half of his body towards Steve. “The dirty talk was just getting good.”
Tony frowns and peels it out, ignoring the way that it sticks to his fingers, and brushes off the dust.
“She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. So did I. That’s why they were here, because we didn’t want to sleep alone,” Tony says, defiantly, and rubs at his eyes.
Eshe nods at him, gives him a soft smile, thanks him for being brave enough to say all of this, and Tony quietens, an odd state for him, folds his hands in his lap like a good boy and feels like he’s been clawed raw on the inside.
the next time around. And before I even knew what was going on, our clothes were hitting the floor and you were leading me towards our bed, and then, we were having really great sex.”
The men start swearing in German, and then, Tony’s firing his gun, twice in succession, and the bullets are cleaving through the centre of their skulls, and they’re hitting the ground in sodden thuds.
), soothing that solid, hot ache that he’s been experiencing for the last couple of days, even while he was bleeding like a stuck pig, and Tony buries his face in Steve’s shoulder, as Steve starts to thrust, his hands tight on Tony’s hips.
Tony touches his fingertips to his eyes, and they come back wet, and he runs his tongue over the blunt underside of his teeth.
“-I went to sleep in the guest room. The next morning, I woke up and I wanted to get back to our room before the kids got up, so they wouldn’t realise what was going on or that I’d slept in another bedroom, but Maushmi, our daughter, she caught me on the way back, and she was upset. And then, she told Peter, who was also upset, and they followed me back to our bedroom, and she was really, uh, upset that her Daddy was alone that night, and she promised her Daddy that it wouldn’t happen again.”
“We can’t move her. She might… she might have a spinal injury or something,” he muses. “We should call the ambulance.”
to hate me. You have a husband and kids with the guy and I hate it, I hate it like I hate nothing else, but I’m fucking
“Won’t take that much,” Steve grunts, “with you being so fucking desperate for my cock, your tight fucking cunt, all sloppy like this.”
He cradles Tony’s in a single hand, his thumb dragging over his plump lower lip. His other hand lifts Tony’s legs to splay over his thighs, spreading them slightly, so that he can work his fingers between Tony’s legs, cupping his cock over the lace underwear.
Toni sends an uncertain look Peter’s way, who is standing by Rhodey’s hip, completely bemused and oblivious as to what’s going on.
“You’re sure about this?” he asks, in a low, rushed voice. “You’re sure? Because the way you sound, you sound like you’re afraid of this guy, of what he’ll do to you, and it’s making me think that he’s one of those possessive jackasses who might lock you up in an ivory tower to keep you from cheating on him.”
!” Tony snaps. “I’m the father of your children. I don’t know, I hate that you make me feel this way, Steve. I hate that you make me feel possessive and jealous like this, irrationally jealous on top of it, but I can’t help but feel like you shouldn’t be defending her, not when she’s… she’s the cause of so much of all the
“So, is that what we are now?” Steve asks, miserably, running his hand over his face, the one not covered in lube. “A sexless couple?”
“Steve,” Tony says, gently, firmly. “I know you don’t have any diseases, and I don’t have any diseases, and neither of us want a child right now, in this climate. We have a rubber, and I trust you, I do.”
“Didn’t feel too bad about James killing him after that,” Tony says, quietly. “And now that I have my own kids-”
“Marry me,” Steve insists. “If we get out of this alive, marry me, stay with me, live with me, love me, I don’t give a shit; I just want us to be together.”
on you, not on you. For fuck’s sake, he looks at you like you put the stars in the sky each night. He wouldn’t… it’s just, it’s not his style. He wouldn’t give it up, not everything that you have together, your beautiful children, for something cheap and tawdry.”
Tony lifts his head and sees into the black chamber ahead of him. Panic claws at his throat and fear opens like a pit in his stomach, before spreading up into his lungs.
“I’m not ready,” Tony murmurs. “Sometimes, despite my best efforts, I look at you, and I see your brother instead.”
“You got married at eighteen. A lot of people marry at eighteen,” Natasha says, quietly. “A lot of those marriages fail. I just didn’t want Steve to get hurt.”
who is uninterested, who fakes a headache or pretends to be asleep when Tony crawls into bed and puts a hand on his thigh, trying to slide it up.
He passes Maushmi into Steve’s arms, and she happily settles in his lap, burrowing under the sheets.
The night ended with Tony dragging Steve back to his apartment, now his alone since Rhodey was off at basic training, and fucking him until his toes were curling and his eyes were rolling at the back of his head. Only after the fourth or fifth time they’d fucked did Steve muster up the courage to tell him that he’d been a virgin until Tony had gotten his hands on him.
“How many times do I have to tell you?” Tony demands. “I don’t know anything, okay? And I’m not trying to protect Rogers or anything. I don’t have any loyalty to him at all. He’s brought me only trouble.”
“Nonsense,” Abraham breezes past, “you have already done a great deal. You should go and enjoy yourself, my boy.”
Peter and Maushmi are up in bed, their sheets tucked up to their chins, and looking equally miserable.
Steve smiles, the upturn of his mouth lazy and tired from the anaesthetic and good-old painkillers that are pumping through his system.
Steve almost feels angry in his movements as he drags down Tony’s sweatpants, forcibly, leaving him naked completely, and him fully dressed. Tony’s cock is straining upward toward his stomach, erect and leaking pre-come freely over his belly.
Tony nods. “Like I was some fancy, strapping businessman and not a really young genius college student who was almost at the legal drinking age and who ate too much chilli cheese fries and often threw vodka cranberries at stupid people.”
In this universe, this is where their happy ending begins, though, after a lot of shit, and it’s okay, because at least they made it to this point, where Tony can feel whole having both Steve and James to himself, sharing them in this bed, their bodies fitting together like the perfect puzzle pieces.
“What is it that you’re asking me, Steve?” Tony makes his question more like a demand. “Are you angry that I was out today when you were doing me such a great favour by picking up
Tony removes his clothes, one by one, until he’s standing in their shared cabin in just a loose shirt and his pants, his boots untied and sitting by the door.
Tony’s eyes roll towards the ceiling, and something deflates in his chest; his legs and arms turn to stone, and he stops thinking, stops listening.
“Well, then, I’m sure they’ll tell you what they’d like for you to call them,” she offers. She hesitates. “Would it bother you a lot if you couldn’t call them Daddy?”
“They killed him,” Tony says, quietly. “They killed him, and they covered it up because of what we said, what a bunch of five-year-olds told them. What if… what if we made it up?”
“You don’t seem to be mincing your words at all; so, what’s the point in asking you to stop?” Steve asks, with bone-deep weariness.
“Oh, come on, Tony, isn’t it time you dropped the whole fucking act?” Steve says, derisively. “I know he’s the Winter Soldier, and I know you’ve been helping him with his fucking terrorism, since fucking college apparently, and I know you’ve been sleeping with him this whole time, and I know… I know I was your cover, your convenient fucking alibi, the chance to play both sides. Did you know SHIELD had recruited me when we met in that bar the first time? Did you set up that scene with the idiot frat boy who kept making a move on you, or was it just a happy accident?”
. I don’t want to hear any more excuses,” Tony says, firmly. “If I have to cook tonight, I will kill us both. Ergo, we’re going out to dinner tonight. The kids are gone. There are no leftovers in the fridge. I can’t think of a more fitting occasion for us to go and have some fun that doesn’t involve Play-Doh.”
“-built like a line-backer?” Tony teases, finding humour somewhere inside what he feels is a cold, burnt-out body.
Steve’s fist comes down hard on the coffee table, making it rattle, making the liquid inside the decanter slosh and spill over the lip of the bottle.
Steve’s hand cradles his jaw, softly, leaning in close, barely brushing his mouth against his. “I’m sorry,” he whispers.
So, now, to be faced with the beautiful redhead, with a heavy bust and a gorgeous, searching smile and a well-toned body, much more toned than Tony, who might have slowly let himself go as the children started to get older and there always seemed to be peanut butter everywhere. A beautiful redhead that can steal Steve off at work, unattached and carrying no strings, is able to focus all of that steely attention on Steve and Steve alone, who could show Steve the life beyond bedtime stories and sandwiches with the crusts cut off and fuck him senseless to boot.
He thinks about those drawings that Miss Lewis showed him, the ones that showed that the kids weren’t as oblivious to what was going on as he thought they were.
he’ll forgive us one day. Wanda was much more understanding when she woke up. She was more concerned about the kids.”
but then, he remembers the fear, bright and sharp, reaching into his chest, slithering against his lungs and belly, when he’d rushed into Wanda’s house and found it devoid of children and he had no fucking idea where they’d gone, only that they were gone and he’d failed them; he remembers the sight of those HYDRA assholes waving the gun in the kids’ faces, the comforting weight of their bodies in his arms as he walked out of the warehouse, as they clutched at him like he could protect them.
He shakes his head and pulls back his side of the sheet, Steve’s side neat, as if he’d never slept in that bed in the first place. He pads out into the corridor, wearing just a pair of sweatpants and a dark shirt that has ARMY blazoned across the back, one of Steve’s that he’d stolen from the wash at some point (not that Steve had ever protested; so many times he’d fucked Tony stupid just on the sight of seeing him wearing Steve’s clothes).
“Because you pretty much just said that without saying it.” Tony stares at the wall, feeling a little weak. “You know this, but I guess that you’re forgetting about it because you’re fixating on what’s happening to you right now, but I’m not exactly some specimen of health over here, you know?” he says, bitterly. “In Afghanistan, when I was blown up and Yinsen had to, uh, to remove the shrapnel, Yinsen had to perform a sternotomy – that’s, uh, that’s when you crack open the chest.”
“I’ve actually completely deviated from my original train of thought,” she says, with a self-deprecating chuckle.
Steve doesn’t flinch this time. “Your name is James Buchanan Barnes. You grew up in Brooklyn. Your father’s name was George, and your mother’s name was Winifred. You have a sister, Rebecca. She’s married now, and she has kids. Two, a boy and a girl, a boy named James, for you. I go and visit them sometimes. They call me
“Honestly, Steve, looking back, I really wouldn’t have given a fuck if you’d just told me at breakfast one day,
Steve’s jaw clenches hard, because he’s thinking about all the fairs that he and Tony went to, how that’s no longer
“Fuck,” he hisses, shifting on the bed, trying to get a better angle, rocking back against his own fingers. “Fuck, Steve, please,
my heart. You fucked me, and then, you left, which tells me that you didn’t love me, that you cared about me, maybe, that you needed my help, sure, and maybe you had no compunction with sleeping with your hacker sidekick, but then, when shit got real, I wasn’t important enough for you to keep with you.”
Grant purses his lips, a split second of hatred entering his eyes, and Tony grinds his teeth, something sharp and anxious clamping around his body like a vice, as he is very much aware of him being in between two warring alphas.
you, Tony. I need you like I need nothing else in this world, and you need me too, don’t you? You can’t live without me, as much as I can’t live without you. I’m the only one who can make you feel this way, aren’t you? Your body sings only for me, doesn’t it? Say it, Tony, say it, say that you’re mine, that I’m the only who can do this to you, make you feel this way?”
He manages to climb over it, the Nazi right on his heels. Tony hides in an alleyway, grabbing a stray steel pot. Tony slips behind the Nazi and smashes him over the head with it, putting him onto the ground, unconscious.
Tony scrambles about in the dark, and his hand finds the wood shaft of a nearby shovel. He musters the strength to get up, and he smiles, tasting iron on his teeth, the blood from his split lip from when Obadiah had backhanded him.
Steve, while a success back in the United States, doesn’t find the admiration amongst the solders here at the front, all battle-hardened and more interested in the scantily clad omegas than Steve’s show.
“I woke up, and I heard voices,” Peter says, simply. He stretches out his hands for Tony to pick him up.
Steve’s mouth lands on Tony’s, swallowing up the moan that rises up in his chest and his throat, his hand curling around the back of Tony’s neck. He kisses him so firmly, so thoroughly like Steve is trying to tear into the seams that keeps Tony’s body together and stitch them together so that they’re one and whole.
Which means that Tony has to acknowledge the thing he most certainly doesn’t want to acknowledge, which is that this is no story of a simple affair, that there is nothing simple or fleeting with this, that this isn’t a passing fancy, that Tony is the constant here, because it’s very likely, Steve, being who he is, has fallen in love with Natasha, and Tony, once more, isn’t good enough for someone he loves.
On the fridge are two pieces of paper, almost identical in the drawings that are etched over them in crude colour pencil. There are five figures in each drawing, barely an inch away from each other. Three of them have the same dark hair and dark eyes and dark skin. The other two stand on either side of the kids, with the third, tall dark-skinned adult in the middle. One has long dark strands on either side of his round face, and the other has a mop of yellow hair atop his head. One child has short hair and two, thick scratches as pants, and the other child has a triangular dress and long hair flicked out in the ends.
Tony’s finger slides in with some resistance, and he guesses it’s because it’s been a while since James has had anything up here, but finally, he manages to get in two fingers down to the knuckle, his thumb finding his perineum and rubbing. He presses a soft, damp kiss to the small of James’ back, as he pushes in a third finger, scissoring to give him much room, and on the next thrust, he catches James’ prostate, which results in a full-body shudder from James right down to his toes, as he pushes his fingers back.
“I’m datin’ Toni, and she told me this interestin’ story about your relationship back when you were teenagers. She told me about how you liked to hit her, how you would get her drunk and then, beat the shit out of her and then lie about it the next day and make her thing that she was just clumsy. She told me how you made her feel like shit about herself, that she was worthless and stupid and that no one would ever love her but you. She told me that you
Tony reels back in offence. “Of course they do. Look, would you just… would you go back and look at her? Just see if she’s okay?”
She’d fallen asleep on the drive back, as had Peter, and so it’s easy enough for Tony and Steve to tuck both the children into the beds, run their hands over their hair as a way of reminding themselves that they’re still here, that they’re safe and alive and they can comfort themselves with the belief that even though today was traumatic for them, they’ll grow and heal from this.
Toni looks over her shoulder with a withering look. “Seriously, what is the point of having you as my maid of honour?”
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” Tony snaps, struggling against the man who holds his arms behind his back. The man in charge turns around, and in his hand is the poker that Tony had just abandoned, its end glowing molten. He advances on Tony, and fear slithers against his lungs, against his belly, as his entire body becomes dead-weight in fear.
“Those omegas, the ones that you dance with,” Tony begins, chewing on his lower lip, “God, I could see their ribs through their clothes. And I’m a little–”
“And I know about those phone calls okay,” Tony runs roughshod, the adrenaline pumping through his veins. “I know that she calls here constantly, and you always answer it, and you always leave the room so you can talk to her privately, and I know that your conversations with her are suspicious, that you talk about secrets that you can’t tell me, that you have to leave and go to her immediately. Is she one of those Fatal Attraction types, then? Did you fuck her at some conference or some retreat and now, she won’t leave you alone? Is she going to be boiling bunny rabbits on the fucking stove now? Is she going to try and kill me? Should I be watching out for that?”
“I’m sorry. I fucked up,” Steve’s voice is thick, pained, “back in Siberia, I fucked up.” He shakes his head and fists his hands in his hair. “No, no, that’s wrong. That’s wrong. I fucked up long before that. I fucked up two years before that when I found out that HYDRA had your parents killed. I should have told you immediately. I didn’t… I didn’t know
Toni purses her lips thin. “He was… he was larger than life,” she murmurs. “He was bright and strong and he liked to talk, and he was very, very charming, very persuasive; he could make you do anything. He used to smile a lot. He didn’t have a lot of friends, because he didn’t trust a lot of people, but I was his friend. We were friends since we were very, very little, even younger than you are right now.”
“I can’t let you go on your own. I can’t sit here, sick with worry over what might be having. I can’t…” Tony looks over, drags his hand over his face. “I can’t sit here, I can’t wait. I can’t think of the thousand possibilities that might be happening, wondering if they’re going to come home, if
Peter wrings his hands together in an anxious gesture that reminds Toni of being his age. “What if, what if you have a baby with Steve and Bucky?”
“I’m sure,” Tony says, faux sympathetically, tracing an absent pattern across Steve’s chest. “But I hope you feel that you sufficiently proved your point. Seriously, A+. Even I couldn’t have done it better myself. Hell, I
Tony gnaws on his lower lip. “Yes, I am,” he replies, without betraying the fear he had felt when they’d hoisted Tony up into their arms and stripped him naked.
“Fair enough,” Natasha says, quietly. “You’re right, though. I was trying to make it seem like we were… like Steve and I were-”
“Yeah, you’re supposed to, because I’ve never given you a reason to not fucking trust me,” Tony reminds him, grinding his teeth together.
“Just like you said you’d be back last time?” Tony says, deliberately phrasing his words like a blow. “That was your word too.”
“Yeah, let’s get hitched. I mean, I’m pushing fifty. I might as well get settled down sooner or later,” Tony teases.
Steve’s lips spread out and upwards in a grin, showing his teeth. “You’re gonna let me choose, baby?” he croons.
Wanda purses her lips thin. “You do realise how stupid that sounds, right? That it’s a very bad excuse?”
An omega’s nakedness is nothing to be ashamed of before other omegas, and Tony steps into the bath, the hot water immediately scalding his skin. He sinks in with a sigh, resting his head over the edge.
He decides to use it as leverage, memorising the image of his sire whispering sweet nothings to one of the omegas who giggles, her hand curling in his sire’s suit, forming for herself all kinds of dreams where Howard Stark breaks his bond with his brown omega to bond with
,” Steve insists. “And to be fair, Tony, you never came out and told me that you had a problem with how often or how much we were having sex. You could’ve said that to me, you know? You could’ve forced me to listen, told me how you were feeling, and that you felt like I wasn’t paying enough attention to you, that you wanted to have more sex. You could’ve said
“No less brave than what you’re going to do tomorrow,” Tony points out, gently. “And no less than what I’ve seen you do already. You don’t back down. You don’t run away. That’s admirable.”
He makes his way out of the workstation, up into the proper levels of the house and to the front door, throwing it open.
Steve’s face cracks wide open, and he starts crying unashamedly, soft, slow tears that rack his body.
Nazis are running around, yelling for water. A burning crate at the side of the settlement is pushed over, only to knock over a drum of heavy black oil. It makes contact with the wall of fire that is already there, and it turns into a river that shoots across the cement.
Steve’s expression warps into something savage and covetous. “Yeah, you do,” he growls, leaning up at the waist to brush his mouth over Tony’s. “Come on, baby, you know what to do,” he cajoles.
Tony shrugs. “I guess… I guess it bothered me that she was so focused on making Steve feel better that… well…”
Steve laughs and presses a smacking kiss to her cheek. “That’s just as much for you as it is for me.”
Sam lifts his eyes, fierce and cold. “I want to know what happened,” he says, firmly. “What the fuck have you and Steve been doing that it ended up like this? Who were those guys? What did they want? Where are they now? Why the
“You’re not causing any problems, James,” Tony sighs. “It’s two in the afternoon. The kids won’t be done with school for at least another hour, and Steve… well, Steve, he left at like six this morning, which probably means that he won’t be back until midnight. Although, he’s been on this kick where he tries very hard to prove that he’s actually a good husband, so it might be like around seven today, if he tries very hard, that is.”
“He’s not after us because we lied,” he moans, his voice sound like gravel. “He’s after us because we
“Tony, just… just listen to me, okay,” James says, softly. “Sit down with me, and I’ll explain everything.”
