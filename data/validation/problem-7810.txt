Tony just nodded, though he didn’t really think that anyone needed to ‘make up for’ anything. It was a misunderstanding, that was all. None of his teammates were
once more, just in case something went wrong?
“Hey Steve,” Clint said quietly as he walked into the room, gesturing for someone to follow. Steve just raised an eyebrow at him, confused. Clint looked like he was trying to encourage a scared child into a room.

in him, one that Steve had always admired so much. Those brilliant eyes of his reflected the stars, and Steve found himself getting lost in their profound amber depths.
"I almost feel bad for the guy who made all of the tech," Steve said, drawing a little
night, but a late night—and he was tired and hadn't had enough coffee yet and was just ready to go back to bed. It was hard to relax and enjoy the morning when Bruce was
“Actually, I’m worried that
Steve pressed a gentle kiss to the back of Tony's head, and the genius grinned as he leaned back and relaxed. "But if they didn't want me around, they'd say so. I know they would. Everyone can be pretty blunt on this team—if Clint didn't want to do drunk science with me, he wouldn't. If Bruce didn't want to work with me, he wouldn't. If Natasha didn't like me, she wouldn't be so damn protective of me all the time. Bucky wouldn't be spending time in the lab with me, learning about modern tech, if he couldn't put up with me. And the team wouldn't be so worried about making sure I get medical care after battles if they didn't care."
, in your words—about your crush on Steve.”
more than him, seeing as he actually had to be at least a little tiny bit sober so that he could work.
"You know I love you," Clint laughed. "And anyway, you can’t deny that you're adorable."
"Yeah," Tony mumbled, glancing away. Maybe he shouldn't try to act like a pain in the ass—maybe Steve
," Steve muttered, because he knew he couldn't deny that. Sure, the serum was supposed to make his body as close to the peak of human perfect as it could, and it did a wonderful job at that. "But... I'm just some kid from Brooklyn. I'm not all that smart, I've been struggling enough with the new century, and the both of you have always been there for me, but... I was a nobody until I was Captain America—and it wasn't like I
"I am," Iron Man said, putting his hands on his hips. "The vast majority of the world would say you're just about as physically perfect as a human being could get."
"Well," Tony said as they turned the corner. "I should head back to the lab, continue the search—"
Tony stared at him for a little while, looking like he was trying to gather his thoughts. He opened and closed his mouth a few times, trying to figure out what he was going to say before he eventually decided on, "I know."
“I love
"You know... he'd probably say that he's surprised you're willing to give
"I've been worried that one day you'd break up with me because it was really Iron Man that you liked," Tony mumbled, then laughed a little to himself.
The words that were coming out of his mouth were just recited whispers, nothing that Steve could say with any more certainty than
"Okay, so I thought you were kidding at least a little bit," Tony gasped, sweaty and exhausted as his boyfriend dragged him to his feet. Again. He couldn't keep track of the number of times he'd been knocked to the ground. "I can't keep up with a super-soldier, Steve, I really can't."
"We don't need them conscious," Tony growled as he gripped one of the agents by his neck. "If you want to live, you'll tell me where Barnes is
“I need to see him,” Steve mumbled.
"All taken down," Clint reported.
"Somehow you always manage to step in and save the day," Tony said, grinning when Steve just rolled his eyes and smiled at him.
They spoke with the softness of a breath, the slightness of an echo.
But the time they’d made it to the edge of the forest, Steve was a bit delirious. He’d lost a lot of blood, and he swore that he was starting to hallucinate. He hadn’t actually managed to tell his team where he was, but… but that looked like Bucky and Clint and Natasha who were running over to him.
Tony dropped down onto his knees when they were gone, taking a couple deep breaths. Whenever he used magic, it completely wore him out. He barely had enough energy to still be sitting up. The sound of Clint's laughter was what made Tony turn around. Three of the bird creatures had managed to get loose and were already flying off into the sky, but one of them was sitting on the ground, head thrown back in laughter.
Tony sighed.
did. But Bucky knew Steve like most others didn’t, he knew things about Steve that even Tony didn’t know.

“Steve,

"I'd still get in trouble for what I do when I'm drunk," the guy pointed out, and Tony was barely able to hold his boyfriend back from punching the guy.
"Lucky for the team, then, 'cause it only made us old," Tony said, trying not to think of the alternative. "We're not dead, just old."
"I need a copilot," Clint called. Good, he'd managed to secure the controls, they could get the plane out of danger and save the crew.
that you're married doesn't get them to stop."
“But it’s not mine,” Steve whispered, and the whole world went to hell.
When Bruce had insisted that the two of them get medical evaluations, Tony had fled to the lab. Nope, he was not putting himself through S.H.I.E.L.D. medical, and there was nothing that they were able to do about it. They couldn't force him to stay, especially at that time since he'd still had the suit on.
to be held back by what Howard did when I was younger..." Tony said, and then seemed to realize what he just said.
It took Steve kissing him for him to stop talking. "I'm not going to tell you not to go to the lab, Tony. You don't have to worry about that. I was just going to suggest that I go down with you, when you're ready."
He couldn’t see, he couldn’t feel, he couldn’t taste or smell or
“No!”
"What do you mean by that?" Steve asked, looking around. "Tony, I thought you said Bruce and Natasha were here, too."
The bright golden light that had caused all of the problems in the first place filled the room again, and for a second Tony wanted to run into Steve's arms, to hold his husband tight just in case this was the last time that he'd get a chance to touch him, to hold him. Why hadn't he kissed him before Bruce turned the ray on? Why hadn't he said
"You don't lie," Tony whispered, a dopey grin crossing his face as he closed his eyes. "...be scary if America's Golden Boy started lyin'..."
"I can see that," Tony commented. "Your arm, what's wrong with it?"
"I don't know you," Tony said. "I like your suit, though."
. It was strange. The team had always called them 'Mom and Dad' (though Steve was still unsure which one he was supposed to be) and now he was actually
“I know that Bruce doesn’t think you can hear a word I say, but that doesn’t mean that I’m not going to continue to try and see if you can… can maybe hear me,” Tony said. This time, instead of taking up residence in the chair that was far away from the bed, Tony had dragged it over so that he could hold Steve’s hand again.
The wires were ripped right out of the machine that was currently attached to Steve’s head, disconnecting him from the simulation in the only way that Tony
“That’s… what I said, didn’t I?” Steve asked, confused. Howard had been helping him out back in the war, and while they weren’t exactly
" Tony gasped. Steve could see that his hands were shaking, and there was no doubt Bruce noticed that too. He hated seeing that panicked look on Tony's face—he should
he could do. And now? Now he couldn’t even do that right.
“I know that the life that man gave you is wonderful and happy and everything you ever wanted, back in the war,” Bucky continued, sighing. “But you’ve got to remember what you said about this life. You’ve never been happier—I’ve seen it. When you were chasing after Peggy, you just had a crush on her. What you’ve got here with Tony… Steve, I’ve never seen you in love until I saw you with Tony.”
Bucky just rolled his eyes. "I'm not adorable, I'm a deadly assassin."
There was a snarling noise as a huge metal box was dragged out by horses to the crowd, dropping the box in the middle of the circle. Steve tried pushing past some people, but everyone wanted to be in the front—they all wanted to see this.
"Hey, calm down," Tony shouted, flying over in front of the townsfolk. They turned their attention to him but quickly found out that their guns weren't able to damage his suit. "We're the good guys here—we're just trying to stop Hydra!"
“I didn’t realize it was April today,” Tony mumbled, and Steve pressed a kiss to his head.
Raising a hand to his head, Tony groaned again and opened his eyes, coming face to face with an unfamiliar man in an unfamiliar costume. Tony shouted in surprise and scooted back as far as he could, looking around. Where was he? This wasn't his tower, this wasn't his team.
"It still feels strange to hear that," Tony whispered. "It's been months, and it still feels weird to hear that."
Tony was a little surprised when Bucky put a hand on his shoulder. He had such a regretful look on his face. "I know I already apologized for the way I acted earlier," Bucky said sincerely, "but I really am sorry. I wasn't trying to make you feel like you weren't capable anymore, I just... I wanted to look out for you two—it wasn't going to be easy for either of you, and if I could make things a little easier... I'm sorry."
And now that he was absolutely positive that Tony was Iron Man... As happy as he was to know who was at his side during every battle, the thought of losing his boyfriend and co-captain was something that he had to for himself
"You've... got what?" Tony asked, though judging by the way that Steve's face light up, it was important. Damn, was he starting to forget things in his old age?
Tony just nodded. Less stress and worry wasn't going to happen until he was back to normal, but it was a good thought.
"I'm guessing that it's going to be a 'no' on the whole trans-dimensional threesome thing, then?" Stark asked, and Tony couldn't help but chuckle a little.
Natasha didn't comment on that, instead choosing to just wander closer and make sure that they were doing just as Tony had said. Apparently seeing that none of the tools were in use or anywhere near either of them, she seemed to get the message.
“We’ll be prepared,” Tony promised, looking his lover right in the eye. “I love you, Steve. We’ll make it through this, we’ll make it through an invasion, and we’ll make it through everything. Don’t worry.”
“They’ve gotta be using silver bullets—don’t get hit,” Steve said, wishing that he had his bike so he could just get Tony home. A motorcycle couldn’t be able to drive through a forest though…
, Steve!”
“Tony, we’re not…” not-Bruce stopped. “You’re not going to believe that. You have no reason to believe that. How can I prove it to you…?”
There was a moment of surprise on Clint's face before the shield-generator that Tony made kicked in, stopping his punch long before it got close to Clint. He moved back, raising his hands before he shot a couple repulsor blasts, all deflected by the shield.
And yet here he was, spare Iron Man gauntlet he’d stolen snugly fit on his left hand, gripping the briefcase with all of the stones. Vormir. It wasn’t a pretty sight, that was for sure.
“She said that his name is Peter, and he’s only four years old,” Tony continued, sighing. “I shouldn’t have asked, because he’s not going to be coming here, but… I thought maybe…”
He nodded, and he had to keep his eyes on the man in front of him because when he closed his eyes he could still see that gravestone…
you're worried about, Tony, you
Ah, Bucky. Tony couldn't decide who got it worse—Bucky or Bruce. They were on opposite sides of the spectrum, and Tony was just glad that he wasn't stuck as an ogre, or as... a faerie. Obviously, he was very angry about it, which Tony could understand he knew that Bucky just wanted to find Clint as soon as possible so that they could get

“It’ll be okay,” Steve said, trying to keep his voice from sounding as shaky and broken as he felt. This was the real world, that other world had been a simulation. “Tony… I need you to know how much I love you, how I would’ve been awake sooner if they wouldn’t have taken you out of my life. You’re
They'd been doing this a lot—getting drunk together, that is, and working in the lab. Now, neither was ignorant to the fact that it wasn't safe, but it was just too much fun to get drunk and create something epic that they wouldn't even remember in the morning, so that when they
sorry they did this,” the man whispered, and Tony flinched away when he tried to press a kiss to his forehead. No way was he letting an
"Don't worry, we'll be there," Steve said with that completely fake sweetness. There was no way that Natasha didn't see it. For a second Tony wondered if Steve was just as tired of their teammates keeping an eye on them as he was. Probably—it was like when the team had first formed and everyone was trying to make sure that he was adjusting. Tony had learned pretty quickly that Steve was adjusting just fine and he hated people treating him like he must've been struggling. He was the only one that Steve was bluntly honest with, the only one he'd share whatever he was feeling with.
"It's broken," Tony tried explaining, though he was honestly at a loss for words. He didn't

"Steve," Bucky gasped, clinging to the super-soldier after he'd ripped off the chains. "You're alive! God, you're alive. I knew you were... b-but they kept telling me you weren't—you took a plane down, you were found dead, t-they just..."
"Tony Stark is an arrogant, annoying, good-for-nothing, alcoholic, narcissistic, egotistical playboy who's created hundreds of thousands of weapons that have killed even more people," Tony growled, pressing his face against Rogers' chest. "No one would've ever looked up to Iron Man if they knew how broken he was... So I told everyone that Iron Man was my bodyguard."
"It's such a beautiful night out," Tony said, stopping him in his tracks. He had this
"Don't get your panties in a twist," Tony said, flying off to cause a distraction. And oh boy did he ever!
," Tony chuckled, a little surprised by how angry Steve was. Maybe he could calm him down a little... "I'm guessing that your death-glare had something to do with it, right?"
“I know, Tony told me,” he said with a grin, though he looked happy to be hearing it from more than just one person. “Tasha and Bucky are over at the ship waiting for us to get back. We’ve got to go—I, uh, had to take down a couple of those aliens while I was waiting, so they’ve got to be pretty pissed by now.”
Tony, still looking shocked, raised his hands and put the helmet back on his head. Only a couple moments later, the rest of the team wandered out of the elevator. Bruce glanced over at them for a moment before dragging Steve over to the couch.
The doctor fell silent, not wanting to even suggest the possibility of losing their Captain. Natasha seemed to understand what he was saying as she wandered over to Tony, sticking close by his side. If anything happened, he was going to need her there.
"I didn't want to interrupt," Tony said, though it sounded kinda stupid when he said it now. "You two... you're just so perfect together."
The voice that greeted him was ghastly, but familiar. “Captain America. Here I thought that the last time I would have to see you was back in the twentieth century.”
—werewolf or not—that would be fine.
"I'm pretty sure the Other Guy would make sure nothing bad happened," Bruce said with a shrug. “And I'm careful, so nothing's going to happen. You don't have to worry about me."
He prayed for an answer, but he knew that he wouldn’t get one.
“Tomorrow,” Tony agreed as Steve kissed his head and held him closer. “We’ll build our own family, Steve.”
Mmm, Steve. His eyes wandered up and down his boyfriend's body, watching him move around the kitchen. While he loved Steve for who he was—the man had a heart of gold, and Tony loved him as much as he admired him—the muscles were definitely a nice addition. He'd stick by Steve's side and love him even if he lost all those beautiful muscles, even if he was horribly disfigured, even if he didn't look like Steve anymore. But the muscles were definitely a nice bonus.
“Maybe it would be better to wait until morning…” he mumbled, looking over at the trees. It was so dark out in the forest already, and the chances of actually finding Tony in the darkness… “Are there hotels here?”
“I can do that,” Tony said, giving in. It wasn’t like he had any other choice. As Bruce left the room, Tony turned his attention back to the blond super-soldier in the bed. There was just one thing that Tony wanted at the moment—for Steve to open his eyes. If he opened his eyes, maybe then he’d finally just
Tony couldn't hide his smile. They hadn't been out in a while, and it might be fun. After all, if Steve was going to leave him, he might as well get a few more good days in. "Okay."
“Peggy, I was thinking about maybe making a blueberry pie for dessert tonight,” Steve said when they finally got some peace—Mary was helping Susan learn how to draw better, and Michael was playing with some of his toy cars.
“You said Tony, not Howard. Is he someone that you met in the past few days, one of the men who’s trying to send you back out to the war?” Peggy asking, snuggling back up against his side again.
"It does make working together out on the battlefield a bit more fun," Stark murmured, and Rogers actually smirked at that. On the battlefield? That meant...
. It's just a little flesh wound, I told you—I'm

"We'll get him back," Steve murmured, gripping the shoulder of the Iron Man suit. He leaned over to give Tony a quick kiss while his faceplate was still up. "He's going to be fine."
getting new trick arrows—whatever crazy ideas he could come up with—for that.
The rocks and bushes were big enough to hide Tony, but Bucky chose to weave between the branches of the bushes to get a better look at what was going on. Tony couldn't help but stare, too.
…but if the team thought marrying him was a joke, then maybe Steve would see that eventually, too? Tony would rather he see it and break the engagement off
Iron Man descended through the air pretty quickly, placing him down into the grass. He coughed and took a couple deep breaths, rolling over so that he could face Iron Man. His eyes roamed across the familiar suit, a frown forming on his face. This wasn't Iron Man's armor—it was
“Thank you, but if he might be in the forest—I need to go find him,” Steve said, watching as fear flashed across the woman’s face.

He wasn’t here for a ritual, though. He was here for the witch—and if she wasn’t there, then he had no reason to stay. Sighing, Steve shook his head. “Thank you, Ma’am, but I really need to find her. She… she hurt someone close to me, and I need her to fix it.”
“He’s safe,” Bruce assured him. He put a hand on Steve’s shoulder and gave him a serious look. “Stay in bed—you lost a lot of blood, and the silver in that bullet wasn’t the cleanest, so there was an infection. The serum cleared out most of it while you were asleep, but you

Without having a chance to say anything before Tony ran off, Steve decided to just listen and bring his injured friend over to the medical room.
"He's been anxious a lot, and really worried about you," Tony muttered, putting the finishing touches on Bucky's arm before he patted his shoulder and stepped back. "You've been making
, Tony,” Steve whispered, though there were tears in his eyes. “That was… They’ll always be in my heart, but they weren’t real. I know that, I understand that, and it’s probably not going to hit me for a while, but… I really do want to start a family with you.”
"He's so adorable when he's gone all "mad scientist" on us," Tony chuckled as he wandered back over and took ahold of his husband's hand. It wasn't as soft as it had been for the past several days, but it was still
The leader of them walked up to Tony, jumping off his horse. "You gonna make us?"
He'd barely gotten a chance to see Natasha running back over into the room, leaving Clint to fly the plane solo, before he'd been blasted out of the plane.
"I'm glad," Steve said, carrying off towards their bedroom. "I know that it hasn't been easy... especially after all those days of searching... I really owe you, Tony. You've done so much more for me than anyone else... You gave me a home, you gave me a
"Steve Rogers, I presume?" the man in the suit asked, and he nodded slowly. "I thought that looked like a portal. Sit tight, we need to just stop these DoomBots, then you're coming back to the mansion with us. Man, it seems like the multiverse is getting split every other week by now."
that you two put in papers to be able to adopt kids. Steve doesn’t care about blood—kids don’t need to be biologically his, he’ll love them regardless. You two were going to have your own family, with as much love and support as we could give you.”
It was the first time either of them had just casually mentioned the fact that they were old to the team, and while everyone seemed instantly uncomfortable for a few seconds, it melted away as Steve wrapped an arm around Tony's waist and started leading him over to their room.
He raced back into the burning building, wanting to make sure that there wasn't anyone left as Steve was helping an elderly couple out of the building after some inconsiderate asshole had knocked the poor people to the ground. While he let Steve deal with that, the hero inside Tony couldn't let him

date,” the blond shapeshifter said quietly as he placed Tony down so that he could let him stand on his own two feet, “…we went to this little cupcake store because you liked the muffins that they baked, not the cupcakes. The first date we went on, though, was back before I realized that we were dating… It was when you took me around the park and got me to try out the local food, since I hadn’t been there yet. You insisted that I try the hot dogs.”
Wait—the ‘mindless beasts’ were drawn to the forest? So there was a chance that Tony might be out in the forest? He knew what his teammate looked like, he wouldn’t mistake him for any other werewolves that might be running around in that forest. If he could get him back to the tower… then maybe they could help him.
Clint and Bucky though? They both looked surprised, and it looked like any conversation that they might've been having had died on their tongues. Tony just frowned at them and took his seat at the table.
"What are you talking about?" Stark asked. He was staring at Tony like he'd gone crazy.
"I've seen you wear Steve's clothes before," Bucky said, shrugging. "Seeing Stevie's shirt on you just reminds me of how short you are."
come to me—got it? I don't want this to be more difficult than it has to be," Bruce said, glancing back and forth between Steve and Tony, "for

and to live as they wanted to, not to continue fighting because they had to.
"I wasn't talking about you," Natasha replied.
"We do," Rogers said. "There's no one I'd rather have at my side when we go off into battle. I trust him, I love him, and I'm able to protect him when he's with me. If I had to think about him being back in the tower... There are all sorts of villains that try to attack the tower, and if I thought he was

He was also searching for something, Steve could tell, but he refused to say
Stark leaned forward so that Tony was able to see his double's face. "And you?"
“Making a mistake? What, by letting you have the darker suit?” Clint joked. “Or by letting you walk down the aisle first? Tony, he’s not making a mistake.”
“It’ll just be a few minutes,” Tony promised before disappearing.
Bruce and Natasha had been with them too, for a while. But then, of course, they found exactly
The dimension portal.
The team had formed a while ago, and while it hadn't been an easy transition, working solo to working with a team of superheroes, it was something that he was thankful for. Clint liked working with S.H.I.E.L.D., yes, and would continue doing so, but the fact that he had friends that he could rely on, people who cared about him, ones that he could talk to and spend time with... he couldn't have been more thankful.
He shuffled a little closer, and Steve wrapped an arm around his waist. Days ago, he wrapped an arm around Tony and glared at other people who tried flirting with him to make sure that everyone knew that Tony was
His head hurt again. He wasn’t entirely sure why he was getting such bad headaches, but it had been happening more and more frequently in the past couple… couple… days? Weeks? He wasn’t sure. He couldn’t be sure exactly how long he’d been having these horrid headaches, but they were starting to make him see things.
“Being around soldiers will make you think that sometimes,” Peggy said, giving him a quick kiss before going back to the other couch to continue reading to her children.

"I believe you. He's your best friend, and I'm not going to leave him out on the streets if I can offer him a place to stay," Tony murmured, and Steve hugged him tighter. Tony chuckled, "That arm of his is really bothering me... I hate broken technology. I just want to fix it right now."
"Have you been drinking coffee?" Tony couldn't help but ask as the whole team followed after them. There was a mutual excitement coming from everyone, and Tony couldn't deny that he was ready to be young again. "Because you've never acted like this when drinking tea."
Steve rolled his eyes, though he couldn't help but picture that version of the man he loved in his head. He froze, looking up from the picture that he was drawing, when Stark grabbed his arm. "Hmm?"
It felt so nice to have Steve curl around him. He was already pretty exhausted, so it was easy to just snuggle up against him and listen to his heartbeat.
Tony had
That was two days ago.
"No one thought I was anything more than a broken man after... after Afghanistan," Tony sighed, hanging his head. "Your team... trusts you?"
"Okay, okay," Bruce said, gesturing around the lab, pointing at a couple of places that had been armed out on the ground. "Steve, you need to stand right there—feet on the marks, don't move from those places. Just stand... normally, don't turn around. Right there." Bruce then grabbed Tony's wrist, leading him over to the other places that were marked out on the ground. "Right here, Tony. Don't move from that spot. This shouldn't hurt, it shouldn't really feel like anything, so that shouldn't make you guys move, but... there will be a bright flash of light, so just... stay still."
“You’ll be happy to know that Stark never gave up on you, choosing to stay alone and wait for you to wake up. I’m almost sorry you missed his funeral.”

"He's going to need a transfusion," Bruce said once the bullets were out. Bucky was laying on the bed, still holding Steve's hand, but looking very out of it.
"I don't want to lose you," Tony said before he could hold the words back. Somehow, Steve always made him feel so safe, even when he felt so vulnerable. Those strong arms of his would just stay wrapped around him, and he'd hold him, protect him, keep him safe.

from the beginning that it was impossible not to fall in love with him.
“I’m not planning on it,” Tony said, struggling to get out of Steve’s arms. “Put me down.”
"I know... you always have been," Tony whispered, pressing a kiss to Steve's cheek before he tried dragging the super-soldier back down into bed. Rolling his eyes, he just settled down again, keeping Tony held so closely that he could feel the cold circle of metal from his arc reactor press against him through the soft fabric of their shirts.
But that would require dragging the suit around again, and he wasn't sure if his body would be able to handle that. He
Fighting alongside Tony was a dream—keeping him safe, trusting him with his life, it was all just too perfect. And just like any dream, it had to end eventually. Steve fought harder, trying to force the thought from his mind. He'd do anything to keep his team, his family, safe. And if that meant he'd end up dead in place of them, then he'd

“I was going to skip it and drag you off to bed again sometime today,” Tony mumbled. Yes, he liked training with the team, but he was tired and really didn’t feel like being around the team anymore today. Or maybe for the rest of the week… maybe longer.

Oh God,
"She's right, you know," Steve pointed out, leaning over to kiss Tony. When he was in his suit, he was actually just a tad bit
"Apparently not," Tony muttered, offering a hand. Clint looked exhausted by now—they'd been fighting Hydra for quite a while, seeing how many agents they'd brought along, and once the villagers started firing they were forced to retreat. For the time being, at least.
Tony,
"Tony," he whispered, gently shaking his boyfriend, trying to wake him up. "Come on, darling, it's time to wake up. Come on, Tony—"
“You believe me,” he whispered, a smile crossing his face. “You actually believe me this time!”
He really shouldn't have been surprised to see Steve standing there. The super-soldier looked surprised to see Clint there instead of Tony, but what shocked him more, probably, was just how drunk Clint knew he looked.
. He's strong," Steve said. He sounded like he really believed what he was saying, so Tony would believe him too. Bucky would be absolutely fine. They'd get him back to the tower, they'd patch him up if he needed medical attention, and then they'd drag him off to their bed and make sure that he didn't leave it for the next week.
"It was never really a
before something came between them, something that he couldn’t fix no matter how hard he tried.
God, he should’ve known that they weren't after Steve. Of course they were after him! Who wouldn't want to kidnap the guy who funded the Avengers? Obviously he's got a bunch of money, and someone might want to pay to get him back... though perhaps not, perhaps the Avengers would be better without him. They'd be in control of all of the money, and they wouldn’t have Iron Man getting in the way and disobeying orders...
The being felt orange, as if it had touched his soul instead of his body, as if he was seeing it without eyes.
Steve shook his head. "I was glad. Howard just cared about money, but Tony's so much more than that. He's so kind. I can tell how much he cares about the team, even when he tries to deny it or make jokes about it. I don't know how to explain it... I'm still shocked that he said yes to that first date. I mean, look at me."
“You never hurt anyone,” Steve reminded him calmly, wishing that he could just drag Tony onto the bed and hug him. Tony glanced over at him like he knew what he was thinking. “I think everyone was a bit surprised at first, but you
"I can second that," Natasha said, and Tony looked over at her. She was dragging an annoyed-looking Bruce into the room—chances were, he wanted to continue working on the cure. He had that same look that Tony knew he got when Steve dragged him out of the lab.
"I love you," Steve reminded him, and Tony chuckled.
"I think we're all ready for a vacation," Tony said, yawning.
"Tony, the Hulk and I aren't separate beings... He's known from the first time I met you as Iron Man," Bruce said calmly, offering a friendly smile. "I just figured that you didn't want anyone to know, so I didn't say anything... I'm glad you're ready to tell everyone." Bruce raised an eyebrow at him. "What's wrong? You look sick."
"Whoa, calm down," Stark said, holding up his hands. "You've got me and Banner on your team, it won't be long before they find out how to start up the portal again. Give them some time. I don't know if we'll be able to send you back to your universe or not if we try, so we might as well wait to see if they're able to come for you or not. You're an alternate-Cap, you're always welcome here, even if your team is a bit weird."
. “I’m so sorry… but I’m not ready to give up if you aren’t.”
“Where’s my team?” Steve demanded.

"Disappointed?" Iron Man asked.
"But I thought you said..." Iron Man mumbled. Without the robotic overtone... he recognized that voice. It was so similar to... Steve turned around quickly. Nothing could prepare him to see the face that stared back at him. It was so familiar, yet still different enough not to let him panic. If brown eyes had been staring back at him, he wouldn't have been able to handle it. But seeing that this Tony Stark had blue eyes... it made it a little easier.
Tony nodded and hurried over to Steve, taking his hand. “Time to go home, okay?”
“Of course I do,” Steve said, closing the door before he let his children lead him over to the kitchen. God, he loved them with all of his heart and was so thrilled to have them in his life. For a while he’d thought that they’d never settle down and have a family, but now? Now not only did he have a
Iron Man shook his head. "I can keep an eye out for them, though. If they're good enough, we could make them Avengers here, too."
When Steve woke up, all he could think about was Tony. He could hear Bruce and Bucky both trying to get him to calm down—the IV, don’t pull it out—this isn’t good for you—calm
“You do? Good. ‘Cause Stevie’s not choosing to stay in that world because he loves Peggy, he’s stuck in that world because they made it so that he didn’t know you existed anymore,” Bucky said. “If he knew you existed… he’d be back in this world before you knew it.”
The man with the sword took something from another guy—it looked like some sort of herbal mixture—before he threw it at the werewolf. When he did that, Steve tried shoving past some more people, but no one wanted to move.
"Of course," Steve said, looking taken aback a little. "I love you, Tony, I'd always try my best to protect you."
It was worse than last time when Steve’s expression had just changed, and there had been some glitching on the screen. This time? This time Steve looked like he was in pain, and his hands were shaking.
. Everything that’s going on is real for you, and that’s what matters here.
There was a sound of a projector starting up before an image appeared before Steve.

"Always," Clint said, and by that point in time Tony was practically
"They were trying to catch Clint and the other harpies," Steve replied, motioning over to their feathered friend, who was back on his feet again. Or, well... talons? Those looked deadly. "Where's Bucky? I thought I heard you say..."
He arrived at the gym way too quickly, and as Tony walked out across the floor, he tried plastering a fake smile on his face and steeling himself for the inevitable reaction of his teammates.

I can do that," Tony had replied. Now, Clint wasn't sure if he'd actually bet Tony something, or if he'd just dared him to create it, or if this had just become a thing that they did now. It's not like he didn't attempt to help out with whatever Tony needed him to do, so...
"Bruce is on a mission," Clint pointed out, relaxing against the wall behind him once Tony was done. "Thanks... I didn't think they'd be shooting at

The quiet footsteps came running over to his jail cell and stopped. A whispered voice asked, “Tony? Oh my God, Tony, is that you?”
been battling villains that day—what if one of them had recognized you and kidnapped you?"
. "This is going to help you, right? I don't... I didn't know you were in this much pain—"
He then gestured for the rest of the team to follow after him to this blocked off area where apparently (hopefully) they'd be safe from any effects of the ray.
"The Hydra agents are only being knocked out, not killed," Tony replied, though he knew that this battle wasn't what they were talking about. It was the ex-assassin they were talking about. It was the mind-controlled Avenger they were talking about. It was the soldier they were talking about. It was the

"People might try to hurt you to get to me," Steve pointed out. "Or to get to the team... We all care about you, Tony. Plus, you're a billionaire. I know you used to train with other people in case anything bad happened. I won't go easy on you, if that's what you're worried about."
"Me too," Steve agreed. "I thought you knew by now that you shouldn't be doubting my love for you."

If I was a really evil author I would’ve added this onto the ending:

“You’ve got no reason to not breathe,” Clint spoke up, patting Tony’s back as he walked around him. Tony rolled his eyes when the archer whistled at him. “I think we’ve got you lookin’ pretty good.”
Tony rolled his eyes. "I'd be insulted if you did."
Steve didn’t shed one single tear at the funeral. Most of the team thought that he was still in shock over what had happened. It was a good alibi, which meant that Steve didn’t have to explain a thing to them. He didn’t have to voice
Tony nodded slowly, looking back and forth between the two men. "I guess you weren't expecting yourself from another world to be such a mess."

break up with him, that wouldn't be 'wrong' at all, it would just be Steve's decision.
"Well, this changes how we're going to spend the day," Steve mused, lifting Tony up so that he could set him onto the workbench not that far away. Tony grinned, pulling his super-soldier back in for another kiss.
Natasha spoke to him in Russian.

He fell off of the train, during that one mission after it had gone so horribly wrong. “I-I remember now. Sorry, sometimes I just… I could’ve sworn I just saw him not that long ago.”
"Sorry bud, but you're not on this team," Steve said. "You'll always be on my team, though."
This world's Thor was a bit different than his own, of course, with the first part being the fact that Thor actually lived at the tower. In his world, Thor went back and forth from Asgard to visiting Jane, only stopping by for visits or if the world was going to be destroyed. Now, that didn't mean that he didn't like Thor, because he
"Well, since you didn't know most anyone else, this is Edwin Jarvis," Iron Man filled in, upon seeing his look of confusion. Iron Man reached up, and Steve was confused for a moment before he realized that Iron Man was taking his helmet off.

“Don’t ruin our family, Steve,” she pleaded.
"I've missed you, you jerk," Steve whispered, and Bucky reached out to take his hand. Ignoring the blood that was so obviously on his hand, Steve took it.

"Whenever Bruce finds the cure—we're not going to rush him, especially since... if it goes wrong..." Steve said, glancing over at Tony just for a second. Neither of them had mentioned a thing about what Tony had explained, about how if Steve hadn't been there that Tony wouldn't even exist anymore. "I just want to make sure everything's perfect first."
was your first thought?" Tony asked skeptically. "It wasn't 'oh, he's so old—what if he had a heart attack from walking through the park?' After all, not everyone's a super-soldier."
"I thought you... didn't want to come back. I thought you didn't want my help," Steve said slowly, not even sure of how to feel. Was Bucky here to stay, or was he just here to say something before he left again? He wasn't sure if he should feel joy or worry—was he finally able to relax and not have to go out hunting for his best friend, the man he thought to be dead for so long?
Tony noticed that Stark was sitting on Rogers' other side, holding onto his hand. He, on the other hand, had already let go. He wondered for a moment if the Tony Stark of this world was dating the Steve Rogers here. He guessed so, seeing the way that Stark was acting.

If he told anyone about this, they’d think he was crazy.
Bucky said.
"Really? But you two look so similar..." Stark whined. "Please tell me he's still just as handsome as me."
And they were really good actors.

“Tony,” Steve murmured, putting one hand up. His other hand was keeping him from falling onto the ground. “Don’t go back—they’ve got silver bullets. I don’t want them to kill you.”
“Me too, kid, me too,” Tony chuckled, smirking when Happy grabbed Peter and dragged him off to the side to sit in the front row, where he’d be able to give the pastor the rings when called.
Was it really so hard to believe that Steve would marry him? Sure, that was one of his biggest fears, back when they first started dating. Tony had been petrified of telling anyone in the world, teammates included, because what if everyone just assumed that Steve deserved better? What if they thought that he was just going to taint Steve with the kind of reputation that he’d built up over the years?

Back when he'd first dragged himself off to the lab, he was going to suggest that the two of them sleep in separate rooms. The only reason that he hadn't was because Steve didn't look at him with the disgust that Tony had been expecting—
it. Oh God...
"That isn't true," Steve said, arms gripping his lover a little tighter, like if he didn't the other man might disappear. "You have a lot of people who love you, Tony, and while I can't comment on your parents, as I never met Maria and Howard was... different, when I knew him... There are a lot of people who care about your well-being, who want to see you happy... and I've seen too many times when you weren't as happy as you could've been... And I miss seeing your smile."
"Not a problem," Rogers said, smiling. "There can never be too many Tonys."
As he climbed the rocks of Vormir, heading towards the grave of one of his dearest friends, the super-soldier braced himself for the conversation he was about to have. It wasn’t going to be pretty, if he had to argue, but he had all the time in the world to do so.
For Tony, he had never felt so good in the morning as when he was heading downstairs to show off his new ring and inform his team of the good news: that soon he’d be going by the name of Tony Stark-
Steve rolled his eyes at Bucky's smirk. "I like him too, believe me."
"There's something I need to tell you," Tony said, instantly regretting the way that he said it because Steve's eyes widened and the man's grip on his hand increased slightly in pressure, like he was worried that something bad was just about to happen.

The genius laughed. “Alright, alright. I’ll tell you eventually… but for now—I’m tired, you kept me up so long last night!”
"Well, it was nice meeting you guys, but we've still got to go get our own Steve back," Clint said, gesturing to the portal.

—he’d been at her funeral, he’d made his peace with her when they’d originally found him.
"He, uh... beat me some, when I was... well, up until I went off to school, really," Tony whispered. The emotion was raw on his face, and it pained Steve to hear it. When he closed his eyes, he could imagine how he felt, just a small boy hiding from his drunk step-father, getting beaten when his Ma hadn't been able to stop him, or after he'd already beaten her. He knew exactly how Tony felt... except the cruel man in his life was a

“You are
"They didn't," Tony agreed. "I think Natasha already knows."
Tony used to be really self-conscious about going out and holding hands and acting like a couple. He was so used to the media dragging whoever he was dating through the mud and trying to ruin their relationship—he'd had people claim that they had his children, that he cheated on whoever he was dating, all sorts of crap. They'd done that with Steve, too. Except his husband believed

he wanted to, but he did. The issue was, the more he talked with the other man, the harder it was for him to hate him. He was actually an interesting man to talk to, and Tony learned quickly that they were more similar than he'd been expecting. They even had the same sense of humor.
"Tony," Steve said softly, and he was a bit surprised that he didn't follow it up with
He stood up, moving closer. He wanted so badly to just hug his friend, like no time had passed since the two were just kids in Brooklyn, but he knew that
"Of course we will be," Bucky replied. "The issue is these two. You'd think that once they found out what they had to do, they'd listen. It's simple enough."
that those people were after me."
Steve laughed. "It's been too long since we've had Team Dinner at a restaurant. That sounds like a good plan."
“We can return the stones,” Natasha said with the certainty of someone who had died and been brought back. “Just go back home, okay?”
“Well that was unexpected,” Steve murmured as soon as they were in the elevator together. He kept Tony wrapped up in his arms, and Tony leaned back against his fiancé’s chest. He was right where he belonged.
"Oh believe me, I know, no matter how many times it seems like it," Tony laughed, grinning at the easy smile that crossed Steve's face. Finally. "So I have to ask, why did you ask me out to dinner?"
"Bucky, wait," Tony shouted. After running out of the bushes, Tony found himself surrounded by a couple men on horseback. One of them hooked his right arm, then another got his left with their ropes, holding him in place.
“We’re getting
. I don’t know what’s going on.”
"Why? Tony's amazing," Steve said, shocked. "I don't know why he thinks so poorly of himself! Maybe one day I'll be able to show him the man that he can't see when he looks in the mirror... maybe one day I'll manage to show him just how wonderful I think he is."
He seemed to get why Tony wanted to be on the couch when Tony wasn't able to hold back his yawns. Steve put an arm around him and held him a little closer.
"Of course he is," Steve said. "I'd be surprised if there was a Tony Stark in some world who didn't share the same good looks."
, but it was beginning to take a toll on him. He didn't have the same super-soldier stamina as his boyfriend, so by the time morning rolled around, he was

What was so wrong with him?
“That’s why I’m working on the stealth jetpacks,” Tony muttered, because
“I know that this isn’t what you want to hear, but I really do think that you should come get some food, maybe go get a shower and a couple hours of sleep on a
Steve's focus stayed on Tony, probably trying to make sure that he was okay. He smiled at his boyfriend—if he'd known how well he'd get along with Bucky, then... No, he wasn't completely convinced yet. But perhaps... Bucky wouldn't tear him and Steve apart. It didn't seem like it, at least, which was nice.
"You didn't," Tony insisted, because it was true. Steve hadn't done anything wrong, not in the slightest. And even when the super-soldier
“No, we’re going to go have a
“We gather here today,” the pastor spoke up as Tony got lost in those endless skies that were Steve’s eyes, promising to have and to hold, in sickness and health, ‘till death do us part…
"There's a chance," Tony agreed. On the other side of the huge field... Tony looked up at the sky. Gryphons and dragons were both deadly things that had already tried attacking them, and they'd barely made it out of there
"I don't think so," he sighed, leaning back against the back wall of the elevator. "I hate this, Steve."
transmitting sound.
“Tony’s… beginning to recognize us a little,” Clint said, making sure to stay back with Natasha and Bucky. Werewolf-Tony didn’t seem to have a problem with Bruce at all. “He changed back once when you were out—he explained how you saved him, how you got shot and… and how he was able to keep his right mind long enough to get you out of there.”
The fact that everyone had become such good friends with him was a little surprising. He hadn't been expecting to get so many friends, especially ones that he could trust as completely as he did with his team, and with Tony. The genius created all sorts of cool new equipment for the team of such high quality that Clint wasn't worried about any of it malfunctioning, ever. The only times when the machines had problems were when the two made them while drunk.
. But she was right, she was his wife. Something was wrong.
, or someone. That would be hilarious in a rather ironic way.
Tony flinched a little when Clint ran past Steve, though he relaxed as the archer pulled him into a tight hug.
"Good, I was hoping you would," Steve murmured, pressing a kiss to his cheek. "Now, I was serious about you needing some sleep—you haven't been getting enough of that in a long time, and I'm making sure that you're going to get some tonight."
"I don't want them to hate me... for lying for so long," Tony whispered, pressing his face against Steve's shoulder. He was glad that the genius wasn't mad for not saying something sooner, or for bringing it up in the first place. The super-soldier winced a little as he held Tony tighter, realizing that he was pressing his boyfriend against his wound, hissing in pain.

"I'm still planning on taking you out once we get back to the tower," Steve said, giving Tony a devious smirk. That look did bad things to Tony. "I was thinking a little fine dining and then we could get some dessert at home. What do you say?"
"I'm not leaving you here, Tony. We already discussed this. I'm not leaving until we find Clint
Tony couldn't help but flinch away a little. Of course Steve would be able to see right through him. There was a pain that welled up inside when his lover's arms disappeared from around him. Well, at least until Steve cupped with face with both hands and leaned down to kiss him.
Tony didn't fight him when Steve pulled the shorter man into a hug, rubbing his back. He didn't flinch away, he didn't try to leave, and for that, Steve was thankful. He needed Tony to understand that not only was he a valuable member of the team, he was also a good person, and was well-loved by everyone who actually know him.
"I want you to be happy," Tony said, unsure of how to explain himself. "And you... you'll be happier with him than with me. That's why I've been searching..."
leave Steve with the team, though, so he knew that he'd be fine.
"I'm pretty sure the battle isn't taking place anywhere near the park, so everything should be completely safe over there," his husband continued. Tony looked over at him, raising an eyebrow. "We're going out, Tony. You
Bucky had been missing for two weeks. He'd been on a mission that had led to a Hydra base—S.H.I.E.L.D. had said that it was
"Mad? Why would I be mad?" Steve asked, keeping a gentle arm around Tony's waist. "I told you, Tony, I'm never going to think less of you for hiding your identity, or for being Iron Man. I've known that you were a good person long before I knew you were Iron Man."
Tony shook his head. "Nope, not doing it. Doesn't matter how old I am, I'm still going to be going down to the lab and—"
“Did they… already? They’re already considering us?” Steve asked, awestruck. He looked so enthusiastic about it.
“You haven’t had a team since the
“Looking good, котенок,” Natasha whispered when she hugged him. There were tears in her eyes, which really surprised Tony, but he didn’t mention it.
But Steve didn’t answer him. Once he was sure that Tony wasn’t going to be running back into the room anytime soon, Bucky turned the monitor on with the volume on low, needing to make sure that his friend was okay. When he turned the monitor on, though… It was just like before. Three kids, fourth on the way, a happy life with Peggy.

, Steve, and a fourth on the way… if you leave, I don’t know what I’ll do.”
"Yes," Rogers said, grinning broadly as he wrapped an arm around Stark's waist.
"He probably has his reasons not to say anything to anyone," Stark said, though he looked worried at why Tony would be keeping that secret. "Probably shouldn't be too mad at him, right?"
Iron Man. I shouldn't try to separate a part of myself... I'd like it if you mixed nicknames around, because I really need to stay thinking of myself as Iron Man
“We won? If you’re bringing it back—what the hell happened to your arm?” Tony demanded sharply, reaching out to grab Steve’s arm before realizing that he probably shouldn’t touch it. “I thought we talked about this and agreed that Bruce would be most likely to survive, you look half dead!”
“Of course it fucking wasn’t,” Steve snarled, glaring daggers at his best friend. “Why would he be joking about something like that? When has Tony
“He’ll be back,” Tony whispered. “I can promise you that. Just give him time. Have a little faith.”
Steve quickly peeled his dirty clothes off, not feeling like he needed to get a shower just yet—he was too exhausted—so instead he just grabbed some new clothes and dragged himself down to the lab. What was Tony doing in the lab this late?
"I knew it would work," Steve whispered as all of their teammates came running over, shouting their names and hugging them tightly.
“No, it wasn’t your fault,” Natasha said quickly. “It was ours, we all just assumed. We should’ve known you wouldn’t be joking around about this. And I would definitely understand if you didn’t want to see us around the tower for a little while—”
"Steve... you
"I wasn't going to come back," Bucky said, hanging his head a little. "Not until I figured out for myself who I was... and while I'm not ready to be back, I..." Bucky's right arm had been across his body, and Steve had just thought he'd been holding his mechanical arm. When he moved his right arm, though, there were two large gunshot wounds in his side. "The arm broke, I was injured, and I... I didn't know where else to go."
“I’m sorry that they did something and they used my face to do it, Tony, but you
Everyone went quiet when suddenly Tony was glowing bright blue and floating a couple inches off the ground. The bird creatures had all been tied down and the centaur all quieted down when they saw Tony. The ropes around his wrists burned off.
"They're on their way," Steve said as he walked back over. "Bucky, I want you over by the weapons. Make sure that the scientist doesn't get out. I'm going to see if I can calm these people down. Tony, could you go get Clint?"

we can get out of here for a while. It's been a while since I've taken my fella out, and I think we could both use a night out."
Steve quickly turned around. "What are you doing? I thought your identity was a secret!"
"It'd be easier if I could get outside," Iron Man grunted, knocking another Hydra agent away. "The suit's a bit heavy for fighting on the ground this close to everyone." When Iron Man turned and put a heavy armored hand on his shoulder, saying, "duck," he listened. "Barnes," Iron Man shouted, blasting a couple Hydra agents away from Bucky over Steve's shoulder.
A couple of the people on horses seeing to be trying to rope down the bird-people, and... other people on horses? Someone was in danger.
Something was missing. He had his whole family here—Peggy and Michael and Mary and Susan and… There was something missing. Something was wrong.
When Tony strutted into the kitchen, he was slightly disappointed that only
my arm would’ve been enough,” Bucky muttered, though he was smiling now. “It’s good to have you back, Tony. Now that I see what they did to you, I definitely don’t feel bad about the number of aliens I’ve killed. Now—you need to be on that ship where Bruce can patch you up. At least then I know we can get out of here.”
Those six words seemed to be enough to make everyone at the table feel uncomfortable. A silence fell over the team. Tony sighed,
The other man dragged him to his feet, and Steve tried to hold back his grimace of pain as much as possible.
"It's
up for it! Next time
I mean, the way you talk about Iron Man sometimes would make anyone think that you're in love with him."
"We'll tell you next time," Steve replied. "We weren't thinking about it, we were just enjoying the day."
The giant hole in the side of the plane took Steve right back to the moment when he was on the train, reaching for Bucky, trying to save his friend and ultimately being unable to do so. It sent him into a panic, making sure that he put himself between Bucky and that gaping hole in the metal. The air pressure was already nearly enough to send them out, but Steve was prepared for that.
going to use the gauntlet,” Steve murmured, mumbling a ‘thanks’ when Tony took the stone from him and placed it back into the box. “There’s going to be something that happens after Bruce has the gauntlet… something you can’t prepare for. But just know this—no matter what happens, I’ll always be there for you. Okay? Whatever it takes. Things are going to hurt,
—he will tear you apart, and the rest of us, too, unless you let us kill the beast,” the man growled, his voice low and dangerous. There was fear in his eyes, though, as he kept looking back over at the sword. “Only silver can kill a werewolf.”
Now, of course, he
There was a pressure that started growing in his head, but the instant he snapped his fingers, Steve found his world engulfed in a black nothingness.
The archer nodded, but he still looked worried. Tony quickly plugged a device in and started going through the data, trying to figure out what might’ve caused a glitch.

of you are going to be invited to our wedding, that’s for sure.” A couple of times while Steve snapped at the team, Tony noticed the way that the wide-eyed Avengers tried to interrupt him, casting scared and guilty glances over at Tony. “And you know what? Even though this is Tony’s tower, I might have to ask you all to leave after how badly you treated the love of my life—”
He wasn't exactly sure why that pained expression crossed Steve's face, but he was pretty exhausted, so he couldn't really worry all that much.

team.
"That sounds like a good plan," Steve agreed, though Tony was pretty sure he was just agreeing because the two of them were snuggled up on the couch and if they started arguing, they wouldn't be cuddling anymore. The issue with arguing now was that make-up sex wasn't an option, and Tony was too tired to argue about anything. Plus, Steve seemed to be agreeing with him to keep him calm and relaxed and not thinking about their dilemma.
No one was quite sure of how to break the curse, and while Tony locked himself away in the lab to figure it out… he hadn’t gotten very far.
going to change is who walks down the aisle first if you don’t get down there soon!”
He didn't even answer. Putting his hands on Steve's... hips, perhaps, Tony stood on his toes as Steve leaned down to kiss him. True love's kiss. Who would've guessed? Certainly not Tony, who was still kissing Steve when he realized that they were back in the tower.
“The townsfolk and the witch both said that there’s no way to reverse it,” Steve said with a sigh. He didn’t want to believe it, but Bruce hadn’t been able to find anything, and neither had any of them. Tony whined again at the mention of a lack of cure, but then he licked Steve’s face, making the super-soldier chuckle. Even if there wasn’t a cure… as long as he still had
“Tony, come on, we can’t be here for long. You’re hurt!” not-Steve gasped when he noticed the bandages that Tony had wrapped around himself and the bruises and cuts on his face. “Tony, God, what did they do to you? Let me just—I’ll carry you.”
, let alone when we first got together, or when we got married... I'm always going to be here for you, Tony."
“I know,” Tony said, smiling at him. It wasn’t like he was going to lie to Bucky—he knew Steve loved him, and he knew that Steve would choose him over Peggy. Did Bucky think that he
“It looked more like… the simulation,” Clint mumbled.
“Peggy,” Steve spoke up, and she looked up into his eyes. Everything fell silent in that moment. “Peggy... I already made my peace with you. You understood… after I took the plane down. You moved on, you had a life.”
Bucky looked so pale, so
His mind couldn't help but change that small, scared blond boy to a brunet one, the step-father being replaced by an old friend of his.
“It’s not,” Bucky interrupted. He reached out, placing a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “It’s really not. We’re going to have to make this up to you for a while now, okay? We really messed up, but we’re going to have to find a way to make it up to you.”
where he wanted to vacation at, ever. Right now, even going to Ohio, in the
“Do you think I’ll be a good husband?” Tony whispered, biting his tongue. Should he have asked that? He didn’t have time to question himself.
“We need you, Papa,” Mary said. When his eyes met those of his daughter, there was that feeling inside. He knew that he couldn’t leave them—that’s why he was so worried. That

that Bruce would be furious at him. Not furious in the Hulking out kind of way, but furious in the passive-aggressive anger for a week kind of way. "But that's nothing new, with the arc reactor and all—and when I was trying to keep the suit on. It's not made for... this body."
“You guys… you’re still alive,” he gasped, reaching out with one arm to grip Bucky’s hand. “He said… he said you were all dead, that I didn’t escape fast enough, that I… that I lost all of you.”

“I was wondering if those generals would ever let you leave,” was his only greeting when he walked into the kitchen. He grinned, giving his lover a kiss before he picked up the tiny blonde haired little girl who was at his feet.

That didn't change the fact that he was sitting at the kitchen table, head down, waiting for the coffee to brew so that he might be able to get some of that sweet caffeine energy into his veins.
to be upgrades for Bucky's arm, but I'm still mad at him, so that'll have to wait. At least Clint comes up with creative ideas."
"Thanks J," Tony said, grinning as he carefully pulled himself out of Steve's arms. The super-soldier grabbed his helmet, waiting until Tony got back into the suit before he handed it to him. The issue was, Tony didn't manage to get the helmet back on before Bruce came running into the room.
"I've seen places where they haven't... and I'm real thankful for the team I

his family? He needed to see them, he’d never been away from them for so long… how long had it been since he’d last seen them? A few days? A few weeks? Months?
"I should be the one thanking you," Tony said smoothly. "It's not every day that someone so handsome asks me out for dinner." He reached across the table, taking Steve's hand. "But really, Cap, thank you. It's been a pleasure, getting to know you and the Avengers."
Tony's heart ached as he thought about not being able to share a bed with Steve anymore. The moment that Bucky was back, Steve would spend all of his time with his not-dead-anymore 'best friend' (Tony was almost
“You can either give the stone to me, or return it to Vormir,” Skull spoke up unhelpfully, making a throwing gesture.
"I know," he said, though there was no way that Steve wasn't able to tell that he was lying. He could always see right through Tony's lies, and while he gave him a look, Tony just glanced away. Steve sighed and took ahold of his hand.
“I know he loves me, Buck… but he’s not choosing between me and Peggy,” Tony said calmly. It was the truth. But it wasn’t the
Group hugs weren't exactly things that happened in the Avengers very often, but everyone seemed to realize that Tony needed some comfort at the moment, so they all wandered over and kept him from leaving by enveloping him in their arms. No matter what Tony may have thought before, he would definitely realize now just how much the team did care for him, and just how important he was to them.

dating you, right? Not... Iron Man?"
"We're under the car," Tony shouted, slowly rolling out from underneath the vehicle that he and Bucky had been working on. When he managed to sit up, he wasn't surprised to see Steve standing there smiling.
"You looked like you were ready to maul Bucky over that," he snorted. "I learned from his mistakes. Never mess with an old, cranky super-soldier."
“Tony, darling, what did they do to you? I swear, I’m not one of them, I’m not here to hurt you,” the Skrull said, keeping his hands up as he slowly inched towards Tony. “I don’t know what they might’ve done, but I can promise you that I’m here to get you out. We knocked out a couple of those shapeshifting freaks on the way over here, but I
"Iron Man?" Steve asked, trying to get the other man to wake up. There was no way that he could be dead... No way. "Iron Man, can you hear me? Are you okay?"
"T-they... they keep putting fake memories in my head, Steve," Bucky cried. "I-I thought I'd seen you die, so many times, a-and... thank God you're here. B-but it wasn't... it
Clint's face turned bright red again, but now he had a hand up to his earpiece, too, intent on listening.
But Steve was right. Why
“Can we go out sometime? I mean if you really are interested, then maybe…” Tony mumbled. In that moment, Steve swore that he was going to make sure that Tony was eventually able to be his confident self again, that he was going to help him with the werewolf side until he was comfortable with it.
It was—
"Tony, darling, you're lost in that big head of yours," Steve murmured, those soft hands of his carefully cupping his face. He pressed a soft kiss to Tony's lips before murmuring, "Come on back to me, darling. What's troubling you so much? Bruce will figure this out, you don't have to worry about that."
And habits are hard to break.
"It's okay, Bucky, you're safe now," Steve murmured. Those two were just so perfect together. Tony loved it—he'd always admired how those two stuck by one another through everything. He'd grown up with stories about Steve and Bucky from his Aunt Peggy. They'd been his childhood heroes. Seeing them together was just so...
“Everything’s fine,” he whispered. Something was wrong, and he was going to figure out what.

before.
"Bucky," Steve said before he was able to even think about it. The other super-soldier, who'd been quite focused on the ground for a while looked up like he was startled, like he hadn't expected to see them outside the tower.
"We don't have to do this if you're not comfortable, darling," he reminded his lover. Instead of replying, Tony leaned forward and captured his lips, pulling Steve down on top of him. Grinning, Steve deepened the kiss, melting against his husband. He could feel Tony's nimble fingers undoing his pants and pulling them off, and Steve backed off a little, lifting his lover before setting him down across the middle of the bed.
"Because... why would anyone love me when my own parents couldn't?" Tony whispered, once more breaking Steve's heart.
"We're going to have to talk about that," Steve whispered, stealing another kiss from Tony. "But first... do you want the suit back on before the team gets here?"

Caring, sure. Obviously Steve didn't know enough about his past. "I'm still surprised that you're interested in men," Tony mumbled. "I would've thought..."
Steve could feel the blood running down his leg—he needed to get that bullet out, this was going to be a
"But... but I did good," Bruce said, and Tony couldn't help but hug his friend as he continued dragging him out of the room.
"Tony! Steve!" Tony couldn't help the glare that settled on his face when Bruce ran, screaming, into the kitchen that morning. He'd had a late night—a

really just... made you up. It wouldn't be the first time they'd made life seem perfect before they tore it away."
"Glad someone got to enjoy it," Bucky muttered, though he did look happy for them. He knew that they couldn't go out and have a day at the park without being recognized, because he couldn't either. "A quick text wouldn't hurt, though."
This felt real.
"Finally," Tony said, turning to leave. He wasn't really all that surprised that Steve grabbed his arm before he could leave.
“Nope, it’s all genetic,” Tony retorted, making his teammate snort with laughter.

. "Thank you."
"I wonder if Steve wants to help us with this," Tony mumbled, taking the wires that Clint was holding so that he could finish wiring the machine.
There was still someone that he needed to see. He hurried after Clint to the front of the ship. When Clint took his place as co-pilot, the other co-pilot stood up.
“Sorry, but they died the moment that they changed—once they change, they don’t change back,” the guy said, shrugging. “Curse doesn’t come off.”
"I just needed to make sure that I didn't accidentally make you
“Move,” Steve snarled at the townspeople. He took ahold of Tony’s hand the moment that the man was close enough to him. He waved the sword
"Tony," Steve said, and he could hear the 'Captain America' tone in his voice. He really shouldn't have been surprised that the man had his superhero suit underneath his date suit. The man easily leapt into action, trying to herd people towards the exit.

"Come on, let's get out of here," Steve said, giving them both a quick kiss before keeping them held up upright. "Someone's not allowed out of the tower for the next week."

Ours was a hard case, I know that, because we’re superheroes. I wouldn’t trade this life for
"Getting Tony to stay in bed and out of the lab is nearly impossible," Steve mumbled, nuzzling against Bucky's neck.
"You think he might be interested? I mean... I'd try arguing he's from the forties, but so's Steve, and he asked you out pretty quickly," Clint murmured, getting his bow and arrows ready before setting up his long-range icer guns.
Tony didn't reply, which Steve would've found concerning if he hadn't been so exhausted. So instead of worrying, he tightened his grip on his boyfriend and fell asleep with Tony in his arms.
"Good," Bruce said. "Then if everything is fine, you can go be bored in the living room."

to be Steve, based on the way that Bucky was looking beyond him.
"Maybe," Steve said. He didn't even have the decency to hide that smug look, either. "Is it working?"
"You've already said that... many times," Tony replied as he continued down the path. All they needed to do was find Steve and Clint, and figure out a way out of this stupid fairytale. "It'll be over soon, Buck. All fairytales end the same way, right? True love's kiss? So you and Clint shouldn't have any trouble."
“We need you,” Mary added. “Please, Papa, please.”

"I know you will," Steve said. "You always do."
The archer was watching him with wide eyes, like he was shocked at the Skrulls would actually do something like shapeshift to look like them while they hurt Tony. His shocked look turned to concentration before he frowned.
—they were human once! Did anyone even
The genius's sniffles slowly started dying down as his lover pressed his face against his chest. "I'm sorry," Tony whispered, though Steve was glad that he didn't try to pull away and isolate himself. The first couple times he'd woken up from nightmares, that had been what he'd tried to do, and it hurt Steve to have to watch the man he loved go through so much pain and be unable to even try to help him with it. He'd finally started accepting that Steve was there to help him with whatever it was that he needed, which currently was someone to listen.

"I'm going to do better, Tony, I promise," Steve whispered, kissing his forehead before setting him down onto their bed. Better? What did he mean by he'd do better? He'd never had someone who cared about him as much as Steve did—in the past, his relationships hadn't always been very good. Sometimes they'd turned a bit abusive, sometimes the person was just using him for his money or fame or

"Now I understand why you would always check up on me so much..." Tony mumbled, grinning as the suit opened. "And here I thought it was just because I was being reckless in the lab so often."
“It wasn’t a lie,” Steve said, the ‘voices’ still echoing with answers in his ears, only for him to hear. “It was a test, to make sure we would return, to make sure we would fix… The stones are back. They just wanted the stones to be back where they should’ve been, so a timeline wasn’t left without them. They’re too important to the fabric of the universe…”
The pet name made Tony smile as he drifted off again, ignoring the insecurities for once to allow himself to feel happy about the fact that Steve Rogers actually
“Love you too,” Tony whispered as a small smile spread across his face. Steve was right, he shouldn’t be worrying about that.
When the rest of the Avengers showed up, they dragged him over to the kitchen.
"I'm sure it went fine," Steve said calmly, looking like he was trying his hardest to hide his amusement at Bruce's antics. "Thanks, Bruce."
A gravestone clearly marked with the name

“It’s okay, babe, just stay calm,” Tony said, feeling completely helpless. Was it the simulation? Was it crashing? There was no way, it wasn’t possible. He made sure of that. There wasn’t too much power going to the machine, so there would never be a power surge that could cause a crash…
“I can’t—they’ll get you,” Steve said, gasping in pain when one of the bullets hit his leg. Cursing, he tried not to let Tony go, but Tony was struggling

He could only imagine the smile that would cross Tony's face, behind that mask. "Yeah, let's finish this."

He followed the man's gesturing to see the way that the light seemed to bend differently in the middle of the room. The beginning of a portal, apparently. Steve lifted Stark's legs off of him, smiling a little upon hearing the man's protests. He put the sketchbook down the moment that the morphing light started shifting into a rainbow of colors.
. You guys still let me be an Avenger," he pointed out. Steve really liked how good of friends Tony and Bucky had become. At first, he'd been a little worried, but the two had gotten close pretty fast. So when Bucky had such a serious look on his face, he knew that it would be impossible for Tony to ignore.
just let me know what’s hurting,” not-Bruce said, putting a gentle hand on Tony’s face. “I’m going to get you patched up, okay Tony?”
“Excuse me, Ma’am,” Steve said as he approached one of the townspeople. He had to dress like a civilian who was just visiting the town—they did get plenty of curious visitors, so it wasn’t uncommon—instead of wearing his superhero suit. “I’m looking for a woman in her late twenties with dark blonde hair and green eyes—I didn’t catch her name. I was told she lived here?”
The alternate-Tony smirked. The man's hair was a lot darker than his own, and his facial hair was trimmed in a slightly different style. His eyes, though, were the same. "Yeah, great, expect for you dropped down from a little too high directly onto a car. Might be a little more effective if you were able to control it better. Can I get your plans?"

"Before that, why don't we go do some hand-to-hand practice in the gym? I know you probably don't need it, but in case you're ever in a situation where no one's around to protect you... I want you to be safe," Steve said. Tony hadn't been ready to tell him about Iron Man yet, he supposed, so making sure that he was trained well just in case was something that he could definitely do. He didn't want to make Tony feel any more uncomfortable than he already did about the situation, so forcing him to reveal his secret probably wasn't the best thing to do.

bad of a villain, none of them really looked injured. When Tony looked over to his husband, he could see the same look of relief on his face upon seeing their teammates heading back to the tower.
"Bucky, get as close as you can to Hydra before showing yourself. And keep enough distance so that they can't use any of the technology against you," Steve said, holding onto the suit. He must've trusted Tony to take him exactly where he needed to be, since he wasn't paying any attention to where they were going.
"Tony Stark," he said, a small smile crossing his lips. "My boyfriend."
"Nope," Iron Man replied. "The portal seemed unstable, so I'd guess if anyone else was caught in it, they'd be in another universe right now. Why, someone you wanted by your side?"
"I thought you said that you were dating the Tony Stark of your world," Stark said, returning to the room once his armor was gone.
Hydra had tried stealing a shipment of weapons, hijacking a plane that was on its way to S.H.I.E.L.D. Luckily the team had managed to get on board and had started taking down the enemy agents.
"The rest of the Avengers will be arriving in three minutes, and I have informed Dr. Banner that you have returned. He will be here in thirty seconds," Jarvis warned. "I figured that you two could... use a moment."
,” Bruce said calmly, and Tony frowned at him when he placed a hand on his knee. “This isn’t healthy, and it’s not what you want to hear, but sitting here staring at him isn’t going to help.”
“I mean, you do know who you’re marrying, right? Some punk kid from Brooklyn?” Bucky continued, grinning cheekily. “You still haven’t even convinced him to start wearing a
It was perfect.
“They have treated you worse,” the demonic man said, floating alongside him like they were old friends. Only one set of footsteps echoed across the rocks. “They have given you everything you never realized you wanted, then took it all away from you, yes? And they have given me infinite wisdom. Who has it worse?”
“I love you too,” Steve murmured, looking brighter than the sun as he smiled at Tony.
they'd been together before and during the war). He'd forget about their relationship (probably not, Tony presumed), or he'd break up with him as nicely as he could (because Steve was a nice guy like that).
"Why?" Steve asked.
The super-soldier smiled and nodded. “Get some rest. We’ll be home soon, and when we do get back… I’m getting some food for you, and then as much as I want to lock you away in our bedroom, there’s no way that the team is letting me have you to myself for quite a while.”
That adorable blush crossed Steve's face again. "I wasn't sure what you were used to... I didn't want to mess up my chances."
How had he even believed for so long that what he saw in that
He made the mistake of calling them his family.
In a dark suit and a red and blue tie, Peter appeared at the end of the aisle, grinning as he held onto both a pillow with rings on it and a bag with flower petals. He looked like he was bursting with excitement as he scattered flower petals all along the aisle.
"What he means to say," Tony said, stepping in, "is that the Winter Soldier is an Avenger, and if you attack any of the Avengers again you will be escorted by a government agency to jail, where you'll be kept for shooting at another human and also for shooting at an agent of the law. Do I make myself clear?"
Smiling to himself, Steve knew that he wouldn't get a chance to ask for a while. He wanted to see Tony as happy as possible for as long as possible before he had to bring up something dark in Tony's past that caused him to feel like he wasn't worth anything, that he wasn't worth being a hero.
"Thanks," Steve murmured, leaning against Tony. "I shouldn't have gotten mad, but they..."

"Regardless, I'm glad you asked me out, because I was beginning to think that I was just a washed-out has-been," Tony said, in a way wanting to chase Steve off. He didn't want to hurt the man, because Steve was
The brunet nodded and moved to take Steve's place so that he could get some blood drawn. The super-soldier was a little worried, since he knew that Tony wasn't exactly comfortable around Bucky—he should've noticed earlier, why wasn't he paying enough attention?—and he didn't want to keep Tony near Bucky if it made him so uncomfortable.
“I’ve got the rings, Mr. Stark,” he whispered cheerfully as he gave Tony a quick hug. “This is so great, everything’s so beautiful! I’m so glad you and Captain America are finally getting married.”
. What was wrong with him?
“Nice try,” Clint continued, blissfully ignorant to Tony’s declining mood as he patted his teammate’s shoulder and headed out of the room. “You almost convinced me there.”
a family,” Bucky snapped, startling the genius. He hadn’t noticed how agitated his words had made the super-soldier. Calmer, he repeated, “He has a family.
“You’ll be fine,” Bruce assured Tony, gripping his shoulder and giving him a look before he scurried off to find his girlfriend.
"Tony... no. Don't," Steve said, taking both of Tony's hands in his own. The brunet looked up at him with confused eyes and a slight frown on his face. "Please, just... don't think about that right now. I haven't been spending enough time with you, and I get that. I'm sorry. So please, can we go do something—"
“I need… I need to make sure that you know something, okay? I need to make sure that you understand that Steve has never loved someone more than he loves you,” Bucky said, his voice strangely calm. That nervous look had turned pleading. “If he

"It helps," Tony whispered. "An electromagnet... keeps me alive." It wasn't a lie. Steve didn't mention Iron Man. "You're not locking me in the tower, right?"
"Keep telling yourself that," Clint murmured, and Tony just rolled his eyes at the two.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, pressing his face against his husband. He breathed in that warm scent, of coffee and blueberries and… not grease and oil? Tony hadn’t been working in the lab, he could tell. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know… I thought I

, for that matter.
Despite the plan that he’d gone over with his team, which of course
"I guess you're right about that," Steve chuckled. When they got to the kitchen, the super-soldier headed over to his chair like everything was normal, so Tony headed over to the coffee machine and grabbed his mug, filling it up before he turned to go sit down.
"And if you were forced to do something against your control, would

"Are you sure I didn't mess it up?" Steve asked, looking out across the sky. While he wasn't a huge fan of being in the Helicarrier, it did have its moments. Like now, for example, with the brilliant sunset stretching out across the land, glittering on the water. He'd wanted to spend the evening with Tony—after the first few dates, he'd begun to see the other man start to open up to him, though there was still a lot that he was holding back on—but then he’d been called in by S.H.I.E.L.D.
“No, I can help,” Steve mumbled, using his free—
"Oh Tony," Steve whispered, gently kissing Tony's knuckles.
Things got very bad, very quickly when Steve’s whole body seized up, and he seemed to hold his breath—or he was choking. Tony was trying to keep him still, and there was this horrible feeling inside that this might be the last time he’d ever see Steve alive.
"I wanna make some changes to your suit too," Tony mumbled. "If I can get your shield to come back to you... if you ever lose it, then that would be helpful. But it can't be a powerful magnet... or else me 'nd Buck are gonna get stuck to you..."
"Whatever you say," Tony said, but that was going to cause a problem. He wasn't exactly sure he'd be able to kiss Steve. Tony wasn't stupid, he definitely
"Come on, what's wrong?" Steve asked, and he actually sounded very worried. Great, that was the last thing that he wanted. "I know I've been gone a lot. I promise, I'll stay here more. You'll see."

Iron Man sighed, shaking his head. "I still don't understand what you see in him that makes you want to date him. You know, I wouldn't judge you if it was about the money."
And then one day, Steve didn't come back, and when the team went out searching for him, Tony saw on live television as the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier crashed into the water, after Steve had fallen first. They rushed over and found him onshore—obviously someone had gotten him out of the water—before he was rushed to the hospital. Tony broke down, his teammates stayed with him, and eventually he ended up passed out on one of the chairs.

, knowing that it could be the last time he ever spoke to them. But Tony was right—they had now.
"Steve," he tried mumbling as the superhero carried him out of the burning building. His date made sure to keep his head pressed to his chest, held tightly to prevent injury. He couldn't smell anything more than smoke, but it did feel good to have his face pressed to the cooler fabric of Steve's suit instead of near the fire.
Tony pulled back a little and looked him right in the eye, those stunning brown eyes of his holding a concerned look. “Did you mean it?” Steve raised an eyebrow, confused, so Tony added, “When the team was coming over to get you, and you… you said not to leave, because you didn’t want to lose me… a-and because you loved me.”

"They shot it... and it stopped working," the ex-assassin replied.
"What if I was the one who took you off to bed?" Natasha asked, somehow managing to sneak up behind them and slide in between Tony and Bruce.
That's why he'd talked with Steve about asking Tony out. He knew that it could be good for both of them. They both obviously cared for one another, and Clint had noticed that in the time they'd been dating, Tony had opened up to the team more, Steve seemed more comfortable at the tower, and they both seemed a lot happier. (Even if it meant that he had to put up with them kissing in the kitchen when all he wanted was some coffee.)
"You'll still be there? Great," Clint said. Steve could practically hear his grin. He'd been trying to get Iron Man to stay around the team more often, and Steve wondered if Clint knew Tony was Iron Man.
"Brother... he told me you're basically his brother," Tony mumbled, shrugging a little. He put a couple more wires back in place, watching as the man was suddenly able to move his arm again.
“And I do believe that one day he’s going to wake up,” Tony said. “I’ve accepted it, Buck—one day he
. The man deserved so much more. He'd been worried that Captain America would be that perfect man that would drive him crazy, but in the time that he'd gotten to know him as both Tony Stark and Iron Man, he'd learned that not only was he human, but he was also so much better than Tony had ever imagined.
"About what?" Rogers asked.
There was absolutely no one in the room. Steve and Tony were gone.

The crowd started whispering—though Steve could hear that they weren’t exactly thrilled with the fact that he was an Avenger. They must’ve been able to guess that Tony was an Avenger, too.

that Steve couldn’t help the tears that came to his eyes. He then leaned up and kissed him again, more passionate this time. “I’ll see you once these stones are back. Someone’s gonna need to carry you off to the doctor, huh?”
“I know that we got off on the wrong foot at first… y’know, back when we first started dating. When I learned that you thought I was only interested in you because you’re a super-soldier… I wasn’t even sure what to think. I was stuck between thinking you didn’t really want to be in a relationship after all, what I’d been fearing the

he'd been on his own. It was just strange, now,
"My, uh... my world isn't... all that crazy, really," he mumbled, straightening his shoulders, glancing around to see that yes, they all were staring at him, except the guy who had the metal spikes in his hands.
"Good," Natasha replied, sensing the tension and choosing to leave them to their business.
“What’s wrong?” Bruce asked as he started looking over the machines. Turning his attention to Steve, he murmured, “He’s going into shock…”
"Okay, come on. You need to sit down, and I need to get this armor off," Stark sighed, and Steve settled down on the couch as the man removed the suit. Jarvis had informed them that he'd made some food, and to get to the dining room when the rest of the Avengers showed up.
"They... should've been behind us," Steve said, looking around.
, and Tony had been spinning his around on his finger all morning.
"He think Iron Man's just a friend," Tony mumbled, just glad to have the super-soldier's warm, strong arms around him. He was worried about what might've happened to his boyfriend back home, and it would definitely have been his fault if anything happened.
needed those weapons before, but he'd rather they had them than Hydra.
It had been a long and exhausting day at work, what with having to deal with so many government agents and generals and everyone else who had an idea of what he should or shouldn’t be allowed to do while donning his Captain America suit, but even after everything that he’d been through, he’d do it again just to be able to home to someone so wonderful.
"Bucky was giving me a hand with this car... Figured I needed to see for myself just how good of a mechanic he might've been if things had been different," Tony said, shrugging. The oddest thing was that he hadn't thought about how much he'd wanted to hate Bucky until now, when he actually had to force himself to think about it. Huh, maybe he wouldn't have to think about that all of the time...
Steve said, because while everyone had been willing to give their lives to bring half the universe back, only two had actually given up everything to retrieve the stones.
"I just... I just need to stay here with you two," Bucky murmured. He was still shivering, and Tony was pretty sure that it was because he was still terrified. "This is real, that's all I need to know."
get married?
The world was a blur of yellow, orange and red, swirling around as his head rolled until it found Steve's chest. If he could just keep his head here... Those drugs were too much. He wished that he'd been quicker before, so he would never have gotten drugged in the first place. The heat was causing sweat to drip down in his face, nearly blinding him, causing the colors to blur even more.
“You reckless idiot,” a soft voice whispered.
With his focus being near gone, Steve was surprised when suddenly Iron Man was in front of him, keeping him from getting shot by letting the armor taken the damage while Bucky took the men out.
, since he'd had the style for years. Before that guy could even question the similarities, the two of them had gotten out of that conversation and away from that guy.
"We won't be going out to battle," Tony muttered.
Tony wandered over towards the doorway, meeting Steve partway so that he could hug him.
"Fine," he muttered. The bullet had ripped all of the way through him, but luckily hadn’t hit anything vital. Whatever kind of gun those people had been using could've been really fatal. "Good? It's not that bad, and I'm not gonna bleed out. By the time I get to medical it won't be as bad. Perks of being a super-soldier."
to go out with me," Tony mumbled. "But I'm glad you did, 'cause I'm not sure I've ever been happier, having you at my side and the team all 'round me..."
Steve was right. They got home quickly, Bruce refused to let them leave until he'd had a chance to make sure that Bucky would be fine, and the rest of the team managed to get Steve and Tony over to the kitchen to get some food before they were allowed to smuggle Bucky off to their bedroom.
"I think he's very interested. He asks about you a lot in the lab, whenever you're not around. I've been trying to be encouraging, but... He's still got this idea in his head that because he was brainwashed and used as a weapon against the people he cares about, he must be a bad person who doesn't deserve to be happy," Tony said, hovering in front of Clint's setup. He opened one of the compartments in his left gauntlet, pulling out a little machine he'd made. His faceplate was still up, and he gave Clint a look. "Now, doesn't that sound familiar?"
he looked so happy. They were tears of joy that were running down his face, Steve knew so as he gently brushed them away and kissed the top of Tony's head.
"Do I look okay to you?" It wasn't like he was trying to be mean to his team, but he was pretty annoyed by the whole situation. No, he wasn't okay. He was eighty-something when he should've been about fifty years younger. It wasn't fair.

As he wrapped up his most recent chest and shoulder wound, Tony tried to make himself more comfortable. It was hard to do that when he was locked up in a metal jail cell and left nothing except for his boxers, but that was okay. He was just a little cold at nighttime, nothing more.
"I'd have to bring my Steve with me next time," Tony mumbled, while Stark just laughed.
"You don't have to," Tony promised, keeping the injured soldier held close. Steve wandered over, wrapping his arms around the both of them, and Tony couldn't help but grin. "We'll be here, Buck, don't worry. We're taking you home."
One of the men grabbed him again, and he attempted to hit him, while his knees buckled underneath him. The punch missed, and his elbow twisted back in pain as the men tried to keep him down. He could hear them muttering about him.
,” not-Steve said. “They’ve done this before—they used our faces to hurt him.”
"Steve, put a shirt on," Bucky shouted, snapping Tony out of his thoughts. "Your boyfriend is drooling over here. He hasn't even had time to wake up yet, and you've already got him drooling all over the table."
. As he turned the doorknob and opened the large, oak door, Steve called out, “Honey, I’m home!”
"He's not fine, actually, but I can get him back to the tower," Tony assured the team. "And if you were implying I'm hurt, I'll have you know I'm not. The suit's pretty good at protecting me from injuries." Tony reached over and gripped one of Steve's hands. "Actually, there's something that I want to talk with you all about, once you get back."
"Depends—are you as bad with technology as Steve? Because if you
“Thanks,” Tony replied, because man did it feel good to have other people believing that everything would work out. Just hearing it spoken aloud… it was so nice.
Tony stared at the two wide-eyed. "You... that means you..." He could feel the panic setting in. They knew. He
The fire in his veins was out, leaving a familiar ache in his left arm. Familiar to the pain he’d just been in, but somewhat dulled by the fact that nothing was adding to that immense pain any longer. It was over, the pain was going to last, but he… he was alive?

he wasn’t crying because no one dared ask him why. They all just assumed…

Yet here he was, getting laughed at, just for mentioning that he was going to marry Steve. Perhaps it was the way that he told Clint? Perhaps he shouldn’t have done it so dramatically? Yeah, that must’ve been it.
, it would hurt that much more.
"Yeah, I just... don't know most of you," he said, thankful when Iron Man pulled him off to the side.
. Tony just nodded because there was no point in arguing with Steve.
"If it'll get us away from the awkwardness of being around the team, then I'm fine with that," Tony said, trying to keep an eye on all of his teammates. Bruce was fine, and Clint, Natasha and Bucky were all watching each other’s backs, so they'd be fine, too. They'd all be fine.
“How about this? You lie down on the bed for a while, and I’ll keep you company,” Steve murmured, a sly grin on his lips.
Natasha, though... she'd been

to any of the Avengers. What they didn't know couldn't hurt them. Tony sighed and pressed one hand to the arc reactor that was still embedded in his chest. He wasn't sure if it was going to be a problem, and he knew that he probably should've asked at least

Steve think of this all as some kind of joke?
Tony apparently had sent Iron Man on a mission that night, or else he would've been there. Steve believed him—the man really did seem to care about his boss most of the time. Ever since he'd joined the Avengers, he'd been less of Tony's bodyguard and more of an Avenger, but he still did do things whenever Stark needed him to.

"Iron Man mentioned we had a visitor," this world's Captain America said as he walked up. He looked Steve up and down, probably noticing his stress. "Never been to another universe before?"
"Sure," Tony agreed, barely paying attention when he found a channel that showed the battle.
Now he didn't need to worry about it anymore. How did Steve always know the exact thing that he needed to hear?
