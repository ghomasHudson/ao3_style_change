“Hi, Dr. Stark,” he says, and alright, maybe it comes out a little more breathy than he’d planned but— ”

“Yes,” she said, and he started to turn away. “Not because you’re Captain America, but because you’re Steve Rogers, and you’re good, and you’re kind, and you don’t deserve to be lonely.”
“The fact that he’s being nicer to you has to be promising, though, right? Maybe he’s trying to let you know that he’s interested in your interest.”
” He cuts himself off as soon as he realizes he’s whispering out loud, but it’s too late. Dr. Stark’s head comes up, and Steve’s in real danger of giving himself whiplash as he turns away because he can’t look at him. He can’t. “Um, sorry,” he mumbles.
Tony had barely touched him as he’d helped take off his clothes, but Steve’s cock was already hard against his stomach, and his heart was pounding like it was trying to escape the confines of his chest.  If this was how he felt before they even got started, how was he going to feel by the time he’d gotten Tony’s invention inside of him?
Tony sighs again, and the annoyance on his face makes him almost unrecognizable. He’s never looked at Steve like that before, has always been sweet and kind, and Steve has the creeping thought that he wasn’t being kind to
It started when Tony needed his help, depending on him to keep him safe while he fixed the engine. Tony trusted him with his life. It was . . . unsettling.
Tony nodded tiredly like he was humoring him. “I never forgot, though, how much you hated the idea of being with a Dom, and when Fury came to me, it was my one condition, that you were released from the contract. Not because I didn’t want you,” he said, and Steve suddenly heard in his mind “
somehow without his clothes, and Steve found himself licking his lips absently, his eyes going to Tony’s cock, as if he hadn’t just had in his mouth not that long ago.
Really, there’d only ever been a handful of occasions that’d he’d gone up against someone without either of them getting beaten black and blue. The first few times had been with Bucky when he’d tried to teach Steve to defend himself because he’d refused to let Bucky fight his fight battles for him. The last had been during Boot Camp when everyone had been expected to learn how engage in one-on-one combat.
“Well,” he begins in a completely rational way, “a lot of them get paid to take their clothes off—”
Steve hadn’t known how Tony would react to seeing him again. There’d been a part of him that had foolishly hoped Tony would be glad, and even though he hadn’t actually expected that to happen, he hadn’t fully managed to convince himself that it wouldn’t either. It was how he would’ve felt if Tony had visited him.
It’s been three weeks, and I miss you more and more every day.
He watched as Steve got into position, taking one last look at Tony before facing the wall. Tony glanced at his shoulders, and yeah, there was a line of tension there, although they weren’t stiff enough to make him concerned. It was always nerve wracking to put your bare back to someone for the first time, not knowing what exactly they’d do and unable to see them in order to prepare yourself for when they did it. That was alright, though. He planned on making sure that Steve only associated good things with being this vulnerable for Tony.
Tony’s fingers traced each curve and dip as he washed Steve’s right arm and then the left, lingering over Steve’s hands, digging into his palms and squeezing each finger. It felt amazing, and Steve wouldn’t have thought a massage would make him start getting hard, but then, he was naked, and Tony was naked, and Tony was touching him. Maybe he shouldn’t be surprised he was getting hard, even though he'd just had an orgasm; maybe he should be surprised it hadn’t happened sooner.
It’s justification and permission both, and as Dr. Stark does something particularly cruel with his fingers, Steve groans through gritted teeth and starts to come again. He sounds like he’s being tortured, and it almost feels like he is, the pleasure so severe that Steve wouldn’t be surprised if he damages the leather of the exam bed from how tightly he’s holding on. It’s all he can do not to thrash around, and he’s not completely successful, his hips shuddering against the onslaught of Dr. Stark’s fingers, but the fact that he doesn’t fall off is an accomplishment all on its own.
Steve knew it was foolish of him, that he had no right to think about a permanent place in Tony’s life now, especially considering why they were there, but it still gave him hope in a way he hadn’t felt in a long time.
, he thought and gasped silently, struggling to not let his body shudder as he tried to breathe.

He stayed completely still as Tony leaned forward, only moving to tilt his neck in order to make it easier for Tony.
He hadn’t fought when Tony had knocked into him from behind, disoriented just enough that Tony had them both in the air before he could react. He hadn’t protested then either, just rolled his eyes, assuming that Tony wanted to do a victory lap of some kind before he put him back down. Even when Tony had finally stopped flying and made it clear that Steve wouldn’t be getting down any time soon, Steve hadn’t been too concerned, because he’d thought, how bad could whatever Tony was planning be?

“It’s been a really long day, though, and I’m beat,” he said after winding down his story, trying to make voice low and soothing. “Do you mind if I turn in?”
For the prompt: Wedding Ring + Unreliable Narrator + Identity Porn
Not that he was complaining about the hugs, because he loved them. He just hadn’t expected Tony to take things so slowly.
There was no doubt that just listening to Tony explain what Steve was going to do was enough to set his body ablaze with shame, and while it wasn’t what Steve had envisioned, maybe committing himself to being a puppy, abasing himself for Tony and throwing away the last of his pride, would show just how sorry he was.
He stood over the toilet and pushed down his clothes, taking himself in hand. Although there were many benefits to his new body, there were disadvantages as well—not that he’d considered it one until after he’d woken up in a new century, alone and adrift.
“Whenever you want me to be. Just say the word, and I can be back in a few hours.”
Of course, he thinks that, but then his Angel lifts his head.
One and a half years later, they had the keys to each other’s homes, saw each other two to three times a week, and texted who knew how many times a day.
“Please,” Steve said, placing both hands on Tony’s thighs and leaning in close. He hesitated only a moment before rubbing his cheek once against Tony’s and keeping it there as he whispered into his ear, “Please.”
He’d been shaking by the time he’d let the body drop to the ground, and he’d fumbled the knife, his hands covered in blood, so much fucking blood.  He’d started crying at some point, when he didn’t know, maybe when he’d slid the knife in, or maybe when his victim had taken his last breath, but what did it matter really, and he’d had to use the back of his wrist to wipe at his nose, snot and blood smearing across the cuff of his five thousand dollar suit.
, not tomorrow or later on tonight but
Steve and Tony like to play Destiny (the video game). Destiny 1, not 2, because I don't like 2 half as much as I liked 1.
But he’d gotten a few odd looks from some of the personnel, to the point that he was all too conscious of a weight that had never been there. He knew that Stark got a lot of leeway from Fury—had seen with his own eyes the way Stark talked to him—but how many black marks were too many?
“Who keeps turning on the television for you?” Steve asks as he walks into the common room and sees Tony sitting in front of the huge screen, jumping and batting at the moving objects.  There’s no one else in the room besides the two of them.  “Sitting this close to the television can’t be good for you.  And what if it falls down?  You’d be squished,” he says and turns it off.
—I don’t plan on changing my mind about talking to him.  So where does that leave us exactly?”
Tony walked past the table set for two without comment, and Steve followed, at a loss as Tony got two large mugs down, leaving one coffee black but doctoring the second with cream and sugar. Steve only took cream in his, so he doubted either of them were for him, and Tony didn’t ask if he wanted one of his own.
, and he couldn’t—he just couldn’t.
Dr. Stark clears his throat. “I was going to actually skip the chest exam, but your nipples look swollen. Do you mind?”
But then he just … doesn’t, and when Steve finally comes less than a minute later, it doesn’t feel like an orgasm, the sensations too acute to be pleasurable, but he still yells in something like release, a dribble of come leaking from his cock.
Yes, his back hurt like fuck, and his knees were going numb, but he was used to forcing himself to function through all kinds of discomfort, and he had every intention of continuing to ignore it until …
“You’re assuming I’m going to accept your terms.”
“But I—” Steve slammed his mouth shut and bit back the protest that tried to escape. Looking back, he realized Tony had never implied his punishment was going to be physical in nature, but Steve had just assumed. He’d wanted it after seeing Tony’s back and knowing Tony had gotten hurt because of him. He’d imagined what it’d be like, Tony tying him down or ordering him to stay still to further prove his remorse, taking all his frustration and anger out on Steve’s body, not once but multiple times, the pain managing to lance Steve’s guilt for all the hurt he’d caused Tony.
“It’s not like that!”
Maybe he was being ridiculous, but he wanted it to signify something, wanted Tony to ask because Tony
“Wait. Before you—there’s something—” He forced himself to take a shaky breath. “Do you remember when I asked for a punishment and you said no? Th-that the only way you’d do it would be if
Life would be so much easier if he were a Beta.  Betas slipped under the radar without all the annoying preconceptions of what they were or what they were capable of.  People left Betas the fuck alone without all the "it's your
“I didn’t say it did,” Steve said, and he swallowed, trying to clear his throat, trying to stop staring at Stark’s fingers around his wrist.
“My fault,” Tony murmured against his skin, and really, was dinner that important? They could always eat afterward. “I shouldn’t have worn you out.” he said, pulling back, a sly smile tugging at his lips.
Captain America blinked, giving himself a little shake.  “You need to get out of here,” he said, turning around, and Tony gave a silent whistle, the back view was almost as good as the front.  “I don’t know what Nick told you, but I’m not—I’m not safe right now.”
He was going to make it up to Tony, he was, even if he didn’t know how yet, but Tony was still willing to give him a chance, and Steve wanted—
“We’ll have to replace the couches with a bed, and I hope you’re a heavy sleeper, because I am in and out of here at all times of the night, but I—”
“Washcloth.”
Warnings: AU where Steve and Tony are on different sides
“Tony?”
“I—yes,” he said, feeling ridiculously flustered, because it was one thing for Tony to know, another for him to call Steve out on it. He almost missed the tickling, because he’d been concentrating more on when the next attack would come than on the questions Tony had been asking, but now, there was nothing to distract him.
He makes sure he’s standing in front of Steve when Steve’s legs finally give out, is there to catch him and lower him gently to the floor, all the while telling him how gorgeous he is and how proud Tony is of him.
one thing?
?” Tony asked again, because had Steve
It wasn’t that Steve had swept him off his feet or kissed him passionately or gotten on his knees in front of him, nothing so obvious. He’d just brushed his fingers over Tony’s shoulders in passing and smiled at him, sweet and easy, had sat next to him on the couch with the empty cushions on the other side of him a silent testament of what they were to each other, and it’d left Tony reeling.
“When I first agreed to contract with you, being an Avenger was the carrot Fury dangled in front of me, but it wasn’t the reason I agreed. I’d grown up with you all my life,” he said, smiling weakly, “and I couldn’t let that go, no matter how much you hated me for it.”
with the rough treatment. He tried to shift to make it easier on himself, but Tony apparently took it as a sign that he was trying to get away, because he snarled and snapped at the air next to Steve’s head until Steve grit his teeth and slumped down, letting Tony take what he needed from him.
And yes, that’s true, but Tony already knows how much Steve gets … caught up in his doctor visits, and he doesn’t want to give him the impression he only asked him out for his medical degree. He genuinely likes Tony, more than he should probably at this point, but he has no plans to try to stop.
He noticed Steve twitch out of the corner of his eye, and Tony could just imagine him waffling on whether or not to offer his help, because it was Tony after all, but still,
I have committed fluff.  There’s no excuse for this.  *hangs head in shame*
Yeah.  He thinks he really should’ve known better, too.
Tony flinched and started a pained, soft howling.
He let the material hang from his hand. “Excuse me, ma’am, but . . . I thought this was just going to be a routine physical.”
It was different, however, to hear it from Stark himself; to realize that even if he were joking, Stark could envision the two of them pressed together for an entirely different reason.
“I did.”
More pain.
Surely Tony wouldn’t have asked if he weren’t at least somewhat interested. Not when he could order Steve to go to his room and take care of himself if it were just because of his body’s needs. The fact that Tony wanted to see—even if he didn’t participate—it had to mean that he still wanted Steve. Even after everything.
It wasn’t that Tony had ever been
Steve was crying.
, and for once it’s his heart and not his loins that melt into a puddle of goo. There’s no reason for Tony to lie about that, because it has to be painfully obvious that Steve’s a sure thing, like do not pass Go, do not collect $200, just go straight to Tony and sit on his dick like Steve’s been wanting to do for years now.
-----
Lightning cracked the sky, and Steve blinked several times in order to clear his vision, imagining for a second that he could see a face filled with regret in the fading lines of light.
“I think I would just cut the wire,” Tony said, and this time, Steve was certain there was something in the way Tony answered that signified something more, although he wasn’t entirely sure what.
I have written chapter 2!  It's much shorter than chapter 1, but still, progress!
"Fine, fine, will you
Instead he said, “You know what?  The penthouse isn’t even that big.  I’m sure you can find your own way around,” before leaving, being extra careful to ensure that their bodies didn’t touch on the way out.
Where had the defiance gone? The anger? The fight? Captain America didn’t give up, didn’t know
“No,” Tony said, leaning forward. “He’s
and process what Steve was saying instead of just reacting, he had to put space between the two of them.
“Are you alright, Steve?” she asked when a few minutes had passed and he still hadn’t moved.
I wasn’t necessary at the Compound, Tony.  There was nothing I could do except guard duty, and considering the outposts keep Them back, it just meant standing around, doing nothing.  That’s not the type of person I am.  I can’t stand back and let other people get hurt for me.  Please understand.
“Please, Steve?” he asks, and he’s not above busting out the puppy dog eyes, which he reserves for just these kinds of special occasions.
before snuffling against Steve’s head.
“See you in a few minutes,” he said and went to clean up.
. He wasn’t strong enough for that. “Can you tell me—” He stopped, the words becoming stuck in his throat, and he swallowed desperately. It seemed wrong to talk. It
So, so grateful, Steve reminds himself as he looks down at his bed, which definitely won’t be seeing any use other than sleeping today, because he and Tony are being good and getting to know each other.
It’d be over soon, and then Tony would turn back into a human. Steve could bear with it until then.
Still, Tony couldn’t have known that he’d wake up, could he? Steve could’ve been out for the night, and then what would Tony have done? Woken him up? He frowned. It was a distinct possibility. Or Tony could’ve slept in another room, he supposed. There were several empty guest rooms, and he knew that Tony also had a bed in his lab. But . . . surely Tony wouldn’t have put Steve in his bed if he hadn’t wanted him there.
“Please, please,” he whispered.
And then he’d realized the irony of that thought, and the anger had shrivelled up in shame.
“Alright, why don’t you lie back, and I’ll examine your chest.”
Okay, so I left an A/N in Nostalgia AU AU, so I'll leave one here as well. I can only work on updating one fic at a time, so what I'm thinking is I'll work on updating the fic that gets the most comments/kudos when I post a chapter. I mean, I'll still try to update the other fic as well, but it won't get as much attention. But this way I'll know which fic readers are more excited about, because the more you guys are into a fic, the more I want to write it. And I won't say that Nostalgia AU AU is winning right now, but...
“I should’ve known you didn’t want me that way—”
“I shouldn’t have been so careless, I guess. It’s too bad, because you’re a lot like him, in your own way,” Tony says regretfully, and then there’s the anger, a raging fire that does nothing to warm the frigid wasteland of his heart.
He pushed down the unreasoning disappointment that Tony hadn’t somehow magically
A few more minutes, and he’d be done, he thought, noticing his breathing was coming faster but unable to stop it. He could put up with anything for a few more minutes.
His Angel gets sweeter and sweeter the higher up his thighs Tony’s tentacles go, and his suckers are actually catching on his Angel’s skin from pressing so hard. It’s torture, but he wrenches his tentacles away before he does something he regrets.
“What?” he asked faintly.
I totally...forgot about the "Get Well" portion of this, so... What can you do.
“Okay, Tony,” he said finally, his shoulders lowering slightly, not far, but enough for Tony to pull himself up to his feet, although he had to lock his knees to keep standing. He made himself take even breaths, counting slowly to try and calm his racing heart.
“Well, I was always planning to make orgasms a reward for doing well,” Tony said, confusing Steve for a second because why would he—
"There's a pony?  Where?  We should call Animal Control.  Wait, they might try to take the Hulk, never mind, bad idea.  Over," Tony says, and Steve already knows he's not going to win this, doesn’t seem to win any of these bouts with Tony, but it never stops him from trying.
“And while I’m sure the sex would be fantastic—I mean, when I started debating all of this, I thought about all the things I’ve been wanting to do to you,” Tony said, his eyes turning dark for a second as the tip of his tongue touched the corner of his mouth, and Steve nearly shivered, “and I almost gave in.”
There were
Tony didn’t say anything, just blinked once, slow and heavy, and then his fingers went to the top of his jeans, undoing the button and sliding the zipper down, and Steve realized he was staring.
No Dom. He wouldn’t have to contract with anyone else. It was what he’d originally hoped for.
“Well that’s no surprise considering how long it’s been since you’ve eaten,” Steve said disapprovingly, but he gave Tony the sandwiches and water.
And maybe that’s true, but why do they have to work quite
Of course, it had stopped being a prison soon enough, and Steve had chosen the same room when he’d come to Tony again, because the good associations had far outweighed the bad, and staying there had felt more like a continuation of what should’ve been then starting all over again. Nevertheless, when he’d first moved into Stark Tower, when he’d been angry and frustrated at everything and everyone, he’d spent hours staring at the ceiling, at the bottom left corner of the painting to his right, at the horizon outside his window, all while wondering how much longer he’d have to stay with Tony before he would finally be allowed to leave.
It was obvious that he didn’t know who the hell Tony was, which was vaguely insulting, but nothing he couldn’t forgive considering the guy had been frozen for the past seventy years.  Although he’d been awake for months, and one would think he’d know Tony’s face by now, what with all the magazine covers and news shows he’d been on recently, but whatever.
“Moi? I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
What he ended up doing, however, was lying in bed and staring at the ceiling. It was about a nine hour flight back to New York, but with the time difference, he’d see Tony that afternoon.
There was the longest pause, and Steve thought he might’ve heard Tony swallowing, but he couldn’t be certain over the thudding in his ears. “Is she?” Tony said, his voice sounding strange. “Well, I wouldn’t want to keep SHIELD waiting now, would I? I’ll take it in the lab, JARVIS.”
“JARVIS?” He started to tense, wondering if he could reach the cuffs—cuffs and
him like he wasn’t even there. He was vaguely surprised by the irritation that crept up on him at the thought.
It was equally obvious that Captain America was having some sort of problem in his pants, and Fury had wanted to send someone to relieve the issue, but Cap was against the idea for some reason.
They also taste
He’d practiced the speech tens of times because he’d kept having to pause at certain moments to collect himself, and while he knew that he had to be the face of the world’s gratitude and loss, he refused to break down and make a spectacle of his misery. So he’d practiced and practiced until he could get through to the end without a single misstep, and all that repetition meant that his mouth formed the appropriate words without him on the day itself.
It gets infinitely worse when he puts his legs in the stirrups, when he’s spread open, the sheet barely a nod to modesty, and Dr. Stark stands in between his thighs in his damn pristine lab coat, all too gorgeous and impossible to look at. Steve doesn’t know if he’s been this turned on even during a heat, and it’s mortifying how much he’s looking forward to Dr. Stark putting on his gloves, but it’s one more drop in the sea of humiliation he’s drowning in, and he breathes and breathes and promises himself he isn’t going to orgasm as soon as Dr. Stark touches him.
And many thanks to all the people who’ve left kudos and comments. It means so much to me. Thank you.
that,” Steve said, even though he was barely paying attention to what Stark was saying. He just wanted to get away, and maybe Stark realized that, because he jerked his wrist forward, and Steve found himself falling forward until he was on all fours above him, the pull on his wrist like an undertow, dragging him further and further away from the safety of the shore.
When he’d moved, it’d seemed reasonable to only bring clothes and those few items that he actually cared about since Tony’s place was already furnished and decorated. Tony had told him to bring more, but there hadn’t seemed to be much of a point. They were just
“You’re just saying that so you can have first pick for yourself.” Tony winked. “Sneaky, but it won’t work. No one should stand between a man and his breakfast pastry.”
“JARVIS,” he grits out, and wow, he is so hard right now. “Do not,
“See you tomorrow!” he called, slamming the door behind him and leaving Steve’s apartment that much dimmer in his absence.
Okay, maybe a
.  “We do alright,” he said, his voice brusque.
Okay, okay, fine, not all Omegas were bad news.  Happy was an Omega, after all, and Tony considered him family.  But then, Happy was Bonded, which meant that like the vast majority of Bonded couples who were deliriously happy in a kind of creepy, plastic Barbie-and-Ken type of way and who always smiled at each other and looked blissfully content, he’d likely stay that way.  Less than 1% of Bonded couples wanted a Breaking—each and every case highly publicized in the news, because something like that just wasn’t supposed to happen—and even with the endless specialists and hospital stays and various drug cocktails, some Bonds couldn’t be broken no matter how hard both parties tried.
Tony’s faceplate lifted. “What’s up?”
bad,” he said, and Steve had to resist the urge to tell him that as long as Tony forgave him for real, it could be as bad as he wanted it to be.
failure
Didn’t Tony have the right to know how he felt, though?
It wasn’t a conscious decision, but he found himself breathing hard and squirming in order to get out of the way of whatever it was that was
He made a sound of protest when Tony drew all the way out, but Tony said, “Shh,” and pushed his mouth toward his testicles. “Suck,” he commanded, and Steve did, licking and sucking in between gasps of breath, burrowing his face in between Tony’s legs and taking as much as he could, his cheeks and chin wet.
They were annoying. The weight, the distraction, the glimpses of fake fur out of the corner of his eyes. The thing that bothered him the most, however, the thing that made him want to yank them off before Tony could even finish adjusting them, was the fact that Steve knew he had to look comical with them on.
If only Steve didn’t want it so much as well.
There’s no response.
He let out a long breath, feeling like a battalion of butterflies were attacking his stomach.
Trapped?
“They want to automate … pap smears?” Steve asks, confused, because that seems cold and somewhat dehumanizing, and he can’t imagine how anyone would think that’d be a good idea.
“How is which doctor I see any of your business?” Steve demanded, and Tony wilted a little bit.
Yours,

For the anon prompt: Stony, misunderstandings
He knew that Steve wanted him to fuck him. He didn’t think Steve realized just how obvious he was about it, even if he didn’t come out and say the words directly, and in the overall scheme of things, it didn’t mean a lot—while simultaneously meaning everything.
“Every day, you tell me one thing you want. Can be big, can be small, but it has to be something. For today,” Tony said, letting his exhaustion roll over him now that the conversation had been gotten out of the way, and hell, how was the day not over yet, “unless you already have something else in mind, you can tell me what you want to eat for lunch. I’m starving.”
had passed since Tony had closed the restraints.  “I can’t take anymore.  Please.  Now.”
“Why let dying and then coming back to life ruin a good thing?” he said and glanced away from her to smile and wink at Steve, which had no right to send his heart into palpitations since it wasn’t Tony (but what if it was?), but it did anyway.
Tony had assumed Steve didn’t
Well, that was too bad then, wasn’t it?
Steve is his apparent favorite.  Tony can spend hours on his lap, purring all the while and hissing at anyone who gets too close.  Steve tries to lecture Tony on the importance of sharing, but it doesn’t seem to take.  Tony just stares at him, unblinking, and then flops on his back, meowing for cuddles.  Steve would like to say he resists Tony’s blatant manipulation, but truthfully, he folds each and every time, rubbing Tony’s belly and possibly cooing at him and saying embarrassing things like, “Who’s a sweet boy?  You are; yes, you are!”
Steve’s cock, causing Steve to bite at Tony’s lips as he trembles all over, and the rest of his tentacles go crazy as a result. The ones on Steve’s chest increase their suction until Steve whimpers pleadingly and scratches at Tony’s back, and then and only then do they let go, just to latch onto his nipples and do it again.
“Good afternoon, Steve.”
Steve never had to deal with being a sickly, ninety pound weakling and flirts with Tony as easily as breathing, while
He slowed down after that, however, drawing out his lunch until he would’ve had to lick the crumbs off his plate to get anything else and Steve was pushing his stool back to get up, and it was only then that he finally managed to force himself to blurt, “I think you should choose a safeword.”
“What do you do in your free time, Steve?” Dr. Saunders asked, and Steve wondered if she knew how difficult a question it was for all that it seemed so simple.
“C’mon, Steve.  When do I ever ask you for anything?”

in front of him, no matter that it clearly wasn’t a formal bonding collar, made his heart clench so painfully that each successive heartbeat swept the ache further and further along his body.
Fuck it.
Not that Tony had believed him.
“You should take a nap; otherwise you’ll scare your parents when you land.  You know how you get when you’re tired.”
“What happened?” Steve asked, his voice a whisper.
He’d done what he’d needed to in order to keep Bucky safe. But.
“It’s your excuse for not calling me, but it’s not important? JARVIS, what’s Project Insight?” Tony asked, staring him down, and Steve didn’t know how much JARVIS would find out since it’d never been mentioned in the news, but considering how easily Tony had hacked SHIELD’s servers before, he’d bet he didn’t have much time.

“It’s okay,” Tony whispered, over and over again, as if saying it would make it true, as if the proof of how wrong he was wasn’t coming apart in his arms. “Shh, shh, don’t cry. I’m—”
Not that Steve hadn’t already known that, because he had, but it was different seeing Tony without his heavy metal band T-shirts or one of his business suits. Or the Iron Man suit, for that matter. He was much more muscular than Steve had given him credit for, with heavily corded arms, a thick chest that Steve had always assumed was due to the arc reactor but really, really wasn’t, and strong thighs. Tony was just
“No, don’t look like that, no, Steve. I’m not—you’re doing great. You’re not doing anything I don’t want—well, there’s one thing, but that’s my fault.” Tony reached out to cup his cheek, and it made Steve tense, but just until he felt the warmth of Tony’s hand against his face, and then he was melting into the touch. He closed his eyes for a second, biting his lip to keep it from trembling.
, Tony,” he said, flushing and looking down.

But as Tony dimmed the lights and settled down like they were actually just going to sit there and watch a show, he wondered if Tony’s plans included making him wait until he was ready to claw his way out of his own skin. If so, it wasn’t going to take long. Steve knew that anticipation made things better, but he was already so keyed up that it was starting to feel like torture. And he knew, he
,” Steve gasped, but then
When Steve tensed, he hurried on to say, “We don’t have to say you’re my Sub—it might even be better if we don’t, since I know your identity is still a secret, and it’ll be incredibly fishy for Tony Stark to get a new Sub and then for Iron Man to suddenly start showing up places with Captain America. You could always be my new assistant maybe, but we can figure out the details later. SHIELD and I still have to work on setting up a fake past for you—”
And although Dick would never say this out loud, Bruce could also count on Clark not dying before him, and he thought that went a long way to helping Bruce lower all his carefully-erected walls.
“How do you accidentally tell someone you’re attracted to him?”
He doesn’t mean to stare up at Dr. Stark, but he can’t seem to tear his eyes away as Dr. Stark … as he … as his
“Do you want to say anything before we get started?” Tony asked, his eyes searching Steve’s.
Dr. Edwards had explained that because of the placement of the uterus, omega males’ prostates tended to be higher in the body relative to alpha or beta males’. That meant a knot wouldn’t constantly press against it, but it also meant it was more difficult for doctors to examine them digitally. Dr. Edwards complained about needing longer fingers a couple of times, and Dr. Stark—
Oh, he’d rationalized it at first. Steve was on the run. Steve was finding out who the real traitor was. Steve was protecting him by keeping the spotlight off of him. Even as SHIELD had come in and ransacked his home, Tony had told himself that Steve hadn’t had any other option.
He wonders what it’d take to build a suit that could carry him up into the air to be with Steve.
“But I have extremely high clearance,” Tony said, letting his jacket fall to the ground to join the tie.  “How else could I have gotten to your room?”
Clint and Natasha had . . .

that someone needs to have sex with Tony,” Dr. Strange told him, sounding annoyed that he had to repeat himself, as if Tony weren’t currently a wolf, standing six feet tall at the shoulder. A little bit of clarification wasn’t too much to ask for.
And following up on that thought was the realization that he relief he felt wasn’t based on the fact that Stark had stepped in, but that Stark had
For a guilty second, Steve thought he was talking about his research on
that Tony was giving him the chance to make it up to him. He’d wait for hours if he had to, if it meant Tony would be happy with him.
“Well, then,” Captain America said, sounding surprised, and Tony couldn’t blame him, because if he’d come across Steve Rogers in a club somewhere, he would’ve snatched him up so fast, there would’ve only been a
He was hopeful, however, that Tony would invite him into his bed that night—although maybe Steve would take the opportunity to ask instead. Of course, there were many things he’d like to ask for. Maybe he should get Tony to clarify rule six for him. It’d been so long since he’d set out his list that Steve wasn’t sure if he recalled it exactly. Had Tony said he needed to tell him one thing he wanted every day, or
.  Not that Fury seemed to care about that, oh no.  Tony Stark was a loose cannon.  Tony Stark couldn’t keep a secret (
He took comfort from that feeling, wanted to hold onto it, except as the hours ticked by, he found himself thinking about Project Insight again and again, about what it meant for SHIELD, for the world, and he just became … tired and disappointed and
People didn’t stay with someone who had made them bleed like this, whose stupid, thoughtless actions caused this much pain, no matter how much they loved each—how much one person loved the other. They shouldn’t.

he was reacting, why he was thinking about it all, because he’d never—
“But y-y-you’re
Steve saw how he started to raise his arm as if to lay it across Steve’s shoulders but checked himself mid-motion, using the momentum to gesture out the floor-to-ceiling windows instead. While Stark touched him all the time—hitting or defending or trying to get him in some sort of hold—it would’ve been only the second time Stark had ever tried to touch him in friendship, the third if he counted when they first met. Steve didn’t know which surprised him the most: that he’d been keeping track, that Stark respected his boundaries, or that he almost wished Stark had gone through with it after all.
“Say what?” Tony asked, sure that he hadn’t just heard what he thought he’d just heard.
“What is it that you owe me?” he asked, point blank, so that Tony couldn’t play any more word games.
“It really doesn’t bother me,” Dr. Stark says kindly, although that can’t be true, not when the scent of Steve’s slick is hanging heavy in the air and Dr. Stark can no doubt feel the racing of his heart under his hands. “Okay, I’m going to move on to the next part now. Ready?”
vigorous, or his partner is supremely well-endowed.
He’s going to find out.
And Steve had shaken his head, one brief turn to the side and back.
Fuck.
Steve takes his time getting dressed, wiping at the inside of his thighs and his buttocks and lower back in order to get the worst of the slick off of him. He puts paper towels on the step so whoever comes in to clean will know he left a mess there and then tidies up as much as he can. His thoughts are focused on Dr. Stark the whole time. It’s not really different than usual, but what is different is

“Steve, you …” He looked away for a second. “If I were the best kind, then you wouldn’t be here, on your knees.”
“Tony was good to me,” he said and left it at that.
“Before what, Joe?” Steve asked when it became clear Joe wasn’t going to say anything else.
It didn’t look like any kind of home Steve had ever been in.  No matter what Stark said.
Tony enjoyed sex in all its various forms and couldn’t say that he had a particular favorite, because there were advantages to handjobs, just like there were for blowjobs and frottage and penetration. But Steve wanted it
He’d known that like many mammals, wolves had a bone in their penis, but knowing was different from experiencing, and he sobbed as Tony’s unnaturally hard cock battered away at his insides, growing thicker and thicker. He’d been right that the stretching beforehand hadn’t been enough, and his hole
“Mmm, that’s nice,” Tony said, as if he somehow knew how Steve’s body was reacting—
He couldn’t worry about that right now, however.  He had to get them out of wherever it was they were.  And then turn Tony in.
“Yesterday was more … intense than I’d intended. At least, I assume so. Maybe it wasn’t. Maybe you thought it was boring, hell, I don’t know,” Tony said, and Steve didn’t mean to duck his chin, but it happened before he was even aware of what he was doing. He heard Tony let out a long sigh. “Yeah, I thought so.”
Tony waved his hand dismissively. “As long as the door isn’t locked, you can stop in whenever you want.”
—peered down at him.
Still, it was a relief that Steve seemed more adventurous than that. Just how much more was yet to be seen. He couldn’t imagine Steve as being too hardcore, but stranger things had happened. Whatever Steve wanted to try, though, Tony was more than willing to do—there wasn’t much that fazed him, even if he didn’t get off on all of it. What he did get off on was turning his partner into a mess of sensation, and no matter what Steve eventually asked for, he’d do, because better it be him than someone who wouldn’t have Steve’s best interests at heart, who wouldn’t take care of him half as well.
It’d be a lie, though. Steve wouldn’t say he’s particularly noisy when he comes, but even with his hand stuffed halfway in his mouth, there’s no mistaking just how much he enjoys what Dr. Stark is doing to him, his moans guttural and all too loud as humiliation and pleasure roar through him.
“Would you mind,” he said, breaking his gaze for a second, “if I got on my knees?”
to know, but this isn’t the kind of conversation he can have over text–especially if he wants to keep his job–and this meeting is supposed to run for another forty minutes at least. He’s never wanted to be a smoker before, but he’s starting to regret his life decisions.
“So how are we feeling today?”
“Good boy,” Tony said, and the surprise of hearing those words made Steve’s breath stutter in his throat.
After a moment, she said, “Christmas is coming up.”
Such a good friend, that one.
“Thank you,” Steve gasped, his hips thrusting forward in order to chase a firmer grip—only for Tony to move away.
“Hello, Steve. I’m Dr. Reynolds,” the man said, a Dom from his bearing, and he addressed Steve and not Stark, although he didn’t offer his hand, and neither did Steve.
Except … then brunch had happened, and Steve might not exactly have a lot of experience in this department, but he had to understand the significance of having Natasha and Clint over and being that open about their relationship.
He squeezes his thighs together and bites down on his lower lip, but it doesn’t help, it doesn’t help at all, and he feels like a whole minute goes by of Dr. Stark watching him squirm as he tugs and tugs and tugs, but he knows it’s just the humiliation warping his sense of time.

“I could’ve handled it! You didn’t have to—I would’ve been fine,” Steve said, as if he weren’t convincing Tony he’d made the right decision even more.
If Steve were stronger, he’d pull away. If he were a better man, he’d refuse to take advantage of Tony’s forgiving nature and would suffer through all the discomfort his body caused him.
“You know what?” Tony said before Steve could respond. “It doesn’t even matter that you don’t know the number. All it means is that we should figure it out.”

Last night had been … bad.
Tony was facing the door when Steve entered the room, his tail wagging and ears perked up. He started bounding up to him, but as he got closer, he stopped, his ears going back, his lips curling in a way that conveyed more confusion than anger.
Also, why is this fic so long??? Why, why?

you’d return.”
Steve paused mid-step as Stark started following him out of the waiting area, obviously planning to come along, and he and the nurse, Sara, both halted as well, looking at him like they were wondering what the hold-up was.
“Why did you want to see him?”
It was strange sitting together and eating when everything was still so unresolved between them, but Steve was grateful for the time. It helped to see Tony’s face fill with a little more color and watch him lose some of that unnatural tension, made it easier knowing that Tony would be alright after he’d gone.
Fandral referred to Loki as his “Blue Boy,” which, considering how long they’ve been at war with Jotunheim, was far kinder than Thor had any reason to expect.
“Go eat,” Tony said without looking away from what he was doing. Less than a week ago, he would’ve stopped, would’ve kept Steve company, because Tony believed they should eat their meals together when they were home, would’ve look at Steve with affection and told him funny stories to make him laugh, and Steve hadn’t considered any of it when he’d decided to not call Tony.
“For what?” he asks and wonders if he could play the “recuperating from a near-fatal bullet wound card” and pretend to fall asleep.  “You were just doing your—”
He opened his mouth, but nothing came out. Not one fucking word.
“I’ve
“I want to,” he said, forcing himself to sit up, but Tony’s hand on his shoulder kept him from rising any further.
Steve was so caught up in the story that when the first crack of thunder sounded, he startled, almost losing his place.  Seconds later, the lights went out, and he huffed, putting his book down carefully on the patio table and standing up in order to get his flashlight.  It ‘d be a waste of batteries, but it wasn’t like thunderstorms came through every day.
“You really shouldn’t worry so much, Steve. As far as embarrassing behavior goes, you’re not even in the running for first place,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve’s grateful that Dr. Stark isn’t looking at his face, his gaze flickering between Steve’s nipples as he checks for any … lactation. He knows Dr. Stark is going to eventually see just how revealing his expression no doubt is, but he wants to put off that moment as long as possible.
Was it just because he hadn’t suggested Steve give him one sooner? But that didn’t seem right. Steve wasn’t exactly timid, and surely he would’ve said something if he’d wanted one off the bat?
Steve didn’t let the silence linger. “I’ll do it,” he said, turning towards Clint and Natasha. He was the one who’d been with Tony when they’d been ambushed. He was the one who hadn’t saved him.
“Is that so? Then I’ll just have to try harder,” Tony said, moving back, his hand sliding around to Steve’s stomach, dangerously close to his trapped erection.
He hesitated when he was naked and Tony just stared down at him, wondered if he should’ve kept his underwear on, but then Tony shook himself and plopped down on top of Steve’s legs, pinning him in place as he started licking at his thighs and going higher, Tony’s tongue eager to explore.
Steve paused for just a moment before moving, slicking up his fingers. He went back down on his knees in order to make it easier to reach around himself, and taking a deep breath, he used one hand to hold himself open and then pushed one finger in, his thighs twitching.
“Why?” he asked in a hard voice, raising his head.
It was that thought that gave him the fortitude to pull back, his breath hissing out between his teeth as Steve tried to follow, sucking hard on the tip of his cock as if to pull him back inside.
over the summer. *happy screaming* I was in the middle of a crazy move, however, and couldn’t fawn over it as much as it deserved. It’s sooooooooo good!  You guys should read it and help me convince them to continue it! Moar chapters, moar chapters! <3 We all need more Dr. Stark in our lives.
He’s been briefed.  Death threats, corporate espionage, possible terrorists, the need for a bodyguard, blah, blah, blah.  He gets it.
“Took you long enough,” Natasha murmured as she leaned against the wall next to the now-open door.
They went downstairs to a secluded room off Tony’s main lab. It’d been locked the day Steve had gone down, but the door was currently wide open. Inside was—
“So are you,” Steve said breathily, and Tony grinned at the compliment, slid his thumb up so it was barely parting Steve’s lips.
She didn’t say anything, but there was an obvious “Do more” hanging in the air, and he honestly couldn’t say if it was coming from him or her.
Steve had to give himself a mental shake, adjusting his napkin to make sure his lap was covered, even though no one could actually see under the table. He had to stop doing that. Especially at work. SHIELD’s cafeteria was not the place to be entertaining thoughts of Tony.
Fuck.
“Yup, that sounds like Tony alright.”
Fuck, the sleep had helped, but his brain was running at a snail’s pace; he was nowhere near back to normal; it felt like he was a breath away from panicking; and there was no way he could handle any of it.
Steve stepped forward, picking up his things off the floor to unpack in his room, every brush of fabric and muffled footfall unnaturally loud in the quiet apartment.
He’s such a moron.
Tony let Steve slip out from between nerveless fingers as Steve sat up, watching as his mouth moved but unable to hear much over the cacophony in his head, only catching bits and pieces of his words.
“It stifles my creative spirit.  Next!”
It took everything he had to wrench his thoughts off that path, to shore up the walls that were barely holding him together. Later. He’d have time for that later once Steve was … once …
“I’m …” He could hear Steve struggle to swallow. “I’m okay.”
, it was fast and brutal, and Steve had just a second to think about Dr. Strange’s warning that Tony could rely more on instinct than thought, but then it was impossible to focus on anything other than the cock pounding into him.
“It wasn’t all fake—”
He’s gotten used to this body, being able to run without breaking a sweat, ducking whenever he walks under a low doorway, holding onto cups and pens and what-have-you with a soft and careful grip, it’s all second nature to him now.
“I’m not marrying you,” he repeated instead, trying to infuse the words with as much conviction as possible.
Sooo...it's been a while. >_>
“I don’t know that I’d call it a bad thing myself,” Tony said, undoing a couple of buttons of his shirt but keeping the arc reactor hidden.  He walked forward the few steps separating them, pleased when Captain America turned towards him.  Tony kept his eyes on him as he reached out, slowly enough so that his intentions were clear.  He could see Captain America’s Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed, but he didn’t try to stop him as Tony rested his hand lightly on his cock.  “Not bad at all.  What’s your name, soldier?” he asked even though he already knew it.  Still, while he wouldn’t mind saying “Captain America” in the middle of sex, maybe for their first time—first of many if he had anything to say about it—they should stick with the tried and true.
sniff of Tony’s shirt, even though it mostly just smells like him, and then wrap a spare towel around his waist and march back outside.
He thumbed the corner of his mouth, imagining Tony watching as he dipped his fingers between Steve’s lips, a tease before the real thing.
“But why not?”  And he’s not whining.  Yet.  He's still got a few tricks up his sleeve before he has to resort to the whining.
-----
Most of him, however, felt horrified and guilty for even thinking that, and it was just one more sign of how wrong he was for Steve, how selfish. How he couldn’t be the Dom Steve deserved.
“Alright. I won’t then. Do you want to tell me why? The option is still open for you to talk, so we don’t misunderstand each other again.”
thing sticking up under the seat was a dildo, he realized it was a fucking machine.
“I don’t like repeating myself,” Stark said in a voice that dripped dominance, and Steve’s eyebrows came up in surprise. He’d known that Stark was a Dom, of course, had even seen flashes of it under the lackadaisical exterior, but there was knowing, and then there was
“Oh come on,” Dr. Strange said as he steps through his portal, back from whatever dimension he’d been in for the past few months. “Aren’t you guys done with all your idiotic tests yet?” He turned his back on all of them in obvious dismissal. “It’s good to see you again, Stark. I meant to be here for your arrival, but I got stuck in—”
Steve gauged the distance as well as the number and location of the branches separating him and Tony, and he gave a quick prayer that the branch would hold his weight, before he ran along it’s length, leaping at Tony.
But the larger part was resigned to hearing every one of his mistakes, his failings, knew that he’d dwell on them again and again in the days ahead, knew he owed Steve his pound of flesh.
The walk to his place is … uncomfortable, although most of that’s because Steve honestly doesn’t know what to say. What
Captain America had said the “sir” that had done it, grudging and unimpressed, and damn it, Tony had always had a thing for the mean ones.  Pepper claimed it was because he had a masochistic streak a mile wide, but whatever.  He was proud of his kinks.  They made him the man he was.
Her eyes crinkle as she smiles, bright and wide. They both hear a crash in the back followed by a hoarse, “Did he just—?”
“I still want a punishment,” Steve said, and if anything, he sounded more determined than he had before.
, Steve thought, because it felt like their positions were reversed. He should be the one rubbing the shampoo into Tony’s hair; it should be his hands carefully tilting Tony’s head back as he started to rinse him off. Steve didn’t think of himself as an old-fashioned Sub, but it felt wrong to just sit there while Tony was doing all the work.
“Honor,” he said, rougher than he’d intended.
He wanted—
“Or, or Bruce?  Or Thor—yeah, okay, not Thor.”

“Okay,” Steve said and swallowed, eyes flitting up to meet Tony’s, just for a second, before he was staring at Tony’s jeans again.
part, and Steve doesn’t mean to get preoccupied by the idea of Dr. Stark shoving things inside of him, but come on, and the next thing he knows, Dr. Stark is setting up something over Steve’s torso, effectively cutting off his view of anything going on between his legs.
It couldn’t be.
Steve could feel his stomach sink, the feeling only worsening at the earnest but nervous look in Tony’s eyes. There were several things Tony could be talking about, but Steve knew without being told which one Tony was referring to.

But then, he had a history of making assumptions about Tony that turned out to be wrong.
But not anywhere near to as good as Tony’s fingers had been.
“You already know what I agreed to.” At his blank look, Steve said, “Even if you don’t want to sign a new contract, Tony, that doesn’t mean you can’t reference our old—”
“You’re not allowed to see Steve,” Tony said, and that was news to Steve. He wasn’t?
ETA: Sorry, but I forgot to warn for breath control play during a fantasy!
Steve didn’t lift his head, unsure if he had permission yet and knowing he wouldn’t be able to control his expression anyway. Orgasm was the last thing on his mind, no matter how eager his body. He hated the fact that Hill had called, had set back whatever progress he’d made over the course of the day with Tony. Why was Hill calling? What was—?
What in the hell? he thought, staring after it. Which was when he noticed the people walking past the alley, the cars driving by--
Tony’s not naïve enough to think Steve feels the same way.  He's exchanging money for a service when all is said and done, and while he likes to think that Steve’s enjoyed himself during their time together—actually Tony
Clark was pretty used to it all in all, and he’d smiled and been effortlessly charming and sweet and bashful, and if Dick hadn’t been a Superman stan already, meeting him would’ve done it and then some.
He looked down before Bruce could hopefully notice, and he placed his hand carefully on Bruce’s arm, leaning in to brush their mouths together. It was the lightest of touches, and even as he told himself that it was nothing, he knew he’d relive the moment again and again in the weeks to come.
Had he ever imagined what it’d be like to offer Steve one for real?
He shuffled up behind Steve.
“Yeah, see, I don’t own anything that could keep you trapped for long,” he said, at least, not yet anyway. He had some orders in. “Not to say you
“Steve,” Tony said, putting his hand on Steve’s arm, and just like the last time, Steve found himself flinging it away.
Maybe Tony had been taking things too fast. Or maybe he’d been taking them too slowly. Steve was in his early twenties—plus or minus seventy years—and what if he’d been assuming they were going to jump into sex? Tony knew he had a reputation, well-deserved at that, and it wouldn’t be the first time someone had been interested in him because of the things he could do for them. In Steve’s case, Tony had already figured out Steve was looking for someone to show him the ropes, and maybe he was getting frustrated by the speed they were going. Fuck, had he been worrying about getting Steve comfortable enough to hug him on his own when Steve had been hoping for a good beating and being thrown over the back of the couch?
“Yeah,” Steve breathes in a stunning display of intelligence, and fuck. The first impression he’s making by being late is already bad enough; he doesn’t need to make it worse.
“I’ll get up. If you get up too.”
Fuck, he didn’t want to deal with this right now. “Even if it means I decide to whip you?” he asked, closing the distance between them. “Or make you stand in the corner wearing nothing but your birthday suit until you fall down? Or dress you up in something pink and frilly and take all kinds of pictures of you?”
He could understand how the past week had made Tony doubt … everything they’d built together, but Steve wouldn’t be here if he didn’t care so damn much that he’d accept whatever punishment Tony threw at him for just a
So maybe that was what he should do when he got back, keep asking for things that mattered until Tony believed him, believed

me that you’d changed your mind about moving in with me instead of going through this—”
It made it so that he went to check in on Pepper and Morgan every week because it was all he could do for Tony now. He asked Pepper’s permission, of course, not wanting to add to her burden in case she didn’t want a reminder of the Avengers hanging around, but she seemed grateful for the company, for Morgan at least. He and she had never exactly been close, although they’d always been friendly with each other, and they would sit down to tea or coffee or share a meal together if he arrived late enough, but Morgan was always there, and they directed their questions more to her than to each other.
“I mean, sure, it’s unlikely,” Tony said, and Steve had to swallow back the shriek that wanted to rise from his throat as the vibrations got even stronger. “But we’re above the treeline, and with the way you’re moving around and how you’re carrying on, a person would

“These are attached with nanotech to the collar, so you don’t need to worry about them falling off.”
no excuse. But you have to understand that—”
The knowledge still made Tony veer wildly between amazement and disbelief, with flashes of giddiness and terror thrown in just for the hell of it and moments where he felt so fragile that he thought a single word or look from Steve would make him shatter like glass.
Did Bucky go through with the cyberstalking after all? Or is he just making this up in order to give Steve a kick in the ass?

“No, it’s fine. It’s my fault for forgetting my umbrella.” Dr. Stark makes a good point. He’s not going to be here long enough for his shirt to dry, and he
Steve hadn’t planned on using his safeword. Ever. And Tony couldn’t wrap his mind around that.
He does feel a little bad that Dr. Stark went out of his way when Steve’s not even cold anymore. He can understand why Dr. Stark might’ve gotten the wrong impression since he’s only wearing a sheet, he’d been shivering nonstop while Dr. Stark had been touching him, and his nipples are still so erect that he’s afraid they’re planning to stage a revolt. Nonetheless, he’s actually pretty warm from how riled up he’d gotten earlier and is getting warmer by the second as Dr. Stark shakes the blankets out, the fact that Dr. Stark noticed and did something to fix his supposed problem making Steve want to preen at how well Dr. Stark is taking care of him. It’s ridiculous considering Dr. Stark probably would’ve done the same for any omega on his table, but knowing that doesn’t change how Steve feels.
back then, he would’ve done it more.
happen, not in any lifetime. But his subconscious doesn’t believe it.
That didn’t stop him from stroking Tony’s hair with his free hand, though, and he could hear the regret in his voice when he said, “Tony. I have a mission.”
OMG, guys. OMG!
Although Steve’s sure that if he were to turn his head, he’d see Dr. Stark staring at the screen or one of the posters on the wall, giving Steve whatever small scrap of privacy he can.
He couldn’t even really say why exactly. Maybe because he didn’t want to embarrass himself with all of his inexperienced fumbling. In the weeks since they’d gotten together, he’d learned that Tony apparently didn’t have a gag reflex and could hold his breath for a dizzying amount of time, but when Steve had tried to practice alone with a banana, well, the end result had been him coughing on and off for almost five minutes, positive that there was still something lodged in his throat.
“A little bit more?”
“D-do I?” he asks and somehow his arms have gone around Tony
“What?  Yeah, no, it’s fine.  I just . . . migraines,” he said, because that was easier to say than explaining that he got headaches sometimes that came and went for no reason, sometimes weak, sometimes strong enough to knock him out, and they refused to respond to any drug, even the prescription-strength ones Doc had given him.
“But if I’d just said something when you—”
Oh fuck.
“So let me get this straight,” Rhodes said after they’ve finished rounds and rounds of debriefing and were sitting on couches surrounding Tony. Rhodes had retired as War Machine almost five years ago and been promoted to General, and while he’d had access to all of the interviews with Tony, he hadn’t been allowed to be present in case Tony broke free and tried to kill everyone. “Aliens
Tony wasn’t even naked. Although . . . there was something a little exciting about that fact, that Steve was just on display. That he could feel fabric and leather against every inch of his back and buttocks. That Tony had access to any part of him he wanted . . .
He rolled his head to the side to stare at the empty space next to him in the bed. Steve hadn’t bothered to stay. Although maybe . . .

“Please,” he says when Tony hesitates, his eyes searching Steve’s, and Steve doesn’t realize he’s holding his breath until it escapes in a rush as Tony begins to smile.
, he doesn’t know why it sounds so reasonable, but it does, and there’s no expectation of questioning or defiance, just simple obedience, and that’s what he does, he obeys, not even thinking about it until he’s in the middle of doing whatever it is Tony wants him to do.
“Yes,” Steve said, and it took Tony a second to comprehend he was responding to his question, but when he did, he immediately looked over at him. Steve, however, was focused on his plate and didn’t meet his eyes.
The edges of his face felt prickly and cold, and his limbs were weighted down with grief, heavier than stone.
after all—but I don’t scare that easily,
That opens up a new cornucopia of delights, the soft but firm texture, the gratifying way his tentacle can wrap around Steve’s cock, making it twitch and flex in his grip as he undulates against it, and the taste! Steve is a treasure trove of different flavors all over his body, and Tony wants to bask in every one.
“You have five minutes. JARVIS, mark the time,” Tony said finally, just when Steve was sure he was going to say no. Tony’s arms were folded across his chest, and he was still looking out the window, but at least he’d given Steve a shot at making things right, and Steve couldn’t waste it.

think … but of course, you would,” Tony said, his voice getting quieter. “After yesterday and after … I’m sorry,” he said, low and strained, somehow willing to take the blame onto himself, even though it was Steve’s fault. “I wanted to make up for … and I thought you’d want it, that you’d…”
Bucky’s safe with T’Challa, but Sam and Natasha are down the hall, and he knows if he knocked on either of their doors, they’d get up and keep him company. He also knows, however, that it won’t help. He won't fall asleep again for hours, if he manages to at all, and the nightmares just keep coming back. He hasn’t slept well in over a month. He’s so anxious about what he might see after he closes his eyes that he’s been going to bed later and later, and when he wakes up, he feels worse than ever, his body heavy and slow, his head aching.
feel?”
As if Tony leaving him weren’t going to break Steve more surely than anything else Tony could ever do.
“How far along is that? Am I going to be seeing the Stark brand in every doctor’s office next year?” he teases, wanting to see more of that expression.
, Steve thought, shivering, and he arched his back into a sharper curve for Tony.
Many, many thanks to
“I’m so sorry, Tony,” Steve said raggedly. At some point without Tony noticing, Steve had let go of him, and his hands were clenched tight against his thighs.
of all people, although he could take some small solace in the knowledge that Fury couldn’t be having any fun being there either.  But since Fury was acting as their Negotiator, it was his job to stay in the room in order to make sure neither party felt threatened or coerced.  Although how that worked when Fury was technically higher in the chain of command than Steve and was trying to sell him off like some kind of mail-order bride, Tony had no idea.  SHIELD wasn’t technically under the purview of the Army, however, so maybe there wasn’t a conflict of interest, or maybe it was the fact that it was Captain fucking America, and if anyone could stand up for himself, it’d be the guy who punched Hitler in the face over two hundred times.  Who knew really?
Not on accident anyway.
“All right, last thing.” Tony pulled what had to be the tail from the bag, the fur matching the color of—
“You weren’t?” Steve said and kept going.
He listened, though, to the accusing drag of Tony’s feet and the heavy slap of his hand against the bannister, and he was ready to throw himself backwards down the stairs if he needed to catch Tony.
asked him to do anything he couldn’t handle, but here he was, doubting Tony again. Fuck, he just wanted to be good. Why couldn’t he ever be good?
Maybe it was the shadowing.  A little too much on top and not enough—
“Good. They’re in town for a couple of weeks, and I was thinking we should invite them over.”
Steve didn’t know how that fact could’ve slipped his mind since he would’ve sworn he’d been tired but not
“I don’t need any help,” Captain America protested, but he shuddered when Tony’s hand touched his chest, and when Tony closed the door, he didn’t seem to notice, staring at him with eyes that were glazing over.

He’d never once, however, thought he’d hurt Tony this much.
He shuddered uncontrollably when Tony pushed inside, the straps going taut against Steve’s skin as his mouth fell open in a gasp.
She sighed, folding her hands into her lap. “Alright. Happy and I were talking, and you realize you’re going to have to top Steve, right?”
Steve can’t control his sudden intake of breath.
Stark wasn’t Peggy. And Steve had to stop blaming him for that fact.
Many, many thanks as always to MetaAllu who read over this for me and convinced me to add another 1,000 words. You rock, bb.
They’d never done much of anything together in public that hadn’t involved Avengers business. That had been for his benefit, Steve knew, Tony’s way of keeping the press away from him. Not that Tony had tried to hide him. Steve had free rein into and out of the Tower, knew the security guards and the people at the front desk by name. When he came in through the ground level instead of the parking garage, he used Tony’s private elevator. To anyone who was around to pay attention, it was obvious there was something going on between them.
The night he had come back. Tony absorbed the news, trying his hardest to keep his expression from revealing how devastating Steve’s answer was.
“Captain,” Tony said, and that was all. That was it.
“It’s been five minutes, Sir,” JARVIS said, and Steve jerked in surprise, his gaze flying to Tony.
“Just rinse off,” Tony said, standing so he was in the middle of the rest of the spray. “You already took a shower earlier.”
“What? Why not?” Steve asks, jumping over a rock in order to finish the guy before his health regenerates. Saturday mornings are for Trials.
“Shh,” Tony said again, and it made a shiver run down Steve’s spine. “Mmm, gorgeous,” Tony said when he pushed Steve’s clothes out of the way. He spent a moment looking, just looking, and Steve’s cock—dark red and already so, so wet—slapped humiliatingly against his stomach in reaction. Steve squeezed his eyes closed, but they snapped back open quickly when Tony touched the head of his cock with one finger, putting his other hand on Steve’s hip, keeping him in place. “You want it so very, very much,” Tony said as Steve shuddered, and there was no way he could deny it. “You should thank me for giving it to you,” Tony said, as he circled the tip, making Steve grunt, his hips jerking.
hide at this point, the robe barely even covering his shoulders with all the moving he’s been doing, the sheet against his stomach and under his cock. Steve is completely on display, and he feels exposed and defenseless and so turned on that he aches.
“I love you, and I’m sorry I ever gave you reason to think I didn’t,” Steve said, the words tumbling together and sounding like he’d dragged them across sandpaper, “but I do. I do love you, and I should’ve said my safeword, but it wasn’t better that it happened with you, because I
“I’m good,” Stark said, getting up quickly. He rolled his neck and squared his shoulders. “Keep it coming.”
It wasn’t that Steve had entered their contract with the idea of being . . . bad.
Ten minutes later, Tony was dying. It was worse than working out, than sparring with Steve without the suit, then going ten rounds against a zillion Doom Bots. The harder he massaged Steve, the more Steve liked it, the kinky bastard, and Tony was exhausted.
"Tony—"

. Look at it. LOOK AT IT. (assuming you're not at work as it is extremely NSFW) It makes me so happy. *sobs* It’s not a scene in the fic itself, but it might become one, because damn. DAMN.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” she said, because they both knew how much damage that would do in the current situation, but she said it kindly, recognizing how upset Tony was.
“While I would hope to avoid that eventuality, I am prepared to carry out my orders using whatever means necessary.”
“Do you have plans for the holiday?” she asked, and he sometimes wondered if she asked him questions just to hear him admit that he was a failure.
Apparently so.

“Don’t apol—
“You just what?” Tony snapped, when Steve didn’t say anything else.
“I said I wanted to do it without a Dom looking over my shoulder—”
because of someone he hadn’t cared about.
Word count: 729
But what it boils down to is that there is a teenage version of himself from an alternate reality running around, and he spends about eighty percent of his time hitting on Tony.
The sooner he and SHIELD felt Steve was ready for action, the better.
It’s nice to pretend for a while though.
“Are you going to stop me?”
“Speaking of Captain Rogers—”
“Yeah, I finished a project faster than expected,” he says and doesn’t tell him it’s because he’s been working through lunch for the last week. There’s nothing wrong with being productive after all.
“Good,” Nick said. “Then let’s get going. We don’t have much time. Grab whatever you need, and I’ll meet you two on the roof,” he said and headed toward the elevator.
Many thanks to the awesome musicalla on the mcu discord server (
“Alright, ‘honor’ it is,” he said and had to clear his throat. “Close your eyes.”
regret it,” he muttered.
“Did you?”
Maybe a little bit, Steve thought, remembering
I actually started writing chapter 8 and got about 2K into it when I realized I needed ANOTHER chapter to lead into the chapter I was writing. SIGH. So for anyone curious, I have 2K of chapter 9 written. Also, there might be some med kink coming up. *cough, cough* Maybe.
But Steve never had, no matter how many times he’d told himself he would. They’d reach some critical point in their relationship, and Steve’s faith would falter each and every time.
“Whatever you want,” Steve gasped, leaning against the table for support and making himself that much more vulnerable to Tony in the process.
“We’re going to talk about this later,” Bruce said, implacable, and Clark nodded weakly. “In the meantime, however, we’re going to take this somewhere a little less public and closer to the governor's office. I’ll explain on the way,” he said, taking Clark’s hand and leading him toward the side of the room, his thumb skimming against Clark’s skin in a tentative caress.
“I see that,” Tony said, and there was something in his voice that made Steve’s knees flex, made him want to fall to his knees and suck Tony’s fingers into his mouth. “Sore at all?” Tony asked, wet fingers making an idle pattern on the inside of Steve’s thigh as they inched up higher and higher.
most of that technology for them after all.
He angles away from Dr. Stark as he undoes his jeans, heart thudding and hyper-aware that means he’s going to be mooning Dr. Stark as he undresses, but there are no good options right now. It doesn’t help that his jeans are clinging to his legs, which means it’s harder to take them off and that he’s hunched over longer than he’d expected as he shoves his clothes down, but it’s not like Dr. Stark is looking at him anyway.
“Then don’t worry about it.” Stark had slid on a pair of sunglasses and smiled sharply. “I’m not going to put a collar on you that you don’t want.”
“Respect what? You were the one that walked away!”
“That’s right,” Tony said, slowing down and gradually coming to a stop, lingering inside for a few seconds before pulling his fingers out gently. “Just like that, Steve. You were perfect for me.”
But he can’t help it. Tony gets to him.
He let out a long sigh, rubbing his face.
“Good. Alright, I’m going to let you down now,” Tony said, and Steve could already feel their descent.
Tony blinked at him. That was … did that mean they knew about him and Steve?
thing Steve should hear was that Tony didn’t know what to do, was barely holding himself together because he was such a horrible Dom that he couldn’t even get this one thing right, couldn’t take care of the one person who—
Of course, that was when
“Thank
Tony hadn’t thought he’d had any more childhood illusions of his one-time hero for Steve to shatter. Apparently he’d been wrong, and he couldn’t even hate him for it this time, pity piercing him like a knife and leaving just as gaping a wound in his defenses.
“Do you … do you want to touch me?” Tony sounded uncertain. “You don’t have—”
Dr. Stark hums thoughtfully, and Steve finds himself leaning forward, as if to chase his hands as they move away.
“Ready?”
Of course Tony’s first priority would’ve been his family, so days before he’d shown up at the ceremony, he’d looked for the two of them. Only to discover that Pepper had gotten remarried three years ago.
They finally told us today.  I swear I didn’t know before, Tony, I swear.
Stark twisted and turned, going faster and faster as he showed off, until Steve finally yelled, “You’re crazy!” the words forced out, but it was better than the yell that had wanted to escape, far better than giving vent to the emotions that had surged forward before Stark began his wild maneuvers.
He turns towards Tony’s voice without answering, and Tony takes one look at his expression and sighs, long and low.
doing?” Steve asked, folding his arms across his chest.
It’s not the first time Steve’s come on Dr. Stark’s table, his breath trapped in his throat and his back curved off the table, and it’s probably not going to be the last.
Maybe it’d be better if Tony didn’t forgive him, he thought, even though the very idea made it feel like his chest was going to cave in. The thing was, Steve’s answer hadn’t changed. He wanted Tony, wanted to spend his days and nights with him, wanted everything he could get, and the fact that Tony had to ask, that he didn’t

It flustered Dr. Reynolds as well, who said, “Dr. Fury explicitly stated that I was to check up on all aspects of Steve’s health, including—”

“What do you think is more important? The way something starts, or the way it ends?”
Maybe, he thought, staring down at his cock which had seemed to acquire a mind of its own, Tony had been right about his minimum changing.
“You have to be so quiet then,” Tony said, lowering his voice to a whisper, until Steve could just hear him over the mechanical hum. “So still. Can you do that for me, baby?” he asked as the vibrations went up another notch.
“I just—I just worry about you, Tony,” she said, her hand tightening around his.
He thought about the last time he had cause to be examined, and he grimaced, turning away from the memory, more for what had happened at the end than the beginning. It had been a turning point for him, when he’d first started thinking he might be able to trust Tony.
He let out a sigh at the look she gave him.
He hung the shower head back up and angled the other ones away so he wouldn’t drown, and then he got down on his knees.

It wasn’t Tony touching him, but Steve still grabbed onto it like a lifeline.
“You can ask JARVIS. JARVIS!”
“I’m sorry,” Steve said, sounding embarrassed.
“Come on, Steve, come on,” Tony whined, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder and looking up at him pitifully.  “Can’t you do this teeny tiny favor for me?”
He froze mid-bite when he realized he was actually thinking about their previous tense quasi-relationship with a sense of nostalgia, and seriously, what was his life?
“I’m fine,” he said and stole one quick glance at the two of them, Mr. Martin’s head in his Domme’s lap. They’d been held captive for almost five months by a terrorist group called ARES, only allowed to see each other once a week as long as she continued to do work on the biological weapons ARES was interested in. She’d resisted initially. Her husband had paid the price.
“May I touch you?” Steve asked quickly, not ready to be dismissed, not wanting to lose the press of Tony’s hands and mouth when he’d just gotten them. “I want to touch you,” he said, changing his request, because he’d never realized how powerful the words “I want” could be until Tony had taught him.
