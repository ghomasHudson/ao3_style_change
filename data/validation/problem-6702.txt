“Fuck no,” Tony spits. “You think I’m going to tell four-year-olds how unhappy I am in our marriage. Children aren’t idiots, Steve. They see things; they hear things; they sense things. They can see that we’re not normal, that we’re not like other married couples, that we don’t spend any time together.”
He can see Natasha in the cell, sleeping on the rough cot, rolling back and forth over the mattress in what is clearly a disturbed sleep. A long shadow slides across the wall.
When he’s safely inside the walls of his chambers, he cleans up as best as he can with the flask of water that sits on his table. He wipes off the sweat, the blood, the come that is leaking between his legs, all of it – it doesn’t help, doesn’t make him feel cleaner than he is, but it makes him stop feeling the sensation of Grant on top of him, and for now, that will do.
His eyes find Steve, who is busy fighting a legion of Outriders, Thor’s hammer in one hand and his splintered shield in the other, and Tony thinks,
“You don’t win wars with niceness, Doctor,” Phillips says, solemnly, grabbing one of the grenades. “You win them with guts.”
James clears his throat. “Does this mean you’re okay with me being part of your family?” he asks, almost afraid to put the question out into the open.
Wanda’s eyes narrow. “You know, I’ve always been really curious; you’re the bottom in the relationship, aren’t you?”
He walks out of the pub into the cool night, his breath curling like smoke in the air. He rests his back against the brick wall of the alley, his eyes closed, and then, there’s a body bracketing him there. He knows by scent who it is, and when he tips his head up, Steve gives him the kiss that he’d been wordlessly asking for.
“Okay, okay, uh, chilli oil, soy sauce and vinegar, twelve dumplings, either half-serve pan-fried and half-served steamed or full-serve… uh–”
Stone swings around, and Steve punches him hard enough in the face. Stone goes down like a sack of bricks.
Tony doesn’t see him often anymore, not in the months that followed the kids’ kidnapping and everything that happened after that.
“Well, baby, if I have to wear this dress, I’m afraid you’re going to have to wear this suit. You look very handsome in it, you know?”
“Because what, Tony?” Steve pushes. “Because what? Because I’m breakable? Because I’m sickly? Because if you touch me a little too hard, I might break.”
Tony reels back, confused, certain that he’d heard wrong. “What?” he says, his voice breaking around the word.
Tony’s hand grips at Steve’s shoulder, and he kisses him back firmly, their tongues tangling, before he pulls away.
“I mean, she seems like a very nice… uh, a very nice person?” Steve says, awkwardly. “If you were looking for conversation, or anything else really, I’m sure she’d… uh, be willing. After all, looking like you do and talking like you do–”
Steve perches on the edge of the couch. “I hope you know that I’m not sitting down because you told me to,” he says, stiffly.
He holds his other hand out expectantly, and Steve and James both take it, happy enough for him to lead them towards the staircase, which is where he stops and turns to them.
The mine car jumps, bounces and spins around, then slides to a stop in a cloud of seed at the edge of the water.
It’s also weird, because he always thought he’d have a Hindu wedding when he finally settled down, but he and Steve had compromised on the ceremony, so that it would be half-Catholic and half-Hindu, so instead of wearing a tuxedo, like Steve looking oh-so handsome in his black tux, Tony’s wearing Sabyasachi.
A hand curls around Tony’s ankle, yanking him into the bushes. Tony goes down with a yelp, and the branches scratch at him through his night clothes, but then, there’s a familiar face hovering over him, a grin splitting Steve’s face in half.
And then, while Tony’s just standing there, as his heart starts to rend into pieces in his chest, Steve starts to pack his bags, and then, the children are crying as Steve tells them that he still loves them, that he’ll come and visit them, but he has to go now, and the kids are asking him why Daddy’s leaving and Tony doesn’t know what to say.
Steve nods, a smile playing across his mouth. “Yeah, you, uh, when we were kids, we used to go to this bakery-”
“He’s tight,” Steve manages to say, through clenched teeth as a wave of strain ripples through his body, through all of that wired-tight muscle. “He’s fucking tight. It’s like he’s gripping me like a vice.”
He rips open the box, and inside is a row of audio cassette tapes and manila folders stuffed with glossy photos and paperwork. Steve helps him pull out the contents of the box.
“I know what he is, and I know what you are now,” Steve says, bluntly. “I know that you used me, that you’ve used me all these years, that you made me out as a mark in that bar, and made sure you were taken care of, right?”
Their scents are mingled in the air, thick, cloying, strong, and Tony sits up, pulling him close, kissing him hard.
Tony reaches out and pats him on the hand. “You don’t know how much that means to me,” he says, quietly.
“Did I stutter?” Tony demands. “Out! Out! We’re closed! Do your killing outside! And don’t leave any bodies on the porch!”
And the sad thing is that he does; he has Rhodey, he knows that, he’ll always have Rhodey; before James and Steve and even the kids, he had Rhodey, but Rhodey isn’t here; Rhodey is somewhere else, flying combat missions, and Tony is stuck worrying that one day, he’ll get that inevitable call from someone in the Air Force to tell him that Rhodey is dead, Rhodey is gone from this world, and he won’t even need the call because he will have known, he will have known in his heart that Rhodey was gone.
“Well, if you need anything…” Sam trails off, his voice resolute, and Steve knows that Sam doesn’t believe him, doesn’t trust that everything is okay the way that Steve would rather pretend it is (Sam was an audience to so many pining sessions when they were on the run that he’d never make the mistake of underestimating exactly what it was that Steve felt for Tony).
“And you didn’t… why the fuck didn’t you tell me?” Steve demands, his face contorted into visible, visceral grief. “Why didn’t you tell me that our kids apparently had this shit view of me? I could’ve… I could’ve changed things, fixed things.”
But the urge turns to nothing as quickly as it ever was something – Grant was right; no one would ever believe him, no one would ever think he was the victim in this situation; no one would ever look at an omega and a dead alpha and not think that he had not done
“My God,” Tony drawls, and then, flips them while Steve is distracted, so that he’s the one straddling Steve’s hips, knees on other side. He kisses him. “Now, I know that I’m going to enjoy the next seventy-two hours.”
“Well, either you’re wrong or Schmidt’s damn near rewritten the laws of physics.” Tony turns and moves towards his lab. “And I’m rather fond of the laws of physics.”
Steve stares at him, eyes wide, shocked, his scent a little stilted and weak, presumably from his poor health.
Tony pockets his wallet with a scowl. “You know, you might be the most annoying person that I’ve gone out with.”
“Is something wrong?” Steve asks, sensing the hesitation that mars Tony’s heat scent. “Did I–” He winces. “Did I do something wrong?”
The words make Tony’s chest hurt, but he ignores it, shoves it away, and he looks down at Steve’s face. “Where would I go?” he asks, rising and falling down on his cock.
Six weeks later, after Tony is released from the clutch of his medical professionals, Steve comes to him at his new lake house, and all he’s missing is the hat that he’d be holding in his hands, when Tony opens the door.
He doesn’t even blame Steve, of course; an alpha who had never been with an omega, had always been disdained by the omegas around him for being
, there’s the book fair, and Appa’s gonna come and buy us all the books, and then, Appa’s going to take us for ice cream, aren’t you, Appa?” he looks at Tony, expectantly.
“General Patton has said that “wars are fought with weapons and won by men”.” Phillips’ eyes travel across the line, landing on the alpha from the fair, and his frown deepens, as he directs a glare in Abraham’s direction. “We’re going to win this war because we have the best men... and because they are going to get better.
A vindictive glee rises in Tony. “You look disappointed,” he says, clucking his tongue. “I like that. How does it feel?”
“In my world, they are,” Tony says, wistfully. “In my family, we didn’t deal with imperfection very well.”
“Yeah, you wouldn’t be in the picture otherwise,” Maushmi says in a tone of voice that makes Tony think that
Tony twists around in horror at the same time the killer makes a grab for his face with his knife-fingers. He instinctively throws himself back, hitting the ground, before he scrambles back, scrambles to his feet, and runs like hell.
“Hi, Tony,” James says with a little, hopeful smile on his handsome face, as handsome as it was when Tony knew him as a seventeen-year-old in Cambridge.
Steve pulls out his heavy, hard cock, pale and long between his fingers, the head beading with pre-come. Tony sighs, tilting his head forward, and Steve’s free hand works its way into his hair, threading through the strands, and gripping a good clump of it against the scalp.
“I haven’t since I had the kids,” Tony sighs in disappointment. “I didn’t want to be a bad role model. The frat boy didn’t stop there, of course; he just kept going. He really must have been so wasted, and he got real close like he was about to start a bar fight and asked, ‘what’s your problem, man?’, you know, in that surfer drawl, like he was expecting Steve to side with him, cause, you know,
He has two choices here: in one universe, he goes and helps James, James, who loves him and who he loves in turn, and who is so formative in the person that Tony is today, and saves him from some too-nosey secret intelligence agency which wants to stop James from doing only good things (and maybe, maybe, he has fallen into a rut; maybe, as much as he hates himself for even thinking it, maybe fatherhood is not enough for him; maybe he doesn’t get as much pleasure sitting at home and taking care of the kids and fulfilling their every desire, and only getting a chance to reframe the future, change the world, when the kids are sufficiently fed and have been read all their stories and are finally in bed or when they’re at school and someone else’s problem; maybe helping James is an escape hatch he’s been waiting for, the chance to be a part of something great, something special, as he had been back in Cambridge all those years ago; maybe it’s what he wants and needs in his life right now, not more of the same, but something different –
“I do, though,” Steve replies, unbearably soft, and Tony abruptly feels like going boneless at the reassurance. “I do worry about you.”
Tony turns around and pales in a rush when he sees the braided black leather bracelet that Steve’s holding between his long, pale fingers at a distance like it’s made of poison.
Rhodey is the last, and that makes sense too, because Rhodey had loved Tony first and probably even loved him best, had stood by him through everything and fought with him and protected him and saved him, and maybe years ago, Steve would have been jealous, would have resented the bond that Tony and Rhodey had, but now, he’s just glad that Tony had Rhodey, even when Steve himself wasn’t there.
Steve snarls. “It’s good of you to stand there and throw it back onto Natasha, when you’re the one who’s caught red-handed in these photos.” He picks them up and waves them at Tony like he’s daring him to deny them, deny their existence. “Let’s forget for a second whatever ulterior motive that Natasha might have had when she gave me these pictures; are you denying that it’s
“Did you make yourself pretty for me, Tony?” he asks, his voice like silk, as he undresses himself and climbs onto the bed. “It has been so long since we have been able to do this. That bitch Natasha hasn’t left you alone at all; in fact, if I didn’t know any better, I would think there was something untoward happening between you two.”
Tony waits with bated breath, as Phillips exhales, running his own gaze over Steve, lingering on Steve’s ruined shield.
“I hate to interrupt, but we should get out of here,” James interjects, his voice quiet, his mirthless smile gutting Tony and spilling his insides out into his lap. “I don’t know…” he trails off, looking somewhere else. “I don’t know who else would’ve heard this, and I don’t know who else is coming.”
“I know that too. So do I,” Tony replies, flatly. “You have no idea how much I want to protect them or how much I do that already. One glass of wine is nothing for me. You know what my tolerance is like. And frankly, if I was really interested in endangering his children, or being a shitty father, I’d have downed some Prozac instead. I’m sure I have some stashed in the back of our closet or something.”
“Sorry for bothering you. I’ll let you get back to whatever you were doing,” he says, quickly, and hightails back to the car, something anxious fluttering around in his chest.
The two of them run off, and Tony grabs his wallet and his keys, checking his emails quickly. As expected, there are around sixty-two emails in his inbox, not all of them requiring any pressing attention from him, but still ones that he’ll have to go through at some point, as well as work on that new line of anti-virus software that needs to go out to R&D for testing sometime this week.
His voice is barely above a whisper, warbling on the edge of hysteria, like Tony’s hand is the only thing grounding him to this earth.
Summary: In 1939, Tony Stark's bar in Bangalore goes up in flames when his ex-lover, Steve Rogers, comes looking for an artefact that belonged to his father, and before he knows what is happening, he finds himself joining forces with Steve to foil a Nazi plot to find the fabled Syamantaka Gem, rumoured to ensure that its bearer would never encounter any calamities and would always be full of prosperity and plenitude, before they can use the gem's unbelievable powers to turn the tide of the war in Hitler's favour.
Tony peers at him. “You’d be about the same age. James… James, what do you remember from before HYDRA had you?”
. Sometimes, he expects me to give him… him orders, and his arm hurts, the metal arm, and it hurts him, and he’s scared to get help, like he thinks he’s not supposed to be hurting. He refers to it as
“Kitchen,” he instructs and leads the injured man towards the place in question, forcing him to sit on one of the stools.
James scowls. “All they’d have to do is put a paper bag over your head and take you to some undisclosed location and shoot you between the eyes.”
Tony hits a button, and the hood and panels retract, releasing a blast of steam that must have been trapped within the device. When it clears, there he is, or there someone is, a new man, hanging in the straps, tall, more than six feet, muscular, skin taut and glistening, his head resting against his chest, eyes closed.
Tony bites his lip in anticipation and climbs onto the sheets. “On my hands and knees, on my back, on my stomach? What’s your poison, handsome?” he asks, coyly.
Tony nods. “That’s what he told me, that SHIELD was looking for him, watching him, and he needed my help to throw them off. So, I started helping him.” He looks away. “I never really lost that, you know?”
“I just can’t do that, so I’m going, I’m going to find them. You can… you can tag along if you’d like, but I can’t stay here.” He takes a look at Wanda, and the guilt twists in his chest like a bright, living thing. “I’m sorry,” he whispers. “I’m so fucking sorry. Thank you, thank you for everything.” He shakes his head. “Let’s go.”
“He was one of them, yeah. He asked me to help me deal with them, and I agreed, because I… James told me bits and pieces, not everything, but enough to make me sick to my stomach, and I hated the idea of anyone still thinking that he was with HYDRA, especially with everything they did to him,” Tony says, venom leaking into his voice. He shakes his head. “That day, though, the day that I visited James at his apartment for the first time, because of how long my conversation with James took so long, I was late to pick up the kids from school. When I made it there, Steve had gotten there first and picked up the kids. He was… upset, upset that I hadn’t picked them up, hadn’t been there at home when he brought the kids, and because they didn’t know where I was.” Tony looks away. “That’s where the problems really hit their tipping point, I think,” he muses. “And then, a couple of days later, James showed up at house. He was bleeding, bleeding heavily. He’d gotten into a fight with some HYDRA goons, and I patched him up. He left his bracelet on the sink, and Steve found it.”
“Perhaps,” Tony agrees – it would be unfair if he doesn’t give Steve that much, “but I didn’t know that until tonight. After all, what alpha would side with their defiled omega over their own sibling. No, it is not done, and I could not be sure. So, I did not say a word to anyone. I was glad for your intervention, though, as unassuming as it was; it gave me some brief respite from Grant’s unwanted attentions.”
“I hate you for this,” he says, coldly. “This is all your fault. I wish you’d never come back into my life.”
Tony rushes over, bringing Steve his clothes, and he stops right in front of him, swallowing thickly as his mouth goes as dry as sawdust.
“Okay, fine, get to fucking, then, while I get myself ready,” he orders. “But go slow, Steven, considering that I don’t think he’s had anything up in there for a while.”
“Get it gassed immediately! It has an important cargo to take out!” a Nazi that Tony and Steve recognize from their earlier dealings shouts at the mechanic.
“No, no,” Howard says, sternly. “I don’t want to hear it. I know you’re going to say something to try and change my mind, and I’m not having it.”
“It’s completely inappropriate,” Howard retorts. “An unbonded omega to head out with the United States army like some fucking showboy. Do you have any idea the things they would say about you, about
“Great.” Tony runs his tongue over the seam of his lips. “So, while he still has his ability to speak, would you mind…?” he trails off, pointedly, gesturing in the direction of where Loki was being kept.
Tony’s cock is hard between his legs, curving against his belly, and Steve neatly avoids it, before he decides to focus all of his attention on it. He curls a hand around the base, and Tony lets out a low whine in his throat. Steve strokes quickly, firmly, his eyes hot on Tony’s, and there’s a pressure building low in his belly. Tony fists his hands in the sheets, the tendon in his throat going taut against his skin, and his mind is hazy, the fire spreading from his stomach into his fingers and toes and his throat.
There’s a knot in his belly, hot and sweltering, as he makes his way through the corridors of the castle, until he comes across the door to Grant’s chambers. He raps his knuckles on the door, tapping his foot impatiently, until it finally opens, revealing Grant on the other side.
There are tears in the bedsheets from Tony’s nails and strength, and Steve’s voice is strained now, as he pushes forward, Tony’s body rocking forcefully with the force of Steve’s thrust.
Tony stretches like a cat and feels something spasm in his lower back, spiralling up into the nape of his neck, and he takes the hand that Steve offers him and is pulled to his feet, hands grasping Steve’s forearms to keep him steady.
“Sweetheart,” he says, and Tony’s throat unexpectedly tightens at how raw, how wounded his voice sounds, “sweetheart, I’m not going
“You won’t let me down, will you?” he asks, quietly, leaning in close so that he can press his brow against Steve’s. “I mean, a whole lot might depend on it.”
At least he now avoids Tony like the plague, cringes away from him like the mere touch from Tony will set him on fire or give him some incurable disease.
Tony shoves him away, his fists planted on James’ broad, muscled chest, and his eyes find Steve, his look almost deranged, wild, on the edge of madness.
Maybe things would have been very different if he’d been brave enough to speak with Steve before everything got as bad as it did.
For love and lust, perhaps honour and duty is the price to be paid; to have an alpha like Steve Rogers, like Captain America, perhaps that is the omega he needs to be.
tell her. So, I’m pretty sure that’s all of your issues just dealt with, right? Did I miss anything?”
Steve touches his cheek, just his fingers, like he’s terrified that Tony will push him away (he wants to, he thinks he should, but Steve isn’t like his brother, Steve is kinder than his brother).
“Okay,” Tony sighs, smoothing his hand over their hair. “So, you know what you have to do, then, don’t you?”
Coulson stares back at him. “We knew that Miss Romanoff would contact either you or Mr. Rogers sooner or later. We wanted to ensure that we got a dangerous person off the streets. Rest assured, your father consented to this.”
And James is standing right there, and there’s dead bodies lying a few feet away, and his heart is thundering against his ribs, because he’s confused, he doesn’t know what to do; he loves Steve, and he’s never stopped loving James, and he thinks they love each other, or at the very least, Steve loves James and there’s something there on James’ side as well, judging by the look that they shared back at Tony’s house and those
from us and used it as their mark of genocide; if this gem is used to kill people, Nazis and Allies alike, whomever the bearer doesn’t like, it would be the same thing all over again. We, my religion, my culture, my gods, they would be used to hurt people, and that is not what we are about, Colonel. I couldn’t let that happen, so I pushed the chest into the ocean. You can go looking for it if you want, but something tells me it’ll be much harder to find this time.”
“Tony, uh,” Steve licks his lips as he steps fully into the bedroom. “What is… what is this? What are you wearing?”
“We should, uh,” Steve’s voice is rough, gravelly, the words grudging, “we should take him away from here.”
“Bucky is…” Tony looks between James and Steve. “Bucky is Steve’s best friend; they grew up together, back in Brooklyn, and then, Bucky joined the army. He… he disappeared while he was on tour, didn’t he?”
Steve kisses him again, and Tony moans, hand curling in the lapel of his coat. “You’re gonna have to tell me where to go,” he rasps.
James closes his eyes like Tony’s words are a blow to him. “You never have to thank me for any of this.”
“Enlistment lines have been around the block since this hit the newsstands. You don’t take a soldier, a symbol, like this and hide him in a lab,” Brandt argues.
He finds her in the living room, reading a book, her skirt riding up her knees, her legs up on the sofa.
The ‘something’ that he puts into Stone’s drink is fast-acting, and before Steve can even blink, Stone is off his face drunk, stumbling around, slurring at everyone. The security guards exchange a look about who’s going to deal with this guy, and instead of escorting him to his room, they take him to the elevator and push him inside.
Peter starts shivering again and crawls into Steve’s lap so that he can seat himself fully. “I was so scared, Daddy,” he says, solemnly, as if Steve couldn’t possibly be aware by now.
Dr. Bruce Banner is standing there, and Tony actually likes him, because he doesn’t treat him like a child, never patronising.
“I… I came to see you, because you did not say a word out there in the yard,” Lord Steven says, pale eyes fixed on him. “And then, when Lord Stane and I disappeared off into his solar, the discussion occurred between us and you were not involved.”
Tony takes a brave step forward. “Your loyalty was supposed to be to your family,” he says, stonily. “Your loyalty was supposed to be to your husband, your children, not some seedy intelligence agency that would’ve seen you get blown up in fucking Kandahar and not given your corpse to the people who actually love you in this world.” He shakes his head. “You proved that you don’t give a shit about me, about our kids, about this family. You have lied to me at every opportunity. You didn’t have to do that.” He blinks away the dampness that enters his eyes. “You could’ve told me the truth at any time, and you didn’t, because it didn’t serve your purposes. It
“I said I wasn’t going to kill him, so I’m not going to fucking kill him.” James makes a face. “Even though you deserve better, and at the very least, I should fucking beat his face in for having some fucking side piece while you sit at home and treat him like a fucking king.”
things, Tony. I would’ve made it better. I would’ve… I would’ve fixed everything, and I would’ve been
Three weeks later, there’s a terrible argument between the three of them, in private, of course, when Peter declares his decision to learn ballet along with his sister. Steve’s not in favour, of course, not because he’s some closet misogynist or anything, but because he’s terrified of what they’ll do to Peter for choosing an extra-curricular activity like that, when he already stands out: the son of a billionaire, having three gay parents and being smarter than 99.95% of every other child his age, but for his sister.
Steve pulls out the transponder, which is shot to pieces. “Sorry, couldn’t call my ride,” he says, slyly.
Tony bangs his head against the sheets. “Steve, Steve,” he whispers, his voice rasping like dragging stone. “Steve,
“I should tell Steve everything, shouldn’t I?” Tony says, wearily, wrapping his arms around himself, as the idea rebels against it. “I should have a conversation about everything, about this woman, about his secrets, about his late nights and his conferences and his secret phone-calls. I should tell him about James, about what I’ve been doing with him.”
. Sam moved back in, almost immediately, but we lived in separate rooms. To the outside world, we were still together, still happy, still perfect, but on the inside, within the four walls of our house, we were doing homework. We were talking in monosyllables, and once a week, we attended a therapist’s office, and we talked about our feelings. We talked about my brother and his death and how I was dealing with all of it, or rather how I
“But we can’t do it without bullets and bandages. Without tanks and tents. That’s where you come in.”
“At the beginning, I guess… I guess I was scared how it would look,” Tony admits, honestly, wringing his hands together, dread dropping line stone in his gut. “I thought… I thought if I told you, you’d think there was something going on between me and him, and there
His heats are regular, of course, every month, at the beginning of the month, three days of bleeding, three days of an aching emptiness. And each month, he’d dreamed of what it would be like to share a heat with an alpha, to have something fill him in the way that his body craved, to have a warm, strong body pressed against his, easing the cramps building inside him.
Steve doesn’t hesitate; he slides the knife across his throat, from ear to ear, slicing him open, so that blood gushes out, drenches his front. He digs the knife deeper until he’s cutting through the brainstem. Stone chokes, blood dribbling from his open throat and his mouth, out of the corners. Steve watches him with interest, watches him struggle to breathe, to keep the blood still in his body, and smiles when he fails.
apology. So, I just… I need you to know that I’m sorry, not only because you got hurt by my actions, but that I did that to you in the first place, that I kept that secret from you. I was… I wanted to think that I was protecting you from something that would ruin your life, but the only person I was really trying to protect was myself.”
The cars are all gone from Stark Manor when he reaches the driveway, and he’s glad for that, because he doesn’t want to have this conversation in front of other people.
“Steve,” Tony says, desperately, his mouth falling open, red and bruised and slick, his brow damp with sweat. “Steve, don’t
“I told you, he didn’t like it when he came home and I wasn’t there and he didn’t know where I was,” Tony says, bitterly.
“I don’t think you’re a dancing monkey.” Tony shrugs. “I think you’re making the best out of a bad situation. That’s all anyone can ever do.”
him. He wasn’t always my favourite person, but I didn’t mind him. We invited him into our home, around our family, around you. You, you
“You knew who I was that day in the park. I know you met the Winter Soldier before that. I’ve pulled CCTV footage from back then. I know you were together back then. I know he used to fuck you back then too. Has this just been some long fucking game, then? Did he peg me and point you in my direction? God, have you just been letting this asshole
Poor, stupid, desperate Tony, always looking for someone to love him, having the temerity to think that two men, two good, decent men could possibly love him.
His knot swells, splitting Tony open, and Tony makes a sharp, high-pitched noise against Steve’s skin, damp with sweat. Steve clutches him, breathing hard like he can’t quite get air into his lungs, like he still has asthma.
“You can’t be here,” he stammers, laughing nervously. “You can’t. This isn’t… My kids are right inside.”
Steve sits on the couch, his hands folded into his lap, primly. In front of him, on the coffee table, is a yellow envelope and a gun.
“Why not? I mean, the pieces fit. The fact that you were visiting him and spending so much time with him, the fact that you were disappearing and lying to me, and I thought, maybe he is fucking him, maybe he is cheating on me, but maybe he’s also trying to screw me over in a whole different way. Maybe he’s been working for HYDRA this whole time, and I’m just a fucking idiot.”
He leers at Tony when he sees him working, eyes scraping over him like Tony was a piece of meat or the kind of omega that one finds at a brothel.
She retrieved her hand and started to sit next to Steve. She took a few moments to tidy her black dress in order to make herself comfortable on the grass.
was about to die. Steve had this look on his face that Tony remembered seeing when they first met. It was as if he was this lost puppy with nowhere to go and nothing to live for. He didn’t know
I, Tony? I can’t live anymore… I just want to go… it feels like I was already dead.” Broken words were whispered through his tightened lips, so quietly that Tony thought he did not hear them right. But he knew he did. This was his Captain, broken, torn apart, damaged.
In complete peace, he asked for Steve. Steve’s name was avoided in all the previous conversations. Tony thought it was funny to keep his teammates walking on thin ice, so he let it play out for as long as he could. And now he finally ran out of time.
Sorry for the delay. I know I promised but mid terms came crushing on me and I got very stuck. This will be a short connection chapter and more will happen in the next. Which should come soon enough. Thanks.
“Thank you,” he said to Thor and gave him a big hug, “thank you all.” He smiled gently, “can we have some coffee together if you guys have time?”
for him. It was then he was truly surprised, because not only everyone currently on the team but also Dr. Banner and Thor were there.
As soon as he heard, Steve felt needles shooting through his blood and brought across his entire body. The voice was raspier than he remembered but he knew immediately that this was his Tony. He could still hear the same kind of love in Tony’s voice as he called his name. This was when tears uncontrollably broke out of Steve’s eyes as he held onto the mirror as tightly as he could. He knew at that moment Tony still loved him. This was
“ I love you too Tony… I miss you, every day. I can’t stop thinking about you and I can’t stop seeing you everywhere I go. It’s like one moment I forgot that I… killed you and the next moment reality hits and I feel like the whole world is collapsing around me. I’m so tired Tony… I don’t think I know how to live without you, I don’t know how to live with all this blood on my hands.
The moment Steve stepped out of the elevator; he heard a heated argument coming out from the communal area. He already turned left and began waking towards his destination before he stopped in the middle of the hallway. Supersoldier serum did not seem to work very well these days but he thought he heard his name brought up in between sentences a few times. He managed to walk a few more steps before deciding to check it out. Although all he really wanted was to go to Tony and his bed and snuggle Tony’s pillow. Sometimes he could still get scents of Tony from it if he was lucky. That could maybe get him at least a couple hours of sleep.
Steve slowly rose up and put his shaking hands on the door handle. He pushed open the door with nothing but fear. He knew that he could no longer live his life pretending Tony died without losing all the love he had for Steve.
.” Steve had turned from weeping to just quietly shedding tears. Tony could almost see peace in his face, resolution. Fear rose in him more than he ever felt in his life, even more than when
What felt like days was only mere seconds when he eventually arrived at the table. The mirror was laying only inches away from his fingers as he reached out his hands. Then he saw the blood on his hands again. It was just like that day when he tried to touch Tony’s soulless face as he laid on the ground in the snow, but he could never reach. He considered running at that moment of course. But he had been running since the day he sent Tony’s head crushing on the ground. Running from Natasha and Buck because they were the witness of his crime, running from the team because of the turmoil he caused by starting this war, running from Tony’s funeral because he was a coward. This was
He saw Steve’s face, defeated by such obvious guilt and regret. His eyes were almost unrecognizable as they were drowned in eternal sadness. Tony could feel vapors slowly clouding up his eyes and words clotted in his throat.
Potts quickly turned to him with what seemed to be surprise in her eyes, and soon she smiled again and turned away. “What have you done wrong?”
He stood up and wanted to look at Tony one last time. Then it finally came to his realization that he already
Tony started screaming, “Steven Grant Rogers you listen to me damn it! Look at me!” Steve’s blurred vision started focusing on the mirror again, but pain still surrounded him. “I know how you feel Steve, I was tired too… and I let you…” Tony did not finish his sentence but Steve knew exactly what he was talking about. “I gave up and I regrated it. God I regret it so much and I would give anything to go back to that day, to just hold you tight and tell you it’s okay, we will work things out. But it’s too late and now we have to let go no matter how much we want to hold on. So please, Steve, please keep loving me and missing me every day. If you’re dead then none of this mattered, our love didn’t matter. Do you understand? I love you Steve, do you understand that?”
4 years later, and I finished this. All these movies came out and well, end game happened. Treat this as a feel good piece, Tony's death was not the end of our love for him. Cheers.
He kept on walking towards the black flat stone towering in the middle of the cemetery, until he reached a seemingly endless pit. He knew Tony was lying in there lifelessly, and there was nothing he could do about it. He stopped at the rim of the pit. So that was it, right? A Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist, Visionary and an American patriot. Yes, Tony had always been a visionary. That was why the war had started in the first place. He wanted to prevent Ultron from happening again. He wanted to prevent a civil war between heroes.
Steve sat down on the couch next to Natasha with a coffee in his hand, Tony’s favorite. For now, he just wanted to sit and laugh with the people he had left in his life. He still did not know what he would do tomorrow but right now his heart was filled with love. And Tony gave him the courage to keep walking.
Steve did not go to his funeral. He did not want to; and he could not either. Every time he thought about the person he used to hold on bed, all he knew now was that there would not be one anymore.
. For once, Steve wanted to love and see the world around him as Tony did. His Tony loved so bravely and lent him all the courage to keep loving in this world, a world without him. “It’s okay Tony, I’m here. I will always be here for you and you will always be here for me. We’re never alone, Tony.” Steve said with a shaking voice. His judgement was over but he still needed to repent. This was the only thing he could do for Tony, the one last thing. He needed to be there for him. He finally understood what he had done wrong this entire time since the war started. All Tony needed was for him to be there.
“ Steve, I love you. I did and I always will,” Tony smiled softly even though he knew Steve could not see from the other side. Steve pulled his face up from his hands, his eyes full of disbelief and stared into the mirror. Tony could see the blue slowly returning in the Captain’s eyes and the weight in his stomach gently lifted. “There wasn’t much to explain on what happened that day, both from me and you and there isn’t time. God knows how much I want to talk to you more… but that’s a privilege that I no longer have,” Tony said as there was only a small beam left hanging above him. What looked like a full moon from the beginning now looked only like a far away star. And there was not enough time in the world for him to tell Steve how much he loved him.
.’ He would say the crack started after Ultron. Sure, Ultron was a mistake that Tony made and he was too stubborn to admit it at the time. But Steve knew exactly why he made that mistake. Tony used to scream at night and babble random phrases. But there was one that he particularly remembers the most, “
“ Yeah.” Steve did not know what to say. He did not know what he could do so that he could provide the minimal solace to this broken woman. He was so broken as well. But he understood why she was saying this to him. When someone met a loss so great, there was no way to not see it everywhere. Potts did not have superhuman vision, but she still easily spotted the mansion miles away.
Death was a strange thing, Tony thought. All the anger, fear and betrayal he felt when he was alive now seemed so trivial. At the final moment of his life, or rather consciousness, Tony only wanted to fill his heart with the love that he created when he was alive. It could make him feel just slightly better in this scary, cold darkness. This was when he heard his team member’s voice. He looked up and saw this circular shape of light shining through him like the most gentle full moon. Then he saw his teammates’ faces. Many heart-felt words and tears later, he noticed the light had been getting smaller and smaller. He was running out of time, and there was still one last person he had not seen. The most important person in his life.
“So,” Clint broke the silence, “I would do the honour then. Long story short, would you want to speak to Tony again, Steve?”
him. At the moment of death, Tony was furious. The minute he realized this man who used to lay besides him, who drew his pictures when he was asleep was really going to kill him, despair washed through him. Tony remembered raising his arms to defend out of instinct but only
As he decided he could no longer run away, as he was too tired to keep running without Tony, he calmly picked up the mirror. His gaze was so intense that he almost burned a hole through it, but it was still black. Complete darkness on the other side of the mirror. Immense terror swept through him because he thought Tony was gone. He thought he missed Tony once again.
The mirror cracked unannounced, and the darkness disappeared. Steve saw his reflection in the broken mirror and he saw that he could not hold back his smile even though his face was overrun by tears. He put the now just a regular mirror down, closed his eye, and let out a long-held, forgotten breath. The last bit of fear, guilt, and regret was let go along with this breath and vanished in the air. He stood up and headed for the door. That was when he realized he was alone in the room. He did not even notice when they left. He opened the door and saw his teammates outside. He did not know if they heard what Tony and he were talking about. But he looked at all of them with his clear eyes like he always did before the war.
“ I…I thought I would give anything to have Tony by my side before the war. Turns out I could not even give my belief…” he corners of Steve’s lips started to lift up a little bit as well, from the mockery he put against himself.
Steve’s enormous hands were shaking involuntarily. He tried to force himself to pick up the mirror. But he could not overlook the blood in between his fingers and palms. The blood was invisible to the others but never to Steve. He retrieved his fingers tentatively and withdrew his glance from the mirror.
Steve stopped his thought immediately. He felt like sinning just by remembering his lover. He knew the moment he hit Tony in the head with his shield that he did not deserve to even think about Tony in that way anymore. He slowly slipped down the tree he was hiding behind, and just sat there. He stared towards nothing. Then he found out that from here, Tony could look over the entire Los Angeles. He could even see his mansion in Malibu. He suddenly could not help the sense of satisfaction rising from his stomach because he knew how much Tony hated confined space. At least from here, he would not be scared,
Clarity started coming back to Steve. He just could not believe after everything, after beating himself up for so long, Tony never hated him.
He dropped Jarvis into the completely black pit. Then he turned around and started walking back to the tower. He did not say a word to the grave. He knew Tony would laugh at him if he found out he was talking to a lifeless body. Against the bright light that California’s night was radiating, the strong straight back that had always been carrying the weight of the shield appeared hunched.
Steve forced a slight smile on his face, it was the ugliest thing Tony had seen on his Captain’s face. Uglier than the day he smashed his shield on his face. He still remembered that last moment of his life vividly. After all, it felt as if it was only minutes ago because he remembered his world suddenly went silent, and tranquil. The next moment he woke up in this complete darkness. Tony was confused at first, lost. He did not know what was happening, but one thing was painfully clear to him and he knew without anyone telling him. He knew he was dead. It was this natural feeling in his stomach, just like he knew the theory of relativity. The feeling of anger and betrayal quickly washed through him, then pulled away as quickly as the ocean tide pulls away from shore. Tony chuckled as he felt tears running through his face. It was pit black around him and he could not even see his own body. But he felt the warmth of his tears and chose to ignore how cold and dead his body should be by now.
Steve’s eyes widened. He could not speak a word; he could not come up with any thought. He simply stood there and stared at the mirror. He was one mirror away from Tony, whatever that meant. He could never have fathomed such a chance for himself.
Steve slowly walked out of the tree in the dark. He was already stepping out his left foot when he seemed to suddenly remember something. He looked around cautiously, making sure he was with Tony alone, making sure no one saw him
It was the same determined but calming voice that brought him out of his confusion after he killed his lover. He slowly corked his face up as he heard Natasha calling his name. She did not open the door as if she knew he was leaning against it on the other side. Her low voice sneaked through the heavy metal and she asked,
Despite Tony’s usual witty remarks, Steve could see the soft smile on Tony’s face even though the other side was still pit black.
Steve quickly opened his eyes. He could not breathe. He tried to gasp for air but something in him hurt so much, it was like when he was still tiny. It was a long time before he could breathe calmly again; and the grass under his right hand had long gone lifeless.
He heard the sound of flowers dropping. He put his head into his hands, hoping he did not have superhuman hearing. He knew they were going to seal Tony with eternal darkness soon, and he was so afraid.
“ I believe that was the least I could amend,” said Thor. That broke Steve out of his daze and he ran towards the table. He finally got a better look at the mirror. It seemed like a fancy but ordinary mirror at first. The brown casing had added to it a scent of otherworldliness since no one could really tell what kind of material it was. But one would find that the mirror did not give any reflection when one looked more closely. It was as if the world was
“Tony wanted Jarvis to be buried with him. I asked Vision to repair it a little. He would want you to give it to him.” Potts said with that still smile. Steve started to think that it was the practice of her job, or else everyone
Tony, the Tony who had a bigger heart than anyone Steve had ever met. He loved so bravely that nothing else could come between him and the things he loved, the people he loved.
The closer he got to the room, the better he heard them. They were Natasha’s and Rhodes’ voices. He presented himself to the room before he could make out any useful information from the argument. The conversation was cut silent by his appearance. They all turned their heads together and looked at him with this eerie glare in their eyes. That startled Steve and he stayed at the entrance. He could not put a word to it, but it was almost like they were feeling
Steve wondered since when he and Tony started to drift apart. He knew without the slightest doubt that he loved Tony dearly. He still remembered the way Tony used to look at him in the eyes and tell him that there was nothing bluer than those eyes. It was the moment after the war that he realized he never had those eyes Tony admired. What an irony that Zemo was the one to point it out. Tony just saw him in his own way; Steve was never the person Tony saw him to be.
The moon was slightly brighter now. He could see it peeking out from behind the clouds. He laid down on the grass to the right of Tony, finally closing his eyes. That was exactly where he slept next to Tony on their bed. It was the side closest to the window. He remembered seeing the exact same light when he still had Tony’s faint snore echoing besides him.
“I love you, and I’m not going anywhere. I couldn’t drag myself away from you and our kids, even if I wanted to,” Steve swears. “You have me, Tony. You have both of us. You’re stuck with us, in fact, couldn’t get rid of us even if you wanted to.
Steve is staring at him, his face streaked with blood, both Obadiah’s and his own, stunned, but then, he surges to his feet. He grabs Obadiah by the scruff of that ratty, filthy sweater of his, and throws him, as hard as he possibly can, into the wood-burning oven.
Wanda doesn’t have an answer for that; she doesn’t know how to justify Steve’s neglect over the last few months.
“Hey,” Steve says, firmly, closing his hand around Tony’s jaw, purposefully. “We have a deal, remember? Don’t talk about yourself like that.”
“You promise?” he asks, roughly, his voice wet, and he pretends like the strange dampness in his eyes is sweat from his hair, his brow. “You promise that neither of you are going to leave me? Not after this? Not after we’re done together.”
“Flash’s daddy got married again,” Peter says, solemnly. “I heard him talking at recess that he doesn’t spend that much time with him anymore.”
“Wow, it’s surprising how much more of an ass you can sound with each passing moment,” Tony says, dryly.
Steve backs him towards Tony’s bed, and they fall on top of the mattress together, Steve landing in between Tony’s spread thighs. Their shirts come off, just as the moans from the guest room travel down the corridor, and Tony leans up, moving his mouth from Steve’s to the hollow of his throat, biting down.
The whine splits the air, and suddenly, the entire laboratory goes dark. The whine dies, as does the EKG.
“Yeah?” James challenges. “You’d have been okay with living in a place like this, for months on end, again and again, with the mould and the questionable stains and the lack of indoor plumbing.”
Steve slides free of him on the next thrust, and Tony whines at the sudden sensation of emptiness between his legs. Steve’s hand finds the nape of his neck, keeping him pinned with his ass tilted up, and sinks in an inch. Tony takes a mile and grinds himself down in an almost frenzy, rolling his hips back to meet the thrust.
Tony is still awake, peering at his tablet, and he looks up, blinking in surprise at the shadow of Steve lingering in the doorway.
And then, suddenly, there’s a loud, caterwauling sound, and Zola and his men look in the direction of what seems to an explanation.
He kisses Steve, and there are cheers around them, and Rhodey’s crying, and Tony and Steve are married.
People spare them a second glance when they enter the hotel, either because they recognise Steve from the posters or because of Tony’s colour, but the gilded cage of the elevator closes behind them, and the lift cranks up, taking them to Tony’s floor.
Steve fidgeted. He avoided Tony’s gaze. He poked at his new slice of pie with his fork. Finally, Tony stopped moaning over his own pie and glared at him again. Once Tony stopped making all that noise, it was a lot easier for Steve to think clearly. Well, a bit clearer. Tony’s intense gaze wasn’t helping things.
“You can’t tell me what I feel,” Steve pointed out, wondering why he was indulging in Tony right then. Everyone knew that Tony got a little ornery when he was tired and stressed.
Mitchel turned out to be the man helping Steve and the guy wasn't worried at all by Tony’s narrow-eyed expression. In fact, he was practically swooning when Tony stomped his way into the café. “Oh, this is so beautiful, you came to rescue him so fast, and he wasn’t even in any danger. He didn’t even finish his pie!”
“Okay, you are about to freak out the locals with your panicking,” the waiter said, grabbing his arm and attempting to lift him up. Steve, of course, doesn’t budge. “Oh, my, you are sturdy. Now, come with me, I’ll get you a glass of water. Up, up.”
Then, it was straight to his computer. He had learned to not just type things into the search engine and trust what was provided for him. Besides, he figured typing ‘my boyfriend likes to be manhandled, how do I get him to let me do it in other ways?’ would not get good results. Especially since Steve wasn’t sure if he was ready to see that stuff showing the actual act. Again.
switch-hitter32: woah, woah! you know we tease, you old geezer. you got an issue, we might be able to help. so, what, is your boy afraid to bend over for you? what’s up?
Tony’s face went soft and sweet before he leaned in and kissed him gently. “It’s okay, you are still pretty damn perfect. I’m not trying to say we gotta hump each other, babe. I’m just so into you right now.”
“Fine, we go to bed,” Steve said, placing his hands on Tony’s hips to help him stand up. Tony rested his hands on top of Steve’s, that fond smile back again.
So Steve started taking more showers, to keep his sweat and work-out smell from bothering Tony so much.
“You are very cute, too cute to be wandering around here like a lost puppy,” the man said with a tsk. He tilted his head at Steve. “You know if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you look like Captain America. Boy, would that be crazy, Captain America in my little gay café, surrounded by rainbows!”
“Hey, sweetie, calm down, breathe,” a high, but soothing voice told him. Steve looked up, meeting warm, concerned brown eyes. He immediately recognized his waiter and started fumbling for his wallet, apologizing as he goes. “Oh, hun, you are either new to the land of gay or you had no idea you were in this side of town, huh?”
Tony just grinned, grabbed his collar and pulled him into another kiss. It was deep and Steve almost couldn’t handle the intensity of it as Tony’s tongue entered his mouth. Tony pulled away, nipping him lightly on the lower lip, causing Steve to let out a weird grunt-groan sound. “I had to let you get your head on right, popsicle, and make sure you really wanted this.”
The man bustled off, leaving Steve terribly confused and realizing he didn’t even know this guy’s name. There was a small possibility he was now being held hostage, but the pie that was brought to him had a delicious flaky crust, and he figured someone who got so happy about Captain America owing him money couldn’t be that bad.
He felt a kiss along his jawline, a nervous thrill rushing through him as Tony kissed up to his ear and said, “I promise to make it up to you.”
Eventually, Bruce brought it upon himself to comment on Steve’s actions, in what was probably the rudest way possible. “I’m glad the two of you found each other.”
“Shit,” Tony said, pulling away from the kiss. The man’s back arched, before thrusting up into Steve’s hips. “I-I really hope you plan to continue this, cause, shit, Steve.”
Tony had designed Steve’s space to help him adapt. It had all the classic features of the forties, all the way down to a record player that Tony had said he found in his father’s storage. On top of that was a computer that was designed by Tony to teach Steve how to use it, instead of being expected to know how to maneuver through everything.
Asking Tony seemed like a good idea until he realized the whole problem started because Bruce was under the impression that Steve thought that way about Tony and something in Steve was utterly terrified of Tony finding out about that.
“Tony,” Steve said, exasperated. He walked back over to the kitchen and grabbed a napkin, wetting it briefly from the sink. He made his way back over and, while Tony was watching him with wide brown eyes, he leaned in and began to clean off the grease. “How do you get this stuff everywhere?”
So Steve, sighing affectionately, would scoop the smaller man up in his arms and let Jarvis control the elevator, so he could carry Tony to his own bed. He’d take off the man’s shoes and tuck him in. He’d even make sure there was a glass of water and aspirin next to him for the morning, because he knew Tony had either been bent over a computer or drinking and would end up with a headache either way.
Steve would come up from working out, in desperate need of a shower because being a super soldier did not mean he didn’t sweat, only to find Tony standing randomly in the hallway. Just staring. Then the man would swallow, mumble something, and practically run away. Like he couldn’t stand to be near Steve.
Not on the table, no, Steve had him where he was still holding all his weight up. The table was only there to keep Tony steady, leaving him right on the edge. Steve had never been so turned on in his life. Looking at Tony’s caramel eyes where the pupil was slowly getting bigger and bigger, trying to take in everything. Steve gave into the urge to thrust his hips, feeling a rush of pride when Tony made a whimper sound and wrapped his strong legs around Steve’s waist. And they were strong, trying to pull Steve closer.
Tony lifted up, reached up to tug him down into a kiss. It was soft and gentle like they usually were. Now that he understood the difference, he could feel Tony’s body tremble, tense as he pressed his hands on Tony’s side. Tony moaned as he deepened the kiss, Steve letting out a soft sound himself when their tongues touched.
Suddenly Tony’s hips rocked up without any sense of rhythm. And Steve watched as Tony’s eyelashes just fluttered, the man biting down on his lip.
If he occasionally glanced back at that one particular porn site with the brunette it wasn’t a big deal, it wasn’t like he was dirtying himself over it. According to the forum, curiosity was normal and didn’t have to mean anything.
“Good,” Steve said, feeling nervous as he leaned down and kissed Tony again. And it wasn’t like Tony was actually small, he was a normal size kind of guy, but the super serum had amplified Steve up enough that Tony seemed ridiculously fragile in his arms.
Tony gave a small laugh, before frowning. “Oh, you’re serious. Okay, fine, do whatever it is you’re doing. But you know I’m here for you, right? It’s okay to be gay and all that crap. I’ll even make you a rainbow shield for Gay Pride, if you want.”
Steve followed him out, taking the box of pie Mitchel handed him and ignoring the crowd of people that had gathered outside the café. Yeah, there was definitely going to be something on the news or those stupid tabloids Clint liked to read by tomorrow. Steve glanced at two of the men standing nearby, zoning in on their hands, fingers entwined, before he got into the car with Tony.
Eventually, after a couple hours, he went to Tony’s workshop. It was Tony’s safe space, his happy place. A place where Steve wanted to try what they told him to do, because at least there Tony would start with that happy look on his face and no one would walk in.
“Hey, so, I’m making new spider bites for Nat, I was kind of hoping you could help me test them? In a totally, not abusing your boyfriend kind of way,” Tony said. He paused. “Except I would be throwing them at you. They’d knock Clint out for an hour, or I’d use him.”
Steve leans down to nudge his nose against the bare curve of Tony’s shoulder. “What, a guy can’t try and apologise for acting like a real heel earlier?”
Yet, somehow, he’d become his mother, become the person who waits and watches and bears it in silence and turns his eyes another way so he can’t see how his husband slips away further and further into someone else’s arms and heart.
Steve nods, with a slight chuckle, and then, he sobers. “But yeah, I’ve only heard bits and pieces about what her life was like before SHIELD took her in. They really hurt her. They used to, uh, they used to chain her up each night, handcuff her to the headboard, before she went to sleep, so that the girls wouldn’t escape during the night. They, she was trained in all sorts of things, how to fight and kill and hack and manipulate. They, the Black Widows were supposed to be perfect, so competent you wouldn’t even see them coming, and by the time you did, you’d be dead, and your country would be crumbling, destabilised in days.” He looks away. “She told me about her graduation ceremony.”
“I think that’s a good idea,” he says, quickly, seeing Steve on the edge of a bitter, seething retort.
“Absolutely,” Toni insists, and she gets off the couch, ending up on her knees in front of me. “Look at me, Peter.”
James’ mouth tips up, not a smile but close. “I think I know more about her than you do,” he says, lofty and light. He turns to Tony, his face bright, knifelike. “She’s a Russian assassin.”
He makes his way over to the dilapidated kitchen and runs a glass under the tap, filling it with water. He comes back into the lounge area and hands it to Tony, who takes it gratefully, happy for his fingers to clutch around something solid. The water soothes the wretched dryness in his throat, eases the knot in his lungs, and he drains the whole thing, placing it delicately on the table, where it won’t leave damp ring marks on the papers littering the surface.
And then, the island rumbles and shakes, like Krishna himself is unhappy with this turn of events and is seeking to wipe away evidence of such a thing occurring from the fabric of the universe.
The two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing onto Tony’s bed. Tony’s grip breaks, the killer stabs, but Tony twists away, backed into a corner, with the bed and the walls blocking his escape. Defenceless, he snatches a pillow up; the killer lashes out, disembowelling the pillow, which sends a great gush of feathers flying.
He ends his long, breathless speech with the moment that ended in their bedroom, him and Steve, still in love but somehow shattered by what’s happened between them, but at the same time wanting to fix it, wanting to build it back, build it strong so that it wouldn’t shatter ever again.
