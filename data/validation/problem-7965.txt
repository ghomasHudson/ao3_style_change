He had managed to capture Tony’s essence with his confident posture and pronounced smile lines. Steve had been recalling a moment from earlier in the day when he had made a dumb joke that had gotten a surprised but amused laugh out of Tony, who had thrown his head back and looked more carefree than he had in awhile.
Steve didn’t say anything after that, and they fell into an uncomfortable silence for a few minutes, but it wasn’t long before Sam was pulling Steve away to show him something and Tony had to go pry a drink from Peter before the kid made a decision that would undoubtedly get May on his back.
“But no more comas, right? My heart can’t take it.”
There hadn’t been any new signatures, Cap’s team was staying resolute. Tony knew they weren’t thinking of themselves as retired but they had to be, at least until Tony figured something out.
That was their team. And there was himself of course but Tony didn’t even want to begin to delve into that. He picked up his mug once it was full, and brought it to his lips to take a sip.
They sat like that, enjoying each other’s company and sharing each other’s space. Tony was off in the world of the movie but Steve only looked over at the screen a couple of times. He was fine just sitting and watching Tony, wanting to sketch every shift in his expression. A look of surprise when a secret was unveiled, even though Steve was certain Tony had already seen the movie countless times. A frown when things took a turn for the worse. A smile when a character cracked a joke.
The bartender smiled at him flirtatiously, before going to fetch him a drink. She seemed bubbly and happy, Tony resisted the urge to tell her to go find someone boring to fall in love with and avoid the mess Tony was going through at the moment.
“Why not?” Clint asked, raising his eyebrows doubtfully. He was lounging back against the couch, controller already forgotten somewhere between the cushions.
“Through text. Man, you are basically turning into your husband.” Rhodey dug his phone out of his pocket and showed Tony the texts.
Tony scoffed in an attempt to stifle a laugh. It was odd being able to joke about it now after their wounds had mostly healed. “I don’t have your same reservations. I think I would just try out the future. No flip phones, probably more holograms.” Tony joked, shrugging his shoulders. “In reality, I would let things play out as they should. We shouldn’t try to abuse these things, even if we really want to.”
He sprung up, ready to throw the drink right into the strangers face but a strong hand grabbed his wrist and held him there. Tony looked up into unforgettably bright eyes. Not a stranger then.
"We could just go inside." Tony said, not really offering it as much as just putting the thought out there. Neither of them made any move to leave.
“Excuse me while I go explain my sudden disappearance to Rhodey. Meet you outside?” Tony asked, hesitant to leave, as if in doing so he might not see Steve again. As ridiculous as that was.
“That was uncalled for.” Tony pushed at Steve’s chest so that he fell back on his ass as well before scooping the ice out of his shirt. He could still feel the cold on his chest and he had missed a few pieces of ice which were still melting on his skin. It made him shiver.
“Yeah, yeah it’s me.” Tony felt Steve begin to get up and he withdrew his hand and let it fall beside him but Steve pulled Tony up with him. Steve’s eyes were on the fire Tony had been looking at only moments before.
“Well, I’m not replying to him. He’s got school, and he doesn’t need to hang out in an empty compound with you. No offense.” Happy was squinting at Vision as he talked, maybe trying to decide if he counted as a person.
He was only a few feet closer now and he contemplated yelling above the noise surrounding them. It wasn’t hard to make a decision. “Steve!”
It was about a week later that Tony came home to that party. He had been off for the whole day, busy defending the decision to pardon the Avengers. It had been tiring to say the least.
“I apologized in my letter.” Steve sounded almost offended and Tony turned around, staring at Steve like he was completely brain dead.
"Isn't it a little late for a nighttime sketch?" Tony asked, his voice coming out gentle and without any accusation. The wind threatened to carry his words away.
“Oh, um, you mean the whole thing with...Vision? Is he okay? Did he wake up?” Tony made to get up but Rogers was in his way and he was an immovable wall of muscles. He saw Natasha standing off to the side, watching them with unreadable eyes.
“It’s just Happy.” Steve smiled reassuringly, picking himself up off the ice and then helping Tony up with a hand resting on the small of his back. They skated back to the entrance and stepped off the rink.
When Tony finally made it to Steve’s side, he collapsed beside him. He lifted his bloodied, shaky arm to put against the faded star on Steve’s chest, searching for movement. He thought his own heart might have stopped beating.
It must have caught Steve totally off-guard because usually Tony couldn’t move him so easily. Steve fell down on his knees, and before Tony could quite register what was going on, there was ice down the front of his shirt.
“Nice beard, makes you look like a lumberjack.” Tony gestured at his face with a swirl of his fingers. Steve didn’t respond to that comment, just watched him warily.
“They’re criminals Stark, and you know that. Yet every week you call me and ask for me to pull strings to pardon them.” Ross sounded like he had negativity exiting through his pores.
“Tony.” It was barely a whisper but it sent Tony rushing forward and he fell to his knees beside Natasha who was sprawled on the floor. He didn’t know what to say, reaching forward to feel her pulse. It was steady and he couldn’t see any signs of injury.
They had gone to the location and nothing seemed disturbed. Tony frowned and looked down at the green stone. The time stone. Doctor Strange, who was a nice fellow with an amazing beard, hadn’t fought them on keeping it somewhere safe. He had seemed reluctant though.
But Steve’s words were comforting and Tony wanted nothing more than to believe them. And so he did, pushing his doubts to the back of his mind.
Tony was about to make his way to his own room, rubbing at eyes that were beginning to feel sore. He would say he had handled things a lot better than he had thought he could. He managed an entire day full of press without snapping even once, and he also kept conversation between Steve as civil as he could. Oh, and not to mention the team had a nice little reunion that involved only one punch that, yeah, would probably bruise but Tony didn’t even care.
A flash of a smile came and went like lightning on Steve’s face before he turned to fully face Tony on the couch, curling a leg underneath himself to do so. “Sorry about Clint. I told him to play nice.” Steve said, as if reading his mind. He sounded sincere.
Tony felt far away when fingers cupped his jaw and he was pulled into someone's arms. Tony knew, even before he tilted his head up and got a clear view, who it was.
Tony couldn't see the familiar blue sky above himself anymore.
Tony sighed, not immediately responding. He wasn’t sure how to answer. Things were a bigger mess than he cared to admit but with Steve beside him, even for just a night, things felt more right than they had in awhile.
“I haven’t snapped, if that’s what you are subtly tiptoeing around.” Tony answered, sick of this already. He wanted air, and the storage room was sorely lacking in oxygen at the moment.
Figures that it was on a bad day.
“You’re going to pay for that.” Tony declared, his back hitting the bed as he landed on top of it. Steve fell down on top of him, catching himself on his forearms and hovering over him.
“-are you even listening?” Rogers was shaking his head now, obviously both aggravated and exasperated. That was probably Tony’s fault. “What you did was dangerous, Stark. You had no idea what that jewel would do, and yet you acted impulsively. All reason pointed to that jewel being harmful or something that could have hurt everyone, alright? The Black Order does not sound like an Avengers fan club, and you shouldn’t have done anything they wanted you to do.”
“For the record, 242 days without you is an unbearable amount of time.” Tony informed him, fingers tightening around the fabric of Steve’s dark hoodie. It scared him, imagining Steve leaving again. And so soon after returning.
“We can’t trust anything he said. He messed with my memory too and I can’t remember a thing. For all we know, that solar jewel, is just a trap.” Natasha’s voice was firm and cold. Tony spared her a glance, but didn’t comment on it.
He walked down the hallway, spotting Rhodey. “Hey, are you okay?” Tony knew just how much aliens could mess with a person's state of mind and Rhodey had seemed perturbed earlier.
“Well, just curious.” Tony shrugged like it was no big deal, because that’s how he handled things like this. If he let it spiral into something bigger in his head, like New York and aliens, he wasn’t going to be able to pick himself back up.
the risks. I was hardly the biggest factor.” Tony sighed, yanking off his bandages. He saw Natasha raise her hand as if to tell him not to but he ignored her. “You know a little bit of trust wouldn’t be unwarranted.”
“You’ll be okay, although you should have left those bandages on. And you’re probably at least a little concussed so don’t sleep for a few hours.” Natasha advised him, smiling lopsidedly.
“Some of us are trying to watch a movie.” Clint called, his usual dramatic self, and Steve saw Tony roll his eyes.
would like to continue this nice little thing we have where we tolerate each other and act like we are sort of friends even though you have made it quite clear that we are not. It’s so much easier, why can’t you just let it be? I know
Tony hadn’t gotten a reply from Steve. He was certain of this because for an entire week he had been glued to that stupid flip phone like a teenage girl waiting on her crush to finally respond.
“How did you pull it off?” Tony asked Ross outside the conference room, catching him before he headed away.
"I should get some sleep. I have to get some paperwork done and I'm sure Fury has missions lined up."
__________
But once that week had passed, someone finally came by to visit the compound. Someone with very red hair and a painful bite. Or so he had heard from Clint.
“They’re good.” Rhodey pulled his hand back and Tony relaxed again. He drank his coffee, enjoying the warm steam that fanned his face. They were like that for a couple of minutes before Vision and Wanda came barreling through the door. Tony didn’t know who was up first, Rhodey or himself.
“Geez, take a joke. You need to relax, you’re like a coiled spring.” Rhodey nudged his shoulder, undoubtedly feeling the tension there.
“Not to mention, who knows what Steve’s up to these days? He could be driving without a seatbelt or maybe kicking puppies.” Rhodey brainstormed and Tony shot him an unappreciative look.
Tony bit hard enough at the inside of his cheek to draw blood, he tried to push away the usual thoughts that came with Steve’s best friend. His parents murdered by Bucky’s hands and then his own ready to kill him in return. “Sorry for attacking him like that. I like to think that I wouldn’t have really gone through with it. Really killed him but...I guess I have you to thank for stopping me.” Even if it was with a shield breaking his arc reactor. Even if that shield had nearly killed him.
"No." Tony answered quickly, because he was no longer tense and he was warmer with Steve beside him. He never wanted to move.
“I’m sorry everything went so wrong.” Tony whispered into her hair, closing his eyes and just enjoying her embrace for a few seconds.
Now that he was back, Tony didn’t know how he had survived all that time away from him. It felt like peace. It felt like home.
“I wish I could help but I’ll be here when you get back. Don’t count me out yet.” Tony mustered something he was hoping resembled a smile. It felt weak and ready to crumble.
“Tony? Babe, wake up. You’re going to break your back sleeping like that.” Steve reached over the counter and gently shook Tony’s arm.
Steve’s hands began to wander underneath Tony’s shirt, and Tony regretfully pulled away, releasing Steve’s bottom lip from between his teeth. “We are going skating.” Tony reminded Steve weakly, his chest heaving. Despite his words, he made room between his legs for Steve. He licked his lips subconsciously.
He owed this to them, to the team, to extend an olive branch. He owed them to try to fix things, it’s what he did best. They were broken, that much was obvious to anyone with half of a brain, but they didn’t have to stay that way.
And then there was Rhodey, who was brave and strong and tried to seem unaffected but Tony knew that there was hurting. Even if it was tightly sealed away.
“This is better than last night, isn’t it? Look, I changed my mind because we actually communicated without spitting in each other’s faces. You don’t really want to get into the gritty details of the shit that happened. It happened, and it’s over. My life will be complete when I never even think about it again.” Tony knew that wouldn’t happen, not as long as the nightmares kept up their rigorous schedule of every time he tried to go to sleep.
And then Rhodey took off to go talk to Sam, while Tony shook his head and stared down at the drink. He felt like he hadn’t had one in years. With all the stress of the Accords, he had needed his head together. But it was a party, and after the day he had had, unwinding wouldn’t hurt.
“Tony, we are going to sleep.” Steve said firmly, not because he didn’t always want Tony but because Tony was sleep-deprived and Steve was exhausted even with normal amounts of sleep.
Steve, always the gentleman, even in times of crisis. Tony squinted at him like he was crazy, because he was, but his eyes also felt bleary so that probably had something to do with it. “Uh, yeah, I gue-” He began, lifting his hands and feeling bandages around his head.
“Well, he went back to pissed and yelled at me. Thanks for being there and defending my honor.” Rhodey waited until Tony grew tired and let his hands fall uselessly at his sides, allowing him to wrap up his head. It made him feel foolish, like a kid who had hit their head on something stupid like a pole.
“Right, I know, but it’s been 242 days.” Steve complained, dropping his head on Tony’s shoulder. Tony buried a hand in Steve’s hair, gently massaging his scalp. He could sympathize. Really, what was the harm? It was far too dark for anyone to see them and Tony was just going to embarrass himself skating anyway.
Steve looks at Tony's face and that's probably the most honest expression he saw on the man. So Tony is human huh.
He likes Tony. Oh God he totally has a thing for Tony, how didn’t he see this coming. Fuck!
"Well, about the new guy and how you seem to have a big grudge on him"
Natasha looks at him as they let go and says “It won’t last, it will fall”
Steve gets out of the office without looking back at the other two, he looks at the folder and chuckles again. Tony Stark. Right. Now he has the Mayor son on his truck, this is going to be fun.
When Steve gets home he falls on the couch "God I'm tired" He says.
"Yeah he was"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah" Tony waves his hand dismissively "I apologize-"
Sometimes Steve is not sure if he just cares too much or is just stupid.
"Oh, Bruce..."
A hand on his shoulder makes him turn to the other side and Sam is smirking at him "You okay?"
"And you cannot not sound like a factual hermit scientist" Steve says and Bruce groans throwing his head back. Steve laughs and fondly shakes Bruce's curls "I'm kidding, you're lovely Bruce"
He then turned the phone on and... It had a code of four characters. "Fuuuuck!!!!" Tony growled hitting his foot on the ground.
And for the first time Steve doesn't feel like flushing and falling on his knees for being hugged by her, maybe it's the adrenaline but he just hugs her back and says. "Worth it"
"They just don't know you"
"You're torturing yourself" He feels Natasha hand on his arm and looks back to see her small smile "Common, let's go inside. Start the day with a little less melancholy"
"Tony told you that?"
"Rogers" Fury holds a hand up to shut Tony up "Don't question me" He hands him the folder from before and Steve takes it, twisting his lips "You're dismissed"
Steve just watches mildly surprised, a little concern and the rest confused. But the elevator doors shut with the man inside and Steve is left in front of an open door, so he just shakes his head and enters the house "Tony? Are you there?"
"Hey" Steve smiles.
Anyway, Tony winked at him and got out of the room as he was hugged by sentimental teachers really falling for his shit.
"Coulson died in your shift right?" He says softly after a while.
"But you should stop gossiping about a colleague" Steve says "Common guys, what is happening in this firehouse?"
"Dunno. But it seems important to him..."
, no Anthony likes to be called Anthony" He says while taking the plate with him and following Steve.
"Tony."
Steve chuckles and then, to his surprise, is Clint who comes around with a sandwich on a plate and puts it front of Steve. Steve looks surprised at him but Clint just smiles "Bruce doesn't know what he's talking about. This are the best sandwiches that you‘ll ever taste in your life, made by the real chief here, Clint Barton, me" Clint grins ridiculously.
"Come in"
Steve picks the crow bar trying to push aside the burning debris, anything to get them out the front of that stupid door "Tony, I'm going to get you out" Steve says ignoring the way his voice sounds desperated.
"They say he slept with all the woman at that cartel and he was kicked out because he called their Battalion Chief a pig" Clint is saying and Natasha chuckles near the lockers.
Steve immediately gets up and blurs "He left?!"
Tony narrows his eyes at the picture "Margaret Carter? Like the Sharon girl?" He looks at Steve.
Pietro shouted from the other side of the class "He's on his period" making everyone laugh, and Mr. Coulson frown.
"You did this?" Tony asks with disbelief.
"What a shame" Tony rolls his head to the side, a mocking amusement making him look cocky. The rest of the team stared at him with the same unamused twist of lips, so Steve wasn't the only one thinking the same.
He awkwardly pats Tony's back "Yeah, yeah. Okay. Just work good"
Steve chuckles and shakes his head giving a step closer "No, let's just say I grew another crush. Kinda strong one if you want to know. And maybe, just
They’re all pretending. Clint is probably the only one who's not.
“The front wheels are hanging, it won’t work! You have to at least have a hold on the front!”
"You are all blind" Tony says in an exasperated voice.
Clint and Natasha go together, Thor goes with Jane, and Sharon with Darcy. Steve goes alone but today he signals Tony to follow him and they choose a corridor to call out for victims.
Tony laughs and it fits him so well "And you’re so perfect" Tony says.
It's only after a while that he hears a light knock on his door and is surprised to see Tony walk in "Hey Captain" Tony says almost shyly, if that's even possible.
"He is a jerk. Everyone from every unit I know has been with him at least a week and they all spit his name like their saying 'dog shit on my shoes'"
Loki smirked, "Deal."
"Tony fuck!" Pietro says like it's obvious.
"Clint goddammit-" Natasha is saying angry but whatever it was about to happen they get a call.
"Maybe not. But you helped a lot afterwards, so let’s deal with what's in front of us" Steve smiles.
"Yes but I did! And you follow my orders" Steve yells pointing a finger to him.
"My homework for a month"
It's a last second instinct to jump out of the building through a window, with the body on his shoulders falling with him, and then it's all collapsing on their shadow like a last farewell. All the voices in his radio now scream of that name. Of that man.
"Coffee? Milk?" Bruce asks.
Peter just shrugged "Don't see your point."
"Hey Captain. Just get in, the Chief is expecting you"
"Oh come on, I've been waiting to do this for days" Steve breaths out.
"I'm just - arrr! I don't have to tell you this! Give it back, you jackass!"
"Hey Tony!" A voice called behind him and he immediately hid the phone.
"Yes, Chief” They yell at the same time.
"Nooo!"
"I think we judged him too quickly" Steve points his head at Tony on the other side.
"Hey Tony. How did it go with Fury?"
He can't see anything because it's blurry and of course, he's crying. He tries to clean the tears with his hand but there’s just more drops and he ends up just sitting in a lonely alley, falling on the floor and covering his face with his hands.
Tony looks up at him "I'm kicked out because of my father"
So he does get up and goes to the unit not sure what he would exactly do. Give up entirely his fireman career, which he probably can't, or just ask Fury to give up his Captain status and still keep him as a simple fireman. He's a not sure if that's also what he wants but these days he's not sure of anything.
"Yeah? How's it going?"
"Yeah, very manly" She whispers and Steve laughs.
They get in the warehouse in three minutes but the place is already on an advanced fire. Steve is jumping out of the truck and Fury is already giving orders "Rogers I want your team inside, Wilson head for the other side, and I want someone preparing the hose!"
"A week!"
"Not enough. Turn the water!" Fury yells.
"Yeah right, you're just not getting caught!" Scott made a slight proud smile."Look, if you steal a phone from a guy's pocked I'll invite you to my next party."
Tony shakes his head "Yeah but I think remembering you of your trauma was not the best way to do it"
Steve eyes widen "Holy fuck"
"You should leave the food" Steve says a little annoyed.
Bruce face turns mockingly serious "That's what I'm always asking myself"
"We have to make sure"
"Yeah, it's true. His personality doesn’t help, you can imagine" Fury sits back in his chair.
Fury is seated on the other side of his desk looking through some papers
Fury snorts, which... okay was unusual. At least in the last two months, in front of Steve.
"Well" Clint echoes "All we needed. Another jerk" And even though everyone would say the first one is Loki, Steve sees Clint eyes turning to him.
"Holy. Fuck" Steve says and if Bucky's worried expression was any signal he probably looked panicked.
"We're charging. Five bucks per gram" Pietro says and Bruce comes scowling at him and takes the Nutella out of his hands, Clint just stays seated on the other side eating his breakfast.
"Yeah. An idiot. But a brave idiot"
"-Rogers!" It cut through him, the voice, so calm and firm even between everything that was happening. Steve couldn't, he just couldn't...
"Nice day. I guess I have to thank you again, because hum" Tony waves his hand around "The team. Yeah, they're apparently very cool" Tony says with narrowed eyes, then beams "Oh and I tried to work out what I said and how I said it. Bruce helped me out and I think it worked!"
"Is Tony really...?"
Steve sighs when he gets inside, he's early, way too early for someone who's usually the last one in. But he stops once again at Coulson's photo and it's like... it's like he doesn't deserve it.
When Steve looks, his heart skips a beat, Tony is crouching near the fall of the bridge, with only a loose robe around his waist "Tony, what are you doing?!"
"Oh my God" Steve says honestly surprised "How do you know that?!"
Steve grins in amusement. Now that Tony pointed it out, that sofa really is ugly.
It's probably the only honest smile Steve will see all day directed to him, Sam holds his hand up and Steve bumps his palm with Sam's in a simple greeting.
The last he saw him...
Tony shoved Rhodey complaining in a murmur "You fucking idiot! You-"
Maybe things haven't changed so much in this house. They all just forced it too.
"I can't do this" Steve says distressed and looks directly at Fury "I can't- I'm not a Captain! I'm not Coulson!" Steve points at the helmet "I'm sorry I couldn't save him, I tried everything I could" Steve eyes go to Clint and then to the ground "I really, really tried and I couldn't. I'm not a Captain, I'm sorry. I give up"
Steve’s team immediately follows him to the car, “Steve, we have two people inside. Both bleeding out” Jane yells already at the passenger seat, at the same time Darcy is looking through the window saying “We’ll get you out of here”
"I never took Fury as someone to be afraid of the Mayor"
“We’ll put the anchor at the back, just hold it for enough time for Jane to take the civilians out”
"Let's just say maybe when someone" Sam coughs to his hand a 'Clint' "
"No" Steve says in a rasped voice and Tony stops, everyone seems surprised and worried but Steve says more sternly "No" He takes his helmet and throws it on the floor, and for some reason his whole unit shrieks or gasps "I fucking told you" Steve yells slowly, and points at a wide eyed Tony "To not go the fuck back inside! What's your problem to just fucking ignore everything I fucking say?!"
A cellphone echoed on the class, and Tony immediately looked up.
"Muffins" Bruce shows it up "Betty's especial"
Steve turned, he lets go off what is in his hands and he sees the figure sprawled on the floor, already unconscious, and runs to pick him and put him over his shoulder. He heard concrete falling on one side of the room and a surprisingly advanced fire took most of the place.
"Get out of there!" Steve yells.
Natasha just huffs but her smile tells him she believes in him, and Steve feels way too proud at this accomplishment.
Steve's voice was heard saying "Calm down Buck."
But Fury looks up into his eyes and keeps going "I believe that you are capable. You’re a leader at heart, you have what it takes to do this job and most importantly you care about those you work with like a true Captain should. I always saw that in you. And Coulson also did. I chose you to take this helmet for a true reason"
Steve has to admit he's a little surprised. Tony brown eyes stare honestly at him and all the uneasy Steve was feeling just melts. He smiles a little at the guy and says "Well, this is a great attitude Tony. Welcome to the team"
"Yeah it's always something to do with the way I talk or what I say, but those are things really hard for me to control"
"Yeah, I guess so..." Tony whispers and it's like the best melody on the world. His eyes close a little and he seems to be getting so close until-
Tony eyes him skeptically "You were never to blame"
Steve laughs shaking his head "Hey! I exercise" But then Clint and Tony are already fighting each other over the space in the counter, Bruce sighing exasperated at the mess they're doing, the people on the table laughing too loud at whatever they’re talking about, Darcy is pushing Pietro out of the couch screaming about winning, Loki is being sarcastic about something...
"... And after my mom died of cancer," He cleaned his fake tears, "Instead of my father I never met come take me, it was my uncle! Who lives working for the mob! My girlfriend has a weird skin problem that turns her green as a frog and my best friends are a raccoon, a tree and that crazy guy from class B that probably murdered someone already! And all you give me is an F, just ‘cuz I don't have any brain capacities and spend my time trying to call attention so that I don't feel as miserable as I am!"
"Two weeks."
"Rhodey!"
Fury?
"Oh that you weren't" Sam laughs shaking his head and Steve frowns, feeling like he's missing something.
That generates more laughs and Steve takes a big breath before he picks one of his muffins and shoves it in Tony's mouth. The man huffs eye widening but Steve ignores to send a glare at his team "Enough" He says.
Loki scoffs and Steve laughs "Oh. Adorable"
"Tony! Tony, where are you going?!" Steve yells desperated.
Steve laughs, shaking his head "Yes Chief" He looks at the helmet and smiles even more.
"Ste-"
"Hello, Tony Awesome Stark here. Who is it?" Tony awnsered distractedly.
"What? Sharon again?" Bucky frowns confused.
"The only one? How about being respectful, nice and humble?" Betty voice sounds next to them and even Steve was surprised to see Betty angry.
"Thanks" Steve just says, and looks up at where Clint is opening his mouth for Bruce to feed him. Bruce just rolls his eyes but goes for it "What are you doing there? I'm starving"
"Oh. Yeah, he's one of my best friends"
Tony scratches the back of his head "Yeah but let's not talk about it anymore"
Sign.
"Is it true? That the reason Tony is always changing from units is because of the Mayor?"
"Tony is Mayor Howard Stark’s son?" Steve says with disbelief.
"Okay, Rogers take your team to the bridge, Sam I want the other cars safe before a gas fire starts"
There's a beat where everyone in the room seems to fall into silence, and then what is probably Darcy starting, everyone erupts in a big 'OoOoOh' that ends up in laughs. Clint throws his head back in a big groan and Steve laughs as happy as he hadn’t feel in weeks, watching as Pietro puts his arms over Clint teasing him "So feely dude!"
were Coulson’s last words to him. He remembers it now.
"Sorry?"
Fury jumps surprised, looking wide eyed at him just for a second before falling back to normal "Yeah. I'll give you his address, bring him back Captain. This is an order"
"He just completely ignored a direct order to get out, Chief" Steve turns to him.
"Ouch! What's that for?"
He smiles quickly at him and goes back outside, jumps to his bike and roars alive to go get that goddamn idiot!
"I mean, now you’re his BFF?! When the hell did that happened? Are you seriously joining his reign of evil?"
"Fuck" Tony cursed, then looked at Rhodey, "You started this shit, fix it!"
Steve groans again loudly, and of course Bucky just laughs even more "Oh my God! Let me call Sam. This is hilarious"
Steve held his phone in one hand, but he was to distracted and started walking not really paying attention to it. Tony followed not so subtly as Steve entered in the cafeteria.
Steve ran his hand on his hair in a frustrated gesture that made Tony act by instinct and pass the phone to Steve, saying "Read it."
Steve leans back "And what do you have to say?"
"Oh, he got suspended but it's routine now." Thor sighed. "I got a opportunity to ask how Miss Jane was, and look," Thor showed a piece of paper, "She gave me her number!"
"Shut up! Director's office, now!" Fury said shoving him away from the place while Thor followed, trying to defend his brother actions.
It hits Steve like a brick block and Natasha hisses "Clint"
Tony stares at him and God, he's just so beautiful.
There's a wave of 'oooh's around the sofa and Darcy says "Clint, someone is daring you for a
Steve remembers the situation with Clint and groans "Is Bucky making any night shift?"
"Whoa, I'm right here" The idiot says sitting down in one chair.
Well, that was bullying. Steve would know. No matter how rude a person is, is not your right to act like an asshole back at him.
Then “What the fuck?” Loki shouts.
It's like being back to it again, on that day, hearing that yell. Steve sucks in a breath still staring at the photo and remembers again that it was real and that it has passed. He has to move on now.
"Yeah" Steve agrees too nothing, and is too happy to worry about it.
"It's your job" Fury interrupts and Steve falls silent "It's your job as a
It was hot. Steve could feel his hands sweating under the gloves where he squeezed an iron too hard, too painfully hard. He could see his desperate breathing covering his face protection, not that he would see anything outside of it with all the smoke around. He could hear the fire in the background, the furniture burning, the ceiling falling, a man by his feet moaning. He knew it was way too hot, under all that fireman protection he could feel it starting to burn his skin.
"Yeah yeah! Look, I need a favor, I heard you are a thief."
Bruce shrugs "I'm just observant"
Natasha though, leans into him and whispers "Did you slept together?"
"Steve, please listen to me. The fire is out of control, we can't open the door, it's made of fortified steel and you have a person next to you-"
"Excuse me?" The teacher said confused.
Steve felt something in his eyes, he put his hand against the door and in a broken voice sobs "Captain..."
"Adorable. How long do you think he'll stay here?"
"Fireman-"
"Fury doesn't think so" Steve shrugs again "He doesn't even call me Captain, and he keeps comparing me to Coulson" Steve huffs "And Clint doesn't even talk to me"
"I just never have the chance to prove myself"
Tony sighs and looks away "Look, I'm not made for this okay? I thought I could be a fireman, prove my father wrong but in the end he's probably the right one"
Scott grinned "Only fuck, yes! Just tell me who."
"Oh. Okay"
Fortunately, Professor Coulson was passing next to Bucky and he had to hide the phone, so Tony took the opportunity to call Clint desperately. Meanwhile the son of a bitch Rhodes was only making fun of him!
"Ah? Your text?" Steve said confused.
"Yeah, oh look Tony, sorry I couldn't help you but you ain't gonna believe it! I was pushed down the stairs and guest who caught me?! Sam. Fucking. Wilson! Ahaha, I couldn't believe it, one minute I was seeing death in my face, the other I'm on the arms of the basketball captain, asking me if I'm alright! Awesome!!!"
"Yes Steve" Tony eyes shine honestly at him "How many times have I failed you? You gave me one change, two! And I fail you a third. Worse, I just downright hurt you with this one" Tony throws his hands in the air letting them fall again. "I'm not a good fireman. I will never be!"
"Go ahead"
In silent agreement they walk inside, they both greet the team but the answers are all directed at Steve. Steve does not like the separatism but Tony shrugs it off walking to the only person who seems to handle him: Bruce.
"Just like that? You're gonna help me?"
“Hey Steve” Clint mutters, almost a whisper as the team makes noise in the background. Steve looks at him and Clint winces guilty, hesitating before saying “I’m honestly sorry”
Steve walks to the couple in the kitchen "Oh hi Steve" Betty smiles at him while Bruce says "Good morning"
It was like a roller-coaster of bad emotions, unstable relations and work pressure.
Thanks for everyone who left comments and kudos, you're the best!! :D
Steve sees Tony clench his fists and give a frustration growl "Ah fuck you, Steve!" Tony shouts and suddenly... suddenly it looks like his eyes are watering and Steve feels guilty even though he has no reason to be "You have no fucking idea what you’re talking about!" Tony passes a hand on his hair taking a breath and nods "I'm going to pick my things and go, tell your friends congratulations for getting rid of me"
"We'll solve it then" Sam says and as always his optimism gets Steve "Meanwhile how about I call Barnes for a movie night? He'll be thrilled to hear you complain about the new guy"
"Hey Steve" Pietro calls and Steve looks at him "I'll try" He offers and Steve smiles thankfully at him.
"I'll do my best sir" Steve says surprised at how honest he's being. Even though his relationship with Fury has been uncomfortable in the last months, Steve still wants to please him.
. My password is Tony."
The moment he marches to Fury's office and the door closes behind, he says sternly "I don't want Tony in my team"
"Forget it. Let's do this!"
And there goes the bromantic act...
"Hot" He answers and hears Bucky laugh from somewhere in the kitchen.
Steve laughs and gets up to go to the table "Thanks Bruce" He says, leaving it to the man to decide if it's for the breakfast, what he said or both.
"I'm not giving up!" He yelled with all the force of his voice, the need to cry also thrown to the back of his head. He had to open the door, he just had to open the damn freaking door! The crowbar slips and he stumbles forward losing his balance. And yet the door was still in the same place, locked and secure.
"Just give it back Rhodes..." Tony pleaded. But looking at Rhodey facing his phone he knew it! He just knew it! Even before the-
So, how to take the phone from the pocket of the scariest guy of the school?
"That's the photo given as missing?" Fury points at the picture.
Steve walks in the firehouse, looks at Coulson's picture for a whole ten seconds before he’s getting inside and greeting everyone, "Morning guys"
"It's not that" He says amused, shaking his head "I just... I think I'm not ready to lead this team. I feel like I keep failing"
The job is done routinely quickly and all Steve orders are safely followed by every member of his team. They get everyone outside safely, if anyone was somehow left behind it was too late. The building would collapse anytime now so they had to turn the water on.
"Because she was three times heavier than we both together!" Steve says defensively, breaking in laughs "Not even you would have done it alone"
"It's not enough, Nat" Steve twists his lips and looks around at his colleague, crossing her arms over her black shirt and fireman pants.
Steve stares at the photo where Coulson lips twist in that little smile of his, using his Captain helmet and wearing an official fireman suit, it's the same photo, every day, in the same place. And yet, whenever Steve looks at it it's like the first time he saw it.
Because all of them are pretending. Some months ago he’d be surrounded by his team already, talking about everything and nothing, from how their days have been to personal matters they’d need advice. He would be playing with them, shooting jokes back and around, falling on pranks and visiting each other’s homes on non-working days. Now the best he has are ‘hellos’, work related matters, and goodbyes.
"Oh..." Tony says in the same volume.
"Bucky, c'mon..." Steve tried shouting unsuccessfully but his friend was already gone. Still he murmured "Just don't hurt Banner."
Not long after, Sam appears "Stark has crazy guts. Reminds me of someone"
"Wait,
"Touché" Steve says smiling guiltily.
"Hey, how's class?"
"I have to put the anchor under the car, it's the only way to push it up"
"Really? How much for the phone?" Tony said pointing at the confused Steve who was now being screamed at and threatened by a outrageous Thor, calling everyone's attention, and gathering people that wanted to see a fight.
"Aww but Steve you were really cute. Not that you aren't anymore Captain" Tony eyes him mischievously and okay, Steve is not blushing, he's not! And he will forever deny he hoped Tony was actually flirting with him.
"Phil wouldn't want everyone mopping at his photo every time they pass by it" She says pointing her hand at the picture.
Even if for just a second.
"Wow, you really like the guy!" Rhodey said stealing the phone from Tony's hands suddenly. "You're sending it?"
"Okay" Fury nods, a hand in the man's shoulder in a silent comfort "Sam get your squad to start fighting the fire, Steve-"
"But... but he's still inside, I didn't save him" Steve says gripping the iron in his hand, but in front of him everything is different. It's not an iron door, it’s a wooden one, now burning. There's debris and there's no innocent civilians moaning next to him. Coulson... he's not inside, he's already dead.
"Crush was a better word..." Steve mumbles looking away.
Okay, Tony had to thing fast. Whoever was the guy passing in front of him, Tony picked one of the books in his arms and threw it as hard as he could in Bucky's head, making the other stumble as the object hit him painfully.
Steve shrugs and looks away "I don't know" And here's a sincere answer, he sighs "Being Captain is not easy"
Steve grabs his arm and says sternly "NO"
But then "I don't need you to defend me, Mr. Captain" Tony says offended and Steve is so confused to why "Thank you very much"
"I can't leave you-"
Tony opens his mouth to say something but Steve steals the half eaten muffin of his hand and puts it in his own mouth, glaring at the man. Tony just gasps at him with disbelief, yeah Steve was acting like a child but no one plays with his food. Food is war. "That's the only ability I didn't develop as a child, sorry" Tony says turning back to the table.
"And I pretty sure mine wasn't" Tony whispers and suddenly they're just so close.
"Just try not to have another" Steve answers taking the sugar pot away from Tony and the man chuckles. Steve smiles, he looks around where everyone is eyeing them with weird looks, and shrugs.
On the other side of the room Sharon was on the table seemingly having a very animated conversation with Jane in front of her. Steve watches Natasha walk away to go talk with Betty near the coffee machine. On the lunch table was Thor laughing obnoxiously loud while he ate, just a little disgusting, and his brother was next to him frowning probably thinking the same.
Something twisted in Tony's gut.
"The fucker threw me a book!"
"Aw" Betty puts a hand on her chest.
Not even with Sharon he hit so hard...
"Hey Bruce" Steve smiles. His team is really prompt to make him feel good about being the Captain apparently, and that just makes him even happier!
Steve is suddenly hugged and jumps a little surprised "You idiot" Sharon says in his shoulder. "That was stupidly dangerous"
"It's been two months" Says a voice somewhere behind him. Steve doesn't have to look to recognize it.
"Why?"
"Yeah, you did. And I'm really happy for you"
Tony looked to see a very angry lady covering the ears of a small kid as they passed by.
“Everyone out. Now” Fury says.
Steve immediately gets up and walks inside the office. Fury is behind his desk and just makes signal for Steve to close the door and sit "Good morning Rogers" He says.
"Something must be very wrong" Sam nods, walking while reading the file. "Damn. He's been in more firehouses than any firefighter in history"
The guy forced himself to sallow, cleaned the ketchup around his mouth with his sleeve and smiled "Wow, Tony Stark knows my name! I can't believe he's talking to me."
Steve stays silent. Okay. Point. Right, it's true. Steve shouldn't even be so angry about it, yeah Tony was infuriating but he deled with the twins, Clint, Darcy and Loki. He was being personal about Tony with all that happened to Coulson. He shouldn't be.
"I'm sorry, I can't hear you in order to do my job!"
"Only you to know that right?" Wanda says and a group laughs.
"Tony!!!" Suddenly came Peter Quill, "I got a D!" He showed him the paper "Ehehe, It worked! It actually worked!"
“I said no, Stark”
"Yes Chief" Steve says at the same time as Sam, and starts running making signal for his team to follow. "
"Oh, really? How do I do that?"
Steve just sighs "I know. I am, it's just..." Steve looks back at the photo "I feel like I have to remember it"
Tony looks up at his face and winces. Okay, so maybe not? "Look Steve, thanks for coming here but I'm not going back"
Steve sighs, he can't believe it "So it's all a corporal expression problem?"
Tony stays frozen in the middle of the room eyeing everyone for some seconds and then finally says. "Okay. This was creepy" But before everyone can take it back he just smiles and says "Hey guys, everything okay. Thor how are you? Fancy to see you all being nice, it's almost like- oh shit, am I going to die?!"
"Is this unit 199?" A strange voice makes itself loud in the main area and everyone falls silent. Steve turns along with everybody to the door and it's almost unbelievable. The man there is in full firefighter suit, holding his body in a fluid motion, a mischievous smirk surrounded by a perfect beard, beautiful chocolate eyes showing true confidence and a styled haircut, it was like the man was on a magazine trying to prove how sexy a man in uniform is. Then his voice sounds confidently in the whole room "I'm kidding. You have a very obnoxious plaque on your entry with your unit number. I just thought I'd made a cliché entrance"
He saw Bucky look at the phone under the table - Shit! -and then he immediately looked at Tony. Tony made several brusque movements for Bucky not to read it, but the guy smirked! The guy totally and deliberately smirked! Fuck, he was going to read it.
"You just send my brother to beat up that guy. Why? And dont bother lying to me, I'm a master in mischief."
Fury eyes him a little and then says "I have a close relationship with the Mayor. I always knew his son"
They spend some seconds on a staring fight, Tony narrowing his eyes at him with displeasure and then of course, Clint voice cuts through it with a "Hey Stark, I heard you were kicked off most unit's you've been in. I wonder why"
And he would never see him again "TONY!"
"Sorry" Loki says looking serious at him "Couldn’t hear your scouts speech too distracted with your penis, could you repeat?"
For the first time in mouths, Fury smiles at him "Well said, Rogers"
"It was on that wall" Tony waves his hand to nowhere in specific, and then points again at the picture "But is it? Is it you?"
"Tony..." Steve says in awe.
Steve snorts. He can't believe Tony thought he was cute. That man is another thing entirely, he never meant to hurt anyone. He couldn't know that locking himself in a room would trigger Steve.
Steve walks to sit in front of Tony and doesn't miss the man's smile "So how are you?" He asks, forcefully ignoring the fact everyone was looking at them like aliens.
"Yeah, okay fair"
"How sure are you?" Steve asks.
Aaand The End!
"It's hum, Steve? I wanted to talk to Tony. If it's possible" He adds as an afterthought.
"Hey, what are you celebrating?"
"Don't give up!" Steve shouts angrily.
"I just did" Bruce frowns "You just asked. I'm not going to randomly explain this to people when they don't even care"
"Oh yeah, you're so confident now. I wanna see you play with these cheaters. If you win I'll pay you a dinner"
Steve smile drops "What?"
They both run outside to get in the truck with the others, and drive out the house with the sirens on, blaring in the streets to let them pass. They're in the fire location in less than three minutes, it's a five story building, smoke is coming out of every window but the fire only started on the second floor and several civilians are coming out of the front door running and coughing.
Steve can't even admire the fanciness of the house as his attention falls on an adorable and quite sexy Tony in pajamas, squeezing his eyes and with his hair sticking every way possible "Tony" Steve breaths out. Oh embarrassment.
Tony jumps yelping and puts a hand to his heart "Jesus Christ Steve, I'm too young to die of an heart attack" He breaths out "Forgot to put this in the right place, don't wanna anger Loki, the guys humor is always like a raining day on the beach"
"Hey!" Steve said suddenly, "Where's my phone?"
"Yeah. I-I wasn't there but... I knew her" Tony nods slowly. And then Steve pinches his lips and the last person he knew in that wall was next to Coulson "And that's Riley. Long story"
Steve watches as Tony hand falls on top of Bruce's shoulders and pushes them both out of the room, Bruce laughing to whatever Tony just said. And Steve has no idea why it annoys him so much.
"You don't listen to what people say"
"Oh my God" Sam groans throwing his head back and Steve smiles a little "Do we have to go through all the ‘is not your fault’ situation again?"
Sam grunts dropping his console on the couch "You girls are terrible" Then he looks at Steve and smiles "What's up man?"
"Good morning, good morning" Tony says walking inside but immediately stops in his tracks when Natasha actually answers.
Steve smiles back "Yeah. Thanks to you"
"Yeah" Steve hands him the folder.
Tony rolls his eyes and Fury answers "Yes"
"How was work?"
"Traitor" Darcy hisses what everyone is probably thinking, if Clint's deadly glare was any prove.
After the shower the evening is quite calm, if a wrestling war in the living room could be somehow described as calm.
"Something that I'm clearly not listening to and it's interrupting my reading" Loki says, coldly as per usual.
He was panicking!
Oh. That's right. Rhodey faked dying to get everybody sooner out of the class, just so Tony could catch Steve's phone. Now he'll have a week doing boring work afterschool just for helping his friend on a stupid mission...
Steve just watches from where he's eating cereal at the table, Tony is as always confident and elegant, but when he meets Steve's eyes his smile is a little more suave "Morning Tony" He says and his dramatic team gasps.
Yet he always listened to that voice, the command he has been following for years, his job, his life "Phil..."
So, while Loki was being grounded, his things were in the teachers room, including Steve's phone.
Tony groaned and ran after the other praying Don't read it! Don't read it!
"On what? This is so confusing" Jane laughs.
And if there’s anyone else not pretending, it’s him.
"Well, hum, thanks" Steve says looking away while scratching the back of his head.
Steve gives him reason. So he pretends he doesn't acknowledge Clint is ignoring him, he has been pretending for two months and he deserves it.
"Ohh" Tony said truly surprised. Good for Scott...
When the end of the shift arrived Steve finally had his time alone with Tony - he dressed purposely slow to be the last one leaving the locker room, ignoring Sam's suggestive eyebrow dance when he dismissed him, and maybe luck was on his side because Tony was also the last one staying.
"It didn't open. I was so close and I couldn't save him" He cries letting his tears go as Tony hugs him more tightly "I was the only one there, I swear I did everything I could, but... I just... couldn't save him"
"No! I won't leave you, I will open this door" Steve says frustratingly hitting those debris aside. He won't let anyone else die again!
Clint looked at Bucky, who was waiting for Professor Coulson to keep going, and then turned again,
His lips taste so good against Steve's. Steve hands touch Tony's waist and pulls him closer while Tony's arm goes over his shoulder, his other hand guides Steve head throughout the kiss.
"Oh, well, it's easy! You just have to worry about Professor Strange, he sees everything. But the rest is blind or doesn't give a shit."
"Oh, Steve... I'm so sorry"
"This shower conversations get weirder and weirder" Loki says a shower away.
"Yeah? He's just a friend?" Steve asks not caring about the obviousness of it.
"How?"
Scott looked interested, "Really?"
like in me?" Tony says and if Steve didn’t known better he would say Tony sounded shy.
"See you tomorrow Tony"
[Truck 616, Squad 5, Ambulance 13. Building on fire on 61 Street]
Tony eyes widen a little and then he beams like a child "Thanks Cap! And I thinking you were just a grumpy man, you have a wonderful smile"
Tony hums "I'm sorry"
"Rogers" Fury says getting closer.
Sam just holds up his hand in a greeting saying "Hey dude" And Clint does a reluctant noise on his throat and is probably shoved in the ribcage by Natasha, then mutters a "Hey"
"I'm not a candid anymore" Pietro says turning to Steve, who's crossing his arms in the counter.
Bruce turns from where he is with his back to him and says "It’s really just sandwiches, Steve"
But all Steve can think about it's a smile. It's a laugh. It's a face, brown eyes, perfect beard. Something shy, something sensual, something leaning into him after a dangerous call. It's a courage, a sensibility, an happiness, a conviction and a honesty. All so perfectly fit in one man.
"The thing is" Tony says gesturing with his hands "Even people who know me, usually don't"
"And you didn't care to tell me this?"
"Yes?"
"What are you going on about?" Steve asks before giving a bite to his breakfast.
Steve just blushes a little watching her go and keeps walking until he gets to the counter where Pietro successively steals the Nutella jar from Clint, taking his tongue out "Give me that, candid!" Clint yells.
Bruce sighs "Tony. He looks confident, therefore smug and full of himself" Bruce explains "It's what he looks like naturally even when it's not what he's trying to transmit" Steve eyes wide as he starts to understand "When we're hearing him from here, we automatically know he's just trying to make a friendly joke, but for those who look at his face and see his usual smirk, just assume he's making fun of something or someone"
"Son of a-" Bucky yelled angry and Tony saw him pass running fast after Bruce. Poor kid. Tony will have to pay him big.
"Wha-"
Tony arms clutch around Steve's shoulder as he looks at where his dead was about to be, and Steve can feel the man shivering in his arms, the little sign of fear is the only thing that takes away Steve wish to let the idiot just fall the fuck down.
"And there you go again" Steve throws his hands in the air.
"There's sugar in the kitchen" Steve points. The room falls unusually silent, even Tony lifts an eyebrow.
Great. Another one "Yes Chief" He says as Fury passes him a folder, probably with all the information about Tony he needs but the papers aren't even in his hands when the emergency signal rings.
"Yeah, you're always bragging about yourself" Steve shrugs.
Steve frowns "You use makeup?"
Probably both.
Fury sighs "I don't think you're one to decide that"
"Morning" Steve says with the smile he can managed, getting inside.
Natasha eyes widen a little and she looks skeptically at him again "Are you sure?"
Tony was about to feel guilty when... "Shit, Steve has his phone!!"
Tony frowns a little "I lost but I was never really close to anyone I guess. I'm not very good at making friends" He smirks at Steve, though that is really just uncomfortable "But I can tell at least two people who still make me cry"
Tony frowns at her and a wave of 'ooooh' and laughs roll around, so before this continues Steve swallows and says serious "Okay guys, enough. This is not a middle school, let's not bully the new recruit"
well, Tony went in the defensive"
And suddenly, Rhodey threw himself at the ground yelling "Aaaaah!! What a horrible pain!"
"Steve, what's going on? Come on, don't leave a guy hanging on suspense" Bucky shakes his leg.
"Well, yeah"
"Well, thanks" He walks to the kitchen where Jane gives him a bowl, spoon, the milk and sugar "Thanks darling" Tony says and Steve frowns, is he seriously flirting with Jane? But then he sits next to Steve, actually putting more sugar than is healthy and joining the cereals. "I had a sugar overdose once" He says casually "I was ten but still, not very clever of me"
"I'll do your homework."
"So you didn't just kiss me because you were an emotional wreck?" Tony says stepping closer, the hope clear in his voice.
"You can't stay! This is your job, you have to save the man next to you and leave, now. Or the three of us will die in here"
"I kinda admire that..."
“Maybe from the sides” Natasha says.
"Yeah, keep telling yourself that..."
"Secondary. We got a new one" Clint keeps saying "And then, to get worse, we get the Mayor's son. Hurray. Happy life, let's just deal with it shall we?"
"Look, I'm not as incompetent as I seem-"
"I was there Tony, there was so much fire, it was all breaking down" Steve whimpers, flash backs crossing his mind "I was so close to him"
"Rogers" Fury's scary calm voice calls in the radio. Steve curses under his breath "What's your position? Why is all your team outside but you and Anthony?"
A relieved smile forms in Tony's lips "Thank you Steve"
"Steve-"
And Darcy says "Aw so beautiful"
Steve nods and is happy to say honestly "Yeah"
Tony heard Steve sighing in relief then chuckling, "See you at eight?"
"You're doing well"
Steve spend the rest of the night in Bucky's bed complaining about how much of an idiot he was, it must have been a really pity act since Bucky only pushed him off the bed twice.
"You know Hill, a nightmare!" Bucky chuckled, "You?"
When they get to the unit Fury wants to talk only with Tony in his office. He sees Pietro and Clint high fiving each other while other mean comments roll around, but he ignores them, going to his office instead.
"Loki!" Thor said angry.
...Or is it?
Steve frowns confused. "What do you mean?"
Tony groans throwing his head back "Yes! So what?"
"What were you thinking?" Steve asks with honest concern "That was incredibly dangerous"
Even if the man acted wrongly, after everything they went through the night before, Tony didn't deserve to deal with all of Steve's accumulated anger and frustration.
Steve sighs and gives another step back. Wow, the Mayor is always such a great guy, it's hard to believe what Tony is saying, but people are not always are what they appear to be, especially politicians. Tony could also be lying to him, wouldn't be a surprise, but Steve still feels like believing him. And anyway, with this kind of pleading Steve is just naturally weak.
"At least you were right most of the time." Sam says sitting in his desk. Steve relaxes back in his chair to look at his friend "Though you always needed someone to go save your ass"
"Holy shit" Sam says smirking and opening the folder "No way"
"Of course. There's Rhodey, and Pepper..." He counts with his fingers "And Happy? And hum..." Tony pinches his lips "I don't think that's the point" He says turning to Steve.
The security guard at the building actually passes a metal detector around him, which okay is really uncomfortable, before letting him up. Steve knocks twice and waits "Who is it?" An anonymous voice echoes from inside.
Steve just smirks at him and Tony sends him a kiss "Miscalculated sorry, but you know it's not today you're getting rid of me"
"You're a good Captain you know?" Tony says lowly and Steve sighs "For me you were"
He ignores the thought in order to look for the apartment building in the middle of the rich apartments buildings in the part of the city Steve never even dreamed on steeping in, and apparently it’s hard. He really doesn’t know where he is.
Tony shuts his eyes in reflex and there's some gasps around them in surprise, suddenly Steve is nervous if he's gone too far? It was really just a little bit of water on Tony's forehead, nothing enough to wet his clothes or something, just let some drops fall on the table, but still...
He swallows. Yes, yes it is.
"Aaaaand he's here" Darcy says loudly at the same time Clint comments "I was having a good day until I saw you"
Steve lowers his finger and Loki starts the truck, the equilibrium is not right with the loss of the human weight and the anchor gets out of place. Steve only needs to hear Tony's "Oh-uh" to know the car will fall on top of him, he jumps.
The man groans and Steve is scared he said something wrong "So you’re him! Just do me a favor and don't leave him alone okay? I'm late to work and I have no time for babysitting" The man says getting out of the door, almost dropping one of the drinks in his hand but catching it in time.
Next day "What a beautiful day to work today" Is Tony’s greeting. A wave of groans sounds around.
"Thanks" Steve says honestly, he then turns to Tony and asks "Have you lost people too?"
"Take all but stop the fight and get my phone." Tony said showing him his wallet.
"That's too dangerous! Come back up, it's an order!"
"Before I regret it, yes." Tony answered. Steve looked at his phone and Tony shouted "Not in front of me silly! I didn't pursue that phone through the entire school to see your reaction to it!"
"What? No!"
"And ruin the surprise?" Tony says grinning. It's not funny "Okay, in his defense I just warned him like" He looks at the watch on his wrist "Half an hour ago, so let's give him a break" Then Tony's eyes go wide "Oh are those Nutella toasts?" And shamelessly walks to the counter where Bruce is shrugging and handing him a plate.
"Sorry. It's creepy, I know! I can explain, I mean, I can't. God, why did I just told you this?!"
Steve narrows his eyes and says "Actually many units just didn't accept him"
"I wish…"
"You know, I meet Phillip in my first years as a candid" Fury says pointing at the photo Steve was holding, and Steve now notices Fury has his helmet in his hands "We weren't the best friends at first but we warmed up" Fury shrugs "He saved my life, I saved his, and we became partners, friends for long years" Fury explains and then looks at the helmet in his hands "And when I became Chief? He was as happy about it as I was..."
“Just a sec” Steve hears and turns around to see Tony walking back through another corridor. His eyes bug out.
She giggles shaking her head "All backwards Steve" And she keeps walking away into the hall saying "I'm fine, thanks"
Tony laughs sitting up on the side of the bed and Steve takes that moment to sit up too and away from the why-personal-space man "Oh my God, Steven!" Tony says holding the picture with his two hands and looking at it with way too much shine in his eyes.
"You're the worst friend ever"
After Sam comes over and he’s laughed at and patted in the back sometimes, Steve finally goes to sleep thinking of Tony is a less stressful way. The crush is there, nothing could be done about it, and by self-experience Steve should just accept it and let it go. With luck it would pass.
"Wow. So this is what it feels like to be part of a unit?" Tony balances his legs on the bench like a child "Interesting"
"I wish" Clint says and throws a paper at Tony's forehead. Tony picks the paper back with a smirk and throws it back but Clint moves away and yells "Faaaaail"
"In the... wait, Tony defended me?"
It's not much longer after breakfast that they get the first call.
"I hate being called that"
Then Odinson stormed out. Suddenly Tony felt a clench in his stomach, did he just send someone to fight with Steve?!
"The captain of the basketball team!"
The new man though just smiles widely "I'm Tony and I'm the new recruit of your truck, I loved the dumbstruck reception but I have to admit I expected a party"
"Yeah!!!!" Everybody screamed running out of the class while Coulson unsuccessfully said "No no no" and, out of his control, everybody disappeared from the room, even the supposedly sick Rhodey "I can't believe I've fallen for this..."
Clint groans and Pietro tsks. He hears Darcy whispering something probably offensive and the group near the television chuckling. Tony seems to pretend not to hear just to turn to Bruce and say "Hum, this is really good"
Between the smoke Steve sees Tony's shadow kicking a door and yelling "Fireman, call out!"
It was public knowledge there was still a very thin line of tension on the 199 firehouse that put Steve in the middle of its breaking point. All coming from the two month ago accident were the blame, the consequences, and the new responsibilities all fallen on him. And he had too much to prove to the people whom he still needs forgiveness from.
Silence falls between them for some seconds and then Steve says seriously "I thought I was a bad Captain too"
As the group laughed and played, Tony walked slowly backwards. When he seemed free of the others, he turned to make his way only to go against no one but Steve himself.
"Common, you have to have friends" Steve points out.
"Give him time" Bruce says not even looking up at him.
Steve shrugs "Yeah, I guess"
"Yeah... and it got me thinking maybe that crush of yours is not very one sided"
"Sup guys!" Lang appeared out of nowhere.
Steve shrugs, a little (very!) shy "Just asking, you never know"
Steve grunts furious. "Jane?"
And Tony just grins saying "Yeah, get used to that. I'm known to have lucky in life"
"You're gay?"
"Bucky said you texted me, I was really worried I didn't have time to see it,"
He mouthed back.
When they get to the factory the chemical fire is visible from almost every window and the smoke is covering the whole block. Steve starts immediately making strategies to stop the fire while Fury some feet away from him asks one of the civilians already outside, coughing and covered in dust. "How many people are still inside?"
"How would I know?! Not his mother" Sam says taking his phone out. Steve laughs "So movie night, huh?"
Steve wants to be offended but he actually laughs at that, shaking his head. "Exactly. And I was nineteen trying to be a tough fireman"
Fury just grunts and turns to give other orders.
But then, thinking about what’s missing, he looks frenetically around asking "Hey, where's Tony?"
"Hey there, Mister highness" Pietro says dangling in the chair, there was a smirk on his face but he didn't sound malicious at all. Steve smiled proudly.
"Are you seriously defending him?" Clint says once they’re out of sight. Of course the first time Clint wants to talk with him about non job stuff, is to start a war.
"Ah" Tony says keeping his eyes on the picture. "So hum, I see you and Sharon talking sometimes" The topic throws Steve out of guard "You seem very..." Tony coughs in his hand "With each other" God! Even Tony noticed?!
"Oh, come on!" Tony groaned. "I'll pay you."
"Has hum" Tony says and waves at the whole wall, at the other pictures too "Any of the others also gone in your shift?"
"Hey Bruce!" Tony calls out suddenly, and Steve looks back to see the paramedic passing by, now looking at them. He smiles and Steve frowns at it "Good talking to you Cap" Tony pats his shoulder getting up "Let's keep this up" He winks before walking to Bruce already saying "You're not going to believe..."
"Morning my friend, how are you today?" Thor asks cheerfully as always.
"Bully?!" Clint shouts with disbelief.
“Bruce, Betty we need you” He says to the radio “Can you get them out?”
"Steve!" It's Tony's voice in the radio "Steve I'm here, I'm safe! Get out"
"Steve..." Tony stares at him "I don't care what happens to me I won't let anyone else die on my watch because I didn't check"
It just hurts so much. All the time. He can't do this any longer.
"Tony" Steve grips his arms and Tony turns glaring at him.
"Can I ask you... what happened?"
“You have one”
Steve sighs and leads the way. They stop by the secretary "Good morning Maria" He says.
Steve chuckles and finally he's not the only one to laugh. Tony shifts uncomfortably at the attention, who would say, and Pietro says "Oh Tony, you're not gonna tell me you’re shy now"
"I steal money Stark."
Bucky chuckles "What? The annoying newbie you and Sam were all complaining about?"
Steve shrugs "I think he knows him from before. Tony knew Coulson"
Okay. Steve will never admit he blushed at that "Hum thanks"
"Is this you?" Tony says showing Steve a picture and Steve stops in his panic.
"Sorry." Rhodey shrugged, and Tony couldn't believe it... He really send it!
"Oh hum, he... talks way too much" Bruce smiles and Steve chuckles.
"Hey Buck."
They both break in laughs, a long ago memory in his minds. When they calm down Sam is shaking his head "I told you one day we would laugh about it"
"Something super gourmet to vary a little" Pietro says waving his hands in the air.
The word makes shivers go through Steve's body "That's what you do when you have a firefighter that needs guidance, you don't give up on him"
"On it Chief" Steve interrupts already making a signal for his team to follow him to Block B, while Sam answers their usual "Yes Chief"
"I have a crush" Steve admits "How could I not see it before?"
"Why don't we go home?" Tony said very slowly. Steve just nodded, and they got up quite fast in a silent agreement not to talk about this and went their separate ways.
He closes the door and sits next to Steve with a huff, putting himself comfortable. Steve had to be amazed by his shamelessness in front of his probably new Battalion Chief, there's no way Fury would tolerate the rudeness.
"Not everyone is good expressing themselves. The same way you can't flirt with Sharon, Tony can't appear nice"
"I bet on me" Tony answers walking to Steve with a questioning look.
After every one goes slowly back to normal, Maria appears in the room calling for him "Rogers, Fury wants you in his office"
"Captain" He looked at the door again in a last hope to see it open up.
Bruce looks up at him and smiles. It can't be honest, it can't "Give him time Steve, it's all going to take a while. For all of us. But it will pass"
"And I'm actually happy you told me about it"
"The door is locked, there's no time to open it, the ceiling will fall every moment now"
Anyway, Steve cleans his throat, takes a big breath and says "Good morning"
Steve eyes him for a second and shakes his head “No. Won’t work, it’s too heavy. We’ll push it from the back of the car”
"I don't know, I'm just me and apparently that's the problem"
" Which Sam answers "Oh fuck you" while Clint is saying. "You're on, loser. Get the Pizza Hut number while I give this girls back they stereotypical femininity"
“That’s risky” Darcy points out.
was the first thing Coulson yelled. It's how it all started.
Steps take Steve off of his thoughts, but he doesn't look up. The person coming sits in the bed in front of his and Steve looks up surprised to see it's Fury
"Oh Tony, sorry."
Steve looks at the woman next to him and smiles sadly, "I was hum, just a candid. She was a Tenant"
"He's nice" Bruce shrugs “I like him”
"It's also called being used"
"Coulson dismissed us early. One guy had a heart attack or something."
good speech about what being a Captain meant and I think he kinda inspired all of us" Sam points a thump inside "It wasn't long, but I guess it was the push most of us needed. I guess it is time for all of us to let go" Sam eyes him pointedly.
"What hum, what don't
"I'll distract him, do it quick." Tony eyed Peter suspiciously. "What??"
Suddenly everything makes sense and Steve gives a humorless laugh "So that's why he's here" He says to Fury "That's why he's staying"
“When was our job not?”
The next day Steve is so nervous that Bucky almost literally throws him out the window. Steve gets in the unit feeling good with himself and only spares two seconds to look at Coulson's picture with a smile while he passes by it before going directly inside.
"Yeah. Stop feeling guilty about it, we're over this" She says walking closer to him.
Suddenly a whole new image is set in Steve's mind. "No way..." He whispers in disbelief.
"Sort of" Sam explains and pushes Steve to some seats near the entry "Tony angrily told us how you felt guilty about what happened to Coulson, how you always stopped by his photo" Sam points "And how we all treated you like garbage because we blamed you too. Well, not in these kind words, maybe"
She laughs straightening in her seat and says "Okay" and Steve turns his blushing face away. In front of him Tony is raising a questioning eyebrow and Steve just smiles uneasily and shrugs.
Steve frowns, is it possible Tony doesn’t live alone?
"Yeah, I know..."
It takes them twenty seconds but they do bring someone, alive, outside. The water’s turned on and the paramedics immediately get the man, the relieved smiles of their team is evident, and somewhere between the fury in his eyes, Fury's also seems relieved "You two are in trouble" Fury warns.
"Tony, why don't you just shut up?" Natasha says with an eyebrow raised in annoyance.
"You would have never carried her out had I not broken orders to run after you"
"Pffft, I had it handled" Steve waves his hand dismissively.
"I don't deserve it Phil" Steve whispers. He shakes his head and goes inside, there's no one in the main room yet and seeing the place so silent is sad. He walks inside to the beds and sits on his, sighing. In the nightstand is still that photo Tony took from one of the walls and Steve picks it to see his young incredibly tiny self, full of dreams and hopes.
"Yo Sam, you won't believe it!" He hears Bucky say and groans. Gosh, where's the privacy goddammit!
"Oh..." Scott said embarrassed.
And it's like a dejávu, like it's all happening again. Steve carrying a man when the fort door falls shut and locks behind him.
Clint, Sam, the Maximoff twins, Darcy, Natasha and Sharon are playing cards on the large table. Some good ‘morning's’ and ‘hello's Steve’ are heard from there.
Steve sighs looking up at the ceiling "Is Tony really brave?"
"Lang!" Tony shouted as the other kid looked confusedly at him with a half hot dog in his mouth.
Before Thor can go apologetic, Steve swallows the lump on his throat and changes subject engaging Thor in a new conversation, with a brand new smile.
"It must be hard to kick out the Mayor's son so until he really pisses off Fury? It can't take that long"
But of course, the plan is ruined as the ring bell shouts and a bunch of punks go out of the classrooms running like loose chickens. Scott is almost making his
"Ops..." Rhodey said facing Tony with a I'm-not-really-sorry smile.
"I was pondering the same" Thor says.
Bruce sighed and looked at the sky like he prayed before saying "Take that!" And running the fastest he could.
Steve only flinched a little at the mention of passing time with Bruce and oh, oh no jealousy. He's the worse! And then he throws that thought to the back of his mind because he has to smile proudly at Tony.
Steve chuckles letting himself be pushed inside by her "Melancholy is my life Nat, don't take it away from me"
"Huh?" Steve says, feigning confusion. But he knows what Bruce is talk about.
Steve frowns a little, watching Tony's face as the man rolls his eyes and tells they bicker like kindergartens. It's like Tony says something completely rude and offensive but he doesn't even meant it to sound like that even though it completely does.
Tony pinches his lips "60%"
"Thank you" Bruce says handing him the cup of milk "Just for that you get an extra muffin-"
"It's being really hard to believe in that"
"Oh er, hum yeah" Steve blurs, his hand going up behind his head "I'm great Sharon. How are you? Hi"
Tony hand falls on his shoulder and it's like a slap on his face, all the pain he keeps bottled inside wanting to brush out. Steve bites his lip "Hey..." It’s Tony's voice. So comforting.
"I see" Steve answers smiling a little. Clint hasn't talked with him like this for months...
"He's late"
"Ah, the day is being weird. I was almost beated down by Thor and I think someone stole my phone..."
“We should grab a robe, go under the car and tie a cord to hold it from the front” Tony interrupts.
The day went calmly, if Steve freaking out for liking Tony and constantly wanting to know where he was could be called calmly.
"Maybe... oh yeah, Rhodey always says something about me putting on a show. Which I don’t" Tony says and then mutters to himself "I think…"
“Steve, we haven’t checked this one”
"What?" Tony looks at him with honest disbelief "No way, you look like a five year old baby who hasn't been eating because he gives his food to abandoned cats"
Tony gasped and choked at the same time.
"Thank you Steve" Bruce says rolling his eyes fondly and walking inside.
After two more calls and almost no one interacting with Tony, the shift is over, and Steve stays in his office wasting time with the promise he'll be home soon after Sam says he'll pick up Bucky.
"You don't need any more sugar" Bruce looks at the kid’s dripping chocolate toast "Take this to your sister" He says handing him a plate.
"Captain! How are you?" Thor says smiling wide and Steve fights a cringe.
Tony stops what he's doing to raise an eyebrow in his direction, a smile playing in his lips "What Captain? That seems a lot like you’re looking for an opening spot"
"Find out by yourself. You'll have time"
"I'll ask Fury about it" Steve warns, because he'll want to know if Tony is lying. Tony doesn't seem to react much at that soooo "But the rest of the team will not hear it from me. It's something personal about you, I'll respect it"
Clint glares at him but says nothing. Sam is the one who nods and says "He's right guys. Let's just ignore the jerk"
They talk for a while, Steve explains what happened with Clint, Sam tells him some of the gossip going around, mostly about Tony and his seemingly playboy slash bad boy fame around, they talk about Sharon and Steve's still ridiculous crush on her, they talk about Bucky and a while after Sam decides to leave Steve to his report, there's a recognizable knock at his door.
"The point is, Tony" Steve says sternly "We all constantly make mistakes, we all constantly lose ourselves not knowing what is the right thing to do, but what's most important is acknowledging our errors and trying to do better. And one of the most important things I've learned is that you don't have to do it alone" Steve extends his hand.
Apparently in the end all he wanted was to make Coulson proud, and just Fury’s approval means more than Steve could ever have expected. Was this really all it was needed for him to have his confidence back?
It felt like the world was collapsing around him and there was no way to save it.
He sees Thor checking the door and shaking his head “We’ll have to break it down”
So, how to get there?!
"This is going to be fun" Loki says way too amused.
"Yeah! Aren't you Lang?"
Steve is laying in his bed when suddenly Tony jumps on top of him, Steve eyes wide at the man currently locking his thighs and oh my God! He can feel his own cheeks burn and tries to immediately sit up. Tony just grins at him seeming completely oblivious of how that kind of intimacy can affect Steve "To-Tony!"
"That's why he'll receive a punishment for it. But he needs to stay in your truck"
Bruce twists his lips, seeming to be thinking, and then says "Come with me" He softly picks Steve's hand and guides him to the entry, but they stop behind the doorway where no one inside sees them and Bruce finger touches his lips in a signal to be quiet and listen in secrecy, so Steve concentrates on what is happening inside.
"Rogers!" His radio buzzes and Steve freezes "Rogers, get out of there! The building will collapse on you"
It’s a good start!
And Steve can hear the ceiling falling into pieces right from where they came. No matter where Tony is getting himself into now, they just don’t have the time "Don't go there Tony!" Steve says coming to the man.
"You don't like cornflakes?" Steve asks calmly taking Tony off whatever words war he was having with everyone, he looks at Steve a little confused.
Tony was speechless. As he was about to tell the truth to Bruce, another voice called him.
"It's okay, I'm too. Now my cellphone"
, I won't accept another answer. That's what Coulson would want anyway, don't be so hard on yourself" And just like that Fury pats his shoulder and walks away "That was the first and last pep talk I will give you Captain Rogers, now man up!"
Fury gets up "Rogers" He points to one of the chairs in front of him and then looks up at Tony and narrows his eyes, saying slowly "Leave the plate outside"
Fury narrows his eye to him "Last time I noticed Rogers, I gave the orders"
Wow, he didn't expect Tony to know their names "Yes. Peggy, she was Sharon's older sister"
"Oh God! That's horrible!"
"What happened?" He asks more urgently.
"It's called being nice people"
And Steve ran, he feels the ceiling breaking down just after him like a chase, he runs faster and faster through the pieces of fire he can escape, his mind trying not to think who was left behind under the breaches.
"What? No, I'm just going through the back, there has to be an exit"
"Okay, see you tonight."
"No, not really" Steve says walking to his office, he slows down to hold the folder up "Tony Stark, son of the Mayor. He probably won't be out of here soon"
Steve looked at it in the middle of the smoke and his body acts irrationally for him, making him pick the iron and hit it several times on the metal door screaming in anger. Open. The. Fuck. Up.
She smiles back and nods pointing for him to go to the counter probably to get his breakfast. He goes and crosses his arms over it saying "So what's today?"
"This is part of the job, this is what we signed for" And Coulson voice was so calm, so quiet like he already accepted it. Like he wasn’t fighting it anymore.
when he's thrown by a group of kids down the stairs next to where Bucky was.
Peter cleaned his throat dramatically and walked to the middle of the room, close to Professor Strange.
They take most of the people out in less, Steve is running through a corridor to get out when he finds Tony “Let’s go!” He yells. Tony nods and he’s following but he suddenly stops. It takes Steve too long to notice and when he turns Tony is already trying to walk into another room “Tony!”
"I was trying!"
Tony huffs, and then laughs "God, brag? My self-esteem is practically nonexistent. You’re serious?"
Tony turns to open the door but Steve gets up in a flash and pushes the door shut again from behind Tony "Wait" Steve says trying a more calm approach, Fury words about being a Captain in his mind. Tony sighs and slowly turns, still looking down, an unusual defeated look seen on him.
Steve walks up the firehouse entry, the large letters saying 199 visible on the top of the garage. He passes by the fire trucks and goes directly inside. From there he can already hear the cheerful voices on the living room, it has always made him smile but his feet automatically stop at the hallway, an habit he still hasn’t lost, and his smile fades. He has to turn, look at the wall next to him, look at that photo again and remember all of it once more.
She steps back shaking her head and walks away. Steve receives some more exasperated looks from his colleagues as they walk away until his eyes finally fall on Tony. He's not even looking at him, his face turned to the other side like he didn't want to see something and Steve frowns confused "You okay?"
"Thank god! Finally mother fucker."
"I just pity him" Natasha answers with a sarcastic look and more snorts round the table.
Next day Steve is able to keep himself calm until Tony appears in the doorway, then his heart literally skips and oh how better it is when you’re not aware of it. Now he has no freaking idea how he should act near Tony! Internal groan.
"Loki connect the anchor to the truck, push it at my signal" Steve orders "Thor can you handle Tony?"
"Language" Steve says watching the two men go with amusement.
Steve does not blush at that, at all.
"Joke" Tony says like Steve is stupid, "It was a joke"
And well, seeing Tony walk away with his hands on his pockets, Steve could think that maybe, even with him here, it wouldn't be so bad.
?" Steve interrupts. "From Mayor Stark?!"
"Yes"
Steve looks one last time at that door, making himself mentally sure there's no one to save there and let's his crowbar fall on the ground before running out.
Steve looks confused at where Pietro is under his shower, midway to putting soap around himself "Which fuck?" Steve asks bluntly.
Bruce looked horrified from the hidden Tony to the angry Barnes and from the angry Barnes to the hidden Tony "Please..." Tony mouthed.
"Huh?" Tony turns to him confused "Oh, I'm fine. Never been better! Just saved a life" He smiles.
"Oh my God!" A voice echoes loud in the room, interrupting everyone and almost making Steve jump "Traffic! This city and its shitty roads, what is Howard even doing in that chair? Anyway, good morning guys, sorry I'm late" Tony says giving a tired sigh and walking to Steve, a smile on his lips.
"Being yourself" Steve pats his shoulder. And the way Tony stares at him intensively makes Steve want to kiss him! Damn, could he have a chance?
"You could have just told me that"
"Since the first time I saw you" Steve says maybe a little too angry "I've been inspired by you!" Tony eyes widen at that "The thing about you is that you don't give up! You're an annoying, stupid, stubborn idiot! But a good one at that, because you will do anything to do your job right. You will stay in a building about to collapse, you will throw yourself of a bridge, go back to save a shadow you're only 60% sure you saw and run into a room on fire! That's you" Steve points at him "It's stupid, but it's beautiful. You’re brave and you care and that's all it takes to be a fireman. Fight your father's opinion, stay where everyone hates you, break a rule just to save someone - don't get me wrong, that's so stupid of you - but I still admire you so fucking much! You're a fireman at heart and there is nothing or anyone that will convince me otherwise"
Tony snorts "Well, you never were"
Tony just chuckles a little and says "Okay" Which Steve is grateful for, he hates people making fun of his nonexistent romantic abilities "So about what you said yesterday, about me and the team that is" Tony says putting the picture in Steve's bed "I've been thinking about it"
"One call and he already ignored my
"Mr. Rhodes!" Coulson said worried, running to his side "What is it?"
“Loki, bring the crowbar! Darcy, Jane open the door. Thor, Nat I’ll need your help to-“
"Oh, don't get cocky now fucker! I blamed you too, now we're both grounded."
"..."
"You're a stubborn annoying righteous idiot" Tony says smiling.
"I was the only person there, that could somehow save him" Steve pinches his lips "And I couldn't"
"Good morning!" Steve says maybe too cheerfully.
Taking the money, Loki walked to his brother telling him to calm down, being so subtle while picking Steve's phone from the table that Tony almost missed it. As Loki steered a puffing Thor out of the circle of people disappointed by the end of the almost-fight, Director Fury came from nowhere and grabed Loki by the wrist.
"What is this? A friendly reunion?" Thor got to them laughing.
"Well, Mr. Tony can you please follow me to the Chief's office?" Steve says.
"Oh come on, that was my fault!"
"I like all colors" Bruce says in a voice that leaves no argument as he walks to the coffee machine.
"An F!!!" Peter said dramatically "You gave me an F?! Why did you do this to me?"
"When did the paramedics became receptionist in this place?" Steve asks amused.
That was it.
But Tony is probably too surprised to notice, jumping and looking wide eyed at him "Fuck, I thought he was kidding" Then he looks at himself and curses again. "Shit!" He says trying to push his hair back only doing worse "Damn it!" He groans throwing his head back "Ow misery"
Steve groans "Oh, fuck the rules" And kisses him again. Tony giggles but pulls Steve’s face to his with the same desire, humming in agreement.
"Ouch. You wound me" The man puts a hand on his chest "I'm a fireman. Every seven year olds dream" He mocks.
Steve ignores them, heading to his locker but then Natasha is saying "That seems like a bunch of made up gossip, but knowing Stark it may be true"
"Why the fuck are you the boss and can get late whenever the hell you want?" Clint says turning to him with a grin.
Steve bites his lip to not just kiss that damn idiot and instead picks his hand. Tony seems surprised by the act but doesn't push away, simply looking up at Steve "Think about it. Think about this and come back tomorrow. I believe in you, and we want you there. So I'll be waiting for you tomorrow, show me that stubbornness of you again"
It feels so good, so perfect. Steve's hand clenches on Tony's shirt, as he deepens his kiss, dancing with Tony's lips and wishing it to never to end.
"Please Bruce, I promise I'll make out to you, just run!" Tony whispered.
"Hi Steve" Wanda says without looking up.
"Well, so ask them what’s so wrong about you. They know you better"
"Thank you Chief. Can I ask you something?"
The voice… it's so calm, so reassuring. "Don't give up!" Steve screamed angry.
Steve turns wide eyed at her smirking face and blurs "NO! No, God Nat..."
"Hum, no. Unless you drown them in sugar"
There's silence on the other side, which only makes him more nervous, but he keeps taking the debris out of the way, ignoring if he gets burn. Coulson was inside, everything is on fire, it will collapse! He'll die because Steve is not fast enough, he’s not strong enough, he can't let that hap-
Several faces look surprised at him and Tony breaths out a "Thank you! God, I was starting to think I was the only normal person here"
"Really?! You're gay?"
"You're new in our unit?" Steve says crossing his arms skeptically "The Battalion Chief didn't tell me you were coming"
He jumped back.
"Sure" Tony says too fast. And then a smile starts forming on his lips "God, you're serious?"
"We have a deal of not touching that subject ever again"
"It was my fault".
"Don't be so mean" Steve says "There's a reason I never put any of you cleaning bathrooms"
"Fury talked to me" Tony seems surprised at the change of topic "He also admitted he failed by not talking to me sooner. And the team?" Steve smiles just remembering "They forgive me"
Steve licks his lips and looks around. He swallows and points at a man three pictures behind "Erskine" He says lowly "He was my instructor"
"Mister?" Tony says frowning in disgust "God. What am I, eighty? If I wanted to be called so formally I would present myself as Anthony and
Next morning Steve is looking at Coulson's picture when someone arrives. He's surprised Tony just stops next to him looking at the same picture, but says nothing.
"Exactly. But you're not one to show so much anger for people so easily— and I’m aware that the guy can annoy people just with his own face — but I know you. This is not about Stark is it?"
"Just like that?" Steve says not minding sounding defensive "I don't have any decision regarding having him on the team, know who he is, where he comes from and his experience before including him in?"
"Thirty seconds, Steve"
"Breakfast?" Bruce interrupts them and yeah, that's how Steve ends up in a conversation with Thor while Tony goes lose some battles on Mario Cart with the rest of the fanatics, being a quite calm loser after having bragged so much and Steve just sees himself more and more screwed up knowing he's totally falling in love.
"It was Tony" Steve blurs.
"Can I ask you something?"
"Call me Steve" Because he hates the name Captain, it doesn't belong to him.
Steve smiles at him, Tony looks wide eyed and his cheeks are in an adorable red color that makes Steve want to kiss it desperately.
"What?"
"God can you just shut up and kiss me already?" Tony rolls his eyes but before Steve can laugh Tony hand touches the back of his head and he pulls Steve into a kiss.
"Hey Captain!" A chorus sounds in the table where Sam, Natasha, Thor, Jane, Betty and Wanda are eating breakfast.
It was a brief touch of lips. Steve pushed forward and their lips touched and it just looked like they were made for each other. But it lasts one, two, three seconds and the fact that Tony completely froze was enough to wake Steve up.
"There's nothing between us" Steve says too fast and Tony looks at him with acceptable disbelief. "I mean. It can’t, obviously, when we're in the same truck and I'm her superior. It would be unacceptable, unprofessional"
"Happy for you man." Tony said with a curve on his mouth as true as it could be.
Tony lets the things in his arms go and turns all of his body towards him "I never asked but I was curious about that kiss" Steve eyes widen and he's pretty sure he's blushing. Tony smirk just widens "I thought you liked Sharon"
"What's with the password?"
Now, what was the plan??
"Sure" Bruce says turning to him and pushing up his glasses.
They were sitting beside each other during history class. At the last table of the row.
"There has to be a way!" Steve said looking around for a way to open the door, anything!
But... what did Coulson said to Fury in those last words? It leaves him curious but Steve imagines that it's probably personal.
Breakfast is interrupted by a call, a gas leak in a building but the evacuation went fine and the building was safe without accidents. And during the rest of the day everything was calm until almost the end of the shift...
"I guess, yeah" Steve nods. Then he looks around and turns to him again "I guess I wasn't the only one who needed a push, right?"
"I'm not rude, I'm just honest"
"We're not a gang" Steve snaps turning his head to him.
Tony blinks up at her, then Betty and Jane say "Good morning"
"Ooooh a challenge, this calls for the bet table guys" Darcy says.
"Come on Mr. Rhodes, you have to go to the infirmary."
"You okay?" Steve asks unsure if he should shake Tony out of his mental war.
"Oh my god! Thank you so much Tony!"
And like that, Tony's smile becomes something warm and he says "I'm not silly, stop treating me like a child" and of course, a splash of water is thrown into Steve's face as revenge. Steve closes his eyes and starts laughing, hearing Tony laugh too.
"Oh no. No, no, no" Steve shakes his head. He hasn't even been thinking about Sharon for weeks "It's Tony" He rasps.
"What do you mean?" Steve says even more confused. Bruce was really terrible at explaining himself.
Steve just looks at Fury once, they don't eye each other for more than two seconds but Steve already knows it means 'Tony goes'. Whatever, as long as the man knows how to do his work.
Everything was like it was supposed to be. And yet it was not. Because Steve can feel the tension the moment everyone feels him take a step into the room. He can tell everyone is faking all that happiness, that no one forgot what happened two months before, that all that familiarity is fake. It's really painful, and yet, it's all he has.
Pietro slapped Clint on the head and he woke up looking for the end of the world. Pietro just pointed his thumb to Tony.
"Where did you get that?"
"Yeah, okay. And then more calmly he said what a good Captain you were, the fact you were the only one to ever believe in him and give him a change and how that proved you were a worthy Captain - Jesus man, that was romantic! I can't believe you lost it" Sam interrupts and Steve all but blushes "Anyway, he went in a
"It is me indeed, may I help you?"
As he takes a curve, Bucky is in the middle of the stairs clearly trying to flirt with Romanoff, phone in the back pocked of his pants. Hopefully he still hasnt read it or he would have other priorities.
"Gimme that!" Tony murmured, blushing from head to toe. "Of course not! Give me!"
When he walks back to the main room though, his courage fails. Everyone is there and they all fall silent when he appears except... hum... where’s Tony?
He goes outside two times with people in his arms and returns, and the lookout is done when Fury orders in everyone’s radio “Evacuate, now.”
"Steve, this won't open" Tony says too calmly.
And like in planned unison, every head on the room turns wide eyed at Steve. But Steve, well, he could only mirror his colleagues’ expression. Except for the affront.
"Rogers can you hear me? Stark is alright, he's out. He escaped from the back" Fury says calmly "Get out of there"
Next day Steve is looking at Coulson's picture when Tony and Bruce arrive together, he rolls his eyes for no rational reason and greets them "Hey guys"
"Yeah, about that, can I ask you to delete my text without seeing it?"
"Stark, you should learn to shut up when you can" Sam advices.
Sam sighs and his smile falls again "That's the shit. Last time I saw him, last evening, he was leaving the place without his suit"
They all get up in unison, Steve quickly passing a napkin on his face before running with the others to the trucks, a brief smile passing between him and Tony in the run.
"Fuck!" Steve yells, his eyes are burning "I'll get you out! I'll get you out!"
"Yeah, right" Steve answers and though Tony glares at him, he doesn't reply.
Tony stops and eyes him with disbelief "Do you all take everything I say literally?"
Suddenly the car makes a scratching sound and they see the car rolling forward into the fall to the driveway bellow. Steve eyes widen but Thor, Nat, Jane and Darcy quickly push the car down to stabilize it.
They all get up at the same time and run to the trucks, Steve sits next to Natasha as always but Tony sits in front of him and for several seconds he stares at him unsure if he should say something, do anything.
Tony laughs, and it's quite a beautiful sound "See you tomorrow then"
He sees Tony shrug from the corner of his eye "A little, yeah. Meet him sometimes. He was a nice man"
"The trust has to work both ways, hasn't it?" Steve says, his hand instinctively touching Tony's arm.
There's a burst of laughs around, and Tony rolls his eyes, but with a smile on his lips "Jerk, I'll catch you, you'll see"
"Oh, God Bruce! Bucky did this to you?!" Tony said honestly worried.
Yeah, Tony just walked away from him to go talk with Bruce, but they're obviously closest friends since Tony arrived. Bruce always treated Tony well since that first day while Steve was an asshole, so yeah he kinda deserves the exchange.
Gosh, he has no idea what was happening himself.
Steve's face dropped to disappointment level, "Oh..."
"Hey Stevie, what's up with the new guy?" Darcy asks from where she's dangling in a chair, a lollipop on her mouth.
Tony looks at the hand and twists his lips "That's beautiful Cap, but I'm just not..." Tony shakes his head "I'm not a fireman. I tried times enough"
He finally just gets closer to a random doorman and asks "Could you tell where Tony Stark lives?" And yeah, why wouldn't he know?! He just pointed to a building and Steve thanked him heading to it.
"Tony. It's too late" Steve says calmly.
"Hi Tony..." He says too, too late! And then blushes because when he looks forward Bruce is still there, looking at him with a raised eyebrow and an amused smile.
"Not really"
"... No really, it looks like a snake swallowed this couch. Green and brown, who the hell choose this colors?!"
"No! You had to follow my orders" Steve says to his face "And when I say to get out, you get out!"
"No! But I saw it, we have to make sure" Tony says pointing desperately at the building.
"Oh shut it! Just deal with it Steve, it's not the first time you have a crush on an idiot. Remember when you meet Sam-OUCH!" Bucky yelps when Steve throws him a couch pillow, already sat up.
Whatever. All he wanted now was to be the best Captain ever and prove he was worth of Coulson's legacy, because he always has and always will admire him.
"Is this Sam?" Tony points.
