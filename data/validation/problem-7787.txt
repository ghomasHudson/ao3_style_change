Steve sighed and restarted packing his bag. He hadn’t put so much out of it yet, but it still was a real struggle to fit everything again. “I’m not moving in with him.” He clarified.
“I’m conspicuous. Maybe, I would be a better asset as backup, what do you think? They will know by now what’s going on, if they believe it’s only the three of you, I could probably help better.”
“Yeah, I’ll do it right away. Rest a little, someone will be there at all times. And I’ll come back, promise.” She stroked over his forehead and kissed his cheek before getting up to leave the room.
Tony grinned. “I nearly believe he’s more afraid of you than you could ever be of him.”
“Those people didn’t stay because of money. I know that’s something running in your head, they truthfully like you. You say I’m good with people? Honestly, Loki and Bruce? I would be proud if I could say they talked to me longer than three minutes each, but that would be widely overestimating, but you? They only ever talk to you, longer than three minutes. And no, it’s not because I’m the new kid, I’ve seen it with everybody else.”
“Obadiah, like Obie?” Steve asked curiously.
He shook his head. “I’m not so sure he wants to see me.”
“Love you too, Pep.” He answered, just before she was out of the room. She smiled softly, she had known that before. Tony told them frequently that he loved them, but usually they smiled or gave him a kiss. They all were better with signs than with actual talking. Tony knew that. He liked physical contact, he needed it, more than his friends did.
“I will see you tomorrow Tony… Please, don’t throw your life away.” When the doctor left the room, the conversation they were having before his arriving left with him.
When Steve and Bucky left, Tony was a desolate, mopey mess for three days. Jarvis made a few attempts to get him out of the house, but Tony insisted he deserved the time to be moody. On the fourth day, he stared at himself in the mirror and firmly told himself he would work to deserve Steve.
“I love it when all the recruits turn out to be assholes. Don’t let anyone try and tell you they’re not.”
There was a light laugh on the other side of the line.  “Damn right. And I trust a man who’s never turned on his co-conspirators.”
Steve blushed red, and looked thoroughly conflicted. He politely refused, thanked her for the food, and left before she could ask again. She blinked in confusion, but brushed it off until it occurred to her to ask Tony about it at dinner. When asked, Tony made some remark about how Steve must just hate numbers, but Maria hummed noncommittally. (She couldn’t help but be relieved Howard was away for this discussion.) “He seemed uncomfortable at the offer. I know you pretend to not stand him, but maybe ask him about it, Tony.”
And just like that, Scott was bolting awake and barely squashing the instinct to groan when all his muscles protested at the sudden movement. “Clint Barton? As in Hawkeye? Oh man, I’m a big fan! Why are you calling me? Are we working together? I’m honored but- I thought you were retired!”
Scott had been distracted from his train of thought though, instead calling for any local ants to come to his aid and climbing around with minimal difficulty despite the suit still being in motion.
When Tony was 17, his parents died. Their carriage was destroyed during a trip to the castle, after Howard had cajoled Maria into accompanying him for the first time. Some thought bandits, some magic or beasts, and some blamed Howard for crashing it. Tony had not the strength to contemplate how it happened.
An exception was made on Saturday mornings, since he was the only good cook who’d be awake enough to feed everyone, and man, were his blueberry pancakes magical.
Bucky answered the door, smirked, and left the house with nothing but a call behind him. “Steve, it’s for you.
Scott darted to where Wanda was still standing. “Can you throw me like you did Steve?” When Wanda nodded, Scott pointed roughly to where Natasha was now engaged with hostiles. “At Natasha, please.” Wanda assessed the area briefly, before shifting to angle herself in the right direction. “Brace yourself.”
“I love you more than Dummy loves destruction,” Tony countered, and now Steve was laughing helplessly.
“Sam called you?”
Wanda rolled her eyes again, in a way that made Natasha vaguely proud for some reason, and strode up to the frazzled and incredibly mussed hero before sticking her hand out to shake. Scott responded automatically, smiling before he could think about it. “My name is Wanda Maximoff, or Scarlet Witch in the field. You may call me Wanda. Welcome to the Avengers.”
So when Bucky approached Tony, a couple months after Steve befriended Peggy, to chew the genius out about how he was treating Steve, Tony was ready for a fight.
“You better not be messing with me, Wilson. Are you telling me you know who stopped Darren Cross at Pym Technologies?” Tony was deadly serious, and Sam responded in kind.
Sam’s eyes widened at the videos playing on the holograph. He was watching footage from the fight with Ultron.
“Don't underestimate me,” Scott joked.
“Do you want some help? With… What exactly are you making?”
“Wait, Steve, is he, though? Did you promote him to our boy band?”
“I’m still not getting over that part. Give me some time. And also, what happened to Pepper? Last time I checked they were a couple.” Clint asked.
The billionaire grinned back at him. “You told me a couple of hours ago, that my brain was not working, so… please, dear Steve, explain.”
Bucky frowned and thought about an idea while sipping on his coffee. “Let me think, he is a genius, but still 20 years old, so…”
I didn't even plan the second part of this series when I wrote the first part but now I just can't stop. I wanted to finish with Chapter two but it's completely impossible and now even Chapter 3 isn't the end.
“His name is actually Steve… but details you know, not that important.”
“You gotta stop bulking up, or I need to redo it, because your other arm is too big.” Tony bumped his shoulder.
“I can’t tell you a lot, for now.” Dr. Yinsen started. “I need Tony’s agreement to inform you properly, the only thing I can say… He made it through, already fighting his anesthesia, but he’s very drugged and sleepy. He’s in intensive care, so you can see him, but only one at a time, please? Tony has room to himself, but I don’t want him to get stressed, alright?”
Steve shook his head, remembering the first months of Bucky’s recovering. At first, he cried all night, pleaded to god… not because of his limb but he pleaded to die. He had other injuries that pained him but mostly his limb hurt him, the one missing. For weeks they put him on morphine.
“Calm down. Where are you right now? I’ll come, I don’t like it but it’s for Tony and he’s got other people here, you need me, I’ll be there. I will make a few calls and I get more people on board, people I trust with my life.”
Steve knew that the clever one backed down first, but he just couldn’t, this tactic wouldn’t work on Stane. Someone had to put him in his place. “Say what you have to say or piss off.” He whispered.
“Chris, Mia and Ty. I met them when I just enrolled in the army and over the years we had lots of missions together, now they’re under my command.” Steve sighed. “Mia is the only one in the army that knows about my preferences…”
Well you know just what I mean when I say Grace.
“Man, if you get a haircut, the two of us are fine. You look ridiculous.” Clint answered and the Avengers all laughed out loud.
“Thanks for coming, Doc, I appreciate it, I will take care of him.” With a smile and a nod, the doctor left the two lovebirds on their own.
Tony fell down on the pillows, grinning up into the sky, back to his relaxed self. It was really an up and down with him, but Steve didn’t want and couldn’t blame him for this. Tony was a challenge and Steve was up to the task.
“I asked too. I would probably do the same if I was in the army. I like girls too, so that would be easier for me, but giving your answer I think that’s not the case for you.”
“You want me to call somebody to pick you up?”
“You sure, you’re getting to know him?” Natasha laughed.
“Thanks darling.” Tony smiled and got up from his seat. Time to get back to work.
“Good for me, it won’t be our first.” Tony smiled fondly now. “I know I already told you, but really, thank you. It really was the sweetest and best anyone ever did for me. And it will forever be our first date and today is just bullshit we will have forgotten when we are 80 years old sitting on the deck of our beach house.”
“It’s our couch, so sure you can, I will join you after my conversation with the President.” Tony put his hand on Steve’s cheek. “Stop worrying, we can handle that, okay? We’re the Avengers. We always win.”
Bucky locked up at him and he couldn’t contain his face from not showing surprise. He didn’t think Tony would show up then. He was reading a book, which also had been a suggestion from Tony’s part. He may be a prisoner, for the time being, but at least he should have some comfort.
“I’m sorry Tony. I was angry and mean, and completely unnecessarily unfair to you. I came to apologize. I really don’t want to destroy our friendship. And I wanted to wish you good luck with Steve. You deserve to be happy!”
Steve starred down into Natasha’s eyes. “Bucky?!” He asked loudly, not believing what his friend was saying.
“And Tony is going to refuse, only for the sake of it, and then he will propose another month later.” Clint laughed.
“I hoped the contrary but I was afraid, yes… Some of your behavior indicate exactly that, but I believe you.”
“Yeah, you’re right. Order anything you believe will be necessary and make it fast… please.”
“I know that, don’t worry. One day, it will only be a memory, so why?”
And just like Steve decided not to fight over the money, Tony gave in too, put the blankets over and around him, but only to snuggle at Steve’s side right after, while the latter would feed the two of them with the whole plate he made.
“And now?” Steve asked.
But now he was here, next to him as support. Apparently, he had accepted this was the only way for the moment being but that they still could change it in the future. The government, the people, hell the whole world just needed an assurance that they wouldn’t let an assassin run free.
“You wanna go to bed?” Steve asked.
He should have put Rhodey or Pepper on Tony, to check on him. He was at fault. Tony was in that state because of him. Because he was a piece of shit at being a friend. He failed Bucky and now he was nearly doing the same to Tony. He probably couldn’t save Bucky when he felt but he could have known what would happen to Tony. He was as self-destructive as anyone could be.
“Morning.” He said without an answer yet again. “Tony, we need to talk, about yesterday, but mostly…” He sighed, it really pained him to leave Tony back here alone, which of course he wasn’t but then again, he was a little. “I have to go, I don’t really want to, but the military needs me.”
“Well, Captain Steve Rogers, saved Tony.” Pepper jumped right in before he could answer.
Bucky laughed out. “See, it’s in the middle of the night, why would he be looking for you?”
“Steve, right? Natasha told me you were coming.” Steve scratched his head. Was it creepy he came? What did they think?
Bucky smiled and held out his hand. “Deal.” Tony swallowed once and forced himself to take the offered hand. “But you take care of my friend, alright?” Tony nodded.
Okay, Steve was stubborn too, but not with Tony, at least he thought so. He really always made compromises with him, to keep him happy and let him feel safe, but he couldn’t back down this time, could he? It was a life-depending decision after all, and if Tony couldn’t see it, he could.
“Do you really have kids?” It bubbled out of Scott almost unwillingly, and he was almost taken aback by the suddenness of the inquiry himself.
“I’m Scott, and you can call me Scott.”
Tony pursed his lips faux-thoughtfully, before slowly nodding. "Those seem like good reasons."
Tony hated Peggy. He hated her perfectly waved hair that never got unruly or greasy after a long bender, he hated her pleasant and crisp voice, he hated her clever words and sense of humor that Steve understood, he hated her courage and strength when faced with harassment and belittling, hated how easy it was for her to be kind, her clear morals and goals for societal betterment, and hated how, as much as he envied her, he really struggled to hate her at all.
Scott took a moment to puzzle over where this was going. “Yes?”
Beta'd by dontcallmeking again, though if there is a typo, it is undoubtedly my fault.
“We don’t always play poker, or games in general,” Sam continued.
Wanda smirked. “That’s all we need.”
Yet he was still surprised when the next Sunday Tony appeared at Steve and Bucky’s cabin, flinging open the door and yelling at them for missing their lessons. (Words like “lazy bums” and “troglodyte” were thrown about.) The two had been caught up in their sadness, made more potent with the memories of their years with Maria, and Bucky started to reply with indignation that they couldn’t be late because their lessons couldn’t go on without Maria, but he awkwardly trailed off when Tony fixed him with a solemn stare. “I couldn’t let her down by not continuing your education. She loved teaching you.”
He had just reached a data entry point when he heard the sounds of a battle start outside. Scott just cracked his knuckles and went to work.
Basically, Scott is a treasure and Sam needed back-up.
Scott had been conscripted into the most famous, destructive pseudo-military force in the world and still couldn't tell anyone who asked how he had come to be with them. Not least of all Hope, who somehow still managed to be more terrifying than anyone else he had ever met. And that was including Natasha Romanoff, who he also secretly suspected could conquer a country alone if she ever got bored. At least he seemed to be getting into the good graces of people who knew her better than he did.
Natasha smirked. “This lot can only take losing so much before they start to lose their tempers.”
“It’s possible they won’t if they’re still hung up on the criminal record thing,” Sam commented.
So now here he was, two days after moving in, eating cereal in the Avengers’ communal kitchen at 10 in the morning. It was almost anti-climactic. He had seen other people and staff around the compound, sure, but most of the team, minus Tony, Vision, Wanda and Rhodes, was off on some recon mission to find out what Crossbones’s next target was (or so Scott was told). That’s why Sam had to leave so quickly, he had only even still been there to make sure Scott got around okay. (He probably could’ve delegated the task, but Scott appreciated that he didn’t) The other three were doing other important things, as well. Rhodes was still working for the US Air Force, Vision and Wanda were saving some villages from what seemed to be a giant serpent with a few of Tony’s robots for backup, and the billionaire himself had to make the money needed to keep the Avengers going. Sam had also informed him when updating him on the group’s whereabouts that Scott wasn’t supposed to go on any missions until formal introductions were made, and the group familiarized themselves a bit with his abilities and fighting style.
Friday just went quiet and played a recording. “Perfect, I love talking about breaking international laws with politicians who hate me and want me to fix it when I didn't even get to be part of the fight. And then Steve will want to force them through a debrief, though I guess they'll be sweaty and battle worn, huh? Friday, they should go ahead and wash and relax, tell them that I don’t want a bunch of gremlin law-breakers stinking up my kitchen when I spent all day on the phone with the Nigerian president. Steve will accept a dinner debrief. Not like bureaucracy thrives on speed anyways.”
Tony snorted. “I’m sure you were, you wanted to gloat.”
“You definitely have to take different approaches with and without your gear,” Steve mused from the ground. "A lot less leaping from things." Wanda was currently spotting him in case he fell, and Sam was sitting at the top of a rock wall in a show of moral support.
Tony squawked at the loss of his protective hero and tried to flee behind the table.
“Four,” Scott barked out as he dropped one of the gunmen.
Wanda strode up to him and patted his shoulder. “With flying colors, I’d say. Or flying ants.”
They obviously didn’t quite accept that, so he tried again. “Hey, when you’re the new guy, you try to notice all this stuff.”
He spent a week in his room, jealous and embarrassed and overcome with melancholy in equal measure, only allowing Dummy to stay with him and only allowing Jarvis to come in.  Steve had been rejected from entry to the workshop five times, and as such, was moping dejectedly around the farm. Bucky rolled his eyes when he saw Steve slumped dramatically over one of the water tanks, pathetically doing maintenance.
“Not in the slightest, I’m just worried… Thanks, for opening up to me, I know it’s not easy for you to trust anybody.” Tony pushed his hands under Steve's back.
“Deserved.” Bucky murmured, and even though Steve wanted to say that those were still human beings, even he had difficulties to grant terrorists, and especially terrorists that torture a nineteen-year-old kid, any grace.
“My heart is a bitch.” He put the flowers aside and looked at the comics. “Thanks for these, will make it less boring in here.”
“It’s okay. You spared his life, though…”
“Cap, wait.” Tony called him after they had gotten the information needed from Sitwell.
'Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Slowly, Steve came back to his logical, rational self. His brain must have been in ‘fight or die’ modus. Of course, they couldn’t bring him to another official organization, because Bucky was a killer. At least, he was the face all these victims of HYDRA had seen last. There wouldn’t be a trail, and even if how would he defend himself? No, they needed strategy before they would be going down this road.
“Multiple reasons to be honest. I had a few ideas for my future. The army was the most secure, financially speaking. I was 18 and alone, my parents didn’t really leave much behind at least not enough to pay off college. Another maybe silly reason was that I wanted to honor my dad. He hadn’t really a choice either, grew up poor so he went to the army. He wanted to retire from the army after his last deployment.”
Steve had a hard time listening to the ex-couple and not reacting to it. He heard Tony’s tiredness in his voice. He was sad too. He already knew him to well. And Pepper kept on pushing him to tell her more. Steve had promised Tony that their thing wouldn’t be an affair or a secret relationship, so what exactly was he doing here? Hiding in the wardrobe?  Shouldn’t he support his boyfriend?
Apart from that, he was mostly around Tony in his workshop, drawing and reading a lot. Sometimes he went out for a run, or he acted as Tony’s bodyguard when they went out in public. Although most of the time, they went to see things Steve liked as museums, art galleries or only eating an ice cream.
He knocked on Tony’s bedroom door, and unsparingly, he didn’t get an answer. When he didn’t get a response on the second knock, he opened the door but stayed outside. Tony laid on his bed with his back in his direction, he was typing away on his phone, working again if Steve’s eyes were to believe.
Tony sighed and closed his eyes. “I should have believed Bucky.” He sneered. “You have kind of a thing to make speeches. By the way, I don’t know if that message reached you on one of our talks, I don’t really believe in God, and I don’t understand how you could, you’re a soldier, people are shooting at you, you see young people die… should be the bad guys dying.”
“This is less about wanting than needing, Honey. We need it, and I just want us to be okay for the future. For us, for the Avengers but also for the people who believe that we’re always ready to defend them, and honestly, I’m not sure we are right now.”
Rhodey shook his head. “Alright, Pepper was shaken up when she called me. You should talk to her again. Anyways, I’ll be back as soon as possible and warn your new boyfriend. I’m still having a talk with him and if needed I will put on the suit.”
“Yeah, but with you guys, it’s the same for her. We didn’t break up, it’s just a break, again…” He looked out of the window. “I believe at least.”
Steve knew exactly how to proceed to bring someone back to life. He had done it eight times, only one was successful. Today must be the second. “Come on, man!” He said while pushing his chest. He broke one rip at least, but it didn’t matter. He was trying to save a life. What happened to him? Steve couldn’t smell any alcohol and his eyes only indicated a lack of sleep. That didn’t kill anybody and was probably normal for any student. So, why was this young man dying?
“Congratulations.” Sam said and he really meant it. “Although it would be fair if you give me 100 bucks, I lost my bet but I brought that guy back, so I’m waiting for a little compensation.”
“How about we ask each other some questions, we get to know each other and if there’s an important subject coming up, we can discuss that?” He suggested, after he had stopped starring at Tony and drinking is own hot chocolate.
“No, I tried to talk him into, but he wants to finish his last year. Silly. Stupid.” Tony answered.
“Nope, I have the hottest and most wanted bachelor in the US. I think I won the competition of dating the best possible choice. I don’t even need a price, since I already have you.” He stopped Tony from putting himself down again.
“I just wanted to say hello.” Steve said calmly although he was sure, they could hear that his voice was tense. “I’m going to shower…” He left the room without a further comment of a certain ‘Obie’. He wasn’t comfortable leaving him with Tony in a room but Jarvis and Howard were still there, and they seemed to be way more decent.
“Your engineers? Last thing I knew, they work for us, and I’m just following the plan, that we established with the board, a fucking month ago.”
“Is he being tonyish again?” Rhodey laughed a second. “You think Howard is going to die?”
“Don’t say that!” Steve spit out. “Don’t.” He whispered than. “It’s not. Never. Even just for a day, it’s never a waste.”
“Nat asked me if they could come along, I hope that’s fine?” Pepper asked.
“Tony?!” A loud voice woke him from his thoughts. “Hey, you’re here?” That was Pepper, Steve realized. God, why in god damn’s name was it Tony’s ex. What the hell was she doing here? Oh, right, she totally managed his multi-billion-dollar company. He heard her high-heels coming into the direction of the bedroom.
He cleared his throat when he entered the room and interrupted none other than Obadiah Stane mid-sentence, talking business, apparently that was the only thing he talked about.
That’s how they two spies found them, Sam and Steve still discussing silently about the few words Barnes had said during the day, Bruce already gone to bed, and Tony lying cozily on his boyfriend’s lap that put a blanket on his body and caressed his hair without thinking about the way it looked for their teammates.
“Too loud and conspicuous.” Steve said.
“Not in this life.” He entered the apartment.
“Does he have a motive?” Bucky asked again.
“Thank you.” Steve answered honestly.
“Okay, give me a short version.” Steve said when the doors opened in front of him and he turned left to follow the hallway.
But the real reason, Steve only admitted to himself when he stood in front of the Tower. He desperately wanted to see Tony, to embrace him… He probably wanted to kiss him but even after the four-hour ride on the motorcycle, he could not yet bring himself to ditch deeper into those feelings. He had to shut them down, even if it was just for the time-being.
“Yeah, I wouldn’t sleep either with all that caffeine.”
Tony cuddled into his pillow. “Still a team effort.” He yawned once. “I’m trying to save him, Steve but our best chances are finding proof for his brainwashing and getting on Russia’s good side.”
Steve had hoped for longer sleep but Tony woke just in time for the dinner. “Nightmare?” He asked, when he saw the confusing in Tony’s eyes and his fast breathing.
“My apologies to interrupt you, Sirs but I must inform you of the arriving of two visitors.” JARVIS interrupted their conversation. “Mr. Wilson is down in the lobby. He wishes to speak to the two of you.”
“Well…” Steve wanted to play it down and not make Tony feel bad about his behavior yesterday, especially since it ended with both of them falling asleep together. But he decided against it, he backed down yesterday for the ‘greater good’ and if he wanted it to work between them he would have to show Tony when he was crossing lines. “Yeah. Yeah, you would have, your bad.”
“Bruce just wanted to give me a history lesson, wanna join? He wanted to talk about the Nazis that didn’t want to be Nazis.”
Steve sighed and made the last painful point to Tony. “And what do you do, if he doesn’t wake up? There is a big chance he’s staying like this forever.” He took a deep breath. “I hate to be the one to shout it in your face, but Tony if you wanna save yourself and the company you know the right way to do so. He might die, Tony and you cannot change his state, but you can change yours.”
Weeks passed quickly. Tony ate healthily, went to his check-ups - all thanks to Steve - and he prepared himself for the operation in the near future. He did some sports, only what was allowed and Steve was a pretty good trainer.
“Nothing new, I hope our two spies are going to find something if not, we might have to ask other specialists for help, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists… It’s not really my domain.”
“Maybe. Tony has been trying more and more to go his own way. Well, he used to, before the abduction. Now, the only thing he does out of his free will is his prosthetics program, which Obadiah allowed just because it’s for his PhD.” She took a sip out of her coffee, that after the look on her face, most definitely was already cold.
“You can start to hope.” Tony confirmed. “And I swear to god, after this mess, you and me are going to therapy.”
Tony snorted shortly. “Another trauma.” Another snort and he let out a dry laugh.
“Okay.” Steve gave in. “Thank you, and I look forward to keeping you company.”
Tony heard a pained try to breathe from Steve. He lowered the gun. “Go.” He said and with one last glance at Steve, Bucky Barnes ran away and Tony didn’t take another look at him. With three steps he was by Steve’s side and he kneeled down next to him.
That last one hurt. Tony and Steve. Nobody was supposed to be left alone. Tony snorted. “Well then, goodbye Ms. Potts. Next time, before you enter, knock the fuck on the door.” He answered and wanted to end that conversation.
“To do what exactly?” He asked.
Steve was just happy that Tony wasn’t having an anxiety attack and it also didn’t happen during the day, even if a lot of people were sitting around them. Steve and Bucky put the genius in the middle of them and Bucky looked far more impressive than he should with his prosthetics which Tony had given a metallic design.
“Steve, honey. You’re the best. No need to pay. I told you, choose the place, what you did, and I pay. Even if I imagined something else. Really no worries, okay? Eat something.”
Steve reacted fast. He still remembered how insecure Tony had been when he hid away in the closet. “We are.” He declared. And at least that brought a little smile into Tony’s face. His lips didn’t move a lot, his eyes softened, his little wrinkles showed up and Steve knew they would be alright. Maybe not today, but soon enough.
His former butler needed a strangely and unusually long time to answer. “Sir, I need to inform you that your father was hit by a car and is currently staying in hospital. He hasn’t been responsive and unconscious since the accident. I would propose to you to come to New York City as soon as possible, Sir.”
Sam bumped his shoulder, which hurt his fingers a little but he had too much pride to show it. “Captain America just asked me if I want to be an Avenger, man.” He shook his hand. “Course I want, do I get a floor in the tower?” He grinned into Tony’s direction.
A little smile appeared on Tony’s face. His eyes were closed, they were clearly hurting him and they would even more in the morning but Steve would take care of him. “I know you always find a solution Tony, that’s what you do… But this time you’re not alone. I’m here and all the Avengers. Maybe Thor will show up, he’s pretty good when it comes to cheering people up.”
“I didn’t!” Steve clarified. He would never approach a person that was in a relationship. Maybe it all happened fast after Pepper but that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. He couldn’t imagine Tony alone in that mess. “Let’s go back to the job. Nat, Clint? Anything from your contacts in Russia?”
Plus, he didn’t really care that much about anybody’s opinion anymore except for Tony’s. Maybe it was dangerous getting too close to him within that short amount of time and the situations both of them were in right now, but Steve cared less and less every day.
Tony snuggled closer and closed his eyes. “I’m tired.” He mumbled. Steve laid his arms around Tony’s body and held him close.
This is a pretty long fill-in chapter, there's not a lot of plot happening here. It's pretty much only there to built up the stories of the characters and really getting into the main subjects of the story.
Steve smiled up to him, while picking up all the boxes from the floor. “It doesn’t feel like it, you know? Strangely enough, I feel like I’ve known you for a very long time.” He didn’t give Tony a chance to answer because he made his way to the little room next to the kitchen where he had found the garbage cans.
“Tony, I need to talk to you, before we go…” Cap took Iron Man’s shoulder and held him up.
Rhodey nodded. “They gave me two days, though.”
Tony laughed while putting the bread covered in cheese in his mouth. “That’s why there was money under the tablet.” He laughed again. “They are paid just fine, Steve. Don’t worry, I’m a good person, usually. They don’t take money that lays around. You could even write their name on it, and they still wouldn’t take it.”
“Hey, Stevie.” Bucky murmured softly into his ear. “You worked yourself up again, huh? You could have told me, I didn’t necessarily need to see my physio this morning. I could have been here from the beginning.”
Tony sighed. “’m not hungry, …teve.” He murmured.
And seeing Tony like this, after a week of hospital food, enjoying what he prepared, smiling and giggling… That was something he wouldn’t destroy even for peace upon the world, because this right here must be heaven. It was Steve personal heaven.
He didn’t need a shovel talk. He would do alright. They would do alright. Tony was sure that Steve and him where made for each other. They would always find a way because now they had each other. And if there was something coming for them, they would be ready to face it, together.
“Yes.” Tony answered. “You think I’m dumb, but I’m not. My mother died, she had the same condition, not even as serious as it is for me. They operated her, to correct the cardiac defect, but they failed and she died. She could probably have lived with it, you know… But the doctors talked her into the operation.”
“The last time, I ate and it stayed inside was five days ago. I tried eating, I swear and then Natasha called and I didn’t want to risk anything.”
“Fuck, fuck!” He murmured. Steve was now close enough to hear him. “Not now, not hear.” The man said again.
Pepper shrugged, they all have had those thoughts, they still hadn’t found a solution. “There was never a demand for money.”
“You, boy!” Stane shot at Tony, only taking his eyes of Steve for a few seconds. “You stop giving instructions to my engineers!”
“Hi handsome.” He whispered to Steve.
“Let’s give it a shot.” Tony crossed his legs and tapped once on the bed. “Take that tight jacket off and have a seat.” Steve just followed his direction and helped Tony sat up the game right after. “I will be kind to you. We can play without a clock.”
Around midday, after having a long breakfast thanks to Steve, they found themselves in Tony’s bed. The smaller man snuggled into Steve’s chest the second he had laid down. Immediately, Steve put an arm around the man to hold him close.
Traduction:
“Well, we’ve got some news for you too.”
“I’m using the suit.” Rhodey answered with a death serious face. Steve swallowed once next to Tony.
Tony hugged him. No words needed, at least not for this, greeting his friend, because that’s what Bruce was, a great friend. They kept in contact, hell, Bruce was the only one that accepted his offer to live in the Tower. He was still traveling through the world, sometimes he still felt like a fugitive.
“Well, actually…” Bucky laughed which made even Steve smile a little.
“Iron Man did.” Tony corrected his teammate. “Cap. I know we didn’t have a great start, but I wanna help. Fury was an asshole, but he was a good one. Plus, these guys do have access to my tech.”
Tony grinned. “Nice to see you too, Cap. How has Washington been so far, not so good right? You two should have stayed in New York.”
“Nope.” Tony answered fast. “I’ll go home, could be the last time I see home, okay? I promise I won’t do anything dangerous. I just want my bed, seeing my dots one last time, my Dad and my friends. I’m leaving when you bring me the papers, I’m feeling good, perfect, really.”
Only late at night, when he laid awake in bed, Steve realized that in fact, he probably could manage being openly gay in the army if he knew Tony was waiting for him at home.
“It wasn’t planned, okay? And it didn’t happen until last week.”
“Where does all of this even come from?” Tony wondered when he dipped a piece of bread into the cheese.
“Maybe, but I’ve heard your friends talk about you, I hear Bucky and Nat talk about you. You saved Bucky in a way no one could, and I’m sure the other guys getting a prosthetic thanks to you would say the same.” He smiled softly. “I know you, Tony Stark, maybe better than you know yourself.”
“I don’t understand your question.” Steve stared at the man.
When Steve came back, he met the others just outside Tony’s room. Nat had been the last to come out of the room. She had just closed the door behind her.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Man, I can’t believe I will lose my bet because I’m one of the good guys. You’re an idiot, Cap. Tony found you, and he fucking kneeled next to you and held your hand until the ambulance showed up. They nearly had to drag him away.”
Steve smiled back to his boyfriend. “Fine by me. You protect me, I protect you. And this thing, or however you want to call this between us, won’t end. You’re stuck with me, Stark, forever.”
“I made pancakes for the team. I still have some batter, want some?”
“You had your chance.” Tony answered and closed his eyes. Pepper realized, that he was probably way to sleepy and would most likely forget that she even said something, maybe she needed to repeat it another time.
“You left me… Maybe in the time, I needed you the most.”
Steve was the first to fall asleep when they just started the third movie, while Tony refused stubbornly to even think about falling asleep since he was enjoying the closeness between them way too much to give it up for a little sleep.
“No, no. I’m going alone, you should spend some time with Bucky or Sam…” Tony slowly got up.”
Steve stepped closer to Tony, which was difficult since they were already pretty close to each other already. He put aside a streak of hair hanging into Tony’s forehead. “I only knew you through Bucky and Nat’s stories but something is telling me that you are changing.” He said with a silent and comforting voice. “And it sounds great by the way, maybe not a beach house, though.”
As weird as it felt, Steve smiled. It was good to know there were people having Tony’s back and that he was right when he told his boyfriend yesterday that he wasn’t alone anymore. Even if right now it was against his childhood best friend.
“But he’s doing his second doctorate?” Bucky smiled at him.
“Right now?” Tony asked, starring her down. “It’s you. I will do what I need to do, but as I said, right now other things are more important. Things that are none of your business. Okay, and now, I want to go back to sleep, watch whatever bullshit I can find and enjoy my life for a small amount of time. Thank you very much.”
“You want me to get up for spanking?! Like right now?!” Steve shook his head and grabbed Tony by his armpits. He must force him then.
Without saying anything else, he pushed the bottle nearer to his friend. Tony tried his best version of puppy eyes, which usually where quite effective but Steve wouldn’t forget the image of his body so soon, plus his eyes still looked like hell. Steve just turned away. “I have some crackers for you and some porridge…”
“The least I could do.”
“You believe in God?” Tony asked silently.
“What happened then?” Steve asked, trying not to picture the situation in his head.
“It really isn’t.” Bucky objected.
The door slid open and Steve met total chaos. More than usually. Nothing seemed in order, it was even difficult to walk without stepping onto something. It smelled too, after… Well Steve had no idea, probably sweating, maybe some old coffee, motor oil. The combination was terrible and Steve hated his ‘super-smell’ very much in that moment. It was more terrible than Hulk’s breath or Hawkeye’s socks. It was atrocious to describe it short.
Bruce sighed. “Don’t get me wrong Cap… I do trust you; I really do… But he’s your best friend and you thought you lost him, I’m not sure you’re rational enough.”
Tony wasn’t surprised when he found that Bucky was awake. He wouldn’t sleep either if he was held captured in a place he didn’t know while people scanned his brain and asked him weird questions. And although Tony knew they were doing it for him and that it certainly was better than anything HYDRA did to him, he couldn’t stop his mind from comparing this situation to him being captured in that god damn cave.
“I ship it.” Sam decided.
“Wow, at least I’m not banned on the couch!” Steve answered sarcastically. When he heard a door shut close, he groaned loudly. “God, you’re going to be the death of me, Stark!” He pushed himself off the couch and walked down the hall to find his sleeping place for today.
I swear I lived'
“Good morning, Miss, Sirs.” He greeted the people. Pepper smiled up to him.
“Until my heart doesn’t want to jump out of my chest every time I see you.” Tony laughed. He wasn’t sure he could take it to come down here again. Steve just gave him a great excuse to flee.
“Oh, I’m sorry, Mr. Stark, I thought we separated in friendship.” Tony sat up on his bed, looking around and wondering where Steve had wandered off. He sighed and shook his head.
Bucky raised an eyebrow. “It’s you, or not? I remember how in the morning he stood there, little Stevie right in front of you…”
He had disliked the uniform, as did Steve from time to time. That was their connection, they both disliked Captain America, in different ways and forms but they both seemed to like Steve Rogers.
Tony smiled. “Yeah, I cannot either, I’ve got work too. Not only Barnes but also that StarkPhone I promised the people…”
For a moment, Steve saw how the doctor wanted to push Tony to stay, reason with him. But then he just nodded. “I’ll bring you some papers. You need to take some pills, though. A nurse is going to free you from the bags and the dots on your body.” He sighed and took a really deep breath. “Please be careful boy, I want you to live, okay?”
Tony shrugged. “Got me a project for my PhD and an idea to where I want to go with SI when I take over.”
“I had a Fantasy Football league at boarding school, although mostly people outside of my school took part. It’s all maths, so I’m good at predicting when I know the numbers.”
“Just give me a burger before Doc Yinsen comes to rip my head off.” Tony laughed.
“As you wish, Captain.”
Steve shook his head. “You really never listen to me. It was not that kind of monologue. As I said, I wanted to thank you… Anyways, first you have to get back on track.”
There were two cars, adding the one he just drove, Tony must have three. There was that big workbench and in the middle was a huge table with three monitors and a laptop. To his right was a couch assembling and a TV, a little kitchen place. Steve was sure behind one of the doors was a bath, so Tony could pretty much live in here.
“But when he turns twenty-one, he will not only automatically be CEO but also head of R&D.” She continued. “They have a contract, I don’t know exactly how, but Obadiah is going to lose his CEO status and is only going to be a member of the board, although I think he’s holding about 20% of shares alone. Tony has proclaimed in a few important occasions that he’s not going to keep on doing weapons factory forever. He has great plans and Howard supports him, Obadiah, not so much.”
“Not as homesick as I’ll be.”
“You play golf with the President?
He didn’t have to wait long, as Tony made it to the compound in 15 minutes flat. He didn’t bothering asking how Tony knew where he was and simply grinned as the man released the armor and made his way to Sam.
“Of course man, that’s your kid. The only time she wouldn’t be allowed to visit you is if she’d be in danger or if no one was around to be with her,” Sam almost sounded insulted, but Scott refused to feel bad and loudly continued speaking over the interruption.
“Friday keeps the calendar for us. Wanda is next, and apparently has a movie already planned, but you get the pick after her, as the next newest member,” Steve finished.
Tony clutched the note to his chest and struggled with the waves of emotion buffeting his frame. Steve would never lie to him, and here he was talking about loving Tony forever, like it was as much of a given as the sun rising each day or Dummy knocking something when he got excited.
“You won’t regret this,” Sam said cheerfully, his smugness broadcasting loud and clear over the phone.
Scott snickered quietly while Hank turned on Hope with an insulted expression. There were few people who could cut to the core of things and call you out on your behavior like Hope could. She was merciless, and while it could be hard to deal with sometimes, Scott appreciated it more times than not. This was one of the moments where he enjoyed it.
“Do you ever stop being afraid of something happening to them because of you?”
How could he not have realized? How could he have been so blind? He had desperately wished for Steve’s affection for years while simultaneously pushing him away, blind to his own yearning. Rhodey had even tried to tell him, but he had ignored it. For years- YEARS! He had been gravitating around Steve like the sun. Steve was who he thought of when he woke up, Steve was who he wanted with him forever, and Steve was the only person who could make him flustered.
Rhodey’s challenge turned out to be both blessedly straightforward and completely exhausting. “I guess this test is typical of a military man, with their love of these courses,” Scott called out from his tenuous place clutching the bars on the ceiling. Turned out the climbing course from the other gym had more components that were usually hidden when not in use. He had scaled a rock-climbing wall, climbed ropes (Sam had laughed when Scott pointed at the rope that dropped from the ceiling and smugly informed him he “totally called it,”), dodged projectiles, gone across the rafters, and had generally scaled a number of other intimidating barriers once already while in the suit, and was currently trying it without the suit.
Steve waited for a moment, probably expecting more to that, but Tony cut himself off. There was a quiet that settled over them, not uneasy, but somehow heavy with things Scott couldn’t even hope to understand yet. (Or maybe ever.)
Tony waved a dismissive hand. “Team effort.”
When Bucky returned to the farm with grief in his eyes, without his left arm, and with Steve’s shield in his right, Tony remembered how Steve threw himself in front of blows meant for another, how he fought off the people who would torment him, and how he sat with Tony when his parents died.
He resolutely set about to improving his appearance, as that was one of the few traits people always seemed to appreciate, and knew that his intellect was his next best bet to keep Steve engaged. (Sure, his brain got him in trouble constantly, but Steve had always been weird.)
Scott paused confusedly. “Pirate?”
It wasn’t till someone mentioned flight that Scott’s attention was brought back to the meta-humans. “Wait, Wanda flies too?”
Crossbones bucked against Steve’s hold, who adjusted his grip to better immobilize the criminal. “I’ll go ahead and keep a hold on him, just to be safe,” Steve commented dryly and Scott nodded. “Probably for the best.”
“How do I hurt more than I did after Lagos?” Scott moaned into his room’s couch where Sam had ungracefully deposited him.
“God, if I wasn’t such an idiot we could have been doing this ages ago,” Tony breathed, greedily pressing kisses against all the exposed skin he could find.
His excitement had been too much for the still grieving Steve to handle, so their first meeting went poorly by anyone’s estimation. Tony was animated in his initial greeting, though he reigned his energy in slightly when his mother reminded him to, but Steve was silent through the introductions, overwhelmed and grim with the understanding he was alone in the world. Tony tried to rally through it, and took Steve on a tour of the farm, peppering his disinterest with the farm with colorful commentary. They had just reached the barn, where Dum-E was waiting excitedly, when Steve stopped. “Please. Please just… Stop.”
Steve cut in before Scott could respond. “Wanda go regroup with Scott, I don’t need the backup.” Scott could’ve sworn he felt Rumlow’s angry snarl when he heard Steve say that, and braced himself for the fight to intensify.
Sam did not have the energy or the will to deal with that mess today, so he chose to disregard the statement and continue with what he came to deal with. “So I’ll let Tony know about the potential new member, while you look over his file. I’ll probably send him a copy after I talk to him, but I’ll wait for when you give me the go-ahead to forward copies to everyone else.”
“Hey, Scott. The name is Clint.”
“We have plans to find my Mom.”
Steve wasn’t able to contain his sigh. “Tony, I don't want to tell you what to do-. We appreciate you covering for us in Lagos, and for taking care of the team. No,
Tony, Steve, Natasha, Sam, Rhodes, Wanda, and Vision all had a scheduled day of the week on which they chose the group’s dinner. Originally, just the five active members were going to choose, but Steve suggested making it an even seven, and surprisingly to the group, original members excepted, Tony was quick to agree to join in. When away on business, Rhodes had the others vote on what to do or asked Friday to order delivery from a place with a high rating on yelp. Vision didn’t have taste-buds or a preference, so on his days Wanda would cook, and when she didn’t feel like cooking, Friday would help research and find interesting things the group had yet to try, all per Vision’s request.
As he slunk out of the room, he faintly heard “Just not enough of us…” and knew what he had to do.
Tony clapped his hands together, the metal clanging. “Perfect. Then I’m right on time,
“God, don’t remind me I have to be ready for that,” Scott whined. “When is this happening?”
There was a beat as that sunk in, and Steve shot to his feet. “Team, grab your gear to meet in the Quinjet in fifteen minutes. I’ll brief you all during the flight. Natasha, Wanda, you’ll be wearing passable civilian clothes, Sam, go ahead and get in full gear. Bring Redwing. I’ll be in uniform.” The group accepted the orders and went to leave, breakfast now forgotten.
Steve looked pleasantly surprised by the sudden admission, and the smile that grew on his face reminded Scott of how beautiful the man was (objectively speaking, because Scott was NEVER going to go down that road, no way. Crushing on Captain America was not for him. Far smarter men than him have made that mistake, he was sure). Tony seemed unable to look away.
Steve wisely chose to ignore the outburst. “There's an ATM on the south corner, which means?”
-----
“Given up on introducing yourself as James?” Natasha commented.
“Oh man, the pleasure is me! Mine. The pleasure is mine. Sorry, it’s been a long day.”
Sam and Natasha feigned hurt. “Did you hear that, Cap?”
Tony brandished a finger in her direction while still mid-retreat. “Exactly, you behemoth, you are not representing the Greek brand correctly, set me
Steve understood why Jarvis had been keeping people away when Tony blearily lifted his head and croaked out, “Steve?” He was obviously toasted, and Steve felt his heart break. No one could ever be ready for death, and Tony had lost both his parents abruptly. Steve could understand the complicated emotions of grief though, and what it was like to mourn both the person who loved and raised you, and the parent who wasn’t ever good to you. (Steve had few memories of his Father, but he remembered his Mom crying and his Father screaming.)
“I can make lists upon lists of moments that reminded me that I love you, though I don’t know the moment it began.”
“What, Pepper isn’t welcome to stay here too?” Scott could see Tony’s teasing smile from his angle, but he didn’t think Steve could see it quite as clearly. He hastily jumped to clarify.
Scott flinched like receiving a body blow.
“Don’t think less of him for this, blame that friend of yours who got to him first.” Sam, without even attempting to hide his delight, addressed Rhodes.
“Sam, you were the one that explained the mission nickname,” Steve cut in amusedly.
But because everyone knew Steve was the mastermind behind the attack, word got to Red Skull about the leader of the group who destroyed his favorite prison.
“But that’s the problem! You’re just fine.” Natasha was getting irritated by now.
Her smile was genuine despite the pointed way she introduced herself, and Scott figured he should reciprocate. “I’m Scott Lang, and I adopted the Ant-Man alias from Hank Pym.” He froze for a moment. “Not sure if I was allowed to tell you guys that.”
Tony really wanted to hate Steve. It was easier to blame the intruder for being the reason he didn’t get along with his father then to accept that Tony could do nothing to overcome his father’s resentment.
“Keep your board in line.”
“Not every test, but on some of these tests we want to check your general mental or physical preparedness. Being an Avenger is about more than fancy tech and superpowers,” Steve explained with the patience of someone used to and passionate about the subject.
He made it to the building right when Steve crashed through a window, hitting both a wall and the ground painfully hard.
Happy sent him a dour look. “If that’s all, boss, I’m going to get back to town to finish up.”
“Only me?”
“Also…” Here he paused. Sam waited patiently, pretty sure of what Steve was about to say. “You should make sure that Tony is aware we’d have a new member to fund and shelter here.”
“Tony, would you want me to apologize for leaving? For not- for not bringing him back?”
Long after Tony had fallen asleep and Jarvis had returned, Steve reluctantly got up and left, sure Jarvis would take care of the boy and remembering how he need time to recover in private after those first waves of grief. If Tony didn’t leave the workshop soon, he’d come back to try to comfort him again.
Tony blew up his cheeks. “Well, let’s start our ‘Welcome in the 21st century lesson’ with this, don’t ever use that word again, and I mean it ever. And also any other words you probably learned. We say homosexual or gay. Avoid anything else.”
Steve starred into his eyes. That was the same man that had cried for an hour last night? Now, after having a short panicking moment, he was more logical and rational than Steve? And that while the man that initially brought him back into his nervous state Steve found him a week ago, was only a couple of floors away? What the hell was happening, was he dreaming? “Bring them up, JARVIS.” Tony ordered.
“When people say that Tony is a genius, they don’t mean a kid that’s great in maths, okay? He’s like Einstein, Elon Musk and… mh Stephen Hawking… but more like in one person?”
“No pain, just not as much genius as usually, very tired. Hey, were you the only one here?”
“Me. Yeah. I’m the lucky one.” He sighed. “We have to talk. Clint and Natasha took the quinjet to Moscow to meet up with a whistleblower and they may have a lead to a HYDRA base in Siberia. Bruce is still looking for options and Sam talks to Bucky.”
“Yeah, sure. Whatever you want, kid.” Tony took a sip of his coffee. His very first in one week and Steve couldn’t decline him that one. “But for now, we need to solve the other problem.”
Les Champs-Elysees - Joe Dassin
“He’s here. Down in the Hulk room. Clint and Nat are in Russia, trying to find something about the brainwashing. Bruce is working down in the lab to heal him. Sam is talking to Bucky to find more information. Steve’s running in circles, more because of me than because of Bucky.”
“You don’t wanna tell me since when you’re fucking Cap?” Bruce blurred out, while he was analyzing Barnes brain scans and Tony started to read everything he could find on brainwashing.
“Deal.”
I had to fall to lose it all
Tony turned back to him. “That’s by far the sweetest thing somebody ever did for me… And that after I was so bitchy to you…”
Wait, was that actually Tony Stark? How did the doctor know his name? “He’s back!” A paramedic said after they had shocked him for the third time. “Ok, let’s stabilize him and then go. I’m sure Dr. Yinsen wants to have a closer look at that bitch of a heart.” Steve watched how they put an oxygen mask over Tony’s face, how they put him on a stretcher and brought him into the medical car.
Tony shrugged but smiled, thinking of the fond memories he created since with Clint. “Well, I hit on him once, and he turned me down and just a week later you showed up with Nat and him. I had to hate him on principle.”
“Me neither.” Steve answered fast.
“I wasn’t a popular kid. I was fascinated by it.”
Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
“Wait, do you mean if I wasn’t bitchy yesterday, I would have seen this already?” Tony set down his mug to go check on Steve directly.
The things that I did
'Oh, home, let me come home
“I just talked to Dr. Yinsen, because…” She shuttered a little. “Y-you didn’t look so well, so I thought, I would have a look. He says everything is fine for now.”
“How did you meet Rhodey?” Steve decided to go into easier territory to calm Tony more down. He didn’t want to risk a panic attack, when they talked to much about Bucky.
“What?” He asked, when no one explained why they spoke to him in the first place.
“What is it this time? Loki again? The Mandarin? The military? HYDRA… And yeah thanks for calling for help.”
“Hi, Pep.” He murmured back.
Tony scratched his head. “Well, he might be a serial killer with a strong metallic arm.”
Sleeping on the chair wasn’t a problem for Steve. It was way more uncomfortable than Bucky’s couch that much he had to admit, but he wasn’t complaining. If necessary, he could sleep while standing up and bombs flying over his head. Hearing Tony’s breath and the little sounds his heart monitor was making, was oddly calming and he fell fast asleep.
“Nobody did. When the public started to wonder where I was, Obie told them I was taking some time off, because I worked too hard in the last time.”
Ganz egal wo wir sind
“That’s unfair, Rhodey.” Tony sighed. “I will forever be graceful… But I don’t know, okay? It’s fucking risky and I rather have six months than nothing.”
Tony was straight forward with everybody, so people hadn’t such a hard time to just spill into his face what they thought, if it was nice or not didn’t matter. Steve had been baffled by the way Tony had introduced himself on the helicarrier. Intentionally showing everybody the picture, they wanted to see. An ignorant, arrogant and sarcastic man, everybody disliked.
Steve nodded once and let go of his friend to sit back on his place. A little ashamed of his outburst, he only waved at the rest of the group.
On Friday, his mood changed yet again. Bucky came over because he got his first prototype for his prosthetics. All three of them set together in the workshop, Bucky’s stump had been prepared for weeks now, only waiting for the final results.
“Very grown up from you.” He answered cheekily.
The raise of his voice apparently helped Tony wake up. He looked up for longer than a glance and stared into Steve’s eyes. “You swore.” He stated.
“Might?” Bruce demanded.
“IT’S AUGUST!”, Tony screamed from the bathroom, when the man had just disappeared again.
“Nope, you wouldn’t.” Sam declared, and Bucky nodded enthusiastically in agreement.
“You want to go to therapy?” Steve whispered. His voice had been soared since last week. He hadn’t cried or screamed but it just seemed as even his body couldn’t keep the stress out of the system and it showed off with common cold symptoms, which Tony honestly found a little cute and adorable but he would never tell Steve that only felt miserable and weak.
“Want some fries?” Clint asked and shoved them into his space.
Steve got up from the bed and held out a hand to pull Tony up. “Says the man that didn’t want to put on a sweater because it’s August.” He rolled his eyes, but the grin on his face just wouldn’t disappear and all of sudden Steve knew why he fell in love with Tony. He finally was himself. He felt like Steve Rogers again.
As usually in Tony’s life just when he was about to do or say something important, he was interrupted. His phone rang, and naturally he could just ignore it and go on, but it was Jarvis ringtone and he never ever would deliberately ignore this man.
“Barnes killed my parents.” Tony declared. “Or rather, HYDRA forced him to do so. And last week, he saved Steve’s life, just minutes after he intended to kill him. I saw him, and I pointed a gun directly in his face, I wanted him dead. He stood there, just watching me… He didn’t try to escape. He didn’t attack me, while I stood there, able to shoot any second. He ran away, when I told him to. He was ready to die. Maybe you can’t trust Steve on this, but I assure you, I don’t have any reasons to protect him.”
“Well, my experience with men mostly happened when I was in my teens and my twenties, I wasn’t really into something specific… after that I was mostly with women, and if then there was a dominant, it was me, so I never tried.” The billionaire answered when he had followed Steve into the kitchen.
And just when Steve wanted to reassure her that both her friends would be fine, he saw how the doors opened where he last saw Tony disappear in. They all jumped up when Dr. Yinsen walked up to them.
“Yeah, I’ve met them. I thought you stopped doing weapons?”
“Any ideas?” Sam asked.
“I did, yeah. Seems to care a lot about you.”
Tony, on the other hand, stared at the ceiling. The noise was getting to him. Last night, he had still been unconscious but now, he was wide awake. No sleep to come. Only him and his thoughts.
“Money, why else? Didn’t that thought ever cross your mind? Even just for a second?”
On the same evening, he found himself in Buckys apartment. Together with Natasha and Sam. The latter had told them about the incident on the campus. “Wow, Stevie. You really can’t have a normal day.” Bucky laughed and gave him a beer.
“I know.” Steve let out a breath. “I hate that.” He stared back into the direction the ambulance disappeared into and wondered if Tony would be alright. He was dead for a couple of minutes. This clearly could happen again, right? He needed to know, if Tony was okay. Stark Industries had contacts to the military, he would find out about Tony’s well-being, maybe Bucky would know something.
“What?” Tony asked stupidly.
“Hey, you’re back.” Clint laughed. “Ugh. You bought flowers.” He made a face at Steve. “Dude, I mean, it’s sweet and all, disgustingly sweet. But, isn’t this kinda, too much?”
While Obadiah started whispering to the security guys, Howard Stark came up to them. He looked at Steve. “You’re a friend?” He asked curiously, but with a tired voice.
“So, where is my present?” He changed the subject.
“Yeah, he did. Tony basically uninvited him. He said he would only get more anxious if he knew his dad was running around the hospital. And I had the impression he didn’t want to have his uncle around.”
They got him in that helicopter back to a hospital, where Steve was again sitting in a waiting room and praying to God to save his best friend’s life. It was worse than with his mom. He had prepared for her death, but Bucky… In the morning he had been joking around with Steve, playing football with the rest of the company when they got their mission call.
“What?” Tony’s best friend sounded alarmed. “Is Tony alright? Is he back in hospital? Why didn’t he say anything?”
The good thing was, nobody fought that day. If he wouldn’t have been in a military camp, he would have described the day as oddly peaceful. He had sat on his cot, finally reading Harry Potter for the first time (Bucky had sent it as a present), while his friends had been playing cards next to him.
And then he had been on that hospital. Praying, crying, before sobbing again, sniffing from the snot running out of his nose. He had puked a few times on this day, every time he recalled the memory of Bucky on the battlefield bleeding out of where there should have been his arm.
Bucky shook his head, taking the last bite of his toast with peanut butter. “No, I like it, but what you’re bringing?”
“You can, if you want. But I’ve got work to do…”
He was too slow to catch him, and he fell onto the ground. Steve gasped forward, but the harm was already down. “Hey, man! Wake up!” He said, while feeling his pulse and trying to make out if the man was still breathing. “Fuck, fuck. These things only happen to me.” He murmured while he opened the buttons of his sleeve. He saw a group of students just starring at them and he nearly jumped.
“Great! I still want that compensation and you gotta have a look on my wings.”
“What do you want to see, Tony?” Steve interrupted. “The deal was you could do what you want if you eat enough breakfast. So, show me what you like.” Tony smirked and looked up to him. Yeah, Steve really would have to work on his expressions if he wanted to spend more time with the genius.
He wondered a little about the new car in front of it, which didn’t match one of Tony’s or his friends, but he wasn’t suspicious either. He had seen the security for this thing. He not only needed a personal code to enter, but it also had a biometrical eye scanner. Steve was nearly ashamed for still using that old Samsung smartphone which he had had for four years now.
“Tony!” Steve exclaimed, when he arrived back at the penthouse. His boyfriend was wide awake now, typical soldier, he really seemed ready to fight. No more sleepy head. “Where have you been? You’re good?” He asked now with his calm and carrying voice.
“Yeah?” He asked with a sore voice and wiped away the tears running over his face.
Tony turned to face Steve in his seat. “I am worth more than that, they all realized that pretty fast.”
“It’s dangerous.” Tony answered. “Not for me, god… My reputation is done, but for you. Being gay in the army really is a handful, and you’re not dating the sweet guy from next door.”
Right after he started blaming Steve, and that’s when Steve decided to go back to Afghanistan. He knew then that he couldn’t help. He left Bucky with Sam being there to rescue him if it was really needed. They even lived together for a while and Steve felt relieved.
“It was your best buddy, then.” He said coldly.
“Midgardians, he never calls us humans or people.”
Steve smiled for half a moment, before his face showed honest concern. “That’s a good plan, but…” He took a deep breath. “Just don’t get yourself killed, alright? I’m not sure I could take it.”
Tony grinned but before he could answer, the door was torn open and no other but Obadiah Stane stormed in. “What the hell do you think, you’re doing?” He demanded to know.
He hacked himself into the coms of the team and listened from a little distance. He still had no suit. Not in Washington or one that wouldn’t take to long to come to him. He destroyed all of them, the new ones where not really operable right now.
“He can go himself, Jarvis. I’m pretty sure he’s offended that you even asked.” Tony laughed.
Steve made enough food for the whole team, including Thor and Hawkeye, although he knew Tony would probably not be able to eat as much. “I’m still waiting for your monologue.” Tony said while forcing himself to eat Steve’s rice pan with vegetables. It was absolutely delicious but he was still a little to nausea to really enjoy it.
Rhodey’s friendly face changed in a matter of seconds. “I swear Pep, when that man walks out of the room, I’ll crush his skull.” He walked up and down between Pepper and Steve. “I can’t…” He started again but didn’t finish his sentence.
“You said ‘I love you’.”
“Because he loves Steve, and deep inside he knows that Barnes himself is a good guy, and we may be able to get the shit that HYDRA left inside of him, out of his mind.” Bruce explained and Steve only got happier. Bruce put his doubts aside then.
“It is.” Tony admitted within a second. “And don’t ask me why I didn’t tell you. I hardly know you and you had just saved my life. I didn’t want you to think it was a waste for trying.”
“I’m better when I’m with you, Steve.” Tony whispered. Instead of answering, Steve decided it was time for their first kiss. He had absolutely no idea why they hadn’t done that yet, but he was happy to make up for lost time. He leaned down and secured his intention with a last look into Tony’s eyes.
“He’s great, well…  I just arrived yesterday, so you probably know more than me.”
Ever since he became Captain America the persona Steve Rogers had faded away until there was no more of that little boy, only Captain America, every time but with Tony… If they flighted or talked, if they were joking or being serious, he always was just himself. He didn’t need to spend a second thinking about saying or doing what Captain America would do.
“Man, this is impossible. He died seventy years ago.” Sam tried convincing Steve.

“And your man needs you now. At the latest I will be back for the wedding, if I’m allowed?” He asked again into Tony’s direction. The billionaire only nodded once, he probably didn’t even hear the question and just reacted. Bucky turned around to face everybody at some moment. “Thank you all. I hope I can show my gratitude for what you did, one day. I don’t take it for granted.”
A big smile appeared on Tony’s face, while there still dropped a tear out of his eye. “When I believed it was over, when I was at my lowest and my heart was giving up… Military was there to save me, or rather Rhodey. He organized the search for me, and he got promoted right after. I would be dead without him. I cried nasty tears in his arms and another round when I embraced my father.”
Tony cuddled closer with his back to Steve’s chest. “Don’t take all the Cap away. He’s kinda hot.”
Instead of giving a summary to every chapter, I decided to put parts of song lyrics in it that came into my mind while writing those chapters. Those titles are also the inspiration for the chapter names. The songs don't necessarily have anything to do with the chapter, it's only my brain playing songs in my head.
“He said one sentence to me before passing out.”
“Some?” Sam asked confused.
“You should have seen her face. She lost it completely. First, she dead-paned, and then she was lying on the floor dying of laughter, she actually couldn’t breath anymore. Useless to say, I had been shitting my pants before but I wanted to die right then and there. I actually wished for a bomb to drop right on my head.”
On Saturday, Tony and Steve were hanging around on the couch watching TV. While Tony seemed to keep up with the context of the show, Steve was drawing on a sketch block that he had stolen from Tony yesterday.
“Why can I see your ribs?” Steve asked calmly. The man shrugged and pulled, without further whining, his hoodie over his head. “Tony, I’m so not letting you out of here without any explanation.”
“Damn it!” Bucky murmured to himself when Steve had left his apartment.
It probably wasn’t worst case but not the ideal scenario either.
Steve smiled and decided they would find out soon enough or not at all, no need to think further about it. Instead, he leaned closer to kiss Tony’s cheek. The billionaire turned around and the kiss landed on his lips. “No need to be so innocent.” He whispered against Steve’s lips. The soldier smiled.
“You are too nosey to not want to know.”
“Well, it’s an Audi Spyder… I was actually afraid to drive it.”
“Well, Dr. Yinsen told me before that it would probably take a little longer than usually. He just wants to really look at his heart, so that maybe he can see what’s wrong and find a way to heal it.”
“Yeah, yes, I do, Rogers. And it pains me, but I need people I can trust for this. And I don’t know who else I can trust with this.”
“He was first front in the war. You don’t do that if you have any doubt about you being on the wrong side.”
“Yeah, then make me!”
It’ll be over
“Right now, Tony. I want to spank you, so get up.” Tony’s eyes, that just had to hurt like hell, grow wide.
“See you soon, Tony. And don’t forget the Jericho.” The first man called into the room while walking out. The Jericho? That’s what Tony fought about on the phone, wasn’t it? God damn it, what the hell was that?
“You know me well for only a week.” Steve smiled. “How are you feeling? Any pain?”
Tony laughed. Loudly and without holding back in the slightest. Bruce would probably be the one that wouldn’t say anything to his relationship with Cap, but in that moment, he realized they would have to tell Clint, because Natasha wouldn’t dare to do so. God, he needed to put all the cameras on Clint’s face.
“Who are they?” The man next to him suddenly asked. He hadn’t kept up with the show then.
With all the wars
“You were right.” He frowned. What was Tony talking about.
Steve leaned back in his seat and let go of Tony’s hand. “I’m going to tell you, if you go on a date with me, a real date. Give me a least a chance.”
“Yeah, course… I was full of drugs and the hottest guy I ever met was sitting next to me and comforting me… I’m not doing that only for me, okay? I’m not that egoistic.”
Enjoy reading!
“You’re my boyfriend and, I want and need to support you, he is your best friend, that makes him part of your family, so also a part of mine. I don’t like him, not yet. But you never like all of your family.” He took a deep breath.
Steve hadn’t understood the reasoning for that, mostly because he was to distracted by just looking at Tony. Him talking with closed eyes, under that blanket Pepper had put over him hours ago, was oddly feeling like home. He was so calm and cute, just utterly beautiful. The other reason was that Steve had no knowledge of technical information about cars.
“No. I remember him. It’s Bucky. He’s not dead.”
“The whole world knows that he’s in the hospital, that his life is in danger. Tony will definitely go hide in his Batcave, lick his wounds and wait for it to wear off.”
The past days neither of them could stop talking. They laughed a lot together but he also had held Tony’s hand when he had cried during one night when a panic attack had taken over his mind. The Stark son had shown his most genuine and sympathize smile when he talked more about his parents and the day he nearly lost Bucky.
Tony rested his head on the pillow. “It happened about two years ago. I was in Afghanistan with my Dad, presenting a new bomb… It was the first time he brought me along, also the last one. On our way back to the airport, they raided our convoy. Five soldiers died, three lost a limb and I was missing. I prayed my Dad made it out, but I thought they killed him.”
'Who cares if one more light goes out?
The smile disappeared from Steve’s face. And in the very same moment, Tony wanted to slap himself across the face. The war wasn’t even over for a year in Steve’s brain. “There were a lot.” Steve whispered.
Tony had thought it was a good deal, if Bucky would start being an honest and lawful American citizen, they would reconsider if the ankle tag was still needed. And Tony had proposed him a place in the Avengers, well Sam had given the information to Bucky but it had been Tony’s idea. But Steve hadn’t liked anything of the deal with the FBI.
Tony clung to him like he would die if he wouldn’t, and he cried. He didn’t know where all those emotions suddenly came from. But he cried, loudly and there were sobs and back in his mind he knew just how awful he must look like and that he was wrecking Steve’s shirt with those ugly tears.
His eyes grew bigger. “No. That’s… wow.” He murmured.
“I have to do it, my doctors said the next time it would kill me, so it’s either dying by trying to live, or dying by doing nothing. I’m not that kind of guy to give up.”
But Tony. He looked down at the small man in his arms, finally relaxed in his sleep. Steve hadn’t spent that much time with him. During the Chitauri Invasion, and a little after, some phone calls… So, he wouldn’t say he was an expert when it came to the man, but he was sure he had never seen Tony as relaxed as right now, when he was with him, Steve Rogers, whose best friend killed his parents.
“I thought you stopped sleeping around with people, especially guys…”
“I fucking have no time, Obie! Get your shit done yourself!” Brown hair screamed into the phone. “I’m not building that thing. It’s dangerous in the wrong hands.” The man bent forward, he seemed to be in pain. “Yeah! I know that, and later I found out what a stupid idea that was. The military shouldn’t have it either. So, fuck you.” He jerked the phone into his pants pocket and clenched his shoulder with the other and.
Natasha just smirked, and it took Tony a moment to realize he was being subtly addressed before he shrugged. “All reporters are assholes, it's a defense mechanism for the conditions of their job.”
Sam scoffed. “If he sees us coming, that won't be a problem. He kind of hates us.”
“So now it’s Sam’s turn, right?” Scott turned to where the afore-mentioned hero stood, and was vaguely unnerved by his smirk. He and Natasha were surely bad influences on each other. “Wait, what’s your task?”
Vision was still staring at him with those piercing eyes. “You did that for your daughter.”
Sam recoiled in shock, and Wanda rolled her eyes next to him. “Don’t ask her what you said, I can tell you. You called Friday the ‘new and hopefully improved digital butler.’”
Scott made some noise resembling assent, but was still regaining his breath.
"I will be there in 20 minutes, do not leave,” Tony bit out, before he ended the call. Sam would protest at being ordered around, but he guessed the scientist in Tony was a little excited. He had figured the man had already looked into the incident, because during his own research into the event he had come across the ties between the Pyms and the Starks. Sam settled into an armchair and cheerfully waited for the billionaire.
“And then some people will interrogate your schooling, some will get paranoid about powers, some will harass Hank, some will suspect Tony, and no one will know for sure,” Natasha summarized.
“What is it now?’
“Once. Now Anthony Stark is the heir to the estate and I his Godfather, Lord..?”
“12 am, Eastern Time Zone.”
“Yeah, the red one? It's cute,” Wanda commented drolly.
It was nearing the end of the summer harvest, and the farm hands were sorting through the crops plucked from the field by Tony’s new prototype harvester. (It was still quite the work in progress and Tony was in a mood over the fact it’d take until the fall harvest or the next year to really make it a viable installation.) It was Bucky who noticed the procession first, and he sharply kicked at Steve’s shin, jostling the man as he sorted through one of the massive barrels. “Ow- what the fuck, Bucky?”
“I’ll do my best, Jarvis, but we both know what he’s like.” Bucky laughed, despite himself, at the exhaustion in the man’s voice. He accepted the horse with gratitude and set off to comfort one of his favorite people in the world.
Scott winced. He had expected he’d have to show off and impress them for his place on the team, but even with the battles under his belt, he was nervous.
“It’s short for captain, like a ship’s captain. You like it?”
So we’ve entered the Civil War section of the fic… How exciting! I told you guys I’d update sooner this time! I hope the action was clear enough for you. I rewatched the scene on Netflix several times to try to weave Scott in without having to change every line of dialogue that happens between the other members. Thank God for online movie script archives.
“Have you ever been close to death?”
He’ll deflect, dissemble, baffle, or amuse with ease. He’s charismatic and witty and is sometimes the only person on the team who can deal with the press, even on his worst days and despite his obvious distaste for the media. (Sam doesn’t really think him being able to see that aspect to the guy proves he can read him, everyone knows Tony and the media have a rocky relationship, and Tony’s announced it to the group at large in many colorful and admittedly hilarious ways.) And just when Sam has resigned himself to only seeing the mask Tony uses as skillfully as his suit of armor, Tony will slip and show the Avengers some bit of vulnerability. He’ll stumble into the communal kitchen in the morning, despite the fact he has a private one, after a three day long session in his workshop, and clutch the coffee mug someone hands him like it’s the only thing that can keep him going. He’ll absently rub at the spot his reactor used to be in the dark during movie night. He’ll look at Pepper like she’s his lodestar, the only thing that he knows will lead him home. He’ll go to talk to Jarvis then falter when he remembers the A.I. is gone. Moments like those are when Sam will find himself lost again on what to think of Tony Stark.
Scott couldn’t help the smile bubbling up and laughed. “C’mon Hope, no small talk? You look refreshed, and I believe I need to congratulate you on the new role, madame CEO of Pym Technologies.”
In it, Steve detailed all of things he’d seen and all he had done. Bucky and he had taken a ship to the new land, and he had seen approximately 30 things he would have like to have shown Tony to get a smile out of him. Oh, and he loved Tony. The ship had a cat that reminded him of Dummy, please give Dummy a carrot for him, oh, and he loved Tony. Bucky said this funny thing, and he loved Tony.
“Unless it’s really serious or he’s mad, then it’s ‘Rogers’,” Rhodey joined in, apparently resigned now to his loss. “Why?”
Cassie nodded. “This way Ms. Black Widow and Mr. Captain America and Mr. Falcon and Ms. Scarlet Witch and all of them can help you save people. Then you can save even more people.”
“I make five,” Sam said seriously, after a brief bout of gunfire.
“That’s disappointing, but we can discuss that later. Your first test today will help you warm up. Natasha?”
Bucky gaped. “Are you for real? She hates nobles and their bullshit. Haven’t you complained about Tiberius being a piece of shit?”
Steve chuckled. “I do. There’s so much I haven’t seen.”
“Course not, Brain.”
“MIT presentation.”
The realization that this had been a long con designed to alter the team’s expectations sunk in, and Scott felt his stomach sink. “Then where is he aiming?” Scott asked cautiously, even as he held tight to Sam’s suit as the man flew.
“Obstacle course?”
Sam whistled. “It took me a week to offend her.”
“Heard what- oh shoot, I accidentally made a joke about his name, didn't I.” It wasn't a question.
people,” Sam said incredulously.
"College?" Sam said.
Before Scott could even formulate an apology, Natasha interjected, “As if Vision ever uses his own day. Wanda basically has two days of the week to decide what we eat.” The last part was directed at Scott, amusement clear in her voice.
“He and FRIDAY are basically Skynet,” Sam faux-whispered.
“What’ll change for us with you working for them?” She asked interestedly.
"I'll also be far away..." Scott said.
“C’mon man, I’m meeting the Avengers.”
“Scott?” Now Sam was checking in, concerned by the silence.
After the brief rundown of what the press had already discussed, (apparently the Avengers released a formal press brief yesterday that glossed over much of the exact battle in favor of explaining their reasons for being there. Apparently, Rumlow attacked the institute while the Avengers were there on a tip for a potential Hydra robbery. The matter of Rumlow’s custody was still being discussed, with the UN and NATO the two most likely ones to take him, though Hope informed him Stark was making some serious waves pushing for sole Avengers extradition) Hope demanded Scott give her a play by play of what he remembered. The two spent a good hour on the exploits, with Hope interjecting questions throughout.
“I can alert you whichever way you prefer, but many members prefer to use their phone,” FRIDAY added.
“Your first official group training as an Avenger is tomorrow morning,” Sam said, gleeful delight coloring his words.
This is a whole ass fix-it fic now. Quick notes: Hope/Scott isn’t endgame, Luis, Dave and Kurt are important parts of Scott’s lives and I will take all the liberties I want with them, Cassie is precious beyond belief and I would die for her, Hope and Hank will plot to find Janet, though probably without the running from the police bit, Scott is much beloved by his team and just wants everyone to get along.
“I appreciate you, Tony.”
“I wouldn’t expect anything different.”
Rhodey cracked a grin reminiscent of the smile Tony had during their first encounter, reminding Scott that the man in front of him was the billionaire’s closest and oldest friend, if newspapers and the Avengers were to be trusted. He briefly wondered who had the expression first, but refocused on the veteran to listen to his instructions.
And always, always at the end he said:
The gym was almost underwhelming the first time Scott explored it, but honestly, with the extent it had been hyped up in his head, anything would have been a disappointment. It was a lot like a traditional gym, with weights, punching bags, and what looked like a boxing ring, with a few more unique additions such as a climbing course of ledges, handholds, and ropes that snaked up from the floor and across the ceiling. Of course the gym, even traditionally styled, was a lot more incredible than Scott had ever gone to. But yeah, he expected holograms and robots.
