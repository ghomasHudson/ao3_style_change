“Sorry,” Steve replied, winding his way through the hallway and dodging a bellboy who stepped out with a cart of luggage.
“Only you,” Barnes said between chortles.  “Only you, Steve, I swear to God. You crazy sonofabitch. What the hell have you gotten yourself into now?”
“Yeah, I know, pronouns are tough these days,” Kirk said with faux commiseration that did little to hide how much fun he was having at Steve’s reaction.
“Sure.  Wedding gift is for both of you, right?” Stane said.  He slid the stack of chips over to Steve. “New player,” he announced to the boxman.
The man was beautiful, even more so out here in the light, without the pall of sickness and pain.  He had broad shoulders and a flat stomach that rippled with muscles as he moved. The amulet Anto had noticed before swung from his neck, and he had shaved his beard off, leaving his face smooth.  He looked younger like that, Anto thought. He was long-limbed and lithe, where Clan were short and stocky, his legs and arms thick with well-defined muscles that Anto could almost feel under his hands as he watched the man move.  Clan were far more burly. Not fat, but thick, like the branches on a tree, but this man was lean, more like Anto, but far more heavily muscled, like one of the big cave lions who sometimes prowled the hunting grounds at night and stole Tyber’s kill.  The Stranger was beautiful, Anto was far past trying to deny that now, and he was leaving, and everything would go back to how it was before.
“I—yeah.  Yeah, she’s sure. She wouldn’t have called if she wasn’t.  So…so, I guess you should probably—shit, Stevie, I’m—this is my fault,” Bucky muttered, flopping down in the overstuffed chair next to the sofa.  “I’m sorry, man, but you know it’s gonna get out there.”
“Do you want him to apologize?” Steve asked in an oddly distant tone.  “Stone. Do you need to hear it from him, that it wasn’t your fault?  I can do that.  If you want.”  There was a hard edge to Steve’s voice, something dark and twisted moving underneath the words that sent heat flaring at the base of Tony’s neck.
“Okay, so, I guess I’ll see you later, then,” Steve replied, stepping back from the doorway with a nod.  “Maybe six or so?”
“On a scale of one to Louboutin, how screwed am I?” Tony huffed out, slinging his jacket over his shoulder.
“Completely serious,” Tony assured him.  “Here,” Tony said, digging into the inner pocket of his coat and pulling out a business card.  “This is my assistant’s information.  Go see her tomorrow morning first thing. Stark Tower.  Big building with my name on it.  Can’t miss it.  There’s a car downstairs that’s going to take you to the Ritz while I get to inhabit your charming abode, capiche?”
“Never say I don’t keep my word,” Tony replied, clapping his hands together.  “Okay, so, about the safe—”
“If only there were, I don’t know, some kind of vocalizations we could use that are associated meanings and somehow communicate this kind of thing,” Tony said with a flat grimace.
Steve breathed out, watching the shadows play over the tent while he decided what he wanted to say. Bucky knew him far too well to simply let this lie. “I don’t want to fail at this,” Steve finally settled on.
“I don’t even know what I was thinking.  I never should have involved you in any of this.  Pepper will get you a check and—“ Tony started.
Tony crawled out of bed and wrapped his robe around himself, then looked back at Steve.  He reached out a hand and stroked the backs of his fingers over Steve’s cheek, shook his head a little, eyes going soft and folding at the corners, then dropped his hand, turned and left.
“It was the undercarriage of an armored vehicle that tried to get up close and personal with my spine, not how I was sleeping, Tony,” Steve rasped out, taking his hand off the wall long enough to rub it over his forehead, squinching his eyes shut for a moment.  He closed the medicine cabinet door and, suddenly, Tony could see both of their reflections in the glass. Steve’s drawn, tight look and flat stare, and Tony’s own pinched, nervous gaze staring back at him.
Obie was extolling Tony’s virtues.  Tony was surprised none of Obie’s men laughed, but to their credit, they kept their expressions carefully schooled, even when Obie got to “obedient” and “dutiful.”  Out of the corner of his eye, he almost thought he saw something pass over the warlord’s face, but it was gone when he dared to look.  He looked over at Obie.  Obie smiled, almost proudly, and took a drink from a proffered cup of wine he plucked from a servant’s tray.  Tony silently hoped he choked on it, but things were never that easy, and it was Tony who found himself clearing his throat as he tried to swallow past the lump that had formed there.  He coughed a bit, earning a glare from Obie, and raised his eyes to the man sitting on the dais.
“Um, yeah…yeah, thanks,” Steve responded, hanging up.  He hadn’t really let himself thing much about the idea of Tony finding someone else, but at Ms. Romanov’s words felt a weight he didn’t know he’d been carrying lift from his chest and something warm seep down and fill in the empty places to  replace it.  It was so close, so very, very close to what he wanted.  He sighed.  Close was better than what most people get in their whole lifetime.  It would be enough.  It would have to be.
“I want…I want to see you.  Please,” Steve rushed out, hands reaching for the edges of Tony’s clothes.
“Draw me like one of your French girls?  I tried the but-it’s-art excuse with Pepper once for this thing some Pap got on a long-lens when I was on a yacht with—you know, forget it, why am I still speaking?” Tony sort of stumbled to a pause.  “You really want to paint me?”
“Which means someone who had access and who knew it was something you wouldn’t catch if these things got funneled off to the side.  This project has been on SI’s books for at least two years in the development stage, and yet working prototypes are already in the hands of terrorists who just happen to know your schedule? This was a set-up from the beginning.  Which means someone sold you out,” Steve countered, voice tight with barely-restrained fury.  “What is does not mean is that you are responsible for any of that.  I’ll say it however many ways you need to hear it, until you believe it.”
“Goddamn, this is awesome!” Brock exclaimed, clapping his hands together.  “Tony fucking Stark. Huge fan.
“Quera,” Steve laughed, rolling up the papers and handing them back to the Omega, who just stared at him for a moment, then slowly reached out to take the bundle, stammering out something Steve thought might be thanks, then mumbling something at him that Steve did not think was at all thanks. He grinned wider. “This is not a bowl, Quera,” he tutted, clucking his tongue, still smiling.
“Thank you,” Steve whispered, pulling back and reaching his hands up to cup Tony’s cheeks, holding his gaze.  The words came out broken-sounding, thick and rent with emotion, but he needed to say it, and willed Tony to understand.  Tony’s throat bobbed and worked, mouth parting, then closing on whatever he might have said.  Finally, he sighed and his eyes went soft and dark, gleaming with a brittle brightness as he blinked up Steve.
“Great.  So, mini-Cap here thinks it’s best to stick with the guy who stocks the ‘fridge?  This is what generosity gets you, folks.  Let that be a lesson,” Tony said with a long sigh.  “Alright.  Let’s go see if Bruce has any ideas that aren’t trying to avoid to the problem.”
He carefully rolled the parchment back up, tracing a finger over the broken red wax of Tony’s seal as he did, and bent over to place it with the stack of neatly rolled reams of paper stuffed into the large saddlebag that sat under the low, bowed seat of the stool. The tent, though spacious, was hot, almost stiflingly so in the heat that became trapped between the peaks of the desert mountains that surrounded their encampment, but Tony had insisted on seeing the mission well provisioned, and the tent was the least of what that turned out to mean.
“Tony!” Steve said quickly, grabbing him by the shoulders and moving back far enough to put some space between them.  “I’m not—I’m not kissing you. It’s…it’s wrong. It’s…you’re,” Steve waved his hand up and down in the air between them.  “You’re a kid, Tony!”
The file opened, and the movie leapt to life with a sudden burst of staticky sound, it made him startle, though the image was still black.
“I like you just fine,” Steve admitted carefully.  Tony was suspiciously quiet at that, though it was probably the narcotic finally kicking in.  “Now get some sleep.”
“That's a low bar for gratitude you got there, Tony,” Steve observed mildly, but the tension had leaked out of his shoulders a bit. “But, of course, I'm not gonna be...” he cleared his throat and looked down at his heavy, black workboots. “Just figured we'd make this as easy as possible. On both of us. No reason for hard feelings.”
“Even if you’re right,” Tony began haltingly.  “It doesn’t change anything.  So, Obie’s been a bastard for longer than I thought.  Big deal. He still has the Order, and, yeah, maybe he wouldn’t use it.  Maybe.  He’s still dead set against the reactor project.  It’s too big a risk to call his bluff, Steve.  It—no. We can’t.
“This is great. Thanks, Tony.  Really.  This is…all of this.  Tonight, and the lunch---I know I seemed---I should have just--I don’t know. It was nice.  It was,” Steve insisted when Tony pulled a face.
“You know how I feel about siege weapons on the battlefield. Give me artillery and good soldiers and keep your cannons for the walls,” Rhodes said.
“Ah. Good, good!” the man repeated, then nodded enthusiastically.  He made other sounds. Anto didn’t know what those meant, but he caught a few familiar ones.
.  More of everything than anybody I’ve ever met.  You’re so smart, and funny and…kind.  The damned bravest person I’ve ever met, and that’s…well. That’s saying something. And good.  You’re so good, Tony.”
“Wait, wait.  ‘That R&D chick’?” Pepper stopped him, holding a hand up in the air when he took a breath. Damn the need for oxygen, it just gave her opportunity.  “You mean Anne Rollins, our new Head-of-the Shanghai-Division-Anne-Rollins?  Tony, please tell me that you did not give a promotion to someone because they agreed to go out with your not-boyfriend?”
“I missed you,” Steve breathed out, looking down at him.  Tony felt Steve’s fingers curl into his hair where he still cradled Tony’s head with his hand, nails scraping over the nape of his neck.
Steve tugged his phone out again and scrolled through his calls until he came to the number he wanted.  He punched the call button and waited until the receptionist answered.
“No kidding?  Aw, hey, Stark, come on.  We kid, right?  We’re kidders.  Go way back.  Tony loves me,” Hammer prattled on.
Howard grunted and shook his head, a frown marring his features, though he turned around to face the camera and spread his arms wide.
**************************************************************************************************************************************************
“What are you even doing here, Tony?” Steve asked, too tired to muster much in the way of surprise.  He turned in his chair just enough to see Tony leaning against the doorway, wearing one of those strange t-shirts that always left Steve at a loss as to whether they were meant to be ironic or just some other kind of armor he didn’t understand.
“How about a story?” Tony asked quietly, looking down at the large, wide-awake eyes.  “Once upon a time, two fabulous looking men met at a terrible party.  One was very rich, but very unhappy.  The other was…let’s go with having a down year…”  Tony said, hearing Steve’s snort of muffled laughter, “but he had so much to give.  The rich man just couldn’t believe someone like that would love him, so he was very mean to the nice man.”
Sometimes, Steve thought Cam saw things perfectly clearly when he wanted to, but what child could stand to truly look at all of this for any length of time?
For a moment, Tony’s mind blanked into a white noise of anxiety and need, but he managed to nod, throat bobbing as he tried to swallow around the yes that was stuck somewhere in his windpipe, cutting off his air.
There was no going back. He knew that much. There might be a very small path forward, though, and he was clinging to that more than he wanted to admit.
everything, huh?” Steve teased, moving his hands down to Tony’s neck and digging his fingers in until the other man groaned in pleasure.
“The Hellfire Club used to be a front for the mob, back in your father’s day,” Fury said, pulling a dining chair out and taking a seat.  “Then, the Russians, keeping tabs on all the CIA agents who used to frequent it, trying to make sure the Russians weren’t infiltrating the Atomic Energy program.   Guess that makes it something of a tradition for you, huh?” he asked Natasha over his shoulder, who just shrugged. “Anyway, now, it mostly serves up high dollar exotic dancers run through a shell company called AIM--"
…a pledge of faith, true, but what was that if not hope, a dream of the future? He had already given those words to Tony, but had held himself back, or parts of himself, and, Tony was right. It was pulling them apart, the thread going thin, fraying with a tension Steve had put there himself and still struggled against, but Tony would not allow it to snap. He would take something that would destroy a lesser man and make it something more, something strong. If Steve would let him.
“You’re sorry? That’s all you’ve got?”  the first voice demanded.  “You’re sorry. Great. Just great. You’re the one who let him get the jump on you, and now, we’re going to end up on some Upper West Side pâté plate, but, hey, no worries, because Dominic is very, very sorry, Cap, can you pretty please just maybe break our knee-caps or something?”
Steve wondered if Tony would have him suck his cock.  His eyes dipped to the bulge in Tony’s breeches, and his mouth watered at the sight.  He liked doing that for Tony almost more than he liked it when Tony did it to him.  He liked the feeling of Tony’s hand wound in his hair, the weight of Tony’s cock on his tongue, the musky, sweaty scent, the feel of the velvety skin over the hardness of his shaft, the rough scrape of it on his throat when he took Tony all the way down, the soft noises Tony would make, the taste of his seed spilling into Steve’s mouth, he liked it all, but if he didn’t get relief soon, he wasn’t sure he could manage to do much of anything other than just let Tony take his mouth.  His cock twitched again at the thought, small beads of fluid appearing at the head.  When he finally dragged his gaze up, Tony had a small smirk playing on his lips. He knew. Of course, he did. He always seemed to know what Steve was thinking when they were like this. The thought was soft, suffusing his mind with a sort of lightness that seeped into his limbs and muscles, like he was slowly going weightless.
“I like them,” Steve announced, plucking it out of Tony’s hand and biting into it. He didn’t, not really, but wasn’t about to concede the point to Tony.
Tony looked down at his t-shirt with its pink triangle and stained sweats and felt a wave of remembered shame sweep over him.  He liked to tell himself that he didn’t care how he looked, but he knew the way he dressed was as much an act of defiance as anything else, if for no other reason than Howard hated it and his mom despaired of it, and he liked to call it self-expression when it was really a small battle he could fight that didn’t matter to anyone but him, but it did.  It mattered.  When it was one of the few things he had, it mattered, and he hated that he could still feel like he looked like an idiot even when he chose it.  It felt like losing, and he wasn’t sure if he hated himself or Steve more in that moment.
“True,” Tony acknowledged, huffing out a laugh.  “But, you’d come.  I know you would.  You’d be there.  Can you…can you let me be there for you?”
Tony’s cock was hard and heavy against the top of his thigh, dripping trails of pre-come as he shifted and rolled into Steve’s embrace.  Steve got one arm under Tony’s head and the other wrapped around his back, reveling in he feel of their bodies pressed together, sweat-slicked and musky with heat and sex.  Tony’s hands were everywhere, roaming Steve’s body with newfound abandon.
“On the house, let’s say,” Kirk offered.  Steve opened his mouth, closed it, fishmouthed again and then found himself looking at the futon for a split second before he looked back up at Kirk.  He couldn’t.  Obviously.   That had never been the plan.  He had to resist the urge to cross his legs or put his hands in his lap to hide the growing erection tenting his pants and pulsing a pounding staccato of pressure through his body that seemed to echo with something along the lines of ‘plan-schmlan.’
Steve was blushing furiously, shoulders hunched and elbows on the table holding his cards up in his hand like a fan, as if he could fold himself in behind them if he just scrunched up enough.  “I know things have changed, Sam.  A lot for the better, which is great.  But, I don’t know…I don’t see myself really changing all that much on something like that,” Steve asserted evenly, clearly forcing himself to look around the table, though there wasn’t any real embarrassment exactly, just a tinge of discomfort, as if he was unsure if this was a topic he would normally discuss with them, despite Wilson and Natasha’s casualness.  “I’ve waited this long.  I don’t mind waiting for someone special.  It’ll be worth it, when is with the right person.”
“Slowly,” Steve said, stroking a and over Tony’s hair.  Tony drank half of it down, then fell back into the cloud of down and burrowed in, hearing a soft chuckle from Steve at his efforts.
“I know I don’t have to, Tony,” Steve laughed.  He rather enjoyed seeing Tony so flustered and knowing he was the cause of it.  Tony’s face was flushed, his eyes dark and wide, and his hands kept moving around between their bodies, sometimes patting at Steve or stroking his chest, sometimes tapping out a beat on Tony’s.  “I want to. I’ve thought about it a lot—”
“I wasn't a Boy Scout. Look, I just—I don't know what I was thinking, Rhodey, but I came by earlier this afternoon—just to talk, I swear to God-- and the Big Gulp next door let me in---not my fault--and there's a box full of stuff with me all over it—letters and my thesis and pictures and---”
Tony wondered what was so heavily regulated they had to get it from SHIELD Medical, though he knew better than to ask.  He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.  Maybe it would make it easier.  The calming down.  Maybe he’d be so calm, he wouldn’t care what happened.
“It—marriage—it does…change things, Tony.  It does,” Steve said slowly.  His tongue suddenly felt thick, like it wanted to stick to the roof of his mouth and stay there.  He shifted.  Looked down at his feet, then back to where Tony sat.
“My brother finds his little tricks amusing,” Thor observed from the back of the jet where he twirled Mjolnir like he was trying out for the majorettes.  The movement distracted Steve long enough for Tony to get the improvised diaper fixed around his waist and chest a bit better though, which seemed to surprise Steve.
The rest of the day and the few days after that passed uneventfully enough, though the animals seemed a bit on edge to his way of thinking, and once, in the night, Steve woke up to deep peals of what he told himself was thunder coming down from the mountain, though there were no storm clouds to be seen.  In fact, the star-filled sky was clear, the moon high and full, and for a moment, just before he drifted off, he thought the moon was in his room, and its light was as blue as the daytime sky.
“Hey, it’s okay.  Really. We don’t have to.  Movie night, I mean. Or, we can, whatever,” Tony replied, looking over at Steve’s tightly drawn posture.  “Was it…something I said? The drone thing, or…with the contract?  I—I know I sometimes…my mouth says things before my head gets there, you know.“
“Oh, he was worried, alright. Worried I'd up and decide that I could have some kind of life that wasn't the one he had in mind. The one where I march right along to his drum. Yeah, you bet he was worried,” Tony ground out. He could hear the tinge of bitterness on the edges of his words. Steve could, too, apparently, his face pulling into a scowl.
“Okay,” Steve breathed out, and the moment, whatever it was, passed.  Steve gave him a quick smile, took his hand, and led him done the hallway towards the exit.
“I guess,” Steve mumbled in reply, his stomach tightening for a moment.  He didn’t particularly like Brock’s friends, but they were Brock’s friends, and Rollins had, at least, helped when Steve needed a job.  He should probably be more forgiving, but, well.  Sometimes, they were assholes.  A lot of the time.  That was probably being generous.  Brock liked them though, so, it was what it was.  Lots of couples probably had different friend groups.  Very different friend groups.  Speaking of…
, not really, and Steve would see the color high on his cheeks and the way his mouth flattened and his eyes drew together in a pretense of annoyance, and
“I—I do believe in him.  Who wouldn’t believe in Steve?  Come on, I literally just said that!” Tony shot back, rolling his eyes and crossing his arms across his chest, making the bag of chips crumple again.
“Van. Now,” Steve said. “I’ll be out in a minute, and we’ll have,” he paused and tilted his head to the side.  “Let’s call it a long talk about taking responsibility for our actions,” he finished.
“And making dinner on Thursdays.  Something that isn’t boiled, microwaved, or out of a can.  I got standards, man.  You can bring your friend,” Bucky told him, smiling magnanimously.
. He is a vile, abhorrent man who would have been rotting in a prison cell had he not bribed the magistrate years ago when I first heard reports of his cruelties.  Or had I followed up, as I should have, but I trusted it to be done, and—well.  That is—that is neither here nor there for now,” Tony stopped, rolled his lips together, closed his eyes and let out a puff of air.  “Do you remember that night when I had you touch yourself?  After you’d left me, all alone in my bed with only my impure thoughts of you to sustain me?” Tony asked.
“Not much to say.  She married my Dad young.  Had me.  Hired a series of nannies.  That was pretty much my interaction with her,” Tony replied.  “She was beautiful,” Tony recalled, sparing a glance towards the ceiling.  “She played piano.  I’d sit by her sometimes and listen.  She was good.  Not concert pianist good, but good.  Music was one of the few things I think she truly enjoyed about life.  Parenting, not so much.”
There was no place for these kinds of thoughts between them.  Tony was his King.  Whatever friendship they shared, it could go no further.  Steve knew that.
“Careful, Kadina,” the girl warned.  “Be nice.  I hear the King has called this one to him nearly every night.  That he even came here to visit him.  This is true, yes?  There,” she exclaimed at Steve’s nod.  “You see?  He is special, Kadina.  Best watch your tongue.”
“Room Six is available,” the woman’s voice said, cutting off Steve's thoughts as he processed what she told him.
“Nooooooo,” Tony moaned and made a grab for the phone that ended up with him dropping his head to the table and laying there quietly.  “He’s going to make me miss class.  If I miss class, they’ll say it’s because I couldn’t handle the pressure or something. You wait. It’ll be, ‘First Omega at MIT Requires Sick Leave,’ or ‘Omega Stark Too Weak to Handle Rigors of College?’ or ‘College Omega Can’t Handle the Pressure’.  You wait.  They’re dying for me to screw up, Rhodey.  They’ve already gotten the tweets and headlines written.  ‘You Won’t Believe How Quickly Omega Stark Had to Take a Break from College.’”
“Batroc and his goons are notoriously, ah, trigger happy.  It’s probably all over with by now. All my loose ends, all tied up in a nice, neat bow.  Couldn’t have planned it better myself, truly, Tony. I owe it all to you,” Obie continued. He dipped his head in a small nod of acknowledgment while Tony stared at him in abject misery.  “Don’t get up. I’ll see myself out,” Obie added, half-smiling as he pushed himself up and hefted the case.
“I don’t…what does that even…he’s fine.  He’s—we’re fine,” Tony said, frowning in confusion.  “We—we fish.  Well, not really.  Mostly, we get outwitted by Nemo and friends, but it’s good. Things are good.  We’re fine.”
Steve watched with a strange sort of detachment as Tony dipped his fingers in the oil, then began to stroke himself.  Long, languid strokes down the length of his shaft, setting a leisurely pace.  His eyes were on Steve.  Steve could feel his look, even as he couldn’t tear his own gaze away from the mesmerizing motion of Tony’s hand as he worked his own cock to hardness.  A soft grunt.  A puff of air.  The pace of the strokes increased.  Grew harder.  More insistent.  Tony’s wrist twisted over the head of his cock, and he groaned.  The sound sent a stab of arousal down Steve’s own neglected cock.  To his surprise, he realized he was hard and leaking, and wondered how long he had been in that state.
Steve nodded. Yes.  He wanted that.  Desperately.  No intrigue, no plans, no secrets, no lies, just him and Tony, and for tonight, for all the nights they had, he could give that to Tony.  Maybe that was his own penance, in a way, because he doubted he would ever find anything that approached this again.  He would always be Tony’s, collar or no.  He blinked and glanced away from Tony’s face, up to the canopy with its rich, vibrant colors threaded with gold.  He nodded again, eyes watering at the edges, and looked down at Tony.  One tear slipped out and left a thin line down his cheek.  Tony reached out his hand and cupped the side of Steve’s face as Steve leaned into the warm, familiar solidity of it, closing his eyes.  He felt Tony wipe his thumb down the path of the tear, and when he opened his eyes, Tony’s expression was filled with such yearning, it split open Steve’s heart and burrowed there, warm and bright, lighting up his chest with pinpricks of heat.
“See? And you thought you didn’t plan accordingly,” Steve replied with a soft smile. “Sleep, Tony,” he urged, but Tony’s eyelids were already drooping closed, his breathing starting to even out against Steve’s chest.
A mirrored medicine cabinet hung over the white pedestal sink, and Steve caught his reflection there, then stepped forward and thumbed it open rather than look.  The shelves were empty, of course.  Once, he would have had to fill it with bottles and ointments, but now, he could put his shaving kit there, he supposed.  On the right side.  The right side was for him, the left side for…someone else.  For lotions and lipsticks and pressed powder in gilt compacts or whatever it was that Omegas used today.  He stared at the empty shelves for a moment, then slowly closed the cabinet and pulled the bathroom door closed behind him.
“So, after class, I figure, we can grab a bite to eat.  Want to hit the student union for old time's sake?” Tony prodded.  “Don’t answer now,” Tony amended quickly when Steve remained steadfastly silent.  “Give it some thought. Good idea.  Take your time.”
“Tony,” Steve said again, though his voice sounded different this time.  Thready and thin.  Tony watched as Steve swiped a hand over his forehead and looked out the window, where Happy was nudging at the cobblestones that lined the driveway with the tip of his shoe and entirely too much intensity to be real.  Steve cleared his throat and opened his mouth, then snapped it shut again.
“Are you sure, Tony?  Really, I don’t mind,” Pepper offered.  “I was just frustrated and…I shouldn’t have said anything.  I know you wouldn’t ask me without a good reason.  Okay, that’s not entirely true, but I shouldn’t have assumed.”
“In case I didn’t mention it last night, thank you for, ah, rescuing me and all,” Tony said.   “My hero,” Tony added, smiling shyly up at Steve.
when he wanted to.  All those wonderful muscles bunching into force and momentum, propelling him across the room and in front of Tony so fast, Tony gasped and would have stepped back were he not already sheltered in the doorway.  Instead, his head snapped back in startle, and he probably would have smacked it rather neatly on the doorframe, except Steve’s hand somehow got between his head and the wall, catching the motion.
One of the stars was moving.  A falling star. He should make a wish.  He grinned. “I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight,” he sing-songed from memory and closed his eyes, like he had when he was a boy.  “I wish...I wish...wish I wasn’t alone.”
This was getting long, so while I anticipate just one more part, I'm notoriously terrible at predicting how much I'll end up writing.  At any rate, at 8K, it felt time to post this Part.  Enjoy!
Damn.  Open mouth, insert foot.  He should really have come with some kind of warning label.  Maybe he had, for all he knew.  Caution:  Omega may not behave appropriately.  In case of emergency, break glass, but not the good crystal, Howard, it’s from Prague.
“Sorry,” Steve said automatically when they finally broke apart.  He blinked down at Tony, who sighed and arched his back a bit, stretching underneath Steve.  “Just thinking that I like kissing.  And you’re...good at it. I’m--I, ah. I like it, that’s all.”
“Sir, Captain, Sir,” a uniformed officer coughed from what used to be the doorway. “Ah…we’re so deeply, deeply sorry for the, uh, misunderstanding,” he spluttered while a few other officers shuffled in behind him, looking contrite and vaguely terrified. There was a wet spot on the front of the pants of the tall, thin Paul Blart who had been the one to hold Tony down while he was cuffed, and a high-pitched whine seemed to emanate from his throat until the man in front turned and gave him a withering look.  Good, Tony thought bitterly.  “We had no idea he was yours, I assure you.  Of course, we’d never touch your Omega, had we known, I swear.  If you want to press charges against the arresting officers, I’ll be happy to take the report myself.”
“No you don’t.  And neither do I,” Tony said, his voice soft, but furrows forming on his brow. “A king has many ready to stand for his defense, but as a man…I have precious few who would.  What you did today, it—it meant a great deal to me. And it terrified me,” he said, looking down at his hands for a moment before raising his eyes to Steve. “I don’t want to change who you are, Steve.  Who you are is—you are like no one else I have ever met. You see something that is wrong and you just, you do something about it. You have no idea how unusual that makes you. I just want to protect you.  Some of this—the veil, the guards, all the damn rules—I know it may not seem like it, but it is to keep you safe. If people knew what you meant to me…” he trailed off and looked away again.
When breakfast was done, they packed up the food in containers or baggies and put it in the fridge.  Steve had now become convinced this little ritual was Tony merely humoring him because it wasn’t as if he showed up and they just popped leftovers into the microwave.  Hell, last Wednesday, there had been a chef in the kitchen when Steve arrived, talking animatedly with Tony in Italian.
“Guess you heard.  About Lagos,” Steve said. Tony ran a hand over his mouth, then shoved it in his pocket.
“Uh, you didn’t say, ‘I’ll take Changing the Subject for $200, Alex,’” Tony replied.  “And that was phrased in the form of a complete fabrication instead of a question, so judges say no points for that one.  Care to try another category?  Like, ‘Stuff I Should Probably Tell Tony’?”
“Whatever it is.  It wasn’t me.  I don’t care what the…guy?  Guy, told Romanov,” Clint insisted hurriedly.
A huge thank you to my amazing beta, tastes-like-coconut, who you can find on tumblr.  She's an amazing artist in addition to being an awesome beta, so check out her Stony fanart.
“For an Alpha, you sure have given how Cap fucks a lot of thought,” Rumlow snorted.  “Something you want to tell us?”
Until he let himself think it, he hadn’t realized just how badly he wanted it.  How had he ever thought that something physical with Steve would be enough?  Of course, it wasn’t.  It couldn’t possibly be enough, but it had honestly never occurred to him that Steve might want more, and probably best just not to knock too hard on that particular door, he demurred.
U blinked his pincers in Tony’s direction, spun them around, then rolled over to try to pick up the wrench Tony had thrown.  The bot managed to snag the wrench in his pincer and drop it in the toolbox, raised his arm and whirred happily.
“That’s the price of the Claim, don’t you see?  The payment due for the protection and care I provide,” Tony murmured, his words so close, they seemed to flow into Steve’s skin.  Steve felt like a husked out shell suddenly burning with a cold fire, and deep down, a hunger grew, one like he had never known. Or had he dreamt of it? Was he dreaming now? His head throbbed.  He could feel the blood pulse in his neck, breaking against the thin skin there in waves, clawing at him, scraping at the skin like it was ready to burst.
Thanks to everyone who gave this a shot.  If you are still here, thank you for reading along.  I really do appreciate it, since I know this is a bit different than my usual.  I swear, there will be more Celestial Navigation at some point, don't worry!
Steve’s breath was coming in shallow, uneven pants as he tried to recover.  Tony’s had slowed, though, he noticed. He used a pillow to wipe his face clear of the sweat, then shook his head and looked over at Tony.  Tony reached out and stroked his fingers down Steve’s cheek as Steve bent his head down for another kiss, this one deep and slow, like they had all the time in the world and no need to ever part.  They finally did, though. Tony smiled up at him, soft and satisfied while Steve stroked his hair back from his forehead over and over again.
“M’good, Tony,” Steve replied, voice slurred and heavy sounding.  Tony waited what seemed like a long moment for him to elaborate.
The manicotti was, in fact, amazing, Steve had to agree, and after a few moments of silent chewing, the tension started to ease, mostly from Tony diving into the ins and outs of adventures in corporate lobbying. The easy flow of conversation picked up again, though Steve was keenly aware that they were both tip-toeing around the topics they wanted to avoid.
“Loving you has never been complicated, Tony,” Steve replied.  “That’s the easy part.  I just…don’t want you to get into something and then…then you’d feel obligated or, I don’t know, like you had to stay.  If it’s too much, you gotta promise me, you’ll say something. Walk away. I won’t hold it against you, Tony.  I wouldn’t do that.”
that every time he ends up on the mat, it is only because I am King and not my combat prowess,” Tony said in a tone laced with amusement.  Steve was in the middle of a drink and nearly choked on his wine. He shot Tony a withering look, which Tony returned with a raised eyebrow and a pleased smile. “Some other time, perhaps,” Tony offered, then changed the subject to something to do with the guilds that let Steve’s mind wander back to the various training sessions he and Tony had since the day he fought Rhodes and his men.  It was fair to say that a number of them ended with Steve on the training mat, though not the way Lord Rand was probably imagining, Steve remembered with a flush of heat.
It was crazy. Wasn’t it?  But, what about this wasn’t, when you got down to it.  The creature was silent a long moment, then nodded once and bowed its head.  It jabbed its finger towards the horizon with surprising force, a furious frown marring its features.  Its tentacles swarmed underneath it, and Steve had the sense of anger and bitter, pent-up frustration rolling off of it.
Steve opened it and stared at the ring for a long moment, then looked up at Tony.  “It’s beautiful.  I’ve never seen metal like this.  What is it?”
Steve took in a quick breath when he could and tried to relax his throat even more as he pushed his face flush with Tony’s abdomen as Tony’s cock slid fully into his throat, cutting off his air. He swallowed around it a few times, letting his throat muscles work to massage around Tony’s shaft. Tony’s hand was wrapped in his hair, holding him in place, and suddenly, Steve felt Tony’s whole body stiffen.  He could feel the warm, thick fluid leaking from his hole, running over where his balls hung, heavy and tight, and puddling on the bed beneath him.  His own cock was painfully hard, pushing insistently against his stomach, already leaking a steady stream, but he wouldn't touch himself.  This was about Tony, and he would come from taking care of his Alpha or not at all.
Steve put one foot up on the marble seat that jutted out from the shower wall and worked his finger in and out a few times before adding a second.  It was an odd sensation, he thought.  It felt different than when Tony did it, when he couldn’t keep himself still and kept trying to find more, to feel more, though it was something else, too.  Tactile.  Tony liked to touch him, liked to watch him come apart from it.   He always took his time, almost reverently sometimes, and seemed to enjoy it almost as much as Steve, and maybe that mattered, too.  But, tonight, Steve wanted this to be about Tony, though he wasn’t quite sure why. Gratitude, maybe, though that didn’t quite feel like the right word.  I want him to know how I feel, Steve realized as he pushed a third finger deep inside, then out again, repeating the gesture until he felt his body slacken at the invasion.
He finally settled on soap, laundry detergent and socks, which he figured were all innocuously domestic enough.  Leaving the list sitting on the counter, he tromped outside and across the driveway to the garage.  After he punched his code into the door and went inside, he felt instantly lighter.  The cabin might be a bit on the relic side, but this…
“Well, I’m sure your assurances would quiet the Council,” Tony said with a derisive snort.  “Steve, you’re a man of war, not some crofter who picked up his scythe, trotted off to some skirmish and came home calling himself a soldier.  Tell me, would your precious Free States give up one with such knowledge?” Tony demanded, voice flecked with annoyance.  “I thought not,” he said, catching Steve’s expression. “This is the life we were given, much as I may wish it were different.  It is not. So be it.  You are mine.  Fate has willed it so. That will have to be enough. For the both of us.” A low, bitter huff of a laugh escaped, and he finished tying his robe with a shake of his head.  “Would that you had been a prince from some far-off kingdom.  The youngest son, of course, with nothing but a large dowry and good trade pact—or perhaps a nice army--to your name,” he continued, giving Steve a long, desolate look before turning away.  He stopped, one hand reaching up to grip the edge of the door, though he did not turn back.  “You see?  I can dream, too.”
“And what of your people outside the protections of the walls of a city or castle?” Steve demanded.  “Should their suffering not count towards your assessment of the risk of battle?”
“I sat in a car while he was in surgery.  Just sat there.  They had to keep him immobilized because of the back thing.  Because when the IED hit, the Humvee flipped, and he was pinned, upside down like that, until they could get there and cut him out.  He had to wait there, like that.  Until someone came.  He wouldn’t have known if it was us or them.  He wouldn’t have known about Barnes. He’d just have been stuck there, you know, so.  So, I can do some reading,” Tony said quietly.
Evening well spent then, Tony thought, though Barnes utter contempt seemed a tad out of proportion, all things considered.  Sure, Barnes was always going to be on Steve’s side, but he could’ve at least acted mildly embarrassed over how things ended up, considering Barnes had probably known all along what was going on, which stung, if only because it made it all the more pathetic that Tony hadn’t seen it for what it was.
“You mean, when I was thrilled to be free of my gold-digging ex and reveling in my newfound freedom and maturity?” Tony asked, giving Rhodey a quick, apologetic look.
The fire crackled in the hearth, though it burned low, little more than embers now.  His legs hurt, but he didn’t move again, just concentrated on the feeling until it was all his mind could focus on.  That was strangely better, though he didn’t know why, since all he could think of was the discomfort.  The longer he thought of it and the more he concentrated on it, the less it bothered him, though.  There was just the strain of muscle and the need to move, and the more he thought of it, the less he thought of anything else, until it had banished all other thoughts.
“Fair point. So, uh, that’s settled then. Right? I mean, it’s settled,” Tony repeated. “Of course it is. I love you. You love me, blah, blah, blah. Now, we’ll just grab whatever shrink ray they used, get you—fine, get us—“ Tony correct at Steve’s sharp look. “Out of here and talk to Bruce, then go from there.”
“Idewseedat?” Stern mewled. “Eehitme! Myhrt! Cntbreef! Arrestem!” Stern shouted, pointing in agitation at Tony, who just rolled his eyes and stuffed his hands in his pockets.
Brock turned his head enough to glare up at him, then spat a wad of bloody phlegm on the floor by Steve’s shoe and smiled up at Steve with a red-stained grin where he must have bitten his tongue.  “Fuck you, Rogers,” he ground out.
“He has an amazing collection,” Steve said, dragging his gaze from the arching hall down to where Museum Guy was still pumping Tony’s hand in gratitude.  “Some of the new stuff is a bit over my head though.”
“Never,” Tony assured him, patting his ass instead and grinning wickedly in response to Steve’s glare, which would have probably bothered Tony, but he could see Steve biting his lip to keep from smiling, so it was okay. Okay-okay, even.
He would be crazy to say no, wouldn’t he?  If Stark was even serious.  Maybe he had already forgotten about the offer.  Or regretted it.  If Steve showed up at the concierge desk at The Palms and asked for Tony Stark, they would probably laugh at him. Or call security. Probably.
Today was for celebrating, and he was happy for them, how could he not be? After all, what would it say about him if he weren’t , if a part of him hated them both a little, wanted to go back and change the past and take this away from them? What kind of person would he be if thought about that?
“I would have your name, Sir, if you don’t mind,” Steve requested, his voice stiff as he cleared his throat.
“It’s just…he needs someone to look out for him, you know?” Tony said, throat suddenly thick and closed.  He blinked and glanced over Fury’s shoulder towards the room he was sharing with Steve.  “He’s this big hero and all that, and he
Bruce was bent over a microscope, squinting through wire-rimmed glasses at whatever boring cultures were on the slide. He looked up with surprise when Tony appeared, though he covered it quickly enough with a welcoming smile. “Hey there,” Bruce called out with a small, stilted wave. “No…no, ah, assembling,” Bruce said with a nod to the alarm. “What brings you down here to troll the dregs of actual scientific research?”
, for God’s sake.  For his own sake.  He needed to stop.  Let this go.  Let… Tony go.  The idea of Tony, anyway.  Obviously, Tony himself wasn’t his.  Not that he wanted Tony to be his, Steve rationalized firmly, ignoring the curl of… something… deep inside his chest.  He didn’t want Tony, because he had Brock.  Sure, the sex had been good.  Great.  Whatever.  But, he was--he had Brock.
“Don’t know,” Steve rasped out.  He pressed himself back against the cool tile of the wall and tried to be still, concentrate on something that wasn’t the feel of Tony’s wet skin sliding against him, his warm hand around Steve’s cock, holding him there, holding him.  Pre-cum was leaking out of the end of Steve’s cock, dribbling onto the shower floor by the drain.  Tony was ignoring it, or not ignoring it, but not doing anything about it, and that was doing something, too, pushing away any thought that wasn’t Tony’s hand and Tony’s body, and Tony.  Steve didn’t understand why, but he didn’t question it, just rode the feeling towards what his body was telling him he needed.
“Coming,” Steve replied.  He swiped a hand over his face to flush off the tang of the sea, then started for the shore as the waves pushed at his back, almost as if in encouragement.
He listened to her talk between punching the buttons on the slot machine and reading through the Non-Disclosure Agreement that Stark’s assistant sent over.  He wasn’t a legal expert, but it sounded like if he ever so much as walked past a newspaper stand while holding a Stark phone, he was probably going to owe Stark a kidney.  He e-signed it and watched the document be whisked away, which somehow made this whole thing seem strangely official now. Finally, he emptied his casino card on a three credit pull that got him nothing, bid goodbye to Millie, and went in search of Brock, who was at the bar watching the wall of televisions and finishing up a drink.
“He was not there to serve wine, Tony,” Steve said, letting his eyes shut for a moment before locking his gaze on Tony’s.  “He was there to be Lord Stane’s entertainment for the evening. To serve him as a concubine or whatever one would call it.  That is what Stane prefers, and Zola would gleefully feed such—tastes.”
“Enough that it was a problem for SHIELD.  Security risk. Too easy for someone like that to be compromised.  The services started threatening to pull his contracts because of it.  He was pretty pissed about it.  Probably why he was so interested in finding someone with some pull to Bond with his kid,” she raised her eyebrows, as if just now considering the possibility, though Steve knew that wasn’t likely.
“I don’t like thinking about it,” Steve said.  His voice sounded odd. Slightly garbled, like the consonants were mashed together too hard.  “You.  Going through that. By yourself.”
I live on comments, I really do.  I am, however, currently without the mental energy to respond, which I truly do not mean in any way that I don't value them.  I just don't have the headspace for it at the moment, so please do not feel slighted if I don't respond. Know that I read every single one (often multiple times) and really do appreciate that you took the time to say something.
What. The. Hell. Captain America?  The Captain America?  Tony blinked, mind immediately drawing up images of the red, white and blue suit and shield, punching Hitler, the Howling Commandos, and okay, yeah, more images of the Captain that was probably strictly warranted by the history books, but his Dad had a file.  Sue him for taking a peek or, you know, a few.  Some.  Definitely nothing that could be labeled obsessive, strictly speaking, probably because no one actually knew about it, so there was that.
“Steeeeee—eeee----eeeeeee---eeeeevvvve,” Tony chanted, swallowing air.  His mouth was suddenly full of saliva and he had to wipe it across the back of his hand.  Then, Steve was pushing his lace-covered tongue inside Tony’s hole, inside him--God, shit, fuck,
That could have been the end of it, maybe, he mused, except that Steve had shown up at the Tower a few days later, sheepishly admitting his Shield-provided apartment was rubble and wondering if he could stay for a few nights, which turned into weeks and then months and then turned into something else entirely.
things. Things that stood against time. Like the Gate, for one. Maybe being there, I don’t know, I… Anyway, then we became wealthy and powerful, and perhaps we forgot what it meant to forge something, as our ancestors once did,” he added, shrugging lightly. “I’d like to build something good again. I think we can do that. Together. I believe that, Steve, I really do.”
“You hit him from, like, twenty feet.  Right upside the head. That is…impossible, physically speaking.  Like impossible because of physics, I mean. Also, insanely hot. I don’t know why.
“You should let me look at that,” Tony admonished lightly, nodding at the cut across the top of Steve’s arm, just below his shoulder.  A streak of dark red slashed across the makeshift bandage Steve had tied around it sometime earlier.  Sometime after he had cut his way through most of the garrison and lopped of Obie’s head, seemingly because he got tired of hearing the man speak, even though he didn’t understand a word of what Obie had been saying.  Tony had, though.  Tony had understood every word of it.  Not that he expected anything different from Obie at this point.
“It seems unlikely,” Tony replied.  “But theoretically, anything is possible, I suppose.”  Steve sighed, Tony quite enjoying the rumble that echoed through his chest, and turned and wrapped his arms around Tony, drawing him in close, rubbing a hand up and down Tony’s spine.  Ah. This was nice.
“He bounced!” Tony pointed out reasonably, throwing his hands up in the air.  Really, Steve had totally stuck the landing on mutant-Kermit, and unless you’re a well-dressed pig, that isn’t something you get to say very often.  It had been wildly impressive.
“Filled with bliss is a good look on you,” Tony observed, pulling his head back to take Steve in.  He laughed then, a lilting, musical sound that Steve loved, though Tony didn’t laugh as much as he should.  He told Tony that, which had the effect of making Tony stop, which was not what Steve wanted, but then Tony was kissing him again, slow and deep, driving all other thoughts from Steve’s mind.
“Well,” Steve said, glancing around at the remains of the cellblock.  “I hope it looks like what happens when people touch Tony without his permission.”
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve said.  He ducked his head, then looked up at Tony, feeling a soft smile form.
Tony stared at the darkened button, then sat back and took stock of his situation. He was alone, drifting in space, his power and oxygen situation was critical, and the back-up in his chest was decaying and killing him.
Rebecca and Sugar exchanged a look, faces flat and expressionless. Social tiers colliding, Tony thought, as the dance of politeness continued.  It was strange, Tony thought. Even amongst ourselves, we scrabble for scraps of power.  Maybe that wasn’t so strange, when you thought about it.
Want.  Need.  Desire.  Those were words with meanings and this, this was somewhere beyond that.  He wanted Steve, needed him, desired him, but Steve was his and Tony belonged to him, and this was more than all of those things.  He wanted to be taken, ravished, ravaged, whatever the word was for it, wanted Steve so overcome he couldn’t stop, wanted to be the one who filled Steve’s thoughts, even the dark ones, the ones he wouldn’t talk about, the ones he didn’t want to have. Tony wanted to be all of those things.
He swiped a hand over his face, clearing his expression, then looked back down at Steve. The hand that had been in Steve’s hair dropped down to cup his jaw, and Steve leaned into it, as he always did, seeking Tony’s touch.  Tony’s thumb stroked over Steve’s bottom lip, his eyes following the motion for a moment before he lifted his gaze back to Steve.
“Impressive range,” Rhodey said, whistling his voice low with appreciation as he looked through the binoculars.  “I think I can see all the way to the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge from here. Are you done taking my stuff apart now?” Rhodey asked with a slight huff as he lowered the binoculars and turned to look at Tony, who lounged in one of the chairs on the apartment’s balcony with his feet propped up on the railing.
When he came out, the suite’s lights were turned low, and the T-shaped infinity pool glowed a dazzling blue where it jutted out from the balcony towards the glittering Vegas Strip.  The pool was surrounded by glass walls, occasionally broken up by one of Hirst’s signature pill-shapes, creating a dizzying effect with the lights, almost as if you could simply swim off the edge and out into the sky, though what really captured Steve’s attention was the man currently leaning back in the water wearing nothing more than a red speedo with his elbows braced on the edge and his head tipped back towards the stars.
Might as well just put a tin can to your ear and aim it at the sky, Jesus Christ Almighty, Tony recalled shouting in annoyance, while Steve handed him an icepack, nodded his sympathy and punctuated his concern with tsking sounds that Tony appreciated, even though he suspected Steve was humoring him.  If only because the next day, there was an actual tin can on a fucking string attached to the wall next to his workstation, helpfully labeled as the ‘Someone is Wrong About Science Hotline.’  Tony had stared at it a full five seconds before his brain caught up with what he was seeing, and he’d spent the rest of the afternoon randomly looking over at it with a stupid grin on his face like it was Christmas.
.  That’s what Fury had said all those months ago when they still had to put an IV into his arm every morning because he had trouble actually swallowing liquid.  Steve had heard the lie wrapped up inside those easy-to-believe words, but he’d nodded because they put a shield in his hands, and that was the only thing that had felt right since he opened his eyes.
“Reforms.  Changes.  Improvements.  I don’t know, but just because it is the way my father did it or how it has been done since time immemorial, what does it matter if we can make it better?” Tony asked.  Steve felt his eyes widen in surprise, and opened his mouth to say something, though he wasn’t sure what.  To say that he thought it amazing of Tony to hear him out and seek to make changes?  Or to tell Tony that the system could not stand, no matter what reforms he made?  Could he not at least try to make things better for so long as he was here and had the King’s ear?
“Yes. You are compatible,” Steve replied, his voice oddly tight, though Tony figured that could be whatever discomfort he was in or just because getting Steve to talk about any of this Gift-sharing stuff was like pulling teeth.
“Can I inject drugs into his neck again?” Natasha asked, twirling her pen in her hands and clicking the end of it repeatedly in a vaguely threatening fashion.
“He’s going to be alright, Tony,” Coulson assured him, his voice going gentle, careful, like he had a hand out and was afraid Tony might bolt with any sudden movement.  “Really.”
“Yeah, fine, they’re trying, but I’d have...I mean. We just can’t count on that, and no way I’m going to ditch you, Snow White, so get used to it,” Tony replied. “You’re stuck with me until we find your people or figure something else out. And, look, like I said, excise out the near-death experience and the whole thing was...okay, unique, but not exactly without it’s merits,” Tony shrugged, feeling a warm tinge of embarrassment creep up his neck.
“Happy’s bringing the car around to the front of the hotel, so we can walk the gauntlet of press downstairs. Just smile and ignore them,” Stark continued as he walked into the living room. He was looking down at his wrist, adjusting the clasp on a watch, when he glanced up at Steve, eyes darting around the room before he went back to fiddling with his watch. Stark’s suit certainly wasn’t off the rack, Steve noted, and he wore it well. Steve wasn’t blind, after all. Stark took two more steps as he worked the watch onto his wrist, then looked up again and halted like he’d run into an invisible wall.
.  I’m sorry, Tony, I’m so, so sorry. But, they took you,” Steve rasped out in a broken, thread keen of words.  Tony wasn’t sure if Steve was apologizing for leaving him with Rhodey and going after the Ten Rings, or letting Tony go off to Afghanistan in the first place.  Maybe both.  Maybe Steve wasn’t sure, either.   “You were gone.  From me.
After the check was settled, Tony tore off the top of the rose and tucked it into his lapel, only to find Steve smiling fondly at the gesture, which left Tony both embarrassed and filled with a strange, warm excitement that bordered on giddiness. Enough to make him bump into his chair as he tried to turn, so smooth, fabulous, going so well, he thought with a frustrated grimace. Steve just moved Tony's chair out of the way and handed him his coat. They both shrugged into their coats and headed out into the brisk Brooklyn air.  It was dark, though there was plenty of light from the cars, streetlights and various restaurants and shops still open this time of night.  Swarms of New Yorkers blessedly ignored them, for the most part, as Tony followed Steve to either dessert or Site B.
Of course, it all comes back to Tony.  Who ditched him.  Apparently, something in his penthouse holds more fascination for him than Steve.  Steve sighed and placed the Iron Man poster back on the table.
“Oh!  Sorry!”  Steve said in a startled voice, trying to tuck the drink back towards him so it wouldn’t spill on the stranger.  “I’m…are you…did I?  Sorry.  Did I just cut in front of you?” he stammered, suddenly feeling twelve years old, trying to control a body that no longer fit.
It should have been me.  Steve shoved the thought aside.  It would have been wrong, then, certainly.  Tony had been far too gone with drink to know what he was doing, beyond managing to somehow stumble into Steve’s quarters instead of those of a stranger.
occasion,” Tony agreed, then threw back his head and let out a delighted laugh. “Come here,” he said, reaching for Steve, who was happy to oblige and slid into the circle of Tony’s arms. “I do like it, you know,” he reiterated, quieter now. “You see things differently than I do—you see people, I think, and I see a web of possibilities and outcomes—but together… there’s something more to it, isn’t there? You and I? I won’t always agree, of course—there are sometimes considerations that you cannot know and compromises that must be made that I know you disdain… but, I appreciate your counsel, Steve. Always.”
“Interesting,” Tony mused, drawing out the word speculatively.  “We shall see, my soldier.  We shall see,” he smiled in obvious challenge for a moment before the smile dropped off his face.  “I am not blind to how hard the transition must be for you,” Tony said, schooling his features carefully, though Steve could see the slight crease of his brow where he held the tension at bay.  “Soldier to concubine.  Free man to slave.  An adult captive turned concubine is virtually unheard of, let alone one who ends up in the royal harem, for exactly this reason.  This way of life, for you, I am sure, this must be…difficult to accept.  But it is the way of life for most of the world.  Has been for thousands of years, and is not likely to change, despite your enclave of Free States or whatever you call yourselves, you must realize this.”
“Tony, we have to be realistic here.  Bruce has more knowledge of the serum and its properties than anyone out there.  This—it may not happen,” Steve said, wrapping his arms around Tony, crossing them in the center of Tony’s chest over the reactor.  “If it doesn’t, that’s nothing to do with you, Tony,” Steve said quietly, placing small, light kisses along Tony’s shoulder and the back of his neck.
The path he stood on was narrow, but wide enough for a small cart to pass, Steve supposed, and though it did not appear particularly well-traveled, it was clearly distinguishable as a path. His eye followed it where it clung to the side of the mountain and curved around until it widened, just in front of a crumbling bridge dotted with six pillars that led to the castle.
Okay, so maybe no music, Steve thought a few seconds later as he jerked the earpieces out, staring down at his phone with a wince.  He stared at the screen for a moment, wracking his mind to be sure he had gotten the band’s name correct, then gave up on the idea of music.
“Yeah.  I do,” Steve acknowledged, giving Tony that soft, tender look that crinkled the corners of his eyes and made Tony’s stomach swoop down to somewhere in the Carolinas.  “You never talked much about your mom.”
that.  This was way better.  No frills, no attachments, just a mature relationship between two adults who weren’t looking to be tied down.  Freedom, really, that’s what it was.
“I would take care of you,” Steve said, all breathy and awe-filled, the way he always sounded at the idea of Tony’s Heat.  Steve loved his Heats.  Approached them with the same attention to detail he approached a mission, but with far less throwing people through walls.  But, he always acted like Tony was giving him some kind of amazing gift.  Like it was a combination of Christmas, his birthday and…National Blow Job Day or something.  “You would be so beautiful.  So beautiful, Tony.”
“Probably a better shave,” Steve replied drolly with a slight shake of his head from side to side, only to hear Tony’s burst of laughter before he buried his face into Steve’s stomach, making it shake as he laughed.  It should’ve broken the mood, but instead, seemed to make Steve’s blood run hotter, heating his veins as it coursed a ponderous ache deep inside him.
Tony looked down at him for a long moment, one hand lightly smoothing Steve’s hair down.  His eyes darted away quickly, then back to Steve’s again.  “There is no where else I would want to be.”
Like Steve, he was dressed in a voluminous flowing outer-gown over wide-legged pants and sturdy leather-soled boots. He also wore a headscarf much like Steve’s, and though it could be wrapped around to cover his nose and mouth in case of a dust storm, at the moment the long tail of the scarf hung loosely over Cam’s shoulder while he pointed out the changing terrain or the way the bells woven into the camel’s coat tinkered as it walked.
It wasn’t true, of course.  He knew that. People like Steve were brave, not people like him.  People who did things, helped, made a difference.  People who stood up for themselves, who drew a line in the sand and said, this far and no more.  That wasn’t him.  Not even close.  How many years had he been under Howard’s thumb doing fuck-all about it other than the occasional useless act of defiance that left him with little more than bruises and disappointment to show for his effort.  He was the last person Steve should consider brave.
“You said—“ Tony started, then stopped when he realized his voice was shaking so much the words were coming out slurry. He drew in another shuddering breath, feeling his chest tighten and expand around the air, sending a cold spike of pressure into his throat.
“Don’t be ridiculous.  That would…obviously be a great topic of conversation, but I’d hardly drag you all down here for that.  I called this meeting because I liked kissing my husband,” Tony corrected weakly.  “Help.  Someone?  Anyone? Even you, Matt.”
With an Alpha, you mean, Tony’s mind filled in, though, he didn’t think that was quite right for some reason, like he was one letter off from a triple-word-score.  It had been impossible, of course, for him to travel on his own without being Bonded, and his parents felt they owed it to the world to keep him at home, but, with an Alpha, he could go wherever his Steve-shaped permission slip allowed. It could be…possibly not entirely awful, though the idea of it, going places, seeing some of the world, almost seemed like one of those thoughts that couldn’t quite take hold in his mind, just sort of wisped through without really planting itself there.  He could almost imagine it.  Almost.  But, it was like a possibility that existed for someone else.  Someone who maybe looked a bit like him, but acted a bit less like him.
“Sorry,” Steve finally said between short, gasping breaths. “My asthma…God, I’d forgotten how this felt,” he coughed. “I’m literally going to be the first Avenger to die laughing.” It wasn’t funny. It really, really wasn’t.  They were stuck in some prison cell, surrounded by Hydra-lite, and Steve was all but useless, and now he was cackling maniacally around fits of coughing. There was absolutely nothing funny about the situation. Nothing at all. Zero. Zip.
Steve nodded and threw a leg over one side of Tony’s stomach, straddling him.  He could feel the hard, round head of Tony’s cock against the seam of his ass, leaving a damp path as it sought entry.  Steve reached a hand behind him and wrapped it around Tony’s cock, lifting himself up on his knees and slowly guiding the head to his entrance.  He sank down, just a bit, eyes going wide as he felt his hole stretching to accommodate Tony’s cock.
“God-damn little cock-sucking whore fucking bit me!,” Rumlow insisted, his face scrunching up in pain.   “He is yours to deal with as you see fit.  My Lord,” Rumlow ground out through his teeth. “But, you had better make him pay for this.”
Steve sucked in a breath, pausing for a moment.  “Guess they were for you, anyway,” he said finally.
“Tony,” Steve said again, his voice low and urgent.  “Tony, get up. Slowly. Get behind me. Tony, please. Please listen to me. To—”
Steve closed his eyes.  A bright light burst behind his lids, brighter than any normal light, blinding him. His stomach swooped.  Pain seared through his skull, like it was breaking apart from the inside, or needed to, he wasn’t sure which.  He thought he was glad he hadn’t eaten, and then the world shifted and he was weightless for a flash of a second, floating, suspended, then…down.
Tony gripped Steve’s hips, making Steve let out a cry, then drew back until his cockhead caught on Steve’s rim and thrust all the way in again.  He set a hard, pounding rhythm, fingers digging into Steve’s ass as he held him in place.  Steve could hear the slap of flesh on flesh, the only sound other than the occasional guttural grunt from Tony.  It would be over fairly quickly, Steve thought, though he didn’t really care.  It didn’t seem to matter.  The count was done.  He could just
He poured himself a cup of coffee and sat down at the small kitchen table with his plate in front of him.  Reaching out, he grabbed the bottle of syrup that was standing next to the salt and pepper shakers, dousing his pancakes with a liberal coating.  His tablet was on the side table by the sofa where he left it yesterday, probably still trying in vain to show him how to cook an omelet, so he got up and went to pick that up, closing out the browser tabs with a baleful look at one of the YouTube videos entitled “The Perfect Omelet.”   Thumbs down, Tony decided firmly, recalling last night’s disastrous attempt at cooking.  Granted, some of that could probably be attributed to being terrified he was in monumental amounts of trouble, but it had to be at least 60/40 the fault of “1-2-3 Omelet,” he figured.
“Thirty minutes ago, you threw me at a giant rock monster,” Steve reminded Tony, pressing his hips down a bit, and ah, God, there, his breath hissed out in a rush as Tony’s finger dipped inside him, finally, finally, God, yes. He squirmed, searching for more, needing something else because as wonderful as this felt, it wasn’t enough, the more he wanted, needed, something, just more, a little more, if he could just…”Oh…” Steve stuttered.  “Oh, that’s…good, Tony.  God, Tony, don’t stop,” Steve begged, pushing himself down more, clamping tightly around Tony’s finger.  Steve managed to look up at Tony’s face long enough to see a roguish grin forming, but then lost the plot entirely when Tony pressed a second finger in, stretching him slowly, but not stopping until both fingers were buried deep inside him.   And then Tony was moving his fingers, doing something, something deep inside Steve, pressing against the tight ring of muscle at his entrance and forcing it to soften and stretch while his fingers moved, and probed, and Steve found himself gasping for air because there was something, something so close, right there, and it was…it was…almost right there—holy fuck—Steve had time to think as Tony scissored his fingers up and down sharply and some kind of pinprick spasm of pain-pleasure burst inside Steve as his head snapped back against the bed, fingers gouging holes into the sheets.
“And Pepper.  Happy.  It’ll be fun,” Tony said, while everyone continued to give him looks that clearly said they thought this was nuts.  It probably was.  Well, no probably about it.  He looked over at Steve, catching his eye with a whiff of an apologetic grimace.
Tony didn’t respond at first, then finally sighed, and lifted his head back up to look at Steve.  “It was nothing. A trick of the mind or the light, that is all. It does not matter what I thought I saw.”
“Sorry.  I seem to be doing this all wrong.  I didn’t actually know Howard all that well,” Steve continued.  “He was there for Rebirth and then a bit during the War, but…” Steve shrugged.  “We weren’t exactly close.”
“You sure you don’t want me to go with you to D.C.? Or…or Boston?” Steve asked.  The words came out slurry and thick, like they were born of part yawn.  He was tired, that was true.  But, the weariness of earlier was gone, replaced with the desire for sleep, not the need for rest, and that was all the difference in the world.  That was Tony’s doing, he knew.  He wondered if he did the same for Tony.  It was hard to be sure.  Hard to be sure of anything, except…there were things he was sure of, and this had become one of them, sometime between the gym and the sounds of home.
“Bet that was a tight race,” Steve grimaced, then realized the other man couldn’t see his expression, though you wouldn’t know it by how the lawyer’s snort of cut-off laughter.
“No kidding. I think you’re drooling,” Rhodey pointed out, swiping his hand over his chin for emphasis.
Tony took a sip of punch and caught Sugar purse her lips and exchange a look with Rebecca as a trio joined their group.  An older, rotund man with salt-and-pepper hair, who looked slightly over-inflated, like he had insulted Harry Potter’s parents, plopped down in a barrel chair across from Tony, and a blond man around Tony’s age with wide-spaced gray eyes and thin, delicate features, and a stunning woman with golden hair that fell in waves around a movie-star worthy face took up the empty space on the sofa next to him.
“There’s waffles in the oven.  And some bacon,” Steve told him with a small smile.  He dropped the bottle of water into the recycle bin and headed off down the hall towards the bathroom to go smell all manly and Irish or whatever.  “Save me some coffee, would ya?”
“Seems like an exciting way for you to grow up.  Someone like that as your old man.  For you, anyway.  Someone who would, I don’t know, get you, I guess.  But, you said…yesterday, you kind of mentioned you had, ah, issues.  With your father,” Steve said.
The King was shoving his breeches down and pulling his cock out, thick and hard and wet at the head where it was leaking. He reached over and coated it with more of the same warm oil he had used on his hands, then moved forward on the bed until Steve could feel the blunt head of it pressing against his hole.
The drone buzzed downwards, just behind the guy, who had, unfortunately, put on a shirt sometime between his afternoon workout and the evening’s dance practice.  Thankfully, the laundry gods were smiling on Tony because the shirt had to be at least two sizes too small.
Shaking himself, Steve turned to follow the path the Omega had taken into the keep, with Bucky striding along next to him and Yinsen following behind.
“Wow.  Did you ever fuck up,” Tony said, running a hand through his hair.  “What did my dad tell Fury and Rogers to get them to go along with this?  Because, news flash, literally no one wants to come back to me.  ‘Cept maybe for one reason, I suppose, which your Captain Rogers doesn’t seem all that interested in, though I guess that makes sense if I’m a duty-fuck.  Knot and think of America?  Stuff of dreams.  You put that on the recruitment poster?  I mean, hey, fine by me, but if you were aiming for some deep Bonding mojo-bullshit that gets the good Captain to watch for power lines when he saves the cat up the tree, you picked the wrong Omega by a mile and then some.”
Steve looked up at him from where he had been studying the weight and strength trainer with a rather dubious expression.  “Didn’t you challenge a known terrorist to come after you on national television?” Steve asked with a frown.  “And give him your home address?”
“Look.  I can imagine how it is, don’t get me wrong.  You’ve got a new Omega.  You want to impress him, keep him happy.  I mean, look at him!  He’s beautiful, of course you do! Not the first Alpha to find himself doing crazy things right after Bonding, am I right?  You just gotta…well, slow down a bit, is all I’m saying.  Take the foot off the gas, you know?  We keep this business at SHIELD quiet, no harm, no foul,” Obie suggested with a knowing look.  “I mean, SHIELD, they’re one thing.  You’re there and all.  But the US Military?  Well, now, that’s another.  They aren’t going to buy weapons designed by an Omega.  Just aren’t going to do it.  I don’t care who you know.”
“That’s because I’m in denial,” Steve replied evenly to Tony’s surprised bark of laughter. “Yep. Just embracing the fugue of denial,” Steve reiterated with a nod. “Look, I’m terrified, too, Tony,” he continued quietly, like he was sharing a secret, and maybe he was, Tony considered. “We’re going to have the responsibility of raising a child. I think that’s the only rational state of mind. But, I’m not worried about the you and me part of it, and if we get that right, we’ve got a pretty good head start on not screwing up too badly.”
Tony followed Captain Rogers out of the conference room, where Agent Coulson waited in the hallway outside the door, arms crossed over his chest like a pencil-pushing sentinel who would definitely send you a strongly-worded memo if you didn’t replace the toner cartridge.
The diner, as promised, was clean-ish, bright silver metal lining too much of it, like it was trying too hard for a fifties vibe and managed to overshoot nostalgia and land on garish, but there were a few people at the stools that lined the counter, even on such a dreary evening, so Tony held out hope. He and Steve slid into opposite sides of a pale green leather covered booth, and Steve called out to the waitress, by name, Tony noted, for two coffees.
“Genetic?” Steve questioned with a raised eyebrow, though he sounded at least interested.  Steve liked the ‘bots, that much Tony knew.    It was a pretty blatant play for a distraction, but it seemed to be doing the job.
Oh, that.  Well, shit.  Ok, he’d missed that one entirely.  “Um, no.  No preference. Whatever you want is fine.  That…you…top is fine,” Steve managed and thanked God for the darkness now because he was certain he was beet red.  He saw Tony nod a few times and then lean in towards Steve.
The alien’s face contorted and his hips stuttered, ramming into Tony with a final hard thrust as a warm rush of thick...something...pulsed inside him.  It was thick and almost oily, though not unpleasantly so Tony decided after a moment. He could feel some of it leaking from his hole as the alien’s hips juddered, and he thrust deep into Tony one last time.
“Thanks again for...whatever you did,” Steve added, handing Stark back his phone. “That was a lot faster than me trying to figure out this place, apparently.  We’re having--or trying to have, I guess--this romantic weekend thing, and, well...so, anyway, thanks.”
“Don’t,” Tony bit out. It came out shakier than he meant it in his head, but he’d said it, and just the act of getting the word out was a release.  “I’m going.  I need to—Steve,” Tony blurted out with a surprised gulp.
“You’re lying. Why would you say that?” Steve demanded. “I know it wasn’t just--what you said. To you. It wasn’t, I know it.  You don’t have to do this.  I could stay. We could...we could be, I don’t know, something.”
Steve could only stare at Tony as a slowly dawning understanding settled into him.  A stranger appearing at night in the middle of a terrible storm, in need of help.  An entreaty for entry into the safety of a home.  The Shadowman will get you, if you don’t watch out, Steve sing-songed in his mind, the way Lizzie and Ian used to do, but not William, who didn’t want to believe in such nonsense.  The Man of the Mountain, his mother called him, who came to ferry the worthy through the shadow realm.  He could feel, in that moment, all the failings of his body in a way that the gradual years rarely allowed.  He could smell the sickly sweet stink of decay on himself.  He could see the blood slow as it pumped its way through veins that stood out in heavy relief against flesh that sagged and stretched.
“Good, Steve. That’s good. You’re doing so well for me,” Tony told him, voice warm and almost unspeakably tender.  It was like a balm, warm and soothing atop everything else.  He was good.  He was good for Tony.  He was doing well.  Nothing else mattered.  There had been something, but it was behind him now, and he hovered.  Everything below was small. Insignificant.
It was Jarvis who answered the door, of course.  On the first knock, too.  Probably had an ear plastered to one side of door, Tony figured, smiling up at the familiar face.
“Cap, shit!  Hey, sorry man, we didn’t mean anything, we were just--” Rollins stammered, backing away with his palms up and out in front of him.
“Yeah.  Yeah, I’m okay.  It’s just…” Steve began, looking down at Tony.  He brought a hand up and brushed a lock of hair off Tony’s forehead.
“Be careful,” she cut in.  “The safe has an alarm. Something Howard designed, so God only knows.  It’s also rigged to seal the room if the wrong code is punched more than once.  This,” she continued, holding up a small device that looked a bit like a pager with red and green wires coming out of it, “should get you the combination.  However, I can’t vouch for what other measures Howard may have used, so please try not to, I don’t know, blow out a wall or something. Whatever you think of Stane, we are his guests.  That’s just…
“You’re kind of devious when you want to be, you know that, right?” Tony asked, walking over to stand by Steve.
“I am fine, Jarvis.  Really.  I am.  Steve,” Tony began hesitantly, taking the cloth and swiping it gently over the silver metal in a small, circular motion before handing it back to Dum-E’s waiting pincer.  “Steve’s nice.  You’ll like him,” Tony rushed out, glancing over his shoulder at Jarvis.
Steve wanted the company to be a success.  That was the whole point of all this, and if that was what Steve wanted, then, well, Tony would give it to him.  It was as simple as that.  In a way, it was calming, to have something he knew he could do for Steve, something that would make Steve happy.  I can take care of him, Tony thought.  Not the way he wanted to, but the way Steve wanted him to, and that was the point, wasn’t it?  Hadn’t Steve shown him that these past months?
He was watching Steve with a sharp, keen expression, the same one he used on the schematics for the prototype he had been fiddling with while Steve painted.  Like he was trying to figure something out, get the pieces to work the way he knew they should work, and coming up frustrated, but…enjoying it, Steve realized with a warm pang.  It had been a long time since anyone thought figuring Steve out was anything other than a job or a chore, let alone something enjoyable, and even as a part of him bristled at the scrutiny and wanted to push back, pull away, run, there was another part of him that couldn’t help but be drawn to that kind of attention.  Chase that feeling of being
He clicked open the cap and squeezed a generous portion into his hand, then rubbed his hands together, coating them with the silky, warm gel.  He added a dollop more to his fingers, then reached down and pressed one against the rim of Tony’s hole, feeling it flutter and tighten.  Steve pressed his finger in, and heard Tony sigh, his legs splaying wider, cock twitching where it lay still hard and leaking across his stomach.  Steve pumped his finger a few times, working it deeper into the tight, hot channel, then added a second.  Tony moaned and arched his back, the cords of his neck bowing taut for a moment.  His eyes were dark and heavy-lidded, and as Steve watched, he bit his bottom lip, then released with quick, sharp pants of air.  Steve could feel Tony pushing down on his fingers, rocking himself a bit, his body already thrumming with a flurry of impatient movement.
“It’s true,” Tony insisted. “I’m telling you, and in a minute, my lawyer’s going to be telling you, you can’t talk to him.”
“Huh?  Oh, yeah. Definitely,” Tony smiled, remembering his earlier offer.  Had dinner only been a little over an hour ago?  It seemed like a wholly different version of himself, who sat across from Steve and worried—fretted—over what Jarvis might say.  “Raiders.  You’ll love it.”
“I tried—I wanted,” Steve stammered, breath coming in rapid bursts.  “I wanted to draw you, but I couldn’t—I didn’t know. I tried. But, this, you’re—Oh, God,” Steve groaned as Tony’s thumb pushed the seam of skin on the head of his cock apart and rubbed.  “You’re so much better.  Like this.  So much better than I—than I thought.  I like,” Steve broke off, boding going taut as pleasure thrummed through him when slid a third finger inside, thrust deep and curled them upwards, hitting the spot that made Steve’s vision go white.
.  Then, it turned out he was wrong about a lot of things he thought he knew about the war, about what they were doing, and how they were doing it.  And now, it felt sometimes like he couldn't trust his own instincts.  Didn’t know which way to go and just kept floundering, hoping he’d finally land on sand that didn’t shift out from under him.
“Stuff it, Neil, I’m trying, alright?” Tony muttered, taking a sip of lukewarm coffee as he watched the neon-colored image of the astrophysicist helpfully inform him that dreams of the future are filled with gadgets.  “Steve, he has a…really important job-thingy to do, you know?” Tony said, looking over his shoulder at U, who nodded his arm.  Encouragingly, Tony thought.  “Saving the world, protecting freedom and America, and, I don’t know, puppies. Whatever.  Important stuff, okay?  Not like he wanted to go. There was an actual helicopter.  It was very dramatic.”
“I really am sorry about the trouble, Phil,” Steve said, actually managing to pull off contrite if you squinted.
God, he hated this, all these little decisions when he didn't know how Steve would react. It was exhausting. Familiar, but exhausting. The last few weeks, he'd shed this constant anxiety over every little damn thing, one decision at a time, so gradually, he hadn't really noticed until he was faced again with trying to figure out what the right choice was every single fucking time. It was a shell game, that's what it was. Trying to pick the one with the ball under it while it kept moving, kept moving so fast you could never keep up, you could never really win it, and God, did he ever hate that.
“I think they can’t wait to ask about it at the press conference,” Tony told him with a grimace. “Pepper’s downstairs getting everything set up.  I guess a couple of the local networks want to carry it live or something. I should let her know about this.”
“Apparently, there’s a video on here,” Steve said, picking up one of the iPads that sat by their plates while Tony frowned at it disdainfully.  “Supposed to walk us through the meal. Even has a live-feed of the kitchen.”  Tony supposed that had been part of the introduction he’d missed while trying not to curl into the fetal position.  Steve held the tablet up, then set it back down, apparently as uninterested in a narrated meal as Tony was.  “More a steak and potatoes kind of guy, to be honest,” Steve admitted with a slight frown.  “To new experiences, I guess,” Steve proposed, clinking his glass of water against where Tony’s sat on the table.
“I…don’t understand that reference, but I guess I’ll take it,” Steve said, grinning up at Tony with a wide, somewhat goofy grin that made him look less supersoldier and more Air Bud ready to take his shot from the foul line.   “You’re beautiful, Tony.  You’re so beautiful.  How could you think I wouldn’t want you?”
“Who?  I haven’t—“ Steve started as a pit of realization opened where his stomach used to be.  “Oh.”  The woman in the gym.  The friendly, highly-inquisitive woman in the gym.
A low, pleased chuckle from behind him told Tony that he might have said that out loud.   Steve pulled out again, then pounded in, hitting that spot deep inside Tony, sending bright bursts of pleasure through Tony’s body. Steve’s rhythym sped up, hips snapping hard against Tony’s ass, plunging his hard cock over and over into Tony’s warm, welcoming heat, until Tony could only manage mindless sounds, grunts and groans that matched Steve’s thrusts.  The thrusts faltered, slowed, lost their finesse, and a moment later, Steve came with a broken-off shout, filling Tony’s body with warm jets of cum that dribbled out of his loosened hole as Steve pulled out and pushed a few last times, chasing the final moments of orgasm.
Their table was situated at the corner of the restaurant, where large glass windows opened on to a view of the Bellagio’s massive fountains as they rose and fell in an undulating dance.  Even Tony had to admit that it was a pretty spectacular distraction, as those things went.  Roses and champagne had been at their table waiting for them.  He’d have to remember to thank Pepper for her subtlety later, Tony thought with a slight grimace as he looked back down at the menu and half-listened to the waiter go over the chef’s recommendations.  Steve was explaining his allergies while the waiter nodded and pointed at things on the menu.  Tony was, he could admit to himself, trying not to moon like some lovesick teenager who found his boyfriend’s allergies adorable, because that would be pathetic.  He was pretty sure that would be pathetic.
“Oh. Well, that's...that was...that was very thoughtful of you, Tony. Thanks,” Steve replied, hands going to his hips as he swiveled slightly where he stood, like he couldn't quite figure out what to do with his body.
“Okay, you cannot just call the chimney,” Rhodey objected.  “We’re not five.  We’ll divvy up the available structural cover options when we get up there like the grown men we are.”
“Nah, me and Pepper, we’re good. I mean, it didn’t work out, us together.  For a lot of reasons.  Mostly on me,” Tony said as they strolled.  He took another bite of cheesecake from the box and made a happy, humming sound that turned into a laugh as he caught Steve watching him with a sort of dazed intentness.  Soldier boy was into him, no doubt about it, he thought, holding the fork between his lips and slide it out slowly, then grinned wickedly at Steve, who blinked and shook his head a bit, letting out a short of shaky, deprecating chuckle.
“Sure thing, Cap.  Like I said, no big deal. Over.  Done.  Kaput.  Forgotten,” Tony responded, faster than he intended.  He turned away before Steve could say whatever it was Steve was clearly girding himself to say.
“I have a Fazioli at the Tower.  When you come by, I’ll play for you.  Whatever you want,” Tony promised, his voice quavering oddly at the thought.  Nervousness, Tony thought.  Excitement.
“It’s…it’s gorgeous,” Tony breathed out in awe, holding the watch up higher in front of him as he studied it.
“Jesus, Steve.  We’re gonna be millionaires in a week or whatever.  Like, you can help your friends, but I can’t help mine?  Is that it?” Brock demanded, shooting a glare at Steve.  “Because I don’t think that’s very fair, do you?”
A set of opaque glass-fronted doors loomed in front of him with a sign next to them naming it OR1 and helpfully telling him that masks and gloves were required.  Tony skidded to a halt in front of the doors and reached out to hit the large, round button on the wall.  His hand stilled, midair, as his eyes caught on the watch for that one, split second.
The city lights glittered in the background.  The skyscrapers were lit up in chessboard-like patterns of light and dark.  Above, he could make out Ursa Major, of course.  Perseus and Gemini. Even a bit of Andromeda, despite the city lights obscuring everything.

“No, but see…” Tony started, then shoved his hands in his pockets and trailed off, looking off down the Strip where the sun was glinting off the mirrored glass. “It’s terrible timing.  It is,” Tony said, giving Steve a quick look as he walked over to the railing and wrapped his hands around it.  “Not sorry about it, though.  I should be.  Bringing you into all this…this craziness.  It’s dangerous.  More dangerous than you probably realize, not that I think for a minute that would actually put you off the idea,” Tony scoffed, shooting Steve a flat smile before going back to looking at the whirl of signs and billboards that beckoned people to come lose their money.  “I can’t seem to…to
He wondered how long it would be before he really did start to go mad.  He wondered if maybe he wouldn’t notice if--when--that happened. It was something to think about,  he supposed, but what else could he do except try to get by? And right now, the best way to get by, the
Bed was, however, a place where a bathroom didn’t exist and this poor design of a living space was going to become an issue shortly, Tony realized after a few more minutes of wallowing in his nest of pillows and blankets.  The bladder really was the weak link in hiding schemes, no doubt about it.
The fact that Steve was trying, that he cared enough to be interested, to learn, for Tony’s sake…well, that was something Tony wasn’t sure how to deal with.
“Don’t worry, I’m just glad you’re okay,” she said with a shaky, tittering laugh, like she wasn’t quite sure how to process the wrongness of what she was seeing, the way the needle on a record player skips a groove and then finds the track again.  “These buildings have been spackled and patched more than my mother-in-law.  I’m sure maintenance can fix it in no time. Just toss those in the trash, would you?”
“No.  Really.  Stay.  It’s fine. Really,” Tony said quickly.  “Honestly, it’s fine,” Tony repeated in a wavering voice, turning back to the railing and sucking in a deep breath.  It was fine.
“About fucking time,” Barton grumbled as he swept into the kitchen and grabbed for the bag of sliced bread, plopping a couple of pieces in the toaster, looking back and forth between Tony and Steve like watching a tennis match.  Tony realized he was grinning like a fool and didn’t care, because Steve was smiling back at him, open and guileless and it was like stepping out into the sun after you’ve been cold all day, every part of him warming in response, everything brighter and better somehow.  He could do this.   He could do this and not fuck it up.  So help him, God.
“Thanks.  I mean it.  I really don’t want this to be, you know, a thing,” Tony admitted, still rooted to the spot at the bottom of the steps where he’d come to a halt.  He could feel the cold air whipping in through the door, watched it ruffle Steve’s hair where he stood braced against the doorframe.  He finally got his leaden legs to move, shuffling forward until he was even with Steve.  Everything about this felt off.  He was supposed to leave in triumph or angry resolve, not some vague sense that…that what?  That he’d hurt Steve somehow, which, hell, should feel good. Satisfying.  The words ‘hollow victory’ rang through his head in Pepper’s voice like some inner angel.  He hadn’t known a hollow victory meant you walked away feeling empty when you got everything you wanted.  This wasn’t how it was supposed to work.
“I must return to the King’s chambers,” Steve told her.  It was true, he realized.  Tony had said to stay in tonight, hadn’t he?  Something about all the strangers about.  In his panic and turmoil, Steve had forgotten the order.  Or not cared.  He cleared his throat and tried to brush past her, as he had with the guards, but she reached out and wrapped her hand around his wrist as he passed.  She wore long, metal coverings on the ends of her fingers like small spikes, and he felt them dig into his skin where she held him.
Tony was gone when he woke, but Steve could hear the camp stirring already. The day of the demonstration dawned early, with the sun barely peeking over the distant mountaintops and just starting to ripple over the sands when Steve first ducked out of the tent. They still had a ways to travel to reach the site General Ross had chosen for the Jerak’ho’s demonstration, and the camp was already a hive of activity as servants and slaves hurried to pack and soldiers readied themselves for the long walk next to the caravan.
“A thing?” Steve asked, confused for a moment as he couldn’t remember Tony mentioning anything else on his schedule or…”You..oh…Oh.”
“Tony,” Tony supplied helpufully, wondering what in the world he’d stumbled into. Clearly the man was overwhelmed by having Tony show up on his doorstep, which was not without some satisfaction, Tony had to admit. He flashed one of his best smiles, though the effort might have suffered a bit, since he was currently dripping a puddle on the cracked linoleum under his feet. “I’m here to—“
we were going to do when we got back to the room, were it not for our delightfully supportive--if somewhat annoyingly present--friend group,” Tony suggested.
Steve frowned at that.  Rocky start?  Okay, there had been the whole thing about the helicarrier’s engine running on electricity, but Iron Man had never made an issue out of Steve’s adjustment to the new technology around him.  Heck, it was Iron Man showing him how to work most of the stuff Stark sent over.  How many times had he sat something down in front of Steve, tapping a metal finger on whatever it was, his mechanical voice informing Steve that, ‘Cap, you’ll be happy to know, this runs on some kind of electricity,’?  And Steve would say, ‘Funny, Tin Man,’ and they’d laugh at their stupid jokes, and Iron Man would explain the bright, shiny new thing in his careful, patient way.
Obie’s gaze swept over Tony as he entered the room.  It lasted only long enough for it to register, before it slipped away and focused on Steve, but Tony felt Steve’s arm stiffen, the muscles bunching under Tony’s fingers.
On the heels of his tongue, Tony’s beard scraped against the delicate skin there, creating a tidal wave of dueling sensations that sent pulses of hot need down Steve’s cock. It was glorious. Steve felt like he was in freefall, awash in feeling, waiting to hit some kind of ground that seemed further and further away.  He chased the feeling, wantonly pushing his ass back against the wet heat of Tony’s mouth.
“I think so. I hope so,” Tony replied, then grimaced.  “It wasn’t easy, finding a way. It isn’t as if this is done very often.”
“I bought the men working the wheel,” Tony said.  “They, and whatever family they may have here, will be sent to the Castle to work after we leave.”
Tony looked up to find Steve glancing over his shoulder down at him.  He slung his arm up and allowed Tony to duck under, so he was flush against Steve’s side.  Tony tipped his face up and got a quick kiss, barely a brush of lips, but enough.  He sighed.
Or maybe because as Tony’s gaze roved over his body, he could see the other man react, pupils blown wide, breath coming in shortened gasps, body rigid and taut.  He was sure Tony was hard underneath the tablet lying forgotten on his lap.  Unbidden, an odd, heady sense of power swept through him at the sight, what he could do to Tony just by letting him do nothing more than see his body.
what it would do to Tony, this one more betrayal smoothed over a hundred others like another layer of mortar.  For putting keeping Tony over loving him.   That most of all.
The water was warm, almost decadently so, and Steve nearly moaned with pleasure as he sank into the heat.  Tony motioned him over, and he sat on the circular stone bench that ringed the tub, twisting his back to Tony at Tony’s urging.  Tony picked up some kind of tan sponge and dipped it into the water, then took a sliver of precious soap and lathered it over the porous material and started scrubbing it up and down Steve’s back.  Steve’s head dropped down with a soft groan, and he leaned forward, offering up more of his back to Tony’s ministrations.
“Getting your stuff.  Talking to the asshole about what is for sharing and what isn’t.  I don’t know,” Bucky shrugged. “What?  She does stuff like this.”
“Eh, the lawyer thing was all Barnes, I’m fairly sure.  Aaaaaaand,” Tony said, drawing out the word.  “Jet or no jet, I wouldn’t wish Natasha’s wrath on anyone.  Nothing I can do about it, if he wants to make it a fight.  Pretty sure we can out-shark this Murdock character, but I admit, I was hoping to avoid getting into it.”
“I—I’m sorry.  I know. I push.  I do, and I tell myself not to.  That I need to back off, and then I—“ Tony rushed out.
“I feel you up there, with your silent, furry judgment,” Tony said to the tree where Joshua was probably curled up in his rounded next of leaves and twigs, wiling the night away dreaming of big stacks of acorns, fluffy nests of dried leaves and bent twigs, missiles that split into smaller missiles once they reach a designated height and acquire their target, or whatever it was that squirrels dreamed about.  Probably, mostly the latter, Tony thought.
“No.  That part’s actually pretty familiar,” Steve said, returning the smile.  “I mean this.  You and me, just sitting here.  I’m not sure how I’m supposed to act around you, to be honest.”
Of course, that meant the man would be leaving soon.  He would go back to his own people. The Others. He wanted to ask the man to stay, but Tyber would never allow it.  Already, Tyber demanded the man leave before the leaves started turning, healed or not. And that would be soon.
“Stop, Buck, come on.  It’s not your fault, Buck. None of it is.  If it were me, you’d have done the same thing,” Steve insisted.  “Maybe not the
Tony could practically feel the rush of blood warming his face, and he was sure Steve had to notice the way his pulse jumped against the thin skin of his wrist as Steve placed the watch around it and snapped the clasp into place with a small click that made Tony’s heart skip like it hit a speed bump before racing on, vying with his mind for which would overreact first.  Steve still had Tony’s hand in his, holding it there, his thumb just over the pulsepoint, rubbing a gentle circle into the skin.
“None taken,” Tony replied flatly.  “Your skill with the lance is quite impressive,” Tony said, which Steve knew was the exact minimum of expected praise. “The purse is yours.  May you use it well.”
“I’m here,” Tony managed, finding the words surprisingly difficult to muster at the moment. Tony took one look at Steve and decided to save the big tour for at some point in time when he wouldn’t rather have Steve on all fours. So, probably never. Who cared about kitchens and living rooms anyway? He wasn’t sure why he’d even had those put in.
“I’m so sorry about this, Mr. Stark. I don’t know how they do this.   I swear to God they weren’t here five minutes ago,” a well-dressed woman with a gold name badge pinned to her blazer lapel said appearing at Steve’s shoulder.  “Security has been trying to clear them out all day, but we have so much traffic in here between casino patrons and hotel guests, they manage to crawl back in.”
Tony glanced over at Steve and tried to picture him with a paunch and receding hairline.  For some reason, it made him think of Obie, and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat, turning to look out the window instead.
“Hmmm?  Oh, yeah, right.  Like the punching bag,” Tony repeated dully.  “Well, night then,” he said, then stood there stupidly for a moment, as if Steve was going to stop him, but he didn’t, and Tony was too tired to lie to himself that it didn’t hurt.  But, he was apparently a sadist, so heard his own voice cutting into the darkness, “So, ah, tomorrow.  I thought, maybe, if you wanted, we could check out that new Thai place down on the corner.  If you want to see more art I can’t understand, there’s always the MoMA.  Or we could try the Guggenheim.  The space is incredible.  You’d probably like—“
I’m sure people do, since people do that anyway, but especially with Steve being Steve, so there is sort of a public interest element, almost like a Royal baby or something. I think early on, they’d be sort of exasperated, but kind of amused by it all, because they aren’t ready, and Tony’s kind of annoyed that here he is going to MIT and doing all this great stuff with the company when his parents die and all anyone seems to care about is when there will be a baby.  Then, later, after they’ve tried and it hasn’t worked, it is harder, and those questions hurt a lot more.  Feels like judgment.  Like he’s failed at something that should be natural and easy, right?  Heck, he spent so much time worrying about NOT getting pregnant and here he is, hating himself a bit more each time it doesn’t happen. Then Afghanistan happens, and it really is him, he’s sure of it now, with his heart and all, the doctors say it just isn’t “advisable.”  His body isn’t “conducive to carrying a child to term,” which is a very clinical, doctor-sort of way of saying he’s too messed up to do this thing they both want so badly, that this wonder he has created that lets him be everything he never dared hope to be has taken away something he didn’t even quite know how much he wanted until he lost it.  He didn’t know he was making a trade, but, of course, the universe works that way. Steve tells him not to worry, that he’s happy with them the way they are, that he loves Tony and is so proud of the man he’s become and wouldn’t trade that for anything, but Tony knows. He sees it in the longing looks sometimes, the way Steve holds the children eager parents hand to him while they snap pictures on their phones, in how he still has those sketches he made for the second bedroom at the cabin all tucked away where he thinks Tony won’t find them, the ones with Winne the Pooh and Tigger and Piglet with his kite on a blustery day that edged into a blanket of stars, always the stars.  He probably didn’t even realize he’d drawn the night sky the way it looked that first night they sat out on the deck and looked at the heavens through Tony’s telescope, but Tony knew, and understood why Steve wanted that to be the last thing their child would see before they closed their eyes, even if Steve didn’t.
“This isn’t necessary,” Tony objected mildly. Technically, it probably was, and, truth be told, he’d always rather liked it when Steve used his strength to treat him like he was infinitely breakable.
“Okay.  Twenty questions.  I’ll start,” Tony mumbled, twisting his head to look up at where Steve reclined.  Good angle of elevation, Tony thought, mouth flattening into a thin line.  When had his first thoughts when he looked at Steve turned into these things he didn’t want to think?  “Is it animal, plant or mineral?  Animal?  You don’t say.  Bigger than a breadbox?  Sometimes?  Interesting answer.  Fur-covered?  No.  Okay, let me think.  How many legs?  None.  Well, now you’re just being technical about it.  Tentacles?  You’ve been on the Internet again. I warned you about that.  Don’t tell me about how helpful it is.  You know Clint runs those searches on purpose so Google will auto-fill, don’t you?  Of course you do.  It’s an octopus, and you are not very original, Cap.  An evil Nazi octopus?  Fine, if you want to get political about it.  I still win, which means I get…” Tony stopped and cleared his throat, letting his eyes fall closed for a moment before he forced them open again and stuck his fingers in the door one more time.  “I get…can you just move your hand?  Just a little.  No throwing things, no punching, no hand-jive or God forbid, the Macarena.  Just move your hand a bit for me, Steve.  Please?  Can you do that?  Just move your hand.  Right here.  Feel that?   Can you squeeze my hand?  Come on, Steve.  Please.  Please, just—just a bit. For me.  Please, Steve.”
“I think you’re the first person to say that about the Court,” Tony barked out a laugh, mouth turning down.
“Okay,” Steve replied, letting out a low, deprecating chuckle that he quickly swallowed when he felt Tony’s hands cup his ass cheeks and spread him apart.  Cool air hit his exposed hole.  He felt himself tense up. He couldn’t help it.  The whole thing with Tony left him feeling a bit vulnerable and off-kilter, but this was something entirely new, and he had no idea what to expect, other than that the people in the couple of porn videos he’d watched seem to really, really enjoy it, even if Brock was right that you couldn’t really get off on it so what was the point.
“Come on,” Tony said, tugging at Steve’s sleeve just below the shoulder.  “We can look at the Cezannes and you can tell me why these paintings of fruit bowls are vastly different from the one we have in the kitchen.”
“Well, I dare say someone needs to,” Jarvis replied pointedly.   “By demonstrating your feelings, I take it you…”
“This is Sam.  Sam Wilson.  Sam, this is Tony Stark and Colonel James Rhodes,” Natasha said by way of introduction.
Steve frowned down at the phone, then nodded once, seemingly to himself.  His hands were surprisingly steady as he guided the wire into place. As soon as the connecting wire was plugged in, the reactor whirred to bright, wonderful life.  Tony’s heart skipped, stuttered, then found its rhythm again. Tony let out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding, then sagged backwards. Everything still hurt.  He still couldn’t quite get his body to cooperate, and the feeling kept returning in spurts, then receding, like it was toying with him. But, he was alive, and Steve was here, and that seemed like all that mattered in the whole world right now.  He rubbed a hand at his head and squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them and glanced over at Obie.
“My concubine finds himself rather amusing this morning, I think,” Tony grinned and wrapped his hand around Steve’s cock again, stroking lazily, thrusting his hips up as he did so his own cock rutted through the springy hairs at Steve’s groin.

“Okay, I am definitely not calling you Jim,” Tony scoffed, holding his hands out in front of him as he thought of Rhodey.
“Great. Great, just great.  Have a laugh,” Steve said, shaking his head, but his mouth was pulling into a smile.  “It’s not as bad as you think.”
“I know it looks bad,” Tony said, holding up his hands.  “Mostly, it just needs cleaning.” Something moved again in the corner of the room, making that metallic crinkling sound like it was digging into the bottom of a chip bag.  Good thing he didn’t really need much in the way of sleep.  “And an exterminator.”
As he maneuvered the Audi through the maze of cabs, delivery trucks and work crews that seemed to live on New York streets, Tony decided not to dwell much on the fact that he knew where Steve lived.  Some crappy walk-up in Brooklyn, not so very different from what had, for a little while, at least, been their apartment in Boston.  That particular fire hazard of a building had long ago gone condo during the real estate boom when half of Boston decided to gentrify, but New York held on to shitty apartments like they were grandmother’s pearls, some family heirloom no one liked, but you had to keep around half out of sentiment, half out of obligation.  In the seat next to him, the corner of the manila folder with the divorce paperwork peeked out from under the sleeve of his coat.  He’d spent part of last night paging through them.  Pepper had helpfully tabbed the signature blocks with bright yellow, strangely exuberant ‘Sign Here’ sticky notes.
Tony nuzzled at Steve’s cock, breathing deep, his nose brushing the coarse hairs in the vee of Steve’s legs. He pushed Steve’s thighs up, spreading him wide, then bent again between Steve’s legs, kissing a long trail from Steve’s knee down to the meaty flesh of his inner thigh where Steve’s cock strained for attention once again.  Tony peered up at him from under his brow, growled low--a rumbly sound that reverberated behind Steve’s ribs--licked over a spot, and then ducked his head until all Steve could see were dark curls where his cock rested, leaking fluid in a thin line.
“I love you, too,” Steve replied.  “More than anything.  I have—there’s something I have to tell you, though, Tony.”
.  Except he’d wanted to see Tony in the morning.  That was the rub.  He’d wanted to see him again, maybe have breakfast, talk about some ridiculously interesting topic over coffee, laugh when Tony teased him, chase that feeling that bloomed in his chest when he teased Tony back and made
“Must the boy speak for you?” the King asked with a flat grimace.  “Have I not given you—“ he broke off and looked away, an flash of annoyance crossing his features before he masked it with a sardonic, practiced expression that twisted his lips and made his eyes empty.  “This is where you--
“You’re doing so good, Tony.  So good for me,” Helicarrier Steve whispered.  “Is this okay?  Is this what you wanted, Tony?  Am I—oh, jeez, that’s…yeah—am I doing it right? Are you sure this is okay?  Do you like it?  Is that good?” Below him, Tony’s eyes opened, then fluttered shut, and he moaned again, throat bobbing and working as that version of Steve rocked his hips, sending his cock deeper into Tony’s throat.
“I rather thought you would like it,” Steve replied, giving Tony an indulgent smile.  The dark blue outer robe had Tony’s crest sewn into the back by silken threads. Steve thought Cam’s mother was likely responsible for that.  His face was covered with a veil of long, golden metal strands woven together to remind one a bit of vines, Steve thought, which hung down the full length of his robe to sweep the edges of the floor.  A deep blood-red inner robe swirled out underneath as he walked. It was far too decadent for an outing, at least to Steve, but according to Cam, Tony had commissioned it in particular, and requested he wear it today.
“Oh,” Cam said, dropping his eyes.  “Okay.”  He paused and glanced over at the tub before looking back at Steve, biting his lip before continuing.  “I think, maybe…maybe it’ll be okay.   With the King, I mean.  I met Lord Stane. At the party. Just for a few minutes, but—I think—I think maybe the King isn’t really all that much like Lord Stane after all,” he added in a hushed voice.
“Director Carter!  I didn’t think you were going to be able to make it,” a tall, bald, tuxedo-clad man said, taking a cigar out of his mouth where he had been about to step out onto the stoop and light it.  “Always a pleasure.”
“And taught him well,” Steve interjected, his voice steady, but it held a warning in it if you knew him. The woman heard it, Tony noticed. “His skills saved me when I was attacked by a cave bear. I would have died if not for his care.”
“To Fathers of the Year,” Tony said, tipping his hand up in the air as if holding a glass.  “What a couple of assholes.”
“So good for me, Steve,” Tony told him, and Steve remembered. He hadn’t come.  He was good.  He was good for Tony.  Maybe Tony would let him.  Maybe not.  He wondered why it had mattered so much a moment ago.
, but he couldn't say it. He had the crazy idea that Steve heard it, though, which made no sense, of course, but he couldn't shake it, and Steve was watching him with this careful, soft look that, for a moment, seemed so lost that Tony had to restrain the impulse to—to do something, anything, to make that look go away.
“I know what you mean,” Steve replied.  “’Night guys.  See you soon,” Steve said, watching the two of them round the stairs and head down.  “You’re going to be getting Christmas cards from him addressed to Tony Stank for years. You know that, right?”
“Fine.  We’ll get you a putting green with bumpers on the sides because you’re a giant cheater who hates to lose, a slushie machine, a shake-weight, so you can, ah, work out on your own, if that’s what you kids are calling it these days, and a courtesy Schwinn.  You’d like it,” Tony quipped, making Steve laugh as much in startled amazement as anything else.
“Tony, can you take the helmet off?” Steve asked, sitting down on the edge of the tiny, sterile, unartistic and not-red bed. “I think you’ll feel better about the whole situation, if you do.”
“And give you the satisfaction?  Hardly.  Still, you do have a natural way about you.  I don’t know,” he laughed.  “Perhaps I’m just partial?  At any rate, Obie will no doubt feel it a wasted expenditure at a time when the realm can ill afford it.  It is difficult to fight a threat that you can’t even see.  I’m not saying it isn’t necessary,” Tony rushed out with a small, placating tip of his head.  “Merely that it will be a challenge to convince them.”
s as he played, or walked or worked the field, and the thought--secretive and almost familiar--was oddly comforting. He liked being up in the mountains.  His mother forbade it, of course, saying it was too dangerous, but he always felt safe, and better, in some ways, just being there, like maybe the air was good for him, at least, that was what his mother said about being outside so much once he finally stopped coughing and hacking every time he exerted himself.
“Huh.  Don’t remember reading anything about that, but we don’t get a lot of East Coast news out here,” Tony replied.
“Tony…that’s…I mean, that’s nice of you, but…I—I can’t possibly ask you to…what you are suggesting,” Steve said.  “I can’t.  I—it wouldn’t be right.  Lord Pierce—what did he even say?”
“Fine?  Fine?  It was amazing!” Tony practically shouted.  He wanted to do something crazy.  Spin around, slide down the stair rail, something, just to get some of the energy out of him, mark the moment somehow.  “You don’t even know what happened.”
“Yes.  Your heartrate is elevated.  Shall I suggest some deep breathing exercises?” Friday’s disembodied voice asked.
“That is the entire story, then?” Thor asked, forehead crinkling in confusion before he caught Captain Rhodes’ look. “No, no, that is a most exhilarating tale!” Thor insisted quickly, grinning broadly.  “The capture of an enemy’s honored symbol.  The insult of placing it on the ground at his feet.  Yes, I can see how this would regale many a feast.  Very well done, Sir James!”
“I'm literally still sitting in my car staring up at his building like I sparkle in the daytime,” Tony objected, tossing a hand up. “How is that getting ahead of myself?”
“It’s okay, it’s okay.  I’ve got you.  You’re fine.  You’re fine.  You’re gonna be fine,” Tony rambled, words on top of words tumbling out of him.  “Bruce!” Tony shouted, then immediately realized Bruce wasn’t up yet and probably couldn’t hear him through five Tower floors anyway.  He hit the emergency call button instead, then brought both of Steve’s hands together.  “You’re okay, Steve.  I’m here.  I’ve got you.”
It wasn’t going to be okay.  It wasn’t going to be okay at all.  He’d lost Steve the moment those weapons were used to kill the people in Steve’s unit.  He lost Steve as soon as Barnes’ lost an arm to something stamped with Tony’s name. It was just that he was only now getting the chance to realize it, like some telegram that arrives months after a calamity delivering terrible news of a grief that had already been there without anyone knowing it.  It was what he deserved, if he was honest with himself. How many people had died because of him? Could he really begrudge it if the universe wanted to dangle this with Steve in front of him only to yank it away? Seemed more than fair, really, given what everyone else he touched in this debacle had lost.   The soldiers in the convoy, the people in Gulmira, countless, faceless others.
Tony darted a glance up at Steve before letting his gaze fall back to Steve’s chest, tracing a line across it, then, very deliberately, picked up the sponge and scraped the rough edge of the sponge hard against Steve’s right nipple.  Steve’s body jerked, and he let out a hiss of air.  His cock, forgotten in his panic and the discussion of the city’s defenses, stirred to life between his legs again as Tony repeated the action against the other nipple.
“I, on the other hand, have technically been chasing after you since Bagram,” Tony pointed out, looking up at Steve from under his eyebrows.  “So, A for effort on my part. Never give up, all that,” he added with a low shrug.  “Didn’t expect to see you again after you blew me off in Bagram. In the not-fun way,” he teased, rolling his lips together as he watched a blush redden Steve’s cheeks. It really was a good look on him, Tony could easily admit. “But, you know, stars align, fate, kismet, destiny, all that.  Universe wants to give us a shot, why not go for it?”
Behind him, the unmistakable crunch of tires on gravel announced the arrival of dinner as a small, blue two-door with a scrape along the passenger’s side and a brightly lit sign proclaiming the obvious on top.
He finally got around to going through the rest of the items, which didn’t amount to much, though his mom had also sent along a some oils he was supposed to put places that he didn’t want to think about.  There were some photos, though, and a few of his old toys, which he knew had come from Jarvis, so he tucked those in a slim cardboard box under his bed.  His father sent proposed new contracts for something he wanted to sell SHIELD.  Tony roasted marshmallows over them out on the deck while he looked at the stars.
“How is an Air Force pilot different from a jet engine?” Steve asked when Tony sidled up next to him.
“Tony,” Steve said.  His voice sounded funny.  All tight and angry.  Crap. He was worried.  He was probably going to start ordering people around, Tony thought with a long, drawn-out sigh.  He blew a puff of air, intending to get the hair that had fallen in front of his eyes out of the way, but it didn’t work, so he determinedly did it again. Then again.  “Tony, are you okay?” Steve asked, gentler this time.
Behind him, Tony was quiet for a moment, then clucked his tongue disapprovingly a few times. “A crime against humanity.”
“Does it?” Tony murmured, barely audible over the spray of the shower.   “It would’ve made her happy.  I could’ve given her that.”
“I’ll kill them,” Steve said with a firm nod, brow drawing together before it slipped into a familiar smile.  “No?  Toss them off something?  Would you really miss that shelving unit you insisted we get that came in five hundred pieces? Come on,” he urged, nudging a shoulder gently into Tony, making him rock back on his heels.  “Good talking to?  Stern look? Strongly worded letter?”
The thing was, Brock had a lot of tells, if he really thought about it.  Sometimes, it was like he was so close to it, though, that he couldn’t see them or they got all messed up in his head, the way a Seurat blurred into a cascade of dots if you got right up next to it.  Somehow, he’d known, deep down, that Brock wasn’t going to keep their secret.  Maybe it made it easier this morning at the bank to walk away.  Maybe it had been the way Brock looked at the check back at their hotel room in Vegas.  The way his whole face lit up at the sight.  Or how it was Steve who always did something wrong, who always ended up apologizing.  For the clothes thing, for wanting something different in the bedroom, for a lot of things that Steve was pretty sure weren’t the kinds of things most people in a relationship apologized for.
“I don’t like him doing that stuff,” Barnes said finally.  Tony thought again about what exactly was meant by a misunderstanding about the nature of Steve’s services, but he didn’t press it.
“Make some of those graphs.  They like the graphs.  Hand to God, that guy with the comb-over jerks off to pie charts,” Tony replied.
“Don’t help,” Steve said to Coulson with a sigh and slight roll of his eyes.  Tony grinned wickedly and shot a thumbs up in Coulson’s direction.  “Ready?” Steve asked Tony.  Tony nodded, and they made their way towards the elevators.
“Not anymore, Obie.  I can’t.  Not anymore.  I’m sorry.  I really am.  But, if you can’t support this, I understand, but…I’ll have to ask you to step down,” Tony said, leaning forward on the sofa so his elbows were braced on his legs.
“Hey,” Steve said by way of greeting as Cam stretched spindly arms above his head and rolled over.  “Food’s here.”
Once, Steve had wanted him to stay.  Tony was fairly sure that Steve didn’t want him to leave, even now, not really, and that was so close to wanting him to stay.  So very close. Give it time, he told himself sternly.  Woo.  Lots of woo.  He could woo.  For some reason, he heard laughter in his head that sounded a lot like Rhodey’s.
“We tried just shutting it off, and he nearly went into cardiac arrest. There are fail-safes built into the BARF system to avoid just that,
He wondered what Bucky—the real Bucky, not the one who sometimes echoed thoughts Steve didn’t want to voice—would say about all of this. He would probably ask what in the world Steve was still doing here.
It sounded too simple when he said it out loud.  A simple failing. Common. Trite, even. For something like this, there should be some sort of grand explanation.  A great conspiracy, some profound misstep, something beyond the mundane, but there it was. That was it. He had trusted Obie.  He had believed him, even in the face of things that should have made him question what was going on, and he had let himself be distracted whenever it got too close to something he couldn’t ignore.  In hindsight, he could see how easily Obie’s scheme had worked. Too easily. It was embarrassing, really, just how easily Obie had been able to manipulate him. It probably said something about him.   About how weak he was. That it had been so damn easy.
“You want to hear about my childhood?” Steve asked, brow furrowing a bit as he looked between the painting and Tony.
Tony looked at Steve, then dropped his eyes, watching the motes dance in the car headlights, round and round, tripping over air currents that he couldn’t even feel.
be done tomorrow.  I won’t last, Steve. Every part of me demands that I drive you to that bed and take you in all the ways I want to make you mine. It consumes me, the thought of it. I won’t be able to resist much longer. Neither will you.”
“Totally meant to do that.  And sure we can,” Tony insisted.  “It’s my foundation.  Well, mom’s, anyway.  My party.  Pretty sure I can decide for myself when to come and go.”
“What?” Steve asked, the words not making sense for a moment.  Then he remembered. One kiss. One kiss, and Tony would help him get the plans.
“That’s not going to be enough,”  Bruce said. “Someone take this,” Bruce ordered, handing off the compression bag to Natasha as he threaded the needle into the vein in Steve’s arm.  “Who’s got O neg?” he asked, looking around.  “Tony, you’re the only O-neg, right?”
“Don’t.  Just don’t go.  Steve…”  Bucky’s face was a mask of pain now, and Steve knew his own must look the same because it hurt.  It hurt because Bucky was right.  He knew it.  He didn’t want to face it right now though, wanted this fantasy to hang onto a little longer.  The illusion of it was better than the alternative.   Why did Bucky insist on pulling aside the curtain?  Why couldn’t he have this, just for a little while?
“Oh,” Steve replied stiffly, unsure how to take the man’s words or if he even heard the man correctly.  The stranger had a formal way of talking, low and melodic, that Steve liked, but it made it harder to quite catch what the man was saying.
