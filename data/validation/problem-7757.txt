anything; I expect it simply gave me an illusion of control over the situation. And he... for him I don't think it was that. He was ever convinced we were basically the same people as our counterparts in other timelines. Did we talk once during those five years or every day? He thought it affected our relationship, sure, but not the essence of who we were as people. And, put like that, I couldn't even disagree fully. I think he was basically fascinated with the whole concept, though, and keenly curios to hear my story just because it was mine. I suppose his motives were purer than mine in that respect.
history there.
"You don't have to do it," Tony said quickly. "I mean, Morgan begged, and so I promised I'd ask you, because I can't say no to her, which is – I realize – not the best parenting choice, but right now I'm going with it. So, I had to ask, but listen, Cap, if you could just show up – for twenty minutes in the afternoon, I mean, you don't have to stay long, I don't want to keep you from your plans – and if you could have a chat with her... You don't have to dress up. She would be over the moon either way. And I'll..." He'd gotten so carried away that he was about to try and bribe Steve which was... ridiculous and offensive. Well. Not really bribe. To, say, Rhodey he would have said
Tony: Why am I telling you this?
The serum slows aging. That's one of its effects, it turns out. I wasn't about to stay and watch all our friends die off one by one. I went back to my original timeline instead, to give my shield and my legacy over to Sam, and to see them all young once more. You could argue they are not the same people I spent the last 40 years with. Four decades ago, I would have agreed – but, you see, that Steve was a different guy. He was me, but I'm really not him any more. And that – that is the whole point. Is me from a different timeline still me? No more or less than me from the past or me from the future. They say all cells in our bodies are replaced every seven years. Tony and Bruce always laughed at that one, but it sounds neat. In any case, our opinions fluctuate even more often than that. There is no strict definition of what constitutes 'me'; I'm the one who defines who I am. I went back to my original timeline, in order to see Sam and Bucky, Wanda and Clint, Scott and Bruce and Rhodey, and the others. I saw them, and it was them, bright eyed and young and going strong. I sat on the edge of the lake for a time and imagined a hundred different timelines in which he still lived and breathed and was being a dick to me, possibly. It gave me – well, not precisely hope, because I didn't know what I would hope for any more, but it did give me a certain kind of comfort. This is not a completely Tony-less universe. Many people who are him are still out there, and if I could send them all my love, I would. And yet, I missed him so harshly I thought it was going to turn me inside-out. I missed both of him, Tony who had been Pepper's and Tony who had been mine. Wherever he is, I'm his.
Tony: Is this your weird way of saying: Stark, you need to get help?
"I could have lost you," he stated quietly. "
, you know
wanted in turn: get to know him, it said. This is not your Tony, and if you want to have an honest relationship, romantic or platonic, with
Steve’s words had been growing more and more passionate, and Tony couldn’t deny it felt good, hearing them, nestled like he was in Steve’s arms. It was like a wet dream.
During those months, ever so slowly, I was tumbling headfirst in love with Tony,
"No one looks twice at couples." Steve tries to look unapologetic, but kind of fails. "I learned that trick from Nat," he adds, a slight flush blooming in his cheeks.
Yep, shoulda opened with that one. Oh well, now."
"I wanted to be there for you, I swear," Steve went on. "But I didn't think you needed me. I thought... I didn't know what you wanted from me."
On the other side, Steve seemed to jump into his practical mode at once. "Can you stand back? I'm going to try and kick my way through."
Tony: went into hiding with your murderous asshole of a friend
wants out.
Tony: Okay. I'll try.
Tony: And where'd you get my diagnoses?
Then he heard it again in his mind:
Steve was watching in mild fascination, as what was supposed to be an answer to a very simple question somehow slowly turned into a lecture on the basic principles of aeronautics. Just a few sentences, but Stark wasn't addressing him at all. He was talking to the room at large. Almost as if it was a practiced performance. It wasn't about what info he was conveying, it was the way he was doing it. Steve found himself wanting to listen to this man recount all the things Steve already knew.
"Chopper and parachute," Steve interjected.
he wants to say, but somehow that doesn't seem like enough.
Well, that was debunked now, wasn't it? Steve had rushed into the fire, alone, in a crappy suit, and done away with most of the aforementioned crisis. For fuck's sake. How was Tony supposed to deal with that? How was he supposed not to fall in love with someone idiotic like that?
"Yes."
Tony had indeed told Steve about all of this – once, when he was very drunk – and even though Steve believed him,
, he reminds himself.
"You do know I'll have to carry you, don't you?" Steve said, still sounding needlessly worried. And yes, carrying made sense, no matter how undignified it was, because if they waited for Tony to limp his way out of here, they could as well set up house.
Which set off Tony’s alarms again, all at the same time, and he knew it was stupid, but he didn’t know what to do about it. Because a whole day here, in this tiny space, cooped up with Steve – well, it would make talking unavoidable, and Tony couldn’t, his gut hurt at the thought and he
Was that a faint trace of hurt in his voice or was Tony imagining it? And Tony knew he wasn't being fair. Steve had been nothing if not, well, sweet to him this whole time. Perhaps that was what all the sadness after the snap did to Steve – made him less full of expectations, less uptight about it, and thus gentler. Tony himself had changed too. They all had. Or maybe Steve had always been like this; maybe it was just Tony that saw him with different eyes now. In any case, it was unfair to keep having these unfinished arguments with the old Steve in his head.
Steve gestured vaguely about them, at the room in general. "Just curious."
Tony: When you're not saying anything.
Barely perceptibly, Rhodey shook his head: "Tones..." And then, in a changed voice: "Will you ever tire from going down the list of Australian animals...?"
"This must be a grav field malfunction, right?" Steve asked. Of course Steve had figured it out; he was smart. Tony had listened to his lectures. He was an intelligent guy, and he knew his science too.
And right enough, Steve hesitated, his lips going a little flat. And right enough, he gave Tony a rueful little smile. "I don't have a phone."
Tony gave an amalgam of a nod and a shrug. Either it was nonchalance incarnate or he looked like he was having a fit. No way to know, really. He very much wasn't staring at Steve's bare chest.
They filed into the elevator, and it got moving. Tony couldn't stop thinking about Steve's face as he switched into full action mode, just before he put his helmet on. How his stance changed, how every sign of reluctance or shyness vanished in a flash, how his eyes brightened and his voice got that crisp quality as he gave the orders. Tony wasn't supposed to find that so thrilling, was he? He did his best to push the feeling away.
"We can keep them – or burn them, if you want. You decide, I mean. But do you want to look at the drawings?" That was somehow different. The drawings were also intimate, perhaps as intimate as the writings, but they were drawings of Tony and, I thought, intended
Don't think about it, just...
"Do you want me to let go of you?" Steve whispered against Tony's lips.
That bewildered tone of voice again. It sounded exactly the way Tony felt. This was awkward to the max.
"Okay," he said, reluctantly. He
On the second day, Tony caught him looking. It shouldn't have been weird – Tony was in front of the class,
, and it would
be a mortal wound. And then Thanos reaches out to touch Tony with his ugly big hand, and Steve is able to move again. All of his desperation and pain and stubborn refusal to give in come together, congeal into that one moment. Steve is between them, now, and he's pushing back,
Tony: You are not going to like this.
. One of them manages to make even a Hawaiian shirt look threatening.
Tomorrow morning, Tony wakes up with a killer headache and congealed eyes. He also wakes up alone. He should be relieved – it's best this way, really; still, he isn't sure if the black pit opening in his stomach is due to the hangover or to his empty bed.
"I wanted to see if he's okay, at least," Tony said quietly.
to which Rhodey would have rolled his eyes and said
I know nothing about either skiing or surfing. I did do some research, but there are probably mistakes or weird references there.
"I don't have PTSD," Steve said. "I just..."
," Tony replied with a quite ridiculous hint of indignation in his voice.
with that. Do things right this time around.
"Form that party," I said, as if it'd been a normal party, as if nothing happened at that party apart from a few drunken shenanigans.
He wriggled out of Steve’s embrace, just a bit, so that he could look him in the face, see him nod once. The fragile, raw fondness there.
Tony's stomach clenched. Nothing, of course – or not the same thing Tony wanted from
Tony shrugged. "Unlike you, they never get old."
Steve shrugs. "It's fine. It's..." He doesn't finish, just waves his hand downwards, vaguely.
The very fact that he is naked and Tony isn't sends a tiny, pleasant thrill through Steve. This is what he dreamed of. A competent, sharp-spoken, no-nonsense Tony playing around with Steve's body. He'd never thought he'd get here, never thought Tony would be interested at all. But here he is, flogger in hand, running the pommel of the handle up and down Steve's torso, teasing, exploring, inspecting. He trails it softly down Steve's spine, pausing and circling lightly at the very top of the crack of Steve's ass, just enough to stir up the sensation. As soon as Steve gasps, he moves on. He runs it up his ribs, circles both his nipples. That feels amazing and Steve immediately wants more, but Tony just smirks at him and moves on once again. He's waking Steve's body up with light touches but purposefully leaving him aching for more.
And then – impossibly – there's the harder pressure again, against his sweet spot, the soft circles being rubbed into the prostate wall just where the piquant promises turn into the red heat, but
"You're still addled, aren't you?" he said. "Can you tell me what you know. What do you remember?"
"Shall we start where we left off yesterday?"
"Cap..." Tony said, wondering frantically how he could have momentarily forgotten that Steve had said 'drugs' and 'serum suppressant' of all things.
All right, let's be honest. No matter which one of them called, no matter when or why, all Steve would be able to say would be:
Tony: Yeah, but I hate to spoil the decent washed-out mood.
Steve flinched, caught unprepared. He'd been trying to figure Tony out so hard that he'd forgotten he was supposed to lie low and not draw any attention to himself. For a moment he had no idea what to say. He was drawing a blank, and he felt his muscles contract in response, readying for a fight. He relaxed them with an effort. Because he didn't really think Tony was after him, and if he
of this. Brush himself off and somehow – somehow – get on with his life.
Inside the pocket
, he asked, and if Tony said no, Steve would let go and that would be that.
Tony: Probably.
Tony: you? nah
"Diverging timelines?" It's not even a real question. He's figured it out at once, he was just too shocked to say anything.
Steve’s eyes popped open, and something in Tony’s chest opened up in turn.
Steve's voice was level. "I noticed."
There was a trickle of chilliness in Tony's voice (someone who didn't know him, might not have noticed). He sounded deceptively offhanded. "You having regrets, big guy?"
Tony slumps on the bed. "Okay, you've proved your point. I'm sorry. Even if I hadn't been earlier, I'd be
Tony: Well, shit.
Tony shook his head. "He must have done them from memory."
'Do you think we can be happy?" he asks.
Tony: I'm not having a jokey convo with you.
. Of course, looking back now, it was easy to be smart and insightful and full of self-irony. The hurt still burned hot in Tony's heart. Because – and he knew this was probably unfair, but he didn't give a flying fuck – he had had this idea firmly entombed in his head, this image of Cap as a perfect friend, an immovable rock of goodness, someone who could never fail you (judge you, yeah, but you somehow got the impression he had the right to). Someone who could be obstinate and rigorous, perhaps, but wouldn't let you down.
Their captors had let Steve keep his boots, and they seemed unconcerned by him still having his suit on. His cowl was gone, however, and so were his gloves. The touch of his fingers on Tony's ankle was feather-light. Gently, he pulled the sock off, then proceeded to prod and examine the ankle itself, the swelling that had sunk lower and the roof of the foot, as he asked a few generic questions. Of course he had no way of knowing if it was sprained or fractured or
Tony: No you aren't
Tony: I probably shouldn’t have said that? I’m just kidding around, you know that, right?
Santa Cap."
Tony: can't go wrong with that
"Got some of that mead on you?" he asked.
"Hey, Cap. Nothing’s wrong," Tony hurried to assure him. "It’s just..." He was hearing his own voice, he really was. It sounded positively vibrant with excitement. There was absolutely nothing he could do about it either. Actually hearing Steve's voice after all this time, actually being on the phone with him – it gave him such a rush that all he could do was let go and be carried with it. It didn't feel as wrong as a part of him thought it should. "I wanted to tell you that Peter's okay. I just saw him. He's fine."
“Can we... not fight about this, Tony?” Steve echoed his thoughts, deliberately keeping his voice down. The man reconsidered for a moment, took a deep breath, tried for a smile without too much success. “Look, let’s stay here, I’ll keep you company if you want, we could – all right, you hate cards, but we could do
"My beard? Oh, you don't like it? It's just..."
Tony: And don't worry.
? With me too? Or maybe just me? See where it goes? Instead, his throat suddenly went dry, and what came out was: "I saw you with Peter..." He heard how that sounded, stopped.
Tony: Goddammit, Rogers!
Tony: I fucking asked if it was helping because I wanted to know if being busy is helping because I'm fucking TRYING TO HELP, although I sometimes really, really want to deck you for being an insufferable idiot.
– he felt uncharacteristically incapable of saying more.
the table), he's despairing at Steve's despair, and he's falling apart too.
Tony: Well, you asked.
Tony: I really had best intentions, coming there.
“My cock,” he whispered hoarsely, and Steve obliged, reached down and took hold of him. Squeezed lightly. Just held him in his palm. And the jerky motions of him fucking in and out provided enough of almost painful friction of skin on skin. Once, twice, and then Tony was riding the current. He thought he moaned loudly, but he couldn’t be sure. And Steve still held his cock, massaging it lightly even thought it was
SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE: Why ever not? [laughter]
Breezily, charmingly careless, Tony knew the drill: "My people will call your people, all right?"
Seeing him in person. Like being hit by a very warm, very soft truck. The tired eyes, the suppressed smile and a whole bunch of sheer presence that tended to outglow anything else around it, as far as Tony was concerned. He would have stopped and fought for breath, at least a little bit, at least for the dramatic effect, but hell, who cared about breath anyway. They just stood and looked at each other for a moment. Within touching distance, in a small, sheltered bubble of space-time that was effectively saying: screw you, multiverse. At the moment, we don't care. At the moment, you don't exist.
," she added noncommittally. "I'm just asking for your opinion."
Tony: Scott Lang and Happy Hogan?
There was something nervous about the way Rhodey beamed at Carol. "There you are," he said. She reached up to touch his shoulder, just briefly, but for her that was plenty demonstrative. "And you," Rhodey added, turning to Tony.
Or, well, for those other reasons too, perhaps.
"Do you really have to go to the West Coast?" He says it without thinking.
Tony: I actually thought you kind of liked her. So this comes as a surprise.
They walked out of the gym after that, side by side, and there wasn't much to say. Steve didn't know why he was feeling lighter, since nothing was actually resolved, but he was, and for now that would do.
, you know.
Tony breathed for a minute. I thought he was bracing himself to say something important, but what eventually came out was, "I think I saw a coffee machine in one of the boxes. Wanna come hook it up?"
The phone started ringing more insistently if that was possible.
Tony: No, that's... exactly what I needed to hear right now, actually, and thank you.
"But you do think I'm hot, don't you?" he heard himself say, and then, since it was out already, he just plunged on. What other choice did he have now? "Just tell me that one thing. Just admit it."
don't. And they may not agree with mine. God knows, you all saw choice cuts of our disagreements on TV. But these guys are not... they do not deserve to be vilified like this. Crucified like this. We all did wrong. And I think it's, I believe with all my heart it's your right to ask questions, and all of us, we should always question authority, and we should, we should take responsibility, yes. But we should also keep all the facts in mind. These guys are not villains, and you know it, or you should. Some of them are your own veterans. Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson. Decorated war heroes. Sam was pararescue, for God's sake, saving people was his day job even before he joined the Avengers! You know who they are, you
"True. We never did."
"We first got our asses handed to us when we let ourselves be divided," Steve said. "If we hadn't, that would have made all the difference."

could act kindly and patiently when there wasn't a crisis at hand. Tony'd never seen him in action before. Before, he kept telling himself that the feelings that were hatching inside him weren't rooted in reality.
Tony: As for me saying I regret not killing you, that night –  shit, Steve, I'm so sorry. You know I don't mean it, you know I mean the polar opposite of that. It's just another form of self-destruction I think. Because you know my worst fear, you know it. You know what it is.
"Sure you are."
"I didn't know how to game the sensors," Steve said.
Tony knew that. It didn’t always help, but he knew. “Yeah, neither did I. We’ve been through this already.” He made a conscious effort to make his voice gentler. “I
"Because, honestly, he's crazy about you," Peter continued. "You know that, right?'
Tony: Well, that's good, isn't it?
Tony came to in a pile of warmth. He knew he’d been asleep, but it took him a moment to remember where he was, and
Tony: You and your cutesy emoticons, ffs.
He started carving the meat instead. It was a small roast, but in addition to everything else, it made the amount of food really ridiculous. And then there were the sweets, too. He looked at Steve as he was passing him the plate; Steve was looking at all the food as well.
"What?"
It was weird, Tony reflected; he regarded this glade almost as his own brainchild. He had discovered it, true, when he was twelve; like hundreds before him, probably. But, as he wound between the branches heavy with snow, he couldn’t help but marvel at how there was no one around, ever, to revel in this quiet, brilliant beauty. Here, the water was present in three different states of matter at the same time – ice beneath his feet, the heavy, wet smell of snow and pine in the air around him, and the slow drip-drip-drip that shouldn’t be audible in the mountains, not this time of year, but on a southwardly exposed slope, at noon – it was. Three states of matter, three worlds meeting where they shouldn’t, like something out of a Norse myth. Each individual drop seemed to reflect a different ray of sunlight in a haphazard direction on its way down. If those had been lasers, not even Natasha could have snaked her way through them.
Tony: I mean, it's depressing as all hell, but it's really good.
It was getting so unduly cozy, actually, that Tony felt a pang of dread.
Still, that was trivial, I told myself sternly. How could I worry about nicknames when Tony was in obvious distress. Gently, I took both his hands in mine. He let me, or, more precisely, he didn't resist. "Tony," I said in my best steady voice and squeezed his hands softly. "Tony are you
He was going to throw it out there, offhandedly, nodding towards the char marks on Steve's suit. He choked on the words. They just wouldn't come out.
"Let me see that," Tony said briskly, half-pushing Steve out of the way to get to the elevator control panel.
. What the hell are you supposed to say to a chancellor, anyway?
Tony: That was scathing sarcasm, btw.
Tony: I can practically HEAR how worried you are all of a sudden. So spill.

"And now I feel like reading

This, however, called for

"Like, intracardiac injection?" Tony's throat had gone dryer than he'd thought.
Tony: And I SHOULD have known. It's MY fucking brain.
"Yeah," he said, patting my arm earnestly and a bit awkwardly. "Yeah, it does. It makes a lot of sense."
"That... wasn't me, exactly," I said, and I'm afraid I sounded more distant than I meant to. I had no idea what happened here. The disbelief in Tony's voice when he said
, Tony thought.
. He becomes aware of Tony's left hand, then – the one that was pressed into the underside of Steve's right knee, pressing it into Steve's chest harshly. Tony lets go of the leg now and lets his whole palm ghost over Steve's cock, lighter than a fly fluttering against glass. It's so light that Steve wouldn't even feel it if he wasn't so sensitive, so highly tuned to every point of contact. And as Steve's cock twitches up to meet the palm, Tony snatches it up, so that Steve has to buck up and manages only to brush it with the tip of his cock, just for the second, which makes the burning even worse. Which is probably what Tony aimed for in the first place. His hips falling back to bed, Steve manages to shift the angle on Tony's finger, and it lands deceptively close to his sweet spot. It's more intense than ever now, he's so turned on, so high pitched, so close to the unreachable peak. Tony lets him have it for a second, two, even twists his finger for a moment so that Steve feels the friction, the pressure against his prostate, everything; but in seconds it's gone, and there's just stretch and burn, and the unfulfilled need in his cock. He's so frustrated that he yells, and Tony laughs his mechanical laugh.
Tony: To confirm this theory, just don't say anything.
"This is completely unnecessary, Tony," he says seriously, but, with some reluctance, goes with the option number two. Holding his hand and smirking like a fiend, Tony practically skips through the airport. He imagines he can hear Steve simmering in the background.
" They should be past lying, by now, with everything that they went through. Whatever they said to each other turned weird and awkward anyway; he might as well go with the truth.
Tony takes the ribbon from his pocket, then, and ties his hands. Steve glances at the piece of silk in amusement. "You don't have to be
Tony opened his mouth to say something, but Steve cut in. "I never wanted to hurt you, Tony. That was the last thing I wanted. I..."
We hang out. Natasha finds an excuse to leave us alone more often than not. I've asked her not to do that – I love Natasha and I don't want her to feel like she's being pushed out – but she keeps pretending she has no idea what I'm talking about. Honestly, it's infuriating, in a very, very Natasha-like way that I've deeply missed over the years.
Tony thinks. Honestly, he was just about toying with the idea. Now he's decided to stay, if only to prove Steve wrong.
"So, what do you do now?" Tony asked Fury, never moving his knee away from Steve's under the table, and for a millionth time Steve wondered if this was all a joke to Tony, a way to push Steve's buttons. He... hoped not.
Out of breath, he found the landing bay in a far better state than he expected. The smoke was fully cleared by now. Tony didn't know what it had been like, really, but he’d, pictured an impenetrable cloud, a wall, a sea of smoke. Medics were already there, he saw, and the marines. Everything seemed well organized.
Tony: Not the time
Tony didn't know if Steve had pulled him towards him or if he himself had leaned forward, but the next thing he knew, Steve's lips were on his, hot and sweet, and it was as if something warm and fresh coursed through his whole body, thawing, cleansing. He was still holding both of Steve's hands in his. Now Steve shifted the grip, interlaced their fingers. He pulled Tony closer, and Tony let himself be enticed for a moment longer, and another moment after that, letting his body mold itself against Steve's. And then, with a final, regretful pressing of lips against lips, he pulled back. It required a greatest effort of will. "Not a good idea," he whispered, but still he couldn't make himself let go of Steve's hands. Gently, Steve pulled Tony toward him again, more signaling than actually trying to move him. Tony's heart didn't need much convincing. He melted against Steve again, aware, savoring every second. "Okay," he whispered, "just one more time." And then they kissed again, longer this time, bolder.
." Tony half expected her to shoo him away as well, but she seemed to have accepted him and Steve as a package deal, somehow.
Tony raised his eyes and glared at Steve. "Oh, how great, you think it's
When Steve walked into the room, a tray with tea and salty biscuits in one hand, Tony was in bed, still in his bathrobe. Light and shadows from the fire chased one another around the furniture; the brightness from the StarkPad Tony was working on fell upon his face like a spot of moonlight. The mildly feverish look made him appear more lively somehow; it suited him well. It wasn't at all fair, really.
The muttering turned into "Yeah?"
say something like that, you know."
"Any questions?" Captain Rogers asked at the end of  his short speech.
On the 1
At 1 p.m. he was staring at the skies, drumming his fingers against his thigh, wondering shouldn't it start letting up by now.
people!"
it, Cap, never fear." The bitterness seemed to be directed entirely at himself, as far as I could tell. But
Tony: Not unlike everything fucking else in life, eh?
"I wish you failed," Steve says, and his smile is small and sad. What did Tony expect? Romantic music on cue? An impromptu proposal? What? They've both messed up too much, and Tony's final screw-up was the glorious culmination of it all, and it's too late for them... Just look at the downcast look in Steve's eyes. Even though he can't seem to look away from Tony's face. Even though...
"Hey, Nat."
, and that was awesome. He just sighed happily, snuggled next to Steve, even though it
He sank into the piloting chair an let out a long sigh. This was really getting absurd. He needed to calm down. That night he'd reached certain conclusions. This was just a practical confirmation. Rogers was ignoring him – teaching him, sure, but still ignoring him as much as possible.
"Are they still together?"
"See, that's good," Tony said, "that's just what I want to hear."
Tony: That we didn't finish the last match.
Tony: Maybe I should just give in, go get coffee and power through.
"So," Steve says, in a surprisingly calm voice, and it's really not fair that he can do that. "You seemed pretty into it, back there." And what's even less fair is putting all this on Tony, because Steve wasn't much better himself, either.
," he snapped again, impatient. Then he apparently bit his tongue, shooting me an apologetic look.
After that one, the drawings got less frequent, and what there was, was done mostly from memory. The lines got vaguer, more general. Tony had left The Avengers.
"You think I'm spoiling her rotten," Tony said quietly. "Don't you?"
Tony is off him in an instant, and with a coldness in his gut Steve wonders if he's just going to walk out – just leave him like this and go. But Tony is just reaching for the lube Steve had left on the bedside table.
"It's Carter, actually." Steve's voice was bright and calm and careless. It had a sharp edge that was new and, for Tony, nearly gut-wrenching.
's so great!" Peter said without much preamble. "Kamala, have you seen it? It's this
Tony: I'm running out of mean responses to that and all I'm coming up with is a boring 'hit me'.
"The wrong blonde, eh?" Thor said thoughtfully instead of replying. "And where
Tony tried to grin. In the darkness of the room, it looked almost ghastly. His eyes were big and round and shiny, as if he were about to cry.
The simulator was forgotten. Tony moved a nanometer forward. Then another. Were seconds passing at all? Minutes? Or did they enter some kind of a weird time loop? Were they moving toward each other at all? Would the parallel lines ever cross, somewhere far ahead, in the planes of infinity?
And Rogers was gorgeous, in that perfect, distant way that made you want to make a pass at him, not because you expected it to lead to anything but because you wanted to see a reaction.
Thor gave him a sharp look. "Bruce," Tony mouthed at him, and Thor inclined his head and
Tony froze for a heartbeat, then frowned; then he went on energetically opening the cans and cracker boxes.
"Are you going to try and arrest me?" The question was like a stone.
Steve snorted in a most infuriating way. "That's not exactly how I'd put it, although I'd say there was some beating taking place there, yes."
Tony: You keep ignoring or deflecting my questions.
An icy pit opened in Tony’s stomach. Too fast, then, too close, too intimate, too...what?
But after he got back from Siberia, Pepper was there for him. They got close again, but they weren't together.
“Did you memorize the actual words?” Tony said in wonder.
"Have you seen Tony?"
This conversation was like cutting myself open and showing all the bloody bits to Tony. All the things that hurt. Wasn't there supposed to be relief? All I had was grief and more grief. Maybe the relief would come later.

kept ringing in his ears during Stark's lecture e made himself sit through. And he couldn't but notice how Stark's voice kept breaking with strain towards the end.
"I'm not sure that we are friends, exactly" he says, and he is instantly sorry, but perhaps these are days for the truth.
actually know all their names, don't you?"
Tony: I want to have normal convos again?
Tony: Fuck, Cap, I can't believe this is happening.
And how in the name of hell did he pick that up now, with all the affection and desire and all the good things flowing back and forth between them? Oh well. Tony shrugged. "Guess I'm going to be a bit better now, though." And he noticed he was smiling.
Tony: probably
idea.
He tries for a casual tone. "Yeah, well. You're good looking. I'm into hot people. You knew that." With all he's been considering and remembering today, with all the gratuitous touching, and the sheer terror he felt when he thought Steve was going to get hurt, and, in the end, with the way the
Captain pushed back his chair, got up; settled his hip against the side of the desk in an unexpectedly homely manner. In Tony's eyes he both was and wasn't the same person as last night: both chiseled from a stone block and pretty in a sweet, rosy-cheeked manner that should be punishable by law. His arms crossed, he looked at Tony, down and askance. Tony let his eyes wander upwards without moving his head.
Right about that time, a new problem presented itself. It was a creeping awareness that he was lying there, entwined in a most intimate cuddle-puddle with Steve Rogers. Back when he was undressing him, all he could think was how discolored Steve's skin looked, and how limp his body was; and Tony was shit-scared. But now that Steve's limbs had started feeling warm and alive next to Tony's, with his face only inches away from Tony's, there was a certain...physicality, that now arose and colored the situation. Once Tony started thinking about it, it became impossible to ignore. Tony immediately felt like a creep, and tried to turn his mind to other things.
He gestured at his swollen nose and his runny eyes. "Well, as you can see, I can't," he snapped.
"It's a fine party," he managed. He knew he sounded stiff and cold.
But Tony sighs a little sigh, and at first, naively, Steve thinks it's relief.
Tony: I don't like what medication does to me, at least the little I've tried. I know it does wonders for some people, but it just makes me sick and kinda addles me and fogs my mind. Also, my sexual drive goes to hell.

He oozes out of bed and grabs a bottle of water. Either
my Tonys, and I love him, just like I suspect I would eventually fall in love with every Tony across the wide multiverse.
"Drink?
Steve did.

Tony couldn't look away from the door. "You know what, it really is."  He still had Steve's art in his office. He'd tried putting it away, after he'd returned to the Compound, and then he took it out again. Pepper thought he was using it to punish himself, but that wasn't it. Putting it away didn't make it any less
Tony: Google her, dammit.
The Red Line, the borders of the known space. Once you ended up on the other side, your chances of finding a way back home were next to nonexistent. And this is where they were now.
"What about you?" Steve's voice didn't sound drowsy at all. So. He'd been lying there awake, listening to Tony muttering to himself. Oh, how hilarious. Talking to himself wasn't exactly a new habit, but since he'd been down here, he'd reached a new low.
"Wait a sec," Steve told him. He thought he heard a frustrated snort.
something. But before he could say anything more, Tony slammed him against the wall, and then his lips were on Steve's, hot, taking, not at all gentle. The man appeared so
"The grav strips gave out, we think," Hope said briskly. "The flyers crashed down, we all crashed down. The fires started. I'm with the fire control team – we can handle it, probably, and in any case there are no more fire extinguishers that are not in use. Darryl's over there, supervising the urgent rescue operations. The maintenance people that were working on the vipers are trapped under the flyers, we think. They need to be got out of here before they suffocate. That team over there could use some help. Are you alone? Does this mean the corridor is cleared? The access was really tricky from this side, we didn't have time to get on that, we..." She took a deep breath, seemed to check herself. "We need to get someone to the side engines. We couldn't get to them from this side, and we had to suppress the fires to some extent before we could get more people on that task."
Sam put a hand to his forehead and rubbed his temples. “Christ, you two are stupid,” he murmured incredulously.
Steve’s brow furrowed.  Tony’s favorite lines put in their appearance.  He wanted to kiss them so badly.  “Say something,” Steve said.  “Something only Tony knows.”
A soft, flickering glow spilled from the open door of Tony’s bedroom into the hallway like a beacon lighting his way home, and Steve followed it. Tony lay on the bed, asleep. His glasses were still on, his head cocked to one side. The television was on, but turned down low. The tablet he sometimes worked on from home lay beside his outstretched fingers. He was wearing one of Steve’s t-shirts. He liked to do that. Not only was he a blanket-thief, but a clothing-thief too. Steve didn’t mind. In fact, he always felt a little prod of
Some unknown time later, a golden crack appeared in the air.
Now Steve touched him. He put his hand on Tony’s hip, right where it had rested before
“I love you, too.”
“Should I call Mr. Stark?”
Steve took Tony’s hand again and squeezed it, then turned his face toward Wanda and Strange.  “What do I do?” he asked.  In word and deed, Steve handed himself over to them.  The simple trust he put into them all took Tony’s breath away.  Only Rhodey had ever trusted him so much.
Steve sighed, and for the first time in his life, he felt a sliver of sharp, clean hate slip into his heart. He never would have believed it. Never would have believed it possible. But there it was. Hatred. Hatred for one Howard Stark.
“I don’t want to wait.”
Steve nodded.  “Okay.  I’m just gonna close my eyes for a minute.  If that’s okay?”
Steve opened his mouth to tell him he was fine again, but then closed it. He wasn’t really fine. He’d had a bad night. Long. Plagued with nightmares. Hearing Bucky screaming on the ground, seeing poor Jonathon’s ruined body on the roadside. He had shaken it off throughout the day, and he hadn’t needed a drink that badly, but he couldn’t resist the comfort of a cigarette, and had bummed two off the dishwasher at the diner. He had smoked them in the alley outside, leaning against the brick. It was only when Tony called and he heard his voice, that he finally felt better. Easier in his brain somehow.
Tony and Jeff both looked at him.  “I bowled a 130, Steve,” Tony said.  “In case you didn’t notice, that fucking sucks.”
Steve sat up and kissed his neck, burying his face into him, kissing him, licking him, biting him while Tony set a slow, sensual rhythm. He couldn’t remember the last time he had felt this way. The last time he had just...just
Tony, though…
Steve held the pennant in his hands now, smiling a little.  It was a good memory.  They were all good memories--movie nights, rooftop paintball (but only when Clint wasn’t around.  They didn’t call him “Hawkeye” for nothing.), late night tea with Bruce, and every second of every day that he spent with Tony.  Looking back now, even the worst days with Tony had been so very good.
“Maybe you’re right,” Steve said.  “Maybe I should have called you.”
“Uncle Pennybags.”
Bucky shot him a withering glance. “Babe was the greatest left-handed pitcher ever,” he pressed, raising a scholarly finger. “Did Willie Mays ever pitch a game? ‘Cause I don’t think so.”
And he did.  He’d been in love with Tony Stark for so long he couldn’t remember what it felt like not to love him.  Even through the fights, the Accords, and everything that came after them, he’d still loved him.  But how did you say that to someone?  Especially someone like Tony who had been worshipped by people far better than simple Steve Rogers who wouldn’t back down from a fight, but never even went on a date that Bucky didn’t set up for him.  But Bucky couldn’t help him now.  He had to sink or swim on his own.
Steve let out another breath. Then nodded. “Right.”
I'm adding the next chapter tomorrow...It's a biggie.  Thanks again to everyone reading this!
Tony tried to look away from her, but he couldn’t.  She held him in thrall, and he could see how she thrived as an assassin for so long.  Not only was she deadly and beautiful, but she had a mystical quality that hung in a haze around her.  When she turned it on and focused it, she was irresistible.  No wonder Steve adored her.  No wonder Bruce was hers to command.  Tony wondered how he, himself, had been able to resist her all these years.
Tony nodded. “She’ll settle,” he said. “It’s just the excitement and the late night. She’s usually in bed by eight-thirty.” He gave her one more kiss, then straightened and slid his arms around Steve’s waist. He nuzzled into the crook of his neck. “She’ll be okay.”
“No, I’m not.  I think it’s the end of the line, Buck.”
“No, I don’t think so.  You just make him nervous.”
Someone dangerous.
, Tony told himself--but that rigid, worried line of his shoulders softened. His mouth softened too, and Tony wanted it on him. On his mouth. His chest. His wherever else Steve wanted to put it. He wasn't a picky man.
“It’s hard,” Tony said, then twisted the bread up again. This time, he opened the cupboard and shoved it inside. He closed the cupboard again with a little more force than necessary. “You know? ‘Cause she depends on me. On me and Pepper. For everything.” He ran a hand through his hair in a distracted way. “And I want her to. I want to give her everything. Everything that I never had.”
, his brain tried to whisper, and he shut it up quick.
“The National Guard isn’t the army.”
Steve considered. They were dancing closer now, Vis holding Wanda as though she were something special he needed to protect. “Let’s give them the night off.”
“Do you think so?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Things changed when the kid moved in next door.
slow. Slower than-” he ran a distracted hand through his hair, but his eyes never left Tony’s. They stayed put. Drinking him in, filling to the brim with him. “Slower than anything. Than everything.”
“I want you,” Tony said.  “I love you.  I think I’ve always loved you.  And it’s not easy.  It’s never been easy.  But I don’t want to change it.  I don’t want to change anything about it.  It makes me a better man.  And I am well aware of how sappy that sounds, so you’d better believe it.  My ego might be able to take one hit, but it definitely can’t take two.”
“So did my mother.”  Steve stacked a few plates.  “It’s good you came back,” he said.
“Happy took him down while everybody was distracted.” Tony made a wiping gesture with his hands. “Done and done.”
Because she looked a little pale too.
Not in the face of the sweetness they shared between them  The warmth, the soft barrier of love they had always been able to weave around themselves when they were together like this.  Something that held the goodness in and banished everything else into some cold outer darkness where it would wait until they parted once more.
“Strange thinks something happened to you before.  Thinks somebody was messing around up here,” he said, and tapped Steve’s pale forehead.  “We want to find out what happened, and we want to do it as quickly as possible.”  Tony tightened his grip on Steve, his thumb pressing into the top of his spine.  He looked up at Doctor Strange.  He nodded.  “It would be easier if Wanda…”
They ate at Steve’s tiny kitchen table, passing roast beef and mashed potatoes back and forth between them. Steve piled green peas onto Tony’s plate and stared him down until he ate them. Tony whined a little, but he did it. He actually liked peas, but it was a lot more fun pretending he didn’t, and having Steve badger him into eating them. It made him feel warm. Cared for. Only he and Jarvis would be the wiser, and Tony was pretty sure J. would keep his secret. Christ knows he had kept plenty of bigger ones over the years.
“Yeah?”
It had been raining for a week. Cold, gray,
He looked up.  “I’ll go,” he said plainly.
Steve smiled and shook his head.  “That’s silly, Tony.”
“Hey.”
He opened the door and held it while Steve rolled past.  “Maybe next you’ll finally tell me what a pangolin is.”
Tony reached out and scratched behind Sir Purr’s ear.  The cat turned his head into it.  The purring intensified.  “Glad you two are getting along,” Tony said.
Steve laughed a little and laid his head on Tony’s shoulder.
That was all.  He’d returned a letter, at last.
Tony nodded thoughtfully. “I’ll go take a look.”
“You’re right. Let’s just think about the future. Our future.”
Sam moved in front of him, looked him squarely in the eye. Tony flinched back a little. Those eyes were usually either calm and warm or filled with a quiet humor, but now they were blazing. “It’s my business because my two best friends are making each other miserable and they won’t get over themselves and knock it the fuck off,” he said in a loud whisper.
He strode across the grass and dropped to his knees beside Steve.  He ran his eyes over him, cataloguing the damage, the crushed pelvis, the heavy gash in his side still dribbling thick, ruby blood, assessing the percentage of internal damage, the probability of survival.
He looked up. “Howard,” he began, but Howard just shook his head.
forward to it. Even if he still had his reservations, he was looking forward to it. Every moment he spent with Tony--or even thinking about him--made the reservations he had seem a little smaller. A little sillier. God, that felt good.
He shrugged again.  “It’s okay, I guess.”
And now a scary thing was starting to happen. Tony’s eyes were starting to get red, and he was starting to look mad instead of just sad. “I said no, Steve,” he said loudly. “God. Just-I said I can’t. Leave me alone.”
with me!” Morgan said, stomping her foot. “You said you’d play with me."
“I like it too, Tony,” Steve whispered.
like Steve.  A question asked, deserved an answer.  No matter how esoteric it may be.
His fingers ran back into Steve's hair.  It was still wet from the shower, and it slid gloriously between them.  "Really."
“I promise,” she said.
Tony let out a breath. God. This again? “Not that it’s any of your business,” he said, “but no.”
Strange looked at him over steepled fingers.  “Yes.  Half the universe.”
“Were they lovers?”
cares. She never talks about my dad much, but she told me the other night how much he used to love her hair. Said he brushed it sometimes.” Steve wiped his eyes with one hand, and laughed under his breath. “I didn’t know what to say. I never know what to say.”
“Yes.”  She pulled back the covers and Steve climbed into the big bed beside her.  He curled his body around hers and she nestled into the curve of his arm.
“Why are you going?” Steve had asked.  “I thought you hated sports.”
Tony let out a breath, and Steve grinned again, relief rolling over him. “You might regret this later,” Tony said.
“Did you read any of the stuff on Algiers?”
That last thought didn’t really feel like his own.  Once, the part of him that gave voice to that particular thought had been the one of criticism and self-hatred.  Steve had helped him get over that.  Steve had gently but insistently turned him away from all--
“Don’t think I’ve ever had paprikash,” Tony said, and Sarah took his hand, giving him a tug.
“Buck,” he said, putting his hand on the side of Bucky’s face. He put it on the right side, avoiding the blistered skin on the left. “Bucky, listen to me. Listen. You’re gonna be okay. Okay? I’m gonna take care of you. Listen to me, soldier, you’re gonna be okay.” He spoke loudly but gently, his other hand digging through his pack by touch alone, searching for a tourniquet.
Steve squeezed his hip again, wishing mightily that he could kiss him. That he could just take him back to bed and lie down with him again. Wrap his arms around him and never let him go. Instead he said, “Talk to you later.”
“We probably should have skipped the fancy little canapes and just had these guys cater,” Tony said, taking another bite. “This is the best pizza ever.”
“Good.  Because I didn’t want to bring this up, but New York’s a cesspool.”
Four hours.
“Don’t do that, please.  They told me you were humble, but don’t do that.  I know what I know.  You’re a hero, Captain Rogers.  And after I put my girls to bed, I go down on my knees and thank God for you.  Every single night.”
Bucky and Gabe kept at it, both extolling the virtues of their choice for greatest player ever, but Steve let their voices fade away to a quiet hum, letting them become background noise. He took his cigarettes out of his pocket and shook one out, tapped it on the base of his thumb, then stuck it in his mouth. He patted his pocket for his lighter and lit his cigarette. He glanced down, putting his smokes away, and when he looked back up, he stopped moving.
“He said he never did any hypno-therapy.”
“Hey, you okay?” Steve asked, his thumb moving against Tony’s side.  “You’re shaking.”
A quick warning: there is the use of a homophobic slur here.  Sorry about that.
“Yes.”
“Take him to the safehouse.”
Tony looked at him, honestly puzzled.  He smiled a little.  “What else
“How pissed would you be if I sent the pangolin people some money?”
The first thing he saw was Steve, and he let out a breath he had no idea he had been holding.
The lines were back, uncertainty painted in broad, dark strokes across his face.  “Are you sure?  I mean, I thought that was...I shouldn’t have just assumed...”
Tony nodded.  “Yeah, sorry.  Just a little indigestion.  Are
Steve shook his head before she was even finished speaking. “No,” he insisted. “It wasn’t because of Tony. It was my decision. It was because of
to which Steve would invariably respond:
“Take your time,” she said, already rattling pans in the kitchen.
“Sure.”
“Hey,” he whispered, looking at Sarah to make sure she was still asleep. “You’re back.”
“That’s good.  I wanted it to be true.  So much of what I thought back then was...mixed up.  I didn’t want that to one of them.”
By the time they left, Dave was bowling a 200 again.  Tony was at 240 in spite of his hangover and perpetual semi.  Steve was a menace.  A foul-mouthed menace when he wanted to be, and Tony couldn’t wait to get home.
He slipped his arms around Steve’s waist. “Do I get a gold star?”
“Yes, doctor.”
Steve nodded.  “Then, I guess we fight.”
“‘Kay.”
“Let’s find out,” Tony said, and pressed his mouth lightly against Steve’s.
“Worth it.”
“I know you don’t believe it.”

it wasn’t you.  It’s not your fault.”
“Then let’s stop fighting and just talk.”
, and
days.”
“Um,” Tony said, “I’m going to go ahead and assume that means something nice.”
But it was really none of his business one way or the other. He had other things he had to think about.
“Yeah?”
“I didn’t--”
Steve kissed him again very slowly. He kept it soft, just as Tony had done, not even letting his tongue tease Tony’s. Not yet. Maybe later, but not quite yet. He felt like they still had a little talking to do first. “Do you think Morgan liked it?” he asked, curling his arm tighter around Tony.
Steve’s eyes shone, looking at him like he was the only thing in the world.  Or, at least the best thing.  “Yeah?  You’d want to do that?”
“Are you pissed or something?”
“Fuck you,
Well, came in second, but in Tony’s eyes, it was still a loss.
right. So fucking selfish.
“Look,” Steve said, letting out a breath. He turned to Jack, put his hand on his hip. It felt weird doing that. Almost wrong, but he kept it there. He wanted this. He
“I’ll buy you whatever you want.”
“I don’t know.”
Steve laughed again.  “I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone scream so loud.”
Steve laughed under his breath. “Yeah,” he said, then shrugged. “Graduation, I guess.”
Tony snorted and looked across the bar to where Natasha still sat with Bucky. She had his hand in hers, her finger tracing the line on his palm, like she was pretending to read his life-line. “Miss Romanov just gave you the whole scoop, didn’t she?”
Tears came to his eyes, and he wiped them hurriedly away, trying to regain his composure.  He remembered where he was.  That this man was a Colonel.
Tony rolled his eyes.  “You couldn’t have said that six weeks ago?”
Tony deliberately pushed his hips against Steve’s, feeling the hard length of him. “I can feel that.” Steve ducked his head, that blush heating his cheeks. “Oh god, don’t be embarrassed, baby,” Tony said, and linked his ankles around Steve’s waist, pulling him even closer. “It’s good,” he sighed. “So good.”
Steve crossed the bedroom to his side of the bed.  He brushed his fingers over the quilt, pressed them into the mattress.
And Steve just stood there. Just stood there, staring after him, and thought of the two of them sitting across from each other in a restaurant, or wandering through the park with cups of coffee, talking, shoulders touching, hands touching every once in a while,
Steve scrubbed a hand over his face then back through his hair.  It was a rough gesture, heavy and exhausted, and when he moved his hand away, Tony could see the faint network of fine lines at the corners of his eyes like fissures in fine bone china.  It shook Tony to see those lines.  Steve may not have thought he was immortal, but Tony wondered if maybe he, himself, had thought he was, even after Thanos.  He’d faced his own mortality many times--there was certainly a lot more salt in his hair than there had been five years ago--but the thought of it happening to Steve felt like blasphemy.  Again, he felt that need to protect him, that need to keep him safe.  And this wasn’t helping.

“I love you, too.”
Steve took a drag of his smoke, and sighed the smoke in his lungs back out. “I’m sorry, Tony.”
But Tony kept quiet.  Steve didn’t look at him, but he could feel his eyes on him, feel him listening, and his proximity made it easier to talk.
Sting of a needle.  Drifting again.  That cool, soft hand on his cheek.
plan?  Gee, thanks, Tony,” Nat said bitterly, and Tony squeezed her again.
“You love it.”
“Do that again,” Tony said, and Steve did, biting down a little before letting him go.
Tony looked up sharply from his phone.
“Nah. He’s going to sleep on the couch. Dodger’s lonely out there.”
Tony shook his head.  “No.”
he was looking forward to it. Before--before Tony and Morgan--when he’d thought about his future, all he’d seen was a long straight road he’d walk alone, but now that road seemed a lot more interesting. Something filled with twists and turns and valleys and peaks, and the best part was, he’d have someone beside him the whole way. He’d never be alone. Never again.
Steve came to him and took his hand, but instead of sitting beside him on the bed, he sank to his knees in front of him. Tony’s brain and body both tried to disconnect from reality when that happened, but he forced them back. Forced them to come back to the here and now by sheer force of his tremendous will.
“Take your clothes off,” Tony said. Steve sat up on his knees, straddling one of Tony’s thighs, and started to strip his shirt off, but Tony put his hand on his arm and he stopped. “Wait, nevermind,” Tony said, bending his knee to rub against him. “Finish taking mine off first. I can’t wait anymore. I need your hands on me.”
Steve expertly fit himself into the gap between Tony’s thighs. Tony didn’t have to move much--he just bent one knee, and let his other foot drop to the ground to make room--and then Steve was lying back against his chest, and Tony curled his arm around him, holding him close enough to stroke his neck.

“Why?”
Tony told her.
“I don’t know if it
“Um-”
Steve looked at Bruce.  His smile was simple.  Beautiful.  “The Hulk was with some sheep.”
But now a fledgling worry bloomed inside his chest.  They had never specifically discussed sleeping arrangements.  And there was a second-floor loft.  There wasn’t a bed up there, but there were some comfy-looking couches.  Steve couldn’t see them from below, but Tony had told him that.  Exactly that.  “Two comfy-looking couches,” not thinking for a moment that maybe Steve assumed that’s where Tony planned to sleep.
.  Am I supposed to turn away such a talent when it's practically begging to work for me?”
“That’s what Rocket said.”
“‘Recovery of the town’?”
“Don’t be nervous,” he said.  “You’re going to be great.”
Sam shook his head, squeezing his shoulder.  “It’s alright, Steve.  You go on to bed.”  He lifted his eyes to Tony and looked at him steadily, conveying with his eyes alone what the expectations were:
They gave off a strong, comforting parent-vibe.  They had always acted almost like parental figures to Steve and Tony, as well.  Tony liked that, and was glad it hadn't changed when Jeff passed away.
want to.”
For once, Tony was at a loss for words to say.  Give up on him?  He who had loved him and challenged him and seen something in him when no one else could?  He who had never compromised himself for anyone or anything?  He who had shown bravery, nobility, chivalry, honor?  Had proven time and time again that those were not dead values, that they could still exist in this world that sometimes shunned them?  He who had given himself over, placed his heart and his body into Tony’s hands, trusting him with everything he had, everything he was or ever would be?  Give up on him?  The very idea was laughable.  More, it was insanity, madness in its purest form.
Steve climbed the stairs with a little spring in his step--he couldn’t help that either--and at his door, he took his keys out of his pocket. He turned his head when the door next to his opened.
Steve rode it out, barely bracing himself against the ‘Cuda’s leather dash with one hand.  “You trying to kill us, Stark?” he asked mildly.
“I need to go too,” Obadiah said. Steve tried not to watch out of the corner of his eye as Obadiah levelled a finger at Tony. “
Steve curled his arm tighter around him. Pietro resisted for a second, then gave in and held him. Steve put his head on his shoulder. “I know,” he whispered. “I know. You deserve better than that.”
Tony stepped closer and gave her a short tight hug.  “Fair enough.  But I insist you tell me when something gets serious.  I am paying you, after all.”
“Then we do it your way.”  He looked at Bruce and raised his eyebrows.  “Right, Bruce?”
And, honestly, Steve
What the actual fuck?
“Nah,” Tony said.  “I’m good.”
“I’m leaving tomorrow,” Steve said. “It really would only be for a minute.”
it was. If Tony could pray for it, so could Steve.
He watched her and his own intuition began to add things up on a big mental chalkboard. So, later, after dinner was gone, and the leftovers were put away, and they were sitting at the table with pieces of pie and cups of hot coffee, and he asked her what was wrong, he wasn’t totally surprised when she told him.
“I know, Mom. Sorry.”
“...It was cold.  It was like he was a different person.”  Tony shook his head.  “Whoever it was, it wasn’t
He looked at Steve, a tender, broken look.  “Is he--?”
Bruce put his hand on Steve’s shoulder.  “Steve,” saying his name in an even tone, repeating it.  Repetition was good.  Relaxing.  “Steve, let’s go inside.  Cool down, alright?”
that thing’s daddy, Tony.”
“Maybe I could cook dinner?” Steve suggested almost nervously. “And then we could light a fire or something?”
“Hello?” Her curious voice.
“Josh, huh?” Steve repeated, but kept his eyes firmly fixed on Natasha’s face. He didn’t want to look over there anymore. He didn’t want to see Tony and
“Hey,” he called, and both the sheriff and Steve looked up.  Tony had eyes for only one of them.  “Hey, you.”
“Are you
Steve thrashed to a stop, shocked at the sudden interruption. His eyes flew to Tony’s face, wide and wild for only the briefest second before they turned professionally blank. Tony’s heart cracked just a little. It was the way they had regarded him for the last sixteen days.
“Yeah.”
of them. Because that meant the hard stuff was behind them. They could just be together now. Happy.
But this time, along with Tony’s text saying, “COME HOME. I WANT SEX.”, there was also a missed call from an unknown number, and a voicemail message.
“Pfft.
They looked at each other, then Natasha was suddenly in his arms, hugging him fiercely, and kissing his cheek. Tony tensed, startled, then hugged her back just as enthusiastically. He was surprised, but very happy. Very, very happy.
Tony kissed his throat again, and Steve took him in his arms.  “Thank you, baby.”
Tony looked around, making sure everything was okay.  He didn’t really care if anyone knew about their daytime trysts, but Steve would be embarrassed.  He didn’t want to embarrass Steve.
“That’s a little harder.”
“The glass, Captain.”
“That’s not an answer, Tony.  That’s not a
“Is this the page you were on, Steve?” Tony asked against his lips.
“No,” Steve said simply, and held Tony tighter. “I love you. You know that, don’t you?”
“I’m not going to do that.”
They held each other for a while, standing pressed up against the door, Tony shuddering within the safety of Steve’s arms. When he finally got himself under control, he un-self-consciously wiped his face on the front of Steve’s shirt. Steve huffed out a soft laugh.
Steve nodded shyly.
“I know.”
BOOO!  I can't seem to stop putting these poor guys through shit.  Sorry.
worry.”
Steve put his head in his hands again. “Me too,” he said faintly, then lifted his head up enough to look at those hands. Pale. Large. Strong. But they couldn’t hold onto anything. Not anything real. “But it doesn’t matter anyway. ‘Cause I won’t even be here to go to the movies, will I? I’ll be over there. Doing-” he laughed that brittle, broken laugh again, and Tony shuddered because he’d heard it before. From his father. “-Doing whatever it is I’ll be doing over there. Fighting. Or trying to stop people from fighting. Or whatever, I guess. Whatever they tell me to do.”
An ember in his stomach flared to brilliant, glowing life. “Yeah,” Tony said. “Lucky for her, she got her mother’s looks.”
Tony nodded. He nodded and threw the car in gear.
He nodded, and she smiled again. “Good.  That’s good.”
It wasn’t in color, that now almost life-size image, but it didn’t need to be.  Tony’s mind could add the gold streaks to the hair, the faintest pink tint to the creamy pale skin.  Even the faded blue of that ratty old Yankees t-shirt he refused to give up.  He was lying on his back, one hand behind his head, the other one on his stomach, and Tony thanked god his eyes were closed.  If he’d had to imagine the exact color of those blue, Irish eyes, he thought he might go crazy.  As it was, he still felt a little crazy.
Tony sighed again. “They’re getting him.”
“I’ll be generous and give you one more Christmas,” Ross answered.  “How does December 26th sound?”
“Tony--”
Steve leaned a little closer, but his eyes stayed on Wanda. “She said she’s an angel.”
Tony sucked on it, making needy little whimpering sounds that might have been embarrassing if he gave even one single fuck, but he didn’t. He didn’t. All he cared about was touching every inch of Steve’s body that he could. All he cared about was tasting him, sucking on him, scratching, biting anywhere and everywhere that was available to him.
“Nothing.”
“Hey,” he whispered, vehemently.  “Baby,
Strange leaned forward, studying Tony, as if trying to decide if this was a joke.  “Wanda?” he asked.  “You mean the little witch?”
Her voice was shocked, worried.
Dumb gratitude coursed through him.  He forgot Peggy, he forgot Tony, he forgot even that shivery, electric feeling that resided in the axe’s haft.  He nodded.  “Okay,” he said, “yeah, of course, I’ll be there.”
“I miss you,” he said.
Even as she thought it, another voice called out.  “Steve?”  Natasha looked down the hill.  She knew the voice, knew the line of the shoulder, the set of the jaw.  She never went with Steve when he visited Wakanda, even though he asked her to.  He didn’t question her about it and that was a good thing, because it was too complicated in her own mind to explain it.  She had dreams, though, dreams where he chased her under that freeway overpass again and again with murder in his eyes.  There were other dreams too.  Dreams of a dark shape in a red room, watching her but never coming close enough to see, just a shape and a voice saying her name like it was saying it now, here on this hilltop with the man they both loved lying on the ground between them.
He looked up from where his toe had been drawing in the dust, and Tony was standing at the edge of the clearing. That sad look was still on his face, but now it seemed even darker--even sadder--and that made Steve want to make him feel better even more.
“Sh-sh-sh,” Ross soothed gently, lying him back on the cold, damp grass.  “Don’t talk, Stark.  I know that’s not in your nature, but just keep your mouth shut for a minute.”
couldn’t be right because that smelled like pancakes, and not only was he still in bed, but Morgan didn’t even
“And we can build a bonfire on the beach.”
“Yeah.” Because he couldn’t stop babbling.
Steve drew in a deep breath. He couldn’t articulate what he was thinking, because he wasn’t even
Steve’s eyes moved hungrily across it, then met Tony’s over the hood.  “You finished it.”
“If you want to,” Steve said, and loosened the towel around his waist. “I’ve never done it before, so I don’t really know what to say, but-” he gave his cock one long, hard stroke, “-if you want to,
.  Don’t say that in front of him.  You’re going to hurt his feelings.”
Steve pulled away, ducking his head and swiping at his cheeks with the back of his hand. “What are you doin’ here? Don’t tell me you’re visiting your dad?”
“You never give up, do you?”
“I don’t want you to go back with him,” Steve said quietly.
“No.  No buts.  Go to the Tower.  Stay there for a day or two.  Get used to each other again.”
Steve shook his head. “No. Just taking my time.”
Sam sat back in the booth, quiet for a moment.  Tony had the feeling he was gearing up for something, and he waited.  He wanted to hear what he had to say.  Not only because of the way he looked when he spoke, either.  When Sam spoke, it was for a reason.  He wasn’t a bullshit type of guy.  He was like Steve that way.  Tony admired it.  Envied it a little.  He, himself,
“I’m not your fucking sex-doll, Rogers,” he snapped.  “God, you go away for awhile and you come back a totally different person.  What’d they do to you in that hospital?”
Finally, Steve shifted.  His hands came up to rest on Tony’s waist like they had downstairs.  Again he didn’t push him away, didn’t pull him closer, just held him.  He put his face into Tony’s neck.  “Come upstairs with me.”
Tony laughed. He couldn’t help it. “Yeah. Really digging that whole ‘respect’ thing. If you were respect
was the Steve he had known. This dry humor. This tiny, pleased smile. He didn’t know who that other guy at the reception had been, but this was someone he could talk to. Someone he
“Not really.  Pepper flew to Washington last night after the party.  I’m on my own tonight.”
“What’d you do that for?”
“Shut
Steve shook his head, not moving it from his knees.  “No.  No.  You’re not here.  You’re never here.  You need to go.  Leave me alone.”
appreciate it.
They sat silently together, the three of them, for awhile.  Nat put her cheek against Bruce’s knee, taking comfort in his touch.  Tony watched and his mind cast back to the times he had done the same with Steve.  Touching just to touch.  Feeling just to feel.  Everything had felt right when they were together.  Like everything was just as it should be.  He wondered if it could be that way again.  What it would take.  If Steve would be willing to put those roots down in the soil next to Tony’s.  If they could still grow something together.
Jarvis kept quiet while he projected the designs, but Tony could sense the humor still there, bubbling just beneath the surface, and he was glad. He didn’t want Jarvis to be mad at him. He just wanted to get through the night until Steve came home.
She hummed a bit in his ear, and he could almost hear the churn of her thoughts. “Alright,” she said at last. “Come over. Two o’clock. You can help me with the laundry.”
won’t tell me what a fucking pangolin is--”
“I hate it.”
“He wasn’t trying to impress me.”
Tony brushed his hand over Steve’s smooth cheek.  “You jump, I jump, Jack.”
--for Tony Stark because of that other need he had. That compulsion. That obsession with giving Tony what he deserved. All those years. So many years. And now here he was, climbing the steps up to him, because finally--
“Tony,” she said patiently.  “This is one of the reasons why he didn’t want to tell you he was going.  Don’t you get that?”
place.
"Doctor Strange," he said quietly, "you need to tell me what's going on, right now."
“We’d start you out on salary,” he said. “An office. Mr. Wong could get you caught up to speed on any and all projects he thinks you’d fit with.” He gestured a bit, then picked up his coffee cup. “Or, if you would rather remain a free agent, we’d be happy with any consulting or freelance work you’d be interested in doing.”
Steve closed his eyes.  That feeling of peace began to return as Tony’s fingers moved through his hair and brushed over the smooth skin at the back of his neck.  He moved a little, tucking his head under the shelf of Tony’s jaw, and when Tony tightened his grip on his shoulders, Steve knew a moment of happiness that was so deep it hardly felt real.
“You’re not just getting the door for me?” I asked, joking, trying to stop myself from crying.
I pulled my pillow over my face. “I’ll come eat a little later.”
Mr. Stark squeezed my shoulder before I went up to give my eulogy.
The funeral was bigger than we anticipated. Everyone from the neighbourhood had shown up. Homeless people she’d given spare change to, the bodega man with the funky Hawaiian shirts she always complimented, the staff from the Thai place that were all in love with her. Of course, Mr. Stark, Ms. Potts, Happy, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Barnes, Mr. Banner, Miss Romanoff, Mr. Barton, Mr. Thor, Col. Rhodes, an ambassador from Wakanda (since I guess King T’Challa couldn’t make it), Mr. Lang, Miss Maximoff, Mr. Vision, and Mr. Wilson. And MJ and Ned.
Once the door closed behind him, I smacked Ned’s arm. “Not cool, dude.”
“Yep. And now I have to write a paper about it.”
“I know, Mr. Rogers.”
Morgan pulled the pillow away and tossed it off of the bed, and held out this little red glove with a round blue light on the palm. “Come get lunch or get blasted.”
“Sounds like he was kind of misogynistic.”
“Hey, guys, how’s the project coming?”
But, funnily enough, I don’t think Mr. Stark needed to be told.
“I know, kid. I know.”
Mr. Rogers came in while I was biting into the second half of the sandwich.
“Yeah, don’t mention it, kid.”
“Nope. Here’s what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get him something small but sweet and attach a note asking him out. That way, you don’t have to try to ask him out in person and don’t necessarily have to get an answer to your face.”
I offered him a small smile. “I guess that’s only fair.”
I closed the fridge door and rested my forehead against the cool metal.
Even on the last day, when her doctors were telling me I should go sit with her and hold her hand while they tried to ease her passing, I somehow convinced myself that her pulse would get stronger and her eyes would get brighter and her skin would regain its colour.
Mr. Stark rolled his eyes. “Okay, Peter, maybe all of this laying around has gotten your imagination up and running. Finish your sandwich and come out of your cave for a bit. We’ll watch a movie or something.”
“Would you like me to play the next clip?” FRIDAY asked.
I walked home from the hospital that evening. The sky was a dark grey-blue, light rain wetting the cement under my feet. I had a backpack full of her stuff, things I’d brought her in the hospital to try to cheer her up. Old photos of the family, some of Uncle Ben’s old things that still carried the scent of cologne. A few of my academic awards. Stuff like that.
Didn’t I owe him at least an-an
I glanced down, remembering May’s empty hospital room. “Uh, your dad was sorta the only family I had left.”
“You two seem…
But she wasn’t.
He laughed. “She had other talents.”
“I’m assuming you’re countering him hard?”
“I know.”
“Yep!” she chirped proudly. “He’s easier to get out of bed than Daddy.”
“What about the rest of your family?” she asked, eyes wide.
Nevertheless, I got to work, still stealing glances whenever I could.
“I just…there’s this girl. MJ. And she’s amazing. Talented, intelligent, witty enough to throw Mr. Stark off. And I…I keep thinking about how much he would’ve liked her. I just wish I could talk to him.”
There was a long pause, and then a sigh. “Alright. I’ll go shopping. You gotta help me with the gift wrap, though. And maybe I’ll get some calligraphy done for the note.”
Mr. Stark came into my room that Friday, dressed up a little, wearing a cologne I’d only noticed him wearing to events. Ned and I were working on a project together when he came in.
And she never would be again.
“Tony said he always wanted a little girl. And we…we missed having a kid. She’s…she’s not a replacement, but she’s-”
Thai leftovers.
“I believe there’s still work to be done in your room,” FRIDAY suggested, and I took that suggestion and turned around.
“Uh, since said someone and I battled it out in the middle of snowy buttfuck nowhere over his best friend killing my parents. God, maybe I should just…leave it alone.”
“Hey, Queens. Good to see you eating.”
There was a long pause as Mr. Stark stared at us, and I was scared he was going to start yelling, but then he burst out laughing.
We sat out there and watched the sun set over the water, over the bundle of flowers with a glimmer of metal and glass in the centre.
He’d told me after the ferry incident that if something happened to me, he’d feel like it was his fault. But this wasn’t his fault.
“Yep.”
“I’m not making it up. When Scott came up with his time travel theory to get the stones back, Tony refused to even try it. He said it was too dangerous and that there wasn’t a lot of likelihood that we’d succeed. And then he and I were in the kitchen one night washing the dishes and he accidentally sprayed the shelf, and he took down a picture of the two of you to wipe the water off. He didn’t sleep that night, Peter. He figured out time travel instead, and that’s when we all went back and got the stones and brought everyone back. He risked it all because he missed you so badly.”
and call it a day.”
“Wow, Morgan, you got Queens out of bed.”
“Mr. Stark?” I asked, turning around. It felt like every cell in my body was fighting, clinging to each other. It hurt like hell. “I don’t feel so good.”
Steve put a hand on my shoulder. “That’s not on you, Peter. You can’t save everybody.”
Scoffing lightly, I looked up. “You don’t have to try to make me feel better.”
Ned shrugged. “Not on whether you’d ask him out. Whether or not he’d reject you.”
There was a weird jingle, and the display lit up again. This time, instead of FRIDAY’s footage, there was Mr. Stark’s face. In the corner of the display, was the word EDWARD.
“I’m sorry.”
He squeezed me tighter, and I buried my face in his shoulder.
“Thanks. Whatcha working on tonight?”
Not long after that, I heard Happy and Mr. Stark talking. They were downstairs, in the workshop. I was in the living room, working on my first essay of the semester, but I could hear everything, clear as day. There were benefits to having your senses dialled up to 11.
I sniffled, wiping under my eyes. “N-nothing. I just…I can’t stop thinking about Mr. Stark.”
She ran to me, wrapping her arms around me and resting her head against my stomach.
“She’s right, kid. You’re family.” Steve gave me an approving nod. I smiled back at him.
Happy and I took her to get cheeseburgers after the funeral, giving Mr. Rogers some time out by the water.
“Save him?”
I learned afterwards that they’d married and adopted a little girl in my absence. Mr. Rogers introduced me to Morgan a couple days after we returned from the battle, explaining that I was her dad’s godson and had gone away for a few years, but he’d brought me back.
I helped Mr. Rogers pull the gauntlet off of Mr. Stark’s cold hand. We were both teary-eyed and numb. I held onto the gauntlet as he and Col. Rhodes carried Mr. Stark’s body.
He scoffed a little. “You know, after everything, at least call me Steve.”
“Are you sure you still want to watch the next clip?”
There was another long pause.
“That’s not what I meant.”
And then the fantasy was interrupted by my alarm clock, waking me up for class.
The shower I had here was…huge. It had weird features, too. Massage jets, steam functions, speakers embedded in the walls. Not that I didn’t absolutely love all of the weird features. It was amazing. I stayed in there until I was an especially wrinkly prune.
“I would advise against continuing towards the living areas, Mr. Parker,” she said.
Mr. Stark grinned. “I’ll turn a blind eye to a scorch mark or two.”
I stopped playback and wiped at my wet cheeks.
“Always have, Tony. You always have.”
“God, that’s not gonna stick, is it?” I groaned, sitting down and pulling out my notebooks and laptop.
“It’s a two-minute fix, Rogers, I’ll work on it tonight.”
“Since when is Tony Stark afraid of asking someone out?”
Happy and I stayed with her during the funeral while Mr. Rogers mourned his husband. She held my hand tight, turning her face into the fabric of my suit during a couple of the extra sad speeches.
That became a weekly tradition. However, one week, about a week from the start of the fall semester, I went into the city to hang out with Ned and MJ, and missed movie night. When I got back, though, Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers were asleep on the couch, the end of a Denzel Washington movie playing. Mr. Stark’s head was on Mr. Rogers’ shoulder, Mr. Rogers’ head resting on Mr. Stark’s.
In the days that followed, Mr. Stark and Happy helped me pack up the apartment and move out to the compound. We talked to lawyers about May’s will, talked to funeral directors and florists about the funeral, talked to the landlord and May’s bank. May had managed to get most of her affairs in order before she was too sick to deal with it, but what was left was our job to handle, and it was painful.
“When I was about your age, my parents died in a plane crash. It really sucked, and I miss them a lot, but you know what? It sucks less now than it did then. And you know that your dad loved you tons, and would’ve done anything and everything for you. And you still have tons of family. You’ve got your papa, and me, and Uncle Happy and Uncle Rhodey.”
“What? He had a good sense of humour about it.”
“Actually,” I piped up, “I love
“Teenagers. Alright, well, we’ll be out for a couple hours. Try not to burn the place down while I’m gone.”
FRIDAY offered to play another clip, but I declined, and turned off the display. It was too much.
“Alright, come here.” He slid closer and pulled me into a hug.
But those goodbyes were real. And the long beep that accompanied her eyes glazing over…was real.
Mr. Rogers gave me one more smile and then headed out of the room.
The second thing was the sheer amount of cardio I did just walking from room to room. I was used to stepping out of my bedroom and into the kitchen. I had to get used to stepping out of my bedroom into a long hallway of other bedrooms and walk down to the kitchen. It wasn’t a long walk to the kitchen, but it was definitely an adjustment.
On one particular night, I’d arrived late, slightly ruffled by some swinging around and webbing up bad guys.
“He’s not gonna reject you,” Happy argued, trying to settle Mr. Stark’s nerves.
“But he saved
“Hey,” Mr. Stark said, nudging my shoulder. “She was so proud of you.”
Mr. Stark sighed, dropping his head and pinching his nose. “Maybe we should just watch
Now she looked up, taking in my slightly roughed up appearance. “Depends. How bad were the bad guys?”
“Thamks for the sammich,” I mumbled through a mouthful.
There was a bit of an…adjustment period, living at the compound.
They got back a few hours later, and I heard footsteps go the way of the living room. I headed down the hallway, ready to go ask how the date went, but FRIDAY stopped me.
I rolled my eyes, and got back to work.
I watched her work. She’d pulled her hair up into a big bun on top of her head, small curls falling down and framing her face. I wished I could study her instead of my finance homework.
I dropped my head, letting myself cry a little. “It’s not fair. Why did he have to die for Thanos’ crimes?”
“I don’t wanna cry all over your expensive jacket.” But my voice was already breaking.
He stood up, moving the chair back to my desk, and left the room.
I was grateful for it, too.
“Women’s studies. It’s killing me. We had a guest speaker today, and he was absolutely awful. Talked a lot of shit about how women are warriors but have been taught to be docile and therefore allowed ourselves to be pushed aside in society.”
Steve smiled and laid back on the pillows. “You can go to work, Tony,” he said. “Nat’s probably worried anyway. You can just drop me off on your way.”
“Good,” Steve said.
“But it’s still true.”
She wrapped her arm around his waist, holding on.  “No, I’m sorry,” she laughed.  “Let me stay.  You’re too comfy.”
Steve hooked his finger through Tony's belt loop.  "I didn't mean what I said."
man was, but he didn’t.  He saved him.  Again.
“We’re not his home anymore, FRI.  Maybe we never were.”
Bruce looked at his feet.  “No,” he said.  “Of course not.  I just came to see how you’re doing.”
He stopped in Morgan’s room first. Her night light was on, and she lay in a sprawl on the bed, pink lips parted, covers kicked off again. Steve shook his head, smiling a little. She must get that from Pepper. Tony slept either huddled against Steve’s side or curled into a tight ball, blankets locked securely--sometimes too securely. He was a blanket-thief--around himself.
“It’s okay,” Nat said.  “Let them have this.”  Bucky nodded mutely, and she folded his hand into hers.
“I don’t have to,” Steve said. “‘Cause we’re done, right? I mean, even if I hadn’t joined, we would still be done.”
“Christ, Rogers, just
The only knowledge they had of Tony came from Bruce.  He’d seen him go up into a ship and that was it.  He had tried to access FRIDAY’s archives but could not get past Tony’s firewalls.  No one knew where he was.  Or if he was alive or dead.  And that was the worst part.  There was no “and” at the end of Tony’s sentence.  It just ended.  It just stopped.
just paid for it.  It’s mine, and you’re done, do you hear me?”
“There are still threats out there, Stark,” he’d said.  “We need to neutralize them before they become too big to handle.”  His eyes had gone to Steve’s sleeping form, small in the hospital bed.  “We’re already a man down, and I don’t think Barton’s coming back.  We need you.”
“You. I need you.”
They were sitting out on the back deck.  The sun was getting low, but it wasn't dark yet, and it wouldn't be dark for awhile if Mother Nature had anything to say about it.  It was May, spring was in full bloom, and in their little corner of the world, dusk liked to hang around awhile. That was fine with Tony.
Nat and Steve went to pick up the cake.  As it turned out, not only was he a bad-ass bowler, but Tony’s friend Jeff was an even more bad-ass baker.  He’d done cakes for half the town and was thrilled to do this one too.
Steve took a sip of his coffee. It was hot and sweet. Milk or cream. He always drank his coffee straight up, but this tasted good. Better than it probably should. And he was glad he had it in his hands right now. Sometimes he didn’t know what to do with his hands. At least in situations considered “social”. Put a Beretta or a Sig Sauer in his hands and he was golden, but take that away, and he was suddenly a fumbling idiot. The coffee was a decent compromise. Or at least one he could work with.
sure about that one--if anyone could afford a high-end custom toupée, it was Howard Stark--but no one came to a cancer-treatment center unless they had to.
“If expecting people to be better makes you different, then maybe we should all try to be a little more different.”
She stood at the door, put her hand on it, and used her red-painted nails to tap on it.  Steve recognized the Morse Code:  -.-. .-.. .. -. -
“It’s not really a big d-”
you, dummy. He
“Tony?  Are you okay?”
“It’s no big deal,” Steve said slowly.  “I used to smoke sometimes before the ice.  Everybody did.  It’s fine.”
not a puppet-guy, are you? You don’t look like a puppet-guy.”
“You’re welcome, boss.”
“There you go again.”
She glanced back at their table. Tony’s half-eaten burger. Bruce’s stabbed-at salad. “Do you want a box?”
Steve’s tongue poked nervously out of his mouth and dabbed his upper lip before disappearing back inside. “I wanted to make you feel better,” he said. “I’m sorry.”
Tony lifted their still-clasped hands and kissed Steve’s knuckles over the red silk. “Oh baby,” he said. “We both know you’ll do it. I know your weakness now. I can get you to say yes.”
“Come on.”
Tony shrugged.  “What we talked about.”
space.”
“Then can we get hot chocolate?”
Steve nodded. “Yeah. Three years.”
His employees were happy, and that made him happy. If that made him a fool, then at least he was a happy one.
He kissed her once, then let her go.  She stepped through the portal.
“Don’t say that.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Captain.  I was just doing my job.”
the anger and worry in it. It hurt his heart.
Tony eased himself back down onto Steve’s chest. He turned his head and kissed him over his heart, ran his hands over his body with lazy, languid motions. “You’re going to think about it too, right?” he asked, toying with the smooth cup of Steve’s ear.
“It really is okay.”
“No way.  Don’t do it, FRIDAY.  I want to see my boy in the sun.”
Tony laughed.  “Trust me, Rogers, this is one area where I know
“Tony.
Tony didn’t understand.  Had stomped out of the room leaving Steve alone again, badly hurt, nearly broken.  Steve didn’t blame him.  Perhaps in Tony’s shoes, he would have done the same thing, but what Tony couldn’t see was that Steve was doing this
Tony took the pizza with one hand and trailed the other softly and deliberately across Steve’s throat.  He was rewarded with a ragged sigh and a glimpse of Steve’s pink tongue as it left his mouth to wet his lips.  He closed his eyes, too, and kept them closed as Tony took the pizza back to the table and sat it down next to FRIDAY’s daisies.  Kept them closed as Tony adjusted the plates and napkins.  Kept them closed while Tony snapped off the light, leaving the room in a deep semi-darkness, lit only by the warm glow of the candles and the shifting red-orange or the fire crackling in the large stone hearth.
“Yes,” Steve gasped, falling even further back against Tony, letting him hold him up, giving himself wholly over to him without a second thought because that was the way it should be. “Yes, Tony.”
“I didn’t do anything,” Steve said, laughing again.
“My name is Colonel Hunt.  We haven’t met.”
He thought of a certain centenarian.  “That’s for sure.”
Do Not
Tony supposed it could have gone worse.
“Hey!” he squawked.  “Leave me out of this, too.”
, I just can’t--” his mouth began to work, tears of fear, of frustration filled his eyes, broke free, and ran down his cheeks.
“Well, why
“Ignoring me.”
“Come on,” Tony said, and plucked at his jacket. “Let’s go study.”
“Okay,” he said, and wheeled out of the kitchen.
Tony squeezed his hand in between both of his. “That’s not what happened.”
“Stay here.  Stay with us.  We need you.”
“Steve,” Tony said simply.
She patted his shoulder, consolingly. She was an older lady, sweet, motherly. Tony said she’d been there for as long as he could remember. “Do you want your usual, hun?”
“It’s lasagna.”
Josh turned to Tony abruptly. “Babe,” he said. “I want to dance.”
you said it to me.  I’m no expert, but isn’t that the hallmark of the whole ‘getting married’ thing?”
He thought, three years ago when he watched him--from a safe distance, of course--hug his mother and Sam good-bye, and climb up onto that bus, that that would be the end of it. They might write to each other a couple of times, or maybe call once or twice, but Steve had made it clear they were over. And even when he was on leave, New York was a big town. Lots of land mass. Lots of people. And Tony didn’t even live here full-time anymore. Neither of them did. Tony split his time between MIT, California, and Manhattan, and Steve...well, Steve lived halfway across the world. How in Christ’s name would he ever see him again? No, he thought that they were done. Like Steve had said. Right up until tonight, Tony sincerely thought he had seen the last of Steven Grant Rogers.
.  I worry about him.  He’s more than just a brother, you know.  He’s...part of me.  Like my other half.  The good half.  And I worry about him.  I always worried about him.  Ever since we were kids, I worried about him.”
“Ich hätte dich das erste Mal töten sollen.”
Tony was on his feet and across the garage in five large steps.  Steve wrapped his arms around his waist and buried his face in Tony’s stomach.  Tony hugged him, clenching his fist in his shirt, the other around his neck.
Almost immediately, a frowny-face emoji appeared.  Tony laughed.  Who had taught him to text?  But he knew.  Clint.
He pushed that aside. Or as much as he could, anyway. This was important. Not just to him, but to the world, and he thought if anyone could understand that, it would be Steve. But by the time he finished talking with John, made sure he had a cab to his hotel, and drove himself home, Tony was tired and almost insane with anticipation of seeing Steve. Or not seeing him. Depending on whatever it was that Steve wanted.
Steve saved him.  Like he’d saved him a hundred times, maybe a thousand, since they’d met all those years ago.  Like he’d saved him in every possible way.  He didn’t have to.  He could have just stood by and let Tony flounder, trying to tell this familiar, unknown girl who this tall, blond, nerdy, pig-headed, sweet, gentle,
“Of course, he did,” Sam said.  “He didn’t talk about you much, but sometimes we’d see something, and he’d say, ‘Tony should see that.’  Or we’d need something, and he’d get frustrated and say ‘God, if Tony was here…’”  He shrugged.  “He thought about you a lot.”
. It wasn’t like Tony cared anything about him. Why would he? He was just some guy.
He put his arm around her and kissed her temple.  She leaned against him.  “Tell us about the doctor,” she said.
“Yes?”
“Just...just don’t.  Okay?  I don’t want you to.”
“That’s right.”
he thought.
“Do you mean that?” Tony pleaded. “I need to know for sure. I need to
After the movie, they went to the diner. No one would ever make the mistake of saying it was a nice place, not with its Formica table tops, vinyl booths, and fluorescent lights, but it was a
“Tony? Do you think, since it’s just for today, that we could...pretend everything’s okay? Between us, I mean? Do you think we could pretend that nothing’s changed?”
“Can I come in?” the words out of his mouth before he had even realized they were on his tongue.
Tony fidgeted as he watched the other inmates with their families.  They were mostly men, the visitors mostly women.  Their wives, Tony assumed, or maybe their sisters.  There were a few who could only be mothers, women with tears on their faces and hands that reached out to touch a pale cheek, but caught themselves at the last moment and quickly pulled back.
Steve nodded and brushed her hair back behind her ear. “Yeah. It is.”
She nodded, her smile easy, her eyes dark and watchful.  “You bet I do.”
And because his eyes had followed her across the room, because she was standing right next to Tony--at attention, like a soldier--Steve could put it off no longer.  “Hello, Tony,” he said.  His guts roiled inside his stomach, but his voice came out firm, in control.
“Tony-”
knew it, but Tony was a special-occasion-only kind of guy.  He let Steve do the heavy lifting on the day-to-day front, and that was fine with Steve.  He liked cooking.  Liked taking individual, disparate things and turning them into something new.  Something more than the sum of its parts.  In a way, it was nearly god-like, that act of transformation.  Maybe that was blasphemy.  Steve didn’t care.  He didn’t care much about blasphemy anymore.  He’d stopped caring about the same time he’d encountered the Tesseract and realized there might be more out there than he’d previously believed.  Or, at least, different.  He still believed in God.  He just wasn’t so sure the God he believed in now got as worked up over the little things as the one he’d believed in when he was a kid.
“We’ve eaten in restaurants together, he said, “but just you and me?  Alone like this?” he shook his head.
Tony smiled. “Just-”
Tony tried to soothe him.  Tried to be supportive, and took it upon himself to do all the household stuff for the last week so Steve could study.  Steve let him, and that made Tony feel good.  That Steve trusted him to take over and never questioned him even when Tony did everything his own way instead of the way Steve usually did it.
“It’s what
Steve, who had really only been aware of Tony sitting dangerously close, could only bob his head.  He couldn’t hear a melody.  Couldn’t hear anything but Tony’s voice, really, but he agreed.  “Yeah, Tony.  It is.  It’s really pretty.”
“I had to get you to notice me somehow.”

“And you love me, right?”
for six weeks. That may not have seemed like a long time for most people, but it was Tony’s second-longest romantic relationship. Only Pepper had stuck it out with him longer, and they’d had a solid base of years already spent together to build on. He and Steve didn’t have that. Their history was a little more complicated. But in spite of that, or maybe because of it, they were the happiest six weeks Tony could remember ever spending, and he wanted to give Steve something to thank him for that. Something to show him how much he meant to Tony. How much
Steve shook his head slowly. “No. I haven’t. Have you?”
“How does it feel?” Tony asked.
Steve blinked up at him, the clouds leaving his eyes.  “Oh.  Hey,” he said.  “Did I fall asleep?  I didn’t miss the end of the story, did I?”
It wasn’t a command--Tony had never commanded him to do anything the entire time they had known each other--but it wasn’t a mere suggestion, either. It felt like a request. Something he could do or not do. Something Tony
He was closer to New York, so he went back to the Tower.  If he’d been nearer to California, he would have went to Malibu.  He’d re-built the house there a while back but hadn’t actually lived there yet.  Once Steve had come into the picture, there hadn’t seemed any point.  Steve wasn’t a California guy.
“‘Kay.”
“Beautiful.”
“Sure.  What is it?”
“Um,” he managed. “Sure.” He stripped his jacket off and handed it to her. She laid it across her arms, treating it like it was five thousand-dollar mink instead of second-hand, scuffed leather.
It didn’t last long. Not really. Just a second. Just a lifetime. Just long enough for Steve to think that maybe the world wasn’t crumbling away after all. No, the world wasn’t going anywhere. Uh-uh. Not
“Yeah, kiddo. I’m good. I’m really good.”
Tony swallowed past a lump that had suddenly lodged itself in his throat. “I-I’ll bet it’s great, baby.”
Nat yanked his arm.  “Come on, Steve.”
Tony hung back, letting Steve leave the office first.  When he was gone, Tony said, "You should have told me," in a low, icy voice.
“You better not be handling another genius,” Tony said, getting the smile he’d hoped for.  “Seriously, though, baby, he’ll be fine.”
“No.”

there. And so what if he and Pepper had never had a great passion between them? So what if they were more like best friends than true lovers? It didn’t matter. They had a marriage. A good, solid, comfortable marriage. That was what he needed. That was what he wanted to give to Morgan. A homelife uncorrupted. Untainted. That was what he had promised her the second he saw her. That was what he would provide for her. And his feelings for Steve--his desire, and want, and passion--well, that could just stay in his memories. Stay locked away in his heart, a secret thing that he only took out and examined only so very rarely. Like fine crystal used only for the most special occasions.
), not right now. Please go away.
"I'm ruthless," Nebula tells Tony later. "But not
Tony grunted. "Thanks to my uncanny ability to transport other people from underground cells to the DC at a drop of a hat?"
"It's nice," he repeated firmly, "and... and Christmas-like."
Looking away from the road, Tony glanced his way, but couldn't see anything in the darkness and fleeting shadows. Nevertheless he seemed to come to a conclusion and nodded to himself. "Yeah," he says. "I think I know what you mean." And, strangely enough, Steve sensed it was true.
right thing, anything that wasn’t a joke or an oversimplification or a cliché. He was careful not to say anything he wouldn’t say to, for example, Thor. No wonder nothing was working out.
So, Rogers was probably trying to be fair now too, but – Tony guessed – Fury's intervention on his behalf wasn't exactly helping. At best, Captain may be trying not to form opinions preemptively, and failing.
Tony:  she left a giant hole in my home, btw. the one you miss. and i don't mean metaphorical hole
were safe. Human mind was a piece of damnation. It tricked itself into believing in an illusion of safety in order not to go completely insane at the inconceivable expanse of the universe all around.
In the country, everything was easier. The pace of life was more what he was used to. It was possible to, say, trade a day of helping around the yard for a sloppy dye job in someone's sister's tiny hair salon. That way you could turn your hair and beard a more forgettable brown. In the country, it was also easier to do odd jobs here and there, in different villages, different farmsteads, and no one really asked for IDs or bank account numbers, especially – he figured – if you were tall and wholesome-looking (as he'd been told) and very, very polite. In the country, people would tell you to go help widow Kelley around the farm because she could be persuaded to give away some of the winter clothes left behind after the death of Old Red Kelley ten years ago; he'd been your size exactly, it's uncanny, ask anyone. In the country, there was peace, and you could feel useful while you struggled to find it.
Steve was standing to him. He himself was leaning against the wall to take the weight off his bad foot, and now Steve was there, in front of him, all big and looming. Warm and near. Something in Tony stirred, a tiny rebellious fire of
"He never left his rooms, ser Anthony. He never even opened the door. We would have noticed..."
Their eyes met for a moment. Steve thought: He's seen things too. Maybe he, too, has his own unimportant little dislikes, tiny nibbling reactions to things that aren't real. And that made him feel less alone.
Tony starts fucking him for real, then, hard, robustly, hitting his prostate on each go. Steve feels it build, like a wave that swallows another inch of the strand on each lap, reaching, reaching. And sometimes Tony twists his fingers together, and sometimes they are side by side; he moves and shifts them inside of Steve, all the while fucking him, and Steve is very aware of every additional stretch, of every spot of his inner wall that was previously left untouched, perhaps, but now is thoroughly rubbed and stretched and stimulated. His sweet spot sings with short bursts of white pleasure and pain whenever Tony slams into it. This is when Steve lets go. He's not aware of his arms, stretched painfully above his head. He has no idea where his legs are – it's like they are floating somewhere away, in the distance. All he knows are the sweet, agonizing explosions inside of him, and his cock, that seems thicker than ever, full to bursting, crying for a relief that isn't coming. He lets out a short, explosive breath from the bottom of his stomach every time Tony slams in, and all he can do is lie there, taking it, wanting it, chasing the sensation, but he can't, he can't come; it's almost there, but that makes this torture even worse because try as he might, Steve can't reach it.
His voice was steady. Like a bright red ribbon in the snow. You couldn't get lost with that voice showing you the way, and Tony just gave way to it. He was used to Steve giving instructions in that unshakable tone – go left, veer to the right, do the barrel roll. Like in the flight simulator. Easy.
, some things are deemed probable to cause panic. Even before that, when I worked for SHIELD, this was taken care of by a whole another department, which, in a government agency is a whole another country, practically.
Tony: Also, since we're talking about friends, I heard from Bruce.
"How did you tell him? Come on, Tony, it's not a difficult question
And it's
Tony: You're important to me too.
Still, it went beyond that apparently. He looked at Steve, really looked at him. Took in his spine, straight as an arrow, his tense shoulders, his apparently growing annoyance the more Tony questioned and poked. This went beyond Steve's usual stubbornness. This was something else, something deeper and a bit more foul, Tony felt. It stank of distrust.
He may have set The Game in motion, yes, but without two players it wouldn't have been a game. Rogers had been responsive. Rogers had not only
Steve had eyes only for him. Tony looked pudgy and young in a ratty old bathrobe, with an ancient pair of red sweatpants underneath. And regular knit woolly socks. There was something endearing about the picture, or there would be if Tony's eyes weren't as guarded, the muscles around his lips as tight.
Christmas Eve, and these things happened only to him. Couldn't he catch a break just for once?
Immediately, Tony started setting a new trap.
Yet another silence, that now stretched between them, was simply too much to bear.
, a traitorous voice in his head pointed out.
Tony: Maybe I'm being fucking vitriolic because this is the first time I'm hearing about the super-soldier serum, Steve!
"I don't doubt you did." Just like I'd wanted to get there before Tony did, during
Tony: IS that what you are thinking?
Tony: Steve?

drink?" Bruce asked skeptically, swirling the liquid in the metal cup.
Tony: Something dirty?
Tony: So what was your mission? Haven't got the wind of anything.
Tony: I think I just told you she was seeing someone else.
"I vaguely remember reading some articles of yours, back while civilization was still a thing," Tony said lightly, pretending not to see his surprised look. Then he poked him. "See?" he said. "Behavior. Plenty more behavior, where that came from."
The gathering was beginning to look sad. It was weird, Steve thought, inconsequentially, as he stepped into the ballroom. The crowd had made him feel uneasy and overwhelmed earlier; the throng of people, the multitude of sounds; with his super-hearing, he could hear feet scuffle and breaths whoosh, dozens of olives splashing around in the martinis, and a sea of indistinguishable words seeping and clanking together until they swallowed him whole, like quicksand. He
That's a bit weird, isn't it?"

Tony: I'm not even kidding
I shook my head. This Steve looked like some giant to me, some hero, not... myself. And at the same time, I remembered writing all those earlier entries. It had been me.
Tony: Which, btw, I sometimes do.

anything for me," I say. "I just wanted to see you."
He wasn't sure for how long they lay like that, intertwined on the narrow sofa. Steve's body was cold, but his breath on Tony's face was warm, and the fire was slowly turning the room into a sauna, and it had to be okay, Steve had to be okay, because Tony flat out refused to live in a world in which that wouldn't be the case.
? It must be some in-joke, some private teasing. To his well tuned ears, there were a few strands of something forced in the merriment, and he knew how to read that too: is the laughter at our expense? Are the superheroes mocking us? Is this funny or rude? (If the audience pretended it was funny, they didn't have to deal with rude.)
Tony: You don't have to reply or anything if it's making you anxious. Because it can make you anxious. I know. In any case, don't worry
"The real trouble," Steve admitted hesitantly, as if he was spilling a dark secret, "isn't that. Well, it is, which is why I'm so upset. But what made it so bad was the fact that
(When his father had found out Tony had stolen the photos, it hadn't been pretty.
When Tony is fucked up, he closes himself in. In his workshop, his ice fortress, completely alone, underground. For days.
"Er..." Steve hesitated. Shrugged. "Found them in the kitchen. They're fresh." He had no idea what to do with himself now that he was here.
They exchanged a few words only, all in all. In retrospect, Steve could barely remember what they'd talked about, apart from asking after each other's health. It felt like more than that, though. It almost felt like something you thought about right before you fell asleep, something you allowed yourself to bask in; and then, tomorrow you ordered yourself to
"F..." Steve began.
"I'd been so spectacularly depressed when you left," I said.
Without a second of hesitation, Tony threw off his clothes, leaving just the boxers on, and crawled under the blankets with Steve. He fit snugly into the space between him and the sofa cushions. Steve's skin was unnaturally cold, like no human skin should ever be; but then Steve turned around to the side and wrapped himself around Tony. Was it just instinct, going for a warm body? Or was he actually aware of what was going on? There was no way to know that. Tony threw an arm over him, trying to pull him closer, willing his warmth to enfold Steve like a cocoon.
. New plan."
Tony: You didn't find him a teensy bit impressive, though?
Tony: It's not a similar thing.
“Look. I should have guessed. About your coldness thing. Shouldn’t have dragged you here.”
Steve had the decency to laugh, the fiend. "She's always going to love you best, Tony," he said then, which somehow  made everything better, Tony was stunned to realize. "You're a wonderful Dad. I know you are. I can see it."
"No? No
Tony: Am I interrupting sexytimes?
"So that I can hold it?"
he regretted; he should have stuck with
splurge a bit, actually. You don't happen to have one of those honeymoon suites available, maybe? I know it's last minute and all, but I thought we'd ask."
It took them nine days.
Tony: Christ, Steve you have to tell me those things. I’m not best at reading cues. If you ever need me, just tell me. Even if we are at odds. Even if we're not speaking. I’ll come.
But Steve had started speaking exactly at the same time: "Why do you pretend you don't give a damn?" Steve turned his head, looked him straight in the eye, with a very earnest expression on his face.
Okay. We went to Madripoor because we had intel about a planned terrorist attack, by a rogue Hydra branch – or that was what we thought – during the tech expo.
This is it, I think. I wasn't sent here to comfort him. I was sent here to argue him back to his old self. No one can prickle him like I can. We've always had thin skin when it came to each other.
"I should watch it," Tony sighed.
Tony: You stalking me online?

Steve's face was worried, but Tony had the pain thing practically under control now. As long as he didn't put any weight on the foot. Clumsily, he struggled up to his knees. "Never better," he said.
Tony: And I'm wondering if you, you know, feel the effects of depression more intensely than an unenhanced person would. Your selective sensory enhancement and all that. What does it entail?
felt incredibly right. But Tony realized he didn't want Steve for just one night. The past Tony would think him insane for missing the opportunity, surely. But somehow, somehow, it didn't feel like enough now, almost like an one night stand would cheapen the whole experience. Tony wasn't going to do that, even though that was – when all's said and done – one of the hardest decisions ever, and he would probably regret the hell out of it later.
But he had no idea what to say to him and was now seriously escape as a possibility.
, Tony thought without much gusto, mostly pissed at himself. If nothing else, he'd forced the stupid impulses down and he could think clearly. He didn't do anything stupid either, for once.
The flesh is tender from the rubbing, responsive, but seeing the tresses fall and connect adds another dose of piquant excitement. The first strikes are so gentle they are barely there. Still, the buildup, the quivering anticipation and the rush of blood make him feel it more and more with every rhythmic tap. And then Toy snaps his wrist in a different way, and it's just the very tips of the flogger that connect with the skin. It feels like ten thousand bites, and the sting is so hot and intense he sucks in air sharply through his teeth.
Steve had a generous hole, and two fingers slid in pretty easily, lubing the way. Steve caught his breath, stiffened, relaxed. The small, unwilling jerk of his back twisted Tony's heart, and Tony whispered
"The shield." Tony grins to disperse his own serious thought. This is a night for happiness. "As soon as I find it."
! So he let himself giggle, hoping it would go away eventually.
Tony: I do know that.
Steve's heart flutters in his throat, but he gives Tony a look – direct, daring, unwavering – because if they are actually playing chicken, he sure as hell isn't going to be the one to back down.
"No, but it's really nice of you to ask. It's just... I don't like the cold so much."
Steve does. Feels on display, suddenly. It's a little mortifying, it's a lot thrilling.
"Wait," Steve said as a sudden inspiration for a change of topic hit fortuitously. "You're picking up young highlanders. I heard it on the grapevine. So where
Why now? Why was he spilling this now, to Steve, to Captain Fucking America? Because he'd been a part of it too, because he'd been there in a way, played his role in all of it? No, Tony thought, not really. Because he's... Steve, and because he cares even though he doesn't know me, and because he asked so sincerely.
Tony: Or is it still going on?
Tony: Come over, Cap.
"Can you brief me?" he asked her. She was a senior engineer and probably the most experienced one after Darryl.
Tony lifted his visor just to be able to arch a sarcastic eyebrow at Steve, then let it drop again. "Kings who sleepwalk themselves out of their own castles and into enemy hands aren't allowed to be sassy." Natasha wondered if the others had noticed the carefully concealed haunted look in Tony's eyes.
?" He sounded uncharacteristically winded.
"Thor's checked the grounds, I've checked the roofs and scanned the surroundings. The visibility is good today." His voice was clipped and efficient as always. "No trace of Steve. No one's seen him either."
" It was Steve's voice, echoing weirdly through the much emptier ballroom. Suddenly, the hall itself seemed huge and horrifying, with all the gold leaf and the expanse of floor between him and Steve, and the cleaning personnel now reproachfully drifting towards the center. In the background, a ballad was playing from the speakers.
Instead of answering the non-question, Tony asked: "Do you really think things would have been so vastly different if we'd been in the same place, at the same time when Thanos came?" If he didn't know better, Steve could have sworn Tony was talking to himself instead. Trying to convince himself.
New beginnings. As I said, they always hurt. I know a thing or two about new beginnings. Still, I thought, maybe this actually
He fell asleep four hours later, biting his own knuckles like crazy, but he gave him space.
Tony: Steve, buddy, you still there?
"So, you know about that." Tony snorted. "I wondered. Yeah, for two months. I expect you know how gloriously it ended."
"Soup? Really? You made me soup now?"
that eyes are a mirror of the soul, he thought, they are just an organ dammit, they don't tell you anything). He wanted Steve to not look away. He wanted Steve to show something, give him something, just a glimmer of hope. Just a hint that he felt anything, wanted anything from Tony that he didn't want from, say, Rhodey. Yes, they'd worked together marvelously during the war, and working beside Steve had felt like finding and old pair of jeans, and slipping them on, all soft from wear and years, and finding out they still fit so perfectly. And then... One night, after the fighting had been particularly bad, they'd gotten drunk – the two of them and Thor. And the later part of the evening was a bit of a blur for him, sliding uncontrollably into the blackout. He couldn't be sure now, but he thought they might have talked about the bad blood that was still there. No, they did talk about it, although Tony remembered the conversation in patches only – but those were important patches. They had patched up some of his heart quite nicely. There were even a few tears and some hugging, he thought, but that part he was mostly too embarrassed to think about.
Tony: I lose people
“Surfing. Do you surf?”
about him seemed a little dampened to me, coming to think of it, a bit quieter than what I was used to, with Tony. Was this the toll of the war or was he like that in this timeline, I wondered.
Tony: In a very non-sappy way.
he told himself, then, and kept it down.
Tony: You are not the first control freak in history.
it. He loved it far more than he should have, he thought. He'd stared at it for hours, knew every turn of the line by heart. Well, okay, maybe it was a form of self-torment, but he did what he needed to do, that was all. And every drawing, every sketch screamed at him with its unfulfilled potential. The fact that Steve might not get a chance to mature into his artistic potential now filled Tony with a rage so muted and frigid it could easily hold for years. Centuries. Self-sustainable anger. You never needed to renew it or recharge it, honest. It could just fuel you indefinitely. This was unforgivable. Someone was going to burn for it.
?" said Steve, a bit befuddled.
Tony: Because, frankly, it's rather insulting.
Just urgency and pressing need. As he heard Steve groan again, this time lower, hoarser, he felt his hand fill with wetness, and he let himself go too; the waves of bittersweet release passed too soon. He leaned his cheek against Steve's back as he came and for a moment he sobbed without tears. It was, he figured a bit later, probably just relief.
Steve tumbled from the board into the water, and Tony splashed some into his face by way of punishment, and in seconds it turned into a full-fledged splashing war. The surfboard drifted beside them, forgotten. They were just far enough from the shore that Steve couldn’t touch the bottom with his feet. And Steve didn’t put two and two together, not in time, or he’d forgotten for a second, but a second was enough; and, laughing ever so hard, he’d dunked Tony’s head under the surface.
By now all we're breathing is recycled farts and 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, which is basically body odor."
Tony let his hand wonder up Steve's back. It felt wonderful and the experience was spoiled only by the invasive presence of fabric. "I was

"The flight. Here? You didn't walk all the way to Norway, did you. The flight."
, but no, no, there was no time for that even if he wanted to go there, and it definitely wasn't a good idea.
, big guy," Tony coaxed him. "You need to pass the physical as well." Tony pretended to give  him a critical once-over, even though the blanket was in the way. "You're kind of flabby."
All of a sudden, Cap froze. Immobile as a pillar. Judging by his face, this was exactly where the blurring stopped and the lines became hard again. Oh well, if Tony didn't push at the boundaries, he wouldn't know where they were located. Rogers's lips had gone thin, and Tony could have sworn he'd blushed a bit, although he might still have been flushed from the run.
Not for
," Tony commands him, and Steve opens his eyes forcibly. Watches the tails caress his cock for a moment, making it twitch, strive to feel more than the tickling of leather. Then Tony raises the flogger again.
It took only a minute, it seemed later, although at that moment the time crawled. Steve ran through a few standard questions – the year, the location, the name – and found out Louis seemed well oriented and aware of his surroundings. He could stand up. A bit battered and bruised – with a sprained ankle, it seemed – but otherwise all right. He had – he admitted with a guilty grin – sneaked off into the storage closet to have a nap since there was nothing urgent to do on shift. Then the equipment started tumbling around, and the ceiling became the floor. He didn't know much beyond that.
because Steve didn't want to see him now, didn't want to hear his voice, to know, couldn't stand to look into his eyes (warm and beautiful and so expressive...
"Me," I say, my mouth suddenly dry even though all of it took place so ridiculously long ago, a lifetime ago. "You never forgave
something happening? It was impossible.
Other cupboards are no better. His face blooming red, Steve is staring at a collection of floggers and crops with what looks like utter fascination. He's clutching at the chest strap of his uniform with one hand. If Tony didn't know better, he'd almost think the blond man was turned on.
"Sort of, yes."
Tony: I'm guessing this was not the best thing to say, though?
Tony: I know you are not being patronizing on purpose, I know, I KNOW. Hell, Steve. I'm trying.
timeline's Tony would have traded his life for the possibility of Morgan growing up with her dad, back where I came from. Well, for better or worse, there's usually no one to bargain with. Universe consistently refuses to haggle.
, Tony thought.
Clint raised his eyebrows. "Is that some sort of a classical reference again? Cause I don't have your education and couldn't give a shit, really." He frowned. "Why, do you think they're banging?"
He kept looking for a barb in her words, but couldn't really find any, so in the end he shrugged, and grinned, and returned casualness for casualness like bullet for bullet.

"I think I'm all right," Louis was saying. He rubbed his temple, glanced at his hand; he frowned when he saw blood, then wiped it off on his cargo pants, absent-mindedly. "Where is everyone? What happened?"
Steve imagined Tony was reluctant to let go of him, if for a fleeting moment. But then it was all business, and ‘Laters, Cap’, through the voice filters of the suit. Steve
Now that he had a moment to look at it, Tony could say the dog was too large for a husky. It was probably a mixed breed. Despite its size, it definitely had a doggy build – broad hips, powerful shoulders, and it wasn't lithe like a wolf. Still, in the darkness and the blizzard it was an easy mistake to make. No, really, sprawled in front of Tony's fire the beast looked humongous;
"Crap. The wolf," Steve said. "Oh, crap."
Tony: Please don't comment.
"Try the latter and I will light you on fire," the furry guy says pleasantly. Tony gets a feeling they would get on splendidly if they got to know each other, but perhaps he's just in a charitable mood.
"It's not very good," Steve said truthfully. "Purifiers, I think. The wall sprinklers won't reach this far, and the ones on the ceiling are..."
Tony: I don't hate you.
Tony was riding on Steve's back, in an improvised harness made out of looted gun belts. This way they both had their hands free. Tony had a semi-automatic in each one, positioned over each of Steve's shoulders. Together, they were a clumsy moving fortress. Painstakingly slow, they advanced through the corridors of what seemed to be an old institute? Centre? Tony had no idea, but it was massive, and looked like something that might have been built right after the WWII. With this many levels below ground, Tony guessed it would have been some kind of a secret governmental institution or something just as ridiculous and sinister. Judging by the state it was in and the omnipresent graffiti, it had been derelict for a very long time, and at some point had been adopted by one counterculture movement or another. That was, he supposed, before it was turned into the illegal centre for torture of fugitive supersoldiers.
Aboard a ship of the gunstar class, pilots had their R&R and the marines had their own, on their deck. In the normal circumstances, however, techs were much fewer in numbers – just the necessary maintenance personnel. War changed this. Repairs planetside became fewer and farther between, and the number of staff grew by necessity. These numbers became further inflated after their impromptu fleet jumped over the Red Line and

"Yeah," Tony whispered back and leaned his cheek against Steve's shoulder.
"No, not
Tony: Oooh, bold.
"So, you live in a motel, eh?" Tony said, with an empty grin. "Lurid." It fell flat, and he hated himself intensely for saying anything.
He'd let it all go too far. That was the problem with The Game, a part of him mused idly, while the rest of his brain focused on breathing. When you try to play it, sometimes you fall into the trap yourself. You start paying attention to someone's reactions, aware of each tiny cue, each hitched breath or almost-touch, of every brush of hand against hand or word against word, and in the end it turns out you've only managed to play yourself.

Tony: Go, now. Shoo. Get ready. Have fun. You should have fun. Don't worry about me.
"You idiot," he said. "And

was the wrong question – it was not of the essence here.
Tony: Oh, I forgot to say.
But there, on the other side of the ballroom, there was a splash of vivid color and joy and pain. Surrounded with their friends, his fortress walls, Tony was laughing loudly, his face animated. He was telling a story; all the gazes were plastered on him. Somehow, he looked more unapproachable than ever.
Tony’s face twisted in comical disgust.  “Aww, Steve.  Gross.  I don’t want him knowing about our...
“I didn’t really do anything.”
