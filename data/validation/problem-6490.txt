Tony sits down on the edge of the bed handing him one of the cookies Jordie baked "Tell you what bud how about on that day you stay at the tower and work in the lab?"
Hello all! Man it's been a really long time since I've been back with this story. I'm still amazed of how popular it still is haha!
"Good question it's so that none of the inventions that are made here don't get stolen by rival companies."
Miss Erica turned to Peter apologizing multiple times before quickly leaving everyone laughing at her. Tony turns to Olivia "mind if I take over Olivia?" he asks
"Enough Peter, your lucky I haven't told the principle about this. Though I'll make sure you get some easy packets of work to have for the day we're on the field trip for you. Now please leave."
Peter looks down disappointed "okay ma'am." He leaves the classroom walking to his locker to gather his things and go meet happy outside the school. Then the locker was slammed shut "Hey Penny, I'm not surprised you weren't allowed on the field trip because of your 'internship' " flash mocked calling Peter by his dead name.
A few of the students give a gasp from those who still didn't believe that Peter's internship was real. "So anyone have any questions for Peter?" Tony says.
"Please feel free to look around but we only have 15 minutes until we go to lunch, so I advice you to stay close to this area so you won't get lost."
"It was alright. Nice to see you Olivia." he says as he walks past to the ID scanner though Peter didn't need a ID he entered with a finger scan. When scanned FRIDAY came on "Welcome back Peter, would you like me to inform Mr. Stark of your arrival?"
"That's the surprise part miss moon. Now each of you will be getting a permission slip that I want signed and brought into next week." She starts to put a paper on each student's desk except for Peter, he was confused at first but maybe the teacher just forgot to hand him one.
and I'm sorry for not speaking up about being bullied at school. I just thought I could fight my own personal fight without my mask."
*Claps hands together* So! I need you lovely readers help as I plan to write another chapter for this story over the weekend not to mention I'm sleep deprived because of my cat coming into my room in the middle of the night waking me up! But who needs sleep *shrugs*
The class watched as she did. When she sat him down Miss Erica snatched the bag of cookies out of this hand throwing them away "Now I don't want you to over until the field trip is over is that clear!"
Jordie smiles "Well I'm glad that you aren't going to be harassed and bullied anymore. I really had to hold Shadow back so she wouldn't eat them."
Lightly laughing Peter shakes his head "No, well... maybe a little bit if you consider the avengers being protective of you from a bully and abusive teacher." he shrugs the other two friends laugh along with him.
"Mr. Thompson! Please reframe yourself you know making fun of anyone in this class is forbidden." Miss Ava says sternly looking at the bully. Flash sinks down in his seat and gives a soft "Yes, miss Ava."
Peter shrugs "you can go sweetie but I want to just take things easy and work in my lab for a bit, plus I'm still sick and being around other people hasn't been helpful today."
When getting to the lab Shuri helped bandage Peter's arm, while Wade gave his baby boy comforting cuddles and kisses on his cheek. Having Peter blush with embarrassment it was enough to have his family embarrass him but his boyfriend now just raises the kill me now meter.
They started the walk out to Peter's lab going in everyone saw Peter sketching in his notebook. Peter felt the presence behind him turning around he gives a slight wave "um.. hi everyone, welcome to my lab I guess.."
Peter knew about the badges well coming in different levels and colors and for himself, Dad, Aunt Pepper, and the rest of the avengers used a finger scan since they're here most of the time. By the time he got out of his thoughts Olivia finished handing out the passes.
They started to walk together heading to the front of the school building "yeah it sucks, but hey at least if it's boring I'll miss out."
Everyone was taken to lunch most of the students were drooling over the food that they got from the cafeteria. About how good this looked better than the school lunch that they got, though Peter could really care less for this food it'd never beat his family's cooking.
Jordie puts a hand on Shadow's head "no Shadow we don't eat innocent people. Weather they believe someone or not." Shadow pouts "
Peter smiles putting his phone away though he knew his dads wouldn't like it if they knew Wade was coming. What would be the fun in telling them any away? he shrugs 'oh well' he thinks this can just be a little secret for now.
After some time passes the students who spared with the avengers lost against them. Peter had to admit though some were quite impressive they almost had them on the ground.
Jordie sets the soup on the desk next to Peter's bed "I decided to stop by and see how you were doing. Makayla wanted to come also she made a picture for you. Didn't you honey?" Makayla nods handing the picture to Peter "It's a picture of you as Spiderman giving me a ride on your back while swinging around the city."
When the bell rang everyone dashed out Peter stayed behind. Walking up to the teacher's desk "excuse me miss but how come I didn't get one?"
Peter sighs knowing that for the rest of the day he was going to get embarrassed more by his dad "Oh and get one of the janitors to clean his mess up Fri."
Peter places his head against hers "I love you to Makayla." placing her down going up to the counter "Do you have any snickerdoddles Jordie?"
"okay dad. Can it be after breakfast? I have yet to try one of uncle Clint's waffles." he grabs a plate taking three waffles from a big plate that was out to have the waffles on for the others to pick from.
"Yes something's wrong!" Ned buts in "Peter's sick I think he needs to go home." Miss Ava puts her hand on Peter's forehead feeling the warmth of his head she sighs a little upset that Peter didn't say anything about it the past three days. "Peter I'm sorry but Ned's right you need to be taken home, go down to the nurse's office we'll call someone to get you."
Once getting down to his lab Peter started to work on his web shooters to make a new fluid for them to make it to hold down more enemies in battle. He sniffs grabbing a tissue blowing his nose "man it's hard to work when you're sick." looking at the clock 9:30 am Jordie's bakery will be opened soon "wonder if she's got any snickerdoddles?" he questions.
Everyone the starts to scan their IDs passing threw Still in awe of what happened with Peter. When it was Flash's turn he gave a look to Peter that he was going to get it later and Miss Erica gave a dirty look to him going to the elevator.
Everyone stopped what they were doing once noticing that the class entered giving a few waves to them all. "Okay everyone please take a seat over on the bleachers  where miss Jordie and Makayla are so the avengers may show you how they train." Olivia announces leading the group over the bleachers.
Olivia clears her throat "alright everyone I think we should continue on with the tour now." She starts to move them along while a few other students had to push Miss Erica along as she was still stunned from getting threatened by Natasha.
"okay then." when Peter got to the elevator FRIDAY continued "up to the penthouse as usual Peter?" she asked
She gives a look at him like he did something wrong "Oh sorry mister Parker but you can't go because of how many absences you have."
"Oh sorry sweetie. Maybe when it's over Mr. Stark can have you back up in the penthouse." taking a basket from the table besides her Olivia started to explain the ID badges "Alright guys, these are your security badges for today you must wear them for the day and have the visible or else you will be kicked out. Our head security isn't that
"Cheers!!!" everyone says clinking their glasses together. Then enjoying the rest of their dinner and doing whatever else for the night.
Peter didn't really care and started to walk off to look at the exhibits of his aunts and uncles. Before hearing Olivia finishing up "Please only take pictures, don't touch anything or if an avenger may come on this floor respect their space unless they say it's okay."
Makayla looks up from crying and hugs him "Petey!" as she continues to cry into his shoulder. Peter rubs her head "shh. shh. Don't worry it's okay Kay. Morgan do you know what's going on?"
Later that evening, while eating dinner Peter decided to make an announcement "Umm... I'd like to say thank you to all of you..
" before wrapping herself around Jordie's neck in the shape of a necklace with her eyes sticking out.
"Don't be mean to Peter! He's nicer than you'll ever be! My mommy and daddy can do mean things to you if you don't!" she continues.
Well goodbye Peter's field trip I'll see you again in the future. I hope to try and recover from these thoughts and write a better chapter for you :).
"Well now your banned and if you'll return you will be the most popular guy with security. Stark industries does not tolerate bullying what so ever" Steve says sternly.
Sneakily Peter gets into the group of students while Olivia was looking around the students and she saw him "oh hey Peter! I thought you weren't going to school today?" Everyone turns looking at Peter, while he looked down at the floor not wanting to make eye contact though he gives a nod "s-sorry Olivia I didn't know they were coming here.."
Peter looks up at Clint "Thank you for the soup uncle clint. I'll eat it right away." Clint gives a thumbs up before patting Peter's shoulder before leaving. Pulling the desk close to his bed Peter took the spoon next to the bowl and starts to eat the chicken soup.
She cracks her knuckles going up to Flash "hey Flash!" taking him by the collar "Remember when I said I can kick your butt? Well I meant it!" she readies her fist about to punch him before feeling warmth on the top of her hand looking up seeing Erica with an angry look.
Peter coughs having some students give him a look and start to move out of the way. He groans really hating this cold "it's a good thing that she's on the avenger's side." going over to his exhibit it showed his first Spiderman suite that he made himself Ned squeals with excited "dude this is so cool! I can't believe you got an exhibit here! I can't get over that you're afraid of spiders when your Spiderman" he whispers. Peter rubs the back of his neck blushing from embarrassment "it's not all that great.."
Everyone gives a laugh before Wade brings up "So how's your field trip going Petey-pie? Besides that cut on your arm."
"I still promise when I'm better we'll play whatever you want!" he gives her a big squeeze having her laugh. "I love you Peter."
Liz chuckles ruffling his hair "That's good they've been keeping a good eye on you. Second Pepper told us to make up for what happened with your bullies, that maybe some autographs would help lighten the mood before you guys go."
Nat: why not he hurt you and the teacher seems like she's on his side. I wouldn't mind kicking her ass to.
"Mr. Leeds, Mr. Parker what's going on?" the teacher asked coming up to them she was much nicer than the other one with the field trip and was concern for her students.
The students around them start to laugh at the situation MJ smirks "oh yelled at by a five and four year old." Miss Erica was very embarrassed "what gives you two the right to say that to me!"
Wiping his face Flash smirks "to bad because I really ant to hurt you!" he says throwing a punch at Peter who dodged it that didn't stop Flash though as he continued to throw more punches at Peter who kept dodging the attacks.
Author needs help figuring out for the next chapter has three things planned but needs readers help.
The class soon came to the training area since Tony was now in charge of the tour they could go to higher rank levels such as this. Upon entering Peter could see the avengers who were there he saw Natasha, pops, Clint, Bucky and Jordie who was sitting with Makayla on one of the bleachers to make sure she wouldn't get hurt. Thanks to Peter's sight he could see one of Shadow's tendrils wrapped around the little girl protectively.
Goodbye my lovely readers of this story. Even though I made a terrible mistake I hope you will stick around for my other stories and possibly this one for when I come back to it.
Anyway this is a very important Authors Note so please don't skip it. I've decided to discontinue this story, hold on put the pitch forks and torches first and let me explain. The reason is that I'm thinking of possibly rewriting the story, I don't know when but it'll come to me and I'll start writing it done the line.
"It's nothing.. just ran into something." Peter replies trying to hide his eye from the other students. MJ gives him a 'really?' look "Peter I'm not stupid. Was it Flash again?"
"It was alright Мать Паук, hi Clint" Peter waves. Natasha finally got Clint's arm on the table losing the wrestle. Clint starts to sign to Peter 'you don't look very happy about an alright day of school'
Sitting down with Ned and MJ who already got their food Peter took out the cough medicine Clint gave to him. Ned turned to him swallowing the food he had in his mouth "you not eating Peter?"
Clint then started to sign while Jordie translated for him "When we're done with that you guys can spar with each other and maybe we might decide you could be the next avenger." hearing that everyone started to mumble that they could possibly be a next avenger. Peter knew that it wasn't true as it takes more than just strength to become an avenger.
That's basically it. I need you guys to choose these three options just comment with A, B, or C and if you'd like to explain why that's completely up to you. I don't care.
Nat and Clint both waved to all the students and taking a few pictures if asked as the made their way over to Peter "hey my маленький паук! Клинт видел, что с тобой случилось в лабораториях, ты можешь указать, что Флэш, детка? " Natasha says in Russian the other students not understanding a word she says.
Jordie makes a small giggle "So do you know when my sister and T'Challa will be getting here to see us?"
Clint signs to him 'If they keep it up by the time you get to the training room I'll send one of my tranquilizer arrows at them' before handing Peter some cough drops to take at lunch.
"That's stupid! I can't believe your teachers are that dumb. I'll call Tony maybe he can figure something out for you."
Tony speaks up "So that fight was to stay silent about it and hope you get lucky? Though you know we're always there to help you no matter what the hell it is."
" she called Peter tensed up a bit so did Makayla when she heard it, though he had to give it to Shadow she still had yet to understand how human illness works.
After everyone got their questions answered it was now time to get on the bus and go back to school. Once getting down to the lobby almost all the avengers that were met today were down there including T'Challa and Jordie's sister Elizabeth.
It was the week of the field trip and through out said week Peter was not feeling well. He knew that he was sick but didn't want to have anymore absences for school, In class Peter had his head down from a headache. "Peter you don't look so well, are you alright?" Ned asked taking a seat next to his friend.
that Tony couldn't find it in himself to stop it. He didn't know how long they were kissing for – time surely had to be passing, but Tony couldn't wrap his mind around that concept, not when his brain was chanting Steve's name, over and over. Tony might have been
"So have you figured out what to get Pepper yet for Christmas?" Tony asked, mainly so he could settle back and just listen for a while. Talking fellow businessmen out of their cash was something Tony was good at, but even he tired of the sound of his own voice after a few hours of it.
to return to his daily normal life, fighting villains with the Avengers, fighting villains who infiltrated his factories, fighting villains in the street on his own, but he carried Steve and Sarah around with him as a constant ache.
Happy nodded thoughtfully. He was one of the few people who knew Captain America's real identity; it had been impossible to avoid him knowing. Happy dropped Tony off here too often for him to have missed it. Steve had introduced himself the third time he'd met Happy, half in uniform, and Happy had admirably barely tripped over his own feet in his excitement. "Well, you live with him," Happy said, slowly. "Don't you know him better by now?"
Even as Van Dyne started to use healing charms on Tony, enough to keep his body intact until they could safely move him to the infirmary, Tony was conscious enough to be looking at Steve.
any more of my help, but I've been scanning my last set of data, there's a lag in his right-flank servos I wanna work out. If I can figure out the problem, I'm hoping he'll see sense and let me re-install them."
Steve turned on his heel and stared. There was a whole town behind him. It looked like a movie set. Steve was already half-expecting Clint Eastwood to stride out of one of the wooden buildings, a gun on his hip, a golden star glinting on his chest.
Tony rolls over with a questioning expression that melts when he sees the panic on Steve's face. Steve shakes his head furiously because pity isn't what he needs, the panic is still whiting out the edges of his vision, he can't do this alone, he can't—
Despite the 0.5% of doubt, Tony was braced to see Steve standing there in the doorway, blinking in confusion that Tony was there. And he was. Steve looked exhausted. He was frowning slightly. There were bags under his eyes. Tony was expecting that; if Steve was dying, he
tried to kill us,″ Tony corrected, pedantry too ingrained in his nature for him not to argue that point. ″The building
Steve found himself nodding numbly, shocked by the magic that he'd unleashed, that his anger could have done this, manifested into something that
McCoy pulls a face as he bats Steve's arm away and kicks back easily to a standing position. "Yeah, sorry. It's just—distracting."
There's a quiet knock on his bedroom door and Steve makes a noise, soft, like he's been wounded, when he opens it to see Tony. Tony's in a bright red t-shirt, blue sweatpants, a riot of color, and his breath smells like mint when he flings himself at Steve; when Steve slides his fingers into Tony's hair, it's wet and silky. Tony's clothes are different and he's cleaner and they're in a different environment now, but as Tony presses their mouths together, Steve realizes that's the only change. Their kissing is exactly the same as it was in the room, questions and answers:
Steve lifted the crate down easily and Tony tried not to stew over that fact; he levied his dismay at his overactive imagination by bossing Steve around, directing him where to put that crate, and which decoration to start with first. Out in the bigger room, with space between them, reality was easier to grasp onto.
to be closing in on them now. Steve felt a brief rush of anticipation as they headed on to the next floor. This might be a horrendous piece of architecture with no redeemable visual design attributes to its credit, but it did make for a perfect bottleneck.
The limo seemed a glamorous enough escape for Santa Claus to plausibly make, and Tony left the hospital with a rushed promise to have the suit dry-cleaned and sent back to the hospital as soon as possible. When Happy could barely conceal his smirk when he looked at Tony in the rearview mirror, Tony refrained himself from firing Happy by consoling himself with just how happy the kids were to see him.
Steve could have been more strategic about this, but he doesn't care; Tony is warm and beneath him, urging him on with his heels, murmuring praise under his breath. They're both covered in produce, fruit pulping beneath their bodies, powder exploding into Tony's hair, giving him the silver-fox look he dyes to avoid. Tony's laughing as he comes, and then they're kissing as Steve pulls out and spills over Tony's stomach, and it's probably a
"Are you okay?" Steve asked. "Your secret identity was important to you. You just inadvertently had a boundary violated. How are you feeling about that?"
"—celebrate them with you?" Tony guessed, his heart thumping. Steve was kind of nuts if he thought that his words had been remotely clear, but Tony couldn't blame him; clear thoughts were difficult right now.
Tony had to hide his laugh in Steve's neck for a moment; his body shook under Steve's hand, so it wasn't hidden so much as muffled. When he raised his face, Steve still looked confused. Tony considered the answer. He hadn't known what to get Steve. Could he just explain that it was Happy's suggestion?
"Careful, boy," a deep voice said; there was something friendly in the man's voice, but Steve still scrambled quickly to his feet, even though the movement made his head swim. "You took a big tumble there."
a small voice asks in his head, but Steve shushes that voice away. Now is for marveling at the amazing technology that makes up the Invincible Iron Man. Getting a peek behind that miraculous curtain.
"What are we doing?" Tony asked, after kissing his way along Steve's perfect jawline, and then hungrily claiming Steve's lips again with his own.
"I think I ate my weight in pastries," McCoy sighs during a sparring break, rubbing at his furry belly in memory. "Do you think Mr. Stark would let me know where his caterers got them, Shellhead?"
has been revealed!" Breathing had been hard enough before, but now Steve felt like one of the pillars had fallen on his chest, too; pushing down, squeezing him in a cold, awful, strangling embrace. "I know we’ll maybe get out of here, but... we have to be realistic, there’s a risk we might not."
Steve tugs Iron Man further into the dancing throng. Iron Man's arms link around Steve's neck as they swing around quickly to avoid Gamelin; Steve's other hand moves so he's gripping Iron Man's waist. Steve's dizzy and it's not just the dancing to blame. It's the heady feeling of Iron Man here, in his arms. Iron Man's the closest thing to a best friend that Steve has in this decade, as strange as that seems; Steve's spent hours enjoying his company both on the battlefield and off. Steve's heart is pounding.
"But I'm not changing her surname to Stark," Steve said, as he pulled back. Dammit, there was that uncanny predicting again.
Steve smiles, pleased. Tony Stark has to attend an awful lot of these events, so it stands to reason that as his bodyguard, Iron Man would have to as well. Now they know the armor folds down so small it makes more sense; in an emergency Iron Man can find a quiet corner and rapidly emerge as an invincible hero.
So it's just Iron Man, Carol, and Jan left to find. Steve's eyes eagerly sweep the crowd. Of course, Tony Stark should be here too, so he mentally adds him to the list. It's like
Steve to keep kissing him. Or to not stop kissing him, because Tony's surge of bravery had unlocked the thing simmering between them; it had knocked the whole dam down and they were both drowning in each other.
"Oh, logic," Tony said dismissively, but picked up the empty tinsel crate to indulge Steve's preference for keeping a tidy workplace.
Tony had come all this way without a New Home gift. Maybe some baby-proofing bits and pieces would be more appreciated than a bunch of flowers.
wardrobe at the same age and it's the whole world that's changed, decades that will have slipped away without us around to see them."
His overactive imagination was clearly still malfunctioning, because just for a second, Steve's frown seemed almost like disappointment again.
me. And I was pretty sure you wouldn't really be thinking about what that meant, for Iron Man, and your company, and I didn't want you to have to compromise yourself like that, or regret it. I couldn't bear the idea of
"Maybe a good night's sleep would help," Steve says, glad to be able to settle into the rhythm of an old argument.
Steve's raised voice had woken Sarah. Steve's expression turned sour. "Great. Now look at what you've done. You've woken her up."
This kiss was a lot better than the one in the parking structure had been. This one was warm and nothing about it hurt. Steve felt dizzy again, but this was a different kind of delirium. Tony’s mustache scratched against his skin, his hands moved to Steve’s waist, and Steve unhurriedly continued the kiss; lazy and slow and so damn
Steve manages to continue to convince himself that Tony is better off without him for pretty much the full length of the ball. He's busy a lot of the time anyway, helping to convince the wealthy guests to open their wallets a third time, but eventually even he has to admit to himself he's forcing himself to stay occupied so that he doesn't spend the whole thing staring longingly in Tony's direction.
"Uh," Tony says, frantically scanning his HUD readouts for more information; damn these wily Villains for Hire; they've gotten infinitely better at hiding since their last skirmish, "what?"
feel the shadows pushing down on his spine. He has a headache. The light is too much. The dark is worse. Tony never used to know how to handle Steve in a mood, besides giving him things to destroy, but now Tony just fucks him through it. Lets Steve ramble out all of the things he's worried about, while Steve's body slowly heats to meet the crescendo Tony's tipping him towards, one thrust or stroke at a time.
"I suppose it's the same for you," Steve says. He has both of his hands on Iron Man's waist and he can feel warmth coming from his body and it's so odd. He knows there's a person inside the armor, but sometimes it's different to know something and
"I don't know what to do anymore." Steve shook his head, staring down at Tony's body. "Why won't you wake up?"
Steve, more distracted than he should be by the topic, realizes they're wasting time, and Iron Man's shuffling like he's embarrassed by the attention. Steve swoops in to rescue him before they make Iron Man more uncomfortable than he already is.
"But you love it there," Tony blurted out, cursing his own lack of subtlety. It was a well-known fact to everyone that Steve didn't really deal well with discussions that covered emotions or feelings. Oh, he could do it at a passable level, if you distracted him well beforehand, or he'd just spent four hours on a battlefield and had no energy left to keep up the wall around his emotions. But a Steve like this, days from their last skirmish, relaxed by this apparent rare respite from imminent disaster...Tony was playing with fire, really. He held his breath. His words were just as likely to send Steve running as get him an actual response. Tony braced himself for Steve to put down the figurine and mutter about needing to sleep after all.
Well, that figured. There's no way Tony could have expected him to stay there forever. Still, it stung a little, that he was gone.
Steve was riled up with it. Everyone was tense; the Dark Lord Thanos was gearing up to declare war, they said. Tony should be focused on
As Steve retrieved his shield from where it had gotten embedded in a wall (maybe Strange had a point about the amount of damage they'd caused), Tony caught sight of an opportunistic media crew still recording the skirmish. He wandered over, lifting his faceplate and grinning charmingly, never shy of a good media encounter.
"Not yet." Tony returned his attention to the tree, holding the device over the next set of branches and carefully moving it along. The light stayed green. "Doesn't mean there isn't one."
Steve nods and Tony takes one last look before dipping back inside the ballroom. Steve counts to ten, hopes that's enough time, and follows.
It felt like someone was throwing stones at the inside of his school. His body was aching all over. Pain. Huh. Hunger, too, Tony thought. Damn. Why had he wanted to be awake and back in his own body, again?"
Steve stared at him, his own heart rate lurching upward in pace, more out of stress than from his own substantial injury. "He’s your
Sarah started to cry, breaking Tony's chain of thought, and Steve's concentration. It was probably for the best.
Despite how much he hates the place, Steve takes one look at the pink room, taking in every detail. It's been a jail, but it's also given him Tony. It's worth remembering for that.
Steve would like to say he knew exactly what had happened, but life as an Avengers wasn’t neat and tidy like that. Sometimes it asked you to complete a jigsaw puzzle without the picture to use as a guide and with several key pieces missing. He was used to recreating clues and timelines on the fly, and that was what he was having to do now, very quickly, because the world as it was didn’t make any sense.
“I’m sorry” he muttered. Tony shook his head and cuddled into Steve’s hair, breathing in the Irish spring scent.
It wasn’t the first mission he had been on since waking up. More like his twelfth or fifteenth, he sort of lost count. It was below twenty though. Natasha had recruited him after realizing that he was beginning to draw the same rock for the eighth hundred time. Now Steve didn’t expect for the constant rain cloud looming over his head to finally disappear when he stepped onto the field, but when it didn’t happen, he had to admit he was…really disappointed.
They had decided on Anthony Edward for some reason. Edward because it sounded like Edwin without it being like Edwin, and Anthony because. Well.
“Did you at least use protection?” She said, lazily eyeing the newspaper now, allowing Steve to squirm and glow as bright as a red traffic light.
He took the bike out immediately, forgetting all his other presents. He remembers fondly how he was wearing his cow jump over the moon PJ top and some flowy shorts and purple glittery doc martens. Him and style, man.
Steve ended up getting an emotional support cat. One day, Natasha knocked on his door and was holding a cat. When Steve continued to stare and didn’t sneeze she handed the cat over and put some cat toys, bed, and food into his entryway.
Tony had woken up to an empty bed, which never happened, and had learned that Steve went out for a morning run. “He always did” apparently. Tony made his way to the garage were him and Yinsen usually worked and began to tinker. His robots rolled around him, looking for things to do, and he drowned himself in whatever he could get his hands on.
Laying there in the hospital for days and days not saying a word. Headphones on his head with the music blaring loud. Steve remembers curling next to him after Tony offered another pair, and together they listened to almost everything.
Steve was still standing outside where the car was parked on the other side of the street, but he swore that little water droplets were sprinkled on top of the young man’s eyelashes making them sparkle.
Steve didn’t know how the young man could look both startled and calm and collected at the same time. He looked over at him, still swinging, a puzzled look on his face.
Anyway, here he was, going through the motions like he always did. Fighting and punching bad guys trying to access data they weren’t supposed to have. Days blended together, then weeks. Then suddenly it was  New Year's Eve and Steve knocked some racist fuckers teeth out as it hit midnight. When Clint suggested celebrating Steve politely declined and stayed in his room for three weeks.
“Sometimes we don’t know why Tones. Sometimes things are because they are. Not everything has to have an answer or a reason, love.”
“What Natasha?!” Steve stood at his full height, shoulders back, back completely straight. His voice was loud and strong and although his face was still beet red he didn’t look like the stumbling boy from two seconds ago.
“Tony, I don’t think we need to worry about that. Because I don’t know if I will ever stop loving you.”
To his surprise, Steve did not look at him with shock or start a fight or even denied him. He continued to stare at the file almost relieved and after another while, silently closed it.
That’s what Steve kept telling him during the hospital stay. How incredible he was, how amazing and strong and how much he loved him. He didn’t stop until Tony told him to shut up and asked for his cassette player and some headphones.
“Steve?…” Tony tried. He could feel his lips drying from the cheap lipstick he used earlier. Should’ve gone for a better brand. He licked his lips and watched the ex-soldier’s shoulders tremble. Maybe he should’ve gone bare face instead of his usual makeup. That usually threw some people for the loop.
They ended up both crying on the floor of the living room declaring their love for each other, idiots, and kissed heatingly.
When Tony suggested it though and showed up with two pairs of roller skates, he couldn’t resist. He always thought it was so cool to look at the guys on the magazines, looking like they were flying with their hands out to balance.
But still after Thor and Loki, and meeting the Hulk, and creating the team, Tony and Steve decide to go out on a date. Something not too serious, not like a fancy dinner. Something like old times. Tony had suggested roller skating. Roller Skating around the neighborhood together, like they used to.
And asked why. Why do some things happen? And somethings don’t? And why do some things fall into place?
Steve spent his first month awake in SHEILDS solitude. He was fed bland food and drank water. He slept hoping it was a dream.
The first outing wasn’t that awkward. Everyone assumed he was probably “slow” (which is what the old lady behind the counter whispered to another). Nobody corrected them, and at least they were extra nice to him when he went out by himself the first couple of times.
Because did it? Did everything actually have a reason for it to happen? Did things go and make sense in the end? Because this did not make sense. This sucked. This hurt. This was betrayal and sadness and cold and lonely and if Furn wasn’t there letting him hold him tight as Steve cried silently into his fur he would’ve…who knows. He doesn’t want to think about it.
He would be their bodyguard for a week or two. Get as much info as possible. Punch whoever the fuck was following them around.
“Bout you” Tony answered back matching Steve’s accent. It was cute, how he went all Brooklyn on him. And only him.
It was summertime and he was still watching Tony. He still had a small gun behind his belt loop and a pocket knife in his pocket wherever he went. And that entire summer they would get on bikes or rollerblade to the nearest store, or even take the bus across town to catch a weird movie. And every time Steve would always be so careful with him. Always so overprotective. And if asked, he would say that, yes, it was for the job, but honestly. He just loved protecting Tony. He’d be a hero for him.
Tony didn’t know what to do and stayed still, still looking at the poster. He felt Steve lean his head on his shoulder.
He liked the idea that he protected Tony. Even if his “bodyguard” assignment was an undercover mission at first, he still liked the fact that he was the first person Tony would run to in case of a threat, and that he had the power to stop said threat. Sometimes he’d imagine himself protecting him in different scenarios. Like if he was walking back to his car in a garage from shopping at the mall. And he’d be in his white tank and loose jeans stained with grease and oil but still looking amazing with that makeup of his and the bizarre shoes. And some lonely old creep would get him.
Let it be said, that Steve really had no idea that you could absolutely fall head over heals dumb fuck in love with someone in just a week and then want to marry them the second.
Steve didn’t go crazy when he was first given money. He didn’t know what to do with it. He never had money before. He slowly got comfortable though.
That evening Nick stopped by the debriefing room where Steve had resided. A cup of coffee on the table untouched and a sketchbook in his lap. Steve sat with his feet on the table boots off near his chair. His body seemed relaxed. But Nick could see the tension in his neck. The hard stare in his eyes.
You know i'm pretty sure your 'guest suite' is bigger than my house. It is really nice, though is everything in here a robot? Aunt May isn't really great with technology, so there is a chance she may set the place on fire by accident...
I don't know what to do next. My son is missing, I have no leads, and the smartest woman I know is refusing to wake up! Any ideas appreciated here, Jarvis. I'm sorry I can't come back to the mansion, but that's the first place the authorities will look for me, and I can't look after her and search for James. Besides, there's no-one I trust more to keep her safe while she's out cold than you. You and the six million space-age defences she's probably built into the walls. They would never have got to James if she hadn't gone to them.
It'll be okay. I'm fine here, just a little bored if anything. I've spent plenty of time in cells over the years but I'm not sure what you're supposed to do with yourself if you're not planning an escape... which I'm not. I need to see this through.
And I did talk to Wanda about Steve. And she told me he is looking into moving out to Washington with them to train up a new team of Avengers, which he has not mentioned to me at all. So yeah, remind me not to listen to you.
Yeah, seeing Loki as Cap was SO WEIRD. I haven't made out with Steve in a week. I can't help wondering if he (she? What is he right now?) has done it before and then I get like super grossed out. Eww.
I'm not sure how long that cradle is meant to take, but if Wanda is still sitting by her brother's bed side after I go, you either need to make her go to sleep or give her more coffee. She takes it black.

To be honest, I'm not actually sure what her opinion on the whole act actually is. It was Reed who approached me bout lending a hand. I imagine she is on board though since he offered 'The Fantastic Four's' assistance, not just his own.
What is it with you and letting people scribble all over your letters? We need to go back to e-mail and then Pietro won't come in and be a dick and read your private mail. What was he even doing at your house? I knew you and Wanda are like BFF, but I didn't know Cosmo there came into it.
Do I need to put a five-foot rule between you and Steve? He’s so sweet and innocent I’ll have to protect him from your wily advances. I will bite you.

The week-long trial of Steven Rogers, aka Captain America, has come to an end. An unnamed federal judge, kept anonymous due to security concerns, has sentenced Rogers- now known legally as Steven Stark- to 25 years behind bars. See below for a summary of the charges, Rogers' plea, and the result.
No more e-mail. Line is no longer secure. Rhodes is bringing this note over to you, but other than that, it’ll have to wait until we’re home. You’ll be fine.
It's been too long. They must have a plan beyond just taking him, what they were going to do once they had him, and they must be onto that step by now. It doesn't bear thinking about.
A widely-shared Facebook post has summed up Rogers' position: 'Crimes against women covered up for decades... leaving his wife and young son... opposing the democratic decision of the voting public... U-turning on justice. #notmycaptain #confesscap'. '#notmycaptain' is the slogan of a recently-launched social media campaign to have Steve Rogers replaced. The members of 'Not My Captain' argue that the virtues that the Captain America uniform is supposed to represent- Justice, Freedom and Democracy- have all been flaunted by Rogers, and can only be redeemed by passing the title and mantle to someone more worthy. Chief among the successors suggested by the campaigners is Carol Danvers, aka. Captain Marvel, who has taken the lead on tracking down and arresting non-registered superhumans since Natasha Stark's withdrawal from the public eye. Danvers had this to say:
As the SHRA war continues, who isn't sick of seeing headline after headline of bust-up after bust-up? Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like Captain America and his anti-registration rebels are planning on backing down any time soon, as they continue to show the world what a sore loser looks like.
You are really paranoid do you know that? If Loki was planning anything else he would have done it at the the Prom. And Mr Osbourne? He wants to ruin your reputation right? I'm not sure how attacking me would accomplish that. Anyway he probably figures I'm still at the Prom along with his Son, so I doubt he is about to make a move that would endanger Harry as well.
Don't think I don't feel guilty. I feel awful about what this is doing to you and I miss you so much. But this act is wrong, it's dangerous, and I couldn't live with myself if I didn't try to stop it.
Apologies to everyone who commented last time who has only just gotten a response- a manic week + a stinking cold = WikketKrikket being remiss. Hopefully I will do better this week, so feel free to comment, we love to hear from you! :D
(Cap tells me Shield is looking into it, though. I’m just not allowed to join in because apparently I’m ‘biased’.)
I hope I didn't get you in too much trouble...Fury seemed pretty mad that you sneaked Loki in. If it helps, I'm feeling much better and the latest tests didn't show any signs of Venom.
In a shocking turn of events, Steven Rogers, aka Captain America, has today turned himself in to the authorities. It is believed that this is a direct result of the death of hero Goliath earlier this week. In a pre-prepared statement released to the press shortly before his surrender, Rogers had this to say:
I hate it. It is too small and too...normal. There is barely room for my Lab! I'm having to have it put in the basement >:(
And we may have gone to see a movie together once, but in my defence Mary Jane and Gwen were meant to come too, they just never showed....
But don't worry, I'm going to fix you. I know someone who thinks they can help. Everything is going to be fine.
Well I am throwing up a lot, but that is normal at this stage. Apparently the soup is good for me and the baby, helps it grow up strong or something. Personally I'm not sold on the science, but it tastes good so I'll eat it.
It seems Steve thought I was mad about you dating a man as well, because he came to see me and talk about it. Don't worry, I cleared it up and told him I wasn't mad at you because of that, which seemed to calm him down. Then he offered to hit you, but I said it was okay, though I'll keep the offer in mind :P
Don't underestimate Sin, she won't work logically. We might be better off chasing down whoever she got to hypnotise you. Be careful though, Nattie. The mine was obviously a trap but we still don't know what triggered the cave in and it could have been that they used you. And, depending on how it works, if they can read your mind or not, they might well know I'm alive and what you are doing to try and find James.
You know all the guys think you are awesome right? You just aren't as popular with the girls because well...you are literally old enough to be their fathers. :P
He told me that he went to try and recapture Osbourne, after he found me unconscious and the cell empty, but he had a lot of trouble finding him and didn't want to come back empty handed. When he finally did catch up with Osbourne, he was in the middle of kidnapping me and the twins and had way too much fire power for Loki to take him down alone, so instead of fighting him he followed him, thinking he'd work out a way to save me once Osbourne's guard was down. However when he got to Osbourne's hideout, he realised there was way to much security for him to get me out, and since Harry had betrayed me earlier, he thought he was owed some payback and knocked him out to trade with Osbourne.
That said, I think we have a few things we need to talk about before we get back to normal. A lot has happened the past few months, and I don't think we can just sweep it all under the carpet. We'll both need a bit of time.
I'm going through all the records Shield has on old Hydra bases. If this bitch is Red Skull's daughter, than maybe she is holed up in one.
his way out of a maximum security cell, disabling- but not doing any permanent damage to- over 60 guards and members of security staff.
If your guys want to come, let them. I stand up and take responsibility for my actions, even if that means getting the crap kicked out of me. I'm not running around hiding under a fake name and a mask. I can't just disappear when my actions get someone hurt, I face the consequences
You know shiled agents are privy to a lot of secret information, and I haven't heard about any of them letting spill in a bar, have you? We got this under control Cap, I don't have anyone involved I don't think I can trust.
I know you probably thought I wouldn’t write again after that stunt you pulled today, but I will because I’m pissed. What part of ‘Loki is dangerous and killed people’ do you not understand? I didn’t think any kid of mine could be so terminally stupid. Thor’s fallen for his ‘I’m a new Loki’ act hook line and sinker, but you don’t have to! Even if you believe this reincarnation bull, Thor said himself they usually remember their previous lives.
I've sent you some flowers, see if you can keep them alive until I get home. Remember that in every 24 hours you need to sleep for 7-8, eat at least twice and drink as much water as you can. Stay safe and be careful while I'm gone.
Two, you shouldn’t EVER trust Loki. EVER. Let alone run off with him in the middle of the night. That said, you rescued a load of kids, so, well, kudos for that. But you’re still in trouble! And you’re repairing the shutters yourself.
So it sounds like you had it half under control most of the time. You didn't kill anyone, but you did beat the crap out of like three different criminals you went after. Two of them are okay, one of them is still in the hospital.
NATASHA: No, you'd rather he grow up in a world where he could be blown up in the middle of school! The way things were before...it wasn't working. We need to try something new.
I'm refusing to register. Or, at least, I'm planning to refuse. I'm so firmly convinced that it's wrong... but it's hard. Being away from you both. I don't know how much longer I can stand firm. Although, in light of everything else, whether I register or not might not have much influence on the outcome any more anyway.
I haven't got as far as name yet, I mean we don't even know what sex it is going to be. You know we can find that out before it is born now right? It won't be until I'm 20 weeks, but we are totally finding out.
Why did you tell Jarvis to wait 24 hours before alerting me that James was missing? Have I lost your trust so completely you don't even trust me with him?
Honestly, me giving Pepper the company wasn’t really part of the break up. I was pretty sick at the time, kind of in a bad place, and I felt terrible about what I’d done to her. It seemed like a good way to thank her. A multi-billion dollar company is a good gift, right? She’s a better CEO then I ever was, anyway. Much more business-like. And I just can’t pull off high heels.
P.S Too late....I didn't really think Captain America swore so much...though I guess he was in the army and soldiers aren't really known for restrained language. He seemed a little embarrassed after, but it was pretty funny. I've never heard anyone call Donkey Kong a 'Blue shell throwing Son of a bitch!' before XD
And he wasn’t saying that he INSTANTLY fell in love with this young man, but God did he have a crush on him.
“Whenever you feel this way Tones, I need you to call me, kay?” He had mumbled as he wrapped gauze after gauze along the other's wrist.
He contemplated that for a bit, Steve could tell. Could tell the gears working themselves in that head of his of all the possible outcomes. But he shook his head and took a big deep breath in and then out.
Steve knew of those books that portrayed the girl like some kind of dream character. Like a doll that was barely a person. She’d come in and change the guy and then once he was done with her, would leave and be better. Leaving her and her magic behind.
A few days after everything, Tony had called for a press conference and made a very big decision. Everyone told him he was being irrational, too impulsive, that maybe he could just wait a while and think about this, please??
To the doctors and agents around him, Tony wouldn’t say a word. But Steve could understand the language Tony was saying through the type of music he would play. How his still blood crusted fingers would switch the tapes after certain songs and how there was barely a moment of silence. Yeah, during this time, Steve knew what Tony was saying. And thinking.
Steve could tell because of how smart his mouth was. How un-likable he could be but also be the sweetest person you would ever have met. How giving and stubborn he was. How he had just so many traits you couldn’t count because, duh, real person here.
The intern, Pepper, had figured it out. It was funnily enough sent to her own danm email, and grace the Gods above that she knew a friend who spoke the language because she was able to translate it, contact Steve, and have a rescue team fly out there and get Tony.
It was an abnormally hot winter day, the weather wasn’t freezing but still a bit cold, and the young man should’ve been wearing at least a light jacket. Should’ve been covered up inside with his book and maybe a hot chocolate. Maybe some tea.
Tony let out a shuddering breath and Steve could see a few tears fall. Tony made an attempt to scratch at his bandaged wrist but stopped short. He got up, getting his balance under him and looked down at nothing.
Tony was sitting up now stopping the motion of the swing, staring at those closed eyes, the soft pale face, the dark circles.
Tried not to dwell over not protecting Tony and being there for him and for fucking up his one fucking job---
Sometimes Steve thinks if it was really a great idea for him to join the army. To be Captain America.
Steve shook his head. Blinked hard. Took a deep breath. Told himself, no. Pressed his com to his ear and muttered an “I’m going in” to Nat. And went inside.
Basically saying that “Nope, not gonna kill him. Send us a lot more money first and we’ll think about it you moron.”
Tony became Iron Man. And because of that, Steve became Captain America again. Like hell was he going to let Tony go off by himself to defend the world. He would always protect Tony, no matter what. That was his job.
The thought nearly made Tony laugh out loud; it was ridiculous—he managed to swallow it back. He knew to the very base of whatever code he was made from that if he did, this moment would shatter. They were a balanced see-saw right now, a load held by a crane that was straining to its limit. One push and everything would fall. It felt almost like they were frozen; Tony thought he was holding his breath, although he couldn't be sure.
But the parking structure crumbled around them, and they were—they were trapped. The pain was blinding and Steve’s ears were filled with an agonizing whine. and Steve must have blacked out for a spell, which… probably wasn't a good sign for him, either.
Steve felt a small rush of shame. It was a logical notion, but he couldn’t deny there was a selfish streak to the request. He wanted to know. It was like an itch in his chest that had been growing for months, ever since the day they met. Since the moment Steve had woken up to the sights of his own frantic face as a smear of a reflection in a golden mask.
, but there was a noise at the front door – a key being turned in a lock – and then Steve murmuring musically under his breath, probably humming to Sarah, and wasn't
It didn't feel like the worst thing that had happened to him in the last hour, but Tony wasn't a big fan, either.
Even though they were both undeniably aroused by the kissing, neither of them made any move to stop. Tony abstractly wondered whether he could come like this, small grazes of contact. He was starting to think so, Steve's kisses growing less coordinated; they were more just
" Tony admits, and immediately hides his face in his hands. "It's ridiculous, but there it is." His voice is muffled. "I got the best dance I've ever had in my life, and some really damn hot kissing and he was
"We were hungry," Thor said, edging a look at Jen, who flushed and wouldn't meet anyone's gaze. Tony smirked. Jen always
The Avengers decided collectively to make their own separate ways to the event; Jan and Carol both thought it would be fun to meet up afterward to guess each other's costumes. Steve's costume is off the rack; he picked it up from
"Maybe," Jan says. "Would you like to dance? I can down this if you like. Heaven knows Hank still needs some nudging to know what he's missing out on."
Tony's laughing as the strawberry jelly (and yes, Steve's hard again, just from the smell) smashes against the mess, and he looks so beautiful, Steve can't help himself; he pushes Tony down onto the dining table, even though there's food still lined up on it, and he fucks him there, among the produce, thank god for whatever twisted fuck made this place and stocked it with lube; whoever it is behind this messed up place might be sadistic captors, but at least they're
"So let me get this straight." Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve. "You realized I was in love with you, so when you found out you were responsible for a baby, you deliberately ran away without telling me, because you knew I'd demand to co-parent with you, and that would mean the world had Iron Man for less time, or my company might suffer?"
identity, could he begrudge Steve one night of a similar lie? Yeah, Steve thinks. The chance for this working out might not be a solid century, but it's more of a
The woman makes some sort of blustering response, but Steve doesn't hear it, too thrilled by what's happening right now. Iron Man has taken hold of his arm.
dots but still doesn't—?" Happy started to mutter. Tony elbowed him. Happy yelped as Steve turned back around from the fridge. "Of course I drive Iron Man around as well as Mr. Stark," Happy said, a little too loudly.
Maybe it's not Iron Man. Maybe it's the mask. Maybe Steve's only able to be this brave because of the mask. Steve definitely hasn't felt like himself since putting the outfit on. It's the same way that Steve feels different in the Captain America uniform, even though he knows at the end of the day it's just fabric.
Steve knew there wasn’t a moment on this planet where he’d ever be able to ignore Tony Stark saying please. He knew it would hurt to lift himself up again, and on some level he registered that, and had to fight hard to ignore the squelching noise again as he did so.
So there Steve was, immediately Sarah's primary and sole guardian. A social worker that had suggested that Steve could put Sarah into foster care, as Dino had no other living relatives left who could try and make a claim for custody, but Steve couldn't bear the idea. The idea of letting Sarah go into the system had been too much. Steve knew he would never forgive himself for
"Yeah," Tony admitted, gruffly. "It’s me." Tony’s face was sweaty, pale and drawn. Steve’s pain pulsed, expanded, and rippled through his body until it felt seven times its size; it made him feel so very heavy. There was blood dripping from Tony’s mouth. The helmet was damaged too. Steve hadn’t noticed that until now. And, if the helmet was damaged, maybe Tony’s unique and precious brain could have been injured, too. And that was—that was terrible
Constantly having to swallow back so many sentence fragments must be exhausting. It was going to take him a lot of time to process all the scheming and comments Tony Stark had made to cover up his secret identity. Steve was getting resigned to the notion that he was probably going to want to slap himself for how obvious a lot of Tony’s subterfuge had been. All the things Iron Man has said! “Oh,
Steve’s chest hurt, beyond his own injuries. Delirium. Of course. Maybe it was already too late. “Just hold on,” Steve whispered.
" with a soft groan that made Tony's body light up brighter than the Christmas tree they'd just finished trimming.
making it hard to think—" Tony kissed him again, sliding his hands into Steve's hair, and how was that perfect
Steve shot Tony an odd sort of look – certainly there had been no asking first when it came to this kiss. Tony shrugged and grinned at Steve, because the alternative was probably starting to gibber, and, somehow unbelievable, Steve grinned
Steve looks up, his face suddenly awash with misery. "I'm so sorry, Tony. I was having a swell time. It's just—" He shuffles, awkwardly. "I don't think this is the right situation to talk about this—"
starting to muddle from the pain. But when he did finally speak, Steve could barely believe his words.
had an unattractive Avenger. It was true, Tony thought idly, that superpowers tended to land squarely on the conventionally beautiful. They suffered for it, enough; maybe the pretty faces were compensation, the result of some sort of cosmic karmic balancing for all the shit they went through.
Oh, god. Steve feels warm and sweaty and this is the point normally where he runs and flees from a conversation, because it's one thing wanting to flirt with someone, and another actually
Wandering the quiet dark halls of the Mountain alone was an eerie experience he wasn't keen to replicate. When Tony got back to the med lab, Steve was still sitting by Tony's bedside. Carol had gone, but surprisingly, Jan was there. Tony regarded her pretty face gently, a faint pang of regret briefly flashing through him, but he didn't feel heartbroken about how their casual dating had ended. She was lovely, and they'd had a fun time; he'd thought she was a beautiful kisser, but his memories of kissing her felt washed out now, somehow. Diluted. Steve fucking Rogers had somehow ruined even the
of the food in the kitchen—there are roll-up sandwiches with the crusts cut off because they're both tired of seeded bread; pasta salad with vegetables; steak cut into fingers and breaded; strawberry yogurt and tinned peach slices; a small cake that Tony's jury-rigged together with the pancake mix and eggs—and they eat like kings, feeding each other with their fingers, reclining back on the blanket once they're done, staring up at the perfect, unbreakable (Steve's tried, a hundred times) ceiling.
Steve mills through the crowd, trying to see if he can find any of the Avengers. He finds McCoy at the bar easily, because he's wearing a highway man's coat and hat and little else, his blue fur distinctive and impossible to disguise. Vision is over by the string quartet, avidly watching them. He thinks he can see the distinctive hunch of someone with Sam's shoulders near the end of the buffet with the cakes, but he'd have to be closer to be sure.
going to be problematic, if Steve was just going to continue to make so many needy, eager responses like that. "I couldn't wait."
Steve smiles, more confidently than he feels. It is a great idea, he thinks. The Avengers really worked better after the event, and more time is just what Steve needs, to find the right words. He'll take Tony out on the balcony and confess everything, and see what happens. It's all good.
through himself. He lurched forward, wanting to console Steve, but his foot nearly dropped directly through the floor. He looked at Steve's shaking shoulders for one agonizing second before turning on his heel and running back to the stairs, not stopping until he was back in the med lab, staring down at his own comatose body.
"This floor’s clear," Iron Man said, because he still wasn’t too distracted by his admiration of the mechanical ventilation—or his mumbled hopes for Tony Stark’s next iteration of the armor—to stay on top of the reason why they were in this ugly building to begin with.
"Ah, no," Steve said. Tony glanced over to where Steve was staring at a china figurine that looked particularly small and fragile in his large hands. It was an amusing figurine—a replica of Thor but with angel wings and a halo, somewhere there was a matching Loki with devil horns and a tail and an inexplicable Santa hat to complete the ensemble—but Steve stared at it like it was invisible to the naked eye. "Not this year."
That question would be the last thing Steve would hear from Tony for a very long time, but Steve didn't know that as he stumbled out of the classroom and away from his appalled classmates. They were right to look at him like that. How could he lose control of his magic like that?
"Great," Steve says. "Watch out: Bombshell!" He holds up his shield and protects both of them from one of Bombshell's grenades.
"Maybe this will anchor him," Steve murmured, his eyes sliding back to Tony's body as he reached out and took Tony's hand in his. He didn't seem to notice that Strange and T'Challa were still there. A wash of empathy swept over T'Challa's face.
were there. Any time I flagged, the Invincible Iron Man was always battling, just a regular human throwing himself at bad guys, trussed up in a fancy tin can—"
It was the first time Tony had looked at Steve since his entrance into the room. Steve's face, a combination of pleasing angles and a brightness that always spoke to Tony of earnestness and life, seemed a little ruddy. Perhaps he'd been chasing T'challa's robo-panthers again on the higher levels.
Tony was a crushing instant combination of relief that he could maybe breathe again, and regret that Steve had taken that amazing feeling away. He swallowed, awkwardly enough that his fake beard shook with it, and opened his mouth to say something. And failed. He looked up at Steve helplessly.
" Steve breathed, and looked relieved for a brief moment before his expression swiftly changed to an angry one. He did put the hockey stick down, so that was something, at least. "What the
Tony had tried to make an invisibility rig so many times as a teenager. Nearly given himself cancer for the privilege. He couldn't believe he'd ever been so naive as to think invisibility was a good thing. Then again, when he finally pulled off the stealth suit, that invisibility hadn't come like
was a beautiful word. "But?" he repeated, hope making his own pain recede a little into the background.
Iron Man made a disgruntled noise again, accompanied by a choking noise that made Steve feel colder. That was never his favorite sensation in life.
Steve is vaguely aware that he's wandered away from Vision mid-sentence. Oh, well. He'll apologize later. This is more important. Because Tony's out there, on the balcony Steve has terribly been thinking of as
by halves, and that was true for bitter vengeance too. He supposed he should tell Tony the truth of what actually happened – that he and Sharon weren't doing anything in the Potions classroom, it had all been entirely innocent – but it wouldn't do any good.
He must work out for hours. The serum turned Steve from a tall skinny beanpole into a muscular force, but Iron Man has just as impressive muscles, all from his own hard work. Steve's almost light-headed with how much he's affected by that thought.
"Guess you'll just have to be quiet, then," Tony told him, wrapping a hand around Steve's waist and kissing him.
"First," Steve said, after putting Sarah down for a nap in an adjacent room, "I have to apologize for slamming the door in your face. You startled me."
Iron Man tilts his mask. "Uh, the gold parts? Well, the material molds to the wearer before the polarization process, that's all. It's not sculpted, it's form-fitting?"
causing trouble beyond the grave. Chasing down four or five with Steve at his side? Child's play. Exhausting, body-wearying child's play.
"That's a shame because the mental image is amazing," Carol grins at him. She's right. Steve's hit by a mental image of a guy having to haul the full Iron Man armor around like it's a suit of old armor like knights wore. It is amusing to think about someone trying to explain that.
Carol rambles about how they didn't realize Tony and Steve were missing until it was too late, and she apologizes for it taking a whole ten hours to negotiate with the aliens that took them to give them back. Jan's managed to retrieve Tony's armor too, and Steve's shield, although they've had to put them on the quinjet—even though peace has been brokered and the aliens know now the Avengers came in peace, they are still jumpy and nervous about Steve and Tony having access to their weapons. Steve thinks about how bad it got, how close he came to losing Tony, and they're
"Well, this is more domestic than I was imagining," Carol says. "But the Cavalry's here, boys. Sorry we took so long."
"Why isn't he waking up, Doctor?" T'Challa asked, his voice lower this time. Tony had heard that tone before; usually when he was talking about his own family. Huh. T'Challa actually gave a shit about him? Well, Tony thought, there were still some surprising new things to learn about the world that were a little more cheerful than no one being able to figure out why Tony was freaking
to. But Tony couldn't make himself leave. He didn't even remember how to make his invisible body stand up anymore.
In another life, Steve might have screamed at him, but he's just so glad that he has Tony back that he just tells Tony where they're up to, and they both pretend Steve's voice isn't shaking.
"Oh. Oh, I'll ask him to put them in his bedroom or something." Steve's cheeks go a little pink. "I'm sure he wouldn't deliberately make you uncomfortable, Iron Man. You should tell him when things bother you."
"How about you help me clear these empty crates into storage?" Steve asked, nodding over at the storage closet with a knowing light in his eyes.
Strange drew up to him. "Keep him as he is. Continue monitoring him. Inform me if there are any changes. I have to scan for magical energies where the hit occurred, see if there's an answer there."
Steve hurts Tony on Day 540. It's nothing much. A slap. He regrets it as soon as he's done it, because the room resets but they don't, and Tony will always remember this, for as long as he lives. Which, in this room, might very well be forever. The walls feel like they're pressing in on him, shutting down on them both, but when Steve measures the width and length of their prison in careful paces, the dimensions always stay the same.
"Ten hours?" Tony repeats, sounding dazed. He stares at Steve and shakes; Steve gathers him in his arm and holds him close, even though they're getting stared at by Jan, Carol, Hank, and Sam for the intimacy of their embrace. Let them look, Steve thinks, tugging Tony closer. Let them stare as much as they like.
Tony grinned at Steve smugly. "You were so damn sure you knew me. Did I manage to surprise you yet?"
"Funny story. Turns out the magic those damn elves hit me with just separated my consciousness from my body. Strange said something about an unusual fourteenth plane – it sounded like bullshit to me – needless to say… I was here the whole time." Tony spread his hands wide. "Ta-da?"
For another date, Tony creates a picnic lunch: he rearranges the room to make space on the floor, pushing the table, two dining chairs and dusky-rose sofa to the outside of the room, and he places the pink coverlet from the bed on the floor like it's a blanket. Tony makes pretty much
Tony switches his microphone off so at least Steve is saved from the strangled yell he makes. He takes a deep breath and switches it back on. "You really shouldn't take flowers."
A set of memories flickered across his mind like a flash of lightning had stutteringly lit up a series of blurry photo stills. He remembered edging carefully to the next floor, shield outstretched. Nothing but gray walls again, thick pillars, that dreadfully joy-sapping design. Then—something had happened. What was it? The photos in his mind cut out, leaving him with just the terrible reality of the aftermath.
reputation we were protecting," Tony murmured, wrapping his hands around Steve's waists, thrilling when Steve nestled into his arms with a noise of sheer contentment. "My personal reputation is already pretty shot to hell. And my business hasn't exactly been shining. Besides, worst case?" Tony regarded Steve coolly. "I'm a cis white man with billions of dollars at my disposal. My disgrace in the public eye would last for, what, a week?" He beamed. "America's a bit fucked up like that. That's why we left, right?"
Tony choked out an unamused laugh and turned his head to look at Steve, and he couldn't hold it back, couldn't do anything but blaze his heartbreak at Steve at full force, because Tony was a fool who had let himself be vulnerable and been sliced apart for the privilege. Tony was weak enough to let Steve glimpse a shard of the damage he'd caused.
Steve's expression was serious, the same way it was when he was looking at a battlefield and calculating scenarios in his head, except all that concentration was focused directly on Tony, and it was almost as head-spinning as that hand-holding sensation had been.
There was definitely a major plus side – Tony was never going to have the impulse to erase his brain again, because here was a fact he never wanted to forget, never wanted to unlearn: Steve Rogers was an
The more he thinks about it, the more sense it makes. Tony and Iron Man are so rarely in the same room together. Tony's rarely seen without his briefcase and now they know the Iron Man armor can be folded down, it makes sense to Steve that the briefcase contains the armor. Steve hadn't known anyone in this decade, yet Iron Man had fiercely guarded his identity; of course he was one of the very few civilian faces Steve
"I wasn't asking to know your feelings," Tony said, slowly, even though Steve couldn't hear him. "I just didn't want to be the thing ruining your reputation. I didn't want to be something you covered up or apologized for."
“Not at work?” Steve asks, trying to ignore the quiet thump of that ever-present-Tony Stark-feeling as he crossed the floor to the cupboards to dig around for a mug.
even when Steve was at his worst. Steve pulled back and leaned his forehead against Tony's, his breathing rough again. "I meant what I said out there," Steve said, softly. "It's...usually a holiday
to consider it. He deserved so much more than to be someone's dirty little secret. Even if that person was someone who felt as necessary to Tony as oxygen. God, Tony had been such a fool to believe he deserved any of it. Kissing Steve had felt like finally coming
This was desperation. It tasted sour. Tony’s lips were cold. Tony could die of hypothermia before either of them finished bleeding out. Steve’s eyes were stinging. This wasn’t the kiss he’d imagined. It was rough, sloppy, inexact. But it was real, and if Steve died right now, if no one found them, he might actually be okay with that.
The first of these superheroes to gain notoriety was the Golden Avenger, Iron Man. No one saw his face. No one knew his name. He performed marvelous acts of heroism. Eventually, more heroes joined him, including the legendary Captain America, brought back to life from suspended animation. And still, no one knew Iron Man's real name.
ask him on a date? Steve shivers and Iron Man cocks his head in a way that makes Steve blurt something else out, before he says or does something dumb and ruins his friendship with Iron Man in the process.
them, without knowing what they are, and then it's months into a relationship, and the person I'm with has no idea what I'm feeling, because how
A kiss doesn't break the curse of the room, but Steve didn't expect it to; this has always been more of a nightmare than a fairytale.
to?" He carefully waited until Steve opened his mouth, ready to splutter, before crashing over him with, "I don't suppose I'd mind some help this year."
Unlike Steve, Tony was still trying to regain control of his body. Holy shit. He forced himself to count his breaths, inhaling for four, exhaling for eight. Holy shit holy shit holy
The music is soft, an easy rhythm to dance to. Steve's breath stutters as the dancers around them push them even closer together; Iron Man's breath is hot on Steve's shoulder, and Steve's moving a hand before he realizes, up and down Iron Man's back, and Iron Man's shuddering a breath that Steve can feel through his fingertips.
"I plan to," Tony said, glibly, pressing forwards for another of those glorious kisses that had landed him in this mess to start with. He pulled away after another with a sigh. "We should probably find somewhere a little more private for this."
Steve stood up, maybe the first time he had since their return to the Mountain. "Then why are you here, wasting your damn time, if there's something you could do?"
"I know this is scary, but I'm your friend and we're going to get through this together," Tony blurted.
Steve would laugh, if it didn’t hurt. As it was, his body made a kind of involuntary spasm, which made his mouth flood with an unpleasant metallic taste.
"Yeah," Tony said viciously, and resumed walking, only to change his mind two paces later to pivot on his heel and glare at Steve. "What, did you think she'd assume I meant you?"
"I would never step on someone's toes during a dance," Iron Man sniffs loudly, like he's offended. "But yeah, yeah—I guess I could do that."
"I'm taking the day off today, I think," Tony says, after he finishes drawing something on Steve's back with his fingers. It's an almost unconscious habit; Steve thinks he's planning out schematics for inventions he may never get to make. Steve's stomach hurts when he thinks of it like that.
Tony glared at Happy intensely. Perhaps he wouldn't upgrade the vacation package for him after all. Happy noticed the glare and quailed.
When they first met, Steve had initially assumed Iron Man was just hired muscle, maybe a veteran of some kind. An ex-soldier would be the right kind of crazy to hurl themselves at villains dressed only in an—admittedly miraculous—metal tin can. But, as time went on, it was becoming more clear that Iron Man was a
"He is...very concerned for our dearest brother," Thor said, his voice a warm rumble. Tony's eyes might have stung, if Tony had been in his physical body. Instead, he felt himself
Especially when Steve had options. Tony was furious, all of a sudden. There was no way Steve should be doing this alone. Sure, he might have no living blood relatives left, but he had family. He had the
"Do I have to order you to leave this room, Steve?" T'Challa asked from the doorway, a deceptively light tone to his voice. Tony had heard T'Challa use that tone several times before; usually right before he competently brought a villain sobbing to their knees in seconds.
Tony readied himself to pull back from the kiss, reluctant because each one was as dizzyingly good as the first, and—
Steve's name too, in tattered scraps of noise that fell from his throat like a desperate prayer to a god Tony didn't believe in.
"I'm sure we'll survive without your dulcet tones for a hot second, Shell-head," Sam says, rolling his eyes.
Steve, let alone talked to him. The kissing almost felt like it had happened to someone else in another lifetime. Maybe Tony's fevered, overworked brain had imagined the whole thing.
, I can go fetch Tony, I’m sure he’s just a few rooms away, let me go get him.” Honestly. Steve does feel a little bit ridiculous for never seeing anything suspicious in Tony’s behavior. Hindsight could be unfair like that.
″You probably should,″ Steve said, and there wasn't a point in dragging this out, every second counted. With that though in mind he grimaced, pushed himself up a few inches on the pole again, and ignored the pain screaming behind his eyeballs in favor of shoving the shirt into the blooming-flower wound, pushing it into the ragged flesh.
It's only when he's staring up at the ceiling and not at Tony that Steve even has the courage to voice his worry. Steve asks the question quickly, like he's been winded with it and has only a small amount of oxygen spare to get it all out. "Do you not—worry about the time you use—setting these things up? That you should be using it on the puzzle instead?"
″ He slipped into the chair next to Tony, putting his mug down, smiling softly when Tony unconsciously mirrored the gesture. They were so used to working in unison on the field that even these small domestic moments echoed that easy physical familiarity with each other. ″You're the bravest person I've ever met.″
Steve wonders if he'll recognize any of the other Avengers in the sea of people Tony Stark has invariably invited. Beast and Vision, probably; it's not like a mask can hide much of their distinctive physical appearances. Sam might be easy to find, not just because Stark's invitation list probably includes a sea of old white men (although, that too), but because he'll probably be tense and uncomfortable and so worried about dancing that he'll likely be sulking in a corner, arms folded, and most likely haunting the buffet table. Jan's costume will be incredibly beautiful and hand-crafted. Carol will be difficult, Steve thinks; she's graceful and beautiful and a statuesque blonde, but Steve's seen enough photos of Tony Stark's parties to know he's very good at finding lots of pretty women that fit that description to invite to these things.
And Tony had let himself be chased away with barely any of the story? With still so very little explanation as to what the fuck was going on?
"It's annoying," Iron Man says, "but if it gets training back on track, I can take one for the team." He lifts up a hand and then pauses. "I won't talk while it's off. Depolarizing turns off my tech at the same time."
Tony blinked rapidly, several times in a row. Steve was staring at him completely perplexed. "I did," Tony said. "But—"
. It was sarcasm. Steve’s brain could not compute it. It didn’t make any sense. Iron Man was—he was incredible. He was
It was probably good that he hadn't tried to kiss Steve under the mistletoe. He'd probably have fallen promptly off the ladder and embarrassed himself.
The other Gryffindors had taken sides, of course – it had been years since Tony's less-than-graceful introduction to Hogwarts. Most people had forgotten Tony’s weird crazy outbursts, or had taken them in stride. Tony had friends now, a far cry from their first year, when Steve had been Tony's only friend.
"How about we spar a little, one on one, now we have the room to ourselves," Steve suggests, proud that the words don't run into one another in his hurry to say them. "The Masquerade Ball is going to be big and new enough for me this week."
in real-time; Steve's having fun, even if he was right and he can't work up the courage to flirt with someone under the cover of his mask.
Tony's inclination was just to nod once, sharply, and then run out of there, as fast as his wobbly legs would allow, but… bravery was the theme of Tony's life right now, wasn't it? Carol and he used to be best friends, best
who disappeared… Well. That sort of felt like an insult added to the injury of walking into the kitchen, expecting to see Steve already awake and perky at the breakfast table, and finding instead an empty chair and a note on the computer that Steve was officially inactive as an Avenger.
"Awkward," Tony sang under his breath as loudly as he dared; Steve's hearing was excellent, he'd hear it.
"What if—we never get out—or they never looked for us—or what if they're trapped too—or this is all in our heads—"
"Maybe we should consider shopping at a different lot if this one delivers trees with bugs in them."
Steve startles, realizing the hand that guided his down isn't there to stop him. He flushes and moves his hand up to Iron Man's waist. Except then he realizes he'd distractedly groped Iron Man for longer than Iron Man had intended, and what if Iron Man needs to be rescued from Steve now, as much as Steve tried to rescue him from that lady to begin with?
"I'll hold the door open," Tony said rapidly, and side-stepped fully out of Steve's way toward the door. He had to move fast, lest he take his wishful thinking and run with it. It had to just be fanciful daydreaming kicking in, because as he pushed the door open with one heel, he
"I freak out when I try to say what I'm feeling and it's not fair. I was never fair to my past partners and I've not been fair to you, Tony. They deserved better and so do you." Steve's mouth tightened into a smile that looked too close to self-loathing for Tony's comfort. "People keep describing me as brave, but they've got no idea what that means, do they?
"How about you book a meeting with Tony later to talk about materials," Steve says, cutting through the tension with his most level voice, "and we continue training now?"
He knew Steve pursued every action in his life with single-minded focus; Tony had never truly properly considered how it would be to have all that dedication concentrated solely on him. Steve was an ocean wave crashing over all his storm defenses, devastating everything that Tony had built walls to protect. This was the kind of kiss that had the potential to change
It was only when Iron Man spoke that it occurred to Steve that maybe he’d gone too far. That maybe this wasn’t the place, or the time, but if imminent mortal danger wasn’t the right time, when would be? He hadn’t planned to say it, or maybe he had. It had surprised Iron Man, at least, and proven at the same time that he was relatively cognizant enough to hear what Steve was saying. If nothing else happened besides Steve horribly embarrassing himself, then there was enough good in it that he couldn’t complain.
Tony had said. Steve had replayed that moment in his head a thousand times. But, if Tony had been truly delirious, then none of it might have been true. Why hadn’t Steve thought about that?
"Timely," the man said, and at Steve's obvious confusion, he said it again. "This town here is called Timely." The man pointed behind Steve.
Tony mumbles about needing a change of clothes and a shower. When Steve watches Tony cross the hallway to get to his personal suite, Steve feels gutted, like Tony took one of his organs with him. Steve swallows awkwardly and goes into his own bedroom.
Tony's cheeks darkened and he carefully looked away. ″I worked very hard to fool you. To fool everyone.″ Those last three words were added hurriedly. Steve liked that idea, that Tony was desperate for Steve to know he wasn't targeting him in particular. ″It's been… increasingly difficult, over the months. My intentions, particularly at the start, were good—as good as can be expected, I suppose.″
been turned into an instant statue, until Steve inhaled sharply and looked at Tony with a wavering smile this time. "Sorry," Steve said, "sorry, it's just—it only just hit me. You're real."
Steve takes a quick look over to the balcony door as she leads him to the floor. He'll be able to see if Tony manages to come back to the ball. And if he doesn't, well.
Carefully spitting the glove aside once he got it off, Steve gritted his teeth and lifted his upper body by tensing his core and leaning upward. Sliding even just that far up the pole embedded into them both was not a sensation Steve thought anyone would willingly choose to do more than once, even if it was for as good a cause as
kiss Sarah's pink, wrinkled face on his way out the door, though. But he regretted it fiercely as he stepped away from Steve's dumb little two-story house and his pathetic little grass lawn and his beautiful baby girl nestled so sweetly against Steve's broad chest, because now he felt like he was abandoning both of them.
Iron Man was covering him. Like he'd pushed Steve out of the way. Steve had been skewered like this once before, but as long as they were found quickly, all Steve could expect to suffer was a world of pain and a longer recovery time than he’d prefer. Thanks to the serum’s enhanced healing factor, being impaled by a metal pole wasn’t the likely death sentence it could be. Steve’s eyes stung. Not as a consequence of his own injury, but because Iron Man hadn’t been so lucky.
Tony wakes for the waffles. Wakes like he hasn't just checked out for over a month. He eats the ones Steve makes for him in a (pink, always pink) waffle maker and then kneels next to Steve by the door once he's done, asking briefly what number they're up to.
It was probably because he was so desperate for it to be true. Steve was about to stutter an apology for misreading the situation, when Tony continued talking and Steve forgot how to breathe for a moment.
It wasn't fair for Steve to think of Tony so possessively, not when Steve was the one to wreck their burgeoning…
Sometimes Steve would get a madness upon him, a stubborn idea that stuck in his head; a maniacal intensity that couldn't be shaken or beaten loose. Tony couldn't relate. Ha.
Because Iron Man casually pulls off his mask and runs a hand through his hair and he smiles charmingly at Steve.
Steve slides his hand into Tony's curls and that's almost a religious experience in itself, somehow. Steve's head tilts back because he can't help it and the back of his skull connects painfully with the outside wall. He's seeing stars, metaphorical and physical, and something in his ears starts whining, high-pitched and consuming as Tony's hands slip down Steve's sides. Tony looks ridiculously proud of himself for a moment, but then the pleased smirk slides away.
you are." Tony emerged from the tree, face reddened from scraping past a myriad of pine needles in search of his quarry, and he held up the device in a victorious pose. "Tada!"
"I guess I see that," Tony breathes, edging a repulsor blast at where he's pretty sure Death-Stalker's hiding—he curses when he only manages to catch part of her cloak as she skips out of the way just in time. "Uh, no allergies, though."
Iron Man is so close and Steve bends closer to his ear so he can whisper above the music, "I know who you are."
"Yeah. With the way villains have been descending on the season, it makes better sense for Iron Man to be based there until things calm down."
The door hadn't even fully closed when he shoved Tony back up against the shelves. Steve was insane.
"It's fine," Steve said, in that wet-eyed, tight-throat, shoulders-bunched way which meant the direct opposite, but he'd made himself vulnerable enough for now. "I understand."
"I put non-slip pads under all your rugs; there are safety plugs in your open outlets. I'm putting latches now on your drawers and cupboards that could be within her reach soon. She looks like she's gonna hit crawling age pretty damn fast. You're gonna want to install some safety tassels on the kitchen blinds, asap, but you'll need to order those in, your local stores were out."
Tony closed his eyes and sank into the sensations. His body was alight, feverish. The world had narrowed down into a universe of sensation, stars being born in the slide of Steve's tongue in his mouth.
Pepper smiled. "Thank you." She hugged the papers closer and headed to the door. She paused just before leaving. "Oh, and the Queen County Hospital called. They wanted to say thank you for your donation efforts, and also, to thank you again for being their Santa last week."
but he was shy, I guess—he didn't take his mask off—and I should have insisted, because—Ugh. I suck. I should have told him not to leave. I should have—" Tony sighs and lifts up his face. His cheeks are a little pink. "That's it, I'm a mess, I know." Tony lets out a muted noise and buries his face in his hands again.
want to have. Which would be even more awkward, with Tony talking right now about his crush on someone else.
Steve has to blink and blink again as cold air spirals down, as a dark sky is revealed by the large gap that's been opened in the roof. Steve's kneeling by the puzzle door; Tony's still washing dishes at the sink.
Tony edged a glance at Steve. Steve wasn't looking at him. His jaw was clenched like he was mulling over something in his head, something he probably would never say. His shoulders were hunched over slightly, which was more unusual; Steve's posture was usually perfect at all times. Even in bed.
Steve pretended Tony’s voice wasn’t quiet and crackling. He wasn’t doing a good job of that. “I’m not opposed to
"So if it folds up flat, how come the protection parts are so sculpted?" McCoy asks, projecting his voice so they can all clearly hear him. "You know. On your arms and legs."
"Sweet of you to offer, Cap. I didn't mean that kind of bug." Tony waved the small device in his hand in Steve's direction for a moment.
"I have no way of even finding out his name," Tony sighs, unaware that Steve is mentally imploding, just a couple feet away from him. "Damn my nebulous
Steve's stomach twinges. As much as there's a part of him hoping Tony means their passionate balcony kissing, he also knows Tony's reputation. Tony gets to kiss plenty of people, all the time. He's not the same sad sack as Steve is about it. He braces himself to listen and be a supportive friend. "Steve Rogers wouldn't mind sitting with a mug of coffee at a respectable hour in the morning to talk about his friend's issues," he says, slowly.
Tony wakes him on Day 1095, urges him to take care of his usual problem, then pounces as soon as Steve exits the small bathroom; pushing him onto the bed, sucking him until he's hard, and then riding him so fast and deep that Steve sees stars. He smiles at Steve, instructs him to stay in bed, and half an hour later brings him breakfast—he's turned their daily six eggs into a hash with some of the vegetables that line the bottom of the fridge every morning. He's poured Steve a large glass of the apple juice and makes him drink it, even though it's Tony's favorite.
The protracted silence from Iron Man disproved that assumption immediately. "As long as help gets here soon, I’ll be fine," Iron Man said, after that pause.
There was movement at the door as Steve stood in the Charms corridor, hating himself: he looked up eagerly, hoping to see Tony being helped towards the Infirmary, but instead, it was Sharon.
As soon as the Mountain's medical staff cleared him, Tony immediately checked the Mountain's scanners to find Steve's location. He wasn't surprised to see Steve's blinking blue dot in the training room. When he straightened, intending to head straight there, Carol was standing in the med lab doorway, looking slightly awkward.
of Hogwarts students, in all my years here." She crossed her hands over her chest, her robes swishing angrily around her ankles as she came to a full stop. "The whole
The last four days had been ridiculous. They'd all had to split up to fight myriad villains who didn't understand that the spirit of the season was supposed to be about giving gifts, not pipe-bombs. The Avengers ended up missing Christmas entirely, swapping their Secret Santa gifts belatedly. Tony had gotten a large supply of coffee from Thor. He'd been stereotyped by the Norse god powerhouse. He loved it.
If Tony had paused to consider the logistics of kissing with a fake beard, he probably would have dismissed it as awkward and struck it from his mental list of things that he was interested in trying out. But it didn't seem difficult at all. Or maybe it was Steve, and that's why it was easy. Tony wondered whether he was hallucinating, because it seemed so strange that he
"Damn, that's hot," Iron Man murmurs; he pushes forwards, and Steve whines again, something that sounds needy and pathetic to his own ears, because he hadn't realized he was aroused, not until Iron Man's hard-on is pressed up against his, and Steve thinks he can hear his heart pounding in his ears; Iron Man's hips undulate once and Steve's fingers tighten on Iron Man's shoulders, because he suddenly feels like he's holding on for dear life.
Steve can still feel the lump in his throat and chest that he'd had for the period of time Tony mentally checked out. He can't express how he's feeling, so he just reaches out and takes Tony's hand in his, tangling their fingers together. From the way Tony clings back, he thinks Tony understands the words he didn't say anyway.
"Are you okay?" Tony asked, because somehow that seemed the most important thing to know. Tony would take whatever followed, as long as Steve was okay.
Steve couldn't stop staring at him. There was something about the way Tony was smiling that unsettled him. That made the ever-present pulsing feeling in Steve's chest seem to gravitate to echo loudly in his ears. He swallowed nervously. ″Well, I suppose you'll have to make that up to me.″
″We weren't going to die,” Steve said. He felt like he had to protest that. He wasn’t a fan of Tony talking about his death. “It wasn't that close.″
"You're a menace," Steve whispered, stole another brush of a kiss, and then disappeared into the training room so rapidly Tony almost laughed out loud in shock. He pressed his hand to his mouth to stifle the sound. He still couldn't believe how good it felt.
"Speaking of Mr. Stark," Steve says, because training seems to have been completely derailed, "he sent something down for us this morning. I was saving it for the end of the training session, but I guess we're accidentally there."
Steve was halfway to reassured before the words fully hit him. He stared up at Iron Man’s mask, hating how he could see his own grimace reflected in the metal. "And what’s your definition of
It's the mask. The whole disguise. Steve feels brave. This must be why Iron Man enjoys staying in his identity-concealing armor, because like this, Steve almost feels invincible too.
Steve just melted into it, and all his protests had been solely vocal, because his body held no argument to this kiss. Steve's fingers found warm purchase at the nape of his neck and he gasped when Tony's hand found the curve of his ass, and Tony swallowed up the moan Steve made when Tony dug his fingers into the meat of it, just needing Steve as close to him as possible.
"This is why I didn't tell you," Steve hissed, trying to keep his voice low so Sarah didn't wake up.
Tony's reputation. Of fucking course. That would be the problem. That would always be a problem. Steve was a good, kind, strong person. A paragon of all virtues.
A world without Steve Rogers in it made no damned sense to Tony Stark, and that was a tenet to live by.
Day 512. Tony hasn't eaten since Day 490. It doesn't seem to matter—they wake up every day physically reset. Steve's sure of that—he wakes up every day straining to pee, no matter how much or how little he's drunk the day before.
Sharon had clearly not been herself. Imperiused, he thought, trying the term out in his head. That fit.
Tony didn't believe it for a long moment. He ran up the stairs two at a time, too impatient to wait for the elevator, knocking so furiously on Steve's door that he woke up Clint; Clint didn't even leave time for Tony to explain, merely mumbled under his breath before flipping Tony the bird and disappearing back into his room. Tony scowled and punched in his skeleton key code into the panel locking Steve's room and he hurtled in, eyes wide as he took in everything in front of him.
"Wow, I thought I lost all sense of graceful co-ordination at this time of night," Tony says, a laugh in his voice as he puts a mug under the coffee machine and deftly dispenses some.
me?" Steve's voice was harsher than he meant it to be. Steve was aware that he was the villain of this piece, and yet, he couldn't help himself. Tony had been his best friend for the last five and a half years; being apart from him all the time
The leggings still show those distinctive legs. Steve didn't get that wrong. He knows he couldn't get something like that so wrong; he's spent hours looking at Iron Man's legs, even more recently after knowing the real guy beneath the metal had that stunning physique.
"I expected a little more gratitude, considering I'm saving your life." Strange smirked. "Another couple of weeks and you'd have faded completely."
to go into the family business one day, and Sarah Stark was the perfect kind of alliteration for that.
"So why the new suit?" Steve tilted his head, considering. "Should we be calling you Jingle-Bell Head now?"
"It's safer if I go now," Steve twisted, pressing a soft kiss against Tony's mouth before he got up, pulled his pants and t-shirt back on, and left Tony's room.
"I'm just saying," Tony said. He could hear the mulishness in his own tone, but he hadn't been able to erase it in time. There was something about Steve that had him permanently off-kilter. Still, it was the best move, and Tony
But right now, like this, Steve isn't himself. He could be anyone. He could go down into that party and flirt with
"I've got some bumpers to put on the sharper furniture in here too. Once I've installed them, I'll go." Tony fidgeted with his screwdriver as he installed the next latch. "I know I'm overstepping, just like you were scared of, but, well, you hadn't done them yet, and I wouldn't be able to sleep knowing your house wasn't safe."
Once back at the mansion, the Avengers all vocally swear off space adventures for a while, and pull Doctor Strange in to check Steve and Tony over. Steve's sour when he overhears Strange telling the others that Tony and Steve didn't invent the impossible room—traces of time magic are all over them, apparently— but the sourness fades when he hears Strange adding instruction to be careful with them. Steve doesn't wait for them to give the all-clear announcement—he drags Tony upstairs instead.
Tony couldn't explain what was happening for a moment. Something had happened to gravity, or the thermostat, or the floor was shifting beneath them, or—
Iron Man seemed to be enjoying himself anyway. Something about the hideously thick concrete walls blocked some of his scanners, so he had been muttering to himself since the moment their prey had entered the structure; apparently he was sketching out improvements to his suit under his breath.
"Thought I was someone else, huh?" Steve keeps his voice gentle. His cheeks flush as he remembers what else they've done out here.
For other people. That aren’t in my—well—that’s another matter, that’s a different kind of care anyway, I’m
Steve blinks, but then remembers how different he looked to himself. He smiles at her. "I should hope so. Unless you rescue a
what Steve meant. Iron Man is responsive in his arms and Steve meets the kiss, cautious but then sinking in, becoming hungry for the feeling of it. His entire skull feels like it's buzzing. The feeling's almost exactly the same as when Steve falls and Iron Man catches him.
It was probably stress. As stress-free as December had felt, January was pushing back with a vengeance. The only thing making it bearable was the moments when Steve was kissing him, because the kisses still felt
should have just—talked to Tony. Told him what he was feeling. Except, how could Steve put it all into words? When he
covering his own tracks, it was obvious. One large ATM withdrawal, and then some footage of Steve accessing a lockbox at the Empire Municipal bank, and then Steve's route was meticulous; Tony managed to track him partially across the city via CCTV, but Steve turned down an alley, and although he looked, Tony couldn't find where he re-emerged.
Steve lifted his gaze and Tony couldn't help the unhappy noise that silently left his invisible mouth, because Steve looked the very opposite of
"We're supposed to be bringing out the extra potatoes," Tony hissed, as Steve nosed along Tony's jawline and sweetly swallowed his protests.
″I have to admit, I feel a little stupid for missing it,″ Steve said. Tony glanced over the top of his mug at him, eyebrows slightly raised. ″Who Iron Man really was,″ Steve finished, awkwardly. ″I feel like I should have known.″
"You're not too bad yourself," Iron Man says, and Steve swallows, because maybe that means he should apologize, except then Iron Man sweeps in, confidence in his speed; he wraps a hand around Steve's waist, tugs him to him, puts his other hand on Steve's cheek, and pulls him into a kiss.
Tony froze. He was usually so careful about not letting any of his feelings for Steve slip, but maybe he hadn't been as careful as he should, maybe Happy would suggest that—
Steve thought about it as he wheezed through another breath. He remembered how impressed Iron Man had sounded. "They’re all self-contained."
They used to be as necessary to each other as oxygen. She hadn't glued herself to Tony's side like Steve had, but she had been there, regularly. She still cared, even if neither of them knew what to do with that.
From the amount of blood, Steve couldn’t even hope that it had just hit the armor and not the pilot inside the suit. He forced himself to look closer; to take in the details. Part of the red-and-gold armor was peeled back around one of the wounds and Steve could barely bring himself to look at it. The broken metal pipe extended straight through that wound, through and through, ragged flash surrounding it like a nightmarish flower. There was certainly a lot of blood coming from it. Too much. Steve’s brain was already flooding with facts. It would only take losing a liter and a half of blood for Iron Man to be in real trouble.
"No, you're not reading this moment wrong," Tony hurried to clarify, realizing that Steve had worried it was a
"You could tell who Gamelin was, even with the mask?" Steve asks, because he's curious whether he's so transparent.
Iron Man, all the parts that mattered. Knowing his name hadn’t changed Steve’s regard for him. Well, maybe it had changed a little. Steve’s quiet level of being impressed with Iron Man and his awe of Tony Stark had combined into a weird, low, pulsing feeling that took up space in Steve’s chest every time Steve saw him. So. There was that.
brave. You open your heart to everyone you give a shit about. And somehow, I think that included me, even though I don't know
"I compartmentalized what you and I were doing. I told myself it was fine. Because then I didn't have to think about what I was feeling. Not deeply. I knew I was happy and I thought that was all I needed to know. I told myself what I tell myself every time, that I can just – live in the moment. No point overthinking something that's supposed to just be about feelings." Steve huffed. "But I don't even think
"Aren't you supposed to be able to see into all of the other astral realms or whatever this bullshit is?" Tony asked.
Steve was right. You couldn't raise a baby in Manhattan as an Avenger. Not with all the various supervillains running around and causing havoc. It would only be a matter of time until one of them tried to steal Sarah in order to control Steve, or manipulate him. And the power Steve and Tony had at their fingers… That would be dangerous. And if Tony had known Steve loved him, yeah, Tony could see it. He could easily see himself wanting to move to Maine, to be with Steve, to help raise his child.
That was—that was awful. Horrifying. "You have more than Jarvis. You have to. It doesn't make sense. You’re too—" Words were failing him. Maybe he was more hurt than he thought he was. His confusion was profound and perplexing and bewildering all at once. "You’re
"Oh, please," Tony waved a gauntleted hand. "Like I don't mask and filter all the conversations we have in public areas anyway." He shot Steve a glance when Steve looked relieved at that. "So you just might as well spit it out."
This whole place resets to perfect parameters. All the dials on the door reset to zero. All the food in the cupboards and the fridge and freezer reappear perfectly restocked. The trash can is empty. Any sign they try and leave on the room gets erased come 7am. They've tried to stay awake, but they pass out at 6:59am, however hard they try.
If there was pain from the shelves digging into him, Steve's lips against his were a balm that took away all sensation but sheer, transcendent
" a voice yelped from outside, and Tony stilled immediately. Tony still had his eyes closed, but he could feel Steve stiffen against him, and not in the fun way that had been looming if the kissing had continued much longer. "Does that mean I have to
“Noted. I’m just glad you’re still coherent enough to make an argument out of it. I should probably count that as a good thing."
“With all that technology in your suit, couldn’t you have at least installed a painkiller?” Steve asked, somewhat crossly.
"I hear it's traditional," Steve says, his heart pounding ridiculously, "when you want a fairytale ending."
He should have the muscle memory for it down already; he'd been playing a version of this character for nearly a decade and a half now.
"It's been two months. We can't stay static, not with the threats we have still out there. We have to proceed with the assumption that Stark will be out of commission for… the foreseeable future."
"Looking good," Tony called out, gaining him a full row of faces turned his way: Thor, Robbie, Carol, Jen, and Steve. T'Challa wasn't there; he took his role as leader much more seriously than any Avenger ever had, and was probably in his office, brooding. Or maybe he was healthily getting enough sleep, unlike the rest of them. "Why the early morning?"
"I'm sure," Iron Man mutters, and then there's a low whirring noise emitting through his speakers and the armor...sort of deflates.
"Great," Iron Man says and then puts one hand at Steve's waist, the other on his shoulder. "Then dance with me. There's an idiot at three o'clock, the guy in the white suit.
"Your mystery guy," Steve says, slowly, coming to stand next to Tony, staring out at the gardens and the pretty night sky. "Did he stand you up?"
probably isn't the word Steve should choose to describe someone's voice, but it's what he feels. Iron Man's voice without the modulator to distort it is just
Steve stared up at him. It didn’t feel real. Tony’s face was a patchwork of shadows in the open helmet, an assembly of pieces that made painful, terrible sense as a whole. Steve had so many things he wanted to say—so many events suddenly made clear,
The thing was, Tony's heart had been literally ripped to shreds and patched so badly back together that he'd been in pain with it for years. He knew what that felt like. And he thought he'd even known heartbreak before. Tony had run the full gamut of women breaking his heart: he'd been cheated on; used for his connections and money; unceremoniously dumped in favor of another; abandoned and left to die; kidnapped and tortured…
For a moment, Tony didn't feel like an idiot. For a moment, there was something in Steve's eyes that was encouraging, a quirk of life in his beautiful blue eyes that had Tony's heartrate increasing in wild, unrestrained hope.
Steve clapped his hands together and headed to the fridge, pulling out a water carafe. He shot Tony an amused look over his shoulder as he effortlessly poured himself a glass of water without looking. "Was it supposed to be a secret? Same eyes, same height, same build?"
Steve started to shake his head, but there was a guilty look on his face, one Tony didn't need Steve to verbalize to understand. "Tony—"
not making snide comments or shooting sly curses in Steve's direction at every opportune moment. He was stewing over it throughout Charms, and Tony was making it worse; everyone
Steve held eye contact and then took one of Tony's hands in his own, a jerking movement, like it had been an impulse he couldn't hold back; Steve's hand was so very warm and his fingers curled gently around Tony's hand like it was something fragile or precious.
The closet was dark and small, but not too dark that Tony couldn't see the amused expression Steve angled at him. "I think I can manage," Steve said. The amusement was in his tone, too. Super strength, of course. Sometimes Steve was so solid and real it was difficult to remember how spectacularly
Tony barked a polite, media-friendly laugh. She was pretty in a conventional way; Tony of ten years ago would have swept her off her feet in an instant. Tony of today was exhausted, bruised, and he had a few hours ahead of him of making sure there was no lingering magic
wants to sit in a kitchen at ass o'clock at night and talk about a poor billionaire's love life problems."
"Latverian slang for cool," Tony resumed his sweep of the tree, pushing the device back into the thick branches. "If you believe that sort of propaganda." Tony did not, although a few years ago he might have, but that was before the Latverian media machine tried its best last year to insist
feel sick—at least, that’s what the last amendment of the dictionary said. They’re always flipping that damn definition.”
When Iron Man brings them all a third invitation, the following day, Steve doesn't know what possesses him to suggest that the Avengers attend in uniform, but it feels right when he says it. Jan sighs, but admits she's pleased she doesn't have to make a third dress. It means he'll be wearing a mask, but it's his usual one. No red-and-gold feathers. Just Captain America. Just Steve.
job, and interrupting that blissful, unreal kissing, but instead, he just felt warm, seeing them all work together to help him with the task. Yeah, maybe Tony had hoarded it to himself for too long.
Steve inhales, mouth weirdly dry as he takes in Iron Man's appearance. The leggings hug so tightly to those impossibly familiar thighs. Steve's spent hours admiring Iron Man's armor, dazzled by how inventive and amazing Tony's mind must be to come up with something so wonderful. Learning that the armor shaped intimately to the wearer's body shape had at first seemed incredible. Now, seeing those marvelous thighs in something other than an invincible metal coating, Steve's only just realizing how astounding Tony's technology is.
Steve thought it was acquiescence, him realizing that Steve had a point. But then Steve ran the two words through his mind again and his stomach sank. Iron Man had emphasized the word
Fuck the door puzzle—Steve has to figure out pancakes. There's a recipe on the packet. He follows it dutifully. Makes a whole plateful. There isn't any syrup in this cursed place, but there's a jar of strawberry jelly. Tony stirs a little but doesn't wake. Just stares at the wall, blank. Steve refuses to believe he's gone. Steve eats all the pancakes himself with the jelly and reads the packet as he shovels them into his mouth. Apparently it's a waffle mix too.
The Avengers collectively won't shut up about how amazing the ball was and how much fun they had. Steve hadn't realized the team had been missing that element so badly from their lives, but it's not difficult to notice that the event has brought them closer together. Their drills are going more smoothly, their training has been re-invigorated. Steve is already penciling more ideas for social events they can do together in his head, although the secret identities make things awkward. He makes a mental note to add it to the next agenda.
By the time Tony was at the top of the tree, balancing on a folding ladder to reach the crown, Steve was walking back through the door with two mugs balanced easily in his hands, striding forward like the idea of spilling the contents was an impossibility. It couldn't have been Steve's intention to make Tony feel suddenly awkward, like all his limbs were the wrong length and walking was as difficult as skating on ice, but just one glimpse of Steve's easy grace always managed to evoke the sensation anyway.
"It's just," Steve says, throwing his shield at Stilt-Man's legs, and grinning when Stilt-Man comically falls on his ass, "there are all these fancy tasting menus, but they're fixed, so maybe it's better not to book one of those."
Tony huffed an amused noise, which obviously caused him pain. He brought up a hand to his heavily bandaged ribs. The incident had been seven weeks ago now; long enough for Steve's super body to not have a single scratch on it, but not long enough for Tony to be anywhere close to fighting strength yet. It turned out that Tony had lost nearly two liters of blood before Wanda had come in and managed to hold him in stasis until they could get him to the hospital. They were so lucky Tony hadn't died.
"Look, I don't care," Tony lied. They both knew it was a lie, but Tony was getting weary of this whole thing. "You have good reasons, I guess. Whatever those reasons are. So I'm just going to finish this, and then I'm going to get out of your hair. Okay?"
Tony was losing time. It was hard to figure out how, at first, but then he figured out how to notice it – he would blink, and the readings on the scanning panels would abruptly shift, or Steve would blur a little, even if he barely moved.
the stress like he usually did, like an actual weight on his shoulders. Who knew that kissing Steve was the balm he'd been missing his whole life?
"This," Steve murmured breathlessly, in-between kisses that lit up Tony's body so much he wondered whether he would be like those Christmas light display, visible from space, "this is what I wanted." Tony thought those words on their own would be enough to end him, but then Steve added, in a soft and tender whisper, "Shell-head,
Steve looks sourly over to the main door to the room: an intricate metal construction, with two-hundred safe dials embedded in it. Above the door is a legend painted in neat black letters: TO EXIT, SOLVE ME.
The house that Tony was 99.5% sure was Steve (Tony liked to include room for error in all of his beliefs) wasn't remarkable; white wooden fascias that matched the houses to both sides of it. A well-manicured, small lawn. A single-car garage to one side.
a mortal, fragile human like myself invincible. Predict what might happen and install countermeasures.″
"I did know about some of that stuff," Steve said, sounding flustered. "But she's not crawling age yet. And I meant to start, it's just—"
"You can get out," Steve returned, gently rocking Sarah, glaring at Tony. "I mean it. Get out. We're just fine without you. Get in your fancy car and
There's a pink cushion on the sofa. Steve picks it up and strips the cover from it. He throws the pink fabric out of the window. Gone, forever gone. There's a fire lit beneath him and he opens all the drawers and the closet; every pink item of clothing he owns joins the cushion cover's fate, littering be damned. A pink tie; two silky pairs of boxers; a t-shirt with a charity's name printed in bold capitals on the front. Another graphic tee has a logo with large black capital letters and even though it's innocent, Steve's vision blurs the text into TO EXIT, SOLVE ME, so that goes out the window too.
Tony was smirking a little bit, like it was pretty hilarious. Steve didn't realize until he saw what it was—a full suit, jacket and pants, and there was a tie and a shirt too. Steve blinked.
"Sixteen hours," Steve said, and Tony blinked. What? That—that didn't seem right to him. He could have sworn it had only been a couple of hours.
. Charms had been irritating him this year in general, and he tried and failed not to think about the teaching student that was their current Professor – Janet van Dyne. She was a prodigy, apparently. She was pretty much every Hogwart student's current crush, and somehow, she seemed to have an especially soft spot for Tony Stark. Steve inevitably spent most of Charms grinding his teeth and glaring at Professor Van Dyne for the friendly way she chatted to Tony, as compared to the brisk and professional way she talked to everyone else.
Steve vacillates back and forth for the whole week leading up to the third ball. It would be so easy to just forget it happened. Chalk it up to a wonderful dream. Tony would no doubt be able to slide it into the annals of his playboy adventures. Steve might only have been interesting to him
Steve forges on. This might be a better idea than he thought. "Well, it's not as invasive as trying to track someone down by their costume," he says, slowly. "If your mystery man approaches you, you'll know he's interested. And if he doesn't—" Steve shrugs. "Well, he's obviously not worth it."
"Well, that's kind of true—" Tony meant to laugh it off, but realization came, slow and like a slug to the gut. His mouth was suddenly dry and he had to swallow hard to get his next words out. Even so, they came out in a strained hiss. "It's a standard excuse, Steve. One I tend to give reporters so they leave with a relatively okay image of me, rather than pissed off with a handy deadline and column issues to take out their displeasure of being rejected."
″I'm so good at the rapid switch from superhero to CEO that I'm thinking about starting a quick-change act in Las Vegas,″ Tony joked.
"Happy," Steve repeated, nodding firmly. "I'll remember that too." His eyes darted from Tony in the Santa suit, to the cookies, and back to Tony. "It's nice to see you in a different suit, Shell-head. Suits you."
"I mean, I do, it just...collapses first," Iron Man says. "It's not like a suit of armor. It folds up."
He decides to confront Steve at the end of the meal, mostly because Steve's glaring moodily into his cup of coffee like it's deeply wronged him somehow.
Iron Man hesitates and then holds out his arm towards her. He probably means the gauntlet or forearm, but Jan grins as she steps in and squeezes his biceps.
Iron Man smiles and wow, Steve shivers just from seeing it. Even with the mask, Steve can tell he's ridiculously handsome. The idea of someone being this attractive and voluntarily covering themselves up all day is actually a little baffling; Steve would wonder whether he had the right person, except those thigh muscles are really distinctive.
Because on the other side of the teleportation platform, Steve was there, kneeling over Tony's unconscious body, looking absolutely distraught. Blue energy was crackling over the surface of Tony's armor.
"You could stay," Tony whispered, into the nape of Steve's neck. He was sweaty, starting to feel unpleasantly sticky with it. He was lying in the damp spot.
Tony's reputation was too much for Steve to be able to handle an actual public relationship. And maybe Tony wasn't perfect, but
Incendio, he knew the incantation, he knew how to summon the fire, he knew it to the core of his being. But he was tired, and Van Dyne had been flirting with Tony, and Tony had been flirting back, and this whisper of condescending kindness from Tony was too much to bear—
"More's the pity," Tony sighed and resisted the urge to rub his temples. "Two days to go and I'm still stuck what to get. Jan decided we should do Secret Santa this year."
"I need to pack that more open wound of yours, or you’ll bleed out on me before help gets here," Steve said. "Stay still. I’m gonna try and pull as much material from my under-suit as I can without widening your injury—" he smirked, "unless you have a first aid kit hidden in that suit of yours?”
Steve's heart aches. "Well. I refuse to leave here with you so sad." He leans in and solemnly offers Tony a gloved hand. "Dance with me?" He smiles a little, encouragingly. "It might cheer you up."
They didn't always get interrupted, but there were a few hairy moments of nearly being seen before Tony caught on to the fact that Steve had a little bit of a danger kink:
Tony pulled back slowly, staring at Steve in pleased surprise. Could it be that Steve was harboring feelings too? Surely he wouldn't have kissed Tony back like that if he wasn't feeling
"It's been busier than I would have chosen, perhaps," Steve inclined his head as he lowered himself into the offered chair. "I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I was hoping to get a word with Iron Man, if he was available."
When Tony appears in the kitchen this time, Steve promptly forgets how to function like a regular human being and ends up spitting coffee all over himself. Steve sags, looking at the mess. Sometimes he's so glamorous.
"What's distracting?" Steve asks, and turns in the direction McCoy is pointing to see one of Steve's favorite things about the twentieth century: Iron Man.
"You're beautiful," Steve says, the words shocked out of him, because he didn't know, Iron Man was always hidden away, how could he know? He flushes immediately, the heat a sharp contrast to the bite of cold air, and he panics that he's said the wrong thing, that beautiful isn't what you call someone in a moment like this one, but Iron Man's smile widens on hearing it, so maybe it's okay.
Then Tony took in the new scene in front of him and he made an involuntary noise, like something had wounded him, even though he felt nothing like this. Hunger, fatigue, desire,
Steve's face creased like he was having to puzzle through an unexpected math problem. "I guess I always assumed you brought people in to do it."
Tony slid his gaze slowly to Steve. It felt like half the oxygen had somehow been sucked from the room.
"I once sewed three million dollars' worth of diamonds into a headband," Jan says, "expensive isn't really part of the discussion here."
Steve nods, ready to tell Iron Man it's okay, only to suddenly feel like the entire floor has disappeared under his feet.
"Oh, I’m well aware of how screwed I am, Cap,” Iron Man’s voice hitched awkwardly midway, but he didn’t balk from finishing the sentence. "I mean, there’s no one to tell."
"Try not to smash anything until I'm done," Tony says. "It's so hard to pick glass shards out of the batter."
Everything was fine when Steve was right there, but at night, Steve sneaking away before dawn, Tony felt like he was nothing but a goddamn fool.
Iron Man creaked out a noise. "Well, I suppose I’m not." He exhaled noisily. "You know the real problem with this building?″
It understandably took a few moments for Tony to be able to talk again. Steve tried not to count the number of rapid, jagged inhales and exhales from Tony’s mouth as he waited.
"Of course I do," Jan dimples beneath her mask and then winks. "Thank you." She nods at the bar. "Do you want a drink?"
Tony was expecting to have to pull back quickly, blurt a terrible excuse, and then run. He was ready and braced to have to run to his car, to cry all the way home, to sob out his agony that he would never see Steve again, never mind all the other parts, all the other plans he'd had. He'd spent the last few months agonizing over how to ask Steve out on a date. Tony had been trapped in a cycle of planning to do so and failing; he'd failed only because it was
Or maybe he was about to agree. Tony didn't know. He blinked, and the world went fully black instead.
Tony glared at him. Of all the presumptuous bullshit. Steve really thought that if he and Tony had been dating, if Tony had known Steve had feelings for him… (and what the absolute fuck was this new bunch of shit, that Steve had
"What else was I supposed to do?" Tony folded his arms. "You didn't want to raise Sarah in a world where villains would steal your baby, so I...baby-proofed your house
Tony wasn't sure how running up and down stairs for a drink counted as pleasure, but he wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth, or a mug of hot, free coffee in its glorious glossy black surface.
But just because Steve had done it of his own volition didn't mean he'd done it happily. Steve would have told him why he was going, if everything was okay, surely? He hadn't, so it couldn't be okay. And if things weren't okay, then Tony needed to help. It was a simple if-then sequence.
Steve swallowed, and wrung his hands, and looked wretched. His silence was more than loud enough for Tony.
″I think all of us are scared all the time. I think that's what makes us human. The brave part is when you feel it and you suit up anyway.″
Steve shuffled, but nodded jerkily, a pleasant pink flush creeping up his neck. Tony pressed his smile into Steve's matching grin and kissed him thoroughly.
Happy was astutely staring at him. "You're a trial-and-error kind of guy, boss," Happy gestured at the glass. "Try it and see?"
There's a queue through the lobby of guests waiting to have their invitations checked. As Steve joins the line, his gaze catches on a bank of mirrors lining one of the walls; Steve almost doesn't recognize the person looking back at him. Steve doesn't look like himself. Something about the cut of the fabric makes his waist looks smaller, his shoulders broader. He feels like someone else. Honestly, he feels a little dangerous. Would any of the Avengers recognize him like this? He barely recognizes himself.
misfiring again," Carol's voice said, carrying stridently across the room to the storage closet. Carol had always been strong, but apparently her voice was powerful too; at least, it seemed to work on Steve, visibly instantly sobering him.
Steve had been brave, and Tony had to keep taking his cues from that; he opened his eyes and nearly cried out, because Steve's chair was empty, of course it was.
Sex in the evening is less common. Usually they fall asleep kissing, nowadays. It's just another language they speak, one someone watching (is someone watching? They don't know, they never know) wouldn't be able to decipher. When Steve kisses Tony, sometimes it's
Tony meant to drive off in a huff, but he got as far as the end of Steve's street before he braked sharply, folded his hands on his steering wheel, and whacked his forehead into them with a soft moan.
Steve was always impressed by people like Iron Man, and Iron Man’s benefactor Tony Stark was even more of the same. Both of them had a shiny exterior you had to look past to see the earnest and passionate person below. Steve was a dreamer like both of them. As a child he’d always dreamed of a better future—one that he could actively do his part for—but his dreams were fanciful leaps that blurred over the journey to land at the destination. He knew what he wanted, but the path to take him there was cloudy, and impossible to see. Men like Tony Stark were dreamers too, but Stark was special. He could see all the steps to
Between the continuous villain attacks, Pepper's aggressive diary-management, Janet van Dyne's planned public appearances for the Avengers, Tony's own annual holiday appointments, and various things going wrong at
"Yeah, Carol might not be too impressed," Tony narrowed his eyes at the mistletoe. "That probably shouldn't make me more inclined to hang it."
"Throw one more of these," Steve says, and then freezes. What the hell? He manages a coherent sentence, and it's that? He swallows hard, his throat dry. If his subconscious wants another shot, and if Tony's willing to go that far to oblige the strange request, then Steve has to commit to it. No excuses, this time. "Throw one more of these. I promise I'll be there."
"Glad you approve," Tony muttered back, before licking into Steve's mouth and trying not to delight at the muted noises Steve was making. "The others are just outside."
Tony got to his feet; he didn't want Steve to finish that sentence. "I installed a temperature guard on your water heater so it can't go above 120 degrees Fahrenheit, too." Tony nodded across at a wall with a phone outlet. "Once you get your phone line hooked up, make sure you get a wired landline phone. If the power goes out, you want to know you've got a phone working in an emergency. Y'know I'd come in a second, but even Iron Man can't get here faster than an ambulance."
Steve helped him put the tinsel on the tree next, before they both started to hang the individual decorations. A lot of them needed retying, or needed ribbon looping through holes. There was always something soothing about trimming a Christmas tree; Tony loved this part of his holiday tradition. It was nice doing it with Steve too, though. Maybe he'd been doing it alone for far too long. Maybe he'd been selfish to hold onto it as a solo task for all these years.
He killed the engine, pocketed his keys, exited his car, and stared at the house speculatively. Someone was home; there was light peeking through the curtain cracks in one of the ground floor rooms.
"Duck!" Tony yells, and throws Steve to one side to avoid being crushed under the wall that Avalanche has managed to completely dislodge.
It seemed to take more concentration to lean against objects. If that's really what Tony was doing. He tried flicking Carol in the nose, he tried punching Steve in the shoulder (there was some lingering frustration), and he tried slapping Strange across
Tony muttered about it all the way to Steve's house, but when he got there, Steve wasn't home. He must have taken baby Sarah out. Maybe to get her registered with a doctor, Tony thought victoriously. He considered bagging the items up and writing out a note, but then Tony re-thought it, jogged back to his car, pulled his toolkit out of his trunk, and promptly broke into Steve's house, picking the lock on the back door, internally sighing at the lack of bolts on that entrance.
Tony's worried gaze slips from Steve to the door, clearly worried about the Avengers emergency, and then back to Steve in confusion. "A third ball?" he questions.
," Steve said and pulled their entwined hands upward so he could press a kiss against Tony's knuckles. "You gave me
many—but all the facts that had jammed together were making a part of Steve’s brain start to scream inside his skull because if Tony was Iron Man, if Tony had been Iron Man all along, with his heart troubles—oh, god, his
Steve looked at her tentatively. Sharon wasn't shy when it came to lecturing Steve, especially when it came to Tony. He deserved whatever condemnation she was preparing in her head.
"Shit," Tony breathes, and Steve's panicking, because is something wrong? Did he do something wrong? Oh god, he knew he'd fuck up kissing somehow, or maybe Steve's mask has slipped?
"Well, I made your wife do all the official gifts from the company," Tony said. "I sent Morgan the annual hamper, although goodness forbid he doesn't deserve it this year, considering what he's been up to. But he's family all the same and I don't have a lot of that."
Another time, Tony divides their evening meal between all the crockery in the room like it's a fancy tasting menu; he puts on an astoundingly bad French accent and tugs one of the curtains (that cover nothing but wall) down to wear as an apron.
Extremis had felt like an extension of the sensation, and sometimes, Tony still felt an ache for it, even in this completely new bioengineered shell he called his body. Being around Steve felt like a call, the kind of call that Extremis used to provide answers for. Tony would have to continue to grow accustomed to that lack of a response; it wasn't like a manual existed that could tell someone how to cope with Phantom Operating System Syndrome.
Iron Man chuckled, which was immediately followed by a low hissing noise; he obviously regretted making that response. "Opportunistic of you, Captain."
"Eh, just—the holidays, you know. Not always the best memories for Gabe. I wanted to give him a good time, but—I dunno what to do, he's been so down recently." Robbie shook his head. "I'll figure it out."
The air is cold and Steve feels some of the dizziness seep away in the brightness of it. He turns to Iron Man to say something about how arresting the sight is, but his words die in his throat. Iron Man was made to stand here, in the moonlight, in that costume. The softer light does something to the silver embroidery in his tunic; those impressive muscles stand out even more alluringly in the shadows. And his smile trumps the beauty of the garden below them.
One day, Tony doesn't cook dinner, but takes the jar of strawberry jelly to the bed. While Steve has an
"I can look after her while you take a nap," Tony offered, feeling awkward. It was reasonable for Steve to be overwhelmed; he was obviously dealing with a lot, surprise babies and all.
Tony braced himself. It was one thing for Steve to figure it out and another to say it out loud. "Yes. I am Iron Man."
"Invitation?" Steve echoes, because he just took the larger envelope from Tony after breakfast without even asking about the contents, merely just with a promise to disperse them to the other Avengers after training was complete. Tony had smiled at him at that. He had a really nice smile.
But if Steve had the danger kink he seemed to, it didn't really explain the way he kept sneaking out of Tony's bedroom at different times of the night:
Steve smiled grimly, feeling zero amusement. Sometimes you just had to trick your fellow Avengers into admitting they were hurt.
"So he's been like this—" Jan said, her voice soft. She was sitting opposite Steve, holding Tony's other hand. That was nice. Even if Jan wasn't dating him, she was still his friend. She was still
It happened fast, that's what he knew for sure. If no one expected the Spanish Inquisition, what the fuck would they term an invasion of Dark Elves, because they had magic and callous mischief on their side and weren't afraid to copiously deploy both for maximum chaotic impact?
"You should tell him how you feel," Steve says, hoping he doesn't sound as jealous as he feels. God, jealousy, that's exactly what's going on right now. He's jealous of someone he's never met. The universe knows he doesn't have a right to be.
" Steve hissed, his gaze dropping nervously to a couple of businessmen approaching them on the sidewalk.
"I just—I don't think I like the idea of you doing this alone, in the small hours of the night, year-in, year-out." Steve put his mug down and squared his shoulders. "Now the cat's out of the bag, you
"Can I touch it?" Jan asks, stepping forward almost like she can't help herself before freezing, wincing at Iron Man apologetically.
Steve was sitting outside of the shower cubicles, on one of the low benches, wrapped up in a large blue towel, and he was crying.
"I'm glad I talked to you," Tony beams, picking up his coffee again, and pulling a face because it's cold now. "Oh, hey, you had a thing at the ball too, right?"
an invitation," Steve said, with a high-pitched laugh that could be joking, or might be hysteria, but either way, it did cause Steve to pull his hand away from Tony's and that was probably a good thing.
This was the last time he might ever see Steve again, if Steve had his way. Tony's eyes stung more than he wanted to admit. His vision swam a little. He made it safely onto Steve's doorstep before he turned around, inhaling sharply, readying himself to say a goodbye he wasn't ready to make.
No one seemed willing to support Tony either, so he did the next obvious step: registered himself as inactive too, so he had extra time to track Steve down. Okay, he felt a little guilty removing Iron Man from the active roster, because it would leave the team two short instead of just one, but getting Steve back was
"I think it'll be nice for all of us to have a night off," Vision says. "Healthy. Although I have no idea what one wears to or does at a masquerade ball."
Tony swallowed. "Did—Did Steve say anything to you about leaving?" His voice cracked a little on the last word.
Hank made a noise in the back of his throat. "Let's just—we'll assemble on the roof, ten minutes. Okay?" He shot Steve an accusing look. "Aren't you a little too old to be sitting on Santa's lap, Cap?"
He'd debated standing in the doorway like a creeper and watching Steve spar with a hologram opponent – there was something pleasant about the way Steve's muscles shifted under his skin when he dodged and wove – but he was a big fan of dramatic entrances.
There was a lightness in Tony's voice that made it evident to Steve that Tony was expecting something lighthearted in response. A charity fundraiser. Some sort of embarrassing or exhausting Avengers business; of the kind that Steve didn't like to do alone. Like fill in reams of paperwork for the city.
Calm. Tony had to stay calm and in control. That was the plan. Steve was open with him in a way he only was around Iron Man. Around
"It's an invitation to a masquerade ball!" Jan shrieks. "Oh, gosh. Wow. I haven't been to one of Stark's Masquerade Balls in
"I can take it back," Tony offered, suddenly stricken with sadness. Steve had deserved something more thoughtful, something that fit him better. Steve deserved the world and Tony had given him cheese? "I can return it, get you something else."
far from his body, so he kept his hand in front of his face and concentrated hard on staying on the steps; it was only when he got to the shower floor that Tony realized that he was technically about to perve on Steve in the showers.
everything properly – but Tony used the opening to drag him into another passionate kiss. Right out there in the open. Where anyone could see.
Steve winked at Tony, smiled, and turned to head to the door. Hank followed him. Tony stayed seated a while, then rose to his feet, grabbed his briefcase from the counter Happy had put it on, and headed off to get changed. No rest for the wicked, Tony supposed.
Steve grinned mischievously. Tony found himself helplessly grinning back. Steve had such a nice smile.
When Steve wakes up, Day 492, it's to the sight of Tony's back. Tony's curled up in a fetal position. He looks so young like this. Steve shudders.
He thought about all the charms and curses he'd been dodging all week, designed to push him into weird parts of the school. Steve had blamed Tony. Tony had protested his innocence. Tony had been right all along.
As the cameraman and sound guy packed their equipment away, the reporter lingered, twirling her hair in one finger, and Tony smiled winningly. This wasn't an unusual occurrence for him.
Understanding washed through Tony in a warm wave and he almost laughed; he was able to choke it back because Steve did look utterly miserable and Tony was sure laughter would be misinterpreted. Steve somehow thought… Tony was out of his league? Well, that would be a misunderstanding that Tony could easily clear up. And he could, Tony thought. Steve wouldn't be this messed up if he didn't believe it. Steve, for some perplexing reason, was actually into him—both of him.
Steve ignores her, mainly because he's weirdly jealous. Iron Man's his friend. He should have been the one to—Wait, that's a weird train of thought. Iron Man is his partner in fighting, not in anything else, but seeing Jan touch him like that...huh. Jealous is the right word, apparently. Steve feels heat rising to his cheeks a little and he's glad no one's looking his way. He knew Iron Man was his favorite person in this decade, but he hadn't realized he might like him more than just as a friend or a colleague.
"We've been trying to get you alone," Sharon said. Her voice seemed odd, stilted; her eyes seemed a little glassy. She tilted her head sharply. "You're trouble, Steven Rogers."
Tony barely hesitated – he grabbed his briefcase, a change of clothes, the biggest first-aid kit he could find, his toolkit – and he left the tower. He didn't leave a note for the Avengers to let them know where he was going, because they hadn't been concerned enough – in Tony's opinion – that Steve had left without one. He did wave up cheerily at the tower's security cameras as he left.
"Of course," Tony said. "Bring them in." He grimaced apologetically at Steve. "This will only take a minute. Then I'll get Iron Man for you."
There had been moments before between them that had felt somewhat charged, conversations that Steve and Iron Man had shared that went into the small hours, but nothing had felt close to this. This was insane. This was
The man laughed. "You've got a wand, boy, and you literally appeared out of thin air. I wasn't born yesterday."
Steve had obviously already given permission for them to join in the decorating: a Tony of ten minutes ago might have taken umbrage at Steve taking such a liberty, but
Tony's shoulders are tense. "He promised he'd be here. And it's—it's so dumb to be upset that he isn't. It's just—I don't know why I'm so upset about it." Tony makes a noise that Steve hates. "It is what it is, I guess."
"It's not like I could stay in New York," Steve defended. "What would my odds be, to keep her safe, the moment supervillains realized I had a child? She would instantly become a target." He shook his head. "I know you'd have done your best to keep her safe, but you can't protect her from
Perplexingly, although Steve had haunted his side every moment while he was unconscious, he was nowhere to be seen now Tony was awake. Tony would be more peeved, if he was on fewer painkillers, and if he didn't have a sneaking suspicion as to why Steve was avoiding him.
There wasn't much space between their faces, Tony realized. It would only take the slightest movement. It would only take the slightest moment of bravery. He could close his eyes and press forward and they—they would be kissing. Tony would be kissing Steve. Was that a thought that he should be having during a waking hour? He didn't know. Words felt impossible. Steve's lips were parted a little and his chest was heaving like he'd run a mile, like he
Steve hummed under his breath as he thought about that. Tony, who was actually Iron Man. Tony, whose own exterior was a little rougher than usual from his injuries, but underneath he was brave, and
Steve focused on following Tony’s instructions to retrieve the aforementioned strip of fabric. When Steve’s fingers slowly closed in on it, Steve couldn’t believe it was the right object—it felt like just a tiny piece of foil.
Steve let out a breath that tasted metallic. He swallowed back some of the blood, trying not to pull a face at the sourness flooding his mouth. Steve
"I know this is scary," Tony muttered under his breath. "But I'm your friend and we're going to get through this together."
"Your energy is too chaotic for this ritual," Strange said. "Be patient. He's here. The readings are clear."
"Out with it," Tony said, lifting up the bunch up to the door frame and securing it with a piece of duct tape, a.k.a. the substance that kept the universe together.
"1872, of course," the man said. He smiled at Steve and held out a broad hand, seemingly missing the shock on Steve's face. "I'm Isaac Stark."
"Whoever you are," Steve called out, and Tony glanced up from the drawer he was working on to see Steve had put Sarah down and had a hockey stick outstretched in both hands. Huh. Tony could have sworn Steve was more of a baseball kind of guy.
"You know what this means?" Carol smiles at Iron Man. "You can come to the ball out of the armor and your identity would still be safe."
physical. That sudden stab of pain must be entirely psychological, and Tony hated it, because it had happened the moment he realized that Steve was gone from Tony's bedside.
Tony's worried that while they're repeating, the world outside is changing. The Avengers must have given up on finding them now.
Steve's eyes felt hot. He'd just been angry, that was all, that Tony had dragged them all into this war. It didn't have to be that way. Tony should have just—
"Tony," Steve said, gently, and yeah, okay, that did come out a little bitter. But what else could Tony be, but resentful? Steve had gone, for
braced himself to see what Steve was carrying carefully in his arms: a small baby, wrapped in a white blanket, fast asleep.
They fuck across the spectrum of lovemaking: warm and tender on days when they feel like they're making progress; aggressive and hard on days when one of them feels hopeless and trapped. Steve spends an hour one day just pinning Tony with his thighs and jerking off against his stomach, thrilling at the feel of Tony's eyes, dark and locked on his the whole time. Tony doesn't even clean off Steve's cum; just slips his shirt back on and wanders around their tiny room stinking of Steve's arousal all day; Steve ends up tackling him to the bed earlier than usual, rutting into Tony like he'll die if he doesn't.
Tony bristled. Steve wasn't the team leader any more; that job had fallen – and fallen well – to T'Challa and he was doing excellently. Tony barely ever felt resentful when T'Challa gave him an order. Well, sometimes the orders chafed, but that disconnect was due to Tony's beautiful personality, not any particular flaw on T'Challa's behalf. As leaders went, T'Challa was... acceptable. It was a rare person indeed that Tony considered as worthy of taking orders from.
After testing the lights and wrapping them around the tree, Tony levered the lid off the next box and pulled a face. He'd left a list for Bethany to finish acquiring some of the things he needed – fresh tinsel was always necessary, because somehow it never survived the season – but apparently she'd added mistletoe into the mix and there was a tray of it nestled above the tinsel with a post-it note saying "Enjoy!" Maybe he should fire her, especially because she'd added a little pink-highlighter heart to the note, but that would be a mean thing to do considering the season. And also dumb, because despite the Controller incident, Bethany was the best damn Head of Security he'd had for a long time. Tony pulled out a sprig and frowned at it.
"It's just—what you said to her." Steve gritted his teeth and looked into the distance, clenching and unclenching one hand. "That you were seeing someone."
Steve," Carol said, using the media's sensational nickname for that perverted version of Steve that had upsettingly rocked the world for way too long, rolling her eyes for every syllable of it.
Tony could feel his chest tightening. He felt dizzy and light-headed and off-kilter, like his foundations had subsided and the whole world was at a tilt.
