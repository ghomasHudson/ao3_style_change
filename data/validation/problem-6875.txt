Tony was quick to nod his head. Was he supposed to give up on the chance to spend more time with Steve? "Yeah. Sure. Sounds good."
“I wanted to see if you were gay or, uh, into that?” Harry said, sounding like it was ending in more of a question.
“No, because I don’t want Peter around this town longer than necessary. Not everything is always about you.” Then he was storming out of the house and slamming the door shut behind him.
"I was getting a look around," Steve explained, walking over to the cabinet he had seen the coffee pods in that morning. This house had a Keurig machine, and even though Tony hated instant coffee, it would have to do. "I met one of our neighbors that lives across the street. Here."
That meant Peter was in trouble. Steve pulled himself out of the water, not bothering to cover himself up anymore. He'd been naked before in front of dozens of men in the Army. It was different in front of Tony, but if Peter needed help, he wasn't going to hesitate.
"I'm sorry. I'm sure you two will make up soon. I've seen you both together." Harry jumped off his bike and started walking next to it.
“Yeah. I thought it was already obvious we don’t like you, and I don't think you’re worth our time. Only reason why you’re here is because my son is friends with your son, and he’s worried about how he’s treated. You already confirmed his worries.”
"Happy says most of them are in the compound. Maybe they're trying to fix things? Don’t you wanna help?"
After he pulled the sweatpants back on, he pulled out his phone from the pocket and picked up. He sounded a little frustrated, understandably so, when he snapped, "Hello?"
They held eye contact for a long moment, neither moving, just breathing heavily and staring before the ring tone continued and they were dragged back into the real world.
"Good. And the other hand holds mine like that...and I put my hand here…" Tony wrapped a hand around the back of Steve's neck, the bottom of his hair tickling his hand.
Steve guessed it might have had something to do with his and Harry’s relationship, though he couldn’t be sure. He rubbed Peter’s back gently and pressed his lips to the top of his sweaty curls. Thankfully, Tony was too distracted with Harry to notice. “You’re gonna be okay, bud. Dad and I got you.”
He'd have to do some more digging. And call May again. He loved gossiping about the kid to his aunt. Tony usually liked to do it on May's couch with a bottle of wine between the two of them while Peter was at Ned's house for a sleepover, but a video call would suffice.
Tony wasn't sure why he offered that. Steve didn't know May, and he wasn't as involved in Peter's life as Tony was. But maybe part of Tony wanted him to be? And by the way Steve hesitated, it seemed he wanted to be as well.
“You’re welcome, Harry. I’m sorry it ended like this, but please,” he said, keeping his voice low, “don’t be afraid to call us or come over anytime you need.”
Evalyn looked just as she did when she was hanging around the neighborhood. Her long, wavy blonde hair cascaded down her shoulders and back. Her makeup was done perfectly, giving her lips a bright red color. Her bodycon dress that clung to her body left nothing to the imagination and showed off every curve.
"I'm not coming out until you leave," Peter said, making Tony's smile falter. He tried not to let that bother him.
"I love that kid," Tony mumbled, mostly to himself as he pulled the first one of Steve's he saw. "He's going to be the death of me, I swear."
Steve felt bad for Peter...the kid was humiliated by mistaking Steve and Tony for his real parents, and Tony probably wouldn't let him forget it any time soon.
Norman narrowed his eyes at him, and Steve felt a sudden rush of protectiveness run through him. He had to bite back a growl.
Tony didn't comment on it while Peter got the movie ready, and when Steve came back with three plates of sandwiches, it all made sense.
Especially when their bodies were so close and their hands lingered after every touch in the popcorn bowl when they reached for some at the same time. This was better than any other Netflix and Chilling.
Peter winced when he heard Tony calling his name down the hallway. “Well, I better get going. But I’ll see you tomorrow, Captain Rogers!”
“Please? I’ll wear a helmet!” Peter amped his puppy dog eyes to eleven. Tony was weak when it came to his big eyes and pout.
Tony was pulled from his thoughts when he heard that voice. It didn't click at first who it was because he hadn't even seen her more than a few moments last night. And, she wasn't supposed to be
Steve waved to every person he passed, whether they were bringing in the paper, getting in their car, or taking a morning walk. It was weird to be in such a normal neighborhood.
He turned around and took Steve's hands in his effortlessly. He lowered one of Steve's hands around his waist. His hand was rigid until Tony said, "Relax, Steve."
Maybe that was the reason why he was so against the idea of Steve going over there, even if it was for their mission. He was just a concerned teammate.
“Even though I don’t like to-- ugh,” Peter groaned through another wave of nausea. He wasn;t sure if it was the alcohol’s fault or the topic of conversation. He tried again. “Even though I don’t like to do sex?”
"Is everything alright?" She asked, sounding a bit concerned. "He called me last night. He said he was fine."
but I think we've done a damn good job raising our son," Tony argued. The claws were out. Norman made a mistake by making a comment about Peter.
Tony narrowed his eyes and threw open the front door, storming down the stoop. “Roger, what the hell do you think you’re doing?”
Tony frowned. "This is nothing to laugh at. He was fine. Singing and dancing one second, and then the next, he was snapping at us and storming to his room."
Steve narrowed his eyes for a long moment before he turned around and headed back for the front door.
"You were in the corner, glancing around. You have a history. It's not hard to connect dots, boy." Klaus narrowed his eyes, slamming the rabbit on the table.
"And we'll try our best, Pete," Steve started in a unsure voice. He sounded nervous, which was something Tony didn't think was possible.
"Don't stress it," she said with another laugh. "And don't take it personally. I get that at least once a month. I'm surprised you've never seen it...he can get pretty angry."
“We'll keep an eye on him,” Tony promised, wrapping his arm around Peter to pull him in close. After a long day of too many emotions, it’s exactly what Peter needed, so he curled against him for a hug.
Tony's eyes widened at Steve's innocent smile. Tony wondered if Steve knew what Netflix and Chill really meant. "Honestly? I'd love to Netflix and Chill."
Peter turned around, and all of his previous annoyance at Steve was gone. Of course, Steve wasn’t trying to hurt Tony purposely with this mission. He was a
Peter didn’t know how many drinks it took but soon, he was finally feeling pretty good. It was almost like when he took the pain medication after a bad injury, but this time, Tony wasn’t there to babysit him. Though, Harry had taken his place.
“No!” Peter shouted before slapping a hand over his mouth. He didn’t want Tony or Steve to hear him, come in, and ruin the moment. “I mean, no-- don’t leave.”
Yeah, it sounded pretty stupid to Tony to, but he wasn’t sure what else would be the reason. He had spent the entire afternoon thinking about it when he was interrupted by the sound of a motorcycle engine coming up in front of the house.
“This is your room.” Tony’s voice was still tense from speaking to Steve. “There’s a bathroom right next door. My bedroom is across the hall if you need anything.”
“Obviously it’s a problem since you’re getting so worked up about it.” Steve took a step closer, and he crossed his big arms over his even bigger chest. He towered over Tony, and Tony knew if he wanted to, he could snap him in half without even trying. Maybe at one time, after Siberia and before this mission, Tony would have flinched if Steve had come so close to him like that. But now, there was another feeling deep in his gut when Steve invaded Tony’s personal space.
Tony glanced around and sure enough, Thomas was watching them from across the street. He was smirking over at Tony, and their conversation about divorce. He only grew angrier, and Tony didn’t even know who he was mad at anymore.
“I saw the rabbit in the window, and I really wanted it,” Peter replied. “I didn’t think he’d accuse me of stealing.”
from the bedroom." Tony shook his head. "While we wait him out, I'm actually gonna call the kid's aunt. Check in with her to see how she handles...
Steve noticed Peter paused his scooping as he filled half of his plate with it. "I wasn't aware food had an age range."
“We don’t know for sure, Peter,” Steve replied. “I’d rather be safe than sorry when it comes to you.”
Steve kneeled by the two of them and tried to get a better look at Peter. He was covered in sweat and his face was pale. There was some vomit on his chin as well as the front of his shirt. Steve pulled him forward from Harry’s arms, but he immediately started to struggle. He had to be careful to not drop him on the dirt ground.
“If he was Hydra, I could handle myself. I’m Spider-Man.” Peter was glaring out the window with a little pout.
Peter’s eyes widened as he tried to think of what he could have done wrong. "What’s wrong? Why don't you want to kiss me?”
“That’s Steve’s,” Tony answered, and Peter knew something was wrong by his tone. “He bought it this morning because he wanted to.”
"None of us do," she replied. "Especially Peter. But don't worry. He'll come out soon and apologize. He always does."
Evalyn obviously had business in the city, and if she managed to run into Peter again after their fake cover story of his disappearance, then she’d start to ask questions.
“It’s not fine,” Tony huffed before turning back to Steve. “You put a hand on him again, and I’ll kill you. Got that?”
show you how to dance." So, what if he was just finding another reason to be close to Steve? Anybody in his situation would.
Norman grunted before grabbing Harry by the arm to yank him out of the house. Peter intended to follow after them to get Norman to loosen his hold on Harry, but before he could go, Tony grabbed his hand and pulled him to his side. Steve glanced at them before following Harry and Norman.
“Nope. He is Roger. I am Dad. You are Benjamin. Benjamin, you are not to leave this house unless you are with me. You are to stay out of our Hydra business because I do not want to worry about you getting kidnapped and tortured in someone’s basement.”
"He's always so polite," Tony said honestly. "He had an off moment. I brought up his bullies, and apparently he didn't want to tell Captain America about that."
He could just barely hear Harry talking to someone...his dad, he said? But his dad was dead...years ago. Maybe he thought Mr. Stark was his dad? Peter chuckled a little at that idea. He would make a good dad.
Tony returned Peter's back to the case and flipped through the small collection they had. He smiled when he saw a few of his own music.
Getting some sounded really good right now, actually. Being underneath a big, strong man who had the ability to crush him if he wanted to but instead chose to be gentle sounded like the perfect way to release all of this pent up frustration. He wanted a hand-- like Steve's size-- to trail down his chest and caress his belly lovingly before wrapping around his member while he looked into this deep blue eyes and--.
"He never left the premises with that ugly thing, so you have no case. Let him go or else I will," Steve warned.
He wanted to go out and start his day with a run, but he still hadn’t unpacked his clothes yet. He didn’t want to have to dig through it all right now, so he decided that making breakfast would be a good use of his time.
"No...by the time I was old and healthy enough...there wasn't a soul within 100 miles that wanted to dance with me."
Peter groaned, wanting to scream that they weren’t his dads. He didn’t have a dad anymore. Or a mom. He wasn’t a normal kid like everyone else here. He had to worry about the world ending and a terrorist group trying to kill him. For one night, he just wanted to worry about curfew and his tolerance.
Also, I've had the scene with the garage and wild sex comment written for over a year. It was 1/2 scenes I wrote immediately when thinking of this story.
Tony's eyes flickered over to Steve, though he wasn't as offended by it as Peter was. "So, you were…?"
“Good...well, I’m gonna head to bed. You should too. We’ve got a long day tomorrow of figuring out cover stories and all that fun stuff.” Tony walked towards the bedroom door, and opened it up quietly.
His shower was quick, just long enough to wash the sweat off of his body, and then he was grabbing his clothes off of the shower stall door and getting dressed. It was a little cramped, but he wasn’t too comfortable with getting dressed in the middle of the backyard.
To prove his point, Peter pushed forward and kissed him deeper, shoving his tongue forward. Still, there was no reaction from below his belt. Peter grunted and tried to kiss him more, but Harry pushed him away again. “Ben, stop.”
“Looks like just on the face.  On your goatee. If you are able to shave and not let it touch your skin, you should be fine.”
“Rhodey-bear, this is awful. Usually I can keep my cool, but everything is overloading and I want to simultaneously bawl and beat the shit out of everything.”
“Because I told you everything that would happen, and you still left!  Why would I think you would trust me now when you couldn’t even trust me then?”
Unfortunately, his live-in captor was a supersoldier and impervious to silverware.  Tony kept his supplies hidden for the time being as he continued to contemplate how he could use the arc reactor to his advantage.
They both laugh.  Bucky gives him one last hug before stepping into the cryotube.  T’Challa shakes Steve’s hand before the supersoldier makes his way back to the Quinjet, Tony in forced tow.  Their flight back to the small apartment in Moscow is spent in silence.
Taking in their surroundings, Tony determined they were on the Quinjet.  His heart pounded in his chest as turned toward the cockpit.
“Stop complaining about your big tits, Stark.  Cup size can cause a bit of contention amongst us girls.”
Barnes sat frozen as Tony flipped the blankets and scrambled toward him until he was knee-to-knee with his parents’ killer, reaching fingers shaking as they went to clench the man's nonmetal hand.
“Or we could put on a movie?  Never got around to seeing...how did you describe it again?  ‘Idiots bring back dinosaurs and are surprised when they turn into breakfast.’  Cretaceous Park? Bet Peter will say it’s another one of those really old movies.”  Chuckling, Steve stands and points to the remote on the coffee table.
Rogers forced Pepper out the door, looking back briefly at the crumpled man on the living room floor.
Steve pushed ahead, not noticing Tony's creased forehead and drooping expression.  Tony pinned a grin back on his face when Natasha pushed him forward and linked their arms.
James felt the other man smile into his shirt.  With a sigh, Tony pulled his legs up on the couch and settled in after a heavy wave of exhaustion hit him.  He closed his eyes and counted with the other’s heartbeat until he was asleep.
agree with those awful rules that take away your ability to do whatever the hell you want, you had to come and fix everything yourself!  And in doing so, you left me alone. ‘Avengers are as much mine as they are yours,’ hah.” Staring at the broad chest level with his gaze, Tony takes a few deep breaths as practiced before closing his eyes.
“We have made it very clear this is a definite requirement in our contract with the American government.  No lawsuit can be made against our organization regarding this agreement without consequences. The board of SI also signed a declaration acknowledging your inability to be impartial on this matter.” Tony swung his fist, but Steve caught his punch midair and squeezed.
“Do you see someone?  The astral plane has been out of sync since that day. I am not detecting anything, but that doesn’t mean--”
Tony raises an eyebrow at Steve.  The blonde almost seems to smirk before his lips thin.  He takes Tony by the arm and walks them over to the Quinjet.
Hope you enjoyed.  HYDRA Steve is a monster.  Still need to write out some of his back history so y'all can get a better idea where his evil assholery is coming from.  The back history will overall be original and not based on Secret Empire (as I have not read it yet).  I may have a weak moment and buy it to read (okay I'll definitely cave because reading comics on the Marvel Comics app is amazing).
Tony tugged again, but Barnes stayed seated. He took the supersoldier’s wrist in his wrapped hand before pulling again, teeth grinding and cheeks tight with pain.
He put on one of his older Iron Maiden tees, happy the cotton sank down past his hips.  As suggested, he rearranged himself under the shirt before looking back up to the two woman, completely exasperated.
Even as they part, Steve pecks Tony’s hairline, cheek, ear, chin, never pulling back long enough for Tony to change his mind.  He mouths the soft part of Tony’s neck and bites gently, sighing heavily into his skin.
Tony exchanges the flat beer for the tablet next to him.  He starts sifting through his backed-up work emails, blatantly ignoring the judgy sigh and stare across from him.
Rogers throws his shield to knock over the last of the aliens on the street before he runs up to his armored colleague.
“File created, sir. I expect you want this to stay on your private server under a nonsensical title.”
“No.”  Tony forces his face up.  Steve’s hand lingers, fingers shifting through his curls as his expression darkens.
“I am relieved we found him alive.  I must admit, my faith in you is shaken, Captain Rogers.  After watching this man fight for your freedom and safety, I can now see that the respect was not mutual.”
“Hey, Pete.  Are you here for your new suit?  I have to start from scratch this round, so it won’t be ready for a couple of days...”
“I don’t deserve you.”  Steve tries to smile as he gets up and makes a bed of hay for them.  He helps Tony lie down after they both pull up their pants and is careful as he hugs Tony to his chest.
The call ends and Friday’s voice crackles into silence.  Tony retracts his armor, stare roaming the alien spaceship until he sees a familiar figure.  He huffs and turns, walking down the narrow metal stairs, not looking back to see if Steve is following him.
“I cleared the guns and knives out of the ship while you rested.  Your AI will no longer take commands from you. Barton and Romanoff confirmed Fury was out of the picture.”  Tony struggled for a short time before the hands holding him tightened to the point of tears. Steve watched as the smaller man dropped his head, letting his dark curls fall against the front of his oppressor’s shirt.
“No.  Get out.”  Tony unbuttons his dress shirt and discards the crumpled blue Brioni on the bench next to him.  He pushes the reactor into the ready made metal hole in the center of his undershirt and grabs for the open-faced watch in front of him.  Strapping the prototype on his wrist, Tony reaches for the right screwdriver, but another hand beats him there and covers the tool.
Tony hears Peter murmuring next to him as he stares at Steve’s drained features.  Barnes looks up and stares down the empty hall.
“Noted.  Come on--we need to let the boys know your status.  Hopefully Viz is trying to contact the J’naii to figure out what the hell they did to you.  Have you come up with any ideas?”
“It should have been me.”  The mechanic drops the wrench he’s holding as the screens around them go dark.  He will not look at Peter as his ears echo with the dead wizard’s deal and final words before they all disappear to ash.  He feels that dagger still in his belly as a large hand pats his head, whispering the future and promising Tony freedom from the consequences of his knowledge.
“That being said, if what you say is true about Stephen sacrificing the stone for your life, perhaps you're meant to know.  I do not know how to use the power of the Eye, but this may.”
“My mom--”  Tony fumbles with his fork, cutting into the yolk of his egg to let the center soak the surrounding toast and refusing to look back up to his stilled companion, “--her secret ingredient was rosemary.”
“Buck? The king can help with the brainwashing.  He's waiting outside. Just bring him this trash after I--oh, here we go.” Steve puts a bandana out of his back pocket ties the cloth tightly around Zemo’s leaking lips before pulling him up by his broken wrist and tossing him over to Barnes.  His friend nods before he hauls his prisoner up and heads to the exit, ready to escape his doubled allies.
“I’m…”  He wants to push Steve off of him and head to his workshop haven, but his hands won’t stop trembling even when he focuses.  The memory of his fingers being grey and feathered with dust clouds his thoughts and all he can do is stare down at his blurry fingers.  Another set of hands help him steady his own, warm and calloused. Tony pushes forward and presses his forehead against Steve’s solid (
“Because you discovered that HYDRA operatives make up 42% of the SHIELD workforce and are planning to seize control of the organization in the next week?”
“Let me take a look.”  Steve takes the letter from his hands.  He looks down, then suddenly his grip is tight and his arms are shaking.
“I don’t want to hear it!”  Steve tries to put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, but he rolls it off and shoots him a glare as the kid rambles his excuse, sounding more desperate with each word.
“I'm sorry, Tony. Just--give me a minute, then I'll fill you in on what you have forgotten.  I want to remember this before you hate me again.”
Hopefully you like?  I got some plans for Samwise as well as Buckaroo, Peps, and Rhode-sauce.  Plot will pick up pretty quickly with the next chapter!!  (WILL write and post sometime this week!!)
“Not hungry.  Also been having issues eating ever since you drugged my lunch and brought me to this hellhole.”
Steve smiled at his friend.  He allowed himself one more long look at the bedroom door, remembering the feel of the soft skin of Tony’s belly after they had bathed together.  He dropped the memory and tore his gaze away, nodding at the two next to him before he left.
“One of SHIELD’s swat teams back in the day came across this gunk.  Of the four exposed, two did not make it back to base. The pair that returned told us how they cured themselves.”
Tony fights the rising bile in his throat.  The shade sits next to him, and Tony cannot stop the flinch when he feels a hand rest on his arm.
“HYDRA successfully took over SHIELD.  We seized the Fridge yesterday and have begun sorting through the artifacts and transferring them to Stark Tower.  I have...negotiated with the CEO to align Stark Industries with SHIELD in order for both to collectively prosper.”
Barnes got up and left.  Tony let himself smile, but this hope died in his chest when the man returned with a book and blanket.
“Just a joke, Rogers.  Get with the twenty-first century and open that conservative little mind of yours to flaming boys in lacy dresses and butch gals asking other gals for some sweet sweet love.”  Tony gives Steve his regular
.  All of the heavy emotions trapped in his chest made his frame shake.  His fury fought against the supersoldier’s tight clutch as the silent clip played in his mind again, and he watched the car crash into the tree, his father break beneath the man’s metal fist, and his mother struggle against those plated fingers--
“Why would you let me say all that embarrassing shit, knowing what had actually happened?  Why did you come and get me? You should have let me die there, Rogers. That's obviously what I wanted.  Let me the fuck go!”
“Because I don’t know if there’s anything wrong with you!  It’s been over a year and you have yet to share what you’re dealing with!”
“Chill. Here--take this and make some prototypes. Your ass needs to get in gear if we're going to win the war.”  Tony pops the reactor out of his chest and hands it to the mechanic before pulling out his backup bit from the depths of his jeans and snapping the smaller unit into position.
“If you had been, you would be dead.  The Winter Soldier did not fail to eliminate a target.  On the rare occasion where he lost his opportunity on the first attempt, my handlers put me back on ice and scrambled my brain some more before sending him off again.”
Tony feels like he should be appalled, but he’s smiling along with Steve.  He kisses the blonde before he reaches to touch his own face and moans.
“It's for the best. We'll let Rogers fill you in on that particular set of skeletons hidden in his closet.”  He throws Captain America a dark glare before he advances to the steel wall protecting the Sokovian.
Tony heard the door close and lock in place before his lungs gave out and he conceded to unconsciousness.
“Stupid bastard probably knew what I would find when he convinced me to join this stupid organization.  I'm a billionaire. Why the hell am I here digging up government agency secrets? I could be on a beach. Drinking.”
“I’ll bet three.  Also, if Clint visits, he will definitely throw something heavier than a cup at him.  Maybe the cast iron skillet?”
Rogers releases his hand.  Tony starts to back away when he is pulled forward and pressed against the supersoldier's strong chest.
“Don’t act like you didn’t know, Rogers.”  Tony pushes forward, hands going for the zipper of Steve’s pants.  He pushes everything down before he drops to his knees and takes Steve’s half-hard member in his mouth.
“Maybe. You'll just have to wait and see.”  Steve leaned down and kissed Tony as the smaller man pouted.
“My mom had planned for me to join them for that holiday excursion, but I convinced her otherwise.   Was I also part of your original kill order?”
Tony opens his eyes to Steve’s creased features.  He ignores the large hands reaching out to him and stumbles back to his stool.  He rests his stinging arms on the surface of his work bench and folds over, unable to stop the sobs that follow.  He ignores the arms he feels wrap around his chest from behind. He ignores the warm body he feels pressed to his back.  He ignores the fingers he feels making small circles against the arc reactor on his shirt and he ignores the soft murmurs of apologies echoing in his ears until he’s asleep.
“I-I’ve, f-fuck Steve, I’ve had a crush on you since I met you.  I had to invite everyone else to move in so you would too, asshole.  Don’t tell me you didn’t--
“No.  I’ll deal with it.  I wish you wouldn’t go back into the ice so quickly.  I could use a friend.”
“No.  I only remember before and now.  Apparently we're married?” Steve raises his free hand to show Tony the gold and crimson band. Tony looks down at their joined fingers and notices a similar band with a bit of blue built in and platinum replacing the gold.
“Mr. Stark, you’re a mechanic, remember?  Mister Strange told you he saw one future where we won.  What if this had to happen first?”
“Next time you see him, Tony will be a new man.  The Tesseract seems to have that effect of people.”
Tony slowed their pace, leveling his gaze on the group down the hall. He wiped his wet finger on his dress pants, ignoring the residual heat traveling up his arm.
She watched as Tony struggled to sit up. He gritted his teeth and started to say something, but the horrified look on Pepper's face made him exhale instead.  He bent back over and tried to breathe.
“Yeah.  I do.” This Steve in front of him is so familiar and not familiar at the same time.  Tony reaches up and brushes his fingernails against his cheek down to his neck, feeling Steve swallow as he takes the back of his skull and leans forward.
Tony jets to the center of town when he hears Steve's chopped words.  The supersoldier is surrounded with Barnes at his back, the animated wolves attacking from nearly every direction.  The extra red on his uniform freezes the air in Tony's lungs as he steers toward them.
Barnes looked down at their joined hands.  He let his grip go lax, twisting his wrist until his palm was face up and curling his fingers around Tony’s knuckles.
“You have corrected me several times stating that this is not a ransom situation, and yet you refuse to release the Stark Industries chairman to our custody.”
Tony spent the next week trying to escape the HYDRA nightmare that was Steve Rogers.  Every chance he had, Tony either stole sharp utensils from the kitchen or attempted to hack the single landline in the house or the front (and only) entrance. While he had yet to successfully make a phone call or an escape, Tony kept his collection of steak knives and metal forks under the bedroom carpet. The bundle of tiny weapons was neatly hidden under the foot of the king bed frame.
Please leave kudos or a comment with your feedback!  I love the responses and it keeps me motivated to continue.  ^_~
Wong looks exhausted when Tony visits him.  The New York Sanctum is cleared of debris and bears a patched roof and repaired floor.  The sorcerer fashions them a pair of plush chairs at the entrance of a gated library.
“Tell me about the Time Stone.” Tony leans forward in his seat, failing to keep his gaze away from the young boy standing behind his companion. Wong follows Tony's gaze to the empty space behind his chair.  He sways his hands until a burning circle appears before him, muttering some words before the magic disappears. He turns back to Tony.
“You don’t want to know what happens otherwise.  We better hurry. Are we done here? Hawkeye, Black Widow--you got this covered?”
Hammer held up his hands placatingly. “No, of course not. We wouldn't be creating weapons, not at all, just the
“I’m so sorry I crashed your date, I was gonna go to Avengers tower to get help, I swear, but it’s so far away, and the longer we wait the more damage -”
Steve wants nothing more than to give them time to recover and rest, but that’s a luxury he can’t afford right now.
When they called a cab for their ride back, Steve opened the door for Tony without even thinking about it. He froze when he realised what he was doing, but Tony laid a hand on his arm and squeezed lightly. “You’re good.’’
Peter eyes him for a moment, but seems to find whatever he’s searching for. He nods, and whispers a “Thank you” as well as “Tony would want you to sleep too though”.
“You know I’ll always come for you,” Steve says, and Tony can practically taste the guilt in his words.
Tony puts on some jeans and a Black Sabbath shirt, and wearily makes his way down to the kitchen, hoping he wouldn’t run into anyone before he’s had the chance to grab some coffee.
It’s like Tony’s taken a wrong turn in his life and ended up in some corny romance movie, that’s how sappy it gets. But he doesn’t tell Steve that, because he can tell it makes him happy. And it makes Tony happy too, in a way he’s never felt before.
By the time his cup is filled with steaming coffee, he’s fidgeting with the need to get out of the room.
Stark huffed, his stature remaining tense, even though he was a good foot shorter than Fury. If Steve didn’t know better, he’d think Stark was Alpha too. (And he had, for a good amount of time, until he’d caught a whiff of his scent just a few hours earlier.)
Steve knows she doesn't match him in physical strength, but she’s never let that stop her, and he doesn't want to start a fight. Not in front of Tony.
Clint grinned. “Guess what? I left Thor in charge of the living room so I can do the rest of the tower!”
The shockwave sends his attackers flying away from him, and Steve hurries to get on his feet and to Rhodey.
As soon as it passes, Tony’s up and acting like it didn’t even happen, and it feels like Steve’s chest is physically breaking in two.
One side of him hates himself for not getting up, for wanting to preserve the moment for as long as he can. Whatever he has going on with Steve, it’s not as important as getting Peter back.
He breaks down again, and it’s heartbreakingly easy for Steve to tug him away from Tony and out of the door, all the while Peter keeps pleading with him.
It’s laying in the cupboard of Tony’s bedside drawer, dangerously close to where he’s tossing and turning in the sheets every other night.
Thor is currently hovering several meters above their heads, his axe sizzling with lightning bolts. He’s the only one of them that has an unmistakable chance at killing Thanos, with wielding Stormbreaker and all, but Thanos seems to be aware of that as well, and has always kept the god at a safe distance to his head.
Tony’s standing in his workshop, waving the empty glass in his hands at one of his robots when Steve enters.
When the sun begins to set, Steve’s waiting for him, in a dark suit and bow-tie, his hair neatly combed and he kisses Tony on the cheek.
Tony closes his eyes for a second, but it doesn’t do anything to soothe the protective anger that’s running his mouth. “You better be. ‘Cause I’m the one who will have to deal with your fuck-up. Again.”
Tony can’t think about it anymore. His life is laying in shambles, and he knows there’s nothing he can do about it.
There’s a thin layer of sweat on Tony’s face and his eyes are closed, which at least means he can’t see the tear tracks on Steve’s cheeks.
A lovely pink flush dusted Tony’s cheeks. “Well, I uh, I’m glad. I’ll give you some space. You take as long as you need.”
Steve shakes his head, because that, that’s even more unlikely than Tony forgiving him (if he could).
Tony pictured Steve, maybe along with Bucky, racing down hills on old pieces of wood and felt a pang of jealousy. “I’ve never done that.”
His meeting with Ross is scheduled for the afternoon, and they arrive midday, giving them some time to settle back into the compound.
Steve heard her explain how they had found him redecorating his room after they came back from Europe.
“What? It’s true,” he defended himself. “You wouldn't believe how hard it is to avoid disaster in here.” He winced. That was probably too close to the truth.
“Hammer Industries is having a bit of a rough time, I hear,” he said pointedly, taking his drink which Hammer was holding out to him.
Back in the war, he’d sometimes dream of having an Omega to return home to. Someone special. Someone who’d be able to hold their own, but let Steve take care of them once in a while.
Tony can’t see Peter’s expression, but that’s okay. He needs both of his father’s right now, and above everything else, he knows that Steve will always care for their son.
It wasn’t at all like using one of the smaller versions of a telescope which Steve had used a couple of times in the war. At first, Steve found it a little disorienting, but with Tony’s directions, he got the hang of it pretty quickly. And he had to admit - the tower had an amazing view of Brooklyn and Queens.
"You know why," Tony whispered, leaning down to start kissing his neck. Steve bit the inside of his lip to contain the whimper he almost released as Tony's kissing turned to gentle sucking and biting.
"Cool," Tony said, playing it cool before sitting on the love seat next to Steve. Again, he might have been a little too close.
“I bought the bike because I wanted a bike, Tony,” Steve said, keeping his voice even. “I saw her, and I wanted her. That’s it.”
Steve parked it in the driveway and stepped off, pulling off his helmet. He was wearing a sweatshirt and sweatpants, yet again despite the heat, but it wasn’t enough to keep him safe in case of an accident.
"Are you about to swim in your boxers?" Steve asked, wondering why he was too lazy to just go inside and get changed or why he didn’t come out in a bathing suit in the first place.
He finished his shower anyway without any problems and made sure he was dressed before he left the bathroom, just in case Tony was awake. But when he stepped into the kitchen with damp hair and clean clothes, he was nowhere to be seen.
“Oh.” Peter wasn't sure what to say about that he seemed to have a lot of people worried about him lately. Was he supposed to think that? Reassure them? Show them they have nothing to be worried about? Peter wasn't sure right now all he wanted to do was sit with Harry and get the pain to go away.
“Peter,” Tony said because he wanted to make sure that Peter understood what he was getting himself into. “This is a serious and
Peter shook his head, spilling some of the drink that somebody had shoved into his hand. "There's nothing wrong with me. I’m finally and perfectly fine. I'm normal like this, and we can have fun!”
Tony pulled the phone from his ear and cupped the microphone end. "Ben's drunk at a party in the woods with Harry."
Thank you all for your continued support. I loooove getting reviews...especially these long ones some of you leave. It makes me so happy that you care enough about this fic to not only read and leave kudos but to also comment!
Tony didn’t go to his own seat until Peter was in the back and buckled up. Then they started the drive back to their home. Peter didn’t waste a second before he quickly said, “I wasn’t stealing it!”
He stripped out of his sweaty clothes and threw them on the ground just outside the shower. He winced when the water came out freezing cold. He hated anything reminding him of the cold. This was definitely going to give him a chill that would last all day. It had been over six years since he had been defrosted, but on bad days, it sometimes still felt like he was back in the ice. Ever since Siberia, it was as bad as it was in 2012.
“Steve,” Peter said, suddenly grabbing the container of juice from his hand. IT was only then that Steve realized he had been spilling juice now that Peter’s cup was full.
Steve was so close. He was in Tony's space, and maybe for a reason. Maybe Tony could jump him now and devour those pretty lips of his. Surely, he wouldn't mind. He needed some practice, especially if he was going through with the affair.
“Are you mad at me?” Peter asked quietly, making himself comfortable in Harry’s arms. “No,” Harry replied. “Just worried.”
“Nope,” Tony cut him off. “You’re not. No powers whatsoever. Never ever. Whoever is here will keep tabs on everyone moving in they don’t know, which includes us. I don’t want them linking you to Spider-Man.”
Growing up sick, Steve was used to embarrassing things happening without his control. It was a part of the sick kid package. So he knew exactly how bad Peter must have been feeling.
"You don't have to make excuses," May argued. "If he's old enough to run around the city and fight criminals, he's old enough to be responsible for his emotions and how he handles them."
Then Tony was grabbing both of Peter’s bags and dragging them down the hallway. Peter hesitated, feeling bad for Steve. “It’s nice to officially meet you, Captain Rogers,” he said, holding his hand out.
He was already still horrified from the fact that Tony told Steve about his bullying problem. He wasn’t supposed to be
Hello! Just a reminder that I'm now updating twice a week, so if you missed the update on Friday, make sure to read that before coming here!!
Tony sighed as he ran a hand over his face, noticing the lack of facial hair again. "I don't get paid enough for this."
Peter could finally be a normal boyfriend and give Harry what he wanted. Peter pushed Harry up against the nearest tree and started to kiss him hungrily. He heard whistles and claps behind him, so he must have been doing something right. Except, Harry wasn’t as excited about Peter’s kissing as everyone else seemed to be. He took Peter by the cheeks and gently pulled him away.
Peter started arguing just as Tony shut the door. Tony grinned smugly as he walked back towards the kitchen where Steve was waiting. He was just finishing one of their sandwiches when Tony returned. He had made a half dozen because he and Peter needed so much to eat each meal.
"I'm not mad at the kid," Tony added. "He's a teenager. Hormones are out of whack all the time. Thanks, puberty. But...Peter's
Comments will be replied to tomorrow morning! I just got home from work so I edited it once and then I'm crashing.
Steve started his morning just as he would have started any other morning. He made sure that any signs of sleeping on the couch were gone before he was healing outside for his morning jog.
Tony brought his and Peter's plates to the sink wordlessly. Steve stayed where he was, watching Tony walk towards where Peter just disappeared to. He paused before leaving though he didn't turn around. "Next time, just come in the room for a shower. Don't give the neighbors a show."
growl as he stepped between Norman and Peter. “You’re not to see my son anymore. If I see you near him, you will regret it.”
Tony chewed on another fry, wondering how the hell a lunch out with the kid turned into an interrogation. Rhodey tried this same trick every time he saw him. Everyone was so quick to tell him to
"My husband is Thomas," she said. "And this is little Thomas Jr." She gestured to the covered stroller.
“Because I said so. You can be creative with your reasoning. Maybe you don’t want to share me with him, or you don’t want another father, or you think he’s not good enough, or you just don’t like him. I’m giving you a lot of choices here. Take your pick.”
Also just as I love casual inclusion of aspec characters, I also love casual inclusion of adhd. Maybe I project a Lil too much.  Who cares!! It's fanfic.
Steve opened his eyes, ready to gently push Tony away, but then Tony moaned with a name on his lips. A name that wasn't Roger.
"Slow down, Pete," Tony said. He didn't want Peter to feel bad, and he also didn't want him thinking anything weird was going on. "You're fine. We were just practicing."
Aahhhh the ending😭 I am going to miss these guys SM. I don't have a sequel planned, even though I know so many of you were interested. Who knows! Maybe I'll have more inspiration for another installment later. I genuinely don't have one planned, but if there's enough interest from you and me, who knows!!!
“I just have to be angry at him,” Tony said after a long moment of silence. Then he was storming away to the opposite side of the house that Steve had gone to. Peter sighed. This mission was going to be harder to complete than their actual finding Hydra and destroying them mission.
Steve was always so quick to play the Good Guy card as if they were a big happy team that could do anything with the power of friendship. Tony was always the one made into a bad guy. “I don’t care what you do. If you want to, go for it. If you don’t, then don’t.”
Steve pointedly ignored him as he continued, "And you could be a high school teacher-- science or maybe a technology class-- on summer break."
I've also got my second road test tomorrow, so let's hope I pass this time and don't hit the curb again.
"Oh, good! I'm coming in!" Tony announced, opening the door and walking in. He watched as Peter turned over, dragging the blanket over his head. "Oh, gee. Where is my little Underoos? Is he hiding from his Dad?"
“You’re not getting on that. It’s dangerous.” Tony remained firm with his arms crossed over his chest.
Both Tony and Peter are being big dumb in their argument so don't don't comment hate for either of them pls... they will learn as the story is wrapped up
Fury left them with new phones they were to use while here, so he'd have to start looking through that. They also didn't have a list of who was living in the neighborhood, but they could go around and find it for themselves.
Steve sighed heavily, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Look, Tony, I don't want to fight on day one. Can we just figure out how to get along until we're done with this?"
Steve had acted so strangely. Once upon a time, when he had been in love with Pepper, seeing her in one of his science t-shirts had made his stomach do a million flips as he pulled her in close for a kiss.
“You worry too much, Mr. Stark. I’ll be okay.” Peter smiled, hoping it would reassure Tony even in the slightest bit. He was always worrying way too much. Peter was genuinely concerned for his cardiogram.
“Don’t worry about that. We don’t plan on keeping you two separated,” Tony reassured him. “You two are always free to hang out here.”
It was unprofessional, but so was trying to catch a glimpse of the man after his showers every morning. Tony wasn't about to change now.
Tony was right behind him as he ran in and ended his conversation on the phone. They were side by side dressing frantically in their bedroom.
"He never stops to think about his own well being once," he whispered. "It's terrifying to wonder night after night if he's gonna get himself stabbed in an alley somewhere. And it's worse to know he's out there because
So many comments from last chapter!!! I will try to respond to them all by tomorrow. I'm dead rn after work and just have enough energy to post this. But I love each and every review you send my way!!
Steve only heard him because of his enhanced hearing, so he let it drop. He didn't want to start anything close to a brawl at dinner time. He glanced over to Tony to see if he heard anything, but he was smiling proudly over at him. Steve blushed and gave him a small smile back.
Harry was quiet for a moment, and Peter waited for him to shove him away. But he didn’t. “We can talk about that later, okay?”
Peter’s brain was still much. Was he into that? Of course, he was. Harry was gorgeous, and Peter loved being with him. He didn’t think Harry would ever feel the same way about him.
“Just-- Just touch me, okay? If you touch me, maybe it’ll work. I’ll like it. I promise.” Peter nodded his head, hoping he would like it. If he didn’t, Peter wasn’t sure what he was going to do anymore. He’d probably have to break up with Harry and spend the rest of his life alone because who wanted a boyfriend who had a broken dick? Nobody.
Peter hurried down the hall to the room with a door open and the light on. This bedroom was three times the size of his room back in Queens. “Woah!”
His dad had mocked him for weeks but not in the teasing tone Tony used on Peter. He was mean and cruel.
Tony wagged his finger. “Watch the tone, young man. You’re my son now. That means I can ground you.”
"Because your son could have gotten my son into trouble. I assure you that I've raised him to behave." Norman chuckled coldly. "I know you two might have dropped the ball, but--."
Steve couldn't help it when his face softened. He always had a soft spot for babies and kids. He grew up wanting at least three of his own. That obviously was never going to happen now, but the yearning to be a father never really faded. "How old is he?"
you yesterday, and we're just sitting here, doing nothing." Tony furrowed his brow. "It doesn't feel right."
The intro was long as Steve hummed along to the music. When the singer began to sing, it looked like Steve wanted to sing along. He stayed silent though.
He was hiding in his room still, even after dinner was over. Steve couldn't blame him. If he had the ability to hide when he was younger, he would have locked himself in his bedroom a lot. Especially when he had been fourteen-years-old and wet himself during one of his seizures.
"It's alright," he said. "Let's just let him relax and listen to some music. Maybe he'll come out when he hears it, or even if he just lays in his room and listens. My music always calmed me down when I was younger. My ma would play it when I was sick. Even when I was incoherent, I could hear the music."
Smiling, he opened the door and went to the living room to see Steve and Peter listening to music on their new record player. Steve was laughing as he watched Peter sing and dance along to whatever music was playing.
Tony took a chip from his plate and ate it, chewing thoughtfully. "Do you think they know who we are or just that we're onto them?"
Peter ignored the looks and glared at the ground still, but that didn't silence him. "Fuck those kids, Peter. If something makes you happy, who gives a rat's ass what anybody else thinks?"
“Let’s go ask her right now then,” Peter said, his left leg bouncing in excitement. “I’ll get her to say yes.”
"Too heavy," Tony grumbled. He'd tried before when he fell asleep in the lab one day. Nearly pulled his back trying to lift him up.
He didn’t know why Klaus hated him so much, but that was the only problem he had in this town. He didn’t need to wrapped in bubble wrap and locked in his room.
“Of course, you don’t. Anyway. Before we leave the car, you need to understand that we are always in character outside. Fury ensured the inside of the house wasn’t bugged, but he can’t do the same for the outside. So whenever we’re outside, around anyone or think you can be heard, you’ve got to stay in character.”
“I’m going for a ride,” he replied. “And then when I come home, I’m asking Evalyn when her husband is leaving so I can go over. I don’t want this going on much longer.”
“It’s adult things, Peter. You wouldn’t understand.” Tony never turned around as he continued to fill Peter’s drawers.
"Everything you do is enough. I've seen you with Peter. Give yourself more credit." Steve smiled softly. "Now let's go pick him up. Promise me you'll try to hold back the anger until tomorrow?"
“Oh, no,” Steve said, shaking his head. “I couldn’t ask you to get caught in the middle of us, son.”
“You don’t have a choice in that, little guy.” Steve kept his voice gentle as he carried Peter back from the way they came.
"I get it if you're not as endowed as you claim you are, but I won't judge you for that. I married you for your personality and your ass, not the size of your--."
Evalyn's eyebrows shot up to her hairline at that information. “Your son? I wasn’t aware that you and Roger had a child. He wasn’t there the other day you moved in, was he?”
Tony wasn't above killing a child for bullying his kid. Maybe he was...no, he wasn't. He was only above that when someone official like the police asked. "I will kill that Flash kid, if he’s still bugging you."
Tony walked in, watching him fondly, standing next to Steve. Steve looked up at him with a smile, though he didn't say a word. Tony wouldn't have been able to hear it, even if he did.
Peter was on his side at least, though he was upset at Steve for just agreeing to it, even if he was only trying to get Tony to break. Steve still thought that at the last minute, he wouldn’t be able to take the jealousy and would tell him to stop. If Tony was just as gone on him as he was, then he would stop him. It was just a matter of
Steve was a natural at being a dad, and Tony loved seeing him play the role. He wished this was how every night could end...the two of them curled up on the couch with their child as they watched a movie. Then Steve would carry the baby into bed, and Tony could watch him tuck them in and sing a soft lullaby.
He was relaxing for a few minutes in silence before he heard the backdoor open. Steve glanced over and watched Tony walk out, dressed in a t-shirt and gray sweatpants that pooled around his ankles. He was probably stealing from Steve's drawers again.
"My name is Edwin," Tony said, turning around. "You should start getting used to it for when we're around people."
Another question Peter had, though this one, he could actually ask Steve and Tony as they pulled up in font of their house. “Uh...why is there a motorcycle in the driveway?”
Tony threw the t-shirt to a chair behind him and before he was looking at Steve again, Steve tore his eyes away from staring. Then his hands went to the strings on his pants and he started to untie them.
“Cap’s one of your childhood heroes. He was mine too, kid. And...I don’t want to ruin that image you have of him. If I tell you what happened, you might lose two childhood heroes. So just drop it. Please.” Tony wasn’t looking at him, and Peter knew he was making his escape soon. He always did when conversations turned too emotional.
In fact, Steve didn't know. He didn't know Peter existed, let alone that Tony was having lunch with him. He left the house that morning telling Steve he was
Peter looked over to him with a frown. “What? I’m just asking. He should know he’s only pushing his son away, and if he keeps it up, then he’ll be gone and out of his life by eighteen. It’d probably be better for Harry anyway--.”
Their bedrooms were too close to joke about that because Peter would probably be able to hear it, and then he’d have to bleach his ears and his brain and never look either of them in the eyes again.
“I know that. But, you give him the idea that it’s okay, and I don't want to encourage it for my own son. Maybe it’s best if our children stopped seeing each other.”
"What did that creep want? How does he even have your number?" Steve's voice was angry for the first time, but the anger wasn't at Tony.
“Save it, Rogers.” Tony held his hand up. “I’m gonna help the kid settle in the guest room. Find your way to the couch tonight.”
"And I wonder where Peter gets the attitude from...from his Pops!" Tony shook his head, taking a seat at the island where Steve could sit next to him and be close enough so that their thighs would brush.
He promised himself he would never forgive Steve Rogers for what he did, but now, it was difficult to even argue with him without taking it all back to try and salvage what little progress they’d made together.
“We didn’t send him away to punish him, Norman,” Tony said, quirking an eyebrow. “He was getting worked up and overwhelmed. We let him take a walk so he could relax and clear his mind. There’s no need to get him all worked up over someone like you.”
bad. But also...that bike was pretty cool. Peter rushed over to her, making sure not to touch. She was gorgeous. He waited until he heard feet behind him before he said, “My Uncle had a bike…”
“Aaand that’s where you kindly leave us the hell alone,” Tony said, grabbing Peter’s wrist to guide him towards the house.
“That was one time during a fight, Mr. Stark!” Peter argued. “We were all fighting! That was kinda the point of everything. I’ve had much worse than a punch from Captain America’s shield.”
"He's puking and crying. Harry said he was acting weird. The kid always acts weird, so I'm not sure why he's surprised--."
Tony stayed with Peter, lifting his arm to spin Peter underneath him a few times. That was the extent of Tony's dancing.
They were in love, and they were going to end up together if Peter had to spend the next ten years orchestrating the perfect plan. Peter could be just as stubborn as them. They were his dads, after all.
here's chapter two!! I'm so excited to share this with all of you. I can't believe the big reaction I've gotten to the first chapter already. I'm so excited to have more reviews to look forward to again. I really hope this story lives up to all of your expectations-- even mine! The concept is so good, and frankly, I'm scared of ruining it. Hopefully, I'll do it justice!
Steve set his towel on a chair and sat on a bench in the pool against the wall so he could be submerged but still sit and relax without swimming. One of Peter's pool floats was roaming the pool, but Steve didn't like balancing in that thing. He usually ended up flipping over.
His voice sounded so gentle that Tony couldn’t say no to him. Even if they were arguing, though Tony had no idea what about anymore. He stood up, unable to hold Steve’s eyes contact for longer than a second. “I’m sorry.”
Tony glanced at Peter in the corner of his eyes. He wondered if Peter was referring to the fact that he was bisexual, or maybe Peter was too. The kid hadn't come out to him, or May as far as he knew. Tony had kinda assumed he was straight, but maybe he wasn't. And maybe this little crush really wasn't MJ.
After breakfast, Tony still wasn't awake, so he slipped outside and started his walk. It was reaching a normal hour now, half past eight, so there were others outside at least.
This chapter is a few days late for a few reasons...I originally had it ready to post last update day, but then a few hours before I realized a scene was missing that needed to be added. Then the last few days have been rough mentally and emotionally so I didn't get a chance to write even though that's what I do when I need to relax.
He came back up, smoothing his blond hair against his head. "Don't worry, big boy. I wasn't peeking."
“I just wanted to get a gift for Harry,” Peter said quietly. “He got me this cool shark necklace, and I wanted to get something for him.”
If you're interested knowing if I pass or fail, I'll probably post an update on my instagram (@Parkrstark) before I post anything here. Thank you again!
Harry gave him a funny look. "I'm just worried about you. This isn't how you act, and I'm worried something is wrong.”
“Anyway, you are my son from another relationship. Girlfriend died or whatever.” Tony waved his hand. “No relationship whatsoever to my new husband. Don't even talk to each other."
They called him after their lunch, and Fury was aggravated, but refused to let Peter out of the mission. They wanted them to look like a normal couple, and apparently sending off their child to a boarding school or killing him off in some freak accident was a no-go.
Steve came closer again, and he was tense as they awkwardly shuffled. Tony was almost ready to call it a day for now until the song changed and something changed in Steve's eyes.
"Maybe. But right now, I’m mad,” Peter grumbled, walking close to Harry’s tree. He stopped when he started to hear a faint sound of music. “Do you hear that?”
“Steve, give her some slack. She does have a lot of responsibilities. “Bruce answered. He wasn’t looking forward to more fighting and yelling from these two. Especially in the morning. Can’t they just talk about things like normal people? “I know that she has a lot to do but it is necessary that she has her priorities right. As hard as it is to admit it, we need her on the field. “
That was something Steve could do. Making plans, forming strategys. He immediately went into Captain-mode. “Okay, you’re right Bruce. Natasha, you try and find out if Fury or anyone else knows something about the reactor. Maybe ask Ms Potts. And I think Toni has a close friend in the Air Force, he might know something. Bruce, you stay here with Toni. Thor, Clint and I will go and try to find any clues in the workshop. About the cause of the explosion or perhaps something about the reactor. If anyone finds something out, contact either me or Bruce.”
Toni was furious on her way down to her shop. Not only did Rogers ruin her childhood, her life now too. And this time on purpose. No excuse of being an icecube this time. Jarvis opened the doors for her and she quickly went to the bar and grabbed a bottle of her best scotch. She opened it and took a long swig.
“Well, gentleman, as captivating as it is, there’s an emergency. I am deeply sorry, but I have to go.’’
Before Steve could answer to that Bruce intervened. “ How about we discuss Toni’s trust issues another time? We should focus on finding a solution to the problem with the Arc Reactor.
While Rogers ranted about following the plan, he missed one of the bunnies – and Toni will never let him live that down- when it suddenly started to explode.
“Because it was an emergency. You needed to know about the people you fought with. It also was only a brief overview, so you knew who you were dealing with.” Fury said.” And if you read it already you should know the important stuff. So why want to have it now? Give me a good reason and you get it, else you’re wasting my time.”
“A good morning to you, too, Spangles. It’s nice to see you, but how about you stay out of my life?” She wasn’t in the mood to deal with him. At least not before coffee number three. She decided to ignore him. She made a beeline for the coffee machine and poured herself a cup just to down it in one go.
He got a bad feeling. Toni being in the med-bay means it’s bad. She normally gets out of there before she even gets in. Why is all he can do recently is worry about that woman?
“No, they won’t tell me anything. Not even when I threatened them.” There was definitely a pout behind those words. “They will only tell you, the team leader, because of patient confidentiality.”
After that none of them said anything for a while. What was there to say? They could only wait for the doctors for any news.
After the first bottle was empty, she took the next one. And the next one. This went on for about an hour when suddenly …
The day began pretty good for Toni. She had put up an all-nighter in the workshop, again, and managed to finish five projects for SI. The board wanted to keep up with the competition and wants to release like a dozen projects at once. Doesn’t matter if their boss suffers from it. Now, all she wanted were several cups of coffee (nothing against DUM-E’s smoothies, but no), go back down to the shop and then take a short nap. In that order.
Then the door to Toni’s room finally opened. A couple of doctors, including Bruce, came out. They all left except Bruce but none of them looked happy. Not being the only one to notice that they all turned their eyes to Bruce. Said man let out a huge sigh before he started.
“Come on Cap, what is your problem? “Toni asked. She just wanted this morning to end. And there is only one way. It is time to piss Tightpants off.
“You know what? This is pointless when you`re drunk like this. I’ll come back tomorrow, but then we will definitely talk!”
Great, as if her morning couldn’t get worse. Board-meeting. Just the thought made Toni being bored out of her mind.
“You know what? This is pointless when you`re drunk like this. I’ll come back tomorrow, but then we will definitely talk!”
The room looked so different. Normally it was full of light. Holographs and inventions that light up. Now it was dark even though the explosion wasn’t that big.
Pepper didn’t know what to do with these two anymore. She hates Ironwoman and wants nothing more than for her friend to leave the team. But she also knows that Toni would never do that. She tried, for Peppers sake, but she couldn’t stay away for long.
Fury just looked at him. “Why don’t you ask her yourself then? I think she can give you better insight than her file would.”
While Steve wondered how this woman could be so aggravating, Toni tried to think of something that makes more fun than riling the Captain up. None came up, well, none that involves clothes.                                                           “None of those. No nicknames. Just call me Rogers. Or Captain.”
Steve wondered why he would be asked that question. Toni is part of his team. He should have access on information of her.
“There was an accident in the workshop. I don’t know what exactly happened except that Toni is in the med-bay.”
Entering the office he saw Fury was on the phone. So much for being free. Maybe he and Hill had a fight, who knows? He honestly couldn’t care less.
The traffic in New York was horrible. Steve needed nearly an hour to get from SHIELD to the Avengers Tower. But he made it even though the only thing he could think of was Toni.
“Why bunnies? I mean, seriously, how about fire-breathing dragons or giant spiders? How can someone think bunnies would be threatening? Next time, they should give them laser beams or stuff like that.” Barton was sulking because the call came in the middle of one of his computer games and he didn’t even had the time to save the game.
Toni looked like she was about to faint any minute. She had huge bags under her eyes and was barely able to stand straight.
“Never mind. Natasha, get Clint. Suit up in fifteen minutes. Bruce, I don’t think this is a Code Green, but be on call.”
She didn’t want to go but Pepper would have her if she blew it off. Toni did not think a Louboutin heel sticking out of her head would suit her.
Okay, Toni thought, make that five coffees. She was about to get another cup when her phone started to ring.
“Maybe it has to do with this Stane guy. From what I heard about him it wouldn’t surprise me if he is the reason.”
She could rule a) out. She was not nearly in enough pain for that. For c) she felt not enough like shit.
Apparently not. No matter how many times he tried to have a civil conversation with her they ended up fighting. He wasn’t even trying to rile her up, but he seems to push her buttons even though he wasn’t trying to. He actually tried to avoid those.
“Well, Captain Rogers, I have a lot to do. So, if you both would excuse me.’’ Toni looked at Bruce, then at Steve before she walked out of the lab. She made a beeline to the elevator that would bring her to her workshop. And hopefully a bottle of scotch.
Toni tried to focus on something else, but there wasn’t much. She was barely able to hold on to her cousciesness but after a couple of more beep-beep-beep-filled minutes she managed to crack her eyes a bit open.
Steve was so engrossed with his thoughts he didn’t realized he stopped walking and stood in the hallway for possibly some time now.
“He’s right Stevie-boy. Pepper did delay the meeting. When I finally got home again Brucie asked me if I could help him with his pants. In the non-sexual, scientific way of course.”
Bruce sighed. This looked like it would be ending in a big fight. All he wanted was to work in silence.
Toni tried to move to get out of there. She tried to sit up, but the moment she moved her head she felt a piercing pain. Okay, getting up is not an option. She settled down again and tried to calm down in hope it would help with the headache. After some time, it worked and she fell back asleep.
‘That idiot of Capsicle! Did his time in ice burnt out all off his brain cells? That guy is in no way the man Aunt Peggy told me stories about.’ Toni was furious. Not only did she had to endure one of Rogers speeches, nooo, she had a board meeting now.
Steve wondered why he would be asked that question. Toni is part of his team. He should have access on information of her.
The next time she woke up she already felt a bit better. The painkillers must have finally kicked in. Again, she tried to sit up, but all of sudden there were arms grapping her shoulders and gently pushing her down on the bed. Where did the arms come from? Toni took a closer look and the arms were attached to big hands. Her eyes went from them to two, very muscular, arms to a pair of broad shoulders. And then she saw a blond mop.
‘That idiot should just leave! Why couldn’t he just leave? Wait, she owned the building…why hadn’t she thrown him out already?’ Why did she invite him in the first place? Right, for the sake of the team. Bullshit.
“Director, we’re talking about Toni. You know she won’t tell me anything. If you haven’t noticed we don’t have that close of a relationship.And, well, she’s Toni.”
She started to get sick of always being the scapegoat. She already blamed herself for the weapons and all the innocent lives they took.
Great, as if her morning couldn’t get worse. Board-meeting. Just the thought made Toni being bored out of her mind. Meetings in general are tedious, but when the board is present, they are even worse. These guys just don’t care about anything accept money. And the public opinion of the company - hence money. Doesn’t matter if Toni has like a dozen jobs or that she wants to bring products on the market that don’t fail.
“Fine, I let it go. But only this time. As a member of this team it’s your duty to come to meetings.”
Not that he would ever ask. He would leave that to Toni. Insulting people with appearing to be innocent questions is her field of expertise.
“Because it was an emergency. You needed to know about the people you fought with. And if you read it already you should know what is in this file. So why want to have it now? Give me a good reason and you get it, else you’re wasting my time.”
Apparently not. No matter how many times he tried to have a civil conversation with her they ended up fighting. He wasn’t even trying to rile her up, but he seems to push her buttons even though he wasn’t trying to. He actually tried to avoid those.
He really couldn’t talk to women. Especially mouthy brunettes who are probably the smartest person on the planet. And richest, not to forget. (Seriously, how can someone have so much money?)
“Are you even worried about me being around Hydra or only Steve? Because it seems more like the latter, and that’s a little ridiculous if you ask me.” Peter was great at teenage sass, though he’d never really laid it on Tony.
Steve knew he was just taunting him, probably trying to get a rise out of him. Steve refused to give in. "Don't be like that. It'll be fine. It's easier for you to call me Roger anyway, since you seem to have reverted to a last name basis with me."
Now, Tony was bringing him a few sandwiches and chips for lunch. He knocked on the door and of course the kid ignored him. He knocked again. "Kid, I know you're up. Unless you're napping like a good little spider baby."
Tony watched as Klaus held out a metal rabbit statue, covered in rusty patches. Honestly, Tony was only more confused. He glanced around the empty shop. "Is this a joke? Is someone with a camera about to jump out?"
No one seemed to notice two adults at their party, or maybe they didn’t care. These kids looked older than Peter, so maybe they were college kids. There was no reason for them to care if an adult caught them drinking...except for the fact this probably considered trespassing.
The two of them practically tripped over each other trying to get out of the room. They stopped in the kitchen, and everyone was staring. Peter knew
Steve loved the movie, and not just because Tony was playing with his hair through it. The music was great, and so was the story. Steve loved the message of being yourself and finding a family that lifted you up. The Avengers were once that family.
“Please! It’ll work this time. I’ll be normal! Just touch me,” Peter begged. All he needed was a little liquid courage to summon the strength because there was no way in hell he could have done any of this sober.
Steve chuckled softly, but when the singing continued, he joined in. There was his beautiful voice that Tony never thought he'd hear outside of the shower.
Harry frowned next to him, oblivious to the music coming from somewhere deeper in the woods. Peter left his bike at the nearest tree and started to run towards the source of the sounds. Harry shouted after him, telling him to slow down, but Peter didn’t stop until he was face to face with a party in the woods.
Klaus stared into his eyes, looking over his body, as if he was studying him and his muscles. Finally, he looked back up and something about him seemed calmer...almost smug. "Fine."
"A few months," she answered. "He has trouble sleeping still, so I jog every morning after he usually wakes himself up before the sun."
Harry stood up and hurried down the hall to where the bathroom was. Steve sighed, watching him go. He didn’t have to imagine how he was feeling right now. He knew how miserable he was feeling from experience. Tony did too, so maybe that was why neither one of them wanted to keep poking the bear.
Steve didn't even turn to look at him, but Tony could see a smile on his face in the corner of his eyes.
"Neither is locking a child in a room without parental supervision or permission." Steve shoved past him and stormed into the small office. Tony followed after Klaus through a small open room into a room shut behind a closed door.
“And that means I can give you the full blown teenage angst and attitude,” Peter said while rolling his eyes dramatically. He opened the door and stepped outside. It was humid outside, and wherever they were was somewhere by the water. Peter hadn’t been to the beach in years. He hoped he could convince Tony to take a trip to one while they were here. He’d heard that Long Island beaches were gorgeous.
Staying angry at them was easier now with their plan in action. Peter didn’t care if Evalyn was a horrible person; she didn’t deserve to be deceived. And Peter thought Steve liked Tony! Why would he sleep with her if he liked Tony? Was he lying? Was he trying to hurt Tony again?
"Great idea, kiddo, if you hadn't invited Mr. Douche to dinner," Tony said pointedly as he raised his eyebrows.
I don't really know much of anything about the X-Men universe. I kinda just took the concept of a school for mutants and included it in here. Also, I was so happy to write the two of them having an adult conversation about their views of the accords without one of them jumping down the other's throat.
It had taken a few moments for Peter to let himself loosen up, but when he did, he leaned his head on Tony's shoulder. Tony smiled, glancing down at him.
“The kid’s right,” Steve offered, tired of just watching the exchange. “Why don’t the two of you go out and go food shopping? Though before you go, we should look into who lives in this neighborhood. Get to know who we’ve got to keep an eye on.”
Tony wasn't about to say that he'd dance all night with Steve, even before the serum, if it meant that they could end the night with Steve railing him. Nope. That would be just a little bit awkward.
Here I am with an update. AO3 died a few minutes ago, and I was jealous of AO3 and also worried that I wouldn't be able to get this up tonight.
"Maybe it'll be good for you," Peter said in an uncharacteristically quiet voice. "It's been a few months since Germany and things have been...weird."
He was cut off when Harry surged forward and pressed his lips against his, holding him tightly by his biceps. Peter’s eyes were wide open the entire time as Harry kissed him. Though Peter wasn’t sure if it could be considered a kiss when all they were doing was standing there with their lips touching. He was pretty sure at least
Steve smiled, tucking his thumbs into his belt loops like an old man. "Perfect. You can pick the movie, and I'll get the popcorn?"
“He’s not going to be in danger. He’s Spider-Man. I think he can handle himself without Captain America and Iron Man as live-in bodyguards.”
"Peter wanted to make sure you had good music too," Steve said, suddenly behind him. "He picked those out."
"Don't embarrass him more than he already is about it, Tony." Steve walked around to sit next to Tony, and Tony could feel the heat coming from his long sleeves. Tony smiled every time he saw Steve wearing the shirt he had made him.
“He’s an intern of mine,” Tony lied. So he didn’t want Steve knowing his identity, or maybe he wanted to make sure it was okay with Peter before he shared it. “I was having lunch with him in the city when Evalyn came up to me and started asking questions. I panicked and gave us a kid.”
This was so hard to sit on for a week. I already have the next one done (7.8k before editing) and I wanna share it now AHHHH this fic is addicting.
Steve knew that Tony was a complicated person. Nothing was going to change that, not even living with the man for a few weeks. Sometimes, Steve thought he hated him; other times they were friends; on rare occasions, Steve thought maybe Tony wanted to be more than friends; and then, sometimes, Steve had no idea what he was feeling for Steve.
Evalyn turned to Peter then and smiled. “Well, welcome to the neighborhood, dear. I’m quite sure you’ll enjoy it.”
He left his suitcase unopened next to his bed, and stepped outside, heading to the bathroom first. He could at least shower and brush his teeth. Of course, the shower was too small just like the bed. He could see over the top of the shower curtain and his head was close to the shower head.
"Oh, yes! I'm right across the street from you!" She brushed a strand of her black hair from her face. "My name is Kyra."
"I'm sorry if he was rude. He knows better than that." It sounded like she was about to hang up and call Peter to give him an earful. That's not what Tony wanted.
"More vegetables on his plate. I completely agree." Tony scooped up some broccoli and put it on his plate. Peter made a disgusted face.
So, Steve had a crisis about seeing Tony in one of his t-shirts that morning and responded to it by running out of the house and buying a motorcycle.
I am so sad to say goodbye to these boys, and I'm sure you are too. Thank you for joining me through this story! Please leave your thoughts one last time!!
Instead, Tony leaned in too, and their lips were so close to touching until he heard a quiet gasp from somewhere behind them.
Norman narrowed his eyes. “You want to keep your son away from the only friend he has? That doesn’t sound like good parenting.”
When it came time for the song to finally end, Tony lowered the volume on the record player until it was almost muted.
The meal started in an awkward silence as everyone just ate their food. Steve really wasn't sure what they were supposed to do. They couldn't just ask:
“Your dads are on their way, okay? We’re just going to wait here for them.” Harry put an arm around his shoulder, kissing the top of his head.
Steve seemed confused, and Peter didn’t blame him. He doubted that a kid was part of the plan when they were briefed on this mission. “Tony, I don’t understand. Why do you have a child, and where did he come from?”
This chapter...has like none of what I planned on it being. I crossed off two bullet points in my notebook for chapter four, added an entire scene that has to be written in chapter five, and then probably, the rest of the original chapter four will be in chapter six. And still, this chapter is 8k words long. I love writing.
Peter stared at the young adults as they danced to music and laughed like a bunch of normal kids. Peter wanted so desperately to just be
“He’ll get a helmet,” Steve said. “And I’ll make sure he’s wearing the right clothes. But you don’t ave to worry, Tony. I’ve been riding bikes since before you were even born.”
Tony's mind started to scream. Was he trying to kiss him? Why was he doing that? Why wasn't Tony pulling away?
"Yes. But he's drunk. He made a stupid mistake and yelling at him while he's already upset won't help."
“But, I didn't finish, Dad--.” Harry started to say, making Peter blush. Peter knew he was talking about using the restroom probably, but Peter knew it was really about
“It’s for his sake too. I know he misses you, and the rest of the team too. He tries to hide it, but it’s so obvious. He needs his family back.”
was upset though when Steve was the one that was angry at him. Tony was supposed to tell him to tell Evalyn to screw off. Steve didn’t want anything to do with her, but Tony had just gone with it and said okay. What the hell was
“We’ll have to go shopping later,” Steve said, grabbing a carton of eggs from the fridge. “We don’t have much of anything.”
Steve glanced at him from the corner of his eyes. Did he really have to say what was wrong? No. Because Tony knew
Peter, thankfully, didn’t have that same experience. Unfortunately, because of that, he didn’t know when to drop a conversation before it got worse.
Harry shifted on his feet next to Peter. “It looks like a college party. We should get out of here.”
"Okay!" Steve said, his heart pounding in his ears. "If I take off my suit will you just get in the water?"
Harry scrambled away and hurried to Norman’s side. “Sorry,” he mumbled to Peter as he left his side.
"I'll start making lunch while you two set it up?" Steve offered as a question, waiting for Tony to nod his head in agreement before heading to the kitchen.
"Why are we sneaking back to the woods?" Harry asked after they were finally a few blocks from his house. Steve had invited Peter to the pool, but Peter declined and Steve hadn't made it outside to the pool yet, but he still was nervous about him hearing their voices as they snuck out of the house.
“You will do no such thing,” Tony snapped. He immediately regretted it when he saw Peter flinch. He didn’t want to actually live up to the name he was borrowing. “I’m sorry, Peter. I didn’t mean to snap. I just...I really did not want you involved in this mission, and now, I’ve got to explain to Fury about what happened and hope he has a solution.”
Whenever they seemed to be going one step forward, they took ten steps back. They were absolutely infuriating, but Peter refused to give up on them.
He sat on the loveseat, Netflix ready, and Steve sat next to him a few moments later. Their bodies were flush, and if Tony got a little tired later, Steve's shoulder was the perfect height for him to rest his head.
“Because I’m too old to sleep on a couch, and there are only two bedrooms in this house.” Tony started to unpack Peter’s clothes and put them away in his drawers. Peter knew he was just trying to keep himself busy so he didn’t have to go to bed and lay awake thinking about whatever the hell was going on between him and Steve.
"I mean, at least you don't have to wear a baseball hat and sunglasses when you're out to lunch now," Peter provided unhelpfully. They were sitting on the middle of a Manhattan sidewalk, eating lunch at the restaurant's outside seating, and Tony didn't even need to wear anything to hide himself from the public, but it wasn’t worth how he looked now.
Steve's shoulders relaxed as he walked away. It was a small step, but it was a start. And Steve was grateful for any chance of forgiveness from Tony.
Peter crossed his arms over his chest and grumbled unhappily. That wasn’t fair, but he wasn’t going to argue it now. He’d wait a little bit until Tony was in a better mood. He didn’t need Peter arguing with him when he was in an argument with Steve already.
to be normal. It’s for me. Not just you. I want to have a normal life and a normal family and a normal body that reacts the way it should when my boyfriend and I are making out.”
Peter only laughed at his inability to form an insult for Steve. Of course, it was hard because Steve Rogers was perfect. Or, he had been before Siberia. But Tony couldn't call him a liar or a backstabber to Peter because then he'd ask questions, and Tony didn't want him to know what had happened that day.
Steve held the helmet against his side under one arm and matched Tony’s narrowed eyes. “I wanted a bike. You went out and bought a boat. I think having a bike is only fair.”
"I caught your boy trying to steal. Come get him before I call the police." He snapped before ending the call.
"Woah," Tony chuckled as he was dragged onto the carpeted floor that was apparently now an impromptu dance floor.
Tony didn’t reply to that as he walked towards the coffee machine on the counter. He started the pot, and then grabbed a mug from the cabinet.
"You heard Fury. He wants us to draw them out. We're getting them angry. Whoever seems most suspicious about the crash is probably our suspect." Steve turned his plate so his pile of chips was closer to Tony.
Steve said he'd be out there if he changed his mind, but Steve doubted he would come out. So he went outside for a night swim by himself while Peter hid and Tony was tinkering with something in his makeshift lab.
“There’s a lot of people I didn’t think you’d ever hurt,” Tony said, making the silence in the room so tense that Peter was feeling uncomfortable almost immediately. “Yet, here we are.”
“Lemme be normal!” Peter begged when Harry tried stopping him from filling the cup again. Peter was stronger though so he got his way. He smirked triumphantly as he chugged the drink within seconds.
Peter didn’t like being babied, and even though he knew Tony and Steve didn’t try to make him feel bad about it, they were good at babying him. They worried too much about a man that Peter could easily take of if he ever tried anything. He wasn’t useless.
This night was going horribly. Peter just wanted to have a nice dinner with Harry while Steve and Tony talked to Norman. Of course, Norman had to ruin that. He was such a dick. He didn’t understand how Harry could listen to him degrade him like that all the time.
He froze in the middle of pouring Peter’s orange juice as he watched Tony stumble his way to the coffee mug that was waiting for him at the perfect temperature. Steve knew that hadn’t been the shirt Tony fell asleep in. He had actually been shirtless, which surprised Steve up until he saw him in his shirt. That was more wild than having
If you're interested in more Superfamily stories, don't don't I've got more planned! New long fics like this, fics for other series, and new ficlets too! I hope you come back to read those too!
Norman gave him a shocked look as if he didn't expect Peter to hear him. The shock turned to anger almost instantly. "What are you implying, boy?"
Peter didn’t want to leave, not when he was finally having fun. The kids around him booed and groaned when Harry suggested they leave, and that made Peter smile to know that these people care if you would leave. He was cool finally, even if it was only because he was drinking os much without completely blacking out. He didn’t want to leave yet. "Just a few more drinks! Harry, don't you want to have fun with me too?”
Peter had his eyes squeezed shut because he didn’t want to see the world around him anymore, but he shoved his hand into his pocket and grabbed the phone. He hoped it was his undercover phone, but he couldn’t remember which one he grabbed.
"Watch how you speak to my son, or I will ensure you cannot speak any more." Steve held his hand out, palm up. "Now give me that key or else we'll have a problem here."
Peter went silent as Tony started to put away more of his clothes. Peter stayed on his bed, glaring down his lap. He heard Tony struggling with some clothes before he grunted and shut the drawer. Peter glanced up to see him rubbing his face.
Once his shirt wasn't covering his waist, Steve saw the drawstrings tied up tightly to keep the sweatpants from falling down his hips. Those were definitely Steve's.
Tony turned around when his coffee started to pour into his mug. "If you can't handle the pressure of this, then maybe you should call Fury and tell him you can't do it. Have them send in someone else."
Almost 9k words and this chapter has only the beginning of the original plan. Peter took control of this chapter, and needed to get some stuff in here for all of you to see. I hope you enjoy.
Steve was still just staring, and he couldn’t do anything else. Why was Tony wearing his shirt? He didn’t care if Steve slept with another woman, but he’d just walk out in Steve’s shirt without another thought.
Steve's smile softened as he thought about Peter. "He's a good kid," he told Tony as if he didn't already know. "Better than both of us. The world needs more of that."
Peter brushed one of his curls off his forehead and out of his eyes. He needed a haircut. He probably looked so stupid. Harry was going to laugh at him. How hadn’t he laughed at him already? Why was he giving Peter a chance? What did he see in him?
The smile stayed on Steve's face throughout the rest of his walk. Even when he walked through their front door, he was still smiling. He heard Tony moving around the kitchen, and walked over to join him. "I met one of our neighbors today--."
“I’m not having this conversation with you,” Steve said, walking past him. When he was close enough, he added in a whisper, “Not when there are people watching.”
Her eyes were on Tony before slowly glancing over at Peter. Then she turned back to Tony. "I should be asking you that. Does Roger know you're out here having lunch with some
He seemed to have been upset with him ever since he told him about Evalyn’s desire to sleep with him. Steve didn’t know why
However, his frustration disappeared almost immediately. "He's what? Oh, my God-- I thought he was in his room. Okay-- we'll be right there. Hold on."
"Because I've been raised by a father who thought a good smack was the answer, and let me tell you, it's not."
Sorry for the later than usual update! I spent yesterday moving to my new apartment from 04:00 to 22:00 without even a break for food. I'm feeling a little bit rested today. Just terribly homesick lol and trying to find things to distract myself with.
Evalyn’s phone started to ring just then, and she smiled at them. “I’ve got to take this, but I’ll see you at home then. Toodles!”
Tony once saw Steve as family, one of his best friends. For him to do what he did, it felt like he stabbed him right in the back before spitting down on him. Peter wouldn't understand that and Tony never wanted him to.
"Ben, I really think you should cut it down. Let's head home before your parents see you're gone and wonder where you are,” Harry suggested nervously as he tried to stop Peter from drinking again.
Writing this chapter was like pulling teeth. Nothing seemed to work or and flow right. I'm not sure if it's because the chapter is just so bad or if it's because I'm a little rusty after my writing hiatus (only a week but I'm dramatic). I'm sorry for the disappointment, but next chapter will be better!
Steve followed Norman and Harry once Tony had Peter. He made sure Norman left so he could slam the door on his face. Harry hesitated before leaving the house. “Thanks, Mr. Stevens...for everything.”
He was trying to think of what they'd need when they started this charade by himself since Tony wasn't bothering to brainstorm with him. He'd tell the neighbors he was a freelance artist working from home, and Tony could be a high school science teacher. That would explain why they'd never go into work a day that summer.
Norman’s face pinched. “I didn’t want to say anything, but I’d prefer if it didn’t rub off on my son like it’s rubbing off on yours.”
So, of course, seeing him dressed in his shirt when they were pretending to be a couple might have weirded him out a little bit. Or a lot, judging by his reaction.
Tony pulled up in front of the house that they’d be staying at and Peter marveled out loud, “This place is
He heard them before seeing them. He heard them before even opening the front door. There was a faint sound of loud music coming from inside, though Tony couldn't tell what it was.
I'm too exhausted to reply to comments right now. I'm about to hit the hay after I post this, but I will reply to every comment on the previous chapter in the morning. Thank you again!!
“This is gonna be a long summer,” Tony grumbled, walking up the path to the house. Peter laughed as he followed close behind. They even had a porch with a swing out front! This was like right out of one of May’s Hallmark movies.
Tony's phone started to ring, making him jump away from Steve. Steve stayed where he was, watching Tony closely. Tony tried to ignore his piercing eyes as he pulled out his cell phone.
“Yeah. Shopping is definitely on the list,” Tony grumbled, though he sounded more tired than grumpy. “Still gotta make sure we’re all on the same page for this whole undercover family bullcrap.”
Peter and Tony stood in silence for a long moment before Tony’s tense shoulders relaxed with a heavy sigh.
"I panicked!" Steve said, his good mood out the window. "I told you I needed to use the restroom, and you refused to stop for over two hours, and then had me getting your bags. I was a little preoccupied."
Which then led to Peter thanking her profusely and jumping up and down before Tony shooed him away to go pack some things he’d want to bring with them. He wasn’t sure how long the mission would last, but Tony learned his lesson to avoid going around the city now.
"Uh huh," Tony said sarcastically, rolling his eyes. They continued their lunch in silence until a few moments later when Tony was finished and Steve was still working on his. "It feels weird to just be sitting around."
Tony realized with a startle that he wasn't thinking of just any run of the mill gorgeous hunk of muscle. He was thinking about a very specific tall, muscled, blond hair, blue eyed man...and this specific man had just given him plenty more of ideas when he rolled up the driveway on that bike.
“Oh, please,” Norman said with narrowed eyes. “I’m just raising him to be a man. You should take some hints. Then, maybe your son won’t be running around in makeup and a dress one day.”
Thomas laughed but only because he thought Steve was joking around with him. “Funny man! I’ll see you later, boys.”
"Hey, Pete...you know, we can't have a movie night tonight, but what if we watched your movie while we had lunch?"
Peter turned to see one of their neighbors walking over. He was Thomas, the one with the boat that Tony seemed to be in an endless showing off competition with. Peter didn’t like him.
“It’s alright,” Steve said with a sigh. “He has every reason to be. I’ve hurt him, and I hoped we could work through it, but I’m not so sure anymore.”
But then Tony shoved himself in front of Peter before he could. The smile disappeared from Steve’s face and he shoved his hand into his pocket. “How do you know that?”
“Unless you want to give me one of the options, then I guess I’m doing it,” Steve said, eyeing him. He had a look in his eyes that Tony couldn’t decipher no matter how hard he tried.
Steve wanted to comment about how he was just playing the part of Tony’s son incredibly well. He was like a mini Tony. But he wasn’t sure if he should be saying anything just yet.
“I--uh, have to go,” he said, running away from the table before he even finished helping Peter clean up the spill. He needed to get away from Tony in his shirt, and he needed space to breathe and think.
Something about Norman coming over made him worried. Tony wasn't too happy to have the guy over either; he had his fair share of asshole fathers.
Harry held him by the wrists and kept him away. “You’re embarrassing yourself,” he told him, Peter didn’t care. Peter was used to embarrassing himself.
"Why?" Steve's brain was running a mile a minute trying to keep up with Tony. He wasn't sure why Tony was seducing him, but it was working.
"You got that right. My husband manages to sleep through it every morning, but I never have that same luck."
It didn’t make sense. Tony had to hate the guy because if he didn’t turn all of these feelings to hate, then they’d turn to something else. Something dangerous.
The crowd that had gathered around him while he drank cheered. Peter smiled as some of them patted his back and clapped, encouraging him to drink another. He had never been this well-liked within a group of people before as anyone other than Spider-Man. This was what it felt like to be normal.
Before Tony could even speak, Peter stormed out of the room towards his bedroom. Tony stared at the spot he had just been in silently.
"I'm fine!" Peter snapped at Steve before glaring over at Tony. Tony felt his heart skip a beat. He had
Steve's heart was just about to pound out of his chest. What had gotten into Tony? Sure, they'd been close on the couch, but it was just innocent cuddling really. Tony curled into his side, and Steve wasn't going to turn him away. His mother raised a gentleman.
The rest of the people around them immediately started gagging and yelling at him. So much for being normal and cool. Peter felt like shit, and it wasn’t just because of the alcohol. Despite everyone else leaving to get away from the vomit, Harry stayed to rub his back as he started retching again. God how much did his stomach hold?
Tony chuckled, ignoring the way Peter was staring at him, probably in shock. “No, he wasn’t. He was staying at his aunt’s apartment while we settled everything into the house.”
I am posting this from my breakroom at work, so I won't have a chance to reply to all of the previous comments yet
Steve's eyes fluttered shut as Tony cupped the back of his head, threading his fingers through his hair. God, this was perfect. Steve just wanted to arch his hips ever so slightly and get some pleasure. Tony would be eager to give it--the man had straddled him naked.
When Natasha comes to ask him about the job, she takes one look at his face and says “We leave in thirty minutes.”
It hurts. It fucking hurts, knowing Peter’s with Steve and he’s not. But that’s not even the worst of it; oh no. The fear of losing Peter
“I know Tony often blames himself,” Steve replies carefully. “Which is why I told him it wasn’t his fault.”
Steve still spends most of his time in Tony’s room. He tells him stories, mostly old ones from his childhood, but sometimes, DUM-E knocks over a can of oil or Bruce burns their dinner, and Steve tells him that too.
She sighs. “Steve, you’ve only been here for an hour. And before that, you were in there for three days.”
Peter’s with his best friend Ned, and Tony sent Pepper off for a wellness weekend, so it was only them and Rhodey.
Tony frowned, realizing that probably hadn’t been the best thing to say. He wanted to ask what was going on with Steve, but he wasn’t good at that kind of conversation, and he wasn’t sure Steve would appreciate it.
None of them ask Steve to take a break, even though that’s what Tony would've done, undoubtedly. Maybe because they don’t have the strength to argue with him, not right now, at least. Or maybe they know he’s not going to leave, no matter what they say.
The thing is, Tony doesn’t even know if he’s even avoiding Steve and his team. Or if repairing his suit is the only hing he knows how to do anymore.
“Okay,” Steve whispered, and Tony felt him climb onto the bed on the other side, the one near the door, which Steve had insisted he take when it used to be
“I would love that,” Steve said, entirely seriously. His heart was starting to beat a little faster.
“Uhm,” Clint said, “why does only Steve get an ice cream machine? I exist, you know, and I - Ouch, Nat, what was that for?”
His head was pounding, his throat was dry, and he struggled to remember how he’d went to bed, not to speak of how he’d gotten home in the first place. Then, he opened his eyes and saw Steve, sitting next to him,
“You’re cold too,” Tony responded, matter-of-factly. “I know I can be an ass but I don’t mind if we share.”
There are more Wakandan warriors appearing around him than aliens, and to his astonishment, it doesn’t take them long to regroup and charge into battle. All the questions are pushed back for later, and Steve is as relieved as he feels impressed.
This time, it’s Steve who avoids his eyes. “Clint was just joking around. It’s... he didn’t mean it.”
Tony bristles. There it is, Captain America’s Voice Of Reason. Something he never responded well to.
Natasha’s words of comfort are almost empty; and it becomes apparent as time drags on and they struggle more and more to hold Thanos’ army back. Steve’s not sure of they’d even be capable of sending reinforcements if the others needed it.
Tony tenses. “Steve,” he chokes out, and can’t help the words tumbling out of his mouth. “He was with me on that ship and I didn’t... I brought him to Titan.”
Steve steps forward. Apparently, he’s already made himself Captain of their new group of misfit losers, and Tony doesn’t even have it in him to feel irritated, like might have before.
Peter raises his head and stares at him, like he’s seeing him for the first time. “Mr. .... Mr. America?”
Silence spread for a few moments, but before Steve could worry about keeping the conversation going, Tony asked him “And how is Steve Rogers adjusting to this century?”
“He never really told me, but he was feeling really bad.” Peter swallows, looks at him accusingly. “You hurt him.”
Steve waits until Peter’s display isn’t surrounded by other parents and journalists, then goes up to him.
Steve stared at him, and Tony could do little more than stare back into those baby blues, helplessly and embarrassingly exposed. “Tony, sweetheart, do you mean that?”
It’s Peter’s expression, his heartbreakingly hopeful expression when Tony tells him he’s talked to Steve. And the worst thing is, Tony can’t even blame him for hoping. He’s just a kid, for christ’s sake, he deserves normal parents. Or at least non-divorced ones.
For a few minutes, they remained in silence. To his own surprise, Tony felt Steve’s company as quite comforting, which, most disturbingly, made him want to
When Tony stumbled into the kitchen one morning, basically on auto-pilot and made grabby hands at the coffee machine, Steve could do nothing but stare. He was basically rendered useless until Tony had left the kitchen with his coffee in hand.
When he went upstairs a few minutes later, he ran into his teammates in the kitchen on their shared floor. Thankfully, someone had yet to try and decorate he upper floors, and Tony gratefully sat down on one of the black, luxurious chairs.
Steve was, for the lack of better words, as high as a kite, and Tony knew he can’t put any of his own feelings on him in that condition, much less expect Steve to mean any of what he was saying. Not to mention that Steve was
It wasn't anyone’s fault. The team couldn't have known Tony had taken Steve to see that exact same film on their first date, and bought out the entire theatre, which had made Steve so adorably flustered, even as he’d admonished Tony for wasting his money.
Steve drives the car himself, even though Tony could effortlessly acquire a chauffeur for them, because it’s more personal like this - or so he says.
“Hey, look at me.’’ Tony gently placed a hand under Steve’s chin to tilt his head up. „Do you want to go down to your floor, or not?’’
“It’s lovely, thank you.” Tony didn't even have to lie; though he’d grown up dining in Michelin Star restaurants, they never came close to a homemade dinner. And Bruce’s cooking reminded him of his -
“What’s the situation?” He keep his voice cool and controlled instead of shrieking Tony’s name like Peter’s doing. (He has to be the strong one now, he can’t let his fear for Tony take over, he
„An Omega?“ Clint supplied with a smile. “He is, but it’s not like any of us could make him do anything.’’
Tony had felt Steve looking at him when he’d left midway through the movie, and he didn't even have to meet his eyes to know that there would be the mix of sadness and hurt in his eyes that never failed to make Tony feel as though Steve had just personally wedged a spear into his chest.
Steve flinches and the old guilt once again settles in his chest. “Can we please not do this? I haven’t seen you in so long.”
Tony started furiously shaking his head as Steve slowly eased him away from the counter and started manoeuvring them both through the crowd.
He’s ashamed to admit how easy it was. How effortlessly he let Steve’s touch guide him, how he trusted him - in that moment - without being afraid.
Tony had hoped Steve’s condition was showing signs of getting better by now, but apparently it wouldn’t be that easy.
Steve, Natasha, Bruce and Rhodey all look about as battered as Tony feels. Okoye and Shuri are both dressed in formal Wakandan wear; they appear almost too put together. In the back, the raccoon is sitting on Thor’s shoulder. Nebula is next to them, and her eyes haven’t lost any of that murderous glint.
From then on, it was mostly a mix of affection and grief, but Steve tried to not let it show. If Tony really did hear him, he didn’t want to worry him.
He knows he could ask FRIDAY about Pepper’s status, but it doesn’t feel right. Especially since he knows Pepper always hated it whenever he depended on his tech more than he needed to.
Tony invited him over to the Compound for Christmas Day during that dance. Steve couldn’t even think of saying no, lost in Tony’s presence as he was.
Bucky stares at him. Steve almost expects him to ask questions, but he merely says, “Then it’s probably not healthy for him to be sitting here the whole time.”
His suit’s taken considerable damage, he he can’t fly as fast as he’d like and his faceplate isn’t fully closing anymore, but damn it if he’s gonna let that stop him.
Well shit. Tony felt his cheeks start to warm. And all that he managed to squeeze out of his mouth was “Uh.”
“Just follow me!” Steve said, and that was all warning Tony got, then Steve sat down on his piece of cardboard and started to race down the slope.
Tony couldn’t help it; the opportunity was too good. “What, you’re not even gonna buy me dinner first?”
It slowly heaved up and down with a rhythm that almost sent Tony back to sleep, if not for the sudden realization that mattresses should not be doing that.
Tony gets an MRI-Scan as soon as they arrive at the hospital. Steve refuses to leave his husband’s side, even though he doesn't understand a thing about what the doctors are hoping to do.
It wasn’t like he’d never talked to an Omega before, as Bucky often liked to claim, but his interactions had mainly consisted of stammering on his part, and the Omegas had never bothered with him for long. And also, that’d been a completely different decade. Society hadn’t been so… open then. There’d been rules and stereotypes and nobody ever really questioned them.
And, honestly, Tony’s all for getting as far away from Ross as physically possible, but that also means he gets to sit out several hours in their Quinjet next to Steve.
“Tony,” he says lowly, as peacefully as he can manage. “You should drink some water and go to sleep.”
Steve feels almost even more nervous than he did back then. Now, he’s got so much making up to do. He’s basically walking in a field of mines and every single one of them could destroy the second chance he’s been given.
The rest of his team wasn’t thrilled to have him leave during Christmas, but Steve knew he had to be with his family.
Steve was still staring at him, which made Tony fidget nervously. “Only if you want to, of course. But I figure it’s better than staying here with Clint and all his decorations, right?”
and he just really wants to do a 180 and leave, but Peter’s probably already seen him, and he really shouldn’t see Tony practically flee at the sight of his former husband.
Steve moved back a little, but didn't back down. “And you said you were scared I didn't mean it, last Christmas. That’s why you left.”
Steve held back a flinch. He’d never, ever seen an Omega talk like that, especially in front of an Alpha. And yet here Stark was, mouthing off against Fury like that was a typical Thursday afternoon for him.
“We’re trying,” is what he tells her instead of saying a few other sentences that lie on his tongue. “We have to be a united front, in case anything happens.”
He’s glad for the fact that he doesn’t have east access to alcohol here in Wakanda, because knowing himself, he’d already be drunk if he did.
Eventually, it was Tony who lost the fight with his exhaustion and fell asleep. Later that day, he woke up with a blanket tucked around him and no sign of Steve.
The second and third time, Peter stays for the whole weekend and Tony makes sure to attend every meeting he’s got scheduled during that time. (Pepper stares at him in complete and utter shock - as if he’s got some kind of alien possessing him.)
After a while, Bruce enters the room, but when Steve quietly gives him an update of Tony’s status, he turns a little green in the eyes and leaves.
Which would be Tony’s preferred plan of action, but he has a splitting headache and his stomach seems to be twisting in all sorts of possible directions.
Steve’s brow furrowed, and yeah, it was a stupid assumption - they were both still fully clothed, and Steve wouldn't have slept with him anyway, especially not drunk.
“He refused to come out, even when I told him I’d lose the fight without him.” He laughs, a bitter laugh, one of those Tony loathes to hear from him. “And I did. We all did.” He shakes his head. “What I’m trying to say is, we don’t have time for whatever thing happened between you all."
, at least, and because since Tony avoids thinking about Siberia and Thanos and Titan, that’s what counts.
Strange looks right at him, with all the cold professionalism a world-renowned surgeon has to have. “The pressure inside his skull will cause damage and he will be brain dead soon after.”
He brings him breakfast in bed, complete with a cake and candles, cuddles him and doesn’t complain when Tony suggests to watch
He doesn’t have to search long. Peter’s standing in front of the ceiling-to-floor windows right next to the door, staring at the driveway.
It shouldn't be surprising, what with the many hours Bruce and Tony spent working side by side. Steve finds himself leaning towards the comfort of Bruce’s understanding.
Ever since Tony… fell, all of them have tried talking to him about Tony. But ever since that first time Natasha managed to corner him, he’s done his best to avoid these conversations.
Tony wasn’t blushing, he really wasn’t, but that warm feeling curled low in his belly and made him smile. “I’ve never had Crêpes,” Tony said, the fact coming to him out of nowhere. Suddenly, he found himself wanting to try it.
“Okay,” Steve said. His voice was quivering a little, Tony noticed distantly. “But we should get you home. And to the MedBay.”
But Tony also knows it won’t be enough to kill Thanos. He’s known it the first time he assembled his nano suit, and he knows it now.
In truth, Steve knew his way around the most well known constellations, but he’d only ever seen them with his naked eyes. And besides, he loved watching Tony enthusiastically position the telescope for him to show him the night sky.
“I think that’s my cue to leave, gentlemen,” he said with a blinding smile. “Would be a shame to let such a dance go to waste.”
“You should show up to more training sessions. ‘S better for team morale,” Steve mumbled when Clint fought off the last HYDRA agents that tried to follow them.
Tony found himself smiling. This was a far cry from the Christmas parties he’d used to throw, where he’d end up with a bunch of strangers in his house. This was different. In the eighteen months of being a team they’d started to build more than just that between them.
(He wonders if it should even be possible to miss another human being as much as he misses Steve; so much that his every waking moment is controlled by it.)
Peter pouts, obviously not happy about it, but he nods, with such deeply convicted trust in his eyes it makes Tony’s heart sting.
“That’s great, kiddo,” Steve says, meaning it. He can’t quite keep up when Peter starts to tell him about the programming process, but that’s okay. Peter’s proud of it, and so he is too.
“If- When we get them back, watch out for him. He’s, he’s going to be scared and if I, if I can’t -“ His voice breaks.
By the time they finish, he’s out of breath and exhausted, but in a good way, like he hasn't experienced in way too long. Most important of all, he feels
There are grey streaks in his hair now, as well as in his beard. His eyes are lined with wrinkles, and he’s started to complain about pain in his back.
(Wanda and Sam were back and well, and save for Rhodey, nobody else had any severe injuries. It does little to calm his nerves.)
The worlds feel hollow, meaningless. Steve doesn’t respond to Clint, and eventually, he’s alone again.
“The ice made it worse, but even before...” Steve was staring into the fireplace as if he was directly looking at his past. “We didn’t have a lot, when I was growing up. Most of the time, the heating was broken and we didn’t have the money to buy more blankets.”
“You can stay if you want. I’d appreciate the company,” Steve told him honestly and was rewarded with a blinding smile.
A hand came up to softly grasp Tony’s left shoulder, which made him realise he’d been tilting dangerously in that direction.
Peter would know he hadn’t eaten yet. He would know and he would worry, which was exactly what Tony wanted to avoid.
He almost feels sorry for him, for them both, because this is most likely the last night they’re ever going to get.
“If they need backup, they’ll say so,” she says with the calm assurance one needs to have to rely on teammates.
Steve is afraid of hurting him again, and Tony still feels the shield break the arc reactor in his suit.
But Tony shakes his head, suddenly overcome with the need to make sure Steve would remember know Peter for the hero he
(Cause yeah, why isn’t Steve here, why is Tony alone, why does have to be alone with his fifteen-year-old, sick son, he can’t even take care of
Seeing Tony again felt like punch in the guts, but Steve had the diplomats to focus on, and tried to steer his thoughts away from the Omega as best as possible.
“I’m not done yet,” Steve said, but couldn’t help smiling. “I’ll finish it later.” It was getting dark. “You mentioned something about stargazing?”
Tony stumbled and caught himself with one hand on the thankfully cold stove. Steve was staring at him in horror.
Tony tilts his head. “Awh, really? Wish she could’ve had more success with me. It must’ve been pretty frustrating.”
And that’s the one thing that Tony can’t give him, so he talks right over that hopeful glint in his son’s eyes, and tells him they’ve figured out a schedule to share him.
Knowing Tony, the damage is already done. And as it is, he’s on a small metal cot fighting for his life and Steve might never get to say any of it in the first place.
Tony flinched. He hadn't seen Natasha, who was already sitting at the oval table. He nodded and made a beeline for the coffee machine, hoping to chase away the last images of his dream that were still clinging to his mind.
And, yeah, it’s not like they can’t ignore all the elephants in the room, but Steve feels bone-deep tired when remembered of the task before them. And all he wants, even if for a little while, is rest. For himself as well as his team.
Tony lightly nudges his son until he untangles himself from his father’s side and turns towards Steve.
As soon as he sees Peter and Tony in the bed, his face pales, but he hovers in the doorway, as if unsure of what to do.
Their lips meet for another kiss, and this time, Steve doesn’t push Tony away. He pulls him closer, until he can feel Tony’s body heat through his clothes.
In the morning, when Steve approaches him with a bashful expression on his face and asks if he’s free for dinner, it throws Tony in for a loop.
He takes a shower and changes into clothes that don’t make him look like a homeless drug addict. Then he sits down in the kitchen to eat, which is where he encounters the limits of his strength for the day.
The hours before, Steve stays at Tony’s side, just like he would do the first weeks after. He washes him and talks to him, explains what’s going to happen and why.
Deep down, he wishes Steve had stayed, but he knows he doesn’t have anyone else to blame but himself. (Which is probably his life’s motto at this point.)
The guilt also almost kept him from returning to New York when the negotiations to abolish the Accords were set to commence. In the end, Natasha had to give him that final push to make him go despite his dread to see Tony again.
In fact, when Tony tries to get off the bed to find Peter some lighter blankets, a small, clammy hand grasps at his shirt and stops him.
Pepper didn't answer. Her silence was so pointed, it effortlessly succeeded in making him feel guilty for his evasive answer.
Tony cleared his that and banished the thoughts from his head. All that was over. His relationship with Steve was over. He wasn't in the depression stage of a breakup anymore.
Clint teases him about it; says he’s gone soft, that he’s no use to Tony like this. It’s supposed to make Steve mad and does the trick pretty quickly. As soon as Steve lets go and fights Clint for good, he gets into an adrenaline rush he hasn't experienced in months, letting go of his worry and focuses only on the task before him.
Which is ridiculous. He’s been dealing with this on his own for more than two years, and he’s ought to be over it by now.
