It’s perfect, Steve is perfect in this moment.
Steve blinks.
It’s Steve’s least favourite way to fuck him, Tony knows. The romantic in Steve likes to see Tony’s face when he comes, staring so deep into his eyes that Tony could swear Steve can see his soul leave his body in the split second where he tips over into release.
Tony paces through the workshop until he’s worn circles in the tile, then finds his way up to the generous living room. The country property is small, he hadn’t even realized that he owned it and it’s given him some time to think and gain perspective.
Tony didn’t look up, a hand covering his face with his fingers digging into his forehead. When he didn’t answer, Steve forced his useless legs to move and pushed himself through the door, lingering just outside the entrance. He leaned his head against the wall and listened to the shallow stutter of Tony’s breathing.
He tries to memorize Steve’s silhouette against the city sky before a last, lingering kiss that signals Steve needs to leave and make his way up to the rooftop.
“Tony, stop. Stop.”
“I have a daughter.”
“Don’t be stubborn,” Tony counters.
Steve launches forward and plasters their mouths together.
“We’re through.” Tony interrupts, scathing. “So, here’s what this is going to look like. The pardons give you full immunity from anything that’s happened leading up to this point. You’ll have your regular rooms back at the Compound, with near similar access to the building and its amenities. Rhodey has been heading up the team here, so at least for the foreseeable future you can expect to co-lead the team with him. You can do whatever you like, really, so I want to be crystal clear about this, Rogers. Outside of anything strictly necessary for saving the world, you don’t speak to me. I don’t speak to you. We’re through. It’s that simple.”
Tony squirms closer, thrusting his hips down hard into Steve’s and rolling his throbbing erection against the echoing bulge in Steve’s jeans. The sounds pouring out of Steve now are music to his ears, a song that never gets old and unlocks a series of vivid memories from the shadowy crevices of his mind.
“Yeah, what the hell? I could have sworn I’d left them in my pocket.”
Tony pauses next to him, raises his eyebrows. “You get to make your own choices. Not him.”
Steve had always loved that; the feeling of waking to his prick already hard and leaking inside the heat of Tony’s mouth. And Tony had loved it too, sucking him down while he was still soft, feeling him fill out and harden under his tongue. The trust of it all made him soar.
Tony nodded, a sharp jerk of his head at the sufficient response, before he buried closer, snuggling into Steve’s chest and wrapping the blankets tighter around them both.
“Punk,” Bucky ribbed. “Now he’s not even going to like mine.”
It’s Clint, to Tony’s surprise, who approaches him first.
“You haven’t even tried it yet.” Steve replied, lamely.
Comments are much loved, let me know what you think!
no matter what people said, whether it meant they’d be going to hell or not.
“Come on, sweetheart.” Tony pulls him away from Nat, away from Sarah, away from everyone until his back is to them all.
For half a second, Steve thought he might never need food again. Not if this was the alternative.
Tony guzzles his way through a piping hot cup of coffee and promptly refills the cup. He plucks a second mug out of the cupboard and fills it too, adding sugar, before turning tail and running back into the soft, safe refuge of his bedroom.
“Tony that’s not—”
“I’m sorry, Tones.”
“Shh, breath. Don’t try to talk.”
Tony leans over him, and Steve searches his face. It takes every ounce of self-control not to sink deeper into the bed. Everything aches, and maybe it wouldn’t be so terrible to tell him. Maybe Tony deserves to know.
The elevator door chimes and opens into Tony’s magnificent penthouse suite, but Steve can’t be bothered to take in more than the path that seems to lead towards a bedroom. Tony’s bedroom, a guest bedroom, it doesn’t matter as Steve herds Tony towards it with a firm grip on his hips.
to have any drugs, but if he doesn’t stop pacing and if you don’t get this fucking baby out of me right now, Tony Stark, I swear to God I’m going to—”
“It shouldn’t be long.”
And Tony does, sliding slick fingers over his hole before pressing inside at a devastating pace. Tony explores the inside of his body as thoroughly as the rest of him, curling and pressing until he finds the spot that makes Steve gasp, his hips jumping up to chase the sensation as Tony works him over.
“It doesn’t count. It doesn’t count, okay?” Tony sounds like he’s falling to pieces, pulling in heavy breaths as he starts to yank on Steve’s oversensitive prick. “You’ve been so good and you’re so perfect like this. Just let go, darling, I’ve got you. It doesn’t matter. Just come.”
Steve sees it with alarming clarity. Now or never. “Tony?”
“Do you have any idea?” Steve asks, finally letting one of his hands wander between them to take Tony’s cock in his hand. It’s hot and heavy, jerking against his fingers in a desperate plea to be held and Steve drags his fingers from base to tip in long, sure strokes. “Do you have any idea how much I love you?”
FRIDAY advises him that the team is gathered together in the common space, debating over what to order for dinner, with only Lang and Rogers absent.
“Nothing important,” Tony whispers back before he answers the rest of Steve’s anticipated questions with a tongue in Steve’s mouth and a firm grip on his jaw.
“Better not,” Tony taunts and then the vacuum of his mouth constricts even further.
Steve blinks.
“Tony, don’t—”
“I know that. Of course, I know that. God, Tony, I was just trying to say thank you. They’re my friends and they were hurting and you could do something about that. I just wanted to thank you for it. Why do you have to make this so difficult?”
What was the harm? No one else had to know.
A physical manifestation of the intricacies of Tony’s mind, Steve thinks absently
Pepper strokes
One minute, Steve is standing beside Natasha and the next, he’s underwater. There’s water in his lungs and he’s drowning. He can’t breathe, he can’t think, and JARVIS is here telling him that Tony is dead when he was just—when Tony was just—
So, Jarvis had read to him most nights of his childhood, instilling a strong fondness for high fantasy that started with the Hobbit.
“I wanted it to be a surprise!” Tony’s indignation is laced with laughter.
After a lengthy discussion, Tony excuses himself for some air and Steve gives him a quizzical look that he shakes off, resting a hand light on his shoulder as he passes him and wanders the Compound grounds. Being here after everything overwhelms him. Tony had retired for a reason, and despite the rocky beginning, he had enjoyed being retired. Being Iron Man again had almost killed him, twice.
Tony steps around the bed, one hand on Steve’s bicep and the other brushing over their daughter’s hair. He’s crying too, big, messy tears flowing freely down his cheeks.
“Then what do you want?”
“Mr. Stark! Hey, wait up!” Peter is rushing down the steps behind him, a flush high on his cheeks as if he’s chased Tony down at top speed and his eyes are bright with concern. Tony doesn’t know if he has the energy or the emotional capacity to deal with the kid right now, to not say something he’ll regret, or to listen to him if he needs something.
“Back to Peggy.”
Steve grabs his hand.
Tony doesn’t stop until he’s safely inside the car, barking orders to the driver before he folds in on himself in the backseat, shaking and gasping for breath.
He looks happy.
“He smells weird.” Bucky pointed out the following morning, glancing up at Steve from where they lay together in bed, an obvious emptiness between them.
All he knows is that two plus two is four and Steve Rogers making decisions for him means things are headed south and he’s not sticking around long enough to get hurt this time. Not any more than he already is, with his wounded pride and his brittle heart held together by the sheer force of his will.
“And I forgot that. Or I ignored it because I was angry–not at you, at everything that’s happened in the last year. So, when I saw you that first day and you were drunk again, I thought… I didn’t put my faith in the man that I’d come to know.”
“It’s just odd, is all. Maybe we should ask Tony if one of the bots is on the fritz or something.”
“It’s alright.” The words are destroyed, a rough, sandpaper croak and Tony flinches, looking away. Steve reaches out to fold him into his arms anyway, and this time Tony lets him. “It’s alright. I’m sorry. I love you. It’s alright, sweetheart.”
Why was he doing this? What kind of sick punishment was this supposed to be? If anything, maybe Tony should have known, that pushing Steve away wouldn’t actually stop him, just leave him stumbling into something more. This mockery of self-flagellation.
The betrayal reappears as a hot poker through his belly, as hot and sharp as the first.
“Or how Bucky growls every time you sit too close to Rhodey.” Steve suggested
Faintly, Steve wonders if the grip he has locked on Tony’s waist is tight enough to hurt, but Tony doesn’t seem to mind. He just kisses Steve again and again, mouths meeting in a first dance that turn wetter and sloppier as the desperation starts to leak from Steve’s pores. It feels like the earth is going to give way and crumble underneath him.
“Nat’s is the best,” Sam pulls the focus away.
When the disbelief crumbles into stark realization, Tony physically staggers. One of his hands shoots out to brace himself against the tractor, and he looks like he can’t catch his breath. He’s a man laid low, if Steve’s ever seen one.
“I didn’t mean to,” Steve forced out, the words like glass in his throat. “Tony, I saw the pills and I couldn’t wake you so I thought—”
“If you’re about to say something to me about Rogers, you better tread damn carefully.” He warns.
There’s a flash of doubt across Steve’s pale features before he’s yanking out, shuffling up the bed on unsteady knees and stripping the condom off to jerk hard and fast onto Tony’s face.
They’ve landed. And they’re ripping Tony to shreds.
“How is that not exactly what this is? Tell me, Tony, because I want to. God please, believe me. I want to. But what’s changed?”
“No, I want you to go,” he tries to sound firmer than he feels.
The first two weeks go by in a blur.
“It’s alright,” Anita reassures him, and Steve blinks at her, standing steadily at his side. She reaches down with a fresh blanket and takes their baby off Pepper’s chest, wrapping her up before placing her gently into his arms.
Until today, ‘spitting mad’ was a metaphorical turn of phrase. Now he understands. If Tony cared enough to lower himself to that standard, he would spit on the ground at Steve’s feet.
He doesn’t get Bucky. Not really. But he can begrudgingly admit that he likes him more and more as time goes by. It’s not so hard to see why Steve cares for him.
“Noted.” Tony grunts. “Now, is that it, because this whole situation makes me feel like I need to go into lockdown for a week and lick my wounds. I’m calling it for today.”
Steve smiles at the nearest camera. “Something tells me he might already know I’m coming.”
“Oh, Tony, no,” Steve protests, holding his hands up as Gabe Jones whistles at them.
Steve was groaning, panting into his shoulder, mouth open and pressing barely there kisses into his skin as Bucky was knot-deep inside him too, linking them all together with that aching stretch.
Steve starts to come apart under him. Tony feels it in the way his thighs start to tremble and Steve’s fist works rapidly across his cock. Between them, Tony’s prick is red and aching, disappearing in the warm slide of Steve’s fingers and he has no idea how he’s even still hard, his mind buzzing with loss and heartbreak.
When Steve tries to thread his fingers through his hair again to gain some control over Tony’s ministrations, he bats him away. Instead, he allows Steve’s hand to settle over his own on Steve’s thigh, losing himself in the slick, wet glide of his tongue over Steve’s shaft.
He spots him, a stone’s throw away. His suit is mangled in various places, but the wound in his side is freshly stitched with nanites. Peter is in his arms, gasping.
He’d give Tony anything, everything.
Peggy’s the last one to approach him, cupping his chin in her palm. Immediately, he knows that this isn’t the Peggy he’d been with. This is the Peggy from his own timeline, from a whole different life. “I hear we had our dance,” she says. “You didn’t have to do that, Steve. I was going to be okay; you knew that.”
One day, he’d forget that mouth-watering scent entirely.
“You’ve told him the Rogues were coming back,” Rhodey cuts him off. “That’s literally the smallest part of the picture. He doesn’t know enough to even make an informed decision at this point.”
Behind his eyes, Tony is forced to replay a vivid image of Steve, seated across from him in the penthouse dining room while he twirls pasta onto his fork with one hand because he won’t ask Tony to relinquish the other. The last family dinner they’d had, just the two of them, before Ross had come with the Accords and everything had gone to shit.
“I figured I’d better give my liver a fighting chance before the aliens come.” Tony shoots back, guzzling down his coffee and dragging his eyes up to meet Rhodey’s gaze. He winces, and offers him a meager half-smile.
Tony narrows his eyes, crosses his arms across his chest, and steels himself for whatever’s coming next. It’s only a few beats too late that he realizes he’s doing all the things he hates seeing in Steve when he’s angry, and he tries to shake out his posture as best he can.
“Tony, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean–”
“So, what you’re saying,” Steve had said slowly, “is that you want to be able to look at the Compound when we get married.”
The nightmares started to fade a few months after the last time he saw Steve, walking away because Tony asked him to, though he imagines that there will always be the odd evening where he’ll still wake up drenched in sweat, swallowing around bile and the taste of pennies. There are only two nightmares now, fan favourites really, and they’re always the same.
“Come over here,” Tony says, reaching out a hand.
“What do you mean?”
He weighs the odds and takes the chance. Without Tony, at least this way he could still be
Steve shucks his own sleepwear, tugging his shirt over his head and getting caught on the way out before he’s kneeling back onto the bed, hesitant and determined all at once. In the end, the angle isn’t great and Tony hasn’t thought this through as much as he’d thought. Otherwise, it’s perfect. Glorious even, the way that Steve slides heavy between his lips, caressing the flat of his tongue and rewarding Tony with little jewels of pre-come when Tony hollows his cheeks and swirls his tongue over the tip.
Steve freezes. “Oh no.”
On the tip of his tongue, Tony wants to ask,
Maybe if he asked real nice Steve would slide in there too. They’ve talked about it – his Alphas always saying it wasn’t safe, it was too much – but if he begged now, maybe they’d knot him together. Take him together. Bond together.
That was key. Bucky growled low in his chest, teeth constricting around the gland until it was painful and tears flickered behind his eyes. It was too much.
“He’s a strong guy. I think he can manage it. Plus, it’d give him a chance to let it go. It’s not his fault. It’s not Vision’s fault. Hell, it’s not really even Steve’s fault–yeah, I know, he did a lot of shit, don’t give me that look, man–these things happen in a battle.”
“I can’t do this, Pep. It’s too much.”
The question is vague and Tony thinks that must be intentional, as if Steve’s trying not to give too much away, waiting to see how much Tony will actually offer.
He doesn’t give a fuck about public opinion on this.
Steve will let Tony have anything he wants.
“I don’t know man; I don’t buy it.” Sam is saying. “I think you got lucky, y’know? We’d never fought against you before so you clearly had the upper hand with that web stuff. I want a do-over, and this time I won’t go so easy.”
They’ve only just scratched the surface, and somewhere below where the light can reach there’s an ocean’s depth of darkness to wade through. It’s been there all along, and at least now he’s not trapped there alone. Steve has said he’ll try, that he’ll do what it takes, and Tony wants to believe him.
Steve is pliant under his attention, opening his mouth for Tony’s tongue to spear inside and lick behind his teeth. Fisting his hands in the short hair of his beard, Tony tugs at his jaw, pushing and pulling him into the right position as he slams him back against the wall.
What else would it be?
There are a hundred pleas stirring behind Steve’s eyes, but he doesn’t say anything more. There’s only silence, Steve accepting his lot, bowing his head and relinquishing control as Tony shifts and takes him deeper, rolling his hips and chasing after anything that might feel good in the maze of all this pain.
“You can’t do this!” Steve keeps screaming it, over and over again. “You can’t do this! Don’t fucking do this!”
He couldn’t stop thinking about it. About them. Tangled together in the dark, all hands and fingers and
Tomorrow, he’ll watch it come up with tears in his eyes.
Tony squinted at him, calculating, as if he was replaying the conversation over in his mind.
Pepper presses her palm into his cheek and he leans his head into the comforting caress. He’s trying not to hide or lash out, but without those two basic defenses, what is he?
The last person he passes is Barnes, who, even in the middle of the room, seems sunken in the shadows. The assassin’s eyes are trained on him, calculating his movements, cataloguing his reactions. It’s chilling and slips through the cracks of Tony’s shaky defenses with ease.
, and Tony can feel everyone’s eyes on him. The humiliation is practically wafting off him in bright orange neon.
“I think you may be one of the most selfish people I’ve ever met.”
A small smile spreads across Tony’s face. “Really?”
Steve glowers at them both, but bites his tongue and disappears into the throng of people.
—I wanted to. I’m sorry Steve, fuck, sometimes I just want to hurt you so bad.”
Tony’s breath catches and before he can stop it, a sob slips out and he presses wet eyes into the curve of Steve’s throat.
It’s disappointing when Steve doesn’t even bother to try after that.
He’s missed sparring with her, verbally and physically. Natasha promises a dance of direct strikes and elegant, cutting subtleties that he respects and that keeps him on his toes. Of all of the Rogues, she’s the one he actually wants to forgive.
“Never.” Steve’ll swear it again and again, every day until he dies. “Never going to stop loving you. Never going to stop wanting you. Tony, yes—” Steve groans, dropping down to nip where Tony’s neck meets his shoulder as one of Tony’s wandering hands makes its way into the waistband of his jeans.
“It’s nobody’s fault!” Steve’s voice jumps a few notches but there’s no anger, only a deep, genuine desperation that Tony can feel in his bones. A desire to be heard and understood. Tony knows exactly how that feels. “It’s both our fault. I can handle it if you’re pissed at me, but you can’t go back to shutting me out, not again. Not now. I’d give anything to get it right every time, but you told me once that that’s not the point so here I am, Tony, telling you I fucked up and you’re expecting me to be perfect.”
Steve curled deeper into the edge of the oversized sofa, feet between two cushions with his sketchbook balanced on his lap. Bucky was within arms-reach, fingers wrapped around one of his ankles, taking in the morning news and stroking his thumb in slow circles.
Maybe he’s earned this. Maybe this is Steve Rogers’ lot in life; a gift after so many backbreaking, heart-wrenching years. “It wouldn’t have been anyone else, Tony. It was you or nothing.”
What did all of that even mean?
His own personal heater.
Steve startles, looking from the midwife to Pepper to Tony. They’d just agreed on that name last night and to hear it from someone else—
“So, Rhodey,” Tony’s voice wafts through the door, rife with trouble. “Any wedding night advice?”
A little pain with the pleasure never hurt anyone. And Tony’s denying himself all the love he’s ever felt in this world. He reminds himself with an unsteady breath that Steve has changed, he’s seen it plain as day in the letters Steve has sent him. Hell, he thinks about the picture from years ago, the one Bucky had sent after the benefit when the divorce was still fresh, and thinks that Steve’s been busy changing for years.
“You’re the most infuriating person I’ve ever met.” Steve gives him a firm shove backwards into the bedroom. Tony stumbles through a step then grins up at him as he draws in close again, magnetic and enticing. “And the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen.”
could.”
In the distance, Steve is running towards him. It’s a mirage and it makes him feel hysterical because his brain has played a lot of tricks on him in the last few days, and the tricks are always Steve. Steve holding him, Steve kissing his face, Steve yelling at him be it in anger or in sheer desperation.
“I know that! What do you want from me?”
Tony calls Pepper instead.
It still didn’t change anything.
“You can go.” Pepper steers him over to one of the corners and Tony hates how fast he jumps at the idea of playing the coward, prepared to run and hide from the world. When had he become this man who loses ground in a handful of ill-spoken moments, and his temper even faster?
Bucky had understood him. Bucky hadn’t pushed or demanded. He’d waited and let his true colours shine through and look at where they were now. The most bizarre friendship Tony has had to date, with the least likely person.
“Why can’t I break it?” Steve asks desperately, ignoring everything else.
“Nobody’s asking you to look, To—” His name gets lost in a fit of coughing and Steve allows himself to be led to the old leather couch in the corner of the workshop.
better.”
“I was, um, just, uh–”
Bucky is awake, grinning at him and flexing the fingers of his new metal arm. He’s working on peeling away a tiny arc reactor sticker Tony has slapped on the shoulder, and when he finally gets the edges peeled back, there’s nothing underneath. No sigil or brand, just a beautiful, silvery prosthesis that Tony has spent weeks building from scratch.
“Please,” Steve repeats, desperate now.
“Should I notify the authorities, boss?” Her voice was toneless.
“Everyone gets a nickname here,” Tony chirps back. “It’s the law.”
“I did! I wrote you that letter—”
“Wow, look at that posturing.” Steve teased, gripping his jaw and pressing a kiss to his stiff mouth despite the rumbling in Bucky’s chest. “No need to be jealous, Buck. This is just something Tony used to do. He’d get all worked up over something and dart off for a couple days until he figured it out and was ready to talk.”
“Precisely.”
Tony laughs and slaps a palm down on his chest. There’s a revelation in his eyes, like he’s finally fit the missing piece of an equation into place. It’s something Steve doesn’t need to hear to understand, he’d probably not be able to comprehend if he did.
Steve blinks.
“Calm down. Breathe.” Tony scented him heavily, wrapping him up in the soothing warmth of acceptance and welcome, of
is the embodiment of everything irrational and Steve with his superior moral compass will save the day every time,
“I’m trying.” Steve whispers.
Everything Strange says makes the decisions obvious to everyone except Tony. There’s a moment of polite contemplation but in the end, the vote is unanimous.
Especially when Steve surprised him late into the afternoon to fuck him into the futon in the corner, greasy towels thrown over the bots to protect their innocence. He’s never going to have that again. Not tapping his fingers against the troublesome smirk that once lit up Tony’s face from across the room and tasted like pure joy. Not kiss him and kiss him a hundred times over until Steve is warm from the inside out, boiling over so they’re both tearing at each other’s clothes.
“I do, Tony. I do, listen!”
“Good, but who?”
“I don’t know what’s going on.”
A year has drifted by and he’s hardly even realized it.
Clint is the only Avenger that’s absent, having been granted an extra few days in ‘retirement’ for reasons unknown. Rhodey simply tells him to mind his business and reminds him that Clint is coming to the Compound in two days’ time, which is more than can be said for Peter Parker.
” Tony says his name like a prayer, cheek ghosting along his. The warm burn of Tony’s short-trimmed stubble is an afterthought, two seconds behind the hands that can’t seem to stop touching him and Tony’s body, constantly in motion as he wraps around Steve and draws him in.
The Avengers call a meeting at the Compound, restored for the second time since its creation, and Tony sits silent in his chair, listening as the team devises a plan for the Infinity Stones. There’s a unanimous agreement that they can’t remain in the future but it’s not as clear cut who will take them back to the past.
It’s all the hours afterward that Steve takes up residency in his mind and won’t take the hint. The images of the time they’d spent together swirl and warp until he’s not sure what’s happened and what he’s missing. Worse, he can’t figure out where what they had ends, and the lies begin.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Sure buddy, I’ll bring it all down to the shop for you later. Now get out of here, you spoiled heap of junk.” The robot swivelled at him again, fondness obvious in the little swirls, and rolled towards the elevator. “Yeah, yeah, happy birthday, kid.”
Steve laughs, brushing a hand through his sweaty hair with a little half shrug. “Well, when the mood strikes, it strikes.”
But then as quickly as it comes, the panic recedes.
“Yeah. I’d say. I’d
Tony mumbled something that sounded like ‘cake’, but he doesn’t really seem to be listening. Maybe he hasn’t heard Steve.
“Why not talk to him about it?”
And Steve pitched over the edge.
Tony swallows audibly and Steve wants to laugh. He knows exactly how Tony must feel; he’s overwhelmed, too. He’s drowning in Tony, in the salty taste of his skin and the earthy smell of his shampoo, the way his skin is softer than Steve could have ever imagined, lined with thick, corded muscles from so much time spent in the workshop.
“So be it,” Tony leans back with lazy confidence and crosses his hands on the table.
Steve closes his eyes against the tears threatening to fall with his hands folded in his lap.
Of course, it’s pathetic. Waking up and realizing that he’s managed to survive the end of the world, twice, fought against death and won, and be desperate to get his hands on a couple of letters from the ex-husband who almost beat him to death and never apologized.
He doesn’t want Steve to be unhappy, but something about Steve not trying to push him now feels foreign. A sliver of caution and hope catches in his gut and twists.
“Are your comms down? Tony, hold on, just flip up the face plate for a second—”
Steve moans around his cock and Tony laughs, tugging at the lobe of his ear because Steve’s thinking something decidedly dirtier than Tony had meant, before sliding his hand back to cup the back of Steve’s head and hold him in place. He’ll die here, in Steve’s mouth, his aching cock brushing the back of Steve’s throat as he works up to taking him deeper. Steve’s always been a marvel at sucking cock, taking Tony all the way in and keeping him there, until Tony’s shivering and trembling, frantic with desire but not ready to let go.
“JARVIS?” Steve asks, still glancing up at the ceiling after all this time.
Steve throws the shield before he can think. He misses.
When he flipped on the switch to the relaxation space, Tony was not prepared to practically jump out of his skin.
With robotic movements, Steve rises on unsteady legs and all but collapses next to Tony, his head coming down onto Tony’s chest and his arms wrapping around Tony’s waist where they hesitate and don’t squeeze.
Steve forces himself to look up. The pity in Bucky’s eyes stirs the nausea in his stomach. “Some of it was real.”
Steve’s going to ruin this. Steve ruins everything.
Steve groaned, resisting the urge to close his eyes.
Been there, done that, didn’t change anything then and won’t change anything now.
He’ll help, Steve knows it.
“I told you not to fuck with the timelines. You really never listen, do you?” Steve shakes his head with only a sliver of remorse but Tony’s still smiling, tracing idle patterns down Steve’s stomach and back again. “Where did you go?”
Steve gives him another baleful look, wiping the back of his mouth on his forearm before tugging Tony back down the bed. Sliding back in, Steve shoves one of his thighs up higher than it has any right to go and grips him hard at the ankle, leveraging his thrusts as he picks up the pace.
“He came to bed last night?” Steve offered, but Bucky cocked a brow.
Right on cue, Steve’s eyes flicker with recognition and then flash sharp, a glint from the edge of a knife. Yeah, Tony still knows exactly how to get him going. There are too many conversations from the past, where Tony’s opened up the little box labeled
Steve chokes, gasping in a breath as if he can’t get enough air and staggers under the weight of what Tony has said, as if Tony has struck him.
No number of
“Now, get out of here.”
“Fuck you, Barton.” Tony snapped, plucking the tablet off the table and shoving back, chair legs scraping against the floor.
Steve’s doesn’t work for S.H.I.E.L.D.; the organization doesn’t even exist.
“Stop talking. Please.” Steve’s pleading voice is barely audible where it’s wafting up from his chest and Tony forces himself to breathe and relax, spreading his legs a degree wider to sit fully back on Steve’s cock. Even though he doesn’t deserve it, Tony humours him anyways, nosing at Steve’s temple until Steve draws his face back and captures Tony’s mouth in a fierce, earth-shattering kiss.
“I want you to think, very carefully, about whether or not what you’re going to say to me next is an excuse, Steve. Because I’m having a really hard time deciding whether what you’ve said is true, or if it’s just that Barnes has given you all the right words to make it this far.” He laughs, humourlessly and swallows back the bile. Always with the fucking bile. “You said he doesn’t know me better than you do. Are you really so sure that’s true?”
Just for a moment, he wants to let it all go. It’s okay, he can let himself have this. It doesn’t have to mean forgiveness; it doesn’t have to mean anything at all.
“No! Peter! Goddamn you, Steve!” Tony blasts him, a beam right from the centre of the suit, and Steve flies halfway across the battlefield. His vision crackles with sparks, and he’s too far away. He stumbles to his feet, racing across the field, but he’s already too late.
Fixing the damage to his arm had turned out to be far easier than fixing the damage to his brain.
“–quiet, the genius is speaking. He only zones when he’s watching us. Or with us. It doesn’t happen in team meetings, or if the others join us for dinner. He’s not just thinking about
“Ma,” Steve croaks.
Steve curled his fingers back around his cock, tugging it roughly from stem to tip and letting his thumb drag over the tip. The blankets were pushed back in a creased puddle over his thighs and he hardly noticed the chill. It was hard to feel cold when Tony’s eyes were on him, heating him wherever Tony’s gaze landed. He thrust up hard into his fist and the pleasure built. Steve could almost taste Tony, what he imagined would be coffee and blueberries, and smell the familiar scent of motor oil on his skin.
Steve winces. “Since S.H.I.E.L.D. Since the helicarriers went down.”
“Letters? What letters?”
And okay, maybe he deserves that, because he hadn’t really given Steve the time of day. Tony had written him off entirely after everything, his rage and bitterness too strong to reign in and so he’d let it loose and hurt them both even more in the process.
Pulled up on his toes, Steve’s plastered up against Tony from knees to chest and it would be nothing to lean in and kiss him. He misses Tony with an unexpected ferocity, like a piece of his soul has chipped off and stayed behind, locked inside Tony’s chest where the arc reactor used to hum.
It doesn’t matter. The convulsions stop, but Tony is gone.
Still, nothing.
So, this year Steve was back in full force, organizing a party for their favourite robot. Steve had invited everyone and all save Bruce and Rhodey, being available with Wanda and Vision returning from their Paris trip earlier, just to make it to the festivities.
“So, I blamed you even more.” Steve continues. He doesn’t flinch back, or even move at all. He sits there, back straight as he soldiers on, a statue in the centre of their bed. “Bucky started apologizing at some point and it was too much. Constant, really, and I hated it. What did he have to apologize for, you know? And yet he just kept at it, over and over.”
“You have to admit, you haven’t been dealt an easy hand here. And we can all see the way that Steve stares at you. Constantly. It’s disgusting, and a little bit pathetic. Even Barnes’ told him to knock it off this week. Sam says he’s told him that he’s got to let it go and move on.”
“I’d say I’m sorry for destroying it, but I’m not.”
“Tony—” Steve can’t take her. She’s so small and delicate, a dark flush red with a shock of brown hair on the crown of her head. She’d be even smaller cupped in Steve’s massive palms, and he can’t possibly hold something so fragile.
It would feel oh so good to punch him.
“Tony for God’s sake, would you just–”
“Well, believe it. No harm, no foul, this time around, right? We gave it a good run. Just not in the cards. Nobody’s fault.”
Steve’s fingers are running through his hair, slipping down to cup his cheek and tip his head up but Tony ignores it, swallowing him down without meeting his eyes.
“I do understand that. I understand that’s what you think, anyway. You wouldn’t have done everything because you didn’t do anything. Steve, you didn’t even scratch the surface, understand? You never even apologized—”
For a second, there’s a hot flash of a memory from the last time he’d heard that voice, with those words. It’s the image of Steve, softly begging, hands had been curled through his hair, gentle, pulling him forward as he thrust into his–
Steve comes with a bitten off groan, eyelids flickering as he loses himself in the pleasure and digs his fingers into Tony’s scalp, holding him in place without choking him on Steve’s cock. Every muscle in Steve’s body goes tense as he thrusts stream after stream across the back of Tony’s tongue, down his throat as he swallows repeatedly, desperate to take it all if he can.
But Tony wants Steve to kiss him now.
“Nightmares, Steve,” Tony’d said by way of excuse, shoving at Steve’s hip to get him moving. “Not pretty. Nobody wants to see that.”
Tony solders while Steve is gone, savouring the way that metal, when heated, effortlessly binds together and cools into something new.
Clint snorts. “Fifty bucks says you won’t last five minutes.”
When nothing comes, he pries his eyes open a beat later.
When the kisses turn salty Tony yanks his head back, leaving Steve’s mind in a whirl.
“I—” The air is startlingly cold on his bare arm now, and Tony’s brain doesn’t process as quickly as he needs it to. We? As in, Steve and Tony? As in, Steve thinks that after all they’ve been through Tony would ever go near those stones again? Even if taking them back to the past is the right thing, what they’ve promised, can Steve really believe that Tony would do that?
If this is what Tony needs him to be—an escape, a distraction, he can give that to Tony. Steve steels himself and digs his nails into Tony’s hips
Bucky leaned back in their nest, one leg cocked at the knee and splayed himself shamelessly as he reached out both arms and pulled blankets and pillows alike into his sides.
“This is me trusting that you know what’s right for you.”
“If I ask you to go, you’ll go.”
“But in that last one… what you’re looking for isn’t possible. There’s nothing you could say or do differently by then. The damage is already done. Even B.A.R.F. has its limitations, Cap.”
Except it is all on him because Tony brought Peter into all of this in the first place. Peter has brought so much to his life since then, but the guilt of what Tony’s given him in return is building into a mountain the corner of his mind.
Tony stands at his side, the gauntlet on his wrist. It’s been too many times and too many ways, and Steve is tired. Every time he tries to prevent this, Tony dies anyway.
That’s exactly the opposite of what happens.
In all reality, Steve can’t imagine another loss. The way he’d fallen in love with Peter had been immediate and surprising. This young man, so uncertain, so desperate for affection and praise, and Steve had loved him just as much as Tony had.
After that, it’s Bucky telling Steve to pull his head out of his ass, to apologize to Tony, to take ownership and accept that this, most of it, was on Steve. Which Steve had told him willingly, because it was important that Tony know that to fully understand him? It doesn’t have to mean anything more than that.
“Like I said, Tony, I am not perfect. I can’t even say that Steve asked me not to tell you–not that I’d ever put the blame elsewhere–I was concerned about what it would do to the team, so I kept quiet. And in doing that, I’ve done more damage. I know it was wrong. You deserved to know what happened to your parents.”
“Why didn’t you?”
Bucky was off like a shot, but Steve held back. Tony was smiling at him, genuine and open, washing away all the fears that Steve had sheltered over the last few months. He tilted his head askance, and Steve just shook his head, wrapping his arms around his waist and pulling him in.
Whatever.
Pepper could have, and would have, handled this on his behalf if he had asked.
“Kiss me, I want to taste you when you–”
Tony curls his free hand at the back of Steve’s neck and playfully pecks at his lips between sips from the steaming mug.
“Is that right, Stark?” Natasha’s eyes twinkle as she leans forward to give Tony a curious look. Steve glances between them, jaw aching and he imagines his smile can’t possibly get any wider.
, came to mind and Steve smiled in spite of himself.
Tony is shoving his belongings into their luggage when Steve finds him the next day.
Tony’s doing a shit job, as per usual.
“Thank you.”
“No, sweetheart, you’re not.”
Tony looks away, resting a hand on the edge of the open coffin. The church has long since cleared out, and Sharon had given him a knowing little nod. Smoky incense curls around them, and Steve is at a loss for words.
“Stop bein’ weird.”
“JARVIS, come on!”
, he almost says, but doesn’t. Not her baggage, not the time.
Summer bleeds into autumn and Steve is still a new man.
Steve closes his eyes and let’s go by a fraction, just enough to lean into Tony’s hold.
“You’re full of surprises today, Captain. What’s one more?” As Tony nudges at Steve’s shoulder, he goes willingly.
Steve never went back to the United States and the blank face of the burner phone he kept by his side mocked him. A constant reminder of his guilt.
Tony shakes his head, and the fine hairs tickle at Steve’s nipples. He tightens the arm he has wrapped around Tony’s midsection and pulls him in closer. It doesn’t matter that a few short hours later Tony was awake and smiling, or how Rhodes and Pepper had sat on either side of him and murmured constant reassurances. Until Steve had Tony in his arms again, kissing him through the daze of the anaesthesia, Steve had held his breath.
Tony glances at the floor. “I would have given it to you either way.”
It felt so very right.
Tony’s almost forgotten. The pressure to announce the New Avengers has been high and with a great deal of reluctance, Tony had eventually given over and agreed. A benefit, to both introduce the new members of the team and present the expansion of the Maria Stark Foundation relief efforts on a global scale.
The stretch burns. It always burns, and it’s the first time that Tony feels whole in months.
Afterward, it’s too quiet and Tony focuses on the even paces of Steve’s breathing. They lay side by side like something out of a grotesque romantic comedy, sheets pulled up for a modicum of modesty that means nothing when you’ve been together as long as they have. That, and Tony’s told his own husband—ex-husband— he wished he had killed him. What need does he have for modesty now?
“For the most part. It wasn’t this—wasn’t you. But I loved her, too. It wasn’t always easy, and some days I thought about going back. But it was a beautiful life and I wouldn’t change it.”
Married.
“Hey kid, leaving your own party so soon?” Tony nods to the driver, who smiles at them with a tilt of his head and a brush of his fingers against the brim of his hat and steps back into the car. Tony props one arm against the door, holding it open at his back as Peter comes to a stop in front of him.
“First,” Tony says, with a sweeping gesture, plucking the multitool out of Bucky’s back pocket while he’s arms deep in the inner workings of the car. “Don’t ever talk to me about Howard’s balls. Second, if you think I’m going to believe that backwater Brooklyn Bucky Barnes could afford a car like this, let alone his rent, I’m sending you back into cryo for more testing.”
He was all ridiculous arrogance when he’d rolled his eyes and wrapped his hands around Steve’s cock, whispering, “Really, again? Can’t help yourself, can you Steve?”
Tears prickle behind his eyelids and even as his entire body rises up towards Tony’s mouth, he begs, “Don’t make me come!”
“What is that?” Steve asks when Tony returns with a broad, mischievous smile. It’s like he’s begging Steve to ask and Steve could drown in that smile.
Tony just smiled, like he’d already worked the whole thing out.
“You’ll be fine,” Pepper says gently. “And we’ll be right here when you wake up.”
Crossing the short steps to the door, Tony spares him a glance over his shoulder and Steve gives him a little half-smile, just the edge of his mouth curling upward. The door closes behind him with a click, and when Tony steps into one of the suites down the hall and into the shower, he stays there for a long time.
“How long have you been down here?” Bucky asks. “How long have you been doing this to yourself?”
Bucky’s still not understanding, clearly, because he doesn’t say anything and just tilts his head, quirking an eyebrow. What was it about super soldiers that makes communication such a challenge?
Steve shakes his head but for some reason he realizes that’s a lie. It’s nothing he should remember, but he does, like someone’s stuck the memory into his brain and he’s seeing it through someone else’s eyes. He remembers the cold blackness of the water, but he also knows that Bucky pulled him free.
They were inside him. His body, his mind, fuck, they were inside his very soul.
“Bedroom. Side table.” The words are a rasp he can barely make out, and they slur across his tongue. There’s a new haze forming at the edges of his awareness and Tony wonders if maybe they’re giving him painkillers. God knows, he deserves them now.
It’s strange, fucking this stranger who was once his husband.
Steve grinned at them, the image of Natasha covered in snow and Clint’s children a sweet and warming notion. She picked up on that thought real quick, glaring at him from the doorway. The softness behind her eyes betrayed her.
The music cuts off abruptly when Steve pushes the door open and Tony turns, eyes lighting up as a broad grin spreads across his face. “You’re really putting the ‘old’ in old man these days, aren’t you, Cap?”
“I like this kid already, Stark.”
As if one day he might find Bucky at breakfast, more Brooklyn than Soviet and everything would go back to the way it had been. Except Bucky had come back to find Steve with someone else, bonded despite the fact that that bond was shrivelled and faded to almost nothing. He was a different man now, and so was Bucky, and maybe neither of them was actually coming home.
Steve scrambles across the dirt, rocks scraping against his knees when he drops down next to them, hauling them both into his arms.
“Tony,” Steve husks against his mouth, tugging him back by the short strands of his hair. Tony’s eyes are glassy and raw, so incredibly open.
The fingers digging into his arm grow exponentially tighter. “That’s what you’re going with?”
Ross was a politician. Politicians were unpredictable, self-serving, and ultimately, relied on teams such as theirs to continue to function. Creating a pariah of Captain America had been a massive error for the Secretary of State.
“Yeah.”
There’s a reason he’s built this, and before they’d interrupted him, Bucky had been utilizing two of the weighted blankets, a grounding strategy Tony was familiar with. It had made him feel like he was suffocating when he’d tried it months ago.
Tony collapses into his arm and the pain stops. The gauntlet falls away, dropping into the dirt where they fall, Tony on top of him. Steve can’t breathe, but he can feel Tony gasping, little hitching breaths. In his arms, Tony’s face is burnt. His beautiful, beautiful face, skin raw and blistered. His hair is flickering with embers and Steve runs a hand over it, through it.
“Calendar.” Bruce corrected, but his lips are twitching and he’s enjoying it as much as any of them.
Unfortunately, that hadn’t been an option.
It’s too much. His rebellious cock twitches between his thighs and Steve groans as he curls up and hops off the bed.
It still felt wrong to hear it out loud. Forbidden. A secret he shouldn’t have shared with anyone. And yet he wanted it more now than he had anticipated, memories from decades ago flaring back to life.
Two voicemails from Ross make clear through potentially chargeable threats that he better not be preparing to pull some ill-advised stunt. He reminds Tony that the press will look as bad for Tony as it will for all of the Avengers, and they all know Tony can’t afford that right now. He’d better get his head out of his ass, and quick.
Steve shivered and tucked the blankets further up under his chin.
He’s not prepared to make that mistake again.
Maybe Tony just wants to know that ending their marriage was worth something after all. That Steve had lied, had torn Tony into little pieces, because of something that mattered. Maybe that’s asking too much of the man who thinks he knows what’s best for everyone around him and has never made a wrong move in his entire life.
“Okay.” Steve says after a minute, and it takes Tony’s blissed-out brain a second to realize that he had been starting to say something. Right.
“You’re a good man,” Steve says, just to watch the flush appear high on Tony’s cheeks like it always does. Like Tony really can’t believe that Steve looks at him and sees the most amazing person on the planet.
While he touches him, Tony never stops kissing him. Maybe between one kiss to the next he could reach inside Steve’s body and yank out his soul.
Tony just wants to hear Steve say the words, damn it.
“Tony, it’s okay. We can talk about it later.”
Sleep greets him like a gentle, early-autumn breeze and he falls asleep wrapped in the safety of Steve’s arms.
He tugs on Steve’s tie again. The fabric creaks and whines under the strain, bringing Steve down to avoid ripping the fabric. Tony feels trapped, breathing coming sharper with Steve hovering above him and he squeezes his eyes shut to try and remember the first time they were together instead. The first time that Steve filled him like this, gazing into his eyes, breathing into his mouth,
Steve grins and forces one of Tony’s thighs back further, chasing after every delicious drag of friction. “Is that a promise?”
Steve just watches him: the graceful arcs he makes through the air as he talks with his hands, the way the fine lines around his eyes, appearing more and more each day, crinkle when he considers what type of suit might fit his fighting style best.
Tony laughed, drawing his gaze when he licked his lips, glanced him up and down, and said, “I said we should just jump your bones.”
Steve lets out a heavy breath through his nose and reminds himself why he’s here. This is Tony, his partner. His brand-new husband. They’ve muddled their way through everything else, and they’re going to make it through this one too.
He’s not that selfish. Really, he’s just selfish enough.
“Wow.” Tony gives a slow shake of his head. “That’s… okay. You said you wanted to talk, let’s talk. I’m not going to fight with you tonight. I just won’t, okay? So you can cut it with the passive-aggressive waspy bullshit, Cap.”
Bucky blinks at him. “What?”
The following morning, he almost runs smack into Steve on his way out the door to an SI meeting. Almost instinctually, Steve reaches towards him to steady him with a hand on his elbow and Tony jumps back, heart in his throat. He wills his breathing to settle, because he’s been working on this, really, he has.
.” Tony’s assertion fell on deaf ears.
A dangerous thing after all they’ve been through together.
Maybe they still smelled like him. Steve hoped, anyway.
It doesn’t take long before Steve’s body opens to welcome the intrusion and when Tony pulls his fingers free and braces himself on an arm above Steve’s head, their lips meet again. They share air, share hot, heavy kisses composed of tongue and unspoken promises until Steve can’t think.
“What the hell was that?” Rhodey rounds on him the second Bucky is out of earshot. Or maybe not, hard to tell these days between all the super soldiers and arachnid hybrids hanging around.
Tony scrambles onto Steve’s lap and wraps his thighs around him. He wraps his arms around his neck and holds him fast.
“If you’re pissed all the time, you’ll be useless in training, and on the field. I can set aside a little disagreement, but I won’t trust my teammate to watch my six if he shows up to a mission drowning in booze.” Little disagreement, Tony’s ass.
“Stop, fucking stop.” Tony buries a hand in Steve’s hair and tugs harder than he needs to, “fucking fuck me, Rogers.”
It’s such a terrible cliché, clinging to Steve after he’s knocked on death’s door and managed to walk away some semblance of intact. That he’s survived the end of the world and still finds himself face to face with the ruins of his relationship with his husband. Ex-husband. Not that it matters.
“It never does. It never does.” Her words are soothing and a little regretful but there’s not a hint of condescension in sight.
When it looks like Tony might say something more, Steve holds his breath, but the words don’t come. They’re swept away in the wake of a fresh set of sobs, and Steve closes his eyes. The storm comes on quickly, and he holds Tony through it until his breaths even and slow.
Steve rolls his eyes but he knows this game, leaning back against the couch with him and shaking out his shoulders before giving Tony a look that’s composed solely of disapproving eyebrows.
The benefit is the perfect place for the announcements, both the expansion of the Maria Stark Foundation relief efforts, and the presentation of the newly appointed Avengers. Or at least, that’s what Tony has been told by Ross, the puppet master himself. Last week, he’d been told everyone was in agreement.
Maybe Tony had been greedy, soaking up Steve’s love and affection under the pretense that it was bottomless and there was no reason to conserve. He could drink his fill, full to the brim and never have to consider that he was working with rations.
“Just made my life harder.” Bucky props a foot up on the table and Tony thinks it’s a barrier if he’s ever seen one. “Because then I had two scrappy little twigs to look after. Damn, am I glad things have changed. Actually, why don’t you focus on looking out for me now, punk?”
as if I’m some empty-headed moron?”
“Couples have been through worse.”
“Fine.” Tony throws one of the arrow tips onto the workbench with an underlying petulance and leans back opposite to her, plucking the coffee from her hands. Without breaking eye contact, he takes a long, scorching pull.
“Grab Toto, Dorothy, you’re coming back stateside.” Oops. Can’t blame that on the booze yet.
The wings are spread across one of his longer work-benches, and he’s been trying to work out some of the kinks, maybe add a little more firepower, even.
There’s still that part of Tony that wants it to hurt. He can blame Steve afterward if it hurts. But this soft, loving stroking that Steve’s set on makes him want to cry. It’s too good. Tony doesn’t deserve this. If he wasn’t good enough for Steve before, he shouldn’t be good enough for him now just because he’s spreading his legs again and desperate enough to let Steve back into the confines of his body.
“If it makes you feel any better, when Sam and I were getting heated after our training session last week–just a bad session, we’ve been workin’ our shit out–Steve tried to step in to defend Sam. We’re mostly good now, so I told him as much and reminded him that, if anyone, he’s the reason for the braces by putting us all on that field in the first place. I thought he was going to pass out.”
“It’s not enough. The suit—We’ve got a better chance if you—”
Tony’s still watching the flickering of orange, a remnant of the swirling magic Strange has conjured up and stepped through. Magic makes him twitchy.
“Did I miss it?” He demands, skidding to a stop between a startled Pepper and Colonel Rhodes. Through the glass he can see Tony on the table, bare from the neck down with a hospital blanket tucked around his hips. The doctors are milling around him, and he can’t get a good look at him. He can’t catch his eye.
That had been months ago.
“Oh, good, maybe you’ll be able to help me then. It’s been pinchin’ at the shoulder like a motherfucker and the resident genius, who apparently doesn’t mind
Steve’s face swims before his eyes and he squints into the sun until black swirls and flickers of colour whisk it away. One day, home and New York and Steve won’t be synonymous and Tony will be able to tolerate the city again.
Tony discovers time travel and drives out to the Compound, shield in his trunk, and has an uncomfortable reconciliation with Steve. It’s superficial, as they shake hands and talk about moving on with the word resentment tossed between them. As if such a menial world could fully capture the battleground where their future together went to die in the waste of Siberia and never came home again.
It’s like he’s seeing Tony Stark in an entirely new light, even though he’s been there all along. Steve hasn’t ruled out that this may be him finally acknowledging what’s always been there. Whether he labels it attraction or not, the way Tony needles and barbs, the way he rubs against him in all the wrong ways, has a certain appeal. It’s maddening, but still Tony has been the one thing keeping him grounded since they woke him up.
The look Steve gives him is not unlike the look he gives his battle plans and strategies, eyes working Tony over as if he’s a map into a Hydra base with a special tactic locked somewhere within his skin. It’s all Captain America, cool and composed as ever.
“Spend a lot of time dreaming about me, huh Rogers?”
Is it consciousness after death?
“Come on, sailor, let’s find a bunk and you can take your time warming me up,” Tony teased, his shaky voice a far cry from his usual lecherous humour as he dug his elbow into Steve’s side. It startled a laugh out of Steve all the same.
Steve doesn’t even have the audacity to make it a question, saying it so quietly he wouldn’t be surprised if no one else realizes it was an order.
, at war with feeling affronted and disappointed, and winning more every day.
“The issue with the serum,” Tony elaborates. “You still have it, that hasn’t actually changed. Whatever you were dosed with was just a series of transmission blockers that interfere with chem uptake. The base components of the serum don’t have access to the necessary receptors so the serum can’t reproduce itself.”
How does
It was the kind of silence that came over him when his mind was made up. When every piece of the puzzle had fallen into place and the master tactician had settled on a final outcome. Why had no one ever told Steve that the endgame didn’t need to result in self-sacrifice?
Tony wants to hold him, he realizes, and that shakes him more violently still.
“How long?” Tony croaks, eyes searching the ground as if it holds the answers. “How long have you known?”
, he almost says, but doesn’t.
Maybe Steve ignores him, maybe he doesn’t care. Maybe that response doesn’t compute with Steve’s filtered way of experiencing the world, because he doesn’t grace Tony with a response. Instead, he tips his head to the side and says, “I love you, Tony.”
He opened the door and the billionaire very nearly fainted, his supersoldier husband not very far behind. They had both seen the pictures Tony had found in HYDRA’s files. Tony had seen them first and then Steve had been shown by SHIELD. But all of the pictures and descriptions in the world couldn’t have prepared them for this.
“I love your personality.”
“Yeah, I'm right behind you.” As the two left to suit up, Steve told Bucky, “I'm sorry, but we have to go. Anything could be going on in Vienna.”
, she can't have it,” Steve huffed. “You can't just give away my... things.”
Tony and Clint snorted, amused at Sam's nonsense. Rhodey and Natasha smiled.
equation where Steve picks me over you. I know it seems like it's up to Steve, but he'll pick you, so that means it's your choice. Now, I don't want to lose him.” Tony knew he was basically begging. “But more importantly to you,
Now, it was like he was
. This is an
“You suck his dick every night?”
The Accords were finalized the second week of May. Likely thanks to the Avengers' role saving the UN members from the Winter Soldiers, the version of the Accords that was ratified was even more lenient than the one Tony had written.
“Yeah? How's that going?”
They moved together for a long while. Steve maintained a slow tempo the entire time, but slowed further or even paused several times when he felt like one of them was getting too close. He would switch between kissing Bucky, running a hand through his long hair, and just enjoying the feeling of Bucky moving in and out of him and his hands on his body.
Natasha recovered first. “Wait. Did you say the oral sex lasts fifteen minutes? I mean... that's a long time. Doesn't your face hurt? Does Tony really take that long to...?”
“Steve?”
Sam and Clint stood up from their spots. “Steve,” Sam said.
Tony took a deep breath to calm himself. He thought he'd gotten past these feelings when they first came about. “I've done the math, alright? And there is
Bucky's whole body startled. “Ahhhh,” he exclaimed in surprise. When he recovered his faculties, he looked down at Steve. “You use your mouth now, huh?”
Steve wanted to return the favor with Bucky's shirt, but his didn't have a closure to open, and Steve couldn't bear to stop kissing Bucky for even a moment. He easily ripped it down the middle, causing Bucky to flinch and chuckle lightly. He let the destroyed t-shirt flutter to the floor.
idea,” Steve added. He still sounded irritated.
. Instead of telling us what to do via a panel, they'll send two representatives to join the team as full-fledged Avengers. Their representatives will be responsible for knowing all the UN and Accords rules, and the two of them together may veto team decisions on the UN's behalf.
Steve sputtered and raised his voice. “I don't have sex with you three times a day out of politeness!”
Steve gestured for Tony to continue.
“I can take it,” Steve insisted.
“Barnes is already scheduled to be interviewed by doctors and intelligence officers assigned by the United States government.”
Steve placed his hands gently on Bucky's head, tucking his growing hair behind his ears to get a better view of his face. He felt the round head of Bucky's cock probe at his hole, and he held his breath. He had never been so ready for anything in his entire life.
“Fine. I believe you. But you still can't run those prints.
Steve stopped in his tracks. He wasn't used to being overruled; he didn't like it. “Excuse me?” he demanded.
Steve had other plans. He wedged himself between Bucky's ankles and ran his hand up Bucky's right lower leg. He looked Bucky in the eye and planted a tiny kiss on his knee.
“So if you know what's good for you, you'll stand down.” Agent Ross started walking back to the door. “Order takeout,” he suggested. He opened the door and stepped outside. Before he closed the door, he finished, “Watch a movie.”
Tony left the room immediately and could be seen making a call on his phone. Everyone except Bucky and Wanda stood from their chairs and talked over each other while responding to Ross.
As the only couple there, Steve and Tony were obviously going to take the master bedroom. Clint, Sam, and Rhodey offered to share a room so Natasha could have privacy, but she wanted to split a bunk bed with Clint. That left Sam and Rhodey to divvy up their three beds as they saw fit. Vision didn't need a bed for obvious reasons.
“Do they still hang traitors?” Natasha asked.
Steve uprooted more grass as he lurched to a halt a couple feet from Bucky, Vision silent at his flank. Steve and Bucky stared at each other for a moment. “Do you know me?”
Steve threw the covers off himself and “assumed the position,” so to speak, on his knees with his hands gripping the headboard. “Come on,” he ordered.
Bucky and Wanda exchanged a look, then Wanda took hers off and handed it to Natasha.
Bucky cocked his head. Steve had always been adept in bed, but he had never been insatiable. If he recalled correctly, a few times a month worked just fine for Steve. “...You want to go twice in a row?”
“Yeah,” Steve said, unenthusiastically. He stared at the floor and seemed to be deep in thought.
Bucky looked at Steve, then again at Tony. He didn't say anything.
“Yes you do.”
Steve narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms. “I think your technology doesn't always work the way you want it to. Weren't you having a problem interfacing with the UN's software just this morning?”
Everybody looked at Clint. Natasha was the last one to check in. Several anxious seconds went by before his phone chirped and he announced, “Tasha's fine.”
“Second, it allows different countries to give us more or less latitude. We're US-based, and President Ellis is a big fan since I... you know... saved his life. Our operations stateside are not likely to be affected. Wakanda... well, they're reclusive, anyways, so let's not take it personally if they don't want us there at all. Most countries will fall somewhere in the middle.
“-That's not his
“You know what? It's cool, I'll just rephrase.”
“Now here's what you're going to do. You're going to look him in the eye, you're going to shake his hand, you're going to thank him for his service to and sacrifice for this country and the world, you're going to apologize for being a dick, and you're going to call him 'Sergeant Barnes' while you do it. If not, I expect your resignation on my desk by morning.” The hologram disappeared.
Steve sighed, half a smile on his lips. “Yeah.”
Tony wished life had a “control+Z” function because this was not what he wanted. Now that he had his attention, though, he said, “Steve, I'm so sorry.”
Everyone marveled at what they all felt was a really stupid move.
“Tony,” Steve interrupted.
He easily found his way to the correct room on the fifth floor. He closed and locked the door, then activated his little sound-canceling machine without being noticed by the room's sleeping occupant. Some more of his tech crawled onto the patient's bed and secured the man's wrists and ankles.
Backpay aside, Tony's and Ellis's plan was going to require some quid pro quo. There would be evaluations by mental health professionals and debriefings by intelligence officers from various organizations. Of course there would. He had to allow Tony and a team of the world's foremost prosthesis designers to study his metal arm; despite being created in the 1940s, it was the most advanced artificial arm on the planet. Being able to recreate its functionality would greatly improve the lives of many people who are missing limbs.
“That's fine.”
A few hours later, the remaining members of the team were gathered in the living area with snacks to watch the Accords on the international news. It was going well. The UN agreed to delay the vote in order to review Tony's counter-proposal, like Natasha expected them to.
“Mr. Stark has already determined you to be free of sexually transmitted infections,” FRIDAY chirped helpfully.
That was even worse than Steve thought. “Oh God. Don't tell Tony; I'll never live it down.”
The rest of the team dwelled, though. Every one of them stared at Tony from the corner of their eyes, as if they thought they were being subtle.
Steve backpedaled, hands up defensively. “Guys, I'm
“You're probably right,” Tony agreed without moving to take off his armor.
“I want to feel you for a month.”
Steve returned to staring into nothing. “I'm not mad at you. I know you didn't do it on purpose. But I don't feel like talking, so if you could just....” He let his sentence trail off, not actually having to tell Tony to leave him alone for his request to be understood.
“On my ass?”
Tony stayed on the helipad. “You guys go ahead,” he said. “I have some business to take care of; I should be home before dark.” He hugged Steve. Steve even kissed him delicately on the lips despite his discomfort with PDA, pleasantly surprising the crap out of Tony.
Steve was embarrassed again. He went back to staring at nothing. He sat there, practically catatonic, the entire rest of the time while they awaited the UN's psychiatrist. T'Challa seemed disturbed by his behavior, but everyone else took it in stride as they returned one-by-one.
Bucky narrowed his eyes at him but moved his hand from Steve's mouth.
“Nah, Steve, we should respect their wishes.” Sam addressed the Soldiers directly. “Can you guys come back a week from Friday? We gotta submit an official request to save the lives of these
Steve got off the jet last. He looked at Bucky with the intent to greet him, but something made him stop in the middle of the ramp. There was something... different. It took Steve a moment to figure out what had changed. Bucky was
“They were two years ago,” Bucky said. “After they received the serum, they proved too dangerous for even HYDRA to wield. HYDRA didn't want the money and effort to go to waste, so they just left them in cryo until they could figure out what to do with them. That was,” he paused to recollect the date and do the math, “more than twenty years ago.”
“Great.” Tony sighed in relief. “It's settled. So me and Steve, well, we're already engaged. You two... uh... whatever. Barnes and I will get to know each other. In maybe a few months, get together and see if we want to upgrade from 'Steve has two boyfriends' to a real throuple. I'll let the others know so you don't have to sneak about the compound, but you guys are gonna have to figure out if and when to go public. Now I really do have some things I gotta take care of.” He went to leave the room.
,” Tony corrected. “Polygamy is having multiple spouses, which... not technically legal in this country; polyamory is just loving more than one person. Technically,
“No, no. This isn't about you and Steve. If you invented a super-dildo, I want in.”
Within a few hours of the bombing, Steve, Sam, and Clint landed at the UN building, fully-suited, and met up with the rest of the team. Steve handed off the suits FRIDAY had sent with them for Tony and Rhodey and asked for a situation report, preferring to get straight to work. As much as Tony would have liked a hug and a kiss from his fiancé, Steve made it clear a while back that he was uncomfortable with public displays of affection when they were in professional situations.
They took off and flew most of the way to the compound without incident. But then there
we're all comfortable presenting to the UN? I think they're meeting for this tomorrow.”
First, there was the matter of the backpay that Bucky was due. His official status with the military was seventy years of being a POW followed by two years being missing in action. Federal policy dictated that the United States government owed him his Sergeant salary for the duration, and Tony's lawyers made sure they adjusted for inflation. Bucky was looking at over two million dollars, probably in a few weeks or a month.
Tony fiddled with the Quinjet controls. “Yeah, I'm sure you find sex with me all manner of satisfactory.”
Tony couldn't have that. “Oh, we're not done. Because you see, you should be grateful to me, too. There's no one here to stop me from cutting off your fingers... or your eyelids... or your dick. That's my gift to you: I will graciously allow you to keep your body parts. But if you ever,” he got as close to the Commander's face as he could without touching and emphasized, “
Bucky managed an extra hour with Steve by his side, but it still fell short of a full night by a wide margin. He ended up getting out of bed and intended to just wander around the compound's residential area until FRIDAY spoke to him:
“Can you text us the location of the base?” Tony asked.
Steve shrugged. “It's not like I mark it on the calendar! Maybe once a month?” he guessed.
Bucky looked Ross dead in the eyes for several long seconds while everyone watched nervously. Finally, he collected himself enough to slowly say, “Do. Not. Call. Me. The. Winter. Soldier.” He took a deep breath and huffed one last time, then turned to leave.
Natasha tried to explain what happened. “We didn't do anything to T'Challa. The tac team was being deliberately antagonistic toward Steve. They left the-”
“Guys, wait!” Sam shouted urgently.
“Rhodey's okay.”
“I'm a rational kind of guy. Besides, I've had two years to plan for this exact scenario.”
“Tony, please, it's not a big deal. Can't you just drop it?”
Tony was done with Steve's restraint. “So do your goddamn job. Pop in there and let them know there's a problem. At least evacuate the UN members.”
jumping to conclusions.”
Ross glared again. “For being... discourteous.”
“What about wiped from your mind?” Wanda asked.
The second was emptiness. Not like there was something missing in his life or soul, but a literal physical emptiness. Bucky had been inside of him for two and a half amazing, exhausting hours, yet somehow... “It's not enough,” he realized aloud.
After they were introduced, Tony got to the other new members. Unlike the the UN appointees and pretty much every other Avenger, the new guys preferred to keep their real identities secret. He introduced Ant-Man and the Wasp, who had the ability to shrink and grow themselves and other things, and he introduced Spiderman, who he described as a sticky parkour enthusiast who wished he were Tarzan. He had nothing left to announce, so he opened the floor for questions.
“Thank you,” T'Challa said to Steve. He picked the iron dildo up from his table, then stood in front of the Commander as he examined it. Eventually, he spoke to the Commander. “The Avengers have spent the last four years trying to protect this planet. If it weren't for them, the alien Loki would have taken over Earth, and every last one of us would have been killed or enslaved. We owe them a debt.
After Steve, Wanda, Sam, and Clint recovered from the shock of what happened, they all pulled out their phones to text members of their team to see who was okay. They got responses immediately.
Bucky put the flavored abomination back in the pile. He knelt between Steve's thighs and pumped some of the clear lubricant over the first two fingers on his right hand. He swirled the slippery substance with his thumb to get familiar with it, watching it glisten in the fluorescent lighting. He tried it out on the head of his penis. It felt silky; he found he preferred it over the KY they used in the late thirties and early forties. It was cool, but it warmed as he spread it most of the way down the shaft.
Steve shook his head. He was uncomfortable with Tony's application of the phrase 'sexual assault,' and he didn't disagree with Tony's view of the Commander being a potential sexual predator. But the team's habit of making unilateral decisions without input from the world got them in this mess. “I get that he's dangerous, but that doesn't mean his identity isn't classified by the UN. If you want to make an issue out of this, you need to go through the proper channels, or else you risk the team and everything we could accomplish. The answer is no, Tony, now delete that,” he waved his hand in the general direction of Tony's phone, “information you scanned.”
“That's fine,” Agent Ross said. “I can say what I need to say without shouting.”
The Commander looked a little relieved.
Agent Ross looked at each of them in turn, sour expression on his face. To his credit, he did keep his voice down when he spoke. “The King of Wakanda was in your company for less than a day, and now he's beating UN commandos unconscious with a metal dildo. What the hell did you do to him?”
“That's probably because I'm not inside you,” Bucky pointed out. He was kneeling behind Steve by then. He placed a hand on Steve's tense back. Something about this felt wrong. Bucky's sex drive was much higher than Steve's; they'd never been in the situation where Steve wanted sex and Bucky didn't. Beyond that, though, was how Steve was acting.
He pulled Bucky's body tight against his own and returned the kiss much harder than he could have with Tony. Their teeth clicked against each other as their tongues swirled together, both men needing to taste all of the other. Bucky slid his hands up Steve's back and around to his chest, where he knew Steve's suit's zipper to be. He pulled it open and struggled slightly to get the sleeves over Steve's arms since Steve was reluctant to take his hands off Bucky.
That stopped Tony in his tracks. He turned around. “Yes, Your Highness.” Gotta be respectful. No need to piss off UN members with his patented Stark sass.
Steve looked up at him abruptly from his seat between Tony and Bucky. He had not been expecting such an about-face in the last 24 hours. He seemed hopeful.
He sighed and let his first point linger for a moment. “Second point. We can't sign them.”
Tony raised a pointed finger as if he were going to argue. But then he shut his mouth and lowered his hand. “So that is a fair point, but I am certain that no one is eavesdropping. I promise.”
The Avengers reveled in Ross's embarrassment at being dressed-down in front of them by President Ellis. Ross scowled and sighed. He did as he was ordered, though. He looked Bucky in the eye and extended his hand. “Thank you, Sergeant Barnes, for your service and your sacrifices for our country and our planet.” He would have looked more comfortable having a prostate exam in front of a live audience.
“-but his muscles are so overpowered, his asshole nearly ripped my dick off.”
“Please tell me they're still on ice,” Natasha said.
The security guard was about to say something when a brief but loud cacophony of terrified screams erupted from the room, followed by total silence. The whole thing lasted maybe two seconds. The guard looked at the door, then at the Avengers.
They parted, and Tony headed back to the Quinjet.
They entered at the back center of the room. There were three curved rows of five tables, and at each table sat two chairs. The rows had a mild stadium seating effect in that each row was two steps higher than the one in front if it. The front of the room had large screens that were off at the moment. The sides of the room were lined with computer stations.
“Go get 'em, Security Man!” Tony said with mock exuberance. He held both his thumbs up in a sarcastic show of support. “You got this!”
It was a short-ish middle-aged white man with graying blond hair and wearing a gray suit and navy blue tie. He showed Steve a badge and identification card as he introduced himself. “Agent Everett Ross, CIA. I'm here regarding the mission to apprehend the Winter Soldiers in Siberia.” His words were respectful, but his tone of voice and facial expression radiated this attitude that Steve didn't care for.
Some members murmured among themselves. They seemed to come to a consensus way quicker than he'd have ever credited to a bureaucratic body. One member spoke up on their behalf. “We concede that James Buchanan Barnes has an alibi. This presents an equally serious matter, however, for we do not concede this as proof that he was not involved. After being missing for years, it is quite the coincidence that he resurfaced just in time to require that his location is accounted for.”
“Shut it down, Tony!” Steve sounded nearly hysterical... which was totally fair.
Natasha stopped fiddling with her phone in order to watch the disaster that she expected would unfold in front of her. Steve looked at Tony. He still had that look on his face, only now it was directed at Tony.
The next morning, the entire team, plus Bucky, was assembled at the conference room table to continue their discussion regarding the Sokovia Accords. Tony stood up at the head of the table and addressed everyone. “Before we open the floor to discussion, I have three very important points to make.”
he mouthed and pantomimed. “You two owe Steve a huge apology when we get back!” He whispered, “Iron Man colors,” gave them a thumbs-up, and followed Steve and Natasha into the Quinjet.
what all this is about: some salacious fantasy of manipulating me into having a threesome.”
“I don't know.”
, alright? Good job keeping your cool in there, though; I know what was a tense situation. And Tasha, I'm sorry about... I didn't mean to grab your arm. I was just worried you were gonna beat the entire tac team to death with that thing.”
The Avengers had just been informed that the United Nations was drawing up a document that was being called the Sokovia Accords. These Accords would make any non-U.N.-sanctioned action by any Avenger illegal. They could get on board or risk prison.
“A conservative estimate,” Vision answered.
Most of the Avengers engaged in a tense argument about the Accords. They were pretty evenly split, but the most notable split was between Steve and Tony, who only last week had formally announced to the world that they were engaged to be married. This came as a surprise to most of the world, moreso than it had been to the team when they announced their three-year relationship to them over the holidays.
, FRIDAY?” Bucky asked, certain the AI was still paying attention.
Sam yelled, “Stop calling the man by his slave name!”
Bucky stood there and didn't reply as the rest of the Avengers arrived to back him up.
Steve and Bucky realized Tony was right. They let go of each other and made their way toward the damaged front door of the compound, Steve's arm around Bucky's back out of fear that Bucky would try to flee. As they passed Tony, Steve reached out to him and gave his armored hand a soft squeeze.
April, 2016.
But really, the surprise had everything to do with the fact that no one aside from Vision, Pepper, Happy, and Wanda had suspected a thing. Steve was always such an above-board kind of guy and Tony just did not give a fuck what anybody thought, so it was weird enough that they'd bothered to hide it. Plus, they were both perpetually in the spotlight, and they literally worked in close quarters with a few world-class spies, so the fact that they were able to hide their relationship was amazing.
Bucky moved out and in again and again, attempting to find a rhythm. Steve couldn't hold on for more than seven thrusts before he was cumming even sooner than expected, and Bucky followed suit one thrust later. Bucky collapsed in a heap on top of Steve, the two of them devolving into giggles in seconds. Bucky rolled off of Steve, and they recovered from their laughter.
Bucky was immediately stressed out. “I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All anyone has to do is say the goddamn words. What does he want with me?”
Tony shrugged. “In the long term, it might involve us
They continued to kiss, but Steve was still overdoing it, so Bucky had to stop. “Steve,” he said, turning his head to prevent additional contact. “Are you trying to kiss me or eat me?”
Steve took a deep breath. He really didn't want to be any closer to these people than he had to be, but the intel was the whole reason they were there. He scooped up the Winter Soldier manual, walked up to the front of the room, about four feet away from the Commander, and addressed the tactical team. He told them everything he knew about the Winter Soldiers, starting with when Bucky was taken by HYDRA. He ignored the Commander's inappropriate comments about his relationship with Bucky and talked over him. He told them about the brainwashing and the cryostasis.
Steve's expression became more stern. “We agreed it's too dangerous. I thought that was behind us.”
Natasha stopped Bucky outside the jet, Steve and Tony at her side. “Probably best to stay away from him,” she said, showing him the book. “I think he knows the words.” Clearly, she'd already explained the words to Steve and Tony.
“The tac team just came back. It seems they're using the code words to control the Winter Soldiers and are bringing them into the UN so they can ask the UN if they can add them to their team.”
“How did-” Bucky shook his head, not wanting to know how Tony was able to run those tests. He picked up a hot pink vial. “Strawberry flavored,” he read aloud. He looked over the many tubes again. “Why are there so many lubes in the twenty-first century? I'm trying to have my way with you, but now I gotta sit here and read a hundred tiny bottles.”
Tony removed another pre-filled syringe from his bag and showed it to the Commander. Then he screwed it into the port on the IV line closest to the IV site. He made sure to stare at the Commander's face as he slowly injected the drug. After it was all in, that syringe went into the sharps container, too.
? We just had more sex than we'd ever had in a month.”
Bucky looked at his hand, then looked at Tony, who'd moved aside to give him access. At Tony's encouraging nod, Bucky leaned slightly across the table and took Ross's hand.
“You're not 'in the way,' Tony.”
“Two hours and thirty-one minutes,” she answered.
Steve and the Commander stared aggressively at each other from about two inches apart. Steve knew this was a bad idea. He ought to stand down. But the angel on his shoulder telling him to cool his jets was losing to the little devil that was rightfully pointing out that this guy deserved the ass-beating Steve was about to give him and anyone who tried to back him up. He waited for twitch, a blink, anything at all to spur him to action.
“What's going on?” Wanda asked.
After a couple seconds, everyone scrambled to follow Steve.
“We don't execute unarmed prisoners, Buck,” Steve admonished.
Tony sighed. “Thank you.”
Ross glared at Tony, but continued. “And I apologize.”
Tony wasn't laughing out loud. This sucked, and Bucky wasn't funny. He returned his attention to the UN. “As you can see, Sergeant Barnes has an alibi for the time the photo was taken. He's obviously being framed.”
“How about a compromise? I won't run either of them until after the Accords are settled.”
“That's not bad,” Tony mumbled.
Just before the two-hour mark, a couple members of the UN showed up at the Quinjet's ramp with a strange man. Everyone, including Steve, stood to greet them. The man was identified as Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva, and he was tasked with determining how much of a threat Bucky was.
Steve was seated at the far end of the front row, to the right of Natasha. When he pulled his chair back, he saw that someone had left what appeared to be a dark gray solid metal phallus sitting upright in his spot. Natasha saw it, too, and snatched it before he had the chance to react. He put a gentle hand on her arm and looked her in the eye as the tac team members giggled at their bigoted prank.
“-here regarding the Sokovia Accords.”
Then the audio came blaring through, sharing with the UN and the world forgotten seconds of a several-hours-long conversation that was never meant for public consumption. It opened halfway through one of Tony's sentences:
“I gotta call Bucky and Wanda, let them know what's going on,” Steve announced, prompting Tony to give him enough space to sit up and collect his phone from the coffee table. He made the call.
Ross's mood wasn't softened. He scoffed and sputtered at the President's comment. “Mr. President... the Winter Soldier-”
Seven Avengers and King T'Challa strode purposefully down the Quinjet ramp at the UN headquarters in Vienna with their prisoner, Colonel Helmut Zemo, in tow. Steve and Tony led the procession through the main doors off the helipad, where they met their assigned contact.
Tony turned around to face his fiancé. “Yeah.”
Tony added, “I feel like you're on the fence about this. You don't know me, and you certainly don't owe me anything, but you were friends with my dad. Maybe that's enough to buy me a chance.”
He followed Bucky's collarbones to the other side of his body, making his way down the left much like how he made his way up the right. He spent more time on his left shoulder and arm than he did the right. The shoulder was massively scarred along the edge of his metal arm, and then there was the matter of the arm itself. Steve hadn't exactly gotten to inspect it two years prior, and he tried not to pry when Bucky first showed up. He gave this arm and hand the same treatment as the other, though there were no scars to focus on. No matter who designed the arm or why, it was a part of Bucky now, which means Steve loved it.
The first time, the twelve-second time, they'd both just missed each other so much. The second time? Well, they were making up for lost time, weren't they? Bucky felt satiated and loved. This felt entirely different. Steve's desperation felt different. He was acting like an involuntarily sober alcoholic digging through rubble in search of an unbroken bottle of rum.
Everybody in the room turned their attention from the Accords to watch the screen. Tony only saw the look of shock, horror, and relief on Steve's face for about a blink of an eye before the larger man was a blur, leaving random pages of paper to flutter violently in the air in his wake. It was easy for Tony to forget how damn fast Steve was when he was relaxing at home in civilian clothes, and then this happens, and he's reminded that he's engaged to Sonic the Hedgehog.
at work getting Tony to sleep.”
“One: Steve would never, ever harm me if he didn't really have to. I won't speculate on what it would take, but the circumstances would have to be extreme to say the least.
Tony looked at the photos. The first one he recognized easily. It was from that day at the UN when he'd accidentally broadcast a private discussion internationally. Steve was as angry as Tony had ever seen him, and Tony himself? He looked terrified. He sighed and showed for the record what image was being referenced. “Some of you may remember this from a couple weeks ago. I admit I look scared in this picture, but at no point was I afraid that he'd physically harm me. I was afraid he'd dump me, which would actually be worse.” He started flipping through the rest of the photos. Mostly, they were just images of him with visible bruises. “Am I supposed to be looking at suspicious bruises here? Do I need to remind you that I'm a superhero?”
of lube. What, no condoms?” he joked.
“Like you swabbing my butt cheek for 'touch DNA?'”
. What is wrong with you?”
“This is a long time coming, Bucky coming back. Seventy-two years... I can't even imagine....” Tony took a breath. “Look, you're both very emotional right now, so I just want you to know that if he kisses you-”
“Doesn't matter; it's '
Steve looked sheepish. “Sorry.” He kissed Bucky some more, gently this time, like he had learned to be with Tony. He planted little kisses on his lips, down the side of his face, and back up the other side. He got back around to Bucky's lips, then got distracted by his increasingly uncomfortable untouched erection and feeling Bucky's up against him. “You know, Buck, I thought we were gonna do more than kiss.”
Tony thought about it.
Natasha was connecting the dots. She asked Tony, “Did you try to give yourself a super-soldier serum just to improve your sex life?”
“You stopped.”
“Oh, I'm sorry,” Clint said sarcastically over the deafening silence in the room. “Were you watching that?”
“Tony's fine.”
Ross seemed to resist the urge to say something else as he retreated from the room.
“I know. Because you're a very polite person.”
The first was just this sense of rightness in being next to Bucky again, of having his eternally loyal companion's naked body spooned against his.
Rhodey, Clint, Natasha, and Sam were sitting around the dining table finishing breakfast. The UN members were filing into the building to begin discussing Tony's Accords. The Avengers were not invited to the assembly.
“No.”
Steve crossed his arms. “Enlighten me.” His expression softened when Bucky closed the closet door and joined them wearing pajama pants and a Captain America licensed tee.
Tony broke up the handshake. “Alright, Richard, you're done here. Get out of my house.”
Steve's jaw dropped, and he gasped. “Wh- That's not-” He looked at Tony. He could read his fiancé well. Tony was trying to hide embarrassment and hurt behind a sardonic half-grin. “Tony, you satisfy me,” Steve swore.
Steve was too emotional to form words. He turned and walked silently out of the room, presumably headed back to the Quinjet to be alone with his humiliation.
Tony got in the Commander's face again. “You know how many layers of redundant security go into hiding a man like yourself. I want you to think about how easy it was for me to find you. How easy it was for me to walk in here, unimpeded, and inject whatever I want into your worthless body. That could have been anything. Ricin. Cyanide. Potassium. Insulin. Lye. Just a shit ton of assorted bacteria. HIV.” Tony smiled. Then he chuckled. He hated this man and was having a great time watching him suffer... and the drug hadn't even kicked in yet.
“Why?” Tony demanded. “It's not like you can
“You have anything else he touched?”
Inside the building, Steve noticed a flurry of activity that wasn't there a few minutes prior. One of Tony's drones approached them and greeted Bucky in FRIDAY's voice. “Welcome to the Avengers Compound, Sergeant Barnes. Allow me to show you to your quarters.” It gestured toward the compound's living area where all their rooms were located.
FRIDAY's voice cut through unexpectedly. “Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes has just arrived by foot on the compound. He appears to be heading for the front door.” She put video of his approach on the nearest screen.
Toni woke up the next morning in a cold bed, alone. Steve had already left for his morning run. She got up slowly, savoring the feel of her bed, before heading into the shower. Letting the hot water run down her back, she looked at the ring on her finger, the one that she vowed she’d never take off willingly. Toni looked long and hard at that ring and thought about everything that went with it.
Peggy was sleeping without nightmares and talking more and more. She usually wouldn’t tell Steve or Tony but if they told Dr. Turner, she’d wheedle it out by the end of the session. Most of Peggy’s fears seemed to stem from her life before she’d been adopted. There was the problem of her mother just leaving her at the firestation, but until now, no one had realized how far back the issue went.
Peter thought about it for a minute, “Well, you did say there wasn’t a monster under my bed when Uncle Clint was using it as a hiding space.”
“Tony? Can you hear me? Do you know who I am?”
Steve started laughing, “Have we ever lied to you about anything else Peter?”
Again, Tony heard JARVIS saying something. Again, he felt it getting unbearably warm when the temperature hadn’t changed. Again, breathing felt like the hardest thing in the world. Also, again, Tony was severely tired, he probably hadn’t slept in at least three days.
From then on out, Bucky improved rapidly. It turned out that HYDRA had managed to recreate some crude version of the Supersolider serum, meaning that physically, other than his arm, Bucky was fine. Mentally though? It was clear to the whole team that Bucky had been made to do unspeakable things as the Winter Soldier. Unsurprisingly, he bonded with Natasha quite easily.
“Рассвет.”
Steve hiccupped again before he whispered something Tony couldn’t hear.
Tony leveled a missile at the door, “Then what are we waiting for,”
Steve looked up from reading over Tony’s shoulder, “They joined because a Stark weapon killed their parents?”
This is how I imagine Peggy! I wanted to post this with Chapter 1, but didn't know how to. Thanks for your patience!
Peggy had also heard the doors. She slowed her sobbing long enough to see Tony and Steve walking through the door with Peter. Instantly, she was practically throwing herself at them. Sharon was having a hard time not dropping her. Tony reached her first, immediately enveloping his daughter in his arms.
“Over here Cap!” By over here, Tony meant under the hood of his latest hobby project, a 1970 Ford Mustang.
“Please papa! I’ll be good! Please don’t leave! Daddy, don’t leave! Please!”
Tony finished his sandwich and stood up, “Thanks for lunch Cap, but I have to get back to the shop. Suits to improve, deadlines to meet, yada yada.” Tony turned to head to the elevator.
Steve just shrugged and looked down at his shoes.
Peggy head shake was an emphatic no.
For once in his life, Steve wasn’t going to fight it, “No Buck, I’m really not. But it’s a long story. If you don’t have hours to sit and listen, you might want to leave now.”
Peter woke up, not being able to move. He could feel everything, and when he opened his eyes, he could see he was now chained up. For what he didn’t know. He opened his mouth to speak, and let out a scream. He couldn’t see behind him, where the pain was coming from, but it felt like his back was being lit on fire. He knew it wasn’t because there wasn’t a burning smell. He hoped he would pass out at some point, it might make the pain go away.
“Tony, Peter was just fine, why wouldn’t Peggy be?” Pepper was simultaneously working on paperwork.
at him. Really looking. Since he'd arrived a couple days prior, he'd had this perpetually shell-shocked, pseudo-unfocused stare. Even when he looked at Steve and told him he loved him, it seemed like he was remembering more than feeling. Like: yes, this is my childhood friend, brother-in-arms, and first love, Steve.
Steve got the joke, but he frowned. Jeopardizing the safety of everyone in this room wasn't funny. “Sam-” he started.
“Did someone say threesome?” Bucky asked, walking out of the bathroom wearing a bathrobe. He headed to the closet to pick out some clothes and change behind the open closet door.
!” Steve and Bucky
The six Avengers left in the living area stared at the each other in silence. After a minute, Clint asked, “Are we prisoners?” He laughed. “How did that happen?”
In the early afternoon, around the same time the Quinjet was landing at the compound, Tony was walking into an Austrian hospital. He'd done his research. This was the shift change, the time many of the morning nurses would be giving report to the afternoon nurses. That included the unit he needed to get into.
Then he removed his wig, deactivated his mask, and woke the patient with a harsh poke over the bandage on his head. “Wake up, dickhead.”
. I don't know anything. They just keep me around to make the coffee.” He turned to the rest of the team. “Am I up, guys? You need coffee?”
Bucky hugged Steve. “I
All eight Avengers on board turned to him. Zemo wanted their attention? He had it.
are you
a lot better.” He pulled out of the hug, then looked around them as if he were unsure of something. “Come with me.” He lead Steve into the compound away from potentially prying eyes and didn't stop until they were in his room. Once the door was shut, he pulled Steve close and kissed him.
“Oh, I suck it more than
Wanda promised to watch out for Bucky. Steve thanked her and caught up with Sam and Clint. Then, the three of them left for Vienna, leaving Wanda and Bucky alone at the compound.
“When the authorities hear that the Winter So-”
The Avengers left the UN control room and allowed their contact, who waited for them as he'd promised, to show them to their temporary quarters. It was a three-bedroom suite clearly designed for visiting dignitaries with large families. There was a living space, a kitchen, and an eight-person dining table. The master bedroom had a king bed and a crib. The other two bedrooms were nearly identical and boasted a bunk bed across from a twin bed, for a capacity of three per room.
“And kind of a jackass!” Rhodey added helpfully.
Steve and Natasha were the only ones in the jet. The silence in the air was awkward. Natasha was typing something on her phone, or maybe she was playing a game. Steve was slouching in his seat, arms crossed, ankles crossed, staring straight ahead at absolutely nothing with this look on his face that he gets when he's sick to death of humanity's bullshit.
“Be right back,” Bucky said, getting out of bed and heading to the bathroom. A couple minutes went by, and when Bucky returned to the bed, he was clean. He got in his bed next to Steve with the hope of cuddling for a while.
Steve had barely managed to resist the urge to throw himself out of that window, as it was the quickest and most direct way to the yard and, therefore, to Bucky. The longer, more sensible route through the facility and down a few flights of stairs was agony with every step. He hit the front door at too high a speed, blasting it from its hinges instead of flinging it open like he'd intended. A string of divots formed in the grass as he sprinted across the lawn toward Bucky, who stood there and waited for him.
Steve shook his head. They both knew that Tony was the freak and that left everything on the table. Tony left for Vienna half an hour later with Natasha, Rhodey, and Vision.
. But Tony has a point. T'Challa has already seen the book. He knows it's important evidence. If we don't turn it over to the UN, they will never trust us again, and we'll all be on the run forever.”
Tony and Steve tended to get very little sleep. Usually, Steve would help Tony fall asleep, and he'd wind up with a few hours of good-quality rest before waking. If Steve was unavailable, Tony would stay up and tinker until he passed out. It turned out that Bucky was as much an insomniac as Tony. He was a very light sleeper, and he could never manage to sleep more than a couple hours before being instantly wide awake at the slightest noise.
Once Bucky was naked, his next step was to climb on top of Steve, but as soon as he was on the bed, Steve pulled Bucky on top of him. Steve wrapped his arms around Bucky's shoulders and hooked his legs around the backs of Bucky's thighs like some kind of impatient, horny octopus.
Natasha asked, “I thought you boys were going to bed?”
Steve scoffed. “I use it,” he insisted as if he'd been insulted.
you?”
“But not good enough to take at face value. The UN needs to interrogate him to be certain he is not a threat.”
The sentence reverberated in Steve's head. He dropped the phone and practically leapt from the couch in his haste. “The code words don't work on them,” he told his team. “They're faking. Suit up; maybe we can prevent a bloodbath.”
Tony finished putting away his supplies and stood to leave. “It's funny because 'obnoxious jackass' was Steve's first pet name for me.” He kissed Steve on the cheek. “We should be back in a few days. Don't do anything I wouldn't do,” he added with a wink, then he left.
“I gotta be honest, that attitude is a bit nineteen-forties for me. In this century, we understand that touching someone's ass without consent is sexual assault.”
“An obnoxious jackass?” Bucky finished for him.
The jokes about them flirting or “arguing like an old married couple” went out the window once people found out that they were, in fact, a couple. Steve would have killed for one of those jokes right now to temper the mood in the room. He stared down his shiny new fiancé while he fiddled with his shiny new engagement ring. Situations like this were why it took them so long to share their relationship: as much as they both wanted it to work, neither one of them had a lot of hope that it would last very long.
“There are two notable changes. First, it gives the UN
Steve nodded. Despite the fact that a successful mission supported the tac team's decision to leave the Avengers in Vienna, Steve had hoped for his fears to be unfounded. “Good. Do their restraints appear secure? Any idea what the UN plans to do with them?”
He laid little kisses all over Bucky's face and hairline. After enough of those, he planted one, hard, on Bucky's lips. Bucky leaned up into the kiss. Steve reached blindly into the pile of lubes to his right and found the right bottle. As he continued to kiss Bucky, he pumped some lube into his hand. He spread the lube over Bucky's cock, stroking it and slicking it up at the same time.

Bucky squinted at Steve. “More than seventy-two years? I don't need more time, Steve; I just need you.”
“Can you do it?” Steve asked.
Bucky wasn't looking forward to the interviews and interrogations, but he didn't think they were unreasonable. Same for giving Tony and others temporary access to his arm.
yelled this time.
Steve stepped forward and kissed him. “I love you.”
it?! When?!”
,” he instructed FRIDAY. But the connection was still tenuous, and it didn't mute. He heard Bucky start to laugh. He didn't remember exactly what Bucky was going to say next, but he knew it wasn't good, and he desperately repeated, “
The drone exited the bathroom without Bucky, and they heard the shower start to run.
sex life is great. I'm not the one with complaints.”
“Mr. Stark,” King T'Challa addressed him.
“He didn't- It's not like he grabbed me, alright? It was a slap. Guy was all palm. You're not going to find any prints.”
“Is something wrong?” Steve asked.
“What's too dangerous?” Natasha asked.
at work. Tony was the hard one; it was just oral. That's how I get him to sleep. About fifteen minutes of that, then fifteen minutes full-body massage.”
say that.” He took the bracelet from Natasha and read it for himself. And yes: it did say that. He scowled at Wanda, who had the good sense to pretend to be ashamed, and Bucky, who did not. He scoffed and handed the bracelet back to Wanda. “I'm going back to Vienna,” he pouted. Then he stormed onto the Quinjet, Natasha on his heels.
Steve shook his head. He understood what Clint was hinting at just fine. Normally he'd scold him, pointing out that what he and Tony did in private was nobody's business. But time was catching up with Steve; it wasn't the forties anymore. People were open about these things nowadays. There were radio stations dedicated to discussions about sex. People divulged private sexual details on daytime television programs and on social media. Even celebrities sometimes talked about very private things on the late night shows.
Tony indicated to one of the journalists that she had his attention.
The Commander was still smiling, not deterred by T'Challa. “What's that?” he asked.
at him. Now, Steve had been mad at him before. When they first met after Loki arrived on Earth, they did not get along. Tony recalled when they were on the heli-carrier and Steve was growling at him to put his suit on so he could beat the crap out of him. Tony longed for the relatively mild contempt on Steve's face that day. At least then, Steve hadn't been visibly shaking and beet red. Tony had no doubt that Steve wouldn't lay a finger on him in anger now that they were engaged, but still, he flinched.
