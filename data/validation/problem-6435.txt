“Now!” Rogers almost barked when the other man didn’t. He sent an apologetic look at Cooper when he noticed him flinch. “Tony, please, join us for dinner. Everyone will be civil.” He cast a meaningful look across him to where Wanda was sitting.
“All right, rugrats, we really have to go. Do you all remember where the rec room is?” excited little nods are his response, and even Baby Bart is doing it too. “Okay, well, mini-bots, assemble” he says and before he can get another word they’re running out of the room. “Be—“there’s the squeaking of sneakers on his floor and giggling, “careful,” he finishes with a sigh and a shake of his head.
, asked for him before. He’d been trying names for the past few days, but his hadn’t come up since that time during lunch. Now, the baby rubbed his forehead against his mother’s shoulder and whimpered his name again.
“Does that mean you don’t want the other slice I brought you?” and this time Tony’s eyes snap directly to Steve’s. He’s one of the last ones to make his way to the table; his cheeks are dusted pink in what Tony knows is embarrassment and he’s rubbing the back of his neck in embarrassment as everyone else, including Sam and Lang though with three notable absences, brings their own dessert to their impromptu greenhouse picnic.
Steve doesn’t think much about the fact that he doesn’t see Tony, at all, for the first three days after his confrontation with Barton. He understands that whatever happened between them was a long time coming, though he wishes he could have saved both of them the heartache of the whole endeavor. While he is angry at his friend, his company brother in a lot of ways, he also understands that the archer has been thrown way out of his depth. He shoulders the guilt of that, too, in the early hours of the morning when he can fall back asleep.
“Exactly. I thought… well, I thought that the others would understand the UN’s point. I thought they’d see that we were dangerous, and needed reassurance. The alternative… If I had said no,” Tony sighs and scrubs a hand over his face. “The truth is, Cooper, that if I had said no I don’t know what would have happened. Where we are right now would not even exist anymore, maybe. So I said yes, and I immediately started working on a way to amend the accords because—“
The soldier was desperate to ask what they had talked about to incite such a change, but luckily kept his mouth shut. He bounced the baby in his arms a little more desperately as he fussed harder, his cries louder and more heartbreaking.
“Just?” he asked, hand darting forward to hold hers. She stared down at their hand, his so much bigger than her delicate fingers, and smiled sadly. The hope that had stirred in Steve’s chest began to grow into a cold lump.
Peter wrote Tony letters for all of three months. In the end, they started getting shorter and shorter, and he wouldn’t call as much. Natasha, now more comfortable around him, asked him if he needed her to kick anyone’s butt for making him sad. Well, sadder, but he just shook his head and asked her if she was all ready for her new posh school. And then she was off talking about ballet and poses and her teacher and his sadness was all forgotten. The twins were still too littler to really notice, though he noticed Peter Parker headbutted him with more delight and he was about seventy-three percent sure that Harley’s slap had been meant with love that one time.
your mom. Every time he came down to the facility or we called him up at your house, we couldn’t shut him up about you guys. He’d always be telling us how fast Nate was growing, and how smart you and Lila were, and how damn strong your mom was. How she could be able to take over the whole world if she wanted. I’ve lost count of how many conversations we had about how intelligent and beautiful and amazing and kind your mom is.” And it’s true, too, though Tony is embellishing a bit. All those conversations about Laura had come second hand to him, from Steve or Nat or Sam and sometimes even Wanda when she could look past her inherent dislike for the engineering. It doesn’t make Barton’s devotion any less true. “It’s just that, sometimes… well, sometimes dads do things that we can’t understand. Sometimes they make decisions because they think they’re the right ones and we can’t understand them, but we know that they’re just trying to do what’s best for us. Your dad… Cooper, your dad was trying his best to do what he could to protect you. Because he loves you all so damn much.”
There’s a bit of silence, the boys do whatever nonverbal communication they’ve learned, and then Peter places a hand on Harley’s shoulder. The boy seems to deflate, and gives the oldest a weak nod. Steve tries to calm the frantic beating of his heart.
“Tony,” that goddamn voice. How can it still sound the same even after all these months? How can it have the same effect it did back then? Shouldn’t something be different, broken, destroyed beyond repair? “Don’t go.”
Tony looked at Rhodey across the table, but his brother was looking at the captain through narrowed eyes. The room was silent as they waited for his response, and he sensed a panic attack coming. In all of their acquaintance, the captain had never made meetings and debriefings optional. He had always told Tony that it was his job to attend these things. He had always been angry when Tony begged up because of SI or he was tired. Being presented with the choice was surprising, to say the least. Just when he was about to get fully caught in his own head, he met Viz’s eyes. The android was looking at him solemnly and unwaveringly, and Tony found himself settling. The android gave him one serious nod, and Tony felt himself relax.
. And you know what, it wasn’t with Ultron. Thor told you all that I was right, and if I had never tried then Viz wouldn’t be here with us, so fuck you.
drops onto Steve and he has to blink up at the ceiling to keep the tears at bay, Tony’s there to press kisses to his shoulder. He doesn’t say anything. Doesn’t offer empty platitudes or meaningless comfort. He merely lets Steve’s thoughts run their course while he holds his hand.
“What happened?!” Bucky explodes after a while, concern and anger in his tone. “What did that bastard do to you?! Steve, I swear I’ll kill him!”
“Yeah! Right where I didn’t want you to be. Peter, this isn’t one of your school trips. This—this is a one way ticket, okay?” Something in Tony’s face must have shown his terror because Peter takes a step forward with a soft
“You don’t have to worry about me, Cap,” the other man says and even though Steve can’t see his face he is intimately acquainted with the self-deprecating tone to his voice. His arms instinctively tighten around his lover, wishing with all his heart that he could burrow the other man inside so that he can feel just how loved he is.
“It wasn’t his fault,” Steve had said duly, eyes trained on the carpet at his feet. He knew Bucky’s sympathy wouldn’t last for long once he told the truth.
Tony to see it. “Tony, please, think about it. Why in the world would she be there? Did you advertise it?”
running through my mind. Please, just give me something. I’m begging you, just a few hours,” he says quietly.
There’s clatter from the entrance of the greenhouse, and Tony realizes why the other man is speaking so evenly. The kids must have come running when they saw him approach. That, more than anything, is what makes the engineer nod in agreement. He hates that their little piss contest is making the atmosphere around the children so chaotic. He hates that they might break into a screaming match, or even worse a fucking brawl, because they can’t clear the air of their bullshit. They have been around each other for fucking months, and they’ve yet to fix their issues. Steve had been ground zero for him, and he’d managed to talk things out and slap a bandaid on
“Harley!” Tony says sternly. They’ve had a talk about language, too. Well, after Harley’s mom had yelled at Tony for a solid three minutes after yet another conference with the boy’s teacher after Tony had brought him to the compound for a weekend. Who knew kids were such sponges. “I know you hate him, okay, and I know he only says what the Toupee tells him to, but we promised your mom you’d keep your grades up. We’re still making up for the last time.”
“I can’t do this,” the engineer says, almost inaudibly, eyes still closed. Steve’s whole frame jerks like he’s been shocked with a strong current, and his hands drop from Tony’s face as if he’s been burned. Tony’s eyes spring open and he catches the devastated look on the soldier’s face. It chips at the fragile part of his heart that Tony has tried to keep hidden. “No, no,” he says quickly and makes a desperate swipe to grab the blond’s wrist.
Steve chuckles and offers his hand before Tony can retort. He doesn’t miss the way Tony straightens as he looks at them or the quick glance the boy shoots at his mechanic. He knows how important this is. Has seen the genius interact with all the children. And while his shot at a good impression is impossible at this point, he still wants to start this acquaintance as amicably as possible.
“Yeah, actually,” Tony says, surprising himself. Rhodey’s face shows the same emotion, and Tony smiles softly, closing his eyes and leaning to nuzzle Morgan’s soft hair. “Just not right now. I just—”
“What kind of news?” She asks, her accent thickening with nerves. She’s wringing her hands the way Steve has noticed she does when her anxiety spikes, and Vision drops the hand from the chair to her shoulder. She relaxes a bit, one hand coming up to hold his, but she’s still on alert. Steve feels his muscles tightening with tension as he forces himself not to react.
his guts.  And then,” Rhodes has a pinched look on his face. “And then I went to this party, right, it was right after midterms and I decided I deserved to have some fun. And I find him—he was just a kid, you know? He was
“Like you with Ultron and Wanda with the other—stuff,” by the way he says it, it’s clear the boy isn’t quite sure what that other stuff entails. Tony decides it’s best if he doesn’t really know, considering his current dislike for their resident witch.
, because watching them together? Watching Tony mock arguing about something on Harley’s report card or watching the casual way in which he slings his arm around either kid? That was something Steve had never been blind to. Tony was a great fucking role model, and he is so grateful that he is allowed to see it.
Soft voices were coming from the kitchen and he braced himself before he entered it. He expected Clint or Natasha or even Vision and Wanda, but what he found was Rhodes leaning against the breakfast counter while Tony rooted around the cupboards for food. He glanced briefly at the frown on the colonel’s face before he moved towards the sink to deposit his cup before moving towards Tony. His eyes briefly met Rhodey’s and though it was still so hard to read the other man he felt as though there was a hint of approval there.
There’s a crack, and pain in his left hand where he had been holding on to the railing, as it snaps in his hands. Steve stands with his head bowed in some quiet little town in Austria as the video plays in his phone. He should have thrown it away, Sam and Natasha had said, it was StarkTech. Tony could have tracked him if he wanted to, if he had wanted to turn them in, it would have been so easy. Steve had snarled a heartfelt
“You stupid bastard,” there’s rage in Bucky’s voice like nothing he’s ever heard before. It makes his eyes snap up to look at his best friend, and the glare in his eyes makes him rear back in shock. Bucky has never directed that much anger at him before.
, Steve?” the mechanic said, derisiveness in his tone. “FRIDAY, roll the file on Scarlett for me.” his eyes didn’t waver from Steve as he handed him the tablet he had previously been looking over. Steve took it with a barely perceptible shake of his fingers, and then gasped. Crudely written messages, pictures of paper notes put together with magazine letters, ugly graffiti and dummies that looked like… “
Peter takes a step back and pulls a chair close to Tony. He doesn’t say anything, and he gives Tony the space to try to control himself. God, he’s so goddamn tired of fucking everything up. He should be the one to be strong. He should be the one to ask Peter how he’s doing; with spider-man, his biology club, his SAT preps, that asshole kid Flash, hell, even about Gwendolyn. He should be the one to man up and make sure that the kid is okay.
Tony doesn’t know what to say for a good thirty minutes after him and Steve separate. He wants to smirk at his father’s grave and point out that he has finally been rendered speechless. It had annoyed Howard,
Tony chuckles at the name the children had given T’Challa. Though they haven’t met yet, officially, they had been interested in him after watching some news segment. Still, though, that particular cat shouldn’t be out of the bag quite yet. “Yes, well, we all helped. Now, we have to go so the adults can talk for a bit.”
“Boss, you’ve been here for over nine hours without proper nutrition,” his youngest says. Tony rolls his eyes, but can’t help the smile that takes over his face. Though she is no JARVIS, she still manages to put just the right amount of fond exasperation to her voice. “Papa Bear,” Tony snorts at the name, “insists that you make your way to the kitchen so that he can, and I quote, put some meat on your old brittle bones.”
that it happens, hates that he’s that vulnerable in front of some of them, and he can’t really blame him. Not when he’s the one that put him in that situation in the first place.
to take that responsibility. Just like you decided to leave your family to fight another war.” That shuts him up pretty quick, and a haunted look crosses his face. Tony knows that Laura is seething with rage still, and wonders what the ultimatum was.
“You don’t even know me,” she said, her voice torn between uncertainty and defiance. It was a common conflict of emotion for her, Steve had noticed.
To all of you wonderful, lovely people who left encouraging comments and love when I decided to discontinue this fic, I want you to know that you all made me feel so, so much better. It legit brought tears to my eyes to have you guys tell me that you understood. I'm so grateful that you have given me the time and the open-mindedness to read through this and wait patiently for updates. I am so so grateful for each and every one of you.
“Dad?” Peter says, so quietly and tremulous Tony’s chest tightens. It’s the first time he’s ever called him dad.
“So we’re back to this, then?” Wanda’s voice makes Tony stiffen. She’s glaring at him, and the sparks in her fingers are not comforting. The sight of them brings forth memories of empty HYDRA bases, and
After a few minutes of walking in silence, and Sam chuckling at the trail of mini-me clothes on the way, the pilot chooses to breach the silence. “It was you, wasn’t it?”
, Tony had been engaged and now he was not. Tony had moved on, or tried to, and now his eyes are hidden behind sunglasses the way they always were when Howard or Obie had come to visit and his knuckles were white with the force of his grasp. Steve is not idiot, he knows people change and it’s been
“You’ll what? Give them a ‘stern talking to’? ‘Bench them’ or give them a little time out or something?  So they can’t keep stowing the resentment? Yeah, no thanks,” Tony sighs and gets to his feet. He should have known once he was alone with Rogers that his anger would get the best of him. He’s trying to rush this, he knows, trying to make like a band-aid and rip it off to deal with the sting. He should have known better, though, that he’s got far too much practice with stowing his feelings and blowing up when it’s far too late.
“You said four,” Wanda said after a moment of silence. She was still hugging herself, but there was determination in her ace. Steve felt a quick flare of pride in his chest. “Who else did they call?”
“I’m sure we all have questions,” T’Challa continues with a smile thrown at their new member. Rhodey has moved to sit next to Viz, and he gives Peter a friendly squeeze as his eyes meet Tony’s. They’ve gotten good at the whole silent communication by now. By quiet agreement, they’ve both decided that any shit thrown at Peter will be handled by both of them. “Thank you for joining us, Spiderman.”
Steve’s thought this before, many times, but he now knows for certain that he’s barely just begun to learn the sheer goodness of Tony Stark’s heart.
The others made sympathetic noises and moved around the room to prepare their breakfast. Nobody disturbed Clint, they all figured they could get protein bar or a sandwich in him before they let, and ate in companionable silence though Steve noticed that Wanda sat herself as far away from Tony as she could get without leaving the room. He grit his teeth to keep himself from saying anything and rather focused on Natasha as she outlined their agenda for the day. Halfway through, Sam and Scott walked in bleary eyed and immediately shoved each other to get to the coffee machine. Tony looked at them with amusement and reminded them that if he found coffee grains in the disposal again they would be having words. Scott, who had been walking in that direction, smiled sheepishly and immediately swerved away from it.
“But Stark still won’t come out, and they still won’t make an effort to meet him half way,” Phil says, annoyed.
That last one was Peter, and Steve gives him an unimpressed look. He doesn’t look at all chastised, and is working his way up to incredibly pissed, if the flush climbing up his cheeks is any indication. Steve doesn’t care about their hurt feelings at the moment, however, because now they’re just wasting time. Someone has to go after Tony, and he’d be damned if he sends two kids alone into the city. More than that, though, he feels as though he owes it to the genius. Tony has spent entirely too much time running after
3) I will probably never like Wanda because of what she did to my baby, but I understand her weariness of being back at the compound.
It seems to hurt the captain more than any words Tony could say. “No, you’re not—God, that I even made you—“one of his hands is brought up to the other man’s chest. He feels solid. Real. “Tony, I never told you that I’d be there with you until the end of the line because that’s not how you and I work, and I’m so sorry it took me this long to realize it. There’s no ‘until the end of the line with you’ because there is
, Steve feels sick looking at the words. More than that, he thinks of how wrong it is to be standing here. He feels an overwhelming sense of guilt, though Maria hadn’t died by his hand, he still feels responsible.
“News from the UN,” Natasha says, and her voice is unyielding. Steve knows that this is a point where Natasha had had no contention. She had struggled when they were sent to gather the Avengers, she had struggled when fighting them, she had struggled when she’d let him go, she had been torn afterwards and he knows it, but
that for the last decade, but now it’s even more pressing. If Thanos gets his hands on the time stone, there’s one less obstacle for him to get through. He’s one step closer to eradicating half the universe, and that is a gamble that Tony simply will not take. So he grits his teeth and gives himself a second, just one second, to let his boy know his truth. He’s not naïve enough to think he’s coming back from this particular excursion. “Tá mé i ngrá leat
“She’s just a kid! You said it yourself, Cap. She and her brother were just kids. Von Strucker was manipulating them! You can’t fault them for that!”
“Don’t,”Rhodey had all but snarled. Steve had a feeling they’d had this conversation before. “Don’t you fucking dare say it.
No, this sounds more like the lady in Sam’s old phone. Suri or whatever its name was. That same old pre-recorded, repetitive voice that merely regurgitated information at you. It was nothing like the beauty and amazement that the AI’s they’d known brought with them. Steve drops his duffle bag at his side, and turns his head to meet Nat’s gaze. The others have begun to trace the space; Clint’s gaze goes to the television set and his jaw locks at the lack of consoles. Sam disappears down a side corridor, and a moment later reappears with a haunted look on his face. Wanda runs her fingertips over the top of a couch that lacks any sort of colorful woven throw. Scott and Bucky, the only ones without a connection to the place, drop onto a couch. Scott promptly begins snoring. Bucky merely sits at the end of the couch cushion as he surveys the place.
Before that, however, there had been James. James Buchanan Barnes with the long hair and the cool prosthetic and the dark, dark brown eyes that saw all your secrets but gave away none. There was James, who had never been attractive before then even though Tony had known him most of his life. Bucky, as his friends called him and
“Steve?” Tony asks quietly, and Steve hums to let him know he’s listening. “I don’t—I think I’m not okay.” Tony’s breath shutters in his chest, and Steve tightens his arms around him. He bites his tongue to keep from apologizing, knows that it won’t do any good to either of them, and brings him closer.
He does the only thing he can think off that that is grab one of Tony’s hands, he makes a mental note to tend to the scratches on the other man’s arms once he’s calmed down enough, and place it on his chest. He crowds against Tony and hunches himself to make a safe space in the vastness of the cemetery. He mumbles comfortingly and takes in exaggerated breaths to allow Tony to focus on them and begin to calm down. It takes a while, far longer than Steve is truly comfortable with, before Tony’s trembling winds down enough for the brunette to step away. He plays with the cuffs of his long sleeve and refuses to meet Steve’s eyes.
“Mmm,” Tony says, a little evasively, as he pours cereal in three bowls and turns to look at the coffee brewer. Steve shakes his head, deciding not to make an argument out of it but making a mental note to get him to at least take a break later on, and goes to sit down next to Rhodes.
“Zemo had the video of the night the Starks died,” Steve’s eyes meet his. “The day Bucky killed them. I guess—I think—he was trying to use those words to snap Buck’s control. He wanted to prove that there was no more James Buchanan Barnes. That it was just the Winter Soldier. I—it was the first time Tony knew about it.”
, he vows to himself. He has done far too much breaking, and though he’s shit at fixing this, he doesn’t have a choice but to try about this.
“I have a bad feeling about this, Cap,” Natasha has that look in her face that says she won’t be letting this go anytime soon. Steve sighs, sitting at the table with her because he knows she wont let it go and will probably just follow him into his room. He’s been keeping his private spaces just that for the past two years, which is hard sometimes when there’s four people on the run trying to hide at the bottom of the barrel so that no one can find them.
“Okay, so we know where we’re going. How about we break and agree to meet at,” he looked down at his watch and noticed it was near four thirty in the afternoon. “Six for supper. We can raid the kitchen—“
“Everyone,” and there’s sympathy in her voice. Tony realizes that in however long they’d floated around together, maybe they had become friends. Like calls to like, and they had both been broken by Thanos beyond repair.
hormonal, he was messy, he was loud, he partied a lot—I thought it was unfair, you know? This rich white kid can fuck around all he wants and he’d still pass his fucking classes and I thought it would be because of his money, you know? I’d find his papers and his tests strewn around and they were all perfect scores. I thought he was paying the professors or something, we all knew who Howard Stark was of course we did, and so I
So it’s no surprise that he’s been sent away while Tony visits with him, but it still hurts. Irrationally, he knows. He has no claim to anything of Tony’s, has no right to be told what is going on in the other man’s head, no matter how much he might want to know. The least he can do right now is respect Tony’s choice. He’s done a shit job of that before, after all.
He counts the people he has to prove his worth to, and though it seems like an impossible task when not even Tony himself seems to be able to forgive him, he’s glad. He is so fucking glad that Tony has found this mismatched group of individuals who deeply care about him. He is so glad that despite the carelessness of his letter, how callously he’d called the Avengers Tony’s when they had followed
,” the boy bites out angrily. Steve bites his tongue so hard he tastes blood to keep the apology in. he can’t interrupt. He can’t take that from Tony, too.
Tony’s message is received by what’s left of the avengers on a Thursday. Steve has to stop Rhodey from shooting out of the room half-cocked before the recording is even up. It earns him a punch to the jaw, with one of them watch gauntlets Steve didn’t even know Rhodey had, but it’s well worth it. The rest of Tony’s message is… worrying. Steve’s a planner, a soldier, and he’s seen this before. The way Tony looks right now reminds him of Bucky when they rescued him and the rest of the 107
Tasha gave him a long, inscrutable look before saying “follow me,” and led the way into the compound.
“She wouldn’t hurt me,” Harley says smugly. They’d met once and Tony was one hundred percent sure the kid was right. “She said so. She’d just take it out on me.”
“Cut, stop, take it off,” the real Tony says with a trembling voice. With slow steps, he approaches mirage Steve and scrutinizes him. “This isn’t—it can’t—he lies better than that,” Tony finally says and the real Steve closes his eyes and wills the tears away.
“The whole team is here, T’Challa,” Rogers said but there was a politely inquiring note to his tone. Tony refused to look at him still.
is the first thing that Rogers notices. So much of it. Rooms labeled as the armory and the laboratories and something intriguingly called the
“Very well,” Thor says with a tight nod. He leaves the room as well, and Rhodes silently slips out of the room behind them.
had dropped to the floor in his haste. So he does an about face worthy of praise, and rushes back into the room. Marina is standing right where she left him with, with all the papers neatly inside the folder and his cell phone and wallet arranged on his desk.
,” Steve said vehemently, taken aback by the turn the conversation had taken. Part of him, a big part if he’s been honest, wants to be insulted at the fact that Sam would think that’s his plan. That he would even suggest anything other than Tony’s wellbeing is on his mind, but he can’t even fake that much. To think that everyone else had noticed how callous and thoughtless he had always been with the man who needed his supposed levelheadedness so much… to think he’d treated Tony like anything but a friend… anything but the man he—“Christ,” he says out loud. “That’s not—I didn’t—this isn’t about
“Get up,” Tony croaked out and he could feel the stinging in his eyes. His chest felt like it was wide open, and he didn’t care. He didn’t care that he’d be left alone to pick up the pieces of himself that Steve was shattering because here,
He’s so caught up in trying to control his breathing that he doesn’t feel the comfortable weight around his shoulders as soon as he probably should have. Needless to say, however, that he almost gives out his location with a shriek when he realizes that he’s not as alone as he thought he was. There’s something soft and warm that he can feel even through the armor, and when he turns around all he can see is crimson. For a second, and sue him he’s in an alien spaceship shaped like a donut with a squid evil pilot and a wizard he’s allowed to feel out of it, he think he’s passed out. He had hyperventilated a little too hard and now he’s made himself go unconscious.
But this, his son and his family and everything that they had and had lost, is worthy it. it’s worth everything.
“Yeah,” Rhodey croaks quietly, sitting next to Steve with some difficulty. A distant part of the soldier’s mind hopes he isn’t even contemplating to take the baby away from him because he’s quite sure he’d rip it off. “Sarah Morgan Star—”
of not having to see the bags under his eyes and the pinched expression on Rhodey’s face. He’d looked after Harley long after the boy had disappeared around the corner. He’d tried to ask FRIDAY after her boss, but she’d stayed resolutely silent.
Bucky doesn’t speak to him for two whole weeks, after. When he had turned back to their apartment, crying and shaking and barely coherent, his best friend had assumed something had happened to Tony. Him and Sam had been cuddling on the sofa when Steve had stumbled in with a vacant look in his eyes. After sitting him down and warming him up, Bucky had started with the questions. Eventually, Steve had managed to tell them what had happened.
stop, and I ended up doing more damage than I ever wanted to. I broke so much, but,” Tony sighs and shakes his head. “What I’m saying is, it’s really hard, but maybe we all need some time.”
“Now hang on a second, jackass,” Lang said and grabbed for his arm. Tony raised an eyebrow and look down at the hand gripping his. For a second, there was a flare of panic at a stranger grabbing for him, but the sound of the children in the next room helped calm him down. “Sorry,” Lang said sheepishly, and let him go. “Force of habit, the being an ass part. I didn’t mean to say that I was doing this because Mrs. Barton forced me to. I was always going to, but I wanted to know just how much you’d done for my little girl. I know you went to find her as soon as you knew I had joined Cap. I wanted to know why.”
. It’s so… perfect. “What is this? Ginny, you’re a smart girl, what does it say on the sign outside?” there’s another groan from Steve, and a synchronized sigh from the mothers in the room.
Tiberius goes to trial, but he doesn’t go to prison for what he’s done. He walks out of the courtroom like a fucking movie star holding the hand of some blond super-model girl and waving exuberantly at the camera. He gets to call Tony all manner of dirty lies and ugly names, and gets away with it. He’s exonerated after a video is suspiciously given to the court at the last minute wherein Tony supposedly leaves the room after their nightly activities. Tony can’t contest it because, under the influence of alcohol and god knows what else, he’s lost a good chunk of time.
, I know for a fucking fact that if I hadn’t gotten there and I hadn’t pulled him out that hand would have—that wasn’t the last party Tony went to, of course not, but I made it a point to watch him after that. I tried to—I don’t know, the idea of being his babysitter at first annoyed the hell out of me, but after that party I just felt like I
“On your run,” Rhodey says and there’s a smile on his face. Some of the defensiveness goes out of his posture, and Steve is grateful though a part of him is still sad. It will take a while, it seems, for his friends to stop expecting him to take off. He can’t say he blames him, leaving Tony in Siberia may have been the worst, but it certain wasn’t the
“These guys buggin’ you, Dum?” he pats the little bot again. There’s a beat of silence for which Steve doesn’t look back, the atmosphere with the boys and even Rhodes a little too tenuous, and continues to pat the bot.
But it’s enough to make him a little more centered. Rhodey is a god amongst men sometimes. Or all the time, if one were to ask Tony. “Steve, I’m sorry,” he finally says softly once his brother is gone. He still can’t force himself to meet the other man’s eyes.
“We’ll be right up, Laura,” Tony says with a smile as he ruffles Harley’s hair. Much to his annoyance.
Steve winces and tries to block the images out his head. One night, while he clutched the burner phone on one hand, and leaned against the table with the other he had gone hunting for any sort of information that he could on his former teammate. He’d been slapped right across the face with the headlines of Tony’s proposal. Worse, still, was the photos of the aftermath. The look on Pepper’s face as she shook her head, and the devastation that even with the tinted glasses Tony wasn’t able to hide. The plastic smiles on both their faces as they apologized for wasting the press’s time and walked out. That had been a few days before Steve’s hunt for information. From then on, there were merely canned words from Pepper as they caught her going to her house, or the sound of repulsors as Tony vehemently refused to answer any questions.
“Though I wouldn’t have said it quite like that,” Rogers said with a meaningful look towards a giggling Cooper and an exasperated Laura. And then, in a move completely unprecedented to the mechanic, he turned towards him and asked, “Tony? Will you be able to join us?”
They go on dates. They spend time together on either of their apartments. Tony sees Sam and Bucky again and cries softly into Bucky’s shoulder. Steve meets Pepper and Rhodey and Happy, all of him are serious and cold with him for the first few months, as well as Stephen and Bruce, who are a little warmer, and Tony’s apprentices Peter and Harley who grin at him and rib Tony affectionately. They talks about all the ways in which they have changed and those that are still the same.
Ross, as always, is sitting in a place of prominence. Where he can direct and control the way that the meetings, and by extension the faith of Tony’s friends, go. Tony’s hand goes to his pocket, where it curls around his phone, and he gives a predatory grin to the General. Underhanded and dirty has never been his style, he had always preferred to go for the direct approach, but he’s learned in the past few months since Ross came to him with the Accords. He can swim as well as any of the sharks now, and if there is anything that his father and godfather hand taught him, it was to be the best at everything you learned.
“Yes, but how did she get there, Tony? Wouldn’t she need clearance? What about your security detail? You said it yourself, Happy is a stickler for badges, remember?” Tony’s mouth ticks up at the corner at the mention of that tidbit. It would be endearing if Steve weren’t so focused at the moment. He
“You knew,” Rogers’s voice sounds pained. Tony looks at him from under his lashes and sees the other man white-knuckling the arm rests of his chair.
“Mrs. Keener,” he says solemnly. She gives him the patented unimpressed mother look that both her and Laura, and ironically Pepper, have mastered. He tries to give her his charming smile, but he’d be lying if he said he’s not shaking in his metaphorical boots. She approaches him, and he has to make a conscious effort not to take a step back. Rather than the ear pulling he’d been expecting, though, she envelops him into an official Keener hug. Tony sighs in relief against her hair and basks in her citrusy scent.
“It didn’t seem fair for us to be the only ones that got that option,” Tony tells him sincerely. There’s respect in the other man’s eyes when they meet his own. “We’ve fucked up too much to think that we have the moral high ground. I can’t, personally, believe that my choices are the best ones. I need a policing force, I need someone to be there to fight me when I need it, I need someone to keep me from making the same mistakes that I have in the past, and I think this could work. It’s what I wanted from the original Sokovia Accords,” his eyes meet T’Challa’s and there is something like pride in the other man’s gaze. Now that he’s started, Tony doesn’t think that he will be able to stop. All the anger, hurt, and accusation he’s been taking and hoarding for the past years seem to be making a cathartic exit. He feels like, more than wanting to tell the others this, he
Trying to avoid a confrontation, Tony slowly handed the baby to his father. He ignored the little whimpering noise he made, though it killed him to do it. Baby Bart was still too young to understand what they were saying, but clearly he could sense the emotions in the room.
Then he rushes out of the office, cell phone in hand to ask a very important question on his way to the garage:
“You’d have to forgive us, your majesty, but we didn’t exactly part as friends,” Sam tells the king. He’s still got an arm around the archer, but he doesn’t seem to be making much effort to restrain him. Tony guesses it was more so that he wouldn’t arrest Barton for assault or whatever.
Tony’s whole expression crumbles at how upset the boy is. Immediately, like a flash of lightning in a storm, Steve sees that familiar look pass through Tony’s eyes. He recognizes it from before. Before the war, and even before this break with Harley; it’s the same look the dark haired genius always had after an argument. After another screaming match where Steve or one of the others berates him for his recklessness, for his thoughtlessness, for what they’d always labeled as his selfishness because they’d never, not once, bothered to ask why the man did the things he did. Why he couldn’t stop the mad dashing inside his brain to explain himself. Steve had always interpreted that flash as anger; that last push at determination before the genius came up with a comment that cut everyone else down to the quick. Now, though, as Tony fumbles the few steps to where Harley is standing, the soldier recognizes it for what it truly is.
“You—“he begins but Harley is quick to grab the boy’s arm before he can get up or continue his sentence. Steve has seen him on the field, knows that he’s much stronger than Harley, but he lets himself be brought down onto the chair and begins to gather his tools.
“The day she—“Tony’s voice breaks and withers, and Steve has to clench his hands at his sides. God damn him. “The day she left, she wanted me to mend things with Howard. She knew he’d never do it, he was never wrong, but God I could see it in her eyes. She wanted it us to be okay, it would have Christmas when they were back, and she’d always loved it. I knew what she wanted from me, but I pretended not to see it. I let them walk away knowing I’d let her down.”
“You’re the one that blew up our lab, mechanic,” Harley grumbles and wipes at his nose. Tony looks away so that the kid can compose himself. They’re much too alike for their own good, he thinks. “Peter’s worried, too,” and now he sounds like the sullen prepubescent that he is.
“I doubt she would have thought that about you,” Steve says softly. It’s a Hail Mary attempt, he knows, because he hasn’t done anything to make the genius believe that. He can’t unsay it, though, because he knows that it’s the truth.
, Tony is horrible at lying to himself. His attempts at distancing himself from the lot of them failed the minute they picked different camps. If Tony had been stronger he would have brought them in without a second thought. If Tony had been stronger, he would have never sold himself to Ross and the others to keep them safe. If Tony had been stronger, Barnes wouldn’t be in the Stark mansion using his
In the weeks they have been back, they have all tried to reestablish their routines. After a couple frosty days, Vision and Wanda are back making meals together. Scott and Clint spend their days training, watching trash television, or talking to their families. Scott has left a few times to visit with his daughter. Clint has had no luck convincing Laura to let him do the same. Natasha spends her days with them, polishing her knives, or out about the city. Steve knows she’d missed New York almost as much as he had. Him, Sam and Bucky quickly establish a routine running together or training in the early morning. Sam, after some mysterious donation and a few strings pulled, is back at the VA doing what he considers his duty. Bucky is usually attending his mandatory therapy sessions or out with Natasha or circling around the library trying to find something else to read. Rhodes still won’t spend much of his time with them, and often disappears
to talk to someone who isn’t Rhodey about it, and isn’t that the biggest surprise of it all? That Tony actually
After Rhodey has stood his ground for them and baited Ross into court-martialing him, after Bruce had quietly and awkwardly worked himself into the room. After they had begun their discussion, their desperate attempt at understand what had happened; after they have looked after Vision’s wound and one of them had suggested food. He won’t remember exactly what led him to turn his head. It was something quiet, though, in the sudden stillness of the room. His hearing had managed to catch the faint sound of footsteps.
There is forced conversation after that; clearly it is all for his benefit. Rhodey asks Peter about his and his biology club. Peter, in turn, asks about how the exoskeleton Tony build has been working out for him. The air tenses at that, and Tony can sense without looking that this is something Steve is actually interested in. From what he’s heard from Rhodey, Sam has been unable to face him up until now, and the vindictive part of Tony is sadistically happy at that. Though the sane part, the one that is thankfully been in control since that day in Siberia,
“Oh my God, you’ve got to be kidding me,” he said once he had managed to control himself. Steve had settled on the coffee table in front of him so that when, or if, Tony looked up he would be able to see him straight. Steve had noticed that Tony seldom stood face to face with them, especially if they were arguing, because it was so much easier for him to put up a front and divert whoever was screaming at him. “I can’t believe that after everything I’ve done for you
“I was trying to keep her safe,” Lang said, and then he shook his head angrily. “I know why I did what I did, Mr. Stark. And because of that I want to offer you my apologies. I went into that fight without all the information. Clint came to get me, said Cap needed help, and I didn’t ask any more questions. I let my distrust of what I know of law enforcement to cloud my judgement and made an uninformed decisions. If asked again, I don’t know if I would have done things differently, but I have no excuse for what I did to you and your friends. I just wanted to say thank you for taking care of my daughter when I wasn’t around, and I don’t know why you did what you did for the Accords for her or me, but I’m glad you kept her safe. I have no idea what I would do if Ross had gotten to her.”
Peter’s breath hitched, and Tony closed his eyes tight. “But those times it’s worse. And you spend all the time in the workshop.”
, he finds Rogers on his knees in front of him. A haunted look in his eyes, and his fingers steady as they hold Tony’s.
Wanda that he would never let her be collared again. He had pledged his word to her, and he wasn’t about to break it. And they all knew it. Everyone in the room was aware of the lengths he would go to for that.
The panic threatens to choke him so he forces himself to get moving because the longer he stands there, the harder it will be for him to do what’s right. He knows,
At thirteen, Tony had been forced away for the summer. Some kind of “socialization” experiment his step-mother had conjured up so he could ‘stop being such a recluse, Howard, he doesn’t have any friends.’ Ha! Joke’s on here because after Rhodey had come Pepper and then Bruce and though they
“No, there has been, but not where it should be. Rhodey is comfortable enough with Sam now, and Viz has been working his charm to get him to calm down around Wanda. I think Steve let him get a few punches in while they were training Peter, and they talked so they seem okay, but…”
Green-Wood has an entrance like a castle. It’s opulent and grandiose, and it makes Steve completely uncomfortable. He’d read about it back in his time, when some rich person died and the obituary was printed in the papers. He knows he would have worked ten life-times and never had been able to afford dying to be buried here. It’s completely the right place for Howard to be laid to rest, what he would have chosen, but Steve can’t think that this is just the
“Believe me, Agent Barton, if I had known the dangers I would have kept him home. Hell, I thought I was meeting my
did you show him?” he bangs a fist on the table again, and the mechanic is honestly afraid the whole thing will collapse.
mark was, but Peter pretended not to notice. They had grown quite accustomed to this game, the both of them.
It had been such a stupid conversation, so damn long ago, when he and Tony had been sitting on the communal kitchen at three in the morning with a carton of ice cream open between them. Tony had been coming out of one of his engineering binges and Steve had had a visit from his old friend insomnia. Tony had been subtly trying to dig for information about what had kept him up. It was something he did whenever he caught the soldier up, which was unerringly often, and had become quite good at it. Steve had found himself talking about all the things that seemed so strange,
“What did you show him?” Rogers’s voice is horrified. He’s looking steadily back at Tony with something like sorrow.
“Steve,” Tony mouths at him, eyes wide and disbelieving. Steve doesn’t know what his own face is doing, can’t feel anything but the rush of blood in his ears and the painful pounding in his chest, but he knows it’s
Steve’s mind does the math. There were supposed to be three official Avengers in New York at the time of the attack. Now, Vision is in Amsterdam. Rhodey, and Steve’s stomach twists with the thought, might not be in any sort of condition to be Avenging. Which means—
“Unc’a ‘Ohhhnyyy,” the baby says in delight and nuzzles his nose onto Tony’s goatee. He giggles at the feel of the fuzzy hair, and Tony’s heart melts. God, this kid. He’s burrowed himself so deep into the mechanic’s heart it’s not even funny.
“And he—you were dying, and he—you—he tried to—you said that it was his fault. You told him that he could have stopped it. If only—if—you told him he could have done more.” The sound of hard plastic snapping ricochets around the room like a gun shot. When everyone turns to look, nobody is really surprised to find the captain with the armrest of his char in his white-knuckled fist.
Minutes later they hear voices approaching the kitchen. Steve watches Tony straightening in his seat and Rhodey’s posture change as they get closer. The bubble they had been wrapped up in bursting around them and taking the sense of
Sam throws a look filled with pity his way before he looks back at the television. “You might want to sit down, Steve.”
,” he retorts and his eyes cut to the man sitting beside her. Clearly, he holds someone just as responsible for landing her in that cell. Tony doesn’t think he will ever grow tired of watching what little is left of JARVIS break through his impassiveness.
“Fuck,” Bucky’s whispered curse snaps him back into reality. Like one of those cartoons where the character’s soul or whatever has left their body and then get slammed back into the physical plane. That’s how he feels because he’s heard this tone of voice before from his best friend. On the night when Steve pissed away the best person he’d ever had.
“I am so sorry, Tony,” Steve says. Earnestly, passionately, clearly sincere. Tony wants to push him away and berate him and scream, but he can’t. he leans forward and for a while second the mechanic thinks he’s about to kiss him, and he’s torn in whether he wants to or not, but the blond merely rests their foreheads together. His eyes are wide open, though, drinking the sight of the other man. Tony could drown in that gaze.
“You… don’t want me to give a statement?” Tony asks uncertainly. He glances over to both his side, but Rhodey is looking just as confused as he feels and Natasha’s face is completely blank as she stares at the man on the other side.
and when I touched you… when I touched you, you didn’t just poof out like every other time scared me.  I touched you, and I couldn’t tell if it was real or not. You were there, and you looked so real, but—but I felt like if I kept looking at and it turned out that you weren’t then—I just” Tony heaves a sob, curling in on himself, and Steve throws a glance at Coulson to make sure it’s okay before he gathers Tony into his arms. “I didn’t think I could do it. Not again. If I had you, and I could touch you, and you went away again.”
Rhodes looks at him with a blank expression for a long time. Steve, feeling guilt curl in his stomach, does all he can to look back. He knows,
, they had created; why he decided to keep something so important from him. Maybe if he’d used the phone, maybe if he had gone away from the compound, maybe if Rogers had told him
Tasha snorts derisively. He can see where Tony learned that response then. “Something has to give, Phil. That’s what we’re doing, too, trying to keep the peace. It’s not helping, all it did was get Stark punched in the face and Rhodey swearing at everyone.”
, until he found it in himself to ask JARVIS to call Tony up wherever he was and had gotten to hear the richness of Tony’s voice and the smile he couldn’t see.
Clint Barton is not usually the worrying type. Mostly because, before this whole Avengers’ mess, what he had to worry about were pretty mundane things. Like what time he was supposed to be back from a mission, how long Laura had gone without sleep because one or all of the kids were up, what time the smallest of their children had had their latest feeding… stuff like that. For the most part, he could count on both his hands the number of people whom he needed to watch out for. For the most part, he could see those people on a very regular basis.
Okay, okay. He’s got this. He forces himself to take a deep breath. One, two, three, four, in. hold. One, two, three, four, out. Hold. He can hear Steve’s voice in his head telling him to get his breathing under control; can feel the phantom weight and warmth of his hand running up and down his back. Tony hates that the process is so fucking familiar to him now; he’s been dreaming up fake Steve’s for a while now, worse still after Morgan came around as he was faced with the monumental task of parenting two children alone, so the process is familiar. He hates himself for needing that comfort so much, but he has never been able to grow out of it. Not even in the last two years without a husband.
Natasha and Rhodey’s sharp intake of breath are loud in the sudden stillness of the room. Tony hangs his head in shame. His constant fighting and losing with that particular nightmare is always fresh in his mind. He never seems to get over it, and it leaves him feeling weak.
name in clean energy right now, but closes it quickly. He feels the shakiness coming off the kid in waves, and knows that sarcasm isn’t the way to play it though that’s usually how the two of them communicate. He decides to take a page out of the Jarvises’ book and go with the truth. He takes a deep breath to steel himself and, eyes still set on the bed of flowers and the expanse of lawn beyond it, begins his story. “The best memories I have of my mother are in a greenhouse. In fact, my very first memory is of her singing to me in Italian when I was very little, and she was rocking me, and we were in the greenhouse that my father built for her in the Stark Mansion. When things got… bad while I grew up, I’d always run to the greenhouse to just… be. When my father sent me away to boarding school, I always tried my best to find one so that I could still have a little bit of home with me. I didn’t find them always, but I was very glad when I did.”
“Like you have to make up for it?” Tony asks, a sad smile on his face. God, this kid is too much like him. “Like you don’t get to make mistakes because someone already made all of them? You feel like you have to make up for what someone else did?” Peter nods, his breath hitching again, and Tony leans forward to grasp his son’s hands. This might be the hardest thing he has ever done, trauma of the last year and a half aside, being this vulnerable in front of his son might actually be the biggest challenge of his life. “I feel like that, too, you know? With you and zio Rhodey and Morguna and even with Viz. I feel—I feel so responsible for what happen. Most days, I lay awake till two am trying to think of everything I could have done differently. I’m—it’s what I do, right? The mechanic? I fix things? But there is nothing I could do to fix this mess and I just—so I try. Every single day, I try to—to be strong. For you. I didn’t realize what I was doing to you, amore, I am so sorry.”
Things are much easier after that. At some point, Baby Bart is passed around the table until he ends up sitting in Tony’s lap where the genius gets the pleasure of feeding him some cobbler. He somehow ends up with bits of squishy peach
“Well,” Steve says and claps his hand. Despite the awful feeling in his chest, they can’t stand around and brood. They should be getting themselves settled if they were to stay, or talk options. He forces himself to keep the grimace off his face as he thinks about the loops they’d have to jump through if they wanted to leave the Compound. “We should get ourselves settled. We can start by looking for our rooms.”
Huh, would you look at that? He might actually be maturing a bit. And it only took yet another near death experience and betrayal to do it. Still, progress.
” she spits out, “was the adequate person to tell you. To help you—I don’t know, process. I’m sorry, Tony.”
“We’ll have time to finish them later, Spiderling,” he says with an easy smirk. Rhodey frowns at him, but Tony can’t seem to care. Steve’s surprise shows in his face as he stares at the kid, and the boy blushes. There, they should have something to talk about now that Steve isn’t concerned about speaking of important matters in front of a civilian. “I bet you have plenty of questions for Cap over here, and I bet he’d love to tell you those stories. You can drop by later if you have time.”
, that there were people who didn’t allow themselves to be blinded to the genius’s goodness. There is also a small part of himself that feels vindicated, that feels as though he should tell Tony a big
“For this, I can be,” the doctor responds determinedly. He doesn’t return the smile, and Steve didn’t expect him to. Both him and Thor are different, now, and well… now they know the story. They’re well aware of what has happened in the last two years since they’d been gone.
, is what keeps chanting through his mind as his eyes roam over the headstone. Howard’s name and dates of birth, and death, are written in elegant gold script. They’re… well, big, is the only word that comes to mind. They stand out on the marble, and he knows it was intended to be that way. To call attention to the legend of Howard Stark, the man be damned, but what holds his attention is what’s written underneath.
. Something had snapped, and now everything was spilling out. He vaguely wondered if there would be anything left when they were done with each other. Steve’s pale face suggested that the answer will most likely be a resounding
There’s a bit of awkward silence in the room, and then Peter makes a thoughtful noise. “I mean, I suppose Asgardians might have a language of their own.”
if he’s confronted with authority. He will bite and tear if anyone attempts to dominate him. Steve wonders if Howard had demanded nothing but obedience from his son, if had abused his power over a child, to make Tony so weary and resentful of anyone who believes themselves above him.
“Mr. Dad?” Peter interrupts quietly. Tony’s mouth snaps shut. “You don’t have to explains. Sometimes—sometimes things just click.”
“You can’t keep doing this to yourself, man,” Rhodes’s voice had tried to be stern but he’d come out more like pleading. “This isn’t healthy.”
Waking up is, frankly, a disappointment. When he blinks again, nothing around him has changed. He squeezes his eyes shut, can feel the hot trail of tears running to his temples and he doesn’t care. He doesn’t care because it’s unfair. He was so close. He could feel
for fucking Christmas. Some bullshit about appeasing the public, but it was—it was bad. I wasn’t there, my leave was over, but I was checking the news obsessively. And he—every goddamn picture, he has the same glassy look and lose grin from that party. Every article is about how he’s getting sloshed, or high as a fucking kite, or
“Seriously!” Tony turns around, and it’s really hard to fight down the grin that pops up on his face. It’s just so
. I—I don’t remember much of the few months after that,” he feels shame curl in his stomach and forces himself not to flinch in expectation of a blow.
They’re quietly standing in the deserted hallway for a long time. Tony breathes in the smell of baby shampoo and pretends that his eyes aren’t tearing up. Part of his mind can’t compute what Sam is saying because what? Sam is Steve’s friend, perhaps his only one in this new century, and here he is taking Tony’s side? They’ve never even talked, not really. Tony had created Redwing and repaired the wings, sure, and sometimes when there was an Avengers event they would meet. Before Ultron, there were those parties that they all attended and Sam seemed to like him well enough, but… this. This is so much more than that.
“This?” Tony repeats, numbly, and Steve knows he’s not asking for clarification. Tony is a genius, he knows exactly what the other man is telling him, but he needs the time. His brain, his goddamn wonderful brain, going trillions of miles a minute to formulate a plan.
“I’m so sorry, Steve,” she’d said, eyes bright with tears. “I just—Believe me, I wish I could return the feeling, but—I just,” she’d rolled her eyes at herself then, sniffling. “There’s someone else. I’ve met someone, and I think he might be it, Steve. I think he might be my person.” She’d looked down with the type of smile Steve had never seen before at a bracelet wrapped around her hand.
, she had smiled when she said it. The sad smile Steve knew graced his face before he had gotten Bucky back. He had tried to fill that for her, he realized, after they had inadvertly caused so much loss in her life, but he had never treated her as an equal. The entire time they were “in the same side” he had treated her as his child, not his sibling, and in so doing perhaps had taken more responsibility than he should have.
The others seem to think that he likes his morning runs because of who he is. Steven Grant Rogers, born promptly at six am on the Fourth of July. They think that it’s just more proof that he was
Steve braces himself to be yelled at and cursed. He closes his eyes against the flurry of words that may come out of Tony’s mouth. He doesn’t know what to expect, really. It could be the hot, burning curses and yells or even worse, Tony’s cold, precise jabs. He thinks he’d rather have the former; they tend to hurt less. What he doesn’t expect is for the genius to take a long, hard look at him and turn back to his parents.
His eyes seemed to ask, and Tony was pleased with himself for having picked up enough about the other man’s social cues to know this much. He handed the baby over to the pilot, and he hesitantly took him.
“Pete,” the mechanic says tiredly. God, the throbbing in the back of his head is killing him, but he feels like he needs to do this. He thinks that their conversation is long overdue. If tony’ heart has to be shattered, completely, its best they get it over with. Whatever explanations Rogers has will never be enough, but Tony is not the same type of asshole he is. Tony can listen, if only because nobody gives him the same curtesy when he needs it. “Please go with the others.”
“He wasn’t, though,” Sam says forcefully. He lays a hand on Tony’s arm when the other man is about to continue their walk. “Tony, look,” he shakes his head as if exasperated with himself. “The idea of keeping tabs on people like that didn’t sit well with me, that’s true. But I also went with him because he’s my friend. The dude that gave me back a purpose when I felt like I was stuck after my spotter died. He… I mean, he’s Captain America, you know? And that blinded me, a bit. No,” he chuckles mirthlessly and Tony sees something he recognizes all too well in the other man’s eyes. Self-loathing. “It blinded me a lot. It blinded me to the guy who made me who I was. Riley and I did what we did because of
through, and that was all he could really ask for. As he heard them, the original members of the team and the ones they’d picked up along the way, he realized that
“No,” and hey, it’s not Tony that bites it out. Rhodey gets to his feet with an effort, and Tony offers his arm without even thinking about it. They’d gotten used to supporting each other in the past few months. “You said this was a team meeting,” the venom in the statement is meant for the Captain.
Tony thinks as his eyes meet Rhodey’s across the room. Natasha gives his hand a squeeze and T’Challa places a hand on the small of his back to lead him forward. He doesn’t know how this meeting will go, if it’ll be another repeat of the last to add more fuel to his nightmares or if they will actually make a difference, but he’s willing to try. T’Challa had said he was a man of convictions, and he thinks he wants to prove the man right. His eyes meet determined blue, and he takes a deep breath.
Surprisingly enough it’s not Rogers who starts the meeting. Once everyone is sitting, and it grinds on Tony’s nerves that they’ve decided to sit along their “respective” groups, T’Challa stands at the head of the table. On the right side, Cap sits with a solemn expression on his face as he stares at everyone in the room. Though he is trying to avoid him, sitting on the opposite side and most decisively
“I’m sorry,” he says instead, wretchedly. He blinks his eyes down to his feet, and hopes that Steve doesn’t see the tears there. He’s barely holding on as it is, right now, and he can’t help the avoidance. He’s never been very good at facing these emotional messes he puts himself into. Already, Steve is the exception. Tony has never before put this much effort into
B) i apologize for this not being the much anticipated showdown with bird boy but i didn't think i would do it justice in my current state of mind + this idea came to mind and it. would. not. go. away. So here we are. Sorry if it's shitty.
“Tony, come on!” Bucky’s scream breaks Steve from his stupor. He feels his head turn numbly to look at his best friend as he disconnects the call and then immediately begins dialing the number again. “come on, you stupid kid. Come on, you just have to answer. Come
“Yeah, I bet,” she said with a laugh. Then gently pushed Tony towards the dining room when she caught sight of her husband. Tony walked by him without a word, and tried to avoid his eyes.
I’m good with math,” in front of Rhodey and finally the plain blue with the shield in front of Steve.
“Uh, thank you?” Rhodey says and looks at Steve. The blond can’t help the smile that over takes his face as he shakes his head.
Steve had had enough conversations with Wanda to earn some insight into the younger man’s thoughts. He had asked her, early on, about the relationship between them, about the boy who had tried to protect her… the reason she had joined them to begin with. Pietro had loved her, Steve knew this, desperately and completely, but that had never blinded him.
He is pulled out of his reverie when Tony makes a disgusted noise. Harley turns around from playing with one of the tablets left over from their meeting and rolls his eyes at the mechanic. Steve doesn’t feel like he has the right to say anything, but he burns with curiosity. Thankfully, he doesn’t have to because Tony is so affronted that he needs to vent.
He’d banned anyone from coming to his penthouse since then, and avoided having to see what he was turning into when he was forced out of the solace of the tower. There was nobody to check on him, anyway, so avoidance had suddenly become a lot easier. He leans against the counter in his bathroom for a second longer, breathes a slow exhale and ghosts his fingers over the center of his chest before he tells himself to man up.
is what they wanted for her. You think that the news reels were bad, you think CNN questioning her intentions or Fox News asking for her extradition were bad, but none of you had seen any of this. None of you knew, because I was trying to protect you from them. And this isn’t all of it,” Steve looked up in shock. Tony gave him a sad smile, and looked away. “There is a file on every single one of you. You’ve seen some of it, Steve, I know you have. I know what it does to you when you see yourself next to the word fascist,” Steve reared back unconsciously and Tony gave him an apologetic look. “Tell me something, Steve, how many trips around the world do you think I do a year? Hell, per month?”
Ross, as always, is a piece of shit. Tony is so very glad that this might be the last meeting he will ever have to see the son of a bitch’s smarmy face. His pocket feels heavy where his phone, and all its secrets, rests. He fakes smiles and shakes the hands of every dirty politician he knows. He shares more genuine greetings with the few world leaders he actually is in good standing in, and humbles his expression with the ones he doesn’t. He sees King T’Challa across the room, and when their gazes meet Tony drops his own. They might have been working toward the same goal, aided by a redheaded shadow, but old habits die hard. And holding pain and anger in is a very old habit for him.
He looks back at the same time the man turns to give the room a last once-over, and feels his heart stutter in his chest.
, and that he doesn’t feel as though he should at the moment. Tony isn’t as much of an asshole to prevent him from getting to know the other man.
Then, two years after their meeting, after some of the staff had gone out to a local pub to celebrate one Friday night, he had finally managed to get the courage to kiss her. It had been a good kiss, surely, nothing like the few dispassionate kisses he once shared with Sharon. Peggy had been pliant and comforting and warm when he leaned in to plant one her, and for a moment Steve had been able to imagine doing this for the foreseeable future, if not the rest of his life. Then, the hand that he had thought was placed on his chest to bring him closer pushed him away and he met the eyes of a flushed-faced, wide eyed Peggy Carter.
He stands there for a long time, uncaring of the cold or the dark, as he looks down at his shoes. Long after the last of the cars have stopped passing by. Long after the light on the front porch turns off. Eventually he knows he has to go, Tony might look out and see him and that’s certainly the last thing he needs.
The beginning was easy, Coulson always made sure to put them at ease and remind them of their love for one another. That helps. It might be the only thing that does when Coulson turns the conversation to that night. Tony fidgets next to him, flexes his fingers, but then holds Steve’s hand tighter in his.
“You’re gonna regret saying that in a second,” Tony says with a grin. Sam’s laugh, Baby Bart’s giggles when they go in and see the mess of toys in the room, and the kids’ easy cheer for him makes his chest fill with a peculiar sort of warmth. For once, though, he decides not to look at it too closely and instead enjoy it. just for a bit.
She took one look at me and Jarvis’s long suffering look and then held her arms out. Now, usually, I’d be all up for her to carry me… I… well,” his voice falters as his father’s voice echoes in his head. He shakes his head hard to dispel the sound. “Well, let’s just say Daddy dearest wasn’t too kin on people
“I’ve been failing you for so long, Tony. I was your captain, I was your teammate, and I didn’t trust you. I didn’t see that you needed us just as much as we needed you. You gave us… Tony, you gave
“Answer it,” Nat’s hard voice slams him back into the very real situation they have in their hands at the moment.
“Like you helped when you talked to him?” Cooper’s voice is venomous from his place at the table. His hands are fisted over the table, one of them clutching his fork, and he glares daggers at his father. Steve can feel the archer tense. “You sent him near a panic attack. Is that helping? Is that what you want to do now?”
“Pete, the time I spend with you is the highlight of every day for me, okay? I know—I know we don’t talk much about feelings and what not, but I am all right. As—as all right as I’m ever going to be, and that’s because of you. For a while, I thought I would never—I didn’t think I would get this far, but you’ve helped. God, you have helped so much. I just—there is a part of me that is always going to be missing, kid. I don’t expect you to get it, but—but dating isn’t—I
“Seems like you’re gonna need help,” a voice says from behind him. Tony turns around to see a smiling Sam standing with his hands shoved into his pockets. The others have vacated the room, and Tony is thankful he gets to avoid any more of Barton’s glares, but he can hear them talking through the kitchen. Laura sounds like she’s in quite the tirade.
“I get it,” Tony said quietly. He tried to push the other man away, but Steve stayed resolute. He shook his head fiercely. “I confirmed everything you ever thought about me to be true. I
He wasn’t exactly sure what it was, why Tony had created it in the first place, but he’d become well versed on what it did and, more specifically, what it did to the engineer. On their third week back, he’d stumbled upon a conversation between Rhodes and Tony on his way outside to run the perimeter. He’d wanted to walk away, had known he had no right to eavesdrop, but hadn’t been able to help himself. He hadn’t seen Tony in days, had been dying to know anything about the other man, and so he had stayed.
“Don’t come at me with that bullshit, Rhodes! Every time we get called out it’s because he’s found a way to fuck up! We could have solved this shit if he had bothered to talk to us, but no! Rich kid knows best, right? He’s so fucking smart, he’s such a fucking genius, so he can’t fucking admit when his head is so far up his ass that he can’t see what’s fucking right!”
, Tony thinks desperately. His eyes roam all over the other man’s face, God they’re so fucking close, and wishes for any type of sign that he’s lying. For any way to know that this is another lie. That this is another trick to play him, poor sucker that he is, but he can’t find any. All he can see is those fucking eyes, the first thing he noticed about the soldier, so wide open and earnest.
. None of you thought much of J when he was around, he was just a computer program to you and I got that, but he was so much more for me. I created him, I taught him, and he learned from me every single day; I
Laura Barton kicks ass, and I'm sad to say that while i wrote this I kept thinking "He's so nice in my head'; it's definitely OOC" (brownie points if you leave me a comment and tell me who you think I mean.)
“Clint,” another voice pipes up. Tony sees the other man stiffen and turn. Sam is the one on his feet now, and though he tends to be relaxed and open and friendly most of the time, Tony can see the military power and restraint coiled inside him at that moment. “He better return exactly as he is, if not better, or we will have problems. You got that?”
Steve buries his face into Tony’s soft hair, holds him tight with his ear pressed against his chest, and wills him to believe him. That he is there. That he loves him more than anything. That he will never leave him again. That he shouldn’t have the first time.
“What were her favorites?” Cooper asks, and his voice is subdued. His reverent tone matching the way Tony has talked about his mother since the day she passed. Was murdered. He takes another shuddering breath.
C) If anyone has found me on Tumblr lately as of today i am off it (deleted the app on my phone and everything) because honestly my writing and Tony are some of the only things that bring me joy lately and having that much hate and vitriol is honestly just making shit worse.
“What they ended up with was bad enough,” Wanda says and Tony’s jaw twitches with how hard it is for him to have her so near. He knows,
it, you know, the way these assholes were using him. The way they’d give him a little bit of attention, and there was this kid tripping over himself to make them happy. So I tried to be better, you know, for him. A better friend. It was so fucking hard to get him to believe that I
“Why,” it’s not even a question. It’s more of a command. Military discipline is well engrained in Steve, and he snaps at attention at a commanding officer. Rhodes looks pleased.
“He has a chemistry test that he can’t afford to not study for, so no you are not. Aunt May would dismember us both.”
Stark merely looks at him for a long beat before he sighs in defeat and puts his glasses back on his face. He shoves his hands in his pockets and just looks at the archer as he says, slowly and clearly, “I am the last person to try to give you advice. But as someone who’s lost almost every person who’s been dear to me, I’m trying to help you. That boy loves you, but you
sometimes and I take it out on the completely wrong people. And I know how unfair it is, but I just don’t know how to
Tony can do nothing but stare at the other man, the vindictive retorts swirling in his brain, but unable to say them out loud. More than the anger and the hurt, the mechanic thinks the most prominent thing is the disappointment. The disappointment of seeing the other man, the guy who was supposed to have his back, be so entrenched in his anger and recrimination that every opportunity to hurt him is welcomed with glee. Tony wants nothing more than to get up from his seat, declare the meeting useless, and no longer have to deal with their shit.
“They sound like remarkable people,” the blond says after a moment of silence. “I’m glad you had them.”
“Before everyone goes,” Rogers said to the group as the children were nodding off in their chairs and Laura and Lang had gotten up to take them to bed. They had finished their food hours ago, but had been too comfortable to break the fragile peace they had created. It had been dark outside for a while, and Baby Bart had fallen asleep in his father’s arms minutes before. The room turned to give the man their attention. “I’d like to ask all of the Avengers,” his breath hitched at the word. There was a note of incredulousness in his voice at being able to say it again. “Though Laura you are more than welcome to join, and I would appreciate it if you could be there, your majesty. I want to ask you all to meet me in the conference room tomorrow at eleven.”
Steve has the full intention of circumventing the question, and hiding for a little longer. Tony, however, has always known him too well. Even in that stuffy conference room, Tony had seen right through Steve’s shoddy attempts at bullshit and hit him with the truth. “No,” he says into the curls pressed against his lips. Tony’s arms tighten around his waist in response, but he doesn’t say anything. “I’m sorry I made you think I’d go back on my word this morning.”
,” is said over Tony’s attempt to interrupt. He can’t hear this. “is that you are being treated unfairly. They don’t know everything and yet they’re judging you. They’re supposed to be your family.”
“Tony,” she says, and the tone of her voice lets him know that it’s best if he doesn’t argue with her. “You’ve watched him before, you’ll be absolutely fine. Could you take the others with you, please?”
“So are we just going to stare into each other’s eyes for the rest of the day or are you actually going to talk, Rogers? You know, contrary to what you and your merry men think I
feel like that, but having someone so clearly in your corner is what makes you or breaks you sometimes.”
Tony falls apart in increments after his parents’ death. Steve, and Bucky and Sam and the rest of the world, get a prime view seat to his decline. It starts slowly, with things that aren’t surprising to see in regards to Tony. He shows up drunk, swaying on his feet, at his parents’ televised memorial. He’s wearing dark tinted glasses, and Steve knows that this is a defense tactic. Tony had confided in him once.
In the morning, Tony wakes up to the incessant beeping FRIDAY had chosen to alert him to a new video called. He scrunches his eyes tightly shut in an attempt to shut the outside world enough to stave off the headache. The sounds of the blender comes right on cue from DUM-E’s station, and Tony groans but can’t help chuckling tiredly immediately afterwards. Damn faulty bot with adorable quirks.
Steve’s hand immediately went to the baby’s forehead to feel for his temperature, but he didn’t feel overly warm, thank God. He shared a concerned glance with Tony who held the baby closer. Baby Barton was now sleeping on his chest with a thumb in his mouth. He guessed Laura and the girls were still trying to catch up on sleep if Clint had brought the baby out with them.
Steve spends his days drawing, or when that becomes too much with all the whiskey eyes and well-trimmed goatees he seems to have gotten stuck in, trying to push the boundaries of his access as much as he can. Especially late at night, when the sound of metal on metal and the words
Four weeks after Stone’s bailout and his move, the gossip is turned to Tony once again. It had just started to wind down, but then the vultures were on him again. They have grainy footage of him doing jelly shots off a model at some night club, and then the splash of what apparently passes as news nowadays.
Tony doesn’t forgive him right away. When he catches up with him, hand soft and hesitant on his elbow, Tony’s eyes are hidden away behind his sunglasses. He pretends as though they’re old acquaintances, as though he hadn’t done that interview where everyone who knew of them would know who he meant when he said he’d only loved once, and it burns at Steve to be on the receiving end of that cold detachment. He wants to run, then and there, but he doesn’t. he doesn’t want to ever give Tony the idea that he doesn’t want him as much as he did when they were both two stupid kids, and he’d gotten scared.
“He’ll be fine, I’ll keep him company,” Tony responds easily. He just wants to get the hell away from the emotional rollercoaster he seems to be in. the workshop is safe; his work protects him. He’ll be fine once he can lose himself in coding, and metal, and grease.
“Yes, Barton, the medical team in charge of aiding his recuperation is already working to bring him about with the least amount of pain. The neurosurgeon has been
“The UN wouldn’t have let that stand,” Barton says though he doesn’t sound so sure. Tony merely looks back at T’Challa with a raised eyebrow.
“Yes, Tony. I’m absolutely, one hundred percent sure. They just confirmed with me yesterday. We’ll set up an appointment, yes?”
“See what?” Steve asked. His eyes were wide, pupils blown, as he searched desperately for an indication of what Tony was thinking. The brunette was numb, though, as the one realization he had been shying away from the whole time finally came into clear focus.
“You—what you did,” Tony rasped out. “You took more than the team. You—I trusted you. Even knowing better, I
to be Captain America. Sometimes, on his worst days, he smiles at the jokes and feels his stomach turn at how plastic and tight it feels on his face. He doesn’t refute the comments, but oh, are they wrong about them. The truth is that Steve’s penchant for being awake so early wasn’t because of the serum. It had more to do with the mornings when his chest felt tight and on fire as another bout of cold hit his skinny, sickly frame. It was due to another fever that woke him up too early. He’d liked being awake early when he was a kid and his Ma was sleeping off another double shift on the cot next to him. He’d lay there and look at her, play with her hair and massage her bony shoulders. Sometimes, if he was lucky and his Ma or Buck had the time, he’d get the treat of having a good book to read or a new sketchbook and pencils to crack into.
“You were right, Tony,” Steve says and somehow, though it’s what he’s always wanted, the confirmation leaves him feeling bereft. “You were right not to trust us. WE—no,
but he doesn’t want to push him. The only thing he can do is hold him close and pray he makes him feel safe.
“Stop,” Tony says, fiercely, pressing a kiss to his boy’s forehead. Peter’s eyes are closed tight, breath still coming out more like sobs, but he grips Tony tightly and seems to find comfort in that. “You don’t have to apologize to me for this. Not now, not ever. You know you can count on me, always, to catch you when this happens. I know how hard this is, a ghrá, I hate that you have to go through this pain, so don’t you ever apologize to me for this. Not when I’m the one making you go through it.”
“You’re not the one that has to deal with your mother,” Tony mutters. He’s still glaring at the paper in disgust. This time, even Steve rolls his eyes despite the consequences he knows he’ll be liable for.
. Why did he decide to trust the witch over him, why did he decide Tony was worth so little, why did he pick Barnes over the team,
“What did you plan to do after?” Lang’s voice was nothing but curious. “You said what they saw was bad, but not as bad as it could have been. If those were the stakes, how were you planning to do better?”
Tony screams, and the whole room goes eerily silent. The fight goes out of him and he slumps against the table. His shoulders sag with what feels like the weight of the world as he takes ragged breaths. His fingers itch to drum against a reactor that is no longer there. “You have no idea why I made Ultron. You were afraid, too, all of you. Natasha’s memories of the red room, Cap’s life before the tesseract, Bruce’s,” here, his voice breaks. “Bruce’s fear of losing himself into the Hulk. I get it, I get that you were all afraid after that, but I—I couldn’t help with that. I couldn’t change what had already happened to you all. You,” for the first time in what feels like forever Tony’s eyes meet Steve’s. “Were the only ones who could get over those fears. Other than Bruce, you wouldn’t have understood what it felt like to be shown something that could destroy everyone else, and know that it was your fault.”
have had to face those things alone, and that he would be damned if he was taken away from doing something
, he doesn’t say. “And that’s so important, Coop. I hope you never, ever have to feel like that,” Tony stares at the horizon but feels Cooper’s gaze locked on him. “I hope you
“A goddamn adult!” Steve slams his hand on the table, rattling the plates there. Natasha doesn’t even blink, but Steve knows her. He can read the surprise on her face. He guesses she hadn’t been expecting him to break this fast, but it’s been a long time coming. He’s been fraying at the edges since he dragged Bucky out of that bunker. “She’s old enough to make her own decisions, Nat. She’s with Viz, anyway, if they’re in trouble I really wouldn’t want to be the person that messes with them.”
“It was already underway,” the King says, and sounds as though it pains him to admit. Tony doesn’t know if his father had been an advocate for those regulations as well. He hopes not, for the young man’s sake. “In the very early stages, General Ross had managed to throw enough of his influence on his plans that he had sufficient backing from many members of the UN. It wasn’t until opposition rose from sitting, and new members invited to speak, that him and his followers backed up from the harsher protocols they wanted to introduce. What you all saw was a hard won compromise to provide more opportunities to enhanced individuals. Not just punishment, but reintegration if the case were to come up someone having outside influence exerted over them,” here, T’Challa gave a pointed glance to two members of the group sitting around the conference table.
“No, fuck this bullshit, Sam! This was a mistake. You know it. I know it. I’m not gonna sugar coat it. You fucked up,” he looks directly at Steve as he says it, and blows out a disgusted breath. After a moment of looking at each other, Bucky gets up and makes his way to the front door.
be his father, he’d consider drowning himself in the stash he still kept. But then memories of her disappointment and her anger the first time he’d gone down that spiral would resurface and he would refuse to let her down again. He’d already disappointed his mother, distant as she could be at times, he didn’t have the heart to do that to Aunt Peggy, too.
Steve’s Ma was Catholic, and she had introduced Steve into her faith. He had never been as pious as his Mama, but he had always believed in what she had taught him. He had a Saint Christopher medallion his father had owns and a tiny cross on a necklace he carried with him all the time. He hadn’t prayed in a while, had found himself drifiting from his mother’s faith the longer his pain lasted, but from time to time he found himself believing in miracles again.
Tony flexes his fingers at his side, wonders for a second if he’s doing the right thing, but then meets the kids’ stress behind Barton. Sees Lila holding tightly to Cassie’s hand on one side and Ginny, partially hidden behind her, on the other. Sees Peter stand behind Harley and Cooper, a hand on one of their shoulders. Listens to Bart-Bot’s even, content breathing behind him and knows he owes it to
Harley grins even further, and then laughs right along with him. “Ginny is going through a phase,” he says in that long suffering big brother tone that Tony has heard too many times from Rhodey. “I’m waiting for her to get to, like, the Hamilton part of her show tune obsession.”
“Is that how you saw me?” Steve’s eyes snap up to the brunet’s at the hitch in his voice. he doesn’t know where he went wrong, again, but it looks like he’d stepped on another landmine. Tony—well, he looks
Peter follows him into the room, his steps hesitant, and follows Tony to the rocker without a word. Tony is able to nudge him to sit down, and then carefully crouches in front of his boy, bundle in his arms. They’re both quiet and solemn as Tony passes the baby onto Peter’s arms even though he’s protesting weakly about dropping or hurting her. Tony shushes them both, because Peter’s freak out is starting to make the baby fuss and it’s not going to help any if she starts crying right now. Finally, she’s in Peter’s arms and he looks down at her wide eyed.
He’s gaunt and bony and overrun. Extremis is barely keeping up with the strain of it all, and he’s not making it simpler, but he can’t help it. Workaholic behavior seems to be engrained in his DNA the same way alcoholism was, apparently. He knows none of the others will be able to help him, give him any sort of respite, but at least it’s nice to know that there is more people with some experience dealing with bureaucratic bullshit.
Tony never answers the phone. Bucky tries and tries and tries, for weeks, but eventually the operator’s voice tells him the number has been disconnected. Bucky doesn’t give up for a while, though, he goes back to New York one weekend and doesn’t tell Steve. Sam is the one that sits with him waiting for news. Bucky calls once to say he’s trying, but by Monday he’s back and locks himself into his room.
“Captain Rogers, temporary access, granted,” FRIDAY’s voice says and the door separating him from the corridor suddenly opens. He stands there, mute, as he looks at the dimly lit corridor. “Sir is running simulations down this hall.”
Anyway, long rant, but the gist of it is that i hope i can write the next chapter soon. i'm gonna have to re read this whole thing again to get my bearings lol
“That’s bullshit!” Rhodey barks angrily in response. “You have no fucking clue what you’re talking about! Nobody forced you to do the things you’ve done, Clint!”
Though Tony wasn’t able to dwell on his heartbreak for too long, after that. For in December of that year, Howard and Susan Stark were killed in a fatal car crash. Rumor had it, though Tony was never able to see the forensics report, that Mr. Stark had been under the influence. The next few months after that were a blur of anger and confusion and
“Actually, he might not be anymore,” Rhodes says quietly. The entire room falls silent with a heavy kind of tension. Steve’s mind stutters to a stop.
at each other and Baby Barton burped and giggled. This continued for another couple minutes until FRIDAY informed them that Laura was requesting their presence for dinner, and also announced that T’Challa had arrived with their special package about an hour before. Which explained where Ste-
“I promised Dummy I’d come by,” the kid says as though he’s on a mission to break Tony’s complete heart at once.
His eyes are barely open when he sees it, a bright flash. It seems to grow bigger, grows brighter and warmer, the more looks at it. His smile grows, and though he’s sure the next time he blinks his eyes won’t open, he tries his best. He knew it. He knew
They stare at each other with an intensity that hasn’t been there in months. As the others file out, Tony takes stock of the other man. He looks as tired as Tony feels, and there’s an unhealthy hollowness to his cheek. The stubble on his chin is surprising. His hair is also longer than Tony remembers. His blue eyes are stormy, but they roam all over Tony’s face as if starving for the sight.  The mechanic can admit to himself that he has missed him terribly, like the hollow space between his ribs of something that should have been there but wasn’t.
And I know you don’t believe me, okay, but you let me prove to you that despite everything I am still your friend.”
Tony nodded, and gave Baby Bart a last kiss on the top of his head. Sam stared at Scott for a long while before he looked at Tony.
“You’ve not been summoned. You cannot simply present yourself there,” Vision said, and there was an edge to his voice. It was confirmation enough to know that the android was less than thrilled with him, too.
failings. I won’t let them.” The words felt like ash in his mouth and Steve knew that he was lying. They felt exactly like telling Tony
Steve had said. His eyes had looked so sincere. His strong fingers grabbing hold of his wrist and brushing tenderly against his pulse point.
When he makes his way into the dining room behind Steve and Harley, Tony allows himself a small smile. Steve turns to give him a tentative one in return, and the dark haired genius feels his cheeks heating up. Yeah, he knows the big crash is coming, knows that he’ll need Steve when it happens the same way Steve will need
“Morning,” Tony said quietly and the corner of his mouth quirked up into a tired smile. Steve heaved a quiet sigh of relief. Though it wasn’t the happy smile he got around his boys or baby Barton, at the very least it wasn’t the fake one he adopted when he was talking to the press and far too often around them these days. Steve was infinitely grateful that he hadn’t managed to set them back that far ahead.
“You were alone,” Harley says miserably and Steve blinks at the ceiling to stave off tears. “You were alone, and I couldn’t help you. I thought—“
Steve’s whole expression broke at that. His hands, shaking, moved to grasp at Tony’s wrists. If Tony weren’t so emotionally fucked up at the moment he would have found it strange that despite the fact they had literally almost killed each other, Steve holding onto him didn’t set the warning bells ringing this time. Or maybe it was the fact that the other man looked like the only thing tethering him was the hold he had on the mechanic. “I didn’t—“
He didn’t wait for her reply or to see what she’d do. He was already conflicted enough to see the emotions on his face. He always caved at seeing her sadness, and he knew it. He always felt like
“Hey, uh, the house bot told me where to find you guys,” he said with a nervous chuckle. Cassie gave him a big grin as she helped the other children to put the puzzle together, and he smiled at her adoringly. Then his eyes met Tony’s and he became serious again. “Mr. Stark, may I speak to you for a second?” he asked with an inclination of his head towards the empty hallway.
“I’m sorry. I just—I’m not—I just. Laura said I should do that,” Scott said awkwardly and seemed to be unable to meet Tony’s eyes.
“Steve?” Tony’s voice is hesitant as he pulls away to look up into the soldier’s eyes. He expects to see—he doesn’t know what he’s expecting to see, but it’s not the fragile hope he finds there. He wants to kiss the fear hidden behind the hope away. “ Stop?”
to be a part of this the moment you came to talk to me. I could have said no, and you would have left me alone. I could have chosen to stay normal when the spider bit me, Tony, before I even met you. I could have just pretended to still be normal, but I wanted to do something more. I told you,” his eyes are earnest as he looks at his mentor, and Tony rubs a hand to the phantom pain in his chest. “iWhen you do the things I can do… you have a bigger responsibility. I didn’t just come up with that, I
“No, let me—“he blows a breath to his nose. He feels his jaw clamping shut, fighting against his weakness, but he forces himself to open his mouth. “Wanda reminds me of myself, sometimes. She’s so young and she’s already lost so much, so when she’s… every time she’s in trouble, I feel like it’s on me. I had Bucky, back when I was growing up and I lost my Ma, and I always knew how lucky I was to even have that much. Every time you kept telling me she wasn’t a kid, I—in some way, I knew that. I
“He’s busy right now, bud,” Steve responded as he walked into the kitchen. The other kids were already sitting around the table, and Wanda and Vision were moving around the stove, clearly having picked up their old habit of trying out unfamiliar recipes.
“I don’t give a damn,” he said, ignoring the gasps from the kids. “I haven’t seen him in months. I’m his father. I damn well have the right.”
“I know it technically wasn’t him who killed my mother, for fuck’s sake, I’ve had time to process the information. He wouldn’t be back if I didn’t know that!” Tony’s excess energy bursts out of him and he springs to his feet.
“I thought I told you to go home!” he whisper-shouts because he’s stuck in a flying donut with an alien that could probably kill them all with a thought and his idiot
to see the blond so defeated. Now that they’re this close, Tony can see the deep circles under his eyes and how unkempt his hair is. He can see the way the other man is grinding his teeth, and the flush of shame across his cheeks and tinging the tops of his ears.
“You only look taller ‘cause you like wearing those weird platform shoe things,” Harley grins. Steve thinks back to a hours before and realizes that, while the spider boy still has some catching up to do, he’d probably overtake Tony soon.
“I’ll be fine,” Tony answered the unspoken question. It was no surprised that the other man had noticed how Tony used the baby as a touch stone when they had their earlier chat. The name was code-named the Falcon, after all.
Now it was the easiest thing in the world; he would talk himself hoarse about Bucky if one of his friends asked. Of course, he would get to it a little too late. He’s always too goddamn fucking late.
He ripped his hand away from the Captain and wrapped his arms around himself. He glared down at him, the sympathy he’d felt before evaporating and leaving him desolately cold.
. Steve stretches a hand to touch his upper arm, give him those old friendly squeezes that managed to bring him down from a screaming match, before, but Tony’s panicked eyes snap down to his hand as he takes a hasty step back. “Is that how it was?” his voice is as close to yelling as Steve has heard it and it sends the alarm bells ringing in Steve’s head immediately. “Like you were supposed to protect him from me like he did for you? From the bullies? Is that how it was for
. It’s one of the few things that had never been aired to the public like dirty laundry. Peggy had loved him, he knows, truly loved him, since before he had proven his worth by putting together a circuit board or building an engine. “Before Howard did… whatever it is that he did to destroy their friendship, she helped raise me. She’d drop by to see how I was doing.” Tony smiles his Peggy smile as he stares at her name, though his eyes burn with tears. “She bought me my first toy. I must have been, what, two? She gave me this Captain America action figure; Howard used to say I didn’t have time for toys, but she snuck it in when she was tucking me into bed one time and asked me to keep quiet. She used to do that a lot, you know, keep secrets with me. It made me feel special, I guess, ‘cause Aunt Peggy was so cool. She was my superhero.”
They lapse into silence as they both eat their lunch. Tony thinks of something to say, something wise and comforting, and wishes that Jarvis were still around. Either version of him would know what to say to a kid who’d just gotten his dad back better than Tony himself would. Howard had never been the comforting or fatherly type. He’d never played soccer with him on the backyard or driven him to school or helped him with his homework. He can’t exactly relate his experience to that of the kid currently sitting next to him. He does, however, know how devastating it is to feel abandoned. To feel as though your opinions aren’t important; especially when you’re vivacious and intelligent and kind like the boy now making him company.
“Help? Rogers, be serious. Why would anyone do that? She wouldn’t be the first person to blame me for a tragedy, okay? It’s not like it was an isolated incident.” Tony rolls his eyes as if finds the whole thing ridiculous. Steve has to reign his temper at the confirmation that,
The mechanic stared at him with wide eyes, and then the ridiculousness of the situation got to him and he began to laugh. Honestly, less than a year ago this man had turned ginormous and had tried to squeeze him and his friends like grapes. Less than a year ago, this man had told him that Hank Pym, a man who didn’t know anything about Tony, had been right in saying not to trust a Stark. Then he turns all of that around and tells hugs him. When he had created Iron Man, Tony had never thought about just how strange things would be for him. Though the foes from outer space and dude with a reindeer helmet should have clued him in.
“Yeah, I know. I’m sorry. It’s just… I just… I’m worried about you. I don’t… you’re not okay, and you weren’t before and nobody noticed and then you had to call me and I didn’t know what to do and I don’t want that to happen again.” Tony opens his mouth to refute him, but clearly the kid is on a roll. “I mean, I guess now we have Peter and FRIDAY would definitely call him before me, but then you’d be alone and I wouldn’t know, and then Rhodey would be worried and then I’d be worried and then you’d pretend like it’s okay but we’ll know it’s not and you’ll try so hard to make it seem like it was but now there’ nobody to drag you out of the lab and—“
Steve thinks as he remembers the pain and betrayal he’d seen the last time they were face to face. And there is another Steve Rogers. This one in a darker uniform than Steve remembers, and an expression on his face he doesn’t recognize. It’s not—it’s not serious; it’s worse. It’s uncaring.
When he hears DUM-E beep quietly, though decidedly defensive, he thinks it’s about time he intervenes. Harley is grinning though Peter is reaching Tony’s level of scolding the poor boy, hand on his hip and the other pointing at the bot.
For the next two or three years, Tony had been… well, a mess. He’d started blowing his classes, and his friends, and once at a party he’d met up with Aldrich and Maya. They’d been dating at the time and
Steve’s vision goes white around the edges at that and there’s a ringing in his ears that doesn’t let him think. He stares at the screen, horrified, as a blurry red shape zooms past on the top corner. The reporter is still talking, but all Steve can hear is the whine of repulsors as the armor picks up speed following some—thing, floating up towards the space ship.
6) If you don't like it or will start hating on Tony at any point I would like to point you to the exit and tell you to never revisit my work again because I've dealt with people trying to shit talk me before and i honestly have no patience for it anymore.
“It’s late,” he finds himself saying to the others. He doesn’t acknowledge her presence. “I think we can file this away until tomorrow. That’s two down, so that leaves us four to go. Won’t be much longer now.”
Tony thinks as he begins his speech. He pulls up the pictures, the documents, the uncovered footage and glimpses of conversation. The final nail in the Accords coffin, thank God.
“oh, baby,” Tony says and his heart aches for this boy. Trying to be so strong for everyone else he’s tearing himself apart. “Baby, you don’t have to be strong for us, okay? We’re family. We take care of each other. If you need help, then we help each other. You don’t have to carry all of that inside you, honey. It’s not good for you.”
“Us,” Steve says, adding salt to the wound with a clarification they both know is unnecessary. He feels cruel, with the other boy’s full body wince, and the way he takes a step back.
“I did,” Steve said, feeling the words hit him like a blow. “Which is why I’m staying at the compound. I talked to Tony, and he told me why I was considered a liability more than an asset to you. If I’m in the room, they’ll lump you in with me. They’ll try to—to blame you for
Turns out, when and if Tony gets back on earth, he has one more thing to rub on the good captain’s face.
They shared a laugh as they went back to the rec room, and then had to double up laughing as they caught sight of Sam. He was sitting with a long suffering look on his face as Lila and Cassie painted his fingernails with the mini bottle of polish from their toy vanity, and Cooper sat with Nate on his lap and suggested colors to the girls. The pilot had a feathered boa around his neck, rings on the tips of his fingers where they couldn’t go anything farther down, and Cooper’s tiara sitting lopsidedly on the top of his head.
“You can start by talking to your own son, if you can’t talk to your teammates,” Laura’s voice snaps him out of the reverie. “You—don’t take this the wrong way, but you moved all the way to New York when she needed help but you won’t cross the compound to speak to your own son. He’s as observant as you are, Clint, and he’s noticed.”
.  T’Challa claps Rogers on the back and then crosses the room to where Tony is still sitting and gives him a reassuring squeeze to his shoulder.
“Yeah, you said we could come visit you and the boys. Har wants to see some of the improvements we made to the web shooters last time. Plus, the roadsters still needs a tune up! He could help,” Peter continued just as enthusiastically. Tony glanced up at his boys in amusement and exasperation, but merely nodded and they were off like a rocket. “We’ll see you down there!”
“Why now?” He presses. He has been wandering around for weeks, and this is the first time she has spoken to him. His heart begins to pound on his chest as he speculates the whys. There was a time, long before his world crashed around his ears again, when he’d been given the silent treatment by JARVIS. Solid three weeks of radio silence after he and Tony had gotten in a screaming match that had turned
Steve wakes up to kisses being placed all over his recent freckles. It’s the same way he’s woken up every summer for the last three years of his marriage and he can’t help the silly grin that spreads across his face. The man on top of him laughs and presses open mouthed kisses down his throat. Steve groans and rolls over, pinning the body of his husband over his as he blinks his eyes open.
It feels so strange to be standing next to Steve in his way. He doesn’t even mean the fact that the soldier has yet to let go of him, one arm like a vice around him waist, fingers flexing around his hip. No, what he means is that it’s strange to be standing
The kicker, what makes Steve get a red haze in his vision and Bucky snarl under his breath, are the bruises on his throat. They look too much like fingerprints for anyone to mistake them for anything but what they are. When he gets a microphone shoved in his face, Tony smiles the loose grin of someone high on painkillers and throws a one liner before Rhodey shuffles him towards the waiting car. Tony, loose limbed, grin on his split lips and bruised body gives a jaunty little wave at the cameras and then he’s gone.
“Tony has been here the whole time. That’s why—that’s what the red zones mean, isn’t it?” he smacks his forehead as he realizes something. “
Steve thought about leaving for the gym, or maybe even a run, after he left the others in the dining room. He tried to shake the look on Wanda’s face out of his mind, but it seemed to haunt him as he worked his way to the training room. He felt torn in two, in that moment, but he couldn’t shake the guilt that gnawed at him the longer he was away from his friend. Not for the first time, he wondered if he had made the right choice in letting her go on her own. He’d worked himself into a state, not even changing into his workout clothes or taping his hands, and had decided to say to hell with everything and accompany Wanda and the others, when he turned around and caught a glance of the training shield Tony had made for him to train with.
“Banner’s notes,” there’s heavy skepticism in Wanda’s voice, and Tony bites another angry retort back. The way things are going he feels as though he will soon be tasting blood. Natasha’s hand squeezes his and it isn’t until that moment that he notices that she’d had a hold of him the whole time. She gives him a look that begs him to be patient, and he can’t do nothing but slump back in his chair. They haven’t even been together for five minutes and he already feels as though this was one of the worst ideas he’s ever had. He created Ultron, that in and of itself says a lot.
As always, thank you... every single one of you, for the continued support and love. Thank you for loving Tony as much as I do. And i'll see y'all in, hopefully, a short while :D
The kitchen falls silent at that, except for the sound of Nate babbling and the girls discussing colors, but the rest of them don’t say a word. Steve, looking up from feeding Nate a cube of melon, looks up to notice the dark expressions on the boys’ faces. Peter looks especially ticked off.
“Dude, it’s your favorite,” Harley says as he passes a slice of peach cobbler to Cooper. The boy surreptitiously wipes his arm across his eyes, and the others politely look away. “Your mom is a badass cook.”
Whatever it is, he thinks, he’s not going to be able to do it alone. There’s nothing for him to punch here. Nothing that he can see that will come and knock him against a trashcan in a filthy Brooklyn alley. Bucky is far away, and his ma has been gone a long while. There’s no Peggy to take charge, or Howard to charm their way out of trouble. There’s no Erskine with a crazy plan to make him better, no ailment to find a miracle cure for. For a second the despair of that almost overwhelms him, but on the exhale of that breath he remembers that he hasn’t been alone. Not since that faithful day when he saw a Tin Can falling out of the sky after pulling that hail mary.
Scott gave him a solemn nod, which Tony returned, then he made his way back to the rec room. Before he could enter, Ant-Man caught his arm again. It seemed like this was something the mechanic would have to get used to, though he smiled a little. There were worse habits to put up with than this.
“Despite what you may believe, my friend,” Steve says and he has to fight down the burning in his eyes. “You are not a murderer. Besides, I have fought alongside you long enough to know what the suit is capable of, Tony. You’ve torn down aliens with your repulsors, and you want me to believe I stood any change to fight you and win? You weren’t the one fighting that battle to
. But that’s just it, isn’t it? That would taste like a lie too. “I should go,” he finally says, just loud enough for them to hear.
“I heard,” Laura says sympathetically. She has a sad smile on her face as he looks over at him, and Clint’s heart squeezes. Dear God, how he loves her. “You just miss your uncle, don’t you, baby bird?” At Clint’s raised eyebrow, she chuckles and bounces the baby on her hip. “Peter’s nickname; it kind of just stuck after the first few times. Have you tried taking him to the others?” Clint knows she means the other children.
“I don’t know what else to do, Tony,” Steve’s eyes are bright and earnest as they look up into Tony’s. “I have no illusions that this is enough, but I wanted to show you how sorry I am. If this is the only chance I have to begging for forgiveness from you, then I want to do it right. Tony, I failed you. Not just with Bucky, I—“the Captain’s breath hitches as he stares up at Tony.
“That’s one more hours of community service for you, mister,” Tony points at Harley with his fork before digging in. The other two giggle while Harley pouts and take a sulky bite of his cobbler.
the thought that we all took to her the way we did! What, you think we betrayed you? That we all took her side instead of yours? Well, newsflash, asshole, that’s what happens when you’re not a piece of shit!”
“Yes! Yes, I need to—see yourself out, I’ll be—” he can’t even fully form sentences, that’s how excited he is. He walks to the door, makes it three steps into the hall, before he remembers his wallet and phone are still on his desk not to mention
out of some rando’s house,” Rhodes shakes his head. “Everyone had an opinion, you know, about why he was doing that shit. They made him out to be—dear God, the crap they’d publish about him. how he was just waiting, how he was probably
, that this is where he is supposed to be. He has to keep the danger as far away from his kids as he can, but for one single second he can’t help but feel infinitely alone. If by some miracle he makes it out of this, there will be nobody but Strange for company. He would be stranded—oh God.
“Her name’s Morgan,” Rhodey says with an air of the defeat as he stares at them. Everyone else in the room seems to be holding their breath. “Well, Sarah really but To—we’ve just been calling her Morgan.”
body was equipped with the serum, he already didn’t need more than a few hours at the time, but Tony had already been running on fumes as it was. Steve moved to his side and cautiously put a hand on the other man’s back and smoothed it up and down in an attempt at comforting.
“Unc’a ‘Ony, cowors!” he said, and sounded proud of himself. “Ye-llo!” he said and pointed at Laura’s blouse. Tony grinned down at him, bursting with pride. Score!
“Don’t,” Steve tells him pleadingly. His attempt at making Tony let go of his wrist is feeble at best. He’s avoiding looking at the engineer, and the brunette is afraid he’s going to bite right through his lip. “I understand, Tony. It’s fine. I just—I—I just wanted you to know that—“
He turned around with difficulty, but he wanted Barton to know how insignificant he thought him to be. It wasn’t true, Tony knew better than most how dangerous he truly was, but this was nothing more than a pissing contest. A way for Barton to prove to himself that he still had a hold over his family. That he could still provide. It might have been more animal instinct that anything else, but Barton wouldn’t take Tony down with him in this. If the sharp intake of breath from behind him was any indication, Tony had managed to hit his mark.
. He will not win this battle, not now that he has caused too much pain, to make Tony see himself in any kind of flattering light. “She had a picture of Charlie, old school glossy paper and everything, and she told me his story. She was so proud of that kid, I could see it, and I was too. Young Americans going out there and doing good with nothing more than their brains? I could be born a thousand times over, and never amount to half of their good work.”
“Told you not to leave him unsupervised,” Tony’s voice says and he sounds much closer than he should. Steve looks up in time to have Bart-Bot get thrown into his arms.
“What we had,” and Rhodey’s tone is subtly sarcastic, “doesn’t include Peter. He wasn’t part of the Avengers. He doesn’t need to be here. There’s no bad blood with him.”
“’Teve! Ahhh!” Nate says and gnaws at his cheek. Steve blows a raspberry onto the baby’s cheek that sends him into a fit of giggles.
With a sigh, he tucks into his dinner and wills himself to stop being so maudlin. So what if some of his former fa—friends don’t like him anymore. It’s not as if he has never experienced that feeling before. Howard had been a very adamant teacher in that; every time he’d send Tony to a new boarding school when he began to be too “distracted” with other children. All it took was for one child to greet Tony by name in Howard’s presence for him to be relocated, and god forbid he find Tony speaking to someone on the telephone or exchanging emails or letters. As he grew older, the younger Stark had begun to be cleverer in hiding his distractions. By then it was others that had begun to tech Tony about heartache and lost friendships. It was the kids that befriended him for his money or connections, and the kids that found him too tiresome to deal with. It was the quick-as-lightning relationships he had that sought a comfort he never found, and were later labeled as one night stands by the tabloids. It was the people like Ty Stone who found too fragile and insecure to deal with but perfect for breaking, the people like Justin Hammer who didn’t even pretend. After his father, it was all the people who taught Tony that letting go was better and simpler than trying to hold on when he wasn’t worth it. When it was too much for people to handle; too much insecurity, too much neglect, too much brashness, too much of an asshole, too reckless… just… too much.
“That’s very good, sweetheart!” she praised. “Your Uncle Tony’s pretty smart, huh?” she asked the baby, and Tony blushed. He let his eyes roam around the kitchen and noticed the others weren’t paying any attention to them. It made him breathe easier until he caught Barton’s stormy eyes on him.
“Yeah, that’s kind of why we’re worried about you, actually. You’ve been spacing out on us a lot, man, you sure you’re all right?” Steve sighs, a wisp of guilt curling in his belly as he looks at Sam’s worried eyes. He knows he hasn’t been the same in a while, but… well. As he said, he’s been trying. “You know we’re here for you, right? If you need help or anything, right, Bucky?” Except Bucky isn’t paying attention. His narrowed eyes are locked on the television set that had caught Steve’s attention before. “Bucky?”
“All right, buddy, let’s get you some food,” he heaved himself off the couch and cradled the baby easily on one arm. The boy leaned his head against his shoulder, clearly still sleepy, and babbled at him.
The soldier opens his mouth to say something else, more platitudes or more attempted promises, the mechanic doesn’t know. He is interrupted, however, when Tony’s glance over his shoulder and widen in alarm. Running on instinct alone, Steve uses one of his hands to cup the back of Tony’s head and hunches down around him. He doesn’t know what the dark haired man say, but he’s sure as hell not going to let whatever it is hurt the other man.
“Actually we do,” Bruce pipes in from where he had been studying the hologram. He had a tablet in his hand, FRIDAY running diagnostics for him as the only one with the access codes now, and Steve refuses to think of how much that hurts. “Thor, Stormbreaker might be able to, right?”
He grabs onto the edges of the table for a second as he remembers the avalanche of cars dropping over him. The scene too reminiscent of the Malibu house falling on top of him while the suit was down. Punctured and shutting down, and he couldn’t
His head had snapped to the sound; footsteps that had sounded too light and too unsure to be anything but a baby. He would know that sound anywhere, it used to be one of his favorites, maybe it still was. Back when Peter had delighted himself with toddling everywhere and bouncing out of walls and giggling as he went.
” the blond is shaking his head vehemently before Tony has even finished talking. “When did that happen?” Tony’s eyes are unfocused in a way that makes Steve sick; he’s seen this before. Dear God, has he ever. “When did us against the world become you against
He’d known, of course he had, that this final piece of his puzzle would call forth the most attention. Nobody had really batted an eye at the first set of pardons (Clint had been out of public eye enough and nobody really cared about Lang’s petty theft, and Sam was decorated serviceman,) the rest though. Stev—Cap, may have been America’s golden boy at one point but after New York and especially Leipzig, his reputation had been shot all to hell. The Maximoff girl and Barnes had been even worse.
“B-boss—boss” FRIDAY’s voice comes to him through static and his heart beats a loud staccato in his chest.
from him, just like that?” Steve’s breath shutters into a sob, and he shakes his head. “So the next time you start telling yourself that he overreacted, that he—I don’t know, had to snap to the rational conclusion that Barnes was brainwashed when he
. God, was I wrong,” he laughs, a harsh sound that breaks out of his chest unbidden. “So when we discovered that Ana wasn’t going—how long she had, I thought I was ready. I mean, I was so goddamed doped up around those years that I just—I thought I had it under control. But when it came down to it, and I saw Jar—Jarbiss,” his name comes out with the familiar lips he used to have every time he got too upset. The one Howard and his bullies made sure to beat out of him, but the Jarvises always found so endearing. “I’d never seen Jarvis so upset, and something in me just
“Yeah,” Tony breathes, bringing him close again. Peter merely snuggles into it, like he used to do when he was little and has been doing more consistently in the past two years as they both tried to work through the grief. “The best, actually. Marina came by my office today right before I called you. She had something for us.”
He turns from side to side, his eyes narrowed, but nothing happens. He sits up, pulls the IV line off his arm, and nothing happens. Tentatively, he stands up on wobbly knees and realizes someone has put him in new clothes. His vest and sweatpants are gone, and instead he’s on some kind of one piece suit. It reminds him of his old flight suit. He notices his hoodie and sweatpants, the nanotech ones, placed on top of the bedside table. Stupid, but he won’t question it. He pulls the hoodie and the sweats on, though his suit is damaged, it still brings him a little bit of comfort.
Lang doesn’t say anything, and Clint doesn’t seem willing to let Lila go so Tony pats Cooper’s head and ushers him out in the direction of the exit. “Buh-bye, buh-bye,” Nate is singing now while opening and closing his little fist. Tony chuckles at the kid’s antics as he goes.
that came after—well, after. That Peter and Morgan should never see their father crumble; not when he was the only one left with nobody else to tag in. but maybe he’d gone about it the wrong way; Tony knows, goddamn well, his propensity to hide the way he actually feels. He knows that his proficiency at it manages to fool even those he trusts the most at times. maybe what Peter needed wasn’t the image of a strong parent, but of his dad who went through his trauma and is struggling, no matter how much practice he’s had, to work through the fall out.
Steve can’t say anything, and with one last long look at him and a trembling smile, Tony turns around and walks into his apartment leaving Steve in the barely-falling snow.
When they come back it’s to a house that looks familiar, but does not hold the same kind of feeling of
“Where is he?” Steve snaps, and then presses his lips to the baby’s head as he whimpers again. He feels his heart beating frantically against his chest. Tony hadn’t left the facility in the
“We need to go,” Harley breaks up, finally. He throws his chair back and begins to grab his tablet and phone as Peter shovels the last of his pancake into his mouth.
“I’d watch your language, if I were you, Pete,” Rhodey’s voice holds a trace of amusement. Tony enters the kitchen, about to make fun of his hypocritical brother, when he sees the other occupant in the room and Rhodes finishes his thought. “Cap has a thing for language.”
Laura has baby Nate in her arms, his eyes huge as they stares at his father and sister, and Cooper is standing stock still next to her. His eyes are tearing up, but there’s a scowl on his face as he stares at his father. When Clint’s face comes out of Lila’s hair, he meets the eyes that are so like his own, and Tony has to look away at the pain there at his son’s rejection. He gets to his feet, Lila still cradled protectively in his arms, and takes an aborted step forwards. The whole room has gone silent, and when Tony meets Tasha’s eyes he says that he’s not the only one affected.
“He did it,” Steve says in both wonder and terror. They had talked about this, back when Steve still had his head screwed on straight and Tony wasn’t as broken. Back when Steve could still feel wonder at all the impossible things tony did on a daily basis. He had told him, late at night with that sparkle in his eyes, about the nanos. “Son of a bitch, he actually finished,” a chuckle leaves his lips. Then a laugh. The others look at him in concern, but he can’t help himself. It’s the first time in over two years that he’s felt this lighthearted even under the circumstances.
“So what’s the plan?” Thor’s voice booms from the entry way. It’s the most aware anyone has seen him look since the battle against Thanos. Everyone of them knows that he has lost, what nobody knows, but out of all of them Thor looks to be faring the worse. His dual-colored eyes stare intently at Tony’s hologram, though, the determination they have always admired in him coming off of him in waves. Nobody speaks to answer his question, and he turns around to glare at Steve. The Captain’s insides turn at the hostility and accusation in his eyes. “You cannot expect us to sit idle and let him die.”
Ned’s new set sounds. Tony isn’t too concerned about the work, though, because he trusts his son and Peter has never in his life been sloppy when it comes to his homework.
“Plus, last I read on those trashy tabloids while I was doing recon, they’re not together anymore. There was that proposal, remember?” Natasha says.
When he takes it from her, her eyes snap from her husband to his and a hand raises to his cheek. One finger brushes against his cheek as she gives him a nod. Before, he would have been forced to stay, he knows. Now, though, she only gives him a reassuring nod as he makes a hasty exit. He vaguely hears the legs of a chair scraping against the hardwood floor, but he can’t be bothered to find out who, if anyone, is following him.
“You know, people say that doing the same thing expecting different results is the definition of insanity,” Laura says as Nate rubs his little face on her shoulder.
“Harley Keener,” the boy says in a clipped tone. He takes the soldier’s hand, and Steve knows he’s gripping as hard as he can. It doesn’t do much, obviously, but the soldier knows the intent behind the gesture. It’s a warning in and of itself, and that’s even before the boy smiles up at him and says, “And I know of two elements on the periodic table that could destroy vibranium. Bet Tony would be able to get them for me if I asked.”
“It’s not you fault, babbo. I know how much it hurts you too. I just—I just keep thinking it’ll get easier, you know? I keep trying to make myself work through it; trying to tell myself that I have you and zio Rhodey and Viz, but it just—some days I just feel so
“You’re not going to lose me,” Tony says in that voice Steve recognizes from countless missions together. The voice he used when he’d find Steve in the gym after a nightmare, and promised him he’d never have to go back into the ice. Not on his watch. “I have bad days; more often than most people. I’ve had really, really shit days lately—“
. And he wants to listen, dear God does he want to, but his heart. his battered, stupid, treacherous heart won’t let him. Steve looks so fucking sincere. Looks just as broken and tired and
The simulations go over and over and over again. Steve drops to his haunches on the other side of the glass as he watches. Tony moves to one of the nearby worktables when he tires of standing, but the sims don’t stop. One after the other, and it hurts, it goddamn breaks Steve’s heart, the more desperate Tony becomes. It’s been minutes or hours or days when Tony screams on the other side of the glass, a sound that bring goosebumps to Steve’s arms at how desperate and agonized it sounds, and shoves at the table in front of him.
But Tony didn’t have the words to say that, anymore, and his eyes were drooping. His limbs felt like they were filled with lead; he felt heavier then than when he was in the armor. So he let his eyes close, one hand reaching out to the boy that had been jostled away by the paramedics but he was gone. Tony’s fingers stretched, desperately, his eyes roaming around but the boy was gone.
okay, they were still his best friends. Anyways, that summer was impressed in Tony’s memory forever for two very pivotal reasons.
“Tony can feed him just fine. He’s been taking care of him for months,” she said, and there was barely controlled anger in her tone.
The rest of the restaurant falls silent behind Steve. Vaguely, he registers Sam asking for drinks for the table. Hears him asking if Bucky thinks this is a good idea, though he hasn’t been present enough to know what
“I’m gonna be taller than you, soon,” Harley says mischievously as they pull away. He wipes his nose on the back of his arm, and Tony makes a disgusted noise. He pulls a handkerchief from his back pocket, and Steve will ask about that, and hands it to the boy. Harley rolls his eyes but takes it with a smile.
He enters the compound in the same way that he had exited his office, almost running and breathless from excitement. The folder in his hands feels heavy, like the weight of the whole world rests in a few flimsy pages, and he figures it might as well. They had been waiting, so long, for something like this to happen. So many opportunities that had fallen through, so many disappointments that had broken everyone’s hearts, but this time… oh, this time I real. This time the proof is right there in his hands.
“I got all my degrees and a Van Dyne dress for Hope,” Cassie says as she scoops peas into her amused father’s plate.
“I met Tony when I was in my third year at MIT. He was placed as my roommate, and at the beginning I hated the idea of it. Of having a freshman in my dorm room and having to listen to his hormonal ass bemoan everything about university. Seeing him made everything so much worse,” Rhodes gives a fond chuckle and shakes his head. Steve is riveted because for all that Tony loves talking he never really says much in the way of insight into his own life. “I was trying to get through university as fast as I could, and then suddenly there was this thirteen year old kid in my dorm room telling me he was my roommate. And as the first semester progressed, I can’t say that I was very fond of him. He
“Mmmm,” he says concomitantly. Natasha has been trying to get him to talk about his feelings since she joined them in Wakanda. The only thing he had managed to actually be truthful about had been Bucky, and isn’t that a bitch. Used to be that he would rather walk through glass than talk about what Bucky’s condition was doing to him.
“I think it’s just about time for dinner, actually,” Tony said and gave a grin at the other man’s grateful look. “Pretty sure Laura has made food for the whole platoon by now.”
“Not Ross, boss,” FRIDAY says and then does that weird sound that Tony equates to a giggle whenever she says it like that.
“So Vision’s out of the question,” Steve interrupts when Wanda opens her mouth. He sends her a glare that used to work with Peter when he was in a mood to be sassy, and he’s glad that it works on her too. “Still, we need to find out what’s going on if—”
“Hi, little traitor,” Tony says to the baby and Nate laughs. His aunt Tasha calls him that sometimes, and after the third visit Tony had paid to his mom and siblings he had been allowed to call him that, too.
On the ninth, Steve had tried to ask Harley if he knew how his mentor was. The boy had glared up at him, fists curled at his side, and an angry scowl on his face. Steve had braced himself for a swearing down or even an attempted punch, but it seemed as though the boy had learned from Tony’s coping mechanisms because his face went black.
He’s just finishing feeding Nate his fruit, and the girls had eaten whatever Wanda had made for them and were chatting amongst themselves, when Laura, Natasha and the king walk into the kitchen. Steve perks up at their entrance when Laura lets the girls know they’re needed in the living room and makes a beeline for him. He hands the baby over when she extends her arms, and she gives him a look. Laura had been mostly friendly to him, apart from that first day back when Clint had been a dick, but they’re not really close enough for him to know
Because Tony is still rooted to the spot despite the dismissive note to his words he notices the determined jutting of the Captain’s jaw. The man takes purposeful strides towards Tony, and the mechanic forces himself to stand his ground. His heart hammers in his chest, and because of the way his breath stutters he knows he’s seconds away from being thrown into an attack. Panic claws its way into his throat and his mouth goes dry. The familiar sensation of extremis reacting to his flight or fight response prickles at the back of his mind, and he curses himself for trashing the suits he’d had in the compound. They’re in ‘storage’ now, which means they’re at the tower to be used under Rhodey’s discretion. After their first week, and the stupidly ill advised ‘joy ride’ Tony had taken which resulted in a trashed workshop and half an acre of woods charred, the mechanic had thought it’d be best if he stepped away from the armor for a while. More often than not the suit feels more like a curse these days. And it sucks, it bites and tears at Tony to have his second chance, bought in blood by a man too good for such a cruel world, taken away. But every time he’d looked at the scars on the armor he’d been back in that bunker, every time he stepped inside his cocoon he’d heard the whirring of a metal arm and the hollow sound of a vibranium shield; every time he’d looked at the HUD screen all he’d seen was what was meant to be a familiar arc-reactor blue that sent his panic spiking.
Steve winces internally, but forces himself not to show the other boy anything. Tony knows how to read him too well now, but whatever internal conflict he’s having appears to be keeping him from pointing out Steve’s shitty attempt at nonchalance. Steve feels relieved. Then hates himself for feeling relieved; for causing Tony this much pain.
, Christ, before his arms wrap around the boy just as tightly. He gives a wet chuckle, and then says quietly, “okay, shortstack.”
“He’s getting the flu,” Peter said, already munching on some cereal. He had managed to get himself a couple of sandwiches, an apple, a cup of jello that was meant for the girls and Nate, his cereal and a cup of coffee. Harley, with slightly less food, was munching not less enthusiastically. Tony turned to him with an unimpressed look at the sheer amount of food, and raised an eyebrow. “Cooper texted us last night,” he said pointing at Harley, who nodded and went back to his book. “Said his parent couldn’t sleep ‘cause the Bot kept crying. Think he got a fever or something.”
“I… suppose you want her to—“Tony stumbles over his words. It wouldn’t be the first time he’s had to be around Cassie. After… everything went to shit, he’d hunted down the Barton and Lang families to try and keep them safe. He had no doubt in his mind that Ross or anyone else would eventually attempt to use them as bait for the fugitives. Even months later he doesn’t know how Tasha and Laura had corralled him into babysitting on more than one occasion.
If tony were hard pressed into giving an answer he would say that he had the most peaceful of rests that night. He would say that he didn’t toss and turn half the night trying to not freak out about the next day. He would like to say that once he got to sleep, he didn’t wake up to nightmares about the vision the witch had given him or the things that he had done. He would like to say that he didn’t wake up, gasping, clutching at his chest for a reactor that hadn’t been there for years. He would like to say that, halfway through the struggle, he hadn’t just given up and gone down to his workshop to keep tweaking the exoskeleton upgrades for Rhodey.
to apologize for. I’m the one that hurt you. I’m the one that made you think that I could ever—I wouldn’t, Tony, I wouldn’t do that again. I was just—I know, okay, I
. He was right about not trusting the accords, he was right not to sign them, he was right about everything; signing the accords wasn’t worth what was done to this team.”
It’s only because Coop is suddenly at his side, plastered to Tony really, and Nate is going off on a litany of “Unc’a ‘Ony, Unc’a ‘Ony,” as if he’s singing a little song to himself that the mechanic finds himself nodding. He ruffles Cooper’s hair and turns to Cassie. Lang is still hugging her to his chest, but now he’s giving Tony a look that can only be described as assessing.
but they could tell he was curious too. Wanda was eyeing him wearily and Vision placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. Steve guessed they had managed to make up when she didn’t immediately shake him off.
Then Tiberius fucking Stone happens, and Steve has to try his best to not go off the rails. Tony’s stay at the hospital, apparently, was just the tip of a long-coming iceberg. When he gets out of medical care, because of the secrecy SI maintained or because the news just loved to shit talk him, he is swarmed by reporters. He’s wearing sunglasses, but there’s a dark purple bruise that’s still visible despite them. His arm is in a cast, and when he walks out the doors holding on to Rhodey’s arm, he hunches in on himself as though his ribs pain him.
God, excuse the fuck out of me, Agent Barton,” the title suddenly and irrationally feels like a slap to the archer. “For thinking that the only member of my team who had gone through something similar might understand what I went through.”
“C’s get degrees,” Harley mutters and steve is afraid Tony might pop a vein if the confrontation keeps going. He is too entertained to interrupt, however. “Anyway, I’m talking about the fact that you didn’t tell Pete that
They have to go past Steve, however, and the soldier doesn’t feel like being left out of the loop right now. he knows he told Sam that he would let them do things at their pace, but goddamn it. he’s so fucking worried about Tony right now. and clearly, wherever he is is cause for concern in the boys that care so much about him. Clearly he hasn’t been okay for the past few days, and leaving him alone probably hadn’t helped as much as they’d hoped.
“We have some news, Ms. Maximoff,” T’Challa begins after sharing a look with Natasha. She merely stares at Wanda.
Clint feels the phantom icy feeling of tendrils grabbing onto his mind. Sees the memory of the blue-fire tinge everything had taken when Loki had taken control of him. Fears the anger and the impotence of seeing his friends hurt, and being unable to do anything. Feels the guilt that came afterwards. The nightmares that woke him and his family constantly on his first few months back. Feels the worthless feeling of thinking that you could have done more but hadn’t.
Hogan opens the door for Rhodes and moves to the driver’s seat, leaving Steve to fend for himself. He’s not completely strapped in before Happy lurches the car forward and the blond nearly brains himself falling forward.
“Yes, well,” the man said enigmatically. Then he cleared his throat and, though he had been standing straight, seemed to grow taller. The mood in the room immediately became more alert. “While we wait for the last person to arrive, I would like to address a question that I am sure most of you are concerned about. Seeing as Sergeant Barnes can’t tell you himself, I would like to inform you all that he is well and in the process of being reanimated from his voluntary cryostasis.”
“Harley, oh my God,” Tony groans in annoyance and then bursts out laughing at the shocked look on the soldier’s face. Harly grins up at both of them. Before anyone can make a comment, FRIDAY’s amused voice comes from the speakers in the conference room.
The Merchant of Death had wreaked havoc on the world for a very long time. It was only fair that it came to collect tenfold.
“So she was alone, and surrounded by people she didn’t know, probably didn’t like, and thought she couldn’t trust. And then there’s this guy, this simple human dude with nothing but a bow and arrow and a kickass set of deadly skills,” Tony pokes the kid’s side and manages to garner a smile. “and he’s willing to go out there for this random city, her city, and protect it because that’s just what he does. Just another day in the office, and suddenly she has one person she cares about and can count on. And your dad? Coop, your dad is so fucking good that he takes her under his wing and makes sure that she’s watered and fed and protected. He makes sure that she has a home, and training and most of all, the most important thing of all, that she feels like she matters. He makes her feel like she is meaningful and powerful and a person deserving of love despite what she’s gone through,”
,” Rhodes says with a chuckle, and Steve can see it. Doesn’t even have trouble imagining it. “That’s when I got to see the pattern, you know? I had been an asshole to him before, but once I started giving him attention? He just—exploded. Anything I mentioned I wanted, it would miraculously find itself into our dorm room. If I asked him out to get pizza with me, he’d pay for the whole thing and leave a ridiculous tip. If I wanted to get to a party, he’d blow a hell of a lot of money on alcohol so I could take it with me. If I needed help with my homework, he’d offer to do it for me. It was—it was
“I know,” Tony says with a soft smile. Honestly, these kids. “He’s spent most of his days here watching me. It’s a bit creepy, honestly, but you don’t need to worry. Things are… not good, but at least they are civil.”
Steve!” Tony says proudly. The baby gives him a gummy smile and raises his arms towards him. He’s well versed in sign communication at this point, seeing as it is essential to his babysitting duties, and understands him perfectly. Stupidly, after months of practice, he approaches the baby to pick him up. What he doesn’t stop to think, however, is
“But you’re not ‘cause you’re coming with us,” Cooper says mischievously. A giggle on his other side lets him know that Lila has now joined them. Tony rolls his eyes at her, and she gives him a big smile.
“Tony had a contingency plan,” Natasha says seriously. Tony opens his mouth to contradict her, but she merely shoots him a glare and so he remains silent. “We started working on it the minute Ross came to give his pitch. Research, evidence, anything that could incriminate Ross was dug up no matter how hard he tried to hide it.”
“I think this meeting can be adjourned now,” T’Challa says quietly. When Steve opens his mouth to argue, he raises a hand. “It seems what you and Anthony have to discuss is far too personal and involving no more than the two of you. It is time we retire, and let you speak with each other.”
Back when Howard was still heavily involved with SHIELD, before him and Aunt Pegs had their falling out, he’d commissioned a part of the cemetery be laid out for fallen agents. Seeing as most of them worked in covert operations that never met the public eye, he didn’t feel as though they quite belong in DC with the other fallen soldiers. He thought, and Tony still has such a hard time wrapping his head around his father being so
“Hey,” he hears Laura say quietly next to him. He knows she’s not talking to him, and for the first time since he’s come back, he smiles at the mechanic. “Look who’s home.”
,” the man all but begs. Tony can’t tear his eyes away, though he feels numb. “I was wrong. I may not have lied, but I wasn’t truthful either. I should have told you. I am—I was your friend, and I kept something so important for you. I can’t—I should have—I’m
When they pull away, Tony’s eyes are red rimmed but he hasn’t cried yet. Steve grabs hold of his hand again, and runs a soothing thumb over the back of it. Tony looks down at the movement for a second before he takes another fortifying breath. “And then when that was all over, I didn’t say anything when you decided to bring her back. I saw the way you protected her, so I just—I didn’t say anything, but let’s just say that there was more than one reason I went back to Manhattan with Pepper,” he’s avoiding Steve’s eyes as though he’s ashamed.
there are about ten suites. There is one with each of their name’s, he heaves out a sigh of relief when he sees his is next to Bucky’s, and are color coded. He doesn’t know what to see about his, with its black background and blocky white letters and while everyone else’s are labeled by their code names his simply says
“Fuck your sorries,” Tony says heatedly. Steve gives a pathetic little nod, and though he’s trying to turn away from him, the brunette still catches sight of the single tear that rolls down his perfect cheek. He takes a breath that shutters in his chest, and it’s clear that he’s trying his best to keep himself in check, but he still doesn’t try very hard to break Tony’s hold.
“He’s gone,” Vision tells him quietly, wincing as his wound pulls. Steve goes very, very still at his words. His fury must be clear on his face, though, because Vision’s complexion goes a tad paler, something Steve didn’t even know was possible. “We saw the news before we were attacked. It—they said he was missing.”
Finding the Starks’ lost takes him a while. The place is big, and there are twists and turns, and long stretches of dilapidated headstones. He forces himself not to read them, irrationally afraid that he might know some of them, and pushes forward on his quest. At some point, he finds a groundskeeper to ask for directions. The old gentleman stares at him with narrow eyes, but eventually points him in the right direction. Maybe he gets a lot of tourists. Smart men and ladies who like him for his inventions, maybe even swear in their name the way Tony does with Tesla, or the curious masses who liked that he was handsome and elegant and probably didn’t care about his brain.
“I know,” Steve murmurs into his hair. “I still want to, though. So, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. I realized that I’ve been… stuck, still after all this time. I don’t want to make the same mistakes I’ve been making since I woke up, so I think… I think I need to stop. For a while.”
“Prevent what?” Steve asked quietly, his fingers ached a little with how hard Tony was gripping them, but he managed to give a supportive squeeze back.
,” Tony narrows his eyes at the monarch. Sneaky little shit. The others, thankfully, had never known much of what he did outside of the Avengers. The only ones, that he is one hundred percent sure, who had read his file were Tasha and the Captain. “For the time being I believe it will suffice for you to know that he is safe, in the process of starting his therapy and his process with the BARF, and is expected to make sufficient recovery.”
“Oh, shit!” he hears from behind him. There’s a giggle that is quickly suppressed, and a groan. He’s pretty sure the groan was Steve’s.
“What’s this about community service?” yet another voice says from behind them, and Tony turns around to see almost the whole gang making their way towards them. Danielle is giving Harley a stern look, and the boy tries to not look too guilty.
He clears his throat and levels what he hopes is a friendly smile at the other man. “Go on,” he tells him and watches the surprise on
Steve won’t admit it later, hates the very thought that it ever entered his mind, but he thinks about letting him go. He thinks that maybe Tony has had enough of heartbreak and even if he had said all of that in that interview, maybe he has stopped being maudlin and has decided to try again with someone new. Steve thinks maybe he should let him go, but the most pervasive thought in his mind is

Because he was looking for a place to sit, and not at Barton, he was able to see the stormy look on Rogers’s face. For a second he thought he would be berated yet again. That now that Rogers had everything he wanted at his fingertips he would lay onto Tony and they would get the screaming match they were overdue in. so he was surprised when the Captain, he would never be anything else, got up to his feet and leveled a reproachful look over Tony’s shoulder.
“The last time I did that, you decided it meant you never had to leave the workshop again and pulled an eighty four hour binge
on the other position of authority, Tony can feel his gaze on him. Natasha occupies the other side, staring impassively at the Wakandan monarch and her hands resting primly on the table. Tony notices Barton throwing suspicious looks at the tome on her left, but she ignores him. Rhodey sandwiches Tony and then there’s an empty space between him and Viz.
is the only thought in his head. Though he’s standing tall, a power Steve always knew he would grow into exuding from him, there are lines around his mouth and, when he takes his sunglasses off as though he can’t believe his eyes, around his eyes as well. Even there, though, across the expanse space, his eyes are unmistakable.
Tony shoved him away, weakly because he was shaking so bad, and tried to glare through the tears. God, he was exhausted. Yet he couldn’t
Steve is chuckling softly next to him, but when Tony turns to look at him there is sadness in his eyes. His hand is closer to Tony’s than it had been, and though the mechanic is happy about their proximity, there’s still something inside him that is screaming for him to get away. To put as much distance between himself and the soldier lest he get hurt again. He vehemently tells that part to shut up, but where he would have gotten closer before to see where the boundaries are, now he just makes a show of scratching his nose before replacing his hand on the grass, away from the soldier’s. He doesn’t miss the way Steve fists at the grass. He swallows hard and looks away.
Life after that is… pandemonium, to put it bluntly. There are law suits and investigations and accusations and all sorts of legalese Tony can barely keep up with. Through everything, Rhodey proves to be a rock. After that first UN meeting, which is later on dubbed D-Day for Destruction Day, Rhodey makes it his mission to be with Tony at all times. His exoskeleton is working as well as it should, he says, and he’s made leaps and bounds with his therapy. He’s ready to kick ass, he convinces Tony who honestly didn’t fight it very much. He’s feeling the strain of it, every day, and had been wishing for some sort of respite from it all.
Yes, Tony Stark is fucking human and he can be angry, and hurt and goddamn terrified! Christ, Clint, I am not a fucking robot. She got into my head and she
“Um, speaking of loyal--?” a voice behind him asks and Tony feels his chest seize up. Usually he’s one to play the dramatics just for funsies, but this time it’s actually true. The voice sends his chest into contractions that are probably not good for his health but what the
Tony kept quiet and allowed himself time to process what had been said to him. Two apologies, which sounded utterly sincere no less, in one day seemed to be overwhelming his brain completely. He didn’t know how to deal with these many emotions in a good day, let alone when he was this tired. He decided that, seeing as Lang had nowhere to go, he might as well try to get on the right side of the man. If Tony was to continue to live on the compound, he would need to make things right with its occupants if he wanted to stop avoiding everyone.
“She was my godmother,” Tony says quietly, reverently, like a secret kept close to his heart. Which is exactly how he’s maintained it until now. Peggy was one of the few things that he had ever truly kept as
came back. They’re barely readjusting as is. It just seems like the polite thing to do, waiting for a bit before I start another war,” DUM-E beeps angrily at him and uses his claw to pull at Tony’s hair in admonishment. The mechanic glares at him and waves him off.
“All the bullshit about keeping things from the team. All the anger you had, and look at you. Tony,” Tasha says and she sounds pained. “Tony, look at me,” she grabs a hold of his hand and he doesn’t have a choice but to look at her. Her eyes shine. “I’m so sorry. I should have told you. I should have let you know as soon as we dumped those files. I’m sorry I failed you. I thought
“No, babbo, no,” Peter says, and he’s crying again. Grabbing tightly to Tony’s chest as the man drags him back into a hug. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, dad.”
and—” Steve feels himself getting worked up into a state. His breathing in picking up and the angry tears are welling up in his eyes.
,” he said desperately. “Of all the things I’ve done the biggest regret I have is leaving you in that bunker.”
“Yeah, I figured. She’s been trying to socialize me,” tony says with an easy grin. It’s kind of hard to hate the man when he’s staring at Tony like he’s quaking on the inside, and the mechanic has been caring for his daughter for the past few months. Truth be told, Tony figured the two of them could have been friends once upon a time.
“And what would those big threats be?” T’Challa asks, and for a moment Tony is surprised before he remembers that the young king hadn’t been around for that particular fuck up. Sometimes it feels like the young man has been around since the beginning of their ragtag team.
Steve doesn’t answer her, he focuses on breathing evenly, and eventually she leaves him to his thoughts. It’ not until he’s alone, surrounded by Tony’s paused hologram and the picture of those they have lost that he allows himself to think the truth.
, and himself is too great and he has lost communication. He can’t, though, he cannot do that to his child. At the very least, he needs Peter to know that he loves them. At the very least, Peter will be able to give Morgan his love and all the kisses Tony is going to miss. He’d already had to override Karen so that the suit disengaged the parachute and took his child home and he doesn’t think he’s able to have another goodbye.
“I think it should be you,” the king says as they face one another across the holographic table in Tony’s office at the New Avengers Compound.
“Captain Rogers,” a painfully familiar voice tells him as he approaches a previously unexplored hallway. “You have been made aware of the restrictions to your access. I know my—
“It’s fine,” he says and surprises himself with how steady his voice is. “Anything I didn’t want you to see would be off limits to you. FRIDAY would have let you know, and if you didn’t listen, well,” he says with a smile. He can’t quiet keep the dangerous edge off it, and feels the tension spike in the others. He can’t even say he’s sorry.
Yet he did, because he could never leave it alone, because there was too much to do and too little of himself left to do it. Because there was a boy, a child, with trembling fingers and big brown eyes looking down at him in fear. Because when Tony reached out the kid,
“Yes,” Rogers said easily. He ignored the room’s sudden tension and cast them a serious glance. “I think it’s about time we discussed some things.” He met Tony’s eyes when he said his next point. “I believe this talk is long overdue, and most of it is my fault. Hindsight is twenty twenty, as they say, and it’s something we should have done a long time ago. It’s time we fix things, like we were meant to, as a team.”
“What. Did. You. Just. Say?” he asks his son careful; at his back, he can feel the Cloak stand taller and lean closer against his side. It’s a testament to how much of an idiot his son is that even a sentient piece of cloth can sense what Tony is thinking.
“Hey whoa, whoa,” Steve says as she gains momentum. He is horrified to realize that the AI had thought he was
“Hey, are you home? I have news.” A pause, and Tony’s smile threatens to split his face. “The best.”
, he may have overshared. He scrubs a hand over his face. “Ultron was supposed to keep the earth safe from big threats.”
“Steve? Did you hear what I said?” It’s only when Natasha speaks that he realizes he has been staring at an empty bowl for the last few minutes. From the corner of his eye he can see Sam sitting up on the couch and throwing a concerned glance their way. Steve waves an arm at him and goes to the cupboard to get some cereal.
“Morgan,” he breathes against her soft hair. The baby his arms makes an inquisitive noise but doesn’t pull again. She just snuffles against his neck and sighs happily.
“Don’t,” Tony says raggedly. He feels a phantom pain in his chest, and he rubs at the annoyance. It’s been happening enough lately to bring him a twinge of concern, but he doesn’t have time at the moment. The fight for the Accords and the others and especially Barnes’s freedom is still not won. He doesn’t have the
“Sergeant Barnes is in a secure location north of this compound. I was made aware that there was a property there that was… available. He won’t be disturbed and will be in comfort to make a speedy recovery. The owner of the property was gracious enough to let us borrow his home,” Tony pretends he doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about.
But he was awake and breathing and trying to function. Because he had a kid that came by almost every day, rode the subway because he didn’t want to inconvenience Mr. Hogan or overstay his welcome. He had a kid that touched him comfort even when Tony’s anxiety was making him act like a lunatic. He had a kid who babbled and laughed and sang just as loud as Tony did when he was in the zone. He had a kid at home who ate cold pizza and watched television upside down and cuddled with DUM-E for naps and fell asleep more often than not with his head on Tony’s shoulder.
“Looking pretty good, though there’s a bit of slobbering. Also, there seems to be an ouchie of some kind,” FRIDAY relays and Tony has her do the proper scans to make sure everything is in place. Once everything seems to be in order, the mechanic shuts down his station and makes his way to welcome his new guests home. He checks that the accommodations are ready, and takes a fortifying breath.
Again, Steve had tried to follow, but Sam was quick to grab his arm and yank him back. If he’d done it with a little too much force, neither one of them had commented.
He’d been so ready for a fight. Had talked himself up thinking that he needed to get everything he had off his chest and that he had to be ready to fight Stark if need be. He had expected the other man to give as good as he got; to yell insults and accusations and well-placed jabs that hit just a little bit too close to home. It was, what he thought, what was to be expected from Tony Stark. It’s what usually happened when the genius and the captain went after each other.
“I don’t know how,” Tony says truthfully, and Steve loses the battle. He grabs hold of the shorter man and pulls him to his chest and grips tight. He doesn’t know how he’ll ever manage to let go. He doesn’t really want to.
“Hmm,” she said with a raised eyebrow. “So you have no idea why my children and Cassie came yelling ‘to the general!’ into the kitchen?” Tony burst out laughing before he could help it, and she shook her head at him though she looked fond more than anything.
,” he spits the word out like a curse. “I thought I needed to finish the program as quickly as I could, and damn the rest.”
time he’d gone out in a half-assed trip to look for his best friend while leaving his family behind.
Howard had… loved Maria, in his own way. One could even argue that he had worshipped her; her kindness and her subtle intelligence. Where he was harsh and unyielding in his ideas, she was soft and persuasive. While he’d been ruled by what he thought was reason, even when it wasn’t, she had balanced that with empathy. He’d admired, and perhaps even envied, her kindness. For that reason, he’d often caved in what he considered her “frivolities.”
Viz has stationed himself at the door, and Tasha gives Tony an amused glance that lets him know he’s not the only one that has noticed the android’s attention. His smile quickly falls when he hears the others making their way towards them. T’Challa’s soothing voice seems to put him at ease a bit, but he still got quickly to his feet.
Steve yanks him into a fierce hug, his whole frame shaking, as the puzzle finally falls into place. He had been so angry during the Ultron thing. He had thought and called Tony the worst things, and yet—and yet here the man was, years later, shaking from the fear of the things that he had seen. From the things he thought he was responsible for.
The first, and in the grand scheme of things it might seem trivial but it wasn’t really, not for a boy like him: Peter Quill.
“did you forget I live with the woman?!” Harley says in an affronted tone. “and what about you, anyway?”
and closes his eyes. For a second, a single horrible second, he wants to pretend he never heard it. He wants to let the distance between home,
“Anyway!” Harley says and leans forward in his seat. He squints his eyes at Tony. “Peter texted me,” he begins ominously. Tony groans. “No, no, no, now you gotta listen to me. Why didn’t you tell me?”
