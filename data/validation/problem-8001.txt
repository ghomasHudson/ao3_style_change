“You don’t
Tony bumps him with a shoulder. “Jerk.”
Tony sits up and folds his legs in front of him. He tilts his head to the side, considering, and one long, grease-stained tendon stands out in his throat. Steve swallows, watches a bead of sweat slide down and settle in the hollow at the base there. His mouth flattens into a thin line.
“Jesus,” Rhodey says, eyebrows raising. “This is…not what we need right now.”
Steve’s fingers tighten painfully in his skin for a half-second before he remembers himself. He pulls them apart enough to stare into Tony’s eyes, his gaze sharp and pained. “I wouldn’t,” he insists.
The first thing Steve had done when he found out Tony was amenable to what he previously had thought was an unrequited love was show him precisely how good he was at sucking cock. He doesn’t disappoint now. It takes Steve a moment to adjust to the size and shape of it, but then his tongue slips inside, rubbing along the ridges that line the underside of the ligula, and Tony moans like he’s being paid to. His spine bows with it, and Steve groans around the tentacle in his mouth. Sparks fly behind Tony’s closed eyes: a feedback loop of pleasure.
Folding himself down into the static inside his own mind is easier every time. He closes his eyes and lets himself drift, riding the sparkling current like he’s blazing down the highway on a motorcycle, so fast the land flying by him blurs together. When he comes to, sleepy and disoriented, he finds himself in the middle of a standoff. On one side, Strange floats, arms folded across his chest, mouth twisted into a moue. On the other, Tony stands in that way he has when he knows he is going to lose but refuses to fold, his shoulders broad and proud. Between them is Spiderman, leaning aggressively into Strange’s space.
, gorgeous, warn a guy before you throw down like that.”
Loki nods, decisively. “This, I can do,” he says. “In exchange, speak with your captain.”
Steve leaned down, taking his mouth in a slow, claiming kiss. “Go on.”
than I could ever even look at. Duty free. You know, Dr. Cho can put away more than I thought. She’s so small. But damn, can the Koreans party.”
Tony laughs, scratching at his stomach and wandering over to his closet. “Yeah, hot cocoa away.”
“I’m fine,” he said.
christ but they're few
Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
Just once, Tony would love to get called out into the suit for something fun. Maybe he could fight a terrible and hilarious supervillain on par with the Brothers Grimm. Something like The Human Top, who would just spin around smashing stuff until Tony took him out by tangling him in string. Or even a dragon. He wore enough armour for that, surely.
“Hey,” Steve says, and Tony blinks. Right. He’s still on the phone. Steve’s back, dressed in a plain SHIELD-issue t-shirt and sweatpants. He’s sitting cross-legged on his bed, his hair all rumpled. He’s so cute. “I can probably come out there tomorrow, but I can’t leave now. I have some things I need to take care of here first.”
“You almost couldn’t believe it.”
He didn’t know if it made him selfish or brave.
“Oh,” Steve gasps, and Tony smiles. He presses a kiss to the inside of Steve’s thigh.
“How dare you,” Pepper sniffs. “I have always done everything Tony has needed me to do. If that means running his company while he plays martyr, then that’s what I’ll do. But I have never enjoyed it, and I will never be what this version of Tony needs.” She sighs, a self-deprecating sort of sound. It makes the skin on Steve’s arms stand on end. “I fell in love with the beautiful, damaged genius who was selfish enough to look out for himself, not the borderline-suicidal vigilante adrenaline junkie who wants to kill himself to save every crying child. I would have made that man into the king of the world.”
Tony looks away, and Steve watches the motion of his throat as he swallows. He tilts his head back to look at the starless sky.
“Can’t I just want to give back? I’ve always said that the Memorial Park should get more use than SI employees eating lunch and tourists camped out with telephoto lenses trying to get a glimpse of The Avengers. It’ll liven up the place! Bring in children and nerdy college kids. And hipsters who like meteor showers.” He pauses, considering. “And, actually, probably some astrology nuts who wanna see Scorpio or whatever and wear crystals aligned with their chakras, but hey, fuck those people.”
Steve blinks. “This Miyazaki guy sure has some imagination.” He takes a bite of the duck stew. It’s good; salty, and savoury, and perfect for a rainy day. “Okay.”
“Stark. Tell me what it is that has you rushing off to do ‘damage control,’ as you call it. Especially after I had you so nicely wound up.”
“Are you saying she bewitched Steve with her tits?” Clint snickers, stepping out of the elevator. “Also, since when is Loki protecting Tony’s shiny metal ass?”
, he thinks.
“Do you think you can handle having that many alphas walking through here?”
“Because I’ve got you. So hit me, come on.”
“Steve?”
,” Steve gasped, his entire body locking up, and
“Nothing yet,” Steve says, and Tony’s stomach turns to lead. Steve glances away, then back at Tony. “If you wanted me to come-”
When he comes back to earth, Steve is lying on top of him, his head pillowed on his arms as he stares at Tony’s face. His face is right in front of the nano-housing, and lit from below he looks even more gaunt than usual. The past year has been hard on all of them, and Tony fits his thumb to the indent of Steve’s occipital above his right cheekbone, tracing the purpling flesh below his eye with a single, firm stroke.
“Yes,” Thor says. “In many ways, I find it humorous that he thinks our parents are not truly his family. He is more like them than myself, most days.”
almost forgot the warnings, oops!
“I don’t think he can go too far from me,” Tony says, clearly having decided to…well, Steve might say give up the ghost, if he was feeling at all inclined towards humour. It was the kind of joke that would leave Tony groaning. “I feel a tug. Sort of like I’ve forgotten something important. I can’t explain it.”
In some ways, it’s easier to talk to Shuri than anyone else, Tony finds over the next 24 hours. There’s no real history between them for her to be upset or startled about Tony not remembering. They’ve only been casual friends for the year since The Decimation—they’d already bonded over the mathematical inaccuracy of that term, and how much they hate it—and so in some ways, Tony is still new to her.
“More like Dinch. Oof, that’s bad, Linner?” Tony wrinkles his nose. “Why is there no good portmanteau for this meal?”
, but God, did he want to know. With his luck, Loki would just disappear in one of his blinding golden flashes again.
,” Tony babbled, but he’d stopped trying to pull Steve off of his cock, so that was alright, then.
“My apologies.”
Steve shudders all over, shaking his head to clear away the fantasy.
Steve nudges at him, lips at him. He speaks against Tony’s mouth. “Me, too.”
“Please try not to piss off the entire senate this time.”
Still, he likes the quiet this side of the morning. The city never sleeps, sure, but the bars were open 'til four. The work hour traffic just barely began at six, didn't truly set in until seven. Five was the perfect midpoint, that space where the city took a moment to yawn, maybe, stretching and covering her mouth politely before settling down at a desk, getting on a train, hailing a cab. Fifth Avenue was surprisingly quiet, the high end shops opening later in the morning to cater to a crowd that preferred brunch to breakfast. The museums were not yet open to be clogged with well-dressed natives and camera-toting tourists. Early rising was for blue collars, and blue collar Fifth Avenue was not. The only workers he ever saw were the ones opening restaurants, cleaning windows, washing streets. It's why he usually preferred to run down the East River or Riverside Drive, at least until he got to the park. But Fifth was nothing if not heavily surveilled.
He is acutely aware of the fact that his position mirrors Thor’s.
“You’re really here,” he says, blinking up at Tony. There’s a burn mark scraped across one cheekbone, and Tony reaches out, pressing a thumb against the unmarked skin beneath it.
“If you don’t take care of yourself, we’ll never know, now will we?” Beth asks.
“I dunno,” Jamie Gaughan from Marketing says, looking a little conflicted. He’s actually Irish from Ireland, and speaks a handful of Gaelic, which Tony finds pretty hot honestly. That’s probably problematic, or something, so he isn’t going to say anything about it. Pepper looks like she knows, anyway. “Isn’t that…trading on stereotypes?”
“Yes,” JARVIS says simply, and Steve nods, rubbing a hand over his mouth. “Sir demanded that you not be disturbed, considering the ordeal you’ve suffered. Clearly you needed the rest.”
That had been in early October, before the Halloween party where Tony dressed up as Sexy Captain America; they barely lasted an hour before Steve had to do something about the only-partially-sexual urge to drag him up to the penthouse and take the costume apart with his teeth. Steve wasn’t so good about managing his attraction to Tony, but in his defence, Tony was a terrible enabler. The point being, he’d been far too distracted by Tony’s…everything, and now it was almost time. The holiday party was next week, and Steve was just now cottoning on to the fact that his mind had played a terrible trick on him. Where before he’d been fine with the idea, used to Tony flirting with people at parties and taking beautiful friends and business associates on ambiguously intimate outings to help maintain a façade of professional camaraderie and healthy male friendship between them, now he wasn’t so sure. They’d gone to enough parties, restaurants, and shows together that the papers had dubbed them “NYC’s FAV BROTP” and “SuperBros.” Steve had seen little hug-and-fly salt and pepper shakers that magnetise in the windows of the tourist traps that line Times Square, alongside little flying-on-a-string Thor machines, and wall-climbing Spiderman toys.
He keeps on walking, right up until he steps off the edge.
“He’s in full fugue now, I think, after the Captain’s little speech,” Riri said, and her voice was disapproving if Steve had ever heard it. Great, now he was being chastised for his sentimentality by a fifteen-year-old kidnapping victim. “I had to gag him, but we’re all good here. Just waiting on you, Doc.”
The absolute farce of the situation does not elude anyone in the room. Even Tony cracks a small smile.
“You put Talenti in the freezer.”
“What the hell is he talking about, destroy the pack bonds?” Clint demanded, anger disguising what was clearly fear. Steve would bet money he’d be able to smell it if not for the scent blockers he and Natasha always wore.
“Let’s go,” Tony says, stone faced, and Steve bites back a growl of frustration. He waves his hands in front of Stephen’s face, then through him when he doesn’t react. “Clearly we’re wasting our time here.”
Tony wakes up with tacky morning breath in his mouth, bleariness overtaking the anodyne of sleep. A quiet alarm is sounding, and he sits up in bed to see the hulking planes of Steve’s shoulders bunching under thin cotton. He’s reaching for the bedside table, and Tony’s chest splits open with a dizzying spill of embarrassment, desire, and relief at the memory of last night. Everything’s out in the open and no one tried to kill anyone else. Steve kissed him. They cuddled. It was…nice.
. We can direct the team. Anyway, I thought you guys were superheroes. You killed kind of a lot of people.”
There was no one out and about, everyone smartly bundled into their own homes in anticipation of the blizzard. The snow was already hard to walk in, and Tony wasn’t sure if he’d be able to find the jailhouse again. He tied a rope to the hitch to be safe, looping the coil around his arm as he walked Flower back to the rental stable. Pym was checking on his animals when he walked in, and his brows disappeared into his hair as he took in the sorry sight of Tony and the horse.
so strong that he could feel his heart kick up in his chest. His fingers fumbled at the hem of his t-shirt, pulling it up and tossing it onto their bed. Next his slacks, his hands trembling as he folded them carefully, lining up the hems. He hung them up in the closet, then stepped into the heat room in nothing but a pair of briefs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t know, omega, you seem pretty fucking desperate,” Tony teased, coming up behind him and taking a firm handful of Steve’s ass. “Get on the bed.”
“He should know better.”
, Tony thinks.
Tony’s heat lasts four whole days. It’s his longest, most miserable heat since childhood.
“That’s not an answer,” Tony sings, and Maria sighs.
“This is your first Christmas without Barnes,” Tony said, and then was horrified at himself. He wouldn’t have said it if he was a little steadier, and Rogers’ hands tightened on his hip and wrist painfully. “I- I’m sorry, I didn’t mean-”
“How much longer?”
It had been a surprise for everyone to find out that Clint was a pretty decent baker. Less so that Steve and Bruce could cook, or that Thor was excellent at a good meat roast if you gave him a fire to cook over, but Tony had expected something a little more bloody, from Clint. He’d expected something involving knives. In retrospect, the precision and fuss that baking required suited Clint in ways that Tony couldn’t really quantify. It spoke to his patience, his exacting nature. It also helped to calm him down when he was in a rough spot.
The barest flicker of movement from Loki, and his mouth stops moving. His entire body is frozen to the spot.
“She said that she didn’t care about the greater good,” he blurts, and the professor raises an eyebrow at him. “I know, right?”
“What do you mean?” Steve asks, and Pepper tilts her head to the side. Her long hair slides in a burnished waterfall over one slim shoulder.
Happy has nothing to say to that.
, meaning eight, and
Tony. Oh, Tony. Tony’s warm hand wrapped around his throat, trying to stem the bleeding. Tony shaking, fumbling for his phone, running back to pull it out of his suit jacket while Steve puts his hands on his own throat, trying to keep the pressure.
“No. God,
“It will be hard,” Clint said, glancing at Natasha, “for both omega and alpha biology to try to fight a bond like that. Especially if you’re using your pheromones, Cap. On top of that, you’re family. You’re pack.”
Tony lets out a rough hiss of breath, pulling his fingers out and slicking himself up. Steve watches him with dark eyes, quietly ravenous, and Tony spares him a single kiss to his jaw before he presses inside.
“I think it’s Hydra,” Bruce said, and Steve let out blue streak that would have made his mother wash his mouth out with soap. “I can’t confirm it yet, but the SUVs have led to a shell corporation with offices in a town in Georgia that was linked to an unconfirmed Hydra sighting last May. It’s incredibly thin, but that’s all we’ve got right now.”
“Oh, I want something,” Loki rumbles, leaning in, and Tony can feel that voice all throughout his chest. His pulse is tripping fast, and he’s sure that Loki can feel it. He slides his tongue out to graze the pad of Loki’s thumb, tasting salt and ice, and Loki’s eyes flutter before he snaps, pressing his body into Tony’s and pinning him against the counter, mouth sucking at Tony’s abraded lower lip, tonguing at the bloody cut. A low sound rumbles out of him, and Tony shivers and swallows it, sliding one hand between trousers and tunic to slip his fingers along Loki’s spine, the other gripping his hip. He lets Loki lick into his mouth hungrily, sucking on his tongue and making him squirm in Tony’s arms. The coppery taste of his own blood lingers, overlaid with cold and pine forest winters. Loki keeps one thumb on the sensitive corner of Tony’s mouth, pressing there, dragging his mouth open as he claims it. Tony leans in, kisses him deeper.
“Hooooly fuck,” Tony breathes, because that’s. That’s.
The heat and the friction is incredible. Steve is clenching down tight, gasping, breathless. Wet hair falls into his face as he fixes his hands on either side of Tony, clenched fists resting on the tub because he’s afraid of hurting Tony or breaking something. His whole body is trembling. He’s beautiful.
Steve doesn’t think he wants to know what UST is. He straightens up, pulling his hands away, and Tony offers him the coffee mug wordlessly, but Steve shakes his head. He takes a cookie out of the packaging and pops it into his mouth instead.
“Only for you, sir.”
The smile that Steve levels him with is indulgent, drowsy. His hair is a lopsided mess, soft spikes of dark gold in the low light. Steve runs a hand through it as he watches, and Tony wants so badly to settle back into the curve of his neck and stay there forever. Steve’s Brooklyn brogue is thick as molasses in his soft, smiling mouth. He feels more real than he’s ever felt before, touchable and sweetly tender.
“I love you,” Tony called, and Steve took a sharp breath, holding the memory of the words inside of him. “Steve.”
“I signed up to be an Avenger, and this isn’t even the weirdest thing I’ve seen,” Steve says with good enough humour. He peels his gloves off one by one and leaves them on a worktop. “Anyway, it’s not like you asked for this.”
“I can take care of Strucker, if he becomes a problem,” Tony says easily, waving a hand. “God, what a name. He sounds like a sandwich. He’s just a human scientist, right?”
Some notes, for those who are curious: I imagine that Steve would be an ardent supporter of omega rights activism and incredibly interested in historical accounts of omegas rebelling against traditional societal ideals of what a “good omega” should be. Thus, everything I have listed here comes from real-life history of female combatants. If anyone has any further interest in these topics, please hit me up! I’m happy to chat about them and provide plenty more. (And before anyone asks: being interested in fulfilling traditional gender roles is not at all in conflict with feminist principles imo. Steve is a complex character, here; on the one hand, as Captain America, he flies in the face of everything an omega traditionally is supposed to be. But it also makes sense to me that, as someone who was probably never wanted or thought of as desirable when he was pre-serum, he’d want to get that experience in his personal life.)
“I was so dirty, and it was our first time having each other. I was so embarrassed. I hadn’t washed. I hadn’t shaved-”
“That’s no fair, reading me so easily,” Tony pouts, just to watch Loki laugh. “I’m very clever and unpredictable.”
“Nope,” Clint says, and Tony rolls his eyes up towards the ceiling.
“Tell me about the bond, again,” Thor said, and Steve closed his eyes and breathed out smoke, watched it curl up into the sky and vanish. The nicotine settled over him like a heavy blanket, potent for his going so long without touching the stuff.
“No, you aren’t,” Bruce retorts, but he straightens enough to pull out of Tony’s grasp. “This is going to end so badly.”
Then he turns, and runs straight through the closest window.
Steve blinks at him, bemused. “Well, of course not. They’re just kids trying to live their lives,” he says, laughing a little. “I’m not sure I see what you’re getting at, Professor.”
“That’s not a question, it’s an order,” Tony said, but he was taking the ring from the box and sliding it on his finger. “You’re always so bossy.”
He reaches out and cups Tony’s face in his hand.
“Fuck! Avengers, Amora-”
“Take a picture, last longer,” Steve sasses him. The retort is somewhat defeated by the fact that he’s so deep under that he can barely form words, but Tony considers it. He leans over Steve and reaches for his belt pouch, fingers fumbling in the pocket where he knows Steve keeps his phone.
"Nothing, J?"
His orgasm blindsided him, surging up and over his body, arching his spine, whiting out his vision until Steve couldn’t breathe. His fingers scrabbled at the pillows above him, one hand leaving what were sure to be a set of nasty nail marks and bruises over Tony’s shoulders. Tony was murmuring in his ear, invectives and sweet nothings and filthy praise that made him hot, and it felt like forever until the roaring in his ears died enough to parse them.
“I didn’t do anything at all this time,” Tony protested, and Steve couldn’t help but lean in and kiss that stunning grin of his. “You didn’t let me.”
“May I?” Loki asks, and Tony clears his throat.
“I think you must love your soulmate very much, to have come here and sought penance for hurting his heart.”
“I’m familiar,” Tony deadpans, and Rhodey snorts.
“You know, I didn’t see it before,” Bruce says, mouth quirking, “but you have the same grin.”
Steve presses a slow, open-mouthed kiss to the side of Tony’s neck, hot enough to send his pulse skittering. “Liked the taste I got.”
A warm hand braces against the back of his neck, Steve’s thumb coasting over the knob of his spine. It’s enough to make his eyelashes flutter, and it comes in strange contrast to the bated anger he can feel rolling off of Steve’s body in waves.
“I’m going to have to ask you to leave,” Pepper interrupts smoothly, and Tony shakes his head a little and leans against the elevator doorway. Steve can’t see him, but Pepper spares him a searching glance. Her expression doesn’t change.
“Right,” Tony said flatly, and Steve winced.
He’s standing outside of Rogers’ door at midnight because Shuri had kicked him out, telling him that if this was a temporary result of a traumatic brain injury, then he needed to sleep and recover. And he’d tried, really. He’d really tried, but he couldn’t stop thinking about what she’d said, the way Rogers had looked when Bruce had told him to leave.
Tony rolls his eyes, but his shoulders slump a little. The tenseness in his body leaks out, and Steve wishes he could clap a hand to Tony’s shoulder. Cheer him up even just a little. “Thanks, Poppa Cage.”
Steve nods. He’s pretty sure the professor’s figured him out, but it’s better to preserve his sanity if he’s able to pretend that he doesn’t know. “She’d rather he wasn’t a superhero.”
“Edibles, sir?”
“I will.”
“See? I’m fine. You’re not fine, but that was literally my point, so-”
She steps back, pulling the door with her until she holds it open with a flat, challenging look. It makes Steve want to do something drastic: anything, to break the clean, modern lines of this office, the silent swing of the heavy black doors, the way Pepper’s heels make no sound on the perfectly plush white carpet that leads from the door to her desk like a runway. He spares a tight smile for Ms. Bliss as he passes her desk, stepping inside and standing in the middle of the room. Pepper closes the door behind him, and her shoulders brush his as she passes by him, seating herself at the desk.
alive, the kid’s got that much right. I’m sure the Sorcerer Supreme can fix this. No harm, no foul, okay?”
“Endearments are a privilege earned,” Loki agrees, inclining his head. “You are Stark’s general. I would expect no less.”
Loki’s moan when he begins to move is delicious. Tony slides his hands over his chest, playing with his nipples, squirming when Loki’s hands press into his hips, pull him down deep every single time. When Loki’s breath begins to grow unsteady, Tony bends down and takes his mouth, both of them moaning into the kiss at the change in angle. He shivers when Loki drags his fingers up Tony’s spine, pulling him close and rolling them again.
“I’m yours, Captain. So please. Take what you want from me, curse or no curse.”
Jess laughs. “Try another line, Cap.”
“It’s normal for mates to have strong reactions when they meet,” Bruce says patiently. “He had no idea what he was feeling, Tony. He’s been through a trauma. Give the man a break.”
Natasha fights like she’s dying. The Black Widow’s eyes are wild in her face, confusion and fear flickering over her in turns. She’d tried to get to Tony first, but Steve had stepped neatly between them, and told Tony to put on the suit. A small joke, one which might have brought levity to any other situation. Not this one. There is nothing funny about this.
Tony smiles, just a small half-quirk of his mouth.
“The germs burn off in the heat anyway.”
“Who said anything about showering?” Tony grinned wolfishly. “Oh no, I don’t have time to shower.”
“Steve-” Tony says, but Steve can’t wait. He watches the elevator doors close on Tony’s furrowed brows, the sweet bow of his mouth under his moustache, his beautiful doe-brown eyes.
“I don’t know when Loki will be back,” Tony says, fingers flexing on the table, and Steve reaches out to twine his together with them. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I want to talk to him, before we do anything else.”
“Morning,” Luke grunts, dabbing ineffectually at the banana juice splattered across his chest.
“Fine,” Tony grits out, and reaches for a spanner. This is going to end poorly; he can already tell.
“People do strange things, in their grief,” she says. She speaks as though she knows well, from experience. He supposes that in the past year, most of the world would know well enough. “He lost both of his best friends, old and new. You lost your fiancé and your protégé. It makes sense.”
Tony’s throat vaporlocks. For a moment he can’t even breathe, and the two of them just stare at each other, shock quickly turning into desperate need.
“Hey, easy tiger. I left you in there so you wouldn’t bolt. Or sock me. Again.” Cap freezes, turning to stare at him with wide eyes, a fathomless blue with pinprick pupils. One of the machines behind Tony lets out a sparking shower of flames, and he ducks and glances back at it. Cap doesn’t even flinch. “We’re getting you out of here, okay buddy?”
“Are Loki and Thor…aligned, again?”
Tony gapes at him. “We are not.”
“I need to fuck you,” he says, and Tony smiles. He spreads his legs.
“Not like-! I meant, literally,” he says, waving a hand, but the professor just chuckles.
“So, Captain, how do you feel?”
“You really, really wanted a drink,” Steve says, and Tony sketches out something that barely resembles a laugh.
Steve waits until five days after their breakup to call Tony.
“Alpha,” he murmured, tipping his head back and to the side to offer his bondmark to his mate. Tony mouthed over it gently, tongue flicking out for a quick taste and a hum of pleasure that made Steve shiver. He tilted his head to the side even further, a low, pleased rumble building in his throat.
“That’s better,” the priest says cheerfully. “It seems like you’re struggling with something, son.”
“Not longer than me,” Tony says, sharper than he’d like, and Steve freezes. “Fuck, sorry. I’m…” He takes a deep breath. “You know me. No coffee, no filter.”
“Are you- God, are you
Steve takes the offered device, glancing between it and her. Pepper doesn’t wait for an answer, instead moving to throw open the double wide doors and step through into the conference room.
“Yeah, thank you for that, Sassmonster,” Tony says, but he feels a little better. JARVIS is pretty good at that. “Do you think anyone noticed?”
Rogers didn’t answer, head lolling easy in the crook of Tony’s neck. Tony let out a heavy breath, his hand tightening around the man’s middle.
The fireplace is burning, which Tony finds amusing because it’s forty-eight degrees outside tonight. Loki’s feet are bare, toes curling in, tucked almost underneath himself as he contorts his body around a book. He doesn’t look up at Tony’s entrance. After a few seconds’ consideration Tony shakes his head at himself and starts towards the bedroom to change into something more comfortable.
Steve watched in horror as two nondescript SUVs pulled up to the curb, a team of men in black tactical gear and masks pouring out. Their guns were immediately trained on the group of students behind Tony, a smart move if he had to admit it. After a tense moment, Tony began to strip, beginning with the cuffs to call the armour, then moving to his coat, his suit jacket, his shoes, his pants, his shirt. He handed his belongings to one of the students, a young black woman who looked as though she would kill the men if she had half the chance. When he was left standing on the street in his boxer briefs, visibly shivering from cold in Cambridge in November, one of the men moved to hit him, clearly displeased. Before he could manage it, the woman holding Tony’s clothes lunged for the man, knocking his feet out from underneath him and breaking his nose with a swift thrust from the base of her palm. One of the other men shot her in the arm, and the girl crumpled to the ground. Next to her Tony was shouting, hands up and out as though he could protect the students behind him with his half-naked body. He pulled his com out of his ear and tossed it on the ground, then pulled off his watch.
“Charmer,” he accuses, but there’s no heat in it. “And you say I’m the romantic.”
“Pause,” Tony says, and Steve stiffens beside him. “Do you want to know why I’m annoyed, there?”
“Please do not keep secrets from your captain.”
“You’re always impertinent,” Steve said, and then he was standing, scooping Tony into his arms and spinning him in a circle to raucous applause, pressing kisses all over his face as he squirmed in Steve’s grip. “Well?”
“Yeah?” Steve says, caught halfway between bashfulness and what is clearly smug, alpha-male posturing. He settles for a smirk paired with a raging hot blush, one that disappears under his neckline.
“Are you going to sit?” she asks, waving to the chairs before her. In answer, Steve holds up the flowers. “I’ll have Ms. Bliss find a vase.”
“God,” Steve says, and Tony laughs.
“I doubt you would trust anyone else to the task, sir,” JARVIS drawls, and Tony squints a glare at Pepper, then the closest security camera, shoving the spoon in his mouth just to be contrary. “The Mark 50 is prepared for deployment whenever you are, sir.”
“What is it?” Steve asks, sounding resigned. “What did I say?”
Steve, disconcertingly, won’t look at him. He fills his plate with pancakes as Tony takes a few pieces of cantaloupe for himself.
cw: explicit sexual content at the end of the chapter. be safe everybody.
There were downsides, to having to wear a disguise if he wanted to hold Tony’s hand in public. When he and Tony went to the theatre, and Tony looked so good that the desire to lean in and press a kiss to the corner of his mouth was so strong it was like a physical need, Steve had been forced to wait until they’d gotten home. He’d taken Tony apart so thoroughly that he hadn’t been able to stand under his own power in the morning, and Steve had carried him to the bath and washed him from head to toe with slow, worshipful strokes, because Tony never let Steve take care of him the way Steve wanted to. Tony deserved that much. He deserved for everyone to know exactly how well he was loved, and how beautiful he was, and that Tony was more than deserving of Captain America’s friendship—
“As opposed to my other organs?” Tony says, wiggling his eyebrows at Steve through the glass reflection. Steve bites down on the inside of his lip. “You don’t like Beth.”
Bruce sighs, but it’s a soft kind of sigh. He reaches up and cards his fingers through Tony’s hair.
“Tony’s pretty confident of his own intelligence,” Steve counters, laughing a little. “But I guess I see what you mean.” He takes a breath. “You make it sound like we’re really hard on our friends.”
“I want you,” Steve says, trying for seductive. His hair is wild from thrashing against the pillows, eyes narrowed in frustration. He looks delicious, and not very submissive at all. Tony laughs at him.
“Charm me, why don’t you?”
He says it easily, considering it’s the first time he’s said as much to anyone since his run in with Strange. But his relationship with Reed has always been mystifying to Steve. Reed understands parts of Tony that no one else on Earth ever will.
“Good,” Steve said, and he was grinning so hard his cheeks hurt.
“Did you miss that?” he asks, and Loki scowls and looks away. “Where are you dropping us?”
“I…” Tony tries, then stops, not sure how to explain himself, or if he even should. He had no idea what Loki’s plan was, or if Amora could somehow hear him the same way Loki can. He didn’t understand the mechanics of the protections that Loki had wreathed around him. He’s flying blind.
“Steve, Loki knows exactly what our relationship is, trust me. I should talk to him, but he definitely knows the gist of it.” He takes a breath, drawing back slow enough that Steve could stop him if he wanted. Steve lets him go, watching him stopper the decanter and place it back where it belongs. He watches Tony take another sip of his drink. “You could.”
“It’s okay,” Tony tells him, but Steve isn’t listening. He’s packing their dishes back onto the tray, tension tight in his shoulders. “Steve, it’s okay.”
“Sir, yes, sir,” Grace says seriously, offering him a salute. Joyce just rolls her eyes, a small smile pulling at the corners of her mouth.
“I love you,” Tony says. He sucks in a shaky breath. He feels, strangely, like crying. Thoughts he can’t voice buzz around his head like moths to a porch light.
One day, Steve looks across a metal worktop at Tony, sleepy and barefoot and shirtless and covered in machine oil, the outline of an Allen key imprinted on his cheek, and Steve says, "Oh." Then he fills one of Tony's enormous black mugs with black coffee, and hands it over with a smile, because that's life for Steve these days; always changing, always new, always painful.
“Shh, you don’t get to talk. You tried to weaponise the Hulk – my friend, by the way – and ended up breaking Harlem.”
Steve makes a sound like he’s been shot—Tony would know, he’s heard both—and then leans in, taking Tony’s mouth like he’s sieging an AIM base. His tongue drags filthy over Tony’s upper lip, flicking over the corner of his mouth before dipping inside and curling slow against Tony’s. Steve kisses like he’s starving and Tony is blessed ambrosia, like Tony’s the best thing he’s ever tasted, a low moan rumbling through his broad barrel of a chest and into Tony’s. Tony does his best to give as good as he’s getting, but Steve just wrenches away with a wet sound that goes straight to Tony’s cock and gathers his wrists in one hand, jerking the sash off and holding it against Tony’s wrists.
“Should I have slept elsewhere?” Loki asks, voice rough, and Tony blinks at him, not sure he knows the answer to that question himself. “I assumed-…well.”
“Hey,” Tony says, perhaps a little sharper than he’d like, and Steve stops, nostrils flaring. “I’ll give you a pass because you’re upset, but don’t infantilise me, Cap. I know a bad touch when I feel it.”
Not Steve, or even the other Avengers, but Tony himself. It takes
, Tony admits to himself, sinking deep into his self-deprecation. Still, this is worse than he’d imagined.
Tony breaks from the cloud cover, dropping down to skim along the bottom of the cloud. He can see the early morning fishing vessels heading out, dark ships on black water, even the very edges of the horizon not even hinting at the sunrise due in an hour. The city of Lagos looms before them, bright spires and glittering reflections rippling along the vast expanse of black.
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that, but he relaxes a little when Loki’s mouth drifts down further, tongue dipping into his navel and making him squirm ticklish. He can feel the smile against his hip before he bites, and Tony hisses, pushing up into it when Loki soothes the pain with his tongue. He drags his mouth down, licking the crease of Tony’s thigh and making him squirm, sucking hot kisses against his inner thigh. Tony digs his fingers into Loki’s hair.
“Your body needs to recover more for that.” Tony offered him another spoon of gelato, and Steve opened his mouth, swirling his tongue over the metal just to see Tony’s eyes dilate. “Probably pretty soon after, though.”
E X P L A I N, Steve taps, because he doesn’t think Tony will stand still long enough to let him get out all the questions he wants to ask.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s already afternoon when a coffee mug appears at his elbow, smelling strongly of good espresso. He hadn’t heard her come in, but then, that was the way of it when Natasha Romanov didn’t want to be heard.
The day of the parade dawns bright and early, and Tony stares across the fields of green with a headache burgeoning strong behind his eyes. The sound is indescribable, echoing fiercely over the brisk city streets in a discordant cacophony of noise that’s hell on his nerves.
Beth’s always been observant and stubborn, though. If she wasn’t, she wouldn’t have been able to drag Tony out of the bottle, kicking and screaming the whole way. As inconvenient as it makes his life sometimes, Tony will always love her for that, sure as the way he loves Pep or Rhodey or Happy. It’s why he hired her for Avengers’ security in the first place.
Steve goes over to him, bumps his shoulder through his friend’s. “Ah, come on, Shellhead,” he says. His voice wavers, echoing against the sterile metal walls. “You know it’s probably temporary.”
“You’re a grandstanding asshole and you like an audience. Bonus if that audience can actually track your crazy, see a method to the madness or call you out on your shit. Then the fun is trying to outwit them.”
Tony can’t keep his eyes open, but he doesn’t need to: the sight of Steve wrapped up in him is burned on his retinas. He’s going to remember this in vivid colour for the rest of his life. His climax takes him in a slow surge, waves of it, much longer than a human orgasm. His whole body tightens up, muscles clenching, and he can feel himself coming: endlessly, pumping again and again and again inside Steve’s hot, tight body. Steve’s moaning for it, his hole clenching in tandem, but he finishes much earlier than Tony. He can’t stop, waves of it crashing over him, building in intensity until Tony’s sobbing with pleasure, his face buried into the back of Steve’s ear, mouthing blindly at the skin there. Steve’s speaking, but Tony can’t parse language, and they stay like that for what feels like forever: Steve, pliant and trembling in Tony’s arms, his body a hot coal in contrast to the tepid water lapping at their ribs.
“Maybe,” Tony allowed. “Wouldn’t mind spending the time here.”
“What’s that?”
The only things of personal import on his desk are the old arc reactor Pepper had engraved for him and a photo of him and Rhodey from their graduation at MIT. The rest of it is just blueprints and crap.
Steve thinks.
"I think I do, too," Tony agrees, and that gets him a lovely coral blush. "Fuck, you're
Tony feels like he's in college all over again.
“God, I hate the Pentagon. At least SHIELD played it cool. All the beige is so depressing.”
“Tony,” Pepper says evenly, “why are you here flirting with the head of the Amateur Astrologers’ Association and not holed up in your workshop or buried in some horrifying biotech project with Peter?”
“Bribery!” he crows, taking the cup in his hands. “This has been an ominous start to the morning, indeed. What did you guys do? Did Bruce Hulk out and break something big? Have Thor’s rooms become uninhabitable by NYCHA standards again?” Natasha offers him the tiniest of smiles, but says nothing, and Tony sits down at the head of the table across from Thor, because why the fuck not.
“You can be late. You’re always late,” Steve groaned, shifting his hips a little when Tony began to thrust. “Alpha, please, it’s been days since you claimed me-”
I know a lot about resources in my state, and my city, but I also know most of my readers are all over the place, and a lot of y’all are in Europe. I don’t know anything about trans resources for Europe, so I’m sorry about that. But NCTE is accessible anywhere?? Anyway, if any of you have questions, please feel free to ask. I’ll do my best. (;＾◇＾;)ゝ
“Actually, I think I’ll walk,” Tony says, and Stephen nods. He turns back to his pile of books, slipping the next one in between its companions. “See you ‘round, Sparkles.”
“Look at you, being responsible,” Steve teases, and Tony just-
He calls for Steve in a low voice, waits for his touch. He tips his face up like a flower when Steve leans in to kiss him gently. They haven’t talked, still, but Steve knows better than anyone how Tony squirrels away the more delicate parts of himself. And he’s selfish, in the end. He’s wanted this for so, so long. He doesn’t remember what it’s like not to want this. Most astounding of all, he can have it. He can have whatever he wants.
“I think it’s chicken,” Steve said, but did as he was told. Bruce had spent a long time living in Hindu communities, and generally avoided beef when possible. “Yeah, it’s chicken.”
“Oh God,” Steve says. He turns around, his face flaming. “Ohh. No, no no no.”
“Wait, hang on,” Steve says, but Pepper is having none of it. She gathers her things into her purse.
He takes a sip of coffee as he assesses the shifty expressions on his teammates’ faces. “Am I fired?”
Eventually, Tony stops sleeping in his bed entirely. He shuts himself into his workshop. Steve learns to only touch him when Tony begs for it—when he comes, slinking and guilty like a scolded pet, and murmurs Steve’s name into the night like an invocation.
He comes for a long time, and when he’s done, he slumps forward entirely into Tony’s hold, boneless. He’s still shaking, shivers all over his body, and he whines and squirms at the realisation that Tony is still deep inside of him, thrusting slow and languid.
“Loki being Odin, Loki wanting to…something, Loki hitting on me…” Tony hesitates, fingers strung between a biometrics and radiation side-by-side. “Cap, being all…Cap.”
“That line was old when I was young,” Steve says, rolling his eyes. Tony grins like he knows exactly what Steve said. Maybe he does. It makes the kiss awkward, filled with too many teeth, but Steve revels in it anyway. He presses close, rumbles a low groan when Tony gets a hand up into his hair. He pulls Tony flush up against his body.
He makes easy small talk with Evan on the ride back to the tower. He’s only 22, which is sobering considering his rank. Steve isn’t sure how long it takes to become a Senior Airman these days, but it’s probably long enough that Evan joined up right out of high school. He knows, of course, that sometimes the military is still the only avenue for social mobility a young person who comes from nothing’s got. But it’s frustrating, how little the state of social welfare has progressed since he went into the ice. He’d hoped for so many things from the future when he was young, and flying cars was the least of them. Sometimes, on his worst days, Steve thinks that not even a single thing from the future meets his expectations.
“I’ve done harder things,” Tony says fiercely, and Bruce tilts his head to meet his gaze. His eyes are sad behind the thick lenses of his glasses.
“I can, too,” Tony counters, indignant. “Just because you’ll heal doesn’t mean I can’t hurt you. Relax, Steve.”
,” he admonishes, “didn’t you talk to anybody?”
He glances at the screen, but it’s presently just a blank split view in preparation for Tony and Jim’s respective views from the helmets. Steve wishes Tony had told him about it beforehand, because frankly, he wishes he didn’t have the screen. He wants to be there, to find out who had done this to him and beat them with his own two fists. He does not want to watch from afar, a powerless victim with no recourse for action beyond waiting. It’s enough to make fury writhe in his gut like centipede.
“Anything,” Tony promises recklessly. “Let me shower, and you can have me however you want. As many times as you want. Steve-!”
“You, too.”
, getting a result for “calamari” instead, and, well… it’s become a Tony wants a drink kind of day, which is never a good place for him to be.
“I’m not going anywhere.”
, Steve tries to send through the burgeoning bond that’s forming in his chest. He feels like he’s going to burn up from the inside out.
“No,” Steve says, pulling back, and Tony’s chest tightens. He’d been hoping to avoid a fight so soon after Steve was back. Maybe he should have waited until tomorrow. “You’re right.”
Tony opens his mouth to protest, but Steve stops him with a single finger on Tony’s lips. He props his head on his hand, resting his weight on his elbow so he’s sprawled half over Tony. His free hand traces the planes of Tony’s face, lingering at the corners of his eyes, the lines framing his mouth.
“Stark is his own kind of archetype.”
“Tony, stop,” he grates out, but of course, Tony can’t hear him. Instead, Steve stumbles to his feet, trailing along behind Tony like a lurching zombie while the world spins dizzily around him. He is absurdly glad that he doesn’t really have a stomach to empty.
“Men touched each other a lot more before World War II,” Tony continues, because Steve is in hell.
“Typically,” Strange says, not looking up from his work, “this spell requires something of great importance to the deceased. We do not have a material object that matches that description, so I had to create one.”
Steve’s mouth drops open. His eyes flicker to Tony’s wrist, then back up to his face. He steps a little closer. “You mean…”
“It’s okay,” Tony says quickly. He shrugs. “This is perfect, actually. You do…whatever you’ve gotta do for SHIELD. I have six million things to take care of at the SI campus. The plan was to slowly transition to a bicoastal operation—NY for business, Cali for production. There’s a lot left to do, Pepper’s been driving me crazy, so. This is great. It all works out.” He’s babbling, he knows, but this wasn’t part of the plan. This is so far from the fucking plan. Tony’s a futurist, but he couldn’t have imagined this outcome. He feels so
Tony smiles against his skin.
Amora lights him up, flame and lightning crackling around the suit, crashing back down on him in controlled waves like it’s trying to find a way in, a way past whatever protections Loki had afforded him. Tony screams, vision going dark as the heat sears into his shin, blindingly painful and spreading. He fires on instinct, hitting Amora in the stomach, and the pain cuts out for a brief, merciful second.
Tony never shows up for movie night.
“No,” he says, quietly. “But make the usual inquiries, see if anyone really needs the money. Ask Denham first. His partner needed top surgery last time I saw him, and he’ll give you a straight answer about how everyone’s doing.”
“Joining me?” Tony asks, surprised.
poems. His poetry seems like the kind of thing Steve would read and then think of Tony and have ~~feels~~ about, so that's my headcanon. Also stars/Steve/Tony are a whole fanon thing I think. Tony as a star, the reactor as a star, Steve wearing a star, the star on the shield, etc. etc. etc.. Seemed fitting.
Steve grimaces. He squats, putting himself a little lower than Tony so he can look up into his face. He rests his palms over the fat base of two tentacles, then seems to get distracted, running his hands up and down the slick surface. His thumb slips around to gently ghost over one sucker, then proves bolder, pressing against it until it clings to the wide pad of his thumb. Steve exhales, soft and surprised. Interest quirks one dark blonde eyebrow down into a curious furrow.
Tony snorts. “I’ll be lucky if I’m alive in ten,” he retorts, and Steve startles and looks up at him through his lashes, brows furrowing.
Steve’s jaw is so tight Tony can see the veins against his skin. “You’re too drunk to fly. You don’t know what you’re saying.”
“Spiderman?” Tony repeats, baffled. “Why?”
Tony watches him curiously, waiting. Loki is on the verge of some great secret, he can tell. The real reason, maybe, that he’s done...everything, really.  It’s not the first time they’ve skirted around it, but it seems harder for him to contain in these moments; when he seems more vulnerable, more open to Tony’s touch and word. “You’ve earned some trust,” Tony says, slowly. “Why does it matter to you what I tell Steve?”
“The wine-dark sea,” he murmurs. “We lucked out on the cloud cover.”
And that’s…unfortunately, the answer he should have been predicting. He shakes his head. “Yeah, it is,” he says. He swings a leg over his bike, adjusting the kick stand. “You know where to find us. And I’m here every Friday, for now.”
“With the unibeam?” Rhodey demands, incredulous. Then he laughs. “You’re a lunatic.”
“No, thanks for taking me on at all,” Steve says, shaking his head. “I know you’re busy.” He clears his throat. “I’m, uh. I know you sent documentation saying there was nothing wrong with me, but how long do you think we’ll be having these appointments for?”
“I am 100% serious, hand to motherboard.”
Tony blinks at Loki, then looks at Bruce. “Who?”
“Alright,” Steve says. It sounds less like acceptance than a ceasefire, but that’s how it is between them. It’s what Tony expects, more than anything else. “Wanna get cleaned up, or sleep?”
Clint raises a hand, a long-suffering expression on his face. “He says you’re a pain in his ass, and Loki can’t be seen by anyone, so he better use some magic mumbo jumbo or something if he’s gonna help us. Which I would like to file an objection to. Again.”
Tony swallows thickly. The curse sounds strange in Loki's mouth, formal and dirty all at once. He looks like he knows it, too.
“Wish we could’ve Sight Bonded,” Tony murmurs sleepily. He presses his face into Bruce’s shoulder. “Smell nice.”
“You should,” Pepper says, folding her hands together across her desk. “You know, a lot of people have a fundamental misconception of Tony and I’s relationship.”
“Well, it has a happy ending,” Tony says, the words dirty in his mouth, and Steve can’t help but tighten his fingers on Tony’s hip.
“You will not!” Thor snarls, only to be stopped by the mysterious appearance of an uncomfortably familiar gag. He doesn’t even bother to fight with it, just glares murderously at an indifferent Loki.
Steve flinches, eyes skittering away before tracing back to him, equal parts furious and hesitant. “I don’t…that wasn’t about sex, Tony. I-” He cuts himself off, unhappy, and Tony reaches out, pressing a thumb to the corner of Steve’s mouth. Steve looks like he’s about to bolt, but Tony can’t blame him. They’ve been working up to this for a while now, two neutron stars on a degrading orbit. The crash will be nothing if not spectacular.
“I don’t know,” Natasha says, “I feel like the last scene changes things for me. Doesn’t the last line-”
“JARVIS doesn’t have a body to throw in front of a stray spell.”
Tony closes his eyes, letting her fuss over him. For a half second, Pepper loves him and Steve is disappointed that he isn’t Howard. Everything is simple. He does not yet care for the intricacies and politics of Norse gods. Steve tells him to put on the suit, and he wants nothing more than to break his perfect teeth. He wants to see that golden hair smeared with blood.
“Then we talk it out,” Steve says, something between a laugh and a sigh escaping him. He pulls away and offers Tony a wink. “Not that we’ve found anything I don’t like yet. Maybe I like things that are too out there for you, huh? What then?”
,” Steve tells him. His hand hovers over Tony’s shoulder, desperate and ineffectual. “I’m here, Tony. I’m right here.”
Tony is a wreck for most of the rest of the day. He’ll admit it. He’s unfocussed, mind flitting back and forth to all the half-woven threads of his life instead of whatever he’s meant to be doing. He gets maybe two serviceable hours of work on the anti-magic arsenal done, instead checking up on the data decryption on the quarantined Hydra servers, running over improvements to the team’s body armour, fiddling with the designs for the Mark 51. He makes his way back up to the penthouse when JARVIS prompts him, changing into a pale blue Cerruiti, touching up his facial hair, breaking out a pair of alexandrite cufflinks to match his tie.
. That’s.
“You’ve been gone two days,” Tony said, shaking his head. “Dunno how long you were lying in the dirt like a dog, but when Liberty walked into town this morning without you, well. Figured something had gone wrong.”
“You love it when I best you in an argument. You still take it as a sign of your own intelligence.”
It was a weird question, probably. Kind of invasive. But Steve knew Tony, and Tony asked invasive questions all the time. He’d ambushed Steve just last week with a question about his inseam over breakfast, ostensibly for a body armour project. Steve had choked so hard on his eggs that Thor had ended up pounding his back while he coughed over the sink.
Tony circles back around, peeking out from behind another pillar and firing two flares simultaneously at Amora, cementing it with a third missile. The impact rocks her back three feet, but more importantly, the resulting flare of light should be enough to blind her. Tony opens his eyes to a skirling screech, Amora swinging around aimlessly as she shakes her head back and forth. Tony broadcasts a high, wailing alarm specifically calculated to disorient, the sound bouncing back against the hard concrete until the entire place is an echo chamber, deafening and coming from every direction.
Tony doesn’t stir.
“Tired of me already?” the professor asks, and Steve colours.
"I run to stay fit," Steve protests mildly.
Tony knows this, perhaps better than anyone. He rubs at his chest, self-conscious, and ignores Pepper’s steady gaze. “If I push that angle, I can get Ross to look un-American. Like he’s bowing to pressure from outside influence,” Tony hedges, but Pepper shakes her head again.
feel a little bloated. “Wow. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you blush.”
Tony closes his eyes and tries to remember his position in the air, the distance to the ground, the angle of the shot. “Do it,” he says, and when JARVIS’ handling shuts off he lets himself drop.
“We didn’t kill him on American soil,” Loki says glibly, and Tony sucks in a breath. It makes him seem much taller than he is, even from behind.
“That’s not true,” Tony panted. He was lying on his back, exhausted. The ache in his belly was nearly unbearable, but he didn’t quite have the strength to do anything but lie there with the knotting dildo inside of him and pray for relief. “What about that time in Dubai?”
He knows what the professor is going to show him, and it hurts before he even sees it. Tony had flown into a building so thoroughly wrecked that the remaining top two floors were tilted at a 45 degree angle. It had been a school, and while some of the children had been able to be evacuated, some of them had been trapped by broken legs or other injuries, or blocked in by the sheer instability of the building.
“Steve,” Tony says, a nasty suspicion creeping up on him, “did you think SHIELD was holding Barnes?”
“He’s on the West Side Highway, sir. I would estimate he’ll be here in thirty minutes at the most, but I can ask him to hurry.”
Tony pauses with his hand on the knob, eyes fixed on the small crack between the frame and the door. He takes a breath, measuring his next words. “You know, as a pretty good liar myself, I know any good lie has a grain of truth in it. I think your problem is that you’ve forgotten how to measure your own bullshite.”
“You’re supposed to be recovering, not taking care of me,” Tony says easily, putting the soldering iron down. He wipes his hands on a dirty grease rag, which does more harm than good, and Steve holds the sandwich out of reach.
Coulson nods. "Alright. Keep me updated."
“Captain,” JARVIS said, and Steve stilled. JARVIS sounded regretful, but also wary. “I do not think sir has any plans to announce his status to the team, and I do not think he should have to.”
“J, what’s the best way to Cap?”
Stark glanced around the table, rubbing at his mouth with one hand. He looked baffled, but also, maybe, a little proud.
“You amaze me every day, J.”
Tony raises an eyebrow at him, but Thor is still laughing, body shaking with it as he holds his side. He exchanges a glance with Bruce, then Natasha.
Steve smiles at him, wide and beautiful. A hint of satisfaction creeps over his face.
and love and regard. He wanted everyone to know that Tony was his, but more importantly he thought, he was Tony’s.
“Come on, Cap, I’ve barely touched the surface-”
Hello lovelies! Usual warnings: explicit sexual content, drinking, alcohol, ptsd, panic attacks, mentions of some unhealthy alcoholic behaviour but not outright alcoholism?? As always, stay safe/lmk if there's anything else I should add.
“I thought I might go into heat,” he admitted, and Tony hummed.
consent issues ?
“I could not begin to predict, Sir,” JARVIS admits, although he has the grace to sound pitying about it. “This situation is somewhat beyond my parameters. You have never had two serious partners concurrently before.”
“Okay, fuck, I’m sorry. Breathe with me, okay?”
“You didn’t even think it was
“I’ve got a weakness for rare and beautiful, what can I say,” Tony says, eyes dancing. “Why do you think I invited you assholes to live with me?”
“I’ll do it,” Steve heard himself call out, as if from very far away. A few people near him turned around, laughing. There were a few delighted claps, even as some employees looked genuinely put out. “I’m an Avenger.”
Okay, so maybe Steve was a little flushed. He’d blame the wine, but everyone knew that was impossible.
“Since when are you and Bucky best buddies?” Steve asks him. He scrubs a hand over the back of his head, some cousin of jealousy bubbling up in his chest. It’s irrational. Stupid. But it’s what he’s feeling right now, dangerous and unbridled in his chest.
He picks up the coffee, toasts her with it, then swallows it down piping hot. Natasha waits, barely even blinking.
“Miss Potts is in a meeting. I will alert her as soon as she is available.”
“I know we’ve already been dating for years now,” he began, projecting loud enough that Tony’s mic picked up his voice. Gasps and delighted shouts echoed throughout the room, but Steve wasn’t finished. He reached out to brush a gentle thumb over the crinkled corner of Tony’s eye. “So maybe it’s selfish to want to take this one too, but.”
“You could put me to sleep,” Tony offers, and Reed frowns.
Steve sat, blinking in bemusement when Tony knelt on the floor in front of him. He braced his arms over Steve’s thighs, peering up into his face.
“Okay,” he says. He slips an arm under Loki’s, propping him up. “Okay. Let’s go.”
“Gee, thanks, Dr. Obvious. Really needed your expertise for that.”
“Not gonna let me take care of you?” Tony spoke against his mouth, lips catching tantalisingly against Steve’s. His short nails dragged down Steve’s scalp, the nape of his neck, and he shivered in Tony’s arms.
“Give JARVIS the coordinates,” he says, finally. “Let him look it over, see what we can get off the satellite feeds. I want the names and aliases of everyone who’s been working together on this, everything that you can give us. Rhodey and I will pry ourselves out of the armour, do some repairs, and meet back here at 17:00. We can eat and make a plan.”
“Yeah,” Tony says. He nods, just once, for emphasis. “I’m…I know I lash out, to protect myself. It’s a bad habit, and we both know where I get it from. But.” He swallows. “God, I don’t want to be like that. I saw what it did to my mother. I’ll…admit what it did to me, even. So I-… People keep saying you should know better, but I’m older. Or, more experienced.
B E D, he taps onto Tony’s hipbone. It makes Tony shiver in his arms, and Steve presses his smile to the warm, dewy curve of Tony’s neck. R E S T.
“Pepper encouraged it, too,” Tony says, laughing crazily, and Steve raises his eyebrows. After his last talk with Pepper, he can almost believe it. “I don’t know, honestly. Maybe even his? I think he thinks
“Fuck,” Tony said, and Steve chuckled low. Sometimes, he thought this just might be his favourite thing in the world; Tony, weak and panting under him, that beautiful brain of his focussed on Steve and what he could do with his tongue, his lips, his fingers. “I-…”
“Sorry, Shellhead.”
. There will be no petty squabbling of consequence and law when there is nothing but ash, and dust, and blood. More blood than you could ever imagine. More blood than can be borne from the rotting husks of all you have ever held dear, more blood than water is held in the rivers and the lakes of this land, enough to paint the sky red with mourning. When Death is brought to your doorstep––and She will be brought, as She is always brought and carried with Him wherever He does go––Midgard will fall, and Asgard will fall, and all the realms will fall under His hand unless there is a force great enough, united enough, clever enough to stop it. And you cannot be such a force if you are sneering and sniping about petty trifles such as which minder is best suited to manage you like the filth-ridden, squalling babes you truly are. Thus when I ask for something so small as truth and obedience, why then must I lie and trick and seduce for what should be freely given if it is to save your own-” Loki’s breath hitches, the gold flickering out until all that’s left is the green and horror, bright and gasping. His hand tightens painfully on Tony’s jaw. “Your, you-“ He chokes, tries again. “You…golden, beautiful, infuriating, I cannot understand-”
He raises his hand to knock, then drops it again.
“Sorry my apparent amnesia is poorly timed,” Tony deadpans, and Rhodey winces. “Guess Cap and I are cool now? Water under the bridge?”
“You…” Tony laughs, then, helpless and utterly surprised. “
Steve scoffs. “Tony makes selfish decisions all the time-”
A cookie for anyone who noticed the chapter naming rules before this one, which I think is really obvious and sort of ruins the game. Did anyone notice it? I don’t think anyone’s noticed it yet. Thank you so much to everyone who has bookmarked or commented or kudos-ed this story! I really do love feedback, which is why I reply to all the comments I get. Fic is kind of a sandbox for me to train my writing muscles and also work out Big Questions I have about canon all at once, so it’s really delightful when other people vibe with what’s going on in my head. I like to hear what people think about what I’m trying to do with the characters and the world, so please continue to share your thoughts with me. I appreciate it.
Steve pressed Tony’s hand over his heart, letting him feel the way it was trying to beat its way out of his chest. He dipped his head to press his forehead to Tony’s, watching the way Tony’s eyes widened.
Thanks for reading! Sorry it's a little late tonight; I was out of town and have been driving all day.
Tony brings the slender tip of one restraining tentacle up to Steve’s flushed cock. He dips the very tip into his slit, and Steve’s back bows, his mouth open with no sound emerging. He’s a fucking vision. Tony is so, so lucky, he’s just unbelievable-
“The one and only,” he quipped, spurring the horse on. His heart was in his throat. The man had been outside, immobile, for God knew how long in the cold. He pushed Flower to go as fast as she dared in the heavy snow, trusting her to keep on the path and know her way home. He wrapped his hands around Rogers’, tucking them in the space where their thighs nestled together for warmth. He wrapped Miss Jones’ scarf around his neck, too, for extra measure.
“You come home,” she says, and Tony swallows.
“Good,” Xavier says, his voice full of laughter, and Steve blushes.
By the time Steve staggers out of the bathroom and falls into bed, he’s ready to change his name and move to another state. Tony
“Mmm,” Steve hummed, eyes floating shut. “Yours.”
“Is this about Cap?”
“It is special, on Midgard. The bond between Alpha and Omega.”
“I don’t kiss and tell, Mr. Secretary,” he says, tapping the side of his nose. “Now, here’s the real issue.” Tony flips to a blurry image of a hulking figure, silhouetted by a bright burst of light from what he had thought was a relatively impenetrable forcefield. The figure has an axe the size of a car door, and it’s slicing through his tech like butter. “This guy is so powerful even Thor seemed kind of scared of him when he gave me this intel. He’s called The Executioner, because he’s basically unbeatable. He has regenerative powers, and he is Amora’s unquestioning servant because he’s 100% head over tits in love with her. That makes him dangerous, because it means he can’t be turned or bought or persuaded. We’re not even sure if he can be killed.”
I M H E R E, he tells Tony, every night. I M S T I L L H E R E
“Yeah,” he said, turning to offer Thor a weak smile. “I know.”
. Stalk Tony across New York without ever saying a word to him.
Steve took a breath, mouth suddenly dry as parchment. “Yes,” he breathed.
according to your own stupid moral code. You’d be happy if he sacrificed his life to save some stranger when in any given day Tony creates things that advance the human race as a whole, improve quality of life, save thousands-”
“No, listen to me,” Tony says, blinking as a terrible suspicion comes over him. He turns, leaning across the bar to face Steve fully. “I didn’t say anything because I thought you already knew. But Nat was with you through the whole Potomac Crash. She didn’t once ask if you were okay, or how you were feeling about this? She didn’t once bring it up to you? That doesn’t make any
“What do you want from me?”
,” he sobbed, and Tony raised his head, wet mouth red and obscene and open as he panted. His eyes were almost entirely black pupil.
“I was the catalyst. And now he’s coming after you.” Her façade of calm is beginning to crack now, voice slipping into high panic, and Tony reaches out and catches her shaking hands.
“I’m security, boss,” Bethany Cabe, Head of Avengers Security, says cheerfully. “Not my division.”
“Natasha-”
“It’s not your fault,” Tony tells him. “You did your best. But statistically, the universe had to be wrong at least once. Makes sense that it was me. Starks defy the laws of the universe. That’s what we do. ‘S who I am. This isn’t your fault, Steve, okay?”
Thor takes his arm, firmly manoeuvring him to sit on the couch. “Mind your feet on the edges,” he tells Tony, but Tony’s not listening to him at all. He’s still captivated by Ulrich, who’s gesticulating firmly in a way that Tony knows means he’s used to holding a cigarette when he speaks like this.
Hill smiles wryly, nodding again. “You’re familiar with Doctor Charles Xavier. He’s done this kind of work before, and is the most proficient telepath in the world to our knowledge. He also has a Ph.D. and M.D. in psychology. I can reach out on your behalf. SHIELD has a good professional relationship with the professor.”
They walked in companionable silence for a few moments, peeking into the open windows of their neighbours to see set tables, small gifts, candles.
And you can have my heart
“Go ahead,” Tony encourages him, and Steve takes Tony’s wrist in his hands and gently, ever so sweetly, rubs his cheek against the scenting gland there. He’s shaking, still, the tension in his muscles vibrating like a plucked string. His expression could best be described as tortured.
all over again. Steve curled up against his chest and tried unsuccessfully to stop himself from grinning. “I know they say saying it during sex doesn’t count, but-”
“The Kusshi was a little much for me, but you’ll probably love it,” Pepper says, pointing. Tony takes her at her word, closes his eyes, hums. “I thought so.”
"Cheating," Steve says mildly, walking around the table. Tony pushes away from the workbench to stare up at him, and Steve rests one hip against the worktop and breathes in the scent of hot metal and oil and sweat. "Why didn't you tell anyone about Loki?"
“Of course the girls know something’s up,” Tony mutters. “Fuck. Call Strange again?”
Tony shrugs. He hadn’t really been thinking about it, honestly, which is probably a bad sign. It means he trusts Loki to take care of him. The elevator doors open, and Tony follows Bruce into the lab, Bruce’s nervousness increasing as he walks up to one of the glass screens. He turns around and folds his arms across his chest.
He wants Tony to be his. After all the years of waiting, all he wants is to clutch Tony to his chest and keep him there, warm and safe and loved desperately, achingly.
“Thanks, J.” Tony rocks back and forth on his feet for a moment, tapping on the arc reactor.
“Why Doctor Banner, I don’t know what you’re implying,” Tony says, pressing a hand to his chest.
Tony sighs. He kicks off from the pavement and rises into the sky, higher, higher. He looks down at Manhattan below him and tries not to remember the glow of the portal, the endless gleaming dark of space.
Tony wakes to the smell of coffee, his mouth cotton dry and tasting like smoke. He’s greasy, singlet so stained with various oils and solvents that the fabric is dry and scratchy on his skin. He doesn’t move for a while, just breathing and listening to the sound of the coffee machine. When he hears a familiar clink and the sound of someone pouring, he scrubs the sand out of his eyes and stares up at the ceiling. A mug appears in his line of sight.
“You’re
“That’ll be all, Miss Potts.”
There was a long silence, and eventually Steve nodded to himself and began the trek towards the entrance to the complex. They hadn’t passed Bruce, but the whole thing was a maze. He’d probably taken a different route.
“JARVIS tells me this isn’t what I think it is,” Steve says hoarsely, and Tony glances at the closest security camera. He’s sure his gratefulness is naked on his face. “But no matter how I look at it, it doesn’t quite look like that’s true. Is it?”
"Mental fitness is important. Aren't you a VA counsellor?"
Tony woke slowly, a heavy arm draped over his waist, breath tickling the back of his neck. It was a little chilly, the fire in the stove banked a bit, but here beneath the covers it was warm and easy. The low light of morning peeked through the windows, but it was early yet.
“How are you feeling?” he asks, unable to help himself. Natasha’s mouth twists into a small smile as she heads towards the bar.
For a moment they both stood there, awkward proximity between them, before Tony turned around. They were close enough that he could see the gold flecks ringing the sheriff’s pupils, small enough that they were lost in the blue from any distance. His eyelashes were longer than Tony remembered, and Tony wet his lips and reached up, running a gentle thumb over Rogers’ fluttering eyelid, feeling the barely-there brush of them against his fingers.
“I say that we know for a fact that Hydra used millions of dollars of the defence budget meant for SHIELD––and we’re talking money that comes from the American taxpayers here––to try to shoot down American citizens in their homes. Almost 716,000 Americans. Including the president! And we’re not just talking spies and government spooks serving as double agents. Congressmen were in on this.
“Take off your shirt.” Bruce tugs gently on Tony’s hem for emphasis, and Tony rises off the table just enough to let Bruce peel his ratty Soundgarden t-shirt off of him and toss it to the side. “Where’s it hurt most? Besides your lower back.”
He drums his fingers on the worktop, staring sightlessly down at the drawing. Steve’s trying his best. Tony knows he is. It’s not Steve’s fault he can’t stand Tony. Tony’s hard to get along with. He’s a lot. He’s always known this. He’d just…hoped Steve would be different. But it didn’t matter. He’s always known the soulmates thing was bullshit. Now he has proof: no matter how compatible their pheromones are, they just can;t get along. And that's fine. That was normal, even. People do that all the time. Hell, his parents had done that. Maria and Howard had absolutely nothing in common. They’d married for status, and money, and the promise of healthy children. So what if Tony doesn’t want any of those things? Steve’s polite. He’s stunningly handsome. The sex will probably be…perfunctory, and missionary, but Tony can probably deal. Steve’s not hard to look at. It’ll be fine. Fairness is for kindergarten and fairy tales. Tony's a big boy. He can step up.
“No,” he said, but he didn’t sound sure, even to himself. Tony studied him, an inscrutable frown on his face. "I don't know. Not...not consciously."
“And it’s good to have that pool of data to draw from, but for now this is how we’re doing it.”
“Stark, what would you have had us do?” Coulson says, voice weary. There are bags under his eyes, blue and sunken. Tony idly wonders when was the last time someone gave him a hug. “Pleasant Hill predates Project Insight. SHIELD is stretched thin as it is. We had no alternative facility to house them in.”
Steve wrenches his mouth away from Tony’s hand with violence, eyes glittering wetly. “That isn’t fair, Tony! You gave me no choice-”
"Tony?" Steve says, hesitantly now, and Tony lifts his head to look at him. He looks a little bashful, now. All that fire, and he'd been stoppering it up. He'd smothered it because of Tony.
“I’m kinda surprised Cap didn’t try to fish Barnes out of NIA custody,” Rhodey muses. “I know you’ve been too busy to concentrate on Cap’s old army buddy, but damn. That’s kinda cold.”
? The Bronx?"
Tony must have convinced Maria to set up a screen in the room where Steve’s body is being kept. He knows this because about half an hour into waiting, an Agent Katri comes in and does so, a vaguely perturbed expression on her face. She sweeps dark hair back from her eyes, a long, aquiline nose leading her face as she peers around the room like a bloodhound.
“He’s always fought me.” Steve tips his head up and grins the grin that he knows Tony calls blinding. “It’s part of what we like about each other.”
“No one does that anymore!”
Tony yawns, then swings his legs over the side of the bed. “Library,” he decides. “I don’t want to be overheard.”
“Yes,” Steve found himself saying, instead of any of that. He did not say:
“I could kill you,” Loki says incredulously, hips stuttering. Tony smiles his filthiest smile.
Eventually, he’s able to scrape together enough strength to swing his legs over the side of the lounge chair. He scrubs his hands over his face, wipes away whatever wetness lingers at the corners of his puffy eyes. He takes a deep, trembling breath.
“Didn’t he? He couldn’t stay under all that,” Xavier says, gesturing expansively at the collapsed building. “He couldn’t get out by himself. Doesn’t that mean he needed to be saved?”
Tony smiles a little, thin and weary. He shrugs, his excitement folding back up into himself like he’s packing his emotions away in a box.
F O R G I V E Y O U R S E L F
(yes, again lol)
“They’ve agreed on the formation of international sanctions. King T’chaka of Wakanda was one of the primary forces behind the vote, and he will be on the committee they are amassing to determine the parameters. He seems stern but fair, sir, but I cannot say the same for all of the members of the committee. The U.S. Ambassador assigned to the committee is Henry Peter Gyrich.”
“Three AM baking! I love three AM baking, you always go all out.”
,” he says, with emphasis. The word is drawn out nearly into three syllables. “
“I’m going to hell,” Tony moans, and Steve frowns at him.
“Oh my god,” Tony says, appalled, and Steve flinches.
Tony didn’t think Steve would want to touch him like this, and he’s briefly overwhelmed. The kiss is mostly chaste, warm and sweet, and it’s over before Tony can manage to do anything fancy. Steve doesn’t seem to mind. Instead he just grins wider, his eyes crinkling at the corners in that way that makes Tony want to kiss them.
– E. E. Cummings, “Untitled” or alternatively “#33”
Gently, he uncurls his tentacle from around Steve’s sac. Steve makes a punched out sound, his lashes fluttering.
The shocked, strangled sound that Tony makes breaks him out of his fervour. Steve’s eyes open, his heart thundering in his chest as he comes back to himself, and in the interim he loses his ability to touch. His hands are no longer touching Tony. He’s once again anchorless, unable to reach him, and this time it truly breaks his heart. He can feel the ache of it below his breastbone, and he closes his eyes and lets out a stream of curses that he’s glad no one can hear.
He spreads his legs wide, wrists crossed over his head, and a shiver runs through him at the low growl Loki releases, drinking in the sight of him. Tony tilts his hips invitingly, and Loki wraps one hand around his cock and bends him nearly in half with the other, casual strength pushing Tony’s thigh up so he can lick at the sensitive patch of skin behind Tony’s balls. Tony groans, startled, then gasps at the first cool touch of Loki’s fingers to his arse.
Tony inhales sharply. Both cursing and using real names in the field are generally against Cap’s rulebook.
“Why are you apologising?” Tony asks, baffled, but Steve shakes his head.
“Dirty,” Tony manages, and Steve grins. It’s unacceptably boyish considering the circumstances, and Tony knows he’s in trouble when he can still think that Steve’s adorable in a situation as mind-numbingly hot as this one.
“Oh, beloved,” Tony murmurs. He rubs Steve’s shoulders. “I’m so sorry. Fuck, I’m so sorry, Steve-“
“I’d tell you the same thing, but I don’t think it’d do much to help you,” Tony says. He flexes his fingers, wincing as Widow catches Clint in the jaw with her metatarsus, soundly dislocating it. She’s fighting for keeps, dancing out of the range of Steve’s hands and trying to keep Clint between them.
“Let me finish this, and then we’ll see,” he says. He turns back to the tablet, wrapping a hand over his mouth. He doesn’t get far before his phone begins to buzz in his pocket.
“No. God,
“It’s gone,” Peter says, after a few tense moments. Tony lets out a heavy breath. “You think it’s Steve.”
“This isn’t about you,” Steve says hotly, and Tony lets out a frustrated noise.
“Have you ever wanted a body?” Steve asks, considering.
“Likely, yes,” JARVIS says.
Tony picks up the phone and immediately puts it on video.
“Doctor Xavier was Tony’s idea.” Hill smirks a little, although not unkindly. “He said, ‘Captain America deserves the best’ and ‘Professor X’ is uniquely qualified for the job.”
“I don’t think so,” Tony says impatiently. “Look, I’m headed home, but.” He hesitates, awkward. He claps a hand to Peter’s shoulder. “Thanks for trying.”
As soon as the elevator doors open, the acrid stench of upset alpha floods the tiny chamber. There’s something wrong with it; it’s chemical, tinged with something noxious. The closest Steve’s ever smelled to how the Hulk smells is people who are sick with cancer and going through chemotherapy. But he supposes this is what Tony meant, when he’d implied that Bruce is intersex, too. Bruce is an omega. Hulk is alpha rage personified. His scent alone is almost enough to bring the average man to his knees.
“Illegal druuuugs,” Tony sings at him, and Bruce snorts.
“I don’t understand,” Steve says, but he's smiling a little. He squeezes Tony's hand.
"Well I just thought, with the compliments and the picking me up-" Pepper narrows her eyes at him. "Who said that to you?"
“Let’s go,” Stephen prompts, opening a portal, and Tony sucks in a slow breath. He lets it out in a rush.
“Stubborn brat.”
“Talk to me, Tony. What’s got you all twisted up?”
Steve’s jaw works a few times, and for a moment Tony thinks he might decide to be stubborn. Then he sighs, and pushes himself up. He pulls the mail over his head and drops it to the floor with a tinkling clunk, so that he’s standing there in just the bottom of his Cap uniform and a plain white t-shirt. Half-dressed, with his hair sticking up in sweat-damp golden spikes, he looks, unfortunately, edible. Tony’s eyes travel over the slight strip of skin where the shirt has ridden up, licks his lips at the hint of cut muscle he sees there. He imagines a line of perfectly round pink bruises marching over Steve’s skin, and the image makes him shudder from the top of his head all the way to the tips of his tentacles.
“Can we start without you?” Tony calls, still squirming in Steve’s grasp.
. That he’s trying to be more…modern, or radical, or whatever. He thinks maybe Tony would want to hear what he’s learning. And then, maybe, when Tony trusts him not to be such a brute, they could talk about what kind of relationship Tony wants them to have. And maybe, next time Tony has a…a heat…
This series finally got steamy! Briefly. Solo. Look, whatever, it's a slow burn okay? T___T;
“Of course, Captain.”
I am a terrible monster but nothing is abandoned, I promise. I was just dealing with some personal stuff/trying to finish uni and fic was the last thing on my mind. But hey, I’m a graduate! ^A^’’
“Mm.” The arm around his waist tightened. “Going somewhere?”
Xavier studies him, an unreadable expression on his face. Steve taps his fingers on the arm of the chair once, twice, then glances back out the window. His thoughts aren’t safe in this room. He focusses on the slow wave of the trees as they shift and sway in the breeze.
. Months and months and
Steve must pass out, because the next thing he knows Tony’s sliding into bed next to him. The room is dark, just the glow from the midtown lights coming up from below through the plate glass windows. He can’t make out Tony’s expression in the dark, but he lifts his arm, inviting Tony closer. Tony ducks into his side, and Steve shuffles him up until his head is nestled on Steve’s chest, his arm splayed low on the smooth plane of Tony’s lower back.
. Worse than the idea that half of the population of every living thing in the universe was gone, including Pepper, and Happy, and Peter, who apparently he’d become even closer to before the kid died in his arms.
[tangential author rant] It feels (to me) like there's this weird phenomenon where everyone in fandom thinks Tony and Reed don't get along which...? Isn't canon....??? Unless you're writing Ults, of course. Is that where that comes from? Natasha is also a horrific fucking person in Ults and I don't see the same thing happening with her, although I guess we have the MCU to have balanced that out. In my MCU fics I generally leave Reed out because there's no crossover, but in comics they are like...best buds. Where does that come from? I'm not the only one seeing that, right?
“That’s okay,” Grace says, flapping a hand. “We’ll take care of everything!”
A part of Steve is glad. Steve doesn’t know what would happen if Tony had to fly while Steve was stuck on the ground. Bad things, he’s guessing. He’s imagined Tony stepping into the suit and hitting Mach 4, and being yanked along on the world’s most horrific bungee jump ride. It isn’t something he’s interested in trying out.
“So you
“So, he’s either in one of the shielded rooms, or…”
He’d known, abstractly, that Pepper was Tony’s friend before she was anything else. That was easy enough. He’d just never thought that he and Tony would ever reach a point where the people in their lives would choose sides. Now, he can’t stop thinking about it. He thinks of all the missions he’s run with Natasha, the easy way they move together, like they’ve been fighting side by side all their lives. He thinks about the way her mouth twitches up at the corner in that particular smile she reserves only for Tony, of varying beverages appearing in her hands in anticipation of Tony’s moods and needs, of the way their heads look bowed together in a dark room, the scent of alcohol acrid in the air. He thinks about Clint and Tony’s raucous bickering, fingers flying over buttons as they scream at the television. He thinks of Clint’s steadfast faith in him, unflinching, humbling. Bruce and Rhodes are Tony’s, that’s an easy call, and Sam is his, but Steve doesn’t know what to think of Thor. If Loki is Tony’s, Thor might go with him, too.
Anger flared in Steve like a wildfire at the idea of Tony being bound and gagged, in need of assistance. He wrestled it down with more effort than it probably should have warranted.
He needs to touch up his shave.
“Oh I did enjoy our little game, Stark. But I think I’ve tired of it.”
“I need the thing.”
This is a different man than he’s tasted. This Tony is delightful and impish in turns. He laughs. He gives himself up to pleasure as easy as breathing, as though this is precisely what he was built for. He is shameless. He takes and takes and takes everything Steve wants to give him, opens himself up like the lushest fruit under Steve’s hands and mouth, ripe for the feasting. It’s heady, this power, Tony Stark naked and gasping and so incredibly beautiful under his hands. It makes him greedy. It makes him ravenous. It makes him ache for a body that can lift Tony up and press him into the wall, manhandle him, leave bruises imprinted into his flawless olive skin.
“Never,” he’d said fiercely, and Tony had smiled, bashful and sweet as a dream.
“Buy me dinner first!” he called. “Or, well, I guess let me buy you dinner, huh? Now, Miss Potts, what’s our lucky number?”
Tony opens his mouth, then closes it again, because there’s no way. There is absolutely no way that she’d worked that out.
Steve opens his mouth, not sure what is going to emerge, but Peter holds up a hand to stop him and turns away.
“I have need of you still,” Loki parries, but his voice is soft. He presses a quick kiss to Tony’s lips, then moves to stand, pulling Tony up with him as though he’s made of paper. “Your assassin will become restless, and you have repairs to make.”
“Just so I know what he’s on our shitlist for,” Bruce adds, and Tony looks at him. His face is still placid, and Tony blinks as affection overwhelms him, processing it, letting it pass.
“I have no idea if it’ll feel anything like fucking you usually does,” Tony continues, with affected nonchalance. “Octopodes release spermatophores, which are incredibly sticky packets of spermatozoa. They’re contained capsules, meant to hang out inside the cavity of something called an oviducal gland until a female is ready to use them. Fertilization of the eggs doesn’t happen instantly, the way it does for humans. An octopus can keep some sperm on ice for when she’s feeling like making some babies. Isn’t that nifty?”
“Since Buck died,” Rogers observed, and both men left that where it was. It was true enough, but neither wanted to talk about why. They didn’t talk about Rogers’ own dip into the bottle, the nightmares, the times Tony had been the one to bundle him into bed. It was impossible to take care of someone like that when you were slewed yourself. “I…I didn’t know that. About your parents.” He swallowed. “It’s a hard holiday for the lonely.”
“Oh god,” Steve says, eyelashes fluttering closed, and Tony hums, low and pleased.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” he says. “JARVIS, call the elevator, since the Blue Meanie here clearly has no intention of moving.”
“Do you think people change?” he asks. He turns, studying Ms. Bliss as she stares at him, unperturbed.
"But no, I swear I do not intend to cause harm to you or your people, as you say, nor am I plotting your demise." Loki’s mouth twists into something like regret. It throws Tony off, leaves him unstable. “You have my word.”
“Shh, I’ve got you,” Tony crooned, quiet and kind. He tucked his face into Steve’s neck, mouthing gently at his mark. “I wanted to make this last, but I don’t think I can wait any longer.” His hands trembled where they skated over Steve’s calves, his thighs. “I can’t- I can’t wait any more.”
“So what do you intend?” Tony says, sliding his hand across to drag his thumb against Loki’s nipple. Loki inhales sharply, and Tony offers him a wicked grin.
He scrubs his hands over his face furiously, trying to put himself back together. “Fuck.”
“No, Captain. He recognised my voice. I put on some children’s television programming, and it seemed to calm him down. I had thought he might change back as he slept, but I suspect now that both Hulk and Dr. Banner are worried about sir, and this heightened state is keeping him in Hulk form. But I am not an expert on Dr. Banner’s biology, and I cannot say for sure how his transformations work.”
He’s shaking now, eyes bright and fevered, and Tony approaches him with open hands. “Okay, Brucie-Bear, come on. Breathe with me, okay?”
National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE): advocacy! If you’re looking for info, any info at all, their
“I’ve got Nat,” Tony protests, and Steve frowns at him. “And Pepper, of course.”
“I took you for someone who takes what he wants,” Tony says, but he can feel his orgasm building slowly. He knows what Loki’s game is, and right now he’s getting away with it.
“No magic,” Tony bites out, and Loki sighs.
Tony thinks wryly. “Actually, it’s my fortress. Thor’s the guest.”
“Do you think that the FBI really has solid case against him?” Perino asks, and Tony covers his mouth with his hand.
“I reminded you of my father,” he says.
Instead, he hugs the northwest corner of the park, eyes flitting over the old men and their fishing rods, the duckweed already making its rampant conquest over the water, the grating cries of birds heralding the sharp beak of a kingfisher as it flashes into the rippling silt.
JARVIS doesn’t say anything.
“Power up,” Tony tells him, pulling up with his repulsors at the last minute until he’s hovering a few feet above them. He sends the visual to the quinjet. “Amora, baby, I thought we had something.”
“What have you been reading?” he asks, faintly.
“No,” he says firmly. He reaches a hand out and thinks not of touching Tony, but of how much he
“What, me? Never,” Tony says, pouting, and Pepper pulls him into her office with a huff. “Why am I still being dragged around? I answered your question. I even did all my paperwork this week!”
“Okay,” he says. He swallows, visibly reining in his temper. “So Bucky was part of the group that attacked me, and you didn’t tell me. And now he’s
Steve quirks his lips. “What is it with you and redheads?”
The professor watches him for a moment, brow slightly furrowed, a small smile playing about his lips. He tilts his head to the side. “Why are you here?”
“What?” Clint prods, looking somewhat alarmed.
“I have to get back to work on the float.”
Some meta, re: some of the convos I’ve had w/ readers—I think this is the first time Tony really
Clean up goes smoothly, and they turn over twenty-six Hydra agents to SHIELD for interrogation. Tony dreads the debrief, but this time he isn't injured enough to get out of it. He knows Coulson won't let him get off that easy.
It would have been easier if Tony had said that he didn’t want to, but Steve knew Tony better than Tony wanted him to. After years of friendship and five months of loving him in any way that Tony would let him, he knew how to read Tony’s black moods just as well as his bright and brilliant ones. What had sat on Tony’s face when he’d denied Steve the first time was heartbreak and self-hatred. There was nothing in the way of rejection, or disgust, or awkwardness. He’d looked gutted, and there was little Steve wouldn’t do to stop Tony from feeling like that. Steve wasn’t the kind of omega who entrapped an alpha into a bond, but Tony wanted this, Steve thought. Tony just didn’t feel like he deserved it.
Tony puts down his tools, because this warrants his full attention. He turns to the screen, stops fighting his grin, and lets Steve sit in his victory. The man's earned it. Steve's watching him carefully, his expression pleasantly neutral. His eyes are brighter than Tony's seen…maybe ever. They're engaged, intelligent. He's studying Tony like the famed tactician he's said to be.
“How do I look?” he asks her. His smile is crooked, a little broken. Steve wants so badly to hug him.
Rogers’ jaw tightened, and Tony winced at his own foolishness. A poor choice of words, considering how things had been between them the past few days.
Every year
“-back online,” he catches Rhodey saying. “I’ve got vitals.”
Bruce leans forward and braces his elbows on his knees, his eyes serious. “Tony, I want you to listen to me. No deflecting, no laughing it off. Ready?” Tony meets his eyes, pulse skipping. “Steve Rogers is in love with you, and it scares you to shit. I think you two could make something of it, if you would both stop skirting the issue like a pair of middle schoolers. I know you’re both emotionally stunted American men, but one of you is going to ruin this in a bad way if something doesn’t change, and it’s the resentment of that broken chance that’s going to fuck up the team, not you acting on it. You’re a powder keg.”
“Seems reasonable,” Ms. Jones offered.
“Yeah.”
“Go on,” Thor said, taking a long draught from whatever drink he was holding, and Steve nodded and headed for the stairs.
“Do you think I’ll be letting you out of bed, once we really get started?” Tony asked idly, and Steve couldn’t help but whimper. He felt humiliatingly like he actually might begin to get wet, right there in the kitchen.
Steve shakes his head, forehead rolling back and forth against Tony’s chest, and Tony strains to hear. Steve is apologising. Over and over, sobbing with it, his shoulders shaking. Tony’s stomach flips over in place.
“Bigger fish to fry,” Tony reminds him, and Steve nods. His fingers trail down the inside of Tony’s thigh, gentle and warm. “Steve. It’s alright.”
“How many times have we seen only the false and the flaws and never noticed the sweetness?” Tony murmurs to himself. A quote, from Tom Sawyer.
“Ah,” he says. “Well…”
“No,” Steve shakes his head, a bright blush overtaking him. “I said- I asked what it
Steve stood up before he could embarrass himself in front of Bruce, keeping the sweatshirt held in front of him. It was a little transparent, but at this point it seemed a little silly to pretend anything. Bruce nodded at them both and then walked to the door, stepping out to give them some privacy.
He can feel whatever it is that keeps him attached to Tony pulling. He resists it, mostly out of pique, but then something exciting happens. Tony stops in the middle of the gravestones. He rubs at his chest, a small furrow appearing between his brows.
– Tracy K. Smith, “My God It's Full of Stars"
“Of course, Tony.” He makes a familiar gesture with his hands. “Shall I send you home?”
“Need a handicap?” Steve asks, and Tony sneers at him.
“We’ve dealt with crazy,” Beth says evenly.
Steve hums around Tony’s cock, tongue writhing filthy against the underside, and Tony can’t. Think. Steve’s hands are firm and unyielding against Tony’s waist, holding him perfectly where Steve wants him as he buries his nose into the coarse hair between Tony’s legs and breathes in deep.
“Once more unto the breach,” Tony intones humourlessly, and Steve prays for patience. He’s never had much of it, and talking to God has never gotten him much in the way of the answer he wants, but it’s all he has to offer. He prays that whatever he has to give is enough to fix this thing that’s crackling between them, to be the glue that keeps his sanity intact.
“It is my personal recommendation that you see a…different kind of specialist, at least at first. We’re not sure exactly what Amora did to you. But we have enhanced allies that can test that for us. That’s what you were worried about, wasn’t it?”
“Steve, baby, what are you
“Captain America Subverts Blow-Out Fight With Cuddling,” Tony intones, and Steve lets out an unsteady laugh. “News at Nine.”

Steve waits, still smiling. He watches the way the passing headlights shimmer over Tony’s hair, lighting up the curls in a ripple wave. It almost looks like silk, and Steve desperately wants to ruffle it, but he knows how vain Tony can be about such things.
, since absolutely nobody noticed that oh, hey, turns out that when Morgan Le Fay hit me with her flashy purple light, it actually did something!” Okay, maybe he’s panicking a little. “Please tell me Strange is in the city right now.”
“Dunno,” Tony admits. He tips his head back, watches the clouds stream by. “Lost count.”
“Fine,” Tony said, caught somewhere between amusement and sheer, all-encompassing confusion. He glanced over Rogers: his clenching hands, his tight jaw, the awkward shift of his feet. “Alright, Sheriff.” He smiled, reaching back to untie his apron. He hung it on its hook, then turned, running a hand over the back of his neck. “How about a drink?”
. He knows that he’s the only one Tony will slow down and listen to, every time. “It’s not like I can do it. Clint isn’t suited. Thor, as one of the team’s tanks, doesn’t have the field of vision to make big picture calls, and he still doesn’t understand Earth’s geopolitics well enough. And Nat works best in the shadows, not at the centre of the things. You’ve been a superhero longer than anyone, and you have plenty of experience commanding large groups of people, as well as with military manoeuvres and tactics. That’s why you’re Cap’s second-in-command in the first place.”
“Did you imagine I’d be quiet in bed?” Tony quips, because he’s feeling manic and capricious and a little crazy.
“If he wanted me why would he leave?” Tony sneers. He grabs his shirt from the island and pulls it back on. He feels uncomfortably naked.
Tony freezes, smile dropping off his face. Numbness spreads through his chest, skittering down his arms. Fear. “What?”
He’s still getting used to that. It feels strange, almost, to be confined to a body. He raises his hands, looks at them in the light slanting through the windows. He turns them over, feels the warmth of the morning sun on his skin.
“I’ll deal with that later,” he tells him, shrugging. Stephen frowns, leaning over the table. He folds his long-fingered hands together in front of his face, considering Tony over the roof he’s made of them. The weight of his assessing gaze makes Tony shiver a little.
“He’d fight you again for saying that,” Peter says, and Steve shouts “I would” in furious agreement. “You know Cap loved you.”
“I shouldn’t have pushed you,” Steve explained. “It’s not right. I should have respected your choice-”
“Wow, this apology is really going well for you, isn’t it.”
Natasha rests a hand on the nape of his neck. "Come on," she says, and takes him out of the room. Tony notices Clint doesn't protest half as much as he thought he would. There's no hardness to him, none of the quiet anger that filled the first year after New York.
“Bruce would be better suited to this,” he mutters. “The wet sciences aren’t really my specialty.”
“I’m a filthy social climber,” Steve declared, widening his eyes as big as he could. He looked up at Tony through his lashes. “But I promise I have other, more redeeming qualities.”
“No, Steve’s convictions came from a deep and abiding purity of thought. He believed—wholly and uncompromisingly—in things that most people left by the wayside. That I have left by the wayside, more times than I care to confess. Things we so often discard as plebeian or naïve: truth, justice, compassion-”
"So then what's the problem?" Tony snorts incredulously. "You should seduce him. Turn him to the light side."
“I’ll make us some real food,” Steve said. “I’m thinking pasta. Maybe soup?”
"I want you to tell me the truth," Steve says evenly.
“Sorry, did I walk into the twilight zone?” Wilson asks, glancing around.
Another twenty minutes. Steve does a circuit of the room, sits down, goes back over to the monitor. They should be closing in on the facility right now. Perhaps convening outside as they make any last minute calls. He scrubs a hand over the back of his head.
“I think Loki can see the future,” Tony says, apropos of nothing, and Steve stills. He blinks once, twice, processing the assertion. “He told me I had to make things right with you, because if not we’re all going to fucking die. He had a premonition, like- like something out of the exorcism. There’s someone coming for us, something…something big. That’s why he’s here; because teaming up with us is better than the end of everything. He said there would be nothing left to fight over. And I’m so tired of fighting with you, Steve. I’m so- God, I’m so fucking
Tony grins. He’s always right. “Might kill you,” he murmurs into the silence of the helmet, and Loki smiles wickedly.
“Besides, I wasn’t born in 1920.” He shrugs. “I don’t think Steve even really consciously knew what he was doing, to tell you the truth.”
Steve’s looking at him with a kind of vulnerable expression when he glances up, and Tony can’t help but look away. Embarrassment curls into his stomach, heats his cheeks. He’s glad he doesn’t blush like Steve does.
Loki stays there for a moment, breathing hotly against Tony’s neck, Tony’s hand still tangled in his hair, the other gripping his bicep. He’s shivering with the aftershocks, lethargy flowing through him, and he hisses when Loki eventually pulls out and rolls to the side, one hand on Tony’s chest. His fingers trace the arc reactor, follow his sternum to his navel.
“JARVIS, what’s Black Swan?” Steve asks, rubbing at the crease between his brows. He can see Tony’s provoking grin projected against the back of his eyelids.
“Are you sure?” Natasha asks, voice guarded, and Tony bites back a laugh, watching Barnes raise a gun and line up his shot. Tony powers up the unibeam.
“Real surprising,” Rogers said, and Tony sighed. He’d botched this up so poorly. Rogers deserved better.
“Calling, sir.”
“God, Tony, what about what I just said makes you think I think you’re weak? You’re one of the strongest people I know.” He huffs, shaking his head. “Okay, listen. Can I ask you one thing?” Tony eyes him warily, but he nods. “Don’t… Can you try not to assume that I mean the worst possible thing? Just… I know I got us off on the wrong foot. I’ll take responsibility. That was my fault. But now… Tony, you know I…” Steve swallows, then visibly steels himself, looking up to meet Tony’s eyes full-on. Tony’s heart is thundering in his chest a mile a minute, but outside of that he feels strangely calm. He feels like he’s been preparing for this moment for years, and finally: here it is.
“No better place to be in a blizzard,” Rogers agreed, arm closing around Tony’s middle like a steel trap. His body was tight and warm around Tony’s whole everything, every breath pressing him into Tony. Rogers pressed his nose into Tony’s temple and breathed in deep, a small kiss glancing against his temple.
“Try not to run into any malevolent magic-wielders on your way home.”
“I’m not,” he says. He reaches a tentative hand out, gets it around Steve’s wrist. He follows his arm up to his shoulder, his neck, his cheek. He brushes his thumb over the soft skin beneath Steve’s left eye.
Tony huffs a put upon sigh. He presses the button for the elevator and lets Steve coax him inside.
“Jane is disgustingly assured for a mortal scientist involved with an actual mythological warrior god.”
Pepper levels a telling look at him, which Tony blithely ignores in favour of more yoghurt. Eventually, he hears her sigh. “You have Maria and Rhodey, and probably Phil. The contested senators are anybody’s guess. It depends on if Ross got to them first, and how much political manoeuvring he’s done already.” She pauses, and Tony glances up to meet her eyes. Her expression is harried. “Ironically, this was easier when we were a military contractor,” she admits. “We had more weight.”
. That was probably Amora, too.
“And you couldn’t go through official channels.”
“Tony,” Steve manages, and Tony reaches up and smooths his hair back from his forehead. “
and you don’t trust him to love you in a way
Pepper slides in and fixes him with a look as he crosses around the front of the convertible. "You picked me up from the airport, personally."
Tony, predictably, doesn’t hear him. Instead he crawls up the bed, curling into a ball in the middle, crying like a child. It’s maybe the worst thing Steve’s seen, and Steve has seen a lot of horrible things in his day. Tony’s shaking, sobbing body paints a shattering picture of abject misery, and Steve is sick and tired of being helpless.
The man shoots Tony in the chest, and the bullet ricochets off the arc reactor and into Tony’s arm. He screams weakly, voice hoarse, already resigned to his fate.
lost to consider the lives that were
“What is it you need, Sheriff?”
Loki waves a hand, and the muzzle disappears. “I am not a maiden in need of defence.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Strange almost looks like he might smile. Then the moment breaks, his expression shuttering. They watch as he assembles a strange collection of items: a pomegranate, a candle, a bag of animal bones, a mortar and pestle. He holds out a cup, his expression grave.
“Omega,” Tony rumbled, and Steve tilted his head back and closed his eyes in willing submission. “Fuck. If you were this desperate you should have come down to the workshop, baby.”
“Is that why you said you were in a good mood?”
“You don’t have much of one even with the coffee,” Steve drawls, amused. He sits up, pulling his hand back. “You’re uncomfortable.”
“Pot, kettle.”
“Sarah
Tony doesn’t know what he means by that, and he still feels like his head is full of cotton. If Cap wants to be an asshole he can go and suck his own knot for all Tony cares. He shovels food into his mouth and glances over at the crossword.
Tony winces. “The Mandarin Oriental.”
Steve blinked eyes that felt like they were lead-weighted, and there was Tony. He was leaning in the door to the heat room, one hand white-knuckled over his nose and mouth. His eyes were wild in his face, and the
Bruce sighed and patted Steve awkwardly on the shoulder. It was the first time anyone had touched him in days, and the contact was startling. The warm imprint left by his hand resonated through Steve’s body: an echoic wave of simple camaraderie that let him breathe for what felt like the first time since he’d stepped into the tower.
“I’m Tony, now, huh?”
Tony’s world stops.
“Miss Williams seemed to share your sentiments. She told Sir that he should take better care of his omega, especially one so loyal as you.” Steve winced, knowing how much that had probably hurt Tony. “Yes, quite.”
Steve has never called him before. Tony blinks. Is he still on mission? Is he dying?
“Damn.” He sighs. “I guess I better face the music.”
“Love you, too,” Tony says, blowing her a kiss. Her indifference is loud and projected, and Tony grins at her retreating back. “We’re outpowered, I know. Did anybody call Coulson to check in?”
! You classy British fucker.” He grins wolfishly. “Nah, let the investors see it. They like knowing my tech keeps me safe despite all the supercharged baddies I face.” He winks at the assembled party. “Let’s just tell them it was a goddess and not Captain America that got me, alright?”
“I’ll come back,” he offers. “Or, I won’t? I won’t come back, I’m never coming back.”
“But I
Steve smiles that bashful, boyish smile of his that always makes Tony’s stomach turn over like he’s a kid in middle school with an awful crush. He opens his mouth under Steve’s when he leans in for a kiss, his lingering smile making it a little sloppier than usual as he reaches down, the cold, liquid touch of his fingers on Tony’s entrance enough to make him shiver. His tongue presses inside Tony’s mouth in tandem with his first finger, and Tony arches up under him, a soft sound escaping his chest at the dual sensation.
“And Rogers?” Tony asks dully, already dreading the answer.
“You think I don’t know that-”
“Voice imprint required,” JARVIS intoned, sounding a little apologetic about it.
“Morning,” Tony yawned. “Nat. Why are we doing this so early?”
There’s a pointed silence in the room, and Tony exhales sharply and moves his arm, scrubbing both hands over his face.
“Let’s take ‘em to church, Avengers. J, keep an eye out for civilian interference.”
“Fuck,” he bites out, and Tony flushes hot at the sound of the curse in Steve’s mouth. It’s so rare for him to be foul-mouthed, even when he’s angry. He doesn’t even curse when they’re shouting at each other, and in this particular instance the word just sounds dirty and desperate. Tony can’t help but imagine him saying it in other circumstances, and he turns to stare at the ceiling, flopping one forearm over his eyes to block out the sight of Steve’s broad, straining shoulders.
Steve, of course, won’t leave him, and so JARVIS carries them both back to the tower. Steve hops onto Iron Man’s boot like he’s always done and wraps his arms around the armour’s neck. He doesn’t say anything when they land, but he’s watching Tony like a hawk.
“J, baby?”
“What are you doing?” Tony says flatly, slicking his hair back. He opens his eyes and turns around, but Loki is a green and black blur behind the fogged glass. He reaches for the shampoo.
Natasha narrows her eyes, mouth curving into a wicked smile. “Why would they look for alternative options when an easier path was in front of them?”
Bruce looks at him with a flat expression. “I can’t fathom why.”
“So what, you should have to throw a punch to get me to stop?” Steve laughs, bitterness seeping through a twisted smile. “God, Tony, I know you’ve been through some-”
Tony’s expression shutters. It’s not what he meant to say, and Steve winces, cursing his own cowardice. He opens his mouth, but finds himself at a loss for words.
Tony grins, and pulls up the first document: the Japanese defence contracts, which he has yet to actually read. Hasegawa.
There’s a long pause. Collins and Cochran lock eyes for a moment, something complicated passing between them, before Cochran leans back, clearly finished. Tony knows he’s loathe to press his colleagues in public, but he’s quite the negotiator when he wants to be. He’ll have to talk Cochran around if he wants to get a handle on this thing.
Steve did, because there was nothing else he could do. Tony looked ruined, his eyes flashing warningly, the tight furls of his fists pressed up against the glass. “Alpha,” Steve said helplessly, pressing one palm flat to the glass, and Tony mirrored him without hesitation.
“Because I haven’t got my priorities straight,” he says, brutally honest. “Amora made me watch you die, over and over again. You wanted me to see Xavier because you knew I wasn’t okay after that, and you were right.” Tony restrains the childish urge to crow at the admission. “I can’t promise that I’ll make the right call on the field, and I can’t stay off it and not-…and not hate myself, if something happened to you.” Steve pauses, glances around the table, lets a furious blush steal over his beautiful bones and still he continues on, determined in the face of his own embarrassment. “Any of you.” His voice gains confidence as he speaks. “Xavier showed me that maybe I shouldn’t trust myself to make the right call right now, if it comes down to putting someone I care about in danger in order to save a civilian, or for the greater good, or to stop whatever it is we’re fighting next.
killed people for threatening Potts. You know that. It’s in the files.” He knocks back a gulp of his whiskey, making Steve wince a little. Clint was more of a beer and Everclear kind of man, and he’d never really understood why Tony insisted on buying him five-hundred dollar alcohol if he wasn’t even going to appreciate it. But then, five-hundred dollars was nothing to Tony. Growing up first under Prohibition and then The Depression meant that Steve hadn’t been in any place to understand high-class booze as a kid, but like many things, the war had changed that quickly. He’d been passed through society parties and military fundraising efforts like a prized trinket, and the military elite only ever drank top shelf. Furthermore, as someone who could only drink for taste, both Starks had taken to spoiling him.
“Easier said than done,” Tony snaps as another bolt takes down a pillar he’s just flown by. He’s close enough to see Cap, now. His blonde brows are knit in pain, skin sallow. He looks so vulnerable, secured to the metal bed in his civilian clothes. He’s wearing nothing but a white t-shirt and slacks. Tony dodges again as he scans the machines; life support is obvious, the rest less so. A supercomputer, cooling units, a DNA sequencer, some other things he can’t classify because Amora hits him in the shoulder, spinning him out and throwing him to the ground. The entire garage is bathed in green light, and Amora is shaking with it. “Shit, we’re sitting ducks in here. But maybe…”
“It’s not an
“I didn’t say anything,” she sing-songs, but she doesn’t have to. Tony’s heard enough the past few days.
“You just want to work on a vintage fire truck,” Joyce Kiely tells him, because SI employees are many things, but generally, easily fooled isn’t one of them. She’s a fierce blond who works in Legal, and Tony is maybe a little in love with her.
He calls down to the concierge and makes sure that everything will be taken care of whenever the girls decide to check out. Then he asks if he can use the loading dock to avoid scrutiny, and thanks the woman when she tells him she can do him one better: she can have a porter escort him to the laundry elevator and take him through the basement to the loading dock.
“Come on,” he says, and Tony swallows, pressing their foreheads together for just a moment. He breathes in, sharing breath, warmth. “
“Of course, sir,” JARVIS tells him, and Tony smiles.
Tony really,
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Tony said, and Steve smiled. He reached for an egg, cracking it neatly into the bowl.
Natasha just shakes her head, glancing meaningfully at the one-way glass.
“You’re right,” Rogers said shortly, and Tony took a deep breath as Rogers’ fingers loosened. Tony stumbled into him, offering comfort in the press of his body against Rogers’ stalwart form. “Can’t fault me for wanting to spend the holiday taking care of the best friend I’ve got left.”
“I stopped mid-sweep when I heard you were in danger, and then I left when Clint was hit,” Natasha explains, voice surprisingly calm for someone talking such
“Pretty omega slut. You’re fucking dripping,” Tony hissed, his breath coasting over Steve’s back, and Steve spread his knees wider. “Oh, honey, I know exactly how flexible you are. I need you up a bit more.”
“Right,” Steve says, standing. His eyes catch on the bouquet. “Pepper said she’d ask you for a vase.”
“How long were you planning this?” Natasha asks, and Tony shrugs at her. The ice around Thor begins to crack, bright blue and white chips skittering across the floor in every direction, loud snapping noises echoing against glass and steel. Loki stands in front of Thor, a smug expression on his face, and Tony bites back a laugh as Thor roars to life, stomping one foot forward and then pulling himself up short, his entire body stumbling to a stop.
Steve raises an eyebrow. That wasn’t what he had been expecting. “What?”
Outside, Beth looks up from where she’s measuring a length of balsa against the table saw. Her expression shifts from amusement, through shock, then delight, and finally, into worry.
“Tony, listen for just a minute.” Bruce pulls off his glasses, cleaning them in the hem of his shirt. He puts them on and folds his arms over his chest. “Do you understand the difference between you telling me that I’d like it here and you can keep me safe, and you asking me to stay because you
“Tell him it’s his fault for stripping naked in Cambridge in the middle of winter and letting Hydra cart him away like a mail-order bride,” Steve huffed.
Tony: I am so ALONE and I must do EVERYTHING MYSELF and I am a MARTYR.
“Sir.”
Steve swallowed, glancing sheepishly up at the security cameras. “I’m a little shocked at myself,” Steve admitted. JARVIS didn’t reply, likely because there wasn’t a good response to that. “Um. Okay. Can I ask you something, and have you…not tell Tony?”
“Thank God,” Steve whispers, and then he’s leaning back in, and there’s nothing tentative about that. His mouth is everywhere, hot and warm and wet, and Tony opens his lips under Steve’s because he doesn’t know what else to do. This is wrong, part of him knows, and he has no idea what’s going on, but that wasn’t a lie. He’s wanted Steve for years, longer than he even knows, probably. He just didn’t think he could have him.
I sat all night after your heat broke and held you, touched you, and then I cried like an omega in a Nicholas Sparks movie because you were the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen in my life, and you were mine until one of us fucking died. You’d asked for that. You wanted that from me, for me, and then you gave it to me. You have given me everything I never thought I’d be able or allowed to have.
“Everything good?” he asks, and Tony rolls his eyes at him.
, “every piece of data I have points to Captain Rogers’ love for you being quite sincere.”
“I was going to spin some bullshit about why Rogers couldn’t be pack alpha and try to goad you into doing it.” He smirked. “Looks like I don’t have to.”
Natasha rolls her eyes. “JARVIS, the movie, please.”
“Seriously?” Clint demanded, and Steve cleared his throat, straightening up again. Okay, maybe that was too much for the kitchen. Bonded sex pheromones weren’t really what the others were looking to smell while they were trying to eat, especially when there was both another alpha and an omega on the team. It wasn’t fair to Natasha and Clint. Bond pheromones were a big red flag to the unbonded to stay away, and if they were aggressive enough, they were known to make other alphas and omegas feel sick. The kitchen was actually the worst place for them to do this.
. You have a meeting with the security taskforce at 11 o’ clock. Ms. Potts will be here to discuss preliminaries with you at nine.”
“He’s a reality warper, like-” Tony cuts himself off, thankfully before Sue can say anything to stop him. Her expression is sharp. Steve thinks that perhaps there is a reason that it took so long for Reed to notice that one of his closest friends had become a gaunt hermit, and it was because his much more gregarious wife was still angry at Tony for the War. Sue was fierce as ever as she stood with her hands on her hips in her pyjamas, surveying her family with an unimpressed glare.
“Well, no,” Steve says. “She’s an untrained civilian. But she also wouldn’t want an enhanced who was qualified to do it, if she loved that person. Even if she knew they could help.”
“I wouldn’t say unnecessarily,” Tony murmurs, lips moving against Loki’s skin.
“He’s a natural,” Bruce muttered. He only sounded a little bitter. “This is amazing, by the way. I don’t even know what it is. It’s like foie gras, but foam.”
“The cigarettes here taste better than in America,” Thor said finally, because he’d try anything anyone gifted him. It was an Asgardian custom, something about refusing offerings as the son of Odin, and honour, and a duty to the people. “You cannot get this Midgardian disease, cancer, yes? You should try them. I have many kinds.”
“The Captain suggested-”
gets sloppy drunk, not just Irish-Americans, which hey, speaking of trading on stereotypes and problematic stuff, that should definitely be a bigger issue. It’s impossible to get anywhere without getting sticky goop on your shoes from all the spilled alcohol. And what was the deal with the felt hats? Felt was awful, and staticky, and had never looked good on anyone. It was like his entire beautiful city became disgusting and ugly for a whole day
“So…you’ve got a stalkery fan, then?” Clint says, squinting at him a little. “She seemed pretty dangerous, did a real number on Cap.”
“Deal,” Steve said, grinning. They made their way through the glimmering crowd, Steve’s eyes skimming over sequined mermaid-tail dresses and suits in bold, bright geometric prints. Bruce had gone for plain black, but Tony’s tailor had insisted that it was a crime to put Steve in anything but a beautiful, deep blue tux that made Steve think of storms and ocean water. He felt good in it, and he smoothed his fingers over one black silk lapel with a little smile. Tony would be proud, that Steve was finally getting used to being spoiled.
“I don’t know? My heat might be coming on soon,” Steve admitted. Between the serum and the stress of combat and then their job, his heats had always been unpredictable. He carried emergency blockers with him at all times, but he and Tony preferred to let them run when possible. It was better for his health and their bond, but mostly it was like Tony always said; heats were just a lot of fun. “But you’ve been working a lot this week, so I might also just miss you a bit.”
Tony calls Reed, then Maria. Maria, thankfully, refuses to let Tony go alone.
“Apparently, letting yourself be auctioned off for an innocent date on the town with some lucky SI employee,” Steve answered, grinning. He knew SI didn’t really offer hazard pay, anyway. Everybody wanted to work in Avengers Tower. He pressed a slow, open-mouthed kiss to the underside of Tony’s jaw. “You know you’re actually trying to argue me into being mad at you, right? Has your genius brain registered that bit yet? Or do you love arguing so much that you didn’t notice?”
Y O U I N V I T E D M E, Steve protests, and his whole face feels hot. He feels like he’s going to float away. For weeks Tony refused to talk about it, and this is not at all how he’d imagined this conversation going. He wishes he had a better way to communicate, but there’s no way they can get Franklin to be their intermediary for this one.
Tony takes pity on him, leaning in and pressing a kiss to one of his eyelids. If his mouth comes away wet, neither of them say anything about it. He kisses the other one, then mouths over the tear track below it, following the line to Steve’s mouth. He nips gently at Steve’s upper lip, then dips down, taking his lower lip into his mouth and sucking gently on it in the way that always, inevitably makes Steve whine into the kiss.
“The soloist,” Tony says, meeting Loki’s eyes in the mirror.
“Five.”
“Love each other?” Tony prompts, quiet, and Steve lets out a rough breath and leans in, pressing Tony back against the workbench and kissing him, thoroughly.
Cap is up as soon as the last piece comes undone, slamming into Tony hard enough to knock the air out of him. He’s got a hand on the side of Tony’s head, and Tony grabs his wrist, heart pounding in his chest.
“You’re your own worst enemy, Tony,” Peter says. “Now stop being such a dramatic asshole, and let’s go. I’m free until three. If you fly us over, we can be in and out of the Triskelion with plenty of time to spare.” And then, under his breath, “Fuck, I just came for the banging cast iron waffle maker. This is why I don’t hang out here. Crazy shit, every time…”
He rests his head on his bent wrists, staring down at the floor between his knees. In the bathroom, he can hear Tony cleaning up his goatee, brushing his teeth, gargling. Finally, he steps out of the bathroom, and Steve keeps his eyes on the carpet. He knows well enough by now that it’s very likely that Tony isn’t wearing any clothes.
Tony swallows. Steve’s eyes are so, so bright when he cries. The rims of his eyelids are puffy and pink, astonishing on his classically handsome face. He’s unbelievably beautiful, but he was never Tony’s. Not really.
Bruce opens his mouth, then seems to think better of it. He shuffles the printouts in his hands, awkward, lining them up on the worktop. “It’s just… most people never meet their match. Even now.”
“Two minutes. Iron Legion deploying.”
“He shot an asset through you,” Tony says, repeating something Steve told him once after a particularly gripping nightmare.
“Captain.”
The glass door swings shut, and Steve takes a slow breath, releasing it. He steps into the elevator.
“You like it when I work you open with nothing but my cock,” Tony murmurs, and Steve lets out a high, desperate sound of want. “But I’m a bit bigger like this.”
“That’s the end of the line, folks, thanks for playing,” Riri said, and Steve let out a rough sigh of relief.
“I don’t know,” Steve says rubbing his hands over his face. “Aren’t they?”
“They need him,” Tony muses, considering. He rolls the ice around the walls of the glass, watching the amber liquid swirl in oil-slick patterns with the ice-melt. “They didn’t want him transferred here. You would have wanted him here, with you, and this place is a fucking fortress. They couldn’t reach him here, which means they needed him somewhere they could fetch him later. Because they need him. What do they need him for?”
“How did you and Nat do it?” he finds himself asking, then stops. “Sorry, forget that-”
“Oh, fuck,” Tony said faintly, watching him with wide eyes. “Kiss me.”
Tony stiffens. “Reed,” he says thinly, “you know he can hear you-”
Tony shifted, his body straightening up to rock his hips more forcefully, grinding his knot in as deep as he could get it as Steve tensed, blind and gasping, his senses narrowed down to Tony inside him, his thumb slick over Steve’s slit, back and forth, a maddening swipe that made Steve whimper and squirm with oversensitivity, thighs tensing and releasing against Tony’s hips as aftershocks skittered through him. He could feel Tony coming, could feel his knot pulsing inside him, and when he finally had the strength to open his eyes Tony was staring down at him with rapacious intensity, his hips still moving. His brow was slick with sweat, moisture leaving glistening trails down the tendons of his throat, his chest. His mouth was red and used, and Steve loved him so much it ached.
“No,” Tony says, then glances at Pepper. “Er. It’s fine.” He clears his throat. “Are you hungry?”
Tony shrugs, stepping into the elevator. “Don’t worry about it. Later, Cap.”
better.) But he hasn’t made any sexy tentacle toys, which he totally would have, if it was a kink. He’s not that guy.
“Yes, please,” Thor says, turning back to Tony. His face is grim. “I would say this news only once.”
The thing about being a superhero was that there was a lot of hurry up and wait.
“I’d rather Tony hold the other guy, than SHIELD,” Bruce had countered, shrugging in that small, slightly frightened way of his. He’d been so reticent, then. “I trust him.”
"Scotch on the rocks?"
The elevator is approaching the penthouse now, and Tony lets out a breath, swiping a hand over his face. He’s not sure what’s waiting for him, but he can’t imagine it’s anything good. He and Steve had been in such a good place this morning.
“You need to be dead,” Natasha says, sipping on a bowl of tom kha gai. Loki nods at her once. “Why?”
"Don't ask stupid questions now, Stark. You were doing so well."
"What would you know about it, Marty McFly? You've never been anything but the righteous little orphan Annie fighting bullies, come to save America from the big bad Nazi. You have a death count higher than the Chrysler and yet you still maintain your moral high horse because everybody knows eugenics are evil. Tell me, Captain, what's it like to be the living proof of this country's hypocrisy? We took a disabled orphan and let a German scientist turn him into the Übermensch, then let him loose on Hitler. Does your superhearing let you in on the dog whistle effect of the words 'perfect soldier', or has your blonde hair and blue eyes been called All-American too often for you to see that you're made of everything you were ever taught to hate about The Reich?"
“Hello, Pepper.”
Steve presses a grateful kiss to his mouth, his jaw, his pulse point. Then he wraps Tony’s wrists in the make shift sash. It’s not quite enough that Tony can’t get out of it, but it’s enough to remind Tony to keep his hands to himself. He hooks his tied arms back around Steve’s neck just to be contrary, reeling him in for a kiss, and Steve goes with a happy hum.
, Tony. Inside and out. Top to bottom. Everything you are. Everything you’ll become.” Steve’s leaning in as he speaks, closer, closer, until their lips brush with each word. “I want it all. There is nothing you could say to scare me away. I want every part of you. As thoroughly as I belong to you, I want- I
"This is what happens when you break your knee and can't be on the scene," Tony says cheerfully. "They can't wipe their asses without you."
He could do it. He could go back upstairs and tell Steve he wanted to complete the bond, and Steve would go with him. He’d do his duty. A small, slightly hysterical laugh overtakes Tony at the thought. Lie back and think of America.
“Captain Rogers is exiting the shower,” JARVIS says crisply, and Tony slumps into the bed, regulating his breathing as the water shuts off. He flattens himself to the mattress, pulling the sheets back over his hips and tucking his clenching fists under the pillows.
It’s dark when he steps outside again, or at least as dark as Manhattan can ever be. The sweetness of Central Park in heat washes over him, approaching rain and fresh greenery, flowers and mown grass and clean dirt. The scent stays with him as he makes his slow way down Fifth Avenue, the susurrus of leaves and warm breezes slipping over his skin until he feels grounded again, held close in the presence of New York’s glittering night spires, the cool grey stone wall of the park trailing under his right hand, the uneven stones at his feet. Between the branches of her cultivated forest he can see snatches of moon, silvery light peeking in and out from behind waxy leaves and crooked black branches. The city feels ethereal, and fey, and in the distance midtown is lit like the fantastical spires of Oz, Stark tower a bright beacon among many jealous compatriots. Inexplicably, he feels a sudden stab of regret for calling it ugly all those years ago; it’s grown on him, familiar and dear.
Steve watches her go with cotton in his mouth, milk soothing the sting of acid and sitting in his stomach like stones. There is a part of him, a surprisingly large and vehement part of him, that wants to tell Pepper to burn the whole thing and walk away. As he’d run out, he’d seen more than just the paintings; a pack of cards that were probably used by the commandos in the trenches, one of the old show costumes, and even what he suspected was his helmet from basic. The artist in him is still in a dead faint at the idea that he now owns not one, but two Warhols in which he is the subject, let alone whatever else is in the room. Some of the pieces had looked like the old propaganda posters he’d done back in art school.
Tony shakes his head. He doesn’t meet Reed’s eyes.
“A way forward,” he says.
Tony’s mouth closes. A terrifying, twisting pain is snarling up in his throat. He does his best to clamp down on the sob that wants to break out of his chest.
“There?” Tony says, crooking his finger, and Steve nods, back arching off the bed.
“’S okay,” Steve says, or tries to say. Tony’s high cheekbones are limned with tears, shining bright under the streetlights. It’s an alright final vision. Tony’s arms are a good place to die. He tries to reach up, to brush the tears from Tony’s face, but he can’t quite manage it. He settles for wrapping his fingers around Tony’s wrist instead. “Ton’…nnn.”
“We assume. Likely with Doom’s help.”
They’d said nasty things in the papers when the couple had first started stepping out in public: about Tony’s alpha-alpha relationship with Pepper being doomed from the start, about how the only reason he was settling down with an omega now was that Steve wasn’t even really an omega. He was tall, and broad-shouldered, Tony’s field commander. What kind of alpha let their omega order them around? To top it off, Steve’d spent years pretending to be an alpha at the behest of the military, a combination of suppressants, synthetic pheromones, and propaganda fuelling the lie until Steve had come out a year after what Tony liked to call his “defrosting.” Omega rights had come a long way, and he wanted to set a good example for all of the omegas that were now allowed to join the military. Omega enlistment rates were low, and the number of drop-outs was higher than other natures, likely because of internal pressure and ostracism. It felt important, but he never wanted to be used as fodder for the papers to try to hurt Tony. That seemed to be half of what they did most weeks, like there wasn’t enough real news to print.
I think that's it! Let me know if there's something else you wish I'd mentioned.
“So where do you need me?” Wilson asks, and Natasha glances over at Tony for a moment before shrugging easily.
Peter wriggles, and Steve lets him go. He grins unrepentantly as Peter crosses his arms, awkward, then uncrosses them and scratches at the back of his head.
“Tony,” Steve says, a gust of breath, but there’s laughter in it. “You’re making fun of me again.”
“Captain America?”
Steve just shakes his head. “I’m going out,” he says. “I have a meeting. I just wanted to catch you before I go.” He winces. “And you’re right; I’m sorry for exploiting the predictability of your AA meetings. That was unfair.”
Tony blinks. “What?” And then, “oh, no. No, no, no. You want me to be your field commander? Are you crazy? Are you sure Xavier cleared you? Documentation or it didn’t happen- J, check my email, tell me-”
,” he moans. “Where the fuck did you learn this?”
Steve knows from experience that Tony's plots usually end up being wondrous and strange, so he lets Tony drag him down to the garage without protest. Tony had taken him to Sleep No More last month, the two of them running around like mad creatures in the narrow halls, chasing after Shakespearian characters come to life. The month before that he'd driven Steve up to The Cloisters for a closed tour, then left him to sketch tapestries to his heart's content while Tony sat in the shade, sipping a lemonade and fiddling with his tablet. Steve isn't sure what to make of these adventures, only that they always make themselves known when he is feeling particularly sorry for himself and sleep begins to evade him again. He suspects JARVIS's hand in the plot.
Okay, so there's a lot going on in this chapter, but I want to warn for the following in particular:
“I figured that out,” Bruce says. “What did he do that made you so upset you missed movie night?”
“Let me down,” Tony says, and Steve reluctantly takes hold of his waist and lifts up, ducking out from between Tony’s thighs. “My god.”
“I will tell you as soon as I hear anything from or about him,” JARVIS says, for what feels like the millionth time. “Sir, I strongly suggest that you seek the help of another magic-user. Mr. Odinson, at the very least-”
“Which means he’s got to be somewhere between here and the pass proper, in the scrub. Maybe he’d been hiding out, looking to spring an ambush on the bandits.”
“I am a creature of shadow and illusion, Stark. It is no mark on your ability.” He yawns widely, combs long fingers through his hair. “I suppose I could eat.”
“We don’t know that you’re stuck, Tony. We’ll keep working on it.”
“Yes, Father.”
“Less than an hour,” JARVIS replied, voice low and soothing. “They’ve administered the next injection, and are waiting on the blood test results. After that, Sir will go through the decontamination showers, just to ensure that his scent isn’t tainted when you see him. Doctor Banner will be the first to meet him, to judge if it is safe.”
“That’s…you can’t be serious,” Steve says, reeling. Pepper’s stare is unflinching. “That’s. Tony has worked so hard to become a better man, and you don’t support him?”
“Yeah, you do.” Tony puts a hand to his ear, clicks on the comm. “Rhodes, you’re flying your own ass home.”
“So you came upstairs, where the good cheese is,” Tony observed, grinning, and Steve flushed at the accusation.
“Sir, the elevator is ready for you.”
“We can ship out, then.”
It’s the wrong thing to say, because it changes the set of Steve’s jaw from placating to stubborn. That’s alright; Tony’s been ready for a fight. He kind of wants it, in fact.
, and Tony had gone along, all the while complaining that he could have the film screened privately for Steve if he wanted. He went anyway, though, and Steve had smiled and let Tony buy the tickets and the popcorn and the little chocolates with white sprinkles on the top that made them look a little like the pasties the showgirls used to wear. He was glad, to be at a place where he and Tony could just spend time together again, easy as anything. Nobody made him feel right in his skin like Tony did. He’d missed that so much when they were fighting. He’d felt deeply, strangely unmoored, floating through the days like a ghost.
Tony examines the resulting graphic for a moment, then stretches his hands to blow it up. “Okay, now take the measurements we’ve gotten from mjölnir and the bifrost drops, and feed it through as one big sustained signal.”
“What do you mean?” Tony asks, turning back to fully face Thor, but the man isn’t looking at him. His striking features are set in profile, a few strands of hair coming loose from his bun as he nods his chin at the television.
“Trying to tell me something, Pep?”
"And he should know better." Tony sneers. "If Loki is contacting you because he's interested, and you can have some guarantee of safety..." Pepper tilts her head to the side, considering. "He's less likely to attack the Avengers if he's attached to you."
“Did you or did you not just
Tony didn’t think they were talking about chess, if they ever had been, and that was rare and strange; in the three years and change he and the Sheriff had been…providing each other comfort, to be delicate about the situation, they hadn’t once talked about it. Tony had gone west to escape the Stark legacy, just put a pin in the map and landed here because it was a good a town as any. Timely had a blacksmith’s forge open, a large enough building by rural standards, and it had been for sale on a major train line no less. Rogers had blown into town almost four years ago now, and they’d ended up tossed together the way strange and unattached men were likely to be. The fact that they’d both left New York during the war, one to create guns and one to wield them, well. There was enough between them to strike up an easy camaraderie, was all. There had been a few drinks, a few shared horrors, a cold night in winter and a pot of coffee to keep away the nightmares. Sometimes, men got lonely. Tony had heard about it enough when he’d been on the front lines, taking part in demonstrations and overseeing shipments to the Union. He hadn’t needed to do it himself, being the great Tony Stark. Women had flocked to him in droves: beautiful, tittering, colourful birds that hung off his arm and chirped sweet things in his ears. It had been nothing, after all. It had all been cheap, fool’s gold. He’d felt he knew what he was getting, with Rogers, but this strange teasing was new. He wasn’t sure how he felt about it, what he made of it.
“Gotta use what I’ve got,” he says, shameless. He turns, though, and
“Tony,” Steve says, and Tony stills.
“I said yes, didn’t I?” Tony asks, fond exasperation outweighing his irritation. “Go on. If you’re lucky, and very,
This one, this man, for the rest of their ridiculous lives. And he wasn’t going to ask for a private moment, because he wasn’t ashamed. He wanted a public declaration. He wanted to write it above the city in clouds. This way, there was nowhere for Tony to run, or backtrack, or ever feel like he wasn’t wanted. This way, Tony would know always.
“Spidey!”
“We’re making ourselves miserable, aren’t we?”
“What organ is this? Of what manner of creature?”
“Tony doesn’t want
He wraps a towel around himself and then leans over, picking his phone up from the sink counter. He and Tony have texted before, although not much. Mostly little things, like Steve telling him to come down to dinner, or Tony telling him there were doughnuts in the kitchen. They text like flatmates that are barely friends, not…whatever it is they are. Steve sucks in a slow breath.
Tony let out a grumble, but he sat down at the kitchen bar, picking up a fork and cutting off a piece of omelette with the edge. He shoved it in his mouth and washed it down with coffee.
“You couldn’t keep me out of here if you got every code-wrangling gopher SHIELD employs from here to Hokkaido on the job,” Tony tells her. His confidence would be obnoxious if he sounded less exhausted when he said it. As it is, he mostly just comes off as resigned and sad.
“I did tell you you,” Tony sighed, visibly tired of this argument now, “it was just the regular beatings, Steve. I’ve been through worse.”
It starts like this; brunches on Sundays, first, before the church crowd gets out and mobs the cafés, just to help provide some routine. They talk about the team, how the last battle went, strategy, SHIELD interference. They make a quiet kind of peace. Then it was sparring, and then late nights, movies on Thursdays, Steve sketching in the workshop when he has some rare down time and completing mission reports when he doesn’t. Slowly, Steve becomes habit. Steve brings him pizza. Steve laughs. Steve brings him fruit for smoothies, expensive coffee, a dozen cronuts.
He reappears in the small room where they’re keeping his body under observation, only a little wobbly from the trip. His body’s the same as it always is: frozen, blue with cold and perfectly preserved, aside from the neat line of stitches in his neck. They’d frozen him in the hopes of reviving him once they figure out what’s wrong, knowing that he’s come back from it before. It’s a smart bet. What’s most interesting to the scientists, he knows, is that he hasn’t decayed or decomposed or done whatever it is that a normal body that had been dead for a day and then frozen would do. It’s why Tony’s still trying, why he won’t give up. It’s also probably why Steve’s stuck like this. He’s not quite dead, but not alive, either.
“Then you should,” Peter says, rocking back onto his heels. “What’s the harm?”
Tony pulls out of Steve’s grasp, picking up his drink and coming around to the other side of the bar. He lets Steve gather him into his arms.
“Okay,” Steve breathes, and it is. It’s okay. They’re okay.
“I love you,” Tony tells him, when he reaches Tony’s trapeziuses.
Steve licks his lips, his mouth dry as the Tabernas. He shakes his head mutely.
“Fuck,” Tony snarls, twisting out of the way as another tendril of flame arcs past him, narrowly missing his shoulder. He can feel the sear of heat even inside the suit. “I may melt after all.”
It turns out that there’s a slightly smaller population of Irish-Americans in SI than Tony would have thought, but that’s alright. He’s got enough to populate a float, plus Pepper, and after a few emails they come up with a small group of folks who are interested enough to be on the central planning committee.
“Clint and Thor went to the spot where JARVIS lost him, but came up empty. Thor suspects Amora, of course, but so do we. Not exactly a leap.”
Steve groans quietly at the idea that Tony is so overcome that his beautiful brain hadn’t been able to parse Steve’s tapping. He sucks a kiss behind Tony’s ear, under his jaw. Then he pulls back slightly.
Y E S Y O U C A N
Steve pins him to the side of the tub, wet hair dripping into Tony’s face as he looms over him. His face is flushed. Happy. He’s everything Tony’s ever wanted.
“Tony,” Steve breathes, but he knows he can’t hear him.
He watched Tony take a long swig from his water bottle, throat bobbing in the bright sunlight streaming through the clerestories. Steve licked his lips, eyes tracing a drop of sweat as it slid down one tendon and into the warm hollow of Tony’s throat.
“Shh,” Steve murmured, mouthing sweetly over the line of hair that trailed down to Tony’s waistband. He trailed over the sensitive ridge of Tony’s hips, smiling when he bucked up into him, and tucked his fingers into Tony’s waistband. “Can I?”
He stands up, putting the plate with its one measly slice of toast on the vacant stool. “I know you have an R&D meeting today, so I’ll let you prep. Steve can be a real asshole, but so can you, Tony.” He pauses. “But he’s still on the shitlist.”
“So, brunch!” he says brightly. “Cosme? Mexican? You liked Cosme, we’ve been, let’s go.”
Reed reaches out, one large hand closing over Tony’s forearm. He pulls him around to face him, his eyes darting over Tony’s face. Steve knows what he sees there: the gauntness of him, the way the skin under his eyes looks permanently bruised.
Tony squeezes his arse, pulling the globes apart in what he knows from experience is a maddening tease. Steve just about swallows his tongue as Tony slips his fingers closer, skirting the edges of his hole.
Thor lets out a booming laugh, but to his eternal credit, there is no bitterness in it. He seems, if anything, resigned. “Only once,” he repeats, and Tony grins like he gets the joke.
Steve blinked. “Okay?”
Reed shrugs. “You and Steve work best together when you are
“What,” Tony says, trying for levity, “the genocide or the loneliness?” Loki’s expression shifts through surprise, outrage, and amusement before finally settling on wry and chiding. Tony points past him, and Loki raises an eyebrow and tilts so that Tony can pass. Their noses are almost touching as Tony edges by him, and he fights the impulse to lean in, to let Loki push him back against the wall and take.
Steve doesn’t have anyone to talk about this with, really. He can’t talk to Bruce about it, or Pepper, or JARVIS. He certainly can’t talk to Natasha; she and Tony have history, and it would be the epitome of foolishness to betray his trust that way.
“Well, this was fascinating,” she says flatly. “Any other bright ideas?”
“Tony and I are secure,” the voice said, and Steve felt himself slump, his whole body reeling from relief. “But you can’t come inside.”
Also, a cookie for anyone who recognised the Cap quote: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ca/9f/32/ca9f3231cb0fd4cd3bd0d5a6274580b5.jpg
“I’m glad I could give you some pleasure,” Steve teases, warmly amused, and Tony can feel his face get hot. He’s always so thankful his Italian skin can’t betray his embarrassment. “Can I borrow your shower?”
“I’m sure he had a good reason for leaving, Tony.”
“But of course, I must do more to earn your trust,” Loki says, and something in him shifts hard, dangerous. His shoulders widen a bit, legs spreading a little to brace himself into a more defensible position. In some ways, seeing this much shows how cracked wide-open he is.
DUM-E examined him carefully, clutching gently at his shirt, before rolling away. Steve watched with a burgeoning grin as he brought back a familiar black sweatshirt, the one Tony left down here for when his body temperature inevitably started to drop after he was 24 hours or more into an engineering binge. By day three he was usually freezing in just a t-shirt, and so he kept this grease-stained, sweat-soaked, basically-a-shop-rag black hoodie down here for when he got desperate but was too absorbed to come out of his work haze. In the early days, before Tony had let anyone take care of him, Steve had seen him work until his flesh was covered in goosebumps, shoulders shaking, stomach snarling like an animal despite DUM-E’s attempts to appease his body with his sweatshirt and cups of mysterious green sludge. He was pretty sure that Tony would have died without the little bot, and Steve reached a hand up to give DUM-E a few affectionate strokes before taking the sweatshirt from its claw.
“Can I…kiss you again?” Steve asks, and Tony barks out an incredulous laugh.
“It was after you died.” Tony pauses, and this time Steve mouths it along with him: “The time before. Obviously.”
“J, deploy Mark XXXIX, Gemini.”
“And you need to sleep,” Beth says firmly, eyes narrowed. Tony offers her a sheepish grin.
“Liar,” Steve said fondly. “I’m gonna turn in, but tell Tony I love him, okay?”
Eventually, he smooths a hand over his suit lapels and heads for the door, because what else is there to do? Pepper’ll kill him if he makes her late to something.
“You know,” he tells Bruce hoarsely. He opens his eyes, fixes Bruce with a pleading look. “To wake up every morning next to that.
