Steve’s voice was heavy with strain, which didn’t make Tony feel any better. “I’m nearing the console. Tell JARVIS to get off my back, Tony, we talked about this.”
He’d known all kinds of pain in his life: burnings, stabbings and bullet holes. Even the worst of wounds faded after a while—and he’d been taught that pain was fleeting. Always fleeting. And once his body was frozen, he would forget. He would move on.
“Still,” Hammer said. “You are making a terrible mistake. A mistake that you will bitterly regret. He will never love you.”
Steve bit back a flinch at Rhodey’s confirmation that he didn’t fit in here. “I just want to know what I can do to make him happy. I don’t want to upset him all the time. But it’s impossible. All I know is what a unique woman she was. And it feels like I’m losing him if Indries remains such a mystery to me. Please. Give me
“Guess what?” Steve said, after Bucky left, his voice at least one octave lower. “I have another can of frosting in the pantry.”
Tony’s eyes were full of love as he nodded. Those eyes told Steve that he was his, and that he was, in some way, overwhelmed by his own reaction… by the desperate fidgeting of his body he could not control.
Natasha hummed. “No. But I could ask Stark to search for them,” she offered. “As you might know, he’s good with finding people. He’s a technological genius, and I bet he’d find that dream-person for you in a heartbeat, no matter how little you know about them.”
For two years, Tony hadn’t let himself worry about Steve. All of these months that had passed since Steve had left were restlessly spent. More often than not, he’d tried to fall asleep to the sound of the television blaring. To Friday reciting some kind of formula. To DUM-E’s whirring. To rotating the burner phone—always charged, always at hand—between his fingers. To
He didn’t sound too bothered, all things considered. Firing up the chest plate beam, Tony waited for Steve’s clearance that they’d all left the island, then took a deep breath. “Alright, on my mark. Now!”
Steve swallowed, staring up at Tony and he didn’t know what to say to that. He couldn’t talk like Tony, didn’t have his way with words, but he felt the same. Tony was perfect for him, too.
"No, you were fantastic," Steve said, following his words with a deep, satisfied sigh. "I can't imagine a better first time."
Tony released a little manic chuckle at Steve’s comeback and shook his head. “No, I’m good—not hurt,” he supplied while opening his eyes and yes, it was still completely fucking dark. He could’ve sworn that he saw Steve’s eyes flickering over his body thoughtfully, but that might’ve just been wishful thinking. He couldn’t see a damned thing.
“Probably not,” Strange said. “But you can never truly predict the impact of your actions, can you?”
Tony’s lips twisted into a smile. At least that answered the question of whether or not DUM-E had managed to deliver his message. Good for the bot… probably
“It was… was one of the reasons Pepper left,” Tony admitted quietly. He cupped Steve’s ass and molded into him, moving against him in slow strokes. His eyes were glued to his face. And Steve watched back. His eyes were on him, and in that moment, he saw no anger. No hatred. Instead, he was Tony at his best. Tony watching him with curiosity, with a thirst of knowledge and a firm will to learn and understand.
The place was exactly how Steve remembered it from his childhood. There was the overpriced gift shop littered with thousands upon thousands outdated products. Before entering the first hall, an old man took their entry fees and gave them a pamphlet guide.
Steve saw Tony wincing as he pulled the shirt over his head, no matter how much he tried to hide it. Two days had passed before the doctors had decided to let him go home, with a firm warning against any kind of strenuous activity. And Steve knew what Tony hated most—other than having to spend several nights in the hospital—was that the doctors were right. With Extremis gone, he wasn’t healing faster than the average person anymore, and they both knew it would take a while to get used to that again.
Well, it didn’t matter, anyway. He preferred things as they were, with Tony being none the wiser. If they actually talked about it, Tony would start asking questions, and Steve really didn't have the patience to deal with Tony's perceptions of him.
to help him,” Tony snapped. “He made that impossible! I can’t be seen helping him, or I’m cut off—for good. We’d all be fugitives, and I have a
Steve made a grimace, obviously still busy with killing Tiberius in his mind. Tony would lie if he said he didn’t find it completely awesome.
“But Tony’s running the company together with me,” Stane went on. “He has done so for many years. And I am warning you, boy, not to meddle with something that is none of your business. We should both stick to what Tony wants us to do for him, shouldn’t we? Tony asked me for exactly two things for your shared rooms.” He pointed towards the desk. “Some place with good lighting where you can draw and…” He smiled crookedly as he nodded towards the rather large bed that stood in the adjoining room.
“What—” Steve stuttered. He took a good few steps back until he could look at the whole scene. Tony was currently standing right behind what Steve assumed were holographic versions of his parents. And, Steve realized, there was a younger version of Tony lying on the couch, as well.
Hand in hand, Bucky and Natasha made their way towards the door and Bucky braced himself mentally for what was to come. He knew Steve and Tony had sort-of made up after Steve had travelled to New York, but the fact that Stark had simply turned up here all of a sudden… it could mean anything.
Just when the urge became too much to tolerate, Steve’s hand swept down the contours of Tony’s body. His fingers found Tony’s cock again, idly smearing a few droplets of pre-come around his shaft, and then doing absolutely nothing.
“Okay, okay,” Tony said. “I’ve got my cell phone, just… call me whenever, yeah? Or ask FRIDAY, she’s got all the Ian-specific-instructions. But calling me is fine, too.”
Fury shook his head slowly, eye trained on the phone in his hand. He started to type, then turned the device around.
“You’re a dream! You’re not supposed to argue with me, goddammit!” Tony let go of him, and took a step back.
That was the way they remained the rest of the night. Curled in each other’s arms. A few stolen moments they got to share on more than a superficial level—moments that, for Tony, nearly transcended human experience.
After all, Tony wouldn’t have any chance to slowly get used to the idea, to maybe develop those feelings in his own time. He would feel forced, and if there was one thing that would drive Tony Stark away, it was being pushed into a situation he didn’t want to be in.
Thankfully Steve didn’t say anything else. At least, not until they were sitting on the little couch facing the TV, watching the first channel that had come on.
“Alright, I think it’s time for Captain Sexy’s bedtime, ladies.” Tony said as he walked toward the group. With his face mostly obscured by the dark lighting of the bar the intoxicated women thankfully didn’t recognize who Tony was, so he had the chance to pull Steve away from their clutches and closer to the exit.
That's it guys! Thanks so much for your comments and thoughts on this, we loved each and every one of them.
Well, damn. He’d known it’d come down to this, of course, but it didn’t make the dilemma they were in now any less severe.
“No.” His mouth brushed against Tony’s, two fingers sliding over his hipbone. “I don’t do things like that if I don’t mean it.”
A man Tony didn’t know waited for him there. He sat alone at the huge-ass oval conference table and Tony saw him paging through the latest Accords version.
"Hey, you're the one spoiling it by making a scene," Steve said, mock defensive even as he got out of the bar-chair and stood closer to Tony. He took the hand he'd been holding and pulled it up, eyes searching Tony's. "But I'll take that deal," he said, quieter, smiling affectionately as he turned to press the ring against Tony’s fingers.
He released a choked sob, tossing against Steve’s arms in a fruitless attempt to break free, before a gentle female voice had him frozen.
in Tony’s eyes. It was all there. Every moment, every caress, every kiss of his lips and hug of his body. Laughter and tears, heated arguments and even more heated reconciliations.
“Nah,” Stark replied, but the matter-of-fact tone was obviously faked. “Don’t be. I’m getting used to it.”
A smile crept up onto Steve’s lips and made itself at home there. Weeks had passed since he’d departed from New York, and there wasn’t one minute when he didn’t miss Tony.
Natasha, however, only studied him for a moment, then nodded as if his word was the only thing that mattered to her. He really hadn’t gotten used to it yet. To Natasha trusting him. Or maybe he simply had trouble believing that he was worth her trust.
“You must be hungry,” Pepper prompted tentatively. “And you’ll want to change your clothes. We could order something you like… watch a movie. Or if you want to sleep first—”
“I’ve never…” Tony whispered, swallowing down the rest of the admission, but the meaning was very clear.
“Yeah? Really?” Tony asked, huffing. “It’s all so fucking easy for you, is it? You don’t give a shit that it would break Steve’s heart if they put you in prison after everything—”
How long they sat with Barnes, Tony didn’t know. At one point, Bruce made to leave for his research lab, while Steve sat in undisturbed silence, watching his friend for all his stillness. With each passing second that Steve sat there like a statue, frozen and unmoving, though,  Tony’s worry threatened to shatter whatever was left in him to shatter.
Carol stuttered before she leaned forward intently, pushing a finger against Bucky’s chest. “Next time you decide to out people in front of their boyfriends, stop and think for a second how that makes them feel, buddy, alright? I needed more time to tell him!”
“That wasn’t because I couldn’t stand him but because I basically got a boner every time he tried to teach me the star constellations. And last year… you know… with the crazy trip to MIT? Well, the guy at the physic’s lab had asked me once if I wanted to grab dinner with him sometime, and I kind of stalked him for a week after that, and—”
How long they remained like that, looking at each other without saying anything, Steve didn’t know. Only that it seemed hours before he finally found it in himself to walk further into the room.
Steve took a deep breath, and leaned his head back into the RV. “We’re on the roof, honk before you drive on,” he called, then took hold of the small ladder and climbed upwards.
. Steve’s visions… not so much. He was sure he would've remembered wearing full centurion gear, and he would've
Steve paused, and sure enough, he could feel Tony’s watch beneath his fingertips, the one he knew could easily transform into something very lethal.
“He’s one of those special kids who’s actually special and not just so because their parents like to brag.”
During the next couple of days, they mostly gathered and inventoried supplies. Tony had found a few food cans in the ruins of his former kitchen and even a mostly torn blanket they’d now spread out beneath their shelter.
“You’re so good,” Tony gasped rapturously. He was drowning in Steve’s scent, his senses overwhelmed with the feel of him. His thrusts grew needy; desperate. He needed to make Steve his, wholly. He needed it like he’d never needed anything before. “So good,” Tony groaned, shoving into Steve with little control now. He was mumbling a stream of words against Steve’s throat, but he was too far gone to really make sense of any of them.
Steve nodded, as if the information didn’t surprise him much. “Right. I think it’s obvious that I’m not the Steve of your time. I’m from 2022.”
“I know,” Bucky said and grinned self-deprecatingly. “Seems like I can’t keep the bad guys outta my head.”
it, really, even more urgently than he thought to. They had only ever managed to see each other on the weekends, and sometimes not even that, and if there was one thing he really wanted in the next five years—and longer still—it was to wake up next to Steve every morning.
Tony offered a whimper and pleadingly thrust forward. “Anything,” he said automatically, because at this point, he really wasn’t picky. Even just touching Steve, his own arousal be damned, seemed like a great idea right now. As long as he finally got to be near him,
It was tempting. Not so much because he wanted to bring all of them in front of a Jury—he’d never wanted that—more because he hated knowing that they were all somewhere at the end of the world, hiding from
“You deserve it. Ian, he is…” Natasha trailed off, and shook her head, chuckling as she searched for a word. “He’s something else.”
He loved the arc reactor as well, but mostly as a humming sound when he was already close to dropping. And he definitely wasn’t ready to drop now.
,” he admitted, refusing to get more specific at this point. “Not really something to get excited about just yet. Not like we’ll actually reach a decision tomorrow. It’s… all a little complicated.”
Sam cleared his throat. “Uh, I know I have zero idea about what’s going on here but… Steve was born in the 20s, right? How’s it possible that his friend’s still up and around? Shouldn’t he be… I don’t know… ninety or something? Definitely not shooting people.”
After a moment, Barnes nodded and picked up the pen fixed to the stack of papers. He frowned at the post-its for a long moment, before he seemed to understand they were pointing to the signature lines. “I don’t remember my signature.”
"I was gonna…" Steve gestured at the piece of paper vaguely. "I was gonna get rid of that and ask you properly. I…" He ducked his head. "I wrote you a note at home, I'm guessing you didn't find it, huh?"
“So you just told yourself there was no reason to try and that was that,” Tony concluded, sounding angry. He remained still for a long, pregnant moment. Then, something in his eyes shifted. “You said something about sparring the other day? Let’s do that.”
Natasha already waited for him, and with a smile, she pressed a steaming cup of coffee into his hands. He nodded his thanks and took a sip.
“Mmm,” Tony murmured, his eyes fluttering shut, enjoying the soft caresses Steve played across his neck. “That feels nice.”
“Business thing,” he said, and made to stand up again. He walked over to their dressing room and dug around in Ian’s drawer for a clean nightgown. He turned around holding up two different pairs of cartoon themed rompers—each one a gift from Clint—displaying them for his little one’s choice. “So buddy, Captain America or… I don’t even know what this one is.”
Tony’s face flushed a bit at the compliment and he tried to cover it up with an unimpressed huff. “He’s always showing me off,” he explained with an exaggerated sigh as he trailed after the two men. Steve sure had a nice backside, Tony noted, especially when he leaned down to lift the new fume hood.
“Time went faster there, then,” Bruce conjectured. Steve only now saw him standing a little ways off, leaning against the wall. He looked disheveled, as if he hadn’t slept or even changed clothes in days.
“It’s gotten worse in the last week. I ordered a few pain killers—homeopathic stuff,” Tony added hastily at Steve’s raised brow, “and toys and whatnot. Vi said he took the cake in this department, most of the time, it’s not that bad for babies.”
Tony scanned the schematic the HUD showed him, and his eyes widened at the first rough estimation to how far into the earth this machine went.
He wouldn’t, though. He had long ago figured out that there was no such thing as ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. And the last thing Tony needed at present was another reminder of what they’d both lost in this war. Thus, he only held up a hand with dry indifference. “My advice, then,” he replied monotonously. “Find someone who cares for what you have to say. We had the chance to talk. You didn’t take it.”
Steve only rolled his eyes, but Tony could feel him smiling as he wrapped his lips around his head once more. A groan spilled from Tony’s lips as Steve’s tongue found a particularly sensitive vein, and he was about to open his mouth to say more, but in that moment, the alarm above their heads started to blare.
Tony nodded in acknowledgement. He’d decided not to announce his plans of surprising Steve tonight. Announcing it usually meant that something would turn up on a last minute’s notice. One of them would get called away, and they wouldn’t see each other for yet another week.
When he’d reached his goal, Steve groaned when he realized that Tony had already pushed three fingers into himself, rocking back against the movement in steady thrusts.
“Maybe it’s not,” Steve amended. “But Obadiah is controlling you. Don’t you see that? He exploited your weakness after her death, trying to lead the company as his own. And now that you want to take back control, he’s looking for ways to stop you.”
Steve nodded, wanting to believe that so badly. He dropped down on his back next to Tony, a breathless laugh escaping his lips. “I just… I still can’t believe this,” he said. “I’ve only been here for a few days, but… I don’t know how I can stand having you hate me again.”
daily affair,” he said, his voice amiable even as his words knocked the wind out of Steve’s chest. “Again: I mean no offence. Mrs. Stark always inspired Tony in his newest creations. The two spent hours upon hours in his workshop. She was his muse, he often said.” He sighed pointedly. “He stopped inventing after she died. And… well, I don’t think a kid from Brooklyn will change that. Tony only brought you here to distract himself a little, so let us not get carried away, alright?”
More and more memories assaulted him: terrified faces, screams of agony. Beneath them, the ashes and the dirt of the battle vanished in the drain. And when Steve looked at Tony, he could see it in his eyes: He would offer no sweet words to make it better, and Steve was glad for it. It just proved what Tony had already promised—that no matter what, Steve would have his honesty.
“Nah, it’s okay, stuff happens. Guess we’re just not used to Mommy and Daddy fighting. You and Tony are the strongest… assets we have, Thor aside, maybe. You can’t quit on us now. Can’t defeat a murder robot with a bow and arrow, Cap.”
Steve thought for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah, SHIELD was pretty thorough, but I can’t catch any diseases anyway.”
Bucky and Tony were busy fighting to Steve’s right. He could see another man with dark skin and longer hair, and a muscled, blonde woman.
“Can’t we do this tomorrow?” Steve asked, sighing. “I’m not really in the mood for an intervention.”
When Tony’s hands pressed into his ass, Steve bit his shoulder involuntarily, and his whole body jerked as he groaned aloud.
“So far it looks good,” Tony said with a slight shrug that didn’t look too convinced. “People seem to realize I actually have something to offer in return.”
“Absolutely not.” Tony took a deep breath. “But he’s right. It’s about the team, and about Sokovia. It’s about Wakanda and Lagos and Vienna and New York. And it’s…” He swallowed, hating how his voice was breaking a little. “And it’s our only option.”
The words might have sounded threatening—and perhaps, in a way, Bucky had even meant for them to be. But they also came out softer than anything Bucky had said to him so far, almost conversational, and much calmer than Steve actually felt. Dropping the jeans back into the drawer, Steve raised both hands in surrender. “I’m not used to being all that careful at home.”
As if on cue, one of the baby’s hands settled on top of the arc reactor, and the wails died down somewhat. Tony tried to tell himself the gesture wasn’t turning him into a puddle of over-emotional goo. Quickly, he brushed a hand over the baby’s butt, finding it dry.
There was about a two-point-five-seconds pause, before Tony spoke up again. “Fuck, but I’ll love seeing you hold our child,” he blurted, then whimpered when Steve tenderly rubbed the head.
"I didn't think you'd be the kind of person to do that, that's why I—" Steve bit his tongue and shook his head. "It was a misunderstanding." His eyes closed and finally, the exhaustion that had been pushed back again and again this night would be held back no longer. The mission had been taxing, and then Tony had come over and that… well, involved considerable exertion of the best kind.
There it was, plain as day: their wedding picture. There was Steve, and Tony—wearing matching tuxes—, and next to them: Bucky and Rhodey as their best men.
“Don’t ruin the moment,” Natasha chided and leaned back against Bucky, who only smiled at Steve in the most easy-going way he’d seen him smile since he’d join their team. Bucky reached for his beer and raised it in Steve’s direction, quietly toasting him with the bottle.
Steve swallowed down a small lump that had formed in his throat. He’d never stop blaming himself for what happened that day, his complete and utter failure to protect his best friend. At the time, he’d thought that if it came down to it, he’d willingly die to protect every single one of his teammates, and that it was Bucky he’d lost… it still drove him crazy.
It came from the front, a leap forward with one leg extended. His metal-shod foot caught Steve in the throat and sent him crashing to the floor. He rolled away a second before Rumlow’s fist struck, and it came down next to Steve with a force that made the ground rattle.
. Releasing a frustrated sigh, Steve raised his head to the comm. “Guys, we have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage.”
his pants. God, he hadn’t realized how fast Tony could move. “No. No! Tony, no! We can’t do this now.”
When Tony handed it over, looking confused, Bucky quickly swiped through menus and typed something in. Then, he handed it back. "That's my number. Call me when you've got a prototype for me to try."
“Tony wasn’t exactly known to have, well, ‘steady relationships’ as long as I’d known him, but with Indries… I don’t know how she did it. I think it was easy for her to keep him entertained since she loved throwing parties…” Rhodey sighed and gazed wistfully towards the ocean. “And when she wasn’t planning an event, she would go sailing with her friends or travelling to Los Angeles or other cities.”
After one more hop, he deposited Ian on the bed in a giggling heap, then jumped on after him and pushed his rompers to the side, nuzzling his bare tummy, blowing loud raspberries on it.
Once Steve arrived at the Triskelion, Extremis live-streamed his speech to all SHIELD communication systems. The moment his voice echoed over every single speaker in the room, Tony was just finishing up the last upgrades on Sam’s left wing. JARVIS had analyzed all the smaller weaknesses that could be repaired on such a short notice, and Tony had set to work.
He brushed a light kiss over Tony’s lips, trembling at the wealth of emotion that sparked through his skin at the contact. And he wished so much they could just go home now, go back to their imperfect-perfect life, but he also knew he had to make sure his friend was okay.
“We’re making friends everywhere we go,” Natasha muttered. As soon as they had raised their heads, Steve spotted a crying man on the floor in the middle of the room, and two things were perfectly clear.
here?” Bucky persisted. “You brought me out. Why aren’t you leaving? You shouldn’t be here, you should be with your family, with your
“I’m trying to do you a favor here,” he said with a slightly gentler tone. “And by doing so, I’m taking a lot on faith. The least you could do is hear me out.”
Tony shook his head before his eyes misted. The pain in his chest expanded, creeping over his heart and nearly sending him to his knees. He didn’t know how he stood without shaking. His bones rattled and his muscles felt inches away from slipping off entirely.
“You did,” Tony confirmed. At first, he wanted to leave it at that, but his heart wouldn’t let him. “But… there’s still plenty he will learn in the next months.”
“You said you were going camping,” Tony said easily. “I was down in my shop, and then I thought—hey, that’s actually a good idea. I hate staying at the mansion and I always wanted to go camping, you know—with actual camping equipment.”
Tony shrugged. “We left him on the side of the road to find his way home. Figured the fresh air would do him good.”
As soon as the words were out of Tony’s mouth, he got so red Steve was worried for a second that he’d pass out.
The next second, though, the zipper of the tent was lowered and Carol was staring right at them, her eyes wide and apologetic. “Oh God! Sorry!” She took a second before taking in the whole scene. “Con-grat-ulations?” she asked, then sniffed the air. Steve felt his face heat. The scent was probably unmistakable. Next to him, Tony snorted softly and looked down with noted embarrassment.
“I think I’m about as far from alright as anyone could be right now. The way he looked at me when I said his name…
Tony nodded and closed his faceplate. There would be enough time to deal with this. Enough time to get over the fact that there was a time and place in the universe where Steve had wanted to marry him.
Tony swallowed, and exhaled a shaky breath, glancing at Steve with a little more color on his face. “Everything you hear these days is a throwback to a bygone era, no matter how much they try to spice it up and call it ‘modern.’ It’s all been done before. At least the bands I listen to were innovative.”
After yet another hearing in DC about Barnes’ involvement with HYDRA, he’d taken the suit, flew halfway round the globe to Moscow just to retrieve some old files, and came right back to New York. And now, instead of getting some much needed rest, he needed Barnes to sign the damn Avengers contract, or the guy would likely go to prison very fucking soon.
Bucky nodded his head. “Alright,” he replied. Together, he and Bucky hurried back to the elevators. The sky outside was clouded by a layer of smog. Just gray clouds that glazed over every building in a never-ending blanket. Stepping out of the facility, Steve looked down on the streets—watched the people that knew nothing of the subhuman existence that might endanger them all. First New York, Washington, then Wakanda. And all of those little villages in Eastern Europe afterwards. Casualties had always been much too high whenever they had encountered a super villain. And Steve had a feeling today wouldn’t be any different.
There were steps behind them and Steve smiled at Scott as he got out of the van as well. Clint had called an hour ago, telling him that Scott had agreed to join their group. Apparently Sam knew him from a few months ago though he refused to go into detail. Still, Steve had a good feeling with him.
Steve nodded. “I… I thought about going to the tower, or the facility, or intercept you on the way here, but I didn’t wanna come if I wasn’t welcome. This is neutral ground.” He shrugged somewhat. “And I wasn’t sure if my code’s still valid.”
In the matter of a second, Tony stood in front of Bucky, the gauntlet smashing into his face once, twice, before its palm was directed straight at his head—the repulsor gleaming deadly. And Bucky—Bucky just looked up at Tony from where he was heavily leaning against the wall, and he didn’t even raise his arms in defense.
Tony held his gaze a moment longer, before he leaned sideways. “Hold that thought,” Tony said. Steve let himself fall on his back as he looked after him. He rummaged through something in his drawer, and then held up a small bottle and a little plastic package.
Behind Tony, Vision, Rhodey and Natasha stepped out of the jet, followed by a gangly kid who looked around with widened eyes. It took Steve a moment to put two and two together, since he’d never met the guy, but it could only be Peter Parker.
,” he added. He used the towel to rub the oil off his feet and came to a stand. “I see you brought in strays again,” he added quietly, his eyes set on the Maximoff twins. “Didn’t we say Barnes was the last one? I’m pretty sure we’re out of rooms.”
The covers were pushed aside and Steve urged Tony to let go of himself so he could take his place. "Tell me if you need me to stop at any point." He was stroking him slowly. There was no turning back for him now. If Tony didn't stop him, they were going to go all the way.
Tony moaned and squirmed beneath Steve. “I was busy being completely sexed out, thanks very much. Give an old man a break, will ya?”
Tony closed his fingers around Steve’s and stroked the back of his hand. It had been driving him nuts. All the different ways and possibilities this meeting could go wrong. But despite how nervous he was about today, he wanted nothing more than to get this over with.
“We’re here to talk about the cause of death of Indries Stark. I wasn’t familiar with the events so far, but as I was informed by Agent Romanoff, the previous cause of death was thought to be drowning at sea.” Fury looked down at a stack of papers. He leaned back, then eyed them critically. “I know Mister Stark identified another woman as his wife, but I think we can all agree that traumatic events, such as losing a loved one, can mess with your judgment, right?”
Wondering if there was any chance at all the universe wouldn’t take this from him before it even started.
There was a moment of mutual contemplation, before Steve traced one dried trail of blood on Tony’s cheek with his fingertip. “Is there anything I can do?” he asked. “Hate to see you hurting.”
How Steve ever managed to get Tony out of his tux without rendering it useless, he didn’t know. It was a fast, fumbling job—while Tony was busy peppering Steve’s neck with love bites that would fade within minutes. By the end of it, Tony was buck-naked as they were tumbling into the penthouse.
“I…” He cleared his throat and took a deep breath. “I lied about that. I, uh, only ever did it once, you know? And being the traditionalist that he was, he had me go through the great fun of getting fucked almost-dry and with about zero prep.” Tony was staring pointedly at his feet, but even in the darkness, Steve could see that his cheeks were tomato-red. “I don’t want to kill the mood or anything, I’m just… I wanted you to know, that… I’m not like that. Easy, I mean… I haven’t—”
Glancing over to where Obi’s knocked-out form was still lying on the workshop couch, Tony couldn’t hold back a small chuckle. This was just… hilarious, on so many levels. How Steve had gone into rage-mode and socked one right into Obi’s face about five minutes after meeting him… it was something that would be on Tony’s mind for a whole long while.
“Tony is about to get approval for a new draft of the Sokovia Accords. One that I believe will be something we can all agree to. But we won’t do it if any of you aren’t on board with it. This is a team decision.”
He hesitated on that thought. Whatever that conversation had been about, it had really gotten Tony riled up. Even from the door Steve could see him still panting with his rage.
“It makes you stronger?” Steve asked warily. He hoped Tony wasn’t in constant pain, but his features looked relaxed enough, his breathing not as deep as it could be, but not too shallow either.
“Well… Natasha’s here with me, and she said that Tony showed up at the penthouse. He threw Bucky and Sam out. And Nat, too. She said he seemed pretty shaken and I’m… worried.”
“After New York, I convinced the World Security Council that we need a quantum surge on threat analysis. For once we’re way ahead of the curve.”
If Steve was dead, Tony didn’t know how to keep going. No matter how horrible the fight between them had been, Tony had always found a strange kind of solace in the knowledge that Steve was still
“Enough!” Steve used his best drill sergeant voice, which he had perfected over the last months since he’d started training their new team members. “Wanda, Pietro, stay. The rest of you—upstairs. I think that’s enough for today.”
He was stretching himself, Steve realized. And the sight surely was too much for one human mind to handle. All that olive skin, that arch of his body, the wings—
He started to trash against his restraints, eager to leave that foul, claustrophobic place and to find some fresh air. Yet when he tried, he realized that he could not sit up. There was little more than a four-inch gap between his face and the lid of the box in which he now resided. Because it was a box, he realized. A box made out of metal he could not open, could not break through. There was some sort of spyhole right in front of his face, a window so thick with ice that looking through it was impossible.
“I trust you,” Steve repeated and cast him a smile that looked a bit strained. “I think I don’t tell you enough. And I just want you to know that you can trust me, too. You can talk to me… about whatever’s on your mind.”
, wasn’t he? He’d done this the adult way, for once in his life, trying to get closure, be nice about it, even while everything inside him was screaming and crying and hating the world that the first damn time he’d fallen in love his feelings were very much rejected.
Tony winced when the HUD listed the kinds of weapons they were unleashing on Bruce, but he knew the Hulk could take it. And just as Bruce had promised, Ross’ focus was now kind of single-minded.
It was the hardest thing he’d ever done, letting go of the shield’s leather straps, hearing it toppling against the metal bars beneath him, before it rushed down into the water. Because… it did not only mean surrendering to everything Bucky would do to him, it also meant—in some parts—that he was letting Tony down.
“Ah,” Steve said, taking a deep breath, not knowing what to think about that. “And you’re telling me that, why?”
Slowly, Steve brushed a finger along Tony’s cheekbone and he… wondered. He wondered about the same thing he’d wondered about for the last few days. Had Tony really done it? Had he really killed his wife as he’d told him?
he remembered Tony telling him, only one day ago, on the balcony of his penthouse. Steve also remembered his own answer.
Peggy had left only a few moments ago, and a part of Steve longed for her to hold him and keep the pain away, but he knew as soon as he closed his eyes, Tony’d be there. When he closed his eyes tonight, he’d be there. Tony would be there. Waiting for him.
Tony chuckled. “I didn’t build a time machine. We met someone called Doctor Strange. Giant asshole. I’m sure he’ll love to tell you more about it, but… It was a one-man-show, sorry.”
“I think that’s why I didn’t realize it at first,” Steve went on. “Looking at a fella got you into trouble real fast, and I was supposed to find a girl and marry her, but I didn’t want to. I didn’t know what I wanted until I knew you.” He leaned back a little so he could put his hand on top of the arc reactor; his fingers brushing lightly over its surface. It threw a soft blue light against Steve’s skin and suddenly, that last missing puzzle piece fell into place as well.
“It’s getting worse,” he confirmed after a moment. “One of the surveillance cameras got a photo of the attacker. They’re about to announce it.”
Natasha smiled, nodded, and leaned down to press a light kiss on his forehead. Then, she left the room.
It made guilt bloom in Steve's chest, and he closed his eyes. "I'm sorry," he said quietly. If he'd been able to control himself and not jump to Tony's supposed rescue like a goddamn guard dog, things may have been salvageable, but as it was…
“No,” Steve declared. “I just shared a secret, and a pretty personal one, I might add. Now it’s your turn.”
Pepper chuckled quietly, and Tony could just imagine her sitting in Stark Industries’ glass high rise in Malibu, impeccably dressed in Chanel, Manolo Blahniks crossed under her enormous mahogany desk. The telephone was likely cradled gently to her ear—she despised earpieces—; staring out the window of her corner office; the small frown line between her eyes becoming more pronounced. Tony knew that line intimately, having been the cause of it more than once.
Tony smiled, and even with the black eyes, he somehow managed to look immensely smug. “Remember the ‘ally’ Nick talked about? The guy protecting the nuclear codes? The one who revoked Bucky’s house arrest?” He grinned proudly. “I found him.”
"Bucky…" Steve groaned. He leaned back when Bucky sat next to him and turned to meet his laughing eyes. "You can't say things like that… I already feel like a goddamn pervert."
Steve nodded his head and then reached up to take one of Tony's hands in his. "We have time to work on that."
Ant-Man frowned, and yelped as the rocket hit him. It catapulted his re-sized form right into Peter’s hands, who immediately webbed him to the ground.
Vision smiled, and he realized it was likely the first smile ever to reach his lips since he’d been transformed into this strange body.
With a thousand heartbeats at once, he leaned in and let his mouth finally cover Tony’s. The first brush of lips almost had Steve shaking out of his skin, but then, they both took a deep breath and
“’Course you didn’t. I made them long before I became Iron Man,” Tony explained. “As I said, they never made it past prototype. Obviously, I could do much better today, but at the time, those babies were badass.”
Their endless sessions of deactivating Barnes’ mental implants were finally over—and whatever Barnes was doing from here on, it was his own doing. That, however, didn’t stop Steve from guarding him like a watch dog, doing the majority of the surveillance without complaint.
this. His muscles kept contracting around Steve to make it as good as possible, as he kept rising and sinking down again. “Just a little more,” he whispered. “You can do it.”
Bucky shook his head at Steve. “And how do you know that your presence won’t make it worse?” he asked. “If you get caught up in the fire, you’ll tear the whole team apart, Steve… Me, I… I don’t matter that much.”
Aside from the one time Steve had mentioned Barnes in a side comment, which had resulted in harsh words and a week of Tony not even looking at the phone, they had managed not to set the minefield ablaze too often.
“My face doesn’t talk.” Steve paused, his brows bunching together contemplatively. “All right, it does, but—”
Steve groaned, but turned around anyway and leaned over the back of the seat. He flicked open Tony’s phone after Tony had told him the code (it was Jarvis’ birthday, and Steve would’ve remembered it anyway), and scrolled through the playlist.
It was Rhodey who broke the spell surrounding them. “So let me get this straight: We potentially have both the UN and Steve’s team to contend with. If we stop Steve’s team, they will all go to jail. And if we don’t stop them, there might be no more superheroes altogether.”
He took a breath, trying to ignore Steve’s intense stare, then handed Barnes the blueprint. “If you let me take your measurements today, I could have a first prototype by the end of the month.”
“Yeah, he got off the grid. I was sure we had him—for a moment, but he managed to escape.” Steve’s heaved a low breath. “Wish we could’ve put an end to this. Now we have to start all over again.”
Tony’s tongue darted out and wet his lips as he nodded. He turned around, casting Steve a lingering look as he kneeled down next to the bench, putting both elbows up on its surface.
Tony shook his head as if to clear it, then raised a hand to rub at his eyes. “I’m not processing things properly. Uh, give me a moment.”
“Easy as breathing, I promise,” Tony said, reaching for one of Steve’s hands. He pressed a kiss to its palm, and then—because it was Tony and the guy just couldn’t give you a moment to gather yourself, dammit—he moved forward, until the tip of Steve was already pressing inside.
Steve’s hands curled under Tony’s shoulders, with his legs entwined around Steve’s waist as he pushed his hips into Steve’s with heady, desperate gasps. He was moving against his erection in long strokes, and it was quickly driving Steve out of his mind.
“Good,” he murmured, feeling the exhaustion spreading through every cell of his body. “Wanna keep you.”
“Talk to me, Tony,” Steve prompted as he stepped up next to the couch, kneeling down. He had half a mind to simply rip the towel off of Tony’s face, but ultimately decided against it. “What happened here?”
It was a stupid question because Steve should've known by now that this would happen, should've kept his distance, and he should know
, Tony didn’t feel any need to hurry this along. The finger went in relatively easy now, and Tony circled it inside Steve, moving just a bit deeper with every thrust. Only when Steve started to squirm a little, as if he was getting just the tiniest bit impatient, ever so subtly moving with Tony’s movements, did Tony push in fully, hitting home for the first time and coaxing a beautifully surprised moan off of Steve’s lips.
He didn't regret it. Every experience had given Steve more knowledge on the activity, allowing him to be good enough for Tony when they hooked up. That didn't mean Steve would've let just anyone into his body. It had to have been someone special, truly close to Steve, and if he was completely honest with himself, he’d never thought it would actually happen.
The world’s leading scientists would be wetting themselves by now, Tony thought on an amused snort, but sure, ‘impressive’ worked, too.
“Uh, Steve?” Tony suddenly asked, and when Steve looked at him in confusion, he was pointing to the distant horizon. Steve followed the line of Tony’s finger and he saw a streak of green…
At first, neither of them spoke. Tony seemed uneasy, and his gaze shifted from Steve’s face down to his hands. “You’re hurt.” His voice was low, almost casual, as he caressed the scraped knuckles.
Gritting his teeth, Tony pushed forward. He found the core of Ultron’s system, and logged into it. His hands were wound around Ultron’s throat as he looked down into the flickering red eyes, and it was in that moment when his grand plan became perfectly clear.
have your memories. The look in your eyes right now. The way… you sometimes go where I can’t follow. And there’s nothing I can do or say to make it better.” He threw his arms up in frustration. “And even if there was, I wouldn’t know what to say. I don’t understand why you chose
After merging the Mind Stone with JARVIS’ matrix, both Wanda and Pietro had agreed to join the fight. While Steve had briefed them and Vision about the team’s usual MO, Tony had given Barnes’ broken arm a quick once-over. Ultron had basically torn the thing’s software apart, and while Tony could easily re-install a backup, it would take a good few hours to really fine-tune the settings.
Steve followed them with his eyes before waving as well. “Good night,” he murmured, smiling into the darkness.
Watching with rapt interest as Steve leaned off the bed, Tony reached for his own pants. He shoved both the pajama bottoms and his briefs down and away, deciding then and there that they’d done enough teasing for one night.
Steve chuckled, his hand gently slapping Tony’s rump. “You know how it is: Bad pennies, they keep coming back anyway.”
“It’s pretty deep,” Steve murmured. “It may leave a mark. I can’t remember seeing it on you.” He sighed deeply. “Another change I caused.”
, he thought. Dating a teenager should've made him more cautious, but that wasn't something to dwell on right now.
—but he found himself moving with Tony in no time. He followed him whenever he started to slide away, determined to keep him where he wanted him. Tony’s tongue rubbed his underside almost roughly, then took time to skim the length of him as Steve pumped himself between his lips.
apparently killed his parents. He refused to go out of the way to get on Barnes’ good side. Either Barnes took what he offered him, or he didn’t. Easy as that.
Steve let himself drop down on his back, pulling Bucky with him and changing his hold so he could choke him in earnest. The second he lost consciousness, Steve let go, grabbed for the chip and ran.
Was it his friends that brought this out? Steve wished he knew. But whatever it was, he never wanted to spoil this moment for him—to shut out the light and bring back the darkness.
“It has to be you,” Strange told Tony. “Or the Captain. But as we both know, we can’t be sure he’s even still alive.”
Suddenly, Steve stepped into the room. His bruises had faded by now, and still… he looked dead-tired, like he hadn’t slept ever since he’d returned from hospital. And seeing how he was sort of sleeping on the cot in front of Bucky's room these days, that was likely true. His spirits were clearly up, though, and his eyes flashing. “This place is my home, Maria,” he snapped. “
"Alright," Steve said after a sigh. He couldn't refuse that pleading, almost desperate look in Tony's eyes. He had an inkling sense that that in itself might become a problem one day, but right now, he couldn’t care less. "Alright," he repeated. "Let's do that, for now." And he leaned in again to kiss Tony more fully. Any minute they weren't kissing felt like a waste of their time together.
“I have to go to the city for a few days,” he told him. “A business meeting. Obi insists I should go myself.”
Steve nodded slowly, more to himself than anything else. “Um, there’s nothing wrong with my taste in music. Just because it’s not older than I am…”
Things would look better tomorrow, he thought as he changed into his pyjama pants. Brandt would accompany him to Washington where he’d be doing his first show under the identity of
space, the one place where no one gave him the side-eye for being too young—and for being who he was in general.
“He never would’ve seen daylight again,” Steve shot back loudly. “With the act set in place, they would’ve thrown him into some cell and let him rot there! That’s worse than death, for something that was out of his control from the start! You
He knew where the shooter was heading, though, and if he managed to jump on the adjoining building, they’d be on the same level. Steve pushed himself forward, and just as he expected it—the roof proved to be a dead-end. Steve ran towards the next window front and held the shield in front of his body, before jumping against the glass. It burst into a Million shards, sending him onto the pavement. He fell and only just managed to roll himself back on his feet, before the man was already sprinting towards the edge. And Steve did the only thing left, and flung his shield at him with full speed.
feel a lot like lover’s grief by now and also because the damn chocolate was delicious. “I planned to talk to him about it, it just didn’t seem the right time until now. We… Tony and I, we have a few big decisions coming up and…” He cleared his throat, meeting Bucky’s contemplative eyes. “I’m just not sure it’s the right time. Extremis is really helpful most of the time. And I know it’s important to him.”
There was the tiniest smile playing with his lips as he looked up to the second figure in the painting—a man who was covered in shadow. He stood over Tony, apparently unseen, his posture a little hunched, as if he was slowly leaning down, one arm reaching towards Tony. His fingers were only inches from his cheek.
Fury’s single eye was mostly swollen shut and he was covered in a thin sheen of sweat. “I told Pierce to delay Project Insight. You were right, there were some… discrepancies.” Fury sighed and pointed at his face. “Apparently, he showed little interest in following through with his promise.”
“Don’t!” Steve said, and raised a hand in a defensive gesture. He shook his head, once more staring at the feathers that still littered the floor. They were softly glowing despite of the blood soaking into their white fabric.
As expected, every time he opened his eyes now, Steve came into view. It had started a few days ago. Steve just sat there on one of the benches, all goddamn day. Sometimes he’d bring a book, or warm his hands on some steaming cup, while talking to one of his team members. Mostly, though, Steve stared at him.
, Tony answered after a moment, and the next second, Steve saw a pulse wave leaving the building, sending a vibration through the grounds.
“No. Should be another half hour.” He glanced down at his watch, and groaned. Well, that obviously wasn’t half an hour.
Steve didn’t have to look too closely to see that the tanks had been emptied. The liquid was halfway gone, pooled on the floor in front of them, but the figures inside the tanks were clearly… dead. Their slumped bodies half drifted in the water, half leaned against the glass containers. As far as he could see, there were no shot wounds, no sign of any violence. There was no way to see what had happened to them.
“I know the window’s in the back is too small for you to climb out,” Steve called back, then set down on the sofa. “I’m not gonna leave.”
That was a matter of opinion, but Tony didn’t feel like arguing. Instead, he turned to Pepper, when she walked back into the room, tension rolling off her shoulders. “Did you talk to Vi?”
Steve nodded at that, because of course it would be SHIELD, goddamnit, then he put his hands on both of Tony’s shoulders, shaking him out of—wherever he was. “We gotta get out of here right now,” he ordered. “Not up for discussion. Come on.”
“You wouldn’t,” Tony retorted, and he perked his brows with witless irony. “That’s the problem with us. You would do it all over again.” He let that thought sink in. “And so would I.”
Tony took a moment to enjoy the sight of him walking away before he let Mark XLVIII materialize around his wrists and chest. Then, he followed, entering the Quinjet just behind Steve.
“Don’t know,” Tony replied and he had a look in his eyes as though he had just come awake after decades of darkness.
"Not a ghost," Steve countered. "Just…" He waved a hand vaguely. "I dreamed about you this morning… Thought about calling. So, just a bit strange to see you now. How've you been?"
This place was beyond anything he’d ever come across, beyond anything his imagination could come up with, and despite Steve’s limited knowledge of the technology behind it, he also suspected it was way past today’s standard.
Tony directed the Iron Man suit north, then took the first exit into Eastern Market. He flew up Pennsylvania Ave, turning onto Capitol Hill. Smoothly, he cut a corner between two buildings and came to a stop on the next crossroad, hovering in the air.
“That’s not the point!” His shout rolled through the sleepy morning silence of Sam’s garden, shocking Natasha into stillness. “Bucky is my
Tony stayed with the others for a while longer, listening to their excited babbling and strategizing, before he excused himself.
“I didn’t book a return flight,” Steve said. He came to a halt a few inches away from Tony, obviously unsure of what to do next. “I figured you’d tell me when I wasn’t welcome.”
He closed his eyes, trying to just let the blackness take him, but he wasn’t quite there, yet. Steve held onto him, whispering words into his ear, probably trying to get him to focus on something else, but Tony was already too fuzzy to tell him he needn’t bother. When Bruce finally got a good grip on the blade and started to pull, Tony bucked against the bed beneath him. Goddammit, there really was something about the feeling of cold metal slicing against your insides.
“Done and done, Sir,” FRIDAY replied dutifully from Tony’s phone speakers. “Miss Klein is waiting outside to bring the little master home. Should I tell her to wait?”
Before falling in love with Steve, Tony had never spent more than a few minutes worrying extendedly about anything or anyone. Everything had either fallen at a general give-or-take level of acceptance, or he’d simply changed whatever he hadn’t liked. Now, though, he could worry for hours and it still wasn’t enough.
Taking a sip from his tumbler, Tony chuckled at his own dark thoughts and let his head fall back against the armchair. He knew it was pathetic. Sitting here in what was left of the New Avengers facility, spending days staring at old photographs and sleeping on beds full of rubble and ashes.
“It’s my fault because I knew what he would do.” He spoke aloud, Tony realized too late, and although he didn’t turn his head to look, he could sense Rhodey twisting in his swivel chair, his eyes slightly surprised.
Tony grimaced at Steve as he wiped the water out of his eyes. “There’s a too many gray hairs that beg to differ. So—definitely too old to camp in the wilderness. My back’s killing me. And I would give my whole fortune for a toothbrush.”
“I wager you’re gonna piss me off at some point, again,” Tony mused, as Steve eventually pulled out slowly and flopped down on the bed next to him.
Either would be fine, really, but so far, none of the above had happened. Steve was only giving him these looks. These long inquisitive looks, and it was slowly driving Tony insane.
“Everything. What I’ve done. It’s like watching myself doing all these things.” Barnes released a long, quivering sigh. “I feel everything I felt then, but it’s… it’s different now. Worse, in so many ways.” The word came out as if pained; Tony could see him wincing as he spoke.
“I saw… that this was what we’d need,” he replied. “Doesn’t matter if what the Maximoff girl showed me was real, I
. Not you… or the home you’ve made with me… and definitely not this child. Not after everything I’ve put the Sokovians and the whole world through. But I’m gonna do right by you… and by this baby. I swear I will.”
“How about we get out of here,” Tony suggested eventually, and Steve’s eyes snapped up to him so fast he must’ve been getting whiplash. “Not… like that,” he amended, sighing heavily. “Just, we can grab a cab together? I could bring you home. I think you've had enough, Picasso.
“He looks more like you every day,” Tony whispered after a few moments of comfortable silence. He didn’t sound reproachful; instead he regarded Ian’s sleeping face with pure adoration. A smirk appeared on his lips. “He’ll have your jaw, for sure.”
Tony said, smiling fondly as he reached out in his mind. On a second thought, he took control of both DUM-E’s claw and camera, lowering the first until he was brushing cautiously along Steve’s forehead. Steve’s nose wrinkled slightly, but after a moment, he was leaning into the touch. Low murmurs left his lips, as he settled into the cushions more firmly, and Tony was almost sure he’d heard his name somewhere in-between.
“Maybe that’s your problem. Or one of them,” Barnes said, letting the words linger in the air, and with a sigh, he picked up another cotton swab, winced at the thick smell of antiseptic, and approached Tony tentatively. “Lean toward me and hold still.”
"Thanks," Steve said, then lifted the bottle to his lips. Harsh honesty had always been the way to go between them before the accident, and Steve, still getting used to having Bucky around after such a long time, appreciated the consistency. "Feel shittier."
. And he really needed to stop thinking in the terms of ‘this Steve’ and ‘his Steve’—they were both one and the same stubborn, opinionated man. “No chance of that,” he told Steve. “I tend to get a pouch-tummy.”
Tony ever since their return. After he’d left with Pepper and Rhodes, Steve hadn’t heard of him again. From Natasha, he knew that Tony’d agreed to hold a press conference about their fight against Thanos in a day or two, and from an offhanded comment from Peter to Vision, he had gathered that Tony was already back to tinkering in his makeshift workshop, designing tools and components for reconstruction work, building things for Stark Industries or working on Avengers gear.
He currently stood at the bar, watching the people mingle in the ballroom. Tony had to greet each of the guests, schmoozing his way around the room, and if Steve had ever doubted that Tony belonged in this world of glitz and glamour, he stood corrected now. Along the way, Tony introduced Steve to so many people he did not even bother trying to remember all their names. It didn’t matter anyway.
There was a sob mingling with the air and Steve realized with a certain amount of horror that it was
Steve exclaimed louder than he’d intended, and another breathy laugh escaped his lips. So Tony had told Bruce—even showed him—because he’d
"You know that I am," Steve answered, fastening both arms around Tony's waist now, to keep them close. He watched those beautiful brown eyes for a moment before nodding his head. "Guess we're in luck, since I feel the same."
No, it wasn’t the destruction of the city that disturbed him. He had seen too many horrible things to be shaken by broken buildings. No, it was the hoarse, strangled cries erupting from the streets. There were screams of anguish everywhere, almost animalistic sounds of pain and desperation. He supposed everyone had lost someone today, and New York… New York was in deep mourning.
Tony winced at first, then sighed when the icy cold water soothed his blistering skin. Steve was standing right behind him now, his body pressing into Tony’s body from shoulders to feet. And Tony really, really hated the way his body warmed and melted into Steve as if there was some foreign instinct kicking in.
The silence that settled thereafter was thick and more than a little disconcerting. Fury’s mouth formed a solemn line and he nodded tightly to himself. Manifest conviction clouded every strain on his face, before he glanced away to the Helicarriers. “SHIELD takes the world as it is, not as we’d like it to be. It’s getting damn near past time for you get with the program, Cap.”
He tuned out the muffled sound of their voices. He didn’t know what exactly had happened in Vienna. He knew the German GSG9 task force had been involved, and that there had been gunshots, and a mysterious guy in a goddamn cat-suit—Tony had barely understood what Ross had been ranting about when he had called half an hour ago. It was almost like they’d been having two or three different conversations at the same time.
If Tony would look sideways, he was sure Steve was looking at him like some cute Golden Retriever pub. Life was so unfair.
Tony shook his head and breathed out a laugh. “That’s long gone, Cap. I’m a free man.” Tony sat back down; Steve followed suit. “I’m sorry for being a dick. I just…I was worried. And under pressure. I guess from myself, but still.” Steve nodded with understanding, placing his hand on Tony’s and giving it a squeeze.
me, they were drunk. Not that that’s an excuse for anything, but I really wasn’t bothered.” After waiting for Tony to reply, Steve continued, “Are you listening to me?”
“You’re not getting the point. That’s not the part that’s upsetting me, what’s annoying is that you refuse to even talk about why it bugs you so much when that happens. Who cares if we get held up for a minute or two while someone takes pictures with us? We’re famous! You’re acting like a child, Tony.”
“Wh – Tony, are you serious? You’re acting like a total dick for no reason. Nothing out of the ordinary for you, but it gets old.”
Tony let out a shaky breath and nodded. He maintained his eye contact with Steve and was rewarded with touch again, his hips now moving with Steve’s strokes without his conscious effort. He felt himself flushing red across his face, ears, and chest. His breaths came faster and a bubbly sensation crept up from his lower belly. When Steve lifted his hand from Tony’s thigh and rubbed across his chest, Tony cried out and came, hard. His eyes screwed shut as Steve worked him through his orgasm, letting his voice wail unabashedly. When his breathing calmed down and his body began to feel heavy, he opened his eyes to look at Steve. He’d taken his hands off Tony and was licking off the cum from them, making Tony’s softening dick weakly twitch.
When Tony’s dick hardened and jolted in his mouth, Steve pulled back and stopped touching Tony. Tony groaned at the sudden disappearance of stimulation. “Come on, don’t do that to me, Steve.” He practically whimpered. “I’m not that far off.” Steve nodded and smiled, but sat next to Tony. He gestured for Tony to bring his legs back up onto the couch and Tony complied. Steve had Tony lay his legs across his lap, and pushed his chest back so he leaned against the arm of the sofa. Steve took Tony’s dick in his hand again and smiled as he said, “Sorry for the delay. I decided I want you to cum while I have you like this, instead.” With that, Steve started stroking him quickly. One hand worked his dick while the other moved to stroke the inside of his thighs. Tony was overwhelmed with the moment, naked physically and emotionally. It felt like Steve was looking right into him with his piercing gaze. Tony tried to look away but when he did, Steve immediately released his dick and grabbed his cheeks, pulling his face back toward him. “You have to look at me if you want me to continue, Tony.”
Tony rolled his eyes and huffed at the statement. “Only wanted a picture? Steve, they were freakin’ molesting you, it was weird.”
“I know I don’t have to. I want to.” Steve replied, almost a whisper. He moved back in, and this time kissed with more fervor. It wasn’t long before he pushed Tony down onto the couch more, boxing him in with his strong arms. Steve lowered one of his hands and let it creep inside Tony’s shirt, lifting the hem up a few inches. Tony broke their kiss to inhale, his breath catching as Steve stroked his side. He let out a quiet little sigh of pleasure, Steve taking the chance to nibble at his earlobe and drag the tip of his tongue down the side of Tony’s neck, leading closer to his collarbones. He nipped lightly at Tony’s collarbone, reveling in the little groan it procured. He bit it a little harder, Tony’s legs moving ever so slightly outward, making room for Steve’s body between them. At that, Steve sat back on his heels and lifted the hem of Tony’s shirt up. “Is this alright?” Steve checked, making eye contact with the flushed man beneath him. Tony nodded, choking out a little “…y-yes.” It was a little funny to see Tony like this. Usually the loudest, most confident in the room – now blushing and squirming under Steve’s minimal touch. Smirking, Steve pushed Tony’s t-shirt up and over his head and arms, dropping it on the floor next to them. Steve relished the view – he’d seen it before, but never like this. He traced the edge of the Arc Reactor and watched as it made Tony shiver a little. It must be sensitive. Steve dragged his fingers down further, watching as just his touch made Tony jump. “Been a while? You’re so worked up.” Steve teased, lightly going over Tony’s nipples to drive his point home. Tony moaned at that, his hips jolting upward.
friction. “You’re so responsive.” Steve remarked, reaching down between them and working to undo Tony’s belt buckle. He lifted Tony’s hips to get the belt off, setting it down next to them along with the discarded shirt. He flicked open the button on Tony’s pants and pushed them down, freeing his hard, red dick. Tony whined through his teeth at the sudden cool air, his dick jerking towards his stomach. Steve sighed. “So desperate, too. You’re lucky I’m a top. Come on, sit up.”
“I have to suck your dick to get you to say one nice thing about me? In that case, I wonder what I’ll have to do to get you to pay for dinner together.” He wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck and lowered his voice. “I guess I’ll just have to find out for myself.”
“It’s…been a little bit, yeah.” Tony admitted, resting his hands on Steve’s hips. “No need to be mean, are you gonna change that or just tease me?”
he hadn’t expected. And clearly, Steve hadn’t either. Tony screwed his eyes shut, trying to come up with a way to handle this.
“I know,” Tony said—he almost cooed. “I’m gonna suck you again, alright?” He took Steve’s hand in his and with a pointed look, he led him to the large bed.
did this—instead of approaching something at a reasonable pace, he dumped all of this on Steve’s shoulders and expected him to deal with it.
After breakfast, Tony and Clint both announced it was time for a movie marathon. Steve thought about objecting for a second—they all hadn’t slept for a day, and the mission reports needed to be written—but then… they hadn’t done this in weeks, months, probably. And spending a day eating junk food while bickering about movie choices sounded awfully good.
Steve sighed, rubbing his forehead. “Tell you what: You get a reward for paying attention to your meeting now, okay?”
“I’ll try my best,” Steve said, and made to turn around. Only then he remembered himself, and looked at Stephen Strange. “Thanks for getting us back.”
He lowered them both on the bed, not allowing an inch to come between them for even a second. All of Tony’s reactions were on autopilot. Steve met him for another fierce, hungry kiss, his mouth loving him for all he was worth. And just like that, the world around them vanished. The taste of Steve was in his mouth again, his tongue between his lips. Steve’s fingers tunneled through his hair, his teeth nipping at Tony’s lips, trying to consume him whole. And Tony was helpless to do anything but let him.
“Right.” Steve rearranged his hold on Tony and moved his hand downwards. “Better start practicing.”  He tugged Tony’s shirt out of his jeans, pulling it up and off, and tossing it to the floor.
“Good thinking.” He didn’t say anything for long moments, his eyes travelling slowly across Vision’s features. At first, his expression was very composed, almost detached. Then, it suddenly became very vulnerable.
In the last weeks, they’d had all too little time for these small signs of affection and now, the simplest touch had the power to make Steve lose all sense of his surroundings.
Tony’s eyes twinkled, and he leaned forward, suddenly taking Steve’s hand in his. “I’m asking you to come home with me. Hell, I would ask you to
“Uhm…” Tony eventually said, frowning at the paper once again. There were all those things written down there. Things like ‘Spend the rest of my life with you’ and ‘Don’t care about you zoning out over some project’ and ‘I’ll make you breakfast in the mornings for the rest of your life’ and half of it was crossed out again but at the end of the note, there was a big fat ‘Marry me?’ and there was really no way to misunderstand that.
Pietro and Sam had quietly listened to them, and now leaned over to Natasha to see the file they were talking about. “So what is this—they want to regulate us?” Pietro asked after a moment. “I don’t understand how that is supposed to work.”
Steve breathed in sharply, his heart in his throat. What he wanted was to tell Hammer to go without him—that he didn’t care to work for him in the first place, but it was no use. He needed the money.
. Bucky didn't know, did he? Steve hesitated apparently one beat too long because the next second there was a flicker of understanding in Bucky's eyes. "Oh," he said, then pressed on. "Was
“I’m sorry?” Tony asked, his eyes flickering to Bucky’s arm for a second before he looked back up. “What was that? I couldn’t hear you over the pot calling the kettle black.”
With an eye roll, Rhodey stood up. “I have infinite trust in the both of you to not kill us. Good night.” With that, he shuffled to the back of the RV, where his and Carol’s bed was located.
Cold seeped through Steve and then he couldn’t hold himself upright anymore. He couldn’t stand. He just fell down on the ground, leaning against the open cabinet.
“Did I interrupt something?” Vision asked, his tone curious as he watched the elevator’s doors close again. He walked around the barstool, looking at it for a long moment, before he sat down. He didn’t seem to find his balance right away, and Steve could practically hear the gears in his red head turning, before he put his feet on the footrest and started to swivel around a bit.
The smile he cast Steve was downright sinful, and Steve watched, completely transfixed, as Tony reached behind himself.
, as you always said. I would’ve turned the world upside down for you, then right side up again. I gave it my all—and my all wasn’t enough. How can you possibly believe you and I can make long-term work? That there is something to salvage between us, when it’s clear that being apart is the only thing that ever worked for us. I just… I want to, but I just don’t see it.”
Steve almost spoke upto tell Tony that he didn’t need to do anything he felt uncomfortable with, but then again… he
Wanda’s expression remained impassive, but Steve could’ve sworn one corner of her mouth ticked upwards all the same.
“Sleep,” Tony murmured and his hands continued to stroke leisurely down to Steve’s and back up to his neck in an endless, soothing loop.
He left the others behind. There would be another time to talk to them, preferably with Steve at his side. Right now, Tony didn’t want to deal with the questioning glances. The way Bruce looked at him like he’d lost his mind when he told him that he would take care of Steve. The way Rhodey’s face had scrunched up in confusion. The way Natasha’s eyes had turned into slits as though she had just realized something.
“You said so like… thirty times today,” Tony replied, rolling his eyes. “How often do I have to say it’s not a day to celebrate?”
Steve groaned and threw his sketchpad to the ground, letting his face fall into his open palms. “I’m not gay. I’m—bi, or maybe it’s just a thing with Tony, I have no idea. I just found out, alright?”
felt all the more appealing. Steve took a deep breath, reining himself in, before he could move and embarrass himself by trying to touch Tony.
“This coming from the punch line of all your kind? A lecture about ‘accomplishment’? You think you’re extraordinary for letting someone dose you with a chemical mixture? Please. There is a reason you and Stark cling to each other—you’re… the world’s… biggest… JOKES!”
“Maybe.” Tony heaved a low breath. “I’m not saying it was him. For now, let’s just go with the option that someone wants to blackmail him to push the anti-superhero-movement, all right? We’ll see what’s what.”
The dreams were over. Tony was gone. And a terrible thought took hold in Steve’s head: What if Tony was dead? He’d only be in his forties now, but what if something had happened?
Tony rolled his eyes. “Well, I don’t like sleeping warm and dry while you’re out there getting wet. We know shit about the climate in this dimension. Feels like it could be getting real cold at night, and when you’re wet, that cold is going to feel a thousand times worse.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “Sure. But I always thought there’s a lot to be learned for our present life if you look at our history.”
No one else out there could possibly understand the loneliness and fear that came with getting out of bed every morning—none save the other people who had risked their lives at his side. Tony didn’t want to hurt anyone, but as the minutes ticked by, it was becoming more and more difficult to avoid it.
Coulson paused, frowning at the words, obviously realizing for the first time that SHIELD was no more. “—
“While sex with you in that uniform has been hot in a way I can’t even put into words… I’m sure you’d like to get out of it sometime, huh? You in for a shared shower, or...?”
Before he completely knew what was happening, Steve was already by his side, pushing Tony towards the sink. He turned on the water and thrust Tony’s hand beneath the spray.
Natasha only leaned forward at the same time as Sam shook his head. “It’s sweet that you think you have a say in it,” Natasha said.
“Are you saying I'm losing my touch?” Tony asked, grinning up at Steve. The music kept flowing, and even though most of the other guests had already left for the large balconies, they started to move.
A sharp, grey line sliced the canvas diagonally. He had to start the damn picture somewhere. Steve stared at the line with a frown. Why were things never just… simple, in his life? And
Tony sat firmly to his right, their argument about the Accords momentarily forgotten. He’d had his arm wrapped securely around Steve’s waist, not suffocatingly so, just there. His touch was strong and immediately soothing. Fingertips skittered along Steve’s wrist to finally find Steve’s fingers, to loop his and Tony’s tightly together.
A helpless laugh fell from Steve unchecked. He tilted his head into Tony's palm. "Yeah, that's not even an exaggeration, is it?" He pulled back to look at Tony a little more critically. "Do you need anything? Water? Tissues? Clothes?" Dressed, Steve couldn't really tell how cold Tony might be getting, and he felt a little pang of shame for not asking earlier.
Steve nodded, then nodded some more. He could do this. There was something about this alone that moved him more than anything he had experienced before. Sitting in a dark tent, caressing each other intimately. Bearing that sort of honesty for something, and
“Love your tux, too, by the way,” Steve murmured, his fingers sliding over Tony’s shoulder to caress the black fabric. A smile twitched at his mouth. “Almost as much as I like you out of it.”
Bruce was still glaring daggers at Tony, and only when art prof asked for directions, he looked away.
Out of patience, he fisted his hand in her red hair, then pulled her up slightly and kissed her, breathing in through his nose as they both gasped. Letting go, he trailed his hand to her waist, then down to her ass to push her into his erection. They broke the kiss for a moment, moaned, and quickly moved back in, sucking, biting and consuming one another.
How the hell had he thought he could ever make it through this road trip with Steve by his side? If being near Steve had been torturous before, it was now pure agony.
It was the ‘please’ that made him pause. Steve said it like it was something intimate, a soft-spoken word that gained a whole new meaning when he was saying it to Tony.
"Yeah…" he said, slinging both arms around Tony's waist and holding him close. "I wouldn't have thought this, you and me, could work out if it hadn't been for that bar meeting." He rested his chin on Tony's head, breathing in the scent of shampoo, sweat and metal. "We should probably thank Natasha somehow…"
Tony swallowed. Hard. He didn’t know what to say, because this—this truly was a version of Steve Rogers who loved him. And he had never known a love like this. Somehow, Tony had always felt isolated, imprisoned by his own emotions—feeling alone even when in the company of others.
Ian’s whimpers were becoming full-fledged cries and Tony realized he couldn’t ignore him any longer.
Tony laughed, a strangled, delighted sound in his throat, male and flattered, and Steve revelled in the knowledge that he could fill Tony, stretching him to the utmost. It was exactly the perfect fit.
The thought that he could have lost this was made ridiculous in a matter of easy seconds. So many months—years—burying himself in denial. They had lost so much time.
Steve rolled his eyes as he scooped a helping of eggs onto two plates, where he had the potatoes and bacon already prepared. “You want orange juice or milk?”
Tony swallowed, and there was a dark feeling settling in his stomach. Of course, it shouldn’t be surprising. Steve was a good catch. He was a superhero, famous, really good-looking, a nice person with good morals and a weirdly dry sense of humor that had roused a startled laugh from Tony more often than he cared to admit. Steve was a good guy… why should he stay single forever? A man like Steve… despite claiming that it wasn’t a life he wanted anymore, would of course at one point find a nice girl and settle down with her.
Steve made a quick scan of the perimeter, but the area leading to the data storage appeared to be empty. Save, of course, for the two Iron Legion suits circling the Helicarrier’s glass dome.
“So this is what team debrief has come to,” he said with a very serious expression. “I have to say as the team’s main sponsor and supporter, I’m both shocked and disappointed.”
There was silence so thick you could cut it with a knife. The others sent Tony looks that tried hard not to be accusing or pitying or variations of the two, before they made to leave, too.
For minutes, they stayed quiet, and the only movement was the steady and rhythmic heaving of their chests, and the small brushes of Tony’s thumb on Steve’s arm.
Tony smiled to himself, savoring his next bite while gauging his words carefully. It was… stupid, somehow, his sudden need for a label, and he
Soon enough, Steve’s thrusts were becoming harder, and Tony battled him in the best way possible, pushing forward every time Steve drew back—every time he teased him before slamming back home.
“I confuse you? How so?” He kept the tone of his voice casual, too afraid that goading Tony into an explanation would scare him away.
“Alright,” Steve said. His finger never stopped as his other hand left his body. He heard the clinking sound of a belt buckle, then after a moment Steve took Tony’s hand and guided it to his cock.
Leaning against the handrail, Steve watched the dark river below. The night was silent, and for a moment, the whole world seemed completely at peace. And Steve was so tired, tired of this place, tired of being lied to. He let his mind wander back over the last few months. After Aldrich Killian had been defeated, he had almost instantly switched to soldier mode. He had charged ahead when Fury had asked him to help out with training the new STRIKE teams in Washington. Tony hadn’t questioned his decision. He was busy, too. Busy with getting a handle on Extremis, and busy with his newest SI projects. And while both of them hated being apart that often, they’d known it was only temporary, and that they were doing good in the process. They’d both thought it’d be worth it.
For the last few weeks, all they’d done, day in, day out, was to set up a bill of their own. Something everyone could live with and something the UN would hopefully accept. It was certainly better to present a solution of their own than being forced to sign something they didn’t believe in.
But it wasn’t the awkwardness that had left him with a bad taste in his mouth. It was the fact that this was all he’d do now… act as if he’d punch Hitler in the face, do promotional film reels, smile at the cameras, instead of actually going out there and helping people.
Times like these, being Captain America caught up with him. Dwelling on the issues with SHIELD brought back a dull throb behind his eyes. He wasn’t sure why he was so surprised. This was what Fury did, right? Keep information close to the heart. This was what all of SHIELD did… what they had always done, even when Steve had been too ignorant to know it.
Steve sighed, a grumbly, raspy sigh, his eyes immediately falling to Tony’s face. His crestfallen look could cripple tyrants. Hell, it probably
“How much we have to be thankful for,” Wanda replied with a smile, wrapping a hand around Pietro’s. “For a moment I thought I had lost you.”
Steve laughed warmly, and laid a hand on Bucky’s shoulder, pulling him in for another a massive bear hug.
your Tony,” he said. “Just with a bunch of more memories. He didn’t go anywhere, I am him. One and the same. This is time travel, not body-swapping. I just came back here and… I wanted to fix this.”
Before he’d left, he’d lit two candles, and there was enough light in the room for Steve to see the marks and dried blood on Bucky’s face where he’d hit him earlier.
There were several shots following after that, but this time, Tony was fast enough. Iron Man settled all around him and Tony threw himself on top of Fury, pushing him firmly to the side while the bullets collided against the armor’s back.
second more, he could’ve given his foot thrusters maximum power and pushed himself upwards and into the air, but Barnes didn’t give him that second. His free hand produced a small knife seemingly out of nowhere and within the fracture of a second, he let go of the gauntlets, grabbed the knife with his metal hand, and pushed it down.
There was a long minute of silence, before Tony couldn’t help it anymore. “So… you and me. We are really that close?”
Peter dropped his hands to his sides, his nose scrunching up for a moment. “She’s great. I’m just… nervous.”
? Steve was sure he’d never heard of that before, and yet, the regular police officers he’d seen walking around had seemed to readily follow their orders.
“I hurt Steve,” he said quietly. “I can’t control it. At one point it’s me and then it’s… someone else.”
Tony nodded, his hand resuming the artless patterns of comfort that drew across his back. “Not being able to help?” He smiled warmly when Steve glanced at him with surprise, obviously disliking that he was that simple to read. “It’s okay to just stand by for once, you know. Let someone else step in. Even for a super soldier.”
Tony turned his face away from Steve, taking a large swig from the bottle so he wouldn’t have to answer him.
be saying that it had everything to do with his parents’ passing, and Obi’s constant pressure, and the fact that no one seemed to get how fucking lost he was. All of that was true, in some way or the other, but at the end of the day, it had been Tony’s own decision to distract himself with booze and sex. And the only reason it hadn’t gone beyond that had always been Rhodey.
The way Peggy had looked at him had made Steve feel insanely proud and from what Colonel Phillips had told him afterwards, Steve understood that they wanted him to find a team and hunt Schmidt down. They had talked well into the night, with the others drinking some self-brewed liquor Jim Morita had brought with him. And much later, he and Bucky had shared a few stories on how their lives had been in the last months.
Steve swiveled around on the bar stool to face the speaker. The obnoxious, catty voice could only belong to one person.
Following Steve’s instructions, Tony sat up as Steve knelt down next to the couch, in between Tony’s legs. Tony reached down to try and undo some of the buttons on Steve’s shirt, but Steve grabbed his wrist and pushed it back. “Not tonight. You’ve gotta learn to let someone else take care of you for once.” Steve had been generally looking at Tony throughout, but it was at this moment that he looked Tony directly in his eyes and continued, “You’re gonna let me take care of you right now, right? And then, after this, you’ll start talking to me like normal and let me take care of that, too. You don’t have to hide everything away.” Steve ducked his head down, licking the head of Tony’s dick and teasing the slit. Tony moaned and strained against Steve’s grip on his wrist. Steve only held down harder. “Am I clear?” Tony squirmed and nodded, sighing as he said, “Ahh, yes!” At that, Steve took Tony’s dick in his mouth and swallowed it to the base, the head touching the back of Steve’s throat. Tony exclaimed another, “Ahh!” as he was encompassed in Steve’s warm, soft mouth. Steve swallowed around it again, the contractions stimulating Tony and making him jerk his hips forward. Steve pulled back and went down again, using his mouth and tongue in tandem. He took Tony in deeply for another few moments before pulling him out and licking along the side, stroking his dick with his hand. Steve smiled as Tony continued to buck into his grip, enjoying how much Tony was really letting his guard down. Steve replaced his hand with his mouth again and reached up to pinch Tony’s left nipple again, drawing a gasp and moan from him. Steve used his other hand to palm himself through his jeans.
a big thing for you! She’s getting…she’s marrying tomorrow, so…tonight is your last chance!” At that the two women laughed together, Alison the Bride covering half her face with her hand.
Before Steve could finish his thought, Tony moved forward, placed his hand on Steve’s cheek, and kissed him in one quick motion. When he stepped back, he looked Steve in the eyes and shook his head. He moved his hand between them, back and forth, before speaking. He was quieter this time when he said, “This. Whatever
“A ch – ugh, it’s useless talking about this with you. It’s whatever. It’s fine! I’m in the hotel up ahead, I thought we could relax up there but there’s no point now.”
“Tony, thank you, but you really didn’t have to get involved. It’s not like they’re hurting me or anything,” Steve began as they left the place. “They only wanted a picture.”
“It’s alright, as long as you don’t go stupid on me like that again. Just talk to me, I promise my brain works just fine. Maybe you should get yours checked.” Both of them laughed, and Steve moved a little closer. “I didn’t mind kissing, you know. We can…continue.” He said, brushing one of his fingers along Tony’s jawline. Tony’s heart skipped a beat. He nodded and smiled coyly, moving in to capture Steve’s mouth. He lifted his hand out from under Steve’s and put it lightly on Steve’s waist. At first, they kissed gently as they had before, letting the moment last. After a moment, Tony pulled away and said quietly, “Is this really alright? I feel like I was really…really a jackass. You don’t have to—” Steve kissed him, his tongue briefly reaching out and contacting Tony’s lips.
dignity. Obviously now, it had been for naught. When Steve pulled back, he smiled at Tony and made sure to look him in the eyes as he dropped his hips, grinding his own clothed dick against Tony’s. Tony groaned and wiggled his hips back and forth, looking for
Tony sighed, pressing the floor button. “It’s really nothing. It’s nothing I want to discuss, anyway.” The elevator rose to the 6
“Tony, just, shut up for a second, you sound insane. I ask you about Pepper and it goes back to the girls in the bar? And what do you mean, ‘whatever’s going on here’? You aren’t making any sen—"
want. But no, everything with Pepper sucks. I broke her heart and don’t know what that means. I don’t know what I’m feeling. Maybe I’d be able to move on from all that if I didn’t have…whatever’s going on here.” Tony gestured at Steve flippantly, flicking his hand toward him. Steve stared at him, his expression unreadable. “You’re clueless, Steve. What, did your time as an ice cube freeze your prefrontal cortex, too? No more people skills, no more just…fuck, you can’t just read the room? Those girls at the bar were clearly trying to get with you. It was gross, it made me feel sick.” Tony huffed and shook his head. “I mean, if you couldn’t tell that about
“The, uh, ventilation system broke down, but it looks like there’s a stream of air coming in through the—uh...”
He was exhausted from hours of hunting rabbits and he needed a drink. However, when he got out of the bushes to where the moss was flat and the ground was clear around the river’s edge, what he saw stopped him in his tracks.
“I know,” Steve said. “That’s why we need Fury to bypass the DNA scans and access the Helicarriers directly.” He looked at Tony from the front passenger seat. “Run it by me again?” he asked.
“Tones!” Rhodey perked up when Tony came to a stop next to him. He wound an arm around Tony’s shoulder, pulling him into a firm hug.
Bucky shrugged, unbothered by the admission. “Once we got over, well…” He made a gesture with his hand resembling ‘you know’, “Tony’s a good guy. He forgave me. Now we’re friends.”
He swallowed, trying to come up with a response that would have more than vowels in it, when he saw Bruce coming their way.
“Nice,” Tony murmured as the doors opened and revealed a huge workshop. The lights went on and the room felt almost somberly quiet. When Bucky trailed past Tony into the large front parlor with a deep bowed window, he saw Tony’s hands trembling slightly. Could he be nervous? When was he ever?
What the hell was that about anyway? They’d never been particularly handsy with each other. The only times they’d really touched in the past was while they sparred—or punched the living daylight out of each other.
, Tony thought as he tried to sit up again, but in the moment he might as well have called him Stephanus, because those lines in his head were essentially nonexistent.
Tony smiled gently. “That’s not stupid at all. I know how much you wanted him to be there for this, and since I can’t bring back the dead, I…” He shrugged. “This I could do.”
Steve bit his lower lip, and Tony sighed. “Eat with me, Steve,” he said softly. “I’m sure we can fix this.”
Rhodes only nodded at him, clearly tired, and sat down on the sofa group. Steve sat down in the passenger seat.
“Of course you will,” Steve said. “But you need a break. I know your free time’s down to a zero. Gonna kill yourself if you aren’t careful.”
He didn’t even want to think about all those thoughts running through Obi’s mind right now. Pepper was right, Obi didn’t fight wars he couldn’t win, but he was a sore loser all the same. And payback might be a long time coming, but Tony wouldn’t be deluding himself into thinking that this was the end of that particular story.
Once settled, Tony released a half-groan, half-chuckle as he somewhat slumped down on Steve. His heat enveloped him wholly and Tony felt as if he could combust with the feel of it. He planted a firm kiss on Steve's lips, smiling against his mouth.
Steve wanted to scream, but instead, he just nodded. “Don’t worry about me,” he told Stane with a stern glance of his own. “I’m more observant than you think I am.”
The first second of totality is a life-changing event that burns itself into memory—and never really fades.
This was a snapshot. A stolen moment in time. Steve was here now, but he would leave again. That was the way it always was between them. They met, created a mess, and part ways. They’d be back together eventually, but there was no way to tell what kind of face they would wear.
“You can’t think that,” Rhodey whispered, reaching for Steve’s hands. “I can't even tell you how glad I am that you've met Tony. You have no idea how good it is that he found someone like yourself who’s not entirely in tune with Stark Mansion.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, please put it on that table at the end of the room…” He pointed to the work table on the far off side of the room, and Steve set into motion. “Yes, there.” Bruce trailed after him, but first came to a stop at Tony’s side.
“It’s a longer drive to New Jersey,” Natasha said as soon as Steve helped Tony into the SUV. They sat down on the backseat, and Tony winced slightly as he leaned against the backrest.
Rhodey licked his lips and expelled another sigh. “Okay, I—I cannot frigging believe I have to say this, but: I’m NOT a homophobe! I don’t fucking CARE who likes who, alright?” He shot a warm smile in Carol’s direction, then stepped towards Tony. He put both hands down on his shoulders and stared down at him. “I know you are probably freaking out right now, so I will say it, very slowly, and very clear: You’re into boys, and I approve with all my heart. I was 99 percent sure you were crushing on…” Another millisecond-glance at Steve. “…someone. I don’t think differently of you, you’re still my best friend.” With that, he pulled him into a firm hug. Steve could see that it took Tony about a moment to let all of this sink in, before he eventually relaxes against Rhodes’ chest and hugged him back.
Like a man on the gallows with a rope around his neck, the wait was almost worse than the drop. He paused to collect his thoughts and put them in some kind of coherent order. “The day we brought in Loki’s scepter, do you remember how I told you I’d be willing to meet with that adoption agency?”
Steve let loose a half-sigh, half-chuckle. He looked down at Natasha, and not for the first time in his life, he wished to get a glimpse of how her mind worked. “How do you always know?”
Steve immediately wrapped his arms around Tony when he fell forward, there was nothing he could do for him but listen at this point, but when Tony bemoaned the darkness, Steve's hold tightened momentarily.
Slowly, an amused smile reached Steve’s face. “I really think I should feel insulted that you keep saying you’re the brains in this relationship.”
“I’m…” Tony sighed. “Not to quote ‘Tangled’ but, …what if it’s not what I thought it would be? What if I’m disappointed?”
“You could call it that,” Steve said, and finally moved away from his spot in the corner of this room.
It was only years of carefully practiced self control that stopped Steve from scrambling out of the bed in a feat of surprised shock. Instead, he made to disentangle himself from the sleeping form and lay flat on his back, his breath instantly rocketing into panic-mode as he waited for his arm to stop tingling, for his erection to subside, and for the gaps in his memory of last night to fill in completely.
Immersed in his thoughts once more, Tony had almost forgotten about Bruce’s presence, until he placed a warm hand on his knee and jarred him back to the present. “Did Steve talk to you?” he asked.
He texted Rhodey that he’d be leaving the club in a moment, and only got about a dozen stupid party-emoticons in return.
“To be fair, two weeks in, it still looked like they would. And—I’m still mad about that, by the way.” Pepper’s voice sounded accusatory, but her happy smile belied all words. “I keep wondering if Nicholas is proud of playing matchmaker or despairs over it.”
“There were so many things I thought I’d have forever to tell you,” Tony said. “That I thought I could work up to. That at one point, we’d be on the way to… rediscovering, I guess. No, rebuilding. Rebuilding’s a better word.”
When Tony looked up again, Steve’s skin had turned a charming shade of pink, the flush spreading all the way down to his chest. Tony couldn’t help himself, he laughed softly and moved in for another kiss, this time lingering a bit while he cupped Steve’s cheek. “Always wondered if you were a full body blusher,” he whispered. “You’re absolutely gorgeous like this.” With one hand, he tenderly encircled Steve’s cock to give him a few gentle tugs, trying to ease the tension in his body a bit. “Just relax for me, alright? I’ll start slow, and if you decide halfway through that this isn’t it for you, we can still have a good time.”
