"If you do that you will feel like warm stiff shit in the morning"
Tony drank the entire glass in two drinks “Thanks” He said with a sigh. “That’s a lot of food for one person.” He said, raising an eyebrow in amusement. Steve was obviously cooking for him and roped Jarvis in to get him down here.
Tony raised an eyebrow "sure?" He said slowly.
Tony shot straight up, gasping for air, tears steaming down his face, calming a bit when he recognized where he was, Shield medical bay, looking over to see Steve coming to as well. Steve bolted up, gasping and looking around before he scrambled for Tony, pulling him into a tight hug. "I am not disgusted. " he whispered
Steve swallowed, licking his lips again. "Any questions? "
"Tony...." he sighed softly. "How can I help in here, then?"
Becca does, too.

“So…” Steve said. “Retractable armor. That’s new.”
Steve braced himself. He gripped Tony’s arm and pulled him close. He raised his other hand and brushed Tony’s hair back. Haltingly, he brought his lips to Tony’s, first brushing, then pressing, then tilting his head and kissing back as Tony opened his mouth under his. Their tongues intertwined, explored, wrestled, fought for some timeless interval, until Steve pulled his head back slightly. “Yes,” he breathed, “that’s definitely what it wants.”
“Color?” Tony asked.
“Yup. My BMI is, like, one thousand five, and I’ll crash the software of any airport X-ray I run through---”
“Did I stutter? You have,” Steve concentrated, “eight minutes and fifty-two seconds before they come barreling in here to congratulate you on your brilliance… assuming the field doesn’t collapse first. I think there are some things you don’t want them to see. So,” and he used the voice, the Captain America voice, the command voice, and wasn’t that unfair? “Kneel.” And the room swam and his ears roared and his traitorous knees gave out beneath him. “Isn’t that better?” Steve all but crooned. “Now. You’re going to open your pants, and you’re going to touch yourself. Right now. With everyone right there, like the slut you are.”
"I've never been more ready, and I've never been more sure and I'm fucking terrified but you're here with me and that's everything I've ever wanted." She inhaled. "Ready?"
Steve’s eyebrows lifted. “I beg your pardon?”
We were working on a “campfire on the beach” scene for National S’mores Day (it’s my opinion that underneath that RT node contraption beats the heart of a thwarted theater kid) when we had the Talk.
Steve actually turned red the first time he saw the board, and I’m convinced it was because he remembered the awkwardness he had felt about this robe, and not because Tony tried to get a snapshot of his derriere. He is either so straight he couldn’t fathom the idea, or … no, nobody could be that oblivious.
4:  To-scale, rhythmically-purring stuffed animals draped over his shoulders, over and under his arms, climbing his back and legs, over his feet, and perched upon his head. Most of those, we ended up distributing to local foster families, but Hulk liked the gray one with the purple collar and Thor insisted that the biggest one made a perfect bolster pillow. He was right, too: we still fight about who gets to use it when we get together for movie night.
Stark, for once, was silent.
Only the Vision was still admiring Pride-Cap.
“Pretty sure you already did that,” said Steve. “Bishop to D4.”
By which I mean, I lied my shiny metal ass off. I looked at the professor like I had no idea whether he was pulling my leg or having a stroke and said, “I don’t know where you’re getting your ‘information,’ from, Professor, but I hope you kept the receipt. I love Steve, yes. He’s my best friend, why wouldn’t I love him? But… not that way. Sorry.” I feigned a rueful grin. “I’m sorry. I… look, I didn’t think it would be a problem, but being around this many drunk people… I have to go.”
Tony’s eyes were huge and brown and wet, and it was all Steve could do to keep from gathering his naked lover up from all fours and comforting him. The urge irritated him, and he let that filter into his voice as he snapped, “What did you do?”
“Hey, yourself,” I answered. “Not a fan of the dreidel thing?” I was glad that our relative positions didn’t force me to avoid eye contact. Not that I was avoiding eye contact.
Then, abruptly, “Tony, stop. Tony,

You know the secret of the Avengers holiday party, right? Right. It’s Mama Carbonell’s secret eggnog recipe. Oh, you want that recipe? Well… okay, seeing as how it’s you, I’ll tell you, but you have to take the secret to your grave. Beyond your grave. If I find out that you told a single living soul, I’ll see to it that the universe you live in is deleted from existence. Trust me, I know a guy who’s working on that.
But Tony released Steve’s wrists. “All right. Come on, Steve. Fuck me
From: Emma Frost
"Well, that's asinine. What kind of idiot doesn't want a foot rub? That-- oh. Oh!" Steve almost sagged in relief that he didn't have to explain further. Then, softly, "And that worked out?"
TONY:
Tony snorted as if in disbelief. The snort turned into giggles, which turned to helpless laughter, “What?” Steve demanded.
I was talking about lunch with the latest superheroine to be spit back out of Death’s revolving door when Tony smirked at me.
“It is December, and nobody asked if I was ready.”
"Tony---"
"Tony." And he hopes to hell that sting that lingers on his collarbone is not just in his head, and that they had the same vision. Somehow. Tony turns to him like a man who turns to look at the flash of the bomb that's going to kill him, and he pulls down the collar of his uniform to expose the mark Tony left.
“It must be October, the trees are falling away and showing their true colors.”
All right, all right, some of us may have guessed, but it’s not really something you want confirmed.
A hint of defiance crept into Tony’s eyes. “Don’t worry, Tony. Nobody read them but me, and nobody will… if you’re good. You can cup your balls with your right hand, Tony. And you know what? All those nights we wasted, wanting the same things, aching for each other… longing… that’s not going to happen again… yes, just like that. Lick your hand, now. You don’t need that much, do you? You’re so wet for me already. You can grip it.”
“And that is for being the sassiest bitch in the hemisphere, over and over… and doubting my word.”
him to see it, but I didn’t know how it would be received.
He could just see Sam pinning an imaginary medal on his chest, proclaiming him to be, without doubt, “the smoothest motherfucker on the face of the planet.”
"He.... didn't want a foot rub. On your left!" Steve yelped. His Nomad-clad counterpart dodged the--- ninja robot, really?--- and took it down handily.
He tangled his hand in Tony’s hair, forced him to look down at that damned piece of paper. Tony whimpered, his back end dropping, and for a minute Steve genuinely thought he was going to submission-pee.
That last wasn’t a lie, not the slightest bit. And so, I hurried out and spent the evening and the night swilling burnt coffee with my family at AA… the family of refugees, flotsam and jetsam of shipwrecked lives.
Steve felt his eyes crinkle around the edges as a thought occurred to him. He unwrapped the briefly-forgotten candy cane in his hand, breaking the hook off and tossing it into the trash a few feet away, licking and sucking the straight part luxuriously as his pet watched with begging, thwarted eyes. “Mm,” he groaned deeply, “so sweet… want a lick... boy?” Tony shuddered minutely. “Practically drooling, aren’t you?” He lowered the cane to Tony’s mouth, let him take a long, slow lick, then, before Tony could mimic Steve’s little show, Steve bent to lick the other side of the sticky confection, their tongues inevitably, enticingly entwining around it. Steve pulled his mouth away, leaning back, and slowly, as if to avoid Tony noticing, moved the cane to line up with his cock. Tony continued to lick the candy, his tongue straying more and more across the skin of Steve’s straining erection. Steve groaned and hissed. “God, boy… this is so bad… so dirty…  if only you could know what you were doing to me… so wrong…” The pace of Tony’s licks quickened as, staring intensely up at Steve, he took his cock into his mouth alongside the stick and sucked. Steve moaned again, the familiar and the foreign moving tightly against his hardness in tandem, fire pooling in his loins and gut. “Stop... stop!” he gritted out before he reached the point of no return. Tony pulled away, reluctantly. Steve glanced down, weighed the evidence at hand, and nodded to himself.
“What? It was me before.”
“Don’t cha think?” sniped Jan.
“That’s quite colorful.” The Vision gives strange yet surprisingly satisfying compliments.

And Santa? I’ve met the man. There is something incredibly

So. You think I’m going to fuck you. I’m just going to… hold you down and have my way with you, and for once in his fucking life, Steve Rogers, old Stars and Stripes, is going to be the pillow queen and take whatever I give him.
“Oh, God, put your hands down, Threepeo, I know I’ve been jumpy lately, but it’s not that…” and his eyes slid to a barely-discernible patch of fresh paint. “Okay, point taken.Just… get over here.” And Stark held out his arms.
Tony raised up to his knees. Steve poured a capful of mouthwash. Tony looked rebellious. Steve pried his jaw open and poured the mouthwash in, covering Tony’s mouth with his hand. “Swish,” he commanded. Catching Tony’s eye he said, “Oh, you can swallow. I won’t punish you. But I don’t think you’ll like the way it goes down.” He felt Tony’s lips writhe under his hand, a new sensation. After a while, he took his hand away and commanded, “Spit.” Tony did.
“Oh, come on, think of the fun when you come stumbling out of each others’ rooms for a four a.m. Assemble and thinking you’ve fooled everyone but you’re both wearing the wrong yellow bodysuit. Cin-der-el-la, dressed in yell-a...”
Part of him, the tactician that never shut up, sketched out possibilities the way a batter worked calculus to hit a fastball and told him
I sent a picture of it to Clint because it was mildly amusing, and Stark had the sheer gall to, at Hawkeye’s suggestion, rig the ballroom door to play “Blame Canada” whenever it was opened. Who taught those city boys how to tell a maple leaf from a fig leaf, anyway?
She was... beautiful. Dark hair, that he knew already, but piercing, ice-blue eyes, dark with arousal, and a bone structure that would have made his artist's fingers twitch for charcoal even if they'd met in a café, fully clothed. The flush that had washed over her features drained, leaving her pale, except for her sensual mouth. Waist narrow for hip size, perfect teardrop ass, muscles that probably shouldn't have been surprising given the state of her hands. But that wasn't what made him freeze like a deer in headlights. Because between those perfect, dark-tipped breasts was a mass of scar tissue, striated with dark lines, and in the center of that... he'd only seen it a couple of times, but it was impossible to forget, etched in his memory. A port, a glow, metal. "...Tony?" He felt like he was tumbling through the air, like up was in a dozen places at once and nowhere. "Oh, my God, Tony, I'm so sorry, this---" he babbled.
Tony lifted a puzzled eyebrow. “You’re not going to pick my nose, Steve, this is weird enough already.”
“Oh, ah, green. Definitely green. Green,” Steve said.
“Hey! That’s a camera on there! What gives?”
He’d been on a sabotage mission. Fuck, it was unbelievably risky, but no-one knew Stark like he did, and Tony had, miraculously, forgotten to disable a crucial set of emergency access codes for his presumed-and-technically-actually-dead self. The gains they stood to make from that breach far outweighed any risk to Steve. Hell, to most of the world, he was a memory anyway, a post-mortem on some metal table in the sub-basement of a deeply-hidden lab, being sliced and diced and frappéed and rendered to figure out what uniqueness made the Super Serum another man’s poison. He was already as missed as he was going to be. No point in sparing a soldier that was already a casualty.
“Think about what?” The man himself bounded in, and damned if he didn’t have several inches of curly green ribbon clinging to the back of his shirt.
“I know,” Steve smirked, as insouciantly as his wrung-out state would let him.
“Hm?” said Steve, nuzzling Tony’s neck.
The pain was shattering as the suit pushed the toy into him. It was lubed up, but not enough, too fast, and it was all Steve could do not to roar and fight free. Instead, he breathed into the pain, which was already turning into molten pleasure. The suit pistoned the toy into him, and he shook with the intensity, the exposure, the submission, the wracking pain/ pleasure of it. :”Tony… baby... not… much… longer.”
“Yeah. I like it. Getting there sucked, but it’s pretty much all advantages over the external stuff.”
“Hush. You’re going to keep your body relaxed, eyes on mine, and we’re going to breathe together, nice and easy… in…. out…” Steve swallowed and wet his lips, unconsciously. His pupils had dilated so there was only the barest ring of that perfect blue surrounding the black.
--- while part of him wanted to weep---- he was getting the one thing he had wanted more than any other, one wish he never even dared to think of, and this was so
And I got another peck on the cheek. This time from Captain America. Not the 20-foot version. “Thank you,” he said. I made eye contact with Tony, who was furrowing his brow, as if calculating how to kick my ass to the West Coast. Then with Angel who looked as confused as I felt. I think I was blushing.
“Hong Kong, actually. Although I think Logan thought he was Australian when I first met him.”
Steve shook his head. “Well… I mean… yeah, I guess I was curious about that, too, but can you feel the armor from the outside? When people touch you?” The tips of his ears flushed. “Eh, forget it, I don’t mean to be nosy.”
“You’re surprised?”
The doctor said, "Okay, we can confirm: definitely not cursed. And, oh, hey... yup, looks like they're in the clear. Do you want to tell them, Colonel? They'll be---" and she broke off, covering her mouth and making a sort of half-squeak, half-coo noise often associated with kitten videos and pictures of piglets and hedgehogs in hats.
Right. The Leonids. The blanket probably still had soot on it from the roof.
The intercom squawked into life. “Good news, guys. You’re all clear. False alarm--- the proteins in the stuff might trigger some mild allergic response if you get a reaction to chamomile, ragweed, or strawberries, but you two should both be fine.”
Steve tilted his chin up, defiantly.  “I can take it.”
"No, it's just... look at these readings."
“If you don’t mind,” Friday interrupted, “I have taken the liberty of contacting Dr. Lee and scheduling Mr. Stark for an eight a.m. appointment here at the tower tomorrow, as well as rescheduling a client meeting for a more mutually-agreeable time.”
THUNDERBIRD:
Joke was on Stark, though, because if it hadn’t been for that, we might never have known just how often he opened the ballroom door to gaze upon that majestic monolith.
How many times has Steve looked into the mouth of certain death and
And speaking of “large paperweights…”
The noise of a cabinet door opening. Tony was rummaging. What?
"So Tuesday?"
“You know, that’s the most efficient way possible to get someone to freak out. Saying ‘don’t freak out,'” Steve suggested mildly.
5: Didn’t do that one; couldn’t figure out how to be fully sensitive to the culture.
Steve wet his lips and said, “Kneel.”

He knew Tony was watching him through the mask. Was he being watched from two angles, or three? They were silent, all of them, except for his and Tony’s breathing, heavy with desire, perfectly synchronized with no conscious volition. The suit cocked his legs up, exposed his asshole. Steve kept his eyes fixed on its eye slits as it trailed a finger down the back of his thigh, spread its hand over the globe of his ass, then slowly, agonizingly circled his entrance. It slid his other hand to circle his cock, moving steadily up and down. Steve nodded at it, slowly.
Steve sighed, “I want you to know, I am only agreeing to do this because you wouldn’t risk wasting a month of ‘I told you so’s’ on something you weren’t incredibly sure of. Last chance to back out?”
"Let's just stick with the plan for now, sport," she gasped. "But 'ma'am' is a hard no, not even if you're a fireman. Call me 'ma'am' again and I will smack you..."
Tony shivered, keeping his eyes on Steve’s. This was… exquisite. Steve nodded in approval, pupils dilating with desire. “Seven minutes, eight seconds.” He traced the outlines of his cock, barely grazing it as he nodded back, eyes wide. “See, it’s been a while since we talked. I figured some things out.” The left corner of Steve’s mouth crooked in a smirk. “Might have read some things that ‘Tasha hacked." Steve leaned in until their foreheads almost touched. “Private things.”
“Come on, turn over,” Steve said.
"Are you sure? Because Steamboat Willie is showing no signs of leaving the building."
“Yes, I’m ‘okay with this.’ Get on with it and fuck me already,” Tony growled, and Steve’s cock jumped and shuddered as if Tony’s voice was its own resonant frequency. Tony grabbed the bottle of liquid and coated Steve’s cock generously, fucking himself back onto Steve’s fingers. “This is normally where I’d be grabbing a condom, but I don’t have any with me, and ‘No terrestrial diseases,’ the nice lady said. Stay still until I tell you you can move.” He leaned down to cover Steve’s mouth with his, pulling Steve’s hands away from his own ass to press them down by crossed wrists against the couch above Steve’s head with one hand, then guided the tip of Steve’s straining cock to his asshole, and pushed back, groaning. “One minute… let me get used to this… ugh, you feel huge...”
Natasha is glaring again.
“I don’t see why you had me come in costume,” I grumbled.
So, no, I’m not fond of Christmas, and I know everyone’s dying to see the statue in a fluffy red-and-white hat, but everyone knows you can’t spell “aesthetic” without A-E-S.
They lay in silence, breathing together. After a few minutes, Tony said, "That was... wow. I love you. Words broken. Are you?"
Tony turned back around, casting about. “Oh, yeah, that’s good,” he said, grabbing a small socket wrench, placing it in Steve’s right hand.. “I’m going to turn my back on you. You’re going to come up behind me and cosh me.”
Tony’s mouth was warm and wet, the beard soft, the lips tasting faintly of old coffee and something uniquely
I braced for impact. Instead, I got that incredible smile beamed at me. I squinted against the glow. Damn. Should have used sunscreen. “I love Hanukkah. I’ve always loved the story. You know,” and here the smile turned almost bashful, “freedom fighters doing their best in the face of those who would force them to stoop.”
I processed this for several nanoseconds. “Tony… I may be missing something. Buying gargantuan sculptures of their friends… do people… do that? Should I be buying a statue of Wanda?”
“Hush, now. Yes, Lockheed, see what I mean about his annoyed face?” Kitty said, that giant... flying lizard flamethrower thing circling me like a mosquito with an autograph book and social anxiety.
Steve smiled drowsily, touching her lower lip with his finger. "Mine," he said.
. That's it. You're mine, and I'm yours, and that's it. No retreat, no surrender, no walking it back or putting anything but each other first. No sacrificing ourselves to save the planet, no fighting over registration acts or cabana boys..."
Tony had something planned for Krishna Janmashtami, but the Maggia needed kicking.
? He has ten seconds, maybe, and it's now or another several decades of soap-opera pining because the timing is never, ever right.
“You... “ Steve hissed. “..you met a sassier bitch in Australia?”
Steve chose this very moment to wander in, stepping neatly on my retort. His jaw dropped. He shut it resolutely, then said, “I guess I should be glad you didn’t go with a Maypole,” turned on his heel, and strode from the room.
The glee left Stark’s face as he realized they were…  together. Alone. For the first time in years. “Uh, yeah. So… how’ve you been?” He breathed into the pounding in his chest.
By the time I got back (lots of us were having a rough night that night, and I may have hit more than one meeting. NYC is good that way), the sky was lightening to a pearly pre-dawn gray. I made my way to the ballroom to see how trashed it was, and was pleased to find that it had already been cleaned up, all repairs made, and festooned with the same number of chandeliers it had started the evening with. I was glad I could count on my aides-de-camp to tip the staff well… they’d certainly earned it. By signs throughout the house, I gathered that, although not all the guests had made their way home, everyone had been bundled off to one bed or another.
“Steve!” he continued in a voice sloshing with… well, let’s call it good cheer and bonhomie. “I confess, I’d no idea what to get you… it seems that you are massively content with your possessions, needing not one jot more than what you have. But I see you are lacking… information. Wonderful stuff, knowledge. Useful stuff. You don’t even need to dust it.
Steve’s arms tightened around him. “Command, this is Rogers. My instincts say we’re going to need at least a couple more hours, just to be on the safe side. Besides, we have a game to finish. Maintain radio and video silence until my mark.”
my statue, even if you own it, and I haven’t really participated in this… whatdoyoucallit. So… I had an idea for some holiday cheer.”
“Yeah, I know. It’s a blip on the radar and really just a sop to the get the goyim to stop spewing red and green and tinsel into the workspaces of the decent, hard-working, and fashion-forward. But think about it, Tony…”
STEVE:
“I… this is amazing, you’re incredible, but I don’t think this is what it wants?”
!” wobbled Wanda. (Mama Carbonell’s eggnog was apparently even more deceptively-strong than usual this year.) She flicked a bead of red energy at the statue, which flew around to light up the statue’s lower back.
The Mark 69 was not comic-code approved. But who cared?
Tony and I didn’t usually make a lot of eye contact back then, for whatever reason, but somehow that twinkle just caught me, you know? I grinned back. “Why, Wanda, that sounds like a challenge.”
I climbed the ladder and frowned. Inches below Captain America’s 5-on-the-Mohs-scale giant crotchbulge was absolutely not how I’d expected to end my night, and I never in a million years thought I could feel sad and puzzled in this position.
“Shh, shh,” Tony said, helping him up to cuddle him soothingly. “You did fine. You were beautiful. I’ve never seen anything hotter in my life. You think I’m going to complain? Because you couldn’t keep yourself from coming?” Steve shook his head and let himself be drawn in the shelter of Tony’s cool, muscular arms, burrowing his face into his lover’s chest. Words were slowly coming back to him. “I love you,” he said.
“I like it. Kudos. Never would have thought that changing up the outfit would take it past Uncanny Valleyville, but somehow… well, there you go, sometimes it’s the simple things. But we’ve got to get you into some cashmere. Not even you can pull off the softer side of Sears without looking like barbecue dad.”
The gauntlets were smooth and felt cool, metallic. They roamed his body, shamelessly touching, stroking, slick against his thighs, cupping his balls. Touching him. Memorizing him.
, the strange lightness pulsing through him, feeling the edges of his skin limned in joy as Tony bit the back of his neck, hard, the pain and intensity moving him past the edge of some strange horizon. His asshole gripped his lover’s cock as his balls tensed, moving what felt like his whole self through his pulsing, dripping penis, feeling rather than hearing Tony roaring his claim into his spine, clawing at the sheets as he heard himself chanting purifying blasphemies, coming and coming and coming.
.' Her hand slid under his, exploring her own folds. "Oh... wow... I... Jesus... wait, 'miss?'"
Steve had grown to like the marble dude as much as the rest of us had, but did he know about Tony’s orientation? That in itself had nothing to do with Steve – at first sight anyway. I mean it was the reason I knew about it. His crush was the giant red blinking arrow pointing at it. Probably the reason anyone on the team knew about it. But was Tony maybe not even … out? Fuck, this was supposed to be a nice thing for him.
Steve smiled harder. "Yeah, you have."
there, who really knew what it was like was like stepping into the sunshine after a long, cold fight indoors. The very feeling of connection made the feeling of being shut out from that commonality was… the worst. This guy, this mirror-self, would never understand. “Well…”
Steve continued to circle his marble-me. I looked at Angel to find out if that was good or bad, or what was happening.
“Shut up,” Tony said.
Their intel had been fucked.
And that’s how I almost ruined Tony Stark’s future by giving him advice on how to be
“No, cruel.”
, for your information. It’s an investment. A star-spangled investment with a plan. And it’s closer to twenty feet. Twenty-five feet, tops.”
For a second, Steve can’t breathe. That’s it? All they had to do was… stop? Get where they wanted, needed to go, and work backwards? Why not? He thought several happy blasphemies. Jess was right.
“Oh! Oh, yes. It definitely wants that. But… there are other ways to effect-- ah, God, yes, it wants that  so bad!--- skin-to-mucous-membrane contact?"
? “You know, if this works like I think it’s going to, I’ll need to run simulations for about the next two hours and forty minutes or so, and I was thinking we’ve never---” The always-present background undertone of arousal in the scent of the lab rose to the top of Tony’s scent signature, overwhelming Steve, thickening his lazy half-chub to a full hard-on so quickly Steve was almost surprised it didn’t make a noise. “You’re going to do it. You know you are. Or I could bring Natasha in, she’d be happy to pop me on the noggin…” Tony flicked his fingers and made a popping sound effect.
VISION:
Tony's eyes grew thoughtful, weighing the times when their country, their universe, their world, and countless lives had hung in the balance of the choices they made. She bit her lip.
Tony nodded gravely. “I think…” He rolled Steve onto his back, straddling him. “I think it needs me to see your face when we fuck. I bet you’re beautiful when you come.” He started, as if he’d said too much, but Steve only nodded back.
Although he had meticulously prepped, he had to breathe into the blunt pain of first few thrusts, trying not to grunt as the pain turned to electric heat, pleasure pulsing through him like white light, joining him with his lover in perfect unity, feeling the
“Nah, it’s easy if you know the trick. Here, let me show you. Keep that together,” he said, climbing down his ladder and up behind me, looping his arms under mine to grab the ends of the belt and hold it closed over my head. I looked more closely at the catch above us. “Steve… this is mistletoe.”
Steve rose to lie beside Tony in one smooth motion, pausing to kiss and kiss and kiss again, rubbing his now-naked body against Tony’s. “You see?”
“March is the month of expectation, the things we do not know.”
I thought the whole thing would blow over with the rabbit suit, but no. I came back to visit the mansion, and they’d used
“Put what?” my wife asked, sliding into her seat.
He has to try. This is a life he has to fight for. This is why he came back. "Tony. What did you see?"
Maybe we should just take the damn thing away from Tony and donate it somewhere safe and far away. For everybody’s sake.
Jan leaned in to hug him, discreetly detaching it. “Steve, Tony was just saying that he was thinking of doing Hanukkah for, um. Your statue.”
Colorado Day.
“What it… Steve, what?”
Tony's calling for his ride, and for once in his life, Steve is glad for the parking problem in Greenwich Village and Strange's refusal to put a landing pad on the building. He has three minutes. Maybe.
She tapped his lip in return. "Mine. Yes, yours." She flowed up his torso, not quite disengaging, sucking at his clavicle as they twitched with aftershocks. "Hey, look at that, I've left a mark on Captain America."
He heard Tony’s pants unzip. There’s a pause, as if of consideration, and a soft impact of cloth on the ground, once, twice, thrice. Steve risked a glance out of the corner of his eye. Tony was naked and idly stroking himself.

“Color?” The suit had, in the course of its counterpart’s ministrations, turned him to face Tony more fully, and Tony was jerking himself off in earnest, his eyes dark with lust, watching his lover writhe.
“No, that’s the beauty of it: long-lasting, cool-burning fireworks and sparklers. We put them up and ignite them at sundown. We put picnic blankets around it like Tony suggested. And maybe by the end of the night, Steve finally...”
“So…” ask Steve. “What now?” Christ. He could feel his pulse in the base of his cock.
At least, nothing that I could come up with at the time. I mean, it’s not that I didn’t
All right.
“Steve!” I said, keeping my smile fixed, “May I borrow you?” Which is Avengers party code for “drop everything and consult with me privately NOW.”
“April is the cruelest month, breeding lilacs out of the dead land, mixing memory and desire.”
Steve opened the tube of toothpaste and squeezed a stripe out on his finger. He pulled Tony’s jaw open again -- “Open!” -- and began vigorously brushing the outsides of his teeth, noting mildly, “I don’t think you’ll like what happens if you bite me, pet.” Thrusting his finger to get the insides, something dark uncoiled and chuckled in his belly as he felt Tony gently gag. “Spit,” he repeated. He wiped Tony’s mouth, and shook his head. “Look at you, boy. You’re a mess. A hot, dirty mess.” He angled a shaving mirror to show Tony to himself, naked, undone, dishevelled. He leaned over and started the shower. “Are you going to run?” Steve asked. Tony hung his head. “You’re not going anywhere.” He unlocked the collar and hung it carefully on the towel rack. He looked down at his clothes. “I guess I’m not going to get these wet,” he said, peeling down to his skin.
Steve was shuddering and trembling already as he ripped the harness off that stupid, tacky (skin-tight, incredibly sexy) black body suit. Steve pushed him away, gasping, and he did something with his thumb to the neck of the suit… it fell open with ease.
Eventually.
Steve ducked a flying droid, then smashed it into a wall with the shield. Some things about meeting alternate-universe selves were amazing. Steve’s life had been pretty unique, and finally meeting someone who had
"If a June night could talk, it would probably boast it invented romance."
It was amazing. The whole room was transformed. It looked like something out of an old movie. There were signs of decay that hadn’t been there three days ago, spider webs and piles of rubble, ivy vines and shattered lanterns. The mirrors had cracks and blind spots and the curtains were blood-red. Everything seemed to be illuminated by candlelight, which I was pretty sure was artificial, but only because I knew Tony had done this. Suddenly there were shrieks and shadows from something flying overhead, and we all instinctively ducked, but Tony just chuckled. Light and sound projections. Equally unprompted, a strange, but very rhythmic song started. It had a lot of different singers, chanting “This is Halloween” over and over.
The sparklers actually did a lot for the ambience in the end. Jarvis had prepared picnic baskets. Tony had insisted on having burgers in them. I’m still not sure he understood the concept. Somehow Jarvis managed to make them delicious anyway. After dinner, there were presents. Tony started an art scholarship in my name. I would never have thought of that. I love it. I hugged him, and there was shuffling and throat clearing around us. But Tony smiled at me, radiating happiness, and that was rare enough. It was nice.
So anyway. I wasn’t feeling a Christmas tree this year (who decided
Subject: Re: re: re: Glacial Irregular on Fifth Avenue
The suit above him stared blankly down at them both, and Tony moaned a little under his breath. Steve had never felt so naked, vulnerable…
After that they gave the statue a Schultüte – which admittedly was my idea, as it’s really sad Americans don’t get these – and a  a ginormous sandwich board reading “School is cool” on the front and “Don’t do drugs” on the back. There was some fine print though:
Then Steve heard it: the distinctive hum of repulsors powering up. “Tony?” he asked, voice breaking. What if he missed the mark? What if this is a supervillain, a shape-shifter, someone possessing Tony?
Steve caught Tony’s hand, wrapped it around Tony’s own bare cock, guiding him as he frantically jerked into their hands. Tony’s eyes were wild and locked on Steve’s face. “Deeper, please, please, it needs you so deep in me, love...” Steve’s fucked Tony relentlessly, one hand guiding his hips as Tony fucked their intertwined hands. “Tony…. I don’t think I can hold back any more…”
And Steve couldn’t move, not a millimeter.
“What?” Tony asked, blinking, the picture of aroused confusion.
Unfazed by that, Justice continued, “We have to think bigger, bolder. It is two holidays in one, right? So, I went through Stark’s old inventions.”
Steve decided. It would probably get this phase over with, whatever it was, if he went along with the program.
But he does.
Seemingly out of nowhere, Professor Xavier was blocking our path with his chair and flailing away with a sledgehammer at the foundations of everything good in my life.
“That’s a shame,” he said. “I thought it was kind of fun. But you can’t stop it before I get a turn. That wouldn’t be right. Here, pull up that stepladder to the front of the statue and help me with this thing.” He was looping some sort of belt around to the front of the statue. His arms were just a fraction of an inch too short to work the buckle, no matter how proportionally narrow his effigy’s waist might be.
I had to say something. “On the left that’s…” Was there a safe way out of this?
Steve shook his head. “No, I mean… Tony… whatever this thing is made to do, I don’t think that’s…” he struggled for the phrase, “I don’t think that’s what this wants us to do.”
National Equality Day.
“No, really, baby, I need an extra set of hands. One hand.” Steve thought about going for that opening, he did, but Tony had promised this “Lassie protocol” was just a one-day project, in a way that made Steve think that he was probably on the mark, but that was only if he was uninterrupted. Tony clipped the widget to the neck of his shirt. It whined in a way that was probably not audible to non-enhanced hearing, and Tony turned his back to Steve. “Come at me.”
“God, that’s hot. I can… oh!” cried Tony, his voice breaking, as Steve, without ceremony or preliminary, took Tony’s penis deep into his throat and began to (there was no other phrase for it) fuck his own face with Tony’s cock. “You.. have no gag reflex… that’s… what? Oh! Please, please...” He tapped Steve’s head.
“Bob?”
We'll have no pillow but our arms.
2: A truly enormous flowered hat worthy of Lady Bracknell, a parasol tucked under one arm, and a shoulder sash emblazoned with“Votes for Women!” Steve looked like we’d hit him with a brick, then grinned that dopey, million-watt grin at us and told us he liked it.
He put a steadying arm around my waist, but somehow my heartbeat didn’t go down. And I knew that he wasn’t carrying a gun, not holstered there. I swallowed. “Yes,” he whispered. “Very dangerous. So maybe we can go someplace safe. And talk.”
, if you can imagine Steve with a beard. Half of us just about died.
Tony tossed something at the suit, which raised its arm and caught it in a truly impressive catch.
And, in case the pillow should prove too wise,
For the record, I was not staring at Wanda’s ass. I was merely following the conversation and the principals happened to be hovering. I am over our… whatever it was. Completely over it. Never even crossed my mind. Besides, her cape doesn’t billow nearly as much as it does in the artists’ depictions. It’s not like we have giant fans in every room.
“Sort of. It’s more… feedback. I can tell there’s pressure, and warmth, but you can’t really stroke me and make me want to purr.” He grinned. “Now, if I…” and Tony retracted the undersheath and sent the ESD plates to the couch behind him, leaving Steve holding his bare wrist. “What does that feel like to you?”
“Babe. Give me a little credit, here?” The waves of power against his skin were not unlike the jets of a hot tub… pushing against his muscles, kneading him, manhandling him, all with the sense of barely-restrained power, danger… the repulsors turned down, then off, to be replaced with a narrower sense of almost-unbearable stinging heat, one finger wide, roughly the intensity of the snap of a rubber band… it seared a path around first one nipple, then the other, lingering, growing more intense as Steve gasped, hating it, needing it, craving
The suit unlatched something in its wrist and, with delicate precision, a saw blade flashed and cut off his shirt, his jeans, his boxers. He pushed his shoes off his feet, stepped on his socks to pull them off, kicked them away.
He met Stark’s eyes in the mirror. There was no surprise in them, just weariness and a delayed-action, bleary smile. It figured. If he made it out of here, he’d spend a long night or three finding out whether their source knew that she was feeding them not juicy secrets, but bait--- and that meant he’d have to figure out who his source was.
“We?” Tony repeated. “Who’s ‘we?' Oh!” Rogers wrapped one broad hand around the nape of his neck and marched him like a recalcitrant child, straight into the hexagon of painters’ tape marking the edge of the field. “Oh! Wow!” he waved at the fidgeting members of the meeting. “Hey, guys! Over here! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!” he called, and executed a complex series of claps against his body, ending with his hands in his ears and his tongue blowing a raspberry. “Two million to the first person who touches their nose…” No-one reacted.  “This is great!”
“He thinks he’s hiding it, but really, Captain Rogers, I think you may be the very last person in the room, if not the solar system, not to know. We’ve all been waiting for you to get a clue and deal with him.”
Tony shrugged. "Might as well get comfortable." Steve pulled off his cowl, gloves, and boots.
This is a risk.
dream," she said, "Please let me never wake up."
The dress was gone as fast as it had appeared. On the following Tuesday there was an intermission with a shorter pink version. While putting it up, Angel said, “It would still be a maxi dress on anyone else,” which was answered by questioning frowns from the gentlemen in the room. Except for Tony, who seemed to get the joke, and Steve who has developed the habit of smiling benevolently at everything anybody says as if not to discourage them.
Firestar drew up her eyebrows. “But when I found out that Alicia Masters works solely by touch, I was surprised by the… package?”
Darling. You’ll never believe it. Apparently the good Captain nixed the flag toga by citing the “Flag Code” or some nonsense, so they knocked up a barbecue grill the size of a studio apartment, a metre-wide tie, and a “Kiss the Cook” apron for Fathers Day.
Tony stared up at him helplessly, his cock jolting as it spattered white drops of come across his chest and Steve’s forearm. They looked at each other, panting, considering this development. Tony pulled Steve’s head down and began to lick his face penitently, whining softly.
"The glowing ruby should adorn
...have an amazing caterer. You think I’m joking, but we once detected an attempted AIM infiltration because those posing as the caterers used crummy store-bought eggnog, even though they tried to punch it up with melted ice cream (no, I’m not kidding) and enough happy drugs to (almost) wipe the scowl off Namor’s face. Stan and Joan have never failed me. I don’t know what I’ll do when they’re gone… aw, who am I kidding? They’re going to live forever, a man, his stunning wife, his appalling mustache, and an army of Brownian-motion berserker-waiters in ink-stained tuxedo pants. (I think he hires directly from CUNY’s arts undergrad program.)

You can back off any time now. My love life is complicated enough as it is, thank you oh-so-much.” But he just kept grinning.
"No names, ma'am. Unless," he whispered conspiratorially, his breath coming back against his lips, "you prefer... bitch? Slut?" The shiver against him and the sudden increase in slickness made him pray that this was a recurring dream. He slid his left hand under her to play with her other breast.
“It’s funny, I didn’t think I’d need to sweat, but it’s a really efficient means of temperature regulation. And look, I still get goosebumps.”
Steve frowned. “Are you cold? We can see if we can---”
Steve was on a ladder, polishing the statue clean with some kind of brush and a soft rag.
“I love you, my good boy,” Steve replied.
He was so fucking sick of explanations.
“And you lot decided to dress Ms. Masters’ wonderful artwork up in daffodil-yellow plush?” Well, I would have chosen primrose yellow, but the rose bow was a nice touch.
"Shut up, Winghead,"  she--- he?--- said, running her (fine, whatever, her, for now) fingers through her hair and gathering his hands in hers. "Look. This is a dream. This is the only way I can have you, God knows, because you're perfect and you never bend the teeniest bit and that means you're so straight you make lasers look wiggly but God help me, I'm going to take you any way I can get you, if it doesn't mean losing you, but you're my best friend and I love you and I can't coerce you even when there are zero consequences, so if I'm going to have to let that," and she looked down at the still-glistening erection that had, humiliatingly, not gone down a millimeter since she'd called him by his name, "go to waste, let me know now and go away so I can get myself off again before the real you wakes me up and tells me that the Inhumans have got themselves stuck in a bathtub again and this is somehow putting the universe in peril so only we can save it but if you're going to fuck me by God let's
“Guys, looks like it’s going to be at least another six hours before we can let you out of quarantine. I’m sorry,” the voice over the intercom said, with every indication of genuine regret. It paused. “The good news is, we’ve ruled out pretty much every terrestrial disease that can be tested for, and you’re probably not cursed.”
“Except when they are prescribed. Especially if they are essential to your continued well-being. Or it is a government-sanctioned research project and you get to fight Nazis in the end, just to wake up decades later to join a team of like-minded (most of the time) people, only some of whom have taken (partly government-sanctioned) drugs (others might have taken drugs for recreational purposes, but stopped (probably)(we are not including legal drugs because than we have a whole other discussion on our hands (drug policies are built around economic realities (which might not be a problem, but we are not doing PoliSci here))). As I said nobody is taking any drugs (except the one time we went to the spa and every time Steve got up from the treatment chair his robe was clenched between his buttocks and he tried to free it with a very awkward dance because the nice treatment specialists were looking at him inquiring if he needed something, and I just wanted to get a snapshot of it and didn’t look where I was going and stubbed my toe so hard on a fountain that I broke it, and I had to take painkillers for a week)).”
The intercom chimed. “Mr. Stark, is there a headset? We have new data, and it’s… it may be sensitive.”
A bunch of festivals involving the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
Not that Tony ever quite stopped talking. Right then he was explaining code, something about fight responses, to DUM-E, gesturing extravagantly and replying, “I’m glad you asked,” to apparently random servo whirrs and, amusingly, “You’re right! What was I thinking?” He turned away to make a series of minute adjustments to some sort of... button attached to a clip, still keeping up a steady stream of what Bruce called “ducksplaining” (Steve steadfastly refused to ask) at the robot.
The suit behind him released his arms. “Tony, I’m so sorry, baby, I tried not to come until you said…" he cried out. Good, God, were those tears pricking at his eyes? He fought to his feet, his legs not wanting to work and wobbling dangerously with aftershocks.
“And it just… shrinks into your skin?”
“Besides,” Stark sailed on, ignoring the pop culture reference with uncharacteristic dignity, “I could hardly give it a socialist theme. I mean, it’s
“Wait, Iron Man defected during your Civil War? How did that even happen?”
“Vance, you’re going to burn the house down.” At least Firestar had some sense.
“Of course now, Captain. Dampening alarm subroutines on your mark,” chirped Friday.
International Cat Day.
Any day that he wasn’t fighting off cockamamie clone shenanigans or howling misunderstood sorcerers or the Brotherhood of Evil Et Ceteras (so, about every third or fourth day), one of us would holler, “Boot up to suit up” (I don’t know, Tony used his repulsor boots instead of a ladder and it kind of stuck), and there we’d be, zipping around ten feet off the ground dressing up Cap and jabbering about everything in general and nothing in particular.
“No loss of sensation, but I can dampen any pain responses now. I still keep the little stuff to remind me not to lean on stoves, but it’s handy in a fight, not getting overwhelmed, and they’ll have to dig out Barney videotapes to torture me without very specialized equipment.”
He barely had an instant before Tony pulled back, lazily aligning his mouth centimeters from Steve’s own, and Tony cocked an eyebrow. “I’m too tired to use a footrub tonight, Threepeo. Let’s just…” and Tony’s mouth covered his, devouring.
I should have been staying away. But obviously I’m not capable of doing anything reasonable these days. And since nobody else is seemingly going to say it, I have to do that myself too: Steve, you are an idiot. But July was bound to be the worst so far. And I preferred to get a picture before the laughing and cheering began. Just three days before, they had glued gigantic frowning eyebrows on the thing. And then this. I had fended off the Stars and Stripes last month. I could not hope to be so lucky this time. Although ... it could’ve been worse.
7: We filled the ballroom with “shooting stars” and tucked a telescope and star charts under the arm of the statue.
It wasn’t so nice when the gathered ex-Avengers walked behind the statue and began to stare at its … backside.
“Just… can you get to that cherub over there and pull its sash down about an inch, inch and a half? Without attracting attention.” Steve frowned. He didn’t lecture me on the difference between cherubim and putti, that’s how seriously he was taking me.
The color drains from her face. “I’m really sorry,” she says, “I panicked.”

his ass. The cold seeps in through his clothes; his cotton shirt and jeans are not enough. But he laughs. He laughs long and hard.
"Jarvis?" Steve asked, flicking his eyes up to the ceiling. "What's the average amount of time between meals for Tony?"
"You can’t expect him to just jump in!" Steve rested his palms on a table. "Are you stupid?! He will get killed!"
"Hmmm" Steve pressed deeper into the knot, leaning over to whisper in Tony's ear. "Are you sure?"
Steve's grin slid into a smirk. "I have my ways. One of them has red hair."
" 'M not hungry this morning, will eat lunch." He said, fixing his cup of coffee. "Promise." He added, walking back towards the elevator.
"Tony you don’t even know how to throw a punch! I just want you safe"
Tony rolled his eyes. “That wasn’t my question.” he huffed
“Can’t I just go lay down?” He whined slightly, stretching
Steve about melted at that grin, his own lips curling into a smile. He slid on the gloves, crouching a bit to plant himself. "Okay, punch the center of the pad." Tony nodded and did as he was told, punching the middle of the pad as hard as he could. "Good!" Steve grinned. "Again, use your other hand this time"
Steve chuckled huskily. "Anytime, Tones."
"Tony you don’t even know how to fight! How can he when he doesn’t know how to fight?" He almost snarled at Fury. "I won’t have someone in the field that would be a sitting duck!" he demanded.
“Goodbye, Steve.” He said calmly, ignoring the super soldier
"C’mon, Tony. Please."
"Feel good?" He asked, his voice coming out rougher.
“Steeeeveee” He whined out, blushing when he realized how that sounded.
Steve sucked the lube into his mouth, hands wandering. "Turn over." He almost growled. Tony whimpered and did as he was told, fumbling a little
"Well, we have to stop for food breaks" he teased, digging his thumbs into a large knot between his shoulder blades.
Tony’s heart stuttered a moment before he frowned “No.” He said firmly
Tony looked up and pouted “low blow, Cap, low blow”
“No.,” he said shaking his head.
"Stark. We have figured out what the monster does." Came Fury's voice into his com as he was sneaking between two pieces of debris. "Barton just woke up. He said it made him re live his worst memories before he woke up." Tony swallowed thickly, nodding before realizing fury couldn't see him.
Tony chewed on his lip a moment before running a hand through his damp hair “Okay.” He finally said, following Steve
Tony was a babbling mess at this point, Steve was hitting his prostate multiple times. “Close” he managed.
Steve let out a tiny sigh of relief as the others agreed. "Well, that's that then."
"They'd be in for a big surprise that's for sure." Steve laughed.
"You're welcome. And this is too heavy for that arm today" Tony mocked his words childishly, rolling his eyes fondly.
Steve was instantly at his side, looking over the damage while Clint chased down the cyclist that had clipped Tony. "Shit, Tony." He cursed softly, wincing. "That looks dislocated."
When Steve woke he could see Tony standing before what almost looked like a projector screen. A screen that had Howard yelling at a tiny Tony Stark. Oh, God.
“Plotting against me with my own AI?” Tony said in amusement, eyebrow still raised.
Steve sighed softly, shoulders slumping as he walked out. He paused outside the labs, absently looking up. "Make sure he eats, please Jarvis?"
Steve's eyes darkened, his grin turning just a bit darker. "C’mon, Tones, one more. You can take it"
"There we go. This one is much tighter than the rest, had this one long?" He asked, leaning into the massage.
"Tony, what the hell, you lived through all that but you couldn't let it hit me?" Steve was bewildered, hugging Tony tightly.
Steve stepped closer, taking a deep breath. "Why did...why are.." he stopped, rubbing his face.
Tony grumbled a “Fine”
"....why do you want to go so badly?" Steve asked, confused.
“Should I get used to handsome blonde men cooking for me?” Tony asked, without even thinking about what was coming out of his mouth.
“God yes.” Tony groaned “Please Steve.” he begged.
“I’m fine.” He said with a one-shoulder shrug as the elevator opened and he entered.
Steve nodded, giving in to the impulse to kiss Tony's cheek. "Please be careful"
Tony dozed, but Tony being Tony he couldn’t sleep. The genius slipped out of Steve’s hold and grabbing his clothes and throwing them on haphazardly before heading down to his lab to tinker with his latest project
Steve smiled; his voice soft. "Just like that. You don’t have to worry about the head, I just didn’t want you hurt."
“A-ah!” He moaned softly “I sound w-what?” He asked, still breathless
Steve gave home a grim smile. "You'll be in a sling a couple of weeks" he warned, even as he grabbed Tony's arm, waiting until he had a good stance before popping it back into place. He took off his hoodie, fashioning a makeshift sling as Natasha slipped into a nearby drugstore to get one.
Steve gave him a crooked, dark grin. "Oh no, babydoll. I ain't no saint." He leaned down, sucking a nipple into his mouth as he quickly stripped them both of their pants.
“Sir, Mr stark has ordered food to be delivered” Jarvis informed Steve.
Tony woke up about 10 hours later, starving. He groaned, rolling out of bed. “J. I need food.”
“Damnit. Just give me some time to cool off!” He said, tossing the wrench down and leaning against the work table.
Fury kept his composure “You seem to be letting your.... friendship...with stark get in the way of the mission, Rogers.” He said
Tony let himself dramatically fall to the mat with a huff “Us tiny humans are exhausted“ he complained.
"Morning" Steve murmured, soaking in the sight of a sleepy Tony. He wished he had been able to experience it. He doubts hed be able to talk to Tony. He put the plate of food in front of Tony.
“You didn’t mess up.” He said with an overdramatic sigh. “Now leave me alone.” He huffed.
"Gorgeous, babydoll." He groaned, slowly sliding forward, not stopping until he bottomed out
“Thanks, J.” He grumbled, grabbing him a pair of pajama pants, not bothering with a shirt. Everyone had seen the scars. He’d explained them away pretty well, the torture overseas put most of the questions to rest. But in reality, he’s only gotten two or three from there, it would have been a lot worse if Rhodey hadn’t shown up when he did with his army and kicked everyone’s ass. Tony headed for the elevator, going down to the common’s kitchen, padding over to the counter automatically when he smelled the fresh food
Tony ducked his head so the sling could go over his head. “Thanks.” He said softly.
Tony licked his lips and nodded. “I don’t think I can throw you around like a rag doll,” he said with a laugh
Tony took a deep breath “Yeah. I’m okay.” He said, giving a small smile. Steve stayed close to Tony the rest of the way home. Tony walked slowly, holding his arm the entire way, plopping down on the couch when he finally got upstairs Steve got him some anti-inflammatory meds, handing them over with a glass of water and a small smile. “Thanks” Tony said, letting his head fall back against the couch with a sigh.

for Arbor Day.
Instead of making the best statue dress-up yet a reality, I let Tony do Halloween. We were all shut out of the ballroom for three days. This had better be the most awesome Halloween costume to ever grace this city.
“‘I learned it from you,’” Steve quoted.
Confession time: every year, I root for the Grinch. That holiday’s like and out-of-control juggernaut (with none of the rough charm of the actual villain), distorting family, flight paths, and the economy. It shits on both retail workers and people who don’t personally ally themselves to this one particular god, forcing us to listen to covers of the same twenty songs on a loop twenty-four hours a day. I hate the whole mess. It’s emotional blackmail and hollow loneliness, and the only thing that redeems it is sneaking out to bars at 10 p.m. to bond with fellow escapees, or, these days, the burnt coffee, cigarettes, and fluorescent lighting of an AA meeting. That’s the true meaning of Christmas for you: family. Specifically, escaping family.

“You weren’t even here when that happened! Okay, look, I’m just processing. This is… this is like atheist Christmas.” He tapped some instructions into the air, the card clipped to his shirt
want? Are you okay with this?” It was obviously getting hard to fight the influence of… whatever it was. Tony’s asshole was pulsing, drawing his index fingertip in, practically begging the second finger to scissor him open.
She tensed. "You do have the best ideas... okay, let's see if you or my subconscious is going to fuck me now. Worth the risk. I'm turning around. Don't freak out. I've got this thing, it's kind of like a pacemaker and holy shit, Steve?"
"Oh?" she purred, "like this? Go ahead." She brought her dripping finger to his lips, and he grabbed her hand, sucking and licking it clean. He shook his head. "Not what I meant."
Steve glared around the room. “We are not to be interrupted for any reason short of Armageddon for ten minutes. Anyone who does can pay Stark’s consulting fees for the past hour out of their own pocket. Friday. Ten minutes. Now!” Uncomfortable glances shot around the conference table.
“I mean--- well, I think it wants…” Tony drew his hands away to start undoing the hidden catches on Steve’s uniform, kissing and licking the skin as it became exposed, indicating mild surprise at the sensitivity of Steve’s pebbled nipples. He kissed his way down Steve’s abdomen, murmuring at the perfection of his muscles, nipping at his hipbones, inhaling the faint musk as Steve’s cock sprang free. He looked up at Steve, a smouldering question in his eyes. Steve could only swallow and nod. Tony lipped and licked and tasted every inch of Steve’s skin as Steve shuddered and cried, “Oh, God, Tony, your
“What?” Steve could smell Tony’s desire, and he was sure he was making a wet spot on his jeans, but Tony unclasped and took a step back. His pupils were blown, his lips were red and shining with their spit, and he was panting in unison with Steve. Right. There was no lost moment here, and if Steve had to fight to get this back, then… he sank to his knees, eyes locked with Tony’s, licking his lips, sliding his hands down his thighs, making his meaning plain. “Tony…”

Jennifer Walters seems in the same vein. She finishes the rest of her coffee, sucking up bits of half-melted ice with the already worn straw. It’s loud, but it doesn’t draw enough attention to warrant Stark’s stare; his eyes rest firmly on Bucky.

He was met with pin drop silence. “Guys?”
The first thing saw was white blinding light. He turned squinting his eyes which fell on a figure sitting beside is hospital bed. The brown curled hair which was disheveled easily gave away who was seated beside Steve.
Everyone had left hours ago and Tony was quite sure it was three in the morning by how silent everything around them was, but he couldn’t get himself to sleep. No matter how much he tried every time he closed his eyes the images of Steve screaming, his flesh being cut open, his face contorted in pain would appear in front of Tony’s eyes and he would have to jerk awake and try to get his heartbeat under control.
Steve was the first one to pull away and see how beautiful Tony looked, as he broke into a grin.
Tony spoke up, “He isn't with them,
hi, i know it's been so long and i'm sorry but i got so caught up. Also i have no idea how to trace signals i'm writing that portion on my knowledge gained from movies and the limited cs i have studied in high school. also i have no idea about borders or the geographical area surrounding Russia so sorry for any mistakes about that as well.
can goddamn wake up and tell me this himself.” Tony said sternly ending any further conversation.
Steve.
After that, hours went by but Steve was still unresponsive, the doctors assured them that he was okay but still asleep as his body was still rejuvenating from all the trauma it had endured.
Everyone rushed to the communal floor, a shaky video appearing on the huge LED in the lounge. There was a shaky feed on the tv showing Steve chained to the walls, hands hanging in air with something that looked like metal bands, the same bands on his ankles. Tony inhaled a shaky breath and fell on the couch, Bucky started swearing, his right hand trembling and sat on the armchair on the opposite end from the couch. Clint drew out a loud motherfucker and rubbed a hand through his hair down his face, whereas Nat stood stock still in front of the television. Nothing actually was happening at the moment on the feed but the message was quite clear. Time seemed to stretch out every second feeling longer than it actually was. What seemed like hours but actually were minutes someone entered in the room in which Steve was tied up. A girl with short black hair but she had her back toward the camera. Steve never broke eye contact with her, glaring at her with a coldness in his eyes that was even visible even through the trashy quality of the video feed. As soon as she started speaking Tony called out to JARVIS to start a voice recognition algorithm and start tracking possible matches.
“It wasn’t your fault sweetheart,” Steve started in a soft tone, but before he could say more Tony’s eyes filled with tears and he collapsed on Steve’s bed, taking care of the tubes sticking out of his body, and tucked his head in Steve’s neck.
“What’s happening here guys and where’s Stevie?” Bucky asked as he entered the common floor, probably coming from the gym if the state of sweat on his arms and the towel slung on his shoulders had anything to say.
“So, it’s present time,” Clint piped up, clapping his hands, when everyone had settled with their plates that were loaded with slices of pizza. “I am gonna start with mine. Here you go Cap, sooo I am not really and feely guy but thanks for being an amazing friend and leader. Go on open it up.” Clint said with a hint of nervousness but mirth clear in his eyes which was clue enough that his gift was going to be something he thought was hysterical. As soon as Steve opened it, he burst out laughing. It was a Captain America teddy bear with a skirt instead of leggings holding a miniaturized wool shield. As soon as everyone else saw it they dissolved into various levels laughter. Bucky was outright howling. Steve blushed and mumbled a thank you to Clint and moved on to the next gift.
All through this Tony was still holding on to Steve’s hand tightly as if scared that if he let go Steve will disappear. Steve couldn’t help but smile at such cuteness of Tony. Mind you he knew this was no situation to smile at and if Tony saw Steve smiling like a dork he would probably smack him on his head but Steve had just woken up and the love of his life was right there beside him, going anarchic over him and he could feel his heart going all fluttery.
“He was unstable for quite some time, and his healing wasn’t kicking in his skin was broken too badly, and all the places where his skin was cut out, they had to sew him up so that the tissues would regenerate. God I can’t even believe what I'm saying, but whatever was in that liquid that they were depositing in his body, was used to paralyze him and the doctors couldn’t figure out what it was made of so they just had to leave up to his body to drain it, which is why that tube is still protruding from his stomach. His chest would need a lot of time to heal, the doctors didn’t know how to heal all the lacerations and jagged parts where the dagger had been dragged down. Right now, he is stable because somehow the anesthesia Tony and I had worked on for Steve worked an he’s in a deep sleep, let’s just hope that he doesn’t fall into a coma because the amount of agony his body had to go through it’s a major possibility and I don’t even want to start on the extent of PTSD this will bring.” Finished Bruce leaving everyone silent and shocked at the amount of hurt their Captain had to go through.
in Tony’s eyes that Steve had to swallow back a whimper.
Honestly, Tony knew what it looked like to the others when Steve called him right after saying he was heading up to bed but Tony didn’t care. He was so excited but nervous as well about showing Steve his gift. He knew Steve would love it but maybe he’ll think it’s too much? Or he won’t like that it was Tony giving him that? Would it be too obvious and Steve will realize how much hopelessly in love Tony is and everything will be ruined? He was kind of scared for what Steve might think but he put a stop to his thoughts.
“Listen to me sweeetheart, and listen carefully, yes I got hurt, and it would take some time to get over the trauma I brought with me but not once while I was tied in that horrendous place did, I blame you for anything. Rather it was quite the opposite. Tony, the thought of you was what kept me going through all of it. Knowing you will be looking for me, you will come to find me, and I'll finally get to hold you was what made me not give up. So please don’t blame yourself, I just need you here with me now. That's all.” Steve completed; his voice all soft his eyes full of adoration directed towards Tony.
“Oh, look at that right to the point, I like that. You see our request is quite simple, how about you start telling us about Tony Stark.”
“Well, then
“Sir, there is an incoming signal coming from an unknown server, it's a live video, I would recommend you all to come in the living room to view it” JARVIS spoke up cutting Bucky’s freak out.
It's been a week since Steve or any other member of the team was sent on a mission. Everyone was preoccupied; first on missions to find the Winter Soldier, and then on helping him settle in the tower and while Bruce and Tony were occupied with the deprogramming. Finally, Bucky was settling in the tower at a good rate, Sam the in-built therapist of the Avengers was gladly helping Bucky with his recovery. So, it was time to get back on the whole enemy-fighting business. SHIELD had the mission ready, supposedly one of the simpler one’s. Ambush the site save the hostages and equipment and walk out. But it wasn’t always that simple where Steve and HYDRA were involved. The warehouse was large, Steve had gone through the blueprints in the Quinjet where he was de-briefing the team and the agents. The warehouse had 3 main entrances and Steve along with Sam and Nat went through the main one. Everything was eerily quiet as if the people there already knew what was about to happen. Nat went forward opening rooms on the ground floor, while Sam went upwards and Steve moved towards the basement. All of a sudden there was a commotion on the coms and all the channels linking the agents with Steve went dead. Steve’s instincts were screaming at him to go back and check on his team when he heard something towards the deeper end of the basement. He kept on calling out names on the coms but didn’t get a response but he trusted Nat and Sam to get the job done and look after themselves so he kept on moving towards the deeper end. Suddenly there was a loud buzz sound and cracks started to appear on the walls. The lights buzzed and crackle and suddenly everything was dark. Steve knew something wasn’t right, there was no explosion to merit the cracks nor did the pillars upholding the building moved. Looking around he saw a few green lights coming from the end of the basement. Moving slowly but with sure feet, the shield held high Steve advanced in the room and he threw open the door with a kick to its pivot. As soon as the door opened, he knew he had miscalculated everything. Bullets flew all around the room aiming towards him and the shield could and his suit could only give only so much of a protection in front of more than a dozen armed Hydra goons. All it takes is half a minute and then all Steve sees is black.
“You know it isn’t.” Yes, I knew. But that meant I had fucked something up with the flag. Vance Astrovik, the man who finally broke Tony Stark.
, but he just didn't care. If he is being honest, he's said this to himself a hundred times, a thousand times before, and he will fight it down again. And again. Dying and coming back to life is easier, even if he's had less practice at that.
REED:
“Steve…”
Okay, titanium alloy. He twisted against the thumb of the suddenly-quite-lively suit holding his wrist but, finding that ineffectual, lashed out at the core of the suit with his foot. The suit feinted and pulled him off-center. Somehow he ended up in a full Nelson. He was pretty sure he could get out of it, but not without damaging the armor.
. Your engineering, your style, it’s part of you. It would be beautiful on its own, but there’s nothing about any part of it that doesn’t say ‘Tony,’ to me, and that… It’s... strong… and---“ He took a deep breath. “Look, can we just drop this? It’s embarrassing.”
“But… it doesn’t hurt to suit up? And it feels… normal?”
, Tony, mine and no-one else’s and I will touch you any time I want from now on.” And Tony’s body spasmed and trembled at the primal need in his lover’s voice, spattering the dark armor with white seed. Without taking his eyes off Tony’s, he scraped the cum off with the blade of his hand, pressing it to Tony’s mouth to suck clean. Tony laved his fingers, sucking them in until until he gagged a little.
“Pardon?” said Steve.
“Lemme see what Stan says before we unpack this,” Tony yawned back. “I don’t know where to begin.” He smoothed a lock of Steve’s hair, a gesture either unnecessary or futile with Steve’s wet, short hair. Steve began to undo the collar again. “Steve…”
“Tony.” Steve’s voice was tight.
He turned the water off, ran his hands over Tony, smoothing the excess water off of his skin with the blade of his hands. “Stay,” he warned, toweling himself off lightly. He grabbed the hair at the nape of Tony’s neck  “Don’t shake,” he said. Feeling the beginnings of a twitch -- the punishment had been issued, but Tony in pet mode was still Tony, a consummate brat -- “No!” he said, dropping the towel onto Tony’s back to swat his nose lightly with two fingers. He toweled his lover roughly and thoroughly, almost polishing, bringing the blood to the skin. “Collar.” Tony raised himself to his knees, presenting his neck as their private ritual demanded. Steve, for his part, kissed Tony’s Adam’s apple, breathing in the scent of soap-over-clean-Tony, relishing the wave of goosebumps rippling over his arms and shoulders having nothing to do with drafts. He fastened the collar about Tony’s neck, moving to brush his mouth against the peppermint-gagged lips.
The statue itself towered at the center of all this, newly illuminated from below, making it appear even taller than before, and throwing strange shadows at the ceiling. And it was wearing a pinstripe suit and a round white mask. The costume seemed mundane compared to the rest of the decorations. Zipping around the statue’s head was the translucent, holographic form of a wiener dog with a red nose wearing a sheet. I didn’t get it.
some part of him whispered,
A dream. Of course. He was going to figure out what he ate before bed and eat nothing but that for the rest of his life. But for now... he moved his right hand to caress her breast. The nipple stiffened under his hand, and her breath caught as he circled it, teasing. "Well, as long as we're dreaming, miss, and as long as it's a good dream, I think I need to feel you come."
“That we understand what he is doing, but we would like him to stop for his own good. The Captain would have made his reciprocating feelings known by now, as Tony’s behavior does not leave any room for interpretation according to you, Angelica, Janet, Hank, Clint, Dr. McCoy–”
Firestar – Angelica,  since she was out of costume – squeaked. “Oh! We could dress it up in holiday clothes, like they do with lawn geese! Oh, say we can, Tony. You know you want to see Steve in bunny ears and a tail!”
“Tony needs this,” Angel said. “Steve coming out like that was a lot to take in for him,” she said. “It was a good idea, but this is not only about our fun anymore. Maybe it can be closure and he can let it go afterwards. You see that too, don’t you?” She was coddling me. It was working.
"What is it, Doctor? Trouble?"
He fought to keep his voice steady. "Promises, promises... miss." He bit her earlobe, sucked it gently, then positioned his hand with hers, rubbing the shaft of her clitoris rapidly but not too firmly... "Oh my GOD," she gasped, "fuck... please, please, yes," she chanted, spasming and pressing up to his hand. "Yeah?" he hissed, "you like that?" Her back writhed  against his chest and her ass pressed against his cock as she babbled blasphemies and affirmations and begged him not to stop, then suddenly stilled, out of breath. "Sorry, I need a minute. That was... intense." She snuggled against him and they panted in unison. "Wait. I have an idea." She wriggled, and his cock was between her thighs, enveloped in wetness. She rubbed against him, getting herself off.
We got down to the ground. I’m not sure that was any safer, but we talked.
Steve stopped just short of rolling his eyes. “Friday, we’re going into the hush field now. Don’t panic if your sensors don’t pick up vital signs or visuals on us for… oh, let’s say ten minutes.”
Tony sighed. “Yeah, I know. In theory, we can wait it out, but that is probably going to take a while. A good long while that we don’t have.”
This couldn’t be good. I needed to get a glimpse of what they were up to.
Steve gently turned Tony’s arm in his hand, running his fingers along the seams. “Can you feel that?” he said.
“Oh, hey, you’re naked, when did that happen? No, let me show you what I mean,” Steve said, bodily lifting Tony onto the acceleration couch.
“What?” Tony said, then sighed, “Ohhhh,” in comprehension and perfect bliss as Steve began to scratch his back. ‘I love you, Steve,” he said, his voice blurring in relaxation.
What?
“Tony?” he said, voice cracking, as Tony kissed and nuzzled the globes of his ass. Then… the slithering sensation of the point of Tony’s tongue as it licked at his asshole was like nothing he’d every felt. His knees almost buckled as it gently pushed against him, waves of sensation overcoming him, dazzling him, pulling him apart, making him want, making him need… he whimpered and stammered, pleading, calling Tony’s name and clutched at the table, unable to move, unable to do anything but gasp and moan and come apart under Tony’s skillful tongue, crying out and shaking his head from side to side. “Tony… I’m gonna… you have to stop, I’m gonna… ah…” A hand snaked to wrap around his cock, paused. “One second,” Tony said. “I’m going to get… something…” Tony stood, leaned back,...
