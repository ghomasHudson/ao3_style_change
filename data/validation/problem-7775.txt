Steve frowns. He climbs up next to the Hulk on the roof of the crushed car – it’s not much above ground level, it’s so flattened, but it’s the best he’s got – and he cups his hands into a makeshift megaphone, and he says, “Come on, folks. I know it’s not easy – heck, I know getting by in a Depression’s not easy, but this isn’t like finding a nickel in the gutter. Money in a bank is money that belongs to someone else. Sure, maybe it’s the bad guys or the folks with plenty to spare, but maybe it’s your friends, or neighbours, or your mom. That $20 you grabbed today could make the difference between whether someone goes hungry or not, later down the line.”
Leaning in close, he can see the light crackle and bubble; it moves like a stop-motion capture of an icicle forming.  Tendrils lick out from it, lightning fast even at this speed, reaching out towards the ceiling and the floor, searching for a surface to latch onto. It hits the wall at last and Butterfinger’s camera goes dark in a burst of static. The other clip keeps playing, the light spreading like frost across the wall. Tony stumbles back slowly, slowly into Steve and Steve lifts a hand up to Tony’s arm, the movement dreamlike.
“What was the guy shouting?” Barton asks. “Before Hill introduced him to her boot?”
your most pressing question?” the man groans, climbing out of the trashcans. He grabs a lid and holds it up in front of his legs, peering down at Steve. His nose is bleeding, his chest is glowing, and there are wires coiled all around his body.
“I’ll call my publicist,” Tony says.
Steve lifts his head, looking up at Tony again. “I wasn’t waiting for you. You never really seemed real, back – back then, you know. You were like some crazy dream.  I guess Peggy was, too. We never had
Yinsen pours himself a cup of tea. He holds it between both hands and blows gently on the surface of the steaming water.
from your tiny, little apartment, right?”
Already heading for the elevator, Bruce waves vaguely over his shoulder, but Steve lingers. He fiddles with the bag strap over his shoulder. It feels as if all he has done since he came out of the ice is move from point to point. The urge to stand still is sudden and overwhelming.
“We’re really doing this?”
As an afterthought, he kicks the forgotten tranq gun away. When he turns, the remaining – now slightly singed – soldiers raise their own guns to point at his chest. Out of the corner of his eye, Steve watches Billy and Teddy watching him.
“We’d like to... remain active in the field,” Romanoff translates, arching an eyebrow at him. “And continue to make use of our skill sets. We would still liaise with SHIELD where appropriate.”
“Pepper!” he calls. “Pep, two of our birds are flying the nest already! I think I’m menopausal!”
On a hard drive in a safe in a bunker, there is a video that only three living people have seen.
“I can see that,” Steve says.
Tony is thirty-nine. Tony is pulling apart his bombs to build himself a heart. A heart for his past self. The heart he should have had in the past, people would probably call it.
At Steve’s mulish expression, Tony rolls his eyes. “I can’t just turn it on, you know. Really, cannot. Believe me, I’ve tried. It’s a reflex. Needs stimulus to trigger a reaction. Think of it like you’re testing my knee with a hammer. Or we could get Thor,” he adds, with a smirk. “And his hammer.”
It smells healthy and faintly of garlic. He’s about to dip a finger inside it in the spirit of discovery when Pepper touches his shoulder. She leans smoothly around him to look at the Tupperware in his hands, and when he breathes in he can smell her jasmine soap.
“Certainly, sir. If you would be so kind as to touch the wall? Any part will do, sir,” the voice adds as Steve hesitates.
He lands in the sand, coughing, hacking. He spits up water. The suit weighs him down, but as he begins to crawl out of it he can feel that parts are missing, left behind to be eaten up by fire or to fall out of the sky, but some of it stayed. Some of it stayed.
“Good evening, Captain Rogers,” says the computer man immediately, voice emitting from somewhere right in front of Steve. There must be a speaker behind the mirror. “I trust your shower was a pleasant one?”
“It’s all part of the Stark mystique,” he says, shaking his head. “Gotta keep you on your toes.”
Barton rolls his eyes. Swinging his feet up onto the arm rest, he crosses his legs and props his elbows on his knees, his chin on his knuckles. He looks about one pointy hat and a fishing rod away from becoming a lawn ornament.
“We’ll always have Paris,” he says. He blows her a kiss and Romanoff rolls her eyes, her lips twitching.
“Light bulbs need avenging, right?”
when I’m talking to you.”
“How old’m
“Yeah.” Tony slowly wraps his shirt around his fingers, frowning down at it. “Well, if I wind up stark, hah, naked in the middle of old-time New York and cause a riot, I’m blaming you. Put it on my tombstone. Here lies Tony Stark, Steve Rogers’ fault.”
“If you two are done finger painting,” he says. “Hulk’s bored. I’m taking him out for ice cream.”
Steve pauses. He breathes into the phone. He says, “You meet him – Bucky – a couple times.”
Steve is twenty-six, or ninety-four, and sketching idly on the back of a bank statement when he hears a clatter from the kitchen. He lowers his pencil.
“I have an idea,” he says, flipping the lid of his box open. “Let’s do an experiment.”
It’s long gone dark, and Pepper is fast asleep, by the time Tony gets back home and crawls into bed beside her. He reaches out across the sheets towards her, but falls asleep with his hand in empty air.
They look at each other.
“They grabbed Mr Berenbaum’s wallet. Y’know he can’t fight guys like that anymore.”
“Black Widow,” Tony says. “Were you laughing at her, back up there in our team bonding session? Humour me. I’m checking team morale.”
“Star  Trek?”
“Hold it, Stark.”
He gapes in mock-outrage and Steve smiles. Grinning sidelong at him, Tony licks the hummus off his fingers. He contemplates, and then rocks back on his stool to dig a bag of chips out of the cupboard; when he rights himself, Steve has looked away again.
Tony stands, yawns, stretching his arms and flexing his fingers. His skin feels itchy on the inside. He walks to the window and, with a swipe of his hand, brushes the scrolling text aside to leave the view clear. The city spreads far out below him. It shines. Four months on, there is still scaffolding all around the blocks closest to the tower, the area worst hit by the attack.
There are men with guns. There is another man kneeling at their feet.
He falls silent. He presses the heels of his palms to forehead and twists his fingers tightly in his hair. Steve waits, and waits.
Steve keeps his eyes up front and focuses on the march, and on the gleam of Iron Man’s flight stabilisers floating just overhead, just out of reach.
He steps closer, bending down over it until his nose is barely an inch away from the surface, but he doesn’t just grab hold of it and start examining it like he would, Steve’s sure, with anything else. That, more than the slightly unsettled expression on his face, speaks volumes.
Steve breathes in slowly, and draws his arm back, and throws.
“I’m fine, everything’s fine,” he says. “Are
“You’re not SHIELD agents-”
He stares down at it for a while, trying to understand the sums and then, when that doesn’t work, pretending it’s a secret code that contains a secret message. That doesn’t work either.
“This is the last time you see me,” he says, barrelling on. “In your time, I mean. I’m still gonna see you – I know I still have a World Series to ruin for you – but that’s. All happened by now. To you.”
“I should probably let Fury know,” Tony murmurs. “At some point. God knows I’ve got the coolest powers of the lot of you.”
contritely. “So, um, Mr. T’s Friend. What’s happening?”
“Yes, I’m – I took my call in the lounge, so I could at least watch your conference on the TV, and then suddenly there was this power cut and we all heard
Making a thoughtful noise, Tony slowly lowers his hand. He frowns up at Steve. Steve clasps his hands behind his back and stares stonily down at him. Next to them, the machine gun racket from the microwave finishes at last and Thor, still laughing, straightens up and turns around.
Steve opens his mouth and the elevator glides to its silken halt, the doors sliding open onto the underground parking lot. Neither of them moves for a moment. Closing his mouth again, Steve rubs the back of his neck and looks out towards his motorcycle. Tony stares up at him.
Pepper taps his shoulder and he lets his hand drop.
“I did, uh – I
“That’s the magic of it – no, screw magic, that’s the
The guy cries harder.
“JARVIS, lights to 60% - no, make it 57%... And down another point five. That’s it.”
“Ah,” says Yinsen.
“Yeah,” Steve manages. He swallows once, heavily, and then again. He doesn’t need this. He doesn’t need the feel of Tony’s heartbeat under his skin. He doesn’t need –
Tony’s workstation is a mess, the desk drawers emptied all over the floor and the paperwork torn into shreds. Steve wishes he had a broom, wishes he could do something to fix the place up instead of just dismantling it further. As it is, he kicks the broken glass and metal and shattered lab equipment away, picks up and stacks the overturned drawers, then gathers the papers together into a neater pile.
Tony grabs a handful of popcorn while Thor is distracted by the show, shoving it into his mouth and speaking around it. “I’m telling you, it’s not magic. Really, it’s not. It’s just science. Say it with me, okay? Suh-eye-ence.”
“Really, truly, deeply.”
Natasha murmurs something in Russian. It’s probably a swearword.
“Thanks,” Steve says, “Mr...?”
Barton glances sideways at him and says, with a grim smirk, “Doesn’t mean he can’t be dangerous.”
“No identity match yet,” Romanoff says promptly. “He’s still out. Cap... Hill reports he started to come round in transit – the radio went haywire, so he was sedated. They were worried something might happen to the copter.”
“Light of my life,” he adds, tugging open the refrigerator door and sticking his head inside. “And still surprisingly well stocked, despite the carnage. When did I get so much food?”
“I’ll be down in...” Tony glances around the room; the atmosphere has relaxed now Steve is back and the threat has passed and the damn alarm has shut up, and people are beginning to filter out of the main room towards the staff stairs. The pace is slow. “I’ll be down in a few, okay? Gotta get everyone out of here first. Stay where you are and I’ll come find you. I’m sending Sofia down – she’s fine too.”
“Good to know.”
Tony leans around Steve’s shoulders and presses his thumb to the panel. When he lifts his hand away, Steve catches sight of a bright blue thumbprint which quickly fades away and morphs into a number pad. Tony types in a code, the lock releases with a click and a hiss and he lifts the lid. Inside the box is six rectangular pieces of what looks to Steve like shiny black plastic, packed in two rows of black foam. Tony pulls out the first two and hands one to Steve; it’s heavier than it looks, which doesn’t say a lot, and about twice as thick as his credit card.
“This is new. I thought nothing could travel with you.”
“It’s local. Whatever’s happened, looks like it’s just this hotel hit.”
When he looks up again, Tony is still there.
“Yeah, I guess you’re kinda the world expert on... things to do Denver when you’re not as dead as you thought.”
“No,” Rhodey says. “Actually, by all means, feel free to tell
my robots. They named themselves, based on, I dunno, horoscopes, colour charts, patterns in my vocabulary. Dumbasses. They’re lucky they’re not all responding to liquors.” But Tony says it with something like affection, patting the nearest robot on the back of its long, shifting neck. “Dummy, you’re on fire safety again. I’m trusting you with this. Don’t ruin it.”
“You heard me,” he says. “Come up the rear. Catch anyone who makes a break for it, but don’t
Tony blinks. His mouth twitches. His body is turning to ice. Picking up the case, Obie bends down and touches, so gently, the side of his face.
“Now tell me about the future,” Steve whispers.
“Jesus!” Steve shouts, reaching forward with his free hand to grab at the screwdriver, but Tony is hunched down over it, breathing deeply, his arm shaking and straining against Steve’s grip as he – Steve pauses, hand dropping – as he unscrews a tiny screw.
Daddy hisses, “Quiet. Be quiet, you’ll wake Tony. You know he hasn’t started yet, you’ll scare him-” gripping the boy tightly by the shoulders.
“Thataway, you can get to the staff stairs.”
She says, “Okay, what have you got?”
“I don’t-”
Steve rolls his eyes. “No, I drink, but I don’t get drunk.
Thor sits up straighter, the whole couch shaking with the motion. He looks grave. This probably
, Tony,” Steve says. “The orange goes on top.”
“The laundry chute is to your left, sir,” says JARVIS as polite as ever.
He feels bad about it as soon as he’s done it. Steve carefully undoes the rest of the safety pins, leaving them in a pile on the nightstand, and he folds the towels on the armchair.
Before he can answer, Tony snaps his fingers and exclaims, “Nope! Hold it! He’s not ready,” and dives under a side table, emerging a second later with the little reconnaissance robot clasped tightly between his hands. He sticks it back into the box still open on the floor, closing the latch tightly, and then he picks the box up and thrusts it out at Steve.
Tony is seventeen and crying, still crying, as he disappears.
, she does. Pepper’s a powerhouse - a whirlwind of organisation with an iron fist. She runs the company so hard it’d probably make even my old man weep with joy, and god knows
“I’ll shoot
“I guess I always figured the universe was too damn big and complicated,” he says slowly, “for just
Can you carry the car? I don’t know what use it’ll be as evidence since you sat on it, but we’re better safe than sorry.”
Steve is fifteen. He stares down at the backs of his hands where they’re resting on the kitchen table. He never had that growth spurt. The table wobbles on its rickety legs with every small movement of every breath he takes, so he’s trying to hold himself as still as possible. The apartment and its furnishings never were in great condition, but it was cheap and it was home and that was all they had ever needed.
We thought the hotel was under attack.”
Outside, the street is quieter than a street in New York City has any right to be. It’s three am in an alien universe where the streets are quiet and the people are scared, and Steve can deal with that. He jogs down Fifth Avenue towards the nearest park entrance, holding the image on the monitors in his mind. He knows the shape of those trees; if he focuses and mentally breaks the park down into a grid, he should be able to place them before he even reaches the path.
important microwaving functions?”
“Now would be,” Tony grits out through clenched teeth, the armour rattling around him because it was built to blow up bombs, not to carry them. He can
Steve’s hand drops. Then he lifts it up again and presses his hand against his mouth.
“Well, I know for a fact that’s not true,” Steve says. “If nothing else, you and JARVIS gossip like a pair of old ladies in a grocery store.”
Tony nods. Steve doesn’t stick around to watch him disappear.
“In retrospect, I should probably aim away from doors,” Clint Barton calls from the other end of the workshop, lowering his bow.
“Oh, we’ll see about
They drift back into silence, watching the bag fill back up with its lost money. It’s a sunny day still, despite the approach of fall, and Steve can feel the Iron Man suit giving off heat next to him like a warm body.
“Do you ever appear here when I’m at school?” he asks.
Howard Stark looks about twenty years younger than Tony. Howard Stark’s red car looks more like a spaceship.
He motions and Tony leaps forward eagerly, tugging the zipper down, his mouth running a mile a minute while he digs into the bag.
“Or both?”
Although he did make the agent a cup of coffee first. He figures being self-reliant doesn’t mean being rude, wherever you might be.
“Tony,” Steve says, the second he reappears.
Lifting Tony’s dangling arm, he eases it back up onto the mattress, untangling the shirt. Tony’s breath catches at the movement and his eyes slit open.
“No, this is T’s – friend. He’s busy right now,” Steve adds, glancing to the side at Tony’s motionless form.
“Hit the lights, JARVIS,” he says through his fingers. “Update me. You know, the usual.”
“Thor calls it another realm.”
Tony’s mouth is slightly open, his face turned towards the window, as though he fell asleep watching the sunset or the stars. With every breath he lets out slowly, the hand on his stomach curls and uncurls in the loose folds of his open shirt. And the arc reactor glows.
“Go!” he hisses to some inner part of himself, and he feels his body rising up, or his stomach swooping down. He imagines, for a heartbeat, that he is pure electricity.
Bruce shrugs, shaking his head. “Never seen it before. It doesn’t
“Close your eyes.”
“Tony.”
“Steve’s a good role model,” Bruce says.
There is the sound of footsteps.
, Tony? This thing was a portal, you
,” she says, quickly thumbing through the pages. “What are the coordinates for this base? I need to-”
Tony looks down at himself, huffing out a breath. “That does it, I’m going home via the car wash.”
Later, he watches Pepper touch a hand to the battered edge of the helmet. She sucks in a sharp breath.
They thrust Tony’s head under the water.
One of the few other moviegoers shushes them loudly, so Steve settles back in his seat. The woman on screen is still alive, edging down a corridor with her back to the wall, her hair a mess and her nightdress torn, her panicked breathing filling the screenroom in surround sound. Steve watches the back of Tony’s head. The other Tony in the other world could easily plough through several days without sleep, without worry. This isn’t, he has to remind himself, keeps on having to remind himself, that same Tony.
Tony stares at Steve, eyes narrowed, as if he’s trying to will a curse word past Steve’s lips with the power of his mind. Steve only clenches his jaw tighter, meeting his gaze unflinchingly until Tony huffs out an amused breath and looks away.
“Do you offer
“You’re telling me. I have all this
“I understand the date just fine, Stark,” he says. “It’s everything else I’m having trouble with, here.”
“This is the last time,” Tony says.
He looks down again.
“Don’t blame me when you run out of arrows,” Tony says.
Steve presses a button at random and the screens all flick to new views, a mishmash of random shots of Manhattan, before they change obstinately back.
As he takes aim, Steve is already starting forwards with a shout, ready to pull the gun out of Tony’s hands, when Tony himself pauses. Steve grabs hold of his elbow before he can stop himself, and Tony cocks his head to the side, smirking up at him. He lowers the gun again.
, if nothing else. Tony twists his hand obligingly so the hologram spins in the air, components passing inches from Steve’s eyes.
“You’re
“Well?” Tony says.
Pepper whispers, “Long enough.”
Tony looks around himself and lets out a groan, which becomes a yawn. “Pep’s away. Couldn’t sleep without her icy feet kicking me every five minutes, so I went for a stroll.”
The man throws his hands up in mock-surrender. “Sorry, sorry, my bad.”
“Pretty much. A pulse at this frequency sent through my body should induce a – what should I call it in the research paper, a temporal incident? Suppress the frequency and, yada yada, in theory it’ll suppress the incident too.”
It’s the first time he’s spoken since they started playing this stupid game and Tony turns to look at him. He’s still sitting there cross-legged, looking calm and thoughtful as he leans forwards to listen to Thor’s answer. His hair fastidiously parted, his hands folded in his lap. The tips of his ears are still pink and Tony still doesn’t know if it was laughter or disapproval that he had hidden behind his hand.
“What do you mean?”
“I mean, folks didn’t curse around civilians, and I was filmed a lot so I always had to be careful, got into the habit of just
He turns left in the antechamber, to the door that is so small and innocuous compared to the heavy steel of the Hulk playground-cum-test chamber. He dials in a quick code and, when the door unlocks with a click, steps through into the small, white room. There’s nothing inside it but a smooth, black panel on the wall opposite. He presses a hand to it, and then leans forward for the retinal scan. After a few seconds, the black ripples and fades into a solid field of green.
“What? No, come on, I happen to know for a
“I... haven’t, yet. What? Even easy things take effort, sometimes. I’m an engineer, not a wizard. I don’t conjure, I
His fingers dig in. Obie’s never known his own strength.
“Well, congratulations. You got your wish.” At last, Tony manages to unlatch the disc. He yanks it out of the socket and throw it onto the grass, where steam rises from it. “Those crazy kids are gonna make it and the bad guys know you exist. You realise we can’t go back home now? They’re going to rewind the footage and work out you came from Stark Manor and then Big Brother S will put together every stupid little slip-up that
“Will blood do?”
It takes another couple of days - of Steve drifting through the cave when he’s not working out, examining everything on the long metal shelves and in the dusty boxes, picking things up and wondering
. Fire roars out of the soldier's fingertips too fast, blazingly hot, and for a second Steve reels back, dragging the Kaplan kid with him. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see the other soldiers shouting, drawing back as well.
“But before?”
“Duck!” Steve shouts to Billy, launching himself forward as the soldier snaps his fingers and throws his hands out with a
Treading softly, Steve moves into the room. He eases his bag off his shoulder and onto the floor, and he switches on a bedside lamp. In the dim wash of yellow light, Tony comes back to life again.
Tony is walking down a corridor in the dark, towards the sound of voices.
“You okay?” he says. “Hey, it’s something to tell the kids about, right?”
“JARVIS?”
She laughs, and then – at Steve’s quizzical look – laughs harder. She shakes her head, waves a hand. “Forget I spoke. I’m sorry, I – I’m not fit for human company today anyway. And I’ve got all this paperwork to sign, so you should just get out while you can.”
of fighting alone. Right now, I could really go for some back up.”
“We have a winner.”
Somewhere down there, Pepper screams.
Bruce refolds his shirt and zips his bag back up, shouldering it. He squeezes Tony’s arm. “I’ll see you in a couple weeks, Tony.”
There’s something on the other side of that blue-white light.
Pulling his cell out again, Tony takes a few photos and sends them all to Rhodey. When he looks up from his cell, Steve is still frowning, gazing down at the sign in his hands.
“You’re too kind, sir.”
Tony listens to the sound of Steve’s footsteps coming closer. The workshop is cool and dark and he listens, too, for the sound of the rain before he remembers that was the time he left behind. He lifts his head.
He turns to Tony, who has already turned back to his work.
They reach the bottom of the stairs. Behind them the flight was folding back up, the facade of tarmac slotting into place to leave no trace behind. They’re left in a short expanse of corridor, brickwork at one end and rock face at the other.
He drops his hand when Steve doesn’t respond, though he’s still smiling faintly as he looks away, rummaging around the clutter for a screwdriver. Natasha pushes the portal gun back towards him and Tony grabs at it eagerly. He runs his thumb along the barrel until he finds that panel again, jabbing the end of the screwdriver into the edge with a satisfied smirk.
Natasha nods and returns to her breakfast, apparently satisfied. Tony, meanwhile, strides across the floor and, sweeping detritus out of the way with an arm, drops the portal gun onto the work surface before them.
“Yeah, well, maybe that’s because he had you.”
“We need to move.”
“I guess. If you asked. You’re the leader, right?” He does the errant button up at last and only then looks up at Steve. “Are you asking?”
Tony holds still, tilting his chin up so Pepper can straighten his collar.
Nodding Tony pulls his shades out of his pocket and slips them on. Over his shoulder, he hears Thor mutter, “Should I not wear my helmet?”
Tony shudders dramatically, the ice clinking against the sides of his glass. As if the sound of ice reminds him to drink, he lifts the glass and swallows half of it in one go. Steve takes a cautious sip of his own. It’s not bad.
“You’ll need a suit then.”
He shifts closer to her, crawling over their tangled sheets and the cold, empty space on her side of the bed, until he can sit down behind her. He drops his chin onto her shoulder. He feels her lean back against him briefly, and then she leans forwards again and pulls the sheet tighter around her shoulders.
Steve is drunker than he ought to be. He’s sitting sideways on Bucky’s bed with his back to the wall. He is nineteen and he has Bucky’s father’s whiskey, and he has Bucky, kneeling on the floor, bandaging his fingers with only slightly unsteady hands. Bucky has always held his liquor better than Steve.
“Yeah.” Tony smiles wryly. “And now Norman Osborne’s our evil overlord, Hank’s dead, Reed’s so deep in the prison system he might never get out, and I go to AA meetings in disguise.”
“Twenty-ten.”
They stand, and they walk back home.
“Can it,” Bucky says, smacking Steve’s knee. “You’re an idiot.”
for you. We’re the worst role models.”
When Steve looks back through the elevator doors, Pepper is still standing behind her desk, her arms crossed loosely over her stomach, watching him. Steve hesitates.
“It’s... I’m no poet, Captain,” Thor says, “but...”
He claps his hands, striding forwards. Light floods into the workshop. The metal shutters roll up from the display of Iron Man suits that lines the outer edge of the great, curving room. A hologram of his latest Mark VIII schematics floats down to hang over his workbench, rotating slowly and enticingly. Tony swats that away too.
“The first time?”
He drops down into Thor’s vacated stool and snaps his fingers under Steve’s nose until Steve bats his hand away, turns and says, “Do you mind?”
“I only took my sweatshirt off!”
“Deal. It’s in March.”
“You’ve got everyone on here except them. We have to communicate with SHIELD, don’t we?” Tony pulls a face and Steve shrugs, adds, “It would be kinda dumb having to carry their communicators
Tony laughs. He clasps his hands tighter around his knees until, at last, the shaking subsides and he continues.
them.”
“Stop trying to make us into role models for your twisted ideas of civilian life, Barton,” Tony says. “It won’t work. Cap’s – well, Cap’s not a civilian, anyway. I’m too cool for you. Bruce is too
“Well, okay.” Steve combs his hair with his fingers, brushing the remaining shards out of his hair, and he looks up at the Hulk, adding – when the Hulk remains giant and green and not Dr Banner – “Now?”
“Me? I’m fine. JARVIS-”
“Okay, well, how about you tell me why not and I’ll counter it with a brilliant argument.”
“I guess,” Steve says, slowly. “It all worked out pretty well, but...”
Steve picks up his pebble. It’s a good one; he might need it.
motion?” Barton says. “I haven’t figured it out yet.”
a but. We can’t run off and – and do whatever it is you’re beating around the bush about, just because we happened to run into a robbery.”
He passes Tony his t-shirt and with a nod Tony takes it.
“The black widow is a kind of spider,” Romanoff explains. “Genus Latrodectus. The female is famous for cannibalising its sexual partners after mating with them. Highly venomous. I’ve never eaten anyone,” she adds, patting Thor on the knee. “I like apple strudel.”
“See?”  Tony says, holding his arms out. He turns his hands over, palms up. The left cufflink, connected to the circuit, glows as well now, the same bluish-white as the arc reactor and pulsing, faintly, in time with his heartbeat.
“It’s Steve.”
“It happens to the best of us, Ms Potts, ma’am.”
“The one and only,” Tony says, staring pointedly at Barton. “Captain America. Big, blonde, national treasure. Cap.”
He kicks the lid open, revealing a half dozen more communicators packed inside. Steve raises an eyebrow and pulls one out, examines it from all angles.
They stare blankly up at him.
“For a team meeting, sir. I confess the Captain didn’t confide in me the precise details.”
Clint jogs over to the communicator and picks it up, turning it over and over in his hands and then lifting it up to the light and studying it some more.
was hard to please.”
“So you
Thor sits down where Tony’s arm had been, making the couch creak; it’s already a pretty big couch, but Thor is a bigger guy. Tony magnanimously moves to the side, drawing his limbs in tighter as he looks around the room at them all.  Steve is sitting on the floor on the other side of the coffee table, with his legs crossed so he looks more like a schoolboy than a living legend; Bruce, sitting next to Steve, looks completely normal, because he’s the kind of guy who probably sits on floors for fun.
“Cap.” He snaps his fingers until Steve looks at him. “What’s your-”
Tony waits until Fury has disappeared around the corner. Then he draws in a deep breath, lets it out slowly. Flexing his fingers, he turns back to the conference room door and catches Steve’s eye through the window. Steve’s sitting up straight, staring over everyone’s heads with his expression inscrutable, as if he’d been watching Tony and Fury’s exchange from across the room and through the glass. Tony nods at him. He pushes the door open and four heads whip around to look at him while Steve looks away.
“That’s disgusting.”
He frowns up at the screens, watching himself pull the trigger from two different angles. The light bursts out so bright both images become, for a moment, entirely flooded with white. He watches the light on the second screen come rushing towards him, Butterfingers rolling backwards with the force of it. When the light hits the wall, the camera shakes and the screen goes blank.
The robot beeps at him. Its brush is black and bristly and looks, Steve thinks, like a goatee. He smirks. He kneels down to tug his boots on and carefully ties the laces, and wipes at the mud on the floor with his shirt cuff. When he straightens up again, the robot is gone. Tony is still standing at the bar, scribbling on what looks like a piece of glass, his tongue stuck out in concentration.
“That the best you can do, freak?” he sniggers, lowering his gun and raising his free hand. “I can do better.”
Tony snorts. “Over my handsome dead body.”
Steve knows his mom still has some of his dad’s clothes tucked away somewhere, but he doesn’t know where, so the man’s wearing one of Steve’s old blankets, fiddling with the edges, toying with loose threads.
Steve glances back over his shoulder as the door closes. Tony is still standing where they left him, holding the shield up to the windows to examine it all the more closely, running his palm along the shield’s edge in the bright sunlight. Steve looks away again.
The wind becomes a roar. The light becomes a circle, then a ring, a hole in the universe – expanding, expanding, and rushing forwards to meet him.
“Sure.”
With a flick of his wrist, Tony tosses the paper frisbee across the room. It glides high and steady for a few brief seconds, until it bumps into a light fitting and the segments come apart, raining down to the floor.
And that makes Steve draw to a halt, crossing his arms and frowning. “Well, so am I.”
“Come on, then,” he says. “I’m ready for it.”
On the other side of Clint, the Hulk roars and smacks the railing with the palm of his hand, quite gently for the Hulk, as if just to remind them all that he’s still there and still – presumably – hungry. The railing crumples. Clint has to grab hold of the Hulk’s hair to keep from bowling over the edge.
“So that’s...” The weight against Tony’s shoulder blades shifts and the chair rocks as Steve leans forwards for a closer look. “That’s it? What you’ve been looking for?”
The Hulk snarls, shaking his captive by the ankle, and says, “Yuck.”
Her side of the bed is cold.
He passes the bill to the bank employees, and as more people start to shuffle forwards, avoiding each other’s eyes, he takes a step back to watch. He hears Tony’s heavy, metallic footsteps behind him and turns.
“Yes, that’s the word!”
“Your airborne surveillance,” Steve says, suddenly. “That’s the... the camera I took to Chacabuco, isn’t it?”
“It looks disgusting,” Ms Potts say, staring at the drink he holds out to her as if it might bite, but with a sigh she takes it from his hands and puts it down on the coffee table. “How’d it go tonight?”
They stare at each other.
“A small one.” Clearing her throat, she lets go of his hands, pushing them back down, and she returns her attention to his tie. “Just try to remember you’re not the only one this time. There are five other lives at stake, Tony. Everything you say is going to reflect on your team from now on.”
“I’ve seen this before,” she whispers. “Years ago.”
The intercom clicks on.
“Look at it. It always looks so
Steve shrugs. “Surprise me.”
. I’m sitting in an underground bunker with a bored superspy, the Big Sleep and the not so jolly, green giant, working on some of the most advanced – and coolest – tech in the world. I’m unique. Have you tried making new friends? Getting a new hobby? Developing an addiction to internet porn and-or World of Warcraft?”
“It’s like it’s giving off twenty different kinds of radiation and nothing all at the same time.”
Romanoff shakes her head. “He wasn’t HYDRA. Too messy. If he’d kept his cool another hundred yards, he would have made it to the press conference.”
Opening his eyes a fraction, the reflection of sun off the skyscrapers is dazzling. He squeezes his eyes shut again and laughs, and the wind snatches the sound of that away too.
He flashes Steve a bright, bright grin and watches as Steve’s eyes dart away. Smirking, Tony slots the end of the wire into position, then winds the coil down his arm to the sensors at his wrist. He stands back and spreads his arms.
“He talks about you a lot,” she says as she walks away.
“What about the kids?”
He has to pause, to clear his throat, before he can continue.
“Okay.”
“Are you crazy? Of course it’s important. I’m having a hard time coming up with something
“And distract me from my questions about Reed and his family while you’re at it?”
Tony’s head whips around and he leaps to his feet, shoving his communicator back into his pocket. Steve turns too, to see Bruce standing at the top of the stairs with a bag slung over his shoulder, looking down on them with a vaguely amused expression.
“The situation’s under control,” Steve says. “Widow set the alarm off so we can clear the building quickly – just till we’re sure it’s secure. We’re heading back right now.”
Thor turns his hopeful gaze to Steve, who shrugs and spreads his hands and says, “I’d love to Thor, Jane, but... I’m still adjusting to colour TV. The kind of stuff Jane does is like science fiction to me. And anyway, wouldn’t you rather spend the day as just the two of you?”
He trips over the trashcans and falls backwards with a crash. Steve screws his eyes shut, throwing his hands over his ears until the alley falls silent. He lowers his hands and opens his eyes.
Steve hopes briefly, fervently, that the grass is too damp to burn. Then he kicks the soldier in the head. The soldier drops to his knees heavily and his arm falls to his side, fire still sputtering out of his hand. The grass smokes and hisses. In one quick movement, Steve grabs the guy by the wrist and wrenches until the shoulder dislocates and the fire dies.
Tony glances up at him, eyebrow raised.
“I’m not sure it
He stares down at himself.
Tony flips him off with both hands, wedging his cell tighter between shoulder and ear.
to make sure those two don’t do any damage,” Steve says, resting his hands on his hips. Tony grins up at him, and grins, and grins, until Steve lowers his hands and adds, “I guess I could go for some ice cream as well.”
“Right,” Fury says. “Stark.”
“JARVIS has me tuned into the police radio,” Tony says. “Seems they can’t make it through. Something about a traffic jam and a huge crowd of people come to watch superheroes take down a bunch of incompetent bank robbers? I know, I know, I’m as surprised as you are.”
“Thank you, Miss – er, Mrs?”
Leaning his head back against the wall, Steve closes his one good eye – the other too puffy and tender to open - and he grins. He listens to Bucky snort and mutter more insults, making Steve chuckle, and then Bucky touches his shoulder. Steve peels his eye open again and gazes up at him.
“You’ll want Mr Stark’s personal elevator,” he says as he pulls the door back open again. “Black one in the corner. It’ll take you straight down to the basement garage for your bike once you’re done here.”
“We should go to Iceland sometime,” Tony says suddenly, as he presses his thumb against the identification pad. The door slides open and he strides into the antechamber, spinning around on his heel and walking backwards so he can keep talking to – looking at – Steve without missing a beat.
Steve jumps, slotting the mic guiltly back into place in the console. Tony’s hand flexes against the panel, fingers brushing over buttons as if he’s petting it.
“My tower, my rules,” Tony says. “We’re doing this. Barton, best thing you’ve ever shot?”
“I told you putting your name on it that big was a bad idea.”
He steps out, and Tony follows him, rapping his knuckles on Steve’s shoulder. He takes one and a half steps for each one of Steve’s.
“Mom took me to Breezy Point a few months before she passed,” he says. “I could go for another visit.”
“And...?”
you do for fun in the good, old days?”
“I’ll keep it somewhere safe,” Tony says. He looks up from the test tube at last, eyes wide and dark. “Would
Tony is waiting for him in the mouth of an alleyway half a block away, tying and retying his shoelace. He unties it again as Steve approaches, then says, loudly, “Dave. I think I need new shoelaces.”
“So it’s – what? Really strong?”
, half on the couch and half on the arm rest.
“No,” Steve says at last. “No, don’t get rid of it. It’s not... impractical. But I want full disclosure. Make it available for all of us to use, not just you, and show me everything it does. It could be useful – if we
Sniggering, Tony emerges from the cupboards with a big bag of potato chips. He tugs it open and pours a bunch straight into his mouth before tossing the bag at Clint. Clint catches it without turning around.
Right over Tony’s head, there’s a dent in the wall where the energy first struck it, three feet across and crumpled at the edges as if it were only cheap drywall. Steve eases off his own safety gear, letting it drop to the ground as he steps forward for a closer look. He presses his own palm to the wall.
The diagram blows apart like a floating jigsaw of circuitry. He reaches out a hand.
“I died up there,” Tony says suddenly, eyes never leaving Steve’s face. “I was actually dead. Crazy, I know. In space. In a whole alien universe. My heart stopped and I was – alone. I was going to die alone, that was it, nothing to be done.”
“Reed,” Steve says. He doesn’t move.
you’re a brat. What, did you think I found it charming? Get real, Tony. You’re about as charming as a kick in the teeth.”
“Giving Van Gogh a run for his money, huh?”
“You won’t get away with this,” one of the soldiers says, but with a hint of uncertainty.
“Anything for science,” Tony says.
“He’d have done the whole tower in Iron Man colours if I hadn’t stopped him,” she admits, pushing the towel into his hands. “Now, the best shower’s on level three of the penthouse, if you want to clean up. Then we can rig you up some kind of toga with Natasha’s... effective safety pins.”
No matter how dark the room, Tony will always be recognisable, even with his head turned away from the door. His shirt is open, half-off and tangled around one arm, and the arc reactor shines out through the gap. It’s a cold kind of light, for something that keeps the heart beating. Tony could be a corpse in a light this blue. He could be cold as ice.
“Thor,” Tony points out, “calls the microwave magic. But he says he’s got a buddy in Asgard whose job is just to watch the entirety of space and time, or something? So there’s... that option.”
“I’ve appeared and disappeared multiple times right in front of you. Isn’t that proof enough?”
They thrust Tony’s head under the water and he disappears-
“Hey, I’ve gotta have fun somehow.”
. You know, vanquishing Icelandic evil, bathing in Icelandic springs.”
Steve chuckles. His gaze tracks the length of Tony’s arm, hand, fingers, until he too is staring out at the horizon. The city skyline, drenched in gold.
Tony looks up at him. “Are you? How sure? And are you sure that’s sure enough? Bastards abuse power, and I’m saying that from a takes one to know one viewpoint.”
“Hey, you never told me you quit SHIELD when Mom was pregnant,” he says.
“Really?” Tony says.
With the perimeter secured, they assemble on the floor of the conference room. The corridors are still dim, the carpet still littered with broken glass from the blown-out bulbs, the emergency lights glowing a pale, sickly green. Tony inhales deeply. Crouching down, he rubs a hand over the carpet and winces at the crackle of static electricity.
“Generally, I didn’t have enough food for that. Maybe richer folk were comfort eating behind closed doors. You’ve, uh, you’ve got some in your...” Steve waves a hand at his chin.
“Way I see it, the way we are right now, it’s too big to fail - and it
“I won’t. Time-traveller’s honour.”
it hurt.
“Captain Rogers is waiting, sir.”
There’s a pause before Yinsen slowly speaks. “No, I don’t think that will work. You have one, so you must make one. What’s done can’t be undone. We can’t go back.”
Steve just smiles at him, that affection lingering.
“Of course it’s a competition,” Tony says. “It’s always a competition. Come on, Barton, get your butt back here. Lemme see.”
The room is dark, but there’s a pale grey light inching over the horizon, creeping through the gaps between the skyscrapers. It’ll be a while yet before it becomes a real sunrise. Till then, the room is lit with a blueish glow, lighting up the bed, lighting up his shield on the bed. Lighting up the
The man’s eyes are dark and frightened. With one hand reaching out towards them, he disappears again.
Kicking his chair away, he climbs to his feet and points a finger at Fury. “I’m going to control it.”
It’s a sunny day and Steve hums to himself as he jogs up the steps of Stark Tower, nodding to Mark and waving to Ms Clark and smiling at all the business folk in the lobby who shoot confused looks at him and his oddly-shaped gym bag – all he could find to fit his shield in at short notice – as he passes them by.
and they were just looking for what makes you so special. And I don’t mean your dreamy blue eyes.”
“Where is he, JARVIS?” he says.
“You didn’t.”
“Never had the time,” Tony shouts back.
“Well, now I just want to hear you curse.”
The moment Hill walks through the doorway, her arrival announced by JARVIS, her steps falter. She peers around herself, holding her manila folders tightly to her chest. Her eyes linger dubiously on Thor’s ill-fitting shirt and Tony’s bag of chips.
“You got all your permission slips signed first, didn’t you?”
“I don’t know,” Yinsens says. “You are the one who did it.”
since New York. Who knew alien invasion would be so bad for the space tourism industry? But you, people like.”
Steve comes to a halt next to his bike. He runs his hand over the gas tank and draws in a slow breath.
Tony obeys, slumping down onto the cot. He’s back out like a light. Steve stares down at him, still feeling that helplessness. Had his Tony Stark ever been this lonely? He doesn’t know. He'd never asked.
Steve shrugs. “There are always repercussions and, no offence, it’s not usually billionaires bearing the brunt of them.”
“I can imagine,” Steve says. “Though Pepper did say this deadline was important.”
“Well?” he says.
He disappears, he disappears, he disappears.
“Okay,” Steve says, turning away. He claps his hands together. “Where are the cops? Didn’t anyone call the cops?”
“You can’t avoid him forever,” Steve says. “He’ll need to know about something like this.”
Tony huffs out a breath of laughter, knocking his knuckles against the seam of Steve’s jeans. “Don’t get me wrong, it was fucking terrifying, but I’ve had more near death experiences than you’ve had – apple pie. Freedom fries.”
“Off the shoulder number, Cap. I like it. Ooh, warm towel. Even better. Black Widow,” he adds by way of greeting as he drapes the towel around his neck. “You’re looking as prone to eating your mates as ever.”
“Yeah,” Steve says. “I’m okay.”
“No, probably not. Don’t leave me hanging, Bruce.”
“You think he has an implant?”
Once the talking – and planning – is done, Steve goes down to fetch his shield from the workshop and say goodbye to Clint, still shooting angrily at his targets, and then he heads back up to the guest room – his room now, maybe – to grab some clothes. When he gets back to the living room, Bruce has disappeared and Tony is tinkering about behind the bar, humming to himself – a tune Steve recognises but can’t yet name.
“It’s hard to tell, when it has no basis in known scientific fact.”
“I’m filming muscle movement, Steve, not porn. Go on. Wait, no.” He pulls open another drawer and, after a moment of riffling around, withdraws a square of scrap metal. “Is this roughly the right weight?”
Tony is four and standing naked at the end of the corridor, shaking, staring at another little boy standing in front of daddy’s study door. When daddy shouts, he runs away, until a hand takes hold of his and a friendly voice says, “Hey, hey, it’s okay now. Come with me, I’ll tell you a story.”
“You’re not actually going to write a paper on this, are you?” Steve says, tapping Tony’s shoulder with his knuckles, his breath gusting over Tony’s hair.
Steve picks his shield up again, checking carefully for scratches or scorch marks in the paintwork. He rubs it down with the cuff of his sweatshirt again as he crosses the room, back to Tony at his desk.
“And don’t take that tone of voice with me, young man.”
The man straightens his shirt cuffs. The whole suit looks wrong, like no clothes Steve has ever seen before, but the cufflinks are the strangest part; they’re faintly glowing.
, my boy.”
He swallows. Tony’s pulse reverberates through his fingertips, so strong and steady it feels as if Tony’s heartbeat could seep straight into Steve’s skin and stay there. It feels as if it’s already there inside of him.
“I think you could be right,” Steve says.
Steve nods. “Everything. Including access to all the weapons SHIELD has collected.”
the military, if anything I’m, what, militia, right? – I’d be more thorough, anyway.”
Tony shakes his head. “I’m not Iron Man.”
“It’ll take some paperwork,” Fury says to Romanoff and Barton, who nod along with his words. “Someone will forward it to you. I’m assigning an agent to act as liaison. Will that,” he adds, with a glance that sweeps around the table; his gaze settles on Steve, “be all?”
“What?” he adds
“Yeah, she’s a terrific model. Most people get too self-conscious if they know you’re drawing them,” Steve says. “Especially if they’re trying to relax for you. But Natasha’s always in control of herself. Comes with being a spy, I figure.”
“You two,” he says. “You need to leave town. You were already on the bad guy’s radar and this little affair really hasn’t helped. Get out while you can. Don’t tell anyone where you’re going,” he adds sharply, raising his hand. Billy’s eyes are fixed on the burnt and peeling skin in the centre of Tony's palm, his face pale. “Don’t say it out loud. Someone might hear you. Got it?”
“Thank you, ma’am,” Steve says. “We really appreciate all your hard work.”
Fury clears his throat and Tony quickly swivels back to face him, saluting him.
Tony doesn’t know if that makes him Jiminy Cricket or the Blue Fairy. Scrap that thought.
Tony hesitates, pen to paper. The tip bleeds slowly onto the envelope, the letters behind it merging back into the spreading ink.
The Hulk sits down heavily on the floor and puts his fingers in his mouth, glaring at them all. After a moment’s pause, he punches the ground with his free hand. The concrete cracks under his fist.
“You’ve missed
Out of the corner of his eye, he watches Tony run a finger through the frosting stuck to the box and lick it. He forces himself to swallow.
a big metal disc. Throwing as hard as he can is pretty darn hard. Even Tony falls silent to watch it sail through the air and hit the wall. It bounces off and clatters onto the floor, the sound echoing through the workshop.
She tugs too hard, tightening the knot and pulling the tie crooked again, and she pauses in her pep talk to curse under her breath.
SHIELD had been keeping his shelves stocked and presumably, although Steve doesn’t like to think about it too much now it’s dawned on him, also getting rid of anything that went bad while he was out of town for weeks at a time. It was one of the more surreal moments of Steve’s life – and that includes the Red Skull, and Dr Banner, and the helicarrier – when he got home from a jog, a few days after visiting Tony, to find an agent unpacking groceries onto his neglected shelves in his neglected kitchen.
Drawing to a halt in that cramped, windowless corridor, Fury looks down at Tony’s hand and then looks up at Tony, face impassive.
“He’d crush it beneath his fists,” Clint says.
“I’ve got some idea how confusing time travel is,” Steve snaps. “No thanks to you.”
Tony mumbles something, smothering a yawn with his forearm and flopping over onto his back.
“I still don’t know enough about modern weaponry yet to tell what looks right,” Steve says. “But this definitely... didn’t look right.”
But Tony stays. Tony is present.
“Please don’t lick it,” Steve says weakly. “You don’t know where it’s been.”
They lapse into a silence, and Pepper’s voice floats through it.
“Like the bifrost?”
He glances back at Steve. Steve’s looked away.
“Something bad?”
? Everything stopped working.”
Tony shrugs and looks down at Steve. “Decision time, Captain.”
Rhodey stares at him.
Jarvis would never let the mansion get like this, Steve knows. And Jarvis would never let his Master Stark get this tangled up in himself.
. Tony’s one of the most popular boy’s names in the world right now – what? Don’t give me that look, it is. Pepper showed me.”
Steve smiles. He walks over to the edge of the stone flooring, where the ground sinks down into a thickly carpeted circle. Water is dripping down his arms and down his ankles, forming a puddle on the floor.
“Uh...?”
“Could you keep ahold of this for me?” he says. “I figure if I carry it through the desert with me, it’ll attract some unwelcome attention and – well, this tower is probably the safest place I know. So if you could just – keep it somewhere safe till I’m back for it?”
Steve sniggers.
Steve watches him stride away, cape flapping behind him. Maybe it’s Asgardian culture, or maybe Thor really is just that adaptable.
“Osborne has turned you into mutants so you can fight mutants,” Steve says. “Don’t you see the problem there? What are you going to do when your buddy here –” He jerks his head back towards the man groaning behind him. “ – loses control of the powers he isn’t meant to have and kills someone? Or do you only hunt the metahumans that can’t fight back?”
He clears his throat, shakes his head and points a finger at Steve, saying, “You, stay. Hold that thought, stay there. There’s something important I need to do. I’ve been waiting for – but what the hell, I’ll do it now, while I know I can. These cufflinks could explode tomorrow or something, or-”
“I’m from the future, not the round table.”
“No.”
Stark isn’t saying anything. Steve twists to look at him, to check that he hasn’t sneaked away and left Steve without answers again, but he hasn’t moved. Stark is just staring at him. His eyes are very, very wide.
“A kind, gentle soul. He’s our man on the inside. Or he will be, once you win him over for me.”
“Terrific.” Tony claps his hands together. “Cap, toss your shield at it. Hulk, if you would...?”
“Your receptionist said you were in a funny mood.”
“His beloved Jane-” Tony begins in a sing-song voice, as if he’s telling a fairy story.
He counts it off on his fingers. Pepper stares up at him, her face still too pale, her eyes still too wide and her gaze darting back and forth over his face. But slowly her expression relaxes into a wry smile.
about all my accomplishments. But work is... more important, right now.”
Steve stares after him as Tony strides away. There seems no point in stopping him; Steve’s never known any Tony Stark to willingly keep talking after he’s pronounced a conversation so definitively
Romanoff pats him on the shoulder. “Everyone is excited. Nobody is interested in hard-hitting questions today. They’ll ask about your favourite colour, not about Harlem.”
She smiles at him wanly.
“Sorry,” Tony says. He starts to snigger again and Steve’s lips twitch. “Sorry I laughed at six-year-old you.”
“Thank you,” Steve says, climbing down from the car to take it from him. “That’s a brave thing you just did.”
Natasha’s sarcastic smile shifts into something smaller and warmer and, Steve thinks, genuinely amused as she glances sideways to meet Steve’s eyes. But Tony’s still talking, over the sound of clinking glasses and bottles.
“He’s a lunatic,” Steve breathes.
She nods and Tony ends the call, slipping his cell away. He peers around until he spots Sofia in the dwindling crowd and waves her over. She looks calm. He figures having your boss return from assumed death and build a flying robot suit really does make a few minor explosions seem like a walk in the park.
He looks around the room. It’s huge – of course it’s huge, because he and Pepper share an appreciation for wide open spaces, warehouses, cathedrals. It had seemed a lot smaller five minutes ago, when it was full of people. But you adapt.
Thor grins and then, lifting his head and taking in the team’s expressions, grins even wider. “My friends, you must understand, Asgard is a cooler realm than yours. We have no deserts. Had I not seen it with my own eyes, I would have thought no living thing could dwell in such – such sand and heat. Truly, they’re the plants of warriors.”
“Is he a homosexual? I mean, a – a gay?”
like much. Why the focus on Thor, of us all?”
He clenches his jaw. He looks around them, over his shoulder. Nobody is looking their way.
“Can we sync these timestamps up again? Thanks.”
Steve pauses with his finger on the elevator button. He presses it before he turns around.
Tony hates not knowing.
“Not a lot,” Steve admits.
“Hey Dave, I think I got my shoelace tied,” he says.
house from up here. You left the stove on. Everything’s on fire. Still clear?”
It’s already growing dark when Tony makes a quick trip to the tower with a grocery list of equipment. He grabs some pizza on the way back. Sitting on the floor with his laptop on his knees, he writes a program to scan the hotel’s security footage, interior and exterior, for any physical matches of their man since the day the press conference was announced. Under Barton’s direction, a SHIELD clean-up crew pick tiny fragments of debris out of the carpet with tweezers. A SHIELD doctor calls them partway through the night, to report that they’ve put John Doe through every scan and test they have got and found nothing except a slightly elevated temperature.
“Shit. You saw nothing. Tell no one of this.”
The steel door is still unlocked. Steve runs.
Ms Potts sniffs, then drains her glass.
“I – I know you are,” Steve hazards. He puts on his best Pepper Potts voice, her particular brand of sternness that never quite hides the river of affection running beneath it, and he says, “Now let go and
“Where do you wanna go?”
Apparently that’s what Steve was waiting for, because he relaxes minutely before he tenses up again, leaping to his feet and disappearing over the top of the table in one smooth movement. Tony gets up slower. Glass is still tinkling and crunching all around them. Romanoff and Barton look relatively unfazed as they follow Steve around to the front of the stage, Barton already murmuring into his earpiece and Romanoff pausing on the sidelines to help Sofia to her feet, but Bruce rubs at his throat, wincing. Steve must have tugged him down too.
The discharge of energy hits him. His body slams back down onto the roof and – over the ringing of his ears and the gasping of his lungs – he hears Obadiah shout. He hears Obadiah fall. He pictures the trajectory of that great body in motion, down into the innards of the factory’s heart, and Tony knows a second blast is coming.
Down in the lobby, he finds Pepper standing by the reception desk, deep in the middle of two conversations at once, one on her cell and one with Sofia. She looks harried and tired and her hair is slipping out of what was once an impeccably neat bun. Easing his way through the lingering crowd of SHIELD agents and hotel security, curious guests and staff attempting to clear the lobby, Tony calls her name. Her head whips around in his direction and she passes her cell to Sofia, who picks up the thread of the phone conversation without missing a beat. She grabs his arm and draws him aside to the edge of the room.
With a sigh, Tony thrusts the box at him. “Take it. Enjoy it. Happy to help.”
“I need eyes in the sides of my head as well, apparently,” Tony says, once everything has shut off.
you to do it.”
It takes days for Steve’s body to start feeling like his own again. The alien sensation creeps from his limbs in inches, until he is able to sit up without falling back down again seconds later and then, at last, able to stand and to walk. It’s Steve’s body, all right; fresh from fighting in the War. Steve’s mind, on the other hand, is fresh from a different war all together. He tries not to think about what’s happening in his absence, only about how to get back to it.
Rummaging through his treasures, Steve feels Tony shift closer for a better view. In among the collection of feathers, and pebbles, and the yo-yo with the broken string, and the nickel with a hole right through the middle, Steve fishes out a small horseshoe magnet.
“Did I miss all the fun?”
“What are you saying?”
He gets up, fumbling in his pockets for a pen, but Steve’s had enough.
“Look, I’m just a guy,” he says.
Steve laughs shortly. He’d forgotten about that.
“Yes, um.” Glancing around, Bruce draws Steve to one side, lowers his voice and leans in closer. “I was in Chile last week. I’ve actually been following a lead on a group trying to recreate... well,
Tony pushes the window open and sticks his head out, looking down into the street.
Steve feels Bucky’s fingers on his shoulder, and he hears Bucky whisper, “Hey, doesn’t he look like…?”
. There was always gonna be the ice, right? You came to me, so I was always gonna come to you.”
write my next press release. You speak, people cry and give you money. It’ll be great.”
“Okay,” she breathes.
As Bruce responds, Steve can hear Tony’s voice pick up again, softly. He tries to tune it out, but he’s always had sensitive hearing and the serum only made it even better, and, “You’re right,” Tony’s saying. “I’m sorry, you’re right. As per usual. I haven’t been – Let’s get out of town next week. Come on, turn that frown upside down. Just you and me, okay? We’ll both turn our cells off.”
“Indestructible,” he says, rapping a knuckle against the glass.
Barton shakes his head slowly, face angled away from the crowd that’s inching closer. “Can’t reach her. SHIELD communications are down, at least on this end.”
Bruce clears his throat.
There’s a pause, Tony staring out into the cave.
my point. I’m a futurist, and I have more PR experience in my pinkie finger than the rest of you put together. I can see how this is gonna go. Opinion sours, the shine wears off, and pretty soon all our little Thors and Thorettas will start asking the difficult questions. Things like, oh, I don’t know...”
There’s something packed into his lungs and in his eyes, so that when he tries to shout his mouth won’t open and when he tries to blink his eyelids drag, heavy and unwilling; there is a sliver of light between his lashes, too bright to stand – everything loud and shaking – air raid? Steve thinks, and then
It takes Tony a moment to react. He drags his arm slowly down his face and peers blearily out at Steve from under it. He blinks.
“It’s a long time. It’s a really long time.”
“Shh,” Steve breathes, shaking his head minutely and staring straight ahead at Thor. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Natasha turn to look at them.
“Tony-”
Clint grins at him and, balling up the sandwich wrapper, he tosses it with precision at the upturned faceplate. It lands smack dab in the centre and gets stuck in one of Iron Man’s eyes.
“Bruce,” Steve says, his voice coming from the edge of the room but moving closer. “How are those tests going?”
There’s an incredible groaning creak, as if stone were sliding against stone – which, Steve realises as a portion of the rock face opens up before them, it is. He follows Tony through the doorway, only to walk into Tony’s suddenly rigid back when Tony stops in front of him. Steve hears him suck in a sharp breath.
“You’re a busy man.”
“Got it, Cap.”
He has to lift the other Tony up when they reach the stairs, a sweeping expanse of mahogany that had never been practical in a house with a child in it. The other wraps his arms around Tony’s neck automatically, clinging on tightly and sniffing and mumbling, at last, “That one creaks,” right before Tony almost puts his foot down on the wrong step.
Steve sighs. While Tony stands and waits, his arms spread wide, Steve paces slowly around him. He scans the floor and then drifts over to the desk, looks over the mess on it and picks out Tony’s narrowest screwdriver.
Steve asks
“Communications won’t go down again,” Tony says.
There’s a moment of perfect silence, as he lets his breath out again and his shield cuts through the air. It’s swiftly followed by an almighty racket: the shield hits the communicator and both go flying; the Hulk roaring; communicator rattling across the floor; shield ricocheting off the wall, off the ceiling, off the floor, until it slides to a halt at Steve’s feet.
The back of Tony’s chair creaks when Steve rests his elbow on it. Ignoring the new weight that presses between his shoulder blades, Tony pulls up the data and points a finger at it.
He trails off. There’s a pause, Steve still shaking, and then he feels Tony’s hand on his forearm, the touch gone as quick as it came.
“How do you know this?” Natasha asks.
He disappears, leaving Obie’s fingers curling in the air.
“Hey, not everything-”
,” Tony snaps, yanking his arm away. “I’m not a superhero. I’m not some covert vigilante. I tried it once and I sucked at it. It was a total fucking disaster. When I was a superhero, people died. You understand? Because of me, people died.”
here?”
Tony stares at him again.
“I know,” Steve says again, his fingers warm on Tony’s wrist. “But stay.”
“It’s okay, Steve.” Tony jams a key into the wall of rock and twists it. “They already think they’ve won.”
“No,” Tony says, from behind the camera. “He wants to extract it from you. He’s – we think he’s the one orchestrating the latest rise in meta-hate. Relations were never great after what happened with the Avengers, but now? Nobody’s going to kick up a fuss if someone comes and takes a super-powered kid away, because they figure that kid was probably born evil anyway. And the kids – they’re not strong enough to fight back.”
He sighs, turning away from Tony, rubbing the back of his neck as he looks around the space they’ve cleared in Tony’s workshop. His feet shift back and forth as if he wants to walk away.
Thor beams. Hill thrusts a pen at him and Thor signs his agreement with a rune on the dotted line, still chuckling.
“Homicidal cabin fever. Message received.”
“Okay.”
cheating.”
Steve smiles, spinning the hologram in a slow circle. Through the other side of it, Tony grins at him, blue light shifting and dancing all across his face. He lifts a hand and pulls a couple sections away from Steve and towards himself, separating parts with practiced flicks of his fingers and making them spin.
Tony grins. He grins around at them all, at Bruce’s slightly bashful expression now he’s stopped coughing and at Thor’s blatant relief that Romanoff isn’t a cannibal.
They stare at each other. Tony lifts his chin up, head back, as if he’s an alley cat ready for a scrap, and Steve – well, Steve always got into a lot of fights. He can feel his hackles rise. He looks away.
He falls away again.
She waves her glass at the robot by the fire. They sit and watch as it slowly drags a fresh log from the pile and, with a small chainsaw that unfolds from its body like a penknife, sets about cutting it up into manageable pieces.
Tony whistles low through his teeth. “X-ray him. Scan that man.”
For the first time since his parents died, he thinks of the story another Tony had told him almost thirty years ago. He’d forgotten about it. The other Tony had had a light in his chest then too.
The suit descends.
“You realise you were the first human being to actually
“Well?” he says.
“The experiment was a resounding success,” Tony says.
“It was just one guy,” Tony  says, patting the back of her hand. “He sneaked in, shouted a bit, then Hill roundhouse kicked him in the face – I think Thor’s in love – and security came down on him like a tonne of bricks. He barely made it out of the elevator.”
“Please don’t do that.”
Steve smiles at the mirror, in lieu of a face to look at; or to direct his next question to, as he hefts his bundle of clothes and waves it uncertainly for the cameras. “Where should I dump these wet clothes?”
“- well,
“But why?” Steve says. “You said yourself you weren’t a teamplayer. Nobody would have been offended if you took a step back from this after New York.”
Bruce, examining the singed light fittings, throws his hands over his ears and grimaces. Across the room, Barton is already talking loudly and rapidly into his earpiece. He snaps his fingers at Tony, points at his ear and mouths, “Hill.”
, Tony thinks.
“See you later, alligator.”
“But once they’d stopped shouting and, you know, questioning their sobriety, they realised they’d got a bomb-building, genius, freak of honest to god nature on their hands. It’s like terrorist Christmas out there. I’m pretty sure I saw some dancing. Dancing was – definitely a feature.”
“Agents, you’re in support of this?”
“Sure,” he says. “It was good. I figure not many folks outside the police force get to say they helped stop a bank robbery.”
“Nay, Captain,” he says. “Would that I could be of more help, but your weapon is unfamiliar to me. In Asgard, we craft weaponry of great beauty, and with great care. This – this is crude. And
I mean it, I could pull some strings. I have contacts. There was a guy, there was an angry rhino.”
, and Steve turns around just in time to see Bruce Banner flop down onto the grass by the ice cream stand.
Steve stares at him and lets out a slow breath. “You could
He sits down. He drums his fingers on the edge of the desk.
Shaking his head, Clint makes a scornful sound around his potato chips. Natasha keeps looking at Steve, unblinking, her head to one side.
“Agent Barton’s a highly trained professional,” he says, more for his own benefit than anything else, but Tony lowers his pen and frowns at the door as well.
“It is an honour,” Thor says cheerfully, because nobody, not even Fury, could kill him and make it look like an accident.
They share a look.
“Everything’s fine,” he says again, the words catching in his throat.
“Well, how else’m I meant to know where you all are?” Tony spreads his arms and shrugs lopsidedly, looking truly baffled, as if secretly tracking your buddies really were the most logical step when you’re Tony Stark. “Two super spies, and Bruce is busy making hide-and-go-seek an Olympic sport or something, and then there’s you and Thor just bumbling around like America’s Next Top Tourists.”
Sniggering, Tony turns back to Steve. He’s frowning, a hand over his mouth. He shakes his head when Tony catches his eye.
. But I’m not so sure doing this here is a good idea. We don’t know what this thing is or what it does-”
Steve stares down at him, turning to face him properly and blinking in surprise, and then he lets out a laugh. “Well, of course we are. I know that.”
“Can you get back here too, Thor?” Steve says. “You know the most about alien tech.”
“Define ‘this.’”
Straightening up, Rhodey casts an eye around the cluttered workshop, the wires, the prototypes, the reams of data printouts, and he adds, “But first, you owe me a drink.”
Tony holds the stare a little longer, raising an eyebrow. Steve holds his ground and stares back, until Tony shrugs. He shakes out his arms and lowers them to his sides.
“And that makes it okay?”
He leans back in the dimmed light, rubbing his eyes. He can feel at his back the familiar thrum of the arc reactor through a foot and a half of metal and glass. Call it a vanity project. Call it one last bow for Howard Stark and his beautiful, impractical giant before Tony had the blueprints destroyed. The full-sized arc reactor sits underground, in the centre of the foundations, hidden from view with Tony’s private labs and workshops wrapped in a protective circle around it.
Tony is drunk. Thirty three and very drunk, when he finds himself on the floor, bleeding from the chest – no, bleeding from the edges of the thing that’s in his chest.
She touches his knee. Tony looks up from the bottom of his whiskey glass and covers her hand with his own. “I’m
“If you’re sure...”
Stark Tower rises up above Steve like a sore thumb – or like, Steve can admit to himself in the privacy of his own brain, a much ruder digit. And isn’t that just Tony Stark all over? To throw up a giant middle finger to the gods and the city skyline and make the most ecologically friendly building in the city while you’re at it? In the two months since Steve last saw the tower, it’s been cleaned up and rebuilt to its former glory and, by the looks of things, had another couple floors added to the top.
“So, uh, Chacabuco,” he says.
a fight, by the look of it. Twice.”
Steve’s expecting to find the penthouse deserted at this hour, but he steps out of the elevator into dim, warm lights. The TV is on with the volume so low Natasha must be lip reading, while sitting on the couch and quietly cleaning her nails with the point of a knife. Next to her, Clint snores softly, his head tipped back and his mouth hanging open, his fingers knitted together over his stomach.
There are no obvious tourists, he realises as they walk – as they amble, in no hurry, no siree – back to the manor. Maybe no tourists at all. Whatever this city is now, it’s not a place people want to go to for fun. He looks around, at all the faces passing by. They’re here because they need to be.
“Oh, heck,” Steve sighs.
round here somewhere.”
He wipes uselessly at himself, metal fingers scraping against his metal chest, until Steve passes him a paper napkin. He watches Tony dab at himself, having to hold the napkin so delicately to keep it from tearing in the Iron Man’s too-strong grip. He watches Tony scrunch the napkin up once he’s done with it; sure enough, his fingers go straight through it. Tony tuts and tosses the balled-up napkin at the trash can and misses.
“What?” Tony says again, blankly.
“What?” Barton mouths back.
Tony cackles - there’s no other word for it – with laughter, shaking his head and holding onto the edge of the bar to steady himself and looking so surprised by his own reaction that Steve feels his own lips twitch in response.
“Take it, then,” he says. “And wear your damn earpiece, for god’s sake. I know when you don’t. I know everything. Look, it’s easy when you get used to it, just pretend you’re talking to an imaginary friend.”
can’t do that.”
“The same council as in... ‘hey, let’s fire a nuke at New York’, that council we all know and love?”
fun, though, right?” he says.
Sitting up straighter, rubbing a crick out of his neck, Steve watches Tony grab his socks from the nightstand and give them an experimental sniff before he pulls them on.
Steve curls his fingers around Tony’s bicep.
Steve manages to sit up. It hurts, but there’s a sinking feeling in his guts and he needs to look Stark in the eyes and ask: “What year is it?”
“Yes, Mr Stark?” Fury says.
“Dave,” Tony calls. “Dave! Keep up.”
He twists around as best he can, nudging Steve’s chest with his shoulders, until he can see Steve’s face out of the corner of his eye. Steve kisses his cheekbone.
Tony smirks across at him. Then, lowering his gaze, he quickly finishes buttoning his shirt and he smoothes a palm down the shirtfront. Steve can see the corners of his mouth still curling up.
Tony laughs at that, the amusement bringing a spark of life back into his face. “Then just see if you can find a screwdriver in this hellhole and get the front panel off the monitor console. There’s something I need in there.”
Tony opens his mouth, pauses, then closes it again, pulling some kind of silent, elaborate, petulant face that Steve takes to mean ‘Do go on, Captain Rogers.’
Steve draws to a halt by the bar. He watches Tony pour generous helpings into two glasses. Here’s where Tony offered Loki a drink; there’s the window Loki threw him through; that’s the patch of floor Hulk beat Loki into. It’s like a particularly grotesque sight-seeing tour.
He wakes slowly, drifting out of his dream inch by inch until only fragments remain: shadows and movement and voices, and the sensation of falling, all merging seamlessly into the cotton against his cheek and the soft sound of breathing.
Snickering, then coughing when it irritates his sore throat, Steve digs through his messy array of coloured pencils – some sharp, some blunt, no two from the same place – and pulls out a medium blue. He begins to gently shade in the tiger’s belly. He feels the mattress shift as Tony peers over his shoulder.
“Forget it,” Steve says at last. “You don’t have to explain yourself to me. It’s fine. You need to talk to Fury about all this anyway, maybe you should take it up with him instead.”
“Big day today,” he says. “Surprise me.”
Tony shakes his head, then rolls his eyes. “What, I’m not allowed to enquire after the health of people now?”
“Yeah, right.”
“Well, sure.”
Tony pulls his hand away at last. He raps his knuckles against the arc reactor through his shirt, and then spreads his hand over it. He looks down at the back of his hand, the faint blue light between his fingers.
“What happened to your cufflinks?” Steve asks. At the man’s blank look, he adds, “They glowed. It was neat.”
“Careful,” Steve says. “If you keep on calling me by my name, you won’t be able to manipulate me with it for much longer.”
Steve pauses. He crosses and uncrosses his arms.
Moving forwards again, Steve picks up the scattered pieces as he goes, wires and sensors, clips and fastenings. He doesn’t try to untangle them, just lays them down on the desk next to Tony.
“Happening?”
“It works,” Tony breathes. “We’re awesome.”
Stark – Tony – is never far away, throughout it all. In the absence of clocks or calendars or what seems like regular mealtimes, Steve measures the passing of hours in Tony’s routine. When he’s sitting at the huge bank of surveillance monitors embedded in the wall, Steve works out until his limbs are aching. When he’s hunched over his workstation with his back to Steve, Steve slowly explores the cave. Steve’s Tony Stark had never worked in a cave. He liked heights and bright white spaces. Steve’s Tony Stark didn’t like caves.
He steps out onto the floor. When he glances back over his shoulder, Tony’s face is obscured by the camera. The little red light is flashing where his eyes would be, so Steve focuses on that when he asks his next question. “Is Osborne trying to recreate the super soldier serum? He must know nobody’s ever managed it.”
“You’ll fit right in.”
“Was it a race?” he says. “Forgive me, friends, I have not read such a document before.”
Thor laughs. “A generous offer. My father
Tony rolls his eyes, but then, rolling his shoulders back and lowering his arms to his sides, he closes his eyes. He lets out a breath. Flexing his fingers, he thinks of the beach at Breezy Point. The sand in his shoes, the sun in his eyes. He wonders if it will feel new or familiar, or if it will work, or if it will hurt –
Tony shrugs. “I’m working on it.”
Bruce shakes his head again in disbelief, with a rueful smile. He scribbles a few notes onto his clipboard and slides his glasses back off nose, slipping them back into his shirt pocket to nestle among pens and pocket protector.
“Hold that up and look handsome,” Tony says. “I’ll take a picture.”
“Good to know.”
“Ah, ah, let me finish, come on. Geez. Aren’t you meant to be the polite one? You want one, you can have one. Have two. I’ll build you two.”
“And email, too.”
Yinsen twists a wire around a wire around a wire. His fingers don’t falter.
“Yeah, can’t look too good, I’ll show Barton up,” Tony says, tugging at his tie while Barton flips him off over Steve’s shoulder. “Hey, I have an idea – hold this.”
“Oficina Chacabuco,” Bruce agrees. “It seems the most likely fit. It was used as a detention camp, so there are military facilities. Lots of abandoned mines in the area, too.”
“Don’t look at
“You – want me to take it with me?”
“You were short.”
“Hey,” he says, reaching out a hand. “Hey, it’s okay now. Come with me, I’ll tell you a story.”
Tony pauses, gaping up at him, his empty glass still suspended in the air a few inches from his face, like a mechanical game that’s used up its pennies.
drawing, anyway?”
The kitchen is vast, of course. Tiled floor; marble countertops; a whole, separate square of work surface in the middle of the floor, covered in drafting paper and screwdrivers and what looks like the remains of breakfast, which still leaves enough room around it for a small game of baseball. There are, Steve notices and then carefully chooses to ignore, three ovens.
accepted my fate. Gave Pep the company, took care of Rhodey, ready to fistbump my maker, the full shebang. But even then I guess I believed
Tony tugs at his collar and lifts his cell back up again.
/command: run
Steve looks down at him for a little while, his forehead creased and his lip twitching in some internal debate, but then he nods and holds out a hand. After a moment, Tony takes it, letting Steve heave him up onto his feet.
Steve snorts, earning himself a suspicious glance from a woman passing by. Despite the hands-free device sitting alien in his ear – which Tony had insisted is used by ‘corporate douchebags the world over’ and won’t make him stand out in the crowd – he lifts the communicator up to his ear as well. He stuffs his free hand into his pocket and begins to stroll, keeping an eye on the stars.
He looks up and down the alley, then around the corner out into the busy street, but the man has gone.
,” the voice is saying, and the other  light screen flickers into life, filled with the view of a table and some half-shut blinds. It tilts, shifts, revealing a young woman squinting down at them suspiciously.
“Mr. O. Osborne, Norman Osborne,” he amends at Steve’s sharp look. “He’s had the government in his pocket for years now. He’s the one running this city. He’s the one doing what he wants to get what he wants, and what he wants is superpowers. All of them.”
Chest heaving, Steve grabs hold of his injured hand and hisses. The pain is sharp and bright, but it won’t stay. He’ll wake up in the morning and it’ll be gone again.
“Pause.”
“I offered my team rooms here,” Tony says. “But they turned me down. We were trying to keep things professional.”
He lands in water, the heavy metal suit immediately dragging him down, but for a second he sees blue skies and grassy banks, a man standing in the shadows of the trees and a little girl with red hair running full pelt down towards the shoreline, while the water closes over his head and -
Steve eases his boot off at last and leaves the pair standing against the wall again, with a grimace. His wet jeans rub against his legs as he stands.
“Doctor,” she says, looking up. She smiles and climbs to her feet, jumping over Thor’s long legs. “Dr Foster. But call me Jane, anyway. You’re Steve, right? Should that be Captain Rogers? Sorry, I spend half my life living in a van, chasing storms, and the other half with a Viking, so I’m not great at formalities.”
Steve pads out into the corridor. Up here the place feels almost like a normal home, albeit one with an impossibly thick carpet; but there are pictures on the walls. Not the strange modern art he’s caught glimpses of downstairs, but photographs of what can only be Tony when he was young, standing next to some kind of robotic arm, and of a woman with his dark eyes, and of Ms Potts and Tony standing somewhere tropical, him with shades and her with an open smile.
“Oh.” Steve pauses. “I didn’t mean to – It’s not HYDRA, it’s just something I’ve been figuring out.”
“You too, zero-zero-four.”
Steve glances sideways at him, his eyebrows raised, but then he nods and smiles grimly and says, “Good. Widow?”
“Tony,” he says. “Wasn’t this robot cleaning your shoes a couple months ago?”
really awake?” Tony says, sitting up.
I had no idea it was going to be this long, or eat my life and heart and soul to such an extent, or get such a wonderful reception. I couldn't have asked for a better audience for my first proper go writing in this fandom, so thank you all very much.
“Right.” She pecks him on the cheek, smoothing her hand down his shirt, and adds, “I should get back to work too.”
“Pardon?”
Clint has the decency to at least pretend to look contrite. “The big guy and me just thwarted a bank robbery, Cap,” he says. “No peace for the wickedly cool.”
“I don’t understand why... Why has it taken you so long to try and work this out?”
“I love the smell of a consistent trend in the morning,” Tony says. He turns to Steve and raises an eyebrow. “Come on, I’m waiting.”
“Watch it,” Steve says. “If we can get out, someone else can get in. Keep everyone away from the doors. If one of us hasn’t checked back in in five, scout it out, Tony, see if you can get folks out that way.”
“Jesus, they – I’m sorry, Steve,” Tony is saying, shaking his head, and Steve is leaning forwards and grabbing Tony by the shoulder, a white noise in his head where thoughts used to be. “No, I mean, nothing happened. They aren't anywhere. Nothing happened to the kids,  because Reed and Sue never
“And you can’t fight guys like that at all, which is
“Our tower.”  Finishing off his toast in a few quick bites, Tony lifts the lid off a tub of
“What are
“I don’t normally throw it in confined spaces-” he starts to say, but they all groan, Tony flapping his hands, Clint shouting, “Come on!”
“Wow, ‘don’t call us, we’ll call you’ from an entire covert ops organisation?” Tony says. “I can’t tell if that’s a high point or a low point in my life, no, really, I genuinely can’t.”
“The baby,” she sobs. “Howard, I think the baby’s coming.”
“This could be dangerous,” Steve mutters.
“You can’t compare-”
“Now, I mean. In the present.”
The light through the window is getting brighter.
the party.”
He takes Steve’s wrists and turns his hand over, dropping the magnet into his upturned palm. Steve’s fingers curl around it automatically, then slowly uncurl. Steve sucks in a breath.
“Back,” he says. “Play. Pause. And again.”
“That’s it? Oh?”
He keeps his eyes closed. He raps his knuckles blindly against the arc reactor. “What if I don’t make this? Go back to that past, knocking-on-heaven’s-door me empty handed?”
Tony’s voice is still not his own, and nor are his mouth, lips, tongue, forming words on their own over the white noise in his brain, the fireworks in his eyes.
Tony smiles up at him, swift and jokey, all teeth. It drops off his face as he spreads his fingers across the edge of the bar and stares, intently, down at his knuckles. The degree to which Steve feels out of his depth is almost comforting; nobody, from what Fury told him, can hold a straight conversation with Tony Stark. In this moment, at least, Steve is no different from anyone else in the twenty-first century.
“Iceland,” Tony says, turning his attention back to the ceiling. “You ever been? It’s actually not that icy. Someone should report them. False advertising of an entire island, very illegal. But, uh – good air there. It’s good the lungs, right? So Pep’s literally gone for some breathing space.”
Tony scoffs. “But you know the super secret military handshake. You’re in the clubhouse. You’re invited to the slumber parties.”
There’s a crash from somewhere behind Tony. He’s thirty-nine and he’s spent enough of his life around loud noises that he carefully lowers his soldering iron and pulls away from the gauntlet prototype he and Dummy are working on, before he turns around to see.
As if in answer, somehow, the monitors ripple and one image spreads, rolling out from the top left again, until the same view is showing on every screen. The message is clear, obvious.
; and of Tony staring fixedly up at his bank of monitors, but never saying a word – for Tony to decide things are safe and they can relax again.
” Steve holds a hand up. “Stop talking. I know you’re a – a very rich man. I was joking. You looked like a coin-operated game that’d run out of coins.”
She purses her lips, frowning. “He didn’t tell you-? Of course he didn’t. After that night with the towels, Tony took your – well,
“The serum.” Steve sighs and Tony nods grimly. “But who? Why?”
“Fine, fine.”
There’s the sound of a scuffle. Through the crack between doorframe and door, Tony sees daddy grab an older boy by the arm. The boy has no clothes on, and he shouts and struggles, hitting at daddy wildly with his fists.
“Jesus,” Tony says, eyes snapping open. “I can feel myself aging here. Bruce, what’s your favourite colour?”
“You need,” he says calmly, when she lifts her head and meets his gaze, “to speak to Fury.”
“Wow,” Steve breathes.
“He’s something alright. Have you got all my towels there? Are they – What? What
“Jane Foster’s going to be Queen of Asgard. Unless those two break up, which – you’ve seen them now, you know that’s not going to happen this millennia. Dr Jane Foster, Queen of Asgard. It’s got a ring to it.”
“That’s it? Wow, even for T that’s pretty vague.” The background whisperer interrupts again – Jess? Steve thinks – and Peter mutters back. “Okay, thanks for the mysterious info, T’s mysterious friend. Over and out.”
“Little captain,” he growls.
“Dunno how people live like this,” he mutters, before he sighs and lowers his pen and says, “But what?”
“Yeah, Steve, I have ‘the Google’ in my phone. And I have the boredom in my head.”
The man smirks and shakes his head. “Don’t cheat.”
He carefully releases his hold on the electrodes and flexes his wrists. They stay in place. He looks up at Steve with a grin.
Tony raises an eyebrow, but he learned long ago to trust his future selves, so he thrusts the soldering iron at the other Tony and heads over to the car.
“Barton.”
Steve drops his hands. He breathes in slowly. Impromptu speech made, the silence hangs between them.
He hesitates, frowning in deep thought.
Tony shakes his head, rubbing a hand across his face. The ground beneath his feet no longer feels solid. The lights of the fireworks are still flashing in his eyes.
“Huh,” Tony says.
“Would you look at that?” Tony flicks the lights off and on a few times. “Must’ve been Pepper’s idea. She thinks it’s more homely not having to constantly rely on the whims of a sarcastic robot butler.”
“I, uh, well, I thawed you,” Stark says. He laughs sharply, running a hand through his hair. “It was exciting. I figured we were going to have a dramatic introduction and I’d get to say ‘welcome to the world of tomorrow’ or something, but apparently they’re delivering New Scientist to the icecaps now.”
Running his tongue along his teeth, Bruce pulls a face, but seems satisfied. He makes to stand, reaching out with his gunmetal for a nearby trashcan, before he thinks better of it. He sits. He clears his throat.
“Good. Great. Tada,” he adds, pinching the base of his paper airplane tight and holding it up between finger and thumb.
grab Thor. Okay, maybe not Thor. Not sure I wanna be lost and naked in Asgard, but...”
“The time is 8:17 am, sir,” JARVIS is saying.
“Squeeze.”
done what you’re meant to do?”
“The desert’s practically inhospitable. I think... if I were gonna set up a secret terrorist base in the driest place on the planet, I’d sacrifice some of that secrecy for easier access, right? It’s still surrounded by miles of empty desert. How many people are gonna drive through that in a week? I’m thinking not a lot.”
“Yeah,” Bucky says. “We’ve met. I’ve met you, anyway.”
okay?”
Steve reaches out his hand again. “Can I?”
“My future. Come on, it’s not rocket science. Do I have to cross your palm with silver before you’ll let me in or what?”
Tony snorts with laughter. “You’re telling me.” He slides off of the desk, dislodging Steve’s hand from its place in his lap, and he yanks open a drawer. The tape measure goes into it, then a small video camera comes out. Tony waves a hand in the direction of the empty floor space. “Go stand over there and mime throwing a shield.”
“You made it sound,” Rhodey says, his voice heavy but unsurprised, “like an emergency.”
“Holy moly!” Steve exclaims, as the bright blue lines lift up off the panel and expand into the air.
“Did you stop to buy coffee for spies on your way here?”
“News?” Tony mumbles.
Natasha nods once. She crosses her arms. “Get back in touch with Banner, get his location. You can fly to him and bring him back with you.”
“Not long now,” Tony says, vaguely. He moves fully into the room and peers out the window.
“Go away,” Steve shouts through his tears. “I’ve got the flu.”
“Move,” Tony says. “Uncle Tony can tell you a story and work at the same time. Oh, and pass me that towel. This patch is mostly synthetic, but it can get messy.”
“Crystal clear.”
“This is impossible,” Bruce mutters.
He stands, in time to hear the steel door close. The locks click-click-click into place and then the cave is silent again. Steve sighs, suddenly exhausted by the journey back to his cot. He’s locked in a cave by a man who looks just like the man he was ready to kill just a couple weeks ago, but Steve doesn’t feel like he's a prisoner. So he sleeps.
“No, I’ve never been,” Steve says. His mouth has gone dry; he has to swallow heavily, trying not to think of the argument that he overhead, trying not to ask Tony why he didn’t go away with her. He controls the impulse. “Is she – gone long?”
“Yes. We were talking about you.”
punch Hitler. How many times...?”
“I’ll bet,” Steve wheezes.
“Okay.” Tony takes a half-step towards Steve and then rocks back, nodding and saying again, “Okay. Alright.”
He scoops the robot up off the floor and grabs a screwdriver from somewhere among the bar paraphernalia. As Steve turns away, stepping into the elevator, he can hear Tony still speaking: “Look, I’ll take these devil claws off and we’ll find you something else to do. It’ll be fine.”
Tony leans back in his seat, legs crossed so casually, propping his elbows up on the work surface behind him and for a moment he just looks at Steve.  Then,
They stand in silence, but not uncomfortably. The elevator swoops downwards with a silken whisper and Tony can’t suppress the itch of pride that it barely feels like movement, as if the basement were the one rushing politely up to meet them. He thinks of his dream, that sensation of falling, for just one second and then he pushes it aside. Press conference, he tells himself, publicist, Rhodey, legal. He can feel that headache rising up again, like the beat of a heart between skull and skin.
“No kidding,” he says. “This is...”
“Don’t,” Tony whispers. “Don’t. Shit. Sorry, I should've - When we’re upstairs, we’re not safe. Hell, even downstairs we're probably not completely safe. The walls could quite literally have ears. Keep your head down and don’t draw attention to yourself. Understand?”
like how people dance today. That’s, um. Very different. People are different now. I think – that’s the biggest change. Cars still have wheels, sure, and nobody lives on the moon, but people...”
“Rhodey. Rhodes. Jim Beam,” Tony says with a reproachful sigh. He leans back in his chair, resting his feet on the edge of his desk. “Is that a hint of envy I detect?”
Nodding, Steve lets him take the red pencil. He watches while Tony lightly shades in the front – Steve assumes – of the car, his hand moving impossibly fast compared to Steve’s own careful, meticulous colouring.  The blanket he’s wearing catches on his wires every time he moves.
When Tony doesn’t move to take it, he pushes it at him harder, adding, “It’s an
He glances sideways at Steve, who has lifted a hand up to shield his eyes, rubbing a knuckle against his eyebrow and squinting in the glare of the low hanging sun. He’s smiling to himself. The light is bright on his face.
Stepping forwards, Steve cautiously lifts his hands and draws them apart and he can’t suppress his burst of laughter as the lights respond to his motions, the diagram expanding and then – as he quickly claps his hands together again – just as quickly retracting.
As she speaks, she pulls a box of tissues from a desk drawer and holds them out to Steve. “Take the box, Captain. They’re company property. You need them more than I do, right now.”
“Sir, Ms Potts ask when you will be up.”
hard.”
“Listen to me,” Tony hisses, grabbing Steve by the elbow and tugging him – Steve jerks his arm out of Tony’s hold, but follows him anyway – deeper into the recesses of the jet.
It’s a matter of perspective.
“I sketch,” Steve suggests.
“Of course you have.”
Slinging an arm around Steve’s shoulders, he exclaims, “You trying to give me a heart attack?”
“Better be good,” Clint grouses, but he hops down off the worktop and lands on a stool. For all his complaining, he sits with his back straight and his eyes alert, focussed on the gun before him.
Drawing his hands back to himself, he pulls his gloves on again and straightens up, climbs quickly to his feet, portal gun held tight in his grip.
Steve chuckles, letting Tony slip his fingers back out of Steve’s grip and take hold of his hand again, gently wiggling each finger and prodding one of the bruises. It already hurts less than it did, the swelling going down, the bruising rising up.
“What, no personal recommendation for me?” says Clint.
“How long have you been sitting here?” he says.
Bruce smiles pleasantly up at her, pulling a pen from his shirt pocket when she hands him his copy of the agreement. He looks like a private school chemistry teacher. Tony watches Hill take in Bruce’s pocket protector with a baffled expression, and he grins to himself and grabs a document.
“That’ll be Black Widow,” he says.
state secrets.”
Over their heads, the fire alarm cuts out at last. The silence falls so suddenly it leaves the room stunned for a moment, until someone cheers. Steve smiles up at the ceiling.
“Nearing completion, sir. Only a few major projects are still in progress, all scheduled to be finished within the first week of October.”
He snaps his fingers and points at Steve, until Steve sits up straighter in his seat and clears his throat and says, slowly, “I guess the colours are a little... vivid.”
Steve drops down next to him and pulls on Tony’s wrist. Tony surrenders easily, turning his hand palm upwards. Steve winces.
He drifts into the centre of the room, picking up a few loose sheets of paper from the floor and moving an empty coffee mug off the bare table and onto a coaster. He glances down at the papers in his hand, which have on them Tony’s scruffy signature and a smear of what looks like ketchup. They look confidential -
“I suggested plastic surgery,” Tony stage whispers to Steve.
“I’ll see you later,” he says.
“Hulk is last resort. This space is too confined. You two see if you can figure out a little of what’s going on here. Could be something hidden in the room triggered this, uh.” He hesitates, frowns. “This electromagnetic pulse?”
“So that was only, what – a year or two ago for you, huh?”
“Yeah,” Tony says, looking down at the blood on the shirt in his hands. “Can’t wait.”
Steve smiles up at the ceiling, tilting his head back like most people do when faced with a disembodied voice – as if JARVIS were some kind of sarcastic god – and he says, “I think I agree with JARVIS on this one.”
“It doesn’t seem any different.”
“Jump forwards two frames?” he says.
Drumming his fingers on the arm of his chair, he hears Steve groan and mutter and shift around so his sheets rustle.
Barton, squeezing past with Romanoff, whispers sotto voce, “If the answers behind the Avengers are 90% SHIELD, what’s the other 10%?”
“You don’t
“Sun, sea and sand,” he says. “Okay. That’s a start.”
“Okay,” Tony says, flexing his fingers against Steve’s grip. “Yes, we have Reed. We have the whole happy Fantastic Four family. Somewhere,” he adds, softly. He doesn’t look at Steve as he picks up the screwdriver and pushes at Steve’s fingers. “Move your hand up. Half an inch should do it.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, although he isn’t, really. He ducks his head, still laughing, and he sees Tony crack a smile out of the corner of his eye. When Steve straightens up again, Tony’s looked away.
She smirks around her mouthful of Pepper’s muesli. Tony flashes a toothy grin at her in return. He strolls around the table, patting Steve on the shoulder and ducking down to kiss Pepper on the cheek as he passes them by. He feels her smile under his lips. Wrapping an arm around her shoulders, he grabs the slice of toast from its plate and shoves it into his mouth as he moves away.
Steve tenses up automatically, until pain shoots up his arm and he remembers.
“Not yet,” he says.
“Life used to be so simple, when I was just on the run from the military because my mutated alter-ego destroyed half of Harlem.”
Steve has to think about it. He closes his eyes and when he opens them again, Tony is still looking across at him, fingers curled motionless in his shirt, still only half buttoned. It leaves framed a glimpse of his stomach, rising and falling with every slow breath Steve watches him take.
“Guess we’re in for some fun times,” Tony says, patting him on the arm.
Tony leaps up out of his chair, sending it rolling across the floor until it bounces off the wall behind him. When Fury keeps on walking, Tony follows him to the door and through it, grabbing him by the arm as the door swings shut behind them.
He settles back in the chair and watches the monitors. A few experimental button pushes yield the same results as before: for a few seconds the channels change, and Steve catches brief glimpses of streets he’s walked down and buildings he knows; then every screen flicks back, column by column, to their views of the park.
- need to put our science hats on and figure this out. So get your butt back here already.”
“It’s some kind of bizarre-o survival reflex,” Tony says as he twists the last coil of wire together. He thinks of Yinsen’s steady hands. “Fight or flight, et cetera. I figure my body chose flight without consulting the rest of me.”
He leads Steve past the gates and past the walls of the ground and into a small alley instead. His movements are stiff, restrained, and about halfway down the alley he stops moving altogether, pushing his hands into his pockets and tilting his head back to stare up at the sky.
“Tony, what about Jar—“ Steve begins but is swiftly cut off by Tony’s hand over his mouth.
Tony pauses, looping the tape measure around Steve’s bicep. “Flex,” he says.
“Guys, I’ve got to head back to the tower,” Tony says. Or Iron Man says it, really, the faceplate down, the voice robotic. “Have another ice cream on me. Hell, go to Le Bernadin, they know me there, they’ll even let Mr Flip Flops in if you tell them I sent you. Cap, try the red snapper, it’s great.”
“Mom didn’t want to go! She didn’t want to but she went anyway, because you - Why didn’t you
Tony sighs, dropping his head onto his hands. He pinches the bridge of his nose.
“Did you know she was going to die?” he says at last.
“Nah, wasn’t my favourite decade either. Skip it. Hey, I think I see you. Wave.”
“But it’s not gonna last.
“Pointy little man,” he growls, lumbering to his feet.
Natasha, with her feet up on the coffee table, groans. Ms Potts found her a spare pair of slippers, but she’s still got knives strapped to both ankles. She says, “Don’t tell Stark that. He’ll take it as an invitation.”
“He snuck up on me from behind. I’m Hawkeye, not Hawk
“It’s been seventy years since I saw her, twenty since she passed. Whichever way, it’s long enough to...”
“Busted.”
“I’m thinking cufflinks next,” Tony says.
– Iron Man? Why aren’t you doing something?”
“For goodness sake, Tony.”
“It’s cracked,” he shouts back to them. “I think that puts you in the lead, Cap.”
“That filthy rich bastard with his name stamped on all the landmarks, was how she put it,” Tony stage whispers to Steve.
“Do nothing by halves, my old man used to say.”
Tony’s expression is unreadable, the cave thrown into shadow in the absence of the electrical glow, but there’s a faint, silvery light coming from – somewhere. From the cave walls themselves, Steve realises, craning to stare up at the shining roof.
you try to eat it?”
“Well damn, Stark, what took you so long?”
He tosses what looks like a thick, brown envelope into the microwave, smacks the door shut and jabs a few buttons on the side. As the machine begins to hum and the popcorn packet begins to spin, Steve drags a stool up next to Thor and sits down to watch. He has a microwave in his apartment; he’d read the manual thoroughly and pressed all the buttons, and marvelled at how soon after his time it was invented, and then never really touched the darn thing again.
“Yeah, well, maybe now’s the time to start.”
Shaking his head, Tony turns on his heel and walks away from Steve, but Steve can barely process the wash of disappointment before Tony reaches the wall and turns around again. He leans back against it and slides down to sit on the ground, with his legs sprawled out in front of him and the portal gun placed gently on the floor next to him.
“Hey, where you up to now? In the seven decade catch-up, I mean. You must be in the eighties by now, right?”
“Sloppy. You think they left it on purpose? If I were a terrorist organisation – and I’ve been accused, in the past. That was an accusation. Come on, guys, I said, I’m working
“This is a kitchen,” she says. “You said conference room.”
“Flight stabilising? Terrific.”
“Captain!” he exclaims. He grabs Steve by the hand and by the shoulder and gives him a full body shake. “Well met! You too are a patron of this noble tradition?”
There’s a pause, punctuated by Tony’s scribbling. Resting his chin on his hand, Steve watches Clint fire another arrow at the Hulk. It explodes when he catches it, and the Hulk roars indignantly, beating his chest while Clint laughs.
“Sorry to disappoint.”
He waves a hand vaguely, but Natasha nods in understanding, polishing her nails on her shirt.
“It’s stronger than the Hulk,” he says.
“I spent the first twenty-five years of my life with not much to do but read,” Steve says. “So, neither.”
“O-kay,” he says. “Touching as this whole scene has been – a man, reunited with ice cream sandwich–” Bruce, sweatshirt half on, waves his ice cream sandwich in the air in acknowledgement. “–But now’s time for the audience participation. Who’s got clothes? Come on, pants, shoes, step right up. You all know who I am, come by my tower later and we’ll get them right back to you. You can sell the story to TMZ after.”
“Sir.”
“We could blow this place sky high.”
He looks around, taking in the exits and the shape of the room. Back home this would have been the equipment storage room, he realises, but here the room is empty. Still, there is the familiar door to the familiar elevator.
Tony watches her go, then look around as the doors open again and Romanoff slips through. She murmurs something to Barton too low to make out before she makes a beeline for Tony.
“Don’t you like the letter A? I love the letter A.”
Tony taps him on the arm. Steve jumps and swallows heavily, wrenching his gaze away from the sight of Thor and his girl. He meets Tony’s eyes and has to swallow again.
Lifting her head and lowering her knees abruptly, Pepper turns around to face him. Her feet hit the carpet with a muted thump. She lays one hand on his knee.
Behind them, there’s a strange sucking noise – like someone trying to drink the very last dregs of their milkshake through a straw – and a few people shout in surprise as the air seems to
“-a little more-”
Steve’s face still feels half-frozen, but he summons up a smile of his own as he plucks the box of tissues from her hands. He drips his way into Tony’s private elevator once more, prods the wall – and then, when nothing happens, wipes his hands dry with a couple of tissues and tries again.
“Hold still,” Pepper says.
The second he catches his eye, Tony’s face breaks into a grin. An honest to goodness grin that reaches all the way up to his crinkling eyes, without any sarcasm or evasion or insincerity. It’s just about the warmest, brightest thing that Steve has ever seen.
he have all the fun?”
Tony says it automatically, absent-mindedly, with no real bite. Ignoring the colourful face of the shield, he flips it over and gazes down at the back, where the joins are visible. Steve watches him run his finger along the fastening of one of the straps and give it a tug, testing the give.
“Everything alright?” Steve asks as he approaches.
“The other-” Steve lifts his head from his arm, looking across at Tony, down at the gun – the
“Yeah, I know you do.”
When he looks up again, Tony is watching him, still sitting on the coffee table, holding himself as quiet and still now as if he could be Natasha. There is an orange glow over his shoulder, and Steve shifts his gaze to watch the robot poking uselessly at the embers of the fire. A futile endeavour.
“Drink?” Tony says. “Or, mouthwash, in your case?”
“It was nice talking to you, all the same.”
, I think. Shit scared and – and a whole load of other things, but glad, cause I knew it was gonna work. My one good deed. Nobody could call Tony Stark flying a bomb into space and dying alone selfish, right?”
“Well – she’s fine. She’s gotten a cough, is all, because of the damp. But she’s fine. Doctor Harris says it’s nothing.”
Catching hold of Steve’s wrist, he tugs him deeper into the shadows at the base of the globe.
“In this weather?”
“Well, all right then,” Steve mutters. He picks up the mic and says, after a moment’s self-conscious pause, “Hello?”
Steve’s bag strap is cutting into his shoulder. Steve’s head is beginning to ache. He leans his forehead against the smooth, cold wall of the elevator and closes his eyes.
“I’m forty-two.”
“Steve’s fine, ma’am – Jane.” He shakes her hand. “So, uh, you’re a doctor? That’s-”
He breathes in and out.
“I’ve read your file, Stark. I know your suit’s not even made of iron.”
She skids to a halt at the water’s edge, shielding her eyes from the glare of the sun and staring out for a long while. She props her hands on her hips and looks around. Tony, in the trees, backs further out of sight.
,” Tony begins, before cutting himself off with a wave of his hand, shaking his head. “Wait, no, that didn’t come out right. I’m not saying I wanna make you all dance for me just because I’m bored. I’m not that much of an asshole.”
In the morning, he finds his clean clothes stacked neatly outside the door, with a piece of grid paper folded on top. It reads, in messy handwriting, ‘one boy scout uniform, freshly laundered.’
He says, “I have to go now.”
“Nineteen eighteen. And I never actually punched Hitler.”
“Sir, I must warn you-” JARVIS begins to say, even as the door slides open.
“Save, upload. Hit me.”
“Could be,” Steve says. “HYDRA has cleared out of Chacabuco, but I found-”
“Bigger,” he says, eventually.
There’s a pause.
Tony comes easily, asleep on his feet, but when Steve tries to detach him and lower him down onto the cot, he twists a hand into Steve’s shirt and holds on tight.
“I do,” Steve says. “I mean, I know that.”
“Call me Mark, Captain.”
He watches, looking back and forth between each screen. The light pours out like syrup.
“Objection!” Tony says, knocking his fist on the table like a gavel. “I object.”
“Well, you know me,” Steve says. He forces a smile. “I’ve always wanted to see the world.”
After he stares at Steve for a little while, and Steve stares back at him, Tony adds, slowly, “I don’t
“No,” Steve says. “Don’t contact Fury yet, JARVIS. We need to talk to the team first.”
He stares up at the screen. There’s something there, in the stars, and it’s moving.
“My friends!” he exclaims. “Well met!”
Steve stares down at the desert. It stretches uninterrupted for miles and miles. “And if anyone did get too curious, attract HYDRA’s attention, that’s a whole load of room to hide the bodies in.”
Steve nods. “I can’t reach Thor either.”
“At ease, soldier. You’re too cute. Go play with your friends. Actually, you might want to go change into something else first, if you value your shirt. Playdates with Tony usually end in explosions.”
He lets his breath out and leans back against the wall. He doesn’t look up, waiting for Tony to speak, and then when Tony doesn’t speak he adds, softer, “Why do you want this team so bad if you’re going to... to throw yourself at portals? That’s not how a team works.”
“Hey Cap,” he says around another yawn, closing his eyes again. “We were wondering when you’d show up.”
“The-”
“And then what else?”
Tony huffs out a breath of laughter. He pats Steve on the chest – sock still on his hand, masking the feel of his fingers but not the warmth of them – and then he takes a step back, turning away from Steve.
Tony moves back in again, grabbing hold of Steve’s face with clumsy, graceless hands and he pulls Steve down to him. Steve catches on in the same moment and his fingers close once again on the back of Tony’s neck, pulling him
“Nothing. Sorry, Pep, can I – I’m losing sensation in my fingers here.” He gently pries her hand away from its grip around his wrist. “No aliens, I promise. Unless they’ve developed highly advanced camouflage. And I guess Thor’s humanoid, so...”
“No so different from your everyday life, then.”
Steve, gazing out the window at that giant metal A, feels Tony move closer, stand just behind him.
Steve swallows.  His hand drops to his side. At length, “And you couldn’t have told me this before shoving a screwdriver into your arm?”
“I – wanted to see-” Tony begins, eyes wide, but Steve cuts him off.
“Excuse me?”
Tony snaps his fingers, pausing in the doorway. “Come by sometime. No flying cars or monorails, nobody wants flying cars and monorails, I mean, nobody except you, sorry, Cap, but – In fact, come by in a couple weeks. I’ve been working on something, it’s a surprise. Okay? Okay.”
“That was fun. I particularly enjoyed the part where the chief of police asked for your autograph. Right? Yes?”
kids.”
“Get lost,” Tony says without looking up.
“Then it was dumb of me to listen to you.”
“It’s scratched,” he says. “But so’s the paint. I call it a draw.”
Bruce spreads his map over the coffee table, weighing the edges down with empty glasses and, when nothing else is readily to hand, his borrowed flip-flops, casting a sheepish look and a murmured, “I figure everything we do with these now will only add to their value, right?” at Steve.
“You were lying on top of the covers,” Steve points out. “I think I would’ve notice right away if you... had no clothes on.”
this, a cape? Fashion tips from Thor?” Tony leans on the back of the couch, peering at him and tugging at the corner of one of the towels covering his shoulders. “These are attached. Good god, Pepper, what have you done?”
“Oh, sure, laugh a minute, right?” Tony says.
“You’re right,” he says. “Why
“You took your time,” she says.
Tony nods.
“You’re a real charmer,” Tony says, taking his cell back. He holds it out in front of him so they’re both in frame, throws up a peace symbol and takes a photo. Glancing down at it before he sends it to Rhodey, he adds, “And you smile like a twelve-year-old at his first school dance. I can see why the ladies love you.”
Steve turns to face the door and watches till Tony appears in the doorframe, wrapped in tinfoil and looking sheepish. He tugs at his neckline and the whole costume rattles.
“You should try it sometime.”
Barton nods and strides away to take his post, while Romanoff crosses her arms and quietly waits. Tony jerks his thumb at the door to their impromptu dressing room.
“Yes,” he hears her murmur.
“The usual.” Tony groans, extravagantly. Picking Ms Potts’ drink up again, he shoves a load of magazines and papers off the table and onto the floor with his toes, balanced on one foot with a drink held steady in each hand. It’s an impressive display of dexterity, if nothing else.
time. There’s a difference there Steve can’t quite explain.
“That was a fluke,” Romanoff says.
“Oh,” Ms Potts murmurs. “Tony’s home.”
“Does everyone wear wire in the future,” Steve asks, “or is it just you?”
“JARVIS, did you get all those readings okay?”
“Gotcha,” Tony mutters, drawing the screw out and dropping it into a Petri dish. He folds back the flap of loosened skin, revealing the circuitry beneath. It’s covered in a layer of silvery liquid, which Tony carefully wipes away with the towel. Then he glances up at Steve and grins. “Oh, don’t be such a baby. It only stings a little.”
solved it. It stays with us whenever we go. We’re a genius. See you in a few weeks, Ton-”
“I’ve seen oceans drier than you, Captain. Mr Stark isn’t in right now, I’m afraid, but-”
,” Steve says, and he’s halfway through the sentence when he realises he’s about to cry. It’s absurd. He clenches his jaw tightly, twists his head away from Tony to glare out over the city and stamp on this sudden surge of grief. It’s
“You give up?”
get drunk. Believe me, I tried.”
Ignoring the headache, wondering about his dad’s arc reactor blueprints and how Tony would make it that small - because he knows he’d never trust anyone else to put something like that in his body – Tony barely feels it when Obie’s hand lands on his shoulder and squeezes affectionately.
He looks at Steve.
“Yeah, you really showed it who’s boss,” Tony says. “You big baby.”
For a moment, nobody speaks. Tony glances up at Steve, whose expression is grim. Then Bruce clears his throat, slipping his glasses off his nose. He cleans the lenses on the edge of his shirt and says, slowly, “Thor, what
“Thank you. And - astrophysics. I’m actually in town for a conference, to present my findings on the bifrost. The bits of it that SHIELD haven’t classed as state secrets, anyway.”
“Good thing, too. You’d have shown them all up.”
He pats the space on the other side and says, again, quietly, “Steve.”
“Well, she’s coming to meet with us in an hour,” Steve says, “which gives us a little time to prepare... Bruce has done all he can and we’re still none the wiser. I think it’s time we shared our intel with SHIELD.”
Tony had forgotten. There’s a lot in here that Tony had forgotten.
“I dropped my ice cream,” says Bruce.
“Hey,” Tony says as Steve steps back and the elevator doors slide shut. “Wanna come see my super secret basement labs? I promised you a tour someday.”
“Can I just ask-?” Bruce begins, but Tony hushes him loudly, holding up a finger. Bruce sighs and sits back.
“So maybe it’s a really clever man, too,” he says. “With a lot of computer components. Back home, it’s – he’s a man.”
“It’s all buildings and trees in there.” Tony waves his hand at Steve’s sketchpad without looking up from his paper.  Lowering his hand, he begins to write and he adds, slowly, “Except for Widow.”
“The trackers?”
He claps Tony on the shoulder and moves away from him to take charge of evacuating the room.  Bruce and Thor follow after him, Thor pausing on his way to collect his cape from the debris and drape it around his shoulders. Selecting Pepper’s number, Tony half listens to Steve begin to talk, his words a low rumble just on the edge of hearing.
, sir. Hold it.”
the weight of it, he can feel the creaking joints. The city is shrinking, the portal is growing, the sky is rushing down to meet him.
Steve’s pocket starts to beep and vibrate a couple weeks later, in the middle of the grocery store.
“So do you get JARVIS a cake?” Barton says.
“I believe you,” Steve says. He sits back down once Ms Potts has disappeared from view. Tony remains sitting on the coffee table, cross-legged and shadowed, staring across at him. It’s gotten dark, Steve realises; the fire has died down.
Rhodey steps closer to take a look at the designs, upside down at first, but as his expression shifts and grows serious he pulls the papers out from under Tony’s spread hands. He turns them right way up, looks closer.
“I’ve got a communicator app installed in my suit,” he says, “but I have to check how high altitudes affect the sound quality. Need someone to stand on the ground and listen to me talk.”
“You don’t say? I’d never have guessed.”
“Great,” Tony says. “Good. I probably needed a new microwave anyway.”
His gaze turns distant for a moment, as though he’s already drawing up schematics and working out equations behind his eyes; but then he blinks and his attention snaps back to Steve, and then back to the gun.
would be.”
Tony throws his straightened wires down onto the pile on the desk. Waving a hand, he leads Steve through the workshop and to the garage, to the car. He feels jittery. He thinks, too often, of Steve’s closed suitcase on the kitchen table, of Howard’s slightly open study door. When he glances back over his shoulder, with his hand on the car door handle, Steve has stopped walking. He’s standing and smiling at the car as if it’s the punchline to his favourite joke.
Tony tosses him a grin over his shoulder, all teeth, as he pushes the door open and disappears inside. “Me and my phallic symbol are extremely happy together. JARVIS, lights, 60%. There’s, uh – there’s probably a light switch somewhere, if you wanna do things the old fashioned way.”
He pulls the door shut.
Fury nods slowly. He drums his fingers on his leather-clad arm and then nods again, sharper, and he says, “Okay. Stark, I see your point. Romanoff, Barton, you’re reassigned.”
At the sound of his name, Clint’s eyes snap open and he sits up sharply.
Steve dreams of the cave, and of Sharon’s face looking down on him, her mouth soundlessly moving while Steve loses himself in the labyrinth, searching for the steel door that keeps moving, that is just just just out of reach—
“Thor,” Natasha says, looking away from Steve again. “How long does it take you to fly here?”
“We were just in the right place at the right time-”
“I think this is one of the stranger days I’ve had,” Bruce says.
“We attached it to one of the targets first,” Tony says, “but that got old fast. I’ve had more convincing battle simulations in my bed, and I mean while sleeping, not – Anyway, what’s the point in having a teammate who turns into the mean green smashing machine if you can’t shoot arrows at him sometimes, right?”
“Hey, I can see my house from here.”
“Look, a couple years ago I had some, uh – firsthand experience with a device that subdued the whole time-travelling thing. I mean, probably. It wasn’t exactly a scientific trial but considering I was literally in the middle of a slow, painful death and I stuck with the present – and normally,” he adds, pausing in his string of notes to look at up at Steve, “evading painful deaths is the only thing this party trick is good for, so I think we can reasonably assume some correlation there.”
Tony shrugs. He turns the paper around in his lap so Steve can get a better look. “I’ve designed a couple.”
Leaning back on his elbows, he watches her untangle herself from the sheets and move around the room, slipping on her bathrobe, gathering up her work cell and tablet. She pauses in front of the window to brush her hair in her reflection, her eyes finding his eyes in the glass.
“Honey, I’m home. Honeys,” he amends, looking up to take in the sight of Steve, Natasha and Ms Potts staring over the top of the couch at him. He doesn’t look surprised to see Natasha, but he raises an eyebrow at Steve. “What’s this? You’re having a toga party with Sleeping Beauty and you didn’t invite me?”
“Bigger viewing deck,” Tony mutters to himself. “We need 360 degrees. Can I borrow a bit of paper?” the last to Steve.
Steve nods rigidly, eyes forward. His back is very straight.
“What?” Tony says. “You look like you just saw a ghost kick a puppy. Am I wearing a white sheet and abusing animals here?”
“It’s a – it’s a vehicle. It’s transport. It’s
“What do you—” Steve pauses, looking down at the scrap metal still in his hands. He drops it abruptly. “The blood sample.”
Steve holds out a hand and, with a grin, the doorman takes it, the open door slipping in his grip and beginning to swing shut until he catches it with the heel of his shoe.
He turns and knuckles away towards Clint and Tony. Steve lets out a breath and then draws in another, slowly, and he takes a look around. The basement seems to be a cross between an engineering workshop and a workout room; there are archery targets secured to the wall at the far end, sparring mats on the floor. Tony seems incongruous on the edge of it, sitting at a whole array of desks, with his welding goggles on, pushed up to his forehead so his hair sticks up over the top. He waves Steve over.
“And the Council?”
Steve blinks, sips his intolerable coffee, and says, “Okay then?”
Steve is seven, kicking a pebble down the alley and pretending it’s a soccer ball and he can run as fast as anyone, when a naked man falls into the trashcans. It’s definitely not a dream this time.
“I did
“So if I went to the North Pole, or Africa, or the
this thing was a portal and, and you went running at it?
Steve shakes his head. Frowning, Tony looks up. He lets go of his cufflink, holds his hands still.
Tony grins. “I guess not.”
, her report on him had said.
“Come home, baby,” Tony says. “The children miss you.”
They pause, listening, but things in the corridor seem to have quietened down. Steve clears his throat.
Tony says it flippantly, like most things he says and does, but somehow the fact that he is still there and still listening, when he could have walked away or – heck, it’s
is a secret weapon.”
“Go pretend it’s round and shiny and speaks to your soul.”
that team, not just… dropping in on special occasions.”
As if to prove his point, Clint fires his arrow at the Hulk. It’s just a basic arrowhead and it bounces off the Hulk as uselessly as if it were made of cotton candy, but the Hulk stares down at it in surprise. He takes his fingers out of his mouth.
“Like magic.”
Tony pulls his head back out of the window and tugs it shut. He twists the blinds cord back and forth between his fingers, winds it around his knuckles.
Tony looks around to see Steve, deep in conversation with Romanoff and the harried-looking hotel manager. His gaze is skimming back and forth over the heads of the slowly dissipating crowd while he talks and when he catches Tony’s eye, he lifts his chin in question. Tony nods at him and holds up a finger, then turns back to Pepper. She is still smiling wryly.
“You might as well keep hold of yours, right? Prototype StarkTech is better than no StarkTech at all.”
to – because I was looking for
Clint rolls his eyes and waves Hulk out the door.
That seems to do the trick; Tony blinks and shakes his head, lowering his hand. “Do I – what? No, I don’t need a cent. I’m a billionaire. You did know that, didn’t you? Stark Industries, remember? I mean, I know we were too busy fighting aliens for the small talk, but I kinda figured the tower with my name on it gave the game away? No? The robotic suit? The impeccably styled goatee?”
“Where are you now?”
“Oh, right, that – yes. No, it doesn’t matter. Floors get cleaned, right? I’m sure I pay people to do that. I was thinking of getting a new one anyway.” He pauses, eyeing Steve, then flaps his hands. “Christ, don’t give me that look. Take your boots off if it’ll make you feel better. One of the bots can clean them. They can fight for it. It’ll make their day-”
“You want sincere?” Tony spits, a full six feet away now, though Steve never saw him move. “Okay, sure. Dad’s favourite – hell, Dad’s
Tony grins wider. “Tap me. Twice – first to select, second to call.”
The robot flips itself over onto its wheels again, the plates fluttering shut as it spins in a circle, reorienting itself.
coffee?”
“Love me, love my goatee. How’m I sounding?”
“You are way out of my league,” he says.
“What-” he begins, but before he can get another word out Tony’s plucked it from his hands again and dropped it onto the floor upside down.
He says, “What an interesting day we are having, Mr Stark.”
“Hey, you got your suit back!” Steve exclaims, then thinks and frowns. “Or... you only just got it?”
“Good news,” he says.
“Desk work,” Barton snorts.
- And then I closed my eyes. Died. Woke up. Bam. What do I – This is
Tony makes a beeline for the couch the second he’s through the door. He flops down onto it and swings his feet up to rest on the coffee table. Leans his head back, closes his eyes. He can feel a headache building, scratching at the back of his brain. He listens to the noises that move around him: the departing chopper; five new pairs of footsteps filling up his tower; the sound of someone, gently, closing the balcony door behind them. Steve, Tony figures, or maybe Bruce.
“Okay,” Tony croaks. “That’s a start.”
Tony snaps his mouth shut. “Right. Great. I knew that.”
“Franklin. Valeria.” Steve stares at Tony, but Tony is staring back, just as perplexed. “Reed and Sue’s kids, Tony. What about them?”
Steve cracks an eye open, turning his head against the headboard. Tony rolled fully onto his side at some point in the night, his back to Steve now, his legs curled towards his chest and an arm draped over his face.
Steve is staring at him inscrutably.
He slots the communicator into a space in the console, presses the symbols for Thor and Bruce and flicks his fingers out at the free seats around the island. Beams of light shoot up out of the edges towards the ceiling, spreading into rectangles that hang in the air. They’re fuzzy with static at first. But as Steve watches, the one on the left suddenly snaps into colour, as bright and sharp as any twenty-first century TV screen, and Bruce blinks out at them.
“We’re in the kitchen.”
“Stay,” Tony whispers as he crawls off the couch, his legs still numb, and measures the distance down the stairs and to the workshop door.
“Yeah,” Steve says. “But I kinda liked it.”
“Oh, no, no. There’s no need for that. Mr Stark isn’t here, but Ms Potts is in. You’re authorised to come and go as you please, regardless.”
Bruce squints at him.
“You and your ragtag crew of vigilantes, banding together to save the world?”
Steve peers over the edge of the couch. Mechanical things are moving in the darkness through the window, in fluid flashes of arc reactor blue or gold and red when the suit catches the light. It’s like abstract art. He resolves to watch it in daylight one day.
Bruce clears his throat, raising a hand.
Steve could help him. Instead, he crosses his arms over his chest and grinds out, “I was thinking that the life of two untrained teenagers is more important than my own.”
“Who else knows about it?”
He comes up to Steve while Steve is busy trying to make tolerable coffee in the microwave, and he says, “Things could get hairy, Captain. I figure I shouldn’t leave you unarmed.”
He moves out of sight again.
There’s no panel to touch this time, so he just walks forwards and hopes for the best.
Barton folds his arms and lifts up his chin. “I don’t, but you’ve been going clockwise consistently. So it’s your turn to answer a dumb question, if you’re doing this right.”
idiot. What the hell? Does it even work?”
“I’ll try,” Steve says.
Outside, in the sunlight, there’s a helicopter waiting to carry all six of them home.
“If there’s one thing Captain America needs, it’s a shield. Maybe one day we can go back to the ice and find it, but at the time it didn’t seem as important as getting you the hell out of there. I can’t recreate the vibranium-iron alloy – well,” Tony pauses, coming around the desk and back into Steve’s sight. He’s brandishing a tailor’s tape measure. “Given enough time, maybe I could. But we don’t have that kind of time, so it’s going to have be a whole new shield. Which arm’s your throwing arm?”
“I’m not a
He made the agent take it all to the nearest homeless shelter. If Steve’s really going to be here, in Brookyln, in the twenty-first century, then he’s going to buy his own darn groceries.
“Of course, sir.”
Thor, declaration made, beams at the pair of them. Steve glances at Tony, who is staring at Thor with a look of abject horror; then at Jane, smiling with her hand on Thor’s arm, just smiling. Thor’s own smile dims.
“You know I can’t control it when I’m not wearing those suits,” he says.
Steve swings his feet. He bounces his heels against the leg of his chair.
“Obie, I’m either too drunk or not drunk enough for this.”
Steve scoots closer, craning up and ducking down till he’s eye-level with every part of the hologram he passes. Even up close, he has no idea what it’s a diagram of, but it’s one heck of a show. He can admire the shapes and the lines and the way it’s
“What about military and police?” Steve asks, and then when Romanoff raises an eyebrow at him, he adds, “I don’t want us stepping on anyone’s toes.”
“Two months is like two years for technology. Get with the program, Cap.” Tony nudges the robot with his toes again, although there’s a hint of pride in his voice. “Useless hunk of junk. The great thing about being me is that when my shoes are dirty, I can just buy more shoes. You know how hard it is to program a bot to tell the difference between shoes and, I don’t know, hands, bottle, Mjolnir?”
Hand still up and tongue still out, Tony lifts his eyes to stare at Steve. He licks the last of the ice cream up pointedly and says, “It’s my highly advanced armour and I’ll lick it if I want to.”
“Dr Banner owns the tea, but there is a 93% probability that he has no objections to sharing. Agents Barton and Romanoff,” JARVIS adds, “are already at SHIELD’s New York headquarters.”
He watches. Up in the sky, Tony falls silent and Iron Man flies in another giant loop before Tony responds. Steve suddenly, abruptly, can’t remember what year it was that Howard died.
would happen, and it did. That was great, I’m not knocking that. Happiest I’ve ever been to have Black Widow stab me in the neck.”
“That exit leads right out onto the street, doesn’t it?”
The group he points to just stare at each other, and then at him, in shock, until Steve motions to his chest and adds, “You’ve got the logo on your... Look, we need to get this tidied up, and I figure you’ve got more authority than me to handle this.”
“I don’t think anyone on the planet could have seen this coming. I think,” she adds, in a voice so soft he has to lean in closer to catch her words, “we’re still in shock. Everything has changed.”
There are boos from the crowd, and Tony looks askance at him, murmuring, “Good luck with
Tony isn’t the kind of guy who stands and watches until a motorcycle has disappeared into the distance. Instead, he turns and strolls to his workshop door, high-fiving the panel to open it. The sound of the motorcycle fades into the sound of all distant traffic. The door opens.
Bruce hesitates, tapping his finger against the town while he thinks. “I saw strange lights. The rest, just hearsay, but there’s enough of it
Steve knows that voice.
“Well, I would love to stay and find out if you die
Steve sighs, coming away from the window at last. Tony holds out the bottle and Steve, with another, softer sigh, holds out his glass. “Yes, Tony, I’ve tried anchovies. But-”
she keep those? In her hair? I need to work something into your suits. Give me your gloves one day, I’ll see what I can do with that–”
“Sir,” JARVIS says. “Captain Rogers requests the team’s presence in the kitchen.”
, now. What do civilians do all day?”
“Is anyone hurt?”
There’s a pause. Tony shifts back and forth on his feet, looking around at the mess left in the portal’s wake. His gaze finally settles on the robot with the camera, which had somehow managed to stay upright in the chaos, and Tony stands and stares at it.
In the morning, Tony greets him with a jacket and a pair of shoes. They’re both a perfect fit, which he waves away with a vague “I have a man on the outside” when Steve questions it. Neither of them feel like talking after last night’s conversations, so Steve lets it slide and pulls the clothes on.
He says, “JARVIS, you seeing this too?”
“I know. Just thinking out loud.”
Steve gives Bruce the nod –
She studies his face. “Not Stark.”
“Perambulate your buttocks to my place of residence. Bring the shield. It’ll be fun, I promise.”
Steve holds still. The towel is damp and distracting, icy water dripping down his jaw and down his neck. There was something important, but – he forgets.
Tony looks around the table. Hill is staring at her hands, and Barton is staring at Fury, but Black Widow gazes back at him, unflinchingly.
have me learn more of Midgard, now the Tesseract is returned to us and the bifrost restored to its former glory. He wishes for me to be a diplomat between our worlds.”
can.”
“Okay,” Tony echoes, holding up a hand. “Sure. So I’ll keep being a genius, Cap’ll keep modelling my laundry closet, and you’ll keep sneaking into my home to give me nightmares.” He counts them off on his fingers. “Is that the plan?”
“Thanks, Jeeves.”
Tony glances up at himself. He’s smirking down at the wire he’s soldering.
“Well, that’s the scariest thing I’ve ever seen,” Tony says, dropping his hand and backing away behind the bar.
“I call it a repulsor blast.”
Steve barely has a chance to step inside before someone shouts and he’s aware of a whistling sound heading straight for him. He flings himself to the side, ducking and rolling into a crouch, and above him the whistling is cut off by an abrupt crunch.
“Minimises the risk of hacking,” she tells him, pointedly. “These are non-disclosure agreements. Everyone needs to sign before we can proceed. Some of you know state secrets. Some of you,” she adds, frowning at Bruce, “practically
The flight stabilisers hum and flare into life and Iron Man shoots up into the sky. Steve has to shield his eyes to watch him fly away, in the bright sunlight.
He snaps his fingers.
Bruce lifts an eyebrow at him, lips quirking.
“I... don’t know what means,” Steve says. “Look, just – have you heard anything from SHIELD at all?”
“Interesting colour choice.”
“What? Come on, I like you.”
“In my day,” he says, looking down into his still full glass, “we didn’t put miniature umbrellas in our drinks.”
“But-”
The chair creaks; it’s the only sound in the silence that has descended on the conference room. Tony leans forwards and then back again, first with one shoulder and then the other, testing how the squeaky joint responds to different degrees of pressure. Next to him, Bruce winces and Clint mimes something enthusiastically violent from the other side of the table. Fury, frowning in thought, ignores it.
At last, Pepper draws in a deep breath. Her voice is stilted when she begins to speak again, when she says, “I understand why you’re doing this. I understand why this is all so important to you. That – that’s all I wanted to say.”
He nudges the robot with his toes and the thing whirrs into life, its wheels spinning uselessly in the air. Although it looks completely unfamiliar, there’s something about the noise it makes that Steve recognises.
“Bruce. Bruce. Brucie-goosie. Get over here.”
“You’re telling me.” Tony waves his hand back and forth over the gun, still not touching, muttering under his breath. “Where’s the light source?”
“Anything to avoid a deskjob,” Clint says.
“Told you so.”
“Listen,” he says. “I’ve gotta tell you-”
Steve looks down at the worktop.
“It’s fine, really,” Steve says, but Tony shoots him a look and, rolling his eyes, Steve grips Tony’s hand as best he can, with a hiss and a wince.
Blown this far apart, it looks more like a galaxy than a machine.
“Where’d you come from?” Steve demands. “Why’re you naked?”
“I know,” she says. “But you make good drinks.”
“You going all the way down?” Tony says.
Steve taps the corner as instructed – he’s expecting
“Yeah? How’s that treating you?”
They search the area inside and out, checking every room. Thor pulls the carpets up with one hand, to the consternation of the hotel manager until Tony promises the Foundation will cover all repair costs.
Steve takes the communicator away from his ear and looks at it for a little while.
The communicator fills up with a view of their feet from ground level as the robot rolls almost silently across the floor. Tony drags his finger back and forth across the screen and the view moves with his motions, spinning the full 360 degrees as promised, and when he taps a spot on the screen the robot turns and heads in that direction.
Spreading his fingers, he rubs his palm over his pencils, so they roll back and forth together beneath the press of his hand. The orange gets caught in the folds of his bed linen, but Steve leaves it there. He pushes himself up onto his knees, craning his neck at Tony’s sheet of paper.
The elevator glides down silently through this world that Tony built for himself.
Tony blinks, glancing sideways at Steve as if he’d forgotten he were there. Then he smirks.
“There’s always a choice,” he says. “Look, maybe – maybe my life is so tied up with yours that if I did it all again without you things
“Remind me again why we aren’t doing this at Stark Tower?” he asks the room at large.
Steve doesn’t answer, but with a click the door unlocks.
Tony jumps in fright. When he looks back at the end of the corridor again, the ghost has disappeared. He’s going to be in so much trouble. He begins to push the study door open and he hears an unfamiliar voice.
time to disappear,” he says.
He stares at them all. A couple of the soldiers even look away.
Steve nods.
Tony – drawing a bundle wrapped in sweatshirts out of the bag – pauses. He glances sideways at Steve, raising his eyebrows, and sweeps his gaze up and down Steve’s body.
He climbs to his feet and heads for the exit, pausing to gather up the fallen pieces of paper as he passes them, finally balling the handful up in his fist and tossing it over his shoulder at the elevator doors. It’s a quick ride up to the penthouse and a quicker walk to the kitchen door.
Steve needs to know everything, or else what has he got?
Daddy says, “What are you talking about?”
“And tell him,” Steve continues, unfazed, “that we’ll be willing to share our own information in return.”
“I was joking-”
“Wow,” Steve mumbles. He wonders whether Tony is from the sixties, or the seventies, or even the eighties. His head is spinning. His mouth feels numb. He wonders where Bucky is, with that ice.
“Okay,” he says. “That works. I’ll see you in a couple minutes.”
Without looking around at him, Romanoff leans sideways and raps her spoon on his wrist, stilling his hand. Still catching his breath, Barton leans forward on his elbows and says, seriously, “You sure about this, Cap? With all respect and affection for my former colleagues, you give an inch, SHIELD takes a mile. We’re big, mean sharks.”
There’s a pause before Steve says, “Tony?”
“There’ll always be a place for you at SHIELD,” Fury says.
“So close, sir, and yet so far. I am JARVIS, Mr Stark’s personal Artificial Intelligence program.”
“I... don’t want to feed the President a cookie.”
“Want a lift, Captain?” he asks.
“What have you done to me?” Tony says when he is capable of speaking again.
And once again again, a million thanks to everyone on tumblr etc, who've heroically put up with my hysteria and keyboardsmashing over the past couple of months and talked me down from my writing ledges. Liz, Theo, Andy and Adri especially, I think. ILUGUISETYVM.
...?”
“World always needs saving, right?”
Barton silently punches the air and Thor, not so silently, throws his arms up and cheers. He grabs Bruce, sitting next to him, and pulls him into a tight embrace that leaves Bruce jerkily, awkwardly, patting him on the back.
That’s Romanoff’s cue to get to her feet. She nods at Tony.
He says, “You’re right, I’m sorry, I guess I did. Got over-excited. It’s-” Heaving the last roll onto the floor, he drops his sample onto the empty work surface and spreads out a sheath of drafting paper. “It’s something kinda important. You know me, asshole at the best of times, right?”
Steve has barely finished nodding before Barton turns around to stare at Romanoff. She raises her eyebrows and sits up a little straighter, her poker face firmly in place.
“Many happy returns.” He wiggles his fingers at Barton. “That enough for you?”
He says it softly, as though he means it. It’s that, probably, that makes Tony open his mouth again, not quite sure what he’s going to say until he’s saying it.
They share a dark look.
“My friends,” Thor say slowly, the laughter in the room trailing off as he rises to his feet; he towers larger than life over everyone in his helmet and cape. “My friends, can you feel-”
Tony is walking down a corridor in the dark, towards the sound of voices. He turns left.
“What’s your name?”
He shakes his head, starts again.
Steve wonders.
“And then what?”
“It’s only a year or two-” Tony begins, before he cuts himself off abruptly.
“Hey,” Steve says. “Where’s Ms Potts – I mean, Pepper gone?”
Yinsen lowers his fistful of wires and looks up at Tony over the rim of his little round glasses. He smiles faintly and says, “I’ve found that people rarely do.”
“I’m pretty sure I’ve held water pistols heavier than this,” he says and he flips it around to peer down into the barrel of the gun.
Tony looks up at Steve over his shoulder, his gaze passing over Steve’s face and following the line of Steve’s arm around and back up to that hole in the wall. He runs his fingers along one of the tiny cracks spidering out from it and he shakes his head.
bet Bucky a candy bar that I knew who would win. I felt kinda bad about it afterwards, though.”
Sitting down on the freshly cleared space on the table, Tony peers over at the mess of papers now spread across the floor. “It’s still in a pile. Technically.”
Fifty feet in the air over the desert, with every bone in his body rattling and the jet pack blasting and great billowing clouds of fire from the Ten Rings compound licking at his heels, Tony feels the familiar dip and swoop in his stomach.
Tony has his faceplate up and he slides his newly acquired shades down his nose to peer at Steve. He traded them from a fan by the ice cream stand, in exchange for a picture of the fan kicking Iron Man between the legs.
. With his safety goggles and his neat white lab coat and the clipboard in his hands, he looks like a real boy at last.
“Okay. I... wasn’t the only person looking for you. I got there first because I’ve always been a bit of a Captain America fanboy,” he says with a smirk. “So I had a pretty accurate idea where in the ice you were. And I had to get to you first – I
“The bag of grain is warmed,” Thor declares, wiggling his fingers in the now-broken microwave obliviously, “and yet the air inside the magic box is not! My father will be most impressed when I tell him of this sorcery.”
“The labs are on floors twenty to thirty,” she says. “But he’s probably down in the basement workshop. When in doubt, ask JARVIS.”
“And you’re Captain America. Come on, make George Washington proud.”
“Go,” he whispers, “Go on, go.”
“Okay, great, that’s – Gotta trust Captain America. It probably counts as treason if you don’t.”
“Stark, what
“This isn’t a civilian nap, it’s a spy nap. Spies need naps.”
, he thinks over the roar in his ears,
“Until it fell into the wrong hands.”
“There’s no time to explain, Yinsen, just trust me. I’m a trustworthy guy, this is my trustworthy face, I’ll – he’ll explain it all to you later. Just put this in now, before I...”
“Imagine that, sir.”
He smoothes the map down again, ignoring the quiet sounds of Tony and Pepper’s voices fading away, and he says, “Show me again where you heard the rumours.”
Tony glances at his watch. The hands are motionless. He shakes his wrist, then sighs.
“Gotta try,” he says.
There’s some horror B-movie playing in the late night screening at Steve’s favourite crummy movie theatre. Tony had twitchily insisted they went in and bought their tickets separately, so the place is deserted when Steve ambles inside. Ticket purchased – and a cheerful story told about how his girlfriend was coming later, had picked the film, she was the one who liked these scary movies, not him – he grabs a Sprite and a handful of paper napkins before making his way to the screen. There’s a few other people inside, but Tony is easy to spot – he’s sitting at the end of an aisle, as if he just fallen into the first seat he saw. He’s holding himself very still.
Someone kicks him under the table.
Fury nods, and straightens up, and heads for the door.
Tony lets out a long, slow sigh, sagging back in his seat. “There. Good as new. Or rather, better than new. You can let go now.”
“Or it’s a trap.”
He grows louder and more forceful with every word, pacing towards Tony and then away again, but when he pauses for breath he goes still.
“Not too bad. You’ll be back to punching Hitler again in no time.”
Back by the elevator, a small, round robot the size of a dinner plate is trying to drag one of Steve’s boots away. Steve has big feet and he likes his boots sturdy, so the furiously beeping robot has only managed to move the boot a few inches, leaving a streak of mud across the floor. He has to kneel down and wrestle his boot from the robot’s appendages – flat hooks that were probably originally intended to scrape mud, but which the robot is now using more like pincers. It pinches his toe to prove the point, once he finally tugs the boot back, the brush set in its front whirring angrily.
Tony taps the shield and says, “Ta-da,” his voice coming from the phone in Steve’s hand almost faster than it comes from Tony’s mouth.
“Bye,” Steve says.
Steve has to duck under some awning, and dodge a group of slow-moving tourists, and there are skyscrapers constantly blocking his view in every direction. When he looks up again, he can’t see Tony. He walks on.
Thor next to him, still in his cape; Romanoff is sitting neatly on Thor’s other side with Barton next to
“There is that. And you’re the star-spangled man with a Hitler-punching plan.”
“Board, designs, Friday. Important. Got it.” Steve nods and at Pepper’s quick thumbs up, he heads back towards the elevator. “Have a nice day, Ms – Pepper.”
The door to Tony’s personal elevator glides open noiselessly, the movement so natural it seems almost organic. There’s no elevator operator – but then even at the height of his fame in the forties, Steve never exactly visited the kinds of places where people pressed the buttons for you. He steps cautiously inside, the door sliding shut behind him with barely a whisper of air. Inside the walls are black and shiny, and the ceiling is white and shiny, everything gleaming from a light source Steve can’t find. Nor can he – he realises as he turns in a slow circle, closely examining the walls – find any buttons.
“What’s the goddamn point of it,” he says, “if I can’t
“I think my ego just crawled into a corner and died. Nothing I say to a girl will ever measure up to, ‘hey baby, wanna be queen of an alien realm where the streets are paved with gold and everyone’s really attractive?’”
in the army.”
“Pass.”
“You didn’t miss out on much. Did you know you’re meant to spit the wine out after you’ve tasted it?” Tony dumps ice into both glasses and holds one out to Steve. He rattles it vigorously until Steve, with a sigh, takes it. “There you go, most expensive mouthwash you’ll ever use. Pepper took me wine-tasting once. Business trip. Surrounded by morons in suits. Hell on Earth.”
“Me? I’m an open book.”
Reappearing is never the easiest part. For a moment, Tony staggers, his knees jarring at the impact, and he sinks down onto the floor. He rests his elbows on his knees and then, letting out a slow breath, he rests his forehead on the backs of hands.
“Authorisation complete,” JARVIS says.
After he lets his publicist know they need to organise the world’s first press conference for an honest to god superhero team and they need it fast - Sofia takes it in stride; he figures she can take anything in stride after dealing with ‘boss returns from assumed death and builds a flying robot suit’ – it takes less than ten minutes for the company gossip mill to reach Rhodey’s ears.
“Thanks, that’s reassuring,” Pepper says, shooting him an exasperated look, but she lets go of his arm, smoothing the crease out of his sleeve before she steps back and looks him up and down. Lips pursed, she plucks a sliver of glass from his hair and raises her eyebrows.
P.S. quixotesque, I'm
Lifting his shades up to get a better look at the dent in the railing, Tony says, “Tell them to add the damage to my tab.”
The Hulk, Steve swears, actually rolls his eyes at that and he lifts the communicator up higher pointedly, glaring at Steve.
“No problems,” Tony says.
“O-kay,” Steve says slowly.
“Bigger couch,” he adds, sitting up a little straighter. “Maybe two. There are a lot of us, and Thor and Cap probably weigh more than the rest of the team put together. Item two: press conference. As in, we’ll need to schedule one.”
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Tony says mildly, leaning forwards with his hands on the edge of the conference table. “I think you’ve got me confused with some other guy. You know, some guy who
“We should wait until Fury has assigned a SHIELD liaison,” Romanoff says. “The agent will need to know what we’re going to do and say.”
“Tony...”
“Thanks, Mr... um?” Steve feels the elevator start to rise, as silent and smooth as the rest of the tower has been so far, and he lowers his hand from the wall; the blue light buttons linger for a few beats more, and then blink out. “Jeeves, was it? I remember you from Mr Stark’s SHIELD file.”
Steve catches. He turns the thing over in his hands to look at it – it’s shaped like a small tortoise, flat on the bottom with three rotating wheels, and rounded on the top with a shell of shifting, overlapping metal plates. The whole thing is dark grey, matte and not much bigger than the palm of Steve’s hand.
He follows Bucky down the steps. His ears are ringing. He wants to look back. But instead, he offers the girls a piece of candy and he lets the tide of movement, surging all in one direction, draw him deeper into the audience. Bucky tugs him on towards the flying car.
Up on the screen, a young woman screams.  She claws away from the monster attacking her, her skimpy nightdress catching on shards of glass. Steve can’t remember what the movie is called or what the monster’s purpose is. He watches the light flicker across Tony’s face as the woman runs out of the house and into the trees, passing through shadows and moonlight and shadows. Tony’s pale face.
He trails off mid-sentence, halfway through the door. He frowns around at the kitchen island-cum-conference table. Everyone else has gotten there before him, which isn’t unusual, and they’re all eating together, which is surreal on more levels than he cares to count. There’s even a plate conscientiously left before the empty seat between Pepper and Romanoff, with a slice of toast waiting for him, as if he’s fallen through a portal into a wholesome family TV show. Thor beams up at him, chewing vigorously; he’s wearing an ‘I love New York’ t-shirt that’s at least one size too small for him.
The light clears from Tony’s vision to reveal Steve watching him. He has looked up at the sound of Tony’s approach, but there’s a sketchpad propped against the edge of the wall and a pencil in his hand, tip still balanced on the paper. Tony nods at him, pointing his fingers at his own eyes and then at Steve’s eyes. Steve frowns back.
Tony hesitates, looking away. He grabs the fabric sample back from Rhodey and, draping it around his neck, begins to pull the bolts off his desk and onto the floor.
“Ah, Fair Widow, your wisdom puts us all to shame.”
He watches Tony’s hands toying nervously with the portal gun. The sight of the HYDRA logo, etched clumsily into the side as if it were an afterthought, still makes something lurch sickly in his stomach, as much rage as it is grief; and the wall against his back is cold and hard; and he’s god only knows how deep underground. But he glances sideways at Tony, who is watching Steve out of the corner of his eye, and Steve lets out the breath he’s been holding for upwards of seventy years.
“Yeah, yeah, well done us, fighting the good fight, but-” Tony snaps his fingers as best he can while they’re encased in metal. He taps Steve on the wrist; the gauntlet is surprisingly warm. “We did it all without Fury telling us to jump and specifying how high. No being sent out like his extremely handsome flying monkeys. No near death experiences, or nuclear missiles, or Nick. Just us, doing our extremely handsome thing.”
look fine.
“Nightmare, more like.”
didn’t keep crushing the prototypes. Yeah, I’m talking to you, mister,” he adds, raising his voice, when the Hulk roars in their direction. “You’re a menace! You should be locked up!”
“Still clear,” Steve says, ignoring the rest of it.
“Are you seeing this too?”
“Look,” Tony says in a rush. “I’m sorry that the future grabbed you.”
“I don’t know,” he says. “It was a war, I was a soldier. Most of the time I just threw it at Nazis and HYDRA. Red Skull, I guess?”
He shoves his paper and pencils to one side and leans down over the edge of the bed. The top of his head hits the floor. Steve laughs. Reaching under his bed, the blood rushing to his head and dust getting up his nose, he sneezes, then winces and laughs harder. He stretches his fingers as far as they can go, until at last he snags the edge of the wooden box and pulls it out.
“Yeah?” Tony glances up at him with a crooked grin and a hint of pride. “Maybe it’s not one for the scrapheap, then. How’d it do?”
The Hulk snorts, heaving the car up onto his shoulder as easily as if it were a punching bag. It shakes and creaks. Without the Hulk sitting on it, Steve can just about make out bite marks in the bumper.
He hands Tony a pile of neatly folded clothes, with a car battery and a tangle of bloody wires balanced on top, and then he sits down on the edge of the cot and looks at Tony very hard.
Steve laughs. He presses an open-mouthed kiss to the side of Tony’s jaw. His hand is warm on Tony’s stomach.
“Heard my name,” he says.
Then he buys milk.
“Tony, I
“Aye, Jane often joins me on clear nights.”
Shaking her head, looking back over her shoulder with every step, she turns and runs back the way she came, towards the sound of voices. Tony lets out the breath he was holding. He lowers himself down into the undergrowth, leans back against a tree trunk and closes his eyes.
“Are you kidding me?” Steve laughs. “We were here all along? I thought we were in your super secret lair.”
“Oh, geez,” Steve says. “Sorry, here.”
He watches as the metal plates start to shift beneath it, opening like the petals of a flower and slowly, quietly, levering the little robot up onto its side.
Steve breathes out slowly, quietly. It’s good to know that they can do this, just about; talk about Howard and come out the other side still breathing. He watches the tension bleed out of the line of Tony’s back as he returns to his work.
He keeps his eyes closed for a moment longer, until down on the street Tony rests his elbow on the buzzer and lets it ring, and ring, and ring.
Steve hesitates, thinking it over.
Tony looks up at Steve, smirking. “Well, come on, Captain. Have you got what it takes to break the damn thing?”
“That’s nothing to do with me. It’s for someone else. She just wants me to watch–” He cuts himself off abruptly, mouth snapping shut, and then he drops his face into his hands. “It’s nothing to do with this. You’ve asked your questions, now go away.”
“Sorry.” Steve shrugs, not particularly sorry. “What was that about?”
“How’s it sounding?”
“I did? Oh, now that’s promising. What else was different?”
“But seriously,” Tony adds, a little breathless. “Skip it. Actually, catch up on all the tech advances, because that’s important. Computing, cell phones, the world wide web, et cetera.
