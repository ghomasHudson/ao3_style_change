Something creaks and groans beneath him, but Steve ignores it, yanking Tony back just as he’s about to hit that crest. He wraps a hand around himself and tugs Tony back by his hair with the other.
Preferably at him. And maybe not just smile.
Tony’s not wrong.
“I know,” Tony murmurs.
“Well, and I say this as gently as I can, you could stop drinking, for one. Jim said he pinned you?”
“Didn’t you?”
He’s rooted to the spot, frozen with Tony’s warm hand on his shoulder.
If that’s what Tony needs. Whatever he needs.
“Speak up, kid.”
“Then take me home, I’m hungry.”
It’s not enough—
It was easy to lose himself in preparing Tony, taking painstaking care with every curl of his fingers, using this special time to press quiet reminders of how much Steve loved him directly into Tony’s body. It was as much an apology as a silent urge to wake from the nightmares. Steve made due with what he could to chase the bad dreams away.
They’d buried men at sea for hundreds of years, hadn’t they? Stitched them up in white, said a rushed prayer and dumped their bodies into the sea for all eternity. During the war it had been a necessity. No casket, no flag, just a corpse and the endless rocking of the water for a man’s final rest.
Steve grabs Tony’s hand and drags him down the short aisle between all their friends and family before he stops. He doesn’t know where to go next. He pauses at the end of the trail of flowers and looks at Tony, expectant. His true north, always.
“Sometimes I forget how similar you and Bucky are.” Steve picks at a loose thread on his pants, struggling to maintain eye contact. “You would have been friends, I think. If all of this stuff hadn’t happened.”
He switches gears, pulling up holo after holo of new projects waiting for his attention and flips through them at a rapid pace, trying to find something to focus on. Something to quiet his mind while he sequesters away the dread in his stomach, forcing it down until it’s a pressure cooker of emotion waiting to explode.
A full-body shudder runs through Steve, then suddenly the hand holding him down is wrapped around his throat, pulling him back so Steve can seal their mouths together in a kiss Tony can feel in his bones. For a moment, Steve’s grip cuts off his oxygen supply and the arousal in Tony’s gut winds impossibly tighter, balls drawing up against his body with the rush towards his climax and he files that one away for later.
Tony was cold and he wasn’t moving.
Scott, Sam, Peter and Rhodey, all dressed to the nines, wearing an eclectic mixture of expressions almost as diverse as the patterns of their perfectly knotted ties.
From this vantage point, Tony has a new canvas to explore and his hands are on Steve before he can catch his breath. Work-rough palms run over every knob of his spine on their path down to the slight curve of Steve’s ass.
“Yes. I knew.”
Tony’s eyes melt into molasses, shining and bottomless. “So that’s why I’m here,” he whispers, almost to himself. “Took you long enough, don’t you think?”
“Say it for me, gorgeous. Say his name when you come.” And when they were both so close, his voice pitching off into breathy gasps. “I want it too, baby. I wish he were here with us. God, Bucky. Christ, Steve, just imagine it. Imagine us all together.”
Recognition and understanding flash across his face as he considers the timeline, but Steve’s stomach sinks when his expression darkens. “You mean you couldn’t do that to
Steve blinks.
Tony swallows hard, barking imaginary orders for his brain to consider any other topic, because this one is doing nothing to help with the whole bile issue.
Despite the extreme amount of effort it seemed to take, head dizzy and spinning with pleasure, Tony propped himself up on an elbow and pressed a hand flat against Bucky’s stomach. “We’ll love you anyways. Always.”
“Tony can we just–”
When did he start being able to feel Steve’s movements in his bones?
“You think it’s heat?” Though that wouldn’t fully account for the shift in the Omega’s scent.
When he had been little, Jarvis had been one of the few people in his life able to help him quiet his mind and drift into some semblance of sleep. Jarvis was also the only one who read to him; his father too busy with work, and too aloof to be interested, and his mother too preoccupied with social commitments to be home in the evenings.
“Wrap your arms around me, Steve, I’m right here,” earns him a second night later in the week.
“Tony?”
“Oh doll,” Bucky murmured darkly from between his legs, smearing his lips across the inside of Tony’s thighs with a sloppy kiss, spreading his slick. “We’re just getting started.”
“Oh my god. You’re joking, right? Tell me you’re joking. You can’t be that blind!” Mirth dancing around the corners of Tony’s mouth.
“I know, I know,” Tony quiets, rubbing circles on her back. “Never again. You can do this though. You’re invincible, you’re fantastic, you’re—”
In the middle of the night, Tony wakes feeling sated and deliciously warm. He buries closer to Steve’s heat, pressing his face into the hard lines of his chest and curling his arm tighter around his trim waist. Steve’s breathing is too shallow and for a second, Tony almost let’s himself drift back to sleep, but Steve starts tracing patterns on his skin and he forces his eyes open.
“As in, let’s move on. I can’t say it doesn’t sting, Nat. It probably will for a long time. We’ll just try and figure it out anyway.”
“Oh, darling you’re perfect like this. Gonna fuck you every day for the rest of our lives. It’s such a beautiful life, Steve Rogers. You’ve given me such a beautiful life.”
It was an unexpected surprise when Steve learned the team had gotten a real kick out of his new-found obsession with food. Soon it became a habit, one of the other Avengers appearing out of nowhere with a new (and mostly tasty) treat, watching with bated breath to enjoy his reactions.
Steve grimaces, clocking how Tony takes intention breaths, deep and slow. Everything in him wants to scream why Steve is wrong, and that’s not true. Tony has always,
Why would they be? They’ve failed.
, Steve.”
“Yeah, punk. I already knew that.” Bucky gives him a light sock to the shoulder before he crosses the room and wordlessly hands Steve a tissue. They both pretend not to notice that Bucky’s sniffling too.
They haven’t had a trail on Bucky in weeks, and he wants to crawl out of his skin. Anticipation builds like a tsunami but doesn’t crest because every time they get close, every time someone gets a lead, Bucky outsmarts them. He’s amazing and horrific to track, leaving a trail of damage and dead HYDRA agents in his wake.
The words died in his mouth when Tony launched himself into his arms, throwing them about Steve’s neck and kissing him for all he was worth. It was a damned good first kiss too, with Tony’s lean body fitting into his as if it had belonged there all along.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s a nice feeling after his tired eyes have spent so long squinting, trying to fit and force pieces into place. The picture he’s looking at now isn’t even the one he started with, but somehow that feels right.
Tony tried to nod,
For weeks leading up to that night, they had tumbled into bed together, hands frantic in a race to learn each other’s bodies. But no matter how exhausted Steve had been after, sweat and blissed out, Tony would ask him to go. He’d all but begged Steve to leave.
Steve catches sight of Tony across the battlefield, whooping with joy with Peter in his arms before Bucky comes barrelling towards him, rifle pointed at the ground. The metal arm slaps hard on his back as Bucky embraces him. Steve breathes for the first time in half a decade.
Lying to their teammates was too easy, as Tony begged off for a series of business meetings on the East Coast. Then, a few hours later, Steve rides off on his bike towards Washington for training at the Triskelion. So much for the spies he supposedly works with.
“You two are going to make sure he doesn’t tear the wallpaper off the wall, right?” Tony asks. Rhodes slaps a hand down on his shoulder, and Steve winces a little, his ribs still tender.
Tony’s never quite seen that look on Steve before. As if there’s gallon upon gallon of white-hot lava bubbling just below the surface and it’s taking everything in Steve to hold it back, keep it from spilling over and claiming all the ground between them. Every other time before, Tony’s been buried alive, crushed, and insignificant under the weight of Steve’s ever-present resolve.
He wills away the urge to ask Tony why he’d even want him like this.
“You know, if we just tried, it might even get easier? We could at least figure out some way to exist in the same space.” Steve hisses between his teeth, anger overtaking everything else.
“Tell me again, anyway.”
The question feels loaded and it sets off his internal defense system. But this is Peter.
“After everything that’s changed?” Tony supplies and Steve gives him a slow nod, the lines of his forehead shifting and contracting between his eyebrows. His shoulders are slumped forward, something that might have signaled comfort a few minutes ago, but now give off an air of resignation while he sits there, prepared to take his lot if Tony turns him down.
“I think you know why.” Steve murmured, eyes on Tony’s mouth.
“And how long has he been watching?” Tony asks, hoarse.
There’s still nothing to say.
“Take me to bed, Steve. Show me how to treat your O right.”
And now Steve can’t even think about what he’s done in a year, rundown by the deluge of loss. They saved the world six years ago, and what do they have to show for it now?
It didn’t matter to anyone, least of all him.
“Why wouldn’t I be okay with that? Bucky can do what he likes.” Steve replied, and the tousled brown hair had popped off his chest, presenting him with a full view of grinning, gloating Tony Stark.
“There’s no us, anymore.”
“Yeah, Buck?”
A sad noise rumbles in the back of his throat as Tony threads fingers through Steve’s hair. “You don’t have to be alone anymore.”
“I knew it.” Tony said definitively after they’d kissed for what felt like hours.
Tony tugs his shirt over his head, reaching between them to get a firm grip on Steve’s cock and stroke him through his sleep pants. Their fingers tangle together as Steve tries to help him push them off, and then they’re laughing between kisses that smear and slide against each other.
Steve leans forward and Tony realizes they’re both holding the same breath.
In moments, he’d be underwater. The Avalon Protocol might be enough to get Steve to safety either way, but if he could just hold out a few moments longer—
Later, Steve will remember this as the exact moment when he stepped out of his own body and started to drift away.
Maybe Bucky could be everything at once and something new altogether.
“I’d say you’re right, but I was having dinner with Happy that night and that took priority. Have to keep the romance alive, you know?”
The metal hand wraps around one of Steve’s biceps and pulls him back a few more paces. The fingers seem to catch before they curl, and Tony wonders what kind of shoddy job this ‘Shuri of Wakanda’ has done on the prosthetic he’d currently wearing.
Steve doesn’t smile. He looks gutted.
When Tony eventually pulls away and starts zipping up his pants, Steve follows suit. He pushes off the car and reaches down to tug his jeans up when Tony gasps.
“I know.”
Leaving the Avengers had never been a part of the plan.
Steve admits, drawing Tony in for a sweet, chaste kiss, before pulling him over to the sofa. He settles him down, one hand on his knee and meets his eye with an even gaze.
“The second it’s over.” Steve stumbles into his clothes without his usual perfunctory grace. “I promise, we’re going to sort it all out.”
With another gag, Tony thrusts in deeper, down into the hollow of Steve’s throat until he cuts off Steve’s air completely. He stays there, and just as Steve’s vision starts to blur at the edges, he pulls back, giving Steve just enough time for one gasping breath before he fucks back into the hilt.
could have this. Tony, we get to have this for the rest of our lives.”
The shove Steve got back jostled Tony’s head in his lap, dislodging a disgruntled grumble from his throat. The alphas settled around him, predictably so.
Twining their fingers together, he presses Tony’s hands over his head, stretching out over him until their hips fit together, rolling as the pleasure builds low in his stomach. He wants to take his time, guide Tony to a peak just to hold him there, not letting him tip over until Tony’s desperate and pleading, out of his mind with need.
“You’re a menace.” Steve whines, already rubbing up against his thigh again, hard and thick. That glorious super soldier perk. “Tomorrow. You promise? No running away.”
Steve’s defenses are down. He’s exhausted and his thoughts feel sluggish, two steps behind the rest of him. The pang of losing Phil is lingering, sharp like a knife in his belly, but the fear of losing Tony was something different entirely.
for Captain fucking America, Tony couldn’t.
“I asked you to fuck me, honey, not woo me. You’ve wooed enough by now, don’t you think?”
Being a ghost might be a nice experience. He could haunt Steve. Rile him up on his good days, slip his fingers through his hair on the bad ones. Except then he’d have to watch Steve mourn and Tony can’t bear to think of what it might be like to drown in that ocean of grief.
There had to be something he could say to make this right. Somewhere, in the back of his mind, there had to be a plan of what he might do or say to take it all back and start again. He’d waited so long to make this right. This couldn’t be it.
“If you’re mine, I want you to come for me,” Tony grunts, and the rough order sends him jerking forward, panting into Tony’s throat as the building waves crest and he comes in hot stripes, shooting up Tony’s chest while the pleasure races all the way down to his toes. He’s laid bare, flying apart with only Tony’s hands on his hips to hold him down.
Steve is close enough now that Tony can smell him. He still smells like home. Their home.
“Okay.”
Spit trickles out of the side of his mouth but Steve doesn’t seem to notice, making little noises of contentment and losing himself in a rhythm that drives Tony wild.
It’s so easy to set all the bad aside and lose himself in everything else.
“I need to pick up the papers first.”
Steve had still stared at him most days, waiting for the old Bucky to come home.
“You should go first, Buck.” Steve suggested, hands coming to grip at Tony’s hips so he could lean in and nip at his chest. When he captured one of Tony’s nipples between his teeth, sucking and then biting down lightly, it was Bucky who groaned.
Tony shouted urgent orders to JARVIS to conserve power: reduce weapons capacities, cut all but emergency communication, anything to focus enough power on the thrusters to get them to land. Steve might be fine. His near bottomless energy reserves could be enough to help him swim towards the coast, but even with the emergency releases, the water was too frigid for Tony.
“You’ve made your point. You got anything to add to this, Steve?”
The assassin had settled back into the couch without a sound, eyes focused on Steve’s hot face. He took a long, smug drink of his coffee when Steve stayed silent.
“But you—it was an order—” Steve breaks off with a sob, yanking at his gloves to get his hands on Tony’s face and touch him skin to skin, just one last time before they start trying to pull him away. They’ll have to, Steve isn’t going anywhere. He’s not going anywhere without Tony. Not ever.
Almost there. Almost—
Tony flicks on the news and tries not to think about the bottles in the kitchen. He’ll go soon. He will. He can walk away from the bottles. All things considered, he has to, because the last thing he wants is for Steve to come striding in, tall and proud, when he’s lying under the table drowning in scotch.
This story wasn't originally going to end on a bittersweet note, but the more I thought about where we were headed, the more I realized it had to. That's the way this kind of love goes, especially a love like this.
“I’m fine.” His fingers don’t respond properly when he tries to curl them around Tony’s, twitching uselessly at his sides. Everything aches. He realizes he can’t see out of one of his eyes.
The room takes a deep breath and for a minute, it’s silent. Tony lets out a breath he’s been holding onto all day.
There isn’t a thought in Steve’s mind, not a whisper of plan or the next move. They’re gone. They’re
“You should’ve killed me.”
“Stevie. Steve, are you listening to me?”
Steve had walked away from their marriage and he was all but forcing Barnes out of his life, only months later.
JARVIS tries to say something more but it gets lost in the white static screaming in Steve’s ears. Everything is cold and Steve hadn’t realized anything would ever hurt more than freezing to death.
A room that smelled rancid, like food gone bad weeks ago.
Tony tilts his head in a nod back to their friends, all standing now, cheering with red-rimmed eyes and the biggest, brightest smiles Steve’s ever seen.
“Bring it on, Stark.”
It meant
“I know the feeling.” Tony shifts uncomfortably on the bed, nervousness dampening the back of his neck with a line of sweat.
“You don’t even know what I’m going to ask you.”
“Language! Sarah’d tan your hide for that kind of talk, pal,” Bucky chastises, and there’s laughter twinkling in his eyes when Steve pulls away. It’s the same laughter from when they were little more than children, when Bucky was all mischief and temper, and his ma and Bucky both could set Steve straight in an instant.
It’s not until the elevator opens that Tony realizes his heart is back in his throat.
“Yeah, strange.” Peter picks at something on the counter absent, eyes trained between the bit of dried waste and the flurry of information flickering across the screens. He doesn’t look up to meet Tony’s eyes.
“These fucking socks.”
Steve knocks his hand off his chest. “There are other sets.”
He’d escaped after the birthday party, crying off some excuse about a last-minute project when Bucky had tried to corner him, and had crawled into bed sometime after three that morning only to roll right back out before dawn. Steve had caught him around the waist and tried to pin him in place, but he’d dragged the spare blanket off the bed with him and padded out of the room, wiping his eyes and on the hunt for caffeine.
“Listen to me. We are going to screw this up again.” Steve shakes his head in protest. “We are. That’s what we do. But we’ve got to start making plays together, not opposing each other. I need you to talk to me.” He pauses and waits for Steve to meet his eye. “I need you not to be Captain America the second things start to become uncomfortable. Stop hiding behind that.”
This wasn’t his Tony, who trusted him and knew he could keep him safe, even in sleep.
It’s a look Tony knows well. Being vulnerable. Exposed and laid bare.
Everyone is there. Everyone he could have ever wanted, spread across the couch and oversized armchairs. In the centre of the room, Peggy is flanked on either side by all the Howling Commandos, relaxing against the couch as if they’re all just there waiting for him.
“Have you noticed he gets lost in space a lot lately?”
Tony sighs. “What is it, kid?”
Suddenly, there was just Steve and his hands.
and tell me that you fucked up. I want you to stop hiding behind the serum and the shield and all the Captain America bullshit and just be Steve.”
Bucky gesticulated sharply to his left arm and it’s missing and deformed glands.
session with a graceful and unbearable arrogance. Plus, he’s a wizard. The kind of stupid wizard who wears a condescending cape for kicks.
“Because I’m a scientist first, right?” Tony asks, with fond sarcasm.
Tony picks up the letter that follows the original. It starts with,
just needs to let him.
Steve doesn’t even realize he’s closed his eyes until Tony’s hips stutter and one hand settles on the side of his face.
Tony glances at the shop owner, and Steve follows his eyes after a beat, feeling like he was pushing his way through molasses, sluggish and uncertain. What had just happened? What was
Bucky and Sam had said that this change might be good for him and though Steve had argued, in the end he had gone along with it. His life had become reduced to a series of decisions and Steve made every one hoping everyone would eventually leave him alone. And mostly they did these days, coming to visit once a week on a near-clockwork rotation to sit in Steve’s little sitting room and look out across the man-made lake below.
Steve wants to
“Tony, I don’t know if that’s–” He waves Rhodey off.
Tony’s maddening like this. Everything about his demeanor is wrong—the walls he’s built around himself as impenetrable as Steve’s shield.
“Sam’s been struggling with the drop drills, and it’s pretty obvious why. We’ve talked about it, but it doesn’t seem to be enough. I was wondering what you thought about letting him run through B.A.R.F.?”
“It was so easy to fall in love with you.”
“And there’s no catch?”
“Ehh, I’ve always been a glutton for punishment.”
When he gets home, Tony will tell him. They’ll come up with a plan and bring Barnes in, give him whatever he needs to feel safe and be whole again.
“I can do that.” Steve falters for a breath as if he wants to say something else, but doesn’t. He doesn’t reach out to touch Tony, sliding to his feet and folding his jacket over his arm. He doesn’t linger, taking determined steps towards the door with his back to Tony, something Tony’s never been able to do.
It’s not hard to pick a self. They were always at their best like this, their history waiting to be mapped out. Long before the cracks and fissures formed as the years went on.
Tony glances over his shoulder to meet his eye and sees a small, cheeky
Something fits into place, a key turning in the lock of Steve’s mind and he gets up, paces across the floor, and stands next to the window with a hand in his hair and the other on his hip. Tony could laugh because Steve had the nerve to call him dramatic as he stands there, shoulders up around his ears, refusing to look at Tony when he hears something he doesn’t like.
“That you’re coming back.” Tony interrupts, purposefully steering his tongue away from the word that keeps coming to mind.
Barnes is staring at him, wide-eyed and horrified, the tie that was looped around his throat a few moments ago curled in his metal fist. He hasn’t made any efforts towards closing his gaping mouth and Tony could clobber them both. This isn’t even Tony’s fight, and Tony has no right to insert himself this way, but he can’t help it. Steve is so goddamn condescending and he’s repeating the same mistakes over and over again because he’s too stubborn to open his eyes.
Steve plants his feet and drives Tony forward on his chest, taking over and dragging him back onto his cock. Tony moans, low and long, boneless in the face of Steve’s strength.
Steve’s Ma had told him that when the right person came along, he would just know it.
It’s muddy and complex, and Tony can feel his own heart breaking as he looks the man he loves in the eyes and silently begs for him not to let Tony go through with it, even as he shoves his fists into his pockets and steels himself to push on.
Steve sums it up best when he says:
“Baby you know fan mail time is every other Sunday at four.” Tony smiles to himself, because even though she’s learning more and more every day, FRIDAY is no JARVIS. He misses JARVIS something fierce and it had hurt to leave him after Tony had rebuilt his coding from scratch. It wouldn’t take much to reinstate him in Malibu, but he has a soft spot for the infant AI now and he can’t wait to see how she grows.
“You need to bring in the kid.”
“What did I do?” Tony asks despite himself, voice cracking as shame rises up to stoke the ache in his chest into a sharp, piercing pressure. “What did I do that made you stop trusting me in the first place.”
“We need your help,” Natasha says, leaning a hip against the railing.
“I didn’t want–god, I am so sorry. I never meant for that. I only wanted to stop you; Tony I swear. And I almost – I can’t believe I – Tony, I’m sorry. I should have known better. Hell, I did know better. I remember thinking ‘it’s the suit, just power down the suit and it’ll all stop’. But I know you’re not invincible, and I did it anyway. I’m–I am so sorry.”
Thankfully, his meeting takes longer than anticipated, and Pepper insists on getting coffee afterward, which means by the time he’s back at the Compound it’s near dinner time.
Before he can answer the question, his stomach growls.
“What kind of issue?”
Tony saunters over to him, looping two fingers into his belt buckle. “Why’s that, honey? You’re not jealous, are you?”
It wouldn’t have mattered either way.
Steve had missed him with an all-encompassing loss and he knew Tony must feel the same. He knew Tony loved him. He knew Tony would still want him to do this for him, just like he always had.
They unwrap each other with reverent fingers and it feels like touching bare skin for the first time. Tony’s work-rough hands explore the planes of his chest, thumbs dragging over his nipples and pressing down into the buttresses of his hips. The arc reactor gives off a gentle hum, lighting up Tony’s face and reflecting in the blown-black of his eyes and Steve considers that it might be impossible to resist Tony this way.
“My fault. Could have been worse. Take a deep breath, you’re okay. You didn’t hurt me. I’m okay too.”
Steve blinks. “Then invite me to stay with you.”
The kisses continue, unbroken and growing more and more desperate as Steve possesses him with his tongue and sharp nips to his lower lip that make Tony groan. Pleasure sparks along every nerve ending and Tony feels so exposed, naked even in the thin layers of clothing. Steve has always stripped him of defenses, leaving him bare.
, he couldn’t say. But from one heartbeat to the next he’s in the middle of the living room at his family’s country home, all of eight years old, watching a near-identical scene unfold before his eyes.
“Of course, he’s here. You really think that he’d be anywhere else?” A thumb strokes loving circles against his skin and her voice is soft, accepting. “The rest of us may not understand it, Tony. But you two love each other. You always have. I don’t have to like it to know that it’s true.”
“It’s not.” Tony kisses the base of his spine. “It’s what you do, but it’s not who you are. Just admit it. You have no fucking idea and that’s what all this is about. You’re too scared to be anything except what everyone expects you to be and you’re tearing everything apart trying to prove that you’re right.”
“Don’t do that. Just, tell me it won't be all for nothing. Tell me she didn’t die for nothing.”
“Not tonight,” Steve says with a hand on his chest to stop him. He half-rolls under Tony’s weight and fumbles for the lube under the pillows, pushing it into Tony’s hands with a small smile. “If there’s even a chance this is our last night on earth, you damn well better make it count.”
Steve hit the water before Tony could reach him, disappearing into the dark and sinking fast.
Tony hesitates, hands fluttering at his sides as he presses up against Steve in a hot line from hip to shoulder.
Those aren’t his favourite dreams, but in the larger scheme of things, there hasn’t been a single moment he didn’t cherish. Steve gathers every interaction in his mental Rolodex, each one unique and delicate, like tiny snowflakes gathering in his palms.
“Steve,” Tony’s lips were a ripple across his chest as he spoke, “I think Bucky’s lonely.”
She’d had him longer, and she’d live on with a part of him forever. She had him in a way that Steve never did, and the resentment breeding in his stomach has spent weeks clawing its way to the surface. Pepper got to have that perfect, beautiful life and Steve can’t find it in himself to acknowledge her loss in the face of his own.
In a way, Steve felt like he’d been living in a perpetual winter for weeks.
Of course, Steve had smelled it, but he also hadn’t been prepared to tell Tony that he smelled that scent all the time. That smell was second nature to his own after all these years. It lived right beneath his skin, torturing him and wracking him with guilt when he was wrapped up in their bed. Wrapped up in Tony’s arms.
On that night, Tony had been spitting fire as much as the rest of them.
What Steve hadn’t been prepared for was the immediate way that Bucky and Tony took to each other. A healthy serving of cream in a black cup of coffee; evenly matched.
Then Steve’s kissing him like they have all the time in the world. He kisses him and keeps kissing him until Tony is breathless and laughing against his lips. Until Tony presses up against him with a soft gasp, and his tongue slides into his mouth, and Bucky coughs lightly over his shoulder.
With none of the usual finesse – it was just noodles in water after all – Steve dumped a healthy portion of wagon wheels into the bubbling pot. When they filled and plumped up, he strained and dressed them with a generous dose of butter and parmesan cheese.
Steve is a walking contradiction and that’s when Tony sees it. The fear in Steve’s eyes.
“You stubborn, condescending—” Steve breaks off and steps into the space between them.
Steve sighs, running his hand through his hair and leaving it sticking up at odd angles.
“C’mere sweetheart.” Tony blindly tipped his head at the request, following the hand that was gripping his chin and the soft voice directing him. “Oh fuck, that’s perfect. Just like that.”
“If I’d been the reason you died, I could never—”
“Just a nightmare. Hey, you’re okay.” Steve rubs at his back, nudging a little closer. “Haven’t had one like that in a while, huh?”
“Steve?” Tony whispers into the darkness, swimming through the haze of sleep. “What is it?”
“What do you want? Tony, what? Anything you want.” Steve noses at his throat, pressing kisses from the hollow at the base up to his left ear where he sucks the lobe into his mouth and groans, and Tony thinks he must remember how that drives him wild. Heat licks through his body, forcing more blood into his impossibly hard cock.
As if Tony doesn’t already know that. Isn’t that what so much of this has been about? Living underneath the weight of Steve Roger’s expectations has always been more than even the Iron Man armour could bear. Sometimes, those expectations don’t feel like they’re even about Tony at all.
He can’t even remember the last time he’s been held. Maybe not since she’d come to see him in recovery, after the bunker. Had it really been so long since another person had touched him? Held him close?
The lie is so gauzy thin that Tony wonders why anyone chooses to believe it. But then, people will believe a lot of things when they’re too scared to face reality.
“I thought I’d lost you.” Steve’s voice is a hot whisper against the hospital gown, bleeding through to swipe at his skin. “All this time. All this time, Tony, I’ve been making it work. At least I knew you were out there. That you were okay. But this—” Steve’s voice cracks with a choked sob and he balls his hands into fists in whatever part of cloth he can reach.
It never came up.
Something pulls and tugs at the back of Tony’s mind, waiting to be set free. It belongs to Bucky, the little words he offered him earlier that morning that had made them all chuckle, except now they’re twisting with doubt and dousing him in ice cold water.
Licking his lips, Steve tried to reign in his desire. It’d been so long since he’d seen Tony, touched him, been near him like this. There was so much they had to talk about.
Tony groans, an intoxicating sound that beelines straight to Steve’s cock. He wants to hear it again. He wants to hear it on a loop alongside breathy moans and the way Tony’s voice cracks into a whine when lips struggle to wrap around Steve’s name.
There had been a time that Tony had thought he’d never marry. When he did, he found himself in a marriage so deep and all-encompassing that the thought of divorce hadn’t crossed his mind. Why would it?
Steve blinks.
“Bullshit!” Tony shoots to his feet, jabbing a finger in Steve’s face. It’s not until Tony’s leaning over him that Steve realizes he’s trembling. There’s something wrong, but he can’t get his finger on it, like an old memory that won’t quite come into focus.
The light is too blinding and he has to keep closing his eyes. He’s trying to force the words out but it’s difficult to tell if his mouth is even moving. If he’s dead maybe they won’t hear him anyway, but on the off chance that he’s not, he needs to try.
“It’s not about you. It’s about us. It’s about presenting a united front, and we need to be on the same page. So, let’s figure out what that is and get the team on board. If we’re in this together, you know they will be too.”
“Closure, then?”
Steve shakes with quiet laughter that feels foreign after so many tears and a memory so painful, and reaches down between them to pull the blanket up. The hospital room is cold and the blanket is a sorry excuse for warmth but with Steve at his side, Tony feels himself start to thaw and he nudges closer, wherever he can reach, out towards the ease and comfort that Steve’s brought with him.
In a moment of uncertainty afterwards, when the anger had been set aside, Tony had asked if maybe he’d rather try exploring things with Bucky instead. Tony sitting there, face smooth marble, and offered to lay down their bond, as strained and non-existent as it was, had made Steve want to be sick.
Tony was finally coming to, his head jerking up from the pillows and with hazy, dilated eyes as he started to struggle. His unfocused gaze searched over his shoulder until it locked on Steve and awareness settled in.
“The mission intel was wrong. It was HYDRA. It’s been HYDRA all along and they’re S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony. Everything Peggy ever worked for—” Steve cuts himself off, that’s not the important part. “They sent in the Winter Soldier, and we weren’t ready.”
He’ll apologize tomorrow, send flowers and treat Pepper and Happy to a trip somewhere warm, just the two of them, then call her when it isn’t enough—because buying things for Pepper is never enough, she wants to hear him say the words.
Everything about Steve should have Tony running for the hills, but here he is in broad daylight in the middle of a sidewalk in New York, holding the love of his life anyways. “Maybe we could just sleep. Together. While you’re here. Just sleep.”
Steve laid a warm hand on his back over the blanket, and oh, he could just arch into that hand and let himself fall to pieces.
When Tony’s body bucks up again it takes Steve a moment to realize Tony is squirming away from him, wriggling close enough to the edge of the bed to fumble his way to a bottle of lube. He presses it into Steve’s hand and Steve presses it right back.
If the last time was hate-fucking his way to closure, Tony can’t begin to understand what this is. Whatever he was looking for a handful of minutes ago is long gone now and the ground he’s gained in ninety days is meaningless. Tony is in tatters and yet again he’s as battered and exposed as he was in Siberia.
“Anything that gets Stevie to cancel morning drills.” Bucky stretches widely, back arching and popping, earning him a sideways glance of disgust from Natasha.
It’s been twenty-one days since Tony’s seen the sun rise.
“I want to talk to you,” Steve says plainly, stepping across the few feet that separate them until he’s dropping down into the armchair at the corner of the sofa and leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees. “I didn’t think you’d still be here. Didn’t think I’d get the chance.”
The best part of the future was the food. Had there been this many flavours and textures in the 40s? As he strolled up and down the grocery aisles Steve was amazed by the variety of ingredients, coming together from all different corners of the world.
It didn’t look like anything special.
It’s starting to sink in that Steve will never touch Tony again. Never hold him in his arms or relive the memories as if they were happening again for the very first time. Rhodes and Pepper have all made certain of that.
Steve sat by the window, watching the dancing shadows of the trees in the courtyard with his chin resting in the palm of his hand. It was late into autumn now, and the leaves were falling rapidly. Any day the first snowfall would set it and plunge New York into winter.
At first Steve passed it off as a future thing – men were just more comfortable with their affections in this time. Except then he realized that not only did Clint or Bruce or even Coulson not share his proclivity for physical touch, Tony didn’t seem to touch anyone else half as much as he touched Steve.
Once again, life after Thanos was living in shades of gray.
As he pulled back and started to thrust forward, Tony’s face went smooth with pleasure. A little whine escaped him and Steve rolled his hips again, hoping he could work his name from Tony’s lips or pull forward one of Tony’s breathy, desperate little sighs.
“One goat?” Bucky countered.
“No, I—”
“Peter’s from Queens.” As if that’s what really matters here, “and I guess if you and
“I don’t want to hear any more excuses. He doesn’t get it, and a conversation like that won’t change anything.”
“My pleasure!”
Bucky slid across the couch, right hand pressing into his chest before travelling slowly south.
“I love you,” Steve says, ragged against his mouth, and he starts to ride him at a brutal, unforgiving pace. Tony’s under him, inside him. All around him. “Tony, I love you. You’re everything.
Tony shrugs him off without a response and very unlike Rhodey, he seems to allow it.
He never wanted to stop. He wanted Tony to wake up coming, eyes rolling back with pleasure and know that
If they make divorce cakes, they’d be like wedding cakes. High, proud tiers except sporting two cracked figurines lying face down on black, salty icing.
The room he and Tony had shared for months was dark now, lit by a sliver of light spilling through the slit in the curtains. Everything was exactly as Steve remembered, with all of his old belongings scattered across one side of the room. His radio was still on the nightstand and the sweater he’d been wearing on his last day at the Compound remained in a discarded heap on the desk chair in the corner.
Tony stumbles into the room, tripping over his feet and the inconsistent rhythm pounding in his chest before he drops to his knees in front of Steve. Every part of Steve’s body is trembling, rattling around like shutters in a tornado and Tony can’t remember a time where he’s ever seen him like
been painful.
They were going to have this. Pepper was giving them this.
“A family? With me? One day?”
That’s when he’d known he was falling in love with the man.
In a way, Steve had never felt more alive.
“Thank you.” Steve said shortly, breakfast interrupted by Clint and Natasha ambling out of the elevator and fighting over the remaining dredges of coffee in the carafe.
“I fucked up yesterday. I know that. And I know what I did wrong. I’m sorry, Tony. I’m so very sorry, and I don’t blame you for being angry. I took the stones back, and I apologized to the team for speaking on your behalf.” Steve speaks as if the words are practiced and for a split-second Tony can picture him standing in front of his bathroom mirrors, hands gripping the edge of the counter, repeating the speech over and over again until he gets it right. “I can see that you’re scared. I would be too. But you’ve got to stop pushing me away, Tony. I’m going to fuck up again, I’m not going to get it perfect, hell, I’m not going to get anywhere close. You can’t push me away like yesterday. You can’t shut me out and not be willing to try.”
“Oh Tony, can I—could I meet her? Is that how this works? Would you want me to—”
Steve clenches his hands into fists and looks down at his fingers. There’s no wedding ring. Where is his wedding ring?
Steve slid a hand down his chest, pulling the zipper of the hoodie down as he went and imaging it was Tony’s hands on him. Tony’s hands, creeping up under the bottom of his shirt, pinching one of his nipples and Tony leaning over him, breathing hot air into his mouth. Arousal stretched bowstring tight in the pit of Steve’s stomach and he swallowed, relaxing into the mattress and giving himself over to the coiling heat.
He repeats the words over and over until at least a small portion of his mind believes it and he can relax by a hair’s margin. By then, the movie has ended, and Peter has thrown an awkward arm around him in a half-hug that’s over too soon before he trundles off to bed.
Maybe kiss him to shut him up. That’s something he would have done, once.
Tony is sitting right here, a hairbreadth away. His hand is still raised, and his fingertips are shiny and sticky with sugar. Steve swallows and a thick layer of honey warms him all the way down. When Tony’s eyes follow the trail, tracking the bob in his throat, the warmth explodes into desire.
Until he went and asked stupid questions.
“Tony, hold on, let’s figure this out.”
“So what, then? You think I don’t know when I don’t want to talk to someone? Or is it that you think that doesn’t actually matter.”
Tony peels off the corner and a small sheet of paper, barely bigger than a scratchpad falls onto the counter. A print photograph—who prints photographs anymore?—is tucked inside and he ignores it, favouring the odd piece of mail.
“Yes, Tony.”
He learns that Tony can create masterful stories off the top of his head that keep Morgan’s attention for hours. He learns that Tony can design safety items far better than anything on the market, and that Tony becomes so in tune with Morgan he can predict a tantrum before it happens. The fear of becoming his father disintegrates with time, and Tony softens, becoming the gentle, guiding hand that she flourishes under with more love than any child would ever need.
Tony only contributed something once.
“Oh, Tony, look at you.”
he’s brushing away.
At least Steve has everything else he could need. Family, a best friend. A place to finally call home. All the things that Tony has found in his own way, and he should be happy for his lot. It’s not that he’s bitter, he waded through a well-lived life and there have been plenty of moments of joy. But after meeting Steve, he thought there would be more. So much more.
The suit takes the weight of his fall, but in that split second, Steve can almost get his hand around the gauntlet. It’s just out of reach, beyond both their grasp. Steve struggles through the dirt, mud in his mouth and Tony’s hands clawing at his sides.
Steve flips them over, bucking his hips to tumble Tony sideways and he sinks back down before Tony can catch a breath. With a hand splayed over his chest, Steve can gaze into the depth of those eyes and know what it’s like to come home.
A beautiful creature, with a fascinating mind that kept him on his toes. One hell of a temper, all biting words and cold regard when she was angry. Tony had enjoyed the passion of it all, having a partner who could finally match him again.
“I’ve got you.”
“Tony! We’re not going to make it!”
“It’ll take.” Steve assured him, leaning in to steal kisses from Bucky’s slicked mouth and moaning at the taste.
“Tony.” Steve squeezes him tighter, presses his face into his chest and breaths. Wet spots appear below the arc reactor and Tony realizes that Steve is crying again, silent and motionless. “It’s enough.”
He drops his head into his hands and takes a ragged breath through his fingers, shoulders quivering as if he’s about to burst into tears. Tony wants him to be able to take it, to listen, and to
There’s a long line of civilians ahead of him which is almost reassuring. When Tony leaves the Clerk’s Office, Steve will be gone and he’ll go ‘home’ and have a nice dinner with Pepper and Happy. Tomorrow he’ll take Peter out for a coffee and let him regale Tony with stories of his summer internship at SI before he heads out to the Coast and figures out what comes next.
A hitched breath escapes Steve as he opens his mouth, tentative but always so precise, lips caressing Tony’s in soft strokes; a moment to part before diving back in again, the caresses growing longer as Steve’s tongue works between his lips. Steve kisses him lightly, taking his time, the way he had when the eagerness of their very first kiss had faded and Steve was rolled beneath Tony, all hitching gasps into Tony’s mouth as he turned to putty in Tony’s hands.
“Well, I’m not the one here asking for your help, am I?”
The tight reins Tony has on his emotions uncurl and slip from his grasp. “How am I ever going to be happy without you?” Tony demands, muffled into Steve’s shoulder, clenching the hand that isn’t tangled in Steve’s hair into a fist pressed into his shoulder blade. “How could you do this to me. You promised me. You
Even as the words leave his mouth, they’re a lie.
“I—I just wanted you to know that if you needed someone to talk to—”
. Right there, honey, please.” Tony shivers when Steve reaches between them, curling his left hand around Tony’s cock just to watch the glint of his wedding ring as little pearls of white slip from the tip and wet his fingers. “I knew. Oh,
“Steve?”
“What’s he been doing?” Tony asks, as much to himself as to JARVIS.
“No, but, felt better.”
“God, yes, just like that—no,
The gloves had been a gag Christmas gift Natasha had brought to their first gift exchange when the original Avengers had moved into the Tower. They were bright purple, fuzzy, with a big, glaring Hulk face on the back of each hand, much to Bruce’s chagrin.
There’s one small comfort.
He loathes to think why Steve would want to alter that memory.
Peter cracks a smile but moves on. “Where are you going?”
for tonight. Wasn’t well enough for tonight.
There’s something in him nagging at him that Tony will trust him if he tells him. He could tell him, hell, maybe he
It’s not until they’re both panting and Tony’s barreling towards the edge that Steve speaks again.
He presses the door open and peers inside. Tony is leaning against the Deere, not a tool in sight with the plaid shirt pulled back up over his shoulders. He looks even more ragged than when they’d fought earlier, and Steve steels himself for the worst.
Heart pounding of his chest and into his throat, Tony darts into the elevator and mashes the button for the lower level, snapping at FRIDAY to override any other requests to avoid delays, not that he anticipates anyone else to be awake at this hour.
“Can you just give me five minutes, you pig-headed asshole?” The mask of cool detachment wavering. He smirks at the insult as she unruffles her feathers and picks up the pieces of her composure.
Maybe he’s a glutton for punishment after all, or Pepper is right and this is some form of self-flagellation because Tony’s forgotten how to feel anything unless Steve is there flaying him open. Maybe he just can’t bear to be the one who walks away, again.
Peter swings through the air, unsteady as the webbing attaches to the bottom of one of the airborne aliens and is abruptly sliced through. The whole scene happens in slow motion. Tony, reaching for the gauntlet, hand outstretched as Peter intercepts him, dodging through the fray.
Everything else is fuzzy behind Steve, but it feels familiar. Maybe they’re in their bedroom in the Tower, sinking into the oversized mattress.
“A weighted blanket. We can order you a heavier one, if you wanted. They’re supposed to correlate with your body weight, or at least that’s what FRIDAY says, and I’m sure the whole super soldier thing means that you’d actually benefit from something that was a little heavier than that. Or next time you could pile a couple more on, maybe? But like, don’t smother yourself because that’s absolutely not the point. Unless you’re in that kind of mood, I guess, no judgement. Been there.”
“Sure, Bucky.” Steve smiles at the floor, forcing the muscles in his cheeks into the unfamiliar position. “Whatever you gotta do.”
Tony thrusts up, driving into him. “Answer me, damn it.”
“I’m listening, Tony. You’re saying that Bucky knows himself best, even though he hardly knows what day it is some days, and he still wakes up on rainy mornings thinking he still needs to take me out because I’m his target again. But I should trust what he says and if he doesn’t want to be an Avenger so that must be the right answer. I should take him at his word because it’s beyond the realm of possibility that maybe Bucky doesn’t know his own mind right now. Maybe he needs a little hand. Some support to head in the right direction.” As Steve speaks, his face grows darker and darker until he’s glowering, teeth sliding against each other in a harsh whine that makes Tony wince.
“Bruce, no, you won’t survive a second time!” Tony’s blasting through the sky, a beautiful streak of red and gold against the grey horizon.
“So why bother sending them?”
“Tony?” Bruce says, back to human and soft-spoken from behind Steve’s shoulder.
“I’m not doing this. No, Steve. I took a turn. I took a lot of turns. I took so many turns I don’t have an arm now! Why would you—how could you volunteer me for something like this without even asking me?”
Tony flicks a lazy look of disdain in her direction.
The same hands that had held Tony down tonight and
After Tony has said goodbye to Rhodey, his suitcase stowed away in the town car that will take him to the private airfield, he checks out of the hotel and makes one last stop.
Nothing could have prepared himself for this.
Tony falls onto the mattress, tugging Steve down until he’s covering Tony from head to toe, soaking up every point of contact his body can find. The hair on Tony’s calves rasp against his thigh as Tony wraps a leg around Steve’s hip and the arc reactor bites sharply into his chest.
Tony’s hands work to have Steve equally as bare, shoving and pulling until they join Tony’s clothing in a heap beside the bed. Tony touches every inch he can get his hands on, caressing the barely noticeable ripples between Steve’s ribs and biting down on one of Steve’s nipples until he’s panting, groaning his pleasure into the dark.
“Buck.” Steve’s voice cut him off, quiet and firm as the doors to the workshop swishing closed behind them.
He kisses him, and keeps kissing him, until Tony has him backed up against the far wall, the suit bearing all of his weight as he wraps his legs around Tony’s hips and holds on.
Steve glances up, uncertain. A curl of uneasy anticipation winds itself through his chest and squeezes.
“Tony?” Steve rasps.
Bucky rolled his eyes, the sucker, and pushed off the couch to refill their mugs. “Coulda just asked, Stevie.”
and see Steve’s massive arms wrapped around her small, sleeping frame. On those days, he stays away until the pain fades into the background and he can breathe again.
“I won’t be held accountable to anything that happens after they get here,” Tony bites out and Ross, who’s already walking away, pauses halfway to the door and turns to look over his shoulder.
“I didn’t—”
Steve in the back of his mind as he reached for it, cracking open the door and letting the toe-curling pleasure of Steve’s hot mouth radiate back into his own mind.
As quickly as it comes it fades, leaving a lingering sensation of pitiful desperation that makes Tony want to retch again.
“L–let’s go back to the Compound instead.” When Tony goes to protest, Peter straightens his shoulders with a false confidence Tony remembers from his own youth. “The rest of them will stay for a while. Let’s play video games or something. Order a pizza. You wanna see the new Death Star Ned and I finished putting together?”
Tony hums, noncommittal, and glances towards the box of donuts, wondering how rude it would be to reach in and take one. The conversation made him feel uneasy and he wants to go back to hating each other, just to avoid it.
“Before. Yeah, before.” Tony huffed an exhale, a maimed laugh shot through with something that made his next words feel like cruelty. “When I trusted you.”
Lifting back the sheets, Steve crawled back into the bed with a shiver, curling onto his side where he could still see the sun.
When Tony’s grip slipped down to his hips and yanked, thrusting up against the hollow where Steve’s hip met his groin, his brain effectively powered down. He broke the kiss on a gasp which did nothing to stop Tony’s mouth from where it traded off and started pressing hot, wet kisses along his jaw. The kisses travelled lower still, down his throat, almost to his clavicle.
“So, Pep wants to come up again in a few weeks. Do you mind?” Tony asks, eyes trained on the sizzle of vegetables. “Happy’s not going to be able to make it this time around, and Rhodey’s still doing whatever it is he’s doing these days.”
Tony jolts awake.
As Steve walked into the now-foreign space of their bedroom he struggled to shake the feeling that he was a trespasser here. The sound of his breath was too loud in the quiet expanse of the room. After so many weeks in Wakanda he hadn’t been sure what to expect when he’d returned to the Compound, but relief washed over him in slow, stunted waves.
The air thins around them and Tony climbs, desperately, firing a laser through the ship’s outer layers until he’s pushed through into some kind of access chamber or a vent. Whatever it is, it doesn’t matter because FRIDAY has calculated it and Tony
Tony does what any mentor-slash-father-figure would do and yanks the boy into a hug, holding him tightly as he shudders and shakes through the memory. He shushes him gently, running a hand over his back. It’s fucked them both up more than he cares to admit, and he could kill Steve for that, really.
Was it still that? Bucky couldn’t remember how long it’d been now, but he was sure he’d apologized, repeatedly, and offered a slew of reassurances both serious and when he was buried to the hilt inside of the O, singing his praises. Sighing, frustrated, Bucky let the weights slam down against the mat and enjoyed the way they landed with a dull thud.
“Us. I thought that that would be enough to at least get us talking again.” Steve sighs and runs a hand through his hair, tipping his head back to look up at the ceiling before his eyes slowly skate back down to Tony’s. “I didn’t figure it out for a long time after. The longer I didn’t hear from you, the angrier I got. The more resentment built up.”
“It’s almost time.” Pepper’s hand slides across his shoulder and he realizes he’s glaring holes into the back of Steve’s suit.
Bucky’s words stay with him, torturing him in a completely different way. This terrifying man who doesn’t know Tony from Adam and has no reason to have his back, has had it anyways. Twice now, not that he’s counting.
He thought maybe Tony’s efforts to have their pardons pushed through had meant something and when the news had broken that the World Security Council was preparing to vote. He had expected to hear from Tony then.
They’ve been apart longer than they’ve been together now, and Tony thinks about the number of times he’s seen Steve fall apart. He can count them on one hand, hold them like little glass figurines because they’re just as precious, all these times Steve has fallen apart over Tony. As if he matters more than anything else in the world. As if he just can’t help himself.
“Natasha,” Steve gasped when he could bear it, curling his fists around nothing and fighting to see her through a fresh curtain of tears that swam before his eyes. “Natasha, please don’t let them take him.”
“Yeah, no, we’re not going to do that.” Steve jumps and jerks towards the sound of Tony’s voice, grunting at the fresh wave of pain.
Tony had been thinking of Bruce when he’d designed it, painting one of the walls in a mural to the Redwood forests that Bruce was so fond of. He had pictured Bruce in here many times since Ultron, folded into crossed legs, eyes closed, head leaned back on the painted wall while he meditated. Sometimes Natasha was there too, collapsing in on herself in a complicated yoga pose.
Steve glanced up to the shut door before he looked down and took in the sight of the Iron Man puppet curled around his cock and shuddered. Humiliation searing across his chest in a striking red flush and he tried to ignore it.
“No, shut up.” He rounds on Steve, who looks shocked and dismayed, arms protective over his chest where he crosses them. Tony knows the feeling. Armour comes in many forms. “You always seem to know exactly what to say, and sometimes I wonder if you just say what you have to just to get what you want. You’re good at it. Pepper’s good at it too, but it’s been a long time since she used it on me.”
“Tony, oh god.” Something presses against his forehead, the unburnt side of his face. Thin hands, delicate fingers. The brush of long hair against his cheek. Tony smiles because Pepper’s always been the one to be there. She’s never let him down before.
Forever two steps forward, Steve takes one step back. Sometimes he doesn’t take any steps, he just vents and blames. When he justifies it makes Tony’s chest ache, every word a tiny shield to the arc reactor. But for the most part, Tony learns that over the last year Steve has gone through something of a self-discovery.
“I’m okay now, Steve.” Tony says, voice soft.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Sure thing, Katniss, I’m the epitome of domesticated bliss.”
“Shh, don’t ruin it.” Steve’s already ruined it, when he raised the shield over his head and—
None of this has ever been about Barnes. Steve just chooses not to believe it. How can he? When abandoning that train of thought would force Steve to face the realities of his trespasses against him.
“Me? Why do I have to make this so difficult?” Oh, there he goes, his voice is jumping up a few octaves and the discomfort in his chest is slowly building into throbbing agony.
“I’ve wanted you since the day I met you,” Steve says honestly, twisting his fingers with Tony’s.
Reset.
“Help him!” Tony screamed into the storm, the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives rushing towards them. Natasha’s shock of red hair came into view, shoving through the pandemonium. She was on them in a second, fingers at Steve’s throat to feel for his pulse. Then the heels of her hands were pounding on his chest in a quick, steady rhythm and she breathed for him.
With Steve’s hand wrapped tight around his cock, Tony came again, shifting as Steve’s knot swelled and locked them together, expanding deep in his ass and filling him to the brim.
Except he is.
Tony had never told a soul about that night at the Compound, and neither would he.
“Love you too, Cap. Always.”
It was a rare sight, seeing him in full regalia, sharpened by the crisp lines and muted chrome finish of the braces. His presence is a quiet command at any given moment.
“Tony, come on. Stop talking in riddles and just come out with it. Why are you doing this?”
The glitter of his wedding ring catches Steve’s attention, and suddenly the anticipation dissolves into something different, something more significant. He swallows hard, the prickle of tears in his eyes because this is his husband.
“Punk.”
“You’re losin’ it, Steve. You’re supposed to be the sane one of the two of us, but you’re—this stuff ain’t real. You’re living in a fantasy down here and that’s only going to end in more hurt.”
“He appears to have been relieving himself, Sir. The Winter Soldier reached sexual climax shortly after you and the Captain—”
When Tony glances back towards the edge of the building, Barnes is gone, stolen away into the night and Tony’s left reeling with a half-hard cock twitching against his thigh and adrenaline coursing through his veins.
The jumble of thoughts that follow simultaneously gut him and rip him to shreds, because it’s blatantly obvious, isn’t it? Steve’s probably working through memories of their time together so it doesn’t hurt so much. So, he can move on from whatever this was. Not initially how he’d intended B.A.R.F. to be used, but if Steve wants to use it to erase him–them–so be it.
“It’s okay. I’m sorry, it’s okay,” Tony had grunted, voice muffled as Bucky squeezed his breath away between the metal fingers. “My fault. You’re okay. You’re okay, Barnes.”
“You’re insatiable.” Tony breaths, clinging to him.
Something is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong.
The irony is not lost on Tony in the slightest.
“What is it?”
“I’m not going to apologize for that,” Tony clenches his jaw so tight the words slipped through like gritty pieces of sand, grinding against his enamel as they pass through. He wants to say ‘you weren’t here, you don’t know what it was like’ but he doesn’t need to defend himself. “I won’t apologize for being human.”
Something cold and dark takes over in Steve’s belly, a tight fist wrapped around his insides, squeezing. The words are out of his mouth before he can stop himself. “Kids won’t bring Peter back, Tony.”
Gasping, trying to draw deep heavy breaths around
“Seriously, nothing?” Tony scoffs, and gives him a pitiful look, shaking his head as his lips press into a grim line. “I thought we had just established that Steve Rogers can choose whether or not he’s going to be a coward.”
“Tony,” Steve cuts him off and Tony’s head shoots up, surprised. “I really love you.”
“Alpha, Bucky – Bucky please, please bite me. I want it. Fuck me, baby please, give it to me. Want it. Want you. Bucky? Bucky –
doing here?”
“So much, Tony.”
. Steve wants to vomit. He wants to scream.
Steve blinks.
But he wants him and he wants him because…
He’s not ready. This can’t be real. It can’t be real because it’s too soon. There’s still more he has to do, people he has to look after. It has to be a mistake.
Not that what Steve wants is of any consequence. The circumstances of his dreams may always be different, but the storyline remains the same.
Tony tries not to, really, he does, but what’s the point?
“I should just be grateful he’s finally leaving me alone.”
“Fuck, you’re right.” The giggle that escapes him sounds hysterical and it’s not a far cry from how he’s starting to feel.
“Not for much longer.”
“This is what you wanted, right Steve? You wanted to fuck until it feels better. Does it feel better?” Tony’s voice is a hiss between his teeth, hands scrambling at Steve’s back as Steve straightens, sliding backward with Tony in his arms until he’s pressed against the headboard and Tony is sitting tall astride his lap. It gives Tony more leverage, and Steve helps him fuck down harder and harder until it starts to blur into a searing pain deep in Tony’s belly.
They haven’t talked about what was said a few days ago. They haven’t talked about the letters, or the fact that Steve still hasn’t left the hospital grounds, and they certainly haven’t talked about the fact that when the visiting hours end and Tony’s streamline of guests dries up, Steve curls up in Tony’s hospital bed and holds him until morning.
“It was nothing, Mr. Stark, really. I hardly said anything.” The flush on his face and the way he ducks his head don’t corroborate his story.
It just so happened to be the night Tony came stumbling in drunk, having missed dinner altogether, marking a choice remark about Irish brothels that made Steve blush to the tips of his ears.
To love another kid—to
The guilt Steve had experienced when he started having a “
“Is Tony here?” Steve asks, eager even though he already knows the answer.
There had been a glimmer of something in the first letter. An almost genuine apology, closer than Steve had ever gotten before and because Tony didn’t read the rest of the letters, he lets himself believe that Steve was getting there.
The first snow was starting to fall.
It’s when Tony realizes he hasn’t heard the ding of the elevator doors that it occurs to him Peter’s been held up. He can see him, but not hear him, just on the other side of the threshold talking to Steve. They have a quick exchange that Tony can’t make out, but Steve’s face, turned towards Parker, is tense and carefully blank.
Somehow, two of the deadliest assassins he knows, both well equipped with excellent poker faces, can’t even fake it for two minutes to cut him some slack.
It’s almost too easy to agree with him, because Rhodey has this reasonable, level way about him that Tony has always envied. He sees the world in vivid shades of greys, where Tony oscillates between stark white and pitch black. Polarized.
When sleep finally does come, it’s black and all-consuming.
Steve groans. “I want to, god Tony, I want to.” More kisses, then, “but we should talk. We should wait. Talk first, then go upstairs. This is part of the problem isn’t it–we don’t talk, we do this, we, oh God–” He’s losing the battle; Tony can already feel his resolve slipping away in the little gasps escaping his mouth between kisses. “God, I don’t want to fuck this up.”
Some of the blankets had tangled around Tony’s ankles, snaking over one of his hips and otherwise leaving him bare. The smooth porcelain of his back curved into the pert slope of his backside and Steve could have stood there for hours, watching the rhythmic pattern of his breathing.
“No shit. Congratulations! When’s the big day?”
Sometimes, the way Steve clings to him even in sleep makes him worry. Steve hides it well enough, but there’s something deeper hiding just beneath the surface; something that scars Steve in a way he hasn’t been willing to admit.
Peter all but beams up at him.
By the end he’s crying, head in his hands, the letters folded along their creases and set in a neat pile back on the table.
And it’s not that he’s all that jealous. He knows that Bucky and Tony would never—of course, he knows that.
Tony flinches when he realizes that Steve’s hand is back on his cock and when he tries to shove it away again, Steve grips him tighter. Somehow it both makes him jerk and staves off the fast-approaching orgasm.
Look at the PTSD-riddled alcoholic, everyone!
He won’t, so it’s no use thinking about. Tony can’t wait forever for something that isn’t going to come. They’re divorced for a reason. An important one, when he has enough space to remember what the ambiguous perspective deigns to tell him on a good day.
Steve quirks a smile, “if that’s what you want.”
“How can you be so sure?”
“—if nothing changes. You want to apologize for beating me half to death Steve? Start fucking listening. To anyone, I don’t care if you never listen to me again. Listen to someone. Do some self-reflection or whatever the quacks call it. I don’t know, Steve. Fucking grow.” Tony waves an ambivalent hand between them which is an instant mistake because they both clock the way his fingers are trembling, violent spasms running up and down the length of his arm.
Steve frowns. It doesn’t seem like Tony is being intentionally cryptic and his eyes search Steve’s as if he’s looking for answers. If he is, surely Tony must know by now—Steve is all out of answers. He’s been out of answers for years.
“Are you taking requests?” Natasha inquired, “because I have a fantastic recipe for cabbage rolls, I’ve never been able to get right.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve is two minutes, too late. As always.
The nurse gave him another long look, before she pressed her lips together in something Steve had come to recognize as a sympathy that bordered on pity. She nodded slowly, and when it was clear she wasn’t leaving, Steve sighed again and pushed himself out of the bed. Zipping up his hoodie, Steve folded the blankets back into their perfect corners over the mattress.
“I’m sorry, but I think you must be mistaken. I don’t remember signing anything that said I work for you, now.” Tony snaps.
Bucky’s teasing voice broke through and Steve flushed, heat splattering across his cheeks, which only made Bucky’s smirk widen into a wolfish grin. “Care to share with the class?”
Tony smiles, a broken thing. “You need to want to do this for you. And I can’t wait forever, Steve. You keep wanting me to fix this for you and God, you have no idea how much I wish I could. But I can’t. Stop asking me.”
“Peter, get the gauntlet!”
“Never fixed anything with sex, Steve.”
Peter seems to accept it, and as Tony leads him back out of the workshop and up to the communal floor, FRIDAY notifies them that the food has just arrived and the team is assembling for dinner. Pete rambles on about new features he’s been thinking up for his suit and Tony promises to add them all.
He wants Tony to fuck the living daylights out of him, hold him down and take whatever he wants by way of penance then wrap his arms around him and never let Steve go.
Tony shakes his head. “It’s nothing. Probably nothing. I don’t think I ever told you what Wanda showed me, but back when she scrambled my brains, she showed me a vision of something coming. Like the Chitauri but worse. I saw it again, but it felt like a warning. It feels like something bigger is still out there.”
“Yeah, of course.”
Steve waits for the regret to set in, staring at Tony as if he’s seeing him for the very first time, but it doesn’t come.
“Go.”
“There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you.” The words catch in his throat and he rolls his shoulders back, looking for some shred of confidence and feeling empty. “There’s no excuse, I shouldn’t have waited so long but I thought—”
“You lied to him,” Bucky says. “You never told him what I did to his parents, and then when the Accords happened, you fought. He left you after that. He married Pepper and they had their little girl. That’s what was real, Steve.”
Tony ran Rhodey through the sequencing protocols slowly and purposefully, letting Rhodey practice interrupting the system which was the more significant responsibility, in the event of something going wrong. He fielded a few wayward questions, before they were calling it an afternoon and Tony suggested a round through the massage chairs in the self-care room before they returned to the daily grind.
there just waiting for him.
Pleasure starts to curl again, lead in his stomach as Steve folds him in half, angling deeper until he finds Tony’s sweet spot over and over. There’s a steady stream of desperate little moans that Tony realizes belong to him, and he feels himself start to unravel around the edges. Release hangs just beyond reach and it’d be so easy to float away on it.
“Yeah I hear that but, I mean, things haven’t been easy and I’m sure I’m the last person that you would want to talk to about this kind of thing anyway. But I wanted you to know that it’s okay. If you did want to talk, I mean. I’d listen. I can be… people.” Peter stumbles over the words but forces out every one, then steals another glance up to Tony’s face to gauge his reaction. Has Tony ever met another person in this world as pure and as giving as Peter Parker?
“Tony, please, can’t we just talk about this?” Steve was practically begging, his face a painful mask contorted with longing and sadness, and a desperate love so intense Bucky felt almost uncomfortable sitting in the same room.
“Tony, no I don’t think–”
He can still hear him, as clear as ever, with the hum of the reactor in his ear and the soft beams of light cutting between his eyelashes.
tried to give him exactly what he wants. How can he not see that?
“Something’s happened. I want to understand this, Tony, I do. Can you explain it to me?”
Steve’s mouth runs as dry as the Sahara. “You mean—”
“Tony?” Steve tries again. He lays a hand on Tony’s shoulder to pull him into his arms. They have to tend to the others. They have to account for the dead. They have to—
But it’s more than that.
He doesn’t do a great job of it.
No, he thinks, it’s not perfect. But it could be. One day, maybe.
They should have done this months ago, rebuilt their bond.
“Steve,” she whispered, helplessly. “Come here.”
Tony snorts. “Don’t be like that J, you’ve heard what they said. This is a necessity. Captain Tightass and good ol’ eye-patch have practically called for this in writing. I’m just doing them a favour.”
“That’s nice, I really don’t give a fuck. I didn’t do it for you.”
“That doesn’t prove anything. It’s just a theory. A nice theory, but still just a theory. And even if you were right, what then? If he’s a kid, he can’t join the team.”
There had been a time once where Tony would have gone to the end of the earth to protect Steve from anything. From everything. Hurting him now won’t make a difference. It only makes Tony ache to soothe him, to smooth away the stinging barbs he’s embedded under Steve’s skin.
“We’re together,” Steve says, not taking his eyes off Tony though he’s speaking to the rest of them. Tony smiles up at him, and it feels remarkably good to claim him, here, in front of their friends. Their family. Then he adds, softer, “I’m in love with him.”
The chest piece is glowing bright, and though there is a massive concave dent in the back of the suit, it doesn’t appear to impair Tony’s ability to fly or fight. Tony doesn’t respond, the eyes of the Iron Man suit glowing back at him as Tony dodges past Steve and blasts another alien dropping from the sky.
Strange, what Barnes has come to understand in such a short time while Steve continues to lay his hands over his eyes and claim that he’s blind. And how ironic it would be, if that’s what it takes. Steve’s good old buddy from the past, the driving force of change when Tony has been there all along.
“Oh god.” Steve drags a hand over his face, resisting the surge of heat to the back of his neck. “Stop, this is too much. There needs to be some sort of rule around how much time you two spend together without me.”
With Tony’s arms wrapped tightly around him, he can’t imagine he’d ever have a reason to stop.
have no idea,” Tony snaps, eyes flashing but the simmering heat behind his words is abruptly lost in a hiss of pain.
He knows exactly what Bucky’s going to say, and he can almost hear the reaction. In hindsight, maybe not his best moment?
So, on that first night, Steve held Tony close, curled around him as much as he could and listened as his breathing lengthened and Tony drifted off into a peaceful sleep. Hours passed and Steve ran his hand up and down the length of Tony’s back until his fingers were numb, ignoring his growing arousal until his cock was heavy and weeping with anticipation.
Tony wrapped his hand around Steve’s wrist and felt the suit squeal under the weight, dragging them both down. Water was spilling in through the cracks in the arm and ice speared through his extremities.
“Stevie, take a step back, punk. You knew better than that.” Barnes grunts, shooting Tony a flat look.
Steve sniffled, coughing around the sear in his chest and nudged closer to Tony, searching through the pile of blankets for his warm to see if he might find a few more hours of rest. He reached over to sling an arm around Tony’s waist and draw him in, to press his face into the side of Tony’s throat where he might still smell of spice and expensive cologne.
Steve leaned over him and sucked the head of his cock into his mouth and he clawed back his orgasm with fierce desperation. There were too many hands, too many tongues and he could
“I don’t really blame you. I didn’t mean that.” It’s an abdication Steve doesn’t deserve.
Maybe it’s alright if Steve hurts him from time to time.
When Tony shuddered again, a grotesque, full body roll, and moaned Steve’s name, Steve’s heart ached for him. The decision almost felt as if it were being made for him. He couldn’t just let Tony suffer, trapped in whatever horrors danced in his mind.
He hasn’t been with anyone else. But he doesn’t want any part of Steve to linger with him after this is finished.
Tony lifts one shaky hand to the back of Steve’s head. Even running his fingers through the hair on the nape of his neck feels like too great a task. “I love you, anyway.”
“I never want you to get rid of it.” Steve’s mouth was hot at his ear, breath teasing and tickling. “I love you.”
Tony grits his teeth, the urge to punch Steve a quick violence that rises and crests on a wave of resentment before shifting into something more.
another kid.
Home. The word shoots through him, setting off pleasant little alarms in his brain.
“Always together,” Tony whispered back, squeezing him tight. “I love you so much.”
Tony offers Steve a sad smile and spreads his hands out in front of him, “because you’re here now.”
, I knew.”
“I don’t really like dancing, Bucky,” Peter gives a small frown and the reference lost in translation between the two generations has everyone laughing again.
And just like Maria, Tony had found his Howard and let that be his world for years. The thought is black and ugly, something heinous he shouldn’t be considering but the resemblance is startlingly familiar. The way that Steve never says he’s sorry, never apologies. The way that he thinks he’s better than Tony, than almost anyone, and one day everyone is going to wake up and realize he’s right, then thank him for it.
Steve blinks.
It was a near perfect depiction of the friendship Bucky and Tony had created, sprouting from the ashes of Siberia and having grown into something truly amazing.
“No, we don’t.”
Tony’s
They’ve failed.
“You’re not listening; that’s not how these things go,” Tony says, flapping the thick stack of papers in his face. He’s red-faced and angry, the hand not holding the Sokovia Accords package in a tight fist at his side.
But then he was scrambling away, taking the warmth of his body with him as he got tangled deeper into the sheets. Tony gasped and the horrified, broken noise shot through Steve’s chest like a bullet tearing through skin and bone.
Tony had seen red.
Anything Tony wants. Everything.
Steve picked up the pace, pumping his hips and tugging Tony back onto his cock with every brush forward. There was something deliciously forbidden about fucking Tony this way, his body reacting purely out of muscle memory, tightening and releasing without explicit permission and Steve felt his self-restraint splitting at the seams.
From this distance, Tony can’t make out his face, only a smear of pale skin hidden in shadows and the reflection of the moon glinting off the metal arm, exposed to the shoulder.
“Please,” Steve says again, letting the words spill out of him because Tony loves to hear him. Tony, the loud one, but over the years he’s learned exactly what makes Steve squirm and gasp until the pleas are spilling from his lips.
That was before, back when Tony never had to put up a fight. Never had to question that Steve holding him down meant anything more than overwhelming pleasure.
“Don’t ever let him go, Steve,” Peggy had said, a papery hand covering his. “Love him, marry him, whatever you want. But don’t ever let him go.”
Just the gentle touch, a light stroke of his fingers up and down Tony’s back, was enough for his body to stop struggling. Emboldened, Steve brought one knee to the mattress, half kneeling at Tony’s side and ran his other hand through Tony’s hair to brush it back from his face.
Even now, Steve expects him to have the answers.
“I love you. You fucking bastard, you didn’t even give me a chance to say it back.”
Everything that came after he’d let go of Tony’s hand in the sky was a blur, nothing more than a series of flashes pieced together against the backdrop of the night sky. A streak of red and gold chasing him down, his back searing with pain as he hit the water. The familiar fear of being trapped under the ice as water flooded into his lungs once more.
Lang, she supplies, is visiting with his daughter for the evening, and Rogers has been called away on an independent mission. Somehow, even that irks him, because this whole thing was about being ready and prepared for an invasion and Steve thinks he can just fuck off to god knows where whenever he likes?
It’s not fair. Nothing is fair, and this is supposed to feel good, damn it.
“What’s this for?” Barnes’ brows knit together and Tony offers him a media-worthy smile.
When Tony doesn’t reply, Rhodey runs a hand across the short-cropped hair on the top of his head, drawing attention to the silver that lines his temples more and more every day. How many of those grey hairs are because of him?
“You– why did you–”
“Don’t say it.” Tony grumbled, refusing to open his eyes.
It’s a low blow, and Rhodey had known it, because Tony won’t drag him into this if he doesn’t have to. He’s outright refused, and Peter deserves a bit of rest after all he’s been through. Not to mention he’s a child. A child that has asked to take a step back.
“I believe you, but you always say the same thing.”
His best friend is
Steve had marched straight into Tony’s workshop at the Compound, spun him around to plant his hands between flowing rivers of wire and tugged his pants down, savouring the way Tony panted out his name while he gasped into the unforgiving metal worktable.
Steve puts a hand on his shoulder, but his stomach does little triple loops while they wait.
“You say that now, but Tony I remember the look on your face. The way you couldn’t bear to be near me afterward. If we’re going to try—”
Steve yanks at his hips, closing the distance between them and drawing a groan out of the back of Tony’s throat. Steve is rock hard between them, thrusting light against him so they roll and slide together. A familiar rhythm in an unfamiliar room and an unfamiliar not-marriage.
Steve will probably remember forever, the lucky bastard, because one moment they’re trying to sleep, Tony’s hand tangled in the hair at the back of Steve’s neck as Steve’s warm breath flares around the reactor, and the next they’re kissing.
“I’m yours.” Tony’s voice is wrecked and scratchy, and
Bucky grunted softly, surprised but not enough to shove Tony away. When he opened his mouth, letting Tony’s tongue slip between his teeth he heard Steve gasp behind him and he yanked back, eyes wide with alarm. What the fuck was he thinking?
Bucky fretted for the better part of the afternoon as it turned into evening, fluttering and pacing in a way Steve hadn’t seen since, well, before the war. It wasn’t unlike the way Bucky would worry after him when the winter months set in and pneumonia threatened around every corner.
“You’re going to push everyone away, Steve. You’re going to push everyone away and there’s going to be nothing left. You’ll never learn. You’ll never fucking change—”
“How old are you, man?”
Steve frowned. “Wait, your
Ross can get fucked.
“I would love nothing more than to move past all the blame. If he actually apologized, maybe. I don’t even know if that’s what it’s about.”
There’s the briefest sensation of Steve’s palm covering the arc reactor but he can’t feel the tips of his fingers lost around the edges.
“What’s this really about, dollface? You don’t need to fit some cookie cutter mold of what “Omega ' should be. And what’s so wrong with a fella showin’ his mates how happy they make him and givin’ ‘em such a thoughtful little gift?”
“Tony.” Steve’s fingers drifted along the edge of his shirt, tightening slightly when his face morphs from a splatter of surprise to hopeful shock. “I love you.”
Tony hadn’t even realized that Steve was back from his latest secret one-manned mission, when FRIDAY alerts him to an emergency the following night.
God, doesn’t he know it?
Bucky gasped. “Steve I can feel you–”
Tony reaches up to brush a hand through his hair but before it touches him, it twitches and falls away. “St—”
The tension in his chest releases, if only marginally.
“Cutting it close, babe.” Tony taps a finger against his cheek and pads across the room to root through the heap of clothes for his boxers. Strips of fabric from where Steve has literally torn his clothes off his body make him groan, exaggerated for Steve’s amusement.
So maybe this Tony does remember. Steve doesn’t quite know what to make of that.
The sheets crinkle as he shifts, brittle and paper-thin, and Tony slides over to the side of the mattress making what room he can in the meager space. It’s heartbreaking to see Steve this way, just a shell of the man he knew.
“You said we’d do it together. Always together. You said—that’s what you said, Steve!”
Someone’s drugged him. They must have had to sedate him even though that never lasts for long and doing it now feels selfish. Steve already knows there isn’t enough sedation in the world to take away the pain of
“JARVIS? What exactly is the Avalon Protocol? Tony’s okay, right? He’s just unconscious or something? Release the suit and I'll carry him over to the med tent.”
“I didn’t mean to make anything worse. I swear, Mr. Stark. I just wanted–you’re always looking out for everyone else and I just–I wanted to make sure you knew that I had your back. After King T’Challa brought you back…” Peter chokes off as the air sticks in his lungs. “I don’t ever want to see you like that again.”
“That’s what you want, right sweetheart? For everyone to know you’re mine?”
Steve should have known he’d be behind some of this. All of this.
There was a pregnant pause that left Steve’s eyebrows resting along his hairline. “No…” Pepper seemed to choose her words carefully. “I have not heard from him, but I’d be willing to guess that he’s going to be home later tonight. Maybe tomorrow morning.”
And Steve, telling Barnes he could do it. That this is what they’ve been working towards. That Steve will be right there to help him through it and didn’t he know that he could do anything he set his mind to with a little help from his good old pal.
“Cut him some slack, he’s doin’ the best he can.”
“Goddamn it,” Steve snaps, tearing at the webbing over his eyes.
The motor oil is still shimmering against his cheek and Steve’s fingers twitch at his side, restless with the urge to rub it away. If Tony makes light of this, the scaffold around Steve’s heart will fold and Steve’s not strong enough for that. He’s not.
“Steve I–” Steve covers his mouth lightly with his palm to still him and then replaces it with a short, chaste kiss.
Steve considered it. “Maybe, I’m really not sure Buck.”
Tears streak down his face and he can’t stop grinning. Tony
“Get out.”
“Together,” Steve murmurs.
Steve blinks.
Tony collects the pieces of his resolve and shoves them into place. “This did not mean more to you than it did to me. And you’re an asshole for saying it.”
“Tony. Tony, it’s just a nightmare. Come on, wake up.”
that.
“You’re not in charge here, ‘mega.”
He was going to drown. He
“Tony…” Steve’s hands flutter at his sides and Tony watches out of the corner of his eyes as Steve rests his hands at his back, then brings them forward to settle at his hips, then clutching the top of his belt. Anything to avoid crossing his arms, he realizes a moment later, and Tony wonders who taught Steve that trick. Sam, probably. Or Barnes, in his effort to look like a less threatening goat herder.
So, when Tony had come striding into the Tower earlier today, exuding a confidence he didn’t feel only a month after he’d last been in New York, it had shocked him to find Steve and Barnes at odds. Barnes, in the middle of telling Steve to back off and that he hadn’t agreed to this, wasn’t
Actually, it’s worse than that, because the explosion of guilt across his features implies that Steve is currently thinking about how
A ripple of uncertainty races over his skin, leaving him chilled. Tony’s got everything figured out. He’s looking right past the smoke and mirrors and reaching out to wrap his fist around the very core of Steve’s being.
. Except no one knew he had the burner to begin with and the unspoken expectation was that he’d call T’Challa anyways. The burner phone is just the dirty little secret he shares with the wet marks on his pillows.
“You love this tie,” Steve curls his hand over Tony’s again, linking their fingers together, and Tony yanks his hand back, pulling off and finally looking up to meet Steve’s eyes. Intimacy is the absolute last thing Tony wants, but seeing the concern in Steve’s gaze momentarily catches him off guard.
“That was–”
“No, Pepper, I’m not okay. My husband destroyed our marriage and I’m here all alone trying to put the pieces back together without drinking or offing myself. Stop asking me if I’m okay.” He flicks at crumbs on the futon.
“He’s too good for me, Rhodey,” Tony says. “He’s everything that’s good in this world, and how do I live up to that? How can I live up to that for the rest of our lives together?”
He got a little more than a slice of that life Tony was always telling him about, and when he looks back at the chapters of his life, the paragraphs are growing shorter and every sentence has a period.
The photo is the two of them, soaring through the sky above Malibu. Steve is wrapped up in all of Tony, arms around his neck, legs trapped between the strong lines of the Iron Man armour. It’s nothing compared to what it could’ve been.
“You can. I know you can. You’ve got people, Steve. Sam, Barnes. Just listen, okay? Listen.” Tony has to stop, because he’s already dangerously close to begging and who cares about politics and card games anymore.
Steve pressed Tony down onto his back and captured his lips, tongue dipping inside and tracing the cavern of his mouth where he tasted himself. There was a valiant twitch between his thighs that Steve took as an invitation to paw at him, grasping him loose in one oversized hand to stoke the embers of arousal in his belly back to a roaring, screaming fire.
“Coulson designed it,” Tony corrects. “But I’m going to improve it. First things first, no goddamn buckles. And tighter pants.”
“I… did not know that.” Rhodey is thoughtful from where he keeps a watchful eye on Tony’s breakfast. His stomach gives a loud gurgle but it doesn’t ease the tension he feels, even when Rhodey gives him a fond smile.
“Pepper,” Tony says with quiet amazement. “Pepper, you did it. You did it, honey.”
are missing?”
As he watches Tony sail through an intricate maneuver of dips and weaves, decimating the airborne aliens above, Steve focuses on the last remaining squadrons on the ground.
“I told him that I knew what he had done and that he should be ashamed of himself and that he’s lucky you’re even alive after Siberia, so he better stay away.”
“I failed, Tony.”
Tony laughed easily. “I hate fancy people food.”
mates? Except Tony’s fear was that it wouldn’t be that easy; that he’d somehow get stuck, partially bonded to only one of them because triads were rare and the research was vague, or even that Bucky might not even be able to bond at all and be left behind.
“Wouldn’t have had to be a battle if Cap hadn’t been so selfish,” Tony snaps.
“Y-Yes,” Steve croaks, letting go and dropping the hand holding him up from the couch to twine his fingers with the hand braced across his chest. Tony grunts from the pressure, taking all of Steve’s weight into his arms and landing hard with a knee on the sofa.
Tony was cold?
“I had been keeping secrets a long time before Ultron, Tony.”
Unlike all the other times, Tony doesn’t feel threatened. He doesn’t feel the need to suit up and knock Steve down a few pegs, or prepare for the figurative punch in the jaw that always follows the insults. No, Tony feels uncertain. Unstable. Steve is pulling the rug out from underneath him with little yanks, not enough force to unbalance him entirely, but just enough to leave him wobbling and reaching out to steady himself.
Tony glances at the car, and back at Peter. “I’m going to the airport. Gotta head back to the Coast. Board meetings and papers to sign, you know how it is.” Does Peter know how it is? Does Peter know that Tony’s lying out of his ass and that when he gets home he’ll work until he drops or down a bottle of liquor to the same end?
“More sleep for everyone!” Tony pulled the sheet up under his chin until it was draped across all three of them, and he was only a tuft of chocolate brown hair peeking out.
He owed him the entire world.
“Buck, don’t–”
“Of course I know that!” Tony balls his hands into fists and feels cold sweat break out across the back of his neck. “It doesn’t matter—”
Tony doesn’t offer placations or reassurances. He sits in the presence of their grief and breathes, as if it’s the easiest thing in the world. As if he somehow has learned to sift through all the sadness and let the days pass through him like a sieve. Steve watches his eyes drift over his shoulder, catching sight of the photograph still hanging in the kitchen.
, but sue him because that’d be worth looking into! “Sorry. Okay, that doesn’t sound so bad. That’s not all though, Cap’s taken worse–hell, I’ve said worse.”
“Bonding and breeding,” Steve pitched forward and wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, leaning over Bucky to tip his head up and capture Tony’s mouth. “Oh, sweetheart.”
But she never left. Not after the first black eye and the second sprained write. Not when Tony left for MIT and, from his standpoint, there was nothing left to stay for—not that staying for Tony’s sake was ever enough justification in his books. Maria had circled around Howard like he was the sun and she was caught in the orbit of his brilliance. Now, Tony simply wonders if she didn’t have the strength to go on living on her own. Married too young, with no family to speak of and a son thousands of miles away, it’s not a far cry to imagine why she stayed.
Tony chokes on a breath. “And you didn’t think to alert us sooner? I swear to God, JARVIS, I’m going to strip you down for parts and give your consciousness to DUM-E, don’t think I won’t—”
And god, how he had wanted.
“Like the sun shines out of your asshole.”
Steve looks at his team, watching the way the entire room holds its breath. He slips the hand on Tony’s back down around his waist and tugs him in, dropping his gaze to Tony’s mouth.
Steve thinks about Bucky, his eyes shining bright as he stood by Steve’s side and watched them promise to love each other for the rest of their days.
Tony strokes a hand through Steve’s hair and is rewarded with a soft smile. “Hey.”
Steve sucked at the gland on his throat, lapping and laving until Tony was squirming and closer to coming than he’d thought possible at this point in his life.
Tony smirked up at him tugging at his shirt to pull him over to the couch.
Steve makes his way down to the workshop slowly, savouring each step through the Tower. He lets his hand slide over the back of the oversized couch, rewarded with visions of Natasha and Clint piled onto Thor, all curled under a blanket with Bruce scribbling in a notebook at their feet. In his mind’s eye they’re all so young, finding meaning in place and family for the very first time.
With Tony’s hands on him, Steve can forget for just a little while.
Everything that had been there with Steve once is shoved into the back of his mind, trapped in the smallest box on the highest shelf. Why should he bother thinking about it all, anyhow?
It would be so easy to let him stay. To welcome him back into his bed, his arms, his life. Except nothing has changed, this is just Tony coasting along with the high of his endorphins. Sex never changes these things. It only hurts, and Steve knows how to hurt him just right.
“Of course, Boss.”
They shifted around him, Bucky curling behind him and pressed against him legs to chest with Steve at his front, nudging his head into his lap. A hand ran up and down his spine, another through his hair. It felt placating. It felt wonderful.
Tony’s arms are at his sides and one pinky is just within reach. Steve could nudge his hand over and touch it. One moment of softness in a sea of brutality.
They stand in the centre of the church until the storm in Steve’s chest passes. When he finally pulls away, Tony’s eyes are wet and red, and the kiss Tony plants on his lips is chaste but firm.
Steve jumps as Tony winds an arm around his waist, then lets himself sink into the embrace. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Jesus, Steve.” Tony’s eyes are wet and Steve reaches over to brush his fingertips at the creases, holding off on sharing how Morgan curls up against his chest and retells the fairy tales that Tony has told her through her childhood. “Warn a guy, would you? You’re really giving me some real emotional whiplash here.”
“Okay,” Tony repeats. “Well, I definitely wasn’t expecting—” He breaks off, shaking his head in disbelief. “Yeah. I love you, too. It’s always been you, Steve.”
telling
Tony bites out a laugh. “You don’t know when you became a bad guy to me? Honestly?” Tony shakes his head and shoves his shaking left hand into his pocket, leaning back against a jut from the wall right at hip level. “I wish you could hear yourself. How ridiculous you sound. The arrogance is just overwhelming.”
“Back the fuck up.”
“Why do you guys even bother?” Tony hears Clint ask as he’s halfway out the door. “It’s not like he’s ever going to put the effort in.”
It’s only been three months.
“And you just conveniently forgot to mention he was your boyfriend, did you?” Bucky prompted, finally taking a step back and leaning against the table. “I’m pretty sure there was more than enough time for that before I went back under, Steve.”
“What’s happening? What just happened?”
“Just go, Steve. Let’s not do this tonight.”
“I don’t appreciate you betting on my love life, Barnes.” Tony tosses him a fond smile over his shoulder anyway.
“I can’t, Boss.”
“There appears to be a combatant watching the Tower.”
Peter rolls his eyes. “Are you really okay? With him–them? Here?”
He doesn’t want to cry, damn it.
When Tony takes note of the papers and slaps them into order, Steve’s gaze snaps up. Tony sets the pile back down and there’s a warning behind his thick eyelashes. Steve doesn’t want to fight today if they can avoid it.
A second set of hands on his hips distracted him, and he pulled back to refocus his attentions when Tony’s mouth trailed along the side of his neck. Kissing Tony was a morning’s jolt of caffeine, setting his blood on fire and making him want to shift right out of his clothes.
He is tired. He’s so fucking exhausted. He’s lost in the woods and there’s no way to make it out of this unscathed.
“Not the sparring, Steve. This.” He gestures between them, and then it dawns on Steve like slow boiling water.
“Just for a while.”
They’d talked about this, maybe? They must have, because Tony felt Bucky’s mind cleared – how is that even possible? Tony’s still a puddle of post-orgasmic haze – and he shifted with purpose behind Steve, already hard again. Damned super soldier stamina.
When they finally separated again, they were breathing hard and there were effectively fewer thoughts - and a significantly less amount of blood - in Steve’s head than the first time.
“No, absolutely not,” Tony juts his chin up a notch, resisting the urge to glare at Ross over the top of his glasses. “You put in so much as a word about Sergeant Barnes serving any time and we’re out. We walk. It’s non-negotiable.”
It’s maddening and exhausting and it feels like there’s no escaping it. So, he does what he needs to, and goes through the motions when he can. He’s perpetually distracted.
“Let me go!” Tony spits, lashing out with one of his feet, trying to knock Steve off balance.
“Pay up, old man,” Peter quips.
Tony isn’t even looking at him. It’s only been days since he came clean, and Tony’s been rigid at best. They’ve been busy with the fallout from Sokovia, and though Tony comes to bed every other night, drained and exhausted; he no longer lets Steve pull him in. He lies there, stiff and visibly aching, refusing any source of comfort.
“You don’t know him better than he knows himself.”
life, scenting of dark, lush coffee, black as sin, with a mouth on him that made Steve flush like he was back in ‘44.
Tony sucks in a breath that must taste like deceit because his face contorts and he looks like he might spit in Steve’s face. “Before the surgery, then. You let me go under—you let them put me out, not knowing if I’d make it through and you never said—”
“Are you okay?”
It’s so predictable it’s almost disappointing, and if Steve can be predictable then maybe Tony can too. Before Steve opens his mouth, Tony leans forward and plucks a glass of champagne off a tray hoisted high by a passing waiter and gives him a thousand-watt smile.
“You didn’t promise him anything because it wasn’t
“This is real, right?” Steve asks, abruptly, swallowing around bursts of citrus. “I’m not imagining this. This is really our life now?”
When Steve’s cock bumps the back of his throat, Tony moans, sending a series of vibrations rushing through him. It’s good. It’s perfect, and Tony belongs to him. This mouth, these beautiful, skilled hands. The way that Tony swallows around him like he’s already trying to milk Steve through his orgasm.
Steve groaned, gripping Tony at the nape of his neck and forcing his face up for a long, satisfying kiss. If that was what Tony really wanted…
. Tony powers past it anyways. “All those things you said. Did you…?”
Coming here was a terrible idea and it wouldn’t have taken a psychic to tell him that he and Steve would end up at each other’s throat again. He just didn’t anticipate it would be about
Tony grunts, slamming into him. He moans out some semblance of Steve’s name and comes, whispering that he loves Steve as he pulses deep inside him. It feels like a lie but Tony’s still saying it, over and over again; he loves Steve anyway.
Tony takes a moment to catch his breath, cradling Steve’s head to his stomach. “Feel better this time?”
“Oh, is that how it is? I’ll give you something to strike, Rogers.” Tony growls a little in his chest, and Steve smacks an open palm down on his ass.
“Don’t stop.” Steve desperately clings to the edges of his orgasm, terrified it could all be ripped away in a second. He’s not ready to wake up, he’s not. “Tony. Tony,
The thought makes his skin crawl. But these are his people and he’s not completely alone without Steve. He knows that. He knows that Pepper and Happy won’t take him for granted. Or haven’t so far.
But they can’t take the memories he has now. No one can ever tamper with the life Steve can live with Tony when he closes his eyes.
Tony and Morgan sharing pieces of fruit and reading bedtime stories. Tony tossing bits of food out the window to that damned alpaca. Kayaking, side-by-side through the water in the early days of autumn. It’s all there in his mind.
Steve plastered a grin on his face as he’d slurped down something cold, disgusting, and slippery; not unlike he’d have expected a massive booger to taste like. When Tony told him it was an aphrodisiac, taking in Steve’s blank look and requesting for JARVIS to provide a definition, the rest of the team cackled and rolled their eyes.
“You’re not too sore?” When Tony rolls his eyes, Steve gives him a playful smack on the hip, and starts to readjust him until Tony’s pressed up against his chest, facing away. “Like this,” Steve breaths into his ear, “I want to hold you just like this.”
Tony moans in his ear and slows his movements, letting Steve feel every slick drag of his cock as it works back into his body. Everything is reduced to where they’re joined and the aching spots Tony’s fingers are leaving on his hips.
“It’s not fan mail. There’s no return address, but I’ve scanned the inside of the contents and though I’ve calculated a mild risk upon opening, I still think you’ll want to review the contents.”
Let me know what you think, I'd love to hear your thoughts!
There had never been any pressure intended. Tony and Steve had talked at length before they’d initially bonded that things like nesting and breeding weren’t in the cards; Tony having no instinct and being past the age to have or want children anyhow.
“Are you alright?”
“Flatterer.” Tony pecks his lips and doesn’t let him go for a long while.
Steve’s jaw twitches and he doesn’t answer.
Tony is pinned underneath him, breathing hard, grinning up at him like he’s somehow won their little game. Which isn’t how he should be looking at him, because this is the third time Steve’s pinned him in as many minutes. But Tony just keeps beaming, like sweat isn’t dripping off Steve’s forehead and onto his chest, and there isn’t a bruise already forming on Tony’s cheek where Steve caught him with an elbow the last time Tony had him in a headlock.
“You giving out olive-branch flip phones to all the people you fuck over, Cap? Here I was thinking I was special. Obviously, it’s me.”
That’s what the grief has been. A bed of nails that he’s been laid down over, pressed down, down, down until it pierces every inch of him. The wounds have healed over, but the nails shift and jab under his skin every time he moves.
“Vacation? Are you kidding me! You have no idea what I’ve been—”
The more he stumbled upon them, the more he found himself tripping into a hot shower, jerking himself off fast onto the tiles. It was getting a bit exhausting.
“I prefer Terminator, then,” Bucky challenges, and Tony tips his head in answer.
Two orgasms later, Steve floated restlessly in his own thoughts, tethered by Bucky’s heavy weight on his chest where he was snoring. Warm breath swirled over his chest, Bucky scenting peace and ease, even in his dreams, relaxing Steve’s own nerves.
Bucky wasn’t going to fuck this up for them. He couldn’t.
“We’re trading stories about when we met Fury for the first time.” Rhodey fills in.
And it’s so damn good.
Tony’s hand settles over his chest, and Steve closes his eyes and breathes. The air tastes sour in his mouth and sits heavy in his lungs, but the second breath is easier. Then the third. Tony always knows just what to say, just what to do, when Steve sits there, useless, drowning in loss.
“What do you think, darlin’?” Bucky drawled, arching his back and putting himself, and the outfit, on display.
Tony dies anyway.
Blue eyes that made him feel cold inside.
“Please stop doing this to me.” Tony whispered.
This is something good. Tony wants him to know that this is something good. His nails dig into Steve’s chest through his shirt, and Steve’s eyes drop down to his mouth, a perfect row of teeth and the little laugh lines that frame his lips.
Tony tugs his shirt over his head, tossing it to the side with his own before he’s reaching down and working on the clasp of Steve’s belt and the button on his jeans. It’s like no time at all has passed, and Steve is exactly the same as he remembers. He’s all subtle, musky male, firm with thick muscles that Tony wants to bite and scratch. Just leave a few marks as a reminder that Steve is still Tony’s.
Thanks for staying with me to the end and please let me know what you think. Know that I cherish every single comment and they've kept me going in moments I've hated the story!
Pepper’s eyes search his for a moment but there’s no judgement there. “It’s not pathetic. The things that comfort us when we’re hurting aren’t pathetic.” She pauses to give him a sad smile, and rests her fingertips feather-light on his wrist. “No more pathetic than sleeping in the hallway outside your ex-husband's hospital room for a week.”
“This is who I am,” Steve argues.
Bucky gave him a quizzical look. “Okay, somethin’s up. He never goes in on Sundays.”
.” The last word floats on a sneer.
They get them back. Bucky and Sam. Vision and Wanda. Peter Parker in the suit he and Tony had built together from scratch. The portals open behind them and for one brief, perfect second, everyone is home.
Tony’s heavy eyes flicker closed and he forces them back open. By the time he can fix his gaze on the door, Pepper is already gone.
“Buck seriously, you are terrible at the laundry.”
He’s lost the kid.
It isn’t the first time Tony’s forgotten about his enhanced hearing, and he stiffens when he hears Rhodes and Tony talking through the door. They’re just on the other side of the suite, through the closed connecting doors, getting ready in the living room that opens into a broad, elegant kitchenette.
Then it hits him. “Who was here? After Thanos? Who was here for you?”
Without fail, Bucky scented him like mad as soon as the key turned the lock.
Things are better.
Tony narrows his eyes and points with the index finger on his good hand. “So you do have an opinion?”
Sometimes, sitting perched astride Steve’s hips while he loses himself in pleasure is like watching the sunrise.
before tipping his head for Tony to continue.
And Steve was willing to bet she would have knitted him a dozen more if that was what he needed.
Almost immediately, Tony’s body arched into the touch and Steve bit down on his bottom lip, smiling to himself. He’d have to be gentle with him, it’d been a while and Steve knew he was big. Tony had complained often enough to drill that sentiment home. It had never stopped him from goading Steve on between breathy moans and hands clenched around Steve’s hips to prevent him from pulling back.
It’s a shame that word of Steve’s brutality never made the headlines.
Memory-Tony was sharing a story about his mother now, wiping spit and spunk from his chin as he recounted a recipe she used to make in the fall because it’s right before Thanksgiving. It’s a dessert he hasn’t had since the Thanksgiving before she died, and Steve had said he’d give it a try. He’d followed through on that promise a few weeks later and Tony had had to blink the stars from his eyes for a month afterwards
Steve swallows, Adam’s apple bobbing thick in his throat, but he holds back the tears and lets his face go carefully blank. Maybe he has a better poker face than Tony has given him credit for.
He doesn’t get into it right away. It still feels rude, disrespectful even though they’ve done this before, and with a raspy voice, Tony has thanked him after. Praised him, even.
“Language! You kiss Iron Man with that mouth Cap?” Peter chirps from the beams as Clint hoots with laughter from somewhere in the ventilation system.
Tony shivered and gasped at the thought.
Steve sees right through the shaky logic, but it’s enough to keep him in bed for another night.
“I don’t care.” Steve steps back into his space, looping his arms around Tony’s waist because he really can’t stand to keep his hands off Tony. They’ve never had this much uninterrupted time together, and the possibilities feel endless. This time belongs to them. “I really don’t. We’ve got the whole week. Whatever you want, anything you want.”
Sweat trickles down the back of his neck, and nervous energy rushes through him like fissions of energy up and down his spine. There’s waiting, and then there’s
In the end, it’s not difficult. It’s as simple as twisting his fingers through Tony’s and taking a stand. It’s as simple as accepting what they have to and refusing to budge on what they don’t.
“It’s too big a risk. We have Morgan now, Tony, and we’re retired. We have to think about what’s best for Morgan. It’s not just you and me anymore, and the others—”
Was this how Steve had felt, all those years ago, when he’d put the Valkyrie in the water? Steve hadn’t panicked, Tony had heard the tape. Steve had just promised Peggy a dance, voice calm and even, apologetic even at the end, and been a strength for her through it all.
Tony could kick his own ass. This is Peter. He’ll always make something work for Peter and not just because he owes him one—more than one.
Steve even lets Tony beat the shit out of him in one.
The soulmark at Steve’s wrist flares again and a pocket of dread starts to fill in the bottom of his gut, curling and tightening with nervousness. He’ll be damned if Tony thinks he can skip out of medical after this is all over. If Steve doesn’t give him a once over himself, first.
The tears come and don’t stop.
Tony licked a stripe up his throat and breathes hot in his ear. “You’re just full of surprises, Steve. I like that, and I’m going to figure out every—single—one.”
He’s not wearing safety goggles, and Steve considers chiding him, just for old time’s sake. With a hand on the door, he pauses.
Sagging back against one of the long desks, Tony swallows around the taste of copper in his mouth.
There aren’t any words to explain how this is the last remaining thing Steve has that doesn’t make him want to lie down and die on that battlefield with Tony. The fight bleeds out of him and he chokes on a fresh sob, crumpling in on himself with his fists pressed to his face. If he were still small, Steve would crawl under the chair and stay there, safe from Bucky’s steady, unwavering gaze and the reality that he can’t do a damned thing about any of this.
“Never thought I’d land myself a sugar daddy.” Clint teased, leaning back in his chair with arms crossed behind his head as the room dissolved into laughter.
“I didn’t either, at first, I don’t think.” Bucky said thoughtfully. “It’s like one day I just woke up and realized something was different. He almost smells… sweeter?”
“Or maybe Tony’s nesting drive has finally shown up?” Clint teased, elbowing him in the ribs. “Started settling into that domestic life, tin man? Our very own fuzzy ‘mega magpie?”
“What?”
“Oh fuck, Tony, yes. I can’t believe I can still – fuck.”
He doesn’t grace that with a reply because ‘just as much as it’s hurting me’, really? Steve can’t possibly think that.
“Oh, I don’t know Tony, anything at this point? The man is still your husband,” Rhodey points out, cocking one eyebrow and nodding in the direction of his left hand. The pale circle left behind on his skin glares up at him as obvious as the vibranium wedding band once had.
“We’ll scramble the drill lineup.” He says quickly, as if that’s going to fix anything because it’s
“God, did you go back in cryo with him or something? This takes slow-on-the-uptake to a whole new level Rogers–”
“What?” Steve asks.
This must be what it’s like to really be numb, to be empty. The bucket that could be overflowing with joy, seeing Steve again, knowing he’s safe and alive, is overshadowed by the last twenty-one days. Tony can’t stop thinking about the kid.
“I want to ask you something. We haven’t talked much about it in a while, but—”
The first time Tony had let him stay the night had been a gift.
What was it about
“I—” Resolve hardens across Steve’s face and he sits up a fraction straighter. Something black starts to unfold in Tony’s belly, familiar and foul. “Tony, we have an obligation. To our team, to the world. Hell, to the galaxy at this point. You can’t tell me you’re just going to walk away from that. I know that you’ve been through a lot—”
“You’re such a dick.” Tony growled, a put-upon sound that didn’t come naturally to most O’s, pushing out of Steve’s lap until he upright and shoving Bucky down into the mountain of blankets.
Steve laughs his way into his pants and is still laughing on the roof a few minutes later when Tony grabs hold of his wrist, snaps the faceplate shut, and fires them off to the battle.
It’s not a pretty sight, never was, and he feels as sick as he looks. But Steve will hold the shame at bay if it kills him.
“You’re beautiful,” Steve gasps out, and one of Tony’s palms slaps down on his chest as he jerks forward, involuntarily. His eyes light up despite the twist of an almost-shy grin on his lips.
“Steve has been using the retro-framing program for almost sixty consecutive hours, Bucky.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. says. She sounds sad. Steve didn’t know a computer could sound like that.
“Harder.” Steve’s heels press into the small of Tony’s back as his nails dig into soft, malleable skin until Steve’s sure he’ll leave marks. “Tony please—
Tony picks up the pace, biting down on Steve’s lip as something desperate wriggles free and explodes between them. Tony fucks into him until Steve doesn’t have to worry about all the years they’ve wasted. Everything pales in comparison to this moment, right now, and the way that Tony’s hand comes down to wrap around his cock, slick with lube and the precome leaking steadily from the tip to pump him in times with his thrusts.
“Captain Rogers initiated the sequencing independently. He’s unable to alter the original programming and I’m having some trouble overriding the system. I’ve located the error in my network but B.A.R.F. will require a manual override until you have time to complete a coding update on my network connection.”
“Bucky,” A light smile played across Steve’s lips. “God, I missed you.”
There’s no time to catch his breath before it starts again.
A few minutes slipped past before Steve shifts and comes awake with a start, blue eyes flicking up to meet Tony’s before he settles and relaxes back into the pillows. It seems they shared the same fear then, that it had all been a dream, and the other might disappear in the light of day.
“We’ve got all the time in the world. We’ve got a daughter to raise, and you promised me forever, husband of mine.” The last word is pointed, and Steve could cry, laughing around the thick knot in his throat.
“Mates. Alphas. My alphas. Fuck, please, please.” Tony panted, raking his nails down Steve’s chest. He let himself go boneless in Steve’s capable arms. Steve will take care of him.
Tony should have known better. He did know better, he just told himself he didn’t care. The desire to shut Steve up wells up and Tony’s never been known for his self-control.
It makes sense, because it feels new to Tony too and once Steve finds his footing again and tips his chin up with a brush of his fingertips, it gets even better. Like putting on a new mark of one of his suits, always new and exciting, better than the last, and yet sweetened with the sameness of what came before.
“Yup.”
The rest of the room is watching the exchange in varying stages of obviousness and Tony knows what this is. What it must look like. Peter fucking Parker bringing everyone back together. Mending fences and all that jazz. Maybe it’s time.
Steve swallowed, weighing his options.
“You hate this, don’t you?” Tony says, looking his fill. “Being small. Weak. Needing to ask someone else for help for a change. But you’re still drooling for it.”
But Tony wants him to stay. Now, then. Forever. He wants Steve to stay and never hurt him again and he can see that Steve wants that too. At dinner, Steve eats his meal and asks Tony about his day, about his pain, about whether or not he’s heard from Pepper, and how Peter is adjusting back into his life. When the meal is put away, Steve asks him where he wants to start.
Running his hand through his lanky, too long hair, Bucky refocused his attention on the weights next to his bench. It wasn’t as much that he needed to lift weights so much as he enjoyed the structure and repetition. Each movement, controlled and dictated by a schedule long pressed into his brain.
It’s hard not to wonder what Steve is doing, where he is at this exact moment. Tony spends more time than he cares to admit preoccupied with the idea, regardless of where he is in the world.
Steve pressed into the shallow of his mouth, lazily thrusting the tip of his cock between Tony’s lips as he tried to suck and lick between gasps. Bucky wasn’t leaving any room to breath, pressing over him and setting a punishing pace. The sound of skin slapping against skin and the musky, salty taste of Steve down his throat left him teetering on a knife’s edge.
Tony rolls off him, dragging the duvet up over them both. He curls towards Steve with one arm under the pillow and his cheeks rosy-red. “That was unexpected. Dinner’s going to be cold now.”
It’s an Alpha son, and Obie becomes as unbearable in the second half of his second pregnancy as he was in the first half of his first pregnancy.
“Maybe Tony could handle it if he didn’t waste his time on those silly degrees he’ll never use and spend his time doing his duty as an Omega,” Howard says bitterly.
Tony and Obie clean up and become presentable by the time they reach their Malibu mansion. Tony straightens out his clothes and moves to get out of the car. He notices that
The military plane finally lands and Tony can see Happy and Pepper as the walkway lowers. Rhodey takes Tony’s hand and guides the Omega down, ignoring his grumblings. An EMT with a gurney approaches as Tony and Rhodey reach the ground. “Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of it,” Tony scoffs. He didn’t let Dr. Demir examine him because of the arc reactor, why would he let anyone else?
“He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make a list of materials. He says for you to start working immediately, and when you’re done, he will set you free.”
Tony picks up his Beta son with an exaggerated grunt. “What were you screaming about, tiny one? I can’t be by your side 24/7 Mister.”
The Omega interrupts the AI, “I know the math! Do it!” Without another word, JARVIS complies.
Obie hits Tony for the first time 3 months after getting married. Obie had come home and tripped on one of Zeke’s toys and was nearly ripping the young boy a new one. Tony hated how Zeke shrunk into himself as his father screeched at him. So Tony got between them and calmly told his husband to stop yelling at their son. Then Obie started yelling at Tony for talking back to him and telling him how to discipline his son. Tony tries to calmly diffuse Obie’s anger and doesn’t see the blow coming. He staggers to the ground from the force of it and stays there until Obie walks away.
Tony makes his way down to the kitchen and fills up a bowl with lukewarm water. That’s when he gets a call from an unknown number, which he would usually ignore, never taking calls that weren’t on his contact list, but in this instance, he was distracted.
“They both had created a professional standing with their names and couldn’t exactly change that, but I was only 4. So they changed my name to Yinsen Ho, or rather Ho Yinsen by American standards. It helped a little, especially professionally because at least on paper I didn’t seem like a foreigner. But I still look like one. It didn’t matter that my Mandarin was perfect and that I had lived there my whole life. China wasn’t a land of immigrants the way America is, or even a lot of Western countries. Even the foreigners that usually do live there, are European white.”
“Hello Captain Rogers,” JARVIS greeted. There was a millisecond of silence before realization dawned upon the AI. “Captain Rogers? But I’ve detected Captain Rogers to already be in the building. I must alert Si—“
“I’m afraid Commander Rogers that you do not have the security clearance necessary to access that information and that I must inform the Avengers of your arrival,” JARVIS said coolly. Steve knew that JARVIS never liked him. He could nearly hear the disapproval in the AI’s voice every time Tony brought him home, though he never once made such disapproval clear.
“Tony! Tony, are you okay?”
“We gotta hurry. Take this.” Tony hands the new arc reactor to the redhead. “You gotta switch it out quickly.”
“Yes, this is your birthday present to me.”
Tony takes Pepper to the side and hands her a drive. “I need you to go to my office, on Monday. Not today, Obie will be expecting it, and there will be no one else around during the weekend, so go on Monday. You’re going to hack into the mainframe and you’re going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This’ll get you in. It’s probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading. This’ll give me information on them dealing under the table.”
them.
Omegas are not referred to as "Mr." or "Mrs." But "Of" to indicate an unmarried status and "From" to indicate a married status. This is a little tidbit I picked up from
“That’s what you always say,” Steve said calmly before he closed the door behind him, though his rapidly beating heart betrayed the emotions he was trying to externally display. Tony said it every time they fought like this. And it still broke his heart every time. Because this time it could be true. This time he could mean it. Steve knew, because of who he was, because of who he was made to be, every moment with Tony could be his last.
“Indeed I am.”
“He’s working very hard, but it’s a very difficult task.”
You can find me on Tumblr as
Tony Stark, on the other hand, couldn’t give less of a shit. He has known this day was coming since the day he truly understood what it meant to be Omega in his father’s eyes. Sure, by law, he could inherit Stark Industries and his father’s many properties and assets as an Omega. But his father, ever the traditionalist, would never let that happen. He has known since he was 4 years old and his father caught him building a motherboard. He has known since his father screamed at him hoarse and his mother sat him down and explained his place in this society.
Good riddance. Tony nods, hoping to seem solemn. Tony pecks the Alpha goodbye and waits for him to be out the door before he turned to Pepper.
“My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.”
Then Stark Industries and the Stane family all move to Malibu, in a large mansion on a private beach, a stark contrast to their still large, but relatively smaller Cambridge home. Obie lives with them full time now. It’s a huge adjustment for everyone.
“That altitude record for fixed-wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.”
They got a rhythm going. Slowly, they were manufacturing the parts necessary for the suit of armor. Their captors had yet to catch onto what they were actually building, even though that would only last for so long. Things were going as well as they could. So of course, the universe had to throw a wrench into their plans.
“I’m sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me.”
(A couple of months later, Steve personally shoved dozens of print-outs of the BBC article about France returning the skulls under Mr. Bassett’s door. He really hoped Mr. Bassett knew it was him.)
“Yeah, I feel great.” A chuckle slips out of Tony, and then two, and then Tony is thrown into full-blown laughter.
“What?” Pepper questions on the other side of the line.
“That’s because,” Tony responds, “It’s a miniature arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.”
Rhodey
“Don’t put it back in! Don’t put it back in!” Peter and Harley look up in alarm again.
Tony walks off the podium to the resounding sound of screaming reporters and just catches Obie’s furious look as he moves to leave the building. As he exits, Tony can hear Obie tell the press that Pepper and Rhodey will be continuing the conference. Tony continues to walk off and towards the limo (God Obie is so excessive sometimes) waiting outside the building.
Pepper interrupts him. “Obadiah, he’s gone insane!”
trap. And I did create a formula for the glue on your hands that’s safe for human skin because I’m not that cruel as to give you permanent skin damage using real superglue, even if you have been stealing my packages, which
“He wants to know what you think.”
“I am your mother. I will
“Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off so…I really should be all to…”
“I’m so sorry, babies,” Tony tries to soothe.
Rhodey sighs. “I figured it was something like that.” He stays quiet for a moment. “Do you need me to run interference with Obie? What do you want me to say to him?”
“Uncle Rhodey let it slip,” the teenager shrugs. Tony looks up to glare at his best friend, who had the decency to at least look a little sheepish.  “Don’t be mad at him, we pestered him.” Harley and Peter nod as solemnly as the school-aged children could. Though they are young, they understand death from the years of their mother mourning their grandparents. (Maria and Jarvis, Tony never mourned his bastard sperm donor).
He stops for a moment before he continues, “I was raised in China. I was born here in Afghanistan, but my father always wanted to get out. He was a scientist, and research and development aren’t as expansive here as in other places in the world, especially back then. My father got a job in Beijing when I was 4. It was hard for him, as the only brown person at his work, in daily life. It was hard for my mother too. So they assimilated, as much as they could.”
“Obie!” Tony yells out as he crashes into the Alpha, throwing them both into oncoming traffic.
Tony walks over to another work station, and Yinsen follows. He shuffles thin pieces of paper with schematics on them one on top of the other over the flat light source on the table. “This our ticket out of here.”
“Well, then,” the Alpha starts with a glint of
“Why are you saying sorry to
Yahya continues to look at him in bewilderment.
“You have a lot of nerve coming up to me tonight,” Tony days without missing a beat.
“Fine,” Tony gritted his teeth, “Have it your way,
“I don’t understand why…” Pepper can’t even finish before the inventor interrupted her.
The man starts to speak in Urdu, looking at Tony but presumably speaking to Yahya. Unbeknownst to anyone in the room, save for Tony himself and Yahya, Tony can actually understand Urdu.**** It is very close to Hindi, which Tony has learned for the sake of the SI division in Delhi. Tony, however, does not make this known and continues to play dumb.
“Okay, I got it! I got it!”
Since Betas' secondary sex also helps determine reproduction stuff, their gender/sex boundary gets muddled. There is a distinction made between Beta Male and Female that is not made for Omegas and Alphas.
“I’m going to keep this short,” Tony starts, looking out into the crowd of cameras and journalists. “On February 13, I was in a convoy that got attacked, and I was the target. I was taken by these insurgents and held for the last three months. They tortured me, but they did not rape me. Fortunately, on May 1, just a day ago, top Air Force officers found and liberated me. That is all I will say on the matter; I would like to go home to my son now. I will not be taking any questions. Thank you and goodbye.”
When Tony finishes, he tells JARVIS to call the boys down for dinner and tell Zeke to bring Jamie. He sets ups the dining table as they all rush in. “No running,” the Omega admonishes.
Tony sees the doctor out and comes back to all his children and Pepper, who he had called to watch the kids while he was with the doctor, in the living room. He watches Pepper eye the gaping hole where the piano once stood as she walks toward him. He needs to barricade and baby-proof that ASAP.
(Tony goes to Zeke’s prekindergarten graduation that next Monday. Obie does not. Tony resigns himself to a life like his mother’s; history has a funny way of repeating itself like that.)
“Yes, please.”
“All the good in my life infinitely outweighs the bad. I have no regrets.” Tony gives the teenager a kiss on the forehead and leaves him to his nightly routine.
“Emergency,” Tony corrects, “Why didn’t she tell me she was leaving? Did she even know I was home?”
(See the end of the chapter for
This time he’s propped up onto a chair. There are so many people around him. They’re recording him…he thinks. It’s hard to tell.
.” Tony can hear the slight disdain coming from the journalist.
Thankfully, the man only seems amused at that. “Yup. How was his reaction before I came? I missed that part, obviously.”
Pepper takes Jamie from Tony once again. “You have to go Tony. The boys are done with their breakfast. And you’re going to be
Tony was exhausted all the time after Peter was born. Between finishing his Ph.D. and taking care of two kids, Tony was at the end of his means. Thank God Jarvis had come to help Tony the first couple of weeks before retiring to England.

Steve pressed one last kiss to Tony’s cold hand before pushing himself off the bed. “I can’t live without you,” Steve sighed as he continued to stare at Tony, “and I won’t.”
Slowly, bit by bit, the paralysis is wearing off. So with much exertion, Tony throws himself off the couch and drags himself over to the elevator to take him down to the workshop. The paralysis is completely gone once he reaches the workshop. He eyes the arc reactor that Pepper had encased in glass and tries to make his way over. He immediately falls over, too weak to even walk, but Tony does not give up. He army crawls his way over to the table and tries to grab the glass box but he can’t get a hold of it. Black dots dance in his vision as he is unable to hold up his weight and slumps over, the arc reactor out of reach.
“If we’re double-dealing under the table…Are we?”
Also I have a slightly specific, non-traditional A/B/O Verse, and this is what I've come up with so far:
They don’t completely finish before the Ten Rings figure them out. The explosive on the door buys them some time. But not enough. So Yahya does something stupid. He doesn’t stick to the plan. Tony wishes he had just

could sue
So they did.
“Maybe I’m just a heavy breather, Rhodey, did you think of that?” Tony snipes.
“I wasn’t on vacation,” Tony exclaims, “I was kidnapped! It’s only been three weeks!”
“It’s who?” Rhodey asks with mock-incomprehension.
“Sire, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.”
Rhodey visibly calms down and just looks at Tony knowingly for a moment. “You loved this man.” It’s not a question.
“No, he won’t,” the Alpha captive agrees.
“No. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked,” Pepper says as she pinches her nose, “not spring like the season.”
amount) of Mr. Bassett’s critiques of the U.S. government.
“No, I don’t. Shut up, Tony.”)
Later that day, Rhodey comes down to the workshop to see his best friend playing action figures with his four sons. “Hey kiddos,” Rhodey says as he bends down towards the group, “I need to talk to your mom for a quick minute.”
Tony is obviously aged down. He is born on May 29, 1980, instead of 1970. Other characters ages have been adjusted as such (like Rhodey, who meets and befriends Tony at MIT, has his age adjusted so that would still occur).
“Come on, stand up. Stand up!” The Alpha whispers harshly, grabbing Tony by his elbow in order to drag him up. Tony tries not to flinch, the action reminiscent of Obie.
“Baby, it’s 2:00am, you need to get to bed,” Tony needles his eldest.
“I just wanted to see my baby boy before I left for the other side of the world.”
Tony Stane is not even 22 years old when he loses the only parent he had left.
Tony bristles at the thought. “My dad wanted to name me Peter,” Tony lies. Howard didn’t care what Tony was named, he was Omega after all. Tony refuses to name his precious son after that bastard. “But my mother insisted on Anthony, after her father. So we should name him Peter.”
“Collateral damage, Tony.” Obie looks as though he is about to throw the vehicle, but Tony is quicker. He diverts power into the chest piece and blasts Obie with a unibeam. Tony catches the car as Obie staggers and loses his grip on it.
When Steve Rogers woke up one sunny morning, the first thing he saw was Tony Stark’s sleeping face. Steve was on his back with Tony draped over his torso, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder. Steve took a moment to take in the beauty of his lover, the warmth of affection spreading within him. Tony looked absolutely serene in his sleep. His curls were tousled messily, in a way Tony usually does purposefully, but this was instead due to the brunette’s tossing and turning in sleep and their activities from the night before. His long eyelashes rested on his cheekbones, his pink lips pursed in sleep. Steve was in awe. How was such a beautiful, amazing man with someone like him?
“What am I supposed to think Tony?” Rhodey almost yells, “You’re only one week pregnant! What else am I supposed to think?”
Tony has a problem. While the Omega had done the best that he could with what he had in the cave, it is obvious that his current arc reactor would not be able to hold up much longer. So obviously, Tony makes a new one with the best materials in his state-of-the-art workshop.
“What do you want a delivery date?” Tony asks as he moves closer, causing all the Betas and Alphas in the room to scramble and point their guns at Tony, yelling at him to get back.
makes sure that Obie can
“Me either. I don’t like Dad; he hurt you all the time,” Peter mimics.
“Where are we?” Tony starts to ask. Then the sound of a latch opening echoes in the cave and a loud voice is heard from beyond the metal doors.
Harley and Peter reluctantly let go of their mother so he can move freely. Then, the adolescent Beta drags Tony to the living room where they had an impressive spread of food set up, the younger children on their heels.
Tony shrugs nonchalantly. “It was a freak accident. It won’t happen again.”
With Tony no longer on top of him, Steve pushed himself off the bed and headed towards the bathroom. “You know I have to Tony.” Though his back was to his lover, Steve could feel Tony’s face twist into an ugly grimace. He hated this. He hated that the fight this would likely lead to. He hated that he couldn’t listen to Tony. That he couldn’t just stay like both he and his lover wanted. He hated that he had to leave and do horrible things that Tony would just resent him for. Steve especially hated himself, for doing this to Tony and still always coming back.
Tony finishes the project and continues to design weapons for SI.
(Except that it was also the first time of many.)
Slower, Peter and Harley get into their chairs as Zeke gently places the youngest of them in his high chair before taking a seat himself. Tony takes the time to place a kiss on top of each of their heads before sitting down himself, each boy beaming from the attention from their mother.
That’s when the doctor decides to walk in. Tony scrambles to cover up the arc reactor with Rhodey stepping in front of the Omega to help him do so.
“Momma, we were so scared,” Harley sobs.
“Rhodes, are you kidding me? Since when do you introduce yourself like that to me?”
They stop in front of a pile of scrap metal and spare parts. The Alpha leader speaks. Tony’s fellow captive translates once again.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” Pepper cries out as she starts to pull the wire out.
“Let’s.” Tony grabs Pepper’s hand and leads her to and on the dance floor, which got them some looks seeing as they were going against conventional dynamic standards with an Omega leading a Beta.
They continue to waterboard him until he passes out. Then, they wake him up and start the process again.
“Nothing, Wasp,” Steve said calmly as The Wasp continued to scream at him through the phone, “I have not done anything to Iron Man, but I would still check on him if I were you.”
“Well, Ms. Brown, it's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.”
Tony tries to reach out again. He feels a tug on something, anchoring him. “I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” the Alpha says. It’s coming from his chest. He rips away at the bandages.
Pepper looks at Tony skeptically. “Speed bump, what does that mean?”
“Let’s face it. This is not the worst thing you’ve caught me doing,” the Omega says, trying to ease the tension.
“How big are your hands?” Tony repeats.
He had a mission.
He comes to again.
Obie stays in New York most of the time, dealing with SI business. He comes home on the weekends, usually only staying 2-3 days. Tony and Obie spend their first bonded Heat together, refreshing Tony’s bonding bite, and they spend Obie’s Rut together, refreshing Obie’s bite. And they continue to do so for every Heat and Rut to come.
“Sorry we had to be here instead of celebrating Pepper’s birthday with her.”
“Yes, well, I have great taste. We should go dance.”
His mother’s funeral is a small affair. It’s just Tony, Jarvis, Zeke, and Obie. Tony, Jarvis, and Zeke quietly mourned, but Obie looked like he’d rather be anywhere else.
“He has my arc reactor. The newer one. And he has a suit like mine, but worse. The agents won’t be enough. I have to stop him.”
“Sir, it appears that his suit can fly,” JARVIS remarks smartly.
Tony hears them before he sees them. Tony turns around violently, almost tipping himself over, and there they were. Helicopters flying in his direction.
“The suit’s at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight. Keep me posted. And call Pepper.
Tony catches his hand before the Alpha could get up. “Wait, there’s something I need to tell you.” Obie turns to look at him. “I’m pregnant.”
“It smells,” the redhead grimaces.
“Oh my god, Tony,” Pepper says, baffled, “Of course. I’ll look into it straight away.”
Just as he expected, the Avengers Quinjet flew overhead, heading to the place he had just come from. As he was sure all the Avengers would go to their teammate and friend’s aid, Steve came to the conclusion that the Headquarters would likely be empty, leaving him to complete his mission in peace with no obstacles.
Tony lands a little less than gracefully. “Pepper,” he says into the comm.
The Firefighters Gala and its aftermath
Tony doesn’t hesitate in his answer. “I refuse.”
“I’m an airman.”
“I was covered in two tons of titanium-gold alloy. And after the first crash, I updated JARVIS to be able to scan me for the baby’s heartbeat or any sign of miscarriage. I was and am fine and so is baby. I wouldn’t do anything to put them in harm’s way.”
came his way. Tony is thrown back by the force of the explosion, he didn’t get away.
The man chuckles again. “Yeah it’s probably better than that.”
Kudos and comments are appreciated! Let me know what your favorite part is in the comments!
“Yesterday.”
“They had my weapons, Pepper. Guns, missiles, bombs, whatever Stark Industries sells weapons-wise, they had. I need to figure out how.”
“You’re at a SHIELD medical facility.”
Alpha/Alpha, Beta Male/Beta Male, Beta Female/Beta Female, and Omega/Omega relationships are the relationships considered homosexual. People who are attracted to sexes different from theirs are considered heterosexual (for example - Alphas attracted to Betas and Omegas). People who are attracted to sexes like and unlike their sex are considered bisexual. Pansexual, though under the umbrella of bisexual, specifically also includes all genders and all sexes, as someone can be bisexual and have certain limitations/preferences.
“I’m wondering why my husband didn’t bring me here. I thought we were trying to get the board to see that I’m not suffering from post-traumatic stress and that I can handle being head of R&D still. How are we supposed to do that if I’m not at the most important charitable Stark Industries event of the year?”
Steve then punched the glass barrier that surrounded the Tesseract. The bulletproof glass was no match for super-soldier strength and shattered onto the floor. Steve ignored the bleedings cuts on his hand as the alarms sounded and bright red lights flashed. He knew that he only had a few moments before the Avengers were informed and they started making their way back.
Rhodey falls back into the chair as Dr. Demir rushes out of the room. He is dangerously quiet.
“I had an accident in the lab,” Tony lies, “It blasted me into the wall.”
“In two months, I won’t even be able to fit into it.”
“Tony Stane hasn’t been seen in public since his brief press conference right after coming back stateside. Some claim he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress and has been bedridden for weeks,” the announcer continues, “Whatever the case may be, no one expects an appearance from him tonight.”
“Hello, I’m Dr. Demir,” the Beta man says without looking up from the clipboard he had in hand, “And I will be the physician examining you today, From Stane.”
Tony gets a call in the middle of the night that wakes up his infant son.
“Yeah, Dad’s a meanie and a bad person,” his second-youngest exclaims with just as much vigor.
**Yinsen will be referred to as Yahya for generally the rest of the fic, unless Tony deliberately calls him Yinsen.
“Momma, do you have to go?” Harley whines.
“Wait, how did…”
On February 11, 2008, Tony Stane should be accepting the Apogee Award in Las Vegas, presented to him by his best friend. Instead, he is at home all the way in Malibu taking care of his sick child because he cannot bear to leave him alone in such pain.
Obie was stunned into silence. Tony curses internally. It was a miscalculation, revealing the arc reactor to Obie in anger like this. Sure, there was no way Tony could hide this from Obie as the man was his Alpha, but this was not how he wanted his husband to find out.
“I don’t have to do anything,” Tony responds haughtily, “There are 3 things I want. I want an American cheeseburger, for one.”
Rhodey lets the younger Omega lead him back to the kids’ area where Zeke was entertaining his baby brothers with action figures. Tony watches as Rhodey grabs a superhero action figure and starts play-fighting with Harley while making explosion noises, and he thanks whatever entity out there for being able to come back to his family.
When a handful of them move their targets from him to the hostages, Tony is forced to lower his gauntlets. Instead, he targets the 4 criminals and shoots them individually so as not to harm the civilians. One of the hostages, a little boy, runs over to his father as he calls out for him. Tony pays no mind to the touching display. Instead, he goes over to where the Ten Rings commander, the one who was once in charge of keeping him hostage, is hiding and pulls him through a wall and out into the open.
