Valkyrie is waiting there for them, perched on the arm of a loveseat, sipping at a bottle of beer she must have found on the refrigerator while holding a second one on her other hand.
Clint stays in the same position as they walk out of the leaving room: arms hanging limply by his sides, shoulders slumped, head hanging down, tears wetting his face and his low sobbing noises his only companions.
Almost immediately the bots go rolling towards Steve and they surround him in a matter of seconds.
“I’m not going to lecture you,” Tony starts saying, hoping his speech really doesn’t come across as a lecture. “You’re probably a thousand years older than I am and I’m also not the best role model. But you’re here now. It’s stupid if you’re here just to make the same mistakes you were making somewhere else. You told us once that Earth taught you to be a better version of yourself, I think you said less egocentric. I maybe would have said less of a jerk.”
Steve and Pepper go silent again as they start eating their food and Steve’s grateful for the break in the conversation because it gives him time to order his ideas and make sense of what he has heard Pepper say.
It’s intoxicating, the feel of Steve’s tongue in his mouth, caressing his palate, tracing the back of his teeth, pulling away to trace the shape of Tony’s lips. It’s sensual and all-consuming. Completely life-changing.
U is the one who reaches him first and Steve immediately feels the corners of his lips tugging up as he pats U’s robot arm. Dummy and Butterfingers are only a second behind and they surround him and start pulling at the waist of his uniform even though there isn’t much give to the fabric.
There is none of that this morning.
It hits too close to home and for a second Steve is back in that train watching as his best friend falls down hundreds of feet down from a mountain as Steve can do nothing to help.
“Good,” Tony replies as he walks into the room even though Natasha hasn't instructed them to. “We came so you could babysit us.”
“I don’t want to lose you,” Tony pleads.
“That’s just how Tony is, you know that, ” Steve says.
Tony doesn’t want to give up, and he won’t, but he lets Steve walk away from these situations knowing that sometimes that’s the best he can offer.
It’s frustrating and tiring at times but Tony knows there are way worse things to be feeling.
The image shows the Avengers’ common floor, specifically its living room. It’s not very different from his own, its architecture identical and the furniture in both in the same style, but contrary to his living room, the common one tends to go unused, as does all of that floor, because the group doesn't spend much time together at the Tower or otherwise. They’ve recently instated shared meals once every other week and at least twice a week they try to all get together to train different team aspects but aside from that, the Avengers’ members don’t set foot on that floor for anything.
Hours later or days later or years later, the room’s door opens and the lights turn on, notifying Tony of Steve’s arrival.
goes unsaid but Tony knows Steve hears it all the same.
“When he fell from the train… I know it’s stupid to say because we were in the middle of a war, but I didn’t think I would lose him,” Steve laments. “It took me by surprise and I regretted not having done more, not being the leader and friend he needed.” Steve scoffs. “And then I made the exact same mistake again. I thought we’d have more time to solve everything, to get him better and to work on our friendship. But I was just a coward, though. I was just avoiding facing something that made me uncomfortable.”
Tony wakes up when Steve kisses him goodbye before leaving for the city. It’s very early, the sun rising slowly in the sky, bathing Tony’s room in yellow and orange hues as Steve closes the door behind him. Tony stays in bed and even manages to fall asleep for another hour, the warmth of the comforter making him reluctant to get up.
When his eyes open again and his body has stopped feeling like it’s floating away, Tony comes back to the present just in time to watch Steve stroking himself a few more times before he comes as well. He comes into his hand and Steve immediately brings it to Tony’s stomach, mixing his come with Tony’s. It’s such a possessive gesture and Tony shudders.
“Wow, okay, I didn’t mean to make all that sound so poetic.”
“She’s really excited about this, guys.” Clint commented while delicately hip checking his girlfriend, who didn’t look remorseful or ashamed. “She’s been planning it for months so you better not let her down.”
needed them. But I never thought I’d have to choose the Accords over anyone in the team. It was always supposed to be Avengers business. All of the Avengers.”
“There’s still a long way to go but… I think we’re doing well this time.”
It’s nothing new, nothing shocking. But it means everything just the same.
Tony is holding a mug full of one of Bruce’s favorite teas when Steve walks into the kitchen, steam still rising from the hot liquid. His eyes are lost on some faraway point, as is his mind, and he only realizes Steve has arrived when the man taps him on the shoulder to greet him.
Determination in the middle of his chest.
_______________________________
Steve quickly kneeled and took another one of his already prepared snowballs in his hands. He stood up and saw Natasha making her way to Sam. She was still far enough from Sam to be a good lone target so Steve rapidly aimed and threw his snowball at her.
“I didn’t even realize I had taken one of your shirts.”
The air feels clearer now, more breathable, but there’s still a thin, transparent sheet separating Steve and Tony. They’re existing in the same place but it feels as if it’s not the same realm of time. There’s too many unspoken things, too many issues that need to be uncovered.
“Okay. Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?”
“Well, I don't understand why you want to sleep apart,” Tony chides.
Wait, is Steve still talking to him?
Pepper’s the one to take the first step and break the silence.
Pepper and Rhodey look at each other and share radiant smiles, their faces shining brighter that Steve’s ever seen them.
Tony is alive.
(Steve ends up cooking for Tony more than one of his mom’s recipes and they both wind up declaring Sarah Rogers really was that good of a cook.
“Nino’s,” Steve grunts, a deep sound ripped from his throat, almost too lascivious to be made in public.
“I know that,” Natasha confirms. “I didn't defend you because I had to but because I wanted to. What he said isn’t true and I have no problems letting him know that.”
“I wanted to do that,” Tony says, pointing to Steve’s dick, now soft and hanging out of Steve’s underwear that he never even got around to taking off.
Steve extends his arm, offering the gift to Tony. He feels like he’s moving through molasses when he reaches over and takes the package from Steve’s hand.
Tony doesn’t hesitate before doing so, knowing that his body has been particularly sensitive to extreme temperatures since his trip in space.
Before Steve had dismissed the idea of JARVIS sounding worried but there is no denying now that JARVIS’ tone of voice sounds wistful and in just a second Steve comprehends that JARVIS misses Tony. He misses him in the same human and real way that Pepper and Rhodey do.
“Close it,” he orders Natasha and she obeys.
Not a family of obligation by blood, like his parents, not family of choice that through love and work you keep even though it is a thousands of miles away almost everyday, like Rhodey, but a family of building bonds, extensive learning, extreme proximity, rough edges and intense companionship.
“Maybe I should have gone for you first, huh?” Clint’s voice gets crueler each sentence but it also lowers itself, coming out rougher. “You’re no better than all tho—”
“Do I have something on my face?”
The world is in shambles and it’s been in shambles for a while now.
And if there’s one thing he knows it’s that. Pepper loves him and he loves her even if they don’t have the best track record at loving each other.
His eyes are now open and they show a fire within them that Tony hasn't seen in a long, long time. Clint has leaned forward on his seat on the couch, his elbows resting on his knees and his hands clutching each other tightly. Natasha places a comforting yet placating hand on his left shoulder.
It feels stupid to think about but if there could have been one person to fit every single one of those impossible things it would have been Tony.
“I don’t really want to have a party,” Tony confesses, his voice a whisper. He almost sounds guilty about it.
They talk a little bit more about things but Tony stays away from the topic of Peter’s death again, not ready to revisit it.
“Trusting me and telling me that,” Steve answers. “I know it isn’t easy to let other people see you vulnerable. I especially know it isn’t easy for you and me.”
And it does.
“Please.”
Tony, well versed in the art of Natasha-speak, reads a “Fair enough” in her eyes.
For Tony, most of all. Steve would love the opportunity to just grant Tony the opportunity to keep living because that’s simply what he deserved.
The light’s name -the
But the time he spent with Pepper through video-conference was tense and awkward and Tony’s been having to work hard at repressing his feelings about the matter all day.
“I still feel guilty for how I talked to him,” Natasha confesses. “I just want to help him, not make things more difficult for him.”
He hates being the leader now, here, in the middle of this battlefield, a space portal open right above them as hundreds and hundreds of horrendous alien creatures are trying to destroy New York.
“I guess…” Steve murmurs. “I guess I can hold off on shaving for a little while longer.”
There’s been something about their stay here that has made them more sharp, more in sync, more aware of the other. They’ve grown into each other and themselves, flourishing and thriving. It’s like they’re more Steve and Tony here, both separately and together, like Rome was always the place meant to watch them love each other, like for generations each corner and crevice of the city had been waiting for their presence and both the city and them had finally been made whole.
“I know his parents are dead but… Did he have anyone we should talk to?”
“Really?” Steve asks, his voice small.
“There’s going to be other days like that,” Tony points out. “Other days when we’re both not at our best. And we need to handle them better. I can’t jump at every little thing you say and you can’t close yourself off from everything.”
Pepper soon exits the bathroom and Tony moves his eyes away from the ceiling to look at her as she starts changing into her night clothes.
“You made a decision when you took on the role of Ronin and that decision has consequences. You will face those consequences, Clint, I will make sure of that,” Natasha states. “But you think I went through all this trouble to get you back just because of that? I just wanted my best friend back. I wanted you here with me so we could support each other.”
Tony can hear him snore when he walks by the door to his room, the one that was made especially for him but he never used except for the couple of days after Thanos when everyone used the Compound as home base.
Tony uses the hand that was cleaning Steve’s tears to cup his cheek and bring Steve’s face closer to his. He rests his forehead against Steve’s forehead, and now their bodies are so close Tony can bodily feel the quakes going through Steve’s muscles.
“I’m sorry,” he says, firmly and decidedly.
It takes Steve about 5 seconds to find the perfect angle for the picture he’s about to take. The sun looks to be propped on his left shoulder and its glow is soft enough that it doesn't create a glare in the picture but still potent enough to almost cast him in an ethereal light.
Natasha doesn’t mince or sugarcoat her words and the shock that goes through his body makes it feel like the room has suddenly turned a hundred degrees hotter.
Steve’s gift gets placed on Tony’s bedside table and every morning when he wakes up Tony makes sure it is the first thing he sees.
Natasha’s both eyebrows raise and she nods, “Right, right. Steve’s clothes on the floor. Got it.”
Tony and Steve looked at each other, searching for answers in the other’s eyes. After only a couple of seconds Tony turned back to the group to answer Clint, a small smile showing on his lips.
The other part of him, the bigger part of him, has been reshaped and reborn since coming back from space and having had to live in a world reshaped and reborn too. The way he blew up at Steve had been satisfactory and necessary for Tony’s own peace of mind but it had also been fueled by the feeling of desperation inside him and the knowledge that if there was anyone in the world he could make the target of his hate that would be Steve, who’d rise to the bait and kick back at him.
It’s torture and it’s a torture so poignant and so perfectly designed for him that it can obviously only come from his own mind.
It’s late at night, much later than Tony has grown accustomed to going to bed, and they’re alone in the kitchen. Rhodey insisted he wanted chocolate chip cookies and he was very stubborn about needing them to be made from scratch. Now, they’re waiting for the cookies to be ready to be taken out from the oven while they munch away at some of the leftover egg-less cookie dough.
“I used sex as an escape when I was younger,” Tony comments as the TV shows a group of hosts discussing Tony’s recent return and his past misgivings. “I could count on both hands the number of times I truly enjoyed it apart of when I was with Pepper.”
Steve gets a missed call to his cell phone from a number he doesn’t have saved and when he asks JARVIS if he can find out who it was JARVIS tells him, “That’s Sir’s mobile number, Captain.”
“What time is it?”
“So you decided to adopt him,” Steve teases.
see you with that beard but now I’m praying there are some pictures.”
“This is a thousand times better than before,” is what Natasha says about it every time the issue comes up.
His mug is almost half-empty when the sound of steps reaches his ears. He’s both eagerly praying and dreading the moment the steps reach the kitchen. He wants it to be Steve. He doesn't want it to be Steve.
And it’s something in Steve’s eyes, in the slight tremble of his voice, in the infinitesimal space between their knees and the way the sun is bathing the room in a golden light. It’s something in the way they both lost so much and yet they still have each other. It’s something in their shared pasts but it’s more something in their upcoming futures. It’s something unexplainable and inimitable that makes Tony do exactly that. He believes Steve.
“You haven’t lost Pepper,” Rhodey reminds him. “It didn’t work between you guys but you’ll always have each other.”
The way his body meets Pepper’s is completely the opposite of what meeting Steve’s was. It’s slow and soft, timid at first, even.
Pepper smiles softly and Steve thinks he can see her flush a little under the light make-up she’s wearing.
He bends his back and rotates his shoulders until he hears them crack to relieve himself of the stiffness accumulated in them.
The conversation in the kitchen pauses and Tony shouts back, “Can you check what it says?”
“So yeah, there is something building between us,” Tony confirms. “I know it’s there and, even though we haven’t talked about it ,I know Steve knows it too. But I don’t what I’ll do about it.”
And it is. Tony has never seen Steve with this much facial hair before.
Tony finds himself being the one seeking Steve more often, especially as his own schedule starts freeing up. He’s the one who sits quietly next to Steve while he does class work, or texting him in the middle of the day simply to remind him Tony’s still there for him.
Tony had turned around quickly and had been greeted by the brightest smile he had ever encountered.
Tony doesn’t really know what to say, and although he could blame it on his sleepy state he knows it has everything to do with the bluntness and decisiveness of Steve’s statement. It shouldn’t surprise him because if there’s one person in the world capable of leaving him speechless that’s always been Steve Rogers. He just wasn't expecting it to happen now, in this moment that by itself, without any words, already seems to hold so much significance.
Tony raises an eyebrow and a foggy image makes way in his mind: Steve, saying that same exact word as Tony hit the floor and lost consciousness.
There’s nothing more important than the views of the people that love him.
As Tony raises his head he can distinctively make out a shape coming towards them at rapid speed and even through his hazy vision Tony is able to recognize that run perfectly. He’d be able to recognize that run anytime and anyplace.
Bruce thanks him softly but quickly turns away, looking towards the horizon, his gaze focusing on what appears to be nothing more than air and some trees on the far off distance. He’s taking deep breaths and he’s following in the rhythm of them with his hands.
“Things seem easy for a while and then something -anything- happens and we’re reminded that nothing is easy anymore.” Steve’s speech has no clear beginning or order but Tony parses through it easily enough and understands each of its nuisances and meanings. “I’m slowly coming to terms with the fact that I couldn't help the people that are gone but it’s so much more difficult when I feel like I can’t help the people that are still here.”
He’s always either been God or Lucifer himself. A savior or a sinner. The solution or the actual problem.
Natasha sounds chocked up, her voice full of pain and regret. Tony has seen her vulnerable before but never like this, never so vulnerable she forgets to even hide it. Or maybe it’s not that she’s forgotten. Maybe this is what the fight has taken from her, the desire to hide herself from everyone.
As he hides his face in the crook of her neck and takes a deep breath he feels Steve’s arms finally pulling away from his body. They don’t leave abruptly, but gently, Steve’s hands grazing Tony’s shoulders and back before completely retreating.
The only thing that has really connected them to the world outside the compound has been the grief that everyone in the entire world has been feeling, no one actually spared from once.
“Thanks,” Steve says to him and he smiles softly at hearing his name for the first time from Tony’s mouth.
Not for the first time in his life Tony feels undeserving of him, but he allows this one good thing to warm him from the top of his head to the tips of his toes and he holds up his right hand towards his best friend.
It’s a testament to how engrossed he is in his musings that he doesn’t hear the elevator’s door opening and Tony’s steps as he enters the living room and gets closer to the couch.
“Oh, alright,” Tony accepts. “Then hello.”
Tony’s mind shuts down completely on everything that is not
His toes curl, his back bends and rises from the mattress, his lungs stop working for a few seconds.  He’s falling, falling, falling. Fortunately, Steve is there to catch him.
_______________________________
“It’s okay,” Tony interrupts, trying to spare Steve the pain of tangling himself up more on his words. And also trying to spare himself further blushing than the one he can already feel growing on his cheeks. “I know what you meant.”
“I just,” he starts saying, hesitating. “Everyone’s so excited about it. I don’t want to ruin their fun.”
Steve’s breaths are quieter now than before but they still feel terribly loud in the stillness that surrounds them.
“I’ve always kept tabs on our kind of stuff around the world, you know? Possible superheroes, vigilantes, people this close to going off the rails and becoming super-villains…” Tony puts his fingers really close together, almost touching. “Sometimes I decide it’s not worth it to intervene. So what if the Punisher is walking around like a madman killing every single criminal in his near vicinity? So what if there’s another billionaire playing at being a hero? A robot suit is ten times cooler than a glowing fist, anyway.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, halfway between sitting and standing, like he wants to be closer to Tony but he doesn't want to impose.
“I don’t know,” Steve confesses and he looks surprised by his lack of concrete response. “There’s so many things to talk about.”
It feels like the moment, not the perfect one but the appropriate one, to do something Tony has been meaning to do for weeks.
Tony smiles at her and sees how she looks over his shoulder toward the kitchen entrance. Tony turns around to find Steve there, when he had previously walked away from the kitchen when they’d finished eating.
Tony shakes his head in amazement and he slowly gets to his feet, not even noticing when Bruce’s shirt end up at his feet on the grass.
A soft touch to his shoulder is what starts anchoring him back, what puts his wailing and battered soul back into his body.
It’s the worst kind of torture and the sweetest sight Steve’s ever set his eyes on.
_______________________________
He wants Steve to know he’s ready and willing to hear anything Steve has to say. He
“The universe is immense, yes, but they’ve scoured every last bit of it,” Tony reminds him. “I can’t… I physically can’t stop looking for a way to fix this. I think I’ll die if I stop trying. But the chances of finding a way… A solution… An answer… Steve, you didn’t mean to but you’ve made people believe something that isn't true.”
Steve’s closes his eyes mostly on instinct but he opens them again quickly to check that this is not a dream or a hallucination, that Tony really is kissing him.
“It’s not my fault but I’m not exactly faultless, you know?”
“You say annoying, I say particular,” Tony argues, hitting Steve’s spoon with his.
It takes him just 3 seconds to spot Miss Potts seated at one of the tables further in the back, her attention solely on the cellphone in her hand. She’s dressed a lot more casually than she was at the funeral, which of course makes a lot of sense, but it’s not the kind of fashion Steve would have pegged her to wear. She’s in just a plain, long-sleeved white t-shirt and jeans, her hair pulled back in a ponytail. She looks a lot more approachable that Steve has ever seen her, even if 95% of the times he’s caught glimpses of her it has been through a television.
“Would you like to see it?” Bruce finally asks.
“You did it,” Tony says.
There’s nothing happy about the day for Tony, there’s nothing happy about the day for the people around him and there’s nothing happy about the day for the world.
The movies had been an accident and a sort of salvation.
“This is the best thing I have ever seen in my thousands of years of live,” Thor proclaims, looking  brighter than he has since he came into the Compound and making Bruce snort at the comment.
Tony can’t make out his features well from so far enough but his hair looks longer than last time he saw him, however not as long as when the Avengers were first formed. It reaches his chin and covers a lot of his face but it doesn’t look clean or kept at all. In fact, Thor himself doesn’t look clean or kept. His clothes look old and they don’t match: grey, stocky cardigan; black sweatpants that drag over his feet; what look to be checkered home slippers.
Tears gather in his eyes as he tells Tony how they had found out that Thanos had destroyed the Stones, that the trip had been in vain because there was no way they could fix what, according to Thanos, had always been meant to happen.
This is the first time Tony hears her voice in person after so long, but before he can look at her and catch a glimpse of her expression the lights turn off and they’re plunged into complete darkness.
The sun is peeking through the clouds and replacing the darkness but Tony’s still deep into his oblivion.
“Losing you,” Tony blurts out before his brain can even warn him about what a bad idea it is to say it. “I don’t want to lose you.”
“Thank you,” Steve says.
“Oh yeah,” Tony says as he moves from the floor.
Everything is dark because of the black-out mode on the windows he had FRIDAY set before he got into bed, but his phone tells him it’s 4:11AM so, even if the windows were in normal mode, Tony would only be able to glimpse the moon and the stars high in the night sky.
They hadn’t explicitly said it but it had been a tacit agreement that there would be no gift exchange at the Compound for the holidays and, up until this moment, Tony believed they had all complied to it.
Steve thinks, imagining how they would both look on camera as they lose themselves on this embrace where only they exist and the rest of the world fades away.
“He spends his days drinking and not doing much else. At least I’m a helpful drinker at the moment,” Valkyrie says and Tony respects her self-awareness greatly. “He won’t want to leave Asgard and its people but he can’t do anything for us in the state he’s in.”
Pepper and Steve walk side by side to the kitchen, where Pepper deposits the wine bottle and her glass on the counter and then moves towards one of the cupboards. She has to stand on her tiptoes to grab another glass and then she closes the cupboard and moves back closer to where Steve has stopped.
Tony knows better than anyone how much of a safe space a private bedroom can become to a person.
Avoidance isn’t what’s keeping them from having sex. They’ve toed the line, made it all the way to the edge before retreating back to safety. It’s more something like anticipation mixed with a little bit of caution. It’s wanting to savor the moments leading up to it but also giving themselves time to mentally prepare themselves.
A blessing.
“Yeah, okay,” Tony accepts. “I think they’d like that. I think…I’d like that.”
Rhodey extends his arms to grab Tony’s hands in his.
but Tony knows.
Steve’s heart stops for a second and then restarts beating in his chest as it has been doing lately every time Tony is remotely mentioned in any kid of situation. And every time he sees Tony walk into a room. And every time Tony smiles at him. And every time he thinks about Tony.
The last time Tony and Natasha saw each other things hadn’t quite gone horribly wrong yet but they were about to do so, the team had already been split up and Steve and Tony were about to apply the last nail to the team’s coffin.
“Fuck,” Tony groans, biting the inside of his cheeks when he feels his dick spluttering pre-come. “Yes, yes, yes.”
There is nothing to thank Thanos for, but to say he was wrong about the changes the planet would go through after his plan followed through would be a bold-faced lie.
Pepper’s arms wrap around his waist and Tony brings one of his hands up to her long hair, burying his fingers deep in it, feeling the smooth strands with his fingertips.
“I don’t-“
Tony takes a fistful of popcorn and brings it over to his mouth.
If Tony had to give a rough estimate of the number of people that have congregated in front of the White House for the memorial he would confidently say there are around 2 million people that have come from all over the country for this. Probably also from all over the world.
of this: Thanos, getting over Thanos, rebuilding your kingdom…” Tony continues. “You can’t do it alone. And alcohol isn't the best companion. Maybe we’re not the people you want by your side but we’re the ones you have, so…”
“You’d make a great dad, Tony,” Pepper declares.
As soon as the screen turns off and Steve can no longer see light coming from it, he puts his phone back into his pocket.
The man’s gaze was intense, making Steve feel hot even in the cold winter weather. He shook his head and a small smile grazed his lips.
Rhodey stays with him through the night, sleeping in the pull-out couch specifically set in the room for situations like this one.
When Natasha knocks on the workshop doors this time it sounds almost hesitant, like she's just gracing her knuckles against the glass softly, almost like a caress.
Tony lives in a world where there is little rest to be had until he can bring back the people he lost.
Oxygen is running out and Tony can feel it in every inch of his body.
As the number of tears become impossible to count Tony’s touch becomes more purposeful, soft caresses that run through Steve’s blonde hair and that serve to remind him he’s not floating away. This touch is the only useful thing he can provide right now, a slice of comfort, a glimpse of peace.
The impact must have been harder than Tony anticipated because Steve lets out a light grunt as Tony’s body meets his own but he doesn’t hesitate to put his arms around him and support him.
Tony closes the door again and he turns his back on it, resting against it for a second as he takes a calming breath.
His mind has always been able to conjure up the weirdest of sensations, the strangest and deepest fears Tony never even knows he has in the first place. The bottom of the ocean, for example. Tony hadn't even been aware of it being a possible issue for him but here he is, feeling stuck like it’s really happening, like this is really the one thing that’s going to kill him.
Tony brings his hands to his face, covering it completely with his palms. He tries to regulate his breathing by exhaling and inhaling deeply through his mouth. Getting over nightmares will never be easy but Tony’s had enough practice by now to know the things that work better for him.
“I thought you’d like to know that Thor and Valkyrie have just arrived at the Compound.”
This time they made the right decision.
, he was about to say. But that isn’t true. He knows it, and he never wants to do Steve the disservice of lying about it to him. One of the reasons they’ve been able to move past it is because they’ve both been clear and honest about that time.
Without any hesitation Tony takes to the sky, leaving the memorial and Steve’s words behind but not being able to get rid of the sinking feeling ingrained inside him.
Until Tony breaks it by bursting out laughing.
Tony can’t see if Steve’s eyes are opened or closed but it wouldn’t matter anyway because from his position he can’t tell Tony is now directly looking at him and Tony guesses that’s why he keeps weeping loudly.
“We do,” Tony confirms. “We really do.”
His voice is weak but it sounds too loud in the otherwise silent room.
But Tony’s impatient, and his need to touch Steve far outweighs his desire to just look at him.
He hates the constant anxiety of not knowing if his decision is the right one or not. He hates the guilt that comes when things don’t go according to plan and he can’t help but ponder over and over and over again the things he could have done differently, the things he could have made others do differently.
Steve doesn’t say anything else after that, doesn’t offer any kind of explanation about his unexpected presence or his demeanor.
Time is irrelevant and he forgets to check how many hours pass as he pretends to be handling things well. It’s a minute and a year all in one.
Their relationship nowadays could call for a thousand and one favors that Tony would grant easily and gladly but there’s something in Natasha’s demeanor and the way she came to them almost ceremoniously that speaks to the magnitude of what she’s going to ask of them.
Before Tony even realizes it, lunch time comes and goes. Only at 4pm does he have time to make his way from his office to the kitchen to heat up one of the prepared meals Steve always keeps the Compound stocked with. He eats in the living room, sat in the sofa while watching the news on TV.
It seems like he can’t do anything right, like he’s stuck in a place where every decision he makes can only cause more problems and never bring forth any solutions. If he avoids Steve then he’s hurting him, and hurting their friendship, too. And, being honest with himself, Tony can admit he’s hurting himself too. But if he doesn't avoid Steve he runs the risk of hurting them both in the long run, damaging their friendship as well.
“Complicated?” Rhodey echoes and Tony chuckles.
His ears are ringing and he can’t even hear his own voice but he thinks he might be yelling.
His name.
The thin, transparent sheet drops completely and finally it’s just Steve and Tony, nothing in-between them.
They’re three very busy days but the hectic nature of them is not actually what keeps Tony from telling his friends. He knows that Natasha and Steve suspect something, but the moment he finally says it out-loud, the moment it’s not just something they can guess but something he confirms, that is the moment everything becomes completely real.
Steve tilts his head in confusion at the name. JARVIS never calls Steve Sir, only Captain or Captain Rogers, no matter how many times Steve’s tried to get him to just call him by his first name. Sir is the name JARVIS used for Tony and Steve knows he would never use it for anyone else.
Steve moves his gaze away from the sky and locks his eyes with Tony’s.
There’s no conscious thinking on his part when Steve rushes forwards and wraps Tony in a hug, he just does it. The fireworks exploding in his stomach and the static playing in his brain have left him incapable of anything but murmur Tony’s name over and over again.
no expectations, no promises. For the first time in maybe all of his life, Tony has felt like the little boy fixing his broken radio at the age of 5 while wearing a suit in a room full of people that don’t care at all about what’s behind the fabric, all because Steve was at the other end of the room, encouraging smile waiting to be looked at.
“We don’t have to tackle everything right now,” Tony reassures him. “We’ve got time.”
Tony has been trying with all of his might not to think of the situation but soon, the situation is all he can really think about.
Tony doesn’t need prompting this time to open up.
He tries to say “Cap” once again but just like before his voice won’t respond to his commands.
Such a short sentence can have so many different meanings, Tony knows, and he’s got a feeling that Steve is more than aware as well of the ambiguousness of his statement. The words are said rather solemnly and a little abruptly after the silence that had accompanied them before.
“Yes,” he confesses. “And I’ve been avoiding Pepper and Rhodey too. But not because I hate you. And not because I want to stop being friends with them because I hate you.”
Natasha is not subtle when she rolls her eyes at him and it painfully reminds him of days and nights spent at the Tower before the whole ordeal with Ultron happened, when one of the guys would do something extremely loud, boisterous or reckless and Natasha would reprimand them with a simple,
at around mid afternoon. Steve chuckles lightly and then goes on uploading his selfie to the conversation.
, now just Tony and Pepper.
“You didn’t even let me catch a glimpse while you changed. Spoilsport.”
“Okay, so now that I’ve got Cap’s approval I’m going to go do that and not be here.”
He only needs to look at the three people in front of him once to know that they’re all aware already of what he’s going to so. It’s written plainly in their expressions, in the way Bruce’s smile is sorrowful, in the way Natasha is biting her bottom lip to stop it from trembling. It’s quite obvious in the way Steve’s face looks soft, almost sweet. He’s not radiating pity, or sadness back at Tony and that’s probably what gives him strength.
“I don’t know, that’s all the note says. He didn't talk to me about leaving,” Steve says.
There’s disappointment, of course there is. And blame is thrown around at them a few times. But for the most part the Avengers are a very tiny part of the discussion.
Clint tries to stand from his position on the couch but Natasha grabs his shoulder, pushing him down and preventing him to do so as she takes a seat next to him.
This is not something Steve has always been able to recognize and it is not something he’s always been able to appreciate properly.
Steve is surprised by the speed of his own thoughts. If he had had to guess before he would have thought he’d have problems coming up with the right words and phrases. Of the two of them Tony is always the more talkative one in bed but there is something about imagining Tony halfway across the world reading this and feeling aroused that makes everything spill out of Steve’s mind easily.
Tony stands swiftly, leaving his projects behind and following Natasha as she cuts a path towards Bruce’s room.
“But it’s still your choice,” Tony whispers as he pulls his arm out from the leather straps and holds the shield from its edge with his hands. He brings it forward towards Steve. An offering but not exactly a gift. Maybe a surrendering of sorts.
He’s supposed to be alone in the Compound. Natasha is in Washington for a meeting and Clint went with her, Thor’s been gone for the past week visiting New Asgard, Bruce left in the morning for a volunteer mission to South American regions that were disproportionally affected by the Decimation; and Steve is supposed to be in a group therapy session like he’s been doing every Wednesday for the past 2 months.
And he starts laughing again, his laughter mixing with Steve’s, creating a not very harmonious pattern that Tony wishes he could record and play forever.
Not all the remaining Avengers have come for remembrance to DC today. Natasha, Bruce, Rhodey and Tony stand behind Steve in a gesture of unconditional support. Clint never responded when Natasha knocked on his door before they all had to leave the Compound in the jet. Thor still isn't replying to any of Bruce’s messages and calls.
Dating Steve is even easier than what Tony used to consider the easy points of his life.
Steve laughs and that plus the slight pinkish color his face continues wearing calls Tony to kiss him sweetly on the nose. Steve wrinkles his nose in mocked disgust but he firmly holds Tony close to him.
There’s so much inside him that eventually it has to be released and it comes out in the form of a sob. As it escapes his throat Steve incorporates in bed and his shoulders shake as more and more sobs rip through him. There’s no tears but there is pain, so much pain that gets worse and worse as Steve can’t gulp down any air.
It took Steve a really long time to come to terms with his new reality and the benefits of it but he’s learnt not to blame himself for it.
Steve asks himself as he goes through one of the books on PTSD and anxiety that JARVIS recommended him.
It was a give and take. A dance and a stumble.
He thinks about calling Rhodey. He doesn’t.
This is something Steve and Tony have taken to doing in their months of cohabitation at Avengers Compound. Sometimes in the morning, at times in the early afternoon and sometimes at night just like in this moment they make their way around the extensive area of the Compound at a steady but leisure pace.
“Oh, Steve, yes,” Pepper replies excitedly. “One hundred percent.”
“I haven’t been to see him. I’m so scared. And so regretful.”
As he wraps a towel around his waist he rubs the fingers of his right hand together, getting distracted by the weird and mesmerizing sensation of his wrinkled and mushy skin.
“Would you—“ Steve starts and then clears his throat again. “I have something I want to show you.”
His question was one of genuine concern and interest but Steve’s response makes it clear that that isn't how he took the meaning of it. In any other situation, Tony likes to think that he’d be more understanding, that he would see through Steve’s own anger and realize the words aren’t really about him at all. But the situation is what it is and Tony definitely takes it personally.
“That’s what we needed, Cap. Protection. And I needed you. I said we’d lose and you said we’d do that together too. Well, guess what? We lost and you weren’t even there! None of the Avengers were even there with me! Together. HA!”
Rhodey smiles at him and squeezes his hands before letting go of them and grabbing one more cookie from the plate. Tony smiles back at him but his mind is a million miles away. Further even than he’s ever physically been.
The sneakiness of depression and its way of sucking the life out of everything. Tony’s familiar with it.
The woman gets up then and in an action too fast for Tony to stop, takes his mug and places it into the dishwasher along hers.
The paper starts giving away easily and Tony feels badly about ripping into it so much instead of unwrapping the gift carefully but Steve doesn't look concerned so he keeps going.
Rhodey says Steve’s one of the funniest people he has ever met. Steve doesn't think this is one of the things most people would comment on about him but his and Rhodey’s sense of humor match almost perfectly. They’re both sarcastic but it’s a little dry, almost too serious to be understood as real humor some times.
Tony groans and he turns over again, leaving himself staring up at the ceiling.
“That’s so sweet,” she tells him. “I can just imagine all the little kids dressing up as Captain America even then.”
He comes to a halt abruptly when he spots Valkyrie but he quickly seems to gather Thor is sitting on the couch and he won’t be able to see him unless he steps around it. He does so quickly and he places himself right in front of the spot where Thor is now incorporating himself. Tony can see Bruce’s fists tighten at his sides and his face closes off completely.
In his haste to escape his room Tony forgot to take his robe with him but he feels okay in just his old-ratty t-shirt -that might have belonged to Rhodey long ago- and the pair of boxers he’s wearing.
He’s losing consciousness now, his eyes closing of their own volition.
Steve’s head shake is almost imperceptible but Tony manages to catch it, probably because of how focused he is on Steve’s every movement at the moment.
Getting to his room is an uphill battle. It’s like having to climb Mount Everest while carrying all the bodies of the people he’s had to watch die on his back. Jarvis, who he has been missing for so many years. JARVIS, who he never in a million years thought he would have to mourn one day. His mom, both the caring and the detached parts of her. Yinsen, and even Yinsen’s family despite the fact that he never knew them. Peter.
“Hey, guys,” Steve laughs. “It’s good to see you.”
Steve releases a huff of air that is not really a chuckle but denotes certain amusement at the reference.
When they came out and the world was shook to its core because its two most famous superheroes had announced their love Tony had made sure to constantly remind him of the beauty of the world and the impact of their actions by handing him letters written by inspired teenagers, he had played Youtube videos of come-out stories made possible by their own step forward and had proved to him that he was so lucky to be living in a time were he could take Tony’s hand proudly in the street and more people cheered for them that resented them.
He pulls on the hand that is holding Steve’s and brings it over to his chest, resting the back of Steve’s hand against where the arc reactor sits when it’s hooked to his chest.
Once Pepper is dressed she walks over to the bed and settles down on the right side of Tony.
He stays silent and waits for Steve to continue because if they’re going to be having this conversation Tony is in no condition to be bearing the heavy weight of it.
It’s family because no other people would make him and Steve as secure in each other as them. There’s no other people that would make Tony feel comfortable enough to fall asleep cuddled up to Steve in front of them. There’s no other people Steve or him would let see them at their most vulnerable with each other.
But his thoughts are a tangled mess in his head and it reminds him so much of how he was when he had just gotten out of the ice, back when he believed he would never belong here.
Tony turns around as soon as Steve’s done saying his name and Steve’s breath catches in his lungs.
The night does start off a little awkwardly for Steve.
Tony’s almost all the way to their room when Steve’s parting words finally register to him. He continues walking on a daze, his brain replaying the words over and over and over. The cadence of them, the tone, the inflection on each of the syllables.
Suddenly, a sob breaks out of Steve. It comes from the deepest parts of his chest and it tears him apart.
He looks in love.
“Yes,” Tony answers without hesitation.
When it’s Steve’s turn to take a chunk of ice cream Tony pulls his spoon away, imitating Steve and bringing it over to his chest. That’s how they eat the ice cream for the next few minutes, taking turns and eyeing each other carefully and suspiciously, waiting for the other to make a sudden move.
“I know, Tony, of course I know,” Steve rushes to say. “You weren't being difficult on accident either. It was just bad timing. You had a bad day and I had a bad day and that just… It didn’t mesh well.”
Miss Potts gently waves the hand that was previously shaking his.
“I prefer it when you call me Steve,” Steve clarifies. “Please.”
Since the Decimation happened almost a month ago now -only one more day until they hit that painful anniversary- everyone that surrounds him has been submersed in trying to counteract what happened, in trying to fix the world, in putting on their hero suits and fighting the good fight one more time.
Natasha breaks their eye contact as she clears her throat, extends her arm to grab her glass of water and takes a sip from it.
The fight never ends.
He does, feeling grateful for the way the water eases the dryness away but still feeling chocked up.
“Excuse me?”
Tony looks at them and at their wistfully sad faces and he extends his hand to grab Natasha’s ankles where her legs are now extended on the bed. She turns her head to look at him and he knows he doesn't need to say anything. He understand her and she understands him. It’s one of the few things they’ve always known about each other even when they didn't want to admit to it.
Tony walks to the kitchen to get himself a glass of water and another couple of pieces of pepperoni pizza. He’s gone for less than a minute but when he comes back Carol -who is on Earth on official universal Avenger business- is hanging off of Bruce’s left arm, her feet maybe 5 feet off the ground. She’s laughing as she dangles her body back and forth and Tony realizes in that moment this is the first time he has ever seen her laugh. It makes sense, of course, given that most of their communication still happens through Natasha and it’s almost always Decimation and/or Avengers related. But the way her smile makes her whole presence seem lighter reminds Tony that they’re all people whose lives and identities are much more than what Thanos first reduced them to.
Her voice comes from somewhere to Tony’s right and Tony turns in Steve’s grip towards that sound, like a lighthouse is showing him his way back to shore.
“You’ve been avoiding me,” Tony states, bypassing any kind of small talk.
Tony was so much more than Steve could have known.
“Remember the time when we all lived at the Tower for a while?” Steve had asked, as if Tony would ever be able to forget. “That was probably when I had the most time for it. And well… You helped a lot.”
. The super soldier is just wearing a white towel wrapped around his waist and Tony still gets as hypnotized as the first day he saw Steve naked. It is impossible not to focus on the way the water droplets make their way down Steve’s neck and chest until they disappear behind the offending white cloth his boyfriend is wearing.
It becomes unavoidable during dinner when Natasha is telling them of the contracts Stark Industries signed with one of her charities to provide them with free hospital machinery for one of their locations in Europe.
“Yeah, that’s normally what happens when one goes days without sleep.” The teasing is light-hearted and makes Tony chuckle. “C’mon,” Steve signals, pushing Tony’s pants down his legs.
Steve wastes no time in exiting the workshop. He opts to use the stairs instead of the elevator, knowing that if he uses his full speed he will get there faster that JARVIS could ever take him.
Before, Natasha was the closest thing Steve had to a right-hand man but he didn’t feel like he could completely let go of all his inhibitions and lean on her. It wasn't that he didn't trust her because he did, no doubt in his mind about it. It was something else that was holding him back, some unseeable and unexplainable pull that never let him give up that much control of himself and of his team.
How can you love someone you never really knew?
Tony thinks he maybe will take him up on that offer. He also thinks he will be making it back to Steve sometime soon.
“You know what I need? I need a shave.”
“It doesn’t.” The red-head shrugs. “It’s
Steve clears his throat before he brings his right hand over to the glass to knock on it and alert Tony of his presence.
first and that had been killing him up inside.
It’s true that Natasha did act as Steve’s right hand during the brief time Tony retired from the field, but it’s also true that he never really completely stopped his involvement with the Avengers and their activities.
Tony nods and finally looks into Steve’s eyes. “Yeah, sorry. I just remembered I had a call with Rhodey tonight,” he improvises. “Can’t believe I forgot.”
“I told you about human Jarvis, right?” Tony inquires and Steve nods. “He tried to teach me to cook and pasta was the only thing that really stuck. God, I miss his cooking.”
glad.”
“Look, guys,” he says. “I know maybe this won’t work, okay? I don’t even know what I should be trying to make work. Do I want him to come back? Do I want him to at least call us? I don’t know.”
Home.
“We can call the restaurant for take-out and in the time it will take to get here it’ll almost be lunch time,” Tony explains.
It’s rectangular, and Tony would think it could be a book if he wasn’t holding it and sensing it’s too light for that. The way it feels even through the paper is also wrong. The touch and shape feel familiar but he’s only holding the corner of it and through his muddled brain it feels difficult to guess.
It’s always the same.
He doesn’t elaborate on what exactly he means by
Steve picks Tony up from the couch and carries him the entire way to their bedroom with his legs around his waist.
They look good, the sun gorgeous in its last show of the day and the city magnificent in its vastness, but they’re not the best pictures Steve has taken, nothing compared to the beauty he has been able to capture in some of his favorite pictures he keeps in his phone.
The difference in food is also something that still astounds him and he finds himself overwhelmed with choices and flavors.
_______________________________
They’re supposed to help each other. And that means that, some times, things are going to get ugly and difficult for one of them and the other will have to dirty himself up to push the other one through.
Tony lets himself lay down on the bed without thinking too much about it when the clock on Steve’s bedside table tells him Steve has been gone for ten minutes. He rests his back against the decorative pillows places upon the headboard and stretches his legs in front of him.
The first group session Steve and him attend falls on a Thursday. Tony doesn't speak beyond a causal and useless introduction, seeing as how everyone’s eyes had widened the minute Steve and him had walked through the doors of the almost abandoned primary school. Steve speaks a little more; a comment here and there, an interested question to some of the other members.
Tony has done therapy enough times, for example, to know that it isn’t rational to think that one person can or cannot deserve another. And he has done therapy enough times to know that he has always struggled -and will probably do so forever- with thinking himself worthy of people he loves. In his head Tony pulls away to protect Steve. Protect Steve from what? From Tony.
There is a tug, a pull, a magnetic force stronger than any other power Tony has ever known that wills him to pull away from Nebula and rest his entire body against Steve’s chest.
“And I needed you, as in past tense. That trumps what you need. It’s too late, buddy. Sorry,” Tony proclaims, completely uncaring of all the people hearing about it.
Steve is the only sustained social contact Tony has that isn’t in any way work related. A couple of times Steve spends the entire day with him in his workshop, his own laptop close to him, either to entertain him or to help him fulfill his own obligations. If he can’t stay with Tony he makes sure they at least see each other once every day, normally for meals. They don’t share them, typically, too busy for it, but they try to catch up quickly but meaningfully every time.
Tony rolls his eyes at the scene but he knows he doesn't do a very good job of hiding his joy at Steve’s natural way of interacting with his bots. Pepper and Rhodey have both known the bots for years and they’ve gone out of their way to play with them once or twice but Steve treats them in the way Tony knows he does. Like they’re more than what they look. Like they’re human no matter how non-human they appear to be.
When Tony finally sits the team -plus Pepper and Rhodey- down to tell them the full story Steve doesn't know if it is the first time Tony’s telling anyone what he went through those months everyone thought him dead. Perhaps that’s what SHIELD has had him doing, explaining everything over and over again.
Tony sighs and Steve can see his shoulders drop considerably like his exhaustion has finally caught up to him.
Half of the people Pepper mentioned first are going nowhere near him at the moment and she pretty much acknowledged that Rhodey is still a wildcard in terms of permanent residence, but Tony doesn’t tell her that.
way as in the beginning but we do. But just because I love her doesn’t mean I want to keep being with her. And just because she loves me doesn't mean she deserves to settle. That’s what makes me sad.”
It’s waking up to Steve, and making plans that they don’t call dates, and it’s cooking together and bantering and it’s family, above all.
“Oh my god,” Tony pronounces, throwing his arms up.
When it seems like he’s thought things through and come to a conclusion he brings his hand to cup Tony’s on his cheek and, once again, he leans into the touch. He goes so far as to tilt his head to his right and closes his eyes once again.
Thanos is dead.
Tony looks at each and every person in the room as he asks the question. Bruce still hasn’t left his stupefied state, Steve is looking at some indistinct point across the room and Natasha’s eyes, when they meet his, reflect the same kind of confusion Tony is feeling.
I want to thank every single person who took the time to read and give kudos on chapter 1, it means the world to me. I'm especially grateful to the people who left comments saying they liked the story or detailing their favorite parts of the first chapter. Your words give me the confidence and motivation to keep writing and I was brought to tears by everyone's kindness.
“The option is always there,” Valkyrie mutters but Natasha pretends not to have heard her and Tony thinks they all decide to follow her lead.
The potential was always there, simmering under the surface and just waiting to be set free and explored. Steve believes they all felt it in their veins, that current that connected them, but none of them knew exactly what it meant.
“Anyway, that’s what I wanted to say,” Tony stutters, his words coming much faster now. “You hate me but even so I’m willing to share my best friends with you because I love them and they love you and I believe you love them too so… Yeah.”
Some times the feeling gets even worse if Natasha or Bruce are standing right next to him because without having to talk to them about it he knows they’re feeling the same things.
“Oh,” Steve murmurs.
And now, he gets to live his life and share his bed with a man. A man he loves. A man that -hopefully, maybe, one day- he will be able to marry.
“You love him and he knows that,” Tony says. “That’s more important than anything else right now. He’ll come around.”
Tony hesitates at the entrance of the living room, debating whether to pass along and continue on his way to the kitchen as was his original plan. From his place on the couch Thor grunts and starts moving, twisting his body this and that way. That seems to make Tony’s decision easier and he ends up walking further into the living room. The table is covered in beer cans, some of them crushed, others tipped over and obviously empty as well.
“What do you mean?” Steve asks, a flicker of hope lighting his way through the conversation.
He’s feeling in the mood now and because he’s gotten so much better over the years at not denying himself things that will make him truly happy, Steve clicks the few buttons he needs to press to take him to the folder he created where he stores all of his favorite pictures to start going through some of them.
Pepper releases all the air she was holding in her lungs and the vibrations of her body are what give away the little laugh she lets out.
But Steve has to admit this feels more
He doesn't know if Steve noticed but to his own ears the words felt too much like a confession, no matter how innocent they should have been. He said
Peter broke the silence. “I’m gonna pass on dessert.” He pulled his chair out, taking his plate with him to the kitchen. “I have homework.” Tony tried calling after him but it was pointless.
“And now Hammer is dead. Did you kill him?” Bruce questioned her.
“You didn’t burn it?” Peter asked on instinct.
But Tate isn’t so easily defeated. “Miss Potts. I have but one question for you.” Judge Brooks allows it. “Is Mr. Stark not a good father to the child you two share, Morgan Stark?” and Pepper know she can’t lie.
Clearly I love drama 😁 So no one caught on to what I was hinting at in the last chapter 👀👀👀 Don't worry things will be explained in the next chapter..
Carmelita Camacho was beautiful. She was about the same height as Peter, all dark hair, brown skin and dark eyes. She truly was a sight and her presence made Peter feel inferior, uncomfortable and maybe even a little jealous; jealous that she’d been with Wade. She’d seen parts of Wade he still hadn’t. She was with him first in every sense of the word and Peter was second best, felt like second-best.
“Okay.” He rose from his knees and got dressed. Stephen knew this was over. He took a few of his personal belongings as he made towards the door. He would get everything else, eventually.
When they arrived on the right floor, Steve let Morgan go before him. She walked into the main living room and found a group of people dressed in Bunny ears and costumes who yelled surprise upon seeing her. Tony, who stood out in his pink and white full-body bunny costume was the first person to approach her. She saw her dad grab a pair of bunny ears and stuck them on as well.
“And he definitely doesn’t like me.” Stephen mumbled.
“You’re tipsy.” Pepper commented. Her guesses in this state of mind were as good as hers, completely baseless.
Steve had a decent 4
“Loki!” Thor spoke next, hugging his brother even tighter than Torunn did. “I thought I’d never see you again.”
Steve stared at Tony in awe when Maria left them alone in the living room and headed for bed. “Are we really alone?” he had to ask, in pure disbelief.
Harley laughed. “I’m serious. She knows and I didn’t say I was using these contacts. I just know a few single people. Like um…” He started speaking with one hand before it rested on his chin. “Like…Lila Barton.”
“You’re the Stark-Rogers’ long-lost child?” There was laughter in his voice and a sly smile on his lips.
He pulls Steve behind him and Steve tries to justify why they shouldn’t go downstairs and have sex when his wife, Tony’s mother and possibly his father would be a floor above them. Tony paused in his tracks.
Steve was shocked out of his mind when he woke the next morning beside a naked Natasha in her bed. He was equally naked, and he didn’t want to believe they had done what he thought they did. Nat tried to cover her body as best she could while Steve did the same. They really did it, huh?
“Gunshot wound, below the heart.” Stephen informed her as he directed Steve in placing Tony on the operating table.
Steve was sure she was a girl that looked exactly like Tony. They had bickered about this for most of the pregnancy but they were getting closer to Tony’s due date now and would find out soon enough. Regardless of the gender, they knew they would shower their baby with so much love, others might find it suffocating. They were going to bask in this though because Tony had suffered multiple miscarriages in the past. Steve had let Tony know they didn’t have to keep trying. He could only imagine how painful it must be to physical lose a child from your body over and over again and he constantly blamed himself.
Tony pulls up his zipper and fixes himself in his pants again. Steve has cum leaking out of him onto the sofa and Steve can’t bring himself to move. Things are harder to do with SJ in the way.
After dinner, Steve helped Maria wash up and Tony disappeared into his lab. He was sitting at a desk staring at a projected screen when Steve decided to join him by taking the seat next to him.
Bucky and Sam are helping Steve out of the car and into their apartment after getting back from the hospital. According to the doctor that had treated Steve, Steve’s neck muscles were severely bruised. His vocal cords had been grazed from strangling. He was being put on vocal rest until the chords and muscles had healed on their own. The doctor estimated a week of healing. A week of not talking; a week of liquid meals because he wouldn’t be able to physically consume any hard food and a week of full body rest. The incident had put a toll on his body and the baby. SJ narrowly survived. His heartbeat was weak when they arrived at the hospital that night but SJ was already a little fighter. He fought for his little life and his heartrate was back on track in no time, beating stronger than ever. He was perfectly healthy.
Clint was unfazed. “He’ll live,” he said, walking away from the argument to put the last of their bags in their car. Clint didn’t blame Steve or Tony for Harley’s doing. He was his own person after all and legally an adult. And so he decided they didn’t need to stay there any longer.
“Why’d you never mention this? What if I got pregnant?”
“It’s okay.” Tony provided, touching Steve’s arm to get his attention again. “We honestly were just as surprised as you guys are.” He could tell by looking around the room. “But you know, it just happened...”
When they came into view, Anna ran over to meet them, taking her baby brother into her arms, to give him kisses and cuddles. Upon further observation of the room, the couple made a note of everyone present - Tony's mother, Sam, Bucky, Winter, and their four eldest children and their significant others: Harley and his wife, Torunn, Morgan and her boyfriend Nathan, Anna and her boyfriend Remy, and Peter and
Tony held his face in his hands, staring at him for some time and trying to read his blue eyes, that were usually very open. Today he was a little guarded, but he saw a sliver of what he was looking for, so he asked. “D-Did you want a baby?” He stuttered out. He saw Steve swallow.
“Yeah.” Peter scratched the back of his head awkwardly. “I’m sorry mom. You were right.” Tony smiled at that. “I should have never been hanging out with Wade in the first place.” Because Wade had disappeared – per Tony’s threats – and broke his heart in the process. And Peter was getting teary-eyed and Tony gladly wrapped his baby boy in a hug. “I’m sorry.” He mumbled.
“Harley, leave them.” Anna chimed in. Her eyes filled with love and adoration. “They’re in love.”
Tony shook his head. It appeared as if he wasn't able to find the words but after a moment, he finally spoke up. "Alex. He was 19 and I guess I jumped into things too quickly with him."
Then there was Morgan who was itching for the day Nathan would propose while she ran Stark Industries along with Harley and Pepper in their mother’s name. Nathan wasn’t oblivious however. He had every intention to propose to his long-time girlfriend in the coming months.
“You need to get rid of it.” Tony commands.
He wondered. He shouldn’t put it past him to do something like that.
Somewhere across the room, Harley and his wife, Torunn watched and heard the interaction between the newly engaged couple and the newlywed couple.
Peter glared at him. “Yeah because that’s not creepy at all.”
“You guys are so mean to me. Why am I even friends with you two?” Steve finally got to speak for himself.
“I’ll go get the blindfold,” and he got up and ran up the stairs before Tony could form words. Every time this happened he realized how much this spoiled the mood. No it didn’t take much to get back in the mood with Steve’s thick big cock on display but he just wish it wasn’t lost in the first place. And Tony got to thinking about what Steve had said, those nights ago. 'When are we going to do it without the blindfold?' When? He couldn’t hide this forever. He deserved to know. And when was a good time like the present. He shouldn’t put it off any longer. And if Steve wanted to leave him, he’d just have to deal with that and say, 'hey. It was good while it lasted'.
“Welcome to the family.” Steve finished for Tony, who was choked up at this point. He was very aware of how Tony’s emotions were all over the place recently and it worried him, but he hadn’t mentioned it yet.
Amelia saw Morgan’s eyes sadden and she realized, she had to address this if she hoped to help her friend heal. “How are you feeling Morgan, really?”
“It’s after 2, baby.” Bucky updated him, pointing to the clock on the wall.
“Morgan and Harley?”
Nova answers gladly. “Attempted murder, if I’ve ever seen it and direct harm to Mr. Rogers and an unborn Nicholas Rogers.” She puts emphasis on the last statement. “At merely 4 months pregnant. How does that make Mr. Stark the better parent?”
“It’s about Sharon,” Steve insisted. That was a first. Bucky listened intently from there on after when he sat down and Sam rolled his eyes. “She’s just gotten so clingy lately.”
So, Steve was fixing himself a plate and putting the red velvet cupcake on a separate plate for Winter when, as fate would have it, Strange sauntered up towards the table.
“You said you loved her.” Jacob started. “So why the jitters?”
“He is good to her. But he has never failed to neglect Nicholas Rogers since the day he learned about him-”
this early.” Bucky cleared his throat again at the word ‘coming’. His mind was still clouded with sex. He and Sam weren’t expecting Steve to be over until later. Winter was at her aunt’s house, Sam’s sister for the weekend which meant they had the house to themselves.
Steve appeared behind Tony.
But Remy didn’t forget. He knew his girl well. He knew what she was capable of. She was extremely powerful. “You don’t have to. Not with me here.” He stated, pressing their lips together briefly.
Steve wouldn’t chance it.
Their waiter had brought out their meals as Morgan finished her exposition. Morgan was craving a family dinner or meeting or something with the family together to try and be a family again. It was much needed, but everyone was off doing their own thing. For the first time in her life, her family was so disconnected and a little in shambles. Things changed since the Christmas Party. Their family was missing something, and no one wanted to bother salvaging it.
“I hacked SHIELD. That information hasn’t been publicly disclosed yet.” He peered up at them. “And it just came in on my phone.” Harley explained as he held his phone up and a projection with a recent report popped up from SHIELD.
“Am I?” Tony responded, not able to control the grin that was spreading across his face. Besides the pregnancy issue, being with Steve again did make him so happy. And was he glowing? Maybe it was the pregnancy, maybe it was just being in a healthy relationship with Steve. Maybe it was both. “I am, aren’t I?” He hummed, munching away at his salad. Pepper smiled at him. “How are things with you?” Tony wondered. He was such a bad friend for not checking in on her recently.
“What are your powers?” Harley wondered aloud. He hadn’t spoken with her much yet, but he wasn’t opposed to knowing his new sister in person as best he could before he’d have to head back up to MIT in a few days.
“It’s me honey.” Peter seemed to have recognized him, gladly taking the finger Steve had extended and calmed down a bit.
“I came to apologize –”
“I just…” Peter could hear him searching for an excuse right then and there on the spot. Peter folded his arms
Stephen reached out to kiss him and Tony stopped him. “I’m not kissing you. You aggravated me and –” Tony cut himself off when he saw Stephen shaking uncontrollably.
“How could I forget?” Tony answered. “I was only 6 weeks post-partum. I still had a pouch. My breast ached and I couldn’t stop crying. We had sex later that day and it hurt so bad. The absolute worst day of my life.”
Being a husband was easy. Nothing changed but titles. Harley loved Torunn unconditionally so taking on the husband role was easy. Being a Prince – a Prince, husband of the future Queen of Asgard – was hard. He had to attend Council meetings and provide input on how to rule. He had to rule. What did a mortal like him know about ruling? It was a bit irritating at times and he reached out to his best friend for some sort of advice, but Jacob Rhodes could only say so much. How does one rule a nation, a kingdom, people? He also tried his best to hide this from Torunn. He wasn’t happy here, but this was his wife’s home. This was her kingdom, so he told himself to
“I won’t.” he promised. Anna felt relieved but with a secret like that came many questions. She shifted uncomfortably which prompted Peter to glance down at her legs. He could see a white substance trickling down.
“Hm.” She put her phone down and smiled up at him.
She couldn’t forget.
“I kill for sport. Dare I say, I get high off the feeling and I know she would enjoy it too but she's just too pure. That must be your good parenting kicking in.”
“Anna.” Steve’s voice rang in her ears again, but she didn’t react as she locked eyes with Tony and dragged the knife half an inch further along Stephen’s neck. Stephen winced in pain. Mere seconds later and Steve realized that Tony was in fact urging her when he saw Tony’s lips curled up into a half-smile while staring back at their killer daughter. “Tones. Tell her to stop.” He asked of him and Tony finally blinked, processing what Steve had said and what was happening around them.
Tony gave him a look of sympathy. “Don’t you get tired of all these exams, Cap?” Steve nodded. “Exactly. Let me sneak you out now.” Tony grabbed his hand and led him out the exam room through a secret hallway. Steve was amazed. He hadn’t known that existed but then he supposed it wouldn't be much of a secret if he knew. Tony tried pulling him along again, but he stood frozen, unsure of these plans.
When Tony woke the next morning, a Monday morning at that, he saw Steve staring at him, a shit-eating grin on his face. He felt almost clean, remembering Steve had cleaned them both up before going to sleep. Tony smiled and his mouth was soon captured in a kiss. Tony forced him away and Steve looked back at him, like a hit-puppy, confusion settling on his brows.
He wondered. “It is written all over your face, love.” She explained, holding that face between her hands and pressing their foreheads together.
Peter was content living in the main house though with Wade for now. They would hope to find a place of their own in a year or so where they could have their full privacy and room for Ellie to visit and maybe for their own kids one day.
Carol ignored his response altogether and got back to the initial discussion. “I didn’t cheat on your father and neither did he. I met someone but I didn’t do anything with her.”
And then he was going to leave him. He was going to walk out.
After dinner, everyone disappeared to their respective rooms. Thor helped Sif to bed and then he went in search of Valkyrie. He found her returning from Earth upon arriving at the bifrost. Thor greeted Heimdall, briefly.
“What of Valkyrie?” Thor asked the table. Valkyrie had been voluntarily absent when it came to their family gatherings following their return from Earth for Tony’s Christmas party and Thor wondered what had become of his friend.
“Tony, you don’t need to apologize for anything.” Steve promised. There was no need for him to be forgiven. He passed the entire box of tissues along. Tony pursed his lips and smiled. He let Steve continue talking. “I want you to know I never cheated on you with Sharon either.” He whispered above him. “That fight we had at the airport those years ago. I never did anything with her.”
At the reception, the Princess and the new Prince were gifted with many presents and congratulated by many people from all over the galaxy. Steve and Tony, practically wrapped around each other were the last two people they talked with before they were truly left alone at their table. Harley smiled when he saw them approaching their table. He got up and hugged them at the same time.
“What?” Tony shouted, ripping right through the centre of the giant armour, and destroying its poorly created and designed, make-shift arc reactor. He landed a few feet away from Justin. He didn’t seem to be affected by the destruction of his armour.
Steve started a walking pace and Tony, without thinking followed suit. They were outside the building when they resumed their conversation; out of earshot from anyone.
Steve turned to Pepper. “You ready?”
“I’m dying to see you pregnant.” Stephen mumbled, wrapping his arm around Tony’s middle. He always had a little pudge following his last pregnancy.
“Have you eaten yet?”
“I did not think it was my place to say.” Nertha conceded with such poise and false remorse. To be honest with herself, Nertha had forgotten about the incident, putting it in the back of her mind until Torunn was ever so frequently mentioned.
Morgan was; how it might be contagious. But Morgan had had a miscarriage.
“I can never forget that. You always come first. All of you.” Steve stared at Tony longingly as he was inclusive in his statement and Tony could tell. He would give anything to have Tony back in his life again...
“How are you feeling, really?”
They watched the floor numbers light up by the elevator and its usual dinging sound signalled the arrival on the current floor. Tony pulled away a bit, leaving his right arm still wrapped around Steve. They stared as the doors opened and sure enough Stephen stepped out and Steve ambushed him with the first question.
Her prized possession, however, was her collection of Avengers action figures sitting under her windowsill. Her Winter Soldier and Falcon ones were always sitting together holding hands.
Almost eight weeks. Tony took a deep breath. “When –” He cut himself off, afraid to ask but he needed to know. “When did I conceive? What date?”
“Tony. The last child of ours that we trusted got pregnant.” Steve reminded him but Tony didn’t forget; that was only 4 months ago.
But Wade didn't get it. He never gets to see Ellie. He hadn't seen her up close in almost two years. He just sneaks little peeks at her from a distance. His ex and her mother, Carmelita Camacho didn't want Wade in his daughter's life. Ellie didn't even refer to him as her father because she wasn't really sure who he was. Carmelita always kept Ellie away.
“Maybe it’s time you marry as well.” Hela noted before walking away and Nertha went after her to inquire forward on the matter.
He failed.
like it held no weight, as if she wasn’t above him, as if she wasn’t truly a Princess, as if she wasn’t a God.
“You’ve met him?” Steve realized. He had to remind himself that their children told Tony everything first.
“No touching,” Steve instructed, sucking on Tony’s clit. He had waited months to touch Tony; to see all of him and he didn’t want anyone else to. Not even Tony himself. “I have to make up for lost time.” Tony whined, wiggling beneath him. He felt helpless with one of his sense missing.
“I asked first, Wade” he countered in a heartbeat because he wasn’t going to let him get under his skin tonight.
. And so I love you too baby, forever and always.”
Steve was at a loss for words. He never expected to see Tony ever again. Especially not here and now, holding their son hostage. Steve tried not to make any sudden moves because Tony was capable of anything at this point if he’d already shoved him a lake, tried to strangled him to death and snuck into his hospital room, most of which were while he was pregnant.
“brought it up the
Bucky was making lunch and Sam briefly hugged him from behind. Steve smiled at his best friends and thought about how far they had come. They despised each other in the beginning until that hatred turned into sexual tension. The eventual sex gave them Winter and their beautiful little girl made their marriage of 4 years an obvious choice.
Jacob released her. “Someone might but you can’t make Harley. He doesn’t even know what love is.” Nertha had to agree with that. As much as she cared for Harley, she knew he didn’t feel the same.
“Not all anymore, right?” Strange baited. Steve rolled his eyes. He had the propensity to disregard any thoughts of Sharon. Even though the memory of discovering the gender of their baby was still fresh in his mind. He was having a girl and he wasn’t certain how Morgan would react to that. She was his only daughter for 18 years and though, she wouldn’t say it, she was extremely possessive of her father. With Peter she had no choice but to deal, with just a year separating them; he was always there.
“You’re strong Morgie.” She chuckled at the name. He hadn’t called her that since they were kids. When she was born, Harley had a hard time pronouncing her name and even after he grew older and learned how, he still teased her with the name. “You’re the strongest person I know. That’s how I know you’ll get past this.”
. He couldn’t say that to Tony though. Instead, he turned the bathroom lights off and joined is fiancée in bed. He loved saying that. Tony was his.
“Who’s asking?” she shot back, watching as he shuffled the cards.
“But she’s our sister, Harley. Let’s just talk with her.” Peter suggested.
“When Sharon told me she was pregnant, I was angry, furious but the more I thought about the baby, the happier I was. The thought of holding that little life, caring for them, it made me so happy.”
Tony smiled.“Yeah, I’m yours handsome."
He’d probably get back before Tony. Steve went down to the garage. Some alphas whistled as he got on his bike, but he ignored it. He got home around one.
“Don’t try to. It’s cute,” said Tony.
“He’s a fanatic, but Fury is right. I’m too close.”
“Sir, ten men, are incoming,” said Jarvis.
“You don’t have to wait until I wake up to eat.”
"Well, we're switching things around."
"Let's talk about this elsewhere," said Natasha.
“Did I-
“Is he alright?!”
“Are you sure?”
“Can you go with me?”
Edith would have to report this information to Fury. It wouldn’t take long for Dr. Banner to discover what she had. She could blame her lack of reporting such a discovery on her lack of knowledge on the subject. That would be believable enough. She left the lab.
“Anything else?” asked Rhodes.
Tony was first to move, flopping lazily onto his back. Steve was still in a state of bliss with cum and slick leaking from him. The erotic scene would forever be scorched in Tony's memory. He slathered a wash clothe in a soap that smelled lightly of lavender. Steve pulled away slightly when he tried washing him.
“Closet,” said Jarvis. Steve wrapped the towel around his waist. He went to the closet. It was bigger than his apartment at S.H.I.E.L.D.
“Why are we here?”
“Thought I lost you for a moment,” said Steve.
“Why is he here?” asked Steve.
“We could have lost her,” he said.
“Family left alive?”
“What’s wrong?”
“Mmm, Daddy?”
“Don’t move."
He flinched clutching his side.
“No.”
Piper returned to her seat. Lena dropped a large textbook on her desk and they began their true lesson.
February 8, 2016
Tony pulled away sensing his discomfort.
Strategy
“We’re old men with decades of trauma. She’s young. Piper can bounce back. Her brain is still developing. There’s time for her to recover, learn, and overcome.”
“Who built this?” asked Tony.
“Dr. Banner, right now would be a really good time for you to get angry,” said Steve.
“I’ve got a ride,” said Natasha.
Steve watched as his alpha handled eliminated the threat.
“Papa.”
Steve went to the elevator, hitting the dining hall floor. He found Thor sitting on the table eating some kind of dry pastry.
Steve groaned awake. A fire lit under his skin, undamped by the sheen of sweat on his skin. The heat was there but the all-consuming need wasn’t there.
“Give me your early diagnosis,” said Fury.
Tony grabbed Steve, pulling him onto the couch. He scented the omega. All traces of another alpha were wiped from his omega’s skin.
*****
"He should be out of feral state in a few days, a week at most."
She begged him to make it stop. He wasn’t sure what she wanted to him to stop. Even if he did know, there wasn’t anything he could do about it. There was no pattern to her fits. But they always happened right when she was about to sleep. The pup had gone without sleep for seventy-two hours. She relaxed slightly.
“You’re seriously asking that?”
“Be good for Ms. Ann today.”
"If I need anything Jarvis will get you," said Steve.
"Steve, you gotta let go."
Art class ended all too soon and Piper was brought to the training room. Winter was there. Her small relief at seeing him was ruined when she realized a bomb vest was strapped to him.
"It's a beautiful home," said Steve.
He tensed. Standing at the lab entrance was Steve with his arm crossed.
Seconds later, the beast went limp. Steve gently lowered it to the ground by its mother and sibling. Why was this getting to him? Maybe it was his omega nature urging him to nurture.
*****
“That’s first you make me do.”
He’d hoped nothing pertaining to the Stark girl would come directly to him. Fury hypnotized the worst-case scenario. In none of the scenarios was the girl’s death worst option. Piper had proven to pose a legitimate level of danger she was only three. His concern leaned to if she were allowed to continue on this path. Her threat level would rise if this continued. She’d be a greater threat than Widow or the Winter Soldier.
. Lena hadn't made an appearance since then leaving him to deal with destruction. He wasn’t sure if he’d handled it right. She was missing something he didn’t know how to get back. It would help if he knew what that something was.
“I’m fine,” said Piper.
“Tony, you’re growling.” The deep feral sound sent a pleasurable shiver down Steve's back. He shook away the effect. Steve gently squeezed Tony's hand. The growling slowly stopped. “You can trust me to handle myself."
Rune watched Piper draw. So far, it was only long rectangles. Lena remained at her desk. Rune went to his own, studying the waxy colorful tubes neatly packed into the box. The blank page before him was almost frightening. He'd never been given that level of freedom.
"Why can't you and Daddy remember to put the seat down? I don't pee standing up,"
Tony pressed his nose into Steve’s neck, breathing in his scent. He pulled Steve close but couldn’t sleep. Steve fell asleep, using his chest as a pillow. He carefully slid away from his mate. Steve whined in his sleep. He leaned over the edge of the couch, running his fingers through Steve’s hair. He went to the lab and started working on his most recent designs.
“Mr. Stark.”
“Steve, I’ve enjoyed this time I've spent with you. And I-
“Easy there alpha. Mine isn’t for a week and I’m on suppressants. Heat is something every omega goes through Steve should be more than capable in dealing with it," said Pepper.
"Sarcasm."
“Why do you have that?” asked Steve.
“He did not,” said Thor.
“What do you want?” he asked.
“I think it’s best if you talk this through with Jarvis,” replied Steve.
“I haven’t touched the bottle since she was taken!”
"Sounds normal. You're fine." But she wasn't. He just couldn't find the injury.
“I don’t want to know what thought I lost you to,” said Rhodes.
“No.”
"How is that different?" he asked.
Tony quickly downed the drink before returning to his place next to him. They ate in peace while music played in the background. Small talk filled the time, allowing them to get to know each other further. Tony set dishes in the sink. It was now ten. Steve sighed he should be getting back to the facility.
"They brought him to point of exhaustion. Out of twenty assigned the task, only one survived."
His voice was soft.
“No.”
Steve wove his way through the crowded sidewalks. One of the things he enjoyed about being in the city was that he didn’t stand out in the crowd. When he made it to the park, Steve kept walking until he found an out of the way bench. He watched families pass by. Would he bring his pup here to play? He’d always loved the rare occasions he left Brooklyn with Bucky to come to Central Park. It seemed so big then. Families played in the distance. He wanted that. Steve began sketching his surroundings. At 4:30 pm he started the walk home, making it back to Stark Tower a little after five.
"Is he alive?!"
“No, he’s not.”
“It’s fine. Thank you." Steve pulled the blanket tightly around his shoulders.
“Where is my daughter?!”
“That sound.”
“Only with bikes never cars. In the little spare time I had I read the Motorcyclist,” said Steve.
“I have to make a call,” said Steve.
“And your great grandmother?” asked Rune.
“I’ll see you when you get home.” His voice heavy with a dull, sad anger.
“Nothing that can’t be fixed. Steve, you know you're in full-blown heat."
“Is your friend that scruffy odd-smelling, beta?” asked Rune.
Tony looked over the paper. There was no mention of his mate. His mate and unborn pup were safe. He could have gotten them killed.
“What do you mean by that?” asked Steve.
“I’m so sorry, Piper,” he whispered. Steve quietly shut the door.
“Oh, yeah, you’re the best.”
Steve kissed him goodnight.
“Get it all out, honey,” he said.
“I will never treat you any different because you’re an omega. Promise,” said Rune.
“That’s forever.”
“Steve, get the lever.”
“More people kept finding out-
“Why?” she asked.
“And what is that?” asked Tony.
“I have.”
“No, Erskine chose Captain Rogers for his merits as a man. Him being an omega didn’t matter. The U.S. military chose Steve because he was an omega. They needed an omega that was fully willing to give their consent. How do you think Captain Rogers would respond to the fact that he was accepted for project rebirth since he was an omega?”
“Any movement?” asked Tony, glancing at the image on the monitor.
She kept running, barely escaping each time. Piper knew he was holding back a lot, but it didn’t make the idea of challenging him anymore tempting.
“Yet you and this Bucky remained friends. How?” said Thor.
"I thought I washed it all off."
Steve laughed.
“Thanks, Jarvis."
“Take off your helmet.” Tony’s faceplate moved away. Steve kissed his alpha. “Be careful.”
"Can I air out the room? The smell of distressed omega is making me anxious," said Foggy.
“What’s for breakfast, Uncle Steve?” asked Rune.
"Stevie," he hiccuped
“No.”
“I won’t say anything,” he said.
The Mandarin instantly put his hands up.
Her words were slightly muffled by the muzzle. She whimpered, finding it difficult to get her feet. As soon as she was upright she was hit with vertigo. She fell onto her back. Piper rolled onto her stomach. Tears were streaming down her face. Piper leaned against the corner of the room. Foggy memories of what lead her to be here began to clear. She’d tried to escape with some stupidly rage-motivated plan.
Tony woke to Piper pouncing on his chest, knocking the wind out of him.
"You don't."
*****
Tony stood on the edge of the platform, kept in place by Killian’s grasp.
Piper accepted her share of the food, grudgingly eating the meatloaf. When finished, she settled into Winter’s corner, sticking her tongue out at him when he glanced over at her. She hugged her toy closely to her chest, ready for sleep.
“It doesn’t matter.”
“Looks like I’m learning German.”
Steve bit his lip, swallowing inappropriate words and guttural screams. “Can you tell me where he is?”
His hand traveled downward, groping that perfectly formed rear.
Piper didn’t understand why Papa thought that was something worthy of keeping from her.
Who was he? His appearance didn't yield much. She'd seen that red star before in a history book. It was Soviet, but that regime ended in 1991. He seemed about Aunt Natasha's age, so the timeline fit. Aunt Nat taught her Russian. She never thought she'd use it. Were they in Russia?
Tony knew the answer would be no.
She thought of Winter.
The AI unit scanned Steve.
“Perfect.”
“Yes."
"Emotional," said Steve.
They stuffed their faces. Piper lets herself get absorbed into the movie. Halfway through, Rune moved between Maria and Pepper. Papa and Daddy were sitting on a couch. There was a comfortable little nook between them that looked just perfect. They weren't going to turn against her, she reminded herself before climbing up onto the couch. She leaned into Papa’s side and quietly hummed along to ‘Let It Go.'
“WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?!” she screamed.
“Nice watch."
“Why?” asked Pepper.
“And I reset it to eight," said Tony.
If she could believe that, so could he. There was someone out there for him.
“No,” he said. Steve wished he could. Steve took the glass from her, taking a timid sip. He didn't have much of a taste for wine, not be able to afford it. He took a seat on the couch while Edith and Natasha set things up.
Tony smirked. He had been given a small taste of the omega and wanted more. And he didn't think he could ever get enough. Maybe he could convince Steve to make their arrangement more permanent.  Steve didn’t understand how difficult it was for someone to keep his interest. He grew so bored with people quickly, especially in any truly intimate sense.
“I’m settling down,” said Tony.
“How so?”
The classic three-year-old question,
“No, if it was anything important, she’ll call." Calling Pepper would ruin his good mood.
"Is it safe here?" He wasn't asking for himself, he was worried about the alpha's safety.
“Tony?”
Natasha took a breath, steadying herself. “Is that all, director?”
“Steve." She pulled back slightly.
“Warmachine rocks with an x all caps.”
Piper gulped, cautiously approaching the alpha and taking a breath before she nudged him; jumping away before he fully woke up. He looked at the tray. The alpha's stomach growled.
"No!" growled Tony.
It was reassuringly familiar.
“I’ll have to take another blood sample,” she said. Edith painlessly drew another sample of blood.
He pushed the parts back in place.
He carded his fingers through his hair. Eventually, he surrendered and joined his mate. Steve was spread eagle on the bed, taking up all the space. The omega was snoring peacefully in a deep sleep. He couldn't get into bed without waking up his mate. He settled in the nesting couch.
“Did you like the beard?”
“No.”
“Good.”
At four they got back. Steve ran out of the jet as soon as they landed. He needed to get to the security of his room. Steve fumbled with his keys. He felt someone behind him. He cringed. It wasn’t Kate’s gentle scent. No, it was powerful. It was a mix of gunpowder, red peppers, and earth.
"I guess seventy-two hours siesta is a bit much," he said.
Rhodey smiled. It was an honor. He'd be happy to help out, but Tony would need to figure it out first. “Thank you, Tony. I will protect it like it’s my own. Whose godmother?” he asked.
Steve snarled baring his teeth. If only he could fight! Killian pounced on Tony.
“What did you get Tony for Christmas?” asked Natasha.
“And?”
“Thank you, but you didn’t have to give me two.”
Tony led her back down the stairs. As they worked, Piper's posture relaxed. It would be best to bring up the therapist now.
“You have? If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact me!” Bruce said encouragingly.
“Captain Rogers has gone feral, so you must approach cautiously. They’re in the guest bedroom,” said Jarvis.
“I’ll call you if she wakes up,” promised Maria.
“I need to speak with him,” said Fury.
Tony quickly shut the album.
"A retinal scanner," he said.
“Lose my sight. It’s that or how do I comb my hair,” said Matt.
“Really?”
He picked her up. She immediately went limp against him. He wished he could take whatever she was feeling. He went to the bathroom, placing her gently on the ground, then turned on the spout. She flinched slightly as stray droplets touched her skin.
Steve's skin grew hot. He nodded, desperate for release. Tony raised his chin, kissing him. The alpha’s lips were soft and guiding, slowly deepening the union of their mouths. They fell back into the couch with alpha on top of him. Tony weight rested between his legs. Their hips rocked together, creating incredible friction. It all came so fast. His toes curled as his back arched of the couch.
“Steve." No visible response. He should have known this would happen. Alpha tone may work. Research on PTSD in omegas proved that the alpha tone trusted of a trusted person could help an omega out of such a state.
“You can open your eyes now, sweetheart,” said Daddy.
It had been two days since their encounter with Winter, yet facial recognition picked up no one even similar to his appearance. Steve and Tony were packing up to return to New York. Winter had likely already found some method of escape. But S.H.I.E.L.D. was monitoring every airport and port. Yet, there was nothing. They took one step forward, two steps backward. It was mentally draining. S.H.I.E.L.D. fed the press some bullshit excuse for why they were in Glasgow. Some false lead that led them on a wild goose chase.
“Then stop whatever this is, please,” begged Piper.
Steve leaned against the window sill watching the children play in the background. “What do we do?”
“Your face. It was funny. What didn’t you like about it?”
“Tony, she’s only three!”
“Sleep well?” asked Natasha.
“What?”
"Bring up the thermogenic signatures again. And factor in 3,000 degrees." He climbed onto one of his toolboxes to get a better view. Jarvis started plotting the information on the map below. "Take out everywhere there was a Mandarin attack."
“Tony.”
“Put me down!”
“Just so you know, I’d look for you,” she said.
“Yes.”
Piper was looking at her feet, not meeting their gaze. “Piper, look at us,” said Tony.
“You mean how to be an assassin."
“You know how I feel about that question,” said Steve.
“Exactly,” said Tony.
“You promised Lena!”
“Didn’t seem to work out that bad. You’ve done well. A billionaire married to Captain America.”
"Love you too," said Tony.
Natasha went to find Clint. He was watching the fight, cheering with the males, blending in, but as soon as Natasha reappeared he discretely pulled away from the crowd. Together they went to the entrance. Clint helped her into a white fur coat. A gift from one of her many suitors. She kept them for occasions like this. A valet pulled up in a flashy red car, handing her the keys.
“Papa!”
"Do you not like it?" asked Natasha.
“Humor him, Edith,” said Steve.
“I should go,” he said.
“Pepper Potts his ex,” said Jarvis.
“There’s no reason to be nervous,” said Steve.
“We are.”
“Tony."
“Do you know how long it took Pepper to get a drawer?” she asked.
“This can’t be happening!”
They loaded into two jets. Steve, Tony, Natasha, and five droids in one. Clint and Hill in the other with the rest of the droids. Even at full speed, it would take them twelve hours to get there.
“Take your time. Lay down when you’re ready,” she said.
“Now can we go?” asked Piper.
“Sure.”
Steve blushed when a perfect thought came to mind. That would be perfect. He fanned the blush from his face. And Tony wouldn't be the only one to enjoy it.
“Okay, Piper. I’ll have Jarvis start looking for a frame. We’ll rebuild it from the ground up,” said Tony.
“7 pounds five ounces. 18 inches.” She placed Piper's feet in black inkpad, pressing her feet against a piece of paper. Christina washed the ink from Piper's tiny feet. They went to the master bedroom.
“Something tells me I won’t like the end of this story,” said Steve.
A few days after Steve moved in he was sent off on a mission. Tony was growing anxious it had been two weeks since he last saw Steve. This was longest he’d been away from him. He had to get used to separation Steve would be sent on missions frequently for varying amounts of time. He was sure the omega was fine, but his mind couldn’t help going to the worse option. In the time construction had been done to guest room converting in the perfect studio for Steve all it was missing was Steve.
“Where?” he asked.
The house was quiet even with the TV on. “Jarvis, can you play something?"
“That isn’t fair to you,” he said.
“Yeah, get in line,” said Clint.
“Tony-
“So now you’re just going to leave me here? Like my dad.”
*****
"How about Abraham?" said Steve.
"It wasn't."
"Dr. Bloom is amazing, but it was clear by how your doctor reacted that she wasn't the best fit," he said.
"Gluten-free waffles, sir," said Jarvis.
“No, I need to do this,” said Steve.
“Papa would always run his fingers through my hair when he read me a story. Do have any stories?”
It was no longer a clump of cells. No, now it had a heartbeat.
"Put me down."
"I don't know." He remembered bits and pieces from different decades, but nothing was clear. There was no number he could put together.
He jerked away instinctively, blinking fever bright eyes free of sweat as Bucky's round dirt streaked face came into focus.
“Tony, why don’t girl butterflies like to be pretty?” Maria asked, tugging gently upon his trouser leg and Tony smiled.
, so help him.
There was an unexpected feeling of nostalgia for Tony as he walked onto the grounds of saint Péter's.  He'd never been overly fond of the abbey but he had spent twenty years of his life behind its walls he reasoned as his feet crunched over the snow covering the cloister.  Even on a cold day in early winter there were monks walking about, braving the wind and chill in their robes, looking like stalwart penguins as they walked to and fro in small clusters.
“I’ll have these orders ready for you by tomorrow Captain. Enjoy your evening with your family, but on second thought, the girl who does the running has not been well. Can you come by early to pick up your things?”
The admission didn’t surprise Tony, though he felt a similar twist of anguish in his gut as he’d felt when Farkas had said something along the same lines. All the birds truly were flying the coop.
"That for the Mag?"
“Do you not want to know his symptoms?” The housekeeper spoke up from the back of the room, reminding everyone again of her presence. She'd taken a step closer to the bed herself, her red brows drawn together in confusion. No one could miss the stark accusation in her voice.
district. We cannot bring his daughter in for question based on rumors!”
“And I'm sorry.”
He’d followed the men who had pursued Steve away from the crash, fearing with every step that Steve would be shot before Bucky could catch up to them, or recaptured and bound toward Berlin at a pace too quick for Bucky to follow. But Steve, lucky bastard that he was, kept to the thickest parts of the wood avoiding their bullets, eventually forcing his pursuers to abandon their vehicles altogether.
The Kindertransport was for children in direr states than his own and would require splitting the them up. Families couldn't support seven children, and Steve, he just couldn't bring himself to separate them. There was still time to think of something else. It wasn't just his selfish desire to keep them close either. His mind drifted back to Strikers letter. He and the children were in a glass box, much like Artur's insects, afforded little privacy when they were so needed to perform in the governments parade.
“Yes. He is cruel to us. That day, on his way in the pub he struck a boy who had set up outside and refused to move. The boy was so small, I tried to stop him, and he struck me too.”
Canonically her "self" was something stolen from her and she was molded into a weapon. The Natasha we know now is a product of her breaking free and stitching herself into something of her own making. We definitely wanted to pay honor to that with her character arch: tangled up in a dangerous web of lies, being conditioned by the Nazi machine. It gave us a lot of room to develop some of her canonical trust issues and dubious code of ethics, but more importantly bring gravitas to what is at stake for the whole family. The war changes them all, threatens everything they have and everything they are.
“Everyone I know has been there loads of times. My father practically lives there now. Mother is always complaining that he’s there too often.”
MUSIC: SECOND FANFARE.
“Scare her? She’s not some poor woman with a Slavic brute breathing down her neck, what’s she got to be scared of?” Hammer laughed, wiping the residue of his breakfast away in a ridiculously fastidious way considering his earlier chewing like cattle.
As quickly as he could force his brain to work, Tony leaned back and assessed the situation, calculating. He could feel that Steve was only half hard against him, and the captain was shaking with the strength it had taken to push himself back up on his elbows. Tony doubted sincerely that he’d be able to reach a full erection if they continued to stress his body. It was purely a miracle of stubbornness that he’d made it this far, and it would truly surprise him if Steve were able to achieve orgasm at all.
Dvořák sighed and stood, saluting Ssgt. Zimmerman as he did so and holding out his hand for one of the trays.
Steve’s mouth twisted upward in a near smile. Tony was always right. When hadn’t Steve wanted to die?
Benjamino had said that night in December, Tony, Stefen, the Rabbi and the men of Tony’s family clustered around the little table in the back of the kitchen.
Nothing. He tried again, his voice breaking, “Tacha, are you here? James!” He tried not to curse his own voice echoing back at him, endless and hallow. The crooked sign of a squat little building calling itself the Behringer administrative offices caught his eye and he strode toward it. The windows were broken here as well, and the rioters had clearly had their way with the place, but at least it wasn’t on fire. The front office was nothing but floating piles of smashed furniture (broken pipes here too) but there was a hall behind it leading towards a service kitchen.
Péter had declined to go on the outing into town to everyone’s surprise but Tony’s, choosing to hide in his room until Tony could excuse himself from the stifling interview with Frauline Werner.
She’d guided him to bed many nights and most of them he barely seemed to recognize where he was, let alone who she was.
It was silent for a long tense moments before finally Prince Loki said what weighed so heavily on all their minds.
The children had been checked for lasting injuries. Artur's knees had needed dee-pebbling from a hard fall. Tacha's head needed ice, James and Ian both had scrapes and cuts littered all over them but none that looked to need stitches. They were all fine, but Tony couldn’t seem to stop his hands from shaking regardless as he tended to them. Helpfully, Ian took over for Tony wiping off Maria's face and arms while she whimpered.
“Bucky
Tony had forgotten that the phone in the dayroom was an older model without a dial, but anxious to reach the Captain before he might leave his rooms he sighed, fetching the ear peace off the cradle and taking the seat beside the table while he waited to be connected to the operator.
Steve struggled up onto his knees, one hand open, reaching to stay the man’s hand. He looked as if he would strike her, gun or no gun.
“Stefen, you have seven children.” his eye’s twinkled at Steve as he drained the rest of his glass. “Got to keep up with them somehow, right Cap?”
“That's where my father used to sell bread, after he left Malta. He’d bring leftovers home and crack the crust for me at night.” Sam recounted, pointing out the window to an abandoned shop. They watched it pass in silence, and it seemed the rattle and shake of the car as it rolled down the street spoke louder than words.
“Right away, sir” the operator said over the line. Tony waited, so anxious he wasn’t sure he was still breathing. He closed his eyes again, concentrating on pulling in a breath through the tightness in his chest. He staunchly ignored the strange hitching in his breath.
Tony thought he saw her shoulders tense, something opaque flashing in her eyes but she didn’t cringe at the rebuke.
There had once been a Stefen Rogers that hadn’t aimed to please anyone at all, but that man was long gone. Traded for this man who had to force his lips into a smile and dance for a crowd he despised, and he did not know what Baroness Shrader thought she knew about him but she didn’t know the half of it.
James had immediately wanted to follow him and all it had taken was Ian telling him to stay put to bring on the latest melt down.
Ian felt his cheeks flush with embarrassment, and he had the distant urge to stick his tongue out at her back, but that was childish and Da really needed him to be a man right now.
“Tony.” Stefen pressed, tightening his grip. Not enough to hurt but enough to impress upon him his seriousness and Tony frowned down at his hand.
was who mama had been.
“I was speaking with Tony. It sounds like your schoolings coming along real well.”
“What’s this? My crusted roast won six times at the Spring festival!” she huffed and Ian bit back a laugh.
“Then we give you a good reason to come back.” Tony shot back, thoughts already racing to find a solution to the problem. Then the answer was there, clicking into place like a puzzle piece.
Ian lay where he'd collapsed, the fabric of the music rooms sofa biting into his face as he pressed it into the cousin.
Rachol and Stefen had both given up the past to survive in the present; to find love and build new lives. They resented Bucky for holding on, for reminding them daily of what they’d let go of by not doing the same. God knew he’d had chances. He thought forlornly of Laura. The woman who’d loved him and wanted to make a life with him. He’d walked away from her during the war to watch Steve’s back. Because he was rom and
"Good morning Children," he greeted them gently, rethinking his plans to go and visit the abbot that morning. He knew why he had to take the mission, but there was still time before they had to be in Dachau.  Maybe the children needed him more.  He doubted very much that their father was capable right now of paying much attention to the state they were in, or would know what to do about it even if he was.
“Yeah they get stuck.” Bucky replied making a nasty face with tongue poking out and James giggled.
He saw the moment Tony found whatever it was he was looking for. His breath hitched in his chest as Tony closed the last inch of distance between them, a tender press of lips agents his own pulling a groan from somewhere deep within Steve’s chest, just under his heart.
When he pounded on the door there was no immediate answer. He knocked again, only pausing when he heard the shuffling sound of footsteps behind the door and the grating of metal as the mail slot was pushed open.
“Antony.” Pepper cleared her throat and all eyes turned to where she was standing, smoothing Maria's perfect hair. She nodded encouragingly at the girl urging gently, “Go on Sweetheart.”
Steve’s eyes scanned the entirety of the mezzanine, but no one appeared to be paying them any attention. Their travel papers said that they were from Poland, and they matched those of the group they were traveling with. The delegation tried to send groups from the same region together. It struck Steve as a particularly thoughtful gesture. They were off to strange new worlds, but they would build community together, united by thier language and their struggle. ‘
“It’ll be alright.” He heard himself say, for the first-time half believing it could be true. His hand flittered over Tony’s neck, feeling the fluting pulse underneath his fragile skin. “Just take a deep breath. Stay with me, Stark.”
His mind flittered back to the shops. Tony wouldn’t try running far with the little ones. He’d look for a place to hide. Many of the shops had apartments upstairs, attics, cellars… Steve took off like a shot.
“Yes.”
Tony took a deep shuddering breath, ignoring Natacha’s hateful glare and pulled his arm firmly but gently from Ian’s slack grasp.
“It’s good to know Bakhuizen, that your charm never fades,” Tony was saying as Steve hoisted himself up to sitting, wincing slightly at the sensation of vertigo.
~*~~*~
Stefen groaned, the sound pushed from behind his teeth. Muscle corded tight under Tony’s fingers, becoming unnaturally hard, and then Stefen twitched violently. One big spasm followed another as his body absorbed the chelant. Bucky pressed down with a resolved grimace, holding him tight despite Stefen’s best effort to pull away.
“He's a fucking lovesick idiot over Stark. Aint that the truth? And Stevie’d tear the world apart for the people he loves, believe me, gadje, I would know. I watched him do it once already. He’s never gonna learn to stand down. You’ll catch your death waiting on it.”
And judging by the man’s smile he damn well knew it.
“While I'm gone I’ll require you to send me a daily update on the children either by mail or phone. I’ll need to know of all their comings and goings and the progress of their lessons. The more detailed, the better. Is that understood Herr Stark?”
Tony snickered, though in truth the close assessment made his heart quicken.
"Major Rogers. Don’t force us to remove you," warned the stern-faced officer, a lieutenant judging by the stripes on his jacket. His eyes flicked down to Artur who was clutching tight to Stefen's middle, shaking with sobs, and for a surprising moment Tony saw pity flash through them.
Tony dropped the ink pen with a shudder and wrapped his arms around himself, feeling suddenly very small and very alone. He thought about the children-pictured each of their faces bent in concentration over their letters to their father- and took a deep breath, releasing it slowly.
Stefen returned just as they were wrapping up the days abridged lessons, the clothes from Themen in hand. There was relatively ordered chaos for a while as faces were scrubbed, bows were tied and shoes shined.
Tony leaned his head back to blink slowly up at him. His nimble fingers had worked their way into Steve’s hair and were now holding his head steady. His eyes looked deeply into Steve’s, diving through the depths in search of what lay hidden inside, and a glimmer of that quicksilver smile appeared. Steve hadn’t known how much he needed to see it again until it was being given to him.
“You can fiddle with that all you like you know, but you can’t make it any more perfect.” Tony murmured. He rubbed at his eye absently, the aggravated white turned pink standing out now that he was so close to Ian.
Steve’s hands clenched on the steering wheel in a white knuckled grip, his eyes stuck on the road and the familiar scenery. They were close now. So close to home. Steve just wanted to see the children, his eyes suddenly hungry for them, the impulse to gather them close and run away from this madness stronger than he’d ever felt it. But it was a dangerous whim. They were being watched. Schmidt would not simply just let him leave the country.
Steve did not know what had happened to Gustavo Pisani. Maybe he’d crossed a line with the woman and his death wasn’t connected to the other two at all; but either way the man preyed on the meek and bullied the innocent. Justice had finally caught up with him.
“No!” Stefen snapped quickly and Tony jumped. Curiously the captain’s neck flushed pink. “I wanted to give you this in private, cause you need to understand. I don’t know if you’ll like it. Please don’t get mad before you let me expl-”
Stefen pulled him closer and Tony tensed, thinking he was about to be kissed and somehow terrified of that fact, but Stefen just tucked Tony tight to his chest, arms wrapping securely around his back and held him. Tony shuddered, eyes closing as he clutched the back of Stefen’s shirt.
“Come on bambina. There you go, just...” An arm thwacked him and her head ducked underwater momentarily. When Tony lifted her up a quick moment later she spluttered and clutched at him, kicking her legs wildly.
"Baroness Schrader, how lovely to see you again," Herr stark acknowledged her with a surprised lilt in his tone. It was irritating, if only because he had a right to his surprise.
She’d known how to tell the children when it was okay to be loud and when they must be quiet without shattering their innocence and turning their home into a tomb.
if I had a hunchback?” She paused while Tony laughed in surprise, a smile tugging at her mouth fleetingly before it disappeared. “Mother told me once, when I was very small, that he and father were a perfect match because father would always need him, and James needed needing. After she died and father pushed him away, I understood what she meant.”
“More to the point. I’d like you to secure a spot on whatever transport Captain Rogers has arranged for Richter and the others. I made Clinton’s brother a promise many years ago that when he came of age I’d see he made it back to his uncle in France. The way things are right now, I don’t know if he’ll have another chance.”
Steve blanched.
“You’ve always left it to Pepper and me to put the children to bed.” Tony pointed out as he sank to his knees in front of Stefen and began unlacing his boots.
“You’re a bastard,” he hissed. Nik didn’t nod or anything, though he likely knew it was true. Only a bastard would use Yinsen like this-just to shut him up.
Tony had run for the abbey and had practically screamed the walls down before Nik had agreed to fetch the police. He’d been told by a cold eyed altogether too bored officer that Yinsen had been arrested and taken to prison for abducting him and would likely face execution for the crime. Tony had insisted there had been no abduction and Nik had provided proof that Tony’s father had intended him to be committed to the monastery in the event of his death and an investigation had been launched; but the whole thing had been muddled from the beginning what with Hughard arranging it all in secret and Obadiah frantically searching for him after the riot that had taken the lives of Tony’s parents. By the time Obi had managed to get everything cleared up it had been too late.
“There you are!” a voice shattered the silence and the lock on their gazes.  Hermann Göring stomped into the study, one hand shoveling in his breast pocket for a cigarette. He was followed at a much slower pace by Senior Leader Willham Striker.
Steve glanced to his left, to watch Natacha. She was sitting quietly, nibbling from the small portions of sausage she'd cut up on her plate, watching the conversations at the table with an unreadable expression.  It was not so unusual to find himself set apart from everyone else even in full room surrounded by love and comradery, but he didn't like to see how often his daughter was similarly afflicted. At least this time he knew the cause, and that he could do something about it.
“Ti amo, Tony.” she said, so simply, so proud of how her lessons were coming along.
“Don't go.”
But Tony doubted Frau Klein could even hear herself think in this racket so tonight at least, the antics of young boys would go unpunished. He did swipe the mug of cider out of Ian’s hand on his way by, giving the lad a quelling look when he squawked like he would protest.
Compromised? Retired? Now what did any of that mean? Steve supposed it had been too good to be true to think that he was going to get out of a conversation with the intelligence office without wading through some riddles.
A little voice panicked in the back of his mind, the fear of hurting Tony dousing the anger like water. It left him feeling drained and woozy in its wake, exhausted.
It was a risk to go running through the dark when the police were out looking for a murderer but by some miracle Steve made it to the house unhindered. As was their usual habit, Tony’s family had moved to the living room after they’d finished supper. When Steve came slamming through the door, he startled them all so badly that several voices shrieked at once and James squeaked and dove off the couch onto the floor.
“Where is our monk anyway?”
“-Stark”
"I thought you said the staff would be relived." she interrupted and now, Steve’s face began to mirror her confusion.
“Father, may I be excused?” Péter interrupted.Steve eyed him, for the rudeness, but in truth he couldn’t blame the boy for making his escape. He only wished he could do the same.
Péter wiggled in his seat, words all but battling their way past his closed lips as he tilted his head, eyes questioning.
He could work with that.
“Thank you, Captain, for the thought, truly, but I… I’m afraid I have nothing to wear.” Tony cringed at the words. He had nothing to
He could get a good look around, see if he could find any trace of Stevie the gestapo might have missed. He’d parked the car a little down the road, ready if anything went south.
It was so hard to believe that the man who’d brought them to Vienna was his father, that sometimes he thought he’d blink only to find that he’d dozed off in his bedroom back home.
This shouldn’t have happened! He always slept nearest the door so he could defend the others when trouble came and always known when any of the others got up in the middle of the night. Steve reached for his shoes, and though he tried to move quickly and quietly, the door, when he reached it, opened with a creak and woke Tony.
“Natacha, didn’t you hear me calling you?” the boy in question appeared before her, Ingrid and Sophie parting like the red sea to make room for him and his cocky grin. He knew he was handsome, and loved that he could make the girls blush and twitter after him. Natacha wanted to tip him down the stairs. Only an idiot stood so close to the edge.
“He never talks about her.” Ian denied with a shake of his head and a startlingly contemptuous expression. “He forgot all about her, and mother.”
“As long as you don’t mind speaking it with an Italian accent I don’t see why not.” And then, just to test a theory he tacked on a dare. “If you think you can that is. It’s a lot to take on.”
“The opera tonight, it’s been so long since I’ve been I don’t even care what the show is.” Tony immediately replied with a telling amount of eagerness and Stefen smiled.
came to me, Tony,” Nik replied, drawing out the man’s name with a poignant look and Tony halted mid breath.
“For God's sake Stefen, let the man look at you. Let someone!" Baroness Schrader snapped, her composure slipping as she caught Rogers flailing hand and clutched it desperately. "Because I swear on my life, I’m not going to look those darling children in the eye and tell them you died because your pride wouldn’t let you see a doctor!”
“Samuel said you had gathered something from the garden?”
Despite his labored breathing the wounded man fiercely muttered the prayer. As his breathes began to rattle, bleary brown eyes sliding past Bruce, who continued to work on him, his eyes locked with Tony’s. They were wet with tears and full of desperation. His mouth gaped open, twitching uselessly around words he no longer had breath for.
“Thinking about war and death chills a body, that’s all.” Tony explained. Stefen turned his head back and looked out over the harbor, contemplating something deeply.  Tony sighed. “I wish tomorrow we’d wake and it would be over.”
If he did close his eyes he knew what he’d see staring back at him.
A smile tugged at his lips.
And Dvořák felt sorry for him, he really did. He couldn’t imagine living his life like a baser animal, with only sub desires to guide you through a world meant for intellectuals like him.
Of course, that was all gone now, swallowed by the Reich. Now they had to outwit their enemy and play the long game of survival. One day the Reich would fall away, the way these regimes always did, and when they did, there would be good people ready to rebuild – to learn from the mistakes of the past.
"You're Herr Stark." It wasn't a question.
There was a single man waiting on the dock with a lantern held high. He was wrapped in a heavy winter coat, his white robes peeking out from under his coat hem and dragging in the snow.
The Germans were coming. The very air seemed to know it, grew heavy and thick with the foreboding of it. With Charlotte gone, there was only one route of escape left. They would go into the mountains to hide until the resistance could organize enough supplies and a safe route for the family to escape to Switzerland on foot.
“You have someone spying on me.”  It was a statement rather than a question because Coulson had already admitted as much, but Steve knew it went deeper than that. It was in the man’s confidence. Coulson believed he knew enough about Steve to have the upper hand, to know what moves he’d make. You didn’t get that simply by watching someone’s movements, you did it by getting close. Someone close to him was watching him.
She paused, her voice lowering. “Especially when his position needs to be filled as quickly as it does.”
. I won't go!"
The man, smartly dressed in a long coat and hat, watched them closely, lifting a cigarette to his mouth, eyes intent.
“German?” Bucky asked, eyebrows rising and she nodded.  Bucky grunted, stifling the urge to say something rude. Nele was a nice girl. It was probably a good thing she’d ended up married to someone decent, instead of shackled to the likes of him, though he wasn’t much sold on the decency of Germans.
Madame Curie could have done so much more if people had cared less about stupid things that clearly didn’t make the difference they thought they did. The science journals decried Einstein for being a Jew but they were just as wrong about him. They were wrong about so much, but there was nothing Péter could do about it. If his father, a respected commander in the army, was too scared stand up against them then what could Péter do?
"I need you Tony." Steve whispered. the confession nowhere near as bare as the expression he wore as he reached with one hand, still shaking, and curled his fingers around one of the bright gold coins that hung from Tony's neck. Steve had no great strength left in him to force anything, but Tony followed that barely there pull like dust caught in planetary orbit.
They were lucky they had not been caught, but it was only a matter of time. The baroness had said that Tony and Uncle Bucky would be here to help them but neither of them were here.
He collected his things and assisted Frauline McCabe with gathering hers. Though he doubted his cheeks echoed the flush of excitement coloring the girl’s face as they departed the train, Tony’s eyes searched the crowd just as eagerly.
“You make a fine beer Willamina.” He praised and the cook chuckled.
What a hypocrite he’d been.
“And what, make you?” Tacha raised an eyebrow, folding her arms over her chest, always a dangerous sign.
But even pale and weak Rogers managed a glare.
“I don’t want more. That’s the end-”
Supper came and went without any sign or word from Jann. Bucky sat alone in a corner of the room with the maps, still considering them and pouring over the possible routes Schmidt might choose to get Stefen to Berlin for his execution date. The Reich had been working nonstop to dig more roads for military transports. It was all well and good to take a guess, judging by what they knew of Schmidt, but there was too big a chance that the intelligence they had wasn’t up to date, and that they’d miss Steve entirely.
"The bell rang for supper so you're late, as usual." Bucky said, saying nothing more of his worries or about the task looming darkly on the horizon.
Because hours were limited and classrooms of this sort scattered throughout the city, the children rotated professors and subjects each day. During class, Natacha always sat in the same space under the window. She gazed out it, volunteering little, seemingly paying little attention to what was going on around her. But with Natacha, it was better not to trust in how things seemed.
He knew Tony was right, that allowing the children to sing wasn't going to put them in any more danger than they were already, being forced as they were to accompany him all over Germany and perform at the parties of prominent Nazi party members. He even agreed with Tony's line of thinking that if the children were going to be forced to perform for the entertainment of the Nazis, that they may as well get some pleasure out of performing for their neighbor. But Steve couldn't help his nerves. He had that itch on his skin, the one that said duck, and he'd learned to trust it over the years.
“I’d probably shoot you.” Steve joined in with a pointed stare at Coulson. He and Bucky weren’t going to be so easily trapped as that. There was no telling what sort of recording devices the man might have hidden in the pockets of his suit jacket.
“Well for me, but the children will benefit from my improved temperament.”
“Are you all right, Uncle Bucky?” James asked from his right, peering up at Bucky with pinched worried blue eyes.
Seiger’s eyes flickered nervously yet again to the door but he need not have worried. Stefen hadn’t thought about anything but the children. Was uninterested with anything outside of them. Even moving to phone charlotte had taken second place. Tony didn’t think that would change anytime soon.
"I must say. You’re not at all what people expect you to be. Are you? I noticed you’re flying the Austrian flag, but not the German one.” He noted conversationally, false friendliness dripping from his tone. “A very interesting choice. Aren’t you worried it could lead someone to doubt your patriotism?”
“Relax. I wasn’t sneering at you Tacha.”
“What happened?” this time Tony was the one to voice the question, walking slowly toward the young man trembling on the chair and laying what he hoped was a comforting hand upon his shoulder.
“Alright but go straight home this evening. I don’t want you on the street after dark.” Tony didn’t say anything about what their father’s reaction would be should they not be safe indoors before the lights came on, but neither boy really needed him to. Neither did Péter, who strolled out a few minutes later. Tony waited by the door after he had gone for Natacha to appear for another twenty minutes. When there was still no sign of her, he began to worry. He debated on going inside to look, concerned that she might be on her way out right that moment.  He could easily miss her in the large hotel.
He held up a hand to still any reply from Tony, reeling with the storm of emotions that were clawing through his chest.
Key Guide
He’d never change, and he’d never learn. Dvorak would do well to cut ties with him while he still could. Do Rogers in before he could do them both in… but here he was, on his way to the man’s house to drag him out of bed, stand him up, and save him once more from his folly; because somewhere deep in Dvorak, it meant something to know that Rogers would never change. He would always be exactly what he was, and no matter how they disagreed Rogers would have his back, one soldier to another, trusting that Dvorak would do the same.
“I've often wondered why a man of your skill chose to work with children, Stark. Or was it because they're my children?”
“Péter? What the devil are you doing?!” Tony demanded as he hauled the boy inside, ignoring the cold and wet that seeped through his nightclothes.
“Christ, is it ever.”
She knew the answer was not always. She wasn’t a fool. But when one was in love, what was there to do but hope?
The ice? He wondered. How would ice help?
Tony really wanted to believe that this was all there was to it. That those twins had really been a pair of performers in some act of Bakhuizen’s that the Captain had shuffled through his home as quickly as possible to avoid gossip but it didn’t add up.
“Why would it be blocked?” The woman fretted below and her husband let out a curse as he gave one last heave, before answering.
“Britain has an army, and a lot of allies. If they know what’s going on here, they could help. They could force the Führer to step down.” He finally said, with a decisive little nod. “It’s worth it. Even if the Germans hear.”
Or at least it seemed that way to Tony, that Stefen was the only fixed point in a great swirling blur. There was nothing but Stefen’s hands on his skin, hot and firm in their touch, and nothing in the world so important as his gaze, in all its darkness as the black of his eye swallowed blue.
“Yes!” she chirped, basking in Tony’s attention and he felt another smile split his face.
Steve set their things out to dry as best he could in the limited space while Tony directed the children to strip out of their wet garments and double up on two of the pallets, wrapping themselves in their blankets. Steve’s eyes flicked from the remaining bed and back to Tony, whose mouth curled into a weary smile as he breathed a small sigh.
“Baka. Is it because of her?!”
"Move along now!" The impatient asshole who had bumped Tony grouched, and out of the corner of his eye Tony saw the young man in front of the woman turn, kodak gripped tightly between dirty hands like he thought someone might rip it from his hands.
Artur's stomach felt like it was full of ants. Waiting was very hard, and it was even harder not to keep looking at Charlotte to make sure he hadn't missed the signal that meant it was time for their adventure to start. Frau Hogan had told them not to cry when she and Herr Hogan said goodbye that morning. Everything was going to be alright. They were running away with Tony and Uncle Bucky, but the bad men mustn't know. When he'd asked if they were going to get vati, she'd told them that vati would catch up to them. Artur was very good at keeping secrets but it was hard to wait. He wanted to see Tony.
"Be still." he ordered brusquely when Bucky flinched.
That strangled little choking sound still coming from him- Tony had seen animals led to slaughter less frightened.
And that was exactly it wasn’t it? Because Charlotte and the gossipy ladies of her social circle couldn’t know the full extent of it. How could they without the full picture?
Natacha took a deep breath.
Dvořák sighed.
The cabin was small. The walls dark cherry wood, were lined with various animal parts and the hunting tools of a bachelor. There was a kitchen with a sink, a small pantry and a little wooden table just below a window to the right of the door. An open stretch of floor covered by a fur rug was between it and the large wood framed bed that took up the length of the opposite end of the house. There was a large fireplace between the two ends with a rocking chair set beside it, and just to the left of the door Tony spotted the rickety looking ladder that led up to a square opening, into what Tony could only presume was the loft.
Steve had been on his way to his study, still on edge from a meeting with General Schmidt. Try as he might he hadn’t been able to shake the uneasiness the meeting had left him with. Steve had looked up from his papers to see Artur sitting on his knees next to Maria in the garden brandishing that stick. He’d heard his son's voice, still sweet with youth, start to sing and thwack the bushes, his little arm swinging the stick in sharp arcs. The body of the bush shaking and spasming violently, and all the while Artur was singing. Singing and stabbing.
He buried his face in his hands. Between Striker and Schmidt he did not know which way to turn these days. Risk to his life was something he'd come to expect, almost didn't quite know how to live without if he was honest, but recently the target had shifted. Now it was pointed at him through his children.
"Can we sing about our favorite things?" Maria asked hopefully from where she was squeezed between Natacha and Charlotte.
The morning of his departure from St. Péter’s Abbey Tony packed a small bag full of what meager possessions he owned, said goodbye to Bruce in the infirmary (the only man at the monastery who came even close to being called a friend) and went to his workshop to close it up in that order. He’d dismantled what inventions he’d stored there for fear of them getting into other hands and being reverse engineered. Tony’d had more than twenty long years at the abbey and no ships to occupy him so he had let his curiosity take him anywhere and everywhere that feasibly gotten materials would allow, including weaponry. He did not trust his work not to eventually fall into Nazi hands and he wasn’t sure he trusted it in Father Niklas’ hands either. He was far too fond of his little war games.
He sat Artur down next to Sara and bolted after Ian, Artur’s screaming sob of protest ringing in his ears. He’d only made it halfway into the hall when Tony grabbed him by the collar and hauled him back.
Steve had lost his faith in prayers. And as if to reaffirm that conviction Grig dropped a bomb on them with his next announcement.
When Tony and the boys managed to haul the tree back to the cabin and hang the sled in its place beside the back door, he waved them inside, instructing them to leave the task of creating firewood for later. For tonight at least there were more important things to think about.
“He barely knows you. Why would Tony not like you?”
“So that’s the score, is it?” Stefen asked with deceptive calm. The hand the captain still had resting upon the table curled into a fist. Pike watched the motion for a moment before his eyes lifted again, meeting Stefen’s gaze.
almost as badly, was that your mouth tended to get ahead of you. At least if your name was Tony Stark it did.
Sam perked up. “Yes, sir?”
Steve dropped his hands and took a step back.
But he was a scientific mind and fantasy did not become him.
He’d wait, he decided, and watch a little more. Grabbing the pen and paper again he scribbled a note for Bruce asking for advice on heart ailments.
Steve was torn between wanting to ring the man’s neck sometimes and kissing him senseless. He was so brilliantly, vexingly much.
“Don’t I know it. Everyone’s slow out of bed this morning. Poor Cameron is going to catch it when he finally shows his face. Though Hammer’s not here yet either and that’s the oddest bit. Poor Harold’s down with the furnace now, though he looks ready to fall over dead. Poor man.”
"You have to get out of here. There's still time to -"
Rochel’s husband saw no reason to leave Poland and his sister refused to split apart the little family she had created. And then there was Bucky.
"I thought you kids wanted a Christmas tree?" he hollered, and the children enthusiastically replied that they did. " Let's get this wagon train moving then."
“If you let him die Herr Doctor. You will follow him.”
’ seemed a rather selfish problem to fixate on.
"Vienna?! No, we'll call someone closer." Charlotte scoffed.
"But he's our tutor!" Artur insisted furiously, temper brightening his cheeks red. "He's supposed to be teaching me about bees and what about Maria's voice lessons? His aunt can't have him all the time, can she?"
The yard was full of party guests, all of Steve's neighbors and their families coming from their farms and homes, bringing good food and good cheer with them. They looked completely at odds with Charlotte's more distinguished guests, all come from the city in their expensive jackets and sleek automobiles; but it worked somehow.  Steve knew he had her to thank for that.
“Damn. We thought you were the captain.” He said, stepping closer and into the light spilling in from the window.
“It's nothing,” Steve hissed between his teeth, squeezing an arm around his middle. Bending double just increased the pain but his breath was hitching in his lungs and when he looked up into Virginia’s worried face it swam before him. He closed his eyes trying and failing to grasp a decent breath.
“There’s something I’ve been thinking about doing. Your father wouldn’t approve… but I think it’s the right thing.”
All and all he hadn’t faired too badly for someone who’d fought through a mob. Compared to Tony, who was sure he was black and blue from the beating those men had tried to give him. Tony tasted the fear again in his mouth, stale and bitter. He was so god damn tired of being afraid.
