Steve can see when Tony realises he's teasing.
'I don't want to do this without you,' Steve breaks his silence.
'What's a mechanised carriage?'
He sits up straight suddenly, realisation in his eyes,
'Steve, baby, you ok?'
'I... I've seen...' how do you tell your boyfriend that you may have once accidently seen a clip of him with his dick up another guy's arse? 'On the internet. You were...'
'Then we don't need to know,' Steve tells them, decisively. 'If it's Tony's business then we can respect that.'
'He doesn't want this, Pepper.'
'That's quite the theory, little man,' Clint grins at him.
*          *          *
What Steve wouldn't give to be able to pull that man into his arms...
Steve stands up and glances around,
'No,' Tony agrees, 'but what happens now will be. Seriously, Pep, what would happen? Split custody? Jim spends the weeks in the penthouse and the weekends with Steve?'
He man looks at him, looks around and then back to him,
'Hmm,' Tony pushes Steve back into the sofa and leans to take a nipple into his mouth.
*                                  *                                  *
‘Still am, for the record!’ Tony informs Steve sounding unnecessarily alarmed. ‘I
'Jarvis...'
PS as per a previous comment I have edited this -verse to correct any instances of using 'arc' rather than 'arc reactor' or 'reactor'. If I missed any I'd appreciate a heads up.
For the second night in a row Steve jolts awake as the door to his suite opens. This time he knows what to listen for so he recognises the padding of small feet coming closer.
'I'll always be here, if you need to relax,' Steve smiles at him.
'Oh,' Pete doesn't sound very comforted.
Steve has his hands fisted in the material of Tony's t-shirt and he kisses enthusiastically as Tony tows him out of the lift and walks backwards into the lower penthouse. Tony turns the soldier as he reaches the sofa, he tugs down Steve's clothing and then pushes him down into the seat.
He keeps his arm outstretched in front of him, palm out, and tries the blink his way through the haze in his vision.
'You are staying with me,' Tony tells him. 'Look, Pepper got us a Pete sized chair! When did this arrive?'
'I'm not sure I can afford to lose games against you,' Steve tries to get his expression under control before he looks up.
'I did,' Steve flips Bruce's pancakes one at a time. 'He's playing with Pete and waiting for Colonel Rhodes to arrive.'
'Oh, no, that's fine,' he makes himself smile, 'I'm sure I'll love... terrine?'
'I said no,' he rolls his eyes.
If he watches though... There's still pain, but at least there's no surprise when it comes.
‘I do this every few months,’ Tony nods. ‘I know what I’m doing.’
Tony is increasingly out of it but still flinches from each of the people that prod at him. Steve convinces him, or possibly Jarvis, to remove the suit so the medics can do their work and stays by his side. Tony catches at his hand again as soon as the gauntlet has retracted; Steve laces their fingers together and holds tightly.
'That's weird,' Clint flicks up the mask on the little man to see that it's Dada.
'You get celebrity gossip on Asgard?' Tony laughs.
‘I’m going to bed, Cap. Seriously, stop worrying about me.’
That said he still can't quite bring himself to ask Jarvis where he can find Tony.
'Mean.'
'Were you really going to give me that bike for Thanksgiving?' he changes the subject.
'Alright,' Pepper has been tapping away the entire time. 'Anything else, Mr Stark?' she smiles at him.
'There's always tomorrow.'
'Oh,' Pete considers that. 'Because you're his favourite?'
'It doesn't matter,' she shakes her head then appears to flinch. 'Groundhog Day? Oh, Tony, you're reliving the day?!'
'Sir knows, only too well, how being of the same blood does not equate to a loving family,' Jarvis replies quickly.
(See the end of the chapter for
'Would you like anything else for breakfast?' he hands over the coffee reluctantly.
'Of course you can,' may as well go with it from the beginning. 'As long as you're very careful and do everything Thor tells you.'
'Go to the penthouse,' he gets up and grabs his own pants, 'I'll be up with food in a moment.'
After debriefing Steve heads straight home. Still, it's late in the evening before he finally gets back to his floor of the tower and is able to shower and change.
‘Sir, it is good to see you awake,’ Jarvis sounds relieved.
Steve nods,
'Of course, sir,' Jarvis agrees.
'I...' he's smiling despite himself. 'Thanks.'
Down the corridor, turn left and the staircase is up ahead. He counts the doors and the raps on the sixth as he pushes it open,
The video feed goes dead.
The eggs appear to have offended the good Captain.
Firstly the armour retracts, which doesn't normally happen unless they have confirmed a location safe, and Tony moves to stand behind Steve.
‘Hmm?’ Tony just stares.
'Three days,' Steve is back to looking a little sad.
Tony laughs quietly,
'Oh, but I know you love your late nights!'
‘Oh. Oh! Jarvis, are you upset with me too? Because of my reaction to you being… you when I was downstairs?’
'Hello, Mister Stark!' the reporter jumps to her feet as he steps into the study.
'He'll be moving into his own room soon then?'
Hulk huffs again and lumbers away.
Tony comes awake to a buzzing in the back of his skull,
'Doesn't count,' Tony tells him again. 'You can't loose your virginity over the phone, Steve. We couldn't even
'You realise the potential fallout?' he laughs. 'We're running a team together, he lives in my current main residence and we're about to have a kid together; I can't let our relationship collapse. Also I'm pretty sure Pep made me promise never to fuck virgins.'
To change who I used to be
Tony's brows come together in confusion. "It's in Minnesota. It was a school shooting -- not a bombing -- but still ten people died, I remember it being 2005ish because it was on the news for weeks. There was also, of course, Blacksburg in 2007 -- 33 dead -- but you guys haven't hit 2007, yet, and the only other one that comes close to that was Newton in 2012. I haven't heard of a super major school bombing since the Bath Disaster in 1927. Did that happen here?"
. He’s still nauseous, but no longer in danger of marrying the toilet. “Ugh, you’re a goddess.”
is going on?!
"Take care, Vis. Kick some ass."
, Howard?
“Air Force. He… there was an explosion at the base they were at… and they just up and vanished about a month ago. There isn’t any trace,” the doctor’s voice as gone hollow as if he’s repeating what he’s been told. Tony can only imagine, and he doesn’t want to imagine that kind of pain and suffering.
” Rhodes’ voice is shaking, “
I haunt these halls,
"Where...?" Another contraction hits Tony, and that's when he clues in to the fact that his labor is going to be a terrifyingly fast one. Tony starts to yell and scream with the pain. This one only lasts 60 seconds.
Does anyone remember when I said my previous outline was gonna be 17 chapters? HAHAHAHAHA it's closer to like 27 now HAHAHAHA
She purses her lips, smiles at Tony encouragingly, tell him she’ll be back later, and goes off to find this so-called “secret admirer”.
Steve bows his head and nods gratefully. “I swear. I won’t.”
“Damn. Ugh, God, that is so cliché! Don’t you villainous types have any original ideas? Seriously? Hydra? Lame.”
He should probably not be letting Steve into his home when he’s five months pregnant, baby bump looking more like he’d swallowed a soccer ball than the pouch it’d be with just one. Probably also not a good idea for an alpha to be in the same room with him because he’s really, really
that are somehow instrumental in maintaining balance. These people have abilities that let them affect and bring change to their surroundings. Merlin, the famed wizard of old, is one. King Arthur was another. Doctor Strange's teacher, the Supreme, was also such a being." She pauses for a moment and twists her hands together nervously.
He won't be able to save them if something happens. He won't--
Steve’s eyes are widening in horror and realization. He’s ashen white and shaking when he tells Tony that’s he got to go now.
"Frankly, I don't understand why the Supers haven't sent a designated party to appeal to the government and come to some sort of mutual compromise yet. Like, that's the kind of thing that needs to be done ASAP, yeah? I mean, from what I heard, the Act was all but a sure thing, so time is of the essence and all that jazz."
“In fact, it sounded like it’d be the kind of Top Secret document that even the President would have trouble getting a hold of.” Tony fold his hands together.
Tony probably looks like a fish with the way that he’s moving his mouth. He doesn’t care.
The days pass slowly, biding their time. That's alright. Tony doesn't mind. There's a peaceful air to the Tower that it's never had before. He's known more joy in this last week alone than he has in decades. He's happy. Blissfully so. He rubs his hand over his bulging belly and stares out his windows to the large city before him. A knock comes at his door and he bids whoever it is to enter.
“Do I need to be more specific?” The dude asks.
"Yeah," he grins a little tear in his eye, "they're kicking."
Since he's returned to New York, many things has happened. One: he got to meet a lovely lady called Carol Danvers, two: Jar- Vision - has been with him and been incredibly supportive since his fight with Jacey, three: he no longer feels like he wants to hit Steve with a bus, and four: the babies are perfectly healthy and safe. Helen and Rhodey don't entirely approve of his ignoring Jacey, but he's stewing a bit since the rogue super soldier has been texting him repeatedly.
Someone cares, his heart cheers and it feels like a dam breaks because then he’s got tears running down his face and snot coming out of his nose. He just… he didn’t know.
Tony smiles back tentatively. He purses his lips and explains.
He only hopes it’s not too late for Tony to forgive him. That he still has a chance. He’ll have to thank Tony’s older double later for making him see the error of his ways.
Natasha frowns and watches him. “Stark. You were emotionally compromised. That you managed to function at all is something even the highest trained agents struggle with. You should be proud.”
“To hell with that,” and Rhodey is furious because this
Almost.
Steve has been texting him non-stop. Okay, that’s a hyperbole. He sends one in the morning and one at night. Sometimes, only one in the afternoon. Alright, so maybe Steve only texts him once or twice a week because, the man had explained, Steve didn’t want Tony to feel like Steve was bombarding him. The supersoldier had even told Tony that he could ignore Steve or block him, or whatever.
ah... also... i've been considering getting a beta for this (since i've been doing it myself all this time hahaha and well. it's a lot.) I'm especially interested in an alpha (lol) which I'm told is like someone i can bounce ideas off of and is basically an epic cheerleader in addition to all the regular beta-duties. lemme know if interested.
The Black Widow tenses and purses her lips. “I hate to say ‘I told you so’…”
Tony smiles, a warmth fluttering in his chest. No one’s asked him except for her, and he kind of loses it like a dam that’s too full and falls apart from the pressure, he breaks.
“I love you, Jay.” His smile wavers, but she wraps him in her arms anyways. Her hugs are always the best. They’re warm and soft and make him feel safe and cared for. Yeah, her hugs are addicting.
this. "This" being a much unexpected pregnancy.
And just like rain, the tears keep falling
Tony tries not to think about how domestic it all is. Or how much he wants it.
The two doctors frown, but grudgingly agree. They’ve got a Jeep that looks like its seen better days, but it runs and it’s conducive for the kind of off-roading they’ve been doing way out here in the boonies. Stark lays across the back seat, shuts his eyes, and sleeps.
Steve gestures to the seat by Tony’s bedside. “May I sit?”
Jacey twists her hands together and gets a pinched expression on her face. Her eyes close, and Tony can see that she’s hurting. His brain slowly processes why.
Tony blinks. “Are you from Texas?”
DRAMAAAA
“Wha’?” He throws up some more and asks his AI who the hell she’s with.
“You can’t leave–” He starts to protest.
"Yes, that is what I'm telling you. My abilities... are mostly time related. Healing, jumping forward, slowing down, reversing, reality hopping... I can do all of it, but at a price. Sometimes... sometimes the price is inconceivable. Sometimes, the price can't be paid because the reward is too little. I'm telling you, now, free of charge as best I can that two weeks from today your life
“Oh? What you gonna do, sugar plum? You gonna take out your fancy knives and make me bleed a little? You gonna stick my head under water? Maybe break a coupla fingers? Honestly, torture is all the same; lacks creativity. It’s such a re-run.” Tony makes to shake his head but thinks better of it on account of his mother-of-all migraines.
“...He would’ve seen it, too, if he wasn’t so busy being stuck in the past to look ahead to the future.”
‘Oh,’ Steve casts his gaze around for somewhere to put down Tony’s drink.
His son finds himself a seat at the table; he's clearly been domesticated. Steve puts plates on the table for himself and Pete before returning to usher him over too,
'Good,' Steve repeats.
'Take the muffins,' Tony tells him. 'I'll only throw them away.'
'Anything,' Steve begs. 'Tony please...'
Ok, so he trusts Pepper more than he trusts Steve.
'Don't be smug. Alright, let's do this. Get the muffins on the lift,' he steps out into the main room to find Steve tidying.
'Dada?' he blinks open his eyes to see Pete playing with light from the arc reactor between his fingers.
'Where do you want me, apple pie?' Tony nuzzles his nose into Steve's tensed thigh and grins.
'Why are you briefing us on this, Nicky?' Tony stretches his arms over his head. 'Sector 7 is Coulson's baby.'
'Animated?' Tony blinks.
But Tony had himself injected with an untested serum just because he didn't think he could spare the time to heal.
'No harm done,' he interrupts, gesturing to Pete, before Steve can continue. 'And the first photos they have of him are with him clearly being happy to see me; should cut off many of the complaints, and having you there will have helped.'
'Thank you.'
'You want to go and play, squirt?' Tony glances at Steve and lets his son down.
'That's great,' Clint grins before his face falls and he groans, 'Stark's still going to kill us.'
‘Jarvis?’ Steve calls the moment he jumps from the Quinjet onto the helipad on the top of the tower. ‘Please tell me Tony made it back?’
As they leave, and yes, Tony is leaving a party before the end and isn't massively drunk, Steve suggests they walk through the park. Tony gives him a look and calls him adorable but he agrees easily enough when the others express a desire to do so too.
Clint looks suddenly panicked and shoots a look at Thor, but the demi god is already nodding,
Still nothing.
As soon as they’ve once again bored Loki enough that he retreats back to wherever the hell it is that he is when he isn’t bothering them, they turn to check on Tony. Jarvis has, of course, already told them that physically Tony seems fine.
'Ok!' he steps over to his son. 'Let's be very careful with that, shall we?'
*          *          *
'Come on, upstairs,' Tony tugs him up.
Nothing.
Tony beams at him,
'So you want me to tell Tony to ask out Captain America?' Rhodey sounds a little hysterical.
Thor also likes conversation.
'Bruce is my favourite science bro,' Tony tells his son as his brain summons up how much he had wished Howard would just take the time to talk to him. 'And we're going to get his opinion on that machine I've acquired.'
'Tony! The bomb?' Steve shouldn't need to remind his teammates about this sort of thing.
'Save it,' Steve walks to his bedroom, 'I'm going for a run.'
'Something I can do for you?' Tony doesn't look up.
Tony is massively dependant on his bots though, Steve reasons with himself. Socially, if nothing else, they are his main constants.
Why would muffins make this ok?
'The morning's great,' Tony snarks, 'I just think it should be in the afternoon.'
'I should trust him,' Tony disagrees. 'He's Steve.'
Tony rolls over and glares at the coffee which Steve has left out of his reach.
'Tony...?'
Tony bites a little harder than before and feels the bigger man tense against him before shuddering with his release. His grip around Tony tightens and the genius lets his head drop back against the shower wall as he eyes roll back; fuck, he's so close.
Pete nods and smiles a little shyly at Steve,
'He's probably unpacking,' he replies as he contemplates the ceiling through Jarvis' overlay.
Tony hesitates for a moment and then shakes his head.
'But it's day time,' Pete objects even as he curls against Tony's chest.
‘Why have you been avoiding him?’ Bruce asks when Clint dashes off for more popcorn between movies.
'I believe they would be delighted,' Jarvis also sounds pleased.
The Hulk just stares at him seemingly thrown by this reaction. Steve sympathises.
‘We’re so much better than fine, Tony. Just as long as you’re ok.’
'Yes, baby?'
Leaving the penthouse earlier was definitely a strategic retreat...
‘Would you like company?’ Steve offers. ‘I mean more company. I know you have Jarvis.’
'Sir does not view his possessions as things to be kept to himself,' Jarvis replies from the dash. 'You could have borrowed one before now if you wished.'
*          *          *
'I hadn't thought about it,' he admits and puts in the ear bud. 'Hey, Jarvis.'
'Of course you can stay, but I have to keep working,' he drills another hole to match a mark indicated by Jarvis.
On the bright side he finally gets around to decorating.
‘Yeah,’ Tony just gazes at him honestly unflinching.
There's a small pause before Tony blurts,
'Good to be back,' Tony grins and beelines for the coffee.
'I'm guessing I'll be paid at the normal rate for that service?'
'No idea,' Tony shrugs. 'Jarvis?'
Steve laughs,
'Oh, like either of them would argue with you...' she mutters. She forgets how sensitive the mics are in StarkTabs.
Steve makes himself as comfortable as he can against the wall and watches Tony work as the night draws in.
'Jarvis says it's morning time,' Pete tells him triumphantly.
'Dada...'
The next morning Tony regains consciousness to the increasingly familiar sensation of having a small boy using him as a climbing frame,
'Good,' he replies, 'I speed up and hold you tighter. You're bucking into my hand now.'
'Don't cut the camera,' Steve begs suddenly. 'Promise me.'
'Dada, I can't find my elephant,' Pete has obediently put a selection of toys into a brightly coloured box.
Steve feels himself blanch,
'That's the plan?' Steve finds himself unfortunately charmed by Tony's attitude. 'If your son falls off the edge of a skyscraper it's ok, because your AI butler will catch him with one of your robot suits?'
Pete settles against him briefly before becoming restless,
He stares at her as his brain short-circuits.
'I'm not a pet,' Steve rolls his eyes at the screen even though he knows Tony can't see him. He sends a smiley face quickly afterwards incase Tony thinks he's upset.
'Steve is going to kill me...'
'Ok,' Pete beams and waves to the others, 'bye!'
‘I created the world’s first fully sentient AI and you’ve become an audiobook?’
'I'm not going to make him talk to me if he doesn't want to.'
Steve, for the first time in his life, retreats.
'Thank you, Steve,' Pepper stands up.
'You want to sleep with him,' Rhodey looks like he's contemplating walking out and coming back later.
Tony stares at him.
'Amaze me,' Tony dismisses. 'Whatever you think Cap will like.'
He finds himself staring at his hand and then looks up to meet Clint's incredulous gaze.
Tony has computers in his blood; Tony is insane.
'It can wait,' he shrugs.
'How long on the clock?' Natasha appears at Steve's side.
Tony nods,
‘Shouldn’t you…’ Steve gestures to the bots.
Tony continues to look confused,
'Come on,' Tony gestures to where Steve's loosely holding his phone.
‘Captain,’ Tony looks at him over the glasses. ‘You going to tell me I can’t leave?’
He sits there for another moment before reaching for the earpiece Tony gave him before,
Steve cries out as he arches up; that was a little too close to pain so Tony dials it back for a minute. When Steve's relaxed into the sensation he probes deeper and hits pay dirt.
'So very wrong,' they watch Pete scoop up all the nerf darts and carry them to his dad.
‘I’m going to have the arc reactor removed,’ Tony tells them.
'Hey,' Steve grins at him.
'I did not,' Tony lounges back into the sofa cushions.
'Hey sugarlump,' Tony sounds pleased.
'Night,' he turns back to his drilling.
'I just like the baffled look Cap gets when he's out of his element,' enjoys it a little too much actually.
'You're so certain that it'll end badly.'
But then he does have certain feelings for Tony that clearly aren't reciprocated.
'Nuh uh,' Pete shakes his head. 'I saw pictures though.'
'Why would he look like Steve?' Pepper just looks confused.
'Six...' Steve blinks in surprise.
He starts out jogging but his speed picks up now he's moving towards what he wants. He pulls himself back from a full out sprint as the tower comes into view. The doors open to him as he jogs up and the lift is waiting for him.
'Sure,' Tony just shakes his head with a grin.
Pete is quickly enamoured with the little toy cars and sends them shooting off in all directions across the polished floor. Tony sits cross legged next to him as he puts stabilisers onto the shiny red bike and Steve shakes his head before starting to remove various toys from their packaging.
'And a half!' Pete adds from across the room as he wiggles his way under the couch to reach one of his cars.
'The second level,' he picks up the keys and offers them to Tony without thinking.
'Queenjets,' Pete agrees.
Steve shoots him a strange look and then just laughs as he walks past Peter playing with his nerf gun and sits beside him,
'I need to learn to trust him,' Tony tells her. 'Tell me how to do that?'
'Tony, I need you to take some deep breaths for me, ok?' Tony realises there's something warm cradling his head. 'Tony? Can you hear me?'
‘No worries,’ Tony shrugs. ‘Jarvis is already good with you; I can’t stand my ground without him.’
'It was the most Captain America-y thing I could think of without breaking into song. And it made you smile so...'
‘Certainly, sir.’
'I don't know,' Clarke looks miserable. 'He turned up on his own.'
*          *          *
It's quiet for a moment and then Jarvis speaks again,
'Rhodey only chose me three names and I might need four,' Tony tells him simply as he puts his son onto the seat beside him next to the window. He holds onto the boy's arm as the jet lauches off the side of the helicarrier and then lets him scramble away to look out the window.
'Dada?' Pete lifts his head briefly but then settles back down.
'Good night...' the line cuts before Steve finishes.
‘Sorry, that was mean,’ Tony tells him and the suit barrel rolls.
'I couldn't get him to wait ten minutes for you to finish your press conference...'
'No,' Tony swallows. 'No, you weren't bad. You're not in trouble. Just don't go in that cabinet again, it's got lots of glass bottles in it, ok?'
'Why?' he scowls.
'Yes, sir,' he can hear Jarvis' smile.
Steve has been sitting down quietly for about half an hour now and as he’s mostly convinced that Tony can only see things if they’re shiny, moving or loud (preferably all three) it’s safe to say he’s invisible to the resident genius.
Finally, and Steve feels terrible about as soon as he thinks that, it’s Tony’s arc reactor that gets hurt. Or damaged, he corrects himself, but it’s so easy to think of the reactor as part of Tony now and
'Aww...'
Does Tony realise he saves all his sweetest nicknames for Steve?
‘Sir has agreed to stay in medical until we can be certain he is suffering no side effects from the poison,’ Jarvis adds.
'What about his mother? How did you meet?'
'Of course,' Steve squares his shoulders.
'Sir, the image on your screen matches employee details of a David Clarke,' Jarvis adds into his ear. 'No criminal record, no suspicious internet activity, no suspicious known associates. Tracing the call indicates his location as within the mall visited by Peter, Captain Rogers and Agent Barton.'
‘Calm down,’ Tony finally looks up. ‘Cap, it’s ok. I just don’t leave the arc reactors ready to go in case any ever go walk about. I’m plugged in, the electromagnet’s working; I’m not in danger, it’s just not very comfortable.’
'I warned you. Jarvis, get them to get the jet back out and have my car ready for me outside...'
Tony bites his lip to keep from laughing as Steve pauses for a second and then blushes,
'We need to change that,' Tony scowls. 'Get me everything I'll need.'
STARK, James Steven.
'Cap?'
He starts unbuttoning his shirt.
'Yeah, but that's totally for me because I feel neglected that you won't let me play with the real one.'
'Jarvis can form a 2D image from them,' Tony grins.
'He is meeting with the Board of Directors of Stark Industries.'
'Why did I bring you?'
‘Of course, sir,’ Jarvis agrees. ‘What destination should be logged on your flight plan?’
Tony offers him a more honest smile,
Tony's only reply is to pull something out of the bomb.
'Hey, Pete,' he scoops the boy onto his lap as he sits down on the bed.
'Naturally.'
'The initial pictures are circulating like crazy,' Pepper moves to stand beside him. 'You broke tumblr and twitter...'
'He asked if Pete was an interview before being able to be Jim's dad,' he admits. 'And he thinks I don't trust him.'
to worry you.’
'A toy Lamborghini?' she asks uncertainly.
'Of course,' Steve nods and forces a smile, 'it'll take more than that to get rid of me.'
'It's one of mine,' Tony tells him calmly.
Tony looks horrified and drops to his knees to scoop his son against him,
They play with the cars for a while; Pete makes up an elaborate scenario where Clint's car is trapped upside down under the couch and it's up to the rest of them to save him. Pete is, naturally, the only one allowed to have more than one car, but Steve is given the privilege of using his second favourite.
'I'm awake,' he grumbles.
'Go with your Dada,' he smiles, 'I'll get your elephant and meet you in the garage. Ok?'
'It's super soldier proof,' he latches to that as a subject he knows about. 'That baby has offensive and defensive capabilites, can handle the way you drive like a maniac and is so green that polar bears want to have its babies.'
'Coffee does sound good,' he agrees. 'What would you like?'
'Lies,' Tony shifts closer and slumps against his side.
He looks over his new table with four chairs, one of which has a booster cushion.
'He should have been watching you,' Tony retorts.
'See for yourself,' Tony waves a hand at Pete. 'I looked like that.'
'Yes,' Steve knows he's blushing, 'I owe you a...' he gestures pointlessly with his hands which are still holding Tony against him.
'Do you remember what you were building?' a kiss is pressed to his hair.
'Yes sir,' Jarvis confirms even as he jams the crowbar into the floor.
Howard's Mansion?
'Which one was that?'
‘I thought Jarvis was the youngest,’ Steve says, because if there is one sure way of getting Tony to talk to him it’s to ask him about his tech.
'Sure, as long as Thor knows what he's doing.'
'Thank you,' Tony replies smugly.
'How long do kids even nap for?' Tony asks.
'I brought Tony's things,' she walks past carrying a suit bag and a small selection of toiletries. 'Is he still in the shower?'
Actually, knowing Tony, he'd probably pin it up in the foyer of the building and point it out to everyone he could.
'Why are you grinning?' Steve exclaims. 'Natasha, are you ok?'
*          *          *
Pete laughs in delight as they rise up to the ceiling.
Tony is still curled against him, snoring softly, with his left hand clutching Steve's left bicep.
'Alright.'
, without telling her. The other Avengers seem hurt that Steve didn’t even think to tell them what was going on. Fury seems to take it the best; he seems bizarrely resigned to a life and death situation that would lead Tony to steal a Quinjet and fly a thousand miles.
Steve lifts his head from the wall and then lets it drop back a couple of times.
'And when the baby is born?' Steve decides he doesn't want to ask after that request.
‘It’s actually quite a boost to my ego that you must think that I built this from scratch in the last… how long Jarvis?’
'What?'
'Sir, what has lead you to this conclusion?'
Or maybe You doesn’t like him; that’s possible.
Cheers for sticking with me :-)
'If he sticks around,' Tony continues after a moment, 'then they'll both know it was because he wanted to.'
'Ah, well, there's a complication on that front,' Tony grins as they step onto the lift for the quick trip to the flight deck. 'I'll tell you on the jet, come on.'
The line is silent for a moment,
'Try not to choke, bud,' Tony advises.
'Yeah,' he grins as Steve looks embarrassed and a little proud. 'Well, he's sweet too.'
‘Hey, Capsicle, miss me?’ he asks as Steve briefly presses his face between Tony’s shoulder blades and hugs him tightly.
'Ok,' he picks up his sword.
'Jarvis, Cap went away and I want Dada now.'
‘Ok, I’m missing some time.’
‘Power levels?’
'Thor's back in town?'
Steve just shakes his head,
They can see New York on the horizon when Tony staggers to his feet,
'Oh, sure, blame the kid,' Tony sighs dramatically. 'I'm going to start charging rent, Rogers. Don't you think that I won't.'
'Dropped in a couple of days ago,' he confirms. 'Made my kid's day by giving him a sword...'
'Dummy?'
Perfect excuse to soak up more super soldier warmth.
'I'll have coffee,' Steve rolls his eyes.
'Tony,' Steve gazes at him beseechingly, 'I thought we were friends; tell me how I can make you trust me?'
'That's the fifth door on the left past the green staircase?'
'Dada,' Pete slumps against Tony's chest.
‘Tony?’ Steve tries cautiously. ‘Are you ok?’
'It is Thanksgiving in five days, sir,' Jarvis reports.
'I'm not angry with him,' he blurts.
Tony scowls vaguely,
‘Sure,’ Tony doesn’t look at him. ‘Jarvis’ll call you when Pete wakes up.’
*          *          *
Steve isn’t really sure what to say to that but luckily Tony has already turned away and settled his feet back into Bruce’s lap,
'Hey, Pete,' Steve returns his smile.
He hugs his blanket,
'Yeah,' Tony doesn't look away from staring into his soul.
Being the sole focus of Tony Stark is an amazing feeling.
That’s a hell of a lot of glorious angry muscles.
'Will Ms Potts be joining us for breakfast?' Steve asks.
'What Tony found on the computer isn't important right now,' Steve insists. 'The point is we worked well as a team.'
'Yes,' Steve can hardly say anything else. 'Yes, that's right.'
'You miss me, pet?' Tony smirks and rubs his back.
‘Oh, thank you,’ Steve scrubs a hand across his face and glances at the clock. ‘Four in the morning? Darn it, Tony…’
'Because Captain Rogers' emotional wellbeing is not my concern,' Jarvis retorts. 'You were not ready to tell him so it was not the correct time to tell him.'
'Good morning, Captain,' Jarvis greets him as soon as he's in the hall. 'Hello Pete.'
'Thank you for the motorbike,' Steve adds, 'it looks very... over-engineered.'
Tony looks terrible; he’s leaning heavily against a workbench, his skin pale and shining with sweat. That’s bad enough but Steve can’t tear his eyes from the empty hole in Tony’s chest where the arc reactor should be.
“Lucky for you, Mr. Stark, but I’m an obstetrician, and I can actually tell you what I see when I see it. No unneccessary anxiety for the patient who just came out of a coma, no siree.”
like all the hormones and endorphins in my whole body turned up to fuckin' twenty, so I should--"
“Clint… I… I need help.”
“Hey,” his voice weary and colorless, “either of you have a cellphone?”
“Anyways, Scarlet, what’s your point? Steve and I aren’t an u’hoa pairing.”
The boy sighs and crouches down next to Tony. Tony grabs his wrist and inhales deeply. “Whoa– what the fuck, dude?”
“I didn’t know you’d always been infertile, Tony,” she says with no small amount of surprise.
Her expression becomes pinched and pained. "Tell someone what you choose their names to be, or write it down somewhere someone will find it," she insists.
Sorry for all the dialogue *winces*
, his severe reaction was his whole body rebelling––”
Steve’s breath hitches and he bursts out, “Jesus, no! You’re
Tony’s face closes off and he folds his arms across his chest and turns his body slightly to the right.
Jacey’s smile is large and bright and her eyes are laughing. It’s another one of Tony’s favorite expressions she has.
He doesn’t want to think of the letter because it’ll just piss him off. He still can’t believe the hypocrisy of the damn thing. He can’t get past Clint’s betrayal, either. Natasha’s alliance was good while it lasted, but he knew that where she was wasn’t where she wanted to be, so he’d made the decision for her. He pushed her away by calling her a double agent, despite knowing she wasn’t. He knew why she did what she did. He did. Which is why he pushed her away. Her words hurt, though, and no amount of self-comfort or delusions will fix that. But. He’d been aiming to hurt, so naturally she’d aimed to hurt him back. That hurt too.
“I was
“Tony?” Jacey asks, and by the look on her face he’s been off in la-la land for a while.
He tells her about seeing that old tape playing in the room in Siberia. He tells her about the road and about… how he’d thought it’d been an accident. Sort of. He’s always believed it was a little strange, and seeing Barnes beat his father to death and then strangulate his mother had confirmed those suspicions. He also knew that it meant Hydra had been behind it, and that Barnes had taken something from the car. Nobody should have known what was in the car, which means that someone tipped Hydra off when and where Howard would be with whatever he was going to give to the Pentagon.
Tony groans. "'m so tired..."
and the urge to take him into his arms has never been stronger, so he gently puts his hands on Tony’s shoulders and

“Ah, yes, the famous Stark sarcasm. They warned me about this. Fortunately, I am tolerant.”
A voice from behind them pipes up, "You were warned, Stark."
This… This surprises Steve.
Then, she starts cackling all over again. “Oh, my
p.s. if you want to request a certain scene in any other Avengers universe for us to visit, just lemme know, K? i'll try and work it in ;)
This u’hoa bond is fucking terrifying, Tony thinks. Which makes him so much more confused about what Wanda was getting at because he knows that he and Steve were… intimate, but this? This is a little too much. Even for a closest hopeless romantic like Tony. Something like this… this was just… all-encompassing and all-consuming and Tony didn’t want to depend on somebody like that.
“That’s good, doc, very informative.”
“For our one-year anniversary, he took me to the coffee shop where we first met, and got down on one knee. I told him right then and there that this was it for me. That he was the only one for me, and that I could never love again. I told him that if he was okay with forever -- if he promised to never betray me -- I’d marry him.” A dopey, love-sick, faraway look appears in her eyes as she gets lost in time.
Steve checks the workshop first. Even if his elevator code had worked… He’s not sure this code still will-- is sure they won’t after everything, but figures a failed attempt will at least give Tony some warning.
Stark closes his eyes and folds his hands. “I wanted you to make your own choice. I didn’t want you think that I’d… that I’d hold Pietro against you, so I waited. He’s… he’s still asleep, anyways, and the docs say they’re not sure if he’ll wake up, and I… false hope is... I hoped to spare you if he didn’t–”
“Because you don’t have a scent.”
Rhodey, the ass, thinks this is hilarious. Tony might’ve thought it was funny too, once. You know, when he wasn’t doped up on painkillers and feeling like he was slowly dying. It’s two weeks later and the
“No,” Tony shakes his head, “I’m… I’m going to retire, I think.”
Wanda gets angry. “Why did you not tell me? Why did you keep me in ze dark about zis?!”
Wanda sits down heavily in a chair. “Thank you,” she whispers miserably.
“Uh– it’s not what–”
She exhales a deep breath, and berates herself for always trying to fix everyone’s problems. “Well, Steve,” she says, “I think you’re off to a pretty good start.”
"It will, eventually. In some worlds, the planet dies when it collides with another. These are called the Incursions. In other realities, the Earth is consumed by the sun when the sun goes supernova. And, in one reality I can think of... the planet and it's population are decimated by global nuclear warfare. There's no telling the fate of this universe." She goes quiet and allows the information to sink in.
“I just want you to know,” the blond gives a watery smile, “that you’re the reason I wanted to change who I used to be.”
He starts off with the beginning. His parents: his mother’s soft voice as she plays the piano, a shared secret in the language from his mother’s homeland, and gentle hands petting his hair or rubbing his back when he was ill; his father’s harsh tones, disappointment, and alcoholism that made his childhood difficult. It wasn’t until that fateful Christmas break that he realized his dad had been trying recently. He’d been too focused on the way the words grated and the past to actually listen then, but since his demonstration at MIT, he’s come to terms with his grief and his regrets. Or so he’d thought.
“Oh. Well, good. Anyways, he’s collapsed and Ross is pounding on his doors as we speak. This poses a problem, obviously, as Mr. Stark is not even fit enough to move,
"Jacey," he says gently.

. Tony really should know better than to antagonize his captors.
Horror is next all over Steve’s face. “Oh, God. Oh, God, no. Please, Tony, tell me… tell me I… that this is new.”
“Well, yes, I’m so glad we’re on the same page.”
Steve’s mouth merges into a fine line. A vein ticks and pulses on his forehead. Tony waits patiently and lightly taps his fingers against the table.
“Yup. There’s your vitamins and stuff there. I expect you to down that entire glassful of water before you take them, though. And here’s a gatorade for later. You need the electrolytes and the sugar.”
to sign. He’s just trying to make the best of a crappy situation, I wish you’d understand that, Rogers.”
Tony dials her number and puts the phone to his ear. She picks up on the second ring.
Steve’s heart hammers in his chest because this is all sort of not good. He’s got to wake Tony.
The midwife, Strange, and Steve all ask angrily.
“On a scale of 1 to 10, how badly did you want to jump her bones?”
Luckily, he seems to have forgotten the brunet’s earlier transgression and now looks surprised that Tony’s figured out his nationality. “Yes?”
"I- I- I'm so sorry!"
Her smile is shaky, though, and Tony knows it’s bad. “Alright, lay it on me.”
"I told you, remember? When Wanda did her freaky mind magic on me? I told you I'd seen the aftermath of a battle far worse than we could possibly imagine."

Barton pulls out his phone and squats next to Tony. "Hey, Cap, well we got a little problem. ... No... No, it's another incursion. I know. It's the third one this month, but this one's in a bad way. He can't walk, Cap, so I'm gonna need some cappower-- heh heh--to get him to Reed."

Not now, Natasha shakes her head.
Steve doesn't have the resistance to refuse, so he settles in and sleeps. Promising to himself and whatever gods there are that he won't let Tony down ever again. He resolves to be better, stronger, kinder; more understanding. He'll listen more carefully from now on. He'll be a better leader and a better man. For Tony. It's all for Tony.
Tony grins,
'Yeah, he does,' Clint laughs.
'Gah,' Tony groans. 'Tell me I wasn't like this as a kid?'
'Dada!' they're interrupted as Pete jumps down from his seat at the bar and runs to Tony.
'Why do I have the ominous feeling that my entire life is going to be defined by a series of badly thought out decisions prompted by Starks?' mentioning Howard even vaguely is something of a risk.
Jacey has been noticeably absent. Tony hadn't asked why, though he can guess. She'd said earlier on that she wouldn't be allowed to interfere, and that she'd send Dr. Strange as quickly as possible.
years of being on the same team and trusting each other with our lives, I’m still nothing but a man pretending to be hero?” Tony’s voice is low and soft.
“I, uh, I didn’t think you’d want to see me.” Steve’s got a sanguine, charming little grin on his face.
"Why do they not regulate firearms?" Richards asks with his brows furrowed.
I'm shadow upon these walls,
Steve goes stock still instantly. His eyes go big and round with shock, and he leans down to scent Tony’s neck glands. By the way the blond recoils, Tony knows the blockers are doing fuck all to mask his scent. “S-
“That’s ‘cause he ain’t gettin’ any,” Sam says dryly.
Vision does not like being away from Tony Stark for very long, but circumstances have required the sentient being’s attention, which pulled him away from Mr. Stark’s side. That being said, Vision is very much aware of the pain his… creator feels everytime Vision opens his mouth. Vision knows Tony hears JARVIS, and knows that Tony has not properly grieved since the incident occurred. Vision wishes he could still be there for him as JARVIS, but he is different now. Alive.
Well, any alpha in his current state probably would, but Steve especially since he’s the one who knocked Tony up.
But Tony's eyes are drifting shut and his grip on Jacey's hand is weakening.
“I know you’re too old to have seen

Clearly, his body had thought that it had much bigger things to worry about than reproduction. So, he'd been heat-less for about eight years. His twenty-first birthday had quickly flushed any ideas of family down the drain. He'd been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning—go figure—and the doctors had done some blood work, for some reason. When he'd woken from his two-day coma and having his stomach pumped, well, the doctors had been

She’s considering giving the man a sedative, so he’d just go to sleep already, but she doesn’t want to deprive him of someone finally,
Jacey’s eyes stay closed, but she frowns like this isn’t new information.
"Again," Barton grumbles, "the
New York feels so very, very empty without Tony bigger-than-life personality to fill it. Vision is lonely, but he knows it was a logical choice for him to stay here and keep an eye out for any rowdiness.
He knows Strange and Reed are watching and listening. For once, he doesn’t care about appearances or reputations, so he cries. In a manly way, of course.
It’s Jacey’s turn to stop in surprise. She hadn’t expected this at all. “Fine,” she murmurs vaguely. “Tony is doing well.”
"You're saying the Earth will..." Tony can feel a panic attack coming on. This is why he'd been obsessed with Ultron, with protecting his world because of the things she was now telling him. He can't accept this. He won't accept this. There has to be another way.
Steve wrings his hands and looks embarrassed. “I. I liked… I liked what we had. I just wanted you to know that. I thought– well, I don’t think I ever said it, and you were never… you were never just a rut partner to me, Tony. You were so much
“Beats me. There I was, recovering from pneumonia and countless injuries, when suddenly I’m being arrested. Then, imagine my surprise when the SUV I’m handcuffed in blows up. I wake up in that dungeon, and Doc McStuffins is interrogating me about Extremis. Really, it’s anyone’s guess.” Tony rolls his eyes.
“What?” He looks startled, as if he hadn’t expected her to be happy about it at all.
“Stark,” she says, her voice low and cold.
“What was he doing?” Tony hates this anticipation thing she does because she’s so damn good at it.
Tony closes his eyes. Vision is right, of course, but Tony can't stand sitting idly by doing

Steve looks up briefly, but Tony’s expression is grave and still just as tightly guarded. So Steve shakes off his astoundment, doesn’t hesitate, and gets down to business.
"The lonely sound of my voice calling is driving me insane
his soul whispers,
Strange nods again to the case. "Not quite. We have three in the case, but we know where the other three can be found."
“... I have nothing to say, Director. I am ashamed of my actions and my behavior.”
taze you. Mark my words,” he warns fiercely.
The second:
“That’s…” Tony heaves a sigh of relief that takes all of the tension out of his shoulders and makes him sag a little. “Thanks, Jacey. That really… I wanted to do those, but then the doctor said…”
“That,” T’Challa says miserably, “happened approximately four hours ago. The US government has not received any ransom demands. But, considering they were arresting him, I doubt they would pay it.”
Also… the pregnancy would be considerably more difficult without the alpha there. Sure, omegas didn’t
"Like, man, everything in that
Steve rears as if she’s just slapped him. “I–” he splutters, “how could I
Tony sighs again, and purses his lips. “And, the problem is that I didn’t want to make him choose.” No, that’s not right. He’s a futurist, after all. He didn’t want Steve to choose because he knew what Steve would choose. Or, rather,
different.
“I am not at liberty to discuss Stark’s personal choices with you. I have called because Tony is–”
“Like you’re about to go into rut,” Wanda murmurs from where she’s leaning against a tree, “but not quite. It’s… different. I don’t know how to explain in English.”
“I’ve tried to talk to them, Stark, they wouldn’t listen to me. Why would they listen to you?”
"Mm," Tony blinks blearily. "Ok," he snuffles.
Every memory of walking out the front door
And all those days we spent out by the lake
Finally, Jane speaks up, looking vaguely ill. "School... massacres... are commonplace? In your world?"
“Yeah. I know all about that,” he grumbles and thinks of the vision she’d given him before Ultron became the result.
Cho hugs him. He’s almost asleep when he starts talking again. He babbles about Ivan Vanko, dying, the palladium, his father’s voice, the new element, the Mandarin, AIM, Hammer, the Iron Legion, Pepper getting dosed with Extremis (he’d fixed it, of course, and cured it, but that’s besides the point), and the surgery to remove the shrapnel and the reactor (Helen knows that part; she was there).  He talks about the Avengers, how Steve and him had met (disastrously), how he’d flown a nuke into a hole to save everyone, about the nightmares and PTSD that came from that.
Remember how I said this chapter was going to be a lot more stream of consciousness/scenery rather than dialogue? Yeah... not so much. Oh well! Hope you like it anyways! :D
He crawls to the kitchen and finds a communicator first. He hits call without looking to see what name is highlighted.
“Steven Grant Rogers!” She hollers out in a stern voice.

Literally, the whole time i was like oh wait wanna add this oh NO WAIT one moreeeee thingggg -- and look? you get 15 minutes worth of nothing but fluffy feelings.
Great. Or so he'd thought. Obviously, the blithering idiots had been
Jacey flinches back. Maybe... maybe she had pushed him a little too hard.
For the rest of the trip, Tony zoned out. He didn’t even realize they were at the airport until they were calling for them to board the plane. So he blinked, sat in his seat, and slept the whole way to Wakanda.
Steve looks surprised again. “Wanda Maximoff?”
“Steve doesn’t know,” Tony starts to say.
By the time they make it to the ground floor, Ross is pushing Stark into a car and slamming the door shut behind him. "What do we do?" Cho whispers, "He's still in recovery... and he's pregnant..."
Tony signs out AMA and they all pile into the Jeep. “So,” Tony says conversationally, “where we headed?”
His father's house. The house he grew up in is standing tall right before him and Tony's not sure he can process it. He's not sure that he's processing anything at all, at the moment.
The next ten minutes blur by with more agony and Tony belatedly realizes that the reason why he's bleeding is probably because the placenta has detached, or worse. He did do some reading after, since he has a heart condition and because of his more... advanced age. Ugh. He hopes he's not hemorrhaging. He hopes the babies are okay.

The elevator ride is slow--impossibly so, and Steve feels like he’s vibrating out of his skin.
“Yeah,” she nods, “if I’m recalling correctly, I think the end-result was that due to a stressful environment or being around someone who was not pack or family during the crucial developmental stages of puberty, that for some reason a hormone releases and essentially makes you dynamic-null. So: no heats, no scents, stunted growth and development, prone to outbursts - usually of the thrill-seeking or rebellious variety - , difficulty bonding with others, and little to no satisfaction from sexual activities.”

? Tony Stank here?”
Tony purses his lips and tries to keep his expression neutral. "What do you mean?" He asks plainly.
, Steve recalls belatedly with shame. But he’d been too angry to listen; to hear. And it had changed everything.
i still squee and freak out from comments. tell me all your feels!
“Tony,” her voice goes very quiet and sober, “what was that number when you were with Steve?”
“Who’s Ella?” He grumbles.
“What about what you’ve done?” Tony asks quietly, tiredly. He knows the supersoldier is far from infallible. Knows that Steve’s super-soldier-strong stubborness can be tougher than even the vibranium shield he carries. Knows that Steve doesn’t always listen to reason before he punches,
"The Accords were all about checks and balances," Tony explains, "the populace wanted us to have accountability, and from the sounds of it-- it's much the same here, right? And it's a fair request. The Avengers had a lot of very large battles. Many of them took place in big cities, which means a high potential for civilian casualties and an even higher chance that our mistakes would become very, very public. And there were, and they did. Angry constituents means angry politicians. Those angry politicians wrote a bill, and because of certain contacts I have, I was clued in. I got involved in the process. I made sure the Accords would be able to be easily amended, and even though we would have to ask permission to cross borders--which we should have done in the first place--signed Avengers would have blanket-permission to access most countries as long as we basically sent a heads-up first. The Accords made it so that a panel of elected ambassadors would choose our missions and where to send us--"
“No,” she smirks, “but I know who
“I was–”
"I-- Vision--" Tony is deeply touched, and his hormones choke up his words and send tears to the corners of his eyes. "Of course."
“I found Bucky, but they’re trying to take him out.”
“To a hospital,” Strange raises an eyebrow as if that was obvious.
before he even bothered paying attention to it. Well, he’d definitely learned that lesson the hard way, hadn’t he?
Which makes Tony start crying. “From you, Steve, it means everything.”
He hates this. He hates what the team–his family–has become, he hates knowing that he had no choice to do what he did, he hates knowing that his team has (
"Elsa style?" Rhodes sighs, but keeps his tone light.
He’s been puking his guts up for three days straight when FRIDAY alerts him to a visitor.
“... Your… designation.”
Tony shrugs. “I’ve heard of it, in passing, but I didn’t know the… culture behind it.”

Vision thinks, "On second thought, make that two conditions."
The alien's mouth thins and he must decide that Tony isn't worth all the hassle because he just steps over him and heads to the elevators. Well, Tony is definitely not hiding any stones so Squiddy can wander around all he likes. But now that Tony's been left alone he needs to find a goddamn phone or communicator. Something.

"Stand on the box, stomp your feet, start clapping
"Why would I..." He still doesn't understand. He feels the lingering 'but' like a splinter; an ominous premonition clawing its way out to be revealed, but doesn't yet dare.
“Okay, what the hell did that gortle do to you, Cap?” Clint asks with wide eyes, but an extremely amused tone.
! Not fat! Who’s told you you’re fat? I’ll rip them a new one, I swear to God… fucking people… insulting a pregnant person…” Steve grumbles and his Brooklyn accent trickles out.
'Do not let me fuck up raising Captain America's kid.'
'Sure, ma'am,' Steve agrees and then his eyes widen, 'I mean Pepper.'
There are reasons why kissing him is a bad idea.
Steve gazes at Tony through the slowly rotating hologram for a few moments,
'Ok,' Pete smiles and disappears as the screen pans to the floor.
'Dunno,' Pete's playing with the light from Tony's chest with his fingers.
What did he expect?
'I was only joking, Tony,' he looks away to check on Pete.
'Gimme,' Tony pries one of the soldier’s hands from his hip and moans as he adds it to his own around their cocks. 'There...' he gulps a breath, 'that's... that's good.'
'I had Lucky Charms,' Pete tells him.
'Please tell me that I have told you that?'
'You think I should leave a note with his next present?'
'Cap,' Tony briefly opens one eye. 'Why are you in my bed?'
‘You’re warm,’ Tony informs him.
'Oh. Ok. I guess I'll speak to you tomorrow?'
'Take the rest of the day off,' Tony adds; effectively dismissing Clarke from his own store.
'Because...' Steve visibly squares his shoulders even as he lowers his voice, 'because we're about to become a family and I can't just ignore that. I'm not happy with you right now, but I get that you're sorry and that you're trying to make it up to me the only way you know how.'
He should go and check on Tony.
He feels himself tense,
Steve glances at her but she doesn't give anything else away.
'Of Stark Industries,' Pete repeats seriously.
'Right,' Tony watches his son reposition everything.
'Rhodey?' Tony jolts upright and just beams, 'Rhodey's here?'
On the screen he sees Tony relax,
‘Sounds believable,’ Tony shrugs. ‘I certainly looked a little worse for wear when I re-emerged.’
‘You live with me,’ Tony’s voice is deadened though the suit so Steve can’t tell his reaction to this.
'Lovely woman. She was a surrogate for me but we don't have any contact other than that,' he smiles.
OK! Sorry that took so long but hopefully it doesn't disappoint.
Oh! That says Dada's name. He can find Dada there, or maybe Jarvis if Dada's busy!
'Great!' Tony grins and claps his hands together. 'I'm going to put on clothes that aren't sleep pants, when I get back I'll make sandwiches, ok kiddo?'
And time travel sounds dangerously close to magic.
It's not as nice as Dada's.
'You'll feel better when you see Pete.'
‘Colonel Rhodes is in his suite reading. Shall I place a call?'
'Yeah?' Steve sits back down beside him. 'Me too.'
He cuts himself off as Pete comes round the sofa, his eyelids at half mast, and clambers his way into his father's lap,
This. Tony's good at this.
Tony laughs and puts down his finished drink,
Tony rubs himself against Steve shamelessly as he works to catch up with his lover and then hits that same spot again.
Up a staircase he's never seen before and along a hallway he can hear music ahead.
'If there's a better babysitting option than Captain America then it's got to be additional Avengers,' Tony agrees and taps his eyepiece before lifting back into the air.
'Do you need anything?' Steve asks quietly.
'Right...' Bruce looks stunned.
'Yeah. You can't see it now, it's healed, but she broke his arm early last year and that matches pretty perfectly with when Maria broke mine.'
'You'll be visiting her, I assume?' Clint plays with the purple car that shoots harpoons.
Tony pulls away from him fully this time and scrubs a hand across his face.
'It's not like we have time for anyone else either,' he shrugs. 'And Pep was the one who pointed it out; I was happy.'
‘Tony, I…’ Steve stops and turns as he steps out the door.
'Ok,' Pepper sighs, and pours herself some wine and tops off his scotch, 'I'll give you time to think about it.'
'Hey, kiddo,' Tony press a kiss to his hair. 'Have you come to watch this film with me and Cap?'
Watching Tony work is normally fascinating and strangely relaxing; there's a surety, a happy confidence to him beyond what he shows to the outside world.
‘Most brilliant sound bite ever. Jarvis, save that somewhere.’
His boyfriend can't really be...?
Steve moves to sit with Pete at the table and watches him painting what looks like it must be him and Tony working on his car.
'Good,' Steve feels himself smile. 'What's Dummy doing, then?'
'Jarvis, order me some Thai, will you?'
Steve has come to realise that the relationship he has with Tony is so very close to being unhealthy.
'His name?' his mind blanks.
'I have many,' Tony shrugs and steps from the shower. 'I'd tell you them all but I really need to make the effort to work out what it is that I've apparently just spent three days building.'
Tony pulls Steve's left hand off of his hip and to his balls,
'I know,' she bats her eyes and walks away.
'I'm glad Nat isn't here to see this.'
'Yes,' Pete confirms and beams at him.
Steve just kisses him enthusiastically.
‘Is Pepper ok?’
Pepper, Steve quickly finds, is the most organised, and least flappable, person in existence. With her in the tower he and Bruce are both somehow eating dinner with her at the table and all their laundry is done.
'That sounds... dirty,' Tony looks bemused.
'Oh,' Pete considers this.
'Tony? What time is it?'
Tony makes an odd noise in his throat as he shifts over and presses his face into Steve's arm. Steve thumps his head into his pillow as Tony's hand curls around his bicep to keep him in place.
'Hey, great!' Tony grins. 'The gang's back together!'
'Sir, it is you who is in Captain Rogers' bed,' Jarvis corrects.
What else could he ever be expected to do?
'And if it's a boy,' Tony agrees, 'then I'll have to check with Rhodey what other names I can use.'
Tony doesn't seem convinced.
'You can't just experiment on yourself like this!' Steve argues then gives into the temptation to pull Tony into his arms.
He stares back for a moment,
'I don't know; I just told you I wasn't watching it.'
'Chips,' Tony lands to accept the mug of coffee Steve's holding for him. 'They're chips, Pete; let's not let Jarvis and Alfred turn you English.'
'Pepper...'
'Great,' Tony smiles. 'You approve too, buddy?'
'Three...?' Tony scowls and shakes his head. 'Why do you put up with me?'
The music cuts and Tony's head lifts in surprise,
Tony shrugs,
And he needs to work out how to make Tony trust him in turn.
'Indeed,' Jarvis agrees. 'But I am not one of the first people they would think to call if they had been injured.'
‘To talk to you?’ Steve really didn’t intend for that to be a question.
'And Captain America?' Steve asks, curious.
'Agent Romanov shall be coming up shortly,' Jarvis replies promptly. 'Agent Barton is unlikely to wake in the next hour, but seems strangely fond of coffee that is... past its best. Doctor Banner is asleep, but his alarm is set for 8am, which is in fifteen minutes time. Prince Thor is, as far as I am able to tell, still off world.'
‘Alright, Tony?’
This is exactly what he should have expected from Tony Stark.
'Oh, sorry, Pete,' he hisses at his best friend, 'no you can't play with your brother today. He's off with his father; you're just stuck with me I'm afraid.'
'Cap!' Pete scrambles to the edge of the bed and holds up his arms expectantly.
'Maybe I need to be wooed first,' he lies with a smile.
'I want Dada.'
‘What do I do?'
'Yes,' Pepper sits down on Tony's other side. 'I had it commissioned.'
Steve laughs,
'I told you before I have a documented weakness for being talked into bad decisions by Starks,' Steve looks apologetic.
Steve is quite sure his entire team are still working to comprehend the sight in front of them.
'Jarvis is trying him right now,' Tony smiles up at her, 'no answer. Not from the other members of his team either.'
*                                  *                                  *
'Nuh, I had three,' Pete holds up three fingers to demonstrate.
Steve doesn't look convinced.
'Right,' Tony finishes his coffee and looks around for another.
'And Captain Rogers?' she cuts in with more enthusiasm than necessary.
'I have to mention one of the cars I recognised outside,' she acts like she's asking him to reveal a secret, 'is Bruce Wayne here?!'
*          *          *
'I do not know, sir. Captain Rogers wants a family and he is attracted to you. You have a son together. It is not difficult to see how this might end perfectly.'
'Sure, Cap,' Tony's gaze is alert again.
There's a small pause before Steve gets into the lift with them and then Jarvis sends them down to the garage.
'Clint didn't tell you that I'm not?'
But it doesn't mean anything, right?
'Dada?' he's at his side with his arms in the air wanting to be picked up.
Tony surprises him by loosely wrapping his own arms around Steve’s waist and tucking his head under the super soldier’s jaw.
'Coffee is important for brain function in grown ups,' Clint tells him. 'Especially in the mornings.'
Tony just laughs as he pours another coffee.
*          *          *
'You baby proof your weapons?' Rhodey laughs.
Now he really needs that run.
'Steven? Really?'
'Hello, Master Peter,' Jarvis replies gently.
'Breakfast...' he ponders his cupboards. 'Jarvis?'
'Cap!' Pete grins and bounces on Tony's stomach in his excitement.
Which is upsetting all in itself.
'So, this isn't quite about trust,' Steve sighs. 'This is about Tony's sense of self-worth...'
'No! I just... Does he even really need me? That's what Tony meant, isn't it? Jim doesn't really need me as a father if he has Tony.'
'Promise?' Pete asks even as his head drops onto Steve's shoulder.
'Sure, sweet pea,' Tony takes a sip of his drink. 'Now, what did you play with as a kid?' he gestures to the images on the table.
'I need you to come home and monopolise Tony's time,' Pepper sighs.
‘Is it already?’ Tony asks without looking up.
'Wow!' Steve's look of disguised horror is precious.
'Break him?' Tony scowls. 'No. He'll just... He'll be angry.'
Pepper is horrified that Tony was dying,
'Are you ok from here?' Steve sounds conflicted from where he's trailed Tony to the doorway of his bedroom.
'He'll be back,' Tony just hopes he's not lying.
*          *          *
'I meant for you personally,' Tony shrugs, 'here and now. You're ok with being in the future?'
'Sir, Ms Potts is suggesting you prepare yourself for your meeting,' Jarvis announces as Steve re-enters his living room with their drinks.
'Yes, Captain!' she agrees cheekily and the line goes dead.
Reaching to wash his hands after is hard and he doesn't like the hand dryer; it's very loud.
'What the hell is that thing...?'
Of course, when he thinks about it, he realises that Tony trusts him not to hurt Pete but not not to hurt Tony himself.
'Hey,' Tony offers a smile as Steve abandons whatever he was reading and crosses the room in three quick strides to wrap him in a hug.
'Alright then,' Clint bounds off towards the kitchen.
He doesn't know what he'd do without this man now.
'Still no new person in your life? That will make a lot of our readers happy,' the flirting is back.
The car shoots forwards and crashes into the wall before rebounding, righting itself, and zooming off to run straight into Steve's side table. The table gracefully topples to the floor as the car speeds on.
'I'll help out as often as he'll let me,' Steve scowls. 'What do you mean he doubts...?'
‘Sorry,’ Steve apologises and, rather stupidly, immediately leans back throwing them to Tony’s right.
Sorry I've been away. A couple of chapters to apologise!
'Sir,' Jarvis interrupts, 'I suggest you turn the bowl over or it will not be able to drain.'
There will be a toilet behind that picture of a man!
Clarke makes a strangled noise in his throat.
'Ms Potts is in her office downstairs,' Jarvis tells him, 'in a conference call with Tokyo. Captain Rogers is still out for his run and is the other side of the city.'
'I'm more like the occasionally helpful teenager,' Clint gestures to the left and leads the way.
'I'm not going to fuck this up, right?'
'I know my way around a coffee machine,' Steve replies and hands over a steaming mug.
Tony smiles as he leans against the door frame and gazes at his sleeping boyfriend,
when Tony dislocates his shoulder during a fight, but it is because of him that it happens.
'I'll speak to you later, Pep.'
'Exactly,' Tony agrees. 'Pete, wipe that down so Jarvis can get an accurate scan. I'm going to get Rhodey a drink.'
'And you think the parents of those kids are calm and collected about it?' he challenges.
He shakes his head,
'Because I can't announce something without drama?'
'Of course, sir.'
Steve gazes up as the genius gives him one last lick before shifting onto his knees and taking himself in hand. Their eyes lock through Steve's afterglow as Tony jerks himself off over Steve's chest before slumping forwards and curling against the soldier's side.
'That was yesterday,' he groans.
*          *          *
'Remember that time I went to Portland?' Tony grins as he strips off his clothes.
The boy just stares at him.
'Yeah, you look really happy,' Steve manages not to actually scoff audibly but it's implied.
'I'll let you have the plush one then.'
Steve wonders how long he’ll have to know Tony before he’ll be able to hand him things.
Steve has very gingerly carried the painting, he can't quite think of it is
‘I’m sorry,’ Steve bites his lip. ‘I thought…’
'Really?' Tony grumbles. 'Why do people think that you care for someone more if you're related?'
Pete blinks at him and carefully places an Iron Man toy on the floor before pulling a black card from his pocket.
'Hey, Tony? Can I borrow some cash to pay my landlord?'
He wants something to do. The armour and a toolbox are brought up a mere minute after Steve asks for them and so Tony is pacified in the short term.
'He shall be back later, little one,' Thor tells him.
*          *          *
Thor and Clint are at the TV. Clint is shouting while Thor laughs.
‘Of course he is.’
'Be safe,' he smiles.
'Of course, sir.'
She nods and gets back onto the lift.
'That's a lot of muffins,' he turns to find Steve looking baffled. 'We only just had lunch; what did you want muffins for?'
'Peter,' Jarvis makes the man jump backwards, 'I am redirecting your call to sir.'
Tony smiles at her,
'My friend!' Thor strides over as soon as his feet are on the floor and grasps Tony into a bear hug. 'It is most wondrous to see you well!'
'Cap,' he smiles, but it looks hesitant, 'how can I help you?'
'I need to be sure my kids are cared for,' he tells her with a self conscious shrug. 'The last time I thought about what would happen if I died I gave Rhodey a suit and you SI; this wasn't that excessive.'
'Jarvis isn't an egg,' he takes the man's phone.
'Jarvis, is it day time?'
'They already knew we didn't have him,' he feels himself curl slightly as if bracing for a blow. 'Someone must have contacted Tony. You were right; Pete was kidnapped.'
'You are infuriating,' Pepper taps away on her tablet. 'You're still doing the photo shoot; they'll meet you at the Mansion tomorrow.'
'I think you whine. You make wonderful noises.
He watches Steve shoot a look at Pete before continuing quietly,
'You should have just told him you were Captain America,' Tony tells him without looking up from what he's doing.
'Later,' Tony dismisses. 'I'm awake now.'
But then there was the startled look on Tony's face when he called them a family; a look that became a mild freak out. That was a little heartbreaking.
'Dada is my favourite,' Pete corrects him.
'You think this is the right time to tell him, Jay?'
Blue eyes meet his and he can see something's wrong.
I am English and in the UK; I have no idea if the place I have picked off of Google Maps for this chapter is actually appropriate. Feel free to correct me :-)
'One thing at a time,' Tony scoffs.
'Tony?' Steve calls up when Tony apparently doesn't notice.
'He'll be happy you're here, Cap; he was telling me you should stay in our room if we couldn't find one for you.'
'Try setting me up with someone other than Steve Rogers,' he scoffs. 'Has Pete got to him yet?'
'Well, what then?' Steve crosses his arms across his chest.
‘Did you say it was me?’
'I'm going to need Cap to come,' Tony adds. 'Get him a suit too.'
'Are you angry, Dada?'
'That wasn't up to him,' he sighs.
'Sir, you can do this; Captain Rogers is statistically unlikely to hit you.'
‘Tony!’ Steve reaches for him.
A man helps him push open the door as he goes back to Cap and Clint.
'Old habits,' she smiles at him. 'I know you, Tony.'
'That was the impression I received,' Jarvis sounds approving, the over protective bastard.
*          *          *
'Sure, Tony,' Steve just looks amused as the turns back to his frying pan.
'Dada,' he wraps his arms around Tony's neck.
'Oh,' she says again, 'of course.'
*          *          *
'Good night, Tony,' Bruce calls.
Clint likes conversation.
He takes Pete to bed and immediately goes to the bar in the main room of the penthouse and pours himself a large drink,
'I can, can't I, Dada?' Pete turns to him. 'Please?'
An hour later Steve is watching in mixture of amusement and faint horror as the two Starks pull apart one of the brand new, very expensive looking, six-wheeled remote controlled cars and gaze at the inner circuitry. That this is happening on his living room rug makes it all the more surreal.
‘Peachy,’ Tony smiles tightly and adjusts something within his chest cavity. The bleeding has stopped and the space for the reactor is shiny and new again but the skin around it looks raw and inflamed.
Which is easy enough as he does, in fact, own the place.
'That's really high,' Tony can't help but laugh. 'God, Jay, I'm a terrible person.'
'I'm going too fast,' Tony moves as if to shift away.
'Yeah!' Pete grins and jumps in ahead of them. 'I'm teaching Dummy and You to draw.'
‘Why now?’ Steve asks quietly when Tony hangs up.
'Just tell me if you don't like it,' Tony shrugs and rests on one elbow as he sticks a finger into his mouth. 'All right?'
‘Thanks, Jarvis,’ Tony crosses his arms. ‘Because Cap here didn’t quite think I was a complete failure as a human being; he needed that extra push.’
Steve just laughs,
Natasha hums and moves to a console against the wall. After a few minutes she's apparently hacked in.
'What do you need me to do?' Steve asks again.
Steve isn’t in the best form during the debriefing. He barely listens to run down of the fight, he doesn’t add anything to the discussion on tactics and he honestly doesn’t even notice when they start talking about who the group might have been allied with.
'Captain,' Jarvis pauses before continuing, 'sir rebounds from these episodes very quickly. I do not believe his desire to be alone is due to any fear of you.'
Ok, he's not mad?
'Of course,' Jarvis confirms.
'Dada,' Pete beams at him as he opens his eyes.
Steve finds himself standing close enough to Tony’s stool that the billionaire can rest against his chest.
'You can trust me,' Steve tries a smile and hopes he's not all over with blood; he didn't think to check. 'It's ok. Do you want to come out here? I'm sure I can find you some juice if you're thirsty?'
Jarvis English?' Steve puts half a sandwich into Tony's hand in the off chance it will trick him into eating it.
‘I broke Captain America.'
'Captain America is heroic and brave.'
Tony sits up with a smirk,
'Scrambled,' Tony replies as he abandons his drill beside the box of sensors. The Iron Man boots drop off as Tony walks over to him. 'I like the new look, Cap; half naked with bed head is a look you really pull off well.'
'Do you want anything, Cap?' Tony gestures to the bar.
'I'm a ninety year old virgin,' Steve doesn't know he's repeating his words from yesterday. 'And you're... everything I could want.'
'I see,' Thor nods.
Like that.
'I shall do my best when the time comes,' Jarvis assures him.
'Yes?' Steve agrees.
'So I've been told,' Steve shakes his head and moves to the fridge, he smiles at the drawing stuck to the door. 'Would you like another coffee?'
‘Yeah,' he's dropped back to the floor now Steve's gone.
'Tony?' he looks up to see the worryingly sad face of Steve Rogers gazing at him from across the room.
So here he is; on a ragged sofa in the corner of Tony’s lab. His sketchbook has a lot more robots in it now.
'Jarvis?'
Pete has curled back up against Tony's chest and tucked his head under his chin,
He brings up his emails and gets to work.
The look Pepper is giving him is, once again, assessing.
‘Try to keep up, Hap.’
Tony grins and stretches his arms over his head,
Steve seems to have been reduced to vague nodding as Tony presses a hand to his groin and rubs him through the cloth there.
Tony shoots him a withering look and then carries Pete to the lift,
'I didn't take him!' the guy blurts.
'It's not that bad,' he can hear that Steve is trying not to laugh. 'Just quarter to seven.'
He steps forwards as if he owns the place.
'Please!' he begs again.
‘Oh…’ Steve’s brain is finally working at full speed now.
'Dear fuck!' Clint jolts and stares at him.
'It's fiddly work, Cap.'
'Someone should have stopped her,' Steve can hear his own distress. 'How could nobody notice what she was doing?'
'Yes, sir.'
'There's that,' Tony agrees. 'How long until it's... born?'
Rhodey may be having some sort of seizure.
'Very useful,' Tony rolls his eyes.
'I'll get dressed when I wake up.'
'The coffee machine is running, sir.'
my secretary,' he tells her. 'Also, for the record, I'm not sure there
Tony nods,
'Yeah,' he agrees helplessly, 'of course you can.'
'Steve, we've looked,' Clint shakes his head but keeps looking. 'We need help.'
'Right,' Tony relaxes back into his chair, 'thanks, Jay.'
'She's going to yell at me, isn't she?' Tony sighs and saves his work.
Steve stays with Tony as the medics swarm them; he initially went to pull away but Tony caught his wrist in a death grip (he’s still wearing the suit) so Steve stays.
'Pete was relieved when you told him he wouldn't see his mom again,' Steve has a bad feeling.
Tony probably stayed seated for all of five minutes before he was up and working again.
‘Certainly, Captain,’ Jarvis sounds increasingly desperate but he’s still unfailing polite. ‘The second node on the left of the third circular port,’ Steve squints, ‘must be Dummy no!’
'I suspect not, sir,' he agrees.
'No, Captain.'
‘Can you talk me through it or do we need Tony to wake up?’ Steve asks quietly and brushes a hand though Tony’s damp hair.
'Yeah he is,' Tony agrees and reappears by ducking under one of Hulk's arms, 'but not with us, unless he thinks you're threatening me.'
There's a pause and Tony's inexplicably grateful that they don't immediately dismiss him.
'I could see you,' Steve objects.
He sees Natasha smirk, hears Clint huff a laugh but it takes Tony's bemused stare for him to realise what he's just said,
There is a line of colourful boxes against the wall by the lift that weren't there before.
'Cap,' Pete has crawled onto Steve's lap.
'Hey, Pep,' Tony fixes the cuff links on the shirt he threw on after dropping off Pete; it is best to wear a suit to Board Meetings.
‘Definitely,’ Tony waves a hand dismissively. ‘Don’t know what I’d do if I didn’t find you randomly camped out in my lab every afternoon.’
'It's not a valid concern,' Pepper shakes her head. 'This is where things get messy. I can't be certain, because he always acts a little strangely around me, but I think Steve is crushing on Tony.'
'Cap!' Pete beams and scrambles over Tony.
'He can get a bit much,' Natasha agrees blandly.
*                                  *                                  *
Christ.
'Good to know,' Steve replies, knowing that Tony isn't really listening to them.
Tony grins,
'Why are you here?' he asks quietly as he fiddles with his empty mug.
'Not yet, but he'll be here for the Gala,' he confirms.
'No structural modifications were required to the second guest room,' Jarvis tells him. 'There are apples in the cupboard to your right. The room has been painted and work is progressing elsewhere on the manufacture of the bedroom furniture. New carpet will be installed tomorrow and the furniture will be installed on the day after that.'
'Pep!' Tony sits up and rubs a hand over his face. 'Congratulations, you're an auntie!'
'I meant you and me!' Steve stands up suddenly and waves a hand. 'Jarvis, aren't we friends? Why didn't you tell me?'
'I promise everything is fine. I didn't cut the feed. Jarvis... I didn't ask him to, I really didn't,' Tony speaks very quickly. 'I called as soon as I realised what happened and then got here as quickly as I could when you didn't reply.'
‘Tony,’ Steve tries to reason.
When Tony does call he's enthusiastic and loud and clearly thinking a million different things at once. Their conversation is disappointingly short but at least Tony's on his way home.
'The device powered up at 6am.'
Steve bites his lip again and glances at the screen to see Tony's still typing.
'Did you come for Pete?' he asks quietly.
'What happened?' Steve leans forward.
'Then we'll see if there's anything you want and get a coffee and a muffin. Or maybe not a muffin. I'm a little sick of muffins.'
'It isn't that he doesn't like you, Cap,' Clint insists.
'Shall I call Doctor Richards?'
'Yes,' Pete stares at her.
'Why?'
'Fondling is good,' he adds and forces himself to keep his eyes fixed on Steve for the slightest sign of discomfort.
'You are my favourite and I'm your favourite so that's fair, right?'
Tony shoots him a quick look.
God, Steve thinks, we have to find...
They're a
He turns to look down to where Steve is still standing by the car,
'Anything you want, sugar.'
Steve puts Pete into the bed in his own room, makes sure he isn't too close to the edge and that he has his blanket. He presses a kiss to his forehead and crouches by the bed for a minute making sure Pete is definitely asleep.
'I have work to do,' Tony lifts up to the ceiling and ignores Steve.
By hooking one leg around the chair Tony finds enough leverage to grind down and is rewarded by Steve groaning and bucking up against him.
‘I’m just saying that if you aren’t sleeping…’
'Talk, please,' Tony doesn't beg. He sighs and closes his eyes as his head rests against Steve's chest, 'Say something Captain America-y; recite the constitution or something.'
'I'm not insulting you,' he can hear that small smile of hers in her tone.
'Do you not like morning?'
‘You know I’m out of the weapons business, right?’ Tony abandons watching the TV with the others and carries the gun to the bar.
'Alright,' Tony shoots another look at Pete, who isn't paying them any attention.
'Pepper...'
'It would be one hell of a way to pop that cherry, Rogers,' she gives him that look of hers.
It was pure survival instinct that had Steve grasp tightly onto Tony’s wrist before he’s out of reach and pure bad luck that the suit was been damaged earlier so that while that arm is working, it’s not strictly attached to the rest of the suit. Steve’s weight, as Tony adjusts to catch himself after the blast, is enough to pull Tony’s shoulder right out of its socket.
'Welcome back, Captain,' Jarvis greets him as he steps inside.
He gets a nod in response but Steve's hands don't move.
'The sandwich is crunchy!' Pete is apparently indifferent to linguistic differences.
‘We’ll be out of here soon,’ Steve promises softly.
'It's an original. Of course it's an original. How much did it cost him?!'
'It's day time.'
‘Jarvis said it; I don’t have enough power to make it to New York.’
Pete beams.
'Where is...' he changes his mind. 'Where's Pepper?'
‘I shall paraphrase Mr. Stark’s response,’ the AI announces finally. ‘He requests you leave him alone, as he previously requested. He points out he has food in his workroom and that it is not your responsibility to look after him even if he were to allow it. And he says that apologising to him when you don’t know what it is for nullifies the apology.’
'Three times. Tony just never opted to set off any sort of alarm when it happened.'
Clint and Thor both like to peer over Steve’s shoulder to see what he’s drawing.
‘You coming too, Steve?’ Happy asks as he leans against the car.
'The kitchen doesn't make me..' Steve looks like he's trying to fight his blush. 'I meant this isn't an appropriate place to.. do this.'
'Hey,' Tony hums when Steve brushes his fingers through dark hair.
He's pretty sure Steve doesn't want to see him right now,
'Sounds good,' he offers his hand to Pete.
'Hey,' Tony climbs off the floor to side beside him, 'you can't take all the blame for that.'
'Cap certainly is, but as much as Pepper loves the kid she's mostly too busy to look after him if I can't.'
Tony is the luckiest man alive.
'I had toast,' he mutters but smiles before cutting the call.
'Great,' Tony grins. 'Remember to feed him lunch and then put him down for a nap. I'll be back in a few hours but you can always get Jarvis to interrupt me, ok?'
'Good luck, Tony,' Steve smiles up at him.
‘You’re a good dancer,’ Steve smiles at him.
'Fuck,' Tony drops his hand and leans forwards against his knees. 'Fuck, I thought this had stopped... Fuck.'
‘Who knew?’ he responds and trades the paperwork back for his glass.
‘He does,’ Steve agrees and shoots him a smile, ‘but I’m alright. I just wish I woke up sooner.’
'I shouldn't,' he mutters but tucks his head under Steve's chin.
'Since as soon as I got back to the workshop after New York,' Tony shrugs and glances to his friend. 'I'm a consultant, but the actual Avengers should be at a high enough level of clearance to know. Coulson thinks you know.'
'Jealous,' Pepper smiles, 'you'd like a family?'
*          *          *
The explosion sends Steve in a graceful arc over the wall and plummeting towards the concrete far below. Tony, of course, immediately zips after him. Just as he’s caught hold of the shoulders of the suit something shoots between them and blasts Tony away.
‘He implied he wanted to be with me and I shot him down.'
Steve gives him a lazy kiss and then tips his head back into the shower spray, Tony manages to gather the energy to untangle himself from the kneeling soldier and stands up.
*          *          *
‘On average you are now down to one a week, sir,’ Jarvis adjusts the lighting as Tony moves across the room. ‘Though this week you have had three. I suspect an outside source has caused you to become unsettled.’
Alfred wordlessly gives Pete some of the meat,
Tony rolls his head against the back of the couch to look over at Steve,
Steve worries at his bottom lip as he watches his friend.
'Or blow up spectacularly,' Tony toasts the air and finishes his drink again.
'Pete trusted me from that first day,' he turns to Steve, 'because he thought he already knew me.'
Huh, that is a lot of grease.
And finally Tony drops to one knee, opens his arms and the little boy, with only a moment’s hesitation, runs straight to him and flings his arms around his neck.
Steve can see the reluctance Tony's feeling as he fixes his tie,
'Did I do something bad?' Pete gazes up at him.
It’s almost a relief when they next get a call.
'There's every other present a little boy could want,' Steve replies with a shake of his head.
'Good morning, Captain,' she replies with a smile. There's no hint of what he's told her in her tone; she's his favourite. 'I'll call you later, Tony.'
'Yeah,' Steve nods as he watches Tony pour himself a scotch. 'Once I became...' he gestures to himself awkwardly, 'this... I figured kids were something I could hope for in my future. I still hope I can, one day. It's more daunting now though. Not that I was great at meeting people before,' he shrugs.
'What's the problem?' Bruce asks as soon as they sit down.
'Hey, Pete,' he opens his eyes and smiles.
Tony won't let himself panic.
‘Tony…’
‘I’ll be fine,’ Tony tells him, basically meaning
'I am glad,' Thor goes to one knee and offers Pete a bundle wrapped in a shimmering cloth.
Steve swallows and nods quickly.
'I was about to,' Tony admits. 'He acted a little hurt when I said you should be the favourite uncle and that he was Cap. I was going to tell him why I wasn't going to teach my kids to call him 'uncle' but then I had the...' he waves his hand. 'So I didn't.'
‘Fuck that’s tragic,’ Tony twists in his seat to look at Steve up the right way. ‘I mean, seriously tragic. Do they not pay you? Do you need an allowance? Like, pocket money or something?’
'You aren't going to tell him,' she doesn't look impressed.
‘No,’ Tony starts opening cabinets. ‘The reactor is low. We tried a few things on the poison before I came to you. I need to get back and swap it over.’
He wakes at half seven in the morning, well passed the time he would normally be up, and feels incredibly comfortable.
'Where's Dada?'
‘No,’ Tony snaps now. ‘You don’t get to freak out about that. You get along with him perfectly well; I’ve heard you talking to him.’
'Hey, kid,' he manages to straighten up but he can feel himself trembling.
'You should be,' he agrees and wonders how hard he'd have to slam his own head into the coffee table to make himself stop talking.
Bruce stares then shakes his head,
'I need a shower.'
Using Jarvis to keep track of his ever increasing list was such a good idea.
'And yet you shun me,' Tony gives an exaggerated sigh. 'What am I to think, Cap?'
'Why did I come here?' he groans.
That could have gone better.
‘Anyway!’ Tony claps his hands together. ‘I have a lot to do tomorrow so I’m going to go and pass out somewhere.’
'Hey, Steve,' she sounds winded.
*          *          *
'Before or after I inform her of your dire illness, sir?'
Thor was around, for once, but has since disappeared. Clint, Natasha and Bruce all came too after Tony promised they didn't have to dance or bring partners if they didn't want to. Steve seems to have slipped under the radar of the press and was pretty obviously Tony's plus one.
He should lie, right? Steve probably wouldn't even want him to upset Pete by telling him they fell out...
'You have your live in babysitters then?'
'What did you think I meant?' he asks with a grin.
'I want you,' Steve blurts and then whines as Tony grinds down against him.
'Of course,' Steve can't fight the grin. 'Just tell me when.'
'As his babysitter?'
'I'm not awake,' he tells his son.
Tony visibly relaxes at the voice of his best friend,
Move to get the coffee or pull the sheet back over his head?
*          *          *
'I'm fine.'
'Then I offer my most sincere apologies.'
'Hey, sorry about that, Cap,' Tony switches back to English. 'Just arrived at my place and had to check my tailor was on his way.'
Tony shoots him a look over his shoulder,
Steve sighs,
'Good luck with that,' Tony puts the jug down.
'Which languages?' Steve asks, his Cap head is on now as he mentally adds this information to the list of the team's abilities.
'You were right then; they did get their hands on some DNA.' He gets it, and that's why he's Tony's favourite.
Rhodey jumps in, "What's this about?"
The engineer doesn’t answer. He sighs heavily and rubs his stomach. “I wish I could do it all over.”
people; of considering people his
father.
Tony’s eyes narrow and he is so done with this shit, “You lied to me first, Rogers! You knew what happened before all this happened, and you didn’t say a goddamn word! All this could’ve been avoided,” Tony’s voice raises, “if you’d stopped to consider how someone else felt! How
It’s fitting that he should wake up in a hospial after all is said and done. It seems that despite not having an electromagnet in his chest, the crippling aversion to hospitals is still ready and roaring.
“Damn. This is blackmail isn’t it?” Tony wags a finger accusingly.
“Y-you… what?” Tears fill her eyes.
It’s fitting life would choose to deal him a hand like this. If this were poker, he’d be bluffing. He can’t do that anymore. Maybe this will be the one that he doesn’t come back from. The one where he and Steve are finally getting somewhere even if they’re biting each other’s heads off to do it. The one where his former teammates have realized their mistakes and come to apologize one by one. The one where he takes Peter on as a protege because the kid needs guidance, but will probably be alright. The kid’s got such a big, bleeding heart. He’ll– he’ll be fine without Tony. They all will be. He’s made sure of it.
He’s still feverish with pneumonia and bronchitis when the shipment comes. He’s got bags under his eyes and the bruises still aren’t healing properly. Well, Doctor Cole thinks it’s because his immune system is preoccupied with two illnesses and doesn’t have time to worry about a couple of scrapes. That’s great. Until those start to get infected too. He thinks he hears someone mention the possibility of blood poisoning occuring, but he’s high on morphine and antibiotics, so he can’t be sure. He doesn’t tell Rhodey.
“I… I hafe always dreamt about one day meeting someone who could be my soul-bonded. I am not naive enough to wish for an ula kui, and I definitely did not expect an u’hoa. Any… any of the three is a treasure; a blessing. But, for someone to reject… I do not undestand.”
“What? It is! That dumbass Killian could’ve saved me some headaches if he hadn’t decided to fuck around with people’s genes on a molecular level. Honestly, who the hell thinks it’s a good idea to rewrite someone’s DNA?”
“You already know my name, but I’m Steve.” The blond shrugs sheepishly.
thought it was an excellent idea to give a former Hydra member a second chance because she was a ‘victim’. You claimed she was ‘just a kid’ and were convinced that keeping her confined to the Compound was ‘internment’ after I said it was for her protection,” Tony grinds his teeth and tries to reign in his residual anger. It’s not this Steve that he’s angry with, after all.
She walks away and hopes to Hell she didn’t just make a massive mistake. Tony’s not the only one who’s a futurist, after all. She can see, clear as day, that Steve is pining harder than a school girl. She can also see, however, that Tony is giving up on Steve if he hasn’t already.
She shrugs, like it isn’t a big deal. “By then, I’d say we’d only dated for a few months when he told me he loved me. I’m… slow… to love,” she admits quietly, “but when I do, I love with every fiber of my being; fiercely and all-encompassing. You should know, Tones, that once someone has my loyalty, the only way that loyalty ends is if the other’s does first. Do you understand?”
“In other words, Captain, any of the metahumans who’d signed would’ve probably still been able to continue on as their ‘secret’ identities with no one the wiser. Their lives would’ve likely remained wholy unchanged.” For the most part, he thinks. But there’s always exceptions.
Thank you all for oh so patiently waiting on me! Life is hectic and yada yada yada~ but here it iiiiiss chapter 5!
Tears shine in Tony's eyes and Clint's not used to seeing so much vulnerability in him, so he puts a hand on his neck and looks away awkwardly.
bill. A less... racially-charged one. Not to mention how apparently 90% of this Earth's mutants suddenly, and inexplicably, lost their powers. Yeah, that's not suspicious at all. Is this Earth's government overrun by HYDRA agents? Like SHIELD in his own world was? Is that why everything's gotten so out of hand?
Tony narrows his eyes. This is starting to sound like the bad news part.
Pornstache glares with murderous intent. “You are not as convincing as you think you are.”
P.S. ya'll are so nice to me that I completely forgot I hadn't updated this SINCE JANUARY. NOBODY BUGGED ME. AT ALL. Ya'll are just... awesome. I love you. I've been working on this ch for a coupla months because I was trying to figure out how to work Infinity War into this so that this fic still kinda sorta follows canon like it's been doing.
‘There’s a chance I’ve just been poisoned,’ Tony informs him calmly.
The blonde nods again and this time his hands skitter back up Tony's spin. He watches the soldier take a gulping breath.
Steve just smiles and turns back to his food.
'Ms Potts,' Jarvis interrupts Pepper from reading a budget request from one of the software development teams.
'You only came here because you wanted to take him out!' Tony gestures wildly. 'What could have possibly been so interesting that it distracted you both?'
Three surprising things happen very quickly.
'He'll be perfectly safe with me,' he persists. 'I can find him something to eat and some toys.'
'Coffee tastes funny,' Pete tells him.
'Don't do anything I wouldn't do,' Tony advises her.
It's not a bad place to be.
‘Tony…’ Steve catches his elbow as the suit is reforming around him. ‘Please be safe. Please, Tony.’
'Three minutes past ten, Captain.'
‘What…?’ Steve flinches but Tony tells him to ‘just stand still’ so he does.
He's trying to see this from Tony's point of view, he really is, but all he can think is that the other man wants to keep their son to himself.
‘Mute,’ he sees Tony’s mouth move as he turns to face him rather than actually hearing the word and then the music cuts off. ‘Cap, how can I help you?’
He looks so honestly put out that Tony has to laugh at him,
'You,' Steve blurts.
Tony has finished announcing the roll out of the arc reactors and is taking questions from the press when it happens.
It's subtle but Tony definitely flinches,
'There are two of you,' Clint deadpans and the drops his head onto the conference table.
'Please Mom?'
Steve huffs a breath,
It's things like this that'll make him forget not to forgive this man.
It’s another week before Pepper and Tony finally turn up.
'I'm very impressive,' Tony replies. 'You want me to cut up your apple, kiddo?'
In the time before Tony calls again Steve manages to have a borderline normal existance. He works out, he socialises with the other tower inhabitants and he watches some tv.
'I got my people in before SHIELD arrived and... acquired the incubator. It's in my workshop in the tower.'
'Sir, Ms Potts would like your input on drafting a press release. Also, would you like me to anonymously leak details of the surrogate?'
Tony groans,
'Jarvis is a myth,' the man laughs, 'just an Easter Egg.'
It's nice just to listen to Tony's voice.
On the helicarrier they get some strange looks, but they aren't stopped until after Bruce has left for his room and the remaining three of them get to the conference room.
Steve forces himself not to prevent Tony from pulling away.
*          *          *
'Ok,' Tony grabs that box and heads to the lift. 'You can play with those, and with the bots, and I can try to fix what those idiots at SHIELD managed to do by guessing their way towards my tech.'
'He won't mind,' she smirks as she slips behind the wheel.
'Jarvis, add KITT to my list,' he closes the back door and gets into the front.
'Very,' Pepper sounds relieved. 'We have a new contract signed and new people on board for forwarding the Intellicrops programme.'
'Not true,' Steve disagrees quietly.
'Dada needs the helipad for the Queenjets,' Pete tells her with giant innocent eyes that Tony can't pull off anymore.
'We have a deal!' Tony sticks out a hand to shake on it. 'Jarvis make sure you let Cap in to cook for us tomorrow.'
'Jay?' he finally drags in a halfway decent breath.
'Can I call you later?'
‘Great, ok,’ he watches Tony pathetically for a moment before forcing himself to walk away.
'Sure,' Tony shrugs.
It's easier than Tony ever would have guessed to brush the teeth of a nearly unresponsive three and a half year old and then wrestle him into a diaper and pyjamas. He could go straight back to Pepper, but he lingers to watch his son sleep.
'Yeah, thanks, I feel so much better.'
'Are you still there?
'Tony tonytonytony...' Steve gasps and throws his head back again.
'You know that her being a monster has no bearing on you?'
'You're borderline submissive, aren't you pet?'
'Meh,' Tony grins back, 'climbing you mid-orgasm wasn't the best of ideas.'
He may have gotten a little carried away, but it's not like the kid doesn't deserve it.
‘Jarvis,’ Steve makes his mind first thing the next morning, ‘as soon as Tony wakes up can you let me know?’
'I think I've been spending too much time with Tony,' he settles for something that is probably true.
'How many times have you... looped?' she asks gently.
'I miss you.'
'Would you like the muffins before or after breakfast?'
'Where's my car?'
'Peter is upset but unharmed,' Jarvis reports. 'The Stark Industries store please, Captain.'
'My elephant!' Pete objects and clutches at Steve.
'I saw you on tv,' Steve adds, somewhat at a loss as to what to say as Tony isn't really saying anything.
Tony shifts his hand to lace their fingers together and presses a kiss to Steve's forehead,
'He does,' he tells her, 'doesn't mean he wants one with me, though. And I will tell him. Definitely. Before Jim's sixth birthday or Jarvis'll do it for me and the fall out from that would be much worse.'
He laughs,
And, ok, Bruce is quiet, but Steve gets the feeling Bruce finds his presence in his lab distracting.
Bruce can’t hand things to Tony.
Oh, God, he's not there.
'Hey,' Steve smiles, 'an expert yet?'
'A gift from sir,' Jarvis sounds amused.
'Captain,' the AI sounds amused, 'I am able to have a little understood but active incubator, containing a live foetus, moved across the county and installed into sir's workshop without alerting SHIELD. I also avoided allowing any unauthorised access to the technology involved in the incubator or housed in said workshop. I assure you; arranging for some sand to be cleared away is not strenuous.'
to make you trust me?!'
He feels like he's stealing something.
'Tony...'
There’s a pause.
‘What just happened?’ Steve stares.
'Don't fire me!'
'You have work to do?' he asks.
'Yeah,' Tony shrugs.
'English, French, Japanese, German, Russian and Chinese,' Tony rattles off. 'And I can flirt in Italian.'
So the only real problem is that he also wants to be best friends with Tony.
The next hour is one of the most stressful of Steve’s life and when the battle is finally over he immediately contacts SHIELD to check on Tony.
He just needs to get Tony to clarify his role in this.
'You moved as far away as the penthouse and whatever happened still affected you without affecting Captain Rogers,' Jarvis points out.
He rejected Steve.
'Yeah?' Tony cracks a smile. 'So he'll forgive me, right?'
Sorry, I'm mean.
Things are going to work out just fine.
‘Great,’ Tony beams at him, ‘all done. You can go now.’
'You don't have a table,' Steve informs him, 'so we ate at the bar.'
He means to go straight to the kitchen to get himself a drink, and offer one to anyone else who's here, but he's barely two steps out of the lift when Pete is suddenly attached to his leg.
Tony stares at him.
'No,' Tony agrees and then leans against Steve so he can see his phone, 'let's see then?'
'That isn't as comforting as you might think,' Tony sighs and drags his fingers through his hair.
Clint mouths at him.
'Tony?' he calls.
'Sir occasionally apologises in strange ways,' Jarvis tells him, and then adds 'and sometimes before anyone realises he's done anything that needs apologise for.'
'Oh,' that makes sense. 'So Dada is a genius because of coffee?'
'Already do, sugarplum,' Tony replies promptly.
Tony just looks even more baffled.
'Oh, that. Yeah, I know...'
'Tony! Leave those...' Steve stops when he sees the skin where the reactor used to be is already nothing more than an angry looking pink line. 'It's... You perfected the serum?'
'It's fine,' he gives in and goes with his instincts, 'I understand why you don't. Let's just... Let's go from here.'
‘Tony?’
'But he has parties here?'
Tony just looks confused,
'I'm an arsehole,' Tony informs him, 'but if all I manage is to be a better parent to him than mine were to me then he'll turn out alright. There are people in the penthouse now converting my second guest room.'
'It's all about the sex with you kids,' he puts a hand under Steve's jaw to tip his head back for a kiss.
'Why?'
'Like a billionaire,' she rolls her eyes fondly.
Tony shakes his head,
Steve knows there are tears running down his face and some very ridiculous part of his mind is reminding him that Tony doesn't do well with tears so he tugs the suit against him so he can sob into the armour's shoulder.
He sighs and wraps his arms around Steve's waist,
It takes until Tony is pressing kisses just under his naval for Steve to realise Tony's intended destination. His hips jerk a little and Tony's thumbs press against his hips gently.
'I'll take the boy,' an agent smiles and reaches for him.
He just laughs and waves her off.
'Jarvis, you'll tell me if he needs anything?'
'Yes, Captain?' Tony isn't looking at him.
'I don't want to stay...'
There's silence for a few minutes and Tony eventually glances over to see Steve glaring at his coffee.
And Tony screams.
Steve watches Tony with increasing worry after that.
Steve borrows from Tony’s vocabulary as he ducks under the shutter which immediately drops back down behind him.
'Not that you aren't just swell,' he offers Tony an embarrassed grin and hopes their friendship has progressed far enough for this.
*                                  *                                  *
He wakes with a jolt and looks around wildly.
'How long has he been sleeping?'
‘Sir is in his workshop,’ Jarvis tells him, sounding a little too knowing.
'Noth...' Tony trails off. 'Found it, Cap.'
'It will be good to see you again, sir.'
‘It’s my brain,’ Tony actually leans his head against Butterfingers. ‘There’s nothing I’m willing to try.’
'Couple of months,' Tony flicks a hand.
'Right,' Tony agrees.
'You think the interview went ok?' Steve is cold heartedly indifferent to his plight.
The solution is so simple that Steve is a little embarrassed. Tony doesn’t seem to mind though and talks him through using the phone again and tells him to always come down if he needs a hand.
This is not normal.
'Hah, you're lucky we didn't agree to a bet then,' Tony's still grinning at him. 'Rhodey strictly owes me a couple of million and don't let him tell you I owe him a plane, because it hit me not the other way around!'
He's panting against Steve's hair when his position is recalled to him as he suddenly slides down the wall as Steve's legs apparently give out.
'That went well,' Tony comments after Steve leaves.
'Yeah,' Steve is gazing at him strangely again as the doors close between him.
'Indeed, Captain. I shall let sir know Peter's location.'
'Worse,' he grins, 'I'll be seeing reporters!'
'What about the first guest room?'
When he arrives back at the tower JARVIS tells him Tony’s down in the workshop. The sight that greets him when he gets there surely takes several years off his life.
Maybe he should? Tony is rich, powerful, influential, great with Pete... Can Steve offer anything as Jim's father that he can't offer as 'Cap'? Is that what Tony meant?
'Captain,' Jarvis responds frostily. 'Your presence is required at the Stark Industries store.'
Tony stumbles backwards through the door carrying a heavy looking box and interrupts whatever reply Jarvis may have given. Steve takes a breath and squares his shoulders as he crosses the room to take the box from his partner's arms.
‘We cannot wait but I believe we will not be able to complete the task without him. Butterfingers and You can replace the reactor casing. Dummy will assist you.’
'Ok...' he pulls the sheet aside to find a beautiful oil painting. He finds himself studying the brush work before he can stop himself, 'it's lovely. The artist must have been a fan of Da Vinci; it's in the same style.'
*          *          *
Tony just smirks and keeps working.
'There were blueberries,' Pete tells him matter-of-factly.
He sits up and rubs his eyes,
He kneels down to face his son,
(See the end of the chapter for
'Is Pete bouncing on Tony yet?'
‘Just to reassure myself that you’re ok,’ Steve beams at him.
'And who is your favourite Avengers?' she tries to coax out more than a one word answer.
'Come on, Tony! You must have a favourite?' she wheedles.
If they had only managed to get it to work between them...
He has to pee.
*          *          *
'Put her through,' he sits up straight, 'Black Widow?'
He's never seen this many people before. They all seem very busy and they all have a lot of bags.
'Blueberries or chocolate chips?' Steve asks once he's made the batter.
'You got me another present?' he reluctantly accepts it.
The genius sighs,
Steve freezes at the sight of Tony’s chest. He’s seen his teammate shirtless before, hell, it’s Tony, he’s seen him fully naked before, but he’s never looked like this. There’s bloody oozing from around the hole where the arc should be and the casing wall looks pitted and corroded.
Bruce is the first person Steve actually speaks to about Tony’s issues.
'Ok,' Tony agrees, 'I can do that.'
‘Yes yes,’ Tony waves a hand around. ‘EMPs in the building are bad. Never again. I get it, I’m very sorry for inconveniencing you.’
'Rude,' Clint pouts.
'Is it... possible?' Steve gazes at him.
Steve forces himself to leave his live-feed of Tony and do things.
'I'm sorry, ok? I get that you aren't interested.'
'What should I say?'
‘Welcome to my world,’ she pats him on the shoulder.
‘Bastard…’
Hulk is actually looming over Tony now or Steve would be there himself.
'Hey, pumpkin,' Tony grins at the helmet. 'Can I get back to work now?' He's already turned back to the bomb.
'Apparently,' Tony looks down at him. 'Mornin' sweetcheeks.'
'Perhaps Doctor Richards' thesis is simply incorrect,' Jarvis suggests. 'He has had incorrect theories before.'
'I don't always remember what the other guy does, but I remember blinking down at Tony in the lab. I remember a pause and then Tony just looks irritated and tells me 'The signal wouldn't get through your skin anyway; we're going to have to completely rethink our approach.' And the other guy just huffs at him.'
'Pepper...'
'Say that again,' Tony has frozen and stares off into the middle distance.
'How's the hacking?' Clint asks.
Steve tries to give a verbal answer but all that comes out of his mouth is a soft whimper.
'Don't say it like that, it makes you sound like a creep. Also, I used your credit card, I hope you don't mind.'
'We painted pictures for you,' Pete pats his chest with a small hand.
'Why does he get that car?' Clint fake pouts.
'Please...' Steve finally manages to sob. 'Tony, more please! I can't...'
'Might I suggest the possibility of things not ending badly?'
'I've included you more than anyone else,' he shrugs.
‘Stand on my feet,’ Tony instructs then they’re airborne the split second Steve is gripping the armour’s shoulders. Steve yelps and clutches an arm around the suit’s neck to press himself closer to his ride.
‘No,’ Natasha replies. ‘We’re finished up here.’
'Hey,' Tony's petting his hair, 'it's alright, sweetheart. I feel...'
This, honestly, doesn’t surprise Steve. They’ve broken up but they still love each other and he’s not sure Tony could ever bring himself to love someone he didn’t trust.
'I suggest cereal is not beyond your capabilities, sir,' Jarvis is a condescending bastard. 'Alternatively there are also poptarts in the cupboard to your right.'
'How's it playing out?' he steps closer to read the scrolling captions.
Tony's still leaning against his side.
Fury is too controlled to pull a face like he's sucking a lemon.
'Escape pod,' Tony mutters and moves something over.
'I thought you knew,' Tony pets his hair.
'I really do love you, Steve,' Tony has no idea what he's saying before his coffee has kicked in.
What would he have done? If he found a child that was his and Tony's; would he have told Tony immediately? He thinks he would have.
'I'm on a roll with the escape pod,' Tony nods. 'I have a few things to do this afternoon and that call at eleven. Can you have Pete for me for a few hours? I should really speak to those guys in DC.'
Large metal shutters, at least a foot thick, come down from the ceiling and completely block any view of the lab.
'And you?' Pepper asks. 'You think it's fair to you?'
'Then you communicate only through Jarvis, and Jim transfers between you on the lift,' Rhodey goes for the worst case scenario.
'The machine he was hiding behind?' Tony reminds him and Bruce nods vaguely. 'An incubator.
Tony isn't wearing any of the suit at all.
‘Tony,’ he tries to reason over the comm., ‘you’re bleeding; just come over so we can…’
'Where's Pete?' she asks. 'With Steve?'
Steve’s expression makes Tony laugh tiredly,
‘Tony!’ Steve hisses and just gets a dismissive wave in response.
'What's the verdict, kiddo? Does Cap know his way around a pancake?'
'You do not,' Jarvis replies dryly. 'However, I do not believe you would survive long without me.'
Why do Steve’s feelings for Tony seem to be materializing as the desire to touch his bare toes?
'You named him,' Steve approves as he sits down across from Tony. A quick glance at the screen that is the coffee table shows a large number of pictures of brightly coloured children's toys.
*                                  *                                  *
'Do you have a preference regarding flavours?'
'Yeah...' Steve manages to gasp out against his shoulder.
He nods, his gaze still fixed on the other man as he hugs his son.
'Alright,' Tony thinks that over. 'I can work with that.'
'Colonel?'
'She is trying to prove that the existence of your son is not affecting your working capability.'
She initially works around him as though not quite seeing him but when he offers to help her in anyway he can she smiles and begins to open up.
'I merely hoped to give you a nice memory to dwell on before you go to sleep,' Jarvis replies.
'Yes, ma'am,' he smiles back before shrugging helplessly, 'sorry, Pepper. It's... It just seems nice, you know?'
'I guess,' Pete nuzzles his head under his chin.
'Don't you dare!' Steve retorts, appalled.
Tony sighs in frustration,
The first interview with the Stark Heir with photographs; she's going to be rich if she plays this right.
‘Is Captain America encouraging a bad work ethic?’ Tony asks in a fake shocked tone.
'Truth, justice and the American way,' Tony rattles off.
'I am afraid I cannot answer you.'
It's hard to know if Tony is released early from hospital because the doctors are happy that he's in a state to be allowed home or if it's just a matter of Tony being used to getting his own way.
'Ok,' he crawls to the edge of the bed, dragging his blanket and his sword. 'And Dada will come back later?' He pushes his sword onto the floor and slips off the bed after it.
'I need to work out some sort of...' he grimaces, 'arrangement with Tony. I need to know to what extent he's going to let me be a father.'
Bruce just smiles.
He doesn't need to get Pete's hopes up when he knows Steve won't be visiting for a while.
*          *          *
'I bet Stark has a suit that can be on fire...' Clint makes no sense.
‘Jarvis?’ Steve bites his lip. ‘Is he…? He’s not…’
‘Sounds fair to me,’ he grins at Tony’s bemused look.
'Alright!' Tony throws his hands into the air four hours later. 'We're getting nowhere; worst case scenario if I just pull the plug on this thing?' he glares at the generator which continues to glow.
Half an hour later Tony extracts himself from Steve's grip and throws on some clothes. Downstairs he devours his food as he browses the news channels and then logs himself back into his network.
'What? No,' Tony scoffs. 'I'm not going to do this alone. What the hell do I know about caring for a baby? I'm going to shove them together at every possible opportunity. I'm just not going to tell Cap that the kid's his.'
'Sir, may I remind you that the press will be here in four hours for your photo shoot?'
He quirks a smile,
'That's... He really trusts me, huh?'
He finds Tony already up to his elbows in car engine parts in the workshop,
'No need to sounds so fuuu...' Tony glances at his son, 'unky...'
'I have an Iron Man car,' he shows them. 'It's my second favourite because it has a little Dada inside.'
'Nine in the morning here,' Tony dismisses. 'It's an important scientific measure; StarkTime, the time zone that I am in and therefore the time zone with the most inventive genius.'
'I am still drinking scotch,' Tony points out.
'I'm sorry sir, what would be your preference for this fake woman's hair colour?'
'You're CEO,' Steve adds gently when Tony trails off, 'you're the one that told me that means you can skip meetings.'
Tony barely makes a sound as he grabs Steve’s bicep in a bruising grip with his good left hand and shifts him so he’s clutching onto that side of the suit.
'If I go find Cap and we get food can I come back here after?'
'This way, Captain,' the man gestures and leads the way.
'Call Pepper, Jay,' he sighs and walks over to the bed so he can collapse backwards and relax.
'Mine and Tony's,' he clarifies. 'He explained it... they manipulated my cells and added Tony's DNA, or something, it probably wasn't as simple as that sounds.'
'Are you falling asleep on me?' Steve smiles and flips over the toast to brown the other side.
'And Howard?' Steve almost doesn't want to know.
'You're just going to let him decide?' she stares at him.
'Yeah, I get it,' Steve retorts and then the doors slide shut.
'Right,' she agrees. 'Tony's baby.'
'Who are you calling?' Clint grimaces as he hands it over. 'Thor will be terrible in this situation, Tasha is away, Bruce would be even worse than Thor...'
They fall into silence as Tony drinks and the bots make small happy noises.
Ok, he may have just nuzzled Steve's neck.
'Tony,' he fights the impulse to reach out, 'please tell me?'
‘Jarvis, lockdown the workshop.’
'So,' Tony sends him another message, 'what are you wearing?'
'Rogers, you've been in this century for long enough to remember to carry your phone.'
'Have you seen him?' Tony scoffs. 'Can you imagine having that under you?'
'Tony,' he calls again and skids to an instinctive halt when Hulk roars again and smashes a bench into a nearby tree.
‘He was really angry,’ Steve ducks his head and realises his eyes are brimming. His bottom lip trembles.
Is he kidding himself by trying to have a relationship steeped with this much mistrust?
True enough Tony steps from the lift a minute later,
Tony lays awake on his back with Steve latched to his side. The soldier has fallen into a deep sleep so Tony turns his attention to his latest projects and adjusts some plans in his mind and asks Jarvis to run some simulations.
'Ok?'
Hope you enjoy :-)
'It's not like I haven't before,' Tony smirks.
'Yes, Captain?'
He flinches.
'I was not wired into your house there so you dialled your Malibu property to speak to me.'
'It's fine,' Steve gives him a tight smile and shifts the arm Tony had been leaning on to the top of the sofa. He then blushes as Tony just tucks himself under his arm.
'Peter is approaching Captain Rogers' suite now.'
*                                  *                                  *
Steve looks at the boy in his lap, brown hair and eyes, skin that's slightly darker than his own, a gaze that seems to be obtaining knowledge through pure force of will...
‘You…?’ Steve tries to query without being rude.
'What are you going to tell Steve?'
'No,' he shakes his head and looks back at Tony, 'no! This is... This is great, Tony.'
*          *          *
'Definitely,' Tony agrees. 'Or if I get there sooner I'll let you know.'
‘Just back away,’ Steve forces his voice to keep calm.
'Finally,' he groans as the lift starts to rise, 'ok, who's got Pete?'
'I meant Thor,' Tony grins and collects his coffee as the others move away to the seating area.
'Of course, sir.'
'They can't know what traits it'll display,' Tony scowls, 'unless they know the serum will be passed on.'
Steve spends the next hour in a state of increasing worry before Tony's eyes finally flicker open.
'Told him,' she murmurs. 'And what did he say?'
Is he being unreasonable? It has only been four days or so.
'Well, I can't have that.'
'Sir, Ms Potts has arrived at the tower,' Jarvis pulls Tony out of his work. 'It is also now half an hour before the time you scheduled for dinner.'
'Ask Tony out,' Natasha advises. 'Worst he can do is say no.'
Tony looks up from his work as Steve is granted access and looks faintly baffled. He’s still wearing the clothes from when Steve last saw him so he assumes either Tony hasn’t slept or he slept down here with his bots.
'I can't keep myself from your skin any longer; I take off the gauntlets and get my hand into your pants. I start stroking you slowly just to hear you whine. I want to hear you beg me to finish you. Do you think I'll be able to make you beg, Steve?'
Steve is kissing him now. Hard.
He doesn’t allow any of the doctors to touch him or to replace any of their monitoring equipment. The argument would probably have lasted longer but Tony is wearing one of his gauntlets when the doctor comes in, which is a little intimidating as it seems to respond to Tony’s mood and powers up. Steve isn’t sure how far Tony would have gone to stand his ground on this issue, but it’s ok because Steve uses his ‘patriotic powers of persuasion’ (TM Stark Ind.) to send the doctor on his way.
'Where are we going?' Pete gazes out the window.
Tony nods,
Steve stares at him in horror.
Fury narrows his eyes at Tony, who smirks in response.
'Sir,' Jarvis repeats dutifully, 'I do not...'
'Dunno,' Pete gazes up at him with big sad eyes.
Tony blinks,
'Hey, I've just realised my two best fellas are serum enhanced,' Tony grins. 'Anyone less awesome than me would be jealous.'
‘Hurt.’
'I need to teach you to make coffee,' he informs the boy.
'Tell her I'm on the way up and that Pete's sleeping.'
Tony shrugs and scratches at his chest,
'Well, I know how you love to keep your board members happy,' Steve is looking at him strangely but not moving away so Tony feels he can continue to soak up his warmth.
'Of course I have,' he sighs. 'You knew I would.'
He can practically feel how Steve isn't convinced. In the edge of his vision he can see Steve trying to catch his eye so he fixes his gaze on his son instead. He's lining up cars, probably ready to send them all shooting across the room.
He’ll only need an hour or so to himself before he can face his friend again.
'Sir is arguing the relevance of what appears to be an anomalous data point,' Jarvis replies.
'Please tell him?'
This can't be happening.
‘Yeah, I did,’ he fights for something to add.
Steve curls up towards him as he gasps and then throws himself backwards as he thrusts himself up against Tony. For a moment Tony thinks he's going to come but then Steve's emitting a sob as he falls back from the edge.
Tony smirks at him,
The boy's head tips to the side as if he's considering the question and Steve hears a sudden intake of breath from Natasha across the table.
