The mutant moved closer, and Sherlock struggled against the restraints, breath coming faster and faster as the outlook began to look more and more bleak. He wasn’t going to escape, the mutants were going to tear him apart, tear his child apart for defending a cause he didn’t even

how to cook, so he couldn’t be held responsible for however terrible the eggs were once they hit the plate. His eating habits were far from normal, but if he chose to carry this child to term, and he did despite his better judgment and the terrible situation it was being born into, he would have to start eating regularly. As would Tony. And that was the real reason he stood there, bare feet moving across the tiled floor to grab a second plate.
“An’ before you shut me down, as you so… often do, we’re in your bedroom. Doesn’ get more private than this. Well, until you figure out I got a camera up there.” Tony gestured with that sly little grin, soon followed by a playful giggle when Steve tossed his shirt at him. “I’m joking. I would just hack your webcam whenever you visited a porn site. What do you use? Pornhub? Tube8? Don’t tell me Spankwire, Rogers, or--”
It wasn’t
I do not own any of the characters. TW for Abortion Mention/Contemplation.
That was it. Those were the words he needed more than he had realized and Tony sucked in another sharp breath. Sherlock had won. The bastard. Sighing, Tony just nodded and returned to eating his salad. “First sign of a situation turning bad, you get the fuck out. You
want to see him. Steve didn’t have the fucking
Tony sat back against the cold tile, hand pressing through his hair and half expecting some of it to fall out. But when he removed his hand, nothing came away. No sudden disease that would make this all go away in a few short months. No easy copout this time. His stomach turned again and he swallowed the groan, eyes closed as he pressed his hands to his face in hopes of transferring the cold. Any minor soothing he could find was appreciated. He lasted another two minutes before he had to surge forward, hands out and grasping the sides of the toilet bowl and emptied the little contents of his stomach. Shuddering, he fell to the side, bare chest slick with his mild fever. As if his emotional state was miserable enough, now his body decided to multiply his misery.
Tony returned the stare. “A pregnant man asking to be put in a suit and get the shit beat out of him.”
, where Steve’s whole bedroom was still left, pristine as the rogue boy scout left it. But his options were limited and at least here he could spend time with Rhodes. And tell him. Sherlock had been flown to the compound shortly after Pepper had texted him, and the younger Stark had little trouble settling back into the living arrangement. Tony had made the mistake of forgetting Sherlock had practically lived with Logan two floors up. “Abso-fucking-lutely not.”
Snorting, Sherlock pushed his phone away. Logan was a bloody idiot. Yet there
“WARNING. WARNING. INCOMING PROJECTILE. EXPLOSIVE.” Friday and Watson informed their respective Stark and the brothers were off the ground immediately.
, are you listening? I said we need more Avengers. New Avengers. The council is meeting tomorrow to go over some prospects, if you want a say, you better be there. Understand?”
“The suit was dead weight, I couldn’t follow him, he got away, I don’t know where. And unless you decide to put me on an exclusive mission to hunt him down, I’m not looking for a single fucking thing to
they didn’t need to. As they both turned for another visual sweep, both suits began to beep, flashing a warning in front of the occupants eyes.
But he wasn’t going to leave Tony. Not in his state, which had been confirmed a week before the team went to Lagos. Nor in any other state. Sherlock was there for him. And Tony had said there would be room for revisions and rewrites. He would just have to wait. This, of course, did Sherlock little good in that moment as he stared intently at his phone screen and wished the father of his unborn child would contact him. Tony had his excuse, a bloody good excuse, too. And perhaps Sherlock had one as well. If Logan ever knew, he’d come out to see him, to see them, and risk getting himself caught. But Sherlock wasn’t entirely certain that was the sole reason he avoided telling Logan. There was something...
After a low grumble and something that sounded like an insult, Tony sat down and stared at his food with a grimace. Sherlock watched him, lips pressed together as he began composing a list of possible arguments he could use to get Tony to resort his eating habits. If he had to rethink his eating habits. Blinking, Sherlock moved around the counter to take the stool beside him, expression softening as Tony hesitantly began to eat.
“You could have killed the kid. The kid
His name leaving Steve’s lips drew his attention back to the two entwined on the bed, limbs wrapping around one another as Steve eased his cock inside of him. A phantom shiver ran across their skin, but this time Tony didn’t have the warmth of Steve’s lips on his shoulders to stop the goosebumps from painting his flesh. That was enough. Tony tapped the side of the glasses, shutting the memory down before he got the instant replay of Steve inseminating him.

Sleep soon overcame him, and it had been the first night Tony slept without morning sickness waking him at odd hours of the night.
His hand dropped and he nodded blankly so no one caught on to him completely blowing off what was happening in front of him. That was the reason. Pathetic as it fucking was, it was the last good thing he had of Steve. The proof that at some point, the son of a bitch chose Tony over Ba--. At the very, very, biological basics of the whole ordeal, the child was going to be living proof that he and Steve had been together. For a shining moment before it ended with a vibranium shield lodged in his arc reactor. It would have killed him if he hadn’t had that fucking surgery. Maybe, for half a second, Steve forgot. And it was meant to kill him. To kill

way it could be traced back to him… Logan did not do well in cages, Sherlock knew as much and the last thing he wanted was to be the very reason the man was put back in one. Still, he checked his phone, some part of him hoping Logan would have found other means to contact him. A pause, then the man cursed quietly. Logan thought he was upset with him. Or worse, Logan thought he ideologically agreed with the Accords, and ultimately with Superhero and Mutant registration.  And of course it didn’t help that whatever texts Logan might have tried sending, whatever calls he might have tried to make hadn’t gotten through.
The latter, Tony decided. And that was reason enough for him.
“Stark.” His name was hazy, like he was hearing it through cotton balls. It didn’t even register as his name; Tony was too far gone in this twisted realization. There was a pair of fingers in his face, snapping harshly and his name was said again with more urgency. “
“No, sir.” Tony gave him a lazy salute. He didn’t need Ross knowing about this medical condition. And he was right, Rhodes was out of commission, maybe indefinitely and that was on Tony. He had to work like hell to pick up the slack he fucking caused. “We done? I’m headin’ out.”
Silence hung between them, waiting for something to give about the raft. Either for Ross to pull out concrete evidence that Tony had knowingly denied the call to help Rogers and them get away, or Tony was going to reveal Rogers gave him means to contact him. Nothing happened, and Tony just raised his eyebrows, waiting for Ross to move past the bullshit and just accuse him or move on. Fortunately, Ross moved on.
Logan expertly, or perhaps daftly, ignored that. His tactic had been annoyance and pestering, and he ended his troubles with a grin and a kiss followed by a quiet ‘You can’t annoy a machine.’
“You- “

The older brother laughed, a shiver beginning to rock his body. He was coming down from the fever. Rapidly. Sluggishly, he pulled the towel off of him, dropping it in the corner of the shower with a sickly wet ‘slop’ sound. Sherlock was already there with a dry towel, gently working it over his skin as Tony sighed. “What are we going to do, Sherly?”
When Sherlock wanted to learn something, it was surprisingly easy for him to grasp. After only showing him once, Tony watched as his younger brother went about putting together his own suit. Occasionally, he would pause and ask a question, but otherwise, he managed it on his own. The same went for coding and VI integration. Sherlock insisted on making his own virtual intelligence, and Tony let him. Soon, Watson was Sherlock’s guardian angel, and he helped Friday run the compound. Friday had openly expressed her thanks for not having to be responsible for Sherlock’s less than safe experiments.
In spectacularly ironic fashion only Starks could endure, they fell for their own respective World War Two veterans and would, as fate demanded, undergo this terrible political schism while both with child. But Sherlock knew his brother was taking the worst of this. While still separated, at least Logan and Sherlock were in the background, they didn’t have to face one another. Perhaps that made it worse. Sherlock didn’t have an excuse not to tell Logan; Tony still had to save face. At least he could tell himself that.
“The panic attacks or the vomiting?” Sherlock was standing, grabbing extra towels out of the closet to mop up the water. “Morning sickness varies, but it shouldn’t last all day. Only spike during certain periods. If you’re lucky, it will be constant. But, seeing our situation…”
“Alright. Alright, come on. I need a distraction… I think we got a few days until Ross is ready to talk about the new Avengers, so we can give the suit more thought.” When his brother removed the mask, giving him a quizzical look, Tony just shook his head. “I’ll explain later. Help me clean this shit up.”
“Oxygen levels destabilizing,” Watson said urgently. Sherlock closed his eyes, doing his best to keep his breath even, swallowing back the panic attack. All he wanted in that moment was to see Logan.

. Something he didn’t entirely understand nor could put into words. And that was maddening. This was the trouble of affection and romance? He missed the days he was avoided for being synonymous with a machine.
Sherlock turned as Watson warned him of another incoming missile, this one from the opposite direction, and he crouched to launch but was stopped by Tony’s strained voice. “No! Don’t, it’s a trap. Stay on the ground and blast it down, don’t let the shrapnel near you.”
night. The night this whole thing went to shit, where he made a spectacular mess out of an already bad situation. But he didn’t know then. All he cared about was getting that blue eyed poster boy in his tailored Kiton Blue Stripe pants. He loved Pepper dearly, but trying to breech the whole ‘Hey, honey, I sort of like it up the ass sometime, think you could help’ hadn’t gone very well and she was now under the impression that Tony was a closeted gay man even though the term bisexual perfectly described the situation, but whatever. So there he was, at the Avenger’s compound, escaping his mansion because Pepper was mad at him. And there Steve was, fresh off a training session, walking around his room and gathering fresh clothes to take with him to the shower room. ‘Course handsome over there would be too shy to walk around the compound in nothing but a towel. Tony was sitting on his bed, fingers pressed together –huh, Sherlock does that too-, turning his head to watch Steve move.
“Howard - ” both Momma and Aunt Peggy begin with a warning in their voices. But Anthony beats them to the punch.
Horowitz returns his smile with a small watery one of his own. Edwards lifts a hand to wipe away the track of tears from his cheek. They stare at one another for a long moment, and time seems to slow down exponentially as Steve watches them. Then the two men lean forward at the same time, and meet each other halfway with a tender kiss.
“Anthony, you can’t tell anyone that Steve is Captain America,” Howard tells him as they’re driving in the car. Howard’s face is pinched and he has a frown on his face.
“What do you mean?” Steve asked, eyebrows furrowed in curiosity.
soulmates.”
<Only bad men lie!> She had told him on numerous occasions, growing up. <And bad men go to Hell! Do
He hears her approach him slowly, aware of how mindful she is of where she steps as though she doesn’t want to disturb the destruction. Steve just picks up the bottle of liquor beside him and pours himself another useless drink.
“Howard,” Aunt Peggy says gently, moving closer to Anthony's father. She’s at his side, laying a hand on one of his shoulders and he immediately deflates; relaxing at the contact. “I know you cared about Steve, I did as well. I know it hurts, even after almost thirty years of him being gone. But talking about him keeps him alive despite the pain. If you talk to Tony about
“Darling, you’ve gotten so
<I can take care of him, Sarah,> Granny McDonald reprimanded disapprovingly in Gaelic when she came to check on Steve and found him on his Ma’s lap.
Horowitz’s shoulders are shaking, with his arm covering his face; trying to stop the flood of tears. Edwards silently moves closer to him, and Steve sees the inquiry on Edwards’ lips. Horowitz cries so hard that he’s hiccupping and can’t give much of an answer. Edwards can’t do anything but rub Horowitz’s back comfortingly, murmuring words to him that Steve resolutely isn’t going to hear.
, instead of Captain America, there would be no confusion. He barely knows his mother, let alone his father - let him know his ‘soulmate’.”
Tony hears somewhere in the distance. Must be a radio around.
Rhodey’s arms completely envelope him in a hug. Tony’s nose presses into the skin of his friend’s throat as he's held securely.
Steve blinked down at his friend. He’d very rarely seen his friend so solemn that it was often a shock in these rare moments that Steve considered them precious examples of the trust Bucky had in him, and treasured every one of them. Because of it, Steve was compelled to agree. “I promise, Buck. I promise I’ll try.”
“Sorry,” he says, putting his latest project into a folder titled Wherefore Art Thou Mark?, and shoving it aside for later. “Could you repeat that?”
Anthony juts out his bottom lip, frowning at Jarvis's words.

. It doesn’t matter anymore. The small talk doesn’t last, though; Steve knows she’s smart and will catch on to what he’s doing. It’s only a question of how long he can get away with it. As it turns out, not very long.
you will be meeting your soulmate before you’re even ready.”
They don’t know about the man behind the name.
Flinging himself down onto the cramped settee, the bottle of scotch threatens to spill before he rights himself and his grip. Sprawling his legs out before taking a swig, he stares up at the wood-panelled ceiling, his vision swimming. Distantly, he notes that his chest hurts, and is aware enough to raise his hand to rub the center of it, unfortunately releasing his grip on the bottle, which clatters to the floor.
When Steve was eleven, he began to have funny thoughts about men. It wasn’t until he hit puberty that he first laid eyes on a bluesy. One of his pals, Joey, had shown him and the other neighborhood boys a book he’d taken from his older brother. It had pictures of girls doing improper things to guys, and while the eyes of the other boys were riveted on the buxom blonds, redheads, and brunettes drawn on the pages, Steve’s eyes were glued to the robust men.
“...just lost his friend, Sergeant Barnes--” said the officer that had met him at the door.
He shut his mouth with a snap. “But,” he tried, “you’re a gorgeous dame.” She raised an eyebrow at him. “I, I mean woman,” he stammered. “I just. I don’t understand.”
Surprised, Anthony whips his head up to look at Cap. His eyes look softer. Kinder.

Steve gives the radio a curt nod. But as he pushes with all his strength against the controller, holding it as tightly as he can, he thinks again about his soulmate. He honest to God
“I see,” Jarvis says with a hint of a smile as he tucks the blankets around Anthony’s body while he settles against the huge and comfy pillows.
“What’s the point in soulmates anyway?” Tony asks with a scoff, staring down at his stupidly empty wrist. “Why do we put so much into something that’s just gonna cause us pain? My parents were a Match, did I ever tell you that? They were a Match and their marriage wasn’t exactly the love story for the ages. It wasn’t like the end all, be all, Match - that honor went to Ana and Jarvis.”

Will have
And then, of course, his parents had to go and die on him.
“Death,” he slurs, succumbing to sleep again.
“It’s the same color as Ana’s eyes,” Anthony murmurs quietly to himself, then looks back up at his guardian. Anthony squints, leaning forward slightly to look into Jarvis’s eyes, and after a moment his own widen in realization. “It’s like
I could have something--”

“Why should my having a Mark change the way I feel about myself?” Peggy challenged gently, leaning forward and staring into his eyes intently, her grip on his wrist tightening. “Having a Mark shouldn’t change how one feels about oneself. I love myself as I am without the help of a soulmate. I know my value, Rogers. I don’t need the opinion of a soulmate to validate it.”
“Oh. Er,” Tony starts, wrinkling his forehead in thought. He remembers how cold the operating room had been, and the immediate warmth that engulfed him in the dream almost as soon as he went to sleep on the table. “It was toasty. Nice.”
Steve frowned down at his own blank, bandless wrist. “Does everyone have a Mark?” he asked, rubbing his empty wrist self-consciously.
The irony, of course, of having a revelation about what a soulmate means, is having said revelation at the moment of one’s inescapable death. Despite the situation, it makes Steve laugh: the timing could have been much better.
Steve hissed.
“So when’s the big date?” he asked after a lapse in conversation.
. Not like those horrible Captain America cartoons that don’t even sound like him. We may have to accept that maybe…” she pauses to exhale a shaky breath, “maybe Steve and Anthony
“Why do they turn gray?” Steve asked, scrunching his nose in confusion.
“We know that, dear,” his momma says, turning to look down at him. Her golden hair shines bright in the sunlight, making her look like an angel.
Anthony insists, feeling his eyebrows coming together.
“I love you,” she admits softly. She sounds so small and so very far away to him. “I don’t need a Mark to tell me so.”
“I’ll be right outside,” Rhodey tells him and Tony nods in acknowledgement. Then Rhodey shuts the door behind him, finally leaving Tony and the doctor alone. Somehow, the absence of his best friend and his uncle make it easier to breathe.
Though he’s confused, Anthony gives a slight nod, gripping the toy tightly against his chest. “Okay,” he agrees.
Bucky placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder and squeezed. He smiled softly at his friend. “Thanks, Punk.”
Zola turns on Schmidt almost a few hours later.
“Just promise me something, Punk?” Bucky asked, breaking the peaceful quiet.
Tony frowns, his head pounding painfully in time with the muffled bass outside the cramped tiled bathroom. He waves a hand at the guy. “Y’don have to stay. Jus’ leave your name an’ number at the door an’ I’ll get back to you.”

It isn’t long before his thoughts circle back to The Train. Steve keeps running it through his head. If he’d been quicker to get up after being knocked into the side of the train, if he’d done his job and knocked out that Hydra goon right when he saw him, if his aim wasn’t off, if he hadn’t been fooling around and
The doctor nods again, and jots that down. “Okay,” she sighs, sounding satisfied for the first time since they started as she closes her clipboard and lowers it to her side. Her dark eyes flick up to meet his, and with the seriousness of an undertaker says, “Normally this goes without saying, Mr. Stark, but I think for you it bears spelling out: do
Tony blinks, the question out of left field. “Yeah,” he replies, “when I was a kid. It happened on my fifth birthday.” His eyebrows pinch together. “Why?”
He can't cry. And that hurts. Or it would hurt, if Steve is able to feel anything. There’s nothing except a numbness throughout his body that’s left him feeling bland and flat. If he could cry, that would mean being able to feel again. He feels this loss acutely in his chest, and it’s nothing like he’s ever experienced before. When his Ma died of TB, and Granny McDonald died of influenza, he’d cried so hard for them both that he would launch into a coughing fit. He hadn’t been able to
Anthony gazes down at his wrist, smiling, waiting for a colorful Mark of his own to magically appear.
Silence stretched out again, crickets filling the air between them.
It doesn’t stop him from wondering about the nameless person he has yet to meet that is meant for him.
. He’s so comfortable, he doesn’t want to wake up.
his bedroom, this is his father’s study.
. Maybe that’s even better than perfect.
a Christian church--it might have been a temple, for all he can tell. There’s no roof above his head, or any walls left standing to box him in. There’s only small indications of what it had once been--a few blackened slabs of wood left standing, like ribs poking out of the charred earth. Black ash covered the ground, mingling with the dry brown dirt, shattered glass, and rubble where there had once been an altar.
She helps him climb into bed, kisses him goodnight and he turns over onto his left side once she’s done. She leaves him alone with his bedroom door open a crack, a beam of light streaming into the room. He frowns down at the bedspread, blowing a raspberry before rolling over onto his back. He lifts his eyes to the ceiling, pouting a little at being made to go to bed. His eyes feel heavy again, so he turns over onto his right, stopping mid-turn when he catches sight of the toy on his bedside table.
when he finds out about the atrocity and begs for its immediate removal. Rhodey, understandably, and very politely, refuses.)
, Steven!
Tony looks at him for a long moment before he laughs, shaking his head. “Well, that’d be weird, if you loved me like a dad. Considering that, you know, you predate the dinosaurs and all, whereas I, in comparison to your state as a relic, am in the springtime of my youth.”
The cold is getting sharper now. More poignant. Nobody will find him in time, he knows: without the arc reactor functioning, FRIDAY would’ve already stopped sending his location. By the time someone gets here, he’ll already freeze over, he’ll already find himself finally walking into the embrace of death, and he finds himself kind of laughing about it, despite the agony, because he’s avoided death for so long, despite wanting it for a while back there, and here it came, courtesy of Captain America, his childhood hero. He had memories of cuddling with a Captain America bear—hand-stitched by his Mom—believing with that childish desperation that it would keep him safe from evil, that his hero would never, ever,
He’s not sure if his belief that their relationship was going to be ended was a belief that Steve hated him as so much as a desire

into Steve’s shoulder as he releases inside of him like he’s always dreamed about doing, lost in the sound of Steve’s cries and the feel as the muscles around him milk him for his orgasm. Steve comes between them with a moan, their stomachs sticky with the feel of Steve’s cum.
years old, Steve! They’ve got so much time that’s been fucking lost, Steve, and I can fix that, I can bring them all together, but I’m so worried about losing him that I can’t even tell the kid that they exist!” Tony’s chest is heaving, and he looks like he’s ready to rip something apart, and now Steve can understand why he’s been so angry recently—he’d be, too, if his morality was fighting with his selfishness.
, and while he’s not all too big on cuddling, he’s more than accepting of it when Steve wraps his arms around his waist and pulls him in close, Steve’s heavy head laying upon his shoulder. The warmth of Steve burrowing into his side is way better than the blankets, he decides, and far less expensive to replace (though he’s never been a man to worry about expense, truth be told).
Tony’s in a crumpled pile of himself in the middle of the main room of his private suite, the sounds of his ragged breaths the only sound to break through that of the thumping sound of Steve’s own blood, hands trembling furiously as he claws at himself, his face contorted into a damn near unrecognizable display of anguish. Tony’s not crying, not currently anyways, but his eyes are swollen and bloodshot regardless, open wide and unfocused, darting around as if looking for information but unable to take any of it. His lips move as if he’s talking to himself, but Steve’s not hearing any words make it through the shuddering, heaving breaths that leave Tony’s mouth currently.
“I’m tired,” he mumbles, “I’m gonna wash up and go to bed.”
It’s around ten when Peter finally whispers, “If I hadn’t come back up here, would you have ignored me and Dad forever?” in the small voice that only a child can manage.
“Doesn’t help his dad fights crime for a living and is constantly in the way of harm,” Steve reminds him, “The mother hen inclination isn’t exactly without good reason.” He reaches out now, a hand touching Tony’s cheek gently, as if he’s afraid he’ll break him if he’s too rough. “We’re both here, you know. We’re not about to let you take on the world by yourself.”
Blissed out, he allows a rare silence to come over him, losing his focus in Steve’s soft humming and the lazily tracing finger he has drafting a mystery image across his stomach, staring up at the ceiling as he tries to regain some sort of semblance of his normal self. What’s just occurred is a moment that he’s never really hoped enough would happen, and his fantasies had nothing on the reality of it all. He wasn’t as ready for it as he’d thought he’d be, and yet, he can’t imagine it have going any better than it had—it’s a moment that he wants nothing more than some sort of image to remember, because his mind is great for remembering plans and blueprints, but not so much for these few, fleeting moments of complete and utter happiness.
Steve sighed, slowly, before saying, “You’re right,” and he’ll be damned if that resulting flinch of Tony’s doesn’t hurt before he continues, “They should be his world, if all was fair and just in the world like you constantly remind me it isn’t. If whomever it was hadn’t interfered with Peter’s life, then they would be. But that’s already happened, Tony, and there’s no way to turn back the clock and stop it from happening. But that doesn’t mean that you being Peter’s father is wrong because of it. If anything, in my eyes, Peter needs you far more because of it, because while he’s lost all this time with the family he’s never even been aware he’s possessed, he found his way to you, a man who not only found his family, but goes out of his way to let him know that he’s even got one to look towards every single day.” Steve looks past Tony now. “They’re his blood, but you’re his family, Tony, and if I know Peter the way I think I do, that’s all that’s going to ever matter to him.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Clint give Tony an incredulous look, but Steve just laughs. “It’d be more correct to say that I can’t stand to see you pout,” he says.
Peter sleeps that night. Not well, but he does, hogging the covers on Steve’s bed because he refuses to be alone, using Steve’s right arm as a makeshift pillow, and for the third night in a row, Steve doesn’t sleep, but it’s not because of misery, for the first time in three nights—it’s because Peter is drooling all over his arm and his face is too adorable not to snap a quick photograph using the tablet, though it’s awkward when he only has his left hand to use, and he can’t help but smile although he’s an emotional wreck. He almost sends it to Tony, but he stops himself just in time.
“It’s not the same thing, Clint,” Steve begins as he shakes his head, trying to ignore the fact that his stomach’s dropped.
Steve laughs a bit. “Tony doesn’t love me, Peter,” he responds.
“Kind of,” he responds noncommitally.
Rhodey nods. “It’s not,” he agrees, “But it still needs to happen.”
Steve’s listening far too intently for an answer for his own good.
Peter pouts, but it’s all in good spirits, Tony can tell, his eyes twinkling as he says, “Hope you don’t keel over and die, old man,” all but running out the door with his coat on upside-down, struggling to pull on his backpack.
Thank you to all who've commented and left kudos and bookmarked and just otherwise came back to read this story! It means a lot to little ol' me, who's just some brat who prefers to write fanfics as opposed to having a social life :) I hope you all love this chapter as much as I do, and again, thank you for this incredible adventure you've allowed me to explore - the world of writing stories in CONTINUITY!
There’s a bit of backlash to his statement, but Steve doesn’t pay it all too much mind, mostly because it’s the truth, what he’s said—any fight that they’re going to have with the Mandarin isn’t going to be one that the terrorist has any sort of chance of winning. Tony may be alive, but it didn’t make the crimes the man’s committed lessen, not when Steve’s got the days of Peter’s distress on his shoulders; not when he’s going to remember the sounds of Peter’s screams of anguish when the Malibu house goes up in an explosion of flames. He can only hope that they never find out who this person is—for his own sake more than their own, because he’s not entirely sure he’ll remember who he’s supposed to be when he’s choking the life out of him.
Steve to hate him, he realizes now, because if he really thinks about it, Steve’s looked at him this way damn near close to every day, though usually he’s not as blatant about it. For every day for these past two months or so, Steve’s put the two of them—Tony and Peter—before everything else, showing them more devotion and care than Tony really thought himself deserving of. This look is nothing new—in fact, if he digs deeper, this look stretches

Tony winces in response. “No. Not at that point. You’re all clear on that front, Steve-o.” He breaks eye contact, looking down at the photograph as he bites his lip, tapping the face of the possible James Buchanan Barnes pictured within with his index finger, rhythm sharp and quick, tap after tap after tap, and Steve notices how this time, Tony doesn’t exactly deny having lied about being okay, though he hasn’t confirmed it.
Steve feels as if wounded. “I—”

, aren’t they, they’re his actual family, and he… he deserves to know, doesn’t he? That’s what I told Natasha. That’s what I told Clint. He deserves to know he’s not alone, right?” Tony shakes his head, his laughter verging on hysteria as he continues, “Because he’s not. He’s got two people in that house who love him—and they haven’t forgotten Peter, Steve, not for a minute, because May Parker—that’s his aunt’s name, May—she goes to a support group for people who’ve lost people, specifically,
Steve nods. “Okay, then,” he agrees, but confusingly enough, he stays right where he stands as Tony walks off towards the bedroom, watching Tony go as if he weren’t supposed to come with.

“Can we do that more often?” Steve asks breathlessly.
Tony laughs. “I welcome that idea, yes,” he agrees, looking over at Steve fondly, running a hand across Steve’s cheek to get the man to look at him, earning for himself a stupid, fucked-out grin from the blond that he just

Tony grins. “Ah, Sydney. I remember her. She was such a twat.”
friends.” Before Steve can even think to be offended, Peter continues, “Tony and Clint are friends. Bruce and Tony; friends. Uncle Rhodey and Tony—best friends.” He licks his lips—a small display of the nervousness Steve hasn’t even been aware that Peter’s been feeling—before continuing, “But anyone can look and see that you guys are way past friendship.”
That being said, thank you all so much, I love you all, and I'll see you on the other side.
“Distinctive,” Tony whispers, “I’m hungry.”
, and it’s a vibration that Tony’s not expecting of and has his toes curling, and he can’t help but wish that he’d gotten his pants down past his mid-thigh because he wants to feel the perspiration Steve’s got building up on his shoulders on the back of his thighs, which he’s sure is bit on the disgusting side but can’t really give too much thought towards Steve’s just found his balls and
“Yes—Tony, no, do
“Heya, kiddo,” Tony hums.
Tony doesn’t want the apology. Sorry means nothing. What he wants is to keep Steve safe and he can’t do that if Steve refuses to leave him.
Clint, for his own part, seems to appear out of nowhere, which isn’t too entirely out of the usual as he and Natasha seem tend to take turns in the morning doing this, grabbing a jelly, Boston Crème and a Marble frosted before running to the couch. He shouts the word “cannonball,” before he lands atop the sleeping Peter, who’s jarred forcefully awake and, with a screech, tumbles to the ground, snapping Tony to attention. The engineer hits Clint upside the head, while Peter grumbles irritably before noticing that Clint’s in possession of doughnuts. Before long, Tony’s armed with the largest cup of coffee in possibly the entirety of New York and a jelly doughnut, the white powder from his previous doughnut dusting the edges of his freshly trimmed goatee, standing at the counter with Steve, who follows Bruce’s example as he munches on a plain doughnut.
wondering who took his parents from him!”
Peter’s not a bad kid, and he’s also not the kind of kid who actually really needs to be given such rules. But Steve gets this idea that Peter thinks it’s adorable that Tony places these rules without even a second thought, so he lets Tony believe he’s more in control than he actually is. Peter adores Tony like any son adores his dad, and if there’s been anything over the past few months that have continued to surprise him, it’s just how much Peter and Tony love each other. In the grand scheme of things, Steve’s more than aware that they haven’t even known each other that long—maybe the better part of a year?—but there’s no dispute that Peter is Tony’s son, and Tony, Peter’s dad. It’s quickly evident that there’s very little Tony’s not willing to do for Peter, even at the cost of his own life, because he’s determined to make sure that Peter has far better a life than he did.
Steve still looks awkward and uncertain as he says, “Tony,” but the man in question is more concerned with the lack of movement that the other gives in his direction, so he takes the lead, walking towards the statue-imitating Steve Rogers with determination in his stride, pulling the [over worn, hole-ridden, pit-stained, formerly white] t-shirt off over his head, tossing it carelessly to the side, greedily drinking in the look Steve gives him in response, which, despite the worry they still hold, speak of how he’s going to
share that it was a fucking
.” He sucks in a breath at that before continuing, even more painfully, “Or Peter.” He swallows audibly. “Someone has to stop them, Steve.”
Tony stares dumbly at him. “You were in there not even thirty full minutes ago,” he reminds him blandly, unable to come up with a less blunt way to say it, but it makes no sense—why would he
Tony’s greedy for Steve’s kisses, but he hadn’t a clue how ravenous he actually is for his mouth until he finds it wrapped around his cock, his breath catching in his throat with a traitorously high-pitched whine as Steve’s tongue presses against the underside of his cock, his overheated hand pressing down on Tony’s pelvis to keep him in place. Tony can’t help but let his head thrash from side to side, trying his best to reconcile the fact that it really is
“Tony—” Steve swallows, looking away now. “He needed to hear that.”
Peter gives a soft, humorless laugh. “Yeah, yeah. Sorry. But it’s true.”
Tony’s smiling right now, and Steve’s unable to tear his eyes away from the sight, ignoring the fact that Clint and Natasha are currently braiding Tony and Bruce’s hair, respectively, having a contest of sorts in their ability with hair, Clint delivering insults and taunts whilst Natasha remains cool under pressure, probably in an effort to keep Bruce’s head going aflame with the utter embarrassment that burns at the tips of his ears. Tony’s smile isn’t normal, which fits him because he’s far more than normal—his teeth look straight and aligned on the top, but the bottom is all crooked and is, frankly, screwed in comparison. They’re also a bit small, so his smile is mostly gums and lips, and each one looks so reservedly happy that Steve wants to strangle whomever made Tony believe he doesn’t deserve to be as happy as possible.
right at that moment, but still willingly answering, “We got drunk.”
“Do it and you’re paying the cleaning bill, Rogers, and trust me, I’m not one of them cheap broads.”
Tony’s got a handle on himself enough to say, after snapping a quick photo once assured enough that Steve’s being careful with the boy, “No one is playing Mario Kart with you, Petey, not until after you’ve done your homework.”
“Every time I think I know you’re a good person, Stark,” Steve grinds out, unable to withhold the utter

Tony whistles. “You’ve been swearing an awful lot today there, pal,” he says, pushing up so that he's sitting upright, waggling a finger in Steve’s direction with a smirk, “Makes me think that we let you hang out with Barton too much. The man’s a bad influence.”
The end of this tale. The resolution of one story, and the beginnings of another being introduced.
Peter’s quiet all throughout, and that in and of itself is heartbreaking, because he can almost hear what Peter’s thinking—he’s lost another parent. He’s been tossed aside, abandoned, left alone—he opened himself up to someone who, in the end, couldn’t stay. It’s a feeling that hurts Steve, because Tony never wanted to leave him—he just wanted to fight for the world he felt Peter should have. And it’s valiant. But he didn’t seem to realize that Peter desires nothing more than a world in which he has a family, and unknowingly, he’s stopped Peter from having just that.
“You should’ve told someone where you were going, you idiot,” he blubbers at him, literally
Steve can’t help but chuckle at Peter’s hopefulness. “It’s a bit more complex than that, Peter,” he tells the kid whose head rests in the crook of his neck, his eyes on the tablet screen as he reads through the latest news update just after he gets news that Tony’s been intercepted by Clint, and is currently being checked out with a local medical center in Florida, along with Rhodes and Pepper, whilst Killian’s operation is being dissolved.
AGHHHH I'M SO EXCITED OKOK BYE I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH PLEASE TELL ME IF THIS CHAPTER SUCKS
It’s said so simply that one might almost believe it to be the complete and honest truth.
It's been embarrassingly long since my last updates (about 10 days now) and I'm a bit ashamed because there's no real excuse for it. I'm sorry.
“Your dad and I are friends,” Steve says quickly, before he can consider Peter’s words too deeply, “Nothing more than friends.”
and his heart beg him to let it all
The tablet chimes before it displays that Tony’s responded, and with an eagerness he opens the message to see that Tony’s immediately jumped to the worst conclusion—that Peter’s dead and/or kidnapped and he’s probably going to hop into the suit that Steve knows full well that he’s brought with him despite hard orders from Pepper not to.
There’s a tension between them that’s almost aching in its intensity, and it feels like far too long before Tony sighs, rubbing the bridge of his nose as he looks down at his lap, mouth contorting into that grimace of a smile he had for when he felt something far too deeply for him to even be remotely able to express it. He’s entirely uneasy, and it’s damned near palpable.
Tony frowns, “I’ve never heard anyone tell me that and have it end positively, Rhodey. It’s got to be bad. I did something, I know it.”
“We look so pretty,” Tony croons over at Bruce. Bruce blushes, and Steve can’t help but smirk, beat-up blending stump between his fingers.
Tony’s spent a good percentage of his life comparing himself to the greatness of Steve Rogers, and he’s come to a decision that compared to Steve, he’s but a smear of shit on the wall. Steve’s a paragon of all that’s good and right in this world, whereas he’s just some fucking murderer with a debt to pay to society. When Steve was a kid, he was fighting bullies and standing up for what was right, whereas when he was a kid, he was learning how to kill a lot of people efficiently, and he could try to make up for all those lives he’s taken all of his life, but he knows that it’ll do little to change that he’s one of the worst. It makes him fit to protect others, he figures, having been a part of those who did bad and knowing, for the most part, how those on the side of evil operates, but no matter how many people he saves, he’ll never be able to make up for all those he’s stolen—and that’s just fact to him, not a belief; but his honest opinion about his own self-worth. He’s a bad guy trying to do good things, whereas Steve’s an honest-to-mythical-man-in-the-sky good guy
He’s aware he’s probably not doing the best thing for Tony right now. Tony needs not to shut things up again behind those walls and walls of protection like he’s so used to doing, but Steve’s too afraid to push him—too afraid to risk the chance that Tony could negatively respond to his pushing. So he doesn’t; he simply continues to make the sandwich, turned away from Tony, who now sits on the countertop behind Steve, staring down at his bare arms as if he’s never seen them before in his life. Steve doesn’t bring any attention to this, just like he doesn’t bring attention to the fact that his arms are covered in similar old scars.
He slams a hand against the table’s surface, and Steve can’t help the flinch, nor can he help the anger rising hot in his throat, because it’s becoming abundantly clear that, while Natasha’s seemed to give Clint a few of the details, she hasn’t given him the full story—probably to stay within the stipulations of the promise she’d made to Steve when they’d learned about what Hydra had made Bucky do—and it’s even clearer that, without these details, Clint can’t possibly understand what he’s asking of him. Protect Tony and Bucky—his love and his brother—or lose them both.
Tony’s quiet when Steve’s done, which is only worrying because he’s unused to the highly unfamiliar prospect of a quiet Tony, so Steve reluctantly lets him go, releasing his arms and moving back a good few feet to give the man space if he wants it. Tony stays still, slightly curled on himself, head down so Steve can’t see his face, his breath still heavy, but far less than before. Steve stares at the back of Tony’s neck before he sighs, getting to his feet. When he’s upright, JARVIS informs him that Bruce had come in about seven minutes ago, and awaits them on the communal floor with Clint, and Steve can’t help but smile, because Bruce must be all types of antsy, and so would Clint, and Clint’s type of antsy tends to get other people really annoyed, even the zen-like Bruce types. Steve knows he shouldn’t be amused, but all things considered, he just can’t help it. Any little thing is a peace right now.
Sometimes, though, it’s a blatant lie.

thing,” starts Rhodey, and Tony can tell from his tone that he’s building towards something. “Considering everything else you manage to toss out the window.”
No matter how surrounded he is, Tony is achingly aware of how alone he actually is. Frowning, he takes a sip from the bottle of scotch he happens to be carrying, the burn down his throat momentarily dulls the pain.
like there’s a problem--”
“M’kay,” Anthony says drowsily as his eyelids begin to grow heavy.
She takes one of his hands, red nails flashing briefly in the light, and lays her other hand on his back to rub circles. Her eyes are warm as they stare down at him. “The doctors and I spoke. You have what is called appendicitis, which means your appendix, an organ in your body, is the cause of your pain and they have to take it out.”
Doubt overtakes him, and he wants to scoff at the absurdity. It can’t possibly be true, that there was even such a thing as soulmates. But just as he finishes the traitorous thought, Johnson’s voice cuts through as he whispers
“If your soulmate never comes around--don’t give me that look, lemme finish,” Bucky said at the face Steve made. “Promise me that if she--or he--never shows, you’ll try to build a future with Peggy?”
He knows it’s selfish, especially when he thinks back on all the battles he’s been involved with as Captain America, watching as men younger than him were blown to bits right in front of him. Or when he’d liberated prisoners of war and saw with his own eyes men who were tortured and starved, or when he’s in the trenches and knows that there are soldiers who are having limbs amputated in medical tents all across Europe while he’s busy trying to bring down Hydra.
Aunt Peggy chuckles, her shoulders relaxing slightly. “It’s important they take it out, Tony,” she says as she continues rubbing his back.
as gorgeous and self-assured as you would already have a Mark,” he explained, self-consciously rubbing his blank skin.
Anthony blinks away, scrunching his eyebrows together. In all the comics he’s ever read, Cap never told anyone who he was; even the
Steve sighs heavily and gives up trying to nap. He opens his eyes and watches the scenery. After a few minutes, his eyes stray from the passing countryside and flick towards Jones and Dernier, who sit huddling together in the back of the truck. They’re speaking to each other quietly in French, Jones’s dark fingers tracing over Dernier’s maroon Mark. Dernier smiles contentedly at the contact and Steve has to look away. He’s not a prude, but it doesn’t make him feel any less embarrassed at catching them in such a private moment. It probably doesn’t help that he covets stolen moments between soulmates, and out here on the front collects them like a kid with marbles.
“You think you’re all done puking now?” asks his toilet-mate, with the barest hint of concern in his tone.
Steve didn’t bother to listen anymore after that.
“I never
At the touch, Horowitz lifts his head up from the blackened ground and looks into his companion’s face. During their conversation, Edwards has sidled closer, and is now only a few inches away from Horowitz’s face, head bent to better look into his friend’s eyes. Edwards gives Horowitz a reassuring smile, a well of warmth in his brown eyes as he murmurs something else only Horowitz can hear.
Steve looks away, leaving the two men to embrace each other in private.
After undressing and preparing for sleep, Steve climbed into bed, flinging the gray itchy blanket over his legs and laid his head down onto the flat pillow. He had finally found a position that could have been loosely called comfortable with his back to the door of the barracks. He was just closing his eyes, when the door banged open and the loud, obnoxious voices of the soldiers filled the room; their voices reverberating off the curved, concrete walls.

He turns his head and studies the room around him. It looks a lot different now that there are giant balloons and flowers filling up the small space and blocking the ugly paintings on the walls -
party,” he adds, his face twisting in disgust.
Tony doesn’t need the heart monitor to tell him that the organ in question took a swan dive into his stomach. He clenches his fingers around the itchy blanket draped across his lap.
“You’ll have it once you’re out,” Jarvis promises firmly from his Ana’s side.
Steve can’t help but wonder what his Ma would think of her son if she could see him now.
This is how a conversation with me goes.

“Steven Rogers, you
Anthony nods in understanding. Then a sharper pain hits him, and he shuts his eyes again, his hand squeezing hers. “Okay,” he allows weakly once the pain has passed. “Once they take it out,
He screws his eyes tight, trying to remember the good things about Bucky. He was as close to a soul mate as Steve had ever had in this life and it hurts so goddamned much that he’s
Rhodey arches a disbelieving eyebrow. “Since when do you care about social niceties?” he asks seriously.
Granny McDonald gave him a warm, reassuring smile. <A stór,> she said his nickname in Gaelic affectionately, “that just means your soulmate hasn’t been born yet. She’ll probably be much younger than you if a Mark hasn’t come by now.” She gave Sarah a smirk that he couldn’t grasp the meaning of.
Anthony shakes his head. “Howard won’t let me play with his toys,” he answers, forcing his hands down at his sides. “He says they’re not for me.”
“I promise I’ll call once I get back to school,” he’d said, his words echoing through his head.
Cap smiles warmly at him before looking up from Anthony’s face, his eyes widen in wonder and his mouth drops open slightly. Anthony knows it’s because of the toys because he feels exactly the same way whenever he sees them. Cap gets up, walking to the toy display that’s just behind Anthony. He steps aside, his eyes following Cap’s movement. His hero studies the case for a long time before he slides the glass door open with one of his red gloved hands.
His years of work paid off when he was accepted into art school, where he learned about the French impressionists, the Italian masters, not to mention discussing the rising popularity of Mexican artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, or debating which was the more impactful art movement: romanticism or cubism with some of his fellow classmates. It was from those artists that he began developing his own style. God, he had loved school. He spent hours in the library, poring over each of the art books, filling up sketchbooks with his own interpretations of famous works of art and the students who studied around him.
“Pegs,” he overhears Howard say, exasperation in his tone, “he thinks his soulmate is
Steve sits silently, turning Bucky’s last moments over again and again in his head; remembering the cold, and Bucky’s scream.
“Why not?” Steve asks.
“Sorry, ‘bout that - what’ver yer name ish. Whasername an’way?” he asks, blinking up at him.
“Agent Carter,” he had greeted. Usually seeing Peggy sent butterflies fluttering in his stomach, the very real possibility that he might make a fool of himself in her presence always made him uneasy. But at the time he was exhausted, and he just wanted to collapse onto his bed and be away from the world for a while.
Anthony drags his eyes away from his favorite toy, his own reflection catching his eye. He’s dressed different. Frowning, Anthony glances down at himself, and the smile on his face grows bigger until he’s grinning: he’s wearing his favorite pair of Captain America pajamas. All over the PJ’s are mini Caps running with an angry face that lets the bad guys
“I did
Bucky snorted. “Stevie, I’ve known you since we were nine years old. I think I’ve got a pretty good read on you by now.”
He hasn’t been able to sleep since the ride back to London.
“Yes it is,” Jarvis agrees with a nod of his head.
“You just get some rest,” he murmurs as he continues to walk, rubbing Anthony’s back soothingly like Ana does sometimes. Like his aunt did earlier.
Cap chuckles at him, his smile ticking up in one corner of his mouth, and Anthony gives him a soft smile in return. He feels as big as an air balloon -
“I just thought that a da--a

There’s no time to waste after the conference ends; the Commandos immediately exit the room, going to gear up and ship out. Steve’s just preparing to follow when Peggy stops him in his tracks.
at him. Rhodey throws his hands in the air and starts pacing the large hospital room, taking on the characteristics of a caged lion.
Tony feels like he’s been electrocuted, he’s so startled. But at the same time the fact that the dream - no,
“I don’t care. Get
Before he was nine, he hadn’t known anyone else who was Markless until Bucky had helped him out in their first fight. Steve doesn’t even remember what it had been about anymore, but they’d managed to drive the bullies off, until it was just him and Bucky alone in the alley. Bucky had looked down at Steve and smiled a bloody grin. Then he stretched out his left hand to help Steve up, and Steve was startled to see a wrist that was just as blank as his own. They’d been best friends ever since.
He wonders most of all what they’d have to say about his Markless wrist.
After his parents are buried in the cold ground, there's an endless stream of parties. It’s all a blur of alcohol, dancing, and a parade of hot women and men, some with Marks, some without, that enter his bedroom. The next morning either he kicks them out, or they leave only to go to the tabloids - not that he cares, he doesn’t have it in him to care. There are bottles of alcohol littered around the house that servants whose names he doesn’t bother to remember clean up the next day.
There’s a small noise on the other line that sounds like a labored breath.
He turns around and takes in Howard’s Captain America room. Even though he knows that he’ll get in trouble for being in his father’s room, the familiarity of it soothes him. Spending all that time in the hospital had been scary and exhausting, and it’s so nice being in a space without bright blinding lights in his eyes, or nosy doctors poking him and asking him a bajillion dumb questions, or dressed in any itchy hospital gowns.
A sad sort of silence hung over Steve’s bedroom before Granny McDonald spoke.
Two pools of blue flash through his mind, cutting him off.
(It’s not as good as his favorite one in Howard's Captain America room
Anthony can’t help the satisfaction he feels, but it’s brushed away quickly. Anthony has a message to give to Howard. “He said ‘not to fondue around’,” he repeats, scrunching his nose in concentration to remember Steve's exact words.
Steve’s eyes catch on one of the soldiers as they approach--Horowitz, Steve thinks absently. He and his companion, Edwards, are beside one of the more ruined buildings; the entire place is nothing but blackened ash and collapsed plaster, a door the only thing left standing. They’re quietly conversing--about what, Steve can’t be sure. Horowitz turns to Edwards, his shoulders beginning to shake. Steve’s ears pick up sniffles.
who's just seen a ghost.
Steve can almost hear the heavy challenging sigh she would take, which had always been a clear indication that he was about to receive the lecture of a lifetime. He holds his breath in anticipation.
He stares at the balloon as it sways slightly, and continues to watch as it turns around, until Anthony catches sight of curly white words wrapped around it. ‘It’s Your Birthday!’ it reads. He tears his eyes away from the balloon, until he notices the striped beige wallpaper behind it. Anthony squints at it, the niggling in the back of his brain telling him that he’s
But despite all this, sometimes late at night and in his darkest moments, Steve isn’t sure his soulmate will ever come. He’s one part terrified that he’ll be ninety before any swatch of color appears on his wrist, or worse that a swatch of bright color will appear, but in a matter of seconds will fade to gray without him ever knowing their name; because he’s heard stories of that happening where a soulmate will die at childbirth. He isn’t sure which prospect is worst; both seem equally terrifying. So when he’s alone in his tent at night, he’ll take off his band, lie in bed, close his eyes and run his fingers over his wrist, and all the while pretend it’s someone else who’s stroking his wrist. Then in the morning he’ll put his band on, push all the doubts and fears he has for his soulmate to the back of his mind, and be Captain America for another day.
Carter?”
“This was their only comfort,” Steve said simply, gesturing at the wreckage that remained.
Steve turns the envelope over in his hand, and his breath catches in his throat at the return address marked
“Did you respect him?” She stares at him head-on, her eyes challenging. He doesn’t deign that with a response.
“Jarvis, can a Mark be on a person’s right wrist?” he asks, releasing the butler’s arm and starts swaying his already dangling feet.
At night it was hard to experiment with his body while living in a crowded house, but whenever he had a moment to himself, Steve closed his eyes and tried to conjure bright red lips and curves that went on for days. But the red lipstick would smear away and become mustaches, and the curves would harden, and the outline of cocks would appear in trousers. Instead of painted nails attached to delicate and soft hands, images of calloused fingers and hands bigger than his own pushed their way into his head of their own accord.
He’d brushed his lips against her pale cheek, but before he could pull completely away, Ana’s hand snapped up and gripped his chin tightly; revealing a surprising amount of strength for the older woman. He’d been taken aback by the spark of ferocity in her green eyes despite the situation, and he couldn’t tear his gaze away from hers. And in that moment, it was like a day hadn’t gone by.
“Someone's here to see you,” Ana says, drawing Anthony’s attention. Her whitening orange hair in its usual pinned up Victory curls, but there are more than a few fluffy tendrils dangling undone. She gives him a soft smile.
“Good night, Tony,” says Steve before the darkness engulfs him.
“Mr. Stark?” the doctor asks, and Tony looks up from his musings. She’s got an eyebrow raised, watching him expectantly. “Did you remember something?”
Shocked, his head snaps up at the building. He can see right into the inside of the pub. The entrance to the bar has been completely blown away; it looks like it exploded from the inside out. There’s pieces of the ceiling on the ground, long planks of wood dropped haphazardly onto piles of brick and rubble, broken glass from the windows strewn all over the street.
that the other side is red, white, and blue with a white star in the center.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” he admits with a sigh.
“Unlike other children his age, Anthony has given his hero a name. He seems quite fond of using ‘Steve’ as a substitute, and to be quite honest, I’m having trouble understanding where that manifests from. Are there personal ties to that particular name?”
of his aunt’s shoes, his eyes snap open to see her standing in the doorway, her red lips pulled down into a small frown.
“I didn’t overdose on purpose!” Tony shouts, hands coming up defensively. “Give me a little more credit than
It was Steve’s duty not only as Bucky’s superior officer, but as his friend and brother to write to Winifred Barnes, who was practically another mother to him, and break the news to her that her son had died for his country. Even though he sent the letter days ago, Steve doesn’t remember what he wrote; he was numb the entire time and had written it almost mechanically. By the time the letter was handed off and on its way, Steve sat back in the rickety wooden chair at his desk, the whole thing leaving a horrible taste in his mouth, and he knew it wasn’t because of the glue used to seal the envelope.
It’s just as he’s allowing himself to relax that a creeping feeling comes over Anthony. It’s like a spider slowly walking up the back of his neck. His skin gets prickly, breaking out into goosebumps all along his arms underneath his pajama sleeves. He clutches his hands together and glances down at his toes. He’s being watched.
a Swatch,” Tony cuts him off with a frustrated growl. “Or a
“There you go,” says a deep soothing voice, and there’s a pressure on his side. A hand rubs around and over his back in circular motions as Tony continues to vomit. “Let it all out, tough guy.”
“Steve,” Anthony answers calmly, his fingers gripping the blanket of his bed, eyes staring at Aunt Peggy, confused as to why they’re acting weird. “Captain America told me.”
of, all he can see is hues of gray and black. Above him the sky is gray with swirled smudges of black as dark as charcoal. Steve isn’t sure if the clouds are actually gray with threats of rain, or if it’s because of the fire that he and the Commandos hadn’t arrived in time to stop. The grass at his feet is burned away and covered in ash, turning it black and dull. Even the Commandos, in their camouflage clothes, match the bleak scenery in their faded and worn appearance.
disappoint him.”
“In the vision, the man was in a field of some distant land she did not recognize. She knew that the vision was of the life after, for this man in front of her was at least ten years younger, and there was a young woman with him in the field with wild hair the color of honey and eyes the color of the sky. When Joanna told the man of what she’d seen, he’d burst into tears. The woman in her vision, the man explained, was his wife who had died long ago. When Joanna removed her hands from his wrists, a gray spot appeared on his left wrist.
He scoffs as he sets it down. “Then you know that’s not true.”
laugh! They take a couple of steps together, when suddenly the excitement that had filled Anthony is zapped from him, leaving him feeling exhausted. He yawns big and loud, and covers his wide mouth with a hand.
“Besides,” Tony says after a while, his voice raspy with disuse, “if I
are accepting
He feels...happy.
Instead of saying so, or snorting in derision, he says instead, “I’m going after Schmidt.” His voice brooking no argument. “I’m not gonna stop until all of Hydra is dead or captured.” He thinks it gets all the things he wants to say across to Peggy loud and clear.
on the operating table when he doesn’t believe it himself?
It’s the magnitude of bodies that convinces Tony he needs to step away, be by himself for a while to cool off; he’s feeling so hot and sweaty all of a sudden. As he makes his way down the hall, he takes sips at the big bottle of scotch; relishing the burn down his throat while he passes by people grinding against the wall and making out with each other.
“Because I never expected you to
Anthony’s mouth drops open, his breath catching in his throat, and his heart feels like it just dove off a diving board and did a cannonball into his stomach. His hands sweat as they clench to the shirt of his pajamas, and his toes curl tight, but he hardly cares: Captain America stands tall and big, and only a few feet away from him.
He blinks, looking around at his room in confusion, wondering why he’s awake before the pressure gets worse and he realizes that he has to pee.
“There’s no problem, Buck, I never said there was a--”
One doctor with big eyes and a freckle by their left eyebrow puts a mask over Anthony’s nose and mouth, telling him to count down from ten. Before he even reaches five, he’s fast asleep.
Steve laughed outright. “I think they’d have been more impressed by her character,” he said. They would have definitely bemoaned the fact that the fierce tenacity in Peggy was displayed in an English rather than an Irish girl, but there wasn’t a doubt in Steve’s mind that the two most important women in Steve’s world would have liked Peggy Carter regardless of her country of origin. “She’d have set ‘em straight.”
But a week has passed and he still hasn’t shed a tear.
She lays a hand over his, making a lukewarm feeling spike through his Mark. “You won’t be alone,” she says with conviction.
, Rhodes!”
, he thinks bitterly before his entire digestive system decides to try and exit through his mouth.
Anthony squirms at the praise and beams, his grin back on his face.
. It’s touching, really, that all these people would offer their best wishes and prayers to Steve, but...
The path following the front felt like an endless road of destruction, made up of shattered town after shattered town--the smoking bones of people’s lives. They were often the first to come upon the wreckage, and that meant that sometimes the task of burying the dead was left to Steve and his team. That was probably the hardest thing to do. Gabe was the better speaker out of all of them; his father had been a preacher, and no one was more capable of delivering a eulogy or prayer than Gabe. Once the graves had been dug, and the remains buried, Gabe would say a few words, and they would move on to the next broken town on their road of ruin.
” Erik announced, hovering above Tony and Sherlock. “They create suits to be like you, and the world cheers. Yet you were born with these gifts, these powers, and they would rather muzzle you!

Sherlock laughed weakly, looking around at the crowd again. “You don’t know Logan if you think that,”

was, still pregnant by that very same idiot. He had known a few weeks before Lagos, before this whole mess but he had said nothing. After so much time, however, he was certain Logan would also question his hesitance. Why breech the subject when he still hadn’t an explanation?
“The matter was well in hand, Anthony; I was hardly going to kill myself--”
Steve? Before Lagos? Before the airport? What if he had just come out and said it, would this have gone differently? Maybe. But then it would have gone differently because Steve would have felt bad for the damn fetus and it still would have nothing to do with Tony.
Steve’s hands on him, the way they pushed his blazer off his shoulders, untucked his shirt and drew warm hands across his skin… Tony placed his own hand on his chest, feeling the ghost of Steve’s touch as he watched them. Lips caught together, clothes pushed away, dropped to the side until Tony scrambled for his jacket again to clumsily grab the packet of lube and hand it to Steve with an almost nervous smile.
“So, you’re
Funny, he trusted him enough not to respond to him breaking everyone out jail.
like him.
, he thought dryly, turning his head to rest his forehead against the tile. The door to the master bathroom opened and Tony barely had the energy to roll his head back the other way to see who it was. Not like there were many options. Pepper had left after Tony had admitted to his one night affair; Vision stayed at the compound to wait for Wanda to come back; Friday would have announced Rhodes’ presence. His brother stood there, his ex-partners shirt hanging limply from his frame. A second Stark child must have been too much for their parents, Tony didn’t sit around and try to understand their reasoning, but the fact of the matter was Sherlock had been sent to London and adopted by a mildly wealthy family. After observing the plentiful news resources regarding Tony and the Avengers, Sherlock’s uncanny likeness to the billionaire couldn’t be ignored. So there he was, and Tony was in no state to turn people- to turn
“Art, Tony.” Steve cut him off, dropping a little black sketchbook in Tony’s lap. “That’s what I use.”
Circling around, the present Tony moved to the other side of the bed so he could see over his own shoulder, wanting to see the pictures again. Waiting rather impatiently until his memory self found the exact thing he wanted to see again. A drawing of himself, towel hung low enough on his hips that dark curls and the base of a slightly erect cock could be seen. Both Tonys blushed, and the one on the bed snapped the book shut before both sets of eyes were on Rogers. Of course the man was avoiding Tony as he grabbed a fresh towel from the closet and moved towards the door.
. Your
- than to fall into this trap. To roll over so soon and say ‘You’re right cap, I was wrong’. Because at the end of the day, Steve had made his choice. And it wasn’t him. So why would Tony turn around and crawl back to a man who clearly didn’t want him. Not when he had his Bu-. Fingers pinched the bridge of his nose before he rubbed his eyes and aggravated the bruise there just to feel something; to shock himself out of another flash back he didn’t want to think about. He should send the phone back. A quick look at the box and he realized there was no return address. Yeah. Steve still didn’t trust him not to run and turn him in.
When the kiss broke, Tony stood across from the two of them, breath caught in his throat. He knew what happened next, but he was living in the moment again, taken with Steve as he so often was in their moments alone. His memory broke the silence, but tripled the tension as those words reentered the air, but this time they were vulnerable, pleading.
“Coffee.” Tony’s voice broke him from his thoughts and Sherlock glanced over his shoulder, thankful for the distraction. The older brother wrinkled his nose as the scent of eggs and whatever Sherlock had put in them hit him. “Tryin’ ta make me sick again? What the hell did you use?”
That granted him a small huff, some of the tension dispelling between them, but Sherlock knew it did little to help Tony. “Got a whole fucking lists of reasons
“You’re short staffed and I’d lose my mind sitting here all day. I want to help.” Sherlock pressed, shifting his chair to lean closer. “Anthony, please. You can’t handle twice the load right now, you’ve a lot to consider, but let me help. I can learn the suit this weekend; I’ll make my bloody own--”
It was the first night since the child was conceived, he didn’t dream.
Just as the mutants closed in, he was pulled up, another dissembled bit of barricade closing around the throat of his suit and tightening as he was hung in the air by his hands and legs. Watson commented on the pressure building, the suits hull and shield quickly falling, which did nothing to ease Sherlock’s growing fear. Beside him, Tony was held up beside them, showing their contained suits strung up in vulnerable positions. Like targets. They were being hung like targets.
Pocketing the phone, he jogged to the stairs, moving down to the workshop and waving his hand to clear the smoke that billowed out of the open doors. Vision was already inside, handing a mask to Sherlock so he didn’t asphyxiate. “Sherlock!
This was a new low, even for him.
from you. You are superior to them in every way. Do not let their fear control you! Do not let them silence you! If they wish to fear you on principle, show them what they should really fear.”
“I don’t know…”
The meeting had almost gone smoothly, all panic induced revelations aside. But Ross cleared his throat and held his hand out to stop Tony in his tracks. “Wait, wait. In Siberia. Are you
There was a muffled ‘thoom’ accompanied by a shudder that rumbled through the entire compound and Tony stood, hand grasping the phone tightly. “Friday?”
to come near him or this baby. His choice, in that moment, boiled down to two dangerous extremes. He could terminate the pregnancy, just to spite the blue eyes fucker. Or he could carry it to term and have the kid without allowing Steve anywhere near it. Which one would hurt him more?
“Let me fly the suit.”
“I’m not letting you do this alone, Anthony. Whatever you endure, I will as well.”
“Know

“I had a fucking shield in my chest, you really think he was going to stop and hand me his goddamn itinerary?”
“I don’t know, but I can’t risk him leaving the safety of the mansion. Even for this. We can’t contact them.”

“Diagnostics. I might have… Miscalculated somewhere.” Sherlock appeared far from bothered by the fact he had caused an explosion that could have easily hurt him. He laughed, hands resting on his hips as he looked towards Tony through his gas mask. “Still used to the imperial system, I suppose. How are you?”
She’d had an early shift at the hospital in the morning and Steve could tell his Ma was exhausted, but she sat up with him anyway despite how hard he tried not to disturb her. She had laid beside him in bed, taken him up into her arms, and told him the story.
“Mr. Stark?” the doctor asks, and Tony’s eyes snap to meet hers. Her silver clipboard’s lowered, revealing her face. Her forehead is pinched in concern, and her almond-shaped eyes flit over him, like she’s trying to spot anything else that might be wrong with him. “Are you alright?”
“I don’t want you to go yet,” he tells her frankly. She blinks at him, her eyes wide. Anthony hastily tries to make his case. “You just got here, an’ I don’t get to see you anymore, an’ I
Steve huffs at how naive he had been.
Cap lowers the shield to the ground, leaning it gingerly against the hutch, and steps slowly towards Anthony until he’s looming over him. He crouches down until he’s on one knee, at eye-level in front of him.
“However,” continues the doctor. “I don’t know of any other child who gives a
the person who shared their Mark. They had a name and a face and a
The doctor nods, a few strands of her dark hair pulling free of her ponytail as she writes down his response on her silver clipboard. Tony resists the urge to squirm.
Steve had felt relief rush through him, like a balm to an old wound and he sagged with the feeling of it. After a while, he smirked at Bucky. “And here I thought you’d desert me,” he said. He was serious and joking all at once.
Tony blinks in confusion, taken aback.
“I’m really not bothered,” Bucky said seriously once a comfortable silence settled over them. “I don’t care if you like dames, or guys, or if neither of ‘em float your boat. You’re like a brother to me, Stevie, and I love you. I’m with you till the end of the line.”
“I’ll be right back, darling,” she assures, kissing his forehead quickly before she follows the doctor out.
“So you and Ana are soulmates too?” Anthony asks, and Jarvis nods, smiling wider.
She sounds so
or my wonderful new cheerleaders in the Stony discord - thanks guys!
There’s a rough grip on both his arms, strong enough that it hurts. “Come on, Tony,” says the man forcefully. “Up you get.” And he’s lurched upwards until he’s sitting up, his head lolling forwards with the movement.
“That bleeding soulmate story is true,” Johnson whispered quietly as his face was smoothed of the wrinkles of discontent he’d had before.
He gets out of bed quickly, throwing the covers aside before landing on the hardwood of the floor, and quietly opens the door to his room. He wanders down the dark corridor, and goes towards the bathroom where he does his business.
Johnson smiled like he knew a coveted secret. “You don’t know my Freddie,” he said, his voice slurring as he was pulled down into sleep. “He was ne’er one fer waitin’.”
“That was how Ana and I found each other,” Jarvis replies. “Our Marks matched.”
” she starts, her voice soothing like the lullabies she sometimes sings in Italian to him, “when he was Captain America, no one knew he was - because during the war, he was a superhero, and superheroes don’t tell anyone who they are. They keep their identities a secret, don’t they, my dove?”
to talk to him - ”
But then Aunt Peggy’s hand lays gently on Anthony’s forehead, he feels the coolness of her wedding ring pressing against his skin, and her delight is instantly replaced with an expression of worry. “Tony, you’re burning up!” She cries, eyebrows furrowing. “Are you alright?”
“Which means, um. I can’t get drunk.” The silence rings out around them for a moment. “Did you know that?” he asks, turning his head to glance at her.
Anthony avoids the creaky floorboards under the rug as quietly as he can, and tiptoes closer to the heavy door to Howard’s study. He leans his head against one of the wood panels and listens.
Long before he had been put onto the battlefield, and met others like himself, Steve thought he was the only one without a Mark.
Anthony clutches his toy tighter. He doesn’t want to - he
Peggy paused, took a deep breath and closed her eyes. “I get lonely just like anyone else, yes,” she said softly. When she opened her eyes, that flame of ferocity glowed bright. “But people who share Marks don’t always equate happiness, Steve. I can’t rely on a dot to be my fairy godmother who will magically appear and solve all my problems with a wave of her wand; life doesn’t work that way.”
“What did you call it?”
She’s dressed in a brown coat, looking elegant and colorful in comparison to the black grittiness around them. Just as the English are known for their stiff upper lip, Peggy’s standing straight and tall: red lipstick applied, balanced in her heels, and dark hair perfectly coiffed. The only thing to belie her strong demeanor is the sadness in her brown eyes she allows him to see.
He lifts his head and stares blankly at her; what a question to ask. But Peggy’s tone had changed. It isn’t patient or gentle anymore, but it’s like steel. It sounds more like her: determined and resilient.
But he could hardly blame them their disappointment. After all, a guy can only take so many 4Fs before it began to make him feel desperate for a chance. He would have gotten a kick out of their reactions, though: super soldier wandering around Europe with a team of the best men he knew, chasing after Hydra. It sounds like the kind of science fiction he’d read as a kid; something straight out of
lie. “It’s not like that,” he tells Tony flat-out, something like disgust in his voice.
Tony’s forehead wrinkles in confusion. “No?” he asks more than says.

noise as he continued whittling. “Yeah, she’s quite a gal.” He agreed.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Rhodey grumbles. “You have standards - you like your girls with a little bit of brains.”
Steve stares at the mess around him.
what she’s capable of. She has delicately curled, greying brown hair that ends just at her shoulders, and wrapped in a burgundy pantsuit with a large teal blue suitcase in her hand.
Peggy reached a hand out and laid it gently over his wrist. Steve could swear he felt tingles run up his arm at the contact. He lifted his gaze and met her golden brown eyes.
This time, a bright, brilliant blue is what he imagines his Mark to be.
It’s not like he saw a lot of these kinds of moments where he grew up, anyway, in a place where a shared Mark between two people of the same sex is extremely taboo. To some people, a shared Mark means a shared bed. The only way same-sex soulmates can possibly get away with their Mark is by dismissively saying that it’s because they’ve been best friends all their lives, which in some cases is true: there
“Only socially,” Tony says without the usual smirk, the age-old quip familiar and spilling off his tongue easily. The joke falls flat as the doctor doesn’t glance up.
hangs in the air, unsaid.
Steve lifts a hand, placing it on top of Bucky’s and gives it an answering squeeze. The thought is only a small consolation; they both know that it won’t be the last ruined church that they will march past that day.
The doctor turns back to Tony, and picks her clipboard back up. “Now,” she says with a sigh. “I have a few questions left that I hope you won’t mind me asking. They’re just routine, and you don’t have to answer if you don’t want to, or if they feel invasive.”
It’s not one of his finest moments.
He curls up into a ball, facing the door of the hospital room as he waits. He scrunches his eyes shut tight, trying to block out the awful pain in his tummy. It feels like it has quadrupled during the examination. He focuses on taking even breaths: in through his nose, and out through his mouth. When he hears the familiar
Aunt Peggy smiles, red lips soft. “Yes, Tony. After your surgery, we’ll have your party.”
echoes a low voice in his ears.
“Of course.”
(See the end of the chapter for
There is pain in her voice, and Steve wishes more than anything he could be by her side and comfort her. But he has a job to do.
He couldn’t care less.
“But God, I could smell him again,” Johnson whispered, a watery smile on his face and his eyes still closed, imagining his soulmate in front of him. “It was like he rolled around in freshly cut grass; the smell just clung to him. His kisses always tasted like lemonade--”
a future.
“You know you can always talk to me about anything, right?” he asks gently, and Tony feels like that stupid kid puking his brains out at that frat party all over again.
“You did everything you could.” She says patiently.
“Wake up!”
Anthony blinks out of his stupor and finally meets Jarvis’s eyes. He’s staring down at him, relaxed and waiting with a small smile.
Anthony steps over to the display case until he’s standing right in front of it, careful not to press against the clean glass. He knows where to look, up and up and up until he spots a familiar toy. The toy puts a smile on his face when nothing else in the room could, and makes his insides warm with a surge of happiness. It’s Captain America standing with a set to his jaw, and his eyes staring off in the distance, looking ready for a fight. Both of his arms are pointed inwards, with his shield strapped to his left one. On his back is a button that makes the magnet connecting the shield to his arm disconnect and twists Cap’s waist at the same time, momentum of the movement allowing the toy to throw the shield.
“And guys too,” he acquises. “Besides, you know there are platonic soulmates, right?”
The sunset has been ripped from Steve’s vision as the snowbank approaches fast. There’s nothing but unforgiving white in front of him. As the icy air whips around him, filling the inside of the plane with bitter frostiness, a small flame of hope warms his insides. He hopes his soulmate will forgive him for leaving early.
. Steve couldn’t lie to himself: he was queer. He
Then there was the fact that Bucky went on dates with dames who were Markless too.
Steve looks around the room, at the sleeping forms of soldiers lying in their beds. He envies them their peaceful slumber. His nightmares have been plaguing him for days, tainting any wink of sleep he’s been trying to get.
A funny tingling wriggles around in the back of Anthony’s brain, like it's trying to remember something. But he still feels a little foggy, and he can’t do much else but stare at the man in front of him while his brain tries to figure it out.
It doesn’t bother him, and out there on the front lines, it hardly matters what two soulmates do if no one’s around to pay attention.
Take it up with my attorneys if you have a problem.
“Joanna travelled the country, sharing her visions with others, revealing spots on all who gathered to hear her and explained what they meant. She said that God had given everyone a Mark and that was what the spot on their wrists were. But it was a special mark--a mark that we could use to find our soulmate--”
have known about it without Steve telling him - ”
,” Cap says - he forgot! - smiling. He reaches a gloved hand out and ruffles Anthony’s hair, making his heart do a funny dance against his ribs. “You’re a sharp kid, Anthony.”
Sure, he’s had hugs from Rhodey before, but those were mostly bro-hugs: made up of back pats, and three seconds of arms wrapped around each other. But this - this one is different. Yet, it feels oddly familiar after a half-second of contact, and Tony isn’t sure why.
from the broken glass of the plane’s windshield is lovely to Steve.
“ ‘Some people won’t have a chance to meet their soulmate in this lifetime,’ Joanna had said. ‘And when that happens, God puts them in a special place for us until we die. Once we die, we go to the happiest place we’ve ever been in our lives, and there they’ll be: waiting for us.’ Because of her visions, they called her Joanna of the Mark. And when she died, she became--”
The memory sneaks up on Steve, slowly drawing him close and he sinks into it willingly; like laying back onto a comfortably well-worn chair after a hard day. It’s like he’s back to that night; watching himself weave through the group of soldiers and dancers, and going to stand at Bucky’s side.
Steve sits there quietly, allowing fragments of memories to filter through his mind, like he’s turning pages in a photo album, turning them this way and that to be examined. Not feeling one way or another about them.
you.”
“Like Momma and Howard?”
“Anything, Buck,” Steve said immediately.
Cap chuckles as he drops Anthony’s hand. He bends down, gently lifts Anthony by his armpits and pulls him up into his big arms. Even though Anthony knows how strong he is, Cap cradles him gently; like something he doesn’t want to lose.
His one consolation is that he isn’t alone anymore.
After consuming his soup, he’d been able to sleep peacefully that night. But after that night, he’d always beg for Granny McDonald or his Ma to tell him the story of Joanna again, and he’d rub his wrist, eager to see what shade his Mark would turn out to be.
“Being alone,” Tony grips the blanket tightly between his hands. Then he speaks quietly, acutely aware of how late it is. “I don’t...I don’t like to be alone, and everybody left. My parents, Aunt Pegs, you, Jarvis and Ana. I didn’t
Steve’s head whipped around so fast, his neck should have snapped. Bucky’s smirk and shining blue eyes met his confused expression. “Y-you do?” Steve asked instead, and Bucky nodded. “How--” he had taken a huge gulp of air while speaking, and nearly choked on his words. He paused to clear his throat, then tried again. “How did you know?”

Almost immediately after he hangs up on Obie, Tony organizes a party that takes up the entire week leading up to his parents’ funeral.
“I’m more disgusted by the fact that

“Nah, you would’a tried a long time ago if that were the case,” Bucky grinned. Steve let out a laugh.
,” she explains and Anthony frowns, but nods in understanding.
He knows she would have been absolutely floored by his transformation, except that she would have hated the repeated lying he’d done in order to try to get into the army to prove himself, and the risk he’d taken for his new body. At the same time, he wonders what Granny McDonald would think about this. She’d probably swear at him in Gaelic and smack him upside his head.
“I will personally see to it that she gets your message, Steve,” Peggy vows soberly, her voice as resilient as ever. “What else can I do?” she asks.
“Oh, you mean my Mark,” he says, meeting the four year old’s big brown eyes.
It’s almost like being colorblind again, back when his world dreary and bleak. When he had emerged from the pod after Project Rebirth had been successful, in between his deep lungfuls of air--something that he only did when he had an asthma attack--he was astonished by the amount of
Steve heaves a heavy sigh and lifts a gloved hand to rub the bridge of his nose.
Once again, Tony’s glad he has friends that come in different flavors and expensive bottles:
“I did mope,” Steve admits to the quiet pub, as he fills up his glass again.
Time is a strange thing when a person’s grieving; it just doesn’t pass the same way like it did--before. Everything seems to slow down, and pass a person by all at once that it’s been easy for him to lose track of how many hours he’s lain awake at night until the sun’s coming up, or he hears the bells signalling everyone to get up and start another day. Steve’s been feeling like he’s standing away from life, feeling so disconnected with the rest of the world that it’s as though he’s watching a newsreel about a foreign country; he can hardly care.
Steve’s always had trouble imagining heaven, despite the sermons and depictions of cloud-wreathed angels he’s seen over the years. He doesn’t have any doubts about this, though; hell is on earth, it’s in the trenches, and it’s all around him.
The sun shines through the stained glass window of his bedroom, sending bright bursts of blues and pinks and yellows onto the hardwood floor. Birds are singing, and from that same window he can see the clear blue sky peeking through the clear unpainted glass. He rises slowly, feeling a little groggy, and tired, but most of all hot, almost like he’s sick. There’s also a pain in his tummy that makes him whine softly, clutching one of the larger pillows on his bed tightly to his stomach, curling into his knees and tucking his toes in tight.
Granny McDonald gave him a warm, reassuring smile. “That just means your soulmate hasn’t been born yet."
He turns away.
He had been stunned to see a wrist as bare as the one that greets him every day. He stared at her, and she smiled softly.
He wants to tell Rhodey, he really does. The last person he’d had conversations concerning his Mark with had been Jarvis - a slice of agonizing grief cuts through Tony at the thought of his deceased butler/father figure, but just as quick is gone again - in addition to the therapist his parents sent him to as a kid, and he could use another person to support him.
films, which he has to admit aren’t too bad, though he feels like he’s kind of missing something at the beginning of
“Is that really enough, Steve?” he quietly asks.
Steve doesn’t look up, but he knows Tony’s grinning based off the way he says, “Still Doctor Stark, though.”
Tony is quiet for a moment before he gives a small laugh, which is more parts relieved than it is amused. “That’s amendable of you, Steve.”
, even in his panic, but as soon as those thoughts rise up he pushes them right back down. He instead focuses again on Peter, who’s laughing up a storm, kicking his feet in a dramatic display of how high up he’s being lifted, which isn’t very far at all because Peter has to bend his knees to keep from kicking the coffee table; his cheeks burning bright red, chanting about the pizza that Tony’s apparently ordered.
Tony shakes his head. “Peter’s just a kid,” he whispers. It’s a burden he just doesn’t want Peter to have.
Steve trembles under the weight of the praise, making the idea of a praise kink all the more real as he jerks his hips in time with Tony’s, mumbling damn near unintelligible words of sheer adoration for Tony as he’s fucked. Tony sucks harshly at Steve’s shoulder, knowing he’s none too far away from losing it and wanting to mark him before he does, fully aware that the mark would be gone far before his own disappear. He manages to leave a reasonably sized, and easy enough to hide, hickey before he loses it, biting
2/27/17: I was just responding to a review and I'd like you all to read it to clear up any misunderstandings you've had in the case of Steve's character. The comment made is not important; I would like simply to read the response, which is as follows (essentially):
, Tony’s not his, nor will Tony ever
“So why now? Why’re you bringing it up today?” Steve asks, forcing down the idea of celibacy, picking up the remote and pausing
Steve refused to let S.I. use Peter as a speaker. It’s still not public knowledge that Peter and Tony are father and son, and Steve has no plans on changing that. The world doesn’t need to know that Peter exists, and he doesn’t want it to. Peter is being placed beside one of the stockholders who have more than their fair share of grandsons; the press will just assume he’s one of them, and the only reason Steve’s allowed this much is because Peter’s begged to be there. He doesn’t want Steve too far away, and Steve feels similarly about Peter, which is why Steve was even amendable enough to allow Peter to talk him into this. So Steve smiles reassuringly at Peter, who gives a smile back and allows the aggressive woman to finish up, whilst Steve fingers the edges of the shield. He’s not wearing the full uniform—he’s gone for a polo, dress pants and dress shoes—but he’s got the shield in hand, too. The PR people want the public to see him as personable, but they also want them to be reminded who he is. It’ll carry more weight, they tell him.
He has to beg Steve to stop, only because he’ll be damned if he’s going to let Steve forget about his own want, which Tony is almost worried is one-sided until he sees the outline of his cock pressing against the fabric of his pants, Steve’s legs shaky and unsteady with sudden trepidation, reminding Tony that the man is pretty damn close to virginal, in the grand scheme of things, especially in the realm of gay sex, according to him, so when Tony says,
It’s, admittedly, awkward for the first few hours. Anytime Steve opens his mouth, Peter shuts him right back down, because he’s just not yet ready to hear the bullshit explanation that Steve could possibly have for avoiding him, and Steve knows it even though Peter doesn’t say it that way. Peter might look relaxed, but Steve knew better—the kid is
Steve doesn’t comment. It’s not his place to. Instead, he carefully draws Peter into his arms, taking him to his own bedroom and tucking him in for the night. Peter fusses for a moment, but the moment he grabs onto one of Steve’s pillows and tucks it under his nose, he’s for the most part contented. Steve carefully slides his glasses off of his face and places them on his nightstand, right on the edge where the boy usually leaves them, so he can find them early in the morning, and he gently pats Peter’s hand once before he leaves the room, closing the door most of the way behind him.
Steve laughs, lifting up his arm so that Peter’s eye-level with him (an ability that he still finds himself surprised in his ability to do; he is really still used to the idea that the heaviest he was ever going to be lifting, ever, was a sheet of paper to attach to the easel), making the boy laugh as he swung him, gently, from side to side. Peter’s grip is good, so he’s not even looking like he’s afraid of the idea of falling; in fact, it looks like he’s enjoying this far more than a boy of twelve should be—shouldn’t he be off brooding?—whereas Tony looks like he’s half a step away from having a heart attack despite that Peter’s not even high enough off the ground to sprain himself, should he fall, eyes wide and so utterly

TELL YA FRIENDS
Steve looks carefully at him. “Why don’t you give me one?”
“So I’m going to assume that ‘Go to bed before I come over there and use my old-man powers to force you to sleep’ is synonymous with ‘I want to fuck you into the mattress until you scream my name and cum so hard you pass out’,” Clint says cheerily.
“The therapist said something about an innate, latent desire to damage what I perceive to be my own best qualities by way of penance,”
Steve scowls (adorably, because of his blushing), “Look, I’m not as practiced as you might be, so I don’t really know what we’re supposed to do.”
“I can tell,” Steve says dryly, sighing, “That wasn’t appreciated.”
Steve laughs gently. “It’s all good, Tony,” he says, “You don’t have to thank me.”
He knows Tony’s in Denmark, currently Copenhagen, for some sort of conference, about what exactly Steve’s not entirely clear, but he does know that his usual bodyguard, Happy, is tagging along, as well as a full five-man team fielded by Pepper and Rhodey before their assignment. He also knows that these guys (and one lady) are former special-ops, Army Ranger types; armed to the teeth with weapons far too well concealed for the standard civilian to spot, and that each one was vetted by Peter himself (because Peter is a bit over-protective of Tony, which isn’t exactly unwarranted considering the engineer’s penchant for getting into danger) and given good reviews. Steve, himself, has done his own research on all five bodyguards, and knows that, based alone on track records, these are some of the best people to protect anyone.
Steve frowns himself. “Do you want me to come to bed with you?” he asks in return, as if unsuspecting of such a turn of events, “I kind of assumed you’d like the day to yourself after all. Plus, you know…” he shrugs sheepishly, blushing a bit as he continues, “I didn’t think you wanted me in there.”
Steve’s hair right out of his head and Steve doesn’t even swat his hands away, he
(In the back of his mind, he stutters when he realizes that he’s truly in love with Tony, but he refuses to allow himself to think about it.)
and he was going to lose them that night even if he had gone.
When Peter’s decided he’s given Tony enough affection, he turns his attentions to Steve, and it’s almost painful, how Peter’s eyes light up when he sees Steve, and it’s not hero worship that does it.
Steve’s going through his latest finds, courtesy of Nat’s contacts and Sam’s efforts, blurry photographs and non-descript accounts scattered across the bare surface of the kitchen table of his personal suite, when Tony barges in. In the past, Tony just walking in whenever he wanted would drive Steve crazy, but he’s learned since that it’s not something Tony does intentionally; it’s a mere habit that’s come up after a childhood spent with his father doing the same thing to him, so Steve doesn’t even look up now when Tony just rushes in, his eyes still tracking across the pages as he looks for some hidden detail that can pinpoint Bucky’s exact pattern so he can better anticipate how the man’s mental state is faring.
Tony laughs, but it’s so miserable that Steve kind of hurts.

“Peter thinks you are, so you shut up about that,” Tony says, smiling fondly over at him for a moment before his smile drops a bit. “I just want to make sure he’s at least a bit happy before I ruin everything.”
Rhodey coughs dryly. “I don’t imagine Steve to be the kind to get mad over something like that,” he says, “and besides, have you two even been a thing long enough to have sex?”
(That doesn’t mean to say that he isn’t at all, though—he’s just also aware that Tony can hold his own if need be, even if it’s against just some stalker with a Twitter account.)
“I’m not entirely stubborn,” Steve tells him, and Tony smiles a bit again.
good chance, that Tony’s alive, and Peter nearly cries right then and there, though the makeup artist swats at his knee when the tears even chance it. Peter gives her a glare that it’s own threat, which she happily ignores because she’s more focused on giving on giving Peter the best contour he can have, which Steve doesn’t think is necessary but he can’t stop her from doing.
“For Peter?”
As Steve hadn’t been in the right frame of mind when he’d said it, he doesn’t quite recall it in whole detail, but he knows exactly what Peter’s talking about, and he’s surprised because he realizes what the answer is, and it nearly rocks him to his core, because it’s along the lines of “I think of you as my son, too” and it hurts to even think that it’s what he wants to say because it’s just not his place to say anything of the sort; Peter’s not his kid, no matter how he feels that he is.
“There’s a
He asks if he’s okay before he even thinks twice about it.
, don’t try to play dumb; you have one too many Masters degrees to play dumb—I figure that Steve might not be happy about that.”
“Yes, but not from my
“Aww, you love me,” Tony jokes when he sees the cup.
“Only that, you know… you kind of wanna fuck Tony until he cums so hard he passes out,” Clint says with a cheeky grin that Steve doesn’t even need to
“Tell me when you’re ready. If you’re ready,” Steve tells him, smiling gently at him before returning his immediate attentions back to his drawing. “I don’t want to push. I want you to be sure you trust me absolutely first. Besides, Clint’ll be annoyed if I put a damper on M to the Fourth by making you talk about your emotions. He might even try to kill me. He’s had enough tequila to consider making the effort.”
Tony cleared his throat. “Great ideas. We should definitely discuss this further,” he told Steve in a loud voice. “I’d suggest you come by the tower, I’ll have my assistant set up an appointment.”
Steve smiled, wrapping his arms around him as he lay down once more. “There’s no electricity.”
his realistic might-not-be-dreams, nor could he control how his heart yearned to go back to sleeping.
Wakanda was quiet. Tony’d never been here in person before, but he’d heard stories, and a city like Wakanda—
They’d agreed to eat lunch together, making a slightly awkward small talk on the way over, then brought their food outside to eat on the tower’s rooftop.
Steve winced. Dammit.
When Sam kneeled down and went to work on her wound with steady movements, there was a glimmer of hope in her eyes—hope that had not completely lost to anguish.
Vision cocked his head, looking vaguely amused. “I have to say you’re both being overly melodramatic. I told Tony I’d meet him on the other side. He should know better than to think I’d break my promises.”
He thrust forward, nodding desperately. “Harder, come on.”
Oh, why did that have to feel so good?
“Bucky!” Carol yelled with palpable horror.
“He was there for all of the not-so-nice parts of my life. I mean, the other AI back-ups have one hundred percent the same programming as JARVIS had, but it’s… not the same. It’s not bad, it’s just… the longer he’s gone, the more I realize JARVIS was a one-of-a-kind kind of guy.”
Long minutes passed before Tony fought for some sliver of common sense. The rest of his resistance had fallen to the wayside, leaving his body boneless, and his heart soft.
“I was asked to see that you are both not crushed by debris,” Vision answered. “And I intend to agree with Natasha whenever I can.”
The next alleyway, as Steve had hoped, was deserted.
It had been Indries’ desk, Stane had said. Were the letters hers as well? Surely Stane wouldn’t come in here at night to put them into Steve’s sight, would he? But… as Steve took the letters in his hand, he realized that yes, it were indeed letters someone had written to Indries. Letters she’d seemingly kept in her possession. Steve looked the envelope and sighed. It were letters from Tony.
Truth was, he wasn’t even sure he understood what had happened to JARVIS. But he’d thought for sure that he was gone for good.
, and I trust you, but if you come here—”
“Yeah, of course that gets you going,” Rhodey said, rolling his eyes fondly.
“We’re in love,” Steve answered, the
“Ты знаешь, ктоя?” she asked softly.
“Hi there,” he said and smiled when DUM-E straightened up a little to get to his height.
Steve looked at him. His joyful expression, his ridiculous goatee, the scars at the edges of his field of vision, those white teeth biting his lips like he couldn't contain himself. Steve wanted all of that. He didn't want to think of anyone else having that look directed at them. He was so gone it was crazy. Tony had so easily entered Steve, not only into his body, although that was an amazing experience in and of itself, but also his presence, his attention. Steve reached up, circling Tony's neck with his arm, as his other hand moved to pull up his own leg, giving Tony better access. "Kiss me again…" he requested.
“You’re the same man you were this morning,” he told him, “just with a good few thousand years at your back. You know you love me, too, and it scares the hell out of you.”
Rhodey trailed off. His face was blank for a second, and then his eyebrows shot upwards. He squinted at Tony, as if trying to read his mind. “Hey, is this about your stupid quarrel with Steve?”
Steve smiled softly and kissed her cheek. “That you did, Pegs.”
“Not so bad for a whippersnapper,” Barnes said as Tony sat down at the table, tipping a glass in his direction. Next to him, Natasha gave him a small nod, and there might’ve been the hint of a smile on her dark red lips, which basically translated to her really liking Tony and being proud of his achievements.
“Tell me,” Steve said. “I want to know.”
Steve furrowed his brows. “On Stark? No, I’ve… I wasn’t really there yet. He said there were files on Peggy and my team, too, and I…”
There was nowhere to go. Not LUX and not even the high class night clubs that he and Natasha had frequented so often in the past years.
Phil had left a little while ago, but he’d made his opinion perfectly clear. He was going to protect his agents, and since that involved at least one inhuman, he had already been wary about regulations from the beginning. Luckily for Tony, though, he couldn’t exactly make his opinion publicly known, since everyone believed that SHIELD no longer existed.
“And the others?” Bucky asked. “Shouldn’t you call for back-up?”
Ultron’s matrix practically trembled with anger and he pushed even more of himself into Extremis’ network… more, and more still. At one point, Tony felt as if nothing was left of what had once made him
“Alright, maybe you could. Question is: Will you?”
“What channels?” Rhodey intercepted. “You said it was safe.”
Thanks for joining us on this adventure of a series!
Next to Steve, Clint’s eyes widened, and Steve could hear the sound of something hitting the floor hard.
"No, it’s… fine," Steve answered, getting to his feet and leaving everything behind him as it was. He would get back to it later, he decided, and headed for the elevator.

“Stop it,” Steve snarled and roughly pulled Wanda to the side.
“Found him?” Tony asked immediately. The demand tore from his throat before the door latched behind the new arrival.

“Wouldn’t that be something,” Mister Stark went on, looking at the sky. “A place just for us. A place where only our world exists and nothing else. Now that’s something I would love to see.”
Everyone else probably didn’t see how Tony’s posture was hunched just that tiny bit, or the tensed line of his shoulders. They didn’t see the slight twitching in his jaw as he started walking, but Steve did. He knew he couldn’t do anything, but he stayed close at his side, as he and Bruce set to work on the cradle.
“No,” Steve said. “It was more of an emergency plan. At least that’s what he told me. He might’ve suspected it’d come down to it… I don’t know.”
Tony heard someone calling and squared his shoulders as he walked towards the elevators. He spotted the two of them standing in the foyer, looking a bit lost before they noticed him approaching.
Tony had started calling him that again, as if to differentiate between him and his own Steve, to keep that distance between them. Steve didn’t know about Tony, but he certainly
“You’re my friend, too,” Bucky said, then, inwardly grimacing. He’d never been good at those kinds of talks, declaring his feelings and whatnot, not even before the war. It had always been strangely easy with Steve, but otherwise, he just didn’t know how to truly be himself around others.
Tony grimaced. “We almost killed each other.”
“No,” Tony snapped then brushed a hand over his face. “I just… I need some air. Might as well walk with how fast we’re moving.”
Before Indries, Tony had someone new in his bed twice a week,” Stane snapped. “Trust me, he’ll get bored of him soon. And then we can continue as planned.”
Tony sighed. “Yeah… you’re right.”
Natasha didn’t flinch. Didn’t move. Merely studied him. Their breath billowed out between them in soft white clouds. “I know you hate it when I lie to you,” she said with a soft tone, making Steve huff. “But I know you, and you weren’t ready for this. Telling you about him would’ve cost you everything.”
I'm sorry this is such shit. I was beginning to upload and then I realized I don't like the ending (which possibly has something to do with the fact that I'm crap at writing sequels and such and this is really uncharted territory for me) and so I just hope you don't hate me as much as I hate myself bc I had to explain Steve's feelings for the next one up in this series just don't hate me if it helps I'm writing a teen!Peter fic right now set after Ultron in this universe and I'm trying really hard at that so be kind and don't hate this
