In the next seven days Tony doesn’t put foot outside his hotel room at all: he asks Pepper to send over all the equipment he needs, then he gets down to business, tinkering and writing and planning; his diet goes back to basics – or, at least,
“Mr. Field, I don’t know how to tell you, there aren’t enough funds in your account to make this withdrawal. There is nothing I can—“
“… And we both made a promise to each other. But here you go, not showering for days to end, getting into bar fights with drunkards, spending most of the time alone or in the gym. You need—“Don’t say it.”

“I used sarcasm instead.”
“Uh… I don’t remember whether it has been made public yet but the President, he… he’s going to announce the revision of the Supreme Court decision, so gay marriage… it’s gonna be illegal again.”
“Sure, what is it?”
“Indeed it has…” comes the reply, and before Steve can even think of a response – or explanation – a sound seems to be coming from it, so
But that never happens, because when Tony gets to work, he is informed that he’s been assigned to a top secret project, one that involves his immediate relocation to an undisclosed town all the way in New Mexico, and before he can protest or object, he finds himself being boarded onto a Greyhound bus without even having the chance to stop by his room, the words ‘duty’ and ‘country’ repeated over and over into his ears. Of course, once he arrives at the new site he tries more than once to call the number Steve gave him, but the line incessantly gives out a flat tune, convincing Tony that maybe the other gave him the wrong digits
Among vague murmurs of dissent, the President raises up his voice so it can be heard on top of it (as if nobody had any idea about what the third issue was about): “The last thing I want to discuss today is the superhero problem. Now, I know Tony here used to be an ‘Avenger’, but I believe we can all agree that the situation has become ridiculous. We simply can’t have these
“Why would it?”
“I thought that kiss last night was pretty self-explanatory…” Tony gives him a small smirk, feeling more at ease now that he knows Steve is not angry with him and reinvigorated because they thought the same thing without even talking about it. And when the other looks away, smiling awkwardly, it seems like they’re back to years ago, when the flirting originally started, out of nowhere and unexpectedly, slowly morphing into something deeper.

Point taken.
“Fury?”
And that’s exactly what he does, each and every time. He gets on stage wearing an old Iron Man gauntlet, someone from the crowd punctually throws something in the air which he blows off – this was an explicit request from the President, and he was not wrong because people absolutely go
“During the war, I mean. Right before I became a… Capsicle.” Steve smiles some more, and now their eyes met, even if just for a brief second before Tony forces himself to divert his, to avoid unnecessary complications. “It gets easy, eventually. Dealing with survival. You find… good enough reasons to be alive.”
, that he had totally forgotten just how
“I try my best.
An awkward, heavy silence is hoovering in the room now, and just before the President speaks, Tony is about sure that he’s going to get fired, and good riddance to the plan.
Steve stays there, face against the metal bars, watching the other until he’s all but disappeared from his vision; then he sighs softly and slowly goes back to the hard bed, lying down with his eyes fixed on the ceiling, the shadow of a smile still brightening up his whole face.

, because although he talks a lot, that’s just a copying mechanism to put up with all the bullshit he has to constantly hear. “Look, this strategy of yours, I’m not sure how much it’s working” he then says, changing the subject when it’s clear that he’s not going to get any other information regarding Steve. “The president is just not worried. Hell, he barely even acknowledges that these leaks are happening. His one comment is to get things done
“Likewise,” he says, leaning against the wall next to him as the band starts playing the mellow notes of Moon River, one of the most played songs on the radio in the last few weeks, so much so that Tony’s mind has effortlessly memorized its words, and now he hums them along softly, more to himself than to anyone else’s benefit.
“The living room, sir.

At first Tony doesn’t respond or even move, and Steve wonders if his voice was high enough for the other to hear him. But just as he’s about to repeat his question, comes the reply.
to the rest of the team, if you know what I mean.”
“Woah, are you that cold? Here, take my coat, I don’t really need it, it was mostly just to…” Steve stops just in time, as the next few words bursting out of his mouth would have been ‘impress you’, and he’s not that confident, not with Tony anyway.
This time is his turn to get shushed down with a kiss, as Steve’s lips find his again, and they linger on for the longest five seconds.
“Get your hands off me!” he yells, shoving Steve with all the strength he can muster, managing to make him stumble back of a couple of steps. But he has no time to enjoy his little victory because before he even realizes it, a punch lands on the left side of his face, sending him against the wall first and then, as his head hits the hard surface, on the floor, where everything turns suddenly pitch black.
“Hey, it’s Friday, hopefully evil guys will want to just stay home and have a drink instead.” he chimes in, and now his arm is resting on the head of Steve’s chair, in what he hopes to be a soothing gesture. “Anyway. This is a double date, ladies, let’s try and keep our work out of it, shall we? From this moment on, we’re just four regular people enjoying each other’s company and food, wishing to get laid later on.”
“Sorry, what?” Steve replies, confused and slightly altered, prompting Tony to shoot him a quick, interested glance that unfortunately the other catches, because he turns towards him before he can look away: “Why don’t

Steve looks at him, staying silent and leaning his hand upon his, rubbing his thumb against it for a while before replying: “You know, I think about the same thing pretty much every day. Not the… wedding part, but you getting hurt. I’m scared someone is going to figure out the mole is you and act upon it, like I don’t know, sending you off to a CIA base or something, I’ve heard all kinds of horror stories recently and I just…” he shakes his head to himself, taking a deep sigh before continuing. “I hate this situation and what’s worse is that we have no idea how long this is gonna go on for, the leaks are

that sounds. And although he cares and should rectify them, all he can think about right now is to get out of the compound as quickly as possible. He double taps his reactor and in just a couple of seconds his armor is up and running, hence allowing him to lift the remaining few boxes all at once. Rhodey looks at him and shakes his head more vigorously, following him along.
“I know… But that doesn’t mean I’ve stopped loving you.”
Steve blinks, puzzled, opening and closing his mouth a couple of times like if he was a fish. The point is, he just can’t
He’s shocked, and not just because that’s the longest speech he’s ever heard Steve saying, or what it means, or even that he’s said those very words in the first place. Of course, all of this is included, but most of all, it’s because Steve really thinks he, Tony, can make him happy. Actually, he already
“Yeah…” he offers, because there’s no reason to deny the evident at this point “I’d written them before… y’know. Just in case.”

, he wonders to himself as he makes his way out of his room and into the corridor, and in his mind there’s not a doubt about where he’s headed. A couple of minutes later, he’s entering the sick bay, eyes immediately spotting Steve lying unconscious on the first bed he comes across. He swallows some of his nervousness down and takes the next few steps that separate him from the other, kneeling down next to the bed for lack of chairs in the nearby and throwing a quick glance at the IV next to him.
“It was to protect
of these. He’s just a man in a suit, and perhaps that’s why his mind has been spiraling down this past decade or so: he’s been meddling with situations beyond human comprehension, and that’s bound to have an effect on you in the long run.
“This is bullshit…” he sighs, shaking his head to himself before leaning back against the seat; as his eyes roll upwards, they meet Steve’s by sheer coincidence, and as it happens there’s a shadow of a smile on his lips as he gives the briefest wink to Tony, who can immediately feel his heart slightly giving way.
Both women’s eyes set on him for a response, but Steve has absolutely no idea what to reply, the only recurring thought in his head being,
That seems to confuse Tony, who takes a few seconds to process the new piece of information.
“Cap, look, I thought we agreed it’s
“Who’s with him?”
Rhodey looks into his friend’s eyes for a couple of seconds, but it’s all it takes for him to know he’s saying the absolute truth; he nods, and without adding anything else he goes sitting by his side, helping him with the boxes.
me? You have no
“Yeah, well, my job, it doesn’t come with days off, not at the moment I’m afraid,” he explains, a hand attempting to comb his hair while he looks for a piece of paper and something to write with. Once he finds both, he quickly scribbles his name and number on it and stretches it over to Grant, who is still looking at the whole scene with puzzled eyes. “Here. I wish I didn’t have to leave like this, but…”
. Mind giving me a hand? It’s
Fury shakes his head now, filling in the sentence hanging in the air: “You’re not naïve enough to believe this bullshit. That explosion in Afghanistan? How do you think you survived?”
“Gentlemen only from this point on,” as they’ve reached the restrooms area.
Steve’s lips curl up to form an involuntary smile: of course that’s what Tony is doing. That’s just one reason why he lov— Before the thought is completed he stops himself, almost as if he was actually saying those words out loud. He blinks, surprised, and maybe Tony was actually in the middle of telling him something because now he’s staring at him with those blue eyes of his, a silent question mark written on his pupils. Thank god the other doesn’t know how to read minds – not
. He yawns again, weirdly feeling the urge to hide his face away while doing it, and spins on the chair, giving the other his back. He’s tired and should really make it upstairs to sleep in a proper bed, but the thought of leaving the chair and actually standing up is even more exhausting.
For a few seconds Tony doesn’t say anything, just stares into his blue eyes, as if trying to spot whether this is for real or not. And although it’s scary to admit, he believes it is, so he slowly nods, leaning his forehead against Steve’s and smiling brightly, and when he talks, his voice betrays him, shaking a little, out of the burst of joy that is now filling his heart.
“Shit, you should’ve seen your face, it was like someone had just told you that you had forgotten a line in the Star-Spangled Banner!”
. “I’ll just have what you’re having.”
“Y-Yes, of course you can trust me, Mr. Stark. I promise you.”
until it’s all over.
“Why are you asking
He lets himself on the sofa and sighs deeply, throwing his head back and passing a hand over his face; he should be surprised that Rhodey doesn’t know, but at this point nothing really shocks him, especially not with Fury and the extraordinary level his paranoia has reached. Nevertheless, he knows too well that keeping this from the
“When you got hurt… it was like something flipped inside of me, and I couldn’t figure out why. When I think back to it now, well, it’s kinda obvious, but if you had told me two months ago…” he chuckles lightly, shaking his head to himself.
“Only that’s not completely true, is it? Your arm is still broken, I assume.”
“What… are we gonna do now?”
For some reason he doesn’t quite understand, it’s weird hearing his name being called out like this, in the open, as if it was a profanity, something that shouldn’t be said so
, but it’s everything is going to say on the matter, ever. Because Steve doesn’t need to have confirmation – if he doesn’t already know – that for a split second Tony actually parted his lips to let him in –
“Well, thank you…?”
“Glad you accepted my invitation,” he greets him, and Steve finds himself jumping on his feet and shaking the other’s hand before even realizing it, as if answering to a reflex.
“You still don’t get it, do you? I know this plan sucks, but it’s the best I’ve got. If it fails, or if you refuse to go through with it, you and Rogers and I and those kids and every other minority out there won’t be able to have a life
“Don’t know what to tell you, guys, it seemed to appear out of nowhere so I thought—“
because I know
Steve shakes his head and goes to take Tony’s hand into his, but the consistency of the other’s body is not high enough for that to happen, so his hand ends up on his own cheek instead. Tony looks away, trying to mask his own disappointment, and before Steve can ask anything related to it he quickly changes the subject.
Ouch. That hit home. Because of course, he’s right. Which makes it harder to admit. He doesn’t like to lose an argument,
– but of course that didn’t happen so I thought I’d give it next time I saw you, you know?”
“Do you think it could work?” Fury asks him when he’s done, and as much as he would rather not to admit it, he nods.
“So what’s the plan? Just scouting around the coordinates he gave us, and hope for the best?” Steve hears himself saying, although he hadn’t planned of speaking, still flabbergasted by the revelation about Iron Man. And why has he just used ‘us’? He doesn’t know any of these people, why is he suddenly on board with it all? But of course, deep down he knows the answer to both of these questions, and it’s one and the same. If Iron Man is real, then Steve
“But Janet, it’s
“Well, that’s easily said. I really have an obligation towards the people, to help them and protect them, whatever the cost. I don’t care much about politics, but I’d happily give up my own life for the greater good.”
“Wait, what? Why? I mean, of course, but is everything okay?”
let it go. And by ‘it’, I mean our… dispute. I think that’s why I stayed away as long as I did, I lost myself into travelling until I was gone so far beyond the world we know that all the problems seemed kinda… irrelevant, y’know? If I think about it, even know, yeah, it hurts a bit, I believe it always will, but in the end… it happened four years ago now, so much shit has happened since and it just doesn’t make sense to keep holding a grudge, not to me anyway.” He stops, not only talking but walking as well, and Steve does the same, eyes fixed on his. “I know it’s probably not how you pictured this conversation going, but this is what I’ve got. What do
Steve and Tony take their respective seats next to one another; the rest of the team doesn’t tease them about it like they used to, nor they greet them in any way rather than a general nod. There’s only silence in the aircraft, and pretty soon that gets covered by a whizzing noise as the engine is turned on and the jet lifts up in the air. The plan is simple enough: go for the head. There are no specifics, no strategy, no alternatives: they don’t have that sort of luxury anymore.
“I need to go now…”

“What do you mean, you’re ‘sorry’? What’s going on?”
“Mercy Hospital, sir.”

Ten minutes later, his bladder empty and his face refreshed – although he can still smell the other man on his body, painful as that is – he gets out of the bathroom, ready to take his leave, when a familiar voice catches him off guard, almost triggering his stealth suit to emerge from his reactor.
“Bold of you to assume I’d let you come here alone, Mr. Stark. And maybe your father started it, but he didn’t
the person who shouted his name. He stares at Miss Goodwin until she caves in, certainly reading the serious look in his eyes and deciding he knows better.
“You… You told him?” Steve mumbles, still trying to process this new piece of information that has just been added to the pile.
“I know, and I meant that.” he looks briefly down, trying to unscramble the mess that his thoughts are right now, and then: “We will. Once I get back. Once I have
think it’s a good idea to go talk to him on your own? As I said yesterday, I’m not entirely convinced he’s going to see reason this time…”
“See? This is why I hate goodbyes…” he murmurs eventually, unaware of how much has passed since the last time he spoke: maybe minutes, maybe an hour, time is so relative when you lose yourself in the moment, isn’t it?
“Nick, uh… I wasn’t talking about the Avengers, Steve and I… we want to be together.” he eventually manages to say, and it hits him too late that he’s not even one-hundred percent sure Steve feels the same way. Yes, they talked, and yes, they kissed, but from there to be in a relationship there’s an
… god, why is this so hard to say out loud even when I’m clueless whether you can actually hear me right now or not…” he wonders, shaking his head to himself and leaning back to sit on his heels, gaze falling off Steve to find the floor as he crosses his arms over his knees and lowers his forehead against them.
, and nothing makes sense. “What are you doing here?”
But Steve looks too shocked to even hear him, and asks a question of his own: “Why did you put your hand on mine?”
. I… I need time alone.”
“Shut up and let me do this. I can’t stand looking at you covered in your own blood like this. I’m gonna fire all of the nurses in this dump of a hospital, I swear to god…”
“I don’t know how someone so

“Hey,
“Who would have thought, Rogers? Maybe you’re not completely hopeless after all…” he nods, straightening on his chair as reaching out for his wallet in the back of his pants. “
As Steve turns into a popsicle again in front of his eyes –
Steve doesn’t quite understand whether the other was being sarcastic or not, but before he can explore the comment any further, there’s a soft knock on the door and a second later one of the nurses he saw in sick bay earlier appears on the entrance.
The President likes that answer, and approves of it straightaway, much to Tony’s relief; knowing that this was a crucial point, he had been recently working day and night on it to find a somewhat pacific solution without compromising his position: this way, he would insert a 100% humanitarian directory in the drones’ programming, therefore avoiding that, even in the improbable possibility of external meddling, they couldn’t be used to harm civilians. He doesn’t exactly know whether using his personal resources is a violation of any law – although he had sworn he would familiarize himself with them, he never got around to actually do it, time being limited as it is – but on the other hand, compared to the amount of infractions to human rights conventions that this administration was planning to do, he’s sure a purely bureaucratic one would be on the bottom of the list. He scribbles a note to himself – he’s found out this morning that no electrical equipment is allowed within the White House, including his techno glasses, which are now lying at the security checkpoint like banal commodity – and then listens helplessly as the President moves on to the next point, which is the ban of gay marriage, overruling the decision of the Supreme Court. The conversation gets surprisingly heated quite fast (he would have expected to be a quite unanimous consensus, given the kind of people in the room), mostly because other cabinet members point out how
“Don’t you think
the rings nor their powers. The way I see it, they’re a danger to Earth and maybe the whole universe as long as they’re not in safe hands. Which aren’t Loki’s, or this terroristic organization’s either. I know you
The flight takes about four hours – Steve could have sworn it had been shorter before – and although Tony insists on sitting in the co-pilot seat, exhaustion and fatigue have soon the best of him, and in less than fifteen minutes he’s asleep. Steve doesn’t mind, in some ways he’s actually relieved: the guy asked for a coffee, but it had seemed to him he was already running on some kind of high, considering he had been, well, frozen, for more than half a century. Plus, the moment he heard Fury’s deception, his head has started sending alarm bells nonstop. He can use the time to think things through.
It’s around six am when Tony awakes, and for a split second he doesn’t remember where he is, or
“We’ve gotta stop meeting like this, Steve…” Tony says, half a grin on his face which he knows is there just to hide the lingering concern behind his misleading light tone.
Tony rolls briefly his eyes, then takes a breath and, holding back another chuckle, spits it out: “It’s… Steve.”

Thor frowns, looking more perplexed than him, and is about to reply when T’Challa precedes him, making it clear that he
“Yeah, buddy… I’m afraid that’s not it because, well, it’s not Pep I’m engaged to…” he says, not being able to hold a giggle in, maybe because exhaustion is finally catching up to him, or because the whole situation is actually so tragic to seem hilarious by this point.
“Oh please, Steve, with all the time we spend together…” his voice trails off as he begins turning the wrench around, not such an easy task when you’re bent over and upside down.
So when the sadly now familiar stench woke him up this morning, Tony already knew what was expecting him once he opened his eyes. And sure enough, there it was.
“Very remarkable.”

“It’s been a while,” he chimes skittishly, throwing the rest of the beer down his throat.

. Still, he’ll do it, as a firm believer of putting yourself into someone else’s shoes. He glances over again, and a small smile appears on his face. Yeah, he really hopes Tony will let him be his friend. God knows they both need one.
“Yeah, well, that’s because it

Speaking of, it might be worth going back in, seeing if we’ve missed something. Got to admit, once the suit opened and Anthony came out, the ring wasn’t a priority anymore.”
“Yes?” he answers pacifically, but even so the kid seems to be somewhat scared. Maybe he’s just started this – job? Internship? Why is everything so complicated nowadays? – and doesn’t know how the adult world works quite yet.
. He can have you. After what you did—“
“I can relate to that…” Tony nods, finishing his shawarma and throwing the paper into the bin a couple of feet away, scoring a basket. “Listen, uh… I don’t really know how to start this topic, so I’m just gonna come out and say it, okay? When I was… up there, I realized I

Ten minutes go by before he is eventually able to pull himself together and leave Steve’s side, shambling his feet outside the room, his eyes red and swollen, feeling old and weary. The head physician stops talking to a nurse as soon as he sees him and approaches him, looking at him. Tony doesn’t return his gaze, fixed on the pavement.

he does – but has to pretend that’s not the case, and not just because that’s the way it
Steve lifts up his eyes to meet the much younger ones now in front of him. They belong to a kid who he estimates can’t be more than nineteen years old, although he looks about thirteen.
– and then he forces himself to begin his maneuvers; the hardest part is having to lift up Steve’s right hand from upon his shoulder, not only because it’s strong and muscular, but especially as it seems like it’s been stuck on his body with something like superglue (when he has turned, just minutes before, it has barely moved from the position it was in). It also doesn’t help that he has to do this with his left hand, because of course it’s just his luck that they had to fall asleep in this very position (
“What were those?” Rhodey’s voice catches him by surprise once more, sending a short, panicky shiver down his spine.
The answer about his medical condition comes just after eight am on the following morning when he finally has the chance of speaking with his doctor. With a practicality Steve is glad for, she explains how the explosion had released some sort of toxin in the air which had somehow affected the serum in his blood, causing the broken arm, the headache, and the semi-comatose state he had been in for four days before waking up. That’s a long time, he thinks, but out loud he just thanks to the doctor and asks when he can leave the hospital. She replies whenever he likes since his values are already going back to normal, which is a relief to hear.
“Tony!” he screams, and the panic in his voice disgusts him. “Tony, are you okay?”
“Welcome to the club…” he agrees, and then stands up, because this is dragging over for too long and he’s quite sure he’s going to be able to hear his own heart start to give way if he doesn’t get out of this house in the next couple of minutes. “I gotta go now or I’ll never be able to.”

Steve, who had really enjoyed the peaceful half an hour preceding this moment, arches a brow in the other’s direction, having no idea what any of that could possibly mean.
He shakes his head in response, hand covering his face for a moment, just in case the hint of a fluster decides to creep up on him (luckily it doesn’t): “Nothing. Sorry. I’m just… tired.”
quiver with fear at her anger. Instead he kept his gaze straight ahead, slipping his sunglasses on and fighting back fidgeting until the driver appeared and held the door open for them to get in. Nat yanked her arm away, got in, and waited for Tony to follow and for the driver to close the door behind him, before she hissed, “What did you do?
But every time he closed his eyes, he saw a vacuum of darkness. Nothing he did got rid of the cold harshness of space, or the trembling that would accompany it.
“And he didn’t....he didn’t....he let us think....” Clint spat, vibrating so hard even Tony could see it from where he was.
“Hey, Cap. What brings you this way?”
Shit fucking shit. How long had he been unconscious? If he was lucky, Natasha would be there any minute. But if he wasn’t…he had to get free. Immediately. If he did, he could find Rhodey and they could get out of there. Fuck, if he’d had the chance to work on his nanotech idea more…
“What, no lecture? Do I get a bedtime kiss?” he asked, waggling his eyebrows a little, but without his usual effort. Fuck it all, he was so tired.
It took a while. Tony twitched, wondering if things were about to explode before they really got started as a team, while he waited for Barton’s answer. Silence stretched on, and even Natasha looked faintly concerned, when Clint finally lifted his head, looked at him, and grinned. “I don’t know. Get us lunch, and I might call it even.”
The being interrupts Steve before he can finish his sentence, and for the second time its voice sounds very human in its vexed accent: “You’re not familiar with the Laws of the universe, I
“Wait, how much time was I underwater?”

about itself, like if he had just spoken from deep down his soul – and maybe he has. Fury is now staring at him, possibly waiting for an explanation (of his screaming, at least), and although Tony really doesn’t want to give it, he’s painfully aware that it could be his only shot at shutting down this plan. “Look,” he starts, taking a deep breath, “Steve and me, we want to give it a try…”
needs
“Oh, I think I’m in love...” he replies, and for once his words couldn’t be more appropriate because the statement is nothing short of reciprocated by all of the others, and Tony can’t help but feeling somewhat proud of him, because Steve Rogers delivering a fully successful line in this kind of environment is not something that many have had the privilege to witness.
“It’s a long story, you’ll get filled in sooner or later, but anyway. Space is not your place. Earth is. It’s been over a year, it’s time.”
Tony sniggers softly, a small smile on his lips as he follows the invitation, letting himself go in the most classic of trusting exercises, sure that his body will be met by the other’s. Which of course it does. Steve’s muscly arms wrap instantly around his shoulders, giving him that sense of safety and comfort that he had been craving so much in the last few months. He closes his eyes, stretching a hand behind to meet Steve’s neck, caressing it listlessly and staying silent, allowing himself to find some peace in the stillness of the moment.
If only he could do it all again, he’d grab Tony’s hand on the battlefield just before he snapped his fingers. Maybe that would have worked, and they’d both be alive right now. Or maybe it wouldn’t have, and they’d have both been drained out of all of their energy, and drawn their last breath in unison, two heroes fallen to protect the Earth.

“Coffee, uh?” Steve repeats, his mind already going to a specific place in Brooklyn which he thinks the other would like – which is a bit weird, considering he has no idea about the guy’s actual likes.
“Oh my god, how many times do I have to—“

participate in this thing, whatever it might be or involve. After all, when his own father abandoned them and especially once he started reading those comic books, the scrawny kid grew more and more fascinated with the ideology and ethics which motivated the first American superhero: Iron Man. Sure, he always knew those were just stories… except now it appears they actually held some truth. Only one way to find out for sure.
with it.”
“Steve! Are you okay?” he yells as soon as oxygen gets into his lungs again, opening up the front of his helmet as his eyes frantically search for the other’s body, spotting it just some feet away. Stumbling along, he kneels down next to him, hand sprinting to the blonde’s chest, desperate to feel his heartbeat. It’s there, strong as ever.
It seems to be a hut of sorts, quite basic if you can trust the appearances; there’s a table and a few chairs around it; something resembling a big cupboard against one of the walls, and two doors occupy the other two. Steve and Tony are still in their defensive stances, but the being doesn’t seem to notice or care as it resumes talking with the same monotone voice.
“Wait, are you… going?” the other asks him, quite surprised, standing up as well but forcing himself to stay put; Tony notices how his body seems to be gravitating towards his own, and the thought alone is enough to make him shiver with anticipation.
“Come on, that’s not what I meant…”
Loki is fuming as he bounces back up, surprising both Steve and Tony, but instead of attacking again, he swiftly opens up the portal and disappears into it, the same way he had appeared only a few minutes earlier. Tony can’t believe their luck. Another trick would have been the end of them all. As to give confirmation of his supposition, the suit gives a faint sigh of exhaustion and shuts down, giving Tony just enough time to get out of it. With Loki gone, the force that was holding the locker in place against Steve ends, and he pushes it aside effortlessly, although the gesture is missed by Tony, on his knees and out of breath.
Dossier? Reputation? What the hell is he talking about? These are the questions Steve wants to ask right now, but instead other words come out of his mouth: “Please, stop calling me that. The Army was a long time ago. I’m not a captain of anything right now, not even my local baseball team.”
Tony nods, looking at Steve for just a couple of seconds before folding his glasses and slipping them back into the pocket of his jacket. He then fishes his phone out, checks the time, sends a few messages, all actions he doesn’t
“Not sure, but it looks like a tunnel of some sort,” he explains just before he dives towards the opening.
that he has no intention of following his lead – but can’t keep himself from tapping his foot along. When Tony notices it, he bends over and catches his hands, trying to pull him up, a task he eventually succeeds into when Steve decides to actually collaborate.
. Creating bonds that could just as easily be broken… not something he’s fond of. Plus, Steve is his Achilles’ heel, he’s known it for quite some time now, and letting him in has been the single biggest mistake of his life. That’s not gonna happen again, no sir, no matter what, he’s not going to open his heart to St—
He has just opened one of the doors to find out a couple of tatamis on the floor when he hears Steve’s voice, and then his presence sneaks up on him from behind.
“Heeelp… m-meeeee…”
the other man could look when he set his mind to it and ditched his soldier clothes for a more mundane look. Unsurprisingly, the main color is blue, but he has somehow managed to coordinate different shades of it: the dark blue of his trousers is the perfect balance to the pale blue of his polo shirt, and Tony just can’t believe he didn’t have any help picking this outfit up, or that he insists on wearing tracksuits and plain t-shirts so much when he looks so…
“You could go back with me…” Steve suggests, although he feels stupid doing it, sure that if it was a possibility the other would have already mentioned it.
Then a hand placidly lands upon his, making his fingers stop their nervous dance, and a gentle voice speaks into his ear – not really a whisper, although it’s got all the softness of one: “It’s going to work, Tony. I
“Well, hopefully…”

. Now.
Steve blushes – too suddenly and brightly to be because of the cold – but he doesn’t comment on it, although he’s storing the memory in a safe place in his mind to relieve it over and over again at a later time. He grabs his wrist instead, for once the one leading, and all throughout the battle that follows the only thing he can think about is the way the blonde’s lips slowly curved upwards as hearing those words.
“W-What…?” he mumbles, still not totally awake, confused because he just was in the middle of a fight – hell, he was
it helps that they’ve known each other for years, and they’re close friends – by the way, never believe someone who says friends can’t become lovers, because that’s just bullshit – but that’s not all there is to it.

He makes Tony laugh without even having to

of him was to wash himself that morning – a habit more than a rational thought, that’s always been the first thing he does when he wakes up – especially given the fact that the possibility of Tony dying had been a constant thought in the back of his head since the whole Thanos scenario started, and this decision still haunts him on a daily basis even now, a year later. When they eventually returned to Earth, and he’d got back to their room, he’d lied in bed for a good thirty-six hours straight, trying so desperately to recapture Tony’s smell within those four walls, inside their closet, between the sheets. It was there, barely but present still, so he’d sworn to himself to not step outside until he couldn’t sniff it anymore – but that happened faster than he was prepared to, and it just left him feeling even emptier than before, because it was like now Tony had really gone forever. That’s when he decided he would not touch a single thing in that bedroom anymore, and he’s kept his promise so far.
But if he thought the flowers were going to be the only surprise of the evening he was solely mistaken. As it turns out, Steve indeed took the time to make an actual
“Your hand is all sticky…” Steve complains, taking a breather and giggling softly, his eyes fixed on Tony’s lips for a second before meeting his eyes. “Tell me you have a flat in Manhattan…”

. It’s kind of in the middle of another project now, and he hates having to leave something hanging when he’s in the midst of something infinitely more exciting.
Tony groans in embarrassment, letting himself go against the chair and wanting to disappear again, only this time because he doesn’t think he has it in him to show his face anywhere else now that he’s positive others actually know about them. Not because he’s ashamed or anything like that, it’s more that the whole ‘Civil War’ mess sounds ever worse now. Superheroes against superheroes over a political, moral, ideological issue? You can get behind that, if not in practice, in theory at least. But if you know that the head of both factions were lovers? That makes it looks like the modern version of

He’s arrived twenty minutes earlier, but that’s nothing new, it happens almost every morning, to the point that the keeper has made a joke out of it, teasing him gently the few times he hadn’t found him there already when the old man had started his shift.

Although the secretary’s voice sounds distant, it gets to his brain anyway, pulling him away from his own spiraling thoughts; he smiles and thanks her, then stands up, unclenches his jaw and heads inside the office. Tony didn’t have the time – nor, to be frank, any interest or will – to google the man standing in front of him now, perfectly aware that the more he knew about what kind of person he is, the less able to put on a façade he would be – especially here in Washington. The one adjective that now pops up into his mind to describe this guy would be average – height, skin color, eye color, hairdo, body type: try to conjure up every and each of these characteristics personified in the figure of a random, standard politician into your mind and this would be the result. John Grey – even his name is so bland and
“I will find a way to bring you back, I swear…” Steve mumbles, and although Tony doesn’t think that’s possible, he doesn’t have the heart or the will to crash both of their hopes. After all, weirder things have happened to them in the past, so who’s to say this is out of their reach?
“I sent you that email
“I’m serious. Maybe if we are fast enough we’ll get back before it’s too late.”
. When he’s one-hundred percent sure that’s not the case, he runs his fingers through his hair – which is now a chaotic and greasy mess on top of his head, dry, knotty and in dire need of conditioner – and stares at his own reflection with a mixture of sadness and rejection, one more time resisting the urge to punch it. He takes a shower for the first time in over a week – the blood from yesterday’s fight had spilled all over his white t-shirt and, left unwashed, had consequently dried up and begun to give off a faux smell, one he simply couldn’t ignore it even if he wanted to – then he sits on the bed again (in the same exact spot Tony had sit mere hours before, although Steve couldn’t possibly know that), takes a small notebook from the drawer of his nightstand and traces a simple, small line next to many others. He counts them from the beginning as he does every single morning, then shakes his head and closes briefly his eyes as murmuring to himself: “One-hundred, seventy-nine days… Sam keeps telling me it’ll get better but at this point I’m starting to think it never will. I don’t know what to do.” He closes the notebook, puts it back where it belongs and, with what seems like an extreme effort, he stands up and goes to the wardrobe to take a clean outfit out. There’s a picture of him with Tony taped on the inside of one of the doors, and as he gets dressed his eyes are fixed on it, as if by doing that he could actually communicate with the other. “I hope you have a good day, Tony, wherever you might be…” he whispers to it once he’s fully dressed, giving a soft knock on the wood as he always does – something his mum taught him as a kid, although he can’t really remember what good that’s supposed to do – before closing the closet and dragging his feet out of his room, another whole day in front of him, another whole day in which he’ll try not to get killed by some super villain, even though as time goes by he finds himself wondering more and more if giving up wouldn’t actually be better.
“So as I was saying,” he begins, as if he had just stopped talking a few seconds ago, “Your date is not gonna be that interested in your job, or your fitness routine for that matter. You need to tell them about
When he first opens his eyes, darkness is all he sees.
“Okay, let’s do this here. Don’t wanna have to explain what we’re doing to anyone, it’d be time consuming and, quite frankly, a little embarrassing for you.”
Tony closes his eyes and leans forward now, leaving a small kiss on Steve’s lips and staying there, silent, because he really doesn’t have any word of comfort or that could make the situation somewhat better. But then, much to his surprise, it’s Steve who whispers quietly: “It’ll be enough…” before returning the kiss.
This very quickly becomes the single hardest thing he’s ever had to do, and that includes assembling a suit from scratches in an Afghan cave and facing off a couple of alien dudes with nuts instead of brains. He spends so much time surrounded by people he frankly despises on a molecular level that pretty soon he has to start telling himself about how the plan is going to work out eventually, hopefully sooner rather than later; how he’ll see Steve again once this is over and maybe he’ll convince him to go on holiday with him, somewhere far and remote with no internet connection and no TV and no phone reception, somewhere they can be themselves and kiss and have sex and laugh and scream and be loud (or quiet) if they want to, without worrying that someone could be eavesdropping or stalking them or taking pictures. When eventually he snaps out of fantasy land, he grabs the pager and send a message, always the same number: 823.
what he’s supposed to do with his life. Using everything in his power to try and better the lives of many? Or maybe he’s just getting ahead of himself and is just a pretentious jerk. Jury hasn’t reached a verdict yet.

From his side, Tony can sense his self-control beginning to desert him, the impulse of pulling the other man to him growing stronger by the second, so he forces himself to go back to the couch, because this
“So, how can I help you?” Grey asks him, and although he resents this man on a deep level, he can’t but be relieved that he’s going straight to the point, saving precious time to both of them.
Steve stops now, almost abruptly, which gives him the idea that the other is holding something back. However, investigating it is going to have to wait, because right now he can’t get past the fact
“Wait, before that… I have something to give you.”
As long as explanations go, it sounds quite credible, so he doesn’t protest any further even if he’s not sold. Instead he grabs what looks like a pint of beer and gently clinks his friends’ glasses before swallowing half of the alcohol in one go. What’s the point in savoring your drink when it’s not going to change the effect it has on you? Still, as the beer makes its way into his stomach, he has to admit feeling a bit funny, although he can’t really elaborate on that.
“This song was in the top ten when I came out of the ice, just how old your playlist is?” asks Steve, frowning even though it’s clear that he approves of the choice.
“Yeah, as if I needed a—“ he starts, reaching for the bed, but he stops halfway when he’s hit by a sudden thought: “… oh.
“Never thought… I’d see you cry, Shellhead” he whispers, and Tony wants so desperately to laugh it off and tease him and act
But as time went by, and the weeks turned into months, nothing changed. Steve kept getting sick at least once every fourteen days or so, and although Joseph kept up with the injections, eventually he had to admit they simply weren’t working. Despise and frustration took over once again, only this time they didn’t find any external outlet – rather, they turned into self-deprecation, which pushed Joseph into a spiral of alcohol and violence, especially towards what he came to consider his biggest failure: his son. When the bruises became hard to hide, the school summoned both parents, demanding an explanation. That afternoon, following a particularly aggressive argument, Joseph got into the car and drove away, never to be seen again.
. As if time didn’t exist in this dimension, or if it went by so slowly to be imperceptible to the human soul. He doesn’t know which option scares him the most.
“Let’s go getting your suit back, Tony,” he says, already turning around to walk towards a jet.
Unexpectedly, it’s the whirring of the rotor blades that catches his attention before he has the chance to spot the vehicle, which comes into sight only a few seconds later; Tony takes a deep breath, feeling the sun burning against his skin, hot as hell, and takes a step back as the helicopter begins its descent, whirling sand around in every direction, and some of it even manages to end up in his eyes, supposedly shielded behind his sunglasses. He takes them off to rub it away, then puts a smile on his face as spotting Steve climbing off the vehicle and looking around for him, his heart beating so fast in his chest that he fears it might break it; he lifts up a hand, giving him a shout too for good measure, and before he knows it two strong arms are embracing his whole body, pulling him into a grip so tight that he feels like grasping for breath after a second or two.
of the team is over. He plans to have a chat with Carol the next chance he gets – once he’s pulled himself together enough to go through a speech without having to stop and swallow incoming tears – but until then, he feels pretty confident no major threats are going to emerge. After all, beings everywhere are going to be

instead of just watching hopelessly as cancer took her away, day in and day out. And so, on his sixteenth birthday, Steve had taken the subway to the Army Academy and had handed in his application, the work of almost eighteen months. A couple of months later, he aced his physicals and received a formal offer – by now his body was in full spring mode, growing at an exponential rate which a more scrupulous eye would have undoubtedly noticed. But as it stood, the Army was all to happy to enlist Steve within his ranks, and the doctor gave his approval without further ado. When 9/11 happened, Steve knew instinctively he had made the right decision, and started to grow restless to head to the battlefield overseas. But when he did, a couple of years later, excitement quickly gave way to disbelief, and then frustration (not much dissimilarly as what his own father had experienced, more than a decade earlier, although Steve couldn’t know this).  He tried to justify the wrongs he saw getting committed day in and day out, and then tried to get them to stop, still somehow believing that his fellow soldiers simply didn’t know any
He hears screams and cries and loud voices coming from
Steve crosses his arms over his chest – as if he needed to make it
“Waiting for it…”
Once more the doctor’s eyes flicker to the side. Tony recognizes uneasiness when he sees it.
“Tony, listen to me, we need to get Cap to medical attention as soon as possible. He’s the only one who got hit and… well, let’s just say he’s not in perfect conditions.”
There’s a perforating smell of dirt and blood in the air, the light is dimmed and the only sound he hears is the blip of the cardio machine recording Steve’s heart rate. So slow and sporadic that you could think it’s not working at all. Tony takes a deep breath and gets near the bed, his throat growing tighter with each step forward that he takes. The blood from the wounds – how many he’s terrified of actually counting – has irremediably stained the blue and white parts of his uniform, so that now it’s only different shades of red.

When his eyes finally open after numerous attempts, a dirty whiteness is all they can see, so the first thought occurring to him is that just a few moments have passed since the rocket – or whatever it actually was – had detonated on his shield. His head feels bare though, and he realises his helmet must have rolled off in the blast. He blinks a few times, trying to get his pupils to focus, but the more he does it, the more he becomes painfully aware of a piercing headache like he never experienced before. Which is to say something, giving the super soldier serum and everything.

About a month after that January morning, Joseph called his fragile kid into the basement, sat him down and gave him the first – and only – genuine smile Steve would ever associate with his dad. “I’ve got you, son,” he said just before sticking a thick needle into his kid’s arm. It hurt like hell, but Steve bit his inner cheek until he drew blood and didn’t make a noise. He knew he was a disappointment to his father and wanted to remedy that. The moment the liquid was all into his blood, he started to throw up, so Joseph took him into his arms and brought him to his bedroom, placed a tender kiss on his forehead and reassured him that everything would be alright, adding that soon Steve would be the one carrying him like it was no big deal.
it when that happens.
“Flowers…?” Steve manages to mumble, but Tony is already out of the lab, leaving the other alone with his thoughts.
“I have, yes…”
Fury has gone on talking as if Tony hadn’t spoken
, Tony thinks, barely holding a smirk from appearing on his face as, without further ado, he leans one hand on Steve’s back to let him step inside first, following him immediately after and asking the approaching waiter to show them the Danvers table.
“Precisely. The Stone is bound to come together again at some point. When that happens, someone will use it, hence setting you free.”
. It’s unwanted and painful and he wishes so much he could just push it away but he
“There is a matter I could really use your help with. Master Stark told me that you can’t make a lot of physical effort…”“That’s not true…” he sighs, but the butler doesn’t seem to take any notice.
“I’m putting together a team…”
“How in hell…” he begins, frowning, but of course, he already know the answer to that question: Nick Fury. “Did he tell everyone about it?”
“Tony…” Steve sighs, shaking his head as hearing Tony’s self-deprecation, but as their eyes meet he decides this is not the time to pick up an argument about that, so he switches back to his original train of thought: “You don’t want to stay?”
, but as he holds Steve’s self-portrait in his hands, he can’t deny that his heart is strongly disagreeing right now, because this guy is surely something else.
“Yeah, the first issue came out in the… Fifties, I think? It was quite soon after the war ended, that’s for certain.”
It’s the definitive way in which Tony is saying these words that’s now annoying him. He’s talking like he is his boss, which he isn’t. He’s talking like he was his father, which again, he isn’t. And he’s talking like he’s someone concerned about him, which... That makes him pause. They have been known each other for a few years now, and their relationship has always maintained itself on a strictly work level. Tony likes parties and loudness and crowds, whilst Steve prefers to have few friends over, a pizza and a beer. Moreover, when they’re not working, Tony is seldom around, and Steve can’t recall him attending any of the Friday evenings at the pub he and the rest of the Avengers enjoy on a weekly basis. In other words, he can’t figure out why his wellbeing would be of any concern to the other, besides from a merely working point of view.
“Please excuse the ramblings of a man out of time, Mr. Rogers,” Tony adds, reading in the silence following his words something that is not there. Steve smiles,
“Who is it, then? I’m trying to remember whom did you have a relationship with
, Stark. For what I know you’re still working on the Avengers deal, isn’t that so?”
“I’m right where I want to be…” Steve replies, shaking his head and slipping his index finger under Tony’s chin, gently lifting it up to look into his eyes. “… with
But Tony shakes his hand, depositing his credit card on the small metal plate on top of the paper: “This is not a real date though, so

“You’re so dramatic. Who said we want you to get drunk? It just works out cheaper to buy a few at once because it’s two-for-one. I may have had my money back, but I’m still out of a job for a couple more weeks. So if there’s a deal, you bet your ass I’m taking it.”
But before he can conclude what, without any doubt, would have been a very disastrous sentence, Tony’s elbow digs deeply into Steve’s side, making him shut up at once as his eyes turn to him.
“Fuck this shit, I don’t need to be protected, I need to know what the fuck is going on! I risk my life every fucking day to get this information out and then I don’t even know what I’m supposed to do with it because guess what?, I can’t give it to anyone, because there is nobody I can safely get in touch with! How is this a good plan, Nick?”
And that’s all he needs.

But before Rhodey can finish his sentence he closes the line and slips the phone back in his pocket.
“Forever is such a… human concept. You need to stop thinking in those terms. They are useless here.”
Mark giggles. It’s a nice sound – not too high-pitched, not too loud, and it makes his eyes smile too. Still, it doesn’t fill Steve’s heart like it’s supposed to.
“I love you, Steve.”
But as it turns out, Jean needs to input from him to press that button. Once she finishes emptying the till into the bag and passes it over to the robber, Tony detects her free hand casually stopping against the edge of the counter for just a fraction of a second before reuniting with her other one, still holding the bag.

“Morning, Mr. Stark, how are you today?” a familiar voice greets him some time later, just as he’s about to get inside the staff room to wear his jacket and tie, both of which he’s taken off during his routine as the May sun is already quite hot, and he’s prone to sweat anyway. He turns around to see one of the bank’s cashier, a middle aged man with no hair but a very thick mustache, stepping inside the building.
He nods – talking is still out of the question for now – and for good measure he puts his hands up to show he has no intention of grabbing his own weapon.
“Why did you stop?” Tony sighs, taking his hand away and looking at his companion, shaking his head in disapproval.
“Please, don’t use that word, I think my head is gonna combust on its own if I hear it just one more time…” he sighs, and the defeat in his own voice alarms him, because he doesn’t like how it takes so little for him to step back into the absolute oblivion of just not having the strength to go through yet another meeting where words are spoken in the futile hope to make things better. He needs to
“Edward,” he replies instantly as he shakes his hand, even though he had had no idea he was going to give his middle name. But he has no doubt the other hasn’t been honest in his statement either, it’d be stupid
He could swear he doesn’t hear Nat’s voice calling his name, but it must have happened all the same because his brain registers it, albeit extremely slowly. He snuffles and rubs the tears away from his face, blowing his nose before tentatively standing up, his legs shaking and not just because of the cold.
“Damn, I need to go, I’m late…”
“You too, Winghead.”
Although he stops there, what he’s not saying is explicit enough for Tony to grasp anyway:
one – or even just to change it up a little, but he had always refused, albeit he knew for a fact that wasn’t such a wise decision. But when a room is all you have left to try and fill the ever-growing void inside of you, how can you just give it up, listen to your brain talking and not your heart? Twelve months later, and he still doesn’t have an answer to this question, nor does he think he ever will. So not only he’s stayed in the same room, he hasn’t even touched anything
They sit down, and with impeccable timing the maître arrives, a couple of minutes later, to welcome them and hand the menus; Tony, who had thought it wouldn’t hurt to already make his choice beforehand, pretends to study his for a short while before fixing his eyes on the man sitting in front of him, clearing his throat (in what he hopes to be a casual enough way) before talking again.
, only real and, you know, homosexual. Yet another mess he’ll have to figure out. Will it ever stop?
“Okay, thank you. Uh… I’ll see you when I see you. Stay out of trouble. I’ll know it if you don’t.”
Tony lets out a long sigh of relief as Fury leaves the room, leaning forward with his hands on the table and briefly closing his eyes as he speaks: “I swear to god, he pushes all my wrong buttons sometimes…”
“Very well, sir,” the butler laconically replies, giving a brief nod before starting on his way back inside.
“This up close. It’s kind of amazing how it all… stays together, like, without any packaging.”
The position that he gets offered is, much to his surprise, of Secretary of Defense; which, although it sort of makes sense when you think about it – he used to be *the* single biggest provider of weapons after all, and he’s quite sure most of the people around the President still believes he
“What time is it?” he asks, hands frantically tightening the belt around his waist before starting to work on the buttons of his shirt whilst his feet try to slip into his shoes without any help.
instead of mulling over things which can’t possibly be fixed by words said on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere during a single evening – they end up making their way into their bedroom still debating over politics, the president and Fury’s plan, eventually falling asleep almost at the same time, Tony’s head on Steve’s chest, his fingers deep into the other’s brown hair.

but then he would have given in and kiss Tony back, because even though he claimed he wasn’t superstitious, that was their go-to ritual before any battle and it didn’t “feel right to tempt fate like that”.
It’s not just because he wasn’t expecting that episode to be mentioned (out of nowhere too) – he

in comparison – adding another one to the mix is not going to upset some crazy balance in the universe or anything like that.
, well I’m sorry to say you ain’t getting it. Now, if you don’t mind…” Steve then adds, gesturing towards the door, still open.
“This… This is beautiful,” he eventually manages, lifting his glance from the sketch to meet those azure eyes that have been impressed in his memory ever since he first saw them.
“I’m going in. You.” He gestures to the agent who was trying real hard to blend in with the wallpaper, obviously without succeeding. “Make sure this whole floor is free, I don’t want anyone else around, okay? Have I made myself clear?”
“You like this song, uh?”
“Not right now, we had to sedate him. Sir, if I may…”
“Thanks, um... What are you doing here?”
“I can’t say that it’s been a pleasure…” he starts, stretching a hand towards Fury all the same.

As to
Does Steve believe him? If he had any money, he would bet he doesn’t. He’s far too smart to fall for Tony’s poor performance.
“Yeah, I’ve done what I had come here to do, time for me to get on with my shit. Let the world know I’m still alive, much to everyone’s disappointment.”
“I wasn’t talking about sex…” he sighs, moaning again and feeling his trousers growing tighter around his groin as the touching goes on, words harder to speak out with clarity.
to be said. Going from being rivals, to friends, to lovers, to enemies had taken a big toll on them both, and when you add the crumbling of the entire universe as an indirect consequence of their actions, the weight was far too heavy for just two sets of shoulders to carry. Steve went back to the compound, and he went back to Pep, and when they saw each other at the funerals – dozens and dozens of them in the following weeks – they’d shake hands and exchange a word or two; about what to do, and when to do it. Without ever saying it out loud, he had left the wheel of the whole team to Steve, who had taken it with equal silence and begun to think what to actually

Steve smiles, and maybe he’s about to say something but before he can, a long shiver runs along Tony’s whole body, awakening from the kind of catalepsy he had fallen into.
Much to his surprise, the other man just smiles brightly, staring back at him as replying: “I love you too, Tony.”
They fall in another silence, and he knows it’s just a matter of time until Bucky voices his thoughts yet again, but luckily for him Sam comes back with plenty of drinks on a tray. Too many, in fact.

He’d wrap his big arms around his body and would peck his lips over and over until the shadow of a smile crept up on his face, at which point he’d turn into the hug to kiss him more deeply, body rubbing against the other to make him actually
Tony sighs deeply, passing a hand over his face to take a moment; he doesn’t want Steve in his room, he doesn’t want to hear the sound of his voice, or having the smell of his aftershave on his clothes; it’s all too much right now, and he can’t deal with this on top of everything else.
“Thank you. I figured… we need a reminder there’s beauty in this world, especially in times like these, you know?”
If he’s not going to be able to ignore it, that doesn’t automatically mean he’s going to make it

“Vibranium,” comes the explanation, “Strongest metal on earth, apparently. I remember my father mentioning it in passing, before the War started, and, well, I managed to get my hands on some. Turns out the internet doesn’t care that much if you’re allegedly dead, as long as you can prove you’re… not.”

to pilot the Iron Giant if he was to refuse, and Tony couldn’t take that risk. Especially not with a prototype.
“Yeah, I’ve been told…” Fury replies, quite disappointed, as he scratches his beard. “I’m gonna start working on some reporters on this side of the pond, see if international pressure has another sort of effect.”
“Why? It seems you already know!” he mutters, bouncing his fist on the table a couple of times before talking again: “I’ve been working with Banner, but as you know he’s in India and I can’t communicate with him from the office because I don’t want to risk revealing his location, so… The prototype should be ready in a couple of weeks we believe.

Although this would be far too risky in normal circumstances, something useful that he has learned in these past few weeks is that all communication directed to other countries’ high levels are protected by one of the best encryptions he’s ever seen; he has never had a chance to use it before, but this makes the perfect excuse. Even if someone was listening on in his conversations, that would immediately cease as soon as someone answered on the other end of the line. It takes him a good ten minutes, but eventually he gets put through with T’Challa and, although he hasn’t had many chances to speak with the king in recent years, it surely is good to hear a friendly voice.

“Where’s

For a couple of seconds, Steve loses any ability to do anything or think properly, it’s like he’s suddenly turned into a statue. Then, as he starts to feel a warmth spreading out from his stomach, he lifts his hands to cup Tony’s face and reciprocates the kiss, closing his eyes and smiling softly. All he can smell is Tony’s aftershave, and all he can think about is him.

Of course. He remembers now.
his eyes are, how their shade is so different than his own and how they seem to be staring right deep into his soul now.
“Pepper, listen to me, they're so annoying ! There is NO logic in what they're doing ! It's not because I got a few broken ribs and that my face looked awful for a week or two that they have the right to treat him like that ! I bet he regrets it hell of a lot anyway ! I don't think Bucky even talks to him ! I am so DONE with them all ! I'm trying to keep this damn team together, and all they do is tear him appart everytime I trust them not to do so ! Can you believe it ? I can't leave them alone for a  month, because apparently, if I avoid Steve they ALL avoid Steve ! I...”
“Whyaren'tyou'fraidofme ?” He mumbled under his breath.
“I did everything I could, I told him to leave Steve there, I told him to hide him, I told.. He wouldn't listen, he didn't obey.. I tried, and  no one was there, and I didn't know what to do, and now they're going to die..”
Yes, Tony was ok.

Bucky stopped at the entrance of what seemed to be an open space composed of the kitchen, the dining room, and the living room. Tony was ranting to someone on the phone, pacing.

“No one went to check on him ? I mean, doctors. Or at least a nurse ?” The physicist’s legs started to shake, ready to run towards Steve’s room.
--------------------
But it was too late. For both of them.
So hum... Hi...? Long time no see ? I'm sorry ?
---------------------
“Ok. Alright. We can work with that.” Breathed Tony, already thinking of ways to totally and finally get rid of the Winter Soldier.
“Hey guys” He called in the earpiece.
And Bucky wasn't oblivious. He could see Tony had lost some weight since he woke up, and that the inventor didn't like eating, but had seemed to savour his pancakes. It was strange, but Bucky didn't care. He felt really proud to be able to cook something that Stark enjoys so much.
The man went back to his car and sat in the driver seat, before pulling out his phone and calling the contact named “AZ”. The person at the other end picked up but didn’t say a word.
“No let me finish ! I’m not asking you all to care for real, because I don’t want you to, and you won’t anyway ! I hurt Tony. I hurt Bucky. Hell, who knows if Bucky will wake up one day ? Maybe I fucking killed him.” Steve’s voice broke.
His heart sank when he realized that he actually was.
/My mission./
“Is this school really that important to you, young master ?”
Half an hour later, Natasha stepped onto the communal floor, exhausted from her mission. It had been an easy, but tiring one. A quick look around the room informed her that Thor, Bruce, Clint had been waiting for her. She opened her mouth to say hi, but a crash coming from the kitchen interrupted her.

A doctor entered the room and said quietly : “He is waking up, sir.”
Steve opened his mouth to talk, but a warm liquid came pouring out instead, streaming down his jaw and throat. He heard rocks fall around him, and a body curled around him, as if it was protecting him. But Steve couldn't really tell, because he couldn't see anything, everything was black.
“Okay..”
'This is not happening, this is a nightmare' he thought as he watched the Winter Soldier getting shot by a dozen of robots as he ran, carrying Steve in his arms. This was too much like Sokovia, this was a dream. This wasn't real.
“Wha...? How old is he ?” Bucky was just confused now. Steve must be around 100 years old now.. And people still sent him on missions ?! Were they nuts ?!
“What about we call Sam to babysit him ?” Bruce asked as if the supersoldier wasn't in the room.
“I hate myself !”
The doors opened.
