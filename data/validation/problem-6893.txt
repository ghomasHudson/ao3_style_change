Steve’s pale, big hand lands on his shoulder, just over the red strap, and his fingers begin to toy with it, pushing it from side to side.
anything. I’d never told him about my feelings, and he’d never… I mean, I never knew if my feelings were reciprocated, and… by the time that I’d even had the courage to tell him, he’d left for Afghanistan, and then, he was… he was MIA. I’m the one that got the call from the Army. I just… I didn’t deal with it well, didn’t deal with the idea of him just being gone. I actually, I almost went after him, went to Afghanistan to look for him. I figured if the Army wasn’t going to do anything about it, wasn’t going to help him, just leave him there like some empty fucking body even though Bucky had given them his entire fucking life, I would do what they couldn’t. I’d go and find him.”
He even climbs up to the ledge one night, deep in his cups, and sways, before the drop between the window and the ground frightens him and he retreats back to his bed.
do you want from me, Steve? What more do I have to give you?” He pinches the bridge of his nose. “You haven’t given a shit about me in ages,” he says, with a savage, mirthless smile. “Why do you suddenly care about what I’m doing?”
He believes Steve when he says that he has never slept with this woman, that he never touched her except for some errant, deceptive kiss when he was a new recruit; he believes Steve when he says that he doesn’t have feelings for his partner in crime, but that doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have feelings for him.
James nods. “If you tell us when you’re scared, we can reassure you. That’s what we want to do, Tony. We want you to know that we love you and we ain’t leaving you. You’re it for us, you’re home, and we’re coming back every single fucking time.”
Tony has the abrupt urge to apologise on his behalf, but he’s more interested in watching this slow-moving car crash happen before his eyes, unable to look away.
Steve watches his body seize from the orgasm, watches it take a hold of Tony and leave him limp and trembling and dependent on Steve for anchorage, and he comes as well on his next thrust, comes hard and spills deep inside Tony, keeping him pinned there, pinned and squeezing Steve’s cock so tight that he loses the air in his lungs.
“I dream about you finding me like this,” Tony tells him. “In our bed, touching myself. I dream about you storming in and finding your husband riding some fake, plastic cock like a slut.”
Steve rubs the back of his neck. Yeah, I, uh, had to improvise a bit. The crowds I’m used to are usually more... twelve.”
“Don’t worry,” he reassures. “You're not gonna change into a… I don’t know.” He falters. “Okay, so, you won’t turn into Frankenstein, and the nurse over here isn’t Nurse Ratched.”
“Is it because I haven’t been around the block like you have? Is it because you want someone who has more experience? I can’t help the fact that you’re the only one that I’ve been with, Tony. I can’t help that you started having sex when you were fourteen and had a five year head-start on me. Is it because I’m not kinky enough? Is it because I’m not listening to you in bed? Is it because I’m boring, that I’m not satisfying your fetishes? Is it because you don’t find me attractive anymore? Have I outlived my usefulness, Tony? Has the novelty worn off now? Is it because you’re stressed at work? Is it because I don’t get your motor running enough before we have sex?”
He turns onto his back and stretches out his arm for Tony to shuffle back and rest against his side.
“Hi,” Tony says, breathlessly, the heart-wrenching mix of anxiety and relief clamping around his body like a vice.
When he stops shaking, Tony is breathing hard, and there’s a pleasant stretch to his thighs, his entire nerve ending shot to hell, and he’s grinning shamelessly from the hot, lovely rush of pleasure that makes the endorphins rush to his head. Before he even knows what’s happening, Steve is withdrawing from his legs, crawling forward to his head. His hand is around his cock, stroking firm, back and forth.
Steve grins, even if there is some sadness to his features. “Don’t take this away from me,” he drawls.
"Get yourself a glass of juice Tony", he quietly mimicked Steve while he popped open a couple of beers, then craned his neck around the open kitchen table to see the two men quietly talking. Oh they were talking about Tony for sure.
Steve nodded, but didn’t look relieved. They said their goodbyes, Steve told Tony that he could call at any time, then left. Leaving Tony feeling alone.
“It is what you need.” Steve told him, kindly but firmly. “This time if I catch you sneaking around where you shouldn’t, I will spank you Tony.” He added with a quirk of his lips. Of course he was just joking but he hoped Tony understood that he wouldn’t shy away from exerting his authority if Tony deliberately disobeyed him.
Tony was suddenly both aroused and nervous. He'd been spanked before, of course he'd been. He'd been whipped, flogged, paddled, even caned that one time. Which wasn't gonna happen ever again. But... Something felt different now. He felt more shy, almost scared.
But Steve didn’t miss the way Tony’s shoulders relaxed just the tiniest bit. Then Tony returned to the couch and held out the drink. Steve didn’t take it. Instead he picked one of the thin cushions off the couch and put it on the floor, right next to his feet.
“I feel.. ” but the omega didn’t finish the sentence. Rather Tony took a moment to think about it, his brows creased. Steve figured he either didn’t know how he was feeling or he didn’t want to elaborate on his heat.
"No captain, he's right." Pepper spoke up then. She had gathered the vouches from the ground and was holding them tight. "There's no way of getting the board to sign on canceling the document. The company has changed a lot since then, but some of the share holders still have problems with an omega CEO. They'd jump on the chance of robbing Tony of his shares if Tony comes out as omega too. Not to mention the dropping stocks. The only way for Tony to be completely free is to bring the document into the board. This way, the document will be put into effect only because Tony wants it to. The assholes won't have leverage on him anymore. I can get them to sign off on it."
Tony’s hitching answer was the sweetest of music to Steve’s ears and he bent to kiss the genius. Not gently, but slowly, forcefully, he pushed his tongue between Tony’s cracked but thankfully warm lips to taste him properly. Tony didn’t even put up token resistance, he stilled for a moment in surprise but then he pushed back, trying to kiss Steve back, his hands clawing at Steve’s waist and hips, wherever he could reached, trying to pull Steve closer.
He unpacked slowly, giving Tony time to settle and get used to being on his knees, reach that quiet state of mind. If Tony needed to go there, he would. If not, he would get bored and start cracking jokes despite Steve’s order to be quiet, but Steve guessed however much Tony enjoyed poking around in R&D, he still could use a break from the pretence and the people.
“Oh shut it. I wrote those protocols. Well, at least I already read them. I know you keep an emergency folder.”
Tony stared at the carpeting, arranging and rearranging the periodic table in his head according to various aspects of the elements. According to atomic nuclei spins, from thickest, to thinnest, at extreme temperatures and so on.. He could smell the food but he understood what Steve was trying to do. The alpha wanted to give Tony some space, in which he could just exist and do nothing else. Only, it took a bit of work for Tony to slow down his brain enough to breathe.
“Yeah. You can do that but Tony’s hurt bad, I think. It was mostly luck we got out of there in one piece and with the suit. He needs a full scan.”
The man was seriously impressive, built like an elegant machine with every muscle and snew working together to make it look like jumping rope is the easiest thing in the world to do, with the Captains toes barely touching the ground. He was jumping very fast but he wasn't even breathing hard yet.
Maybe he just didn't want to be seen submitting. Taking orders, obeying without an argument.  Like a meek little subby thing. He was proud to be submissive but he always hated the lost little lamb image submissives got. He didn't need a dominant, he didn't need orders or protection. He was Tony Stark for fucks sake, Ironman, billionaire, philantropist, playboy.. He didn't fetch drinks, people lined up to fetch /him/ drinks.
Tony's heart leapt but more embrassingly than that, his cock twitched too. He grabbed his cock self consciously this time.
Pepper was an entirely different matter. Tony already liked her. He knew she was an omega, and she was very competent, he had even noticed her glare down Steve. He could respect that. She was also nice and seemed to know Tony very well. Still, Tony thought, he would have felt more comfortable if he remembered her. He felt like he should. He also felt like he was letting her down all the time by not remembering. It wasn’t a good feeling.
"I was going for an omlette but the eggs insisted on being scrambled." Tony commented as he put the pan back on the stove and sat down to eat.
“I am. Yes. But at least in here, I’m in a better position to keep an eye on him.” He said and got up to leave as soon as possible.
Steve felt blood drain from his face. Tony, for the first time since his amnesia, had just called the Colonel, 'Rhodey'.
"What I've seen of you so far is a very smart and dedicated man. Generous to a fault and has absolute zero self preservation instinct. A loner all your life, simply because you've always been the smartest person in every room you stepped in, and feared for it. You feel people look at you and see money, which lead you to believe your worth is measured by what you can give out. The combination of all this, made you into a terrible team player with near suicidal behaviour. This, any of this, has nothing to do with the fact that you are a submissive, other than that maybe you find the lack of capable authority  figures frustrating. No one is good enough, or smart enough for you. No one is strong enough to bend your iron will, smart enough to know better than you."
Howard is still stoic, still looking as though nothing can touch him – Tony aches to remove that veneer, to rip it to shreds and rejoice in the ending of it.
“You wanted me to remember what exactly I have waiting for me here at home; you wanted me to come to the grand realisation that despite whatever life I might have beyond the four walls of this house, whatever distractions I may have found on the few occasions that I had the audacity to be away from this temple, my true purpose is right here, right? And if I came to that grand realisation while you had your cock inside me, well, that was just the double cherry on top.”
Tony looks up at the kids who are still sleeping. “Should we wake them up?” he asks, hoping that Steve will make the tough decision for him, because the idea of rousing them when they look so at peace twists something painful in his gut.
you; they might have… they might have made you exactly like me; they might have shoved you in that fucking chair and removed everything that made you
He’s not sure if he’s fooling himself, but if he buries his nose into the pillow, he can still smell Tony’s cologne, and it’s as though he can allow himself to believe that Tony’s just getting ready for bed, brushing his teeth, changing into his night clothes.
He spots Strange holding back the deluge of water from the lake flooding the entire battlefield, and it’s as though something is connecting them, across this moment, because Strange turns his head, catches his eyes.
His phone rings, and Tony jolts in the air, and his hand goes to where it’s vibrating in his pocket, fishing it out. He thumbs it open and answers the call, which is coming from Sam and Wanda’s landline.
Tony grins. “In that case, if Steve’s going to fuck you, I could suck you off, or you could fuck me. What do you want, James?”
Then, he sees him, sees Steve in that armchair, grey-skinned, dead, pale-eyed and devoid of life, handfuls of spiders still crawling all over his corpse.
“Yeah,” Steve exhales, “because there was some sort of mathematical error with one of the orders, right? You got a call from Pepper, and she asked you to come down and fix it?”
His clothes are in tatters, black with soot. He is gagged but his eyes are screaming, focused on the flaming river of black oil which is about to engulf her feet. Tony rushes towards him and dives and rolls through the flames, just as one not-dead Nazi opens fire behind him.
“I just… I told you, I wanted to see how you were doing. I mean, before, when we were all talking, and you–”
He’s not that sort of man; he wasn’t born that sort of man; all he knows is to give, never to seize.
“That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard,” Tony says, flatly. “Any going back to the conversation at hand, that is such bullshit. You were trying to
Tony, to them, can endure all manners of discomfort, but God forbid Steve go one night without a warm body beside him; no one, of course, had intervened when Steve had left him alone, night after night, for fucking months.
And then, because cooking in the Stark-Rogers-Barnes’ household, especially when the latter two are involved, either ends really well or really badly, the vine leaves go up in flames.
Beside him, Pepper is sobbing, and so is Peter. Rhodey is on the other side of Tony, and he’s looking away, as though looking away will do away with the fact that Tony is dead.
When he turns around, a low, startled noise escapes his throat, as he sees three men charging at Steve and James near the door. He hadn’t even seen them lurking in the darkness when he’d rushed to get the children, and he watches, clutching the kids to his stomach, so they can’t see, as Steve and James dispatch them quickly.
He doesn’t know whether he wants to be relieved or whether he should hate himself for that, for laying a curse on Peter’s head even before he was even born.
Steve sits up, glowering at him. “Do you even hear yourself?” he asks, incredulously. “Is that what you really think? That I
The parking lot outside the pharmacy is mostly empty, and Tony’s car screeches into a spot. He puts it into park and shuts off the engine, before looking at Steve, who’s already unbuckled his seatbelt.
A beam, coated in fire falls from the roof, right above Tony, and a warm, muscled arm sling around Tony’s waist, drawing him back against an equally warm, muscled chest just as the beam makes contact with the floor.
“Yeah, I think so too,” Steve murmurs, and he curls a hand around the nape of Tony’s neck, pulling him close so that he can press his lips to Tony’s brow. “Let me make it up to you.”
Nothing has been addressed between them; nothing is even acknowledged. Tony still thinks that Howard is a shitty father, and Howard still thinks that Tony is a disappointment for a son but is also simultaneously a victim of something horrible that he needs to protect.
, he thinks with the same slow, solid bitterness that is becoming more of a comfort to him than genuine happiness.
“I’m so sorry,” Tony says, holding a hand to his heart. “I know I’m late. I hope they haven’t been waiting too long.”
Jamie nods, his face changing through a series of expressions that Tony doesn’t quite know how to categorise. “Yeah, I can hear her.”
Steve’s hand closes around Tony’s shoulder, squeezing, before he drags him into a rough embrace, so that Tony can bury his face into Steve’s neck, smelling sweat and after shave and soap, and there are tears stinging at the backs of his eyes.
One of the Nazis hits him again, and the pain explodes across one half of his face, where the Nazi’s palm strikes. His cheek is hot, hotter than the sun could make it when the Nazi steps away.
“Hey, Cap, my brother says you took out four German tanks all by yourself,” one of the children says, excitedly.
Tony hits him on his shoulder. “And I suppose now they’ll know that you visited me. They’ll probably start tailing me too, and the kids, and Steve.”
Maushmi lifts her head, as she lays the knife down beside the cutting board, her eyes narrowed in suspicion.
be talking about him, thinking about him. I just… I’m still struggling with that.” He pulls back so that he can look Steve in the eye. “But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t talk about Barnes and Wilson if you want to,” he says, firmly.
That night in bed, Tony lays awake, putting the pieces of a puzzle together, the necklace, Natasha Romanoff calling at all hours during the day, the way she touched Steve like it’s a normal, frequent gesture, the seemingly kind offer for help with his marriage like she knows things a normal person shouldn’t know about a colleague’s marriage.
Tony cants his hips up, just as James snaps his hips forward, and the stretch and burn drags the air out of his lungs. He can’t help the frantic roll back against his cock, just as Steve’s hips stutter and snap forward against James’ ass, lacking finesse. Steve keeps going, keeps rutting into James’ body, a savage, desperate, wild look in his pale eyes, and James begs him for more, for
Steve grins and continues talking dirty to her. “Wish you could see what you look like, like this. Your pretty tits bouncin’ around, your beautiful fuckin’ pussy stretched around my cock like there should be films made about you, baby doll. You’re squeezin’ me so tight. Can you feel me? Can you feel how hard I am for you, how much I fuckin’ want you?”
Tony looks in the direction that he’s pointing in, and arrayed in a rough semicircle around the ship are ten German Wolf Submarines. All of their deck guns are manned and trained on their ship. Worse, at least five heavily armed boarding parties in rafts are closing quickly on the ship.
“I don’t want you to disappear from my life completely,” Tony says, stubbornly. “We can… we can be friends.”
“Because he’s dead!” Maushmi finally shouts. “He’s dead, Tony. Obadiah Stane is dead, and I’m sure, wherever he went to when he died, he’s suffering for it, so, you see, you don’t
?” Steve snaps back at him, baring just the slightest slip of his teeth. “I’m your husband. We have kids together, for fuck’s sake. You should be able to look me in the eye and tell me when I’m fucking up, Tony. You shouldn’t have to feel like you need to keep up appearances around me, those fucking masks of yours that I hate.”
He doesn’t know what he’d do if it was Steve or even James in that hospital bed, how he would even be able to function.
“Oh, I’m sure there’s some cult out there,” Tony tells him, dryly, and then, gasps, when the next thrust of Steve inside James, sends James’ fingers deeper into him, catching his prostate.
Tony’s heart swells fit to bursting with love for this man, the man that Tony loves so obviously and so certainly and so fervently.
Tony shakes his head. “You know you can lose the deposit for that,” he rebukes, observing them with a clinical gaze as best as he can with as much as he can see.
Tony stares at him, and there’s a shuddering sort of stillness in the air, as he sucks in a deep breath.
Tony opens the door, carefully, the air tight in his chest, and his fingers curl tight around the base of the candelabra, ready to bash it against the skull of the person on the other side.
Pipes are hissing above him, and there are a series of catwalks and platforms, made out of iron and steel, that he traverses.
Something soft curls in the empty spaces between the lines of his ribs. “Yeah, I am,” he says, roughly. “I am very proud.”
Steve’s mask cracks, and a smile blooms across his face. “Yeah?” he says, shyly, almost disbelievingly.
woman, okay?” she says, resisting the urge to smooth her hand over her hair, which would most certainly muss it up beyond correction. “The woman who prioritises the unimportant things and makes you feel bad for doing your jobs, especially when that job involves saving an eighteen-year-old girl from burglars or gangsters or general hoodlum-variety villains. I’m just, I don’t want to be
Instead, he slides a hand across the sheets, hoping that he seems adequately seductive but not too wanton such that Lord Steven begins to wonder whether he has bonded with a virgin or a whore.
The words are hot, lust-inducing, and make him hard, make him clench around the phantom sensation of Steve’s fingers inside him, and so, he feels all the instinctive physical, sexual reactions he’s supposed to have, because this taunting edge that Steve adopts during sexy times is one of his kinks as well, but for some reason, this time, his words don’t quite sit easy in his gut, draws some dark, acid chill out of his body.
Tony swallows past the lump that forms in his throat, unable to look at Steve’s pleading, pained face for a moment longer.
“You’re perfect,” Steve says, decisively, resolve in his eyes, and he kisses Tony’s stomach just to prove a point. “So fuckin’ perfect.”
Wanda tugs on his hand with surprising strength for someone who’d just been unconscious for the last couple of hours.
to have sex,” Steve goes on. “I’m just tired and overworked, and fuck, I hate the office, and Fury’s always on my back for something or another. I’m just… I’m just tired, I guess, and when I get home, I just want to relax.”
,” his mother says, reasonably. “Until you get over the shock. There’s… someone I want you to see, so you can get some help, so no one will threaten you anymore.”
“I love you too. I love you so much,” Steve says, with passion that borders on madness. “And I promise you, this asshole, whatever it takes, we’ll kill him, we’ll do it together, and you’ll get your fucking justice.”
He tracks up the footpath, noting each of the cameras that he sees hidden by underbrush and the tree line. Tony rushes back to the car, climbs inside, and flicks open his phone, and he finds the camera feeds in the council servers. He watches, with his lungs in his throat, as two men storm out of Sam and Wanda’s house, carrying small bundles underneath his arms, the grainy footage just showing enough that he can recognise Peter’s sneakers.
“He goes on conferences, and we haven’t had sex in ages, Wanda. So, I don’t… so, yeah, he’s cheating on me with this redhead,” Tony finishes.
“I didn’t think they were bad at the beginning,” James says, solemnly. “I thought they were my friends. Then, I realised that they were bad, and I ran away, and I had to stop them from doing bad things. That’s how I met your Appa. He helped me stop them from doing bad things when he was in college.”
Tony’s throat flexes. “Like I said, my best friend was brutally murdered in my house tonight. I don’t know how I am,” he says, dully.
He’s in the shower, resting his forehead against the tiles, so drowsy that he can hardly rinse without wanting to fall asleep. His eyes droop, sliding down to the tiled seat that juts out of the wall, resting his elbows on his thighs, his hands in his damp hair.
“No,” Tony says, quickly, bluntly. “No, you don’t have to do that. It just… it bothers me that you defend her.”
He lifts his body off the bed, rests his chin on Steve’s shoulder, buries his face in Steve’s warm, damp throat, and lets Steve fuck him, as the rhythm of his thrusting grows desperate.
Toni hesitates for an agonising moment. “I loved your daddy in a different way to how I love Steve and Bucky, but I did love him, Petey-pie.”
“Yeah,” Wanda says, dryly. “I hit him, and you should have seen his face, Tony. He was… so surprised, but so hurt, and I think that was the worst. He… he didn’t, he didn’t think I was capable of it, and honestly, neither did I. I stepped back, and there were tears in my eyes, and his hands were shaking. He looked… he looked awful, completely awful, and then, he left.”
When Tony looks over, James is rubbing his hands together, the skin stained with streaks of blood, and there are two other dead men on the ground between him and Steve, and Tony doesn’t know who killed who.
Tony holds a hand up to stay whatever protest is going to fall out of Steve. “I just…” he swallows against the involuntary tightening of his throat. “I just need some time, Steve. I need some space.”
“Yeah, I can imagine you just about died with humiliation. Were any of your SHIELD pals around when you saw me? I can imagine the shit they said to you. Were they appalled at your abysmal attempt to control your husband? Did you have to bluster and pretend like you knew exactly what I was doing the whole time you were away? God forbid if you turned your back on me just for a second, who knows what I might get up to behind your back?”
“No, he has come all the way to me. It would be unbecoming to turn him away. When the dawn rises, I will be his omega.”
He finally makes it to Sam and Wanda’s house, and he parks outside, climbing out of the car and rushing up the steps to their little cottage of a house. He pushes the door open, the hinge barely hanging on its screws, and the house has been completely ransacked, furniture thrown everywhere, things crashed and broken on the floor.
“This sucks. It’s allowed to suck. If you want to,” he clears his throat, a knot burning at the pit, “
James flinches. “I did, but I was also with your Daddy and Appa when they came to get you. I don’t know if you remember me-”
Tony runs his eyes over Steve, hungrily, checking for any wounds that need immediate medical attention. He seems unharmed, if a little tired, in body and mind; his uniform hangs filthy and torn, his shield battered and bent, but he lifts his head high, confident that he’d done the right thing in the end.
Warnings for this chapter: explicit sexual content, you might not agree with Steve in this because he sounds like a jealous dick.
Tony hesitates for a long, quiet moment, before squeezing Steve’s shoulder, the touch electric between them. Abraham helps Steve into the device, positioning him correctly before strapping him in.
of us, and I would’ve died trying to protect you, and you would’ve died anyway; they would’ve made me watch, so that I knew exactly what happens when I, the fucking
“Don’t panic,” Steve warns, his jaw set in determination. “There’s plenty of time for that later. Wave that at anything that slithers.”
“Fuck, look at you,” Steve rasps, his eyes locked on his hole swallowing up the fake cock. “You’re taking it like a champ.”
“The fuck is wrong with you?” he demands. “Are you so fucking insecure that you would screw over everyone else around you just to make you feel better, just for a second?”
“Because you seemed weirdly pleased that he was dead, and that made me want to laugh for the first time in years,” James says, bluntly.
Tony doesn’t like that, doesn’t like being the face of some phenomenon, so the so-called experts in the world can lay down their opinions on his relationships and his family and feel big and supercilious about themselves for passing judgment on people they don’t even know.
Tony shares his smile. “It would.” He shakes his head. “It’s a beautiful image. I love… I love the idea of it, the three of us content. I actually don’t… want to set myself on fire with the idea of the two of you being together, as much as I thought I might. But…” he looks away. “I love you, and I love him, and I don’t think we’re built strong enough for that yet. I don’t think he’s strong enough for it either. I think…” he pulls his lip in between his teeth, feeling like he’s aged two decades in the last two days. “I think we need to fix
“Would you… do you want me to,” Steve clears his throat, his pulse throbbing painfully, “would it be okay if I–”
Steve grinds his teeth, before his head flops forward onto James’ shoulder, where his metal arm joins his body, and his hand, the hand that isn’t gripping James by the hip to the point of bruising, slides down the panels of his prosthetic until he’s tangling his fingers with James’ metal one.
Because a part of him hopes, prays that Steve comes to him, tells him that he’s in love with him and that he loves their children and that their little family is always going to be enough for him.
Steve lifts his eyes, and they’re wet, and there are tears all over his face. “I’m sorry,” he says, roughly, his voice scarred. “You don’t… there is no obligation to forgive me-”
“I know a little of what that’s like,” Tony agrees. “To have every door shut in your face.” He hesitates. “Are you ready?”
,” Tony says, sharply, “no, I know what I saw, and I know what I think, and I think… I need to go and speak to Natasha. She’s the, she’s the only one who knows what happened in that bedroom last night, and we don’t, we don’t believe that she killed her, right? We don’t believe that Natasha killed Pepper?”
“I want to talk about what’s been going on at school with Peter and Maushmi, but first, do you have any questions for me?” Ms Lewin asks.
The alpha from the Stark Expo is there in the line-up, standing at the end, a head shorter than the rest, and Tony smiles at him, when he catches his eyes.
Tony bows his head and promises in a quiet voice that he will uphold the honour and pride of his house, his family, his people.
Tony sighs and rubs at his temples. “Now, I do,” he says, guilt cracking through the quality of his voice.
Tony clutches at him. “It’s good, good, don’t stop,” he orders, digging his nails into Steve’s back.
“He needs to be out there, showing the world what the American fighting man is made of.” Brandt turns to Steve. “Son, do you want to serve your country? On the most important battlefield in this war?”
Steve tells her about SHIELD, how and when he joined, when he met Tony, and how he was told not to say anything, told to keep it a secret. He says it shamefully enough and fully admits, even that early, that he shouldn’t have lied.
Tony drags his foot absentmindedly across the carpet. “You did,” he says, woodenly, and he’s having flashbacks to Howard, to how it felt to be Peter and Maushmi’s age and have the sudden realisation that his father doesn’t love him, not really. “You did make them feel like that.”
Steve pulls out of him with a punched-out groan, falling back against the mattress, breathing hard and heavy, slinging his arm over his face, as he finds it hard to get his lungs to function.
omega you are supposed to be. You will mind that smart tongue of yours around the alphas and any other officers. You will not behave yourself in a way that would bring shame to this family, to your bearer and I, and if I have even the slightest inkling that you are acting in an improper manner or there is something untoward going on, I will drag you right back here by your hair, do you understand me?”
“I am not having an affair with Natasha,” he finally says, a frown tugging at the corners of his mouth.
The alpha is different to the other alphas Tony has ever known; he’s shorter, with thin features, like a bird, skin close to the bones, the ribs showing in his figure, blonde hair short and flat, and his eyes blue like a summer storm.
He loosens the coat that he’s wearing, sliding his hand underneath the collar of his shirt to pull out the gold chain, a sun-shaped golden medallion, the exact same one that Steve appeared to be looking for.
“SHIELD has asked me to determine whether you work for HYDRA, and if you do, yes, they have asked me to terminate you,” Steve says, bluntly.
“You know, the one where you said that I looked like someone you bought and paid for; what, did you forget about that already?” Tony quirks an eyebrow.
“Hi,” Tony replies, with an unsure tongue, because he’s not quite sure what she’s doing here, standing on his doorstep.
Steve huffs and turns onto his back, so that he can pull Tony onto his body against his ribs, with Tony’s head resting on his breastbone.
He sees the body bag halfway down another darker, narrower hallway, standing up on its own dead weight. But just as he glimpses it, it tips and pitches headlong through a doorway, like a tree finally crashing down.
He makes his way through the corridor to the door. On his way, he finds a heavy candelabra sitting on one of the hall tables, and he wields it like one would a weapon.
During the night, Lord Steven refuses to touch him, even when Tony braves a hand on his hip, his belly, and even, stretches lower, before Lord Steven grasps his wrist, not in a tight, punishing grip, but a warning one, nonetheless.
Thankfully, he’d long-ago stifled his ability to show shame on the outside, and at 4:30, he’s climbing up the steps of the demountables, while the teacher’s 4:00 appointment brushes past him, and he keenly feels the empty space at his side.
“You didn’t used to be prideful around me, Tony,” Steve says, his voice measured, his face crumpling for a fleeting moment before it solidifies into something normal. “And I know I don’t have a right to be accusing you of anything, not when I’ve been lying for so long, but I don’t know, I guess-”
“Goodbye, Herr Stark.” There’s a deliberate pause, and somehow, Rumlow is able to speak with respect. “Steven Rogers... I wish you good fortune, although, I don’t expect that will be enough for you to get out of this one.”
about myself,” Tony whispers. “I used to… I was stripping myself naked in front of the mirror and staring at myself, at my body, and cataloguing all of my imperfections, all of the reasons why you didn’t want me anymore: my grey hair and my wrinkles and the new fat and how unsexy I must be when I was teaching the kids how to read
Coulson fumbles with the lock to the door, with Tony hovering at his shoulder. The three of them rush down the corridor, and that’s when they see her, Natasha, swinging from a bedsheet taut around her throat, her head limp, her eyes shut.
. We did it because we know how shit like this goes down in the court, because we didn’t want you to get up in front of everyone and admit to what happened to you; because we didn’t want your name plastered all over the fucking newspapers; because we wanted you to have a life without this hanging over your fucking head. That’s why we did it, and yeah, it was partly because Stane was a piece of shit that deserved to die. You want me to stand here and apologise for what we did all those years ago. Try fucking again, okay? Because you’re not going to find regret here. He was a fucking monster, and he deserved to die. He deserved to die in some miserable, shitty way, and I wish I could do it again, because despite what you may think, Tony,
A sad, untrue promise, given their history, but Tony appreciates the false sense of confidence that Steve tries to imbue in their kids.
He lets his hands skate all over Steve’s chest, the way he wanted to in that laboratory, groping the muscles, and Steve’s eyes are trained on him, on his hands. He moves lower, hesitating, because even with all of his lust, this is where his mind fails him.
There’s something there, something at the verges of what she says, what she doesn’t say really, that has something sharp and anxious clamping around his body like a vice.
. That’s all I did. That’s all I wanted to do. I just wanted to help you, to make you feel a bit better about what had happened to you, to save everyone in Boston and let them keep their dysfunctional, simplistic lives without realising what was happening around them. I just wanted to help you, and you were happy enough to let me help, and you fell in love with me. You
Steve’s fists clench hard over his thighs. “Because at first, it was too painful to talk about,” he confesses, the muscle in his jaw jumping. “When I first met Tony in that bar, I was just starting to move on from the fact that Bucky was dead. I… we’d never actually
Steve catches a dagger-wielding Nazi around the legs with the whip and flips him over his shoulder, kicking him in the head to make his eyes shut.
“We should go,” Tony says, quickly. “James is right. We don’t know if anyone else is coming back here.”
to be sorry about,” he says, fiercely. “You saved us. You saved all of us. Fuck, Tony, you saved the whole universe.”
“Oh.” Peter looks thoughtful. “Okay, then, when Steve and Bucky come over, I’ll give them a big hug and call them Daddy.”
A man kneels before him, his armour so fine and handsome that Tony blinks at it. He lifts his head, and Tony’s heart catches in his chest, as he thinks it is his alpha, when the man snatches up his hand and presses a dry kiss to the knuckles.
Tony somehow manages to break out of his indomitable hold, darting forward and picking the red-hot medallion up in the loose cloth of his shirt.
Tony closes his eyes. “It has to do with that dangerous thing I was helping him with, so I believe him.”
“Yeah,” Tony clears his throat, “a full serve, which is twelve dumplings; although, I’d be pretty happy if you got a half-serve of pan-fried, and a half-serve of steamed. And I want the chilli oil, so that I can mix it with the soy sauce and the vinegar.”
They have ongoing issues with that, and as many people don’t seem to mind the new dynamics to Tony’s marriage, the same amount of people have issues.
“I can promise you that Natasha is not more important to me than you are,” Steve says, softly. “She’s a friend, and I know she bothers you, and that’s
And at the end of the vows and exchange of the rings, they’d also exchange garlands – it’s not the ceremony that Tony’s mother would have had in mind (not that Howard Stark had ever agreed to do anything where a Hindu wedding may have been concerned), but it’ll have to do, considering he’s pretty sure that the Vedas or any other Hindu text don’t exactly cover what’s supposed to happen in a Hindu Brahmin Iyengar wedding with two guys.
“He… he’s been cagey the last few months,” Tony explains. “You’re right; he doesn’t spend much time at home, and he’s always… he’s always on a business trip or a conference or there’s always some claim that he has to work on, and for fuck’s sake, in what universe do they have a fucking conference on insurance claims every two weeks. It’s bullshit,” he says, full of fury. “He leaves really early in the morning and comes back really late at night, and it’s always the same excuse, that work is busy. No one’s work is
“Look, I don’t know where you’re getting this idea from that I’m not attracted to you. Hell, I can’t believe that
It comes out easier after the first time, after he’d told James, but the words still tangle somewhere in his ribcage, rip from his body like it pains him, like it’s him tearing an organ out of his abdomen and presenting it to the world.
Steve’s brow furrows, and there’s a tensing to the jut of his jawbone, his expression twisting for a brief moment in hurt and disbelief and irritation. “Do you,” he clears his throat, “are you two…
“You have no fucking idea what you’re talking about,” Steve says, venomously, and then, he’s standing, stumbling to his feet.
“You know,” Steve begins, casually. “Natasha was in charge of monitoring the surveillance devices, but I was the one in the car outside the guy’s apartment. I know exactly how often you went, how long you stayed, and the look on your face when you came out. When I first saw you there,” he shakes his head, “when I first saw you get out of your car and walk up those stairs and go into his apartment, I just about died.”
“I just… I didn’t mean it like that,” James sighs. “I meant it like… I didn’t want to hurt you, okay. I know people have hurt you, I know people have used you and abused you, and I wanted to be different. I wanted to be… oh, I don’t fucking know anymore,” he growls, tense in his shoulders.
Tony’s throat flexes around the lump that forms there. “Thank you,” he says, roughly, full of emotion. “You’ll never know how grateful I am.”
Tony shakes his head. “God, is any part of you even real? Has everything just been one fucking lie? Are you even from Brooklyn?”
Bucky’s throat flexes, and she watches as he peers down at the screen of his phone, flicking away the call. His expression shifts, when he reads the text message that follows. Steve has the same look on his face.
“No, no, it wasn’t, it wasn’t–” Tony rubs his arm absently, lost in thought, then sucks in a sharp breath, when the pain flares hot.
“I’m afraid an auction is not possible.” He pauses, purposefully. “Your fire is dying here, Herr Stark.” There’s a beat, and then, his voice lowers, threateningly. “Why don’t you tell us where the piece is right now?”
He makes to leave, to push past James, but James slides forward, his bulk becoming a stone wall that Tony can’t cross.
It’s never anything serious, never anything that Tony finds completely and utterly objectionable, and therefore, it is very difficult for him to say that Grant has acted beyond the bounds of propriety.
Phillips raises an eyebrow and points to the rank insignia on his collar. “You don’t get to give me orders,
“You don’t have an explanation for that, do you?” Tony says, almost satisfied, if it wasn’t for the dread sinking into his stomach like stone. “You can’t. You can’t possibly justify giving your husband and your
! And yes, yes, I know I’m culpable in that. I know I wouldn’t have felt like that if it wasn’t for my own fucking insecurity, but you
In his hand, Tony can see his phone, and he reaches for it, disconnecting the call before it can go through.
Steve wouldn’t do this, wouldn’t touch him like this, because this is how it begins, it devolves from here; this is how Ty started, and it ended with him being admitted into hospital with his body broken and bloodied and bruised and with his jaw fucking wired shut.
Tony peers up at him, his mind feeling as though it’s filled with cotton, and then, his expression flattens.
His eyes find the ceiling again; he ignores the way that Grant leaves stinging bites all over his body; he ignores the snap of his hips between Tony’s thighs, the solid, agonising pressure and girth of his cock inside Tony’s body, and he just prays that Grant will finish up quickly and let him leave, let him escape to his room, so that he can pretend that this night never happened, that he was never so stupid enough to come to Grant’s room like this.
A part of him wants to go straight to Steve, throw him the accusations, and demand an explanation, see him squirm as he tries to get out of it, to catch him in his lies, to feel the vindication when he finally admitted it.
“He said that if I only spent as much time on something that was important – the key word here is weapons, of course – instead of my fascination for robots, I’d be a great man one day. That was three days ago,” Tony replies, his voice muffled in his pillow.
Steve stares at him, unbearably soft. “If something happens to them, you’re not going to have time to kill yourself, because you’re going to have to kill me instead. They’re coming out of this safe and alive, Tony. There’s no other way out of it.”
“Well, Peter and Maushmi absolutely adore you,” Tony tells her. “They’re constantly talking about you when I take them home.”
But she wants him, she wants to spend her life with him, and who is he to say that she isn’t entitled to what she wants?
“No, no,” Steve says, quickly, “you look, you look like you needed them, or rather, you enjoyed them. I’m happy that you… you enjoyed them.”
Tony runs for it again. The hall monitor staggers up behind him, bleeding profusely from his eyes and ears.
“If you want more, go upstairs. I’m going to go and throw the oatmeal in the sink, before the fire department gets called, because the last time that happened, I had to open the door with a blanket wrapped around me because I didn’t know where you threw my clothes, and that is
And then, Steve is forcing him to back up, back up until his back hits the wall. One of his hands cradle his face, smoothing a thumb over his high cheekbone, while the other pulls the strap down as far as Tony’s breastbone. And then, he pushes down the other.
“I shouldn’t… I don’t know if anyone told you, but we went to that garden that Nebula told us about–”
Steve drops the bag down onto the floor with a heavy thump and rubs the back of his neck. “I just had… I had a lot of paperwork to get done by tomorrow,” he explains. “My boss… Well, you know Fury, he can be a real hard ass about things like that. I just wanted to finish it up, you know, so I wouldn’t be struggling to finish it tomorrow before the deadline.”
turned Steve into this?). “Don’t make me say it out loud, or I might break something,” he says, darkly, grim-edged.
“I thought of doing this to you the moment I saw you in that courtyard of your castle. Not like this, of course. I didn’t want it to have to come to this, but I wanted you,” Grant says, hungrily. “I thought about fucking you, the way you’d look when my cock was inside you, the slick you’d leak, and yes, this isn’t how I wanted this to happen, but I’ll take what I can get, especially with you being so fucking stubborn.”
“I’m spoiling you, I am,” Tony declares and picks him up, settling him on Tony’s hip as well. “We are going back to bed, and the two of you are going to get a little more sleep before we begin our weekend, okay?”
Phillips purses his lips. “I spoke to the President this morning. As of today, the SSR’s being re-tasked.”
Rhodey is Tony’s best man, and Pepper and Happy are his groomspeople. There’s a gaping hole where he might have asked Peter, but he doesn’t allow himself to linger on that thought.
“Steve, I love you, I love you very much, but you’ve kissed James twice this morning, and I haven’t kissed him in years.”
Steve opens his mouth, even stretches his hand out to catch Tony’s, but Tony dodges it expertly, making his way out of the room and up the stairs.
James rolls his eyes. “Look, this is going to be dangerous; there are going to be guns and fighting and probably dead people. The dead people could include one of us,” he looks at Steve, fleetingly, “and call me crazy, but I think your husband and I are in agreement on one thing, which is that we don’t want anything to happen to you.”
Coulson cocks his gun, and Tony jumps in between him and Natasha, ensuring that Coulson can’t fire his gun without harming Tony in the process.
Steve nods, his expression solemn and strained. “He’s gone home to take care of a few things back at his apartment. He told me to tell you that he’d be back later, that he wanted to give us some time to talk, even if we haven’t had such a good run with that in the past. He doesn’t… he doesn’t really remember me,” he says, his voice pained. “I think he… he has dreams about his life, his old life, the one where I’m there too, but he doesn’t… he can’t really talk about solid memories, not yet, at least. He says that he gets more and more, the longer he’s away from what HYDRA did to him. But…”
Tony likes that, likes the physical, subconscious proof that Steve wants him as much as Tony wants him back.
“I… I guess I wanted to try a different bed,” he offers, helpless, schooling his face into an appropriately light expression.
Steve leans forward, eagerly, now that there’s some hope. “A bronze piece, about this size. In the shape of the sun, probably broken off at the bottom, has a little hole in it, off-center. Does that sound familiar.”
“We need to speak urgently,” Tony says, briskly, pushing past him so that he can enter Grant’s chambers, preferring that no one can hear their argument.
Honestly, Tony’s a little glad that it was Natasha who bit the bullet and ended up saying that, because the terrifying expression that finds its way onto Steve’s face makes something curdle in Tony’s belly, akin to fear or worry or some strange blend of the two.
There are revels afterwards, feasts and drinking, and finally, a bedding in which Tony is placed in Lord Steven’s bedchamber, without a stitch on, after he has suffered the groping of the alphas around him, poking and prodding at his naked flesh, making tawdry jokes about his legs and his nipples and his ass and his cock.
. I hear that a lot from the people who show up at the VA, Tony, and a lot of them aren’t even the kids’ primary caregiver. I know that
“Yeah, and frankly, no one would blame you for having either considering your husband can barely stay at home longer than six fucking hours!”
for a son, in a savage, unkind voice that draws all the colour out of Steve’s face. He goes on to say that if Peter had wanted to do Little League or something less gender-aligned like guitar, Steve wouldn’t have a problem, but God forbid that Strong-Man Steve have anything less than the perfect macho son.
For the first time, in a very long time, Tony actually thinks everything will actually be fine, that there is something good waiting for him at the end of all of this shit.
“Oh,” Steve’s eyes are as big and round as the moon. “Shit, sorry. Nat, this is Tony Stark, my husband. Tony, this is Natasha; she’s a friend from work.”
And then, there’s a man on top of him, huge and shadowing and heavy, pressing against his hips, wearing a grimy old sweater, a hat pulled across his scarred face, not low enough to hide strings of salt-and-pepper, greasy hair.
Tony drops the folder, leans over the nearest bucket and vomits into it, vomits until his chest is aching, his throat is sore, and his eyes are flooded with tears, which drip and drip and drip, running like rivers down his face.
Tony has never heard him sound like that, never heard anything but the most perfect American newscaster accent, perfectly plebeian, something that no one would think twice about when they heard him speak; now, he talks like he was born and brought up on the streets of Brooklyn, that thick twang overtaking his voice.
“I’m on my way. I should be there in twenty minutes,” Sam says, briskly, and he’s unhappy, Tony can tell, when he puts the phone down.
Tony’s tongue runs teasingly along the seam of him, which is shiny with a pearl of pre-come, and it tastes salty on his tongue, while his fingers press at the skin right behind his balls. He pulls back, letting his mouth lap suck at the head, quick and gentle
“We have reason to think there might be something weird going on,” Steve says, keeping up the lie without missing a beat, even if his personal opinion is that Tony is a lunatic.
“You are unbelievable,” Steve declares. “You are so fucking unbelievable. You’re trying to hide the fact that you’re fucking someone else; you’re trying to hide the fact that you’re a fucking terrorist, like your boyfriend, and you’ve been using me as your fucking beard this whole fucking time, so you’re turning it back on me. You’re accusing me before I have the chance to accuse you, right?”
Tony peruses the cabinets, one by one, until he finds one full of files, which he begins to rifle through.
“You are the important thing in our life, okay?” Bucky says, firmly, and Toni feels her lungs constrict in response.
Tony’s smile is as thin as a blade. “It was the same one,” he explains, carefully, his voice sharp like flinders. “It was the same chain that he bought me for my birthday, suited for a woman, of course, but the same chain.”
Tony nods, and a knot forms in his throat, but it’s not painful, not aching, not like what it was before Eshe delivered her explanation – he feels more content now, content that he has confirmation that he
, sorry for dying, sorry for saving everyone because it meant that it was his death, sorry that he was leaving Steve, and then closed his eyes forever.
And then, he grabs Hodge’s dinner knife and slams it right between his legs, slicing through the seam of his fatigues around his crotch, but avoiding flesh.
“Neither do I,” Tony says, coldly. “That piece of shit had to die. But I saw everything, and something tells me that whatever fucking programming that HYDRA gave you was telling you to off me too. The drunk girl was negligible; there was no fucking way that she was going to remember anything the next morning. Am I correct?”
The sudden touch to his dick makes Steve startle and drop the book, staring at Tony, over the rim of his spectacles, like he’s a pod person lying in bed with him.
“It’s not,” Tony agrees. “But there isn’t much I or anyone else can do about it. This is what the world is right now.”
He makes suggestive comments about how Tony intends to spend his next heat without his brother there to make it all better.
alpha, his mother would throw him out onto the streets without a second thought), “my name is Agent Carter. I will be supervising your induction today.”
“His ma gave it to him. It used to belong to his dad,” James says, suddenly, and his face cracks wide open, as he tries to comprehend why he said that and why he knew that.
Pepper looks up with a flinch. “Fingernails?” She laughs a little, a nervous edge to her voice. “That’s amazing, you saying that. It made me remember the dream I had last night.”
Steve turns, abandoning the pot just for a moment. His face trembles, before he gets a hold of it. “You remember?”
“I’m an engineer; I use crowbars for all sorts of things, and I had quite the collection in that apartment,” Tony tells him, his voice sharp like flinders.
.” James bares his teeth. “I turned my back on HYDRA a long fucking time ago. The only thing I’m interested in right now is burning them to the ground for everything that they’ve taken from me.” He pauses, meaningfully. “And it looks like you’re part of that.”
“You were… you were never like them; I never thought that about you at all,” Tony murmurs, folding his hands in his lap, making a soft noise at the back of his throat. He looks away. “You were really affected? I wasn’t just being a needy slut?”
“Oh, I know,” Natasha says, brushing past him without any need of an invitation inside. “I just thought this would be a good chance for us to bond.”
. I think, any nuance or politeness aside, that would have been a much better way to find out than watching a video where your best friend chokes my mother to death,” Tony says, caustically.
Tony climbs to his feet and offers his hand to the beautiful redhead that his husband couldn’t stop looking at. “Hi, nice to meet you,” he says, kindly.
“Do you even hear yourself? You sound like a child. Hell, Mouse and Peter are more mature than you are.”
“Appa,” Maushmi says, joyfully, twisting one of her little hands in Tony’s dark hair. “We missed you. When we came home, you were sleeping. Daddy said you weren’t feeling well. Are you feeling better now?”
“I’m at hour seventy-five,” Tony mutters. “I need something strong, Steve.” He looks at him. “How about you?”
“No, I just…” Tony closes his eyes, willing his pounding heartbeat to slow in his chest, “I want the main spectacle,” he explains, a little embarrassed.
He slides knuckle-deep with some difficulty, and then, there’s two fingers filling him so full, so tight, stretch skirting the edge of pain. Tony moans and grinds back against his hand, his fingers fisting in the sheets. Steve curls his fingers, almost searching, and then, the pads of his fingers manage to rub against his prostate gland, and Tony grunts, banging his fist against the mattress.
Feeling more nervous than was reasonable, Tony pulled his jacket off and draped it on the arm of the couch. What would be the sort of punishment Steve Rogers would give? Tony couldn't guess. It could be very painful, it could be hilariously vanilla... Tony was not inexperienced by any stretch of the imagination, but how unreadable Rogers had always been about his sexuality and the mystery of it was scary.
And after that Steve would fall asleep imagining holding Tony close, kissing every mark he left on the darker skin of the smaller man, comforting him and telling him that everything would be alright, Steve was there for him now and he would never have to pretend something he was not, ever again. He would tell fantasy!Tony how he admired him, how strong Tony had been until now, but he didn’t need to be anymore. Steve would take care of him.
“I suppose you’d know a thing or two about waking up to a foreign world. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude. I was just curious.”
“It was my fault. I should have seen you needed help. I was the one closest to you for the last week. I was the one to decide to bring you into the HQ only after seven days to adjust. You probably could, if it was just the memory loss, but it’s not. So believe me when I say you did well Tony.”
“Tony. At the border.. You didn’t seem.. It didn’t look like you were..comfortable with the SHIELD team and Coulson. ”
He spoke, eyes darting everywhere, but when he finished he looked up to see Steve's eyes had gone stone cold. Tony had seen that look once before, when he'd blown up at Clint. This was the look when Steve masked his feelings. It was blank. And it looked so very wrong on the normally earnest face.
The dom gave him a small, close lipped smile, with crinkles appearing at the corners of his eyes. Not for the first time, Tony thought the guy was unfairly handsome.
Tony opened his mouth to retort then closed it. His thumbs hooked into the elastic he slowly lowered the shorts until they dropped to around his ankles.
Minor urine play. Not even play, urine just makes a brief appearance. It's not a fetish for either of them.  You've been warned.
“I told you, I would never rape you. If we’d had sex, it would have been rape.” He said clearly, and forced the words to come out without anger.
Steve paced some more as Pepper curled up on the couch.  An old and forgotten document, written by the hand of a dead and beaten man. It still hounded Tony’s steps. And more importantly… Tony was an omega??
"Medium rare." Steve said, enunciating each word, making it clear that he was setting Tony a challenge.
“Yes sir.” The AI replied but after ten minutes lying in the stifling heat, Tony still couldn’t feel a difference in the temperature. He couldn’t sleep in a room so hot, was the AC malfunctioning? He pressed his palm to his hardness to ease off the feeling a bit. It only caused sparks to shoot up his spine, making him feel terribly horny for more. He was so sweaty, maybe a cold shower would help, but when he moved to sit up he felt himself get a little wet between his cheeks and like a stroke of lightning he understood what was going on.
“We’re going home.” The captain said and Tony didn’t bother to listen to the rest of the conversation. He focused on Steve’s body heat chasing away the cold of the dark void. He put his palm on Steve’s chest to feel how strongly the alphas heart was beating, telling him in no uncertain terms that he was not alone.
Tony turned the words over in his head, trying to make sense of it. Of course they were on the same side, they were on the same team, weren't they?
“Well,” Tony started with half his mouth full, “Pepper is cool, you know. And the robots here are awesome.” He swallowed before adding the rest more quietly, “It’s a distraction. Takes my mind of worrying too much.”
Steve gave him a helpless look, "Well, yeah. But I could already smell something was wrong. And the timing of your heat.. "
He rolled over to take a peek at Steve's bedside clock and the digital numbers shined red to tell him it was a little past 4 am in the morning.
“It smells more..intense..” Steve felt himself starting to blush, “I mean.. Is it normal? And I think it hit too sudden? Something seems to be off.. I’m just saying because maybe we should take Tony to a doctor. I understand why you don’t want to..”
"Tony.." Steve gaped for just a second then he rushed to the omega. "What.. Where have you been?"  He moved to hug Tony but stopped himself short, unsure of where he stood with the genius once more. He ached to grab Tony and run basically, but he wasn't so far gone as to slam Tony into walls either. Tony though, could apparently see the state he was in, with Steve's hair disheveled from running his fingers through it, his face flushed and breathing hard.
Tony knew he should be angry, probably. Frustrated. Well, he was frustrated but it was a dim kind of frustration, not the kind of indignant frustration he'd feel if he wasn't so .. unhooked. He recognized the feeling as a very superficial form of subspace.
"I know you don't see me as your dominant yet. You still think of me as your field captain. This week is meant to help change that. For us to get to know eachother in a different way." The fingers curled in Tony's hair and pulled, Tony went with the pull until he was guided very close to Steve, still between his spread legs. Then the hand in his hair pushed his head down to rest on one knee and Tony gave into that too. Rogers' cock was straight in the line of his sight in this position but the man didn't seem to be hard. Tony couldn't decide if he was releaved or disappointed.
Tony had started to back away the only direction he had, into the shower stall, Steve followed him in, crowding the sub to the wall.
And Steve, they had told Tony that Steve hadn’t even known until recently. Now Tony could make sense of Steve’s behavior at the border, then why he had looked so surprised when Tony had told him that he knew Steve would protect him. But it didn’t explain why Steve had waited for him in the hospital.
“I.. Tony.. I was trying to help you. Do you remember what happened last night?” He asked cautiously. Jarvis had intervened before the hypothermia had reached truly critical levels but Steve didn’t know what sort of damage the cold interruption to Tony’s heat might have done.
Tony just sat there soaking up the praise, body flooded with endorphins, dopamine and oxytocin. After taking a proper spanking from a dom as strong as Steve, everything felt unimportant. He felt like he didn't need to worry about anything, everything was so basic and simple. He could just sit here.
"What? Then why did I even.. I could have just made a sandwich in the first place-" Tony whirled around to face Steve, creamy water dripping everywhere from the wet plate in his hand.
“Good. See? Easier to just be quiet and accept. Let me handle lunch.” Steve’s hand found it’s way to Tony’s throat then, caressing and soothing lightly, then up to cup Tony’s cheek and Tony sighed, finally relaxing.
He didn't even see the gag till it was right up in his face and then in his mouth, pushing his jaw open.
A second and third spurt followed, Steve's hand alternating between stripping his cock and stopping. Eventually the dom sighed, letting his cock go.
The hand in his hair tightened and Tony's heartbeat picked up, maybe he shouldn't have said the last part.
“Hey Cap.” He smiled at him widely when he spotted Steve. When the woman did also, she huffed a little and with a short goodbye left Happy’s side. Happy looked after her a little wistfully but still turned to Steve when he strode up to him.
Hesitantly he laid his palm on Tony’s cheek, smearing blood, feeling queasy at the feel of Tony’s blood on his hands but he did try to concentrate on the feel of warm skin beneath and took a deep breath. Scent of blood and fear was heavy but it was normal when there was fighting going on. Still, Tony was definitely alive.  First order of business, get Tony out of here, in the suit. He’d have to carry him but Steve could do that easily. Only trouble was, they were a long way away from the border. Then he would have to take the armor off and administer first aid. He could do this.
He turned in Steve’s loose hold to put his fingers on the impossibly handsome face of the alpha and Steve sighed at the feeling. Tightening his hold on Tony, the alpha smiled before opening his eyes. Tony’s fingers drifted to Steve’s smiling lips and Steve kissed them. It warmed the omegas heart so much for a moment that it was almost painful, like he wouldn’t be able to contain himself.
“Tony! Are you alright? If you don’t answer me I’ll have to break your door!” He called through the thin piece of wood.
"And," he started, pressing himself back into Steve, "I didn't miss the fact that you're actually wearing your service uniform." He swayed a little just so he could rub up on the alpha and with a slight flush rising  to his cheeks Steve held him in place to stop the rubbing.
It was too much. He wanted Tony too much and Tony needed him too much. Rational thought and his moral objections suddenly seemed far away compared to the feeling of Tony’s submission just under his hand, and Tony’s scent, shifting from ashamed to a combination of content and aroused.
"I'm not that young anymore." Tony said, just to have said something, keep the conversation going. His didn't manage to sound very conversational however.
"Oh shit" he tried to say into the gag but was grateful that it was too garbled to earn him more swats.
Tony usually  avoided even thinking about this. He didn't get scared, scared was a word that didn't exist for him. Denial, however, was a word that very much existed in Tony's vocabulary. Right now, though, he wanted to talk about it. He wanted Steve to know, he wanted to be exposed, known and understood.
Her hands slide down his bony chest, and her breasts bounce a little. He can’t help himself, and his hands close around them; he runs his thumb over her dark nipple, a darker shade of brown than her skin, but not too different, and she bites down on her lower lip.
He tells him vulgar stories of alphas and omegas engaging in lewd behaviour and pretends that they are just jokes, and that it is Tony that needs to let go of that damnable chasteness of his, when everyone in the lands know that there is no possible way that Tony could still be a green boy.
He slips and falls, ends up banging on his knees on a pipe, lands on his back, staring up, dazed, at the ceiling that appears to stretch for miles and miles and miles.
“You cannot hold yourself to such an impossible standard,” Tony replies. “After all, you did not know what was happening.”
“Oh, yeah, because they treat me so lovingly in the States,” Tony says, derisively. “At least here, I am among my countrymen, and I know how to get by here. And if I go back, I will go back with money. They’ll know me, Rogers. They’ll know they can’t treat me like shit ever again.”
Tony nods. “We have a ship. A friend of mine operates one off the coast.” He hesitates. “Bhim has to get back to Maya and Pavitr. He can’t stay with us.”
He twists them mercilessly, skirting the edge of pain, and Tony gasps, lurching off the bed at the sensation.
Steve nods. “But that wasn’t the first time I’d seen him. I’d seen him in the park, and he was teaching this little girl… she wasn’t allowed to play with the boys, because they were pretending to fight with swords, and she didn’t know how to. So, he sat with her and he taught her to strike and dodge and defend, and then, he watched proudly, as she went back in and kicked all of their asses.” He laughs. “I thought he was a good guy, so I stalked him a bit, saw him running around the memorial at the crack of dawn, and I joined him, went running past him. God, he hated me for it–”
Tony kisses him again, presses their foreheads together. “You and me, Steve, I promise,” he says, softly.
Tony shrugs, as his fingers slide into his body, biting his lip against the stretch, as his insides shift to accommodate his fingers.
“I don’t want it,” Tony whispers, and then, with a surge of courage, he picks up a penknife that he sees on the table against the wall, brandishing it like a sword. “I don’t want you. I want Steve, and he’s the only alpha that I’ll ever want. I didn’t want
“I took one look at you, and any… any strength that I was trying to muster to do what SHIELD would have wanted me to do, I… I couldn’t, I just couldn’t. I was hurt, and I was so fucking angry, but…” Steve looks away, the lines of his body knifelike. “But I didn’t care what you’d done to me. I didn’t care if you’d been using me. I would’ve let you walk out of here, even if it was with the Winter Soldier.”
“Do you trust that we’d be able to pull it off?” Steve clarifies. “Tony, I… I know you, and I love you, and I trust you. If you tell me that we can do this, that it’ll work, then, I’ll back your play.”
It takes some manoeuvring and a few yelps from the other two men in the car, but he makes it back into the driver’s seat, his hands closing around the steering wheel.
Peggy shakes her head. “With respect, sir, I don’t regret my actions. And I doubt Captain Rogers did, either.”
Steve’s jaw flexes, and he clambers to his feet, stretches his hand out for Tony to take. “Okay, then, let’s go and talk to her.”
Tony is helping Peter and Maushmi do their homework, when JARVIS alerts him to a new presence on the grounds.
All four Nazis look in surprise towards the front entrance, and Tony’s eyes follow them to see Steve standing there, whip in one hand and a gun in the other.
He makes a disappointed noise when Steve finally withdraws his fingers, trailing those slick fingers back down the inside of his thighs. His hand curls around Tony’s lean, muscled thigh and drags him down like a sack of potatoes, which makes Tony yelp, so that he can perch Tony in his lap, his legs splayed out on either side of him.
She leads him away to his quarters, one hand around the bloodied metal staff and the other hovering near the small of his back, and Tony falls a little more in love with her in that moment.
He thinks Bucky and Sam know about what he does; he thinks they’re so loyal to him that they don’t say anything, or maybe they realise the good in what he’s doing.
But Tony catches the small edge of worry in his voice and resolves to talk about this more with him once the kids are settled back at home, safe and content, even if it will take a lot more to rid themselves of the memory of this ordeal.
Tony rolls his eyes, and he buries his face in the nape of Steve’s neck, as he takes them forward towards the kids’ rooms.
“I know that you used me,” Tony retorts, a breathless ache in his chest. “I know that you’ve been using me for years. I know that you stick your cock in me like I’m some fucking
The technicians undo the straps, and Steve collapses into Abraham’s arms, who staggers under the weight of the newly-born strong man.
“They wanted her to let me go. She and my da fought over it a lot. They didn’t want my parents to get attached to me, because they were so sure that I was going to die. After a while, my da started to believe them, because I got sicker and sicker. But I’d always get back up again, and Ma believed in me. Ma believed I was strong. I wonder if we fed each other like that, like it was a vicious circle. I’d get sick, and then, she’d pray, and then, I’d get up again, and it happened like this over and over again.” He looks away. “Maybe it would be better if I’d just died.”
“Well, that depends on how reasonable we’re all willing to be. I want Rogers, and I want the gem, and I want safe transport to England.”
“No, no,” he sobs, a brief, incoherent noise slipping out of him before his voice tapering off into a thready whine. “No, it’s not real. It’s not real. He’s still alive,” he forces himself to repeat over and over again.
“Please, sir, please, don’t stop fucking me with the vibrator,” he says, sweetly, his eyes half fluttering shut. “Fuck me full until I come all over my stomach and the bed, and then, you can come on my face and my chest, ruin me for everyone else, prove that you’re the only one for me.”
The frat boy righted himself on his two feet, brushed imaginary dust of his stupid polo shirt, and scowled hard, his face transforming into something resentful and sour.
Tony snorts. He’d be surprised if Hodge understood half of the words that Agent Carter had just said.
By midnight, Tony has figured out a way to travel back in time, and he’s torn between dancing like Tom Cruise in Risky Business and going up to cuddle with his husband and go to sleep.
Tony waves a hand dismissively on his way to the kitchen. “I am rich; we can order as much oatmeal as you want.”
Tony’s head falls onto Steve’s shoulder, and Steve’s fingers are filling him perfectly. He nuzzles at Tony’s throat, humming, rubbing at spots in Tony’s body that make him burst with pleasure. Tony growls and pushes Steve’s hand away.
He goes on to talk about Natasha, and Tony holds himself bunched tight, like he’s going to fall to pieces if he lets even an inch of himself from his binds. He tells Eshe about their relationship,
“He doesn’t remember, sweetheart. So, I need to be able to show him, to prove that this isn’t just some trick.”
“Trust me,” Steve says, firmly, resolution clear in the line of his jaw. He pats the shield pendant which fits against the winged shape of Tony’s collarbone. “I’ll kick his ass.”
you or cut off your limbs and your ears and nose and bludgeon you until you were unrecognisable, and they would’ve made me
Tony sighs, taking pity on him, and stands on his toes so that he can press his mouth to the edge of Steve’s. “I think we should see how this date goes, and then, maybe by the end of it, boyfriend might be appropriate,” he offers.
In the months that Tony has lived within this castle, he has not seen either brother particularly fond or attached towards one another – in fact, if it weren’t for the fact that Grant was a spitting image of Steve, Tony would have easily believed that it was James and Steve who were the brothers, with the care and attention and familiar banter that the two men shared.
He slips off Steve’s lap and plants himself in James’, winding his arms around his neck. He leans in close, nudging his nose against James’.
Lube runs slick down his thighs and down James’ thighs, and it makes their fucking, all three of them, exceptionally wet, especially as Tony is breached, split open by the blunt pressure of James’ cock pushing deep inside him, and slowly filled up, and James follows the same action.
Tony smiles at him. “Just need to catch my breath,” he tells him, as the pain in his throat starts to relax. “I’m old, remember?”
Steve’s face contorts into an expression of agony, and he slips off the couch, crawling towards her, landing in front of her on his knees.
“The police are saying that she was jealous, Natasha, I mean,” Sarah says, quietly, “and apparently, you guys told them that they had a fight at lunch.”
Tony is wiping down a puddle of whiskey when, in a corner near the fireplace, a glass shattering against the ground alerts him to a fight breaking out between two drunk soldiers, or rather, two drunk shadows in the low light.
“It was better for you if you forgot,” Ana murmurs. “If… none of this had happened, if Pepper and Natasha hadn’t died, you would’ve moved on with your life. Tony, you might not understand why we made the choices we did, but we did it for your own good.”
The heat rushes up Tony’s body, settling between his legs, and he’s wet, his thighs slick, and Steve exhales, breathing him in deep.
“That’s not completely true,” Tony says, hurriedly, and both of them look at him. “He… he has dreams of Steve. He… he thinks he knows him but doesn’t know details, you know? It’s like he… I guess, it’s like when you see someone on the street and it’s like déjà vu, they seem so similar, like you’ve met them before, but you don’t know where you know them from.”
The killer manages to snare him with his other hand, and the two crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers.
“The guy didn’t let it go at that point; he said: ‘Maybe you should make me, dude,’ and laughed, like he was fucking Jay Leno. Steve just raised one of his eyebrows and picked the guy bodily up by the collar, and wow, was that one of the hottest things I’ve ever seen, his muscles flexing under his leather jacket, and I looked up from my bottle of tequila just to watch the alpha-male anthropological study in front of me. Steve, he told the guy, super calm, like he was discussing the weather, that he would beat his ass into the wall, and the frat boy quite literally start squealing like a fucking stuck pig, thrashing in mid-air against the grip that Steve had against his collar.”
“He got along well with all of you. He would play with you, laugh with you, tease you, and you loved it, presumably because you knew, even then, that Howard would never do those things with you,” Maushmi says, bitterly.
that he would leave the world together. He and I… we were always meant to be together, but at some point, I left him behind, and I always thought we’d make it back together at some point, but we never did. He just left, left me alone in this world, left me alone to navigate a world which didn’t have him in it.”
. I’ve never… I never…. I didn’t think I was capable of loving someone the way I love them,” he confesses, lamely.
“You burned down my bar!” he accuses Steve, shoving at his shoulder. “You’re going to pay for this, Rogers. I swear to God–”
“Oh, my God, oh, my God,” he stammers, fisting his hand in his hair, before he realises that his hands are drenched in blood,
Whatever Natasha may have done doesn’t mean that she is exempt from empathy by virtue of her shitty upbringing, and it doesn’t mean that Tony isn’t obliged to show her that much of human kindness at least.
Steve nudges his nose at Tony’s bonding gland, mouthing at the sensitive skin, and Tony makes a choked-off noise at the back of his throat, the sensation spreading right through to his belly. Steve snaps his hips forward, lingering there, Tony’s hole dragging at his cock.
“Blame me for Bucky.” Steve shuffles closer, perching on the edge of the seat. “It was my fault, Tony,” he says, pathetically earnest. “It was my fault that he became the Winter Soldier.”
Natasha grins, fleetingly, showing her straight white teeth. “You’re right.” She falls silent. “I don’t have feelings for him. Not romantic, just friendly ones. I love him, but I’m not in love with him.”
“-I think the guy might be coming for you, yeah,” James says, wearily, covering his face with his hand.
Peter shrugs and starts fidgeting with his hands. “I don’t know. I’ve never called them Daddy before,” he reminds her, solemnly. “Amma?”
Jarvis nods at Tony’s midriff, and when he looks down, there’s a knot lodging in his throat, because there are four, long slashes up his shirt, cut as though they came from a surgeon.
Tony, on the other hand, slips into his anger as easy as a second skin and accuses Steve of not wanting a
, our kids, so fuck off. I’m not in the mood for your attitude right now, okay? This is all I can do. The kids aren’t here, are they?”
Steve kisses him, kisses him so hard that Tony thinks that his brain is leaking out of his ears. He scrambles for a grip on Steve’s shirt, just as Steve hikes him up the screen door, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist. He slings an arm around the base of Tony’s spine, so that he can free one of his hands to open the door, kicking it in when it doesn’t budge.
The wire fence crackles underneath Tony’s spine, and the hand around Steve’s tie loosens, so that he can drape his arms around Steve’s shoulders.
Tony shrugs. “Wealth doesn’t make that easier, you know? When people treat you like shit, and you begin to internalise it, and it’s all you know when you think about yourself.” He clears his throat. “After a little while, I met Steve at a bar. You were there that night, remember?”
that you’ve got some idea that I judge people on their appearance, that I only like and am attracted to one kind of person. You have no idea,” he laughs, harsh and grating, “you just… you made an assumption, made an assumption about
The lift ends its journey, waiting for them to exit, and Tony absentmindedly scrambles for the handle to pull the gilded door to the side, so that they can leave. Steve doesn’t seem like he’s in too much of a hurry to let go of Tony, and he yelps, when Steve’s abdomen braces, and he’s being lifted into the air.
“Because I know what… I’m just trying to be considerate, okay?” Tony says, defensively. “Look, I’ve seen the files, I know… I know what you have, and sexy times
Tony kisses him, his fingers on Steve’s smooth, high-boned cheek, before he presses his forehead against Steve’s.
Tony smooths back Steve’s hair, especially when he noses at the dip between his thigh and groin, at the thatch of dark pubic hair at the base of his cock. He sucks in a deep breath, when Steve wraps his hand around his cock.
Steve grabbed Tony then, swinging a leg over him to cage Tony between his arms and legs, under him. He pushed a hand beneath the omega to squeeze an ass cheek. Tony whined deep in his throat and Steve leaned down to bite him.
He managed to slide in right as the doors closed. To his credit, Tony didn’t even look annoyed about it other than his eyes widening slightly. Which sort of annoyed Steve.
"It's not even dark yet." Steve said. They were under a half tent, in a meticulously designed garden, surrounded by high fences tastefully hidden behind climbing ivy.
“Steve. He made the decision to spend his heat with you. Even if he recovered his memories, I highly doubt he’d run away from you. For all his faults, Tony is a man who owns up to his decisions.”
Tony took a couple of distrusting steps and as soon as he was within reach of Steve's arm he felt his world tip over and found himself looking up close at the kitchen floor. He had the shortest second to feel the cool morning air on his butt when his pyjama bottoms were yanked down, then it was firey hits raining down.
"I want to suck you off so badly." Tony murmured in his ear and Steve shivered. "While you're dressed up like this. All authority and power. And I could be naked and on my knees for you. Wouldn't you like that?"
“What do you mean what! How stupid are you, spangle brain? I’ve been throwing myself at you since the day you jumped on that ambulance with me at the Turkish border! I could smell you and I know you could smell it on me! All you did was reject me! Every time! I drove you out of your own office! You made it plenty clear that you wouldn’t touch me until… Until I have my memories back? When will that even be? Will I ever get my memories back? Who knows, but as far as I know, I did anything short of begging to suck your cock and you always said no! I wasn’t about to guilt you into fucking me and use some out of control pheromones to do it!”
“You know what I mean. I’m ok with it. I think there’s nothing wrong with it. I wanted you to know that.” He said finally, feeling stupid under Tony’s amused gaze.
"You want to suck my cock Tony?" he asked. Tony licked his lips, and adjusted his position. He very badly wanted to plaster himself all over the glass stall, but he'd been told to kneel and he really didn't want to be kicked out of the bathroom now.
“Agent.. Banks.” Steve interrupted him, remembering the name. He was trying hard to keep his cool. “Do you think if Tony Stark wanted to access files above his clearance level, he would go about it like a common thug? Sneaking into senior agents rooms and fiddling with paper copies? I assure you, he is more knowledgeable than you about the surveillance systems of SHIELD and if he really wanted to break into your data storages, you wouldn’t even know about it.”
But somehow he couldn’t. Only years of ingrained training and experience had stopped him from dropping to his knees when Steve shut the car door on his face. Then the simply hurt look Steve gave him when Tony basically told him to fuck off...
"You can rest for a bit now." The dom lead Tony over to the pile of mats next to the mirrors and Tony sat down. He nodded, his hands limp in his lap. Fingers kept carding through his not very clean hair. And it felt good.
"Acceptable." Pepper answered as she raised her chin but Tony could see the smile she was trying to suppress.
An antsy feeling started to crawl up Tony's spine. Was Steve trying to imply something? He had woken up in Steve's bed and forced himself not to dwell on it too much, at least before coffee. But it was harder to do when Steve was right in front of him.
"Cecil Grant." Steve answered. To Tony he sounded distracted, Tony wondered what he might be doing sitting behind Tony with a fantastic view of the engineers ass presented for him.
Tony, was just standing there, in front of the elevator, in a pair of casual jeans and a jacket, with his red glasses pushed up into his hair, a bunch of papers hanging slack in his hands and staring at Steve with his jaw on the floor.
Tony nodded again, "Yes, yes, I'd love that too! I'll love every second of it, I have so many tricks that you'd absolutely love, I can drive you insane, I'm so good, you have to let me show you!"
Still, Steve saw him in a different light. He tried to be subtle about sniffing the air when Tony took the seat across from him while Fury explained some new system of operations combining the efforts of the Avengers and SHIELD personnel, warned Tony a couple of times about team play, complained about Thor and Steve could smell nothing but expensive cologne. Again, as usual. This time though Steve understood why Tony always put so much of it on. He was the only omega on the team. Natasha was a clear alpha, Bruce was more subtle about it. Clint was a straight up beta. And Thor, didn’t really fit in any orientation. Even most higher ups on the SHIELD command chain were either betas or alphas. Tony stood alone. And he did stand very proudly, Steve had to respect that.
There was a long silence after that and the Captain neither pressed Tony on it or even repeated the question. He just sat there, cradling the subs body and petting him. Tony was grateful for the space. It allowed him to find the courage to continue.
“It’s about his memory loss.” He clarified. “I asked Director Fury to let him spend his time in SHIELD HQ because I thought the familiar environment might jog his memory. I know it’s not ideal but he needed to get out of the house and going into work at Stark Industries would have been riskier. At least here, if the news of Tony’s amnesia leeks out, we can do some damage control. At SI, it could mean anything from dropping stock prices to board of directors trying to push Tony out of company management.” And not only because of the memory loss, if Tony ever slipped. Of course he couldn’t tell Coulson that.
His heat had been close but he had thought it wouldn’t hit him at least until after midnight. Then he had turned into a pumpkin. Happy hadn’t been there when he had reached the limo but his clothes had already begun to burn him, choke him, his skin itching and vision blurring.
Tony blushed. It took a moment but then he opened his mouth, choosing not to question too closely how ridiculous he probably looked. Steve’s hand came back and the next moment all he could think was how delicious the prawn tasted and how hungry he had gotten without realizing it.
What a load of bullshit. There was no such thing as a safe alpha. Alphas didn’t keep you safe, they used you, hurt you, stole from you, they wanted to own you, strip you of your humanity. Tony despised the vision he must have provided Steve at that moment. Shame burned hot in his gut, causing tears to blur his vision this time. He had clung to Steve like a helpless limpet, as if this dumb military kid had all the answers to the universe. And it had felt good.
“No he is not sick.” Pepper cut him off, her hand dropping from his arm, “Now if you’ll excuse me Captain.” She smiled tightly at him and effectively ended the conversation as she turned away to mingle with a new group of people who approached them.
"I get it, you're bored." Tony had no idea yet, how he'd come to fear these words. Steve poured a glass of water then grabbed Tony around the elbow and hauled him to his feet. "It's time for your punishment."
“What’s going on here?” Steve interrupted as he strode into the room, the documents he was carrying forgotten in his hand, he didn’t stop until he was standing between the angry agent and Tony. Steve vaguely recognized the guy, he didn’t usually work with the Avengers, still important enough that Steve should probably know his name. He was late 40’s with a receding hairline and a bulging stomach that showed lots of years gone by pushing papers rather than doing field work. He was also an alpha.
"You did remarkably well with the obstacle course and I did promise you a reward." He nodded thoughtfully. "Alright, you can have a notebook and a pen. No computers, tablets, or phones though. No internet for now. You can have one of my notebooks."
“You’re not alone now Tony. Listen to my voice. Look at me.” Steve sounded calm and strong. His alpha. His alphas voice.
"What about the massive stock transfer Captain?" A male voice yelled at Steve, "You own Stark Industries now, isn't that right? How do you think it'll effect the company? Did you ask Mr Stark to quit his job?"
He'd spent most of his ten minutes sitting on the bed in his underwear, contemplating what he wanted to do. He could still back out. The government still had to let him keep his suits. He could keep on doing his thing solo. It would save him a lot of money too. But he had gotten used to being part of something, someone having his back. The thought of going back now felt so lonely and a little bit like defeat.
When he was gone Steve had to take a moment to remind himself, again, that the colonel was in fact a good, decent man, only concerned for his friend.
But Steve didn't touch him again, for a long time. Tony waited with bated breath, eyes closed tight. Nothing.
Tony nodded. It was pretty easy. He was naked but the room was warm, the floor was pleasently warm, holding pennies against the wall was kind of ridiculous but it was very easy. Not being an idiot, he got suspicious.
"Yeah, no kidding." Tony breathed. When he dropped the towel aside though Steve was holding out a piece of cloth.
Steve took a step back, not because he was intimidated by the colonel but mostly because he felt the colonel had a right to be so pissed at him.
"I'm going to spank you now Tony. I know you've said it's ok in your check list but this is not just going to be a couple of swats. I'd like to confirm your consent. What's your color?"
"Already moved onto work, have we." He stood up from the bench where he'd been lifting weights and toweled his face and neck. Tony couldn't help but track a drop of sweat as it disappeared under the neck of Steve's shirt.
Tony might know that Steve wasn’t his alpha, but it didn’t change the fact that Steve was the only person he remembered, putting him in the position of the only person Tony trusted.
“I can see you’re hard you know. I can even smell it from here.” Tony commented but he didn’t sound smug, he just sounded like he was pointing out the obvious.
No matter what his instincts urged him to do, he was not a simple animal. He had responsibilities. He was responsible of Tony as much as he was responsible towards SHIELD. And this.. This might just be the best kept secret in th history of American intelligence.  Tony Stark was an omega and nobody had even suspected anything.
"How do they feel about all your conquests?" Steve did not feel a pang of jealousy when he asked. Absolutely not.
There was just something about mirrors. It had started out innocent, of course. Simple fascination with his reflection as a child. Who was that staring back at him? Oh, right, that was him. Tony spent hours at a time making faces at mirrors, trying to view himself at different angles. Setting mirrors up around one another in order to create infinite reflections. It was all in good fun.
"Hey Steve," Tony replied after a moment, gesturing to his rag tag bunch. "This is Rhodey, Clint, and Bruce."
"There's no pressure for this," Steve said firmly, reaching up to cup Tony's cheek, searching his eyes. "I know that everyone has been.. pushy.. I want you to want this because you already did, not because they talked you into-"
Finally both Steve and Tony were back under control. Tony met Steve's eyes once more, goofy grin now absolutely refusing to fade away.
"Don't waste time on my apartment, Buck, tell me when you got back into town!" Bucky had been touring vet hospitals, talking to wounded warriors and helping them through whatever he could. It'd been at least four months since Steve had last seen him, and he wanted to catch up.
"Hey shell head, are you listening to me?" Steve asked, removing his arm from Tony's shoulder to instead place his palm on the top of Tony's head and give him a playful shake. "Tony? You in there? Can you help me set up the chairs?"
your love. With Bucky and Steve, though? He didn’t respect it. He idolized it. It was the sort of love that you never wanted to see broken. He could listen for hours to their stories (and did, on more than one occasion) and watch the way that Steve’s eyes crinkled when Bucky called him doll, catch the subtle way that Bucky seemed to melt whenever Steve touched his hand in passing conversation. It was something good and pure, and Tony thought to himself that when he fell in love one day, that was the sort of love he wanted.
Steve was yanking him up by the hand, pulling a very, very stunned Tony towards the floor with a flushed, determined face. It was fucking adorable, if Tony was being honest. Adorableness aside, he'd kind of just stolen Tony's thunder, and a glance back at the table found the entire group shaking with held back laughter. Assholes.
This escalated rather quickly, to the point where Tony was actually screaming at Steve rather than reverting to being cold and cruel as he typically would. Steve was being a pretty good sport, but he was only human and so after a bit he started to sneak in a few comments that he knew would only fire Tony up more. Steve's version of sneak was actually more so bluntly throwing things out there without any sort of tact, but oh well. The point was, after about ten minutes of this they both finally fell silent, and Tony stared at him with his jaw clenched while Steve gave him that typical look, arms crossed.
On the other side was Bucky, and the moment Steve saw him he was grinning. The two exchanged a quick hug before Steve realized Natasha was along with him.
Another few moments of hopeful waiting and Steve took the hint- and the key- and headed back downstairs to his own home. He pushed open the door and looked around. Looked like Stark wasn't kidding. He hadn't touched anything. Hell, it didn't even look like he'd sat on the couch. Steve, on the other hand, flopped into the spot easy enough and spent the rest of the night trying to think of what to say next time he ran into his neighbor.
"Good, because I'll be honest, I was kind of afraid we might get into a fight and.. I mean, look at you. Shit." This did earn a laugh, and Steve realized with a start that they were still pretty close. He stepped back, and the stranger in his doorway stared. "I.. I should let you into your apartment. Shit. I am so sorry. Here, lemme." The guy stepped back, into the apartment once more, and Steve followed.
The thing was that the kiss had been great and spontaneous- and then it had been over. Tony hadn't known what to say, Steve had been blushing too furiously to even bother, and none of the others were around to call them on that shit and make them deal with it. In fact, as far as Tony knew none of the others were even aware. Because nothing had been said up to this point, Tony wasn't sure where they stood. He'd done his best to just act like they normally did. It was normal to kiss your best friend spontaneously (actually Steve had been the one to do the kissing and could Tony just say, wow) when you were worked up over a really exciting day of beating the shit out of super villains.
"So the first time I was willing to overlook it," Tony said casually. "But if you're going to make a habit of this kissing thing-"
He’d never forget their first conversation. He’d never forget any of them, he was convinced, but it had been such a nice moment.
know he didn’t want to miss out on any just because of something silly like.. Preparing to take over a multi-million dollar company. Who had time for that?
Tony did, waiting for Steve to resume his kisses. For a moment there was nothing, and Tony glanced to the mirror with a hint of irritation. He saw Steve by the nightstand, grabbing the bottle of KY. Oh. Well, that made sense. They were going to need that.
"Fuck you," Tony said, and eyes lit up as he realized how clear the words came. Throat still protested slightly but that was alright! He was much better now! Now Tony was the one with the smug grin, and he sat up in a rush. "Hah! So take that Capsicle, I'm fine now. What was all the smug shit talk earlier?"
The second finger met some resistance, if only momentary, and Tony’s erection gave an impatient twitch. Tony wanted it now, needed it now, how could Steve be so cruel? How could he make him wait? Why, Steve, why won’t you just fuck me? And it was then that Tony realized he’d been saying all of this out loud, because Steve laughed and pulled the fingers apart, pressed as deep as he could manage. Tony let out a groan, trying to push back onto the knuckles even though he knew he couldn’t.
"You better quiet down or you're going to have a sore throat in the morning." Steve was smirking, and that was really making Tony's mood even worse because honestly how was he supposed to be angry at a face like that?
"Weren’t you just complaining about being late?" Steve pointed out. "We’ll be even more late if we have to pick out new clothes because these are wrinkled."
Instead Steve took a long breath, dragging his hands onto the table and touching the ring that Tony hadn't gotten a good look at yet. It was simple, exactly like Tony would expect. A silver band, but in the light he could see a streak of gold that seemingly ran through the center all the way around. It was hard not to stare.
So here Tony was, sulking in the woods around a camp fire. Except he was quick to insist he wasn't sulking, even if everyone else was really enjoying picking at him for it. The thing was Tony was trying to be a good sport about this. He was trying to suck it up. But he'd forgotten how different the sky was when you got this far away from the city. The stars were so bright, dammit. They were getting closer. They had to be getting closer. There was no way he was imagining that.
"Well why’d you turn around?" Steve asked, and there was that tone bordering on downright seductive and still somewhat playful. Tony was shocked into silence.
"Alright, well what about Puppis there?" Steve continued. This one seemed to get Tony's attention, though he wouldn't admit it was because he'd never seen that one. "And Canis Major."
For a moment he’d forgotten Steve was still in the room, and Tony looked away from his own eyes in the reflection of the mirror to gaze at Steve’s. He was sitting on the bed behind Tony, tying his shoes, and Tony realized after a moment that he’d been standing at the dresser staring at himself rather than tying his tie.
It said something for Tony's stamina that he held out as long as he did with that hot cock driving into him. Every man has his limit, though, and although Tony tried to talk himself down he felt himself reaching his peak quicker than he wanted. His words became jumbled, and Steve adjusted the angle of his thrusts so that he was driving Tony down into the bed. He pulled back to watch Tony, the way Tony's breath hitched and his body spasmed, and after a few more moments Tony was calling out Steve's name and losing himself. Steve wasn't far behind, throwing control to the wind and grasping Tony by the hips as he reached and then rode out his own orgasm.
"Uh.. I wasn't a virgin exactly. I fucked my fair share of betas and omegas." Steve felt a rumble rising from his chest at that but Tony went on, "But you were my first. First alpha who got to enjoy my ass."
Sorry for the long explanation inside the chapter, it wouldn't fit in notes but based on the reactions I got, all of it had to be said. Other than that, thank you for reading.
It was well known in the business world that one did not mess with Pepper Potts, the omega CEO of Stark Industries who always looked so demure and submissive next to Tony Stark, and who could also rip the metaphorical throat out of any rival companies in the blink of an eye. Right now, in front of the cameras, she was the perfect bland of a strong omega who also held up the traditional values.
“But if you won’t think I’m being too forward Captain, may I ask, why don’t you let Ms Potts handle this? Surely, as his close friend, she’d be in a better position to take care of the problems his amnesia is causing.”
Another male voice broke through his anger, rewiring all of Steve's circuits and Steve dropped the colonel to turn around and see Tony. The colonel fell on his feet a little unsteadily and coughed.
"It's alright Tony. It's so good of you to ask for help, you're being so good. I'm so happy with you."
There was a reason no dom stuck around, even when Tony was Steve's age. Now, just because Steve was too decent to turn down a charity case, he was stuck with the broken sub.
"Fuck yes it's unfair! I am the only submissive in the team. When someone else fucks up, they get reprimanded, a slap on the wrist with a 'Better luck next time.' When I fuck up, I have to be collared and supervised by a dominant? How's that fair? Then there is the fact that no matter what kind of dominant SHIELD assigns to the task, that dom's never gonna understand what it's like to be an Avenger, why I do what I do, or... " why I feel how I feel, he could have said but he realised this was devolving into a too personal a conversation. He did not wanna go there. "You know what, never mind." he said instead. "Apparently you volunteered for the job, so lets make a deal, you enjoy plenty of free blow jobs, and I'll enjoy privacy and autonomy. How about that? FYI, I have no gag reflex." Tony wriggled his eyebrows at the mirror.
"You.. You haven't?" He tried to say but Steve waved him off, choosing to hand Tony a glass of room temperature water.
Steve made them go upstairs to his apartment for the shower, instead of using the gyms showers. This should have been a huge clue to Tony that he had plans.
Tony nodded vigorously. His own dick hurt, but he didn't really care about that anymore. Steve looked like a god behind the glass, perfect, delicious, unattainable... Hit every button in Tony's submissive psyche.
And subsequently, he had never felt his orientation so undeniably before either. Like he had a place in the world. He felt secure and sure of himself. For once, he knew where he should be without a doubt and it was right here.
Steve had to try not to grind his teeth. So this was what it was going to be like between them now, a pissing contest. Steve knew, considering where Tony had knelt all evening, there was no real competition but he would respect Tony’s choices. And to be fair, he could understand the colonels concern after finding an alpha in Tony’s house, who had just told him he had spent the night after learning Tony was an omega. No matter that the said alpha was the colonels childhood hero.
When Tony was finally done, the colonel sat back and crossed his arms, looking serious. Steve had nothing to add to that but he knew Tony was right. It was also one more reason for Tony to be living in fear. But Tony being Tony, he wasn’t letting it get to him.
After Fury was done with explaining and assigning work, he dismissed them with a nod and a swirl of his leather coat he left the room. Natasha turned to discuss something or other with Clint and Bruce was up and out of his seat, clearly intending to follow Tony to catch him for a chat. Since Tony had left the room in the blink of an eye, running off while looking supremely casual about doing it.
"Thank you, sir?" he teased back a little hesitantly and was immediately rewarded by Steve's deep appreciative purr right under his ear. This was a really awkward time to get so aroused. At his age, it was embarrassing how such little gestures from Steve managed to get him from zero to sixty in just a couple of seconds.
“I left because it was the only way to protect you; you don’t think HYDRA realised that someone was helping me out in Boston?” James asks, incredulously. “You think they thought I was capable of hacking that water plant the way
“This is proof.” Tony’s throat flexes. “This is the palace in Dwārakā. This is an underground city. This is the palace that existed in
Steve’s face dims, as he remembers the other side of the story, the side where the Winter Soldier isn’t just some faceless man named James who’s in love with his husband and possibly fucking him, but his best friend, his tortured, not-
Then, Steve shakes him awake, and he’s lying in the middle of the pharmacy aisle, Steve’s concerned face looking down on him. Tony stares at him, then, chokes, before throwing himself into Steve’s arms, which close around him.
Toni stared at her lovers, and then, made a grab for the ring box lying in Bucky’s palm. She flicked it open.
. She knows so much about you, and she had the nerve to come here, with fucking take-out. Did she, what, give you a blowjob at your fucking desk and then offer to mollify your poor, homely little husband by bringing us food?”
Tony looks up, biting his lip. “It was everything that I wanted, and nothing that I expected,” he says, quietly.
He drops the box onto the coffee table, and the four adults all go terrifyingly still, like they’ve turned to stone.
Tony turns his head, burying his face in the sheets, his mouth a slack, wet smear, parting for that vibrator like a wet, ripe peach, as Steve keeps thrusting, setting the rhythm punishing, and Tony’s hands fist in his hair, like he’s barely resisting the urge to claw his face to red, bloody ribbons.
“I’m guessing that you didn’t come to my house after all these years, because you wanted to catch up?” he asks, pointedly.
Tony turns around and sees the body bag, lying on the tiles at the far end of the hall, at the end of what looks like a long trail of slime, like what a snail might leave. A pale, bloodied hand thrusts out of the zipper.
at that, considering that Tony’s sire is a Jewish alpha whose family had come to America on a boat and his bearer is an Tamil omega, daughter of a small landowner before driven away from the motherland by the British, whose yoke never seemed to end, no matter where they go), they deck themselves out in pearls and pomade and sweet scents that contain pheromones to attract high society alphas, as the advertisements always promise.
Grant smiles, a slow, lascivious thing that makes something curdle in Tony’s gut. “I already apologise for what you walked in on, Tony. It shan’t happen again.”
“Fine, but he shows up with one bloody nose and I’m going apeshit on those little bastards,” Steve threatens.
Tony watches as two Nazis carefully lift what looks like a chest wrought in gold out of its crate by means of the long poles. The chest dazzles the eye, seeming to glow gold in this strange light. The two Nazis place it carefully on the altar.
“–and the last was outside of Strasbourg, say thirty, forty miles west of the Maginot line.” He looks up. “I only go a quick look,” he says, apologetically.
be a CEO of a multi-billion-dollar company and frankly I don’t know how you do it – but they get so focused on their work and they assume that the children’s’ needs are taken care of that they forget to show up, to be a presence, just so the kids actually see you there.”
“And then, he just let him go, smiled like they were old friends, folded his hands behind his back. The frat boy managed to get himself back on his feet, brushed imaginary dust off his stupid polo shirt, and just glared at Steve. And then, he said that it didn’t matter anyway, that everyone knows that the slut – meaning me – opened his legs for everyone that passes by, and who’d want sloppy fiftieths anyway, because I was probably loose as fuck by now.”
, both of you,” Tony says, breathing hard, his lungs aching with the effort, as he rubs at his temples. “I can’t believe… I can’t believe you both are doing this, doing this
Tony’s scowl deepens. “Fuck that noise,” he declares and moves over to the back seat, opening up the door. “Okay, change of plans, we’re gonna do some walking! How does that sound?”
They follow him up the stairs to Tony and Steve’s master bedroom, and Tony throws himself onto the bed, smiling to himself at how he bounces for just a few moments.
“Look, this is going to sound weird and paranoid, but I don’t care anymore. Is there anything I should know?” Tony takes a deep, steadying breath, which rattles in his lungs. “About when I was young?”
“Don’t believe a word she says about her husband, goodbrother. She has every need to protect his image,” Grant drawls. “But is important that Ser James has a fearsome aspect. He is the captain of my brother’s guards, in charge of all the security in the Brooklyn Lands. If the wicked do not fear Ser James, we have put the wrong man in the office.”
“You’re a fuckin’ liar,” Steve spits. “You know, normally I take my time with my victims. I want them to understand that they’re the scum of the fuckin’ earth when their life leaves their body. But you, you’ll never be redeemed, and as long as you still walk this earth, there will always be a part of Toni that is afraid of you. I don’t like it when Toni’s afraid, Tiberius. I don’t ever want to her to be afraid. I just want her safe and happy, and she won’t be either of those things as long as you’re alive.”
“I said we’ll see,” Tony says, sternly but softly. “What did we talk about, not putting the cart before the house.”
Tony pauses. “Just to clarify, when you say that your mother threatened to remove the use of his tongue, she meant just making sure he couldn’t speak, right? Not actually cutting out his tongue or anything? Because while I’m all on board for extensive punishment, I also don’t support human rights abuses.”
A nurse applies sensors to his head, chest, arms, and fingers. He’s lying on a simple broad cot, in his pyjamas. A large mirror set into one wall hides an observation room beyond.
Tony lifts an eyebrow. “So, what you wanted me to be a better husband to him without even knowing what was going on?”
Tony gnaws on his lip, as a smile threatens to break out across his face. “I kind of like that idea,” he confesses.
“Are you angry that you would’ve done that for me, if I had been using you the way you thought I was?” Tony asks, curiously.
“Yeah, sure, but that’s… that’s a paradox. You remember when we watched Doctor Who, the first season with Christopher Eccleston’s Doctor?”
Once the kids become accustomed to the new presence in their family, the next hurdle seems to be everyone else outside.
Steve opens his mouth to say something, but Tony’s too caught in his train of thought to give him an inch.
And honestly, trying something like the rent boy fantasy one more time is only likely to result in more humiliation for himself.
He walks, slowly but surely, until he lands in front of Steve’s chambers. He knocks on the door, waiting with his belly tumbling all over again.
, but he manages to keep his enthusiasm for Sam’s common sense inside his body before it all falls out onto his lap.
Tony lifts an eyebrow. “To be fair, Steve,” he drawls, “I could be out all day and you wouldn’t notice, because with the exception of today, you don’t come home until midnight.”
“How do you know that he still wants you?” Steve demands, his voice like an arrow crossing the air and making its target.
James starts the car and drives them away, his eyes flinty and concerned, as he peers into the rear-view mirror every now and then, trying to ensure that they’re not being followed. He only stops the car, when he lands at the curb outside their house, and Tony’s out the door without a second glance at the other two adults in the car with him, carrying Maushmi’s soft, thin body through the door.
“We were wrong, Steve,” he says, his voice muffled by Steve’s shoulder. “He’s a monster. He always was.”
you, Tony. There is no deserve or not deserve here. It’s just you and me, just the family we have together.”
Tony leans into the touch, desperately, hungry for every last morsel of affection that Steve might give him – this is what he’s been reduced to.
There’s blood everywhere, up the walls, all over the ceiling, soaking the sheets, pooling in a dark, red-black puddle where Tony had slipped and fallen.
The plane lurches to the left when Tony steers the wheel sharply in that direction, just as the radar detects anti-aircraft guns hammer the plane.
, because I thought you were capable of doing something like that to me, and even if you had cheated on me, I shouldn’t have done that to myself. I shouldn’t have thought that way about myself, but I did, but those were because of
Steve looks down at the photos, his brow furrowed, and then, Tony watches, in stunning technicolour, as his face contorts, his eyes emptying out like drying pools.
Steve chokes out a chuckle. “I love how you call me a kinky little beast and then come out of the woodwork like that.”
They pull him from the chair, remove the ropes and the gag in his mouth and haul him to another tent, in which there is a long trough in the center, overflowing with murky water.
They make their way down the stairs, towards the kitchen, so that he can go into the backyard through the back door. He unlocks the bolt that Jarvis would have always made sure was airtight before leaving for date night with Ana. The key turns, and the chain is removed. Tony opens the door, wandering out, holding onto a baseball bat between his hands.
The two are in full view of the open door, and Tony doesn’t know how to react. Grant has his hands on the boy’s hips and is thrusting ferociously, making quiet little grunts with each snap of his hips. The boy is gripping the edges of the table, crying out, his face matted with sweat, twisted up with pleasure.
fucking busy? He goes on conferences like all the time. Who knew there were so many insurance countries? He has secret phone calls with this woman, phone calls that he runs out of the room to take, and he’s saying really fucking suspicious things to her. Wanda…” he sighs. “Wanda, I’m not pulling this out of my ass because I stopped having sex with my husband. I didn’t just suddenly decide that my husband was sleeping with someone else because I felt lonely. I’m saying that his actions are making me suspicious, and all signs are pointing to him having an affair with this woman.”
James guides him onto his cock, happy to take control for a few moments, as he feeds his cock into Tony’s mouth, fucking his face, but then, Tony pushes his hips back onto the mattress, keeping him pinned there, as he licks a long, lazy stripe up the underside of his cock. James rocks his hips, sending his cock deeper into Tony’s throat, and Tony’s throat opens around him, convulses around the length, making him throb within the confines of his mouth.
“I wasn’t spying on you,” James says, derisively. “I had to make sure that you were okay before I came to see you.”
Tony considers lying to him, but then, his courage fails him, and he shakes his head. “No, no, it isn’t.”
“What?” Steve’s voice is soft, unbearably soft. “All of us? Because your mother said that we all corroborated what you said, Tony.”
Wanda offers him a smile, a legendary thing that brightens up her pale, beautiful face. “I want to,” she tells him and reaches for his hands again, squeezing them, warmth passing between the two human beings. “My family, we came here from Sokovia when I was a child, no older than four or five, the same age that the twins are now, actually. My father’s name was Erik, my mother’s name, Magda. They died in a car accident when Pietro and I were six. We were shuffled around foster homes from then on. It was… it was hard for us. By the time we were in high school, we had left the homes, and we were living in our car. When we wanted food, we would steal it or we’d wait until we got to school to eat, and we showered in the gym showers. I was smart; so was Pietro, but he was more of a sports guy than a books guy. We both ended up getting scholarships to the same college. I was studying teaching, and my brother was on the college’s football team, and he developed a drug habit through his friends on the team. I was studying constantly, and there were all these pracs, and I wasn’t able to pay attention to him, not as much as I should have.”
“I just…” Steve looks away, staring daggers at the wall, and Tony can see the sheen of tears in his eyes. “Is there any way we can come back from this?” he asks, honestly, his voice soft, unsure. “Is there any way that this can be fixed? Can we start over? Or at least… see if there’s still something that we can salvage between us? I mean, it’s… it’s
“What?” Tony’s lips twist mirthlessly. “What, if he thinks to have me, well, he shall have all of me by this time tomorrow night. I want to hear what he has to say.”
Steve clearly considers it for a moment, before he reaches inside his stained shirt and pulls out cash from his money belt, laying a wad of notes on the bar.
Steve’s smile tilts upwards into his cheeks, and it makes warmth roll out into the pit of Tony’s stomach.
Tony flings himself forward and presses his mouth to Steve’s. It doesn’t feel like the times that Grant had kissed him; Steve feels firm and supple and more than anything else, submissive. His arms are as stiff as boards by his side, as if he’s refusing to touch Tony, and when he pulls back, Steve’s face is as stoic as Tony has ever seen it.
And then, Thanos gets his hands on the gauntlet that he, Rocket and Bruce had forged together, all six infinity stones gleaming, even if the sky is above is dirty with dust and ash and destruction, and Tony’s eyes flicker across the battlefield.
The speed and the velocity and the acceleration and the weight of the cement air track underneath them, and the likelihood of fuel staining the ground lighting up when engine of the plane fucks up.
“No, I’m just saying that traditionally, non-Italian places don’t make good pizzas,” Steve says, defensively.
“Because I’d just watched a video where your best friend murdered my mother and father and made it look like a car accident, yeah. I can imagine it was difficult to excuse that in any way,” Tony mutters under his breath.
Steve makes a face. “I didn’t say I agreed with it. He, and a couple of other people down there, have made it clear that they think my family compromises me.”
to talk about them. Or they fester. Think of them like a wound. Your secrets, as long as you keep them to yourself, they remain unbandaged, untreated, all over your body. Time passes, and bacteria infects them; these are the lies you have to tell to cover up the lies underneath, until they fester, and then, you’re in the hospital because the infection has spread to your brain. That’s the end of your relationship. Now, the two of you, quite honestly, waited until the last possible moment to tell each other what was going on in your lives.”
Steve pushes forward the throttle, and the mine car moves through the tunnel, picking up speed. As the Nazis raise their guns to fire, Tony opens up his gun, peppering the area with lead. As the mine car is about to disappear into the tunnel, Steve’s hand falls to the back of Tony’s head, and he finds his head being shoved down, just as the car flies through the tunnel, strands of his hair scraping against the ceiling.
that we go upstairs and have sex if you weren’t included in that offer?” He looks at Steve. “You coming?”
“Oh, please, Rogers, I’ve heard your dirty talk. There’s no point in pretending to be a shy little virgin.”
Their hands dangle at their sides, and Tony’s knuckles brush against Steve’s. Steve hesitates, and then, he’s tangling their fingers together, his broad palm clenching around Tony’s for a long moment.
James shouts and lurches up, and his hand flies to Tony’s hair. He tightens it against the scalp and mutters out a strangled apology, ready to draw it away, when Tony reaches up and keeps his hand there, just as he feels the hand loosening its grip.
Steve grimaces. “You think I don’t know what my brother is like,” he laughs, harsh and grating. “I know what my brother was, Tony. Do you remember, before I left, I told you that only evil men lay with children? And that I kill those men.”
“And as for your concern about the proof that I have, I have plenty of proof. I have you acting like a shady jackass for the better part of a year. I have the necklace. I have all your secret phone calls. I have the sly way that she showed up at our house with take-out and marriage advice – has she ever been married before, by the way? Is there a Mr Romanoff who is the exact same position I am? And I have the way she touched you in that restaurant. I have the way that you never mentioned her until you were forced to introduce her to me. And I have the sex.”
Nat throws her arms around him, winding around his neck, and kisses him on the curve of his cheekbone, a fleeting brush of her lips, her lips red as her hair, and smooths her hand down his collar on her way back.
So, I feel like I have to warn you, because a lot of people are already anti Steve - you're probably going to find him a lot worse than you usually do, and make no mistake, he is an arse, but I think it really goes to the idea that Steve and Tony need therapy like crazy, and I need you all to remember that this will end with a happy ending, with a Stuckony relationship, so please, please bear that in mind, because it's the first chapter of like three or so where you're going to disagree with Steve and maybe even Tony.
Tony drags his hand over his face. “I have not slept with James since that last night back at MIT,” he says, quietly, wearily, exhaustion setting into his bones. “I’m not going to repeat myself, so you’re free to believe what you want to believe. I do still think that you’re sleeping with Natasha, and I’m not really interested in hearing what you have to say on the matter, not now, at least. I don’t think… I don’t think that this conversation is going where I wanted it to go, and I’m actually really fucking tired. I want to go to bed. I want to spend time with my kids, and I think…” he hesitates. “I think I can’t have the conversation about Natasha, not with… not with-” he looks at James, not wanting to say the next words that pop up in his brain.
Ana’s eyes dart to the TV, and she slaps it off. She moves over, fluttering across the floor like her feet don’t touch the ground, and hugs Tony, hard enough that he can feel his ribs protesting.
“I didn’t mean to make you feel that way. I know you probably won’t believe me, and I understand why, but I never intended to make you feel that way, Tony. I never wanted you to feel like you were disposable, and I
“What if they need you for something? What if they come down here?” Steve asks, the look in his eyes sharp.
“Because I want to go out to dinner. Do you know how long it’s been since we went out to dinner?” Tony asks, bluntly.
Tony, out of patience, kicks at his cabinet and sits down on a box to start looking through the files of a bottom-most drawer. When he scoots forward a little to reach the next drawer, the box rustles, as though there is something inside it.
“You pretty much already did it,” Tony says, and his words are a death knell in any argument that Steve might have thrown back in his face.
Behind him, the starburst is blazing, and then, it’s suddenly over. He makes his way back to the settlement, which is suddenly ablaze, and the fire has quickly spread to stacks of supplies on either side.
“I have lymphedema; that’s a chronic condition that causes swelling in my limbs because Yinsen had to move the parasternal nodes behind my sternum, so I had to design a surgical drain to completely replace the parasternal nodes with a port on both sides of the arc reactor housing so that I can drain the fluid as needed. A lot of my lungs were cut away, minimising my capacity to breathe. I lost about thirty percent of my lung capacity during both surgeries. I get bronchitis and pneumonia
Steve blushes. “Yeah,” he says, awkwardly. He sucks in a deep breath. “I was… I meant what I said in the letter that I sent you. Not the… not the shitty apology, because I showed it to Sam and he smacked me over the head with it, and he pointed out that it was a
"Are you out of your fucking mind man!?" Rhodes strode towards them and this time Steve didn't even snarl at him. "It's your god damn life's work!"
And there it was. Under the carbondioxide, gas, dust and the garbage of the city, hints of the specific blend of Hugo Boss, undoubtedly ridiculously expensive and possibly limited edition. Steve followed it around one block and stopped for a split second when he heard voices far down the road. Voices of two other men and Tony’s. He had never heard Tony sound like that before. He sounded terrified and he was pleading.
“Oh god..” Tony’s hips jerked, making Steve bite his lip to keep still. Then it wasn’t just involuntary jerking but Tony was moving, up and down, trying to fuck himself on Steve’s cock while trying to fuck Steve’s hand. Steve got the message and moved. Even through all the slick it was still almost painfully tight. No one had ever seen Tony like this before. It was all for Steve’s eyes and Steve’s touch. The alpha reveled in the idea. He wouldn’t have minded if it wasn’t the omegas first time but to think that no one had ever had him before did something to him, more powerful than sexual arousal, a twisting, dark feeling in his gut. Without any rationality whatsoever, Steve decided no one else would ever have Tony. Steve would kill anyone who even tried with his bare hands.
But this wouldn’t do. He could smell Tony’s growing arousal and knew, just from the scent that Tony was one of those omegas who got wet when they were in heat. Steve licked his lips, he couldn’t wait to taste all of his prize. They needed to move.
"Gonna come.. Steve.. Please sir, gonna.. I'm gonna.." He stuttered and Steve's other hand appeared on his cock, magically slick and warm already.
"Do not move." The Captain instructed, and left Tony on the bed, flat on his back. Tony, very impatiently listened to him cluttering around the room, no doubt placing the cock cage on the sink to be cleaned and preparing for whatever evil torture he had in mind.
All the evidence suggested that Iron Man had fallen in battle. There was no way of crossing the enemy line once more since help had arrived, tripling the enemy troops. Even if Steve could cross it, after what they had seen, there should be no part of Tony left to salvage. Only logical course of action was to cloak the jet and hightail it out of there.
Most of what he remembered about Steve was disjointed impressions and feelings. All of them positive. He remembered that Steve had his back, he didn’t remember exactly how he had gotten that idea. He remembered that Steve smelled nice, he didn’t remember when he had found that out. He had images of Steve smiling, looking too handsome to be real, in various settings but the background and context was always out of focus. Mostly he remembered that he could trust Steve, that Steve cared about him, that he was a good man, kind and compassionate with the ability to break the bad guys in half with his bare hands. In summary, he remembered Steve as the perfect alpha. The rest wasn’t all there.
Well, maybe not forever. He definitely wouldn’t mind if Steve were to tighten his fingers in his hair and pull Tony’s mouth a little closer between his legs, allow him to taste and smell what the blond alpha was hiding under those pants. But he knew Steve never would do that and he was okay with it. He could live with this. Just kneeling here, in silence and have Steve pet him. It was more than he had expected to receive and he would take whatever he could get.
Clint was refusing the plan as it would be a stupid one, but Steve ripped the comm out of his ear and ran out.
"You are not going anywhere." Steve told him, big hands squeezing Tony's shoulders. "I don't want a nice sub or the blond down the hall. I made my pick."
And Tony once more surprised himself by the strength of his reaction. He intensely didn't want to use his safeword. He didn't want to see Steve looking bland, and he  didn't want to go back to his own place where no one cared how much he said "fuck". Everything was fucked up now. If he dumped Steve now and went back home, next time they saw eachother Steve wouldn't admonish him for using foul language and it would break Tony's heart.
"Pretty much." Barton leaned forward and ran a hand through his hair. "But it's not as simple as that. I'd never suggest that you turn out like me. Fuck I'm a mess, I'll be the first to admit that. But.."
He went back to Tony’s side and slid an arm under the armor to lift it into a fireman's carry. “Sorry Tony.” He grunted as he carried the omega to safety for the second time. Compared to two thugs in an alley, the ride that awaited them would be much more dangerous yet Steve felt unreasonably calmer. He wasn’t even sure he could have made it out if he had been as angry as when he’d found Tony struggling and writhing under the thugs. But he drove fast and carefully, evading fire when they were spotted, instead of engaging even though he had firearms in the rover. Tony sat slumped next to him, and kept getting paler while Steve finally managed to lose his tail and drive them into the open desert.
"Don't forget to recycle!" Steve's voice floated from the couch and Tony choked a little bit. This wasn't his job! Usually he left the boxes or dishes or whatever, exactly where he ate, and it either sat there until he got fed up with the smell or the maid came around to clean everything up.
“I was about to ask you the same thing.” Steve returned, then lowered his voice, “What’s going on Pepper, where is Tony?”
Tony felt the praise slide off him, patronizing, annoying and embarrasing. But he ignored the feeling, instead getting up, removing his phone, wallet and keys along with a protoype for a small detector, an L key, a few loose screws and a pack of gum.
“It’s alright,” Steve raised a hand to touch him but instead of laying down any sort of comforting touch, it howered indecisively. “You’re alright now. How do you feel?”
“I don’t know them, I don’t trust them. I don’t trust SHIELD either. Aside from that, I’ve already figured out what it would mean for the news of Iron Man losing his memories to get out. It’d make me fish in a barrel. Best I can do for now is to hang in there and try to remember.”
“Believe me I know.” Steve bit the inside of his cheek and tried to remind himself that the man in front of him was actually a good man and he was only trying to look out for Tony.
"You are a terrible tease, you know that?" he said, shooting a frustrated look over his shoulder at his dom, then added challengingly, "Sir."
He'd never agreed to public humiliation. Granted, it was just Clint, and fetching drinks was far from humiliating, but Tony still chafed against the order. It was very common for collared subs to serve their doms in such small ways when they had company. It was a very common sight to see a collared sub happily kneeling next to their dom in a restaurant or a cafe, holding the door open or a chair out. Not everyone did it, of course, it was all up to the dynamic but it was certainly normal. So why was Tony feeling so embarrased that Barton was seeing him fetching drinks on Steve's say so?
How had he even pretended for so long? What kind of person was he to be able to pull that off even? Was it even possible to pretend to be an alpha for 20 years? Not only wasn’t Steve his alpha, he had never had an alpha.
Steve smiled. "Not the begging Tony. I think you saw how much I enjoyed having you beg for my cock." Seve cupped Tony's cheek and ran a thumb through Tony's bottom lip, for one whole second his eyes fixed on it. Then he let go.
Steve tapped the tip of his finger under Tony’s chin to shut him up and Tony did. Steve waited a moment to see if Tony would speak up again, but the other man stayed silent.
Steve sighed and breathed in the smell of Tony’s clean sweat, mixed with fear, adrenalin and blood. It was tinged with the mild scent of omega, still half masked by the remenants of cologne. When the helmet minus the faceplate came free of the spine he cradled Tony’s head in his hands, his fingers sliding into dark thick hair, matted with blood.
I did actually count the floors of Stark tower, since apparently i have nothing better to do lol. Still if it sounds wrong, and you know for a fact what should be the correct number, let me know.
Tony was once more, surprised to find out that yes, he would like to keep the blindfold on for just a little bit longer.
“I’m so sorry.” Tony told his shoulder after a minute. “Steve. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to. I thought.. I shouldn’t have. You told me not to, and I still..”
I'm so sorry. I know the doctors would check at head traumas. I just picture them holding up fingers and asking Tony what his name is and not much else here, because they want to get away from terrible-patient-Tony. And this is a fanfic, so please pretend to buy this little plot point...
Steve gave a "Hrrm" kind of sound but Tony didn't dwell on it. He just folded his arms on the couch cushions and rested his chin on them.
"Good." He could tell the dom was still smiling. It felt so good to know that Steve was this happy with him. And it hadn't been so hard, once he let go and just listened to what Steve was telling him. It was definitely worth it to know he made his dom happy.
It was just Steve. Some kid from Brooklyn, he tried to remind himself. Not the first alpha you had to deal with. Not by a long shot. He is a nobody. Compared to killing Obie, giving a little lip to Steve Rogers was nothing. Tony could get over it.
Oh, good, Tony thought. Intel was always useful. Not to mention he had always been a little bit curious about Rogers in bed. Was he the kind of dom who liked to wine and dine a sub? Or was he the posessive, controling type? Tony had no doubt Rogers was a complete gentelman, but all that repressed, 40's sense of propriety might come crumbling down when he was fucking a sub into the next week. Did he like to inflict paint? Was he the type to tease and play? Was he rough or sensual?
Jarvis opened the doors for him and Steve carried the pizza inside, climbing the stairs to be greeted by the sight of Dum-E and Butterfingers running around, wrecking havoc on the parlor. Tony was giggling somewhere. A sound Steve had only heard before when Tony had been drunk.
Tony tried to think but it was so hot! And something smelled good. Oh. It was just Steve’s lingering scent on the bed from earlier that night. He unconsciously raised a hand to touch the slightly sore spot on his neck, where the alpha had bit him, and he caught himself moaning shamelessly, his boxers only grew wetter.
Steve pushed him by the hold he had on Tony’s throat until the other man was laying flat on the floor on his back, looking up at Steve with calm, half lidded eyes, giving in completely. Steve wanted to lick Tony all over, so he settled for leaning over the omega and licking a broad stripe from his collar bone to under his ear, along Tony’s jugular. Tony shivered and let out a quiet moan that went to Steve’s cock directly.
And the current event they were all sweating through was to raise money for a very promising line of research into a controversial drug that would allow omegas to control their heat cycles.
"Thanks for the pasta Tony. I know what kind of effort it took you to make that and don't think I don't appreciate it." he said as he wiped his mouth on a serviette.
"I want you to empty your pockets and kneel on the floor. Keep your eyes down. I'll come in and put my collar on you. I want you to keep looking at your own knees until I give you permission to look up. Do you understand me? Answer yes or no."
"Mmhmm. He is a good man. If it had to be anyone, I'm glad it's him. Now move it." Rhodey said. Tony took a deep breath and let the colonel walk him out of the room and down the aisle.
There was a very quiet sort of peace in concentrating so fully on an other person. Tony hadn't had the time yet but later when he thought on it, he'd find it surprising.
Tony slumped against him, his hand coming up to tangle in Steve’s shirt. Steve didn’t stop him when Tony once more pressed his face into Steve’s chest. He sat there and let Tony draw comfort from him. As much as he needed. In the end it was Tony who spoke first while Steve was seriously considering what he needed to do, what his next step should be. Maybe Tony really would be better off working with his gadgets at home until his memories started to come back.
In line with Tony’s progress in adjusting, Steve started to let Tony get more involved in SHIELD’s projects.  Since simply being there didn’t seem to be helping him remember much. So one morning, he paid Coulson a visit.
Steve sat back and ran his hands through his hair without realizing he was smearing Tony’s blood into his own hair. He sighed.
Sounded immensely boring to Tony. What were they, an 80 year old married couple!? He was expecting Rogers to be a bit old fashioned, but what the hell? Dinners, and cleaning and.. talk??? When Rogers said "enjoy eachothers company" Tony pictured them sitting in identical arm chairs, knitting or reading a newspaper. The phrase very well could mean that they'd get to fuck but this was the most boring way Tony had ever heard it put.
"You made breakfast." he stated and Tony nodded, standing up to pull a chair out for his (still) dom.
He could still distantly smell the arousing scent in the room but he was too worried now, with Tony in his arms. There was nothing sexy at all with the situation. And not just because Tony needed immediate help, but also because the thought of Tony torturing himself rather than going into heat curdled the blood in Steve’s veins.
"Not really. But that's on me. Not gonna happen again." Steve was brisk now, he stepped away  from Tony to walk to the otherside of the bed, gathering some clothes, from the back of the chair next to the bed, and the closet... Not knowing what he's supposed to do now, Tony took a few steps towards Steve and stopped.
After that was just boredom again. It felt weird to run naked, brought into mind the Olympians. He supposed it would be easier without an erection. He could hear Steve moving things around, dragging mats and pushing machines. The dom was up to something and Tony had no clue what it might be. But this time he didn't dare turn and look. He'd been ordered to stare at the pool in front of the threadmills, and it was a relatively easy order to obey. If previous punishments Steve dealt was any indication, Tony didn't want to accumulate more.
Tony moved towards the table to grab the notebook, but when he got close, Steve grabbed him around the waist and planting a foot on the chair, bent Tony over his knee. Two hard and fast swats were delivered in quick succession before Tony even realised what was happening, but then Steve was already tipping him back onto his feet. Tony only had the time to feel the burn, even if it was somewhat dulled because of the clothes.
After that there wasn't much Tony could do about his situation and he started to relax. Once he was able to give up on his orgasm, it was much easier to tolerate being a live mannequin for his dom. He just had to wait, feeling Steve's eyes on him, and listen to little scritch scritch sounds the soft pen was making on the thick paper.
Bruce was talking, but suddenly Tony wasn’t hearing. He remembered the view. Manhattan under the bright sun. He knew what it felt like to fly at high speeds. Chasing… Chasing something very important. A nuclear bomb. Two million people.
Rogers shrugged. "And I have amazing control over it." Then he proceeded to root around in his pockets, pulling out the L key, the prototype and the gum pack. He tossed them onto the bed.
The Captain grabbed his wrists to stop Tony from hurting himself pulling on the collar, while Barton held up his hands.
It came as a surprise when Steve’s hand appeared beneath his nose, holding fried prawn. When he reached out to take it though, the hand pulled back.
“What-” Steve looked up with one foot on the deck, as Clint swore. A streak of fire and red fell from the sky.
Tony paced around the room, while Rogers leaned on the table with arms folded, his expression carefully neutral. He was making a conscious effort to remain patient and give Tony time to live through his shock. Tony could tell.
“Did you know that Mike here has eidetic memory? And he’s only 20. Already made it to junior. Almost going to make me jealous.”
“Wait. Are you authorized to know all this? I mean.. Of course you were there when Loki tried to take over the world but still, if no one told you about it already, maybe I shouldn’t be telling you either?”
“But things are little different now. He trusts me. He feels alone, everything feels foreign to him. I’m only here to help until he regains his memories.”
“Alright.” Steve’s tone was light. No pressure. Then he bit the inside of his cheek because he had to ask. “Is that all you remember? Anything else?”
Please let me know if I need to put warnings on this? I was undecided. If anythings feels wrong, let me know and I'll try to tag it the right way.
The guy hesitated for a moment then said, “Uh it may sound like a cliché, but seriously, if there’s one person you don’t want to see angry, it is Dr. Banner. Please Mr Stark. It’s not a joke. Believe me, I’m not exaggerating. You asked me why Prof. Jenkins was so scared? It was because he was on the Hellicarrier when Dr. Banner….got angry.”
“I thought I’d bring over the documents you requested by hand and check on Mr Stark. I heard about his little panic attack in the R&D lab. SHIELD needs to know if his memories have come back.”
"Are you serious?" Tony went to raise his head from Rogers' knee but the big hand pressed down, keeping Tony's head where it was.
Both Pepper and Steve had meantioned Colonel Rhodes. They said the guy was an alpha so maybe Tony had knelt for him before? And never mentioned their relationship to anyone, not even Pepper? But he couldn’t picture himself kneeling for the black guy he had seen the photo of. The Colonel looked intimidating and cold, was he any different in person? And if Tony had any sort of alpha-omega relationship with him wouldn’t the guy have had made an impression enough to make Tony remember him through his amnesia like he remembered Steve? Tony came to the conclusion that no, Steve was different. Steve must have meant something to him before his memory loss. More than any other person in his life.
"I'm.. ok. My ass hurts. But." He wiped his nose on his own arm. He was just too comfortable. Too relaxed. The pain was there of course but not enough to disract from how good it felt to just lean on his dom and be comforted.
After his shower though, when he had dressed himself back in his day old clothes that still smelled faintly of Tony, he hadn’t felt like leaving, going to his own empty house. He’d talked himself into staying a little while longer, just until his hair dried, then just until he’d finished this bottle of beer. He had asked Jarvis to put in a movie, something old, and easy to watch. He must have fallen asleep after that.
He snapped his head to the other side to see the Captain, sitting on an armless chair, as if it was a throne, with a notebook in his lap. He was twirling a pencil between his fingers but his eyes were locked on Tony. Intense and drinking in every detail.
“No matter what the media write about me, I’m not actually all-powerful. The Avengers is a team effort and we were down four members. ” Steve snapped.
“That is confidential information, only available by command of either -” JARVIS started in the end but Pepper just waved a hand.
The whole week passed about the same, Tony pushing Steve but always backing off before it got annoying. One very pleasant experience for Steve was Tony’s scent, which was starting to settle around the workshop. It was the kind of scent you only noticed if you came back to it after a while. Very clean, pleasant and deeply alluring. Somehow both fresh and earthy, evasive yet addictive. It was purely Tony without Tony remembering to hide it under layers of expensive cologne. Steve was starting to associate Tony’s scent with happiness, comfort, childish excitement and wit.
There was no answer. The locked door was just a piece of slat, no matter how elegantly designed, it wouldn’t be a problem for Steve to break it. But Tony was going into heat and Steve was probably the last person he wanted in his space at the moment. Steve took it as the suggestion of privacy that it was, rather than a physical obstacle. But if Tony was in danger…
“Somewhere in the house. Making a phone call. A guy called ‘Rhodey’, she seemed to think he needed to know about my memory thing. Who names their kid Rhodey?”
Steve's hands dipped under his navel, his finger tips skimmed the tops of his thighs and Tony gulped. He was too busy willing Steve to grasp that long cock and give it a stroke, so he didn't notice the look the dom was giving him. If he were to look up, Tony would have seen how much Steve was enjoying giving this little show to his locked and caged sub.
He pulled his hands back abruptly, suddenly feeling awkward, as if Tony had just caught Steve groping him in the dark.  Which he had been doing. But for entirely medical reasons. Steve felt himself blush.
Tony flexed his hand in the thick wrap, focusing on the feeling of being held by rope. Then his wrist was being pulled, down further, past his thighs, forcing him to bend his body further. When a new length of the rope started to wrap around his ankle, Tony got the idea.
“Woah!” Tony flinched, then looked at Steve with disbelief in his eyes. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing king kong?”
“Yes. I see. I’ve heard he skipped his psych appointment too. Maybe you’re right.” Then he moved to the computer and started clicking away at it.
"I mean I know this is too sudden. But during my heat I thought.. Ugh, not much of a thinking process was involved really, but I felt.. And I don't mean to steal away all the fun period of dating and not calling eachother for 3 days or whatever the young people are doing these days.. Or did back in your day.. But I know what I want now. And with the document hanging over my head.. Why not go all in? I trust you. By the way please give me an answer because I might be panicking just a little."
