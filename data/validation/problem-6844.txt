After several hours his concentrated work was interrupted when someone knocked on the glass door of the lab. Friday pointed him out; Tony was so engrossed in his suit that he had not noticed. Steve was behind the glass.
"Steve?" He asked feebly. The soldier fended off another bullet and threw himself to Tony on the ground, behind a rock. "Thank goodness," the soldier murmured, pointing to the rock. "Put this on."
"How did you get the idea that you should keep this to yourself? For three months have you been living with agents since then, and you didn’t say shit? Almost every week, you fucking saw me. That was not only dangerous but stupid as well. We were unprepared. How do we look to this man now?"
"We'll take the black SUV," she said. "It looks different, but it doesn’t stand out as much as one of your cars, Tony."
"Because it's important!" Rhodey shouted. He had stood up and walked toward Tony. "I know you're feeling like shit. Damn it, Tony!"
If he called him, they could track his position, and so close to the end, everything would be gone. He had to know Pepper to be safe, and the others too, only then could he think about possible ways out.
Tony's eyes widened and he almost choked on himself. He did not answer, he just could not do that. "Yes, it is indeed one of your dear teammates. Of course, that person gets something back for their services."
His workers were all confused and there seemed to be no quiet minute. It did not bother him. His eyes clung to the big TV across the room. The press conference from New York went on quietly in the background, but the reporters only asked banal things.
A shadow emerged from a bush and ran quickly under the bridge. Somewhere, someone dived into the water, and more and more bushes moved suddenly. Black-clad men and women positioned themselves on the other side of the river. A thunder pervaded the park and at the same time, a bright light flashed. That was not a storm, Tony knew. He did not know if it was the cold or the tiredness, but a shiver ran down his spine. He could barely see the other side of the bridge. More shadows - big shadows - gathered and the beating of a stick on stone broke the otherwise perfect silence. Then it was quiet again.
Meanwhile, his friend should sleep, because the therapy was exhausting. "Do you expect a package?" Steve asked and Tony shook his head.
Tony, Steve and Dragenbach ran out from under the bridge and stood directly in front of two smaller aliens. Dragenbach reacted immediately and fired his gun into the face of the first of those things, causing it to fall to the ground, and Steve punched the shield in the unprotected neck of the other alien. As they ran up the small hill to the bridge Tony could hardly believe what he saw. He could make out Clint, who was standing on a tree and firing arrows, while Natasha and some agents fired at the little aliens that could be dangerous to them. Barnes stood nearby and knocked a monster to the ground. Somewhere above them Rhodey flew and fired at the
Even though he had betrayed him, the mechanic felt bad as he carried his own dying creation across the battlefield. Rhodey came flying to him and secured his back while Tony came to a stop on the back of the tank. With his repulsor, he defeated an alien who had seen him and got ready for the others, who stood guard over the tank and came running up to him. Rhodey came to a stop beside him, handing a grenade to Vision without words. Tony could feel the hatred that, despite everything, went from his friend to the android. Vision hobbled quickly. Rhodey and Tony were in the field fighting. Sweat was running in his helmet as the mechanic turned and saw three other creatures running towards him. With his energy beams he switched off two of them at the same time, but the third one kept coming towards him. The claws had stretched out and ready to strike. Tony was in shock. Maybe everything had become too much for him, but he could not react anymore.
Steve's hand tapped nervously on the couch and his leg wobbled. Bucky was sitting next to him, but Steve didn’t really care. He looked at the big screen in front of him, on which a woman said something he barely noticed.
He heard a sigh from Clint but ignored it. Carefully, he sat down on the armrest of Natasha's chair and tried to look relaxed. Only now could he really look at Steve and the person next to him. The Winter Soldier sat next to him, staring at Tony. His brown hair hung down his pale and leached face, but his eyes showed the same pride Tony had seen before.
His voice broke in the end as his eyes fell back on the five people kneeling before him. "I'm sorry," he told them softly, but Pepper shook his head.
Tony heard his heart beat in silence. "A lot of things are easy to foresee," said Burkwill in the recording. "But not the end of the 24th of July. Since I worked with Vision, I knew I could manipulate him. The Android that accidentally, as he thought, got to me, saw the chance to bring together the two warring groups. Just to save you, Stark. The information he gave me sealed either your downfall, Stark, or mine. I know that Vision never wanted me to hurt you, but his help has done just that. I know that in the end, you’ll want to save your friends - you must save them. I know that Vision will betray me, because in the end, he is weak, just like most other people on this planet. But I do not know how the fight ends. But in any case, it will come to an end."
"He’s... he’s in his lab. As always. He didn’t feel ready to fight. He says he's going to hinder us", Rhodey said cautiously, but with a clearly audible reproach in his voice.
A beer bottle fell to the ground and the man staggered to pick it up before he stepped forward two more feet and was now better for Tony to see. Disappointed, he leaned back and the homeless sipped past his hiding place as if Tony did not exist. After half a minute, the man suddenly stopped and turned back around, staring right where Tony was. Carefully, the mechanic pulled his hands up and laid them on the arc reactor to dampen the bluish glow. The man stared for a few more seconds before putting his bottle to his mouth and shrugging.
Wanda, who was now slightly behind Steve, had given him back cover at the beginning. The last hundred or perhaps one hundred thirty feet of the ship, now lying in his back, were now free of the monsters, and Wanda, whose arms were already trembling with exertion, caused beings on his side to fly into the air and die.
The mouth stepped back to where the car was just visible. "I'm actually surprised that none of you knew that. I thought my sources were just not good enough. Nice to know that it was different. Congratulations, Stark, Rogers, Barnes, you have kept a secret quite well. I think I can tell you another secret now."
"Stop!", he called and got up. "Release him, you want me!" He said. He knew that the others were getting ready behind him. "He still passed information behind our backs. He has betrayed us and SHIELD and he has betrayed the United States. He will come to court. But you want me. Let's try another exchange, Burkwill."
"Now you are quiet, Stark. Now, like twenty-four years ago. Eighteen dead in the city. Seven of them were not yet grown-up, all proven by a grenade by Stark Industries, and you did not even get a mandatory bereavement letter you just had to sign. Nothing. Nothing at all. Only more weapons, only more deaths in the streets, year after year."
It was a simple excuse to say that they didn’t know anything. Tony rolled his eyes. "Special agents, of course," he mumbled to himself. He took a sip of his coffee and waited for the next question.
"Where have you been after Ultron? You knew that I was feeling bad. You knew it exactly. Where have you ever been for me?"
"Mr Barnes, Mr Rogers," one of the policemen politely addressed the two. "Mr Fury would like to talk to you."
"Steve is not ready yet because of Bucky. But that will be okay soon. Then we’d love to come," he smiled. He leaned back and threw the phone on the table in front of them.
Four agents are in danger and I can and must prevent them from dying. And if I catch the psychopath first, that's good."
Several news channels from all over the world tried to take pictures and video footage of the incoming heroes and pushed forward. The security officials tried to ignore them but reaped only bad looks and sometimes even slight pushes if the reporters penetrated too far.
It took Tony more than an hour to finally fall asleep. Only gradually did the drugs start to work. He rarely slept for two hours at a stretch during the night, because pain and exhaustion were so mixed up that he had nightmares and woke up sweat-drenched.
“Ohhh, someone does not remember the rules, come on Nat snip away, I have no idea how Pepper got to be CEO if she cannot remember on simple instruction.  Still it won’t be for much longer I would imagine, there cannot be a lot left that you and the Captain need to learn about the running of Stark Industries.”
“Please, please tell me what do?  I am being good, I am sorry for running away, I will not do it again.
Your psychologist informed us that you would be prone to mood swings and bouts of irrational behaviour until your hormones and weight are correctly balanced.
Ripped pieces of tissue floated to the floor as he jumped up and started pacing, he was getting so confused, why would Steve believe he had enticed Ty last night, he needed to make Steve believe him, trust him, that he would never do such a thing.
The experience was even more horrible than the previous day, not because of the pain and the knowledge his breasts were going to be bigger, a thing that he never like. It was because he had to watch Darcy for the whole day, knowing that this would end for him but never for her, he would have nightmares about the callous way she was treated when she suddenly went into labour.
“I am going to cuff your wrist and and one of your legs, l don’t trust you yet, and until l do l am not taking any chances.”
Steve grinned as Tony’s little cock dribbled a few drops of clear cum over his fingers, he loved how embarrassed  and turned on his baby was, the rosy cheeks and the lowered eyes.
It was funny but really embarrassing, Captain America and Iron Man sitting in a fountain dripping water whilst two police officers stood there laughing.”
Stella loved her long hair, golden like corn and fell in waves down her back to touch the floor when she sat down.  He took his time, made us all watch as he hacked of each length of hair until it stuck up from her scalp in all direction just like the scarecrows we used to make.  You should have heard her begging and wailing when he got out the clippers, didn’t do no good, once Daddy set on a course of punishment, he always saw it through to the end.
“That’s it Tony time to wake up, lazy omega of mine you need to eat so that our pups can grow strong.”
Once again Steve thought if Howard was standing in front of him right at this moment, he would have no hesitation in punching him flat out.  The bastard deserved to burn in Hell for the mental and physical abuse Tony has suffered at his hands, Maria must have had some inkling of what he had planned, surely, she could not have been that oblivious to her only son’s abuse.
“Please Alpha I am exhausted, I need to sleep, my body needs a break, it also needs an orgasm but I suppose along with you keeping your dick in your pants that’s not going to happen any time soon is it?”
Surprisingly he was okay with Tony’s forced retirement, wanting his best friend to embrace being his true self and if it kept Tony safe from harm and curbed his reckless behaviour so much the better.  He had joked that a least now he would be able to spank his bratty friend if he sassed or misbehaved.  Steve had laughed and had given his permission for Rhodey to spank Tony if his omega got out of line when they spent time together.  He could see that Tony was going to continually have a cherry red ass around his best friend, who no doubt had numerous spankings saved up for all the stress and strain that he had put him under over the years of their friendship.
“Good l want her running Stark Industries as l don’t have the interest to do it full-time, but l do not need her attitude and to be having to constantly monitor her for signs of rebellion.
Pepper opened her mouth to protest but a red eyes glare from Natasha had her escaping to the changing room.  There followed an hour of humiliation as she was poked and prodded, measurements taken as she was posed in all kinds of positions.  Then she was made to shower and suffer through her whole body being waxed, her eyebrows threaded, her lashes lengthened and thickened.  The manicure and pedicure were a welcome break and distraction from her prickling skin.
Tony didn’t believe him for one minute, he knew that the Captain would want hybrids from him at some stage.  Seeing the length and girth of the Raider’s member he could not help but squirt as he imagined being impaled on it. He jerked as the Captain’s fingers ran over his glistening piercings, dipping into his cunt, before withdrawing and pinching hard on his clit, as he panted and moaned through another orgasm.
Tony watched the blood dripping down his chest from where Steve had bitten hard enough to draw blood from his bonding mark, when his Alpha tugged at the ring through his clit he screamed as his climax hit and his walls tightened to milk Steve’s cum deep into his pulsating pussy.
“Shhhh Tony baby, shhh no need to cry or be frightened, I am going to take such good care of you, you will never have to worry about anything ever again.   All you need to concentrate on is being a good boy for me, being the sweet loving Tony that I know is hidden deep inside, that innocent little boy that never got a change to thrive and be loved as he should have been, this time you will have a Daddy and a husband that will love and protect you always.”
His one night stands were just that, gone in the morning and never a repeat performance.  Tony was always in control of the sex and JARVIS was on standby with a tranquilizer dart if things started to get out of control.
Steve began to pour the thick creamy shake into the open mouth of his silent omega, he started slow to get him used to swallowing on demand, after a quarter of the glass was empty he increased the pace of his delivery knowing that Tony’s throat already raw from his earlier deep throating would not be able to keep up. Sure enough, Tony choked on the next mouthful splattering Steve’s leg with shake.
“Tony just needed an exceptionally strong Alpha to show him that he could embrace his omega side fully, and with the defeat of Thanos, he no longer needs to be Iron Man and can now concentrate on being an omega, a breeder and a mother.”
Ms Natasha will represent Stark Industries tonight, poor Mrs Hogan is indisposed due to severe morning, noon and night sickness!”
Helping Tony off the bed and on to his knees making sure that his heels dug in to his throbbing ass he pulled out his cock and pushing it passed his omega’s quivering lips. Cupping the back of Tony’s head, he held him in place as he slowly forced the large mushroomed head of his cock down his omega’s throat.  Tony’s sad eyes stared up at him lashes dripping with tears.  Steve almost felt sorry for him until his enhanced sense of smell caught a whiff of coffee on his omega’s breath.
On his weekly weigh in’s with Bruce he had not wanted to know how much he was gaining, Bruce seemed to be satisfied with his gains and there had only been a one week where his diet had been monitored more strictly than usual.  When he had first noticed his soft belly and loss of muscle mass, he had begun to avoid looking at himself in mirrors and had wanted to cover up his changing body shape.  Of course, Steve had just upped the heating when he had pretended that he was cold and needed to wear more clothes and gave him even more cuddles and mugs of hot chocolate with whipped cream than normal.
Once the legionaries had left with the unconscious alpha, he had Jarvis turn off the fucking machine and release Tony who collapsed on to the floor.
He took pity on the obviously in pain omega, it wouldn’t matter anyway as they were still tied together and would be for at least another 10 minutes.  He used his knife to rip through the sheet binding him to the rail, picking him up he carried him back into the cabin and sat on the bed.
Steve spends his days and nights with the Stark Omega, whilst waiting for Natasha to return with news of their Tony.
“Hello Captain Rogers, it is lovely to finally meet you, Tony has been regaling me with many tales about the Avengers.  I have actively encouraged this as there is a freedom in his speech when doing so that I do not get when I ask him to talk about himself.
Happy has agreed to marry you so that no one will question why you are always pregnant, he has been pinning for you for years, but you have never given him a second look.  He will be your husband and your head of security and will be the only other person who will have the power to make you turn into our submissive little sex doll.”
“Well done sweet boy, taking Daddy’s knot, going to keep you full of my milk all the time, plug your hole so nothing can escape.  Daddy will knot you every day to insure, that you remember that you belong to him and no one else.
A thorough inspection turned out to be a spit roasting between two super soldier who couldn’t keep their hands of his bruised and swollen nipples, his howls of pain could be heard across in the barns.
There was nothing he could do but comply, in the exposed glass elevator he was fair game to any Alphas that were using it at the same time, usually he took the stairs if it was only a few floors, but he had been so flustered by all the staring and lewd comments that he hadn’t even noticed there was someone else in the elevator.
Tony shivered at Sir’s whispered words, his cock twitching in his red panties, he was thankful for the small plug in his ass, otherwise he would be leaking slick down his thighs.
Winter could sense the anticipation in the Barn, the air of expectancy amongst the handlers.  He was not surprised when his stall door opened, Karl entering with a heavy collar and leash, swapping out the yoke, he had no opportunity to use his freed arm, the joints locked after spending a month trapped in one position.   Karl had not cared for the hurt he caused by twisting it down and behind his back, securing it with a thick cuff to the short chain hanging from the back of his collar.
The blue diamond in his collar shone bright in the mirror’s reflection, the vibrainium collar moved in time with each breath he took.  His arc reactor’s glow peeped out between his breasts, he traced the words cut in to his skin considering Bucky had used a knife the Cyrillic script was strangely beautiful.  He supposed he should be more upset about it and reaction would probably set in at a later stage but in the scheme of things it was not important. He and his pups had survived and Bucky would never be able to hurt them again.
A screech of surprise was followed by the thud of a body hitting the floor, yanking on the ankle he dragged the captured omega from the passageway after kicking the panel door wide open.  The small omega appeared unconscious arms curled protectively round his large belly, a trickle of blood ran down his face from a small wound on his forehead.
When he had first been approached by Fury to take on this mission he had already been in negotiations with Miss Potts to bond with Tony as they were both in agreement that the wayward omega needed to be bonded and guided with an extremely firm hand in to reaching his full potential as an omega.
Retaking her seat at the head of the table she motioned for Steve to sit opposite her Fury and Agent Coulson were already seated both wearing bemused looks, the other Avengers had already been dismissed.
“Tony you don’t need to cover yourself, the baby needs to bond with you and the best way is skin on skin contact with no barriers.  The room is warm, there is no need to be embarrassed, all of your scents need to mingle and recognize each, others.
We don’t have time to pander to her soft ways, the birth will happen very soon, Jotun breeder always have long difficult births, and since Loki is half Asir we don’t know what effect that will have on the birthing process.”
Hands clasped together they helped each other up chattering away in their own little language, only for the whole process to start again, no matter how many times the twins never tired of it.
May Cow poor thing went into early labour on Asgard, she passed away shortly after, the pups are small and weak, but the healers are caring for them and assure me that they will all survive and, in a few months, will be able to travel the bio frost.
“Steve l am going to shoot my load, Hulk wants to play but his sperm will burn her, and we can’t have that at the moment.  I have promised he can play with her when she is no longer needed.”
Steve took note of the stubborn set of his little one’s jaw, this was going be a battle but one that he would win, flipping him over so that he lay across his knees he spanked the padded behind ten times in quick succession making sure that Tony’s belly was pressed down against his thighs. He lay ten further smacks over where he knew the base of the plug would be and this was his baby’s undoing, the force of the smacks sent the butt plug further up his channel nudging his sweet spot as his full bladder pressed down against his muscled thighs.
Also, the pretty rings on your penis and balls are not just for decoration, there is a spell contained within them that will release if they are ever removed.  Daddy will not hesitate to remove them if you ever try to runaway or push me past my limits. This is a last resort punishment if all else fails, believe me you don’t want to know the consequences of removing the rings. They will be irreversible, so I suggest that you think very carefully before you decide to disobey me or runaway.”
“This will keep your potty mouth busy whilst I attend to business now pleasure your Alpha, I do not want to hear another sound from you other that you thanking me for giving you this opportunity to show my board of directors what a good little cock sucking obedient omega you are.”
Tomorrow night, I am coming for you, you will be my bitch, you will never get to fuck another omega ever again, you will learn your place and be grateful that you have an Alpha that is willing to offer his protection to skinny, pathetic wannabe  omega.”
“Jarvis is there any news on status of the mission, has Steve or Winter contacted you with an update on when they are due back?”
Loki huffed a cold breath against Stark’s bare neck enjoying the shudder that ran the length of the omega’s spine, flexing his hips he pushed deeper in to Stark’s ass, slowly sawing in and out of him.  Loki took his time, his thrusts keeping to a measured pace no matter how much Stark writhed and moaned for him to fuck his hole harder and faster.
Grabbing hold of his hand she forced the pen to the paper, when he still hesitated she slapped his face and squeezed his wrist tightly. Grabbing hold of his ear as if he was a naughty child she twisted it sharply causing him to shriek in pain.
He watches as his small omega throws an epic tantrum, everything on the worktable ends on the floor or in the case of his screw drivers, embedded in the wall.  He screams and curses, hits his fists on the table, until finally exhausted the tears start to flow.
“I don’t know Steve how can you w.. want this?  I’m n..not a b.. baby, it’s wrong isn’t it?  Everyone will think I am sick and l…l..laugh at me.  Please tell me what to do I know I am m..m..messed up, I just want all the noise and bad th..thoughts in my head to st…stop. Do you really w..want me to b..be your b..baby  c..c..could I be you baby?”
Tony on the edge of consciousness felt as his Alpha came deep in his throat, felt his fingers massaging his throat to ensure he swallowed every drop.  When Steve finally pulled out of his mouth he could do nothing but suck in huge gasps of air his lungs and throat burning with each inhale.
“B…but l don’t wannabe baby, l’m a big boy. Hate diapers and stupid bottles, wannabe working not playing.  Got things to do with the bots an Jarvis inna lab.
Tony let the warm water to fall over his head and body, washing a way the shampoo and soap.  His body ached and his breasts were full and heavy, running his hands over his soft belly he all most missed the weight and size of his pregnant belly.  The flesh was soft and loose his omega pouch not fully contracted yet, his hips were wider and his waist dipped in softly, if not for his small cock his body could pass as female.  His body and face remained hair free, his dark hair curled irritatingly around his ears and neck it had been awhile since Steve had cut it.
His own cocky is rock hard and weeping pre cum as his little alpha pleads for him to take him.  Finally, he pushes in, Tony’s legs over his shoulders so that he can watch as his cock pushes past the tight ring of muscles. Hs little alpha’s eyes are blown wide as he begins a to pump his cock in and out of the tight channel, his large hands holding Tony’s own above his head, his weight trapping the smaller man under him.  He sets a punishing pace, his hips snapping, desperate to force his burdening knot past the tight ring of muscles, desperate to knot and fill his little alpha.  Tight walls milk his knot of every drop of cum, he feels Tony’s body stiffen as his own orgasm hits.
Once I get her down in medical, I can knock her out and take some samples, I suggest you ask your omega about Extremis and his Pepper.  We need to act on this quickly, Pepper needs to be bought under control.”
Thor began his chant as he slid into the wet heat of Tony’s sex, hours of fucking, and the little omega’s pussy was still tight, gripping his cock as he shot his first load of cum. Placing his hand over the new rune stones on the omega’s swollen belly, he pressed down hard until the stones and cum dispersed throughout the omega’s body.
His Alpha had taken his time with the tattoos drawing out the process, punishing Tony with  harsh twists of his nipples every time he flinched or tried to pull away, the movements involuntary or not.
Bruce led Petey into the Communal Lounge, just as Sita finished strapping Loki onto the birthing bench. The jotun omega was screaming and cursing at both her and Thor, the abusive language only ceasing when she fitted a ball gag over Loki’s mouth.
“Dirty bitch, look at the mess you have made, well you are just going to have to lie in it until my knot goes down.”
Pulling out he spurted his load over his omega, revelling in the sight of it covering his omega.  Running his fingers along Tony’s perineum he massaged his cum into the soft opening of the forming birth canal managing to fully insert the tip of his finger.  This was what he had been waiting for, for the past few weeks.  Wiggling his finger he forced it deeper into the tightness of the developing birth canal ignoring his omega’s whimpers. This needed to be done and as Tony’s Alpha it was his right to be doing this, aiding his omega in preparation for the birth of their pups.
“I sorry daddy, I be a good boy, eat all my porridge I promise.  Don’t want daddy to be mad with me.”
“Much better, cunt whores don’t have time for keeping themselves clean and their hair tidy.  This will bring a pretty penny at the wig makers.
Loki’s body rippled as he returned to his Asir form, Thor’s large hands on his hips pulling him off the panting omega, impaling him with one thrust onto his thick cock. There was no finesse to Thor’s fucking, just brut force, the heavy weight of his hand pressing down on his shoulder kept him fully impaled as the god’s knot caught on his rim, stretching it wide before forcing its way through.  Rough fingers stroked his cock, dragging over the tender skin, uncaring that what little remaining juice from the breeder’s cunt was not enough to smooth the way.  With a final grunt and thrust Thor’s cock released his seed, knot locking them together.  Loki hissed as Thor dug his nails in to his ball sac, the joint pain as he twisted the piercings near the tip of his cock was enough to make him spurt his cum over his Alpha’s hand.
Tony felt restless after his shower, his sex ached, and his asshole felt incredibly empty, he wasn’t used to not being plugged continuously.  He stared at himself in the mirror, his eyes drawn to his smooth mons, his fingers tracing the slight bump where his cock had been.  It was the first time he had looked properly, or even touched himself in months. He remembered clearly the day he had finally broken and asked Him to have it removed completely.
Tony shivered under Winter’s stern gaze.  The Alpha was dressed in his black leathers, guns and knives strapped to his body, a sniper rifle hung over his shoulder. Dark hair hung loose, stubble covering his jaw. His metal arm glinted in the sunlight, fingers curled around the holster attached to his thigh.
Between his Watcher wanting him to pose and dress up and looking after the milk cow, he was exhausted and incredibly frustrated. He took it out on BB, slashing in her buttocks and tits with the crop, getting even more angry when she moaned and squirted.
Our world needs to be repopulated and the infrastructure rebuild to support future generations.  We can only do this if the balance of Alpha/Omega is restored.
“All traces of the suppressants and contraceptive patch have now been cleared from his system, the constant anal stimulation has ramped up his production of slick, by the time the plug is removed his hole will be gushing, giving the Inspector the impression that he close to his heat and preparing his body for bonding.
Holding his Omega’s head firmly he giving him no chance to pull back, chasing his release, shouting out with pleasure as his cum flooded down Tony’s throat to join the pool of cum in the already swollen belly.
“Sweet heart come on, just four more mouthfuls of dinner then you can have a big slice of the delicious coffee cake that Natasha has made especially for you.  Then afterwards Thor is going to feed you some Asgardian grapes that have been frosted with crystalized ginger.
“Secretary Ross, I will admit to some hesitation when first fully informed of the more stringent requirements of the Omega Registration Act, but after consulting with the experts and reading the data that led to them being put forward I can honestly say that my decision to fully support the new Omega Registration Law is absolute.
"Now dear shall we get you more comfortable then I can take a little look and see how far along you are.”
“I am just a bit surprised that you are a believer in the formal traditions of Alpha/Omega mating, l would have thought that you would be an advocate  for all the new fangled ways of this era.
He turned the cameras on in the bedroom, it was one of his pleasures, watching Steve and Tony.  Gave him such an advantage when dealing with Steve.
Tony lay pliant in his Alpha’s arms lazily sucking on a third cum shake. His labour had been halted for now, whilst still lucid before the sedative kicked in Steve had explained to him what had happened with Bucky and Winter as Steve had taken to calling him, thankfully between being in subspace and then going in to shock he could not remember much of what Bucky had done to him.
Picking up his pen he scanned the documents in front of him signing his name then after closing the folder flipping it into his out tray.  Coffee that’s what I need he decided if I am going to stand any chance of finishing today. Pushing back his chair the squeak of the wheels covered the slight grating sound of the ceiling panel above his desk being lifted.
“Tony did your Pepper have Extremis after the Mandarin incident? Did you find a way to stabilise it or remove it?
“Such a whore for it Stevie, never satisfied always wanting more, such a greedy bitch bet he could be in labour and still want to suck cock and be fucked.”
I didn’t consent to any of the modification you have done to my body, yet they seem natural and why would l agree to freely bond with you?  You are a monster, who has physically and mentally abused me, but you are also to my mind and body, my Alpha.
It was the perfect distraction as he couldn’t use his omega for the next few hours.  Tony was strapped into his crate, holes filled and penis feeding gag stretching his lips and throat. The exhausted omega was been fed his high protein goop, Jarvis having calculated that a much higher calorific meal replacement was needed to finally break up the remaining alpha based muscle tissue in his pecs and stomach.  Jarvis’s constant monitoring of the omega proving to be extremely valuable, Bruce only needed to intervene if there were physical injuries that needed medical attention that Jarvis could not provide through his use of one of the remaining suits or his many articulated tentacle arms.
So help me you fucking Alpha bastard you better do some thing or else I am never letting you stick your cock in me again!”
It was the simple collar that finally bought home to Tony that even though he was wearing an expensive item of bespoke clothing bedecked in millions of dollars of jewels, he was nothing more than an Omega Slave bound too and owned by his Alpha Master.
Pepper seethed as they went over all the contracts, the hard leather seat did nothing for her aching limbs and abused ass.  She could feel the cum dripping on  the rear of her skirt, her silk blouse plastered against her breasts, even her hair which she had managed to pull back in a loose ponytail was sticky, making her scalp itch.
“flyfille, such filthy sounds coming from out of you, see how wet and open you are to being fucked and abused.  Just a filthy Jotun omega, lowest of the low.
I have acquired a sample of his blood that I would wish you will ‘see’ with your all-powerful eye.  I would be remiss in my duty of care as Loki’s Alpha, to not find a solution to his barrenness. Loki cannot hope to pay for his past sins if he cannot perform his only duty as an omega.”
Steve knew that Tony would struggle with his task today, his sweet boy didn’t have a lot of experience with women, regardless of what the papers had published.  Women never wanted to admit they could not remember the night they spent with the playboy, so the legend had grown.
“Alpha Rogers we are pleased to announce that a vote was taken amongst the Elite Alphas board members and as a result Alpha Winters will be allowed to join as a member of the Elite Alphas and be able to attend meetings and social events as your Alpha partner.
This little omega cunt was under his protection, she was a pure breeder a rarity, he would talk to the healers in the morning, he had plans for this omega.
“Carry on Dr Banner, l am sure that Tony will keep quiet and still now until you are finished, if not my omega will receive a punishment spanking.”
“Do it Bucky, I want Tony to understand that he has no say in what decisions we make about his body, he is a bonded omega and we have the right to do as we please to ensure that the pups do not suffer because his tits cannot provide adequate amounts of milk.”
Informing the rest of the Avengers who all had knowing grins, that the penthouse would be on lock down for the next few days he strode to the waiting black SUV and ordered Coulson to drive him back to the tower.
The night before the Gala they were both on duty and watched as Potts was once again degraded and used by the Captain and the other Avengers.
“The half breed Jotun bitch has finally found it’s place in life.  I will grant you this boon on the understanding that you breed the whore continuously, all the alphas will train as warrior guardians, the betas as household staff and the omegas will be of service to the Royal Court.
Steve cleaned up his once again sleeping omega before climbing into bed himself.  Settling Tony onto his side he slid his cock into Tony’s pussy hole and pulled him tightly against his chest so he could suck on his bonding mark.  One hand found it’s way to his omega’s still forming breasts, cupping the small swollen mound he imagined them full of milk come the morning and his omega on his knees begging him to milk his swollen udders.
Tony go and sit on Mr Graham’s lap so he can have a good feel of the material and see how delicate the embroidery is.”
Taking a bottle of oil he liberally rubbed it all over Tony’s body and limbs until he glistened, droplets running down into his ass cheeks teased his furled hole making his cock twitch and slowly start to fill.
Not having a collar and leash to hand he looped the belt round Tony’s neck pulling it tight so that breathing would be uncomfortable but not dangerously so.  He wanted to keep Tony off balance and confused so he could get back to Stark Tower without him causing a scene.
His dusty pink nipples had deepened to a ruby red plump and tender to the touch, his engorged breasts full of milk ached as they rested on his rounded belly. Just the gentle brush of his fingers had his nipples leaking milk, rolling down in fat drops to soak the stretched skin of his belly.
By end of afternoon visiting hours all the cake had been consumed along with the smoothies and sandwiches Natasha has also packed, distracted by Clint’s antics, Bruce’s science talk and Thor’s Asgardian tales Tony had unconsciously consumed more food the he usually ate in a week. Natasha’s small satisfied smile as she brushed the crumbs from the corner of his mouth filled him with warmth, leaning in to her touch he quietly whispered thank you.
“Captain Rogers, her tits will grow at a normal rate for a twin pregnancy but her teats are going to get larger and thicker, at the moment they are an inch in thickness and length, but the special serum injected during her transformation at Mountain Rise Clinic means that they will grow at least another inch or more and half as thick again.”
Steve washed a very subdued and tearful Tony, who was wavering between headspaces. He decided that an enema was in order, as he knew that it always pushed him in to an older headspace and he needed that for the talk they were going to have.  It was time Tony faced the reality of the changes wrought on his body and what further changes would happen if he continued with such disobedient behaviour.
Reaching forward Winter took hold of the base of Tony’s butt plug whilst Steve grabbed hold of the dildo, smiling they began to slowly and torturously pull them from their respective holes.  Steve worked the dildo pulling it down a mere inch before thrusting it back up harder only then to drag it down two inches before again thrusting up with it again, over and over until only the head of the dildo was caught between the omega’s blood swollen pussy lips.  Winter pulled on the plug until the thickest part was stretching Tony’s hole obscenely wide, the poor omega assaulted in both holes was a babbling, quivering wreck.
Winter grinned at Steve’s deep groan as his knot popped, the bulging cheeks of their omega stretched taut round the knot was all it took for him to thrust balls deep and lock tight his knot, deep in the shaking meg’s tight passage.
As he talks, he makes sure to keep constant eye contact with Tony, as he slowly thrusts in, deeper and deeper until he bottoms out and Tony is pressed hard into the mattress, gasping at each hit against his prostrate.
The Co-ordinator bristled, offended at Ms Potts words, just as he opened his mouth to give a sharp retort he felt pressure on his arm.
He is not to be taken out of the crate until he is secured in his lab, and make sure that you lock him onto his specially designed stool, keep the muzzle on him at all times whilst he is out of the Compound.”
1.	Walk two paces behind and to the side, unless you are leashed, then the length of the leash will determine how many paces.
“Shhh sweetheart, don’t worry your pretty little head about anything, Daddy and Aunty Pepper have taken care of everything, remember?  I own Stark Industries now and Pepper runs it for me.  You will only work in your lab occasionally or attend functions when daddy says you can be a big boy.
Does Tony have a playroom in the Penthouse?  Right, I will send you an inventory of equipment that I want installed if not already in the room.  In storage there is a large crate, can you have it taken up and set up by the windows, I also want a new one set up on the Avengers floor in the same place.
Betty smiles as he helps her out the limo, keeping his hand on the small of her back as they walk up the steps into the Residence.
Steve watched as Tony’s tongue darted out to lick the last dribble of cum from his huge purple mushroom headed cock, globs of cum dripping down his cheeks.  His omega had woken him as he sucked down his cock, tongue dipping in to his slit when he pulled back just suckling on the head as if it were a tasty lollipop.  Tony’s cheeks were flushed as his eyes stared hungrily up at him as he when to town on his cock.
Boarding School had been a harsh reality check, nobody cared or liked him enough to get to know him, he had skipped grades so was in classes and dorms with older boys who just bullied and made fun of him for his small size and his intelligence which they hated as he constantly showed them up in lessons even though he did not mean to.
Steve screamed as he felt the scalpel cut into his skin, the pinch of the clamps against his balls and again at the shock of seeing them dangling from Bruce’s fingers.  Tears dripped down his face as he felt the scalpel cut into his penis, the burn and raw pain unbelievable.
Winter rubbed the soft spot on Tony’s neck to calm the agitated omega, Steve cupped his face, making Tony look up at him.
Steve knew that the pups were fine, he had already checked with Bruce on how long they could go without Tony ingesting his cum but Tony was unaware of this.  Stroking his quivering omega’s neck, he pressed down on the nerves and watch his omega’s body relax into submission.
‘Ben I will always love and hold you in my heart, but I need to look forward,  there is no changing what has happened these past few weeks, I must adjust and make the most of my new life, for Peter’s sake as well as my own.  Please forgive me but the thought of carrying pups, even though they are not my own fills that empty part of me, to no longer be that ‘poor barren omega’.
Sitting back on his heels he tried to look innocent but gave it up as pointless when he felt Loki’s cum dripping down his face.
“Such a good boy for your Sir, Pepper is lucky to have you as her friend, next time you can to eat her out, so that she is not a slutty mess after the two of you have had your fun.”
Today was going to be a silent day, May, had a feeding gag strapped to her mouth, he could see the thick fluid being forced fed down her throat, the faint whir of the electric pump sounding every time it released more nutrients.  Two of the girl pups were latched on to her breasts, greedily sucking on her teats, he felt an echo of an ache in his own chest, aware that this could have been his fate if Pepper had not seen his educational record and decided she wanted him indentured as a Stark Industry omega for his crimes and as her secondary omega at home.
Steve texted Natasha to advise her of the situation and to advise her to monitor Pepper’s behaviour whilst Jarvis would monitor her for any medical problems.
It was agony, his thighs were burning, and his knees hurt, he could feel his pussy starting to dry up after his fourth orgasm but had no idea how long he had been riding the wooden cock.  His brain was mush, he couldn’t even count out 10 seconds so he could pause for a tiny rest, so gone on the high of multiple climaxes.
I suggest that you check your history Director, look up the meaning of Afternoon Tea between two Alphas in the 1940s.”
By this time Tony had risen up and was standing in front of Pepper shaking with hurt and anger tears leaking from his eyes.  He reached out towards her wanting to try and shake the answer out of her, the disdainful look on her face hurting him even more.
Bruce was fascinated by the combination of surgery and magic used by the healers to remove both Petey and Loki’s cocks. Loki had to suffer through having both his Jotun then Asir cock removed, and his piss slit formed twice.  The healers tutted over Petey’s small pregnant belly, making him swallow a thick paste, informing Bruce to feed him a vial of it twice a day until the pup birthed. Petey would gain the pounds he needed, and the pups would be big and healthy, the hormones within the paste would calm him and settle the highly strung omega.
“Shit Natasha he doesn’t recognises me or my voice, fuck! I really thought he was Tony, what the hell are we going to do, we only have a few days until the Portal appears. How are we going to find Tony now, we cannot go back to the Compound, they will have realised that we are missing by now and that we have Stark.”
His nostrils flared, scenting the delicious, sweet smell of omega slick and cunt juice, he fetched up against the stall door, kicking it with his feet, wanting it open so he could find the omega, he knew it was futile, the stall had the appearance of being made of wood, but even with his enhanced strength he could not break it.  The scent grew stronger, he knew the omega would be tied to the fucking bench outside his stall for the next two hours, whining and moaning as its holes were pounded.  Every day his balls grew heavier, his cock stiffer, never going soft, as he was tormented by the heavy sex pheromones thrown off by the omega’s.
Steve and Winter locked eyes, they could smell the arousal pouring off their omega, their little bitch wanted to play. Leaning down he bit lightly against Tony’s bonding mark.
Steve could feel dark curls of lust rising as had watched Winter fuck Tony’s wide-open mouth, stroking his cock he quickly followed Winter’s release, ribbons of cum painting their omega’s face, mingling with the falling tears.
Winter flips the bitch onto her back after un-cuffing her hands and leash.  Startled eyes stare up at him as he looks over their prize.  The thin red leather straps of the harness crisscrossed golden skin, emphasising plump small breasts with their fat nipples, a round soft belly enticed him to roll the flesh between his fingers, pinching the extra nipples as the breeder moaned and spread their legs.
Steve continued rubbing circles on Tony’s back, peppering his forehead with soft kisses as his fragile husband work through what he had said.  Unable to resist he could not help slipping his hand under the blanket to feel the thick diaper covering Tony’s bottom, the crinkle of the outer covering had his cock twitching he had not expected his boy to be diapered so early on in his conditioning.
He drifted off to sleep a smile on his face, he was going to get his life back, he couldn’t wait to have Tony hanging off his knot again.
Steve’s hands squeezing his shoulders hard jerked him back to the present and the hard ridge of his Alpha’s cock against his crack sent shivers of need down his spine.  He could smell Steve’s arousal, the thought of being so close to getting fucked and satisfying his desperate craving for his Alpha’s cum had him picking up the next card.  He hated himself for what he was about to say and hoped that one day could rescind it.
Tony to his shame felt another gush of slick escape, the heat of arousal coiling in his belly.  He could feel his pussy clenching in time with his asshole, his empty holes desperate to be filled.
It was difficult to concentrate with Steve playing with his cock and his hard length rubbing along his crease, he could see Lydia watching, eyes fixed on his chubby cock, he was in turns embarrassed and aroused.   This was the kind of sex they had indulged in before everything went to shit, Steve loved to show him off in compromising positions and he got a thrill from the fear of being watched or caught.
“That’s it my omega such a good little bitch for your Alpha, now I want you to ride me whilst I play with your tits.  You want that don’t you come on say it out loud use those words you know I want to hear!”
Tony’s head started to feel fuzzy as Steve began to hum a familiar lullaby, he felt warm and comfortable as his diaper was tapped on, when his pacifier was pressed against his lips, he willingly opened them to suck on it, not even protesting when daddy fitted on his mitts.
Steve seeing Tony tense up and the angry flush on his face knew his omega was about to do something incredibly stupid, there was no way he was going to let Tony embarrass him in public.  Wrapping the leash round his hand he forced Tony’s head down until his forehead rested on the floor, backside raised up so his plugged holes and bejewelled cock could be seen by anyone who was standing behind him.  Biting down on his omega’s bonding mark he took the opportunity to whisper in Tony’s ear.
Tony crept into the nursery in the early hours of the morning, leaving his Alphas asleep, May, had two of the girls latched on and feeding, Maria was fast asleep in her crib, the boys cuddled together in two baby nests.  The two sets of twins were inseparable and cried if not within bodily contact of their sibling, Tony, gently kissed all his babies, before slipping back out to re-join his Alphas.
Don’t worry Tony can take a dozen, he has an advanced healing factor and this will count as his discipline for today for his earlier bad behaviour.”
“Well go on then, get it over with, just let me know how much Captain America is angry and disappointed in me and no longer wants to bond with such a useless omega.”
“Steve, I agree with Thor and so does the Hulk, with the right stud dog Pup could produce exceptional litters.  Also, breeding Pup would clearly show our pet his new role in life and keep him busy, so he would have less time for pining about his old life as Tony Stark/Iron Man.”
“Captain Rogers, my scans show that the person in the armour is an alternate version of Tony Stark, there are a few  anatomical anomalies that set him apart from our Beta Tony Stark, I would suggest moving him to Medical as he has some  internal injuries and a severe concussion.”
Steve left him to shower and clean himself inside and out, Jarvis controlled the flow of the enemas and forced him to hold the liquid for longer than was really necessary.  By the end he was sobbing and pleading with him to let him release the fluid.
Pepper screamed as he rammed his cock into her asshole with no preparation, the pain was unbelievable as he sawed in and out of her passage, the only lubrication his precum and her blood.
“Thank you, Sir can I have a Vodka Tonic with a twist of Lime.  It is so great that you are not a stick in the mud over alcohol like my parents.  They are so uptight, l am sick of ‘Betty don’t do that, don’t drink that, you can’t wear that.’
Steve escorts Tony down to his workshop afterwards and goes back up to Pepper’s office where he has asked for a meeting with them.  They are both shocked by his proposal, neither ever thinking that Tony would be willing to make such a major change in his life,  but both of them picture Tony’s behaviour at lunch and eventually they give their consent and sign as witnesses.  Pepper says she will handle all the paperwork herself, bring it for Steve to sign after they have bonded.  She will arrange a Press Release for five days time and an interview once they are both settle into their bond.  Steve assures Pepper that he wants her to continue as CEO, that nothing will really change in that respect apart from Tony having regular set working hours. Colonel Rhodes agrees that it is time to resign his commission and become a full time Avenger, he wants to be more hands on with the tech and the design and building of the armor.
He was not going to let the omega get big headed about a few simple repairs, he would need to earn any praise, being allowed to design and build him a new arm would be a good reward for the cocky omega.  He would ensure that Steve and he only allowed it once the omega fully showed proper respect and humility towards his Alphas.
“Come on lazy bones it’s time to get up, you need to shower and have some lunch before you doctor’s appointment.”
The only good thing that had happened was Betty Blue’s flight had been delayed so she had missed Gala and would be arriving today. She could only pray that Alpha would be too busy to meet her today, so that she would have time to warn her and get her to leave before her birthday tomorrow,  It wouldn’t matter if she did not presented on her birthday, Alpha would take her virginity anyway, she knew that look only too well, Uncle Jay had tried to force himself on her the afternoon of her sixteenth birthday.  It had been a horrible and humiliating experience, luckily, they were interrupted, and she managed to get away. Thankfully, she had not presented and had escaped to University soon after.
“Awww, poor little Natty, it’s such a shame you can’t see the final transformation.  In a moment the suite will lock in place and from now on you will never know any thing but the suit.  The technology is beyond anything available on the market today.  That is the one thing you can say about Stark, he was a genius in the advancement of nano technology.
“Dad, you should let her suck you off before we get home, her lips are sinful and she swallowed every drop, just like the whore she is.”
“Omega get up and stand in front of me it is time for your punishment, I have not forgotten your disobedience and the foul language you spewed recently.”
Now over the last six months we have lived a 24/7 Dominant/Submissive life- style, age play has been a large part of it and has helped you heal from your mental breakdown and drug addiction, when we get back to the Tower I will show you the contract you signed as my submissive.  The doctors here at Mountain View invested a huge amount of time and therapy to help you adjust to your needs and wants, to repair the damage you had inflicted on your body. iIt was intensive and invasive, but I wanted the best treatment possible for you.  Since you are under my conservatorship, I had and will always have the final say in what medical treatment you received.”
“Please, please, it’s too much, l can’t take anymore.   Please l will do anything you want if you take them off.”
“Sweetheart you get yourself into so much trouble by inadvertently speaking your thoughts out loud.  Now come along, I think you are going to be pleasantly surprised by the food you are going to be served.”
A few minutes later he watched as the snotty bitch’s eyes lost their focus as she slumped against her husband, the teacup falling to the floor.
Tony whimpered as his bladder gave in to the pressure, the warm pee quickly turning cold and uncomfortable against his padded bottom.  The cramps in his stomach didn’t ease up even though he had emptied his bladder, he cried out as the shooting pains became worse.
Now though you are going to spend the night with the Captain, he has already taken the edge of his anger with Pepper but he still needs to punish you for  your part in his omega’s escape.”
Steve moved to the front of the swing letting it gradually slow down, so he could film Tony, he knew it was only a matter of time before the pressure on his bladder became to much, then his bowels would follow soon after.  He had deliberately forgone his baby boy’s enema, Tony needed to experience the utter mortification of soiling himself so that he didn’t fuss so much about the daily enemas he was going to need now that his body had healed, and he was on a high calorie weight gain diet.
“Bruce, do you think that there is any chance that they will be able to locate our world and the Captain could come to reclaim Tony?”
“May cow, why the sudden change? don’t think you can fool me into thinking you have had a total change of heart, you are going to have to proof it with each session we have, until I believe that you are being truthful and not just pretending to accept you new position in life until you can escape.”
Nodding in agreement Steve sipped his coffee whilst keeping his eyes on the screen, Nurse Meyer had put up the safety rails on the large hospital bed, if it wasn’t for Tony’s unkempt goatee and stubble he would truly have looked like a small child asleep in a crib.
He watches as Tony’s expression morphs from the pained high of his last orgasm to one of devastation when he realises that it’s piss and not his cum that is running down the mirror.
“Mmm mmm  Alpha you have to fuck me, I’m so close to coming need you to finish me off, I’m so hard for you for the first time since the pups, feels so good please Alpha just need your cock to make this perfect.”
When the pups are bought in you will feed them, whilst the interview continues.  You will not speak without permission and I do not have to tell you how much you will be punished if those pups cry and disrupt the President when he is speaking.”
When he got out of here he was going to lock himself in his workshop for a week and cancel all Steve’s override codes as a punishment, he knew how annoyed it would make him not being able to drag him out to eat and sleep.
He will have his own surgeon do any other modifications as and when he decides, he also wants to break you himself, which l am quite happy to allow as l really don’t have the time to deal with you.
It was always a rush to have someone completely at his mercy, especially if it was an omega and doubly so when it was his own omega, his little alien meg truly had no idea that Steve as his Alpha could do absolutely anything he wanted to him and not suffer any consequences for his actions.
“Stop that naughty little omega, you will take what l give you and sit quietly on my cock looking pretty.  You have three chances to behave, if you get to the end of the film l will allow you to choose three of your favourite desserts to eat all by yourself.
“Hey Stevie, why haven’t you got rid of this useless little thing yet?  Make the little bitch all nice and smooth, seeing as you have already got rid of his little balls.  Could just leave the rubber bands on and wait for it to shrivel up and drop off just like a lamb’s tail.”
“See my Prince, such a pathetic little nub, do you want me to ring this and stretch it? Jotun breeder slaves have their clits enlarged and stretched so that they can be pulled through their cunt rings and locked away.
His girls were growing and the twin alpha boys, would be two in a month.  These hybrid pups were huge and he was in constant pain, due to his small size.
At this point he had lost his temper and told his Alpha he could ‘always fuck off and find some simpering, whiney submissive bitch to knock up and live happily ever after with.’
“I am so sorry Steve, l can’t help it, whatever that bastard did to me when he removed my penis, just makes it happen sometimes when l become over stimulated.”
“Agent Barton there are a few options that as your pet’s owners you will need to consider and decide on. You can let nature take its course and see what happens over the next few months, the drawback to this is that you will not be able to make full use of your pet sexually as the glands and anal passage will not be able to cope with multiple owners making use of it continually.
“Look at you, such a wanton omega cow!  Could not wait for your Alpha, dirty little bitch look at the mess you have made of yourself.
Buck’s, no he needed to stop thinking of him as Bucky, this was Winter, there newly acquired Timber Wolf Pet.  Pepper had already filed the paperwork and Bruce had branded and chipped him whilst he was knocked out the previous night after Steve had finally come to terms with the fact there was no way of getting his Bucky back.
Once again, she was covered from head to toe in her body suit, she still had mild   panic attacks if all her senses were cut off but Natasha had Jarvis warn her beforehand, so she could try to prepare herself. Pepper didn’t have that luxury and would flail around until Brutus or Zeus pinned her down.
As the warm creamy milk began to flow down into his stomach he realised how hungry he actually was and began to suck faster on the teat, he was to tired to care about voice in his head telling him that this was all wrong and he needed to fight.  Soon his tummy felt full, so he tried to push the teat out of his mouth.
It had only taken a moment after the loud obnoxious little man had entered the Heli- Carrier conference room for Steve to know that the Omega was his and that nothing or no one was going to stand in his way of claiming him.  Stark’s scent was bitter sweet, tainted with the smell of alcohol and metal.  Stress and anxiety underlay the projected air of confidence and arrogance.
Tony is confused and upset, Nurse Stella doesn't help matters and why does she keep calling him and 'O' boy, what does it mean?
Thirty minutes later Nurse Meyer led him through a second set of security doors to the suite where Tony would be staying until his Conditioning had been successfully completed.  The lounge area had soft carpeting with low cushioned sofas, the large screen TV had the appearance of a mirror when not in use. An arch way led dining area with a small fully functioning kitchen off to one side.  Frosted glass panelled doors led to the guest bedroom and en-suite.  Steve looked round in approval it was understated yet tastefully done with no hint of this being part of a medical facility.
Once his knot deflated enough, he pushed Tony to her knees and had her suck him off whilst he finished showering.
Tony lay watching his new pups sleep, taking no notice of the midwife removing the placentas and cleaning him up, he was exhausted but proud that he had birthed his babies without any help, just as was expected of a traditional pregnancy and birth.   He watched as his Alphas scent marked their pups, then brought the girls out to scent and bond with their brothers, he drifted in and out of sleep, drinking the shakes that appeared before him without complaint. When each pup woke, he cradled them to his breast, humming softly as they fed, skin on skin he breathed in their scent as they did his.
His omega was once again flushed pink with exertion and unfulfilled arousal.  His breeding pouch was firm and round the pups protected behind layers of cum induced fatty tissue and the now hard lining of the breeding pouch, a scan tomorrow would confirm how many pups and this would be announced at the Maria Stark Charity Gala that same night.
“Oh, is my sweetie tired, has my little twink run out of energy, just close your eyes baby, I will take care of everything.”
Steve watched as Tony’s eyes flited between the large slice of cake and the bowl of grapes that Thor was holding in readiness.  Over the last couple of days his omega’s appetite had steadily grown but the omega’s psychological and physiological need to eat had not fully developed and unless they could get him up to the required minimum weight gain over the next 3 days, he would have to stay in hospital for a further length of time.
“Good morning gentlemen and Miss Potts, I want to keep this meeting brief and on point.  My omega will give his presentation of the R&D department’s projects and nothing more, once done he will not be participating any further in this board meeting it is no longer his place to do so.
“I think my little twink is really keen to be a film star, lets call the director over and see if he can find a part for you.”
Also, having scanned his womb you have successfully impregnated him, just as you surmised.  It will be a few weeks before we will know how many pups he is carrying.”
Steve didn’t bother to inform Tony how turned on it made him to think of how humiliated Tony would be to be seen hanging off his knot when not in his baby headspace.  He could feel his cock hardening just at the image of his red and tearstained boy’s face.
Placing him on his knees with his head resting on his folded arms in the now empty bath, he pulled out the butt plug from his little one’s raised backside replacing it quickly with the lubed enema nozzle, sliding it deep into his bottom.  Turning on the tap he watched as the warm water flowed down the tube to disappear into Tony’s clenching hole.  Steve pushed apart his baby’s thighs so he could watch as his tummy began to bulge as it filled with water.  Reaching between the spread thighs he fondled Tony’s flaccid penis and balls, something would have to be done about them if they, his baby boy had no need for a penis that size!
Now if you have finished with your idiotic lecture on how one should comport themselves during labour you can go and plant your ass back on that sofa and stay the hell away from me, because I am going to scream and bloody well swear as much as I fucking want to until these little buggers come out.”
Peter screamed and begged for the torture to stop, he became even more hysterical when he realised that May was now watching him intently, he didn’t understand why she was smiling at him, after Karl finished whispering something to her.
A few of the board members chuckled and muttered their approval at Steve’s words, unclipping the leash he motioned for Tony to get started.
I suggest that you sit down and think through everything l have said before you fly of the handle and say something that will end up with you over my knee, being disciplined.
Gripping the top of the sound he pulled it out, just as his knot engaged.  He could feel Tony’s whole, body shuddering as he was finally allowed to climax, the tiny dribble of cum was pathetic compared to the river of cum flooding from his cock into Tony’s belly.
Before he left to meet with Bruce, he placed some soft cuffs on Tony’s wrists, clipping them to the bed.  Tony looked so beautiful covered in his marks, his thighs spattered with dry cum and slick.  Taking a large plug from his bedside drawer he gently worked it in passed the swollen ring to sit it deep in the omega’s hole.
Steve roars as his orgasm hits, mindlessly grabbing his omega’s head he pushes him back down on to his cock until his face is pressed against his groin holding him in position as his cum floods down in to his omega’s stomach.
Please Tony, you want to make me relaxed and comfortable, don’t you?   That’s it baby, now add another finger, ahhhhhh, you have such little fingers, come on push them right in, find my sweet spot.
There is a backroom with no windows and only the door into main room that is suitable for keeping the omega secure until they can determine who he is and if not their Tony they will give him the choice of returning with them or being released once the Portal appears.
Loki trembled as Odin’s hands circled his neck, ancient magic burning his skin as Odin cast his spell, the moment the spell settled he felt the weight of the metal neck ring.  The knife sawing his braid off to expose all the fertility ring, broke him and tears flowed, he might hate his Jotun heritage, but he knew what an insult it was to cut even a Jotun omega’s long hair.  Loki would never be welcome in his birth land, one of the harshest punishments on Jotun was to be shorn and unable to braid and embellish your hair to show your status.
"Tony will be bred by Winter and myself until the Omega Rights Law is repealed and Packs are again officially recognised.  Once the Avengers are given the official status of a War Pack and have their special protections reinstated then I will discuss this matter again.”
Thor please can l have Loki’s tits until the baby pops? Promise I won’t drink him dry, well not all the time.
The sun was beating down as he slowed to a walk, scanning the area he made out a darker shape in the distance, it looked as though it could be another cabin.  It seemed like hours of walking and resting, before he reached the cabin, his skin was burnt, his feet covered in blisters.
Huffing he managed to crawl into the large nest he had made in the centre of the lounge, soft large round mattresses filled the whole of the sunken floor raising it on level with the surrounding sofas, pillows and blankets and items of pack clothing covered the top mattress.  Tony had taken great delight in placing each item of stolen clothing on display in his nest.  Once placed in a pregnant omega’s nest no one could remove them until after the birth.
“Go do your hair in a high ponytail, l want full makeup, use the same lipstick as yesterday, makes you look like a whore.
They were nearly back to the jet when the ground shook and an almighty roar ripped through the air. Widow and Tony were knocked flying as a huge green mass barreled into the Professor.
This kind of behaviour is not acceptable, you will sit quietly and eat everything I give you or you will receive a further ten swats on top of the ten swats you have already earned.”
Tony was not happy about being pulled from his lab, but Bruce just growled and dragged him up to his room and ordered him to shower.
“Poor little omega Tony, did you really think that I would not give you a more personal mark to show that you are my fully bonded omega. The one on your neck is for public view and the one on your arm is a requirement of the State.  I want you to have something more personal, a constant reminder that you are mine.”
Have decided to concentrate on finishing this one, as it is difficult remembering all the different stories and what has happened in them.  Have to keep going back and reading through them as I have an incredibly bad memory.
Now I have been very generous in adapting my needs and wants to suit you and help you get over the trauma caused by Ty and you own foolishness.   I have set aside my desire to have a baby to care for and am willing to allow time and therapy for you to heal and adjust once again.
The next time he woke up, he was back in the hospital bed he had been lying in a few weeks ago. Carefully, he opened his eyes and tried to understand what he saw.
The Figure moved very quietly into the room, no sound was heard. The Person knew exactly that the last visitor had left fourteen minutes ago. Now was the time to go inside. Almost sceptically, The Person watched down at Tony Stark, who lay lifeless on the small, white bed. Sores on the head were sewn and the right arm was sheathed, but The Person needed to know more. Slowly, The Figure pulled the blanket from under the weak arms of the mechanic and opened the hospital clothes with the utmost ease. Although Stark had invested a lot of money in the best equipment, he had insisted on such hospital shirts. They should be better for the patients if the doctor must open the shirts without having to lift the body.
Furthermore, if I make grammar mistakes or something, please tell me and I'm trying to fix and remember it. I know it can be super annoying if somebody just doesn't seem to be able to write correctly.
"Show yourself," he called into the brief pause the stranger put in. "We all know you no longer need braces."
Steve stared at him calmly. In a low voice, he asked, "Who do you want to shoot with that gun," and pointed to the pistol, which was still aimed to his chest.
A garbage can was in front of it and almost overflowed and papers and cardboard covered the narrow sidewalk in front of it. Teenagers heard loud music in an alley next to the house, which made Tony just roll his eyes.
He stared back. His breathing was faster, for the murderer of his parents, his mother's murderer, was sitting there, a few feet away, as if nothing had happened. Tony noticed that Barnes had knotted his hands together, staring intently at the hologram. His jaw muscles tensed, but then Steve clapped his hands on his lap.
"Up, Rhodes," he shouted to him. One of Burkwill’s fighters was loading a weapon that was too big for the armor to withstand. The other responded quickly and intuitively. A tree behind him went up in flames after a loud bang.
"Show me Mrs. Potts, Mr. Lang, Wilson, Dragenbach, and Khatib," he answered instead, just a little louder. He was still staring at the man's hair in front of him, avoiding his eyes. Burkwill laughed. "Immediately. But don't you think it would be polite to look at me when you talk to me, Stark? As a small excuse for what you did."
Steve released his hand from Tony's back to wipe his face. The mechanic took the opportunity and pushed away from him. Steve's eyes were red and swollen when Tony looked at him. "Seventy years ago, the world had thought that Captain America died, forever. And yet you are here. And Bucky, too. You have both been frozen for a lifetime. He can get a few bullets, Steve. Hey, do you want to go to him? That might help."
He had talked to him a third time when Tony had fallen asleep during the day, waking up in his workshop, shivering and sweat-drenched. His thoughts were interspersed with people who called him a murderer and dead friends. Cities had blown up in his dream and he knew perfectly well that it had been his fault. The tears had blocked his view and air had barely gotten into his lungs when the panic did not fade even after waking up. Friday had informed Steve and he had come immediately. By chance, he and Bucky had just been in the elevator, which only opened when the level of the workshop was reached. Tony had sat against the table, sitting on the floor, ignoring the injured man's presence, only feeling the big, warm hands brushing his back slowly and regularly. It was less than ten minutes that passed before Tony had calmed down, but his stomach was rebelling and he spitting out everything that had accumulated in the last few days.
"Do I know where the six are?" the stranger continued. By now, the British accent annoyed Tony immensely. "That's probably the question you all ask yourself. Well, it is to be expected. You all must be sick with worry. After all, agents are missing, and much worse, Avengers. Yes, I know where the five are."
"It's okay," Steve interrupted. One clearly heard her Spanish accent when speaking. Then she turned to Tony. "Mr. Stark, I'm glad to meet you."
Pepper had ordered him to sleep, but it seemed to have made things worse. Had he better kept talking to her, that helped, even if it was late at night, thanks to the time difference. Ever since the incident in Siberia, it had become an almost daily routine to talk to her, even though she could not get away from her location in California and Tony couldn’t leave Rhodey alone in New York. He missed her, he missed that he had someone with him who knew everything, with whom he could talk about everything.
He was bad, and he had a headache. The doctors had examined him very closely. A wound on his upper body had become infected and one of the nurses had given him an ointment on the open area, which then burned and twitched, but at least not as bad as the arm and the ribs. But his blood levels had not improved and it should be re-examined.
Friday spoke up again almost a minute later. "As far as I found out, it has only been approved that the creatures were coming from another planet," the AI said, and Tony wiped his hand over his forehead.
Abbie Lopez drank some of the wine and touched her temple. "I had been drinking that evening, maybe a little too much. My no ex-wife was in New York at that time and I was on this stupid trip in Europe. This pub was a few hours from Trondheim. I had a hotel in a small village, a few hundred people live there. The pub was small and stuffy but had a TV and a lot to drink. I saw what happened and my wife did not answer. For hours! I feared the worst, that's why I drank. Then, sometime that night, she finally wrote me she was fine."
"Get out of your suit. You cannot talk like that to a woman. So cold and ... metallic." Burkwill gestured and the monster let go of Tony. He stumbled forward a few steps before he could catch himself. He stared at Burkwill but then nodded. Without needing to do anything, his suit fell away and placed itself just a few seconds later as a suitcase next to him. Burkwill clapped and Tony ran to Pepper in his wet clothes.
roared behind Tony and the mechanic winced. Burkwill shouted something in the language of the creature, but Vision already answered Tony.
"The video," he said, sticking a stick into a laptop, as Friday did not work here anymore, "provides a clue to the whereabouts of Helmut Zemo and Lang, Wilson, Khatib and Dragenbach. Of course, by being a live broadcast, we can rule out much of the world. It's summer in the northern hemisphere, in New York it was shortly after five at the beginning of the video."
He should go out again, she said, to sleep as one should, not only once a week in his own bed and otherwise in the cot in the workshop, but for a long time, eight hours a day in his room. Maybe get a man or a woman if it helped.
"Boss, I cannot see the screen," said Friday. "The program does not let me see the window, but everywhere in the headquarters, it should be on screens. Rogers is on his way to you."
"The plan makes more sense," he admitted. "You all stay in place; as soon as Burkwill announces something, turn us in and we'll create a plan. Until then, we'll just send our agents through the city, maybe they'll finally find something, but you'll stay calm. Sleep well, until he gives real tips, rest. We need you ready for action."
"Because he did what you've done all these months? Come to my workshop and keep me from working?", he asked, trying to sound angry.
With unsure steps, she came up to him and shook his hand. "Captain America!" She cried. "Please excuse the mess. If I had known you were coming, then- "
Steve had betrayed him, had fought him, placed the friendship with a murderer over friendship with him. And now all memories came back to Tony.
And even if Steve liked him, they would never be friends anymore, because the fight a few months ago had changed everything between them. Tony wanted to sink in the ground. "I ..." he began to explain quietly but stopped when Burkwill went on. He felt Steve's eyes on him.
Steve nodded beside Tony and kept looking out. The mechanic turned to Natasha but could only see her back. Then he pushed away from the window and went on to the stairs. He could not wait forever. Steve stopped by the window for a moment, then turned to follow Tony. "It looks a bit like Brooklyn back then," he said, to start a conversation.
"Stark, is Friday working again?" Fury turned to him. Now he looked angry and obviously tried not to shout completely. Tony was torn from his stupor. Quickly he looked at his cell phone, on which the small symbol in the upper corner shone again. He nodded. "She's back."
"This is the most recent picture we could find of him. He does not appear in public very often, which makes him even more interesting to the media if he breaks his principles. For more than seven years, however, nobody has shot a picture of him. From his residence in a suburb of London, he gets by private car into his private plane, practically right on the doorstep of his home in Buenos Aires, New York, Seattle, Beijing, Hong Kong and so on. Almost all over the world, he owns smaller or larger properties, meets with his clients and disappears again. Most of the time nobody knows where he is. Sometimes he starts several planes, so the press does not know where he lands.
"We'll check the video and track the names," Natasha explained, quickly recovering her composure. "As it stands, we are through with Burkwill. We have ... A press conference is scheduled for Monday morning."
"I'm sorry," Tony managed to whisper. He pressed his head tighter against Steve and pressed his hand against the muscular back of the larger.
Tony was about to say no, he did not feel like spending more time with Steve, and the fact that the soldier was in Europe more than seventy years ago would not help him, but Natasha stared warningly at him. She was probably right. Probably Steve and he would have to return to a reasonably professional base, even though it could not be like it used to be. But the others needed them both as the people to hold on. Or at least they needed Steve and then Tony's ideas and resources, and Steve got that faster when he worked with him. And worked well.
With one last murmured "help", Tony closed his eyes exhaustedly and was sure that he would never open them in this cave again.
Daytimes, the dark glass on both sides of the corridor was supposed to mirror people who were running around here. It would not allow them to take a look into the rooms with the ultramodern equipment.
"You wanted - what?" Tony ran a hand over his eyes. He worked the whole day off and the others thought about pizza and even took his time.
Steve put himself in an attack position and put his hand over his ear. "Are you still with me?" He asked the others to find out why his earpiece had made such noises.
Excitedly, Steve went on. Adrenaline rushed through his body as he found more and more parts of the Iron Man Suit.
"What's that?" Steve asked the artificial intelligence that was also installed on the plane. He nodded toward a very long island that built up like a wall off the coast.
"Please let them bring one of these critters into my workshop. I'll take a closer look. If the people of SHIELD don’t manage that, I'll have to go back."
Sighing, Steve threw himself back at the couch. "It's getting more and more twisted. Has anyone declared to be the offender yet?"
It ran clumsily toward him and Steve focused on the spot at the neck, on which the monsters were killed instantly.
The so-called 'Civil War' was over, he had even dropped his façade for a moment, a moment just with Steve. As much as he wanted, he could not be mad at Barnes, and Rhodey walked again as if nothing had ever happened to him.
Relieved, Steve breathed. Clint seemed relieved as well, he noticed, and Natasha leaned back a little further. Steve smiled briefly for the good news. "It's good. Do we know anything new about the monsters?"
"You are too early," Tony greeted Burkwill, hoping that the man would even be on the other side. He still could not see anything. The rain took away his view and almost swallowed his words.
Steve swallowed. What now? They had to defeat the thing. With the time passing more and more monsters crawled out of somewhere in that ship. He had to get into the building.
"The tree," Pepper whispered weakly, just loud enough for Tony to hear. "Do you really have something -"
Rhodey could eventually persuade Tony to go to sleep for a few hours. Both had laid down on the couch, which was still in the lab and for a moment Tony had hoped that next to him would not be Rhodey but Steve. That the breathing next to him, which became more and more regular over time, would suit the soldier, not to Rhodey, but then he focused his thoughts again. No matter what would happen in the next few days, he should not be distracted by his feelings. He knew what he really wanted now for a few hours more than ever before, at least that's how it felt, but he could not let it happen.
Natasha raised her eyebrows. She still didn’t know what had happened that Tony was so mad at Steve, and she would have liked to say she didn’t care, but she couldn’t.
Tony felt the grip on his arm loosen slightly as Steve processed the information. Tony's mouth opened again. The son of the man had died twenty-four years ago.
As if at a command, the two aliens stepped aside and another person stepped out from behind. "No," Tony whispered and then shouted, "No!"
Fury nodded in agreement. "So it might have been a long-term planned attack. We have to act like more will follow."
"No," Vision contradicted. "Excuse me, but I do not need a comfortable bed. It is most logical if you occupy all the beds and I stay here in the living room if there are only six correct sleeping places."
Steve's gaze was still on the new plane. He waited for another person to come out. But nobody did. His eyes searched the sky, he looked around the battlefield. Something in him broke when he realized that Tony Stark hadn’t come.
His chest was shaking with panic, and again he felt the coughing sensation, but then he could finally regain control of his suit.
would not have gotten out. But we all in this room know what happens; how it feels when innocents die."
As he talked he could see Rhodey stiffen. The other Avengers looked shocked, too. Fury raised his shoulders again and stared at Steve with his jaw compressed.
Tony took a deep breath and slowly moved away from the slippery branch on the side of the tree where Burkwill and his people would hopefully not recognize him so quickly.
"You're bleeding," the other replied, ignoring the mechanic. Tony looked at his hand. He did not realize he had cut himself. Slowly and carefully Steve came towards him, the door to the workshop fell softly behind him into the lock. Tony himself did not move. Just watched the other man walk up to him slowly. Tony could clearly see the soldier trying to hide the tremor in his hands. The knot in his chest threatened to take his breath away.
They had been looking for Steve and Rhodey for over two hours now and hadn’t found anything yet. Concern about the three missing men was clearly written in their faces. Bucky tapped his foot restlessly on the floor, while Natasha stood silently at the window and just stared down.
"Hey," he said, trying to sound calm and strong as he knelt beside her. "It’ll be alright. You're out of here soon. You're all out soon," he said to the other two.
"Then it’s their fault if that doesn’t work out now," he finally whispered, pulling the soldier down to him.
"Where do I have to go?" he asked weakly and felt the eyes of others on him. Steve stammered a bit, but the noise in Tony's ears was too loud for him to understand. Rhodey's mouth opened in disbelief, but Tony did not care. He did not care if nothing else went according to plan. The psychopath had Pepper, the only person who had been with him throughout the last few months.
Tony had barely touched his pizza when the alarm rang. The pizza was cold by now, but the fat had disturbed his work and, in addition, his hunger had flown away relatively quickly, after Rhodey had given him not only lunch but also a terrible tincture, which he had to eat according to the doctors. It was now close to five, the meeting was scheduled to start in less than ten minutes.
The cameras first showed the crowded room and were then focused on the wooden table, which was being used by the Avengers, who were greeted with applause. Cameras zoomed in on Steve and Tony made a face as the man waved awkwardly at the cameras.
Natasha opened her mouth, but Clint was faster. He had a stitched wound on his forehead, as Tony noticed, and leaned over to be closer to the microphone.
A sting pierced his chest as he thought it was true. He claimed he was fighting the bad guys, but how many innocent people had been killed?
Rhodey ran straight for Tony and Pepper and stopped short of them. "You don’t know how scared I was," he continued softly, pushing himself into the embrace. "You could have told me something, I would have come along. But alone?" Rhodey's voice broke at the end and he quickly hid his face in Tony's hair. "If you do that again, I'll kill you, Stark, I promise you."
It was Thursday when the news came. Two days before the birthday, two days before the deadline had expired. The workshop was silent as the loud noise tore Tony out of his concentration. Neither Rhodey, nor Steve or Natasha or anyone else had been down here today. His teammates trained, searched or worked like him and the time to meet was short.
Natasha looked at the cameras again. She even smiled slightly, but Tony was sure she was hating this inside. After all, it was also about her. She was very fortunate that Ross had not pursued her crime at the German airport, and now she has been noticed again.  Cleverly, she threw her hair from her forehead.
Tony clapped his hands and ran as best he could, without showing his pain, to the big table in the middle of the room.
Tears of happiness formed in his eyes, which he quickly blinked away. "Tony? Tony! Stark, where are you?" he shouted as loud as he could. He didn’t care anymore if anyone else could hear him. Tony had to be here, he just had to. As if he had gotten new power, he now ran to the parts. Unbelievable joy came over him when he realized that the mechanic somehow got all the parts at the beach. He came closer and closer to a big sandstone.
Tony had grown louder and had raised his hand menacingly. Natasha looked at him with raised eyebrows and folded arms. "Forget it," he finished. "What do you know about the critters?"
The handsome man's hand was on the shoulder of the younger and smaller woman who laughed happily at the camera. On her arm, she held a baby, who looked startled, and in front of her stood a perhaps seven-year-old girl in a floral dress next to her younger brother, who wore typical pants for the 1940s. The picture was taken in a studio because the background was clearly a wallpaper.
"Why are you here?" Tony asked eventually when the piercing look of Steve began to worry him. He did not understand. He wanted so much more to do with the soldier, and he also knew that neither he, nor Barnes could be blamed for anything that had happened to his parents, or that Steve had opted in the agreement what he felt was right, but still. He became restless under the eyes and felt uncomfortable.
Steve sighed. "Then let's hope we can offer them what they want. And then, hopefully, we'll have our rest. Aren’t there any other problems right now?" he voiced his thoughts from the plane.
Tony's body cramped in pain, but he kept watching, unable to escape. The brown-haired man did not even look at the wounded woman, but grabbed her neck with his uninjured arm and squeezed. Maria Stark had no way to defend herself and after a few seconds, she also lifelessly slumped into her seat. The Winter Soldier looked emotionlessly into the distance before turning to Tony and pointing the pistol at him. The shot was loud and echoed through the forest in the cold night.
With little conviction, she shook his hand and gestured for the three to sit down. Tony pushed a chair around and was glad to finally be able to relax his ribs, even though the cold and hard wood was not as comfortable as a bed or upholstered chair.
He pushed his way through the small alley, which the security tried to keep in line under great difficulty, right behind Natasha.
"No, you don’t have that, Stark, that's right. But they have trading partners who can adjust the supplies, and then the production."
The man smiled. "Please, please. Don’t be so rude. I would like to – my bloody goodness, someone please bring the man cough medicine," he interrupted himself. Tony tried to suppress the new coughing attack, but tears only pressed into his eyes, he vigorously tried to wink away. Steve was already slapping him on the back, but nothing eased in his lungs.
Burkwill had expected everything, made it into a real show. Again, a torrent of nausea came up in him, but he could swallow the feeling. His brain started working again. They had to do something unexpected. Something not even Burkwill could foresee, who seemed to know everything. Who had played a role, perhaps only for the drama.
The Russian sighed. "He never told me what happened. But we all understood that it was bad. He’s still Tony. He’s resilient and will recover. Your shield was down at the lab the whole time and he was also working on a prototype for new suits for all of you. He still has you on the screen, just give him the time he needs. But don’t forget that we’ve got other tasks as well."
Steve nodded. "Of course. See you soon?" He addressed the others as he slowly pushed Tony up. "Who is old here now?" He murmured, laughing, but then stood up and grabbed Tony's hand.
"He's been giving information to Burkwill all along," Tony told Steve, knowing that the others could all overhear him via intercom. "He has the whole time - I could have known it. I created him, shit."
Tony saw Wanda look down in dismay, realizing that Vision stepped back three steps as if to give them both space and privacy. Tony dared to glance briefly at Steve. He stared open-mouthed at the screen, but Tony could also see that he had blushed as if it really was something he knew. The mechanic hardly dared to hope.
"Agents are on their way to potential cities and looking around to see if they can find anything," Fury said loudly to everyone but looked at Tony, who put his arm over his mouth to cough aloud.
Without hesitation, Friday had given them the coordinates of their aircrafts, and just less than an hour later - the plane was nowhere near as fast as the other two's - they landed nearby them.
Not a single sharp piece of metal was in his reach, he had thrown everything away. Probably as a precaution, but he hated himself for it now. He would like nothing better than a quick, painless end. He did not want to die of thirst or blood loss. He hated the furry feeling in his mouth and he hated the headaches that got worse with every passing minute.
Too slow for Clint's wishes, he could bring the plane to a halt. The two others hectically moved behind him. While Natasha fetched a first-aid kit, Bucky tried to pull a daybed out of the medical room. The rush didn’t make it easier for Clint to land well, but when he finally opened the doors, the two were gone immediately. He also unbuckled himself, took another bottle of water and jogged off the plane.
Tony had seen this Air Line a few times but had never flown with it before, but now it drew his attention.
When he let his eyes slip through the workshop, he tensed completely. He cleared some things from a cupboard yesterday but did not notice what was behind it due to his fatigue. The round shield with the star in the middle almost grinned at Tony.
For a moment it was very quiet. Then Rhodey faced Steve. "You're not the one holding the Avengers together. You're the one that made us sit here without Tony."
The farewell had been difficult, especially after such a short time, but it was the best for them all. Tony had enough to do with Steve, who had barely left the building since it was clear what would happen to Bucky. He had helped and helped him, but a best friend remained a best friend.
Tears flowed from Pepper's eyes, which were red and swollen. Violet edges framed them, clearly coming from punches. The nose was visibly broken and blood covered the whole face. The lips were cracked and a wound on her forehead festered and bleeded at the same time. She looked like she was about to fall over.
He should not be distracted, because that would mean that he would make mistakes and mistakes could have life-threatening consequences.
," he suddenly said loudly. Tony winced almost imperceptibly. Burkwill added something in a language Tony had never heard before. It reminded him of Jawaese from
"Either you're dead or I am. Or both of us. The hate of your comrades will be too great for them to let me live. They are predictable, you may almost say stupid. I don't know how it will end. If I kill you, it will not safe my children. But I will have done to you and your friends what you did to me. I'll get my revenge and it will be beautiful.
"Oh no," Burkwill called. "Tell them why you're really here. Make sure Stark suffers - that he's going to suffer terribly when I cut your mendacious neck."
His brain stopped working, Tony thought. He had closed his eyes and felt only the touch on his lips, until Steve broke away to take a breath. He still felt the other's taste on him.
he rolled his eyes in annoyance. Fury said a few seconds ago that no further information would be given.
In his suit, he flew over the sea of lights of the state's capital, as Friday reported him a message. He accepted it, almost curious of what would happen.
"Shit," said a voice in the video. "You can’t see anything. It's too dark," the man had apparently turned his head because the voice had become quieter. For a long time the sentence echoed and also the steps of the persons could be heard. "Here is Samuel Wilson, Avenger and on behalf of SHIELD in Norway. This is a distress signal. I repeat, a distress signal."
The look he gave Steve was tired and the soldier cautiously stepped one step at the other. "You don’t have to believe me, but I just want the best for Tony. I never intended to hurt him. "
"Well spoken, yesterday," he replied, ignoring her question. He kept walking, careful not to limp too much. A few bruised ribs and the minor leg injuries could not restrict him that much.
The silence that spread was even worse than the one before it. Burkwill had made a mistake. Vision would not ask him for a second chance. Vision had taken the second chance and played it out. He was not here anymore. Tony swallowed. In the corner of his eye, he could see Wanda turning away and putting a hand to her mouth. Still, he could hear the murmur that left her mouth. For a moment his gaze was fixed on the girl, who had lost so much in the last few years, but then Burkwill went on.
Tony quickly tried to redirect his thoughts and moved his left arm, which worked just fine. Slowly, to avoid unnecessary pain he lifted it. He reached out and tried to grab a small hollow in the sand, where some old parts of his destroyed suit had accumulated.
"Nothing," Rhodey called frantically. Tony saw his buddy battling with several creatures while bullets flew at him.
Tony moved again for the first time. A stinging pain suddenly passed through his body, but he tried to ignore it. Vision looked down again as Tony stared at him. The feeling of tightness overcame him again and his chest moved sharply, but then his gaze fell back on Pepper, who was now leaning against Agent Dragenbach, looking as if she was about to fall into unconsciousness.
Often he still saw the wormhole or the fight with Steve and Barnes. It hurt, but when he saw his parents, he always remembered his childhood. All the things he'd buried so well in the last years.
Tony saw the horror in Steve's eyes and heard Clint whisper something that sounded like a curse. Friday switched Tony into the other's voice system just when Clint ended.
Tony could see quick glances from the others to Fury, seemingly just getting new information. He sighed.
"East Harlem," Natasha explained. "A district of Manhattan, north of the central park. A rundown area."
He had told Pepper everything and at some point, after talking to him for many days with various arguments, he had realized that Barnes had been brainwashed and that Steve had defended him for that reason.
Glances from the other Avengers rested on Clint. This speech seemed to be a spontaneous one. The others nodded approvingly. Steve looked at him, smiling wearily, and Barnes stopped playing on his jacket. Vision kept looking straight ahead, but even Wanda and Fury smiled reassuringly at him.
"We hadn’t had time anymore," Tony continued, trying to get a bit more into a straight position. He hated it when he looked powerless, and he definitely did in that moment. Sunk in the pillow of the huge bed and his arm in a sling. And if he looked only half as tired as he felt, he certainly would not be a big eye-catcher.
Clint focused on flying, only occasionally throwing a few sidelong glances at his two colleagues. He knew the two were very worried. Even Bucky, who was always very closed up in their time together, showed emotions. When they fled together, Clint always considered the strange man to be an emotionless wreck who only communicated with others, if at all, in a few words. But while he had exchanged only a few words a day with Bucky - and he was already on top of the list of frequent callers - he and Steve had often been in the conversation for hours. Although Clint had rarely overheard them, it was obvious that Steve was the only person in Bucky's life who could gain a lot of trust. And now that person was gone.
"Hmm," Tony muttered and let himself fall onto the chair. He pushed his hand over his face and just waited for a second.
It was still bright outside, but the first signs of dusk were already noticeable. More and more lights illuminated the streets of New York and made the evening bustle even clearer. Several cars were in a long traffic jam, from which Steve couldn’t even see the beginning. Clenching his throat, he shook his tie.
Burkwill took the initiative, he spoke in a completely crazy voice. "The headquarters of you are unprotected. I could have gone in for the last three months and just killed you, Stark. You are a wreck, mentally and physically. It would not have been a hassle to fulfil my promise to my people or to avenge my children. But your friend here found me and convinced me that there are other ways. And I actually trusted him!"
That did not help him, because the anger exploded inside him again and he wanted to tear himself away from Vision, but the Android did not let him. "Stay calm, breathe," he continued instead.
"I just organized a watch quickly," Burkwill chuckled, finally releasing Tony's back. He walked three steps back, while the mechanic heard something big coming up behind him. He turned just in time to avoid being caught in the back by giant claws stretched out by a tremendously big creature. Tony froze when he saw the alien in front of him. He felt again the pain in his stomach and chest, in his arms and in his head when he was almost torn to pieces by a bomb hundreds of yards in the air. It was exactly this alien that he had carried away. His eyes were wide and his brow furrowed so that he could barely hide his surprise and fear.
"What?" Steve exclaimed in disbelief. "All guns? That’s insane! The whole ship would explode and fall onto Tom's River. Thousands could die! We can’t do that!"
Ironically, it would end in the city where it started for him. His studies at MIT had revealed the way for his whole future, for his production of weapons and later Iron Man armor. Tony wondered if Burkwill had done it on purpose. He sighed. It would not change anything. They had to come up with a plan to get his comrades out of the hands of the psychopath, and he was already tired. He felt the exhaustion in every pore of his body, he felt the all-nighters and the lack of real food. And he felt the pressure.
Rhodey snorted and grinned at him. "As I know you, you would still break your second arm during the conference. No, you better stay here. Watch the conference on TV and if we're that bad, you'll do better next time. Today you stay here. And if you contradict I'll get that babysitter!"
Lopez touched her neck nervously and rubbed around there. "Well, so I only have this one copy. The photos have shaped me and changed my lifestyle very much. I honestly would like to know them near me. Or generally not with other people. I would suggest you take a picture, but I'm ... afraid. If those things came back with such a ship, they might be intelligent. I don’t want them to find me because I said something that I was not allowed to say." She grimaced and looked somewhat caught.
Steve swallowed, and he still didn’t answer, just saw Wanda straighten up and say something to Vision. He nodded.
"Because of the shadow lengths here," Fury continued, pointing to the screen with his hand, "we know that the people should be at about the same degree of longitude as we are."
Steve could see Rhodey approaching the monster. Suddenly it made an extremely fast movement in its direction and knocked it out of the trajectory. Rhodes would have ended up in the air if Falcon had not flown behind him and caught him.
Tony could hear the grin in the man's voice. He felt how he was slowly losing control of his emotions; how tears slowly crept into his eyes, which he quickly blinked away. He couldn’t have Pepper.
"There are more brains," Clint stated loudly, shooting simultaneously with arrows at the attacking smaller aliens. "The things are controlled by another one. Tony, Rhodey, can you see it?"
Tony's anxiety did not fade as the silence of the narrow elevator overcame him. His thoughts raced as he could concentrate on nothing and his hands began to tremble. His legs became weaker and he leaned against the mirrors. His face had turned pale and he felt himself getting worse. The ride in the elevator took him far too long before the doors finally opened. Quickly he stormed out of the narrow room, typed in the required passwords to enter the lab, and did not even close the frosted glass door as he stormed into the hall. Dum-E looked at him in surprise, but Tony said nothing. Trembling, he dragged himself to his chair in the middle of the room and dropped onto it. For a moment everything was quiet, then he slammed his hand against the table, which made it clank. He cried out loud.
Tony stopped and looked around. The stairs landed directly in a living room with three old beige and red sofas arranged around a small wooden table. An empty vase graced him, or at least tried.
. Wasn’t it somehow his fault? It all started with the Sokovia agreement that had to be signed. He acted the way he thought was best, he acted the right way, and the still thought so. But could he have allowed the team to split? He put his head in his hands.
At that moment Tony heard heavy footsteps running down the stairs. "You damned, fucking lucky man! You could damn well have died!"
He could not, not now. He knew he had promised to get more involved, but he could not. Not after such a secret was made public, and not when he was not sure how he would react to the others; if he had his emotions under control.
"He was brainwashed!" Steve intervened. Tony could clearly feel that his teammate was getting more restless. "You knew he killed people. But what you saw there wasn’t him! Not willingly."
For a moment it was quiet again as if Rhodey still hoped that Tony would react, but then he heard the clack of metal on wood and it was quiet around him.
He swallowed and stood up. He had to do something. Nobody should ever feel something like him back then.
"I don’t know. What time is it? Doesn’t matter,” he pulled his chair to the screw that Natasha had not even glanced at and picked it up.
“Dr Banner, Pepper tried to blackmail myself and the Avengers when she found out about Stark’s coma and subsequent death. She then tried to steal the Company and Stark’s personal fortune.
Steve bit down on Tony’s mating mark as he sprayed his cum all over Tony’s ass and back.  Tony jerked awake trying to escape the teeth and mouth biting and sucking on his neck but bands of steel held him tight as a still hard cock rutted against his ass crack.  His own cock started to show an interest in the proceedings, twitching and plumping up, reaching down he started to stroke it tugging on his balls startled by their smoothness until he remembered the shower the evening before.
“Yes Alpha, there is a vault at the old mansion that has all the research and notes of all the projects Howard worked on, if there is anything on Project Rebirth it will be stored within.
“Think yourself luck whore that I was not given permission to shave it all off or to permanently remove it as I wanted.
If at any time you become desperate and cannot wait, you must inform me, but I will only allow a certain amount of leeway at the beginning of this training.  If you are feeling ill you must come and inform me straight away and I will remove your plug and sound for the period of illness, but if you abuse this by pretending sickness you will be punished.”
He wakes from a deep sleep to see Steve gazing down at him, a satisfied smile on his face, his fingers glisten with slick.  He automatically spreads his legs, so his new pussy is on show, ready for his Alpha. He moans and writhes as he is cuffed to the bed, his pussy now dripping.  He watches the intense look on Steve’s face as he pushes his cock passed his tight pussy lips, Tony is not prepared at all for the agony that follows, the pain is indescribable as Steve rams his cock deep into his pussy, ripping through his virgin omega hymen, snarling as he repeatedly forces his cock deep into the tight heat.
“Come on Brutus, time to fuck her other sloppy hole, good boy, there we go now show your bitch who is in charge.”
“Pepper strip and clean yourself up at the back of the limo, then I want you to show Steve how your titties have grown, maybe he will let Tony suck on your nips, doc says that with a bit of oral stimulation your milk should come in early, especially as your having twins.”
In the morning there was dry cum on his drawers, when he was washing, he noticed the small bruises on his ass cheeks.  This happened two or three times a week, each act one that an alpha would perform on his omega, he hated that it felt so good, that his body responded, but it wasn’t real so there was no harm in getting off, and he certainly would never tell anyone.  He was an Alpha, and it just was not done that you enjoyed been used like an omega.
The red leather straps frame her crotch before winding round her thighs and down to her ankles, six- inch red heels complete her outfit.
Peter I am very disappointed in your behaviour tonight, it was a simple task that every properly bought up omega knows how to perform.  Still what can I expect when your aunt let you run wild and then you hid your orientation, I will have to inform Dr Banner that May will need to be punished for her failure to properly school you in the ways of an omega.
Bucky lost himself in fucking Stevie’s tight hole, the smell of blood and Stevie’s hoarse screams driving him to thrust deeper and harder. He could see the shape of his cock through Stevie’s thin frame, touch his hard length through the soft skin.
Steve appreciated how expertly Natasha had hog tied Pepper before she even realised and began to start struggling.  With his strength it was nothing to pick her up, watching her body and limbs bow as he carried her over to the smaller, round glass table. The baby oil coating the surface ensured that she could be spun round, her cunt and mouth available to all who gathered round to greet the new Beta Alpha of the Stark Industry Pack.  The camera under the table would stream live to all top- level employees, everyone would know it was Ms Potts being fucked, but those making use of her holes had all put on robes with cowls that ensured their faces could not be seen.
He was ashamed that it aroused him and he could feel his cock stiffening the more the air filled with the smell of sex, as the mock omegas were in turns fucked and disciplined but their buyers, passed around as though they were objects to be used and abused and not human beings.
Pepper winched as the cage constricted painfully around her cock the heavy sound,  inside it tugging it down to swing between her thighs, the metal ball peeping below the hem of her skirt.  The outline of the harness could be seen clearly under the sheer top that she had been made to wear, her newly pierced nipples pushing against the thin fabric.  She looked as though she was about to go clubbing, not to her final board meeting.
Startled out of his memories by the cries of the pups he realised that his time with his aunt was up and he needed to visit with Tony before he returned to his Alpha.  His aunt didn’t respond to his goodbye kiss which hurt, but he understood that this was one of her bad days, hopefully next time she would not be gagged, and they could talk.
“Winter it’s going to be a while before we can get all our agents in place and start weeding out Hydra.  The main players are too close to the President to get rid of them all at once without Hydra getting suspicious.  We can arrange an accident for the Secretary of Defense and get Ross out the way, General Carter will be an acceptable replacement and we know he is loyal to our mission.  With control of the military we can make use of them for Hydra assaults and free up our time to investigate the suspected civilian traitors in the Capitol.”
Tony babbled and pleaded with Steve as he tried to thrust into his Alpha’s mouth but with huge hands holding his hips still and the smallness of his cock it was easy for Alpha to continue toying with him, keeping him on the brink of orgasm.
Your mind and body is in overdrive, trying to fulfil the biological imperatives that keep an omega physically and mentally balanced.”
Steve bit down hard on Tony’s shoulder as he teased another orgasm out of his omega, his cock jumping at the pathetic, pained mewls coming from his omega.
Deft fingers ripped away the ruined panties tossing them towards the fire where they landed on the ornate poker sticking out of the burning coals. Tony gasp as three fingers breach his hole with ease, stroking his inner walls as they sought out his sweet spot, once found he was tortured to screaming point by the endless play of those same fingers brushing over and over against the raised bump of nerves.
Karl, feeding tubes on constant for the rest of the day for these two, need to fatten up our expectant cows.
There we go, just ride it out baby, I am going to fill you with my cum and them we can wait out my knot.”
“Hello Professor, how is he, has he woken yet?  It was incredibly fortuitous that you and Bruce managed the separation earlier this week, do you think you will be able to achieve it with Banner and the Hulk?”
Take a few minutes to think about it and ask any questions you may have, then you will need to give Dr Gottlieb and I your answer.”
“But Tony, you are smaller and weaker because of your own actions, you were the one who wrecked your body with drink and drugs, you went to an unlicensed clinic an took part in experimental treatment.
“That’s it, milk my knot, take my spend into your cunt, I want you to stink of me, to know that I can satisfy you just as much as your Alpha.  I hate that you are not my Tony, that you are alive when he may be dead, I hope for your sake that Natasha finds him soon.  Now that I have fucked you once I am not going to stop, you need it to ease your heat and you may be the closest I ever get to being with my omega.”
Tony by this time was sagging in his bonds exhausted by the shock and pain, he wanted the oblivion of unconsciousness but his Alpha pinched and twisted his nipples sucking on his mating mark jerking him back from the brink of darkness.
Pepper lay on the bed, exhausted her stomach roiling with all the cum she had swallowed.  He father had warned her that she would receive a caning if she dared show such disrespect by puking.
Less than a year ago she had been CEO of Stark Industries, powerful and dominant, now she was nothing more than the  Avengers whore, and Stark Industries sexual favour for visiting clients.  She craved Natasha’s attention and approval, would do anything for a smile or kind word from her. She had learnt the hard way to bend for Steve and to never answer back, she prayed that they would get his omega back so her punishment at his hands would end.
It only took a few minutes for the omega to drift off into a deep sleep, the vibration of the plug massaging his tender flesh.  Bruce fitted the feeding gag and set the pump on high for twenty minutes, whilst he waited he set up Petey’s desk, with it’s special chair and keyboard.
Steve wasted no time releasing his cock and plunging into the dark inviting hole burying himself to the hilt.  Tony s scream of pain and pleasure at the intrusion made his cock throb and lengthen even more, the slick filled channel gripping and sucking him deeper.
Sparring with Winter was immensely different to the rough and tumble of his workouts with Bucky, Winter calculated his every move before striking with lethal precision.  Steve was hard pressed to keep up at times, unable to determine any tells in his cold hard visage when he entered full Winter Soldier attack mode.
He tried the door, but it would not open, he tugged on the handle repeatedly tears of frustration and anger falling as he kicked and started to hit, the door with his fists.
“Shhh baby, you need to stay still, a fully trained traditional omega can lay perfectly still and quiet whilst their Alpha seeks his pleasure only making any kind of response when given permission, it is a true measure of your submission that you can sublimate your own sexual desire numerous times to  allow your Alpha the full pleasure and use of your body without any sexual release for yourself. It won’t be something I indulge in that often as I prefer a more active partner, but it is a requirement of your training.
In the end Steve gagged Tony and bound his arms and legs, just so he could get some sleep, it was unsettling how is baby boy had disappeared and he was faced with would seemed to be a foul mouthed teenager.  He knotted him though out the night, regardless if Tony was awake or sleeping, he loved the feel of Tony’s swollen, cum filled belly, how his small, soft body was dwarfed by his. Moving his hand, he toyed with the rings on Tony’s cock, tonight he had come so close to taking them off, angered beyond belief that the situation with Ty had occurred and that his baby boy had so blatantly disobeyed him at the Gala.
Tony’s moans vibrating along his cock causing him to harden again and pump more cum to the extent he could feel his omega starting to chock unable to swallow quick enough.  Pulling his cock out he shot the rest of his cum over his bitch’s tits, before picking him up and sitting him on the side.  Pinching the thick nipples, he watched as milk squirted out to mix with the cum dripping down the heavy tits.  Smearing the mixture together he rubbed it into Tony’s skin as his omega slumped back sated against the mirrored wall.
"We have to kill it!" he called. "I’ve got to get into the ship quickly. We are getting dangerously close to the city!"
At least he could feel it all, he thought grimly as the pain moved from his toe into his calf. He tried to move his aching legs, but they obeyed neither. He felt panic when he couldn’t move, and his breathing went even faster. The stinging pain ran through his chest again and a peal of pain left his mouth.
Hell, maybe there was a new attack and Tony was useless and couldn’t help. Then, of course, it would be clear why nobody was looking for him. There was either no time or no reason if he could not even save himself while so many pieces of his suit had lain beside him. He might not even be worth looking for. He had subsided, he was aware of that. Again a tear left his eye and his chest cramped as he sobbed.
Finally, he had found the pills and he quickly reached for the drops he had to take in the evening before he immediately ran out again. As he hurried out of his room, he almost collided with Clint, who was holding his suit over his arm and putting the coms in his ears with the other one. For a brief moment, both of them were in shock, but then Clint nodded to him.
Tony's eyes were on Steve, who was staring at the ground. Bucky leaned back in his chair, eyes darting to Steve, before examining his hands again. Neither said anything. Fury's face had become even harder.
"Please," Burkwill replied, gesturing to her. "Just realize that your friends will all die if you make any attempt to flee. Oh, right, Stark."
"Thanks," Steve murmured to himself. He had already supplanted the artificial intelligence. In any case, he had not missed the voice from nowhere in recent months. "On our way."
Steve stared quietly at Rhodey. The other man wore training clothes and a first aid kit as a backpack. He was sweaty and seemed to be tired.
"Clint, can you support them?" He shouted to the archer. He took a last look at Steve and Bucky, who were now crowding into the thick tree and fighting. Again and again, aliens fell and made getting through harder for the next ones, but not impossible. The shield and arm pierced the unprotected areas and killed the aliens, but by no means enough of them.
His mediators looked around restlessly. Burkwill knew he scared them. He knew each and every one of them, as well as he knew every other person in the world.
"I'll try to reach Lang and Wilson," Natasha said, sighing. "We have no contact to them since last night now. SHIELD is working on it, but I'll try it through other ways."
Steve even smelled the monsters. The stinging smell of rotten eggs was stiff in the air, even though it was so restless. Steve briefly climbed on two stacked creatures and could see over all the monsters to the entrance of the building. More and more monsters were streaming out of the grey huge door, all screaming like crazy.
"I had trained with a couple of agents. Friday said you haven’t eaten anything since yesterday's lunch?"
Although Steve was able to snap, throw and catch his makeshift metal shield from Wakanda almost as quickly as at the beginning of the fight, Clint's breath was already audible.
The other man had been with James for a long time. Peter Krum, that was the name of the forty-seven-year-old. He had accompanied James for twenty-one years. He had been one of the first to follow his call and join him. Together, the two men had to fulfil a mission that should soon reflect the work of the last two decades. For so long, James had been waiting for this day, for so long he wanted revenge.
Tony cried out loud. Sweat dripped from his forehead and had soaked his sleeping clothes, and his stomach cramped in pain. Breathless, he propped himself up and put his hands on his knees. He choked, but nothing left his mouth. Trembling, he wiped the tears from his eyes, which had crept in there in pain or fear.
He shook the thought of the man aside and climbed into the plane. It took less than five minutes and Steve was in the air and the Avengers' headquarters behind him.
Also, Ashton Baldwin Carter isn’t the Secretary of Defence anymore, but because this is set in 2016 I just used him. It’s James Norman Mattis now, just in case you are interested.
Steve could not do that to him now. That was exactly what Burkwill wanted to achieve. He could not leave him behind. Not after all this time. Not this way.
He didn’t want to wake the others; Natasha often woke up at the slightest sound and she would probably try to bring Tony back to bed again.
have vividly presented it." He paused to let the words work. Tony's chest rose quickly. Now they had the proof: The stranger had contact with the alien race and damn, Tony thought, they even had a name.
"I have my shield and my weapon," the man continued. "I want you, Stark, with me. Otherwise, this agent will experience exactly the same as my family had. You know what? I had two children and a wife. We were four. Here are five agents. Helmut, please."
"Why shouldn’t they discuss their issues?" Wanda interjected. Natasha looked at her for a moment, then spoke up. "Friday," she asked the AI, "are Rogers and Rhodes debating their problems?"
"I did never want to hurt you, Tony. I swear to god, I never did. I just made a big mistake and even if you don't believe me, I need to say that to you. I really, never wanted to hurt you."
Tony stared at the bridge, where still several aliens were positioned. Some of the little beasts had broken out and were now running toward the groups of agents and Avengers with a helicopter circling overhead. "Is Fury working on them?" He shouted into the microphone.
For a very brief moment, he stared at the cell phone, secretly hoping that it would suddenly light up and Steve was at the other end of the line.
"This is where Abbie Lopez was," Steve said, pointing to a point just a few miles west of the indicated location. Tony nodded. "So, we have the origin of the critters, now all we have to do is find Wilson, Lang and the other agents. Friday," he told the AI, "would you be so kind and look for possible running routes in the area? It looks very hilly. In a storm and with injured people you don’t get anywhere that fast."
Rhodey's voice sounded through the intercom, still weak, but at least he was conscious again. "I'm behind our lines and talking to the Army Commander. He wants us to direct all guns to the creature."
Big and stubborn were the green-brown aliens. Her skin was made of such a solid material that it couldn’t be smashed in many places. Some monsters had horns growing out of their heads or shoulders that were sharp and dangerous.  They made roaring noises when injured or when they attacked, and it was incredibly loud on the ship. Hundreds of these creatures were running around on the deck and it seemed to be getting more and more.
So, now we are getting somewhere. I hope you all enjoyed this chapter. I had a lot of fun writing this. This James guy is lovely to write.
"I don’t know, boss. It seems that the suit is magnetically tied to the bridge. I can’t control it."
I hope you all survived Thanksgiving. We don't celebrate it here but I heard it's a lot of stress. So, I hope you all are still here with us.
Although Kima could pronounce the strange race’s name perfectly, he apparently did not know anything about them.
"He doesn’t want to give us time to plan well," Steve concluded suddenly. "He knows that we won’t let Tony go alone, so he still wants to confuse us. He wants us to have no chance to get around him."
Someone knocked on his door, tearing him out of his slow thoughts that he was startled. He got up cautiously, even had to stop for a moment to get his circulation going again before he opened the door and went into the living room. Quickly he straightened up again and, as the last, entered the full but comfortable room. With folded arms, he leaned against the wall.
Tony could not stop rolling his eyes when he realized the gravity of the situation. Rhodey did not seem to understand him yet.
Steve had preferred Bucky to him, had gone away and was now being searched. Tony had tried to arrange things so that they could be acquitted again, but Steve would not sign the deal. He was sure.
"It was a river. The tracks stopped at this river. I searched for a long time. There was a ford, I ran over, through the icy water to find the tracks on the other side, but they were just gone. As if those things had been swallowed up by the earth. There's a photo of the footprints that go into the water."
Steve cast a sidelong glance at Tony, who tried to control himself. His jaw was pressed together as he listened to the newcomer. "An agent found ammo under a fallen tree right in front of the cave entrance. It looks like SHIELD ammo."
Tony could not remember the next few minutes. When he was finally able to think straight again, he was still in the same place, only this time firmly pressed to Steve. His head had dug protectively into the other's chest, which kept jumping up and down as if suppressing a sob. And though he could not figure out how it happened, he knew he needed Steve right now. The tremor had eventually subsided, and his breathing was back to normal.
Fury annoyingly twisted his eye. "To not endanger the further action. Information must be kept secret."
The danger, the serious danger was clearly visible and everyone in the room knew it. No one moved for several minutes, then suddenly Steve heard someone straighten up. He looked up.
He turned back to his tools, hoping that Natasha would leave him alone, having only tried to do some small talk. A stupid idea, she was not like that at all. She would not sneak into his workshop just to ask how he was.
"Too much, probably," Tony answered truthfully. "Did you know that Laura Barton's cake looks like it's priced?"
It felt like the leg splint didn’t fall off as hoped but got spilt. Something stuck in his calves and for a brief moment, Tony was even glad that he could not move his legs because that would have made everything worse. He wrinkled his brow and tried to see his surroundings better. His upper body was exposed to the sun unrestrained, which was in the exact position to shine into the cave. In some places, he already felt sunburn. Whether he was sweating because of the pain or the heat, he couldn’t say. He groaned briefly. His suit had apparently dropped off in the air, which had not gone as planned either. All over the area were cables and metal plates distributed.
Clint, too, seemed to have regained some courage. Steve guessed that he didn’t want to die as a coward but as a hero.
"I should be there," Tony contradicted. "I can sit. And I don’t slow down with healing when I'm in front of cameras."
It didn’t happen this way, and now, because of his naivety, he had endangered all of them again. If Wilson and Khatib found the signal and if the Avengers in the old house received it - if that happened and if they helped, then Pepper, Lang and Dragenbach would still be in huge danger. "I'm sorry," Tony whispered again.
"If I can remember something more, I'll get in touch. But please, don’t show my name anywhere. And please," she added before closing the door, "find these monsters and make them disappear."
"Yeah," Tony muttered, slipping into the surprisingly comfortable shoes. He wondered if he should write a note, but then shook his head. The others would understand him, maybe not now, but soon. Carefully, Tony sat down on the window frame and suddenly felt reminded of his childhood. He used to break out of his parents' house on a regular basis, but today it was a different story. Slowly he let his shoe slide down and searched in the dark for a notch in the wall. It took time, but then he found a wooden beam sticking out of the stone. Slowly his other foot could follow and he would have fallen off almost instantaneously if he had not held onto the wooden frame of the window with his hands. He flinched when a cat munched beneath him but calmed down again.
Rhodey took a deep breath. "And yet he is here again. He was the first one to go down here, he was the first of all the others to find you when you were gone, he was the first one to - "
Natasha took a breath and did a dramatic pause. "We thank the United Nations and the United States of America for this opportunity. We will use this privilege and save the world from further disaster as best we can."
"It’s a decision by the government, which probably serves for security. You can be glad you're fucking here, Rogers. The situation was much tenser a few hours ago."
Without being able to influence it, Tony turned around and stared at the empty space on the wardrobe. He sighed.
"Yes," interrupted the mechanic. "Now you’ve got your answer, so hurry up. I don’t have much time. You know, there are aliens out there who just wanted to attack a metropolis. I'm kind of busy."
"Shit," Steve said now, and again Tony turned to face him. "Did you send help?" he asked Clint, who was still on the line.
He pulled the door a little further and allowed Steve to step ahead, stepping into the small entryway. He closed the door behind him and looked around. The narrow corridor had light wood on the floor, as well as the same white wood panelling on the walls, up to a meter high. Above it, the wall had been painted in an unpleasant shade of yellow, which might have looked well twenty years ago, but with a few grey and black spots, it simply showed the age of the apartment.
Some old, rotten wood divided the wall in the middle and probably once looked good a few decades ago, but now it only showed that the house urgently needed a refurbishment.
It was his fault. It was all his fault and Tony knew it. He had created Vision, he had created the bombs and shells, and he had controlled too little.
The Figure wondered if Stark had even remotely thought of lying here himself and wearing such shirts.
fell dead as the brain died. Suddenly they began to fight their way out of the water, with a power and speed that was unimaginable before. Several of the creatures ran straight for Steve and Bucky, barely a dozen yards from the bridge, completely delivered to the monsters.
Tony put his head back briefly. Pepper meant it really well, but she seemed to think the Avengers business would not be a permanent job, even if she knew it from personal experience.
"Oh, right, Friday," the man whispered in a deep voice. "I put her to sleep briefly. Nobody should be aware of this information here. Even though it's not much, I have to admit."
Rhodey’s weapon variety caused several creatures to perish in front of him, but consequently more and more monsters came out again and made their way to the crowded deck.
"No, just promise that you'll be more into it. And Tony," he added, "promise you won’t go looking for the psychopath alone. Please."
"And one more thing," Bucky Barnes said before Tony could hang up. “SHIELD will have a crisis meeting tomorrow with all the present Avengers and agents. Results should be exchanged, and the further acting discussed. Tomorrow, at five, all of us are expected in Stark's meeting room. And Steve,” he added, “you are being asked to stay in the quarters, again."
Tony nodded. "Know that place. Haven’t been there for a long time, but it wouldn’t have changed much. What do you know about the woman?"
Tony looked at him challengingly. "Okay, there's a dead body already”, Rhodey admitted. “But you aren’t going there today. Tomorrow is the earliest date on which I allow you to get out of here. And just if you can move properly."
"We’ll have to split up," Clint began to tell. Tony noticed that there was a laptop on the small table showing Fury and some key agents and employees of SHIELD who were listening in on live. "At least for working. We have no further clue where to go. But we can’t search the whole city, so in small groups, we will examine the buildings and places that seem most realistic."
It was quiet for a moment. "So, we are not one step nearer to Sam and Scott?" Steve tried to stop the silence.
"Also", Clint added, "we have to find a bigger thing. The brain. If we kill it, we can kill everyone with it."
Only then did Tony realize that tears had once again left his eyes and he turned to Steve. Strong arms embraced him and pulled him as close to the soldier as possible.
"Would you like something to drink?", She pointed to the table next to Tony and the four glasses that stood on it. Next to it a bottle of cheap wine. Tony wondered who was drinking something like this out of normal glasses, but nodded anyway and poured himself and the woman something. Steve and Natasha did not want anything.
At first, it sounded like a noise and Tony wanted to tell Friday that she should undo the last change immediately, but then a window opened on Tony's desktop and showed a black image. Startled, he breathed.
He could not do anything about it but just watched as the alien ran toward him. Vision came closer to the tank with every second. Tony's mouth opened a bit as he tried to stop his former colleague. He knew he had to do something, this was not Visions fight.
He typed it in and limped into the anteroom, accessible to most agents and Avengers. The transparent glass gave a good view of the untidy workshop. But Tony's eyes stopped in front of the second security door. The alien lay there, dead and ugly, dumped by people who obviously didn’t think too much about how to shift the alien gently. Tony rolled his eyes when he saw that the thick body lay on top of one arm so that it was certainly damaged.
