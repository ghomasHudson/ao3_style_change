In one of the bridge Killian punches Cap and sends him to the other side “I was so close to making her perfect! But you and your little friends had to ruin everything!” he practically yells while walking to him
“Still in one piece apparently” she breaths harshly “Gotta check the suit though” Steve nods, flinching when seeing the damage to it
“Free country” the mechanic takes that as a positive answers and sits down in front of her “All right, where would you like to start?”
“That’s all you got?” the woman breaths heavily, Tasha disconnects the gas and it hisses as it gets out “A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?” Stark smirks
(special shout-out to ameve2 (I don't know how to tag sorry :c) for commenting every chapter! thank you I love you too much! <3
“I’m so going to make spangles sue you for stealing his colors I swear” she mutters under her breath, Rhodey has to make the inhuman effort of not laughing again
“I gave a speech? How was it?” her words are slurred by all the alcohol she had in the last three hours
On the other side of the ship, Rhodey and Nat are shooting soldiers while trying to save the president, they are surrounded because no matter how many times they shoot the EXTREMIS military, the bullets holes heal immediately
“Yeah yeah, tell me something new alright? birdbrain says that every week” she takes a sip of her beer
Steve's heart is beating a mile per hour, she looks beautiful and he feels so lucky to be able to stand so close to her like this "Oh I just thought that I wanted a dance with my best friend before the new year begins, besides, you looked like you needed to get out of there" Tasha laughs delightedly, they spent so much time together he learned how to read her
“I can’t help you, you know? You used to have a moral psychology, you used to have ideals, you wanted to help people and now look at you. You sold yourself. You are making people walking bombs... I mean... what happened to you, Maya?” Tasha shakes her head, she knows what is like to afront the reality of your creations, to see first hand the impact and damage one can cause without even noticing it, she doesn’t want anyone to be like that, she doesn’t want anyone to walk the same path as her “Common, lets make things right, get me out of here” Tasha thinks Maya’s about to reason when a male voice sound at the entrance
"I told you before birdbrain!, I want to remodel the Tower and give it to you guys!" the young millionaire grins at the remaining Avengers "Just in case you need a place to live" she adds shyly
Tasha smiles inside Roger's arms and hugs him back, she also was really worried about him "Anything for you Spangles, anything for you"
But Tasha can’t hear it, she just can’t, she is worried and she can’t sit and let down another member of her little and strange family, so she goes out of the room, feeling Steve’s eyes burning her back, so what if she lets him down too? She can’t do it, she can’t play hero when Coulson is potentially dying and Bruce is somewhere in the middle of the fucking United States. Pepper would be mad, and Rhodey as well, because she did something reckless and she is hurt, her entire body hurts. And what can she do anyway? Go alone to punch Loki? No. She’ll just end like Phil. God, he is an idiot, why did he have to take on Loki alone? Why couldn’t he wait for reinforcements? Tasha swears to any god (including Thor) that if Coulson dies, she is going to find the way to revive him just to kill him herself.
“Miss, we will loose power before you cut through that shell” JARVIS voice informs her, she takes a second to mentally apologize Rhodey for making him loose the bet with Pepper about how much time would it take for her to do something incredibly dumb again and flies up ahead, facing the oncomming monster
“That’s two” Tasha claims, her smile erases quickly seeing how it explodes inside the house, she falls helmet first in the floor and grunts, the floor vanish beneath her and she falls to her workshop level, she sees in horror how everything she owns falls to the sea, another two missiles impact the house, destroying it completely. She holds herself grabbing a column, but it’s useless because she is falling. She splashes into the water, with tons of debris collapsing on top of her. A loose cable traps her and drags her to the bottom, she is trapped, and she is drowning, fricking again, she gasps and pants, unsure of what to do, finally she gets herself free from the cable, only to be trapped again by rocks and cement
“Hey! Come here often?” he asks to Tasha in a mocking way, he steps on top of her, her armor grunts in protest “No, no, no, don’t get up sweetheart” he turns the heat up on one of his fingers and touches her chest plate “Is it me or is getting hot in here?”
She takes Harley back home, is the least she can do after she dragged him into that mess. Tasha parks in front of his warehouse, she gets out and opens the door for the kid
“We are, the model’s locked and we’re sweeping for the signature now, when we get a hit, we’ll have the location within half a mile” Bruce interjects
“Yeah, I'll take that as he's not here yet, keep me posted 'kay?. JARVIS, find me a soft post” she quietly flies behind and parallels with the Chitauri Leviathan
“I’m in a control room, I can see Steve from here, he looks weak, but at least he is awake, you are closer to him, I’ll try to see what can I do to block Killian’s transmission” Tasha makes an affirmative hum
“We will have to do further analysis about it” Bruce says as he approaches the group, recently un-hulked
“Oh... but Shawarma date after?” she asks tentatively, Steve faintly blushes at the word date and Tasha together but he just smiles and nods
“He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?, That’s what he wants, he wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it... he wants an audience” she looks at him intently, her brain looking for the missing part of the mistery, Steve furrows his brow in concentration
But there’s no time for reunion since Killian comes back and tackles her, she lands on her back and uses the leverage to kick him to the other side with the help of her thrusters but he drags her, JARVIS capture the signature from Killian’s EXTREMIS and proceeds to shoot, but before that can happen Steve destroys the armor, one of the parts lands next to Tasha and she takes it before using one method Clint and Nat showed her to subdue an enemy, She throws Killian off her along with the device and shoots it, making an amazing explosion.
“Why the hell should I take orders from you?” the police sergeant snaps, but before Steve can say anything, an explosion comes behind him, the energy blast being blocked by his shield, then, two Chitauri soldiers attack and he fights them off with ease, he can hears the same sergeant say to the other officer “I need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets, I need a perimeter as far back as 39
2 hours after, Sitwell finds the heroes in a little-destroyed Shawarma joint, eating but all in various degrees of shock and stress, the most obvious is Tasha, who hasn’t even touch her food, Steve's looking at her with concern written on his face, but she doesn’t notice as she's staring at some point on the wall, all the implications that she died, again, coming up to meet her. Oh her new trauma was going to be so fun, new nightmares, that’s for sure, she was actually getting tired of the ones with Afganistan, and Obie and Palladium, sure she still has some with dear old Howard, but those are ancient history, the space invasion is the new black after all. Steve, of course, can’t know about those thoughts, he can only see the blank stare in the young woman’s face, as he is watching her intently resting his head on his fist. Tasha is taken out of her dazed state by a french fry that Nat throws at her, Stark looks at her a little dizzy but starts eating. Steve keeps looking at the genius, trying to comb with the fact that someone so young had actually and actively risk her life to save all of them.
It's really easy to bond with a person in a really short period of time, so I didn't exactly exaggerate their friendship just to get away with the time frame... at least not too much :v
Tasha has been driving on the highway for more than an hour when she starts reading the file, she tosses it downwards feeling the weight on her shoulders, she has to stop them, she has to avenge Happy and to stop more people from being in that same situation, she sighs and when she looks at the papers again is when it clicks... the marker letters don’t spell MIA, it spells AIM as in the same company that remodel the Iron Patriot suit.... how could she missed that? She takes her phone and calls Rhodey
“You are missing the point” Tasha walks out of her bar “There’s no throne, no version of this where you come out on top. So maybe your army comes and maybe it’s too much for us, but it’s all on you... Because if we can’t protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we’ll avenge it” Loki slowly walks up to her raising the scepter
“Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube, I was hoping you might join him” if Tasha’s face could reflect any more happiness at the thought of working with a scientist she deeply respects, she would have blind everyone in the room.
"Sweetheart, I was going to sleep there anyway" Tasha shoves him making him yelp, Nat only laughs quietly as they walk to their respective cars. Bruce is waiting next to a sports car with a nervous smile on his features, the genius dumps both spies and runs to him, she tilts her head to the right side and looks at him expectantly
“Oh honey... trust me, I will after he had given us what we want, then, we will leave his corpse alone, and you know what? We haven’t even talked about salary yet, say... what kind of perk package are you thinking of?” Aldrich takes out an orange syringe and puts it on Tasha’s neck, she looks at him defiantly “Now... while we wait... how about we test the last updated version of EXTREMIS?” he is about to inject her, she can feel the point of the needle pushing her neck when Maya intervenes
“Yeah... the bad news is that I missed the president... and the good news is that Nat and Clint blow the airplane up”
“I’ve got him” Clint’s voice is dripping venom so she knows that he’s looking at Loki, seconds later she hears another boom nearby and a manical grin appears in her helmet covered face thinking about the explosive arrows she gave him in their last meeting.
"Lucky me I have my knight in shiny tuxedo to save me" she jokes and Steve smiles. They swing with the music, Steve never danced before, he wanted to have one with Peggy but destiny tore them apart before that much could happen, so, while everyone was extremely busy with the Mandarin's clean up, he had taken the chance to go to ballroom classes... or at least he would have if Nat hadn't stopped him '
Also, I uploaded a prequel for Not a kid, if you guys are interested and I’ll continue this fic as soon as I finish writing chapter 10 :D
“Hey I experience the downside of mass destruction first-handed, I have the right to say whatever fuck I want” she protests at the same time that Steve’s defends her
"Yeah well... there's a reason I hate coming to these things, but she already has given us so much..." Steve nods, he knows that Bruce doesn't only refers to the material things, Tasha gave them a home "Anyway, I'm going to my floor, I have to pack to leave tomorrow early"
“Uh, it’s not charging” as a reflect Tasha hits the breaks and the car screechs and turns to the side stopping completely, she breaths heavily, if her suit it’s not ready... if her suit is not ready... how is she going to fucking fight if her suit isn’t working?!
"Oh I know about a certain tech genius that could use some help to run away from some troublesome patrons" Nat adds meaningfully, the interest sparkle on Rogers' eyes doesn't escape her attention
“Yeah? And when was the last time you got a good night’s sleep? Huh? When you got one of those” Tasha tches and pouts
“How is it that you believed her to be legal? She barely even looks legal now and she’s 23!!” Steve sounds completely outraged
“Yeah, Aldrich Killian” Steve thinks about why the name sounds familiar, he believes he heard it when Tasha was talking with Pepper, still, he has to get Coulson to run ID’s, for now, he focuses on getting to the hotel, on one piece preferably
“So why didn’t SHIELD bring her in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?”
“So what are you waiting for? Ask him on a date, show him how the new century girls take the initiative” he jabs
Don't let the open end fool you, there's going to be an epilogue with fluff and more friendship-almost something else- stony :v
“This ain’t your fight Stark, and it’s far too dangerous... what did Loki do to you that you want to stop him so badly?” Clint looks deep into her eyes and she has to avert them after a while
“How do you even know that? No, you know what? Let me tell you something, Do you know what happened when you tell people that you are a bodyguard of the same person Iron Man bodyguards? They laugh in my face” Tasha chuckles “I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity”
“I... I broke the crayon” she whispers, feeling as the tremors become stronger, a vague sense of nausea fills her, making her feel light-headed. she has the sensation that her body paralyzes for a second, at the next she has the intense instinct to run away
“No, it’s alright, I wouldn’t have come aboard if I couldn’t handle pointy little things” he says while looking at Tasha, her smile doesn’t disappear completely but it dims
“It’s just... Sunday nights. PBS. Downton Abbey” she looks at the unconscious man in the bed, it breaks her heart seeing her dear friend that has been taking care of her since she was 15 like that “That’s his show, he thinks it’s elegant” she makes a pause, before turning to see Happy’s nurse “One more thing, make sure everyone wears their badges, he’s a stickler for that sort of thing... plus my guys won’t let anyone in without them” she gets out of the room and looks the horde of reporters outside the main entrance, she really doesn’t want to deal with them right now, being as upset as she is, there's almost a 90% chance she is going to do something stupid. She can even hear them all the way inside the hospital's lobby
“Because of him” Fury points at Thor (like a kid acusing another to the teacher), who actually looks surprised and puzzled
“Well, thanks, but you were right on something though, I’m no hero, not yet, I still have a long way to go to be like aunt Peggy” her voice's barely a whisper, her eyes focused on the ceiling
. Tasha can see as some type of serum is being injected on the subjects and they begin to glow, the camera focus on the redhead and then the impossible.... a limb regrows from her cutted arm, but then the camera turns to another subject, Killian order everyone to go and take the rest with them, the man glows and shines and finally... explodes
“I must be lookin’ real low if a kid's trying to comfort me” he jabs, but his tone is fond and grateful, she sticks her tongue at him
“And he is not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us” Tasha seems to consider it for a second
The elevator stops and the people start to go down, all the other women get out and Tasha stays a little behind to talk to the awkward guy
“True story about fortune cookies: they look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they’re actually an American invention, which is why they’re hollow, full of lies, and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knockoff. The Chinese theatre. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close, and don’t worry, the big one is coming, your graduation”.
“Listen, the Pentagon is scared, after New York, aliens... Come on.” just hearing the words sends a shiver down her spine, she can feel her palms starting to sweat and little tremors all over her body, which is ridiculous by the way, she survived kidnapping, a shrapnel, poisoning, betrayal, she is not going to get nervous just because Rhodey mentions some aliens that she destroyed. Except that she does “They need to look strong, stopping the Mandarin is a priority, but it’s not...”
“Oh-oh” the alarm increases in intensity “Oh no no no no no...” Tasha starts screaming as she sees how close is to crash with a car in the highway, she bumps in the pavement a few times and hit some trees until she finally stops in the middle of something white, soft and cold “It’s snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?”
“That figures, what I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of almost a 100 out of a privately funded think tank, but sure, you can call me a botanist”
To say that Steve Rogers is amazed by the little Stark kid would be an understatement; sure he knew that Howard Stark had a daughter, but he didn’t expect her to be a genius or Iron man, or you know... too young to be both. She claimed that she was 20, but she looks younger, way younger. Her face still holds child-like features, her hair is long and wavy, currently arranged in a messy but cute ponytail, also, she's tiny, like, 'barely reaching Steve’s chin' tiny.
thank you for following the series, I have to think if I'm going to write the other movies (TWS, AoU, CW >:v, etc etc) I would love to read your thoughts about it ^^
“Well. One of the bad guys was inside” she shrugs as if she didn’t just destroyed millions of dollars invested in the President’s Air Force
“I call dibs on telling Thor how he missed the party” Clints adds excited, both women just rolls their eyes
“Of course not, I, unlike others, have perfect taste, thank you very much” Rhodey chuckles and Tasha smiles “But I’m gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now and I need your login”
“You are everything else but old kid, now stop trying to bed a national icon before you make me puke” of course Clint had to decide to be an ass, so what if she did want to bed him? ‘
“Well... It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-sustaining energy source, that building will run itself for what? A year?” Tasha beams at them again
“Yeah? Who might that be? I mean, I know I invited the Mandarin earlier but I didn’t expect him to come so soon” Steve scowls at that, Tasha’s actions were completely stupid and irresponsible
“I gotta an idea... hold on tight” is all Rhodey’s warning before shooting at the cable that kept the container steady
"Ah... Captain Rogers, fancy seeing you in a party like this" one of the men talks to him, but he takes little notice as he can see Tasha's eyes grow wide and twinkles in appreciation
“Language Cap!” Tasha laughs, more from relief than actual fun, she extends her hand to him “Take my hand Spangles, lets get out of here” Steve wiggles from underneath the debris and almost touches her when an orange hand comes from under a rock and grabs Tasha’s mechanical arm, she hisses as it burns her, the hand throws her, the floor melts and Killian climbs up
Steve gets thrown across the room and ends trapped below a pile of debris, well, at least the tubes are no longer connected to his body... and whatever the scientist injected him with apparently make the serum stronger, because the wounds don’t take longer in start closing, not immediately but is a shorter amount of time than he is used to, he takes deep breaths before trying to take the metal off him
“I want to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative” the SHIELD director went to her one night after JARVIS allowed him access to the Malibu house and proceeded to explain
“Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem” at the sight of the girl’s eyes, Bruce looks away, he doesn’t know the full potential of that particular weapon, but he isn’t about to discover it
“You know... I uh... just want to finish my work here and...” Banner whispers trying to look anywhere else
“So what your dreams are about?” she looks at Bruce apollogetically, she doesn’t like spilling the contents of her subconcious, not sober at least, especially when most of her nightmares diverges to Howard at some point. And she’s definetely not telling her new family about the extent of dear old dad abuse, bad enough was that Rhodney knew, she was always careful with that information, hell not even Aunt Peggy, Aunt Angie nor the Hollowing uncles knew about it, that was how good the Stark family was at hiding their dirt. She sends a pointed ‘
“Not a great plan, mind you. When the others come, and they will, then we’ll come for you” she finishes the rest of her drink and pulls her brand new bracelets
“Perhaps another time?” the man named Yinsen tries to call her but to no avail, the teenager is too drunk to recognize any good opportunities with fellow scientists
“Who’s that?” Clint asks, they were out for a mission for the last few months so is not a surprise they aren’t updated
“Yeah, you know what? That’s actually a good idea, I’ll probably build one..,” she gets close to the kid and sits in front of him as she pokes his nose, she won’t admit it but he's quite adorable “So... who’s home?”
“Hey... I might not know a lot about science but I know that you can’t be too hard on yourself, for your intel, you gave your research to a think tank...”
“As I said, I can’t help you wooing Pepper, but I can ask her to come to dinner and I’ll talk to her about all your redeeming qualities, how about that?” she offers
Inside, Natasha falls and rolls to the window once more, she grabs an iron support just in time as her feet hit the window, shattering it, she pushes herself up and rests against it
“Nope” she exclaims in pain as she injects herself “Forty-eight” she shakes her arm “Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete”
“What does it power?” Tasha turns the light on and moves aside to let the kid see her armor sitting, the USK gaps in awe “Oh my god.... that’s... is that... Iron Man?... Is Iron Man here?” the words leaves her before she can control them
"Is just... I don’t trust this guy, see? He’s got another guy with him, and he’s shifty” Tasha rolls her eyes
“Huh... probably I’m too good for you, also, performance issues you know? It’s completely normal for amateur...” Angry, Loki grabs Tasha by the neck and flings her across the room and, wow that hurts “JARVIS? Anytime now if you please” her voice is strained after the hit, the god goes to her and grabs her by the throat again
“What’s that thing on your chest?” oh yeah, she forgot that the general public doesn’t know about her arc reactor, of course, nobody would know about it since nobody knows she is Iron Man
“I was wrong director, the world hasn’t changed a bit” Steve says solemn, making Tasha feel slightly bad for him, the guy fought and sacrificed a lot for the country... a country that apparently didn't learn from their past mistakes
“She’s not slowing down!” Thor starts swinging Mjölnir to get her when the Hulk snags Iron man out of the air, both of them crash and slide down a building, he then throws her off him. Steve and Thor run over to her, the Norse god ripping her helmet off. Her eyes are closed and she looks so still and pale that Steve starts to think the worst
“That’s cruel and manipulative kid, I don’t want to talk about it” she deadpans, sensing a horrible and dread feeling crawling in her back and in her arms and a wave of nausea surrounding her “Remember that I told you that I have an anxiety issue?”
. They soon arrive at a little sort of outside sanctuary, Tasha looks around “So... what’s the official story here?”
“There’s only one God ma’am. And I’m pretty sure he doesn’t dress like that” he says before jumping from the jet.
“Don’t worry, I got a ride, I could use a lift though” she doesn’t have the slightest idea of what the spy is talking about
“Hold on sweetheart” Tasha glares at him they both turn to see the scientist who has a weapon to her neck “Maya...”
By the time Rhodey, Tasha, Nat, and Clint arrive, Coulson has all the guards contained plus an almost drunk, and most likely drugged, Trevor ‘The Mandarin’ in custody. As soon as everyone is there, the interrogation begins
“What... what do you want with her?” he slurs, his head is spinning, he doesn’t know how long he has been there “She... she won’t help you”
“Oh thank god” Steve breaths, he smiles, relief purring from every pore, relief that is cut pretty quickly when he sees that she is not flying.... she is falling, and falling and still falling down to an imminent death, he trembles, the memory of Bucky fresh enough to terrify him
“It’s totally fine Miss, I seen to do quite well for a stretch and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry” Tasha chuckles “And Miss, you were right, once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin’s broadcast signal”
Steve runs as fast as he can and he makes an impressive jump from one side of the bridge to the center of the ship, he climbs to the platform just in time when the cargo stops, barely a few meters away, the platform creaks but Steve pays no mind to it, he climbs to the rail, Tasha streches as much as she can
“Hey, it's not a big deal okay? Obediah gave me consent... once, and I never did anything I didn’t want to, see? Nothing illegal at all”
“I... I’m sorry Steve” she sobs, the 40’s soldier decides to be a gentleman and not ask her any further, he just stays there, hugging the girl that had become his best friend in this century and humming an old lullaby, at least until JARVIS speaks and changes everything
“Why?” she asks barely suppressing the chills “JARVIS. Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away from home! I gotta get Steve, I gotta tell him that I’m fine, I gotta...”
“You know what? You should take more of an interest in what’s going on here, she is your best friend and the best thing that ever happened to us and you're just ignoring her”
"Rogers!" Nat's voice grounds him "Listen to me, this is important! Is the arc reactor glowing?" she asks in a demanding and urgent tone
“A while? Tasha, it has been 2 years since the battle of New York!” she exclaims and the inventor has to avert her gaze
“Come on Happy, relax, just secure the perimeter, tell them to go out for a drink or something and trust her good sense”
It’s in that moment when the device goes off and the Tesseract energy beams into the sky, forming a dark vortex that opens up letting the Chitauri army to spill out in flying chariots, carrying energy rifles with bayonets on the end
Iron man flies next to one of the Chitauri Leviathan and aims her lasser booster at it, it doesn’t even leave a scrach.
“What are we waiting for kids? Let's kick some butts” she says while extending her arms in a Tasha dramatic way™ “Take them to church” the armors start fighting in all the ways they were designed to do. Clint uses explosive arrows, Nat shoots a bazooka she got out of who knows where and the Hulk... the Hulk smashes and throws EXTREMIS soldiers to the sea. At some point, one of the pillars holding the platform they are in is destroyed and Tasha calls JARVIS to send one of her armors to stabilize it
“I don’t like it” Steve whispers close to the helmet breaking her focus, Tasha suppress a surprised yelp
“I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed” he looks at the Black Widow and confronts her "Did you know about this?
"I...." Bruce breaths and starts again "I was promised a tour in Candyland?" Tasha grins and beams and looks the happiest that Steve has seen her since he met her a few days back
“Oh I’m no hero” she says chuckling “not yet anyway” Bruce sends her a curious glance but keeps working
“What can I say? I’m a piping hot mess okay?” Pep looks at her barely containing her worry causing the genius to sigh “It’s been going on for a while, I admit that”
“Well, uncomplicate it! Ladies, out of the bed and into the bathroom, come on” both women do as told by the young and armed CEO, at the vision of the man trying to escape, she makes a warning gunshot to the floor, the man stands and she looks at him expectantly “Well?”
“You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favorite of many sayings... the early bird gets the worm... but the second mouse gets the cheese” he gets close to her and lightly caress her cheek with the back of his finger, Tasha subtly moves her head out of the way
“Focus up ladies” she turns to her dear armors “Good evening and welcome to the birthing suite, I am pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass baby brother” she turns to Butterfingers that’s recording everything “Start tight and then go wide, stamp date and time” she whispers without noticing the newcomer watching her behind the reinforcement glass “MARK XLII. Autonomus prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence” everybody prepares itselves as she stands in the center, the man looking at her tenses in expectation “JARVIS... drop my needle if you please” she signals and starts a little dancing as christmas-like music sounds
If there's one thing everyone should know about Natasha Stark... is that she always raises from the fire...
It's a chapter dedicated to Tony's friendship with Clint and Nat (the prompt that I miss the most since Civil War came into existence, even if I haven't actually seen the movie)
Steve Rogers, the super soldier from the 40's, Captain America, has been beating a punching bag since two hours ago when the nightmares started to be too much to endure. Each swing is like a memory trying to be repressed until he tears the bag open.
“Right, yet, I have that on my head now” she puts her face on her knees and tries to breath, her thoughts revolve on the same thing ‘
“What the hell was that?” Harley asks finally catching up with her, she throws at him a little snowball
“So... let’s see each other again... in better circumstances shall we?” Tasha says to Thor as he takes Loki with special cuffs complete with a mouth-piece, she thinks for a beat and speaks again "You know what? scratch that, you are always welcome in the Tower, Point break, come whenever you want, I'll have your floor ready" she smiles already making plans and blueprints in her head. Steve eyes her curiously
“Guys... please stay focus” is all Steve adds noticing the increasing amount of bantering in the middle of the battle. He heads to a couple of police officers and jumps in the car front of them “I need men in these buildings, there are people inside that can run into the line of fire, you take them through the basement or through the subway. You keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39
Steve can’t take his eyes off from the point where Tasha vanished, is full of flames and even though his rational part screams at him, his entire being refuses to believe it. There is no way Natasha Stark could’ve survive this
“It’s not” she concedes “But it’s a fact, JARVIS, why are we still at ding-dong? we are supposed to be on total security lockdown, come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?”
“Who is this child and what is she doing in such a serious and dangerous situation as this?” Thor asks looking also amazed but confused, Nat takes the trouble to explain
' and when he tried to suggest he could just put his military suit on, the genius had look at him in a way that made Steve fear for his life. His hair is brushed to the side and a brand new set of cufflinks shine on his shirt (tiny versions of his shield that Tasha gave him as a late Christmas present). Nat gives a look of appreciation, Captain America blends into the crowd very well, she'll have to congratulate Tasha for that later, not only she did a great job planning the party, but the Avenger's outfits as well
“It’s just a role, ‘The Mandarin’ you see? It’s not real, I’m here because I had a little problem with, um, substances, and I ended up doing things, no two ways about it in the street, that a man shouldn’t do... then they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs, they said they’d give me more and they did! They gave me things, they gave me this place, they gave me plastic surgery, they gave me things...” the man doze off and Tasha rolls her eyes, out of everything she had thought about the terrorist, this is the last she expects, she kicks his feet “And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions” she grits her teeth
“That is so much better than stupid Iron Patriot” she mutters, she then takes an unexpected turn as she sees an event covered up by some local media. She enters into a news ban and she cuts the broadcast sound as an old man with ridicously big glasses cheers a model on, she moves to the computer and checks the net speed: horribly slow “Huh... well that ain’t gonna cut it” she can hear the door being open and the cameraman talking to her
“Peggy? Peggy Carter?” she nods “You know Peggy Carter?” Steve’s eyes go wide, Tasha looks at him puzzled
Antonia was 6 her mother and her aunt became her heroes, she wanted to be more like Maria and Peggy, and she decided that Antonia or Toni was a too much of a male name for that, so secretly (without Howard noticing) she changed her first name to Natasha, Natasha Antonia Stark.
also, there's going to be more chapter cause, literally, I'm copping Iron Man 3 letter by letter from the movie (I wanted a script QnQ) but with my own twist... the biggest changes come from the next chapter forward (or so I think)
The next morning they are found sleeping like that, Steve hugs Tasha and Tasha clings to Steve while being right on top of him, nobody says anything to the pair until is breakfast time and they have to wake them up, Tasha having not quite the mother of hangovers, but one really close to it. Neither Nat nor Clint mentions the compromising situation they founded in, but if they took adorable pictures of a certain genius with a full-size national icon/cap-bear, well only they and Bruce know.
“It predates any known Mandarin attack, the incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide. The heat signature is remarkably similar, 3,000 degree Celsius” the report shows a man in the US army
“Actually I am” the redhead from earlier put a set of cuffs in the table and proceeds to subdue Tasha to the table
“Okay, look, I need to be alone with you someplace not here, it’s urgent” Tasha turns around and start walking to the living room
Steve finds her in the containment room. She is standing there, seeing the bloody pattern, not saying a word, she suddenly looks older than before, older than even her age. But that’s just an image, her youth is still there, hidded by worry and grief. The soldier doesn’t know what to say to her, he wants to comfort her at least, she seemed pretty shaken up by the whole deal earlier, and even if according to doctors, Coulson has good chances of walking by his own feet, he knows the risks are still there, so he doesn't want to say anything that could lead to misperceptions and a false sense of security.
Is when Fury reaches him, asking for help to recover the same weapon Howard Stark fished out from the ocean while looking for him: the Tesseract. Honestly, they should have let it there. He would go of course, if the world needed him again.
“Fine, see that red lever? It’ll slow the rotors down enough for me to get out, just trust me and wait for my word” she says while entering the turbine. Steve jumps next to the lever and waits
“Good, let’s see what we got” over the chunk that was ripped off the Hellicarrier, Steve can see the Iron man suit fly near the turbine, he's still amazed by it, which makes the guilt over what he said earlier grow. Tasha muters under her breath some things he can’t understand, only making out the words ‘cooling system’, ‘dislodging’ and ‘debris’, then she turns to Steve, her mechanical voice ringing in his ear “I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position” Captain America jumps over the destroyed railing, opens the control panel and promptly freezes ‘
“Like a mechanic? You know? If I was building Iron Man and War Machine, I would have added in, um... the retro...”
“Hey! Don’t insult Pepper’s baby” she looks at Steve trying to be severe “It’s not a nice thing to do after she worked so hard on that” she whispers, he feels horrible with himself looking at the pained expression of the girl, which's half fake by the way; sure she's defending Pepper’s 12% fault in the design, but she also knows that not everyone likes it, hell, even Rhodey had mocked her at the time. But she always liked to throw older people who look down at her like this, it seems that Captain America isn’t the exception... as much as it stings
“Hey, have a little faith for old little me alright? I almost had this figured it out seven years ago when I was drunk” she smugly answers “I can get them better, that’s what I do... I fix stuff”
“He said that huh? Yeah remember to strangle him when he is better” she says with a smile but the worry in her eyes is quite obvious, so obvious that the question leaves his lips before he can contain it
’ Tasha thinks, after seeing Loki stab him she couldn’t stop thinking the worst case scenario. Fury puts Coulson’s Captain America cards on the table next to Steve, a little bloody “You might want to sign that, for when he recovers” Tasha nods, because (almost uncle) Phil dying is not an option
“They say he will recover” Steve opts to say, Tasha doesn’t show any signs of listening to him other than nodding slightly “You two seem close” He adds trying to get her to open up, miraculously it works
“Yeah, a little bit” Rhodey still looks in shock, like he can't believe he spent the last few months looking out for
”Then prove it! Put the hammer down” Natasha feels a wave of panic, (that doesn’t have to do with the feeling of that weapon in her chest, shut up) and tries to stop it
Tasha clash against the new man and both of them crash in the forest, she stands and keeps her distance from the other god
“Then why don’t you just build something?” that simple answer makes a lot more sense than anything else really, because yes, she may just be a tiny woman in a can but she is Natasha Antonia Stark, she built MARK I in a cave, she can do it, she can do it everything and all her mind focus on that fact, clearing every despair thought of her head
“Turbine’s loose, mostly intact, but it’s impossible to get out there and made repairs while we are on the air, and if we lose one more engine, we’ll stop being up here”
“What I think is that Loki’s trying to wind us up. The man means to start a war, and if we don’t stay focused, he’ll succeed, we have orders, we should follow them” Tasha scrunches her nose adorably
She was laying in her bed while Natasha was idly drawing little circles in her naked back when she asked her about it "Iron man as a suit powerful so is needed in the field” the spy said while ghosting the young yet scarred skin with her lips “But you are so young котенок” when she called her kitten in Russian, the little Stark couldn't do more than blush “You didn’t tell anyone about your palladium poisoning and that’s not what a team does” Tasha shivered in pleasure at the kiss in her neck “And I do not recommend you throwing your life in any next danger” Tasha pouted but didn’t argue any forward, it was the only night she would ever get with the beautiful spy so she definitely wanted to make the most of it.
“He... he is fighting... delicate, but... he is gonna get better, he ought to” she says, trying to convince herself more than the two spies in the room, she looks at Clint and sees his pained expression “Don’t.” Tasha warns him while putting her hand on his “Don’t do that to yourself, this was Loki’s doing, it’s about magic and other stupid, senseless stuff” Clint nods
“Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography" then she exist the building and takes cover behind an old stove. Just as see thinks she is free, she hears the metal crackling, the city water tank bending dangerously towards her, the glowing orange man next to it. Tasha doesn’t stops to look and keeps running between Christmas trees, she reaches a dead end and promptly falls before feeling the water trash her. She coffs and tries to dislodge her foot from a piece of debris, fortunately, she is not hurt, only soaked and trapped. She hears Harley’s strain voice
I wanted to make a special shout out to everyone who comments the series (especially to ameve2, I love you <3 and HinaLuvLuvChan, thank you!!!)
“You didn’t come here because I bat my eyelashes at you” she deadpans. Tasha looks at them surprised, Nat flirted with Bruce? She sooo needed that story, ‘
Steve is quite impressed with Tasha’s House in Malibu, yet he definitely doesn’t show it, the beach house has more of the playgirl the others talk about when describing Tash though. He wonders what the genius is doing in her lab as he prepares dinner, Tasha only came out once after returning to see Rhodey, visibly upset about something, to get an enormous box that was delivered and to tell Steve that Pepper was joining them for dinner, the soldier nods, just a tiny bit disappointed that he didn’t get to spent time alone with the busy genius, not that he ever was going to admit that though. The sun was setting when he heard Pepper’s car outside and seconds later the woman herself enters the house
“So this is how you’ve been managing your downtime huh?” Rhodey says as he continues fighting against the ex-military soldiers
“Rogers!” Nat calls at him, the man looks appalled, they send him to look out for the genius and now... Steve thinks that they have every right to be pissed at him yet the spy only hugs him “It’s okay, we are going to find her” he nods, blinking back the tears of worry and despair
“Well that sounds exhausting” she makes a mocking pout and continues with the business talk “The rest of the materials Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily, only major component he still needs is a power source, it would have to be a high energy density, something to kick start the cube”
“You know J? I should probably sell you to MIT for all the sass” she replies as she stands up. The door of her workshop opens and a blond, muscular guy enters
“Hey!” Tasha pouts “I wouldn’t do anything to compromise the virtue of a National Icon” Steve groans at that, the fact that he is used to be trated like a hero and all, doesn’t mean he likes it, of course, Tash is only joking, he can’t help but blush at the connotation of the conversation though. Clint snorts
“Save it, Loki’s gonna keep this fight focused on us and that’s what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Tasha up top, she’s gonna need us...” he interrupts his strategic plan when Bruce appear in a ridiculously small motorbike, getting off, he looks around the city
“Clint is going to be so happy you let him play with other children” both deadly women snickers “Will be there, stay safe
“Sure Tash, let’s pretend you weren’t sober when you kissed him last Christmas” the girl almost chockes in her own spit
“JARVIS? JARVIS? Please... please don’t leave me now, buddy” she begs to no avail, her friend is down, she is all alone. But she is gonna get out of this, she is Tasha Stark for god’s sake. She drags her armor through the snow, all the way to a little store, where she first stoles a poncho (she lefts a few dollars on the entrance shut up) and then she proceeds to call her security server, so it can transfer her message to all her receivers, she sends one to Nat’s code and one to Steve’s code
The rest of the week has both Steve and Tony finding sneakier and more elaborate ways to pass more notes to one another as well as leave more little gifts. When Steve finds a new belt in his saddlebags, he shakes his head. Tony really is outdoing himself. The leather is thick and when Steve looks closer, he can see that there are roses burned into the belt. Not only are roses some of Steve's favorite flowers, but Brooklyn itself is known for its roses. Reaching back in the saddlebag, Steve finds Tony's note. It's another scrap of paper, but there are no sketches on the back this time. Instead, Tony has included his own crude drawing of a rose and added the name of the artist who made the belt.
Moving back into Steve’s lap, Tony spreads out over him. “I trust you, Steve. With everything. You show me over and over how you take care of me and I was happy to do this with you.”
Used to the way Tony skips from subject to subject, Bruce cards his fingers through dark curls and smiles. “Clean enough.”
Tony rubs Peter’s back, still amazed that this tiny little thing is their son. “I do too.” He brushes a chaste kiss over Steve’s lips. “You hold him, I’ll get the bassinet.”
Shaken from his trance, Tony smiles. “I’ve missed you too.” The words are earnest and Tony takes a step closer to Steve. “I’ll be there. At dinner. Promise.”
“No!” Clint is almost beside himself. Steve had never withheld affection from any of them, but what he gave was always more in the realm of encouraging words, or hugs and cuddles. Never kisses. “He’ll give us a hug or let us sleep on him, but he’s never kissed any of us. What kind of head kiss?”
Once he’s dressed, and given Roth enough details to share with the other servants, he goes down and finds both Bucky and Sam waiting for him. The grins he’s greeted with are all too satisfied and he rolls his eyes. Steve is thinking of changing direction and going somewhere else when Bucky appears at his side and takes his arm.
The rustling near him lets Tony know Steve is sitting up. He can hear a tray moving on the coffee table and his mouth waters at the thought of food. “Sweet or savory?”
I know this Clint is essentially the furthest thing from MCU Clint and that is on purpose. I am very much pulling from Avengers Assemble Clint as well as comics Clint. He's one of my favorite overly competent disasters.
As another week comes to an end, Tony decides it's time to put his next plan into action. He's made a lot of progress on the shield. Instead of just an assortment of rings, the three main rings are welded together and the center portion has been fitted with a star. He covers the pieces and begins cleaning up. He's eager to put his plan in motion. It's a big step, but he's ready to take it.
Steve turns, ready to start searching for Tony but stops when he feels Bucky grab his wrist. “Buck? What are you doing? We need to find Tony.”
“You’re right, I won’t.” Tony opens his hand and laughs at the frown on Steve’s face when the white piece is revealed. “Aw, don’t pout. Just think of the extra challenge.”
Peter rubs his face on the burping cloth and Steve begins patting his back. “I know, Petey. Don’t worry, those nasty gas bubbles will be gone soon.” He looks over at Tony and smiles. “Pretty sure the burping cloth will protect my back.”
Jarvis observes his young charge as he gets him dressed. Tony is usually pretty good at masking his emotions, but today they are all right on the surface for Jarvis to see. Instead of saying something, he admires the clothing Tony has chosen. “If I may say, sir, the prince will not be able to look away.”
“I’m glad you see that, sir.” One last look is all Jarvis needs and he turns Tony, pointing him to the door. “You are ready, Tony. Now, go give your prince his surprise.”
When Steve’s birthday arrives, it is filled with celebrations. The kingdom itself feasts and hosts party after party in the streets. The air is full of cheers and toasts to their prince. Everyone wishing him and his betrothed good health. In every street, the air is heavy with the scents of cooking food. Shopkeepers and show off their wares and bakers and butchers hand out treats to anyone and everyone that walks by. Wanting a glimpse of the various parties, Tony and Steve sneak into town to enjoy some of the feasts. Their pockets are full of pockets and candies to hand out to their people, eager to join in the fun and spread a little joy themselves.
“How about this then? You can go and take a quick bath. While you do that, I will go and change. We will meet right here in say, fifteen minutes?”
Restless, Steve paces for a minute before going and pouring himself a glass of whiskey. He doesn’t drink though. Not right away at least. He moves to the fireplace and watches the way the flames dance. An ember falls to the ground and he remembers the time an ember had managed to get under Tony’s gloves. Steve had been with him in the forge that day watching him work. He'd heard Tony make a pained sound and had quickly removed the glove and brought him over to the water pump as quickly as he could. The burn itself had not been bad, but Steve had sent someone for Bruce anyway. As soon as it had healed, Tony had come to find him and showed him how Steve had saved him from another scar.
He doesn't know how long he lays there, but he decides it's enough. He sits up and runs a hand through his hair, trying to get it in place. He looks at the empty space next to him and finds himself wishing Tony was with him. Steve imagines how it would be to lean over and kiss him awake. How simple it would be to hold him close as they spend the morning talking. His mind drifts to the other things they could do in bed, but the thought of just basking in the closeness and intimacy is more than appealing to Steve.
“It was the best day. I’ve been very happy here.” Tony scuffs his toe against the dirt and lifts his head to look Steve in the eye. “Happier than I’ve ever been.”
Giggles bubble out from Tony's lips and he feels absolutely giddy. He points at the top of his head again. “Just right here. Real quick.”
Tony had initially planned on waiting until the end of the night to give Steve his gift, but as dinner continues, he realizes he doesn't want to wait that long. He wants to see Steve’s face when he brings out the shield. He does manage to wait until the plates are cleared. As soon as he can, he kisses Steve on the cheek and pushes back from the table.
The longer he stares into Steve's eyes, the more he wonders if he should push up on his toes and press his lips to Steve's. He starts to and then stops. There's a look in Steve's eyes that tells him he needs to wait. While they have made progress, they are not quite at that place yet. Tony wants their first kiss to be special and if it happens when Steve isn't ready, Tony knows they'll both regret it.
When the bottle is finally ready, he tests the temperature on his wrist and carries it to the nursery. Peeking over the edge of the crib, he can see Peter’s face is screwed up and red as he gets ready to let out another wail.
“Tony, oh God, Tony! So good.” Steve groans, staring deep into Tony’s eyes. They both want this to last, but they are also very aware that their time is limited. Peter could, and if they’re honest, probably will wake up at any moment. When he does wake up, there will be tears and he will want both his fathers.
Tony leans against her and nods. “Steve is my best friend, but he's also become more than that. I think about him all the time. I dream about him! And not nice, frolicking in meadow-type dreams." He turns his face into her shoulder and groans. "Dreams that take place in darkened rooms and in bed. Steve has always made it clear he doesn't expect that, or even really want it, but I can't stop thinking about it. Is that how it is for you? With Clint and Bucky.”
It is perfect. Steve gets his arm around Tony and is amazed by just how right this all feels. Tony fits in his arms like he’s made for him. Steve laughs and Tony looks up, confused. He tells him the trail his thoughts went down and Tony laughs too.
Grateful to find his bedclothes left out, Steve changes and splashes some water on his face. He’d hoped the cool water would shock his thoughts onto a different path, but instead, he circles right back to a slightly crooked smile and a pair of dark brown eyes that have begun appearing in his dreams.
As he waits for Steve, Tony’s thoughts, as usual, wander back to his forge. Instead of the long list of projects he tends to think about, he can only focus on one. Steve’s shield is so close to being finished. He has each piece ready now, and all he has to do now is put them together and add some paint. Steve’s colors are always well-stocked, so that part should not be too difficult as long as Tony doesn't take too long choosing the design. Before his thoughts can wander too far down the path of shield design, he hears the familiar sound of Steve’s boots on the stairs. Tony starts to turn, but freezes and refuses to move. If he continues facing forward, he can pretend that it’s not that big of a deal that he can recognize the sound of Steve’s boots.
All of the jewelry is beautiful, but there is one piece that his eye keeps drifting back to. He picks up a ring that is made of golden strands made to look like vines intertwining and overlapping one another. There are small rubies dotted along the band and when Steve slips it over one of his fingers, he likes how flat it lays against his skin. He wouldn’t expect Tony to wear it while smithing, but if he chose to, it wouldn’t be too much in the way.
“Wow!” He lets go of Steve’s hand and just continues to admire the room. “This is amazing, Steve!” He turns to face Steve and makes the mistake of looking into his eyes. They’re an even brighter blue than usual and he almost gets lost in them. “When did a month turn into years?”
The next day, the queen calls for her husband and son, determined to get to the bottom of what Steven is feeling. It doesn’t take much prodding for him to start talking. Steven knows it’s pointless to try and talk around what he’s feeling, so he tells them everything. Both the king and queen are saddened to hear their son speaking of love as though it has already passed him by. They ask for some time which Steven happily gives them. He does not know what they are thinking of doing, but he trusts them and knows they only want what is best for him.
Tony raises an eyebrow and snorts. “Come on, Steve. I know I’m good-looking, but," He points to the sketch on the open page, "nothing like this.”
Kneeling in front of Tony, Steve locks eyes with Tony. “My beautiful baby. You’re doing so well. It’s going to be an easy night. Gonna feed you some treats. Let you suck my cock.” He leans in and takes Tony’s mouth in a fierce kiss. “And if you’re real good, I’ll fuck you.”
Tony lets Natasha’s words sink into his mind and finds himself smiling. “I really need to finish the shield then, don’t I? It’s the perfect courting gift.”
"No! Please, Tones," Clint asks with a grimace. "I love you, but your poetry is not one of your many talents." Tony sticks his tongue out at him and Clint shrugs. “What about if you waited in a chair and just talked to him?”
Since Steve is here, and he’s done what he can for the day, Tony decides he might as well get a head start on getting ready. He moves toward Steve and takes his arm. Steve is a little stiff at first, but once he realizes what Tony is doing, he relaxes and follows his lead.
“You really can’t, but I’m glad you think so.” Getting his fingers under Tony’s chin, Steve tips his face up and presses a gentle kiss to his lips. “I want you to go and shower for me. Nice and thorough. And since I’m feelin’ a little possessive, use my things. Want you smellin’ like me. I’m going to set out what I want you to wear and then you will come and find me in the living room. Got it?”
“I do.” She stands and holds her hand out for Tony. “Now, let me finish acting as your valet. I know you won’t sleep, but you should at least be comfortable.”
“Still with me, Steve? Seems like we’re both a little out of sorts, tonight.” The words are soft, caring and Tony tips his head up to get a good look at Steve. He’s never seen such a far-off look on his face. “Should we take a moment for ourselves before we enter?”
“Sorry, honey bear.” It’s not a surprise there was a bet on them, Tony’s just a little disappointed he never got the chance to get in on it. “Steve started it if that helps my case at all.”
There’s no doubting the truth to those words and Tony feels tears fill his eyes. He wants to throw his arms around Steve and not let go, but he still hesitates. Steve is so bright and clean and he is covered with two days of soot and grease and metal. He can still remember the scoldings he received from his parents for bringing filth into the house. The scoldings were also often followed by lectures about how Starks are meant to present themselves and behave. Tony had hated them and tried not to let their words sink in, but it’s clear they did.
The nerves Tony feels are familiar to Jarvis. He remembers being just as nervous before he asked Ana to marry him. “I am sure, young sir. You are going to have a wonderful time with the prince. I know for a fact, he was speaking with Happy about packing some of your favorites in his picnic basket.”
“Nat?" Tony lifts his head and hopes he's not crying. He swipes at his cheeks anyway, just in case. "When did you get here?”
Yes, the chapter count has gone up, but that's due to my own error of mis-numbering the chapters as I wrote lol
After a few minutes, he suddenly realizes Tony isn’t holding his hand anymore. Afraid he’s walked too far and left Tony behind, he whirls around and begins looking for him. Thankfully, Tony has not fallen behind but is instead standing in a patch of flowers, a bright smile on his face.
In the end, all the training paid off. In his sixteenth year, Steven lost his small sickly frame and grew almost a full foot in height. It was a mystery how it happened, but no one was more excited than Steven. When he arrived in the training yard and his father caught sight of him, he was glad he’d woken up late just so he could see the stunned look on his face.
Tony walks them out of the forge and blinks a little in the late afternoon sun. “In fact, I think I’ll go and pay a visit to the baths.” He looks at his nails and laughs. “There’s no saving my nails, but I can try and get the rest of this soot and grease off.”
“Jarvis! Please, I beg of you, no more. You and Ana are like family to me. I am glad you and Ana are still so in love, but there are things I do not need to think about.”
It all comes to a head a few days later when Pierce doubles his efforts to try and woo Steven to his side. When Steven once again rebuffs his suit, Pierce decides enough is enough. After Steven goes back to his rooms, he sends a few of his knights to quietly take Sam and Bucky to the dungeons. The next day he summons both Steven and Rumlow to his chambers.
The question was not what Tony had expected and, he tried to come up with an answer he felt would please Steve the most. Steve wasn’t having it though. He took Tony's hand in his and shook his head. He repeated the question and added, "you, Tony. Not what you think I want to hear, but what do you love doing?"
The game progresses and Steve manages to get the win by a very narrow margin. They play again, Tony managing to get the win. They both know it’s getting late, but neither of them is quite ready for the night to end.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice is barely a whisper now and he’s afraid Tony is going to be scared off by what is in the book.
“That’s right.” Steve lets go and takes the abused bud in his mouth, sucking and licking until Tony is panting. He moves to the other and reaches behind to smack Tony’s ass. “I want you taking all of me, got it? We both know you’ve got nothing on tomorrow, and I want to hear you a little hoarse.”
“I’ve always felt this pull,” he rubs at his chest again. “Right here. When I first saw Steve I felt it. Lately, though. It’s been stronger. Especially when I’m away from Steve. It’s been hurting too. Feels better when I see him, but I feel it constantly now.”
“I will. I will.” Tony feels elated. If it's this big a deal to Clint, it means he's not reading too deep into it. He can do what Clint is suggesting, and who knows? Maybe there is a chance for something more with Steve. “Okay, enough about me." Tony's heart is racing and talking about something else will help. "New topic. How did the new arrows work for you?”
When he leaves the pool, he stops at a cabinet to get a towel and choose a different soap. This one is gentler and is scented. Tony brings the bar of soap to his nose and catches the scent of bergamot and jasmine. It reminds him of his mother and Jarvis and Ana in the kitchens making tea. He brings it with him to the large pool and finds Bruce seated on a ledge, leaning against the wall, the hot water lapping at his chest. His eyes are closed, and he’s smiling as Clint tells him about his day. Tony waves to Clint and steps into the warm water with a happy sigh. Once Tony gets settled, Clint moves toward him, the corners of his mouth curving up in a sly grin.
All Bucky can do is stare. Does Steve not hear the way he talks about Tony? He shakes his head and laughs to himself. Of course, Steve doesn’t hear it. Steve is not going to make the connection that his feelings are romantic right away. His interest in other people has always been more friendly and familial rather than romantic. When Bucky and Sam were sneaking kisses with other maids, and each other once, Steve always told them the idea just never interested him.
“Careful, sweetheart." Steve notices the way Tony's cheeks stain pink at the endearment and he loves it. "Can’t have you fallin’ on me.”
Steve studies Tony, taking in every little detail. Miles of skin for him to touch and enjoy, the collar with its shield, marking Tony as completely and totally his. “Beautiful, sweetheart. You’re all mine, aren’t you.”
Bucky’s heart breaks for his best friend. He’d give his other arm to kill Rumlow again if it meant he could erase these doubts from Steve’s mind and heart.
“Fifteen minutes.” Steve’s eyes sparkle and he kisses Tony’s forehead. “I’d say I’d leave our picnic lunch out here to wait for us, but-”
“I want that.” Tony still isn’t sure how he and Natasha came to be so close. By all intents and purposes, they should not fit. Natasha is quiet and always watching whereas Tony tends to be louder and more frenetic. Yet, somehow they found one another and just worked. Tony could bring Natasha out of her shell and Natasha allowed Tony to enjoy the silence and quiet when he needed it but didn't know how to get it. “I want that with Steve.”
“I’m never going to forget that.” The quiet settles around them and Steve yawns. “How long until people come searching?”
Steven refuses to be used and ducks away from Pierce, ready to fight. Thankfully, while Steven kept Pierce talking, both Sam and Bucky had been able to free themselves from the dungeons. A few words from the servants let them know where Steven was and they rushed to join the fray. They engage Rumlow and Steven advances on Pierce. Anger fuels his every step and when he gets Pierce into a corner, he is determined to end this once and for all.
Ducking out from under Bucky’s arm, Steve takes a large swallow of his whiskey and sets the glass aside. He knows there’s no getting away from Bucky’s questions. His best friend is nothing if not persistent when he wants to know something and if Steve doesn’t answer him, he’ll rope Sam into the questioning as well and Steve will never get any peace.
Steve pouts. "Fine." He looks up at the clock again, disappointed that neither hand seems to have moved. "If Clint is that excited, it must be good. I can be patient. I can wait."
“You make a good point.” The water around has changed color and Tony grimaces. “See you in the big pool?”
“Yes, he is.” Jarvis takes a step to the side and gives Tony a nudge. “And you should not keep him waiting.”
I know I keep adding more tags, but I keep remembering things I'd forgotten to add when I first posted.
News spread quickly about what Tony and Clint had done and soon everyone was showing off their various scars and telling the stories of how they’d gotten them. Some stories featured battles or moments of clumsiness, and some stories were similar to Bruce’s. After those stories, everyone would gather close and offer whatever comfort they could, usually in the form of a giant cuddle pile in the main room. The biggest gesture came a few days after most stories had been told and it had come from Steve. He came to visit everyone as they were relaxing after dinner and took Bruce aside. Later that night, Bruce revealed to Tony that Steve had wanted to show Bruce his own scars and reassure him that the only way Bruce would leave the harem would be if he chose to leave. It still took some time before Bruce felt totally comfortable showing some skin but watching him walk confidently to the big pool warmed Tony’s heart.
“It is.” Steve lets Tony stare at the tower for a little longer before walking them closer. “Some of the old magic has lingered since I was woken." He feels the familiar itch under his skin from the magic in the air and gives Tony's hand a squeeze. "The most useful thing has been that tower stays hidden until you walk through the trees.”
“I trust you, Steve. So much. I know you won’t let anything happen.” They’ve just about made it back to the couch and Tony squeezes Steve’s hand. “Leg’s awake too. How do you want me, sir?”
“I know we need to get him used to sleeping in his crib, but yes, I want him in here with us, tonight.” Peter is a solid weight on his chest and something about holding him and having him so close settles something in Steve. “I like having him with us.”
Tony lets go of the dish and watches as Steve serves them both. Steve's hands are steady as he serves and Tony swallows hard. It’s when Steve isn’t acting like a prince that Tony is reminded that Steve is, in fact, the prince. Other royals would expect to be served, but Steve has always believed that if he expects to be served, he must also do what he can to serve his people. Once their plates are filled, Steve pours them each a glass of wine and raises his glass.
The queen is in her solarium this time of day and when Steve comes in, she sends her ladies away and beckons him closer. Her hair is more silver than the blonde it used to be and there are laugh lines around her mouth, but to Steve, she’s still the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen.
Steve helps Tony stand and they walk to the bathroom together. Steve does a quick clean up and steals one last kiss before putting on some pajama pants and moving into the kitchen.
“Jarvis, play some music. Something soft and instrumental.” Chopin comes over the speakers and Steve feels his shoulders relax. “Perfect.”
Tony plucks a daisy and brings it to his nose. “The flowers you’ve brought me. Started with just daisies, but you started adding more. Like that one.” Tony points at a pink flower. “And that one.”
He ducks into the room and closes the door before Steve can stop him or say a single word. He slides down against the door until he's sitting and forces himself to take a few deep breaths. Did he actually just do that? He kissed Steve’s hand. No one’s ever done that.
Steve had been in the kitchen preparing a platter of food to feed Tony when he hears the water stop. He bounces a little on the balls of his feet and brings the food into the living room to wait for Tony.
“I know you do.” He kisses Tony’s cheek and brings the blindfold up. “You’re gonna get to look all you want after. Promise.”
Tony watches where the knight ends up and brings a finger to his lips, tapping gently. It’s a rare occurrence he gets a plan past Steve and tonight is a night where Steve is on to him quickly. His whole body floods with happiness knowing the cookies were well received. He’d agonized for a while trying to figure out what he wanted to give, but kept coming back to the cookies and knew that it was fruitless to keep arguing with himself.
“Hush, young sir. You and the prince are courting. Enticing him is part of that. I remember when Ana just so happened to ‘lose’ a stocking because of a small tear.” Tony’s cheeks are bright red and Jarvis just chuckles. “Do not fret, young sir. She only flashed a bit of ankle at me. It was not until later that-”
“‘M fine, oh dear prince,” he mumbles into Steve’s chest. He clings a little longer before slowly forcing himself to let go. “You’re always there to catch me if I fall.”
He's reminded of the stories and fairytales his mother would read to him and Tony chuckles. As a child, he’d loved listening to her voice and would ask if he’d find his true love. Maria would hold him close and tell him she believed he would one day when he was all grown. Tony’s heart aches thinking of his mother and the carriage accident that took her from him.
He tries not to rush through his bath, but he still ends up scrubbing as fast as he can. Feeling clean enough, he hurries to his rooms to dress. His valet is patient as always. Like Jarvis, Roth knows his employer well. When Steve begins to fidget, he smiles and does what he can to hide the wrinkles that crop up. He leaves the prince for a moment to fetch the boutonniere and does his best not to laugh when the prince's eyes go wide when he sees the daisies.
“Yeah, it was.” He still inside Tony and it feels good. Steve knows Tony will get sensitive soon, so he’s gonna take what he can. “You’re so amazing, Tony.”
Note safely in Rhodey's hands, Tony races off to the baths. He stops at the door, hands on his knees as he catches his breath. When he's able, he goes inside and looks around in shock. It is only on the rarest of occasions that the baths are this empty. He can't help but be a little pleased that he has the baths to himself. He can take as much time as he wants and not worry about hogging the soap. He washes his hair twice and really scrubs at the dirt and grime covering his body. Once again, there’s not much he can do about the still lingering dirt under his nails, but he remembers how Steve said he didn’t mind and smiles.
The words are a little muffled, but Steve drifts off happily, knowing he heard Tony say, “I love you too, Steve.”
Blinding light fills the room and when it starts to dim, both Tony and Steve gasp. They can both see the way Steve’s silvery blue strings twine together with Tony’s red and gold and they can only stare in amazement.
Tony splashes him. “Just because that worked for you and Bucky doesn’t mean it would work with me and Steve. He’s never shown interest in any of us that way and I don’t want him to think that’s all I want. He’s more like Nat. I need a subtler approach. He deserves to be wooed and courted. Maybe I could try some poetry?”
Tony moans into the kiss, hands coming up to grab at Steve. “Please, sir. I want it. I want it all.”
He watches with bated breath as the door finally opens. When he catches sight of a bright smile and golden hair, he is finally able to relax a little.
It’s quiet for a minute and Steve worries something is wrong. He reaches for the doorknob when he hears Tony’s voice. “Steve? If that’s you, come in already.”
He begins massaging Tony’s prostate, not letting up until Tony begins fucking himself on his fingers.
Speechless, Tony goes still and stares. Steve blushes, but no part of him regrets the kiss. “I’ll see you at dinner, Tony. And don’t think I won’t send Rhodey to come and find you.”
One of Tony’s very favorite things about the land of Brooklyn is the natural hot springs. When Steve’s ancestors had settled on the land, they’d smartly taken advantage of the springs and built over them to keep the castle warm during the frigid winters. Regular access to hot water was an additional reward that everyone in the castle enjoyed. As the years passed, another of Steve’s relatives had had the idea to build a bath over a section of the springs and Tony had no problem reaping the benefits of their forethought.
Fingers fumbling on the pawn he was reaching for, Tony feels his cheeks heat. He manages to get it to the square he was moving it to and drops his head into his hands. “You’re not just saying that, right? Even Bruce can only take so much.”
“Maybe.” Tony licks his lips and reaches out for Steve. He finds his leg and slips his hand under the cuff of his pants. “You know how much I like having something in my mouth.” His hand trails up Steve’s calf. “Especially when it’s big. And thick.”
Before they are to depart, the queen cannot erase the feeling that something is wrong. Taking her son aside, she takes his hands in her and asks him if this knight truly makes him happy. Steven has never been able to lie to his mother, and this time is no different. He confesses to her that he has suspected something was not right about the knight’s story, since he never felt the tug of those invisible strings the seer Margaret had spoken of so long ago. Before his mother can say another word, he adds that he is hoping that by accompanying Rumlow to his king, he will be able to discover the truth of what is going on.
“Just as silver and blue suits you. And look how well they go together.” Finally pulling his gaze away from the strings, Tony stares into Steve’s eyes. “When did you first feel the pull?”
It’s scary how perceptive Bucky can be sometimes. His ability to see through bullshit is one of his greatest talents, even if it can be annoying when he cuts straight to the truth of what Steve is saying at times.
“Oh, sweetheart.” Steve pulls Tony into a tight embrace. “I like you in every way. Every single way.”
“You were too formal for a picnic, sir.” He drapes the waistcoat over his arm and reaches to undo a couple of buttons at Tony’s throat. “I also believe the prince will enjoy a bit of skin.”
A plate appears in front of Steve and he avoids the question by taking a bite of sausage. “Let me eat for god’s sake.”
Reaching between them, Steve gets a hand on Tony’s cock and strokes him in time with his thrusts. “Too long. Shit, sweetheart, I’m close.”
Peeking over Tony’s shoulder, Steve tries to get another look at Tony's secret project. Whatever it is, he knows it will be incredible. Tony’s creations are almost always amazing, and even the few, quirkier, things have still turned out to be useful.
Lifting his head, he looks at Steve and waits for him to get comfortable before resting his head on his shoulder. He keeps his attention on Peter and strokes his cheek with one finger, marveling at how velvety soft his skin always is.
Face pressed into Bucky’s shoulder, Steve is still. He knows Bucky is right. Tony is not pushy about those sorts of things and he’s always been very open and honest when it comes to anything to do with sex or romance. Steve also knows that he is as much a novice as he is and won’t judge him for his own inexperience.
Pressing a kiss to Steven’s forehead, Sarah holds him close and notices the light finally beginning to dim from around Margaret. Moving quickly, she lays Steven back in his crib and helps Margaret into a chair before she collapses.
Tony waits for Steve to stand and then slides the shield onto his arm. He tightens the leather straps and takes a step back to get the full picture. Steve looks fierce and proud. He holds the shield held near his chest and looks out into the room at their friends and family. The colors are those of the kingdom and the white star in the center is like the ones that adorn their flags.
“I can do that. I know Tony. I know what he likes and what he hates,” Steve chuckles, “I even know about the sweets he charms the cooks into setting aside for him.”
When his parents call for him later that evening, Steven finds he’s both curious and nervous. He does not know what solution his parents could have concocted. They bring him to the table and begin laying out their plan. In the weeks they’ve been awake, they noticed a new trend amongst their fellow rulers. The searches for suitable brides and grooms have led many to form harems for themselves and their children. This way there is a large pool of candidates to choose from. The king and queen hope that even if Steven does not feel the pull of invisible strings, he will find friendship and surround himself with people who care about him.
Closing the distance between them, he gathers Tony close. “Tony. Sweetheart. I’m going to ask you a question and there is no wrong answer. Do you want a shirt?”
The pace Steve sets is hard and fast and all Tony can do is take it. He feels himself on the edge but he needs just a little more. He starts to reach for his cock and Steve grabs his wrist. “You know better, Tony.”
After this pronouncement, both the king and queen look to the other and share a few knowing looks. This knight’s crowing is overly loud, boisterous, and grating, and he is certainly not the type of person they imagined for their son. The queen looks over at Steven and frowns when she sees the strain around his eyes and the way he seems to be forcing himself to remain quiet. She wants to hope that it is due to being awakened in a whole new world but makes a vow to herself to keep a watchful eye on him.
“Haha, you’re just so funny, sleeping beauty.” Tony sets the board up and looks at the box containing the pieces. He pulls out one white pawn and one black pawn and holds them behind his back. “How about this. I’ll mix them up behind my back and let you choose. I don’t need to pick first to beat you.”
On a night where Steve is dining with his mother and not the harem, Tony finds a small bouquet of daisies on his plate. He brings the daisies to his nose first, enjoying the light happy scent of them, the card under them going unnoticed. He knows they’re from Steve. There's no one else they could be from. He’d mentioned casually one day how they were his favorites, and he’s not surprised Steve remembered. Tony blushes when he catches Clint watching and sets the flowers aside to read the card. Like the note he’d slipped Steve a few days earlier, it’s light and a little silly. He's included a short accounting of his day and mentions Tony's note, saying he will be ransoming off the sketch on the back. Tony laughs and doesn't care who ends up looking at him. He'd forgotten he'd written his note on the back of one of his sketches. There is one line that resonates with him though. It’s simple, just Steve saying how he’d seen the daisies and wanted Tony to have them. It means a lot to Tony, though. It means he's in Steve's thoughts as much as Steve is in his own.
Tony blushes. “It was just before I came in here. It was just on the top of my head,” he points to the spot, and he’d swear he could almost still feel Steve’s lips. “But he’s never done that before. Has he done it with you?”
Things like how Steve will be able to carry this shield proudly should he ever need to take it into battle. Things like how he will breathe easier knowing his prince, his love, is protected by something he, himself has put his blood, sweat, and tears into. Steve will wield the shield with grace and power and use it to protect himself and others. He’ll come home with it on his arm and Tony will be waiting for him. They'll run to each other Steve will let Tony look him over for injuries, kissing him all over before asking Steve to take them somewhere more private. Realizing his thoughts have once again begun to wander where they shouldn't, Tony takes a deep breath and looks down at the shield again.
Once the noise dies down a little, he looks out into the crowd and raises the shield above his head. “Thank you, everyone, for being here. The night is still young, so let the celebrations continue!”
Tony moves to meet Steve’s thrusts and pulls him down so he can kiss him again. “Come, Steve. Come for me. I want to feel it.”
The bathing rooms are warm and humid as always and Tony's hair sticks to his forehead and he ventures deeper inside. He strips down and tosses his clothes in a nearby basket to be cleaned later. He knows they will never be truly clean, but they’re comfortable and worn in the best ways. After one unfortunate instance where one of Tony’s favorite shirts had been consigned to the rag bag, it had become a rule that Tony’s clothes were washed as best as they could be. It was only when his clothes were totally unsalvageable that they were disposed of. Tony had felt silly crying over a shirt, but it had been one of his most comfortable, and every patch Ana had sewn in had meant something to him.
“Hmm?” He looks down and laughs. “Oh, right.” He lets go of Steve’s wrist and shoos him off. “Go on, Stevie. Go get your man.”
Steve gathers a few toys he knows Tony loves, curious if Tony will want to try them, as well as his collar. Steve loves the collar just as much as Tony does. Made from a soft mahogany leather, burnished to a bright shine with a metal shield as the only sign of who Tony belongs to.
“Mhmm,” Steve hums, eyes sparkling as he offers Tony a warm smile. “More like I’ll be letting you win one.”
Steve rubs Tony’s back and kisses the top of his head. "I am too, sweetheart. We’re going to take things slow tonight. And real easy. Gonna start simple too.”
Taking the ring from Steve, Sarah studies it with a soft smile. “A good choice, dearest. Do you want different stones? We can take some from another piece of jewelry if you’d like.”
Since it’s just the two of them, Clint takes the opportunity to poke Tony in the ribs. “C’mon, Tones. Lean against me. You've been in your forge forever. Close your eyes and sleep a little. I won’t let you drown.”
“Not that long. Barely an hour.” Sarah starts another row and says, “21 years. That’s how long I’ll have with my son. Who would want to curse a child, though?”
Steve kisses him on the cheek. “Pick me some flowers? Just pick whatever you like. I always like it when there's a variety.”
Caught in the honeyed gold of Tony’s gaze, Steve has a hard time turning away. He runs a hand through his hair and tries to get himself back under control. He really has missed Tony. Since the beginning, he’s tried to sit next to a different person at dinner each night, but lately, he’s found himself drifting to the chair next to Tony more and more often. Usually, when Tony is engrossed in a project, Steve will sit with the others and talk to them, but this past week it’s been harder than usual. He frequently found himself listening for the sound of Tony’s voice more than once.
“Mhmm, sure,” Tony murmurs. When the bottle is empty, Peter pushes it away and Tony laughs. “Okay, okay. No more bottle. Looks like papa wants the honor of spit-up down his back, tonight.”
The day after Tony arrived with Steve, Clint had taken one look at him and taken him under his wing. With an arm around Tony’s shoulder, he’d started walking around the castle, telling him this would be the best, and most exclusive, tour. Every place they stopped, Clint had taken the time to show Tony how everything worked, as well as any shortcuts that could be found. He had also come to Tony’s room in the middle of the night to take Tony on another tour, where he shared all his tips and tricks for getting around unseen.
Outside the door to his rooms, he stops and catches his breath. When he’d been running, it was easy to ignore any doubts or nerves, but now that he’s standing here, they all come rushing to the forefront of his mind. No. He can't let himself think like that. Tonight is going to be a good night. Whatever Tony has planned will be special and good and uniquely Tony, and Steve is ready for it.
Grabbing the soap made especially for him to cut through even the toughest dirt and grime, Tony begins scrubbing. It doesn't take long for his skin to make an appearance and he finds he’s especially grateful for whoever made this soap. If he didn’t have it, he’d be stuck in this tub for hours using bar after bar of soap trying to get clean. And even with all that, there would still some grease and dirt left.
Tony’s eyes close and he presses his face into Steve’s chest. “No.” He groans and drops his arms. “Not yet. Can I wear one of yours later?”
Tony blushes. “Thank you, Jarvis.” His hands smooth down the deep scarlet and gold of his waistcoat and he feels more confident. “I think I have everything. And Happy said they’d be sending the food up?”
“I couldn’t very well send you on your own, now could I?” Jarvis pushes Tony back and begins brushing his clothes again, trying to remove the wrinkles. “I needed to be sure the prince was going to take care of you.”
“Not at first, no.” Gentle fingers card through Steve’s hair and she continues. “Ours was an arranged marriage. Advantageous for both our kingdoms. Your father was one of many suitors. Margaret and I had some say in who my parents chose, but they made the final choice. I am glad they chose him. He was a good man and asked for the chance to court me properly before we actually married. He wanted to show me himself without other suitors interfering. Our love still took some time to bloom, both of us unsure how we felt about having our lives arranged for us. As we courted, I watched him become the king he was meant to be and he stayed by my side as I learned what it meant to be queen.”
Steve looks into the boxes his mother pointed out and he can see why she thought they would suit Tony. Most of the pieces look unassuming and simple. It’s only when he looks closer, that he can see some of the intricate and delicate metalwork that has gone into each of the rings, necklaces, and bracelets.
“I want to wake up with him. I want to know what he looks like with nothing on but a smile that’s just for me. And I want him to see me too. All of me. I want, oh god. I want to know what it would be like to sleep with him and not in the way I usually mean when I say sleep, but in the way, you and Sam mean when you say sleep.”
As they walk, Steve does most of the talking. He informs Tony of any obstacles and tells him how proud he is of Tony. How amazed he is at Tony’s trust and obedience.
Tony ducks under the water to rinse out the soap and one look at Bruce’s face and he knows it’s going to take another round of soap. Bruce’s fingers slide back into his hair, really working the soap into his scalp and Tony’s eyes close.
A sound at the door pulls him from the memory and he goes to open it. He has an idea who it might be and is surprised he didn't show up sooner. Just as he expected, Bucky is waiting on the other side with a knowing smile on his face. Steve stares at him and tilts his head. “What’s that look about?”
“Hmm?” Steve is pulled from his thoughts and finally notices Bucky leaning against Tony’s door with Bruce. “What are you two doing here? Where’s Tony? Is he okay?”
There’s something more to Steve’s words and Bucky has never been one to let something go. Especially when it comes to his best friend. “Spill it, Stevie. You’re not tellin’ me something.”
Steve chuckles and pushes away from the post he’d been leaning on. He walks deeper into the forge, the heat from the coals turning his cheeks red. “Lots and lots of practice.” His eyes flick over to the beaten circle of metal on the table. “You gonna tell me what you’re makin’?”
“It’s me, Tony.” He takes in the dinner set for two and the chess set on a table near the fireplace. “What is all of this?”
Tony ignores Steve in favor of looking down at Peter. “Don't listen to your papa. He’s so silly. We just don’t want to miss anything.”
He can hear Steve praising him and he moans around Steve’s length. Just as he hoped, Steve’s hips jerk and Tony swallows around him.
He gives a short bow to Steve and smiles. “Your highness, Lord Stark has asked if you would please return to your rooms?”
There’s something about the way she says those words that starts the wheels turning in Steve’s head. “Mama, did you have anything to do with last night?”
Tossing the rest of the whiskey back, he grimaces at the burn and runs a hand through his hair. “But it’s different with Tony. When I met him, I felt this, this, this-”
Natasha takes a seat next to Tony and takes his hand. “Your feelings for our prince have grown stronger. It is no longer just on the surface.”
Rhodey laughs. “I’m happy for you. Though, couldn’t you have waited one more week? I had money on you two.”
Draping the burping cloth over his shoulder, Steve presses his lips to Tony’s cheeks. “You’re the best. Peter and I already agreed.”
Starting that day, Steven began training with others his age. Joseph wanted him to build up his strength and hopefully prepare him for whatever was coming for him in five years. It was a surprise to everyone but Joseph that Steven took to the sword quickly. It was a natural extension of his arm and he was soon disarming even the most experienced knights. Joseph even allowed him to go out on a few excursions with his men, wanting Steven to get some real experience. He defeated bandits and raiders with ease and it was not long after that, that Steven began gaining a reputation.
Steve wishes he could argue that fact, but he knows they're right. So, instead, he just shrugs. Tony has proven to be the exception for just about every rule Steve has.
Steve walks Peter to the bedroom and finds that Tony is, in fact, in bed, waiting for them. He’s dressed in one of Steve’s t-shirts and a pair of loose sweats reading on his tablet. When he sees them, he happily sets the tablet aside and reaches for his son.
Those three words fill Steve with a joy he could not even begin to describe. He rests his forehead against Tony’s and one hand comes up to cup his cheek. “I love you too, Tony.”
Bucky laughs. “Nice to see you too, punk.” He pushes past Steve and goes to the window. “I’ve been sent to get all the details about last night. Clint is chomping at the bit to find out. Dashed out our room as soon as he was dressed. Pretty sure he’s pounced on Tony already.”
"We have not even exchanged a proper kiss yet. Save the wedding planning. Please.” Steve leans his head on her shoulder. “I care about him so much. Did you feel this way with papa?”
“That’s it, sweetheart. You always open for me so well. Played with yourself in the shower a little didn’t you?”
This continues for a couple of weeks more. The treats and gifts stay small, and the notes get longer. Tony is astounded by how poetic Steve can be even with the most mundane things. Tony tries his best, but cringes more often than not at the things he writes. Almost every single one of his notes starts including dark blots from where he's tried to scratch out his attempts.
Steve pops a cube of cheese into his own mouth and chews, watching Tony. It still amazes him how still Tony will become when he’s under. “I think something sweet now.” He takes a blueberry from the bowl and holds it to Tony’s lips. “Careful with this. It’s small and I don’t want you to choke.”
It takes some tugging for Steve to start walking again. The imprint of Tony’s lips on his cheek is still tingling and he feels absolutely giddy. He leads them into what looks like a small copse of trees and, just as he expected, he hears a gasp as they enter the clearing.
A week after the celebrations had ended, the queen sent for her seer. Seemingly both aged and ageless, Margaret had also been her mother’s seer. Sarah remembered when she’d first seen the seer and how her mother had sent her away, promising her time with Margaret would come soon. Though her visions could be vague, Margaret would do what she could to offer whatever insights she was able to. She took her job very seriously and made sure to do whatever she could to help those in her care. In the past, when Sarah was being courted by princes from the surrounding kingdoms, it had been Margaret who had shined a light on a kind prince from a smaller kingdom.
Sam and Bucky start walking Steve toward the table, sticking close so he can’t bolt. Resigned to his fate, Steve follows them and takes a seat. Breakfast is never a formal affair, so Sam stays with Steve while Bucky fills plates for them.
“Stop talking. Please.” Steve’s fork clatters to the table and he groans. “I’ll tell you. Just, please. No more.”
As soon as they enter the castle, they are taken to King Pierce. Steven looks at Pierce and he feels an itch between his shoulder blades. There is something familiar about this man and that sense of familiarity sends unease throughout Steve’s whole body. He tenses for only a second, but he can’t help but notice the way Pierce’s eyes turn cold for just a fraction of a second before switching back to his usual warmth. He greets Steven and his knights with a broad, toothy smile and declares a feast that night in their honor.
Tony leans back into Steve’s chest and breathes hard. “Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Sir. Fuck. Your cock. Fuck me, sir.”
Eyes wet, Tony throws his arms around Jarvis. “Thank you. I’m still so glad you came with me to this place.”
“I know you do, baby.” Steve manhandles Tony onto his lap. “Sit up for me.” Tony does and Steve angles his cock for Tony to sink down on. “Sit on my cock now.”
Bruce strips off his shirt without hesitation as he walks toward the big pool and Tony wants to cheer. One of the very first things Tony had learned about his roommate was that he didn’t like baring skin in front of anyone. Since Tony had a tendency to say whatever thought popped into his head, he’d asked Bruce why. Bruce had been taken aback at first, but it was clear to him that Tony wasn’t trying to make fun of him or be rude, he genuinely wanted to know. Bruce confessed that he had been worried that the scars he’d gotten from his father would put people off. He knew Steve wouldn’t send him away, but the idea of the others being disgusted by what they saw had been a little too much to deal with. It had been Tony and Clint, another harem member, who had taken it upon themselves to show off their own scars so that Bruce could start feeling a little more comfortable.
Steve drops his hand, but he can’t help but look at the spot again and finds himself curious what it would be like if his lips were to brush over that same spot. Would Tony like it? Would he blush? Was he ticklish elsewhere? Once his mind starts down that path, it can’t help but continue further. To other things. Things Steve doesn’t usually think about. Things like Tony in his bed with little to nothing on. Things like what it would be like to be inside Tony, their eyes locked together, Tony’s legs around his waist as he begs for more. Things he’s never thought about with anyone, not even Rumlow.
Pushing his hair back from his face, Tony smiles and lets his fingers drift through the water, enjoying the little whirlpools the motion creates. “I know Steve hasn’t had to really fight in a long time, but the king of Wakanda gifted us this incredible metal and Steve said I could use some of it. Once I started working with it, I couldn’t stop picturing a shield on Steve’s arm. I had to make it. Just that little extra bit of protection should he ever need it. He protects us all, so I wanted to do my own protecting." Tony blushes. ”Okay, that doesn't really make sense, but you both know what I mean."
The hug lasts half a minute longer, Tony squeezing Jarvis tight before finally letting go. He doesn’t say anything else, just holds Jarvis’s gaze before turning and dashing to the door.
Unable to let him continue doubting himself, Natasha leaves the window and moves into his path. “Anthony. Look at me.”
Time freezes and it’s as if the breath has been stolen from his lungs. Steve’s touch is so soft, almost barely there, but Tony is already craving more. He wants to know what those fingers would feel like on his chest, his stomach, and...Tony clears his throat and turns his head, dislodging Steve’s fingers.
He’d just settled into one of the larger tubs and was resting his eyes for a few minutes when he hears his name being called.
There’s a hand on his elbow guiding him down and Tony lets himself sink onto the pillow Steve has left for him. Once he’s comfortable, he bows his head and waits.
It’s just as Bucky had said and Steve’s heart feels full. “I love you so much, sweetheart. Can we try something?” Tony nods and Steve breathes deep to calm his nerves. “I want to kiss you. On the lips.”
Steve’s smile brightens and Tony feels a familiar fluttering in his stomach. This smile is one of his favorites. Whenever Tony sees it, it’s as though Steve’s whole being seems to brighten and be lighter. The first time Steve smiled that way at Tony, he’d almost walked into a door.
Lifting Peter from the crib, Steve settles him in his arms and pops the nipple in Peter’s mouth. “Should we go find daddy? I’m sure he’s waiting up just so he can see you.”
“That everyone knows about you and Tony having a private dinner last night?” Sam asks, appearing on Steve’s other side.
The queen watched from the doorway; heart in her throat, fearing Margaret would tell her her son would not live to see his first birthday. Steven was strong, she knew he was, even if he didn’t look it.
Tony scrapes his teeth over Steve’s fingers before going over the spot with his tongue. Steve chuckles and backs off Tony’s cock.
Steve buckles the collar around Tony’s neck and circles his shield inlaid into the leather. “Who do you belong to?”
Steve stands and pours himself another glass of whiskey. He holds out the bottle so Bucky can see. “More?”
Another thing that had been very clear when Tony arrived was that Steve did not expect any sort of favors from his harem. He wanted them to be happy and he would do whatever he could to ensure they were. When his best friend, Bucky, had formed an attachment with two people in the harem, Steve had embraced them and made sure they had their own suite for some privacy. Carol had also begun a relationship of her own with Tony’s guard, Rhodey and when they had gone to Steve to tell him, he had wished them well and let Carol move into Rhodey’s quarters.
“I remember that last time Rhodey came to fetch you.” Clint gets out of the bath before Tony can make a grab for him. “Didn’t that end with you over his shoulder?”
“His royal highness did seem to think that would be the case.” He looks at the cravat in his hand and decides Tony does not need it. A picnic is not a formal occasion after all.
Kissing along Tony’s jaw, Steve lifts him and lets him drop back onto his cock. “That’s right, baby. You’re mine. All mine. My baby. My sweetheart. My Tony.”
“Handsome as ever, sir.” Taking a step back, Jarvis studies his charge. There is something about the outfit that is not sitting right with him. “Wait. Come here.”
They are getting to the hallway when Fury’s voice sounds again in the comms, an urgent to it that stops Tasha in her feet
Yet what the artist finds to be the most endearing thing about the little genius are her eyes. They are huge and very expressive, they have a color that resembles chocolate, Steve wouldn’t mind to lose himself in those. Especially when she beams at him as she did back in the debrief room, she was just so adorable, she provokes a protective streak within the soldier.
“Well, of course, Stark's work is unparallel, but, Ms. Hansen my organization’s been tracking your research since year two of MIT” he says while Tash pulls Maya to the elevator with her
That man was Clint Barton, also known as Hawkeye. Tasha helped him of course and even gave him new arrows in exchange for an explanation of why and how he managed to get inside the house.
“Ok so better tell me, are there bad guys in Rose Hill?... Do you need a plastic bag to breathe into?.... Do you have medication?” Tasha moves her head negatively, her breathing speeds and the kid’s voice sounds far in the distant, leaving her only with the sensation of her trembling arms and her need for oxygen because she is in her suit again and she’s off on the space and she can’t breathe and her suit is plumbing and the aliens... oh god the entire armada... she takes a deep breath and tries to keep it so she can regulate herself... it doesn’t work “Don’t you need to be on it?” Harley's voice comes back to her
“Yes, I can see how well you are getting along with him” is Rhodey's turn to appear skeptical, prompting Tasha to send him a look “Hey I’m just saying what I, and everybody else for that matter, see, and you two are disgustingly sweet and domestic together”
“Don’t get into trouble Happy, or then Pepper is definitely going to be mad at you” she takes a white wine bottle, thinking if Steve would like it, she looks at her friend with melancholic “I miss you Happy”
“Is that what you want?” she snarls, all the cameras go wild. She was doing such a good job of controlling herself, for Happy, for Pepper, for Rhodey, for the rest of her family... but she had enough, she’s tired of all of this, she didn’t fly a nuke through a wormhole so any idiot could come and hurt her family, her PTSD isn't for nothing dammit!. She didn’t take any alien bullshit, hell she won’t take any shit from any fucking wannabe terrorist “Here’s a little holiday greeting I’ve been wanting to send to the Mandarin, I didn’t before out of respect to all the effort our government is putting to catch him, but now... If you think you can hurt my employee for free you are wrong. My name is Natasha Stark and I’m not afraid of you, I know you’re a coward, so I’ve decided...” she takes off her glasses and all but glares at the reporter, venom dripping in every word “That you just died, pal. I’m gonna come to get the body. Don’t even try to underestimate me, cause you’ll regret it. There’s no politics here, it’s just good old-fashioned revenge. There’s no Pentagon, not even Iron Man... it’s just you and me, and on the off chance you’re a man, here’s my home address: 10880 Malibu Point 90265” she has a predatory smirk that only her most hated business rivals and enemies had seen, the 'Death Grin' some used to call it “I’ll leave the door unlocked” she takes the reporter's smartphone “That’s what you wanted right?” then she proceeds to throw it against a wall, some of the people there, gasps, she just smiles fakely at him and with a simple “Bill me” she disappears inside of her car
“I’m teasing Steve, of course you now are going to have your own fan club” there was a glint in her eyes he couldn’t ignore “I do hope you are prepared for all the fangirls" she chuckles, he's at loss just imagining the nightmare that would be, it's not like he doesn't appreciate it, he does, but he just wants to help people, no the recognition that comes with it "I was going to look at some of the footage of the battle with a good bottle of scotch if you want to stay” her ‘
Tasha raises an eyebrow a smug expression in her features, Steve looks at her sheepishly, he's definitely not used to fame
"Should we tell them that we are leaving?" Clint whispers to Nat, she takes a look to the oblivious lovebirds
“Yeah, okay, about that, it tested well with focus groups all right? People like that name” she raises an eyebrow
“You are a tin, I mean, your helmet is a tin can, kind of a shell really, so.... shellhead” that prompted a good laugh out of the young Stark
The battle begins, Tasha is rooming through the buildings, destroying the strays Clint points out and making the Leviathans follow her. With all the adrenaline, her senses intensify, she can hear the Hulk roar and jumping from building to building, smashing aliens, she can hear the thunders Thor sends to the portal and the destruction this causes, killing and exploding both Chitauri soldiers and monsters. She can hear the others in the comms, deciding to let them open so not to waste time or movements on it
“I’m most definitely not back to screwing around” she coffs a few times more “But it’s not my fault my bed gets cold at night okay? If I could find someone nice to settle down with, trust me, I would” she briefly glances at Steve, but he doesn’t take any notice as he continues to torture himself with images of Tasha with another person cuddling or hugging or kissing or....his mussing are interrupted by Nat’s voice
“Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won’t re-engage without a jump, I'm gonna have to get in there and push” Steve heart stops for a second
“Me and Nat if necessary, right Nat?” she turns to the Black Widow who is watching them from the doorframe
“Close it” he says quietly, biting his tongue to not call off the order, her sacrifice would be pointless if they get killed by the radiation slipping through the black portal, he knows Romanov follows it as he sees the portal close quickly, he hears a choked sound and can only imagine it comes from Clint, but in all honesty, it could come from any of them.
“I’m not a teenager Cap” she says quite frustrated, ignoring the fact that she does, actually, do stupid and reckless things most of the time and proceeds to blast another rider “But whatever, enough of my very legal age, birdbrain, what else you’ve got for me?”
for the next series I'll do Iron Man 3 with tiny Tasha and Steve, also there's going to be special changes on that one besides the obvious ones, (of course it would be much easier if I actually manage to find the script ¬¬)
“Oh, you mean Sir Laurence Oblivier? Yeah, quite a contrast actually, just the perfect individual for you to manipulate as much as you want” she deadpans
“You are right and my first order as your superior is to go home and be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stayed connected to the telephone so you better pick up when I call you okay? You are going to be my trust-worthy guy on the chair” she smiles satisfied with herself “Feel that sense of freedom? We‘re done here, no more bad guys in Rose-Hill, good job sidekick” she pats his shoulder and gets inside the car “Bye kid” she closes the door and turns on the engine. She downs her window and winks “You did good kid, I’ll send you my number so you can call me when you’re older, I can get you an R&D job if you are interested”
“Not even toothpaste?” she returns smirking and the doctor finds himself laughing, the action is contagious and Steve smiles as well “You know, you should come to STARK Tower sometime, top ten floors, all R&D, you’d love it, it’s candy land” she eats a blueberry from a little bag “I don’t really have someone to play with anymore who is nearly as fun as you” she tilts her head and lets a bit of her puppy eyes to show, she really wants Bruce to spent time in her labs, the research and discoverments they could make, and when they get Selvig back it'll be more fun
“Slow down the suction will you?” he asks his scientists “I want him alive for a round of experiments” Alrich then turns to Cap “Look... Tasha is not... she...” he looks down as if he has a hard time choosing the words “She is special alright? And you know that better than anybody... and you should be proud because after the experiments we are going to perform on you... that serum, that perfected EXTREMIS? She is going to have it”
“Why don’t we let the guy blow off some steam? I’d love to meet our other member” Tasha says with a grin, Steve looks at her as if she had grown another head
When they land in the Helicarrier Steve meets Agent Romanov and Dr. Banner, for a first impression, he thinks Banner looks like a swell guy despite his initial wariness, he doesn't know what to make of Agent Romanov though, she looks like she could kill you in any way possible while being elegant about it, he is not wrong. After they get inside, the Hellicarrier starts to fly and to reflect the sky, making it invisible at sight. Reluctantly, Steve turns to Fury (who has the smuggest smile in the world) and pays up. Sitwell informs them that Loki is in Germany, not exactly hiding and Steve proceeds to suit up.
“Ugh, you just try to keep them off the streets" she whines prompting a fond grin of the archer, it’s the first time they fight together and he is enjoying it immensely
Her story with the spies is a funny one: after the one night only deal she got with the red-head, Romanov admitted that Tasha was something close to a little sister and that she reminded the spy of herself when she was still in the red room, hence the indulging Stark in her lust. Toni was surprisingly good with that and her crush evolved into something platonic, more like the thing she had with Rhodes and Pepper. So, Tasha stopped seeing agent Romanov when she left for her other missions, that’s why she was so surprised and pretty freaked out when, not long after her 19th birthday, a man dropped from her ceiling, injured and claiming to be with SHIELD and knowing Nat.
“I’m the best” she smugly says before an armor piece ricochets to her back, knocking her down and dislodging her new suit. She groans
“Bella bear, I need you to look at me,” Tony said softly, putting a hand on her back to try and get her attention.
“Okay, I’ll make you a deal.” Isabel turned to look at him as the words left his mouth, though she looked suspicious.
“Are you sure? Here, how about I go start in the kitchen and you two can get all this wrapping paper and stuff out of the living room. And break.” Natasha hustled off to the kitchen before Steve could protest, who just rolled his eyes and gave in.
They continued to talk, brainstorming things that Steve could do, before everyone turned in for the night, but at least a plan was set in place. Steve always worked better with a plan.
“Daddy,” Isabel started, “Ms. May said we were going to get to go ice skating tonight. Are we really?”
“A) that’s not what we asked, b) not convincing, and c) the way you are acting does not make me feel like I can relax. So I will ask again, where are they?”
“I think the media should learn to mind their own fucking business,” Steve said harshly, though making silly faces at the giggly Peter.
There was no way of that being possible, but that didn't stop Steve from trying. It was late at night, late enough that everyone else was asleep, when Steve was sitting in the living room, thinking of how and when to ask Tony out. As he did so, he also sketched Tony, reminding himself of how much he loved Tony's soft brown eyes and adorable nose and chiseled jaw a-
“I don’t think that’s possible,” Steve said as Tony started to head out, earning him a laugh from everyone, and slap on the ass from Tony.
Which actually wasn’t true, Tony knew exactly it had happened. Being friends with benefits made it kind of hard to not end up in bed with Steve.
“Hey, guys. How was the trip?” Peter asked, having already turned back around to the wall of sticky notes.
“I really don’t like the idea of the whole world having access to pictures of Peter. He’s our son, not the rest of the world’s,” Steve said firmly.
“We will always be your family first and foremost. You aren’t going to lose us just by sharing us with others,” Tony reassured.
“Friends with benefits never lasts Steve.” And Tony could cry as he watched Steve’s face crumble before his eyes.
“It wasn’t supposed too. It was just to make sure you knew I’m promising adult food and not mac and cheese or pizza. And it’s snowing! You should be layering up anyway.”
“Why? You worried he’s gonna steal me from you?” Tony said cheekily as he finished his coffee. Steve glared at him, obviously not finding the joke funny, to which Tony sighed.
“My mom taught me how to do it when I was little. That was always my job when I was helping her wrap gifts.”
“Hey, guys!” Steve said, squatting low so that they could run into his arms and he could hug them all. It may have only been a few hours since he last saw them, but he was still riding the high of a nice dinner with Tony, and the kids being around only added to that.
“Hey kiddo,” Tony said, walking over to Peter, combing his hand through his son’s hair. “How are you feeling?”
The only thing about the future that was better than the food, Steve thought, was Tony Stark. Tony Stark, whose eyes always shone so bright that it rivaled the arc reactor in his chest. Tony Stark, whose brain was almost universally unrivaled. Tony Stark, who had the biggest heart of anyone Steve had ever met and could bring a smile to anyone's face. Tony Stark, who barely seemed to acknowledge Steve’s existence.
Tony was supposed to go out with Rhodey and Pepper the night before. He had made it out with them even, but he got a text around 9:30 pm from Steve, asking if he wanted to come over. Normally, Tony has been trying to convince himself, he’d have said no and continue to spend time with his friends. But Steve had just gotten back from a week- long mission earlier that day, and Tony missed him.
“So it didn’t take you two hours to wrap no presents, it took you two hours to wrap 6. Still not a great ratio.”
When Steve finally pulled the reactor out, Tony let out a blood-curdling scream that caused Steve to flinch, putting the arc reactor on the coffee table in front of the couch.
“You guys will appreciate this 20 years down the line, I promise you.” She explained, wrapping up the video and then walking away, making both Tony and Steve laugh. Then Tony turned to Steve, kissing him on the cheek.
“Matt? Did you grab my scarf instead of your scarf?” Steve asked, not in accusatory way, but rather curious. Matt quickly nodded.
As they were eating though, even with the heat lamps, Steve noticed that Tony seemed to be shivering a bit. He was pulled in tight to Steve, but that still didn’t take away from how much Tony was trying to stay as curled up as possible. Steve rolled his eyes, knowing his husbands was probably freezing and just not saying anything. Without a word, Steve put his fork down and started to undo his scarf a bit. He moved it to Tony’s neck, but as he started to wrap it around Tony, the scarf fell off of Steve’s neck as well. He tried for another moment, to get the scarf to stay on both of them at the same time, but to no avail.
"Slipped my mind, I guess. I got excited about the idea after a youtube video I watched this morning." Tony was laughing again.
"Okay so maybe I wasn't completely sure I had connected the dots yet." When Steve didn't say anything, Tony continued. "I may have been harassing Natasha to see if she knew anything, but she wouldn't say anything except ‘why don't you ask him yourself' until yesterday when she got frustrated and said 'you fuckers are both so thick. The dumbasses are perfect for each other' in Russian when I asked her again. JARVIS translated and I figured it out."
Now, hours later, Tony was lying in Steve’s bed, thinking about his dilemma. Thinking about the easiest way to break things off.
“I’m here! I’m ready! Let’s go,” Tony said as he came down the hall, pulling Steve into the elevator as he walked in. Silence in the elevator didn’t last, as they only made it 3 floors down before Tony spoke up again.
“That makes sense. Christmas might be a nice distraction from everything else this year. Focus on us this holiday season.”
"Well, it's a pretty easy fix; It either just needs a jump start, or a new battery, but I'm pretty sure I have one that would work for your bike. I can get it done within the hour."
There was a park bench facing a large frozen pond, with a table set in front of it. There was a small canopy over the bench and table, along with a patio heater on either end of the bench, keeping the snow away from where they will be, without taking away the magic of having it around. When Steve moved closer to the table, he saw two places set on the bench, for the couple to sit next to each other instead of across, with a candle lit and food set out for the both of them. A large bouquet of roses was the final touch to the table, as well as other flowers on the edges of the bench that wasn’t covered by the canopy. There was some light music playing from some speakers that Steve wasn’t sure of where it was coming from, but he didn’t question is either. As he was looking at the beautiful setup, he felt a set of arms wrap around his waist and a kiss that was set on his back.
"Good. Now where do you want to go? If you're not too tired, now might be a good time to go, so we can keep it a secret from the rest of the team."
“Not really though. Both are super dangerous and could kill him. I’m not saying the Spiderman stuff is negating what happened last night; it actually makes me more worried,” Steve mumbled into his coffee, causing Tony to sit up a bit straighter, eyes widening.
“Wasn’t a question kiddo. Matt said you two weren’t taking any breaks, so now we’re making you take one. Besides, it’s not healthy or useful to study without any breaks.”
“Then both of you have a good amount more time to study, so you guys are going to leave the study materials, and you’re going to take a break, and we’ll eat lunch and watch a movie and then you can both come back to studying before bed.” Peter still didn’t seem convinced by Steve’s words, so he continued.
“First of all, you’re cold and I can tell, so don’t say that. Second, it’s just weird because usually they are long enough to cover two people. I do it with the kids all the time.”
Because Steve had not grown up with a lot of options in terms of food, cooking was never really Steve’s forte. However, a few nights ago he heard Tony mention how much he loved sushi, and Steve decided he was going to use this to his advantage. Steve was able to rope Sam, the tower's best cook, into helping him get all the ingredients and help with all of the prep.
“Really? I couldn’t tell by how willing you’ve been to let Peter and I be with other people,” Tony said, more with concern than actual bite. Steve sagged a bit at what Tony was saying, knowing he was right.
“I’m fine,” Tony responded, though Steve knew he was lying as he sat up straight on the couch, feet now on the floor instead of on the couch, obviously trying to work on his breathing. Steve got up and crouched in front of Tony.
The elevator finally dinged, and they walked out and into the penthouse. It was quiet, and no one was there to welcome them. Not that Tony was expecting it or anything. He was about to ask Friday where they were when they saw Matt bounding down the hallway, looking slightly out of breath.
And... he made it worse. Maybe the universe would be nice to him and just swallow him into the earth right now.
Tony sighed but walked over to the tree to see the tiny wrapped square under the tree. Grabbing it, he looked at the name on the paper.
“Fuck off Rogers,” he said, leaving Steve looking dumbfound and completely confused in the living room.
“I think that’s a little extreme…” Tony said, getting up and walking to the sink, dumping his barely touched coffee down the sink drain. He rubbed his chest as he refused to look at Steve, obviously concerned.
Tony had opened the door and was about to walk out when he felt someone grab his hand. He turned to see Steve’s face, narrowed eyes and a deep frown.
"Do you want to go on a ride with me?" Steve blurted out. Tony looked a bit confused and taken aback, so Steve had to recover quickly.
“Is this what you guys were doing that was so important, you couldn’t come out and say hi to us after we were gone for three days?” Steve asked, finally getting their attention.
"Yeah, that sounds good. Just give me a few minutes to go get my jacket." Tony walked out of the lab, and Steve had to control himself in not shouting with excitement at the win.
“That’s good thinking buddy, I’m proud of you.” Steve said, “Now why don’t you go lay down on the couch. We’ll go get Peter and Isabel and everyone can have a break while we watch a movie together and eat a late lunch.”
