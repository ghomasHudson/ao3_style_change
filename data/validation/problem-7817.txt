to Tony Stark." I practically growl, all the emotions from when he cheated on me bubbling back to the surface.
"Steve- hey you uh- you look good." he says, his eyes going wide in surprise.
"I liked you, but at the time I was thinking you were Steve so I was telling myself I was just sympathising for Steve with the whole Tony crap." He tells me, coming to lean next to me.
but, I dunno, he seems hesitant maybe." I mutter, leaning back again. Suddenly the avengers alarm begins to beep, making us both jump into action.
"We never said that, and I can think that, because why would he?" I say, my hands shaking slightly.
"will do. see you when you get back."
"I was in a house full of Avengers. that is mildly intimidating." I laugh. "there isn't anything going on between Cap and me by the way. I mean he does lean in that direction, but he's like my brother, it would be weird."
"thats hard to do when your slightly sociopathic friend is attacking you with a pencil!" I shout back, sitting up when she climbs off me.
"yeah okay, i'll be back in a minute then." He says, making his way towards the door.
"well only because you asked so nicely." I say with a grin, pulling him in for a side hug before I can think about it. oh well. We were quite hands on friends, wow that sounded weird, I just mean that we were usually touching if we were near each other. Now theres an odd tenseness to stuff, maybe its just in my head I don't know.
"I'm sorry that I hurt you." He calls after me, making me stop in my tracks and turn to face him again.
"what did they say?" I ask, nodding to the door.
"So you are the friend of Captain America." He says, walking up to me.
"well you can't blame me - people weren't interested in me when I was all gross and skinny, then I got the serum but you know, the war and stuff so I didn't get much of a chance to get close to people." I say, blushing slightly again.
"I'm really not sure. I mean obviously Natasha is trying to set us up, I mean I got that just from the naked photo that Nat showed iron man, but I wanted to hear what you wanted." He says, honestly quite surprised from how far this Tony is from the one from the tabloids, which makes me kick myself a little. of course the tabloids only show a slither of Tony, and I know that. I splutter at the mention of a naked photo, very nearly spitting my beer all over Tony. that would've REALLY killed the mood.
"what you drive in circles until your friend starts to feel bad?" he laughs, raising an eyebrow at me. I just shrug, suddenly more interested in the small dimples that appear when he smiles just right.
"you uh- you have an arc reactor in you too?" I ask him, pointing to his chest.
"I still have no clue what you are trying to tell me." I laugh, trying to pull him away from the whole death thing.
"Its no problem. I'll let you go and get settled." he tells me, before heading back towards his room. The next few weeks go much the same, I mainly stay in my room apart from early in the morning or late at night. we go on a few missions, but its always quite tense, and Iron Man and I always seem to be clashing.
"Steve, help me get the plates out?" Nat says quietly, walking towards the kitchen. I follow her after a second, reaching up to grab the plates.
"Iron Man?" I ask quietly as I come to, trying to make out anything in the pitch black room.
"how are we meant to do that and lift him?"
"Clint I'd like you to try it with a full balaclava on, and also I need to have a chat with your parents if you think that old people call eachother
"what?" I ask, turning to face him.
"we've got trouble down on 17th. you still nearby?" he asks, sounding out of breath.
"oh my god, so are you." I say, standing up to quickly stand in front of him. "god, why didn't you just come see me?"
"Its just the mission. theres some hydra thug that keeps stopping us in our tracks. the guy is totally teenage heartthrob, apart from his tendency to kill people." Tony tells me, making jokes to cover up his worry. Tony has visited a few times since I've left, mostly just stopping by to chat. its surprisingly easy to have a conversation with him, given our history.
I ask, my mouth falling open.
"ah my hero." He moans, taking a sip of the hot liquid.
I spend most of the evening in the corner, watching the madness of the party unfold. I know that sounds kind of lonely, but it was actually really nice. I'd normally be out there, flashing my best Captain America smile, talking to all the government officials and having to look
"yeah, but I just opened my eyes to see a dinosaur bite someones head off." I whisper back, smiling up at him, causing him to burst out laughing.
I just sit there quietly, really unsure of what to do. I was not expecting to see Tony tonight, I just assumed he would be ignoring me.
"oh- uh yeah Steve." I stutter out, giving her a death glare.
"brilliant, thanks tones." she responds, a loose smile still playing at her lips.
"yes, he is ready for you in the basement." He tells me, the door clicking open.
"oh hi Stevie." Nat says, wandering out of the bathroom and sitting down next to Clint on her bed.
"oh just the person actually.. tada!" he says, holding out my hood with a grin. I laugh, taking the hood and slipping into the spare room to put it on.
"wha-
"Fuck." I mutter as I fall down onto my bed, chucking my mask towards my cabernet.
"He reacted badly?" He asks, looking up at me.
"we have to keep pressure on the wound."
"the whole best friend thing? I don't know, it would be what I would go for."
I just laugh, running my hands down his side to make him squirm.
"hi." I say, glad my voice didn't break.
"I don't think so, he's really happy with his not-quite-a-boyfriend he keeps going on about - but he said that Mr America seemed more relaxed, more chatty around him." Tony says, smiling gently.
"feel free to call me Tony." He says, gesturing me to follow him into a separate room.
"I really like you, and I want something to happen between us, and I regret letting us stop it from happening." He says quickly after a moment.
I wake up and instantly notice the bright lights behind my eyelids, the beeping of machines around me, a hard, lumpy bed beneath my back.
"25 year old supersoldier born in 1918? yup." I say, leaning back against one of the chairs.
"wha- Nat-" I protest, watching as she lowers the pencil down. she gently runs it along my eyelids, smudging it a little with her finger.
"is this you trying to tell me that you're actually Tony?" I ask, with a grin, trying to pull him away from the whole Steve thing. this is wayyy too close for any sort of comfort.
"okay, fine. one chance." I agree, before getting into my car and driving off. I can already feel that I'm going to regret this. I can't say I know much about Tony Stark, but from what I've heard, hes an obnoxious womaniser, and definitely not the sort of person I'd be interested in. anyway, a promise is a promise, and that is how I ended up with Natasha in my passenger seat, on my way to a bar.
"yeah- thats why I hadn't visited earlier. I was trying to figure out how to explain. my mind was so blank I've ended up going with Clint's idea." I say, looking down and taking a seat on the corner of his bed.
"yep. awake and wanting to know who I am." I sigh, running my hands over my face.
"hey Nat." I say, wandering into our room the next morning and stopping dead when I see a man in Nat's bed.
"I can only stitch you up so many times, idiot." She sighs, rolling her eyes at me.
"and you know that doesn't mean you don't still love him, right?" She mocks.
"just calm down, okay? lets go and have some food, then maybe he'll be ready to talk." She says, wrapping her arm around my shoulders.
"you're right, I probably wouldn't have. I'm maybe being a little reckless, I just went through a bit of a bad breakup." I tell him.
"okay. you ready?" I say, grinning at his confused expression. I pick them up like I did in so many shows on the star spangled tour, before doing a pirouette and putting them back on the ground.
"could you maybe have told me that Agent Coulson was in my apartment?" I ask while I change, Natasha still laughing on my sofa.
"I don't know, tell Tony?" She offers, raising her eyebrows.
"we're going to need to shut our eyes." I say quietly to Iron Man, remembering my lack of mask.
"do you think Cap likes Iron Man, you know, like
I chuckle, hanging up the phone.
"I think I would rather stay at my apartment. its a 2 minute walk from Tony's, and I wouldn't have to wear a metal suit all day." Iron Man says, him seeming more serious and a lot less chatty than normal.
"I just wanted to complain about the fact that I have to go in today." He moans, running his hands over his face.
"Good to finally meet you, Captain." Bruce says, holding his hand out. "I watched the clips of you fighting - I honestly wouldn't be able to tell the difference between you and the original Captain." he says, smiling as I shake his hand.
"you weren't being stupid, you were telling me how you feel." he says, the bed dipping at my feet. "I mean you know me, thats more than I'd ever be able to do." he laughs, causing me to slowly sit up, bringing my knees to my chest.
"not what I meant." he replies as he quickly flips over to straddle my hips, our bodies pressed together. "I meant," his fingers work theirÂ  way under my shirt, exploring my chest. "why did you stop?" He smashes his lips against mine with similar urgency to that in the lift, my fingers automatically falling to his hips, holding him in place as he presses harder into the kiss.
"normal suit with your helmet. also you should bring a date, most people do to this kind of thing." He tells me, smiling slightly.
"Jeez, you think Stark is even good enough for that gorgeous lump of muscle?" Iron Man's robotic voice asks, taking Natasha's phone. Natasha laughs, and just when she's about to reply, Nick Fury walks in so Iron Man walks back to his seat.
"okay so I have literally no games, so lets play truth or dare." he tells me with a grin, sitting cross legged on his bed before patting the place in front of him. I just grin, folding my legs underneath myself.
"who woulda guesses - Captain America is caring as fuck." He says, leaning back against a work surface.
"yeah thats the real mystery here." I laugh, leaning back against the glass.
"Thanks, Pepper." I say, kicking my bike to life and roaring off.
" I sass back, pulling my hood off and putting it down on my bed.
"really? a haircut completely changed your appearance?" He asks, raising his eyebrows in doubt.
"Tony Stark." He replies, holding out his hand. I shake it, laughing at him.
"okay. I'm just going to nip to the loo." Tony says, walking off.
"ah, he's probably right. mind if I just leave this here for him? I've got all the measurements I need from it." He says, holding up my hood.
"I dare you to play knock and run on Natasha." He says with an evil grin. I sigh, getting up and walking quietly towards Nat's door, knocking sharply before running for the elevator and closing the door. I hear Natasha open her door, but then nothing else which makes me slightly nervous. I decide to climb up above the elevator, which I'm glad I did as the doors open after a second. Nat just stands there for a minute, before looking directly at me.
"No, just mustering the courage for coffee." he tells me, so I slide Tony's in front of him and put another on.
"Your door was literally unlocked. I opened your door and just walked in. you're a mess, Rogers." She teases, only looking up from her phone to give me a side eye.
"Look Tony, I'm sure Natasha explained but you know me. the real me." I say after a moment, looking down at my hands.
"I can after you tell him who you are." she says, raising an eyebrow at me.
"oh yeah. my walls were lined with his posters- wait this feels like a really dumb question but what
"Thanks" I say, walking through the door and down the stairs.
"thats what- what I was trying to say earlier, you know, death truths and what not." He continues, his voice strained.
"we're being called in." I shout, grabbing my uniform and quickly slipping into it. "how did you get here?"
"maybe he's just not a very interesting guy?" I offer, still refusing to believe that Clint is Hawkeye. I mean, come on.
"you're the best." Tony tells me, planting a kiss on my cheek before flopping downÂ  on the sofa, making me blush. "didn't you say Cap was meant to be back tonight?"
"fine. but you better get here in the next couple days to check in. We've found something big, and we need you to check it out." He tells me before hanging up. I sigh, wrapping a towel around my waist and exiting the bathroom. I've been living a great life since I left - theres only been a few missions that I've been called out on, meaning I've been able to spend a lot of time getting back into my old routine. I quickly change, before heading over to the shop to buy some more bread. I make it back in good time, placing my keys in their bowl before stopping still when I hear a noise come from my bedroom. I quickly run across the room, grabbing my shield before standing with my back against the wall. I hear the noise again, this time closer to the door so I throw my shield around the corner, hearing something metal clink against the floor.
"so this is about living arrangements. after the whole unicorn thing, we realised just how lucky we were that Cap was still in the area, which brings me to why you're here Tony." Fury tells up, raising his eyebrows at Tony.
"must be a lot to live up to." he says, meeting my eyes.
"hey Nat. also, what do you mean? you can't get STD's?" Tony asks, looking very confused about the whole situation.
"god you two have gone straight to old married couple." Clint whines into the coms, making us both laugh.
"I've messaged Iron Man, but he's probably in a meeting. we can't count on him." Clint says as we get onto the plane, the door closing behind us.
"Steve wait- I was in a bad place back then and I loathe myself for hurting you. please, just give me a chance?" He asks, standing up and instantly losing his balance. I catch him and steer him back towards the bed, gently pushing him down.
"any chance you want to come to central New York and pretend to be a multi millionaire?" He asks, his voice muffled slightly.
"because of me?" I say, causing him to sigh.
"but you didn't." I say, turning to face him.
"my god how on earth has he not noticed yet." He laughs, shaking his head.
"we are both idiots." he says, letting out a high pitched laugh.
"and if I hadn't come after you, then you would have died and we would have lost him anyway! you're not a super soldier Captain, stop acting like one!"
"well maybe the old Tony. anyways, whats wrong with playing around a bit while searching for someone who you actually want to date?" He says, looking down at his menu again, before closing it as the girl returns to our table.
"the secret is yoga." I say dryly, sending him a smile.
"he's unconscious and bleeding, we're going to need you to carry him so we can keep pressure on his wound." she says, a pained expression on her face.
"how do you even know what time I'm meant to be getting here?" I ask, standing to stretch out my body, before running my hand through my hair in an attempt to flatten it.
"what happened?" Nat asks, sighing as she sits up.
"I am, Steve has gone for a jog, so I'm off to spar with Iron Man." Clint throws me a confused look, causing Natasha to bust out laughing.
"its no problem, I just hardly ever talk about him. For me it was what? about a year and a half since he died I think? maybe less? I'm not too sure. anyways, the only person I ever really talked to about it was Peggy, so its sort of a double hit." I say, smiling up at him.
Iron Man is dating Cap. Its way easier to face him as Iron Man." I explain with a moan. suddenly my phone starts buzzing, so I fish it out of my pocket and answer.
"Its really not that impressive." he tells me, busying himself by pulling the dunce hat off butterfingers. I just roll my eyes, knowing full well that trying to get Tony to accept that anything he does is good is a losing battle.
"yeah chugged a bottle of wine. its starting to wear off now anyway." I sigh, sitting up. "so to what do I owe this pleasure?"
"see? eyeliner always works." Nat says, smiling at me when the doors shut.
"you're just going to run from Brooklyn? also hydra." Clint explains, causing me to roll my eyes.
Iron Man stops the video, zooming in on the man.
"Natasha you're such an asshole." I say, glaring at her.
"yep. thats movie logic for ya." he says, shaking his head at the TV. "by the way, you're phone keeps buzzing."
"staring rather hard there, sweetheart." Tony says, and I look up to see a smirk dancing over his mouth.
"Steve! I just heard, I'm so sorry, He's such an idiot." Pepper says, running up to me.
"I like what you've done with your hair, by the way." Nat comments, running her fingers along the now shaved sides.
"so you're planning to be there as Cap, then to arrive as Steve tomorrow?" she carries on, laughing at my stupidity.
"Are you-
"No it wasn't me you had the one night stand with." I snap, looking up at him and watching as his face goes blank. "oh shit I'm sorry I- I didn't mean- yeah, I'm an asshole." I mutter, running a hand over my face.
"well, in most of the posters I had my helmet on, and the rest I had about 10 meters of makeup on." I laugh, sitting back against the wall.
"oh yeah he told me about the whole unicorn thing." I pull off my sweats before pulling on my jeans.
"what happened to the soft, empathetic Natasha?" I ask, my voice muffled.
"fuck." I stutter when he breaks away, his hands quickly pulling off my shirt before working on his own. his hands return to my chest when I pull him back into the kiss, mine freely exploring his back. his hands slowly slip down and begin on my jeans, before my hands stop his.
"I'd gone so long.." He mutters, sniffing lightly. "gah, okay we've talked about my problems too much for one friendship. hows Steve?" He asks, standing straighter and wiping his eyes.
"why thank you kind captain, now would you mind helping me get my arms out of this damn suit?" he asks, holding out his arms. IÂ  smile, taking hold of the zip on his outfit.
"I'm a super soldier, I'm fine." I laugh, running a hand through my hair.
"yeah thats a hard one." she laughs, flopping down onto her bed.
"uh- yeah I'm not really feeling it tonight, I guess." He tells me, stuttering slightly. "you should dress up more often. I'm also a fan of the eyeliner." I throw him a joking wink.
"gah Captain, are you saying Mr America
"you know you really shouldn't do that" I tell Tony with a smile as we sit down.
"well of course, sweetheart." he says with a smile, placing a dramatic kiss on my cheek through the fabric of the balaclava. I smile a little as he walks off, biting back a blush unsuccessfully. After a second I make my way into the kitchen, flicking the kettle on before putting a mug in the coffee machine Tony bought me after complaining about the instant coffee I have in the cupboard. I quickly gather up the bottles from last night too, knowing Iron Man has a problem that I really don't want to trigger after last night. Iron Man walks back in a few minutes later, wearing just a towel and his balaclava. I chuckle lightly at the sight, shaking my head.
but they're all so scared of her that they wouldn't spread my secret, so its just easier for me to tell them.
"So you're actually, properly attracted to me, or were you just saying that at the time?" He asks, as the doors shut, leaning against the railing.
"oh yeah. we had all the sex" Tony answers with a smirk, placing his coffee down to wrap his arm around my waist.
"aww no now you're making the poor captain blush" She says, her eyebrows furrowing at my panicked look before following with her own. "sorry, just a joke I like to make because of his name and greek god muscles."
"Nat got me this - said she was going to bully you into coming." He laughs slightly, wincing at the movement in his chest.
"I'm sorry Steve, but his mask is going to come off, and he wouldn't want it to happen in this way." She quickly explains.
"Tony hang on, I just wanna talk, I'm not blaming you for anything." I say, watching as he slams back his drink, before grabbing his jacket.
"Hey Steve, sorry I'm late back, meeting ran over." Tony says as I walk around the corner, him untucking his shirt and pulling off his tie. a surprised grin falls onto his face when he sees me in just my towel.
"eh I'm not scared. you can't show Tony without telling him who I am." I say, grinning at her before digging through my drawers.
"why thank you. you look pretty hot yourself." She jokes, swatting my ass. I blush at that, turning to scowl at her. "you know for a gay guy, you blush a lot at my straight jokes."
"so I heard." he mutters, shutting his eye again. "me too, by the way, kinda. I wasn't expecting him to like me in that way, we're just friends, but it seems like there might be something there."
"okay just- yeah you're just going to have to pull-" Iron Man tells me while wincing, both of us trying to get the damaged plates off of his suit. Turns out the unicorn ripped through part of the disassembly mechanisms in his suit, meaning we're having to try and pull already dented scraps of metal off the suit, when there's a bunch of things working to stop this from happening.
"I do not need to tell him. I owe
"great, apart from the gaping hole in my shoulder." He jokes.
"yeah no Clint you're going to drop him."
"whatcha up to?" he asks casually, clearly not having noticed what I said.
"Yeah and skipped the young love part." Nat jokes, causing me to glare at her.
"hey." I say with a smile, walking in.
"I had time, also I can handle myself. anyways, the only thing you coming after meÂ  managed to do was get us both stuck!" I say back, hearing some shifting from the other side of the room. The reason we got called in was because of some acid spitting aliens. I saw a basement and wanted to check for civilians before the whole building went down, which is how I have ended up in a semi collapsed basement with Iron Man. I find the light I keep strapped to my belt, flicking it on before throwing it to the centre of the room. I easily lift the piece of wood pinning my leg down, before making my way towards Iron Man. Most of his suit got disintegrated by the acid, the rest of it hanging off him.
"It may not have occurred to you, but I was saving your ass!" Iron Man shouts back, his suit making some worrying sounds.
"hey gimme some credit - the only reason I got hit is because that guy snuck up on me, and its just a graze." I say, rolling my eyes as she begins wrapping my arm with a bandage. "my arm is going to be healed by the time you've got that on."
"oh I'm being an idiot? go and crawl back to the all american boy toy you're snuggling up with, and leave us be." He spits, pulling the girl into the elevator, pushing her against the wall before kissing her hard, the doors sliding closed behind them. Its a few minutes before I can move, but when I do, I run back to my room, pulling on my Captain America suit.
"nah its gonna be more funny watching him try and hide it from you." I laugh, grabbing my laptop.
"what did you say?" she asks, her voice soft. "come on, lets go for a walk." she says when I'm silent for a moment. We head out to the gardens, wandering around until we find a bench.
"what do you mean the obvious lie?" I ask, keeping my tone light and amused.
"I'm guessing it went well, then?" I ask him after a second, a small smile on my face.
"my fucking god is Cap lucky he's ill." Tony says, falling into the chair next to mine. I instantly get hit with the smell of alcohol clinging to him, making me scrunch my face up slightly. "they have the whole lot here tonight, this is the first time i've managed to sit down."
"So, why did Cap go back to Brooklyn?" Bruce starts, trying to break the awkward silence.
"okay then, Cap I'll take you inside." She tells me leading me away. I open my eyes when I hear a door shut, wincing at the sudden brightness. I look around and identify the place as one of SHIELD's quinjets, and take a seat.
"I was trained like one, and I sure as hell can decide what I can handle!"
I slowly walk towards the door, pulling it open to face Tony. Tony who look ridiculously perfect, of course. He's wearing a pair of faded jeans and a short sleeved band top, the design too faded to make out, over a long sleeve tshirt, which he has rolled up to his elbows, the scars on his arms from the workshop more visible in the sun.
"what, is Steve running at guns again?" Iron Man asks, a joke in his voice.
"don't leave just because of me!|" he says, standing up and grabbing my arm. "seriously, I don't want to be a nuisance to anyone."
"then uh- congrats? I thought you still love him or whatever." She questions, furrowing her eyebrows.
"god, I don't even know why I'm crying." he laughs, sitting up.
"table for 2?" Tony asks the waitress, flashing an award winning smile at the poor girl, which makes her eyes glaze over slightly before leading us to the table furthest from anyone else - a booth in a room with only one other table filled.
"are you adverse to breaking speed limits?" I ask as I get going, looking at Iron Man through my mirrors.
"they only love you because you're giving them attention." Tony tells me, turning around. "this is U, the one bugging you right now is Dum-E, and the one in the dunce hat is Butterfingers."
"I'm going to go say hi." I tell nat, motioning towards him.
"no you don't listen - they haven't fallen out, they were both being idiots and thought the other didn't like them, which I assume you've figured out?" Nat says with a grin, walking casually into the lift. I press my fingers gently to my lips, sending Tony a cautious glance, him smiling at me when he catches me looking. I smile back, dropping my hand to my side.
"yeah no problem. were you just casually wearing your gear out?" He laughs, nodding to my suit.
"one: that would pressure him into taking his off, two: he's Tony's closest friend for fucks sake." I say, scowling at her.
"fine, I'll go, you stay here." I laugh, putting my shoes on again.
"thats fine. take it slow, see where it goes." she says, grinning knowingly at me before snuggling back into her bed.
"it might be." he mumbles, opening his eyes. "I really did want to kiss you though."
"Cap has gone back to brooklyn for a couple of nights." I say quietly, looking up but looking back down straight away, when Natasha's eyes meet mine. that girl is too damn perceptive.
" she asks, walking around the sofa to get a look at me.
"Thanks, I might take you up on that." I tell him.
"why is this so goddamned hard?" Tony asks, smiling at me.
"oh please. the poor girl is probably in a committed relationship with you by now in her head." I say, chuckling at him.
"you guys walked in before he could respond, but the look on his face Nat I-"
"okay first off, Steve Rogers stopped Red Skull, and technically the tesseract disintegrated him, but more importantly, do we even want to kill the thing?" I ask, leaning back against my motorbike and watching as it grazes at some grass, trying not to look awkward about Natasha's obvious attempts to make me feel awkward.
"Captain, its good to see you." Bruce says with a smile as I walk in, standing up from the sofa. "How is Steve?"
on you."
"theres gotta be a better way to say that." she responds, causing me to laugh.
"nah its yours now." he says, turning to pack away a few things.
"it was getting boring over there." He explains, firing his repulsor at a hydra agent. "can't you see we're
"No I meant it." I respond, blushing lightly. He's suddenly in front of me, causing me to slam back into the wall in surprise. His hands move up my arms, his eyes watching my face.
"holy shit." I say, my eyes going wide. I just outed myself to Hawkeye. "I gotta go."
"you okay?" I ask, kicking the engine to life and holding him stable against my handlebar.
"oh so no luck for you yet?" she asks.
"he's- he's been a bit of a mess since Tony, and I think I may have pushed him too hard. I was just trying to help him move on, but now he doesn't trust me, and he's always making snarky comments. I don't know, he's just been acting weird." I explain, leaning back against the back of my sofa.
"Just visiting Cap. as much as he'll tell you he doesn't need help, the guy can't shower himself with a hurt arm in a bandage, so I am the lucky fellow to get the job. We're probably going to head back to Brooklyn later cause I have no clothes with me." I improvise, earning myself an amused eye roll from Natasha. "what are you doing here? I thought you were meant to be in meetings all day."
"what even happened between you two? Nat told me that you told him about the whole thing, but Tony has been locked in his workshop all month so no one really knows what happened." He asks, looking around the room.
"I would, but I don't think I have temperament to deal with half the people that you have to deal with." I laugh, wrapping my arms around him naturally.
"morning." I say with a smile as he walks into the kitchen the next morning.
"okay well tell me if you do want to stay here for a while - I have a huge tower its not like I'm short on places to go." he tells me with a smile.
"I'm going home. Cap will be back in a few days, I just need time to collect myself." I tell him, sending him a smile before walking out.
"you two be good!" Nat whispers to me on my way out, causing me to elbow her in the ribs.
"Hood. I'll sort this out." Nat whispers, walking towards the door as I pull my hood over my face.
"ugh I stink. sadly I may have to leave your very warm bed to sort this out." he says with a moan, leaning his forearms on my chest.
"rude. and also because Tony is on his way here to see Cap. thought I'd let you know, just in case you wanted to grab your hood." she says, glancing at the door as a sharp knock echos around my short apartment. "oh- nevermind. see you later." she says as I stand up, literally disappearing. I mean how does the girl do that, its creepy.
"I don't know. I mean, Nat set us up, and I thought it was going well, but it just seems like this isn't what you want, but you're keeping me around to not hurt my feelings, or to make nat happy or something." I say, regretting saying anything.
"we have our masks off, because it was stuffy enough in there and it was dark." I say, pulling back from the hug. she just laughs, grabbing my hand.
"it literally went through bone." I tell him, not too surprised that he doesn't want to go to the hospital.
"no he can he was just following up on a joke I keep making about him being a virgin." she fake whispers to him, winking at me.
"don't laugh - I pretend to call him like once a day." I say, rolling my eyes as he bursts out laughing.
"God, the police need to stop calling us the second civilians are involved." I joke, sitting down in the seat next to Clint.
"sorry, no can do, I have a friend over." Tony says, leaning back on his chair.
"Steve whoa calm down whats going on?" She asks, grabbing my shoulders to stop my pacing.
"hold still." she says, sitting on my chest.
"Thanks I'm really feeling the love and support." I say, instantly feeling guilty. "I'm sorry, its not your fault, I am just ashamed. I mean, I've fought Nazis, and yet one boy has done this to me?" I say, waving my arms around.
"Getting a little tuckered out there Cap? I mean, you're are doing pretty well for an older fellow." he jokes, walking closer to face me.
I wander into my bedroom, pulling out a pair of tracksuit bottoms after my post-run shower. its been a week since I saw Tony. I know that
"yeah that'd be really great." he says, rolling onto his side and wrapping his arms around my waist loosely.
"uh- Iron Man um- he said that they got on well is all. just wondered if Cap said something." his eyes going wide as I appear, me suddenly realising I have no shirt on.
"are you sure you'd want to? I'm not exactly a super soldier, you know." I tell him with a grin, moving further into his space.
"maybe I just have a lot to see." I say, feeling a blush spread over my cheeks.
"you aren't going to believe me." I say, smirking slightly remembering when Clint found out.
"only if you make it." He tells me, pulling on his shirt from last night.
"no, as Tony knows who I am I gave him my things yesterday, so I'm just here to pick things up. want me to give him your hood?" She asks, nodding to the piece of cloth in my hand.
"uh- yeah you could say that. I managed to make a huge idiot of myself though, I got absolutely off my head and the poor guy had to drag me home." Tony tells me while measuring around my torso. I try not to pay too much attention to what his hands are doing, it would be very awkward for captain America to get a boner from Tony Stark. I can see the headlines now.
"oh yeah?" I respond, leaning over to look at her phone. If she wanted opinions on boys it would have been easier to ask me when we were alone earlier, and she knows I have no clue about girls, so I have no idea what this is all about.
"ah but you see hun I have ventilation and such to make it feel like it isn't even there." Iron man says, and I chuckle lightly at him. and I feel guilty again. brilliant.
"oh trust me, I'm far from perfect when I take this off. I just have to be someone else in this suit." I say, looking down slightly.
, is this man pretty. I instantly feel bad, Tony popping into my head. I know we aren't actually dating, but I've always felt bad if I have a crush on someone and I ogle someone else. it just feels wrong to me.
"Don't you think thats a bit irrelevant? he could die Nat." I say, shoving my hand off her shoulder.
"you okay?" I ask him, placing my glass down.
"alright, Imma go watch some TV so I get sleepy. I wander down into the kitchen area, pulling my hood over my head as I go. I put the kettle on, before making myself a tea and leaning back against the work surface.
"hey." I say, my voice breaking.
A couple of hours later I make my way back to the tower, falling down on my bed after checking Tony's floor, finding it empty.
"Don't wanna hear it, Natasha." I yell, throwing the empty bottle against the door, knowing she'd just walk in anyway. sure enough, a second later the door opens, Iron Man stepping around the door instead, his eyes instantly going to the glass on the floor. "you look very sketchy in that. should I be worried that you're coming into my house in a black balaclava?" I ask with a smirk, not bothering to move.
"yeah I was going to but I ended up staying with a friend in Brooklyn. You and Steve have a fun night?" I ask, sitting down next to Nat.
, you just wanted to be the hero like usual, which ended in me having to drag you out to safety, and the main guy escaped!" I yell.
lol  I just googled it and aparently it takes like 5 mins to get from NY to brooklyn. please excuse my Englishness and pretend it takes an hour :)
"okay then surely going towards the door isn't the best idea?" Tony offers, in an equally quiet voice.
"I mean you can't be surprised that he wants to know." She sighs.
"Dum-E are you kidding me? I was just about had it this time before you moved!" Tony sighs, running a hand through his hair. "come on, lets try it again." he groans, leaning back towards his project. instead of moving in to help him, though, Dum-E drives straight for me, coming to a stop at my feet where he whirrs lovingly at me. I laugh, rubbing his claw.
"thats just how I do it baby." I say, throwing my arm over his shoulder and sending him a grin.
"Tony, you cannot blame me for throwing something at someone sneaking through my window." I say with a sigh, picking up my shield and propping it up against the wall. "are you okay?"
"hiya." he says, slipping into the room. "just coming to let you know visitor hours are almost over."
"I wanted to." I say, smiling back at him.
"yo dude where are you? I haven't seen you in like 2 weeks." Clint says as soon as I answer the phone, catching my breath.
"you mean-" he asks, stopping short and opening his mouth before closing it.
"you get first shower." I tell her, bumping my hip against hers as she walks past.
"I know you can't see my face right now, but fyi, I'm glaring at you." He says, shifting in my grip.
"perfect Captain motherfucking America." I say, pulling off my suit and shoving on my hood because I really can't be assed today, grabbing a bottle of vodka out of the bag. "If only America knew." I chuckle, chugging the whole thing before slumping back on my sofa.
"Can we talk?" he asks quietly.
"uh. hi?" she says, smiling up at me.
A while later, maybe 2 minutes, maybe 2 days, I don't have the brainpower to care today, someone knocks softly on my door.
"you ass." she says, hitting my arm. "I'm glad you're not squashed underneath a building."
"Okay, lets go then." I say, breaking out into a run before her hand falls on my shoulder again.
"no I haven't broken any ribs, I'm honestly fine. How about you? I noticed your leg was stuck." he says, his hand ghosting over my shin.
"Captain America you are a bad influence on me. I'm dead on my feet, all because I've stayed up the last 4 nights with you." he moans, wandering over to the coffee machine. I chuckle at him, sipping at my tea.
"does this mean you're going to ditch this, then?" I joke, flicking his Captain America helmet.
"you walked past Iron Man and Tony, and they're a pair of nosey buggers, so hacked into SHIELD." I tell him with a laugh, rolling my eyes at the man. "Natasha I can't believe you let me out myself to Hawkeye though."
"can't sleep." I say, keeping my eyes forward.
"yeah. I mean, you're Captain America, you're here to replace Steve Rogers. I couldn't think you're a bad person, just an annoyingly perfect one." he laughs, grabbing a beer from Tony's mini fridge, before putting it back when he realises he can't drink it.
"yeah. hes such a baby about it though, I'm only doing it because I'm trying to sort him and Tony out." She says, earning a scowl from me.
"what's going on?" I ask as I get there, Natasha, Bruce and Iron Man seeming to just be standing around.
"which is something I will never do. I mean maybe I could have done if I knew we were going to be actually dating - but I've made friends with him as Cap now, I'm in way too deep." I laugh, stuffing some clothes into a duffel, setting some aside to wear.
. I mean its literally just a cut, but apparently Tony is still around, so I am not." I explain, leaning against a tree.
"I don't know why you don't just tell him who you are." She says, standing up. "I mean yeah it'd be awkward but.." she says, trailing off and shrugging.
"oh- I did something bad, didn't I." he says quietly, his eyes still on my face.
"ah- sorry. I don't know why I'm so jumpy." He mutters, sitting back up.
"nothing, I just made a stupid mistake." I tell her.
"what are you even going to do with them?" I ask her, pulling my tshirt over my head.
"yep. and I called myself Steve Rogerson." I laugh.
"the pleasure is all mine." He tells me with a wink.
"What? no, Tony would literally murder me! Steve would never take Tony back I'd bet, but the guy still feels very guilty for the way he acted." He tells me. "also I do not have a
I sit at the bar, nursing a scotch so I don't look as awkward, watching Tony get grilled by hundreds of reporters. every now and again he catches my eye, sending me a wink before launching back in to answer more questions. at one point a girl comes up to whisper in his ear, which makes me nervous, i'm ashamed to say, but I don't have time to dwell on it before she is making her way over to me.
"well at least you didn't have a conversation with yourself." he laughs.
Its been 4 days since I last spoke to Tony. Nat thinks I should go back to Brooklyn, even if she doesn't say it, probably because I'm spending all day just moping around. I've only seen Tony a couple of times, when he emerges for food or water, before slinking back into his lab. even in those moments I see his cold expressions, his lack of care, and it ruins me all over again. I'm currently curled up of the sofa with Nat and Clint, some cheesy rom com playing on the TV that I'm not watching. the door slams open after a minute, Tony stumbling in, clearly very drunk. What makes my stomach churn, however, is the woman tucked under his arm, giggling as he runs his hands down her side. He barely gives me a glance as they stumble past, me not able to move a muscle.
"oh jeez okay we really need to get this off you." I tell him, inspecting the boulder.
"happy. Mind giving me a lift back to my tower?"
"I had this - disease - that means alcohol doesn't- get absorbed into my bloodstream very much at all. I only get a little drunk, and not for very long." I sigh, holding up the bottle to show him before chugging it, his hand coming up in protest.
"god a guy can't get 5 minutes as Steve Rogers around here." I mutter, turning around to give Natasha some privacy as we both pull on our suits.
"he kissed me." I say with a grin. "I mean he was sad about his boyfriend, so he definitely was not in his right mind."
"gah you hypocrite, I can smell you've had a beer!" He says, punching my shoulder as he pulls away, him seeming a bit all over the place, which is becoming a more normal sight for me. in his lab he is always like this - hyper because of whatever project hes working on and trying to do 7 things at once.
"oh I'm sorry to hear that." Tony tells me, offering me a slightly confused smile.
"yes!" Tony shouts as my character crosses the finish line, dropping my controller and holding his hand up for me to high five. he gently links his fingers with mine before using it to help him climb over the back of the sofa, landing half in my lap.
"so you have a crush on Steve as well?" I say with a grin.
"mmhmm you know you're loving this situation a little." she says, grinning at me.
"Steve, you know like Steve Rogers?" I respond, matching his smile when he makes an oh shape with his mouth.
"aw, you jealous?" He says, smiling to himself while reading the menu. "also who said that I'm not going to ask her out?"
"So Tony has been visiting you a lot. anything I need to know about?" she asks as the water starts, causing me to chuckle.
"Natasha, was it your dumb decision to bring someone who looks so ridiculously attractive to a gay bar?" A man questions as another glass is placed in front of me 5 minutes later.
"yeah, you're probably right." I say, rubbing the back of my head.
"I'll be fine - not the worst thing thats happened to me, don't look so worried, Capricorn." He tells me, a smile in his voice.
"you're saying that you loved me?" He asks quietly, his gaze returning to me.
"there, go look in the mirror."
"yep. I'm the Super soldier from the 60's. man with a plan and all the shebang." I say, gaining me a small chuckle. "well you heard the story about about Fury founding the red skull ship and my Shield?"
We end up chatting for hours. Iron Man messaged me telling me he was going to get a bit of shopping, so I decided to stay a little longer.
"It feels great though - the mouth part is so much more breathable than my hood." I say, stretching my body out.
oh dear god I'm resorting to quoting emo bands for titles now ( this one is from rome falls by panicland XD (bloody good song tho))
"I'm so shocked you actually did that." he laughs, watching as I stretch my back out.
"right. as fun as this was, Tony is very pissy without coffee." I say, walking back inside, stopping by the kitchen to grab my tea and Tony's coffee.
"yeah on second thought I wouldn't lead with that if I were you." she says, grinning at me.
"just because you never said it, doesn't mean it wasn't there." She says quietly, letting her hand drop.
"yeah, he knows. He's actually friends with Cap." She says, leaning back on her chair.
"I guess that makes sense, I did never see the two of you in a room together. but seriously, you had a whole operation going on." he laughs, leaning back. "you were both living here for a while, for gods sake." We both fall silent after that, and I look up to catch him staring directly at me. He smiles, waving me towards him. I join him on his bed, sitting cross legged opposite him.
"mmhmm thought it didn't matter." he whispers back, his fingers winding through my hair.
"mm.. how long have you been awake?" He asks, sitting up next to me, his voice thickened with sleep.
"Ste-"
"are you ready to order?" she asks, only looking at Tony, which causes him to flash me a grin, a hint of sadness still in his eyes, and I'm honestly not too sure why.
"brilliant, thanks. you wanna grab some lunch? my treat." He offers, smiling up at me.
"really? what about me haven't you figured out yet?" I ask, smiling up at him.
"aaand you're now my favourite person in the world. congratulations." He says, wrapping both hands around the mug and closing his eyes.
"don't be ridiculous, no one is gonna come in, and I promise not to look." I say, smiling at the blush rising over his cheeks before turning around.
"mmhmm sure you are. you know the perks of being out with a billionaire what is overly attracted to a certain lump of muscle is that I'm not worried about how much money we spend." he laughs, throwing his arm around my shoulder.
"ah sorry, he's just one of Nat's hookups." I respond, laughing lightly at the fact that he thought Clint is Hawkeye. I've known Clint quite a while, even though this morning was the first time I've told him I'm Cap, he was one of Natasha's first frequent hookups. "known the guy for a while now, theres no way."
"a lasagne?" I laugh lightly, scrunching my eyebrows up.
"yeah I can be there in 5." I tell him, hanging up and stuffing my spare bike helmet over my head.
"I'm fine Steve." He says slightly harshly, chugging the rest of the rum before leaning back against the table.
ive found this and now im finishing it bc y not this is going to be one hell of a masterpiece
"okay so now it looks like we just add these together?" I offer, scrolling uselessly through the recipe. I don't know where in our brains we decided that trying to cook would be a good idea, but Tony never cooks and in the 40's we just used to boil everything so we thought we should at least give it a go.
"you okay?" he asks, leaning his forehead against mine.
"Steve, I've been trying to give you space but that just isn't working anymore." Nat says from behind me, causing me to roll my eyes. I knew this would be coming soon.
"can I borrow Cap first? his uniform is most likely to be problematic because I made the most changes there." he says, poking his head around the door to wave at me.
"I know you could have, but Happy was free, and I do pay him to do things for me. we're leaving at 6:30 by the way, so we can get there for seven, so I wouldn't bother getting into normal clothes." he tells me, heading for the bathroom. A few minutes later I hear the shower turn on, so I take off my towel and get changed.
"Surprisingly holding up a building takes some difficulty." I tell her, grinning.
"yeah, I was stupid to show you that really." I laugh, thinking back. "but you still didn't answer."
"the gala was like 2 weeks ago, Steve. Somethings been worrying you for that long?" he asks, turning to face me.
"chill out, big green, its fine." He says, just as said unicorn spears him through his shoulder, its horn breaking through his armour like butter and its mane now glowing a fiery red. I run over to Iron Man as he collapses on the floor, holding his shoulder up. I'm not really too sure what to do, its not like I can put pressure on the wound or anything.
"I blame Nat for taking that damn photo, and Coulson for having a habit of standing quietly in dark corners." I tell him, returning to my meal, my cheeks still hot.
"oh okay, cool. I got Iron Man to record the meeting for me today, as I couldn't be there." Tony says, a small grin on his face. I feel my face go hot as I lean forward to death glare at Natasha. she just laughs, pulling out the photo again.
"well what do you think it is?" I ask, meeting his eyes with a smile.
"I'm so sorry I hurt you." He says, his voice muffled by my t shirt.
"and I can breathe." I say, pulling my hood off as I fall down onto the bed that used to be mine in Natasha's room. "this thing gets stuffy."
"thats fine, Iron Man, however I would suggest revealing your identities if you're doing this team thing - it would make everything a lot easier." Fury suggests, looking at Hawkeye, Iron Man and me. Tony has been typing on his phone for the last few minutes, and just as he puts it down my phone bings. he instantly looks up, making eye contact with me from across the table as I pull out my phone.
"Bucky was.. Amazing. I mean, he was my best friend, he always had my back, no matter what." I say, looking down.
"I fly around in a high tech tin can and break multiple air space laws monthly. I think I can handle a fast motorbike." he laughs, adjusting his hold around my waist as I push the bike further, weaving between the lines of traffic.
"of course I will. wouldn't be able to forget kissing you." He says, grinning up at me.
"You go first." I say, smiling at him.
"We're going to get out of here, the team will be looking for us." I say, slipping into inspirational cap mode.
"oh okay, hope it gets better soon. I think Tony is going to pick up your suit at some point so he can fix it."
"basically. I have my own place where I officially stay, but I like to help Tony with his work." he tells me, wincing as Dum-E stabs him with the needle.
"wanna order in a pizza?" I ask, kicking my shoes off.
"okay." I sigh, sitting up. "Can you take him some food? He asked me to but I know he would force me to eat too, and I'm really not feeling up for it."
"yeah." I mutter, plastering a smile on my face as the doors open again, the room already filling up.
"hey Steve, is Mr America himself here?" He asks, leaning against the doorframe.
"Tony, come on, you know it has never mattered to me who you are, I cared about you." I say with a sigh, dropping my bag and walking closer to him. "But we barely knew each other, really. We didn't tell each other so much because we wanted to keep it secret."
"all of it?" Nat asks, grinning at me.
Its been 3 weeks since I left Stark Tower. we've been called out on a couple of missions since, both of which I turned up to and attended the debrief after, but couldn't bring myself to stay any longer than needed. Nat has tried to visit a few times, but she always went away if my door was locked, which i'm grateful for. No one needs to see me wallowing in my own self pity like some lovesick teenager. I fall down onto the sofa, a bottle of wine in hand. I've found that if I chug something strong really fast, I can have a couple minutes of release. Its stupid, but during the war I saw countless men use alcohol as a coping mechanism, and I'm not exactly worried about getting addicted, the buzz is way too short for that.
"This has happened because you weren't letting your friends in. when you were fighting Nazis, the commandos were there, weren't they? but you've decided to do this alone, which not even Captain America can do." she tells me, placing a hand on my arm.
"I know right!" Natasha agrees, shaking her head while still effortlessly fighting off agents.
"Meet me at your place. I wasn't joking about wanting to introduce you to Tony." She says, her eyes alight.
"I sent a message saying we were heading into this basement because I knew I would lose signal, so the team should be able to work out where we are." He says, flinching when the building shifts. I just sit next to him, wrapping an arm around his shoulder.
"this is awkward." he says standing up. "look, can we just not talk about this? We're both struggling with breakups, now is probably not the time for this."
"uh I think he said something about meeting up with some old friends." I say, sending him a thankful smile.
"I don't know. Cap and I don't really talk about that sort of thing." I respond after a moment, sitting down on the sofa next to him. "why does Iron man like Cap like that?"
"It just makes me laugh sometimes when I look over and you're wearing some normal, everyday human clothes, then a fucking balaclava." I laugh, rolling my eyes.
"wait- Tony you ass you just ran me into a tree- " Hawkeye is a particularly vocal mario cart player. we all knew he is competitive - he gets like it in the field, always trying to shoot the most amount of bad guys.
a half hour later and Tony has finally agreed, and we're all working out arrangements.
"he says, while brooding. why not just call him?" she asks, turning to face me and crossing her legs.
Tony ended up passing out on my shoulder on the way home, so Nat and I carried up to my apartment before she took off on her motorbike. Now, I'm lying in bed, staring shamelessly at the sleeping man next to me. Its not like I just straight up got into bed with the man, I put him down on my bed and he refused to let go, mumbling about not wanting to drown. I may have misjudged him. from what I saw last night, the man portrayed in the newspapers is very different from the true Tony Stark. Yes, he's got all of the personality traits they mention, but somehow he has this amazing personality trait that just makes those things work, and makes him a great person to have a conversation with. I would be lying if I didn't say he's attractive, he's got a perfectly trimmed beard, his normally perfectly gelled back hair now falling over his forehead, and amazingly large eyes, but when you look past all that you can see evidence of his job. he has amazing arms, his body (from what I can see of it) is littered with small scars, and probably the most obvious, the shining blue light in his chest.
"I knew you wouldn't just let that go." I laugh, rolling my eyes.
"Steve I'm so sorry." Nat says as she walks in, pulling me into a hug. "why are you Cap?"
"ah." she says, and I nod my head. "yeah I've noticed you guys being more chummy than lovey."
"theres no escaping it, and it makes you look hot so deal with it." she tells me as she begins outlining my eyes with the scratchy pencil. After that she smudges it a little, before standing back to admire her work. "perfect."
"I was thinking about saving your life! I saw the building was about to topple and I was trying to get you out!" He bites back.
I carefully place the pile on the ground, feeling a little weird about changing with someone else in the room, but begin to strip anyway, turning my back to Iron Man for a little more safety.
"come on, I need a shower but after we could get a take out and put a film on?" I suggest, flicking off the lights.
"mmhmm whatever you say. also I doubt Tony feels guilty." I say, rolling my eyes.
"Steve Rogerson isn't in the picture anymore. He's still living back in Brooklyn, so its all good."
"We've done
that is until a photo of me pops up on screen.
I sit in the corner and watch as he tries to manoeuvre Tony's bots to stitch him up.
"yeah, I know." I say quietly, watching him as he starts to laugh.
"ah, they found my secret!" I laugh, looking sideways at him. "so you're just, cool with this?" I ask, waving my hand towards my body.
"let me sort that out, itll give me something to do in the meetings."
"no, because I still have to be Steve!" I say, running a hand through my hair.
"I'm sorry Tony." I say, walking out and straight up to my room. I ignore Natasha's questions as I begin packing, letting the task of folding up my clothes dull my brain.
"you know you don't have to keep inviting me longer just to make Natasha happy." I say in a moment of confidence.
"Hey Steve, how's your arm?" Bruce asks as he passes me in the hall.
now?" He says, sitting foreward.
"well what do you mean by that? Captain America is so sexually repressed, and we've only been dating for a few weeks." I explain.
"made me a battery oil milkshake then spilt it all over the engine I was fixing up." he tells me, giving the robot a disapproving look before returning to tidying up his work area. "I'm surprised they're so all over you for the first time meeting you. I mean Dum-E is no surprise, he's more like a puppy than a robot, but U is usually more shy." he nods to Butterfingers, who takes it as permission to leave the corner and proceeds to race over to me, making me laugh again. of course I know the exact reason why they are comfortable around me, the second that I showed up at the tower as 2 different people JARVIS has had a sort of dry, sarcastic hint to his voice, like he's amused that Tony is so oblivious. to be honest, I think if Tony didn't constantly have 20 things on his mind, he would have known it the second he had Cap and I in the same building.
"aww you made him blush!" Nat tells them, coming over to lift my mask over my cheeks, poking them both before pulling it back down, all while dodging my attempts to stop her.
"nowhere. lets just eat." Nat says, sitting down at a stool. I slip into the one next to her, and Tony takes one at the opposite end of the table.
"C'mon, I said we'd meet him at the bar." she tells me, tugging my arm.
"hey, are you sure this is not because you're tired and missing your boyfriend?" I ask, placing my hand on his cheek.
"hey its okay, could just be the others." I say quietly, trying to keep in Cap mode.
"yeah well I mean the overall physique of the guy, and I've never seen you two together before. although I think it was because its the obvious lie." He laughs, watching as I search his face.
"Its okay Steve. To be honest, Tony is bad at emotions, and even worse at commitment. This may be a talk you'll have to have with him." She tells me, looking down at her drink.
has had sex??" Tony adds, making everyone dramatically gasp down the coms system. I just sigh, rolling my eyes again.
"yeah it can be."
"I'll see you around." I tell him with a wave, hearing him return the sentiment before leaving.
"I'm glad that you don't want to hide your feelings" I say after a moment, smiling down at the table. "but how about we don't label this, and just go with it?" I offer up, looking up at him.
I have to say, Iron Man's suit is much more advanced than I thought it would be. I mean yeah, I knew it would be good - Tony did build it after all, but it was like fighting a regular human - the suit is tight against his skin, allowing for a full range of motion, plus all the bonuses of being in full metal armour.
"oh.. okay guess now it is." I mutter, leaning my head back again.
"well Iron Man took a photo of it for me, and he just said I have something to show you, so if you blame anyone blame him." He says with a grin, obviously loving watching me being so flustered.
After getting him back to his room, I wander back to mine, falling down onto my bed, letting out a light laugh.
"so if you could just try it on, then I have a few tests to run to make sure it all fits." I say, handing him the pile of clothes.
"who was it?" Tony asks, looking up at me.
"well, as much as I would like to carry on this conversation, I should probably go and get dressed, got meetings today with the Avengers about their uniforms, and its almost an hours drive." he tells me, placing his mug in the sink and walking back into my room. I pull out my phone after he's left, and sure enough, theres a message from Nat telling me my time for seeing Tony, one thats starting in 1 hour. I decide to have a quick shower while Tony is getting ready, and I step out of the bathroom to see him shrugging his jacket back on.
"see?" I say with a grin, my brain feeling a little fuzzy.
"Sorry Coulson, I'm back in Brooklyn at the moment. Can you send me the notes?" I ask.
"Hi Steve." Clint says, waving lightly at me.
"what do you mean?" he asks, looking up at my face.
"I knew my Cap, and thats all that mattered to me." he says, his eyes meeting mine as he takes a few steps closer. "and if you didn't care who I am, we wouldn't be in this damn situation!"
"why does it matter if I'm smart? what does it matter if I fly around in a fucking tin can saving their sorry asses? I'm still justÂ the son of Howard, ultimate playboy, just throwing away the reputation that his father left behind." He says, falling back into my arm.
"really?" I laugh, meeting his eyes. Fuck.
"oh- uh Robertson." I respond quickly, cringing at how close it is to Rogers. oh well, he's very unlikely to guess that I am a superhero who, according to the papers, died in the 40's, so I think I'm safe.
"I do
"So It was a girlfriend that drove him home?" He asks, pushing further.
"you didn't want to go? I thought you had similar friends to him." Tony asks quietly, sending me a tentative smile.
"Ah, Tony! you're... almost not late. good going." she greets him, standing up to wrap her arms around him.
"too soon." I respond, rolling my eyes, causing him to bark out a metallic laugh.
"Its stupid - a few days ago, we were talking about how we're going to take things slow because we have 'all the time in the world'" he scoffs, leaning his head back. "how ironic."
"Hi Tony." I laugh, hugging him back.
"yeah I know, but he got called out on some pretty urgent SI stuff, so he's asked me to make sure everything is alright with your suit." I say, walking over to where I left his suit.
"I do, but he doesn't love me. I'm not going to let him take me on some pity dates, just so he can hook up with god knows how many girls when I'm not around." I say, zipping up my bag.
"I don't care who you are, I care who I am. Tony you made it clear last time that you didn't want to be with me. Maybe you just wanted to be with the perfect Captain America." I sigh, knowing it was an unfair thing to say. He just shakes his head, looking away from me.
"you couldn't have told me that Steve was here?" I ask after he has given me Cap's gear, laying my head on the table.
"oh, okay tell Happy I say thanks." I begin unwrapping my hands, dropping the bandages into my bag. I decided to work out for a few hours to pass the time until Tony gets back. I head upstairs and jump in the shower, hearing the lift open just as I step out.
"Hey Steve." Clint greets me, sliding into the bar stool next to me. "good to see you back here."
"anytime. its whatÂ  friends are for, after all." She laughs, grabbing a black sac. I have to admit, the shower made me feel a lot more like me, like this is something I can get past. I get changed into some jeans and a shirt before brushing my teeth, then going to help Nat. By the time I get out there the place is basically clean, and 2 big bags of rubbish are sat by the door.
"that we are"
"ran into an old boyfriend." I say, grabbing another bottle from my bag. "it doesn't matter anyway, I can barely get drunk."
"I mean I guess, it does make sense, although there is a high chance I'm just in shock." He responds, smiling lightly. "oh my god, that means you kissed aunt peg!" He says after a moment, sitting up.
After the meeting, I quickly make my way to my car, but not before Natasha can intercept me.
"Iron Man." I greet him, giving him a tight nod. "where's Stark?"
We ended up going to see some new Disney film for kids, apparently it was the best thing on, but I'm convinced that Tony just wanted to see it. after that we just wandered around a little, and ended up back near my apartment in the early evening.
"that is very sad." I say with a nod. "I may even go as far as to say tragic!"
"gah Captain, Steve Rogers would be disappointed." he says, poking my stomach, laughing when I scrunch my face up. "hey, didn't you chug a whole bottle of vodka last night?"
"Chinese is on its way." Tony tells me, walking back into the kitchen.
"oh please. there's no way he'd notice you! just give me one chance, i'll be there to make it non-awkward, it'll be super relaxed." She tells me, leaning against the side of my car.
"So what are you up to today?" he asks after a moment, taking another sip of coffee.
"really? this soon?" I ask, turning my head to look at him too.
"god- Steve its- its been so long-" she says, her mouth still agape.
"hey you, whats up?"
"and how has my assery pissed you off this time, my fair lady?" I ask as she shuts the door.
"of course sir." JARVIS responds as we slip off our shoes. I move my pile of pillows and blankets on the sofa out of the way, giving us room to sit.
"no its- its not your fault. I'm sorry I didn't tell you when I knew you were so close with other Steve." I say slightly louder, my voice breaking, causing me to wince. "how long have I been out?"
I end up spending most of my night chatting with pepper, occasionally being left to drift around the room making light small talk with everyone whenever someone catches her. Before long, I'm back in Tony's room, Pepper's words still on my brain. Maybe its just me being old fashioned, but is Tony sleeping with other people? I dwell on that all night, deciding to spend my time watching the man sleep and pondering if I'm the most important person in his life instead of sleeping.
"yeah. She basically insinuated that you wanted me to hook up with someone else while you were busy, and I haven't done this before, this whole dating thing I mean, so do I ask to be the only person in your life?" I ask, watching his expression become unreadable.
"okay, you first." I say, smiling at him.
"Well I'd better go get ready. good to see you dude." Clint tells me, leaving the room.
"going back to the joke, it actually wasn't a joke. We were up at 5am every morning to go for a run." I say, sipping on my tea.
"Tony asked me to live here when you left, and he's staying at my place for a little while." He tells me, coming to lean against the surface next to me.
"OKAY DON'T MOVE - THE HULK IS GOING TO LIFT IT."
"how about I do something to help you relax?" he offers, one of the eye pieces going dark to mimic a wink, us both laughing.
"what did he do?" I ask, nodding to butterfingers as U wheels over.
"hi" I say, sending a hesitant smile towards him.
"why not? I mean you kissed me. was it that bad of a kiss?" he jokes, but his eyes are full of hurt.
"okay, well from my side, we were so close the first couple of weeks that we knew each other, but then you came to stay here with me and you always seemed so secretive and panicked, and well, I thought that it was me, or maybe Cap was something more, which is none of my business, but I could see you weren't happy, so I stopped the jokes and the teasing, thinking maybe you wanted more of a chilled friendship type thing. But I'm not great at holding myself back, so maybe I did start to drift. I'm really sorry about that." He explains, his eyes glued to my bed.
" I- wow I guess so." I say, leaning back against the wall. "I mean, I still really care about Tony. I just- I like Iron Man."
"oh yeah, that. we need your help. can you get down to SHIELD headquarters?" Clint tells me, making me sigh.
He asks, causing me to almost trip over while pulling my shirt over my head.
"she saw her friend being an idiot. look - he's going to think its all over if you don't go see him." she tells me, a little softer this time.
"about the lift?" He grins with a wink, his hand drawing patterns on my knee.
"yeah" I chuckle, looking away from Iron Man's outline. why on earth is he bringing this up, most of all now? I mean jesus fuck we're stuck in a collapsed basement together minutes away from our probable death, but sure lets have this talk.
"yeah that'd work. thanks. I better head out for my run now, see you later."
"yeah. I actually met Tony at one of theÂ  heart clinics and we ended up getting on well. He gave me his arc reactor to power Iron Man, but also to help my heart too. the guy is a pain in the ass, but I guess I wouldn't be alive without him." he tells me, looking down slightly.
"Steve I was just coming to find you." Tony says, stumbling into the hallway. "Are you- I don't think I've seen you cry before. are you okay?"
"that. but more importantly - is this a permanent style change? we going for the edgy cap?" Iron Man laughs, while pointing at a unicorn.
"ah okay." he says quietly, his arms working their way around my torso, making me smile. Iron Man is always so soft and pliable in the morning - quite similar to how Tony is actually.
"Cap may be sexually repressed, but you sure as hell aren't. are you forgetting the first few months after you woke up?"Â  she scoffs, rolling her eyes.
"uhh- hi. I'm here for my appointment with Tony?" I say, unsure of where to look.
I walk back into my apartment at 6:30, sighing and flopping down onto the sofa. I really did try to make my apartment look modern when I was decorating, but it still ended up looking like it came right out of my mothers house. I kind of love it though - its so tiring trying to catch up with 70 years of life, and having a place where I can go back to being Steve from Brooklyn is a big help. or maybe it just reminds me of Bucky.
"yeah" I respond quietly. before long all the weight is off, and I stand up, taking a breath.
"Tony has had Mr Happy drop off a tuxedo for you, it is waiting in Tony's room." he tells me as I take a drink of water.
." He jokes, causing me to roll my eyes.
"don't worry - I don't mind cuddles." I laugh, handing him the mug of coffee I've had on the bedside table.
"you get used to it." I laugh, rolling my eyes.
"mind doing some flips or something? Tony wanted me to make sure you can move around alright in it." Iron Man asks, taking a step back to clear some room. I nod at him, before launching into a series of flips and battle moves, starting to show off slightly. I stop when I think he has seen enough, turning to face him again.
"better now Nat broke me out of my pity party." I laugh, ordering a water. "how has Tony been?"
"well I do still owe you a dance after all." I say, pressing a kiss to her cheek.
"okay, well you can be my date. doesn't thisÂ  just make things easier though?" she asks, raising an eyebrow.
"thanks man." I say with a laugh, taking a sip of my drink. "To be honest I have missed this place."
that was a fun conversation. I couldn't exactly come out with 'oh yeah I'm kinda dating Tony' giving Iron Man lives with him, but luckily he understood why I didn't want to talk too much about it.
"oh come on, girls are constantly throwing themselves at you." I say, rolling my eyes.
"okay so you are lacking confidence? come on, let me sort you out." she laughs, handing me my shirt. 10 minutes later she has styled my hair so every single strand lays perfectly, before coming at me with a pencil.
"Oh no I think it was the other way around. the guy is like one of those Greek statues, probably has about the same amount of muscle as you actually." Tony tells me with a laugh.
"he came back to change clothes then went off to stay with a friend." I tell him.
"oh yeah? after what I saw earlier my mind is pretty open."
"No. like I said, He wouldn't want me to discuss his personal life with you." I say, noticing that Tony had slipped off. "excuse me." I head towards his lab, entering my access code before slipping through the door. I quickly find Tony leaning over his work surface where a 3D hologram of my suit is, a bottle of rum in hand.
I sigh as I open my eyes, wincing as a headache breaks over my head.
"Iron Man?" I ask, stopping still.
"okay, thats fine, take all the time you need, and bring us some food because you look like you haven't moved since the fight." I joke, smiling as he walks out.
"thanks." I say, opening my messages.
"Natasha are you actually kidding me?" I whisper shout at her, causing her to laugh.
"you up next?" I ask, pulling my hood off for air. It gets surprisingly stuffy in that thing. Its something they just made for me quickly when I got out of the ice - its based off of my old old outfit, which was basically just a pair of tights and a balaclava, but instead the fabric also covers my nose and mouth.
"Hey Steve?" He says, lightly touching my arm. "I'll let you guys have some time." He tells me, grinning as I hand him the coffee.
? I mean, no right? tell me that you're-" He stutters.
"I'm not sure if you'd like that." he says, his expression unreadable.
"you're an idiot. gimme that, It'd be better for you to have something a little better than a thin piece of fabric before you two next get together." Nat laughs, grabbing my hat. "I'll make sure to tell him to give it to Steve." she tells me with a wink, before walking downstairs.
"we barely saw him for the first couple of weeks, but the last week he's been acting like nothing is wrong. it was odd, it just happened one day." Clint tells me, taking a drink of his beer. We end up staying at the bar for a couple of hours, before we decide to head back to the tower. I let them go ahead of me so I can go and change back into my suit and pack. about an hour later I'm pulling up outside Stark tower, taking a deep breath before walking in.
I walk into the kitchen one night, grabbing myself a glass of water before sitting down on the sofa. a while later Iron Man joins me, his actions slow.
"morning" Tony says groggily, his hand coming up to wipe his eyes.
"ugh thats boring. glad you made it here tonight, you and Cap don't know the definition of a break. You know him and Iron Man are like a
"I can't deal with you right now." Iron man says quietly, storming off to the lab.
"thanks it was starting to get really stuffy in that thing." I say, walking back into the main room.
"its fine J. whats making you so happy?" I ask, trying to look over her shoulder. she turns her phone around to show me a photo from a few minutes ago, after I just woke up. I'm stretching after standing up, my shirt riding up slightly and my hair a mess.
"why oh why does Fury always call meetings when I'm with Stevie here?"
"okay, fair enough. We'll talk about this some other time though, yeah?" He responds, his voice a little less strained. "also I'm shutting my eyes so you better be too."
"really? that actually worked? I always found you so easy to read." she jokes, sitting up a bit more to take a sip of tea.
"thanks, apparently Nat likes to attack her dates with pencils." I say, chuckling weakly.
"Imma kiss you now."
"so does Tony want this back?" I ask, pointing at the suit.
"hang on - you haven't been with other people?" he asks, his voice becoming sharp, my face falling before I can stop it. "So what? its my fault for not knowing that you were so deep into this? thats on you Steve, not me. If you wanted a commitment, you should have said."
"I-. Hm." he says, shutting his eyes. "my brain hurts too much to come up with a response to that."
Underneath the neat text theres a phone number written, which I quickly put into my phone.
"okay, fuck I only have half a mask, you can't look at me." he says, squirming slightly beneath the large hunk of concrete on his chest.
"What the hell was that??" I shout, pulling off my gloves before throwing them down onto the island. we just got back from debrief after a mission that should have been easy, if
"what do you mean?" I ask, relaxing back again.
"ah yes, Tony has mentioned you. its great to finally meet you." I say with a smile, shaking her hand. "So Tony sent you over to keep me company?"
"So Stevie, what have you been up to?" He asks, turning his head to look at me.
"I'm worried about you. also the whole 'Cap is looking after Steve' lie isn't working anymore." She tells me, moving some empty containers off my sofa to sit next to me. "I mean, I've never seen you like this. You're lounging around in your underwear, this place is a mess, and you really need a shower and a hair cut."
"alright - I'll let Tony know. He's been a nervous wreck all morning." He laughs his metallic laugh.
"Naturally. that was so awkward." I say rubbing my hand over my face.
"Why hello Captain." Natasha says as I pull myself back into our room.
"wait..
"why thank you i'm rather proud of it actually."
"yeah. he literally walked past me with his hood off last night - look I'll show you the security cameras from in the lobby." he tells me, walking over to a monitor.
"yeah I might do that. I guess I'll see you later then." I say, smiling gently at him.
"oh pretty good, although iron man bled all over my workshop before leaving to snuggle up with Captain Spangles." he complains.
"why thank you, kind sir. you look good too." I say with a laugh. "you want a top up?" I offer, nodding to the drink in his hand.
"nah, you're fucking with me." He says, looking to Natasha. "he's fucking with me right?" he asks Nat quietly.
"its no problem, thanks for sorting out my tux, although I could have gone and got it." I say, pulling out some boxers.
"you guys deal with
"hey Cap where you heading?" Iron Man asks as I run down the stairs.
"Stay still." I mutter, before yelling as loud as I could for the others to come and help.
"haha yeah. uh maybe we should get coffee some time, catch up.." he says, trailing off.
"I don't know. worlds my lobster I guess." I say with a smile, causing Tony to chuckle lightly.
Its from earlier today, after I got out the shower and Coulson had scared me. My face and all down my chest is bright red, my eyes wide, my towel mid fall and my hands - luckily - reaching to grab it and covering up certain parts.
"really? I literally thought we were best mates!" I laugh, rolling my eyes. under my mask. "For what its worth, I don't think you're a bad person, you just piss me off during fights." I say after a minute.
"I just know that getting a hole through a bone is not fun, and you are underreacting, by the way." I tell him, rolling my eyes and holding up a piece of cloth. I walk over to him, gently tying the fabric around his neck and manoeuvring his arm through it. "there." I say, smiling and taking a step back.
"Late night?" I ask with a laugh, prodding his shoulder. sleepy Clint is always overly honest, he literally says whatever pops into his head.
"you're back on the booze?" I ask quietly, observing the half empty bottle of alcohol in his hand.
"you idiots owe me big." Nat says as she approaches, pulling me in for a hug. "why do you both have your eyes shut?"
"I'm going to need you to strip cap, so I can get good measurements." Tony tells me with his back to me, fiddling with some equipment.
"do you really have to bring your hookups to our shared bedroom?" I ask, glaring at Nat.
"I can't believe we've been being such idiots this whole time." Tony laughs, rolling his eyes. "can I interest you in a drink?"
"Steve! its been a while." Pepper greets me, pulling me in for a hug. "I see you got at him with the eyeliner." She says, turning to Nat.
"I'm sorry - We tried our hardest to help you without me seeing but I needed to carry you so they could keep pressure on your wounds." Steve explains coming and sitting on the edge of my bed, still dressed in his full gear.
"how about we agree to not hurt each other anymore?" he suggests, a forced smile on his lips.
"where the fuck did you guys go? you just literally disappeared." Clint says as we walk back in, the three of them carefully placing the pots on the table.
"She might not be the same. Shes- well shes old. she forgets stuff. let me go in first, I'll need to take off my mask and have a chat. I won't tell her who you are, just that I have someone." Iron Man tells me and I nod in response. while I wait I grab 2 teas and a coffee, before taking a seat outside the room and waiting for Iron Man.
"please, don't remind me." I reply, stuffing some clothes in a duffel.
"we'll be at the hospital soon." I tell him, roaring off down the road.
"yeah but you're more chill than Iron Man. also, Steve told him his name is Steve Rogerson when they were dating. I was honestly shocked when he didn't make the connection, but if Steve tells Tony he is Steve Rogers, he has to come up with a reason for keeping his hood on, which will definitely end up with figuring it out." Nat chimes in. I look back up at Clint and wave my hand at Nat in agreement, before falling back onto my bed.
"Hi." He sighs, taking a large mouthful of the rum. "Just not in the mood today."
"Thats a shame - I'm sure you guys will figure it out though, he's like your Bucky Barnes." I freeze up, my head shooting up at that name. I hear Tony chuckle at his comment as if I'm underwater.
"dude I've been in here since before you came in. also, my reaction wasn't bad."
"maybe I should give it a go." He laughs, his position relaxing slightly. I quickly grab my shield when I see someone sneaking around the corner, quickly taking them out. "thanks sweetcheeks." He says, pulling me in for a sideways hug before taking off again.
"what? oh i get it now, like Steve Rogers." he says, nodding to himself.
"Hey. surprised you're not with the girls." I joke, smiling at him. He just opens his mouth, before closing it again, his eyes raking over my body. I pretend not to notice, looking towards the floor.
"What happened?" Nat asks, walking into our room and instantly coming to sit on the end of my bed.
"why thank you, now lets go eat and watch something." he tells me, taking my hand and skipping into the living room, making me laugh.
"lets go - Clint has the jet ready to go." Nat says as I shove my shield on my back before racing out of the room.
She is right though. I guess it wouldn't hurt to try and have a better relationship with the other avengers, even if it does feel like i'm cheating on Steve a little. I mean, we aren't even dating, so I really shouldn't feel guilty. I quickly step into my Iron Man suit, letting the metal fold in around me. When I hear footsteps on the stairs I quickly snap my faceplate down, before turning to face Cap.
"what the hell? Gah!" I shout, diving for my towel as I feel my whole body go hot. I hear Natasha laughing from behind me.
"hey, can't you see I'm crippled? and I needed the good Captain to keep me from dying of blood loss." Iron Man tells her, a grin in his metallic voice. "and we weren't cuddling, we both have almost boyfriends."
"yeah." I agree with a smile, standing up and walking with him to the lift.
"Oh he can't make it, Cap the second." he tells me, his suit whirring as he turns his head. We're all trying to keep our identities secret, apart from Banner, who wouldn't exactly be able to wear a mask if it kept getting ripped to shreds, Nat, who is the one that knows who we all are for security reasons, and Tony Stark, who is someone who isn't working for SHIELD. Iron Man doesn't work here either as Tony built his suit, but I guess he wanted to keep who he is secret.
I left pretty soon after the party, suddenly feeling very out of place for some reason. I stop by a shop and pick up a few bottles of booze on the way before heading back to my apartment.
a year sober, but I was feeling like drinking so I went to see Tony and he was already drunk, going on and on about Steve." He tells me, leaning heavily into my side. "why were you drinking?"
"pleasure to meet you sir." I say, dropping his hand.
"well if you knew Steve like I do, you'd know he's definitely not the sexually repressed image that America makes him out to be." Nat jokes.
"oh I know, Steve told me. I'm taking him home now, he doesn't need this shit from you any longer. I'll be staying with him for a few days, so call me if anything goes down." I say, my voice staying surprisingly calm. "this," I say, shoving a box into his hands, "Is something he got you for your birthday, so throw it out, burn it, he doesn't care." I storm off, keeping tears from my eyes. The box holds a basic screwdriver, the letter S engraved into the handle. I got it for him before he stormed off, deciding to leave out the card asking him to be my boyfriend. instead I burnt that, the night he stormed out of that pub.
"It matters to me, at least. it matters to our team too. You're more than what the public thinks of you." I tell him, turning to look at him to see that hes already watching my face. he leans in slightly, pressing a gentle kiss to my lips. I just freeze, all rational thoughts going out of my head as I pull him closer, deepening the kiss. he climbs over to straddle my hips, pressing his body against mine.
"hellooo." she sings as I sit down next to her, placing my shield by the side of my seat. Hawkeye walks in next with Bruce trailing after him.
"and you think that I do?" He responds, looking up at me. "you wanna come anyway?" he asks after a moment. "I mean like if you're not too busy..."
"okay, come here." she tells me, digging around in a bag and coming out with the eyeliner pencil.
"hey Steve, am I safe?" Iron Man asks through the door, my hand instantly going to my mask.
"Just Nat, giving me shit like always." I laugh.
"Okay, Nat mentioned she has introduced you to Steve, I'll get him to give my hood to you the next time you see each other." I tell him, starting on my trousers, until I'm left in the tight boxers I wear underneath my suit.
Nat says, grinning at me when I walk into Tony's living room.
"yeah, sure." He replies with a small smile, handing me his empty glass. I head over to the bar, ordering our drinks from the Iron Man suit controlled by JARVIS.
"I'm fine. don't worry, you won't see it again. I'm heading home." I say, walking past him.
"yep, the layers just keep on coming." he tells me, grinning. I just laugh at how proud he looks for coming up with that. A minute later my phone starts ringing, causing me to jump into action.
"you also stink. jeez Steve, thought you wouldn't sweat or something."
"hun, he called you hawkeye." Nat explains, placing her hand on his shoulder.
." I explain.
"oh yeah that'd be great. Hey Tony, I'm actually a 25 year old war hero who was born in 1918." I say dryly, glaring at her.
"oh dear god, you haven't changed one bit." she laughs, her eyes still a little sad.
"you're dating his best mate - you can't hide from him forever." she says, laughing.
"you asshole." I tell her, letting go of her before punching her arm.
"I mean I thought you put that much together. come on, I'll prove it." I bring them round back, to Tony's collection of cars, standing between 2 land rovers.
"I shove my hand in his front pocket, feeling acutely aware of how awkward this is, and quickly dish out his phone.
"no thanks, Happy's outside. Bye, Steve." Tony tells me with a smile, before shutting my door behind him.
"not a clue. you've really dug yourself a nice hole over there." She says, leaning back against the wall.
"what do you mean?" He slurs, looking up at me. its sad really, how conscious he is. you can tell he's really drunk, but he can still function, is still good at hiding it.
"I don't know what to do Nat." I say, sitting up and wiping my eyes.
"I told you that you didn't want to hear it." I mutter, leaning back in my chair.
"to tell you the truth. the only problem is I really don't wanna lose the mask yet." I say, looking up at him.
"well that was embarrassing." I say after a moment, turning to look at Tony.
"you okay? you seem quiet." Tony asks, turning around to give me a puzzled look, breaking me out of my train of thought.
"So you knew her?" I ask, my voice breaking slightly. Iron Man nods, sending me a sympathetic glance. "How was she? like- did she move on? was she happy?"
"He kissed me." I say, ripping my arm from her grasp to continue packing.
we end up making an evening of it, and ordering some food. Nat and I stopped drinking early on, but Tony kept going throughout the night, until Natasha and I literally have to carry him to my car.
"so hows your week been?" he asks as I look through my wardrobe for something to wear.
Butterfingers whirrs happily when I walk in from where he's in the corner wearing the dunce hat, causing Dum-E and U to turn to look at me from where they're working.
"this can't be right." He says, hesitating before making his way towards me, slowly peeling my hood off. "fuck."
"wait Steve you told Iron Man who you are?" Bruce adds from his lab. he's trying to figure out where they're all coming from back at the safety of the lab. I'm guessing SHIELD didn't want to let the hulk loose on their shiny building.
"Its your fault for accepting a job from Tony." I laugh, standing up and holding my hand out to him. "coffee?" I offer when I see the look he normally has in the morning - one that tells me he is not getting out of bed.
I step out the shower to find Natasha Romanoff laid out on my sofa, playing on her phone.
"CAP?" Natasha responds a few calls later, and I let out a breath.
"yeah me neither." he sighs. the building around us shifts again, making a small sound escape Iron Man's lips, him curling up, which ends up with him buried into my chest. I just wrap my arms around him rubbing small circles on his back.
"Steve that is a bit of an overreaction, even for you." she says with a sigh, placing a hand on my chest when I try to leave. "how can you think that he doesn't love you just as much as you love him, after everything you've been through?"
"okay I'm coming now." she says, opening the door and linking her arm with mine. I take a deep breath before stepping around the door, my eyes instantly meeting Tony's.
"maybe one day, if things change." Iron Man adds, making me smile slightly. "I think we have them all."
"see? Clint Barton." He says, turning to face me.
"uh hi." I say quickly, my eyes meeting Natasha's, who sends me a wink.
"No, we just came by to drop off this folder. Its got some background information on some other powered people and something called the Avengers Initiative." Coulson says from behind me, making me spit out my water and drop my towel.
d r a m a :)
"hi Tony, I saw Steve on the way out and he told me you'd be here." I say, smiling at him nervously.
"because- well because he's Tony." I say, running a hand through my hair. "so why are you here?" I ask, turning to face her.
"my god I have so many questions! what was Bucky like?" he asks, excitement clear in his eyes.
"good." I say, letting my hands fall to his hips as he gently kisses me, but we get cut short by another crash.
"okay so back to why I'm here so we can move on from whatever that was, I was here to drag your sulky ass over to Stark, but as it is already sufficiently near Stark, I'll leave you two to it." she tells us, standing up. "oh yeah, and Tony you've been invited to another Avengers meeting, later today. can you tell Cap, Steve?"
I sit up straight at that, my eyes snapping to his. "
"oh hey Steve." Clint says as I open the door to my room, crossing my arms.
"They finished early, and Nat told me Cap's uniform needs fixing." He tells me, noticeably sitting up straighter.
"I'm free for the next few days, so yeah, I'll need to sort some stuff out so I'll come over tomorrow?" I offer, smiling at him.
"wow this is.. really gross." I say, chewing a piece of the dry, overly salty meat.
"you were saying?" she sasses. Suddenly Iron Man drops down beside me, dodging a bullet as he lands.
"that chair looked so uncomfortable I was starting to get twitchy." he laughs, his hand resting on my arm. he flips it over, running his fingers over the skin of my wrist. "I can't believe I didn't notice." I look up, letting my hand capture his to still it before surging towards him, our lips meeting in a kiss that was all teeth, him slowly falling back onto the pillow. I move away after a moment, resting my weight on my elbows.
I storm out of the room, leaving the duffel on my bed and pulling my hood on. I sharply rap on Tony's door, the man pulling it open a few minutes later.
"Tony." I greet him, pouring myself a glass of water.
I sigh, quickly standing up to pace while I listen to them try and help him.
"Its no problem, I like being your friend." I laugh, wrapping my arms around his shoulder. he burys his head into my chest, a soft sob shaking through his body. I don't say anything, just run my fingers through his hair to calm him down.
"hey, I dare you to hide the coffee before Nat comes down." I say with a grin after he's made his coffee. He laughs, grabbing the coffee ground and hiding it in the back of the fridge.
"well she's not wrong." I say, smiling when I see how similar our positions are - curled in a ball, eyes everywhere but each other.
"Hi, Mr Happy?" I ask after dialling his number.
"okay - well I'm Steve Rogers." I say, taking a deep breath.
"well for me its only been a couple of years since the commandos." I tell her with a smile. "you haven't changed either. I'd bet you could still take down a bad guy with a bobby pin."
"sorry I'm late, long drive." I say, rushing into the meeting. thank god Fury hadn't arrived yet.
"He was worried about you, I think. He wants you to have a good time." she chuckles, taking the seat next to me. "to quote him, 'theres a lot of attractive men here that have been keeping an eye on him'" She laughs. I just roll my eyes at that, not really too sure what to think.
"well if you ever need someone to practice with I know Iron Man would be up for it, I also have some punching bags that can withstand Iron Man." Tony tells me with a grin, and I smile back.
"I haven't visited because we kissed and you know his track record - just barely better than Tony's was. also I have a severe lack of injuries from holding a whole damn building up, also I held a whole damn building up. how the fuck am I meant to explain that?" I say, raising my eyebrows right back at her.
"we um- we thought we were on my level. I guess we lost track of time." Tony explains, causing them to laugh. the door slides open and they step onto the communal level.
"yeah I was at the time." I say, raising my eyebrows. "it doesn't matter anyway. I moved on."
"I saw her all the time, she was always visiting Tony and so was I, so we naturally crossed paths. his dad worked a lot, but Peg always came over and bullied him into going drinking with the other vets. she did eventually move on, but I think she waited a really long time, Howard spent a good part of his life searching for you." He tells me, sighing. "and um- she's still here."
"So this is a good idea." Nat says as I shut my door, her deciding to just pack the stuff she has at mine, because she sort of claimed the room meant for 'Captain America'.
"yeah but I've got my old one on me. Sorry about that Tony quip earlier, I've just been spending too much time with Steve." I say, pushing myself faster as the building comes into view.
"oh hi Nat, just wanted to let you guys know that I've sorted out your uniforms, so come down whenever so that I can make sure everything is as it should be." Tony says.
"Imagine if it was the other way around." she says quietly. I deliberate for a second, before lowering myself onto a stair. "I'll be back for you in a bit."
"no I've been doing some extensive research trying to figure that one out." He laughs too, leaning back next to me. "the internet basically told me you were on anabolic steroids."
"okay just stop brooding, its really not a good look for you." Nat says as I walk out of my room, causing me to roll my eyes. I've learnt not to be surprised when shes found her way into my apartment, even though all my doors and windows are locked.
"asshole." I mutter.
"That was due to some personal problems that he would not appreciate me telling you about." I tell him, crossing my arms.
"oh yeah, sorry, forgot to tell you since you've been back." I say, remembering how he left for his house in India soon after my confession to Iron Man.
"Tony- I told him about what pepper said." I say, burying my face in my pillow so she doesn't see me cry.
"Steve wouldn't have minded, he probably enjoyed the chance to see more of you. Nat told me that he left her a very excited message." I chuckle, easily slipping into Captain America mode now.
"I'll take the chance." I say, standing up and following him into his bedroom.
"hey at least if things go sideways with Tony you can explore this whole Iron Man/Cap thing. I mean you'd have to keep your helmets on which would be a bummer.." She rambles on, her grin slowly getting bigger as she annoys me more.
"hey Nat, people are arriving so we're going to need all hands on deck without spangles here." Tony says through the door, causing both of our eyes to look over.
"yeah, I was part of the team that studied the ship." He responds, his eyebrows furrowed.
"yeah Cap's been keeping me posted. look Tony, why the hell are you even talking to me? you've been avoiding me like the plague for the last god knows how long, and now you come over here, chatting as if we're best mates?" I say, turning to face him for the first time since he sat down. I have to say, he's a mess. I mean obiously his appearance is flawless - Pepper would have his ass if it wasn't - but I can tell by the way he is sitting, by the empty glass in his hand that was nearly full a few minutes ago, that he's not okay."
"you know why." I say, avoiding his eyes. "you're one of my closest friends. you're smarter than this." I say quietly, placing the bottle down and leading him towards the sofa in the corner of the room. I gently push him so he falls onto it before sitting down next to him, wrapping my arm around his shoulder.
"fuckkkkk why did I decide on Steve Rogerson?" I sigh as I stand up, gaining me two laughs.
"Just wanted to see how you'd react." She tells me, sighing as she stretches her arms out. "And I got some good photos." I run over to her, making a grab for her phone. just in time she pulls it out of my way and locks it, grinning at me.
"Steve - hi. I thought you were in Brooklyn." He says, his voice jumping an octave.
"you're going downstairs in boxers and an undone shirt?" I laugh as I pull on some tracksuit bottoms.
"A few hours. I'll go and get you something to eat, if you'd like?" he offers, standing up.
Hes noticed too. He's been taking me out on dates a few times a week, giving me worried glances when I'm not looking. Tonight is was a private tour of an art gallery, us now having a few drinks in a bar near the tower.
yet. I- you already know me as someone else and things could get messy."
"oh my god, I don't even wanna think about that!" He says, throwing his hands over his face.
"So you just told him that you guys don't talk anymore?" He asks, raising his eyebrows.
"let me guess - its not good." I say, letting my shoulders sag.
"so you live here with Tony?" I ask after a moment, suddenly vary aware that we basically broke into this guys house.
"exactly! its a unicorn for fucks sake, lets just ride it somewhere or however it is that unicorns work." Iron Man says, walking towards the animal.
It was a bad idea.
"few fractured ribs and broken collarbone. nothing to write home about.
"Tony you aren't a nuisance, to be honest I spend too much time with Steve anyways - I tend to not sleep here too often, its mainly just where I keep all my stuff. please, don't worry about that sort of thing." I say, correcting my voice as it comes close to slipping back into Steve's.
"I'm sorry dude. I really am." He says, placing his hand on my shoulder before heading off, probably to find Natasha. I stay leaning against the bar, pretending to watch the crowd but really just watching Tony and the girl flirt. Tony's eyes meet mine every now and again, a not very convincing smile on his face. He seems different - more polite but less enthusiastic maybe.Â  About half an hour later a news reporter finds me.
"So things didn't work out between you and the girl?" I ask, softening my tone a little. He scoffs at that, opening one eye to smirk at me.
"somethings bothering you." I say halfway through our meal, after 10 minutes of silence from Tony.
"okay, thanks Tony for actually showing up, that was very kind of you." Fury says, nodding at Tony sarcastically. "you are very welcome." he responds with a grin.
"Mr Roger-son." JARVIS says, deliberately drawing out my name, causing me to chuckle.
"Captain, pleasure to meet you." Tony says, holding his hand out for me to shake after placing a piece of Nat's black widow outfit down.
"always had a crush on Steve Rogers as a kid." he says, leaning back against my shoulder.
The meeting overall went okay, It was basically just everyone throwing around ideas of how we can make the whole team thing work. We're all meeting with Tony Stark tomorrow at different times, just so he can look over our equipment and get our measurements.
"Yep." He says, drinking some more while adding more detail to the hologram. The drink the bottle slips from his grasp and I reach out to grab the bottle before it can smash before placing it down on the table behind me.
"what can I do for you this fine morning?" I ask, my voice deepened with sleep. Its weird - I'm using my Cap voice way more than my Steve voice nowdays, its almost becoming my natural voice. Its been a week or two since the basement, Tony moved into Iron Man's place and gave Iron Man and I his floor, which was odd because I had to act lost for a few days while I 'got my bearings'. Iron Man and I have basically became a married couple - Natasha likes to joke about it a lot. I mean I don't have a clue how dating works nowdays, so I've been taking him out for the dates I know - walks along the beach, picnics, that sort of thing.
"I don't know, I just got thinking. I miss my boyfriend, you know, and you remind me a lot of him." he says with a chuckle, moving to sit closer to me. "thanks for being my friend."
"I was handling it, you were meant to be covering Nat and the Hulk!" I tell him, turning to face him.
"your eye is so goddamn twitchy, just stay still!" she laughs, pinning my head down.
"Cap- wow you're
"past tense?" He asks, raising an eyebrow.
"see you both tomorrow I assume?" Nat says, winking as the door closes.
Chinese takeout containers scattered about the place and half of my uniform thrown on the floor.
"Steve, don't ignore me." She says, grabbing hold of my arm. "It went that badly, huh?"
"yeah, Tony, I loved you, then I loved Iron Man. I'm mainly just fucking confused right now." I admit, running my hand through my hair. Suddenly Tony pulls me into his arms, his head buried into my shoulder.
"okay, I'd better give you guys some space." She says as she stands up, stopping to place a hand on my shoulder before moving on.
"yeah thats probably it. its just weird, I'm not exactly your biggest fan, yet i'm being so open." he says, smiling.
"uh yeah okay I guess I could bring Steve, he stays in his apartment too much." I laugh, walking out his room.
"here- this will be more comfy." he tells me, throwing a balaclava style object at me, made of some breathable material. I wander into his en suite, pulling my hood off and replacing it with the hat. I walk back into his room to see that he has one on too.
"okay, if you even remember this." I chuckle, turning us over so he is sitting on the sofa.
"Captain." Hawkeye greets me, sending me a nod before sitting on the other side of Nat. Hawkeye and I have worked together a few times now - we're both technically agents of SHIELD, like Natasha, so we were assigned missions together a few times. we got on, but I guess its just a professional relationship. theres only so far you can go without knowing anything about the other person.
"hey Peg." I say as I walk in, placing the teas down and pulling my hood off.
"right. see you two later." I say opening the door.
"thats true, but you owe a hell of a lot to Iron Man." she says softly, causing me to fall silent. I know she's right, but I'm sure as hell not admitting that to her. "okay I'm done with this softly helping you bullshit, this has never been the way I work. You've got to get your head around that this is happening, Steve. What you need to do is hop in the shower, get into some Steve clothes, and get your ass downstairs. I'm going to go and chat to him, make sure he is alright."
the next morning I walk into a conference room, containing a big round table with Natasha sitting at the far end, her legs up on the table.
"I- didn't realise you felt that way." I say, shutting my eyes. "I do too, by the way, just thought that you didn't."
Tony is still sleeping when I get back into his room, so I pull off the clothes I put on for the benefit of any stray avengers, before climbing back into bed with him.
"If only America knew. you can keep you hat on, but I won't be able to do any upgrades there without either your head measurements or your hat." he tells me, turning around with a tape measure as I pull my top off.
"I'm glad. come on, we're meeting Clint for a drink."Â  she tells me, throwing my jacket at my head.
"yeah, okay." I say, letting her wrap me in a hug as the waterworks start again.
"Steve, that doesn't matter anymore. Look - Tony felt like shit for what he did to you. you need to tell him." she tells me, causing me to peep at her between my fingers.
"yeah sure." she sighs, pulling me into a firm hug. "you better not back out or I'll drag your naked ass out of that shower and down to him myself." I laugh at that, heading towards the bathroom and stripping out of my clothes. After my shower I stand there for a moment, before pulling my hood over my head and making my way downstairs. I quietly walk into Tony's room, Natasha's eyes meeting mine instantly.
I wake up suddenly, keeping my eyes closed and my body still as I figure out why I woke so suddenly. I soon feel it - a sharp poke on my cheek. my eyes immediately snap open and my hand comes up to grab the object responsible, Natasha quickly moving her hand out of my grasp.
"sorry, I didnt think before asking that one." Clint says, his voice dropping back into its normal register.
"Just remember that he doesn't know its you, okay?" she tells me, letting go of my shoulder. I wordlessly break out into a run again, stopping dead when I see him, pieces of the armour around him, Clint doing CPR.
"I know, its going to go bad, but what can I do?"
"if you say so." I sigh, holding my hand for him to use to stand up. "I have no clue how I'm meant to sneak you upstairs."
"Fuck. are you okay? what the hell were you thinking?" I ask, sitting up only to hit my head on something.
"do you guys just spend every second together or something?" I ask as I walk in, grabbing a seat next to them.
"I think I know who Hawkeye is, by the way." He tells me after a moment, turning his head sideways.
"you go for a shower, I'll sort this place out a bit then I'm giving you a haircut." she tells me, pulling me up off the sofa.
"well I felt weird about hopping into bed with a guy I had an unrequited crush on." I say causing him to laugh.
"what was that for?" Tony asks after a moment, a grin on his face.
"ah okay, i'll show up to talk to some fancy people. will I be wanted in my suit or in a normal suit?" I ask crossing my hands over my chest.
"Yes? who is this?" He asks over the phone, not seeming too worried about the fact that someone else is using Tony's phone.
what happened?"
"well I hoped that you would have had an idea, Man with the Plan. I mean you killed the red skull, a unicorn should be no problem." Nat says. grinning at me.
"okay, now I'm lost." Clint says, furrowing his eyebrows. "I'm guessing that was a joke, I just can't figure out whats funny there." Clint says, his eyes slightly glassy.
hadn't have gone against what we had planned. I mean, technically that someone was me, but I saw a way to rescue the hostages.
"lock the doors, J." Tony says as we step onto his level.
"don't worry about it, cry for as long as you need." I say, putting superstore on, a TV show we've been watching together.
"Tony I'm seeing someone else." I say, straightening my back as I hold Natasha's arm tighter. "have a good evening." I say as we slip past him, finally letting out a breath when we hit the elevator.
"well if I'm ridiculous, what does that make my boyfriend?" He asks, mirroring my actions after pressing the button.
"How?" he whispers, which intrigues me slightly. this isn't a side of Tony that I've ever seen - he's always had a slightly jokey overtone to everything he's said. I don't respond, not really understanding the question, but instead I let one of my hands slide up his chest to wrap around the back of his neck, tangling in his hair. his breath hitches as he moves in, gently pressing his lips to mine. In the background I hear the ding of the elevator doors opening, but it barely gets registered in my brain. he pulls away, both of us catching our breaths.
"uh- well not a lot really, just work." I mutter, keeping my head forward.
"mmm its an option." he says, raising his eyebrows before sending me a grin.
"Truth."
"oh- shoot I picked up Steve's phone." I say quickly, putting it back in my pocket.
"Can't believe you've been sleeping on my couch." Tony says from where he's watching me.
"I'll go find Clint." Nat says, before shutting the door behind her.
"do what?" he asks, looking up at me with an innocent look on his face.
"If you have to go to it, ill go to it. anyways, it won't be so bad, at least I'll get to spend some more time with you?" I say, pulling a belt through my dress trousers. Tony just smiles at me, before shaking his head.
"Tony." I mutter against his lips, pulling away slightly to smile at him. "you're drunk."
"oh yeah sure, I'll message him and let him know you dropped it off, he'll be glad to have it back." I tell him, an easy smile on my face.
