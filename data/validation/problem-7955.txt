“What PJ did?  Dick move,” Darcy agreed, and Harris stood up.
Steve's eyes slid shut.  “Buck says a lot of things,” he said, his voice gentle now.  He lowered Tony back to the bed, and crouched down in front of him.  “When I was a kid, yeah, I had bad lungs.  I had bad everything.”  He tried to smile.  “I got sick a lot.  But I'm not a kid anymore”  He spread his arms wide.  “I got better. Look at me, Tony.  I'm fine.”
DJ reached behind him.  “Also a cookie.”  He held up a gift wrapped disk the size of a frisbee.
“He left.  Half an hour ago,” Pepper said.  “I placed a call to his precinct, asking if they’d be needing him back today, or in the immediate future.”  She exhaled.  “The response I received was that they had no plans to reassign him.”
Trip looked from him to the man, eyebrows raised.  He sighed.  “Yes,” he agreed.  “We’ll be bringing our own witnesses.  Do you take cash?”
“Good.  I’ll bring them to the workshop.”  Phil paused.  “You’re helping with the laundry?”  DJ nodded.  “Did you see the Johnny Cash shirt?  And the one with the-” He made a gesture with one hand.  “I think it’s a manatee.  Or it used to be a manatee.  Ten years ago.  When it was legible and the shirt wasn’t threadbare.”
Clint shrugged.  “They won’t call the cops, at least.”
Smiling to himself, he headed back across the lobby towards the doors.  Outside the frosted glass, he could see the car still waiting at the curb, and his footsteps accelerated.
Steve handed over the envelope, and Strange took it, the watch disappearing from his hand.  He slipped the letter into his vest.  “I’ll make sure he gets it immediately,” he said.  “And I’ll be back in the morning, with another update.”
Tony pressed a hand to his face.  “Jay, I do not give a damn about the china.  Did he break any bones?”
Phil looked back down at his tablet.  "Because you need all the good press you can get," he said.
“You okay?”
“Get them to the streetcar before I’m stuck with them,” Tony said.  To the boys, he added, “Have we stuffed our pockets with all the candy we can carry?”  Laughter and a chorus of ‘yes’ answers made him smile.  “Good.  Now, be good for Officer Rogers.”
O'Brien huffed out a breath.  "Good choice, Rogers."  He sank into his chair, picked up a folder from the desk in front of him.  "And as a reward for your obedience today, you get to run a personal errand for the mayor."  He held the folder out to Steve, his fingers gripping it a little too hard.
“I hate asparagus,” Peter said.
“Occasionally,” Rogers said. He smiled. “Don't worry. This plan's just a little less dangerous.”
“So this was our last ditch attempt to keep him from trying to find out what was happening for himself,” Bobbi said.  “If we come back empty handed tonight, he’ll be the one following you next time, and I don’t think you want that.”  She was so close that he could feel the heat of her body.  “Do you?”
Val gave her brother a look.  "Really.  You think you made progress?"  She pushed a strand of pale hair back behind her ear.  It promptly slipped back in her face, and she made a sound of annoyance.
“You like to drink alone,” she said, pulling his hand away, “because then you can tell yourself that you’re the only one you’re hurting.”
Steve twisted around, going up on his knees on the couch, bringing himself face to face and eye to eye with Tony.  Tony blinked at him, confusion sweeping over his face, and Steve leaned in.  “Why didn’t you-” He took a deep breath, and saw Tony’s eyes drop to his mouth.  “You didn’t.”
DJ, still lying flat on his back, thrust his hands in the air.  “AGAIN!”
“Good, are we all here?” Tony asked, as everyone settled down.  “Roll call, Cap, do we have the whole team?  Or did you adopt someone else when I was at the office yesterday?”
“I'm going to leave,” Tony said, gesturing behind him.  “I'm just going to, you don't need me here for this, I don't think I have to-”
Steve shook his head.  “Nothing to thank me for,” he said, taking a seat on the edge of the bed again.  He studied Tony’s sleeping face, loving him so much it hurt.  “I should never have left.”  He shoved a hand through his hair, frustration tearing through him.  “Or maybe I never should’ve come back.”
“Because it’s not right,” Steve said, quiet and sure.  “Because no one deserves to get gunned down in the street in front of-”  He shook his head.  “It’s not right, and it shouldn’t happen, and I-”  He met Tony’s eyes.  “I won’t let it happen.”
“If you're not regretting this already, you're not paying attention,” Bruce said.
"But if I do that, how will you possibly learn to keep your opinions to yourself?" Steve told him.  "You're going to come over and help me paint."
"I know," Sam said.  He crossed the room and lowered himself into the chair next to the bed, facing Tony.  He folded his hands on his lap.  "I know you don't.  I know you're stressed, and I know you're not comfortable with dealing with this kind of shit."
Steve exhaled.  “It wasn’t my best,” he agreed, his arms relaxing by stages, giving Tony enough room to breathe without relinquishing his hold entirely.  “We did a little drinking, did we?”
“Lock it,” Tony whispered as Steve headed towards the stairs.
Stark pointed a finger at her.  "No."
“We’ll end up fighting it in a week if you do,” Carol said.  Jan gaped at her, and Natasha made a silent ‘one’ hashmark in the air.
“Yes, but he’s delusional,” Tony pointed out.  “I’m just lying.”
Everything hurt.
"Waxing the floor," Stark continued, his hands braced on his narrow hips.  His head tipped back, the long curve of his neck freckled with plaster dust.  "Building chairs from scratch.  Weaving a rug-"
She looked up, her eyes catching Tony's.  She stood, holding a hand out to the boy.  “Mr. Stark, may I introduce DJ.  He'll be staying with us for the next week."
DJ pushed out of his arms, scrambling down to sit next to him on the couch.  Tony offered him the cup, and this time he took it, wrapping both hands around it.  He took a drink, letting the cup linger against his lips, as if that could ward off any further questions.
He turned a corner and paused, waiting for Steve to draw even with him.  “For now, Captain Danvers has you and Barnes sticking to the main square, and the markets.  Stay to the patrols you’re assigned.  Some of our more…” His jaw worked.  “Difficult residents need a bit more of a diplomatic hand than I’d expect you to have right now.”
He stopped, turning back to the bench.  "We've got an educational proposal on file with the state.  We're home schooling him."
He hefted one of the brown paper wrapped packages.  "Thanks, but I have plenty."
“I can see that.  Clint has poor impulse control where gingerbread is involved.”
The clerk whisked it off the counter.  “We will bill you, Captain Rogers.”
"No.  I am sure you are concerned about him and his well being, but you also simply accept that he is as he is.  At the moment, I do not believe he has control over his physical state, and the lack of control has made an already stressful situation worse.  He needs reassurance, not the additional stress that comes with admitting something is wrong to sir or Steve."
“Are you…”  Steve resisted the urge to bury his face in his pillow again.  “Satisfied?”
“It’s fine,” Clint said.  He squinted at the menu that was pinned to the board beside the pantry.  “Mrs. Parker keeps us stocked with the basics.  A coin or two is well appreciated, but that’s not the first workman who’s taken his bonus in rice and flour.”
Tony stared at him.  “Why.”  Steve didn’t say anything, and Tony lunged for him, his hands grabbing for the front of Steve’s shirt, dragging him down.  “Why are you so determined to get yourself killed, you damned idiot?  Why won’t you just GO?”  The final word was a barely contained howl.
“Actually, its purpose is for containment and extraction,” Gyrich said.  “We have clearance.  Stand down, and let it do its job.”
Steve kissed him again, and Tony knew he was only doing it to distract him, and he didn't care.  “Come with me,” Steve whispered.
DJ looked up at her.  Then down at the first floor.  “Didn’t you just-”  He stopped, not sure how to verbalize ‘fall through the floor.’
“You’ve got a lot of opinions for someone who, you know, doesn’t have kids,” Tony said into his cup.  Clea smiled at him, just a little, and he stilled.  “Unless…  You do have kids.”  He set his coffee cup down.  “Do you have kids?  Is this-  Did I just make this weird, or weirder, do you-”
“Harris,” Clint called.
Steve leaned in.  “Tony.  Will you do me the honor of a dance?”
Bobbi shrugged, the fabric of her coat rippling like a wave.  “Mostly, I’m out,” she agreed.
“No.” Steve twisted around, setting the shield on the table.  “No.  This is-” He shook his head.  “This-  This doesn’t leave Wakanda.  This isn’t meant to be in my hands.”
Steve nodded again.  “All right,” he said.  He turned to Jan, his smile taking on a puckish wickedness.  “Miss Van Dyne.  Always a pleasure.”
Steve looked down at the bowl, surprised to find it empty.  “No, I’m full.”  He picked it up both bowls and carried them to the sink.  “It was good, though.”  He glanced at Clint.  “What was it?”
Steve let out his breath in something approaching a laugh.  “I’m not much of a fan myself, right now,” he said, his voice raw, and Tony reached back over his shoulder, cupping his cheek in one hand.  Steve turned towards his hand.  “How’re we doing?”
“Of course you do,” she said, but she was smiling as she took a bite of her sandwich.  Her eyes fluttered shut, her cheeks flushing as she chewed.  “Of course you do.”
“He’s hard of hearing and he works in a completely dark kitchen?” Rhodey asked.
She smiled back.  “I am sorry, it was not my intention to intrude upon you without your permission or without warning.  I just…”  She took a deep breath.  “Forget that you cannot hear my footsteps as I approach.”
Tony caught his chin, tipping his head up.  He was smiling, and Tony loved that smile.  He leaned in, brushing his lips against Steve’s.  “We’re getting there,” he whispered back, and wasn’t at all surprised when Steve tipped backwards onto the bed, pulling Tony down with him.
Clint covered the phone with one hand.  “I’m working here,” he said, and went back.  “Of course he’s not going to say yes, Pepper, have you met me?  But-” He hopped over the back of the couch, avoiding Tony’s grasping hands and knocking throw pillows in all directions.  “Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained, that’s a good one.  I go with ‘fuck it, what’s the worst that can happen?’”
“What are you wearing?”
“The market’s open from sun up to sun down.  Vendors show up when they can, leave when they’re done for the day.  Most spots are inherited, passed on in family lines.  Everyone knows where their place is, and they don’t need us to set the boundaries; if someone steps out of line, the rest’ll put them in their place.”
“Right,” Steve said, because otherwise, that was just going to sit there. “Okay. Right. I can-” He frowned down at the ends of his tie. “This is-”
“Or, and this is just a thought, you could get up now and we can take a shower,” Steve offered.
And then, he was gone.
"How long does this go on?" the significantly more hung-over Tony holding the phone asked.  He sounded resigned.
“We're clear,” Coulson said.  “Hold position as we secure the scene.”
“I live in the dorms, man,” Eli said.  “Distance is the best way to handle it.”  He spread his hands wide. “A lot of distance.”
“This is just asking for paparazzi photos,” Tony said from the doorway, and Steve tipped his head back, squinting against the sunlight.
Steve held up the wooden spoon, his hand cradled under it to catch any drips.  "Try this," he said, and Tony opened his mouth without even thinking about it.
“So you weren’t there, hush, we’ll get to you later,” Tony said.  “So.  Had a drink.  Talked to Thor.”
“Traitor,” Tony mumbled under his breath.  He turned his attention back to Clea, already regretting having closed his work.  He needed something to occupy his hands.  And his head.  “So.  Cake.  That’s-”  He shook his head.  “That’s new.”  His fingertips rattled against the front of the arc reactor.  “Is there a reason for cake?”
Tony winced.  “Right.  Right.”  He gave his head a brisk rub.  “And now I'm grateful that we included a door directly into the closet from the master bath.”
“We’re not going to fight,” Rogers said.
“No,” he said, holding up his hands.  “No, we're not-”
“Yes, as we all know, you are the only one allowed to run naked through the halls before five,” May said, her voice tart, and Tony grinned at her.
“He doesn't,” Eli said.  He rolled his eyes, but he and his grandfather moved as a single unit, smooth and practiced.  “I get to wash dishes.  I get to wash a lot of dishes.”
Steve's face felt like it was on fire. “Billy-”
Steve groaned, burying his face in his arms.  “Right.”
Clint sighed.  “Yeah.  I kind of thought that'd be your answer.”
“You are quite welcome, sir,” Jarvis said, slipping out of the room.
“Someone’s already gone,” the boy said, looking down at the man.  He looked quesy.  “An’ the manager called, from the house phone.  They’ll come, right soon.”
Tony sank his fingers into the quilt, and what he thought was Steve’s shoulder underneath.  ‘Thank you.  I’ll…  Eat those.  Both of those.  You can-” Steve shifted, and Tony was dragged across the bed with him.  “You can leave it.”
“Okay, then,” DJ agreed, giggling as he pulled away.  His eyes were red, and he scrubbed a hand over his nose.  “Sorry.”
“How did they talk you into it?” Jesse asked.
“No.” Tony stepped aside as Steve crouched down, pulling his shield out from under the bed.  “They lit the boat house on fire, probably as a distraction, but no injuries, other than Peter.”
For some reason, Steve found himself smiling.  “What, are you the only one allowed to have secrets?” He stood.
Tony grinned, and set a plate down on the back of the couch.  “I just came down to steal another cream puff,” he said.  He reached out, his thumb rubbing against Steve’s cheek, and Steve’s eyes fluttered shut, his breath catching in his throat.  “Sorry, I managed to get chocolate…” He pulled away, and Steve’s eyes shot open in time to see him straighten up.  “I blame the cream puff, let me get a napkin-”
“We don't know,” Coulson said.  “SHIELD doesn't take minors into custody, we were securing the scene.  By the time we had everything under control, she was gone.”
Tony opened his mouth.  Closed it.  Reached for his coffee cup and settled back against Steve's chest.  “Well?” he said with a ghost of a smile.
“I’m very proud of you.  Everyone.  Be like Parker.  Go away so I can saw my feet off in peace.” No one moved.  Tony sighed.  “What is wrong with you?”
"It's not so fond of you, either, buddy," he said.  He maneuvered Tony onto the couch.  "But I love you both, so guess what?"
Steve’s hand rested on the shield’s rim.  “It was a gift.”
“But as she was not there to protect him, I went instead,” Shuri said.  “I knew she’d want me to.”
He remembered the city.  He remembered the looming buildings that hung out over the narrow streets, and the small stretches of common ground and the old wells.  He remembered the way the wind swept down the central streets, sending leaves skittering against the cobblestones.  He remembered the way that the sun caught the windows of the stately old buildings, of the cathedral and the grand mansions, of the university and lower school buildings.  He remembered the clatter and call of the market streets, the faint smell of fresh vegetables and damp dirt.
“Hey, man, don't hate me because I'm practical,” Sam said.  “Hate me because I'm handsome, clever and suave.”
“He can’t go back,” Tony said.  His chest ached, in a way that had nothing to do with bullets.  “Whoever’s after me, if they didn’t know about him before?”  He met Jarvis’ eyes.  “They do now.”
“Because I need to know if they’re coming back for him,” Tony said.  He set the pawn back down.  “So what do you mean by ‘long gone?’  Did they leave him, or are they…”
“Of course Ty,” Tony bit out, tucking his shirt into his pants, as Pepper smoothed his collar down.  “It’s been, what, a whole month since the last time that the deans had to call him out on the carpet.”
“You say that, but I’m pretty sure that you don’t,” she said.
“You'll have tea and toast,” Steve said, and Tony stared at him, betrayed.  Steve smiled.  “Keep that down and we'll see if you can have one.”
His mother rolled her eyes.  “Bucky likes that tea of hers, thick as treacle it is.”  She turned her attention back to the soup.  “I’m sure I wouldn’t know, Stevie, but I do know that it’s bad luck to speak of them.”
Then Val reached out, touching his hand, and DJ realized that he was clutching the fabric of his shirt so hard that his knuckles were white.  “It's okay if you can't,” she said, and when she smiled, her face scrunched up, all chubby cheeks and bright teeth.  “We'll figure it out.”
“Well?” Steve repeated, polishing an apple on his sleeve.
“You’re trying to prove a point, aren’t you?” Tony asked.  He pressed a hand to his eyes.  “Steve-”
"I don't-" Steve said, as Rhodey handed him a jar.
“Wait, what-” Steve, caught in the act of drying his hands on a kitchen towel, stared at him.  “What porn?”  Tony held up the slim volume, and Steve grinned at him.  “Okay, 'Leaves of Grass' has some erotic leanings, but-”
“It’s hard to separate the rumors from the facts, but I’m used to that,” Bobbi said.  “Men who trade in bad behavior like to inflate their victories, and their enemies’ misfortune.” She pulled a sheet of newsprint from the folder.  She held it up in front of her, her chin tipped a curious angle.  “And it’s hard to find anyone who’s willing to talk, outside of the bad elements.
Steve huffed out a breath, and it sounded almost like a laugh.  “Right.”
“But if I’m your-”  Steve stopped, his mouth working.  “Your…  Your partner, for the lack of a better term, then you need to listen to me.  You need to take what I say into account, Tony, or we’re never going to get anyway.”
“You don't know where your boyfriend lives.”
“Generally not where I come from, either, but yes, I definitely appreciate your sense of self-preservation.” Jarvis paused.  “I’m sorry to ask you to act as his driver.  While I appreciate Happy’s finer points, he would…”  His voice trailed away.
He absolutely could control this.
Something like a laugh forced its way past the lump in his throat.  “No.  He doesn’t.”  Tony looked up, and Steve spread his arms wide.  “I can’t do anything.  I’m…”  His hands fell back to the side, the slack emptiness of his fingers somehow worse than any fist he could’ve made.  “I can’t do anything for him.”
“It's a lot easier to ignore you when you're yelling at me,” he said.
“Coulson, or Rogers?” Tony asked.  “The former, I have no idea, and I’m happier not knowing.”  He let his eyes float closed, finding his way through the interior of the prototype by touch.  “As to the other…”
Tony caught himself grinning at it.  Right.  Steve.
“I’m not very good,” DJ said, popping the plastic cover off of his sushi.  “At all.”
DJ took a deep breath.  “Good,” he said, smiling at Tony, because his dad always smiled back at him, always, and even if 'good' was a lie before, that smile made it true. “Dinner soon?”
“We don’t know,” Steve said, his heart in his throat, not wanting to hope, not daring to hope.  Natasha, still at the curb, straightened up.  Billy, who was sitting on the hood of the car, slid off.  “Billy, run and tell Happy we’re going to my place.”
“I can be inappropriately destructive if I want to be,” Jan said, and Steve realized he was laughing.
“I'm okay,” Clint said, from his face  down position in the mats.  “Let's do this.”
Pepper braced a hand on his chest.  “I love you,” she whispered back.  “And I will not let you be killed without a fight.”
“Yeah, and you ain’t paying for ‘em, so whatta you care?” Happy shot back.
Tony kissed him, hard and fast, and Steve leaned into it.   When they broke apart, Tony leaned his forehead against Steve’s, his eyes closed, concentrating on the feeling of Steve’s breath against his lips.  “I’m scared,” he admitted, the words thin and soft, and Steve kissed him.
Steve pressed a hand to his face.  “Buck…”
“They absolutely were.”
Tony’s teeth flashed in a sharp grin.  “No need to reset it.  We’ll play the pieces, just as they are.”
“I got much bigger battles to fight than if he wants to watch Star Wars,” Clint said.  “Like, seriously, Cap, the number of hills I'm willing to die on are pretty numerous, but Star Wars was not one of them.”
“Surrender,” the robot said, and there was no second request, it just wrenched the bus off of the pavement, throwing it in the direction of the fleeing girl.
Tony handed him the case of slides.  “Nine million holiday parties, having to explain to everyone you’ve ever met and a bunch of people that you never have that your significant other is no longer significant.  Returning presents.  Avoiding any and all ‘happy couple’ ads, which are completely impossible to avoid.  Knowing-”
“StarkSearch?” Sitwell finished for her.  “Travis was robbed.”
Jarvis glanced at her.  “He makes a valid point, and as long as he stays in the house-”
“Do the ceremony?”  Trip nodded, flipping the screen around for him to see.  “Sure, if you want.”
Her head tipped to the side.  “Has anyone ever told you that you look like-”
Tony's eyebrows arched.  “Now I want to know what-”
Tony buried his face behind his tumbler.  “Yes, but it SEEMED like it would be, and-”
"He okay with this?" Steve asked.
Tony sucked in a breath, his white teeth clenched beneath tight lips.  “I need your help,” he repeated.
“Clint’s probably fallen asleep in the shower,” Tony said, serving himself an egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms.  He forked up a bite and considered it for a moment before he popped it in his mouth.  “Lewis is still getting dressed.  Harris is getting fitted.”
“Ready?”
"You're late," Ed said, his hands already dancing over the controls over the machine.
Tony wanted to punch something.  “Right.  Let’s go.”
“Better than most of what was floating around New York during prohibition,” Steve said.
“Make us proud, Rogers,” Carol said.
Steve leaned in, pressing a very light kiss on Tony’s lips.  “All of them,” he whispered, and Tony arched up into him, kissing him back with all the force he could manage.  Steve kissed him back, his arms wrapped tight around Tony’s waist.  But as the kiss deepened, one hand slipped up, to rest just over the tattoo, and Tony smiled against his mouth.
"I think that's her way of telling us we talk too much," Tony said to Rhodey.

Tony seemed to be struggling to focus on him.  "Why?" he said at last.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I'm doing a dramatic reading of this,” Tony said.  “Dinner entertainment.  We're going to-” Steve snatched the book out of his hand, and Tony rocked back in his chair, laughing so hard that his stomach hurt.  “Oh my God, Steve!”
She leveled a look at the room. “No kissing unless the bells are rung.  Got it?”
“That's immaterial,” Pepper said to Tony. “I'd never have to fire Steve, so...” She smiled. “He's not the one I'm worried about.”
“My house, my people, my mistake,” Tony said, cutting him off with ruthless efficiency.  “What's wrong with the room?”
Steve dragged his spoon through his soup.  “And if he's wrong?”
“It's lovely,” Pepper said, without missing a beat.  “You should consider shorter suitjackets to really show it off.”
“Yes, well, he sat on the staircase for an excessive amount of time, waiting for you to come and say good-bye, which, due to your exceptionally poor upbringing, you didn’t bother to do,” Jarvis said..  “I made your excuses, but I will not be doing that again; let us see if you can’t improve your manners before he returns as well.”
“No, it’s-”  Tony pressed a hand to his face as Steve started to laugh.  “It’s time for you to open your presents, Deej.”
Pepper stood, her hands braced on her desk.  “You are playing with fire right now, you know that, don’t you?  Between Rogers and now Washington-”
For a moment, there was stillness.  Then, slowly, Agatha turned to look at him, her expression incredulous.   Harris stared back at her, his hands locked on the broom.  “Excuse me?” she said, her voice rising to a dangerous pitch.
“Not having sex on your front porch, Tony,” Steve muttered into Tony’s throat, his mouth hot and desperate.
“You can ask,” DJ said, setting the juice box down on the table.  He went to pull back then stopped, one finger coming out to nudge the juice box into perfect alignment with the edge of the table.  Satisfied, he sat back.  “If you want.”  He paused, his head tipped to the side.  “Reality is more…  Flexible than you might think.”
If Steve didn’t know better, he would’ve thought he was meeting her brother.
“Lord knows I am, after a meltdown,” Tony said.  “But you want me to talk to him?”
“We can string some,” he offered Tony, leaning up against Steve’s side.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Know what I’m going to do?” Tony pointed the fork at him.  “I’m going to go down to that butler’s pantry of yours and take a prybar to every single dish you have squirreled away down there.  You’ll get up tomorrow morning and it’ll just be a pile of china shards.  See what you do then.”
Hiding a smile, Strange held out a hand to Harris.  “Stephen Strange.”
“You’re trying to get him to marry you just to annoy Mr. Stane?” Steve asked.
“So, we’re buying the Ironette costume, right?” Darcy asked Clint and Tony decided he didn’t want to be here any more.
Tony met his eyes. “You, I trust.”
“Wasn’t my idea,” Harris grumbled, his cheeks pink.
“Isn't that...”  Steve sank down onto the bench.  “Isn't that putting pressure on him?  We have to do this.  We agreed.  I can't just manipulate things like that.”
DJ reached out, his fingers peeling away a chunk of the bread crust.  Shaking his head, Steve went back to his meal.   He ate, not enough to fill the gnawing emptiness in his belly, but he was used to that, too.  He was used to managing just enough to keep himself going, just enough to take the edge off.
Clint stared at the wall, not quite able to make sense of that.  "Smaller."
“Get a move on, boy!”  Isaiah’s voice echoed through the closed door.  “You planning on sleeping all damn day?”
Tony made a hissing noise, burrowing down into his blankets.  "Just water."
“There’s a champagne bottle through the tv set,” Rhodey told him.  “You can see that, right?  The-” He gestured at the television.  “The hole.”
Steve resisted the urge to put his head between his knees.  Or just cry.
She made a slight humming noise under her breath.  “Right,” she said, spreading the pages out.  “You see, there’s been a man causing a great deal of problems for the various crime families lately.  It’s been a real topic of conversation, obviously, in the back rooms and the back alleys.  Because they’ve been playing the game the way it’s always been played.  They’ve been paying off the right men.  Politicians.  Ward bosses.  Beat cops.  A little cash in the right hands, and everyone’s supposed to look the other way.”
“You've a bit of a cowlick,” she said, and Steve reached up, trying to flatten it down.  She laughed.  “Don't you worry, Officer, it's quite charming on you.”  She looked at Jarvis, the two of them sharing a silent communication.  “Let's get you something to eat.”
“Except he’s not?”
Steve knew he was tensing up, and couldn't seem to do anything about it.  “Well, that is definitely a lie.”
Steve nodded, a sharp dip of his chin.  "We're no longer friends," he said, and Sam laughed.
Thor shook his head.  “Dance, I can, and have.  And would be pleased to show you how we dance in Asgard.  But the dances of which they speak-”  He waved a hand at the others.  “Of these, I am ignorant.”
Tony looked up.  “Sorry,” he said, as Mrs. Arbogast came bustling through the door to the dining room, wiping her hands on her apron.
“I got a bone to pick with both, so…”  Steve shrugged.  “He’s behind the tree.”
“I appreciate that.  No sarcasm.  I...”  Clint sighed.  “I really appreciate that.”
“Present,” he said, half raising a hand.
DJ nodded again, his chin set at a stubborn angle.  "Yes."
“And this seemed like, it seemed like a stress that we didn't need.”  Tony leaned back in his chair, graceful and relaxed.  “But she was right.”  He stopped, his eyes cutting towards Steve.  “Don't ever tell her I said that.”
“I really hate you,” Harris said.  “And all of this is going back.”
Laughing, Obie set the cup down.  “Tony.”
“Don’t get me wrong, he’s not really my type, but I can see the appeal,” Jan said.  She leaned back, bracing her hands on the bench.  “And more than just sleeping with him, you…” Her head tipped to the side, her eyes considering.  “You like him.”
“Or the garage,” Tony said.  “But Rhodey and Happy checked every one of the cars.  And there's no way he got past the locks on the workshop.”
But when he was safely outside, past the kitchen garden, down past the wall and halfway to the lower fields, he unwrapped it.  Two thick slices of bread, spread with a soft, yielding cheese were nestled in the center of the fabric, tucked alongside a few small pieces of chicken.  Nothing like the feast that had been spread out on the dining room table, but far more than he was allowed, under most circumstances.
The light dipped and swirled in front of him, and his head twisted to follow it.  “Come along now.”  The voice was amused.  “Let’s see what she has to say about you.”
“That’s our boy,” Bobbi said.  “I can swear in six languages, how about you?”  DJ thought about that, then held up four fingers.  Bobbi grinned at him, her legs thrown out in front of her, her cheek braced on one hand.  “This kid’s the best.”
“Is this pre-marital counseling or something?” the blonde asked.
“Right.  Let's see if it's ironed.”
She stared straight ahead, her jaw a sharp, hard line.  “Last month.”

The bed had been half made, and Steve lowered Tony down, getting him into a sitting position on the edge of the mattress so he could steady him with one hand while he pulled the linens out of the way.  “Okay, here we are,” he said, and Tony's eyelashes fluttered.  For an instant, he stared up at Steve with eyes that refused to focus.  Steve smiled at him, affection sweeping over him in a wave.  “Bedtime, Tony.”
"Wait," Jess asked, holding up a hand.  "This is a kink, isn't it?"  She stared at Steve, her eyes narrowed.  “Are you...  Trying to seduce your husband?”
“Are we going to get him back in time for the actual party?” Jan asked Pepper.  She didn’t sound overly concerned about the answer.
Or maybe he did, and he was just used to seeing himself look half dead.
“You,” Tony said, and Steve blinked at him.  Tony blinked back.  “I mean, whatever you don't want.”
She shrugged.  “Passable,” she said, and he made a pained noise.  Natasha struggled against a smile.  “You’re very good,” she amended, reaching out to pat him gently on the head.
Instead, he just leaned forward, and he knew he shouldn't do it.  He knew that.  But Tony met him halfway, their lips meeting with a surety, with a grace, that had been missing from their dance.  This was muscle memory, too, for all that he'd done it only a few times.
“Right,” Clint said, and he sounded as tired as Tony felt.  “Look, none of these are what you’d call ‘discreet,’ so we’re heading back.”
“He was in a mood,” Tony said.  “And wasn’t concerned about the rest of us knowing.”
Tony grinned.  “I do have a gift,” he said.
Steve’s eyes slid shut.  “I’m sorry,” he said.
Tony leaned back into the shelter of Steve's chest, a hand braced on the edge of the workbench.  "He had a code, but you didn't let him in?"
“I think that would help, actually.”
He didn't have time to finish the sentence.  The robot turned, its massive frame swaying as it twisted on its axis, feet crashing down on the street with sudden, alarming force.  And just like that, all semblance of slow, awkward movement was gone, and the thing was charging forward.
DJ looked back at Jarvis.  “Hi,” he said, his face relaxing into a broad smile, and Tony choked on a laugh.
“It was between a diorama where you could pretend to punch a Doctor Doom cosplayer and a reproduction of the UN's original Declaration of Universal Human Rights, which you could sign with a dry erase marker,” Tony said, his voice cutting.  “It was-”  He cupped a hand over his forehead.  “It was behind a guy making BALLOON ANIMALS from CONDOMS.”
The doctor stared at him.  “Are...  You threatening me?”
“Do not invite-”
Steve choked on a laugh.  “I,” he said, his teeth flashing in a vicious smile, “do not work for you.”  He stalked up the stairs, each step driving his frustration higher.  “Get away from the windows.”
“Well, if you get turned out, I can call in a favor or two, see if I can’t get you a job sweeping the streets or moving cargo down on the docks,” Steve mused.  “You think-”
“Or like he’s writing papers for classes he’s not attending,” Tony said, his voice taking on an edge.  “And has nothing to go on other than your notes.  For whatever they’re worth.”  He saluted Ty with his cup.  “And trust me.  They’re not worth much.”
Pepper leaned in, her spectacles catching the pale light.  “You’re late,” she said, in a bare whisper.  Her face was pale, her freckles standing out like bruises on her skin.  She was hugging a bundle of cloth to her chest.  “Dinner-”
“I got a milkshake at every place we stopped.”  Peter sounded miserable.  “Every single place.”
“Now, that’s possible,” Sam said, his head bobbing.  Steve yanked his door shut and started up the hallway, and Sam fell into step with him, head still tipped down towards his phone.  “Also possible that you were deliberately ditching me.”
Trip left the card on the desk.  “Oooookay,” she said, drawing the word out.  “I’m just going to take your word for it and say, okay, we can’t get a marriage license, we can’t register it with the state.”
“You-” Clint pointed the mill at Steve.  “Are a wise man.”  He gave the mill a couple of quick twists, and tossed it back onto the counter.  “I hadn’t learned that particular lesson yet.”
Jarvis ignored him.  “And yet, I was created to provide you with the help you required, not the help you wanted.”
Steve leaned back against the side of his truck, trying to take some of the pressure off of his aching feet.  “God, I wish,” he said, exhausted.  He leaned his head back, squinting up at the pale blue sky.  The sun was barely up, the skyline lit with a golden glow, and he tried to take pleasure in that.
Tony's back was right up against Rogers' chest as he leaned over Tony's shoulder.  Each word seemed to vibrate through his frame, and Tony felt his heartbeat accelerate.  "Uh," he managed, and that wasn't helpful at all.  He felt Rogers' body shift against his, and he shoved himself upright.  "Fix it.  I'm trying to fix it."
“Thank you,” DJ said, picking three petals from the pile and tossing them in Harris’ direction.
"He sustained a series of hairline fractures throughout his system," Bruce said.  "So he looks bad."  His eyes fluttered, hard and fast. "His body is focusing on fixing the worst of it, there's an internal triage going on, he's protecting his core, his organs, his skeleton are getting the attention.  The surface stuff, it, uh, it looks bad, but it's all surface."
Clint looked back down at the main floor just in time to see Steve throw his hands in the air.  “I’m going to find something more useful to do than argue with you.”
"You got here first and you went in alone, and they want to know who your date is," Tony said.  "Let me guess, you got here, glared at them, and plowed through the front door."  Steve stared in sullen silence at the chair opposite him.  Tony sighed.  "Right.  So.  They're going to wait here, until your date shows up."
Pepper gave him a look, so it was clear that he wasn't meeting expectations, but she should be used to that.  She gestured behind Tony.  "This is Jarvis," she said.  "He is in charge here."
At the front door, Steve was talking in hushed tones with an older black man.  The old man leaned heavily on a cane, his broad shoulders hunched a bit with age.  His head was bare, showing off his close cropped, bright white hair, but a red, white and blue scarf was tied in a jaunty knot at his throat.  Behind him, a young man, probably barely out of his teens, was leaning up against the doorframe, his arms crossed over his chest, a faint smile creasing his wide, handsome face.  He was wearing a matching scarf, but his was just thrown over his shoulders, the ends trailing down over his chest.
Steve scowled down at his soup.  “They shouldn’t.”
Tony considered her over the rim of his cup.  “That-” he said, pointing it at her.  “Is a lie.”
“That is both incorrect and also not what you wanted to hear at this moment.”  Jarvis stopped.  “Is it?”
“However,” Steve aaid,  “I am smart enough to know that we’re going in circles.”
DJ nodded.  “Be safe.”
Steve turned back to Tony.  “Doing what?”
Tony paused.  “That’s a lot of dairy, Parker.”
Shaking his head, Tony scrubbed his face with the towel, trying to get some blood back into his head.  It wasn't particularly effective.  He considered the shower again, wondering if he could risk it.  The way this day was going, he'd be naked and in a compromising position when Steve decided to walk in.
“For the time being,” Tony said, spinning on his stool.  He tossed his soldering iron to the side, wincing as his fingers protested the movement.  “God, how long have I been at this?”
Furbro reached out with one paw, playing idly with a long blade of grass.  Steve straightened up.  "And now he's at the end of that journey," he said.  "Facing the dragon that's rampaged, unchecked, through his kingdom."  On the table, a few of the dowels had been abandoned, almost within reach.  Steve rolled to his feet, reaching for one.  "And it's not his job.  He's not really a knight, after all.  Just a boy on a horse."
“I love your staff,” Darcy said to her, grabbing onto the back of Harris’ shirt, letting him tow her through the flow of the crowd.  “What is he-”
Steve gave him a look, his lips twitching.  “Rude of me,” he agreed, and he peeled away the rest of the brown paper.  It fell to the polished marble of the lobby floor in broad, heavy swaths, leaving Steve with an armload of roses, beautifully formed blooms of golden yellow with red bleeding along the tips of every petal.
He turned back to Tony, a gun held easily one hand.  “So now we have a choice.  We can stand up, and you can come with me.  We’re going to go and sign a few papers, just some simple little contracts, moving some assets into my name.  And when that’s over, you’ll be of no further use for me.
Stark looked up, his eyes meeting Steve's, clear and bright.  "A protector of the kingdom deserves to be an actual knight," he said, swinging the dowel in a loose, easy figure eight.  "In name as well as in heart."  He smiled, and there was nothing cruel to it.  "So kneel.  And be knighted."
“Mrs. Parker said that Peter left his books down here,” Steve said.  “I met Jarvis on the way down, he said he’d put them on the shelf, so-”  He shrugged.  “I’m sure they’re in your way.”
“Right,” he said with a slight smile.  “Now that we’ve-”
“Parker, eat your breakfast burrito,” Tony said, not even looking in that direction.  “And stop doing things that draw attention to yourself.”
“Yes,” Steve agreed.  “Yes, she is.”
“You can break the mirror, if that would make you feel better,” Thor said.  She went still, and he picked up the blender cup and offered it to her.  “I have never liked it.”
"This should be an easy enough assignment," she said, as he pushed the door open for her.  Her head dipped in a slight nod of thanks, and then she was moving down the broad stone stairs in front of the station.
“Thank you.”
"I think you did, too."  Sam's fingers wove together, one index finger tapping against the back of his other hand.  "Wanna talk about this?"
“You will never get another morsel of food out of my kitchen,” Tony told him.
Steve nodded.  “I’ve wanted to.  For a long time.”  He looked back at the table, where the mistletoe bells lay, almost forgotten.  “I figured this…  Might be my only chance.”  He looked back, and Tony was staring at him, his face carefully blank.  “Figured I should take it.”  His lips twitched into a pained smile.  “I-”
“She’s very disconcerting,” Tony said to Charlie.  Bruce stood up, trying to wander in the general direction of the door without appearing to move towards the door. It was a pathetic attempt.  Tony snapped his fingers, and Bruce glanced at him then quickly away.
-Three Months Later-
“No one is going to Vegas,” Tony said.
The car came to a stop in front of the mansion’s doors.  Steve didn’t move.  “Someone wants him dead,” he said at last.  He met Happy’s eyes.  “And I don’t think it’s a stranger.”
Steve nodded.  “What do you want?”
Greer laughed.  “And what would you know about varsity sweaters?”
There was a slight pause, and then a sigh from the other end of the line.  “And in such things, he is most often correct,” T’Challa said.
Tony pointed at the tray.  “Eat your breakfast.  I’ll draw a bath.”  If he was lucky, he could coax Steve into the tub with him; heaven knew it was large enough.
Clint braced a hand against the column, his body finding an empty space behind her by rote.  “Are they going at it again?” he asked, his voice pitched low.
"I'm fine."  The words were forced out from pale, cracked lips, the sounds slurring into each other.  "I'm-" His head lolled forward, just for a second, but long enough.  Steve gave him a tiny shake, just jostling his arm, and Tony's head snapped back up.  "I'm fine," he repeated, and it was stronger this time.  But no more sure.
“Yes.”  Firm and certain.  “Of course I can, Tony.  But what are you going to do now?”
“At least you admit it,” May said, heading for the door.  “Peter.  Behave.”
“The Las Vegas convention center,” DJ said.
“Study,” DJ told him.
Tony grinned back.  “You and me both.”
Agatha gave him a withering look.  “My dear boy, of course it enjoys scritches.”
Tony glanced up at the jet.  “He give you a full briefing, or the abridged version?”
“Sorry, we’re all out,” Tony said, smirking at Clint over the rim of his coffee cup.  “I guess you should’ve gotten up earlier.  Next time-”
His lips were red from the wine, and Steve found he was having trouble breathing.  “Can we discuss this, then?” he asked.   He looked up, and around the room.  “Because.  If you’d asked me what my worst case scenario was this morning, it’d be that you made your money through organized crime and somehow kept that quiet.  Instead-”
He glanced up.  Pepper was staring at him, her eyebrows arched, her mouth hanging open.  He spread his hands in a 'I don't know' gesture, and her head fell back.  “You got married,” she said, to the ceiling.  Or perhaps God.  He'd driven women to prayer before.
Tony raised his water bottle.  “Evening.”
“I’m not asleep,” Bruce mumbled, without raising his head from his microscope.  There were stacks of books and paperwork on one side of him and coffee cups and crumpled up napkins on the other side.  Unopened boxes from various chemical and scientific supply companies made getting more than a foot from the door difficult, so Tony didn’t bother trying.
“I know, RIGHT?” Sam asked him.  His head swiveled back to Jan.  “Is this because I stepped on your foot that one time?”
“Then there’s nothing to be sorry about..”  She sliced another piece of apple free from the core.  “DJ, would you like some apple?”
“If Happy isn't waiting for me at the curb, I swear I'm coming right back up here and dumping half a bottle of scotch into the nearest hot drink and sleeping until New Years.”
He reached for the wine bottle.  “Please tell me they’re wrong.  Please tell me you’re not-”
Tony held the cup up.  “Want a drink?” he asked, his voice soft.  “It’ll help.  I promise.”
“No one cares, Ed,” Morrison said, collapsing back into his seat. He looked petulant. “You can take your suggestions and shove them up your ass, really, I don't-”
“It's fine, it's-”  Tony waved a hand through the air.  “It's fine.”
"It does allow for multiple meanings," someone called from the back, amidst the laughter.
“Breakfast?” Tony called from the bedroom, and Steve folded the paper back up, shoving it into his pants pocket.
Phil took a deep breath. “Clint-”
Clint shifted, drawing his attention.  “Hulk?”
Steve reached for his napkin.  "No," he repeated, snapping the fabric out and spreading it onto his lap.  "No.  I'm done.  I'm done with all of it, and I've already ordered, and I'm going to sit here, and eat a very expensive meal, and I'm damn well going to enjoy it."
Clint dipped a finger in the jam jar, ignoring Bobbi's attempts to fend him off.  “Still.  They've been mad for months.  Hasn't changed a thing about how the boss has been handling it.”
“I knew I forgot something,” Jan said.
“What kind of fish is this?” Steve asked, and Tony looked down at the intricate ink of a fish, caught in mid-turn.  Its tail was flicking through the water, leaving a trail of bean-shaped bubbles around it.
“What, exactly, are you basing this on?” Tony asked.
“Are you scared of the dark?” Franklin asked.  DJ thought about that, then shook his head.  Franklin nodded.  His teeth, white and straight, worried at the edge of his thumbnail.  “Val was afraid of the dark.”
“You...  Gave away my plant,” Tony said.
His hand went towards his back before he could stop it, the movement still as natural as breathing.  But there was nothing there, his fingers closing on empty air.  Tony was just ahead of him, moving down the wide marble stairs of the porch towards the lawn.  “Tony!”
Tony nodded. "Come see me next year. I could always use a businessman of your..." He chuckled. "Unique talents."
“I'm a black man married to a white woman, that brings out the special in a lot of assholes,” Luke said, his arms crossed over his chest.
Steve opened the door.  “It’s eight am,” he pointed out, trying his best not to smile.  He braced a hand on the doorframe.  “It’s…”  He shook his head.  “Isaiah.  It’s eight am.”
“Are you drinking tequila out of a clay sheep?”
Rhodey considered him.  “When is later?”
“Why, exactly, were you after her?” Steve asked, before either of them could get themselves into more trouble.  “What's your interest in-”
“Wait, the PIANO?” Neena asked.
Jarvis’ eyebrows bounced up again.  “Sir.  I’m quite hurt.  All I want for you is-”
“I want his,” DJ said, taking it from Peter, who gave Tony a distinctly smug look.
“It sounds like an overweight space Nazi, which is not really-”
She could hear the faint, tinny echo of the audio from the other end of the line.  “We hear anything from Rogers yet?”
Steve braced his hand on the newel post of the bannister.  “How long ago?”
The cat was right on his heels the entire way, its tail bouncing with each step.
A flicker of light darted up the hallway, swirling around his head, and then Jan appeared next to him, growing back to her normal size in a single blink.  “He's fine,” she said, and they both knew who 'he' was.
Steve dropped the bar of soap into the soapdish.  “It’s a bath.  How do you ‘enjoy’ a bath?” he asked, splashing water onto his face.  Soap suds dripped from his nose, and he swiped at them with the back of his hand.  “I’m done.”
“He can’t help us right now,” Tony said, cutting him off.  “It’s not going to hurt anything, but Steve, it’s not going to help, and you-”
“Well, he sure is furry,” Peter said.  He reached out, and scratched the cat behind at tuft that might've been an ear.  “So I guess that works.”  The cat bumped against his fingertips, its tail swishing through the air.
There was a flinch, and if he hadn’t been watching for it, he would’ve missed it.  “He’s safe,” Steve said, and he was smiling, he was trying to be comforting.  “Deej, he’s safe, back at home, he’s-”
“There's really no middle ground,” Jan said.  “That's why I live with Hank.  On the other side of the city.  And bring him for carefully supervised visits so he and Tony don't unleash tactical nuclear weapons on each other." She paused.  "Or get into a slap fight.”
"Fine, I'm nine," Val said, her head swinging back and forth with enough force to send her bun bouncing on the back of her head.  “And I'm still more useful than you.”  She grinned at DJ, her freckled nose crinkling up.  “Right?”
“We have-” Harris started, and DJ rocked forward, grabbing the back of his seat.
“It was Mr. Stark's room, when he was much younger,” Jarvis said.  He reached out, his gloved fingers flicking a cobweb away from the turrets of the castle.  His nose wrinkled.  “It's been unoccupied for a long time, but-”  He smiled at Steve.  “It'll be a quick day's work to get it ready for a new occupant.”
“No.”  Steve sat up, and god, Tony had never seen anything as beautiful as this man, all broad shoulders and sleek, firm muscle.  “My plan was to grab all the linens and run for the closet, leaving you stark naked.”
“Two would be better,” Harris admitted.
"Listen, have you met him?" he asked. "No. Seriously." He looked at the assembled group. "Has everyone met him?" He shook his head. "He's very intimidating. If we're out in public for more than five minutes, someone's professing their love for him.”
Seemingly satisfied with that, DJ took Mrs. Parker’s hand and gave them both a wave.  A moment after they left the room, Furbro stood, stretched, and jumped down off the bed, padding after them with a flick of his tail.
DJ took a deep breath.  “Would you believe, something important is happening here?” he asked Tony.  He looked at Harris.  “Would you?”
And there was a dining room table large enough to seat a party or ten or more, which was now covered with far too much breakfast for just him.
There was a brisk rap on the door, and then the rattle of a key.  “Oh, thank God,” Harris said to no one in particular.
Tony choked on a laugh.  “Thatta boy,” he said, picking up a sandwich.  He unwrapped it.  “You got a name for this brilliant girl?”
“And I appreciate it,” Steve told her.
“Most of these guys aren't criminal geniuses,” Tony agreed.  “And you are old.”
"That's kind of what we're trying to figure out," Pepper said.  "In that Marcy Pearson, you remember Marcy, don't you?”
“This is undignified,” Steve told her, as Carol turned on the sound system.  Jess came barreling across the floor to leap onto her back.
“I don't think-” Steve started.
“You might've,” Rhodey repeated.
“DJ will save you,” Stark said.  “Won't you, moppet?”  DJ gave a firm nod.  “See?  Nothing to fear.” He propped his hands on his hips, drawing the fabric tight, and Steve knew he had to stop staring before he gave himself away.
“I know.  I’m sorry.”  He took a breath.  “I’m probably going to do it again.  You know that.”
Steve smiled at him, and there was something almost shy about it.  “Sure,” was all he said.
“Despite the many years you’ve worked together, Mr. Stane still believes he can predict your reactions under all circumstances,” Jarvis said.
Tony ignored the warmth curling in the pit of his stomach as Steve took a step back.  “You're up early,” he said, arching an eyebrow at Steve
“All right.”  Tony leaned back.  “Better?”
“On the record,” Tony said, “I don’t give a damn.”
DJ grinned up at him, giggling.
He saw Steve and straightened up, his knees locking as he forced himself forward.  May tossed the napkin in her hand aside with a frustrated gesture. “Peter Benjamin Parker, you get yourself back up to bed right now, or I swear you’ll regret it.”
Tony cupped both hands around DJ's head.  “I know.”  He leaned in, pressing his lips to DJ's forehead.  “I know you have, and I hate that, so-”  He straightened up.  “You're going to humor me and go read a book or work on something while we're gone, right?”
“Yeah, me too.”  Steve took a step back, pretending to consider DJ, who was dressed in a simple white shirt and dark pants, one of his suspenders sliding down his left arm. "Do you think maybe we should find you some shoes?" he asked.
She gave him a look.  “Know how you avoid that?  Don’t invite creeps to your party, Tony.”
DJ tugged on his shirt.  “Can we go upstairs?” he asked.
Tony made a face.  “I suspect that’s the story of your life, Jarvis.”
“Yellow, please,” DJ said.
“Fired,” Tony managed, and it worked, it worked because Jarvis started to laugh, wobbly and uneven, but it was enough.  Tony grabbed the wastepaper basket, just in time for his stomach to empty itself in a rush.
He turned back to Steve.  “Just us.”
Tony’s head fell back.  “I’m-  I’m feeling fat, okay, can you just lie back and-”
“Dominic Jules?  Duncan Jackson?  Diego Jasper?” May asked, and Tony grinned.
Tony straightened up.  “Did we-”  His head snapped around towards Rhodey, who was cradling his head in his hands.  “Tell me we didn’t give him alcohol.”
"So Jessica had Steve, did anyone have Tony?" Peter asked.  “No one had Tony, right?  Steve's one thing, but Tony's another thing entirely.”
“Okay,” Steve said, and it was clear neither of them was paying the least bit of attention to him. “Um, this is really-”
“A ship crashed on me,” Steve said.
Ellen frowned at her.  “Your...  Source.”
“You're not letting out a jacket right now, we're twenty minutes from dinner,” Stark told her.  “And Obie's coming, so we're starting on time or I'll never hear the end of it.”
“Hmmm?  Oh.  Brioche.”  There was a murmur in the background.  “And Sue says she's got a jar of cranberry orange chutney for you to try when you get back.”  To Sue, he said, “Why does he get these things and not me?”
“Yes.”  DJ painted a smile on the cookie, his lower lip caught between his teeth.  The frosting mixed in fascinating, difficult to predict ways.  He dragged the tip of his brush across the gingerbread man’s face, watching the colors bleed into each other.  “Laundry.”
“I’ll make sure it’s still warm for you,” Clint said, and with another grateful nod, Bruce slipped back out the door and out of sight.
"Hi," Steve said, amused.  "Do we have a problem with the floor?"
“He’s way more annoying than you,” Clint said to Tony.  “Which, you know, I wouldn’t have believed, but here we are.”  He slapped the side of the car.  “C’mon, kid, it’s a long drive back into the city, and you might be able to fly, but I can’t, and I’m not getting stuck with this much tension in the back seat.”
“I guess the 'everyone you know and love is dead' is an easier target,” Steve said.
Clint braced his hands on the counter, leaning into them.  “Stark is bored by anything he understands.  He’s bored by almost everything, so if you can just…  Make him think, even for a minute, even for a second, you’ve got an in.  He’ll look at you different.  You’re…  Interesting.”  He rocked back on his heels.  “If you can get his attention, he’s-”
Clint poked his head out of the kitchen, a carton of Chinese food in one hand and a beer bottle in the other.  “Yo,” he said.
She held up the box.  “A mini-console!” she said, her voice gleeful.  “Thank you, DJ!”
“You kept forgetting to lock the door,” Peter said.
The girl shifted against him, her slight weight pressing down on him, and Clint winced as his shoulder  pressed hard against something sharp.  “Don't move,” he said.  There was an impact, somewhere above them, so close that the ground vibrated against his back.  He gritted his teeth, waiting for the chunks of the scaffolding to shift, for the remains of the street or the bus to come crashing down on them.
Steve managed a smile.  “I am no king.”  He went down to one knee, his head bowing low.  “Just a soldier, in the presence of a queen.”
“I swear to god, Buck-”
DJ leaned forward, his arms going around Tony's neck with sudden, desperate strength.  He latched on, and Tony wrapped his arms around him, holding on tight.  “Someone is coming for you,” he whispered.  “Always.  And if you find yourself back in that box, and I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, baby, I hope you never do, but if you do-”
Bucky nodded, looking like half-starved hamster, his cheeks bulging as he shoved another bite into his mouth.  "Mmmshszh," he said.
DJ realized he was waiting for a reply.  The bell seemed to be speeding up.  “Okay,” he said.
Tony could feel Pepper’s glare.  He did his best not to acknowledge it.  Or even look in her direction. “Let’s get the-”
Steve had made a lot of bad decisions in his life.  And a few really good ones.
“We did check there first,” Tony said, and Pepper gave him a look.
“It is not,” Darcy said.
“You seem to think you have to do this alone.”  Tony pushed himself to his feet, displacing the cat, and paused, putting his clothes to order with a few quick, efficient flicks of his hands.   Furbro paced around his feet, still purring.  “I assure you.  You don’t.”
DJ shot upwards, an arc of light that cut across the velvety blackness of the sky, and it was like watching a firework, primed and ready to explode.  He passed out of the range of the headlights and far up above their heads, the armor catching the moonlight as he accelerated.
Getting into a battle of wits with this man was not a good idea.  He wasn’t going to win.  He might not even survive.  But he was so aroused that it hurt, and somehow, that just seemed right.  “Stay with me tonight,” he whispered.  “And you can ask whatever questions you want.”
DJ took Jarvis’ hand, looking back at Steve one last time before he fixed his head forward, walking towards the dining room, his fingers locked on Jarvis’.  Steve watched him go, waiting until he was out of sight before he leaned over to pick up his bags.  He straightened up slowly, avoiding Rhodey’s eyes as he shifted his bags onto his shoulder.
“Sometimes,” DJ agreed, coaxing Furbro back.  After a moment, the lizard darted to his hand and burrowed back under his sleeve.   “You knew he was there.”
Sam sighed.  “Maybe because when it’s me, you flat out say you don’t want to date me.  And when it’s Tony, your response is to try to find out what gave you away.  Which seems, you know, kind of telling, Steve.”
“Right.”  Tony turned on his heel and headed for the other side of the workshop.  “Right.  So.  I think it’s time that I reviewed his spending.”
“He’s safe,” Stephen said.  He met Steve’s eyes, his gaze steady and calm.  “I’m sorry.”  He looked back at Tony.  “You’re right.  At this moment, I cannot get him back, and I also can’t say why I can’t get him back.”
Steve bit his lip, struggling to keep a straight face.  "Right."
"I didn't date," Steve pointed out.  "But I very much want to go back in time and punch some bastards right now, so...”
“I can, I'm just not-”
“A proper string of pearls is knotted between each one,” Tony pointed out, “but knowing you, you’d find a way.”  The wool that lined Steve’s jacket was soft and warm, and it held his scent.  “Fine.  Silk then, bolts of it, or lace in patterns so intricate you could stare at it for hours and not see everything in it.  In colors you’ve never dreamed of.”
“There's more than one stray in the neighborhood,” Pepper said.  She gave him a smile.  “Steve.  Go back to bed.”
Like everything else I've ever written, I've thought "how can I get a couple thousand words out of this concept, there's no way that'll happen," and end up trying to avoid hitting 100K.
Steve watched her go, watched her walk out of the room with her back straight, chin up, her ponytail swinging behind her like a metronome.  Perfect.  Polished.  Professional.  The door shut behind her, and he turned his attention back to the television.  Tony was still talking, smooth and polished and professional, but his smile was natural, his eyes bright.
Billy’s eyes were huge, but his voice was steady.  “Call Stark Manor.  Tell them Stane might be the kidnapper.”
"We have most of them for a reason, and the reason is you," Steve said.  They were attracting stares, which Tony wasn't surprised by.  It was late, and the battered old airport terminal was typical of Soviet era buildings: big, impersonal, and gray.  The sight of Steve was going to turn heads under ordinary circumstances.  Dressed in a perfectly tailored tux, he was capable of stopping traffic.
Behind him, Jarvis paused, his hand on the banister.  “Sir, Mrs. Parker put him in his room.”
He turned the page and started over, trying not to think about Tony’s smile.
“Just…  Talk about some trashy reality show or something,” Shawn said.  He gave Harris a thumbs up.  “Safer.  For everyone.”
He could’ve made the trip from the old workshop up to the main floor with his eyes closed.  He had done almost that often enough in the past, sneaking along the hallways and down the old stone stairs in the dark, trying to avoid prying eyes.  At some point, he’d memorized the number of steps from the workshop door to the bottom of the stairs, the number of stairs to the main floor, the length of the hallway to the kitchen, to the parlor, to the music room, to the grand ballroom, to the dining room.
Steve raised one shoulder in a half shrug.  “It worked,” he said, filling a cup of coffee for Pepper.
His shoulders jerked, and Steve wondered if he was laughing.  "Now, Miss Potts.  Would I do that?"
"I'm ALMOST ten," Val said.  Her foot thumped into the side of the workbench, and DJ measured the swing of her leg, anticipating the next impact, trying to fit it into the pattern of their breathing and their work.  Sometimes that was easy.  Today, it wouldn't quite fit.  He frowned down at his work, trying to figure out what was missing.
Tony huffed out a sigh and reached for his beer.  “I hate you,” he said, and Steve held out the box of garlic knots.  Tony took one, distracted momentarily from the cinematic train wreck that was playing out on his tv.  “God, the eighties was an ugly, ugly decade.”
“Yeah, we got a bit of trouble of our own.” Hogan nodded towards the door of Steve's building.  “Best we discuss it off the street.  If you don't mind?”
The timer went off, and he reached for the steamer basket.  “Sorry if you’re creeped out by it,” he said, shaking the florets gently into the ice water bath. “I liked it.  And it seemed appropriate.”
“Right,” Rogers said. “So why did you do it?”
“You were sitting down,” she said.  “You were wearing a shirt, though.  So.  I have no reason to think that you WEREN’T wearing pants.”
Over Bruce’s shoulder, Tony could see Peter watching them, his eyes huge under the damp strands of his hair.  Tony tried to smile at him, and Peter’s head dipped back down.  Tony took a deep breath.  “Outside,” he said, his voice very soft.  “He needs to rest.”
“No,” Steve said, laughter stuttering off into a chuckle.  “I can barely put in a good word for myself.”  He looked at Sam.  “But I brought that up, because I was…  I was okay with that.  You know?  Nothing I can do about my dreams, about my subconscious.  And I could keep that to myself, I could handle that.
“It does.”  And with that, she was gone.  Tony took a deep breath and reached for his coffee cup.  He considered the cake.  “Jay, is it possible for pastry to look ominous?”
“Let her go, let her go,” Greer said, shifting her position with her feet on the bench, falling into an easy crouch, her arms braced on her knees.  She grinned up at them.  “Sorry, I dragged him in here.”
DJ’s chin dipped.  “Yes.”
“Please hold all questions to the end of the-” Tony started and Nat kicked his stool, and that was the last straw, the leg gave way with a crack, and Tony had to grab for the bar to keep from ending up on his ass.  He clawed his way back to his feet.  “What the hell, Romanov?”
Clint settled back.  "All right, that sounds fair.  Jarvis, queue it up."
Pepper made a face, even as she handed him a cup of tea.  “Mr. Stane has been very reluctant to hire this year,” she said, giving the ledgers a puzzled look.  “And I don’t know why.  Financially, the estate is doing well.”
“Dad had an emergency,” DJ said.  He held up the piping bag full of frosting.  “Clint had cookies.”
Bobbi nodded.  “That was a yes.”
“Cap.” Sam reached out, one hand clasping Steve's shoulder.  “You've got about fifty pictures of a naked man with black hair and a goatee and even if it's not an exact match, yes.  You did that.”
Nat didn't react.  She just pivoted on one foot, the movement smooth and easy.  “Then come and stretch, please.”
“A problem,” Clint said, force marching his Tony through the door.  He grinned.  “Hey!  Elvis!  We’re going all in on this shit, good for us.”  He thrust a hand at her, his other still clamped on Tony’s shoulder.  “I’m Clint.  This is Tony.”
There was a long pause, and Steve shrugged out of the robe.  He hung it on the back of the bathroom door and shook out his pants, stepping into them.
DJ's eyes narrowed.  “Octopus.”
"You okay?" Mackenzie asked, handing him back his card.  She braced her hands on the counter, leaning into them, her head tipped to the side.  "You're not your usual bouncy self."
Sam glanced in Tony's direction.  Tony tipped his head in Steve's direction, and Sam nodded.  “Lead the way.”
“Yeah, it's...  I'm very confused how this became my life,” Clint said.  “Only thing that saves it for me is that Tony is way more confused.”
Steve heard Happy swear, but he barely registered it, already moving down the hallway, straight for Hammer’s office.  He gave the doorknob a hard pull, testing the lock, before raising his elbow and slamming it into the glass that covered the top of the door.  It shattered, shards raining down to the wooden floor like raindrops.
Tony drew himself up with all the dignity that he could manage.  Which wasn't much, in that he probably looked like a drowned rat that desperately needed a shave.  "I'm soaking wet, I'm cold, and I've been betrayed by the man I'm married to," he said, because he was a drama queen at heart.  "No.  I don't feel better."
“Right.  So the only reason to try to trick us into running is if he wanted to keep the blood off of the carpet.”  Clint paused.  “If we’d had any sense, we would’ve gone.  Hopped a train with the down payment our client gave us to get that vase, moved on.  For a complete failure, it was the best we could’ve hoped for.”
The inn was a small, unremarkable stone and wooden building  set just off the road, clinging to the edge of the forest.  It looked like it had once been more important than it was now, but still, it was well lit and well tended, with a broad yard in front for parking vehicles and a stable for the horses.
“And after he was asleep, I returned to his father’s study and told him that if he ever hit that child again, I would see to it that he regretted it.”
“Atlantic City,” Steve said.  He made a deliberate effort not to look back towards the strip.  “Boardwalk's nice, but the rest of it...”
Harris made a face.  “Just something Coulson said.”
Chapter warnings:  Big things go smashy smashy.  Just a little canon appropriate violence against robots.  But not robots we like, so it's okay.
Clint nodded.  “She’s wrong.”
“There's a camera in here, you know that, right?” Steve breathed, but he didn't pull away, or pull back.
Steve stared at her, his fingers going still on the potato.  "Excuse me?"
Steve’s head snapped up.  Tony was standing on the second floor landing of the grand staircase, straight and whole and ALIVE, and Steve staggered to a stop, his pulse pounding in his ears.
“That’s not quite-”
Tony kicked a box onto its side with a flick of his foot, and waved a hand at it.  “Join me.  The finest seats in the city.”
“About then.  And in the space of a single day, everyone’s in a total uproar,” she said, wrapping her hands around her mug.  “And there are all these arguments about what to do with him, how to get rid of him, and one big part of the council just votes to drag him into the jungle, and leave him there.  If he’s alive, he’s on his own.”
“It just might have,” Strange agreed.  With a heartfelt sigh, he lowered himself down to sit next to Steve, bracing his elbows on his knees and dropping his head into his hands.  For a long moment, he just sat there, his shoulders rising and falling as he breathed.  When he finally raised his head, he was pale, his dark hair flopping over his forehead more disordered than Steve had ever seen him.  “You realize you may have trapped yourself here, as well, don’t you?”
“I’m not shocked at all,” Natasha said, studying her nails.
After a quick trip to his apartment to collect a sketchbook, Steve retraced his steps, heading down to the workshop.  He paused outside the door, just taking a moment to let his pulse settle.  Even through the glass, he could hear the driving beat of the one of Tony’s favorite albums, vibrating against his skin.  Inside, he could see Tony, surrounded by an ever expanding web of holograms.  He watched, his chest aching, as Tony moved, smooth and easy, his hands darting through the air.  His face caught the light, and he was the most beautiful thing Steve had ever seen.
“That’s the address line, isn’t it?  Let me-” Tony reached for the tab key, and his wrist bumped Steve’s chest, making him twitch.  Tony pulled his hand away, and for the first time, their eyes met.  In the warm light of the kitchen, Tony’s eyes were golden brown, brilliant and intoxicating.  For an instant, they just stared at each other, and then Tony smiled.  “Sorry,” he said, pulling back. “We’ve got you trapped, don’t we?”
“He had little use for other people, and he had little tact when dismissing those who annoyed him.  He drank heavily and often, and that did not make him easier to deal with.”  Jarvis met Steve’s eyes.  “He hit Anthony once.”
Steve grinned. “Well, when you put it like that, I guess we've got no choice.”
Happy tugged on the brim of his cap.  “Been a good year or more since I’ve been to confession,” he said with a grin.  “I imagine this’ll take a while.”
Her lashes dipped.  "Mr. Stark has decided, in a goodwill gesture, to take in an orphaned child for a week."
(See the end of the chapter for
"We've got a problem."
Shiro held up his hands, muttering something unintelligible under his breath in Japanese.  He grabbed  noodles from the tray, curling them into a neat pile in the palm of his hand and dropping them into the basket before plunging it into the boiling water.  “Needs to sit.”
“I mean, it was a flesh wound, the doc’s already got him patched up.” Happy jerked his head towards the car.  “Let’s go.”
Tony nodded.  “Okay, did you not get enough to-”
Jarvis would say it was petty.  DJ was okay with that, too.
It was such an idle threat, but it was strangely comforting.  Steve dropped his head, staring down at his hands.  They were shaking, and he let his eyes close.   "I might've done this on purpose."
But maybe that was just the reflection of the camera flashes.
It didn't even slow Jan down.  "Support from everyone involved-"
“Thanks, Jay,” Tony said.  “Wanna go to the playroom, brat?”
“I’m a Faramir girl, myself,” Darcy said.  “I refuse to be seen with a man who has better hair than me.”  She waited for Clint to walk around the SUV, one hand propped on her hip.  “Anyone waiting to murder us?”
Steve managed a smile.  “You could do it again, if you wanted,” he offered.  “I wouldn’t mind.”
Steve shifted his weight, pushing away from the wall.  "I think that I-"
“Stay with them,” Tony said.  “I’ve got him.”  Without even looking back, he hustled up the aisle, his head up, his jaw tight.  It was dark enough that he couldn’t see individual faces, but he could see the heads turning as he stalked past.  He ignored them, his jaw getting tighter with every step.
The cottage was a small stone building with a heavy thatch roof, with clouded glass windows and a rather off-kilter chimney.  It had a certain charm, with walls covered in ivy and the overgrown garden behind the tumbledown stone walls.  The wooden gate to they yard had only one working set of hinges, and Steve had to give it a firm shove to get it open.
“No,” Iron Man and Rogers said at the same time, and without looking at him, Iron Man held up a hand. Rogers subsided against the car, his arms crossed over his chest.  Iron Man nodded.  “We’re going to discuss things.  Without any meddling kids.”
Beyond that small alcove, he could almost feel the emptiness of the house pressing in on him.  Here, sheltered beneath the curve of the staircase, it was warm and sheltered, thick with color and sensation and light.  His thumb rubbed against the leg of the couch, savoring the silky swirl of the wood, carved with skill and care.
“Huh,” Sam said.  “Right.  Well, okay, I can remind you.”
“He’s-”
It was a ridiculous thing to say, and it was even more ridiculous because Steve actually meant it.  Tony took a deep breath and started talking.
DJ shrugged again.  “Jarvis.”
Harris wasn’t really listening any more.  He looked out across the cafeteria, and it was a sea of movement and noise and chaos and he didn’t understand what had happened.  What had happened.  What had that thing been, where had it come from?  How did it end up here?
“Jesus, I'm not going to-” Tony felt his face heat, and Rhodey straightened up in his chair, his eyes narrowing.  Tony ignored him.  “I'm not going to kiss him back.  I've had enough fake publicity dates to know how this works.”
She stood, setting her pen down on the table, her manicured fingertips resting there for a moment.  “But there are large swaths of this country, let alone the world, where the rights and privileges of same sex couples and queer people in general are still very much in flux.  And there are still quite a few people who will seize on anything and everything that weakens the standing of a group who are still very, very vulnerable.”
“I'll wash dishes if you'll give me one of those,” Tony said, because the citrus smell was intoxicating now, cutting through his stuffed sinuses and his foggy head.  He licked his lips, suddenly aware of just how empty his stomach was.
DJ giggled. “Yes.”
“And that’s better?”
One more step, then two, and Tony stopped, confusion sweeping over him.  He turned back, his eyes darting over the lobby.  There were a few members of the staff behind the desk, and a doorman at the door, holding it open for a group of drunken revelers.  A tall, dark skinned man was seated in a chair, having an intense conversation on his phone.  A couple dressed in evening clothes were at the front desk, arm in arm, pressed closed together.  A woman in a cocktail dress waited, her attention on the elevators.
Happy twisted around, his head tipping towards the deep scar the arrow had left into the wood of the building.  “Well, let’s just say,” he mused, “you’re usually better off snapping the shaft off, and shovin’ it the rest of the way through.”  He tapped the arrow against the broad expanse of his palm.  “Sure, that’d hurt like hell, but pulling it back out, that just rips you to shreds.”
This time, he held up a coffee mug that said, ‘You don’t have to be crazy to work here, but you will be soon enough.’  “It’s true, but but I think that HR would frown on me adapting it as our new recruitment strategy.
She took a sip from her cup, her eyes going to half mast, the steam curling over the rim like smoke from between a dragon’s teeth.  The cup lowered, an inch or two, just far enough for DJ to see her mouth, a hard, uncompromising line.  “Drink your tea, dear.”
Tony's head tipped back.  “Don't know about that,” he said.  He sniffed the air.  “Does it always smell this good?”
“Is there any way to stop you?” Tony asked, his voice just barely polite. Steve choked on a laugh, and when Tony gave him a look out of the corner of his eye, he managed a benign smile.
"No," he said, cutting her off.  She pouted in his general direction, and Stark rolled his eyes.  "I know that you think all men are weak to your charms, but I am not going to fall for that, so just-”
“It’s a question, please try to keep up, I’m running on three viciously angry brain cells, the only ones I have that survived the alcohol apocolypse last night, you can help me out here, Alison.  Was I wearing pants?”
“Yeah, that was quick.”  Steve said, as DJ ducked around him.  Steve shut the door behind him, and turned back towards Tony.  DJ hovered at the foot of the bed, one foot braced on the other, one hand picking at the hem of his shirt.  Steve caught Tony’s eye, and Tony shook his head, a barely perceptible twitch of his chin.  Steve exhaled.  “Since no one likes it, I’m going to go see if I can find some pants.”
He couldn’t do this.  Steve took a step back, and then another, putting more distance between them.  Tony’s hand came up, reaching for him, an aborted, ineffectual gesture.   An instant later, his fingers curled into his palm, and his arm fell back to his side.  Steve turned around, walking away.
“I do,” one Strange said.  He glared at his doppelganger.  “And you are?”
Steve exhaled, and Tony hated himself.  Hated himself for thinking about just how warm Steve's breath was against his skin.  He gritted his teeth, trying to concentrate on the steady, slow beeping of the machines that surrounded them.  They were in SHIELD medical for a reason.  Steve was hurt, Steve was in pain, and Tony knew he had no shame, that he was a selfish asshole, he didn't need more goddamn proof of this.
“I told myself it wasn’t revenge,” she said.  “After all, revenge is an ugly thing, isn’t it?  An eye for an eye, a bullet for a bullet.  I’d convinced myself that what I was doing was saving the next kid in line, the next one with a father who didn’t have a lot of choices and still made the worst possible one.”
Darcy looked up at him.  She looked at Clint.  She looked back at Tony.  “Yes?” she said.  Tony pointed at Clint.  She shrugged.  “Is this a trick question?”
Jarvis looked up from the act of tidying something that did not need to be tidied.  “Does it?” he asked, all feigned innocence.
DJ made a face, but he reached for the bowl, dragging it over.  It looked like a bowl of wallpaper paste, and probably tasted like it, too.  But Steve was looking at him, that tight, worried smile still on his face, and DJ took a determined bite.
DJ rolled his eyes.  “Open gift,” he said, poking it.
“If he runs, I want you out here,” Tony said, heading up the stairs to the main door.  “Watch the door.”
“I’m not-”
“He'll die,” Sam said.  Nat shrugged.  Sam shook his head. “You are cold.”
Tony sucked in a breath.  “You're going to be fine,” he said, and he was certain of that.  That was a rock solid certainty.  He'd make sure of that.  “And if the serum stops working, well, then, guess we'll finally get a day off, Steve.” He went back to stroking Steve's hair, because Steve didn't seem to mind the contact.  “We'll get a van and drive across the country.  Looking for America.  Or, if that's too hard to find, just a good fried chicken joint.”
“Of course.”  The blonde looked behind him.  “Sorry.  I-  One sec.”
“Which is why I think he should do it, not me,” Darcy pointed out.  “And you find trouble faster than anyone I know, Harris.”
Steve choked on a laugh, his hand clamped over his mouth.  Grinning, Tony pushed himself to his feet.  “There's no way I can do this without another beer,” he said.  Onscreen, the bevy of bathing beauties did a very well executed dance with spinning parasols, and Tony felt a headache coming on.  “Or a bottle of scotch.”
That won him a smile, small and quick, but real.  “Worry about yourself,” she said, tapping him on the nose with one little fist, a joking punch.  Still, he staggered back, making a show of grabbing for the wall.  Pepper shook her head.“You’re in so much trouble.”
“If I give you your socks back, will you leave us in peace?” Tony asked him.
Steve exhaled.  “Thank the good Lord,” he said, and he could hear his mother’s brogue in those words.  Fear and relief in equal parts, heavy on the tongue, heavier still on the heart.  He wondered, idly, in some distant part of his mind, if this is what it was to be a parent.  He shook off the thought. “Anyone else?”
For an instant, Tony’s face went blank, all the sharp hauteur falling away, leaving only confusion.  Steve’s fingers tightened, his grip just firm enough that Tony couldn’t easily pull away, and color rushed back into Tony’s face.  He let out a bark of laughter.  “I don’t take orders from anyone,” he gritted out, “and you’re not in charge here.  You’re not even-”
“Is that the sort of thing you say that ends up with people joining super hero strike teams?” Ellen asked.
He opened the door and slipped through, pulling it shut behind him with an almost soundless click of the latch.  In the silence that followed, Steve heard Bucky suck in a long, slow breath.  “Well, fuck you all,” he said, his voice resigned, and Steve choked on a laugh.
“So, uh, it seems like I’m the least troublesome company you’ve had in the last few days,” Bruce said, the words rising over Tony’s.  He looked over, the light flashing across the surface of his glasses.  For a moment, his eyes were invisible, but his dark brows were drawn up tight, his mouth twitching.  “I…”  He shook his head, gesturing at his tablet with his pen.  “Tony.  Just…  I’m just working here.  Can’t you just ignore me?”
He nodded.  “Coffee,” he said, that word an effort.  He set the cup down, next to the mirror, where she was unlikely to knock hit over.  Which was foolish.  Natasha wasn't clumsy or awkward, the way he was, she never tripped over her own feet or lost her balance.  She moved, and it was deliberate, it was always deliberate, grace and control.
“I have no friends,” Rhodes announced, and Pepper elbowed him hard in the stomach.  He skittered out of reach, laughing as he did.  “It's true, I have-”
“Thank you,” Steve said, sinking down at the kitchen table.  Tony's phone vibrated.  “I've got it.”  He punched the app, and the video screen popped up.  DJ stared out at him, his eyes huge behind the lenses of his glasses.  He was perched at the kitchen table at the farm, his knees drawn up against his chest and his bare feet braced on the edge of the kitchen chair.  Behind him, Steve could see Hitomi put her phone down and go back to her cutting board.  There was a pile of big, round pears stacked in easy reach, and a bowl of peeled, sliced pear sitting next to DJ on the table.
DJ grinned at him.  “Yes,” he said, reaching for a towel.  He paused, his fingers hovering in midair.  “Even sheets?”
Steve let his hands drop to his sides. “Please,” he said, his head falling forward “Please help me.”
“Yeah, but…  I’m going to jump the gun.” Sam waved the coffee pot at Steve before filling a cup.  “Go ahead, Steve.  Open it.”
Steve didn't even look up. “I know.”
"Anyone who's anyone, at least, anyone who's anyone that I can still stand to be in the same room with," Tony called back with an easy smile.  "Which exempts about half of New York society and three-quarters of our elected politicians."
"Even if I did, I don't think anyone here'd bother to obey it," Rogers said.  Behind him, Tony heard the heavy, measured tread of his feet towards the workshop door.  He didn't bother to look up, or back.
“Was he arrested?” Rhodey asked.  “Did…  Did anyone find out if he was arrested?”
Steve leaned in, cutting him off with a kiss.  Tony arched up into the contact, his breath soft against Steve's lips when they finally broke apart.  “I love you,” he whispered, and Tony reached up, hooking a fingertip in the neckline of Steve's shirt, trying to tug him back down.  “Talk to me.  When you can.”
Sam blinked at her. “My partner's over there-” he said, waving at Carol, right before Natasha shoved Peter at him.  Sam stopped.  “I guess you're my partner?”
Tony bit back a smile as he braced his hands on the edge of his workbench.  “Ah.  Security is getting lax.  I have a tool thief to contend with.”  He pulled his pencil out from behind his ear and dropped it onto the workbench, temptingly close to the edge, then took a deliberate step away.  “Now, where could he be hiding all my tools?  In the tool box, where they belong?  No, too obvious.”
Sam leaned in.  “Hey,” he said, his eyes darting between them.  “Jess insisted on pausing it, and Thor and Clint are just punching each other in the shoulder now, so you guys okay, because-”
“”I’m not.  I’m selling you both to the Smithsonian for a button,” Tony said.  “AI wing.  Start low.  Work our way up.”
“Sir, there’s a note,” Jarvis said, and together, they looked at the wall opposite the elevator.
Obie crossed his arms over his chest.  “I saw it.”
Rogers nodded.  “Yes.”
“With excellent biceps, give me that much,” Carol said, not bothered by that.  “So you can give me a sleeveless dress-”
Steve was laughing out loud now.  “Yeah.  And it was fun, so I'm probably going to do it again,” he said.  He leaned in, and Tony caught the scent of his skin, sweat and soap and sunshine, mingled with the damp, sweet smell of the roses.  This kiss was just as soft, just as gentle, but Steve's lips found his full on this time, and Tony's eyes slid shut.
DJ came scrambling across the floor, ducking around them, and Tony moved to intercept.  Jarvis got there first, catching DJ's hands, then lifted him straight up and off the ground.  Laughing, DJ kicked at the air, coming down with his feet next to Jarvis's.  "Set your toes on mine," Jarvis instructed.  "I taught Master Stark to dance when he was not much bigger than you, I shall teach you as well."
“Hey, I fixed the navel.”  Clint slapped the tape down on his shoulder, trying to stick the wayward piece of armor back into place.  “Is that straight?”
“Natasha is having her way with armed assailants in my garden, you left me with a child, and I haven't had dinner yet,” Tony said, his voice rising.
DJ rocked back in his chair, aware for the first time that there was a third person in the room.  And this one, he knew.
“Does it have a backseat?” Harris asked.  “Because.  I’ve seen your cars.  And I’m not riding there in someone’s lap.”
He knew who it was, before he even got the door open, but still, finding DJ waiting on the other side made his stomach turn over.  “Deej?” he whispered, tightening the belt of his robe.  “What’s wrong, are you all right?”
“Doesn't have to be big,” he said, trying to sound confident.  “It's just me, after all.”
“Annoyed and frustrated?” Tony said, because he didn't want to think about that.  Didn't want to think about Steve, trapped in a chair like this, his stomach churning with fear and anxiety.  Tony scraped a hand over his face.  “Pissed off?”
“No, we can’t get takeout,” Jan said, sounding pained, and Steve straightened up in his seat.
The 'target' was a child.  And she was crying.
Hulk tossed himself up and onto the landing pad, his feet hitting with enough force to make it shake.  Neither he nor DJ seemed to notice.  He padded over, his face set in stern lines.  DJ met him halfway, stopping right in front of the Hulk.  "Okay?" he repeated.  He blinked hard, his face worried.  What few words he could manage seemed to stumble out of him with a great deal of effort.  "Hurt?"
"Of course, sir," Jarvis said.  He glanced at Steve, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips.  "If you'll follow me, Officer Rogers, I'll show you to a guest room."
“I-” Peter swallowed, his throat bobbing.  “I thought that-”  He looked at Steve. “I thought that you’d want to talk to me,” he said, desperation creeping into his voice.  “I thought that you’d need to talk to me.  While I can still-” His eyes darted to the side, his shoulders hitching up.  “I think I can remember-”  He stopped.  “I can remember, and I’m afraid if I fall asleep, then I’ll forget, I have to tell you before-”
DJ’s foot bounced against the floor of the car, thinking about that.  Steve let him, driving in easy, companionable silence.  Finally, DJ tried again.  “Lasagna?”
He was starving, but the very thought of food made his stomach turn over.  He breathed through his nose, his teeth clamped together as he struggled against an unexpected wave of nausea.
“Go sit with the other creepy people,” Tony told her.
“How much farther?”
“She can make Thanksgiving very awkward, though,” Tony said.
Hammer stopped.  “I didn’t know-  He didn’t say ANYTHING about KILLING him.”
“It's just a starting point,” Tony said. “You can work from there.”
DJ’s head snapped up, and for what seemed like the first time, he saw the elderly woman sitting in the chair opposite him.  She was a small woman, thin and almost frail looking, but her back was straight and her shoulders squared beneath pale silk of her scarf.  Her hair was a silvery-white frame around her gaunt face, long locks pulled into a smooth chignon.  She was smiling, but her eyes were dark and unreadable.  She leaned forward, setting her tea cup and saucer on the coffee table between them.  She reached for the tea pot.  “Now, then, don’t leave a mess,” she childed, a note of amusement in her clipped tones.  “Give me your cup, dear.”
Strange’s eyes closed.  “I do not know if you were born under a particularly blessed star, or a particularly cursed one,” he said.
DJ nodded.  “Think.  I can find Strange.”
“Right,” Jess said, as Okoye handed over a massive text.  She nodded, very slowly.  “This is going to require a lot of skimming.”
“You cannot, you have your own bath to handle, and Miss VanDyne will be most upset if you don’t wear the suit she sent over,” May said, her smile tempering the stern words.  May kissed DJ’s forehead, her expression full of warm fondness. “Hello, you wicked boy.  Causing such trouble.”  Her mouth pursed.  “There shall be no dessert for you tonight.”
“Why do you think that?” Sam asked, and there was no censure there, no judgment.  Just a calm, curious question.  “Steve.  Why do you think that?”
Tony smiled back. “Yes.  You have.”  Furbro jumped onto his desk, scattering his paperwork, and he leaned back in his chair with a sigh as pages floated to the floor.  He looked up at Obie.  “I seem to have lost control of my life.”
Steve stared at the door, his jaw tight.  "Only if you're going to continue dealing with this for the next six months or so."
He drained the last of his tea, too dark and too sweet, and set the leaves aside to reuse in the morning.  “Done?” he asked DJ, who'd finished almost everything.  DJ nodded, trading his plate with Steve's, and scooping up the cups.  “Thank you,” Steve said, finishing the scraps that DJ had left behind before handing over the plate.  “I'm going to go wash up, will you-”
“Does it help you?” DJ asked.  Franklin shrugged, his head down, and DJ nodded.  Maybe that made sense.  Maybe he didn't need it to make sense.  Maybe he didn't know what did and didn't make sense anyway.
“Right,” Steve said.  “I love you.”
His head tipped forward and he considered her from under the hard line of his eyebrows.  “Right.  I'll get right on that, Sue, that's a great idea, I'll, I don't know, I'll hire some children, where do you rent those, Jarvis, can you-”
"Sam and Natasha on Steve's side, Pepper and Rhodey on yours," Jan said.  "I, meanwhile, get to be at the fun table in the back."  She pointed.  "The fun table is next to the bar."
Tony rolled his eyes.  “Right, right, of course, an honest-to-God Grandma afghan, why didn't I see that coming?”
Jess considered her, her fingers tented in front of her mouth, her eyebrows arched.  “Darling.  You’re from Boston.”
Steve took a breath, and immediately coughed.  “Yeah,” he managed.  “I… hear that a lot.”
Some minor warnings for a slight, passing discussion of homophobia, it is rebuffed in the same scene, but I like to mention for things like that.  Also so romantic relationship fights.
“Three to be signed today, four more that need Mr. Stane to look them over before we can move forward,” she said, taking it from him.  She flicked through the pages, her eyes narrowed behind the lenses of her glasses.  “You missed an initial.”
He stepped forward, one foot slicing through the fog of dust and smoke that covered the floor, and it hit with the sound of metal on stone.  “You move.”
“I’m going to take your word for it,” Steve said.  He stood, gathering his things.  He was more than a little pleased that Tony made no move to leave without him.  “What’d you get?”
Steve’s hands tightened on his ass, just for an instant, and then he tumbled Tony gently back onto the bed.  Bracing one knee on the bed, he leaned over Tony, his expression soft. “I’ll try to make it worth your time,” he said, and Tony leaned up to kiss him.
“My mama used to say, ain't a good idea to mess with anyone who handles your food,” Clint said.  He reached for a platter.  “Cut some slices of bread, Peter, you can almost be trusted with toast.”
“You’re a liar and no gentleman, Rhodes,” she said, going up on her toes to brush a kiss against his cheek.  “How’ve you been?”
Steve couldn’t meet his eyes.  “Nothing,” he gritted out.  “I-”  He shoved a hand through his hair, frustrated beyond belief.  “I just made an ass of myself, so-” He thrust his hands out on either side of him, a sharp, hard gesture.  “Nothing new, Sam.”
The room at the end of the hall was large and imposing, with the beautiful, arched ceiling of a cathedral, but in platinum-white metal that reflected the lights.  Trimmed in gold, and ringed with columns, it was empty except for a large, imposing round table.  It filled the center of the room, surrounded by chairs made of the same matte silver.  The table was inlaid with an intricate, flowing pattern.  As he stepped forward, the light caught it head on, and it seemed to light up, a single, artistic letter A.
“Traffic's horrible,” Tony agreed. “Thank fucking God.”
The man slumped unconscious in his grip, and Steve let him fall to the ground.  Behind him, he heard the sound of tires squealing on the pavement, heard them slide, then catch.  He glanced back, just in time to see the car fishtail for a moment before pulling away.  He stood there, his heart in his throat, watching to make sure that they were gone.
“Right, I’m getting out,” Steve said, shifting his weight forward, and Tony reached over, catching him by the shoulder.
“Stephen?” Strange looked at Steve, who managed a tight-lipped smile.  “If you have news or not, come back and tell us what’s going on.”
“My FOOT?”  She leaned in, her eyes narrowed into slits.  “You stepped on ME.”
Tony looked at them.  “Harris can-”
“Right,” Tony said, because nothing had mattered back then, nothing had mattered other than his own pain and the ways he made it go away.  Or at least made it more bearable.  “Then it was the first, and last, time when you were left all alone, and I think, I think your human side doesn't want that.  Is afraid of that.”
Steve jumped, and turned to find Jessica standing just behind him, a plate of mini sliders and raw vegetables in her hand.  He tried to smile.  “Sorry, I-” He reached for his punch glass.  “I don’t know what happened.”
Steve shook his head.  “Limits access, sure, but they’re not going to try again right now.”
“Okay, that's not going to happen-”
There was something in the back of his head, something that Tony couldn’t quite remember, something that bothered him, like an itch under the armor at a place he couldn’t quite reach.  He scrubbed a hand over his eyes, trying to concentrate.  “Who would-”
Hands closed on Tony’s shoulders, his arms, dragging him up, pulling DJ out of his grip.  He screamed, something vicious and obscene, and it was no use, he couldn’t stop them, couldn't stop them, couldn’t stop anything, he was bleeding, he was dying-
Seeing him in person was something else entirely.
Steve cleared his throat.  “No,” he said.  He sounded disapproving.  That was fine.  He was all right with that, he should be disapproving.  That was a lot of skin on display.  Even for a swimming costume.
“And Steve,” Jess added.
The sudden, sharp pain of teeth sinking into his wrist cleared his head in an instant, and DJ’s eyes went wide, his fingers spasming on the handle of the cup.
"Because that sounded like it hurt," she said, reaching out with one gloved hand.  Her fingertips brushed against his forehead, and he winced.  She pulled back immediately.  "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"
“Hey, man, it's okay.  You're fine.”  Luke patted him gently on the shoulder.  “I'll tell her you asked about her, okay?”  He straightened up.  “And Tony had this delivered before he passed out, but it's got your name on it, so-”  Luke nodded at the envelope.  “Pretty sure it's for you.”
“I’m so pleased I can entertain,” Tony said, his voice withering.  To Pepper, he said, “You never specifically asked me not to-”
“The thread’s coming lose on this hem, I should have caught that when they were laundered.  I’ll have them fixed before you return, and perhaps this button-”
Steve pulled back, inch by painful inch, and Tony was standing there, his eyes closed, his lips parted.  Tony took a deep breath.  “Are you drunk?”
“Right,” Darcy said.  He liked the way her voice sounded, because she didn’t bother trying to make it do things that it shouldn’t.  “That’s…  That’s not helpful, Deej.”
Steve leaned in, his forehead almost brushing Tony’s.  “This is a choice we have to make,” he said, his voice quiet.  “If I’m your employee, then yes.  You can ignore everything I say.  You can just-” He shook his head.  “Do whatever you want, and I can’t stop you.
“We’re waiting for the Doc to give us the diagnosis,” Rhodey said, his head tipped forward.  He rubbed the back of his neck, his fingers biting into the skin there.  “Hopefully, he wasn’t out long.”
“No,” Tony repeated in a faint, amused sing-song of a tone.  He rolled to his feet.  “I’m not opening my house to a bunch of thugs who’ll get in the way, cause nothing but trouble, and probably make a year’s salary selling a bunch of rumors to the muckrakers.”
DJ gave him a look.  “Scared me,” he said, and for the first time since he’d reappeared, he looked like a child.  He chewed on his lower lip.  “It didn’t work.  I tried to stop it.  It…”  His shoulders slumped.  “It didn’t work.”
“Clark is a science reporter,” Jesse said, propping a hand on her hip.  “He's probably less bored than you are by, you know, science.”
DJ threw his hands in the air.  “MONKEY BREAD!”
Tony missed that ignorance.
“I apologize for overstepping my programming, sir-”
“I just think that perhaps the collection was suddenly expanded.” Tony gave Jarvis a look.  “By a significant amount.”
Tony braced his hands on the kitchen island.  “Where the hell is everyone?” he asked.
“Hmmm,” Miss Potts said, but she was smiling.
“Stay,” Steve breathed, and leaned over, his mouth catching Tony’s just as his lips parted.  From there, it was an easy thing to maneuver him back onto the bed, until he was sprawled out under Steve, his hands tangled in Steve’s hair.
Tony focused on his porridge.  The fact that he’d been ‘going over’ Ty’s classwork for the better part of the last two months was probably the reason for his test scores.  Years ago, he’d just been checking Ty’s work, fixing minor errors or cleaning up his calculations.  Somewhere along the way, though, Ty had stopped giving him completed work, and instead, just gave him the assignments.
Logan looked over at him.  “Thank you,” he said.  “The girl's okay, by the way.  She wanted me to say thanks.”
“Great,” Tony said as Clint snagged the cap of the sharpie in his teeth, ripping it free.  “So, that’s a bad idea, that’s-”
Pepper was quiet.  “Please,” she said, and it was gentle and he hated it when she was gentle.
He opened the door to the roof, stepping out into the sunshine.  The wind whipped past, and he reached into his pocket for his sunglasses.  “You don't know,” he said.  “She's out there.  Doing things.  You have no idea what those things are.”  He slipped them onto his nose.  “You should get on that, Potts.”
Natasha seemed to glide past, a knife in her hand, and Tony didn't know where she'd pulled that from, where she'd been hiding it.  She hit the doors to the balcony at a dead run, her skirts fluttering around her as she caught the railing in one hand, throwing herself up and over, disappearing into the darkness of the garden.
Tony did as he was told, mostly because it took a lot less effort than fighting it. “I do notice that it is part of our daily discussions, yes,” he said, as Jarvis settled the vest in place.  Tony rolled his shoulders, checking the fit.
“I'm sure that went well,” Ellen said.
Steve held his cup up.  “We few, we happy few, we band of brothers?” he asked, with a wry smile.
“I played baseball down in the Parade Grounds, in Brooklyn,” Steve said, as DJ rolled the ball between his palms, flicking it up into the air and catching it.  “Thank you, my lord.  That was kind of you.”
“Yes,” DJ said.  He paused, blinking.  “No.”
“Blasphemy!” Tony told him.
“Go home, Potts,” Tony said, pushing himself upright.  He wobbled on his feet, and Pepper grabbed his elbow.  “Happy Valentine’s Day.”
“For most of your life, if reports can be believed,” Phil said.
He tapped DJ on the tip of his nose.  "Things aren't always about the things they seem to be about.  Are they?"
He’d almost forgotten he’d ordered it until it showed up.  Now that it was here, he had no idea what to do with it.  The idea of actually giving it to Tony made his stomach hurt.
The hallway was quiet, Tony’s steps echoing along the length as he hurried up the polished wooden floor.  Late afternoon light filtered through the high, wide windows, catching the gilt edges of picture frames and old, well polished furniture.  Tony let his fingers trail across a table here and there, turning a vase away from the wall, straightening the lace cover on the red velvet settee.
“I do not lay the blame entirely at his door, but, yes.  He’s made quite a mess of it,” Jarvis said.  He huffed out a breath.  “All that work.  All that careful work by every member of this household, and he offers the man a job.”
“And that’s a lie,” Tony said, grinning back.  “You absolutely have.”
“It wasn't,” Rhodey said.
Steve stared at the roof of the limo, his chest aching.
DJ listened to them argue, because that was familiar and comforting and okay.  This was an okay fight.  This was a fight they could have.  He stripped off the gauntlet and turned it over in his hands.  The repulsor in the palm was dark and cloudy, but he could fix that.
“It was an entire pie,” Clint said.  The eggs were crackling in the pan, and he gave it a shake, the flames licking at the sides of the skillet. “You've got an empty leg, kid.”
“Not something I compare often, so I’m going to assume you put more thought into this than I have,” Tony said.  “Dinner’s in forty-five minutes, you think you’ll be done by then?”
“I’m sure he’ll be relieved to hear it.” Strange gestured behind him, light flaring around his hand, and the portal opened, flickering into place.  He paused on the threshold.  “Get some sleep.  Please.”
Rogers' lips quirked up.  "My ancestors would be wondering why I haven't blacked your eye yet."  He leaned in.  "And while I appreciate your approval, that wasn't what I was talking about."  He pointed at the door.  "It's bedtime, Mr. Stark."
“Know what this is?” Bucky said.  “This is the fact that you spent your entire life being incapable of getting laid, and now that you've managed it, you're-”
He stopped, and braced his hands on his knees.  “I don't know if I know how to explain this,” he said at last.
“I take it you had other ideas,” Steve said when she paused.
"We'll send you a nice thank you card," Steve corrected, his lips twitching, and Tony shook his head, mouthing, 'No, we won't.'  Steve gave him a look, narrow eyed and amused.
The sound of camera shutters followed him through the door, going silent only after it closed behind him.  Steve was waiting for him beyond security, his hands braced on his hips.  “You shouldn't encourage them,” he said, giving Tony a dark look from beneath his lowered brows.
“Oh, yes.”  She was checking the valves now, slow and methodical.  “And I do.”
“Do you think I care?” Tony asked.
She gave him a look.  “Yes.”
“Party at Jane’s place,” Clint said.
She smiled at Callie. “Hello, Callie,” she said, her voice full of warmth.  “We've been looking for you.”
“So, this is new.”
“It might be that,” Clint said, grinning.  He took the jam from Bobbi.  “Also, he's gotta replace us.”
“And there's another fifty little boys where DJ comes from,” Steve said. “Who weren’t lucky enough to get picked.” He paused, letting that sink in. “Most of them probably never saw a movie, either.”
Happy glanced in his direction, but he didn’t say anything.  Steve felt his mouth twist into something approaching a smile.  “They threw everything they had at him, as fast as they could.  If that failed, they’re going to fall back, wait for us to relax.  Then they’ll try again.”
He took a step to the side, trying to move around Steve, and Steve moved with him, one hand coming up to rest gently on the center of Tony’s chest.  Tony looked up at him, his face unreadable, and Steve smiled at him. “What, I can’t have a favorite side of the bed?” he asked, because everything else would be a lie, or far too obviously the truth.
“Thank you, ma’am,” he said.  He wrapped his hands around the cup, savoring the heat.
“Well, we live in one of the largest cities in the world, and everyone who lives here has a cell phone with a camera attached, so...  Yeah, there's a lot flying around social media, but most of it's junk.”  Ellen could hear her typing.  Jesse attacked her keyboard like it was trying to escape, every time she used it.  “There's one, here, I'll send it to you.”
“This way,” Tony said, his voice tight, and Steve fell into step behind him, hovering a little too close for comfort, but unable to convince himself to back off.  For his part, Tony didn’t object.
“I live my life by a precise and ordered plan,” Tony said, considering the holographic designs that hovered in front of him.  With an imperious flick of his fingers, he discarded the entire file.  Nothing but a waste of his time.  Again.
“I’m not seeing that as a plus,” Tony said.
“No, we're not.”  Sam stood.  “Steve.  Look.  Six months from now, what will you regret?  Taking the chance, or not taking it?”
"In my defense, I assumed I was going to leave him to take the fall for it," Natasha said.  She cracked eggs into the bowl, one after another, separating the shells with deft, easy movements.  "I'm still quite disappointed that he managed to take me down with him."
He reached out, pushing Steve's hair away from his forehead.  “Sam's coming,” he said, because that had to be a comfort.  “He'll be here soon.  Okay?”
Tony mumbled something against his shoulder, his breath hot through Steve's shirt.  Steve pushed his hair back from his forehead.  "How're we feeling?"
"What else would he have?  Everyone knows the French are the best, when it comes to food, and Mr. Stark always makes sure to have the best," Natasha said.  There seemed to be a joke there, that Steve didn't understand, but he smiled anyway.  She turned off the sink and lifted the kettle full of water out of the gleaming sink.  She ducked around Clint to set it on the stove.  "What do you want for breakfast?"
Steve skidded to a stop, the lid held up in front of him like a shield.  “Get him OUT of here!” he said, locking eyes with Tony.  “NOW.”
“Hey, you don't even know what I'm going to say!” Peter said.
The kiss stretched on until he felt his head spinning from lack of air, and when they broke apart, he didn't go far, his head just falling against Steve's chest, laughing against Steve's shirt, against his throat. Steve's hands were on his waist, on his hip, and he was laughing into Tony's hair.
Tony unlocked it.
Steve jammed the pants into his bag, ignoring the way that Jarvis winced.  “I doubt the master of the house will welcome a visit, Jarvis.” He grabbed a shirt, making a halfhearted effort to fold it before he tossed it into his bag.  His throat felt tight.  “He’s only interested in a paid employee, and as it turns out?  I don’t have any interest in that position.”
Tony let his eyes roll up towards the ceiling.  "Fine.  Thank you."  Rogers' eyebrows arched, and Tony hid a smile behind his coffee cup.  "You proved an adequate replacement for an eight year old street urchin.  Your ancestors should be very proud.” He pointed the cup at Rogers.  “You should be proud."
Steve stared at him.  “What.”
“What the hell am I fired from?” Sam asked, and Steve was laughing. He didn't know why he was laughing, but he was. Sam glanced at him, his expression worried. For some reason, that only made Steve laugh harder. “Steve? Buddy? You okay, man?”
Tony ripped a croissant in half and took a bite.  Then he reached behind him, pulling the hood of his sweatshirt over his head and pulled his sunglasses from his pocket.  He opened them with a flick of his wrist and slid them onto the bridge of his nose.    He spread his hands.  “Incognito Tony Stark,” he said with a grin.
The wave of relief that rolled over him was enough to leave him gasping for breath.  He nodded, his head still supported by Steve’s fingers.  “If we…  Go far enough.”
“And Stane said we’d drop him in the river.  To just-”  Hammer’s face twisted.  “Shut him up, and we’d put him in the river, and that’s not-  That’s not what I thought-”
“Go home!” Hank said, and, laughing, Tony let the curtain fall back into place.
“You just want a cookie, don’t you?” Steve managed, and Tony burst out laughing.  Steve closed his eyes, and let the sound wash over him, and it was right, it was perfect.  Perfect enough that he could take a step back, breaking the physical contact in slow, incremental movements, and not have it hurt.  He caught Tony’s hand, lacing their fingers together.  “Come on.  You can keep me company while I clean up.”
Tony met Steve's eyes, his expression almost desperate. Steve gave him an innocent look. Tony's jaw went tight. 'Help me,' he mouthed, something uncomfortably like affection stirring in his chest.
“We all had you, too,” Jess said, her long black hair sweeping over her shoulder as she leaned forward.
“Underground DJ, blogger, vidcaster?” she asked.  “Woman about town?  Professional gossip?”
“Box.  Coat.  Go home,” Peter said.
DJ nodded, and looked at the Stranges.  As one, the reached for the double doors at the back of the chapel.  They pushed the doors open, and there was something on the other side, something and nothing all at once, a swirling mass of color and light and matter, and Tony’s stomach turned over.
“Sure it is,” Rhodey said.  He shifted the bag, squinting into the depths, before coming up with the fattest of the pastries.  He sniffed at it, a look of bliss flickering over his face.  “First one on his back, I guess, but still, this is what he does.  He gets ink.”
“Cool,” she said, and her camera came up, one last shot before Ellen was dragging her away.
Pepper leaned against the tree next to him, her hair loose and her cheeks flushed as she sipped her wine.  Rhodey settled in for a nap, his head in her lap, and Pepper chatted with Natasha and Bobbi, her fingers playing idly over his hair.  Bobbi was working on her third flower crown of the afternoon, weaving together the stems of clover, mums, dandelions and daisies, the flowers plucked from the pile in Natasha's apron.
“Yes,” Jarvis said.  He reached for the visitor’s chair, dragging it away from the desk and settling down into it, his hands folded in his lap.  “I suspect, however, that you don’t like to admit to it, because it’s easier to be praised for quick thinking and creativity under pressure than it is to be blamed for a precise battleplan not working out to quite your satisfaction.”
Tony walked towards Bruce, bracing himself on each station as he passed. “Banner.  Buddy.  Time to get some sleep.  Perhaps twenty plus hours of sleep?  I know you’ve been running on fumes for the last few days, and that’s great-” He stopped.  “That’s…  That’s not great, actually.  Rewind.  You’ve been running on fumes, and we appreciate it, but it’s done, we’re done, we made it.”
"They are saying," she said, the words thin and tight, as if they were being forced out from between clenched teeth, "that you, Tony Stark, married Steve Rogers last night."
“Of course, sir.”
Clint shrugged.  “I take what I can get,” he said, shoving a pile of noodles into his mouth.
Peter’s shoulders slumped.  “Yes, sir.”
Sam grinned.  “I’m being supportive.  As your most ‘I got my shit together’ friend.”
“Of course.”  She looked at Steve, a faint, amused smile curling her lips.  “If you'll just follow me, Officer, I'll show you the way to the dining room.”
The words died in his throat.  Home.  Come home.  What right did he have to say that to a child, to this child?
“If it's moldy, don't eat it!” Jess called after him.
“Well then, I’ve got good news for you,” Steve said.
Steve was getting used to getting little to no sleep.
Tony groaned into his coffee cup.  “No.  We won't.  Because we aren't having a reception, Jan.”
“I’m shocked, appalled and proud in equal amounts,” Tony said.  “Pride’s growing, though.”  He looked at DJ.  “So.  What’s new?”
Steve stared up at him, his mouth working helplessly.  Tony grabbed him by the front of the sweater.  “Did you-  You gave me roses.”  He leaned in, urgent about it.  “Those were my roses.”
“Yes,” DJ said, his voice firm, flipping the book open.  With the utmost care, he started turning the pages, studying each one in turn.
“I’m well known for my understatement.”  Tony glared at Bruce, already halfway out of the workshop door. “You, don’t you dare, I will have you shot.”
She looked down her nose at him, regal as a queen.  “I get to keep all the dessert leftovers.”
“Yeah, just like Strange, I’m not looking forward to explaining to your father what happened to you, when he inevitably shows up.”  He took a sip of the juice. “Because I know just how stubborn I am when I decide something needs doing, and I know what I’m like when I’m in a bad mood.”
“Mr. Stark.  We have a meeting.”
Tony nodded.  “What was your play?”
"Because...  You've got big feet?" Jan asked.
She tried not to laugh.  “The numbers?  You mean, like, the odds?”  The kid nodded, and Trip pulled up the booking calendar.  “And if there’s ever a place that can tip the odds in your favor, I guess it’s Vegas.”  She looked from him to the blonde man and back.  “When are we rolling the dice on this?”
“You followed us,” Tony said, rubbing a hand over his face. “Fuck, I know that was you.  I saw you, when I checked into the hotel.”
Harris sighed.   “So a few things have happened in the last few years, that doesn’t mean-”
“Right, this is-”
He gave a cursory look out the peephole before opening the door.  “Sorry to keep you waiting,” he said, as the steward rolled the cart in.  “Just-”  He waved at the coffee table.  “Put it there, please?”  He reached for his back pocket, remembering too late that his wallet was in the inner pocket of his tuxedo jacket.
“Right.  So.  Dinner?” Steve checked his mirrors, hit the turn signal and merged into traffic.
“Oh!”  He choked on a laugh.  “Thank you.  That's-”  His head fell forward.  “Thank you, that's very nice of you.”  She smiled, her shoulders relaxing, and Tony smiled back. “That's very nice of you,” he repeated, right as the door to the coffee shop opened and Pepper poked her head in.
“Ah, does he?” Tony asked, trying to make it sound like the answer meant nothing to him.
“Tony,” Steve said, and Tony shrugged.
Steve’s eyes darted between them.  “It’s okay, really, I-”
“Imagine the scene,” Clint said, his head tipping in Steve’s direction.  “Me.  Standing there like a wax dummy, hugging a vase, looking every inch like the idiot I am.  Nat, clinging to the shelves about eight feet off the floor.  Stark and Rhodes and Potts all standing at different doors, guns cocked and ready to fire.   And Nat goes-”  He paused, his lips twitching.  “‘It seems like you could use some additional staff.  We should never have gotten this far.’”
“I know.”  The words were soft.  Gentle.  Tony opened his eyes, and Jarvis was standing in front of him, a steaming bowl cradled in one hand.
She stood.  “I’ve read your file.”
“I'm your sister, I'm not DJ's sister,” Val pointed out.  “To DJ, I'm just a girl.”  Her foot hit again, a little faster than it had last time, and DJ's head tipped to the side.  “And I get to be friends with him, too, just because you think you're all grown up, doesn't mean I get left behind, Franklin, it's RUDE.”  The word was said with sharp finality.  Rude was bad.  Everyone knew rude was bad.
“Right,” Steve said.  “Right.  I think-”  He stopped, a pounding at the hotel room door interrupting him mid-sentence.  “And that’s either the most enthusiastic hotel cleaning staff ever, or Isaiah is here to yell at me to get my ass in gear.”
Steve shook his head, pushing himself up.  “Want to make something?”
“Clean up and get upstairs to set the table,” Tony said, ambling towards the door, “and I'll see if we've got anything in the freezer.”  He glanced back.  “Thirty minutes, various disasters.”
But then Clint replied, with as much nonsense as he had before, and Steve wondered what the hell was happening here.
“A bus, actually, but-”
"Of course, we're not savages," Peter said, his nose in the air, and his aunt flicked him in the head with a napkin.
“A little bit, yeah.” The agent guided him into a pew as another one started unrolling yellow caution tape.
“Too late,” Clint said, swinging the car into a wide turn and heading them off the strip.  “Magicon time, everyone!”
"It's disingenuous, that's all I'm saying."  Steve slapped the menu down.  "In any case.  I already ordered."
"How did you catch it?"
“Don't worry, he keeps the truly outrageous things for himself,” Pepper called.  “There's plenty of more staid selections in the closet to the right of the entrance.”  She held out a hand to DJ, who allowed himself to be coaxed off the stairs.  “Pick whatever fits, and that you're comfortable with.”
May these whispers, as small and weak and disjointed as they are, make things a little easier for you, when ever you find them.
