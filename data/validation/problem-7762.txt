This man.
The garter belt was permanently fixed to the stockings, and Steve figured that was for the best after the issues he’d had with the apron. He put the doll back down on the desktop, realizing that he probably should have added these first. With a shrug, he flipped the skirt up.
Tony swallowed, and willed for the man to turn so he could see his face, but there was only a sliver of a profile. It must be a mistake: his young brain was playing tricks on him. Wouldn’t be the first time.
Tony looked at how the slight roundness tapered off into the strong muscles coiling at the flanks and on the planes of the back, divided into two perfect pointed triangles. How the muscles under his armpits made the flaring of his impossibly large waist to shoulder ratio even more obvious, and how the tension in Andrew’s still body was cranking up and up and Tony had to smile at the very obvious effort the man was making at keeping absolutely still. He was either getting anxious or excited, and perversely, Tony wasn’t sure which notion was making him more aroused. It was very satisfying to observe how Andrew was dealing with the zero feedback or instruction from his dominant sex partner.
Tony checked himself in the mirror and sighed. He still looked so stupidly young; how was he going to convince the moneybags that he knew what he was talking about? Well, know thy opponent. He should start with the young and rich, make his ideas of global communications something people talked about and then move on to where the actual funding decisions were made. He adjusted his cuffs, took one last look into the mirror and left the dressing room.
This was a security detail, and Steve was supposed to be too stupid for most of it, right. “It just seemed like a thing we should do,” he tried to hedge.
“Come,” Tony said, and as if pulled by a string, Steve followed him to the kitchen.
Tony stared at the man. Of course. Suddenly, it all became too clear. First, the letters were most definitely fake, the whole situation Obie orchestrated in order to get his men to watch Tony. But on the other hand, he didn't want a security detail handpicked by the man who was currently his most dangerous adversary.
Steve is lying back on the couch, his entire form relaxed, propped up between a mount of throw pillows and smiling up at him. He’s gloriously illuminated by the lights in the penthouse; it’s night and the absence of natural light and its progression gives Tony even more of the feeling that he has been riding Steve for hours.
! It’s not! He probably wasn’t even that similar; his mind had been playing tricks on him last night, and he’s just so pathetic that he fell for it. Fucking idiot.
Tony rubbed Andrew's chest, went over his nipples several times, sucked the skin under his ear into his mouth. Andrew's breath hitched; his body went taut as if he was holding himself back and when Tony stepped away, he stayed as if Tony's voice was the only thing that could propel him into moving.
“I’ll leave you to your work then,” Stane said when Anthony remained silent, “but don’t overwork that beautiful head of yours.” He got up.
Relief warring with dread, Steve wondered what could’ve happened.
Swallowing heavily, Andrew was standing in front of him, muscles coiled as if wanting to move, but holding himself back. His cock was at full-mast and straining, ready to go. Tony hummed appreciatively and slowly, pulled down his own zipper. Andrew’s gaze was single-mindedly staring at his progress but that only made Tony move at an even more sedate pace. With deep satisfaction, he started lowering his jeans.
Even as a small guy, he still had the presence to go with it. Tony had always known how to sell it. The familiarity of Anthony displaying such a big attitude made Steve feel as if he were sliced right open, but fortunately, his facial muscles had stopped reacting to his emotions some time ago.
They’d had this discussion often enough, and Steve had told Tony time and time again in no unclear terms that there was no alternative to doing the right thing. Now Steve was a hypocrite a thousand times over, but he would do right by Tony.
Trying to calm his breathing, Tony turned around and eyed the backseat. He pulled the hard backseat cushions apart, crawled into the trunk and felt for the emergency lever. Thankfully, the murdering morons had overlooked this safety feature and in less than two minutes, Tony was out and sprinting back towards his apartment building.
“Don’t be like that, darling. Don’t tell me you had any doubts I would be back.” Tony grinned at him and he was damned if he didn’t see Steve’s eyes soften and his mouth twitch.
BETAS (in the order or appearance!):  ASchmidts, Bae, VTHX  ----- <3   Thank you so, so much!!   :D
The wrapper tasted of nothing. There was nothing bad about the placement in itself, but the feeling in Steve's stomach from meekly allowing Tony to do whatever he wished was potent.
“Agent Lowell is one of our best assets, and she will be your protective detail from now until 7 a.m. today. Agent Madden is on back-up and Stevens and I will cover the day shift.”
He didn't wait for confirmation, just grabbed his jacket and was out of there. Steve was pretty sure that he wouldn't stay with building security for long.
“...never enough… alone back here… only once… all over again…”
Tony and—
His coping mechanisms had always been more varied than Steve's. Punching bags were not for him. He shouldn’t be thinking of that right now. He’d always preferred to escape mentally into his workshop, or fucking, or later, he had also liked eradicating the enemy one repulsor blast at a time. Drinking —
Vaguely, he heard her getting her radio out to tattle on him, but he was already sprinting away in the dim light of the parking levels. He ducked behind a car, waited a bit and dashed behind another. He heard Lowell running after him, but she’d taken off towards the elevators, so he waited a couple of minutes more to let her get on, before quietly jogging towards the stairs.
TY so much for reading! <3
“Under control,” Steve said. He didn’t say how thin that control was at times. There was nothing either of them could do about it anyway.
The way Stevens froze for a moment made a shiver of pleasure run down his spine.
Garett just sighed.
It hadn’t been about ‘some bimbo.’ Daniels was about to become the chief of Hydra’s recruiting offices, and Steve’s patience had run out at the same time as Daniels was recounting the exploits of his weekend.
Steve hums a low note. He doesn’t sound anywhere close to coming. He sounds relaxed, amused, turned on but for all the wrong reasons.
He had done his morning run, or rather post-sleep run. It was something that had seemed to fit nowhere when they started the security detail, but by now he had got a sort of routine where he managed to sleep, run, and be around often enough to know what was going on upstairs.
“You thought you needed to get into other people’s business?” Steve knew that there was no answer required from him. Tony had told him to keep his mouth shut. “Or did you expect her to be thankful afterwards? Maybe give it up?”
“I know I overreacted last night,” he’d told his CFO the next morning. “I’m sorry.”
Some heads turned when they came back to the main hall, but no one seemed interested enough to keep staring. They made it out of the mansion and into the car, and Steve was glad that Rumlow was driving because somehow the world kept on skipping tracks. Despite having scrutinized them both at first, now Rumlow didn’t even have a lame joke to offer. Steve almost wanted him to say something. Maybe the world would start making sense again if he still felt like punching Rumlow for anything he articulated.
Steve was waiting on the terrace. He didn’t meet Tony halfway, just waited for him to peel himself out of the armor and come to him, still dripping cushion gel.
“What are you doing?” Stevens hissed, back to alert mode in a nanosecond; knuckles white around the gun and looking around frantically.
Thoroughly disgusted with himself, Steve just ran. He ran quickly, almost forgetting that he shouldn’t seem to be going too fast, but in the dark alleys he still managed to parkour over a few high fences and then jump over a couple of benches. By the time he was back at the apartment, he had worked up a light sweat, but maybe it was from stress.
The next days were mostly eventless with Steve now able to sleep through Lowell’s shift, and Anthony still ignoring him as best he could during Rumlow’s. They also built up a surprisingly solid routine with Tony working at home during Lowell’s shift, going to SI during Rumlow’s. During the fourth shift Steve had to spend in the security room, Rumlow stopped pretending that he was at all interested in taking this assignment seriously.
Steve instinctively pulled his legs up to get out of Tony’s hold.
He took the welding torch out of Tony’s shaking hands — damn, but this young body had no idea how to process adrenaline. Looming over Tony, Stane guided him to sit in the only unoccupied chair in his workshop.
“Did you secure the room beforehand?” This was just a security detail for a twenty-one-year-old industry heir, nothing else. This was a reasonable question for Steve to ask.
Not true. They didn’t die if he saved them. They wouldn’t suffer if he helped them.
On the evening itself, Lowell drove them to the venue. When she slowed to a stop in front of the mansion Anthony was invited to, Steve got out to open the door for him. Anthony stepped out into the slight drizzle that had been falling all day and closed his tuxedo jacket. He thanked Steve and, for one short moment, his eyes didn’t seem to stare into the distance but scrutinize his bodyguard for the evening.
Surprised by being addressed after being completely ignored for the last ten minutes, Steve blurted out the first thing that came to his mind, “You have an office here?”
“Yes, I still believe I was right. Have
Last time they’d waited for over half an hour before Lowell gave them a code phrase for “it’s useless, Golden Egg isn’t hatching.” Would they wait even longer today?
The rest of the conversation was drowned out by the rushing in Steve’s ears. He didn’t know how but he was fucking it up so badly that Pierce and Rumlow weren't even hiding their connection, two men of the same organisation but so far apart on the hierarchy ladder that they should have nothing but a polite nod between each other. Was this new in this timeline? Was fucking Tony’s life up worse than it had been the first time around or was this how it happened the first time too? Today Steve had delivered Tony to what was apparently Pierce's private party as it became clear now that Steve saw how he was making the rounds. Was this supposed to happen? Steve just didn’t know.
“Sit,” Tony pointed at a kitchen table, but this time, Steve hesitated.
Back at the apartment, Steve thought about preparing dinner. He wasn’t sure if the incident earlier today would make Anthony refuse that bit of care from Stevens, though. In a gamble, he ordered spaghetti alle vongole from La Bocca, and when it arrived, Steve set the food on the plates and went to put one down in front of Tony.
Tony laughing was something Steve hadn’t known he had missed. It hadn’t been a common occurrence in their future’s later years, but now that he’d heard it again, it was like a miracle, the sun breaking through the clouds when a thunderstorm had been rolling in just a minute ago.
Whatever happened to that other Stark, Tony would make sure he didn’t end up like him.
“94 times I have come into your ass or your mouth in 34 days.”
“And Tweedledee and Tweedledum there?”
Rumlow?!
Whatever the reaction, this was what a relationships were for, not this, whatever they had between them.
Steve had said that, and he was regretting it now, terribly. He wished he could just tell Rumlow to return to his post.
Tony wants to push back up, to get Steve off, before his body gives out, but Steve holds his head pressed to his shoulder. “At how many was the tally this morning?”
Before Steve could get his ass out of the door, Anthony was back and putting a packaged condom and a bottle of lube down on the coffee table.
Thank fuck that by now, Lowell knew better than to disturb him while he was working, but despite this, some things he needed to do behind closed doors. He waited until she was out of the bathroom and off to the living room before he retrieved his briefcase. He frowned at the data disc he took out. His security measures sucked. Right now, it was just keeping the encrypted discs in his locked briefcase that he kept near his own person at all times. The only saving grace was that no one knew that there was anything actually valuable in there.
Andrew keened, from pain or pleasure, Tony wasn’t sure, but he let the pressure up immediately, then pushed his thumbs in deeper and slowly, oh so slowly, pulled the opening wider again. This time, they groaned in unison.
“Fuck!” Andrew jerked his wrist out of Tony’s hold to grab onto the headboard again and push himself back onto Tony’s cock.
What happened then was a regular night at the apartment, only with Agent Doe Eyes looking over his shoulder, expressing her amazement at everything that she thought he could find flattering. Frankly, Tony felt insulted. The woman wasn't subtle, not at all. It was as if she expected him to be an emotionally inexperienced horny teen. Had he really been this easy at twenty-one?
That was the moment his brain caught up with all the tiny little differences between what he was experiencing now and what he was used to, and the awful way his head was aching took on a sinister meaning. The pounding inside his skull, the lazy and stiff, yet healthy indolence in his muscles — everything pointed in one direction.
His fingers stopping, Tony's heart rate picked up and unable to deny himself, he listened to whether he could hear Andrew's voice.
“Don’t answer that. But I’m telling you, you need to stop that.”
“No. Turn around, I wanna see.”
He couldn't.
Andrew made a low noise and the raging beast in Tony’s chest settled for a second.
Slowly, Steve sank down on his knees — Tony’s eyes were boring into Steve, but he didn’t cast his gaze away. He wasn’t running anymore.
Tony can hear Steve’s grin in his voice. “You’ve been busy.”
Steve laid it all out on the desk and allowed himself a small giggle.
“Hey!” the man barked.
No. That would be unprofessional.
“See? He doesn’t ask ‘why’ or starts senseless discussions. He stays as I put him.”
THANK YOU goes to the usual suspects (in the order of appearance!): Bae, ASchmidts, VTHX, and ASchmidts again ----- <3 You're the BEST!! <3
“Of course,” Stark answered, obviously too tired to hide how much Tony’s presence was wearing him out.
It was better than whatever he had been thinking of before. Steve turned around, ignoring how his neck muscles tightened up on their own accord. There was no better result to expect from any conversation with Stark. It was just wasted energy, and he was smarter for letting him blab at the wall instead of Steve.
“God,” he grunted and spilled, falling onto the strong back under him.
Going by the startled glances around the table, nobody had thought that the new CEO would have anything to say to the board. He waited until all eyes were on him and smiled politely.
He didn’t sound very threatening, though. More like a real uncle talking to a five-year-old about the jam stains on his shirt, but that was good. However much it irritated Tony, being underestimated right now was a blessing.
“It’s okay, it’s okay— hmmmpf— Was that...?”
“Go... away,” Tony wheezed out from where his face was smashed against his knees.
“You,” Steve answered before he could hold it back this time.
“Anything else I should know?” Tony asked.
Guessing why Rumlow was commended for a job well done made Steve’s blood boil. Their security measures were mostly laughable. Getting past Lowell or Madden would not be a problem to anyone who knew what they were doing. It hit him like a brick between the eyes right then: they weren’t there to protect Tony at all. They were there to invade his life as intimately as possible. At Pierce’s request. Which meant at Hydra’s request. And Steve was standing by, letting it happen.
A gala. That was a public space. Public was good; not being alone with Anthony was good.
I am sorry this took so long! Chapter 2 was unexpectedly difficult, but the third one should come along a lot quicker. Let's keep our fingers crossed!!
It had been a mistake — supposing that physical activity would help him not to think. The exertion was not making any of his inner turmoil go away. Jumping backwards, he kicked the bag and it went swinging. Well, kickboxing was still boxing, right?
Tony looked at him in confusion until the words registered and then all mirth disappeared out of his face.
Steve tried, but couldn’t keep his eyes from the mirror this time. His eyes met with Tony’s and for a split second, it looked like a shadow was distorting his features from his usual cultivated haughty and otherwise disinterested demeanor, to something painfully open and tired. Tony looked away almost instantly and the impression was gone.
The second time it happened, Steve had definitely known what was coming, and he still hadn’t put a stop to it. He’d known... had hoped as soon as he saw the look in Tony’s eyes. Had known it was wrong and still let it happen.
When they arrived, Tony got out quickly as if impatient to get to work, uncaring of how his bodyguards were supposed to do theirs.
“Stevens.” Stane gave him a nod and finally left the room.
“I was about to say ‘my slacks’ but as you are apparently not useful for even that much… Show me your tongue.”
“Then why don’t you go back into your corner and let the hope of humanity do its work?”
Leaning slightly down, bringing his face closer to Steve’s, Tony’s hand caressed his pecs, first stroking then cupping the right one and finally, gloriously pinching the nipple.
Andrew stopped, swallowed and turned. Lowering his head as if in embarrassment, he put his fingers between his cheeks.
What had he been
“Tony?”
“I wanted to do that for a long time.”
His body was not yet addicted. Not really. He could… He could drink and he'd be able to stop. Just tonight. Or just only for this. This mission.
Obie sighed. "I can understand that, I can. But it's not really about not coming to the office, Tony. Surely you can see that, right?"
Tony’s reply sounded more impatient than anything else and that made Steve breathe easier. With some luck, Tony would fire them within a day or two. There was no way that young Tony had more patience with people looking out for him than Steve’s Tony had.
Unbidden, his thoughts went to the last weapon he’d disassembled.
A little before five, Anthony went to bed, so Steve told himself to relax, and to an extent, he even managed. Still, Steve couldn’t stop himself from making breakfast albit, it was a tad later than usual. He wanted to leave it under a cover for later, but Tony reappeared out of his room at the same time as always.
“Tony, really. You are going to make me climb the stairs?”
As long as Rumlow still considered him too stupid to do anything, his cover was good. After all, the only other instance that Steve had fucked up and punched a fellow agent, had been chalked up as him not being good in high-stress situations. It hadn’t helped him advance in the SHIELD or Hydra hierarchy, but at least, no one was suspecting him of knowing Hydra (and later Chitauri) agents.
Rumlow barged in mid meal, raising one eyebrow as he looked from Anthony, sitting at the couch at one end of the room, to Steve sitting opposite, and then back again.
As there was nothing else to do, Steve lay down on the bed and tried to at least take a nap because the other option would’ve been climbing up the walls.
He locked his case again and took it with him into the living room. “I’m going to SI,” Tony threw at Lowell in passing and went to his dressing room. “Get the driver.”
Obie sighed and shook his head like one did while telling a child that they shouldn't eat so much candy.
“Get down,” Stevens barked for the third time and also got out, but before Tony had time to start panicking, he got into the driver’s seat. “We need to get out of here.”
Randomly, almost blindly, he stepped off the machine and approached another one. Shoulder press. Yeah, okay. Banishing the confusing memories of last night, he set the level and went to town with it.
The supposed bodyguard leaned down, looked Tony straight into the eye and said, “Surprise me. Stay here."
“There’s a security issue, Mr. Stark,” Agent Madden said. “Please stay in the car. Agent Lowell will protect you.”
They were driving back to the apartment when it happened. At first, Tony didn’t see the reason for it, but suddenly Agent Rumlow swore and took a sharp turn to the left.
Anthony raised a mocking eyebrow at him and the sight was so familiar that Steve gasped for air. “If you are already up anyway…” Anthony said and opened Steve’s pants. They fell, and the air felt cool against his skin. He wasn’t— He shouldn’t— All those thoughts led nowhere and a sharp smack to his thigh directed Steve’s focus back to Tony.
At the door, Tony stopped, and turning to wield a careful look at Steve, asked, “You alright?”
Tony was an idiot. Tony was such an idiot. He had no idea where to even begin. Just because the man looked like someone Tony had once been friends with...
Steve stuffed his mouth with the sandwich because there was nothing else he could think of doing or saying. Rumlow took it for acquiescence.
A knock interrupted his musings, and Tony grit his teeth. “Well, cockblocked by Tweedledee there.”
Tony assumed she’d be looking for him on the upper levels where the SI management offices were located, so he ran up two floors and while whistling, walked calmly past the receptionist and out of the building. God bless his young body for doing all that without any significant strain.
“And if it does anyway, I will be here to shoot it. Otherwise I’ll be very quietly sitting over there.”
“Let me get him,” Stane said then, “and we can get you all properly acquainted, so he can do his job and you can do yours.”
“It’s for you,” Steve answered matter-of-factly and, as expected, it took all the wind right out of Anthony’s sails.
“Andrew,” Tony said after hanging up, pretending to be immersed in the designs.
“Good boy.” Even Tony himself heard the dark satisfaction rumbling in his voice. “I’m glad you are enjoying it because I wasn’t going to go out of my way to make it good for you.” He smirked and hoped that Andrew could hear it in his voice. “You’ll just have to take your own pleasure in any way you can, but if you even
“It’s not that simple... No, I said I didn’t want to get back into it. What I wanted to know is— The moment the Annihilation Wave came to Earth things were almost like they were before. For months it felt like I— like those times were never coming back.”
“Ah, yes. Stevens, of course.” Stane put one of his unsettlingly big palms on Steve’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze. “So, how is our boy doing tonight?”
Anthony’s shoulders sagged a little before his gaze fell on Steve and he purposefully threw himself back into the chair. “What are you looking at?”
“Tell your ape to fucking let me go!” the man cried.
“If you talk like that, I feel like I should have a present for Annihilus. Beside the big explody one over there.”
As pleased as Tony was with it, Stevens dodged it easily, sidestepped him and retaliated. A part of Tony was surprised to find that he was disappointed at how simple it was to notice where the punch was planned to land and to easily execute a perfect dodge.
Steve took a breath through his nose. “Understood.”
The car ride seemed long and also not. Tony resolutely grabbed for the front door and while Madden tried protesting, Stevens just shut him up with a short “that’s fine” and went for the back seat. From time to time, Tony stretched, lifted his hand behind his head, and making sure that Stevens could see the gesture, played with his hair and tugged on it sensually.
No Obie at least. Probably hoping that if he’s not here Tony would find it more difficult to veto any of these people. Rubbing at his face, Tony briefly entertained the idea for vetoing Rumlow off the team, but no. There were too many uncertainties in this game, and the more factors Tony was sure of, the better. Keep your enemies closer and all that.
Tony didn’t answer.
There is no Steve, there is no Steve, Tony tells himself. Steve is gone, and he knew that already, damnit, why would he —
After swallowing a hopefully reasonable amount of Tylenol, he stumbled back to the bedroom for fresh clothes.
“I’m going to do some work now,” Tony said. “You can get up or stay in bed, but I’d prefer for you to get dressed and entertain me with your presence in the living room.” He got up and started dressing. “If you do come, though, don’t expect me to pay you much attention. Alternatively, if you stay here, I might be tempted to tie your hands to the headboard because no way are you touching yourself before I allow it, is that understood?”
“Hey, you sure can take stuff from the fridge but cooking yourself breakfast is a bit bold, don’t you think?”
Steve stood it up against the wall, crossing his arms on the tabletop and resting his chin on it. The smile on Doll-Tony’s face looked less annoying now. The costume just framed it in the right way. Telling the viewer that it was a special favor to them. Or that he knew what he looked like, that he knew what would happen next.
“It’s a demonstration of power,” Steve concluded. “Not functional like the lab or your workspace at the apartment.”
“And he knows how to deal with delayed gratification.”
Nobody answered him, but on the bright side, there was no shooting either, and after a tense couple of minutes of driving and listening to his heart almost beat out of his chest, the car slowed.
Anthony looked at him with that air of vigilance that Steve had noticed was there whenever he was unable to ignore Agent Stevens. His dark eyes bore into Steve and every time it happened, he had to suppress a shiver.
The concern in his voice was startling. He sounded just like… But not. No, he didn’t. He sounded lower and duller. He sounded wrong because he wasn’t Steve, and yet, he also sounded right because he wasn’t supposed to be Steve.
“Uncle Obie?” he asked, sounding careful, letting the man know that he’d noticed the intimidation technique for what it was. Despite keeping calm, his heart was pounding and his hands were sweating. He knew that at this point, physical violence was not yet very likely, but his hind brain was prickling with remembered fear.
Tony leaned on the shower wall and let the water sluice down his side. Yes. He should just fuck Andrew as soon as he arrived and then Tony could finally concentrate on his work. Turning the water off, he stepped out of the shower and dried himself.
Steve knows, but he also loves to make Tony say it.
“Ngh,” Andrew replied.
“I like that it is tiny. It’s only there for my amusement.” With that, he let the pad of his thumb brush over it. He pressed his own hip into the mattress. “See? It’s perfect for that. You are just here for me. To play with. To make use of. Just taking everything.”
The first thing he did after stepping into the stall was taking himself in hand and jerking off quickly and efficiently. Andrew would be along in a few hours, Tony could play then. He’d keep him naked at the foot of his bed, his wrists tied to the bedframe and fuck him whenever he wished, from whichever end he wished and lose himself in his drafts in the meantime. Or maybe, Andrew would just sit at Tony's feet, his cock rock hard and stare at him, his own boxers in his mouth and hope and wait for being touched and petted and fucked… Pounded into. Later, Tony would ram into his mouth so hard he would have no breath to make noise and tears would run down his beautiful face and his cock would be weeping for his touch—
“Not like this,” Tony barked again and relished seeing Andrew falter. “Get on your hands and knees. Yes, like this. Now push your ass out. Good.”
“Why can’t you just shut up for once?” It sounded less angry than Steve had expected. “Why do you always need to drive me up the wall? Is that stupid giant genius brain of yours not satisfied if it doesn’t know? Doesn’t know how far you can go?”
Tony spent the hours until the shift change with his fingers busy on an old… well, actually still a new brick game console, and his mind was occupied with a miniature pulse emitting device. He needed a small portable version that worked independently. The design was more or less finished in his head, just a few kinks to iron out, but he would only be able to do that effectively once he sat down at the drawing board.
“You were apparently made to be a whore.” He thought for a moment about that. “Designed yourself that way. You want this?” He flicked his index finger against the doll’s ass, producing a dull sound.
Decisively, Tony nodded to himself. He could do it. He had two stun-guns fixed to his wrists, he would have to put aside some time for MMA training or something… He could take a couple of thugs. “But I get to veto any of them,” he told his CFO. “If I don’t like them, they’re gone, you hear me?”
Steve let go but positioned himself between the man and Tony.
Blinking was no longer avoidable, and Steve’s gaze fell in front of him for a short moment. Tony’s button and zipper were right there and he could see his cock twitch. Tony yanked at his hair, calling his attention back to his face.
Jerkily Tony nodded. “I’m sorry, Obie, I’ll try.” He tried to remember whether he’d been so pliant in his youth, whether he was overdoing it, but couldn’t quite remember. He’d always been drunk or high and that had given him the courage to disagree with most of the things he had wanted to disagree with, but Stane had always somehow still commanded his attention and respect.
“That’s good because then you won’t be so frustrated with how difficult the brat is going to make it.”
Did Obie (or was it someone else?) really think Tony would fall in love with her if they kept inventing potentially dangerous situations for him to cower behind her figurative skirts? Maybe this time they would even send somebody in for Lowell to dispose of? Could be fun.
The tone sounded indifferent, the honorific was back and the food tasted like cardboard. Tony ate it anyway.
He would just— He would just— Steve didn’t know what he should do.
He got rid of his underwear quickly and efficiently, and deciding how to handle the doll and his own cock, kneeled down in front of the pillow holding Tony.
Steve noticed that Tony had been about to say something else, but instead, he tilted his head to the side and looked at Steve as if he was a puppy that had just performed a new trick. His smile looked intrigued.
“Do you think there will be another one?”
— to five and breathe again and calm down, because it’s not real, Steve never hit him, he was Tony’s friend, and Steve… This man is
“Tony—”
Everything seemed fine and when he entered the building, the elevator doors opened, revealing Stevens.
He grimaced at the terrible wardrobe choices with their colorful wide-cut jackets and ‘loud’ ties and found a dark gray suit he had probably worn somewhere Obie (another grimace) had told him to appear ‘proper’ for.
that it, indeed, disintegrated matter not teleported it. That it destroyed, not transported.
SUMMARY of emotional development for the last scene in case you skipped the sex:
“You’re not sleeping either,” Tony couldn’t help but point out. “Isn’t it a little hypocritical of you?” He stepped further away from the desk, stretching and yawning obnoxiously, hoping to make Stane believe that what he was hiding wasn’t actually that important. “It’s one a.m. and here you are, in the lab, an hour away from your own bed.”
Damnit, no. Maybe he could stop. Theoretically. Maybe. But most probably, he wouldn't. His addiction to alcohol had never been purely physical and any enjoyment he’d get out of it now, after all these years, would be tainted. And what if he was wrong? What if he couldn’t stop? What if he wouldn’t be able to? Could he risk falling into the bottle now?
Tony stared at Obie and suppressed a shiver of disgust. It was uncanny how strongly this youthful body processed his feelings. Tony had thought it was experience that made him the master of his own body, but it turned out that almost sixty years of wear and tear were the reason he hadn't been feeling things as keenly lately.
Tony doesn’t growl; he doesn’t talk back; he keeps on moving.
The stupid nickname hit Steve right into his solar plexus with recognition, shock (he knows it’s me, he
‘No,’ Tony thought viciously to himself, ‘no! No, no, no, no! Stop! That never happened! They never fought like that! Stop imagining things! Stop!’
In the morning, Rumlow picked Steve up at the SHIELD HQ. They started towards New York with just the two of them in the car, since Lowell and Madden would join them there. Rumlow’s rundown of their task included a lot of unnecessary commentary and was delivered in the most derisive tone possible. No matter what, Steve seemed to be unable to get on the man’s good side, and something within him was relieved about that.
Besides Obie in the armchair, his living room was filled with four people. All of them in civvies, but their bearing was very obviously militaristic. A tall man, mid thirties maybe — dark hair, heavy-set build — was sitting in the other armchair. The woman on the sofa drew his gaze — was she a lawyer or something? But no, even though she was sitting in a more attention-seeking pose than a bodyguard should, and her bearing was that of a fighter. So that was the ‘skirt’ Obie had promised... On the other end of the sofa was a handsome, vaguely familiar dark-haired man with 80s-typical slightly longer locks, and another man standing by the window, almost out of Tony’s field of vision. A tall, blond, short-haired…
Steve concentrated on keeping still, in the place Tony had put him in. All the words were washing over him. They were all true, and Tony knew him better than he did himself. There was still a vague feeling of shame lingering somewhere in the back of his head, but it intertwined powerfully with Tony wording it in a form of sweet torture. He was more turned on than the last two times and despite the derision dripping from Tony's countenance, at this moment, all Steve saw and heard was approval. Steve’s cock was pulsing and twitching painfully against the seams of its confinement and there wasn’t anything he could do about it. He’d also been sure Tony wouldn't pay it any attention either until he suddenly felt the cruel pressure increase.
To himself, Tony didn’t even pretend not to know why he did that. Although the expressions on the face were different — one might say, indifferent even — and Tony knew intellectually that the shade of the blue in his eyes had to be different, or the shape of the eyes or the nose... Because even if he was Cap’s thrice removed grandson or something, there had to be at least some differences. Despite this, a part of Tony’s brain still kept insisting that it was the same man. It couldn’t be and it wasn’t, and every time Tony had to look at him it hurt. So, in the end, he just said thank you and ate his veggies like a good boy.
“Did you come to your senses?” Steve asked.
It would’ve been much more interesting if he could order Andrew under his desk and…
As quickly as he could, Tony got up, and not wishing to see how Stevens looked post-coital, he turned his back on the bed to get dressed.
“Two weeks, okay?” Tony tried for an upbeat tone. “I’m almost finished. Two weeks and, I swear, the designs are going to be on your desk."
People had told Steve that there was nothing they wouldn’t believe if he said it with his Captain America voice. This wasn’t that voice. It wasn’t coming from a place of conviction, of knowing. It was closer to a prayer, hoping for it to be true.
He poured it down the drain.
— and froze.
It looked quite complete already. Steve didn’t need to add the garter belt and stockings and shoes. The effect was quite nice, and it got the message across.
“Thank you, Andrew.” Perhaps, it was time to start calling the man by his name. Tomorrow, he would call Aunt Peggy. For now, he would have to rest. “I’m okay,” he lied. But once he’d spoken to Peggy, it really would be okay. Maybe.
There was a sound from his living room, and with a pang Tony remembered that he had a stranger in his apartment right at this moment. A stranger. An impostor.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’re going,” he barked at Andrew, grabbed his jacket, and stormed toward the staircase. “I left my car in the level two car park.”
“Nothing of concern,” Rumlow replied. “Stevens is just taking the scenic route today.”
“So, which will it be?” he asked, turning around to pick up his shirt.
Stevens shuddered, and emboldened, Tony murmured, “Beautiful… like a doll.”
The expression was all wrong. A lot less strung out, more lax. It lacked the sharp edge of determination, the softness of compassion, and the grimness of the later years. It just looked...  more blank. The brow seemed lower, the line at the mouth… defeated. His eyes? Somehow lighter than Tony remembered. Emptier.
“Stevens,” he bit out.
Steve just set the turn signal and unfortunately, the car did follow them. He was absolutely sure that it was nothing. He’d just needed an explanation for staring.
Thank you for reading! <3
When Anthony reappeared a short while later, they didn’t talk. The drive was equally quiet and when Steve insisted on following him into the room with the reader, Anthony appeared rather irritated.
Steve did until the rigid slacks they had rented for the evening were spread painfully taut over his erection. His hands were in fists at his sides, unmoving as if tied there. Tony nodded, stepped forward, and slid his dick into Steve’s still waiting mouth. One hand came to rest in his hair at the back of his head. It was only a slight pressure, no real force but in Steve’s head there was nothing that Tony didn’t have control over.
he continued in his head, still trying to look contrite. “I do get your point,” he added, placatingly.
The nickname made Steve’s hackles rise, but now really wasn’t the time or the place for that.
Tony’s free hand came down to Steve’s throat, covering the front so that he could feel his own Adam's apple when swallowing. Tony needed to change his angle a bit for it, and the speed of his thrusts decreased while he pushed in as far as possible every time. Air was becoming scarce, and Steve was feeling lightheaded.
His back-up shift had barely started when Rumlow called.
He heard Stane moving towards the door. “You just think about that, yeah, boy?”
Stane came by Tony’s office or his lab every couple of days, ostensibly to ask him how he was doing, but Tony could clearly see that his real aim was to check whether he might be reconsidering his stance on designing weapons.
“You think?” Tony seemed to take the information in stride. “So, you
Tony went on, “It’s a question of risk management and resources. The resource here being time. Fury will be on to us soon.”
“You’ve worked on tighter schedules, I’m sure you have a solid start on them already.”
“I’m ready. You ready?” Without looking at the man, Tony nodded as if he’d received a reply. “Good. Let’s go.”
Or Hydra.
“Actually—” Tony started, only to be cut off again.
“Non-deadly force?” Tony asked, casually. He gave one of the cruder tin cans a tap on the shoulder. This Tony had had a lot of time to make design nightmares.
Tony had no idea how Steve’s body would have felt under his hands, how Steve’s skin smelled or how he would kiss. Tony would never know.
“Steve, how long have you known me? I love space.”
(See the end of the chapter for
There was a tug at Steve’s elbow and his muscles were ready to yank free when he remembered where he was.
Steve spent twenty minutes that evening in his tiny nondescript apartment packing and then three hours dreading possibly meeting Tony before deciding to go for a run. After that, he was no less wound-up, but at least he managed to fall asleep.
“Come on, come on, come’n!”
“Hey there, Stevens.” Rumlow’s ugly smile was much too close for comfort, and annoyingly, he was keeping Steve from following Tony, who had a fresh drink in hand and was moving further into the room, if Steve wasn’t mistaken, to avoid Pierce in an unobtrusive way. “Let the egg do his brown-nosing. We can keep an eye on him from the sidelines. You said yourself, security here is very good.”
“Strip,” he ordered.
this deal?” He looked as if he regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth.
It was too tight. This was wrong. This wasn’t what it was supposed to be. And Steve liked it. It was too good, too hot, too tight. The intensity crashed over him and he was going to drown, and Tony was watching him. Judging him.
He was probably asking because he was planning to disappear again. Steve wasn’t sure if Rumlow thought Steve was too dim to pick up on it or just didn’t care.
As he swept his eyes back to the traffic light, he noticed that Rumlow’s head was turned to him. “Everything alright, Agent Stevens?”
“Yes.”
“Let’s get you cleaned up.” He made to pick up Tony when he heard a noise and turned his head.
“Well enough to be buried here? Eternity is a long time.”
“I’m going to lift your skirt up again now, and you will be pleasant and patient.” He did exactly that. Doll-Tony still smiled that enamored smile.
The pain slammed into him, and Tony closed his eyes again. The feeling was familiar: a split second of wakefulness with a vague sensation of heaviness in his chest and then the sledgehammer of certainty that Steve was gone. Steve had been gone for almost a year now, and he was never coming back. It was okay. It would have to be — there was no alternative. Steve would want him to go on. To fight. To win. To live.
Steve splays a hand over his ass, touching all that belongs to him, finally trailing a finger over the point where they are connected. “How does it feel?”
“My team can go to hell,” Stevens said.
Steve put all his focus on not moving a muscle.
Panting around Tony’s thumb, Steve felt like he was a mere accessory to whatever Tony was doing. The roll of Tony’s hips had evolved into a fast slapping of flesh against flesh and he seemed to get more erratic with the ascent towards his orgasm. Tony’s fingernails were digging into Steve’s chest but the action seemed to be more like an afterthought compared to the precise placement of his thumb in Steve’s mouth. The loss of control was making Steve dizzy but also light, oh so light. Then Tony’s thumb was digging into his gum painfully, and the only thing that threatened to overcome Steve was his own orgasm. But he wouldn’t dare. Something told him that Tony didn’t want him to come, and Steve wanted so much to just do what Tony wanted.
God, Tony couldn’t wait to tie those strong, pale wrists to the headboard and fuck that deep cavity of silky warmth that talked so little and—
“Oh that is good to hear!” Anthony sounded appreciative on the surface, but Steve knew the tone very well and it meant that Tony hated every minute of this conversation.
It was driving him spare. He wanted to tell Obie to fire him, but then he’d get another wild card he knew nothing about and Stevens at least looked harmless for the most part. Still, during his shifts, Tony started locking himself into his bedrooms when he didn’t need a computer. Stevens started knocking and Tony learned to tune it out.
The sun was past its zenith when Tony picked himself off the floor.
Work. Tony added a line, drew the next one without calculating the length. He added a few more strokes, and bullheadedly went on to finish the design. Imagining what the detail would look from the other side, he pulled up a new sheet. He put a circle in the middle, added a vector—
The low demand out of Andrew’s mouth just egged Tony on and he was about to spill when he saw Andrew's right hand let go of the headboard and reach for his cock.
Still, even irritated, Tony said thank you and for the next several hours, Stevens left him alone.
“Anywhere you need to be today apart from SI, Mr. Stark?” Rumlow asked at the beginning of their day shift.
After a little while, Tony leaned onto the counter, and without turning around, said, “This thing that we’ve been doing. It can’t happen again.”
Food. Probably a good idea.
The boy was Tony. It was obvious now, in a way; the eyes, the way his mouth settled into an annoyed line... It felt somehow familiar but at the same time — 1991. Tony was supposed to be twenty-one. The boy looked seventeen, maybe. Like he had been borrowing clothes from his father’s closet.
Oh yeah, even young and scrawny, he was Iron Man.
Andrew was tight at first, and the slide in and out was torturous, but it got better very quickly. He opened his eyes to see how Andrew’s powerful body was moving in tandem with his. The moment Toyn sped up, Andrew picked up instantly. It felt so good... Oh god, Tony felt-- he would… So close so very, very soon — too soon —
“What if it takes too long? You might need to keep it together for a long time.”
His body felt different. It moved more easily, but at the same time it was weaker. Still, the trainer’s genuine surprise at Tony’s ease in picking up the moves and trying to execute  maneuvers that he hadn’t been shown yet was gratifying. Decades-long fighting experience was good for something after all. Tony didn’t tell the trainer that he was planning to use his new skills to actually fight, but he felt that the sparring was useful anyway.
Assessing the surroundings ended up being a drive around the block. “Typical high-end apartment buildings two blocks down and up. What is there to assess?” Rumlow grumbled. “If everyone’s plumbing is up to code?”
They will never do that if he doesn’t build Iron Man.
“You didn’t eat lunch.”
“Excuse me?”
After twenty minutes, Tony resurfaced, his hair still wet and curling in all directions, sweats pulled on, the shirt clinging to his body. For a moment, he froze, staring at the mug that was already waiting for him in the living room, and then rounded on Steve. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”
Peggy’s voice betrayed no worry, only consideration for the mission. She was his handler right now, not his best friend nor a past love of his life. The love of his past life.
“Uncle Obie,” Tony raised his voice to be heard in the cavernous space and walked jauntily to greet him. “What a surprise!”
Steve was startled by how bitter he sounded. “If you ask me, all it does is make you look down the barrel of bigger guns in the next conflict.”
The woman laughed, but Tony knew that this thing between them was drawing to a close. Whatever she’d set out to do wasn’t working and she undoubtedly knew it. If her assignment was, indeed, to get something from him, soon, she would be pulled out. But if not, then the whole bodyguarding scheme was in place to just off him at the right moment. In that case, he should get rid of all of them as soon as possible.
“So, here is the deal,” Tony said decisively, “you stop acting the fool, and we have sex like normal people without the threats of being arrested for public indecency.”
THANK YOU:
Tony got the feeling it wouldn’t be the first time he was on the other end of a manhunt. He knew too what it was like to be in the crosshairs, but that wasn’t the issue. “He won’t come. He will send a team.”
WARNING: In this chapter we are going explicit! YAY! But on the other hand: some of you might care that when Steve and Tony have sex for the first few times, Tony is not very nice. Not a dubcon, but unnegotiated kink for sure. Also muddled feelings. There are many reasons for why Tony is as he is, but keep in mind that it’s also Steve’s POV, so he might not see everything.
The next part, Tony wasn’t looking forward to.
joining the conversation and damn it, Tony resigned himself to playing the respectful youth he had never really been.
Leaning on Tony’s Mitsubishi GTO was none other than Obie himself: one hand in his pocket, the other holding a cigar that he was slowly smoking. The most unnerving though, was that for once, he wasn't even trying to hide his displeasure.
He thought of little Natasha somewhere in Russia being already trained to be a Red Room agent. And Clint and Bruce in their shitty situations wherever they were. He would help them. He would, but not yet. For now, eradicating Hydra had to take priority.
Andrew shivered and his breath hitched but he didn’t answer.
here. Surely, Rumlow wouldn’t have agreed to Lowell ruining that. And she was – what? Almost thirty. Tony was twenty-one! And he looked sixteen!
He should cut that off at the legs. Just stand up and go to the kitchen, leaving Andrew to sit on his haunches. What would Andrew do? Would he protest? Or accept it in his serene state? Or maybe he’d get distressed and Tony would have to deal with a subdrop?
“Sure, my boy, sure!” Stane agreed exuberantly. “I’ll just make sure there’s a pretty skirt for you to enjoy, shall I?”
“What’s up, old man?” Tony cried jovially, probably overcompensating.
He didn’t look like he was joking.
The decision was already made, but Steve still paused for a moment. There would be no stopping after this. It was the admission that they would be doing it over and over and over again. If Tony let him. Because there was no way of denying that Tony was holding the leash here. If Tony wanted him, he would be on his knees every time.
“Are you alright?”
He moved one arm so the hand was covering Tony’s mouth as if he was smiling shyly.
“Where are you going?” Alarmed, Lowell grabbed Tony’s elbow. “You can’t go out now! We don’t know if it’s safe.”
Steve sank back into his thoughts. He needed to face it. He was about to meet Tony. A Tony. Not his Tony — he needed to keep that in mind. Maybe he should not call him Tony, not even in his head. Stark? No. Anthony? Maybe. Tony junior? Young Tony?
Steve lets go of his neck, and Tony pushes himself up, his arms trembling. It takes him a minute to get back into the rhythm. Steve watches him, considering as if he has doubts that Tony can do it. He has done this three times already today. He can do it a fourth time.
He dropped his arms and strode towards Stevens who was now standing at a weight rack. Even with the blank expression he mostly wore, the man was ridiculously gorgeous. Tony felt like slapping his face to see at least some kind of emotion on it, but hey, he had boxing gloves on and there was a ring less than ten meters away.
“A lot of things changed.”
Steve wanted to smash her face in.
“But you aren’t Tony Stark, are you? Not here, not now. You’re my doll. And that means I can do what I want to you.” Steve tightened his hold until he could feel the plastic give a little and instantly let it go again. “And I can take care of you as I want.” He lifted his fingers to rub around the chop of dark hair but the feel was all wrong. Instead, he trailed his finger over the pleats of the dress again. “Because that whole ‘Playboy, Genius, Billionaire’ bit? It’s not good for you either.”
Tony was getting hard, and he wasn’t even at the end of his stack of documents yet. Besides, it was Madden on the other side of the wall today. He couldn’t have Stevens no matter how tempted he was to give in to his urges right now.
his face; these were his facial features, and yet it was all
, he was
“Oh you
“Tony.”
“Wow, yeah, that is a bit too much…” Rumlow said.
Trying to look helpless, he scratched at the back of his head, purposefully messing his awful bed hair up even worse.
Tony blinked, but noticed that Stevens’s shoulders relaxed a fraction and after a block, he finally turned back towards the apartment. When close, however, he raised the partition and then drove right past their building.
“You alright there? Boxing not enough of an exercise to loosen you up?”
The liquid grace with which Andrew got up made Tony’s breath hitch as he watched it from the corner of his eye. Going by the seductive sway with which Andrew’s hips moved, he’d probably noticed.
Steve had to concede the point. Those rooms were nothing like this. The only thing that this office was probably good for was doing paperwork and even that might have looked out of place on the giant desk.
“Please, eat.”
The elevator ride was laden with tension and Stevens looked as if he was desperately trying to keep himself still.
Aha! The proposal he’d been waiting for! He trailed his gaze over it, then read it more thoroughly. Signed it. Next.
“Are you all back now or do you need tea and a blanket?” Tony said gruffly.
It felt great.
“I like the company well enough.”
Unsurprisingly, Obie had sent him a car, and also unsurprisingly, there was no one more surprised than Obie when Tony turned up. To be fair, the first time around, Tony had ended up not going to his very first board meeting — and to the one after that he’d turned up drunk, if he remembered correctly. Secretly cringing at his own behavior as a young head of the company, Tony vowed to do better this time around.
His fatherly tone set Tony’s teeth on edge.
“You,” Tony almost growled nonsensically as he stopped in front of Stevens. “Get into the ring.”
Almost wanting to grin, Steve purposefully repeated, “No.”
“Oh you want
People always died.
Steve threw a glance at her over his shoulder. She was in training clothes. This might not have been a good cover for any other 70-year old, but for Peggy Carter, no one would bat an eyelash. On the tapes, she would later be seen to enter the ladies changing room and then go to the gym as she always did on Thursdays. Luckily, both locker rooms and showers were connected by an equally unmonitored corridor for the cleaning personnel.
Trying to appear defeated, Tony nodded. “I’ll think about it.”
Jerking back in surprise, Tony kept staring at him for a long moment before he finally nodded. He turned back to the counter and took two mugs out of the cupboard.
“Are you okay? Can I get you anything?”
I take emojis and key smashes as feedback and processes them into endorphins. Thank you! :)
"Brilliant," Tony said distractedly, all his instincts screaming at him to watch his back.
“This is indeed a much better way of doing this.” Tony finally had his cock in hand and was stroking it slowly, with a mocking grin on his face.
WARNING: In this chapter and the next, Tony has sex with an original female character. It's not explicit, but it happens repeatedly. In the end, neither will suffer any emotional or any other sort of harm from this, but if you want to know more, contact me on Tumblr @Serinah80.
Suppressing his stupid feelings about people similar to other people whom Tony was not thinking about was making him angry, so he decided to go to the gym and release some of that pent-up aggression.
“You and every CO I’ve ever had.”
Before leaving, the delivery came for the kitchen, and Steve put all the food items away into their designated cupboards. Steve ordered steaks, because it was one of the few things he knew how not to ruin, and a ton of healthy snacks he could put around the apartment in an attempt to remind the kid that he needed food several times a day.
Tony was not stopping. The high was turning into the unpleasant friction of too much sensation, and Steve’s eyes snapped back open.
Steve managed to swallow his automatic snort. The idea of Tony Stark ever wanting to be protected was hilarious enough that he could easily ignore the rest of the tasteless comment. Neither of the other two agents reacted to the words either, apparently refusing to pander to Rumlow’s sensibilities, but Steve was quite sure that Lowell was secretly annoyed. The woman’s face was placid, but something in her unmovable demeanour was too still. Steve himself, however, was much more irritated by Rumlow than usual. He would have to watch that.
“Until it was the end of the world. Again.”
, as I say. Understand?”
* Another sex scene in the last part of this chapter. What some people might want to be warned about is that Steve is PTSDing hard and he’s losing time, etc. It looks like he’s not entirely there to give informed consent, but it is not visible to Tony at all. And the important bit is that Steve is never going to regret it or feel bad about it. So I hope that neither will the reader. But just in case, I will give a short rundown of facts at the beginning of ch7 too, so you may skip this scene after Tony drags Steve away from the incident at the gala.
“Still not big on words, huh?” Tony took the foil packet and magicked the condom on as fast as he could. “Okay, soldier, hold your horses — it’s time for the big gun.”
“So, he’s not dead?”
Stevens, not—
“I’m not starting the argument from the top again. Just tell me.”
“You kept us waiting.”
His voice, already loud due to its natural booming quality, grew harsher, and a part of Tony, the younger part, withered inside. Another part, on the other hand, froze and hardened like ice spreading through his body. He wanted to lean back and punch Obie in the face, tell him to step down as the CFO, and just generally go fuck himself, but he knew what the most likely outcome to that would be. Tony would be locked out of the board of directors, and the man in front of him would remain a
Weirdly, Steve still heard affection behind the mocking tone, but wasn’t sure if he was imagining it, so he didn’t reply.
So. That was done. Stevens knew now where they stood and so did Tony.
“Your footwork’s sloppy,” Stevens commented without inflection.
“Mr. Stark,” Stevens said, holding the door open for him.
Steve figured it out right away. Stark trying to talk around him in circles hadn’t worked one bit. Of course, it hadn’t. But Stark didn’t stop it, not when Tony had told him to, not the first time and not the second. Almost as if he had more interests than to just distract them.
For chrissake! "I've eaten," Tony yelled through the closed door. "Get your ass in here, Stevens!"
CFO and CEO: victorious. So for the moment, Tony had to be satisfied with just taking a step back from Stane’s looming presence and looking away.
Tony snorted. “And you’re the real deal.”
“I’m getting close,” Steve says, and Tony lets out a sigh of relief against his will.
“When
“I can do it,” Steve said bullheadedly despite already having fucked up in the past. “No one knows that I know, and I will keep it that way.” He was determined to succeed. He mostly played dumb these days. He couldn't hide his physical abilities entirely, but he could try to seem like a regular capable agent that was only slightly stronger and faster than average. He could be all brawn and no brains for everyone who cared to look.
currently working in our factories. They are not all wealthy, Tony. I expected you’d understand that much.”
“Family, huh?”
Tony shook his head to get his thoughts back on track, but something about the parade rest the blond had assumed was bothering him. When Obie said something, the blond man turned slightly and stepped fully into his sight.
So that was how it was.
“Does that mean you’ll finally stop hovering in the rec room every morning?”
“Keep it that way, Steve. I have grandkids, and a twenty-one-year-old godson in charge of a multimillion empire to worry about. I can’t have you blow your cover because the mere sight of a Hydra agent is too much of a temptation.”
Stevens’s head jerked ‘no.’ Somehow, without taking a parade rest, Andrew suddenly looked just like a soldier anticipating his CO's orders. Breathing easier, Tony went on, "Because I'm going to tell you what's gonna happen here, so pay attention."
He sat down with his secretary's folder of social invitations and carefully chose several events that would have his board members and potential investors for the new satellite present. He would need to make nice with them.
His fingers felt their way along the straps to the garter belt. As broad as his fingertip was, it inevitably touched the doll’s cock. “And if you’re a good boy…”
He pulled the covers up and rolled to his left to face it head-on. After another moment of hesitation, he reached out his right. His hand hovered over the small form and there was the thought of just pushing down pressing it further into the pillow with ever more force. Instead, he put his finger down at the base of its neck, feeling the white lace collar ruffle.
Stevens stepped into the ring and even before raising his hands, said, “Your shoulders are tense.”
Steve pulled one hand back to press the heel of it against his own straining erection, stifling a moan.
The voice in his head snorted, and Tony pulled up a new file.
Tony turned back to his design. “Yes, thank you, Andrew.” He shuffled with the papers. “You can kneel here,” he added as if in an afterthought.
“What? In your world, everything is always sunshine and rainbows, and you always are on the same side?”
“Wanna see more?” Tony asked, pausing.
Steve went straight to his room, where he put the package down on his desk and took a step back. Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to forget about the encounter. He wouldn’t let Stark ruin this. The opposite, actually. For once, Stark would be the butt of the joke.
burst into the room.
He smashed his room’s door harder than he had planned, but luckily, it didn’t break. He needed it more than any other day right now. If only as a reminder, that he had to actively choose to go back out there and do something about Stark. To him.
“I need to check something.” Rumlow got out of the car. “Stay here.”
“Jet engines? But they already exist,” Steve supplied instead.
“Glad I managed at least that.”
Technically, Steve wasn’t lying even if La Bocca hadn’t existed when Steve grew up and he’d never eaten clams before Tony took him to his favorite restaurant to try his favorite sea dish.
Half an hour later, ignoring Rumlow’s protests, Tony left him outside of his private laboratory on the SI R&D floor, (Stevens was presumably with the building security) and went in. There, pushing away every distracting thought and feeling, he worked. Getting his digital designs into post-processor and checking how it interpreted his schematics was cumbersome, but still so much better than the pen and paper method he’d been forced to go back to in his last year in the future. On the other hand, it was also too easy a task. His thoughts kept running away from him, the low-level anxiety running under his skin for no obvious reason was unsettling.
“I get that it’s tough with your mom and dad gone and it might seem that death is everywhere, but guns had nothing to do with what happened to them, Tony. What our company does had nothing to do with their deaths. I know you know this!” He let go of Tony and sighed a world-weary sigh as if he, too, was suffering from the loss. “Their deaths are hard to bear, but it doesn’t change the fact that we
He grinned coldly at Steve, “We’ll get to that in a minute. You’re so desperate for it. You need someone to screw your brains out so badly, don't you?”
God, how naive he’d been!
“I think that is enough.” Steve ended the conversation. Tony was staring at them startled.
He would never be able to fight any Chitauri without the armor.
Unable to vocalize anything right at that moment, Tony nodded again and stepped back. Stane let him.
Standing hunched over the schematics laid out across his expanse of his desk, Tony gritted his teeth and pretended to study them. Ignore him, he told himself. He just had to ignore Obie and he would go away.
He needed to make sure Obie wouldn’t start lobbying against him, so he’d met with Obie’s shady business partners and made nice. He hadn’t promised them anything, just let himself be paraded before them like a prized pony and smiled. If Obie promised them anything behind his back, it was his problem.
He shook his head to dispel the image and pulled out another blank sheet to draw the magnetron for the wave generator. Somebody knocked at the door, but if they really needed to be in the room they would have access, so Tony tuned it out. After a while, the knock turned insistent and then died down. Good.
He gestured vaguely at the documents on his desk and mercifully, Stane nodded.
Since Madden didn't really care about Tony's safety and cared even less about hiding it, Tony jumped into the driver's seat and drove fast. At the apartment, he left Madden in the front room and marched into the shower.
“Even better. Stevens, get Madden to drive when Mr. Stark is ready to leave.”
Tony trailed his blunt nails down along Andrew’s spine and ended with his thumb between the ass cheeks. For just a second he pressed his thumb just above the hole, let up and pressed again, this time while dragging it down and over the hole. It couldn’t have been very pleasant, but that was the point. He held his thumb there, just on the hole; pressing, almost pushing it in dry, but not really.
Tony ignored him. He got onto the back seat, stared out the window, and wondered if Obie knew who exactly he was employing. He wondered why SHIELD really regarded Tony so important to national security at such a young age. Even Obadiah Stane wouldn’t be able to simply loan four people from SHIELD for bodyguard duty… Oh. Peggy. Aunt Peggy could have approved it, but even then, there should have been a reason that was good enough to put into reports.
Another eight hours went by before they drove Anthony back to the apartment. And then, unexpectedly, the rest of the team were called off on a short mission making Steve pull another shift alone with him. This was concerning. It was clearly a Hydra mission, but on the other hand — would Steve want to leave Anthony alone or leave the job to an unknown agent? No.
Would that be too much?
“There are.” Steve was more or less done with his shower, so he was just standing there, letting the water run down his back. “I’ve seen the covert looks, and it’s not just the conversations I’ve been excluded from. Not all the team members are rotated equally. There are some missions that only a select group goes to, and me and a few other guys are always left out.”
“I’ll just see you upstairs,” Stane said and went back to the elevators.
He had started with the blow jobs. Maybe that had been his tactical error. After two, Steve said that he was done with oral for the day. It hadn’t demotivated Tony then, but right now, he was questioning his decisions.
“Something funny to you?” Rumlow snapped at him.
“Uncle Obie.” Tony flashed his press smile and shuffled a little aside so that he could easily grab his treasure off the floor if Obie tried something. “Come on, old man, would I try hiding anything from you?” He spread his arms in a wondering manner.
And before Steve could reply, Tony pulled the door shut behind him.
The next evening, Tony went to the gym and was rather disappointed but not surprised to see that his endurance was crap, his strength nonexistent, and that the muscle memory he had painstakingly developed did not transfer as brilliantly to his young body as he would’ve hoped.
He took the coffee pot and headed towards his computer — was he planning to work through the night?
‘He’s going with a hug,’ Tony thought hysterically. ‘He wants to hug me.’ Numbly, standing to flee, Tony nodded. No, he thought as the large body of Obadiah Stane enveloped his rigid form in a bear hug.
Instinctively, Steve opened his mouth again, raising his eyes to Tony’s, who stopped talking, squinting.
that he was now trying to get from Anthony what he had never managed to have with Tony, because Steve always had been too angry, too short-sighted, too much of a coward? And now, for a brief time, he got the lifeless copy of what could have been, whereas Anthony was only a party to it because he didn’t hate him yet.
Tony worked at home, went to work, and spent a lot of his time in the R&D department. He had his own locked space there, but he still made sure to visit the other engineers, and by the end of the second week, SI New York lab techs and office rats had gotten used to Tony turning up every day. Over time, he made rounds in the whole building, talked to his employees at every level, including the cleaners, and encouraged his engineers to book a slot with his secretary if they ever needed his help. Tony was cautiously optimistic about at least some of the higher-ups soon starting to bypass Stane with CEO related issues.
Tony made a sound as if he had swallowed his tongue and then started coughing. Steve sprinted to his side and carefully rapped on his back until he could breathe freely again.
Of course, it had to be Stevens. Tony noted with a grimace that his subconscious had finally allowed him to use the man’s name.
“Oh god.” Everything was a rush, and without thinking, Steve picked Tony up and pulled the dress over his head. He could feel something ripping, but the sound didn’t carry over the noise in his ears. He threw the doll back on the pillow, and it landed ass up. Steve managed to wrap the dress haphazardly around his cock and give it three more strokes before coming. He painted white lines over Tony’s ass, back, and head which stood out as beautifully as the garter did. Panting and slowly sinking back down on his hackles, Steve was unable to take his eyes off the image, but eventually, he carefully unwrapped his dick from the dress. He probably would need to get a new one. Maybe some other outfits, too.
Yes. This was the reason Tony hadn’t wanted to see the man’s face. He was nobody. Or rather — just a body.
“Obie?” Tony froze and with his heart in his mouth, tried to smile.
Tony knows that Steve knows exactly how many times it has been. It’s all about those numbers.
Tony had grown up surrounded by people just waiting for an opportunity to use him for their own gain. And Stevens was SHIELD, and therefore had clandestine motives for sure. If anything, Anthony’s reaction was healthy. Even the intensity of his reactions was absolutely warranted with everything going on in his life. He would grow up to be always in control of himself, having to be. Now, after his parents had just died and he was suddenly responsible for the whole Stark Industries empire, he should absolutely get to be emotional. Steve could take it.
The night passed uneventfully, and half an hour before his shift was supposed to end, Steve started to prepare breakfast from the ingredients in the fridge. Just eggs and bacon. He was plating the stuff when he heard the bedroom door open and Anthony strut into the room.
“You feel so good.” Steve’s words draw a sob out of Tony. No matter how often Steve says it, it manages to hit Tony at his core every time. “You’re so loose for me. How often have you done this today? How often have you filled yourself up with me?”
“We’re having an early dinner?”
“You could remind him once in a while,” Steve gruffed back. There was no point in hiding his derision for Lowell’s callousness.
He froze for what felt like forever.
“Shit!” Tony hadn’t heard the door swoosh open.
His breath hitched, but he made himself finish the thought. Steve would want him to eat. So Tony would eat. And if the success of the plan depended on Tony making nice for now, then that’s what Tony would do. And if he was too frustrated for work, he would need to go to the gym.
When enough anticipation had built up, he put his hand back at those legs and determinedly caressed them, slowly making his way upwards. The feeling and tension made him want to rut into the mattress. He wondered what it would be doing to Tony. This time he didn’t stop when he reached the skirt. He made sure his fingers were following the outer side of Doll-Tony’s thighs so there was no chance of touching his cock yet. He could swear there was an almost tremble of excitement.
“Always after your shift,” Madden said, shaking his head.
Steve hums. He bites into the cord at the side of Tony’s neck and pushes at his rim hard at the same time. Tony yowls. For a moment he thinks, Steve’s about to finger him while his cock is still inside Tony. But then he lets up.
of trying to touch yourself, I will know, and I’ll tie you up, use you and leave you hanging, you got it?”
“And if I won’t manage?” Tony asked calmly when no more information was forthcoming.
me) and then disappointment, as he realized that it had never been something Tony had especially called Steve; it was probably a reference to something that he used to refer to people he perceived as objectively attractive. He wasn’t Captain Handsome
No, he wouldn’t. Because Stevens was not important. Not to Tony. He wasn’t supposed to be, but the pain of this knowledge was relentless. Being here was a coincidence as much as an opportunity though, because Steve’s marks were Rumlow and Pierce. Not Tony. He could have no stake in anything concerning Tony Stark.
Surprise, affront, and indecision warred on her face only for a second and soon he was fucking her against the wall.
Steve’s eyes flitted to his own cock for the shortest part of a second, the sight tilting him almost over the edge, but there was an instant ‘tsk, tsk’ from Tony. “Simple instructions too much for you?”
"Bed," he said shortly. He could allow for a little consideration now that they both knew what this was about.
Somebody was asking if he was coming, if he was alright —
Stane came back. Alone.
When Stane disappeared behind a door that must’ve led to the bedroom, Rumlow sneered. “Precious little corporate prince! He is lucky that Pierce wants his daddy’s tech so much. Otherwise, no one would give a damn if his body washed up on the shore somewhere.”
Andrew’s breath kept hitching, and very soon, he started moving in tandem with Tony's prodding. Grinning triumphantly to himself, Tony pulled out.
Any hint of a smile had vanished from the man's face and the vise that had started to coil around Tony's temples disappeared. Instead, the apparent excited obedience that Andrew's entire form encapsulated sent a frisson of pleasure up Tony’s spine.
It’s also kind of my last chance for doing this. Handshakes are nice and all—hmmmpf”
“You wanna go again before the shift change?” he asked, absolutely not pretending any emotional ardor.
Good god, that blush went down his whole body now. Delicious. Tony swallowed as he briefly thought about another body that used to blush as easily at any insinuation of anything intimate.
Over the last week, Obie had left several messages on his answering machine but since Tony had nothing new to say, he’d stopped answering them. Every time Tony heard that Obie was in the SI building he tried making himself scarce and this was what would happen now.
Well, it would be better for his dick if the hole was somewhat lubricated, he reasoned with himself. He added lube, pushed the finger back in and then up to another knuckle. Then he moved it back and forth, side to side, and in and out to loosen it a bit more. Andrew’s breath was unsteady and maybe it sounded more like pain than pleasure, but he didn’t tell Tony to stop, so he didn’t.
Steve was obviously doing a very good job at playing the big dumb brute, as the film currently in the machine contained the 1989 volume of the International Journal of Electronics and Communication Engineering. But it didn’t really matter.
Tony prowled close, so that Steve had to look up to keep eye contact. Tony’s hand ran through his hair, grabbing it part way through, smoothly going from caress to punishment.
“Don’t say it. Just let me have this. Let me just pretend—”
---> Bae, ASchmidts, and VTHX (who added the angst bit to the glove thing - this is a fantastic addition - TY!!).
to help
Was always just an illusion. It never worked, not unless he disappeared into the bottle indefinitely. But that would also mean that the work that needed to be done would be left unfinished. People would die.
“I love how you need all your restraint to keep from writhing.” He mostly kept changing the pressure on Tony’s cock with his left while stroking himself with his right. “You don’t even know if it will bring you release in the end and you still do it. Because that’s its own reward, right? Seeing how you give me pleasure instead of chasing your own?” This was going too fast but Steve didn’t see how he could slow down anymore. He got Tony exactly where he wanted him, how he wanted him. He sped up his right.
He straightened his back, and turning, said conversationally, “Well, you know how dad was.” He shrugged. “I don’t think his habits helped his creativity any. Nor his business acumen.” He bit his cheek and tried appearing grateful. “That’s what he had you for, though.”
As long as it had to. Indefinitely. “Trying something new,” he replied shortly. “Now. Did you actually need to discuss something or can I get back to work?” Being blunt had always either worked with Stane best or backfired spectacularly. At least being subtle rarely helped, so Tony didn’t see the point in trying.
Finally, Rumlow decided it was time, and they went back up to try and meet with their client.
While they have sex, Tony decides to start using Stevens's first name, but only manages to do so in his head. Tony dominates
Well, not this time.
For a moment there was only silence, while Tony continued to stare at him while his brain was clearly somewhere else. Then he huffed a half laugh. “Look around this room. Think about what you see. Then think about the other places I actually do spend my days in.”
"You’ve already had more than several times that, Tony." Stane took a deep drag off his cigar and leisurely blew a puff of smoke to the side. "And even if I wanted to, I can't wait. As I said, the board is waiting for the update next Thursday, and if they don't get it, they might start questioning your position as the CEO of this company. That's all I'm saying."
“So, Tony, how's your evening going?” A smile made Pierce’s eyes sparkle.
It was an admirable trait, to be able to let go like this. To trust like this. At this thought, Tony’s fingers slackened in awe. Why would Andrew trust Tony like that? It was unbelievable and amazing; it made Tony feel warm and mellow, wanting to drop everything and just cuddle in front of the TV.
Stane didn’t actually have any trouble keeping up with Anthony, but he also couldn’t pretend that it was anything other than a chase at Anthony’s whim. Especially when they reached the elevator, and Tony walked right past it towards the stairs.
