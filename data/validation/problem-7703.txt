@cptsteverogers: You know that Tony and I are keeping it out of the public.
Without another word, Steve entered the stranger’s house. Looking around he noticed there was very little furniture, though the house was much larger than his own. The questions died on his tongue—it was not his place to ask.
It was a game Clint had come up with: blindfold someone and direct them through a race of Mario Kart. Tony had his suspicions that Clint had only invented the game as an excuse to use Tony’s Nintendo Switch, but they all had fun so it’s good.
“Hmm.” Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair. He’d been growing it out since Tony said he was a fan of Steve’s “floopy” hair from a high school photo. Looking into Steve’s eyes was one of Tony’s favorite past times. He was determined to someday count each and every one of Steve’s sinfully long lashes.
“Steve,” he croaked out, and then everything was black.
“Humor me.”
I DID IT BEFORE THE END OF THE MONTH!
“Oh, well ex
“Do you want me to use my fingers?” Steve asked. Tony pried his eyes open to watch as Steve sucked three fingers in his mouth and started making obscene sounds and gestures with them. “Or do you want me to use a toy?”
Fluff
“Have you spoken to your friend, yet?”
He was instantly in love.
“Go back to bed. I’ll be there in two minutes. As it stands, I can still hold him for one hundred and five seconds and still have time to make it back.”
“Steve, stop.” Tony hung his head in embarrassment. “We have the team over.”
. Steve was in no place to be in charge of a group of superheroes, especially when things were so likely to go wrong.

Steve looked down. So he was. “No big deal,” he lied.
“No, we’re playing Blindfolded Mario Kart which you did not invent.” The music for Cheep Cheep Beach began to play, the marimbas jingling. Three steady beeps and they were off.
The hospital didn’t do much except refer Steve to the best therapist in the city (which he refused to go to) and give him coping techniques (which he refused to do). In short, nothing changed.
@jamesrhodes: Calm down. We don’t talk about bedroom stuff. Much.

Today I celebrate 2 years sober. This is not the first time I’ve pursued sobriety, but it is the longest I have gone without a drink. There have times when I was willing to give my fortune for a drink, but I have had an amazing support system to help me through it.

“My boyfriend is part cat, you see,” Steve said seriously. “So, I think ‘what would he like-slash-do in this situation’ and then I act accordingly.”
Steve’s hands had found their way into his pockets, his thumbs curled through his belt loops. “You know that if I didn’t want to kiss you, I could have easily pushed you away.”
“I’m gonna go shower,” Steve said, leaving the room with just a peck on Tony’s lips. When the door closed behind Steve, Tony put his bag on the chair.
Couldn’t have said it better myself. Thanks for your never ending support, Steve! #fightthewagegap #empoweredwomenempowerwomen
“Please, if we didn’t want to get caught, we’d just do it in our room.” Tony shrugged, snuggling closer to Steve’s shoulder. “Let’s just finish the movie, okay?”
I have realized that not everyone has the resources that I do. Whether the roadblock is money, toxic interpersonal relationships, or something else, there is a clear lack of support for those not necessarily “well-off”
Steve grabbed the pill jar. “For you.”
Eh, I'll probably keep writing because I love this story, but it's hard knowing I'm working my ass off and not knowing if anyone gives half a shit.
“He’d take me home and wouldn’t let me get ice cream,” Sarah grumbled.
And then there was Steve and Tony. Clint was assuming it was a lazy handjob but, when he darted his eyes to the side, his peripherals caught that Tony was now in Steve’s lap and… wiggling. For lack of a better word. Okay, so they were out and out just having sex on the communal couch, during movie night, with a bunch of other people in the room. Sure. That was a thing that people did.

It took Steve a moment to realize the last statement was directed at him. Without thinking, he slammed his feet into the sidewalk to stop himself and turn around. He tried to hide the wince but if the man’s face was any indication, he didn’t hide it very well.
Bucky was his only real friend, but he never hung out with Bucky at school. In fact, he never even acknowledged Bucky existed outside of the privacy of their homes and the occasional trip into Manhattan. When they went to Manhattan, he could leave his Steve Rogers Dumpster Fire life behind and live his Steve Rogers Potential Artist life. Bucky didn’t mind being a secret. At least Steve was pretty sure.
“I’m sorry.” Steve inched his way into their bedroom, sitting hesitantly on the corner of the bed.
Tony shook his head and stood up. For a moment, Steve though Tony was walking closer to the bedside; instead, Tony walked right of the hospital room, disappearing from sight.

“After?”
Doug took a screenshot of one of Steve’s nudes and leaked it online. Steve’s not sure if his mom saw it. Once it’s out there, though, he feels a kind of freedom. It was posted anonymously to PornHub. Bucky was the one that sent him the link. Was Bucky gay, too? He’d never asked and Bucky had never offered the information. He was a really shitty friend.
Tony nodded, his eyes not meeting Steve’s. He reached out his hand and clutched Steve’s, squeezing it tightly. Steve felt the band of his wedding ring grind into his skin as Tony clasped on even harder. Tony was crying--Steve couldn’t comprehend the situation enough to cry.
Direct message from @cptsteverogers to @jamesrhodes
“Weren’t you trying to kill him yesterday?” Tony asked.
“I picked you. You’re my favorite,” Tony reminded.
His friends were vapid but they liked him. They told him he was attractive and that he had the nicest smile. Steve didn’t really think he looked that different than anyone else. He looked like a teenage boy, albeit a little taller and more muscular than the average.
“Blood comes off tile. No biggie.”
“It’s not a bad weird,” Tony decided. “That was… nice. You don’t have to return the favor if you don’t wa–how the fuck are you hard again?”
There was a large gap between Steve’s brain and his mouth. Steve was thinking only with his cock and at that moment he wanted it in Tony’s mouth.
Steve recovered from his confusion and grabbed a toy just off to his left. Tony hadn’t realized the giant pump bottle filled with what he assumed was lubricant was there until Steve started to spread it along the toy.
I totally forgot it was in my WIP files. I only had to add, like, three sentences. Now I hate myself.

@tonystark: i’m cold! i miss my space heater. I need good morning kisses or something.
What would happen if they didn't fight each other at the end of Civil War?
Tony slowly pushed in, his eyes never leaving Steve’s face. Steve wasn’t exactly sure how he felt about this whole thing. He knew he wanted it, but Tony was being so caring. He wasn’t sure if this was going to be a one time thing or not, but if it was, he would be severely disappointed. He could only imagine Tony taking care of him like this in all aspects of their life.
“I could still kick your ass, you know. Chair and all.”
Tony tried not to beam at the praise. Sure, he was complimented and told he was brilliant constantly. But this—Bruce,
Steve smirked. “You can call it a date. I’m not two hundred years old.”

“Sorry.”
“Last night I… kissed a guy for the first time. Before that, I didn’t know that I
“It’s not so bad,” Tony assured. “It’s just not… great.”
. If he looked in the window, he’d probably be able to see the ever-present sand from spontaneous day trips to the beach.
Their relationship, once again, was thriving. They weren’t arguing. They were on the same(ish) sleep schedule. They had sex just for the sake of having sex—no more using it as a way to make up after a big fight. Tony was over the moon.
Steve swallowed, his throat suddenly dry. “How many casualties?”
“What happened?”
Steve was close, he felt the slow pull of his orgasm approaching. He led Tony’s hand to his cock. Tony may have been awkward about the experience up until this point, but it seemed as if he was adept at handjobs, and it wasn’t long until Steve was coming in thin strips up and down Tony’s chest.
Steve groaned and turned his chair away from the glass doors. Steve could come into his space, but Tony was going to make it very clear who’s space this really ways and always would be: Tony’s.
Once at the ice cream parlor, both Sarah and Steve ordered strawberry. Sarah because it was her favorite; Steve because Sarah would most likely drop her cone. They sat at a table and, almost immediately, Sarah’s ice cream had toppled off her cone and splatted on the floor.
At the last offer, Steve chuckled. “Okay.” He removed his hand from Tony’s and used it to cup his face. “I love you. I trust you,” Steve said, repeating their wedding vows.
thing. He’d watched porn countless times.
I'm two days late posting this. Sorry.
Tony was freaking out. He’d kissed a guy last night. A cute guy. And he liked it. He liked it a lot. But he also knew he liked kissing girls. Could it have been a fluke? He’d never thought about guys like that. It was undeniable, though, that he enjoyed the kiss. That much was evident when he went home and touched himself, replaying the kiss until he came.
@cptsteverogers
Tony’s nostrils flared. Inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8.
“Absolutely.”
“Remember how I said I’d like to be able to kiss you?”
The link popped up in the chat. Even if he’d been conversing with a bot, the link would bring him to a real person. He closed his eyes and clicked it, made his account, and suddenly there was a guy on the screen. He was muscled and fair skinned. His cock was enviable. He was smiling this shy kind of smile.

Steve is taking care of his sick grandma.
“Yes! Yes, of course, I’ll marry you!”

“You don’t want to fool around a little?” Steve asked.
The first person to speak after the coffin was placed on the flower donned stand, was President Ellis, who rambled on and on about what a gift it was to have the Good Captain back and the good the Good Captain had done both in his time and our own. It dawned on Tony suddenly that the majority of the people were there to mourn Captain America, not Steve Rogers. It suddenly felt like his gut was made of lead. Did any of these people even know what Steve looked like when he wasn’t in uniform—when he was wearing a t-shirt and jeans?
“I’m sorry. I’ll just di—”
“Fine. May I take you on a date.”
Tony shook his head no, but he could easily figure it out. He’d jumped Steve and ruined everything.
“I think I know the answer but--”
“How can you say shit like that to me?” he demanded. “You’re sorry for what it could have done to our relationship? Steve. You

“Thing is, you don’t have to.”
Tony laughed. This was so ridiculous. Bot or no, this qtguy-18 seemed to be copy/pasting the same responses he/it gave to everyone. But hey, if this was a camboy or something of the like, make he’d get a link. Maybe he’d have a private session or something.

Rhodey snorted. “Oh, really? I don’t think it’s come up.” After another, shorter silence, he cleared his throat. “Do you wanna talk about it? I know it can’t be easy…”
I didn’t always agree with what he was doing with himself in the past, but Tony is my longtime friend and I am very proud of the person he has become. He stresses me out, but I wouldn’t want a life without him. <3 Congratulations.

“So why'd you quit the squad?” Natasha asked, inhaling deeply before passing the joint to Toni. Toni took a drag and passed it over to Steve.
Congrats dad!
found a way to deprogram him.” Tony pulled his arm away from Steve. Even if he couldn’t feel the hand through the armor, it irked him that it was still there.
“You treat me like a child!” Steve shouted one night over dinner. Tony had simply suggested that he add a few more green beans to counteract the two steaks on his plate.
3/31/2018 11:09am
Tony knew that was the whole point of camming—to make the customer want you until they couldn’t take it anymore—but this felt different, somehow. Tony had never really been attracted to men before. He appreciated when they were good looking, but he’d never thought about doing with them the things he was wanting to do with Steve.
But Tony Stark was not meant to have nice things.
“What did I tell him about sleeping with Peter in his arms?” Steve asked Dum-E, though he knew Dum-E wouldn’t be able to respond. Instead, he shook the claw which Steve took to mean
This one is bad. I know.
of Steve’s door opening. He was wearing nothing but a towel around his waist. Tony’s stomach filled with butterflies; even after six months, just looking at Steve sent a thrill through him. He quickly threw his books into his backpack and walked as quickly as he could towards Steve.

He couldn’t be the only one that noticed. He
“Steve.”
“My little sister gets bored. She’ll have fun trying to fix your friend.”
Suddenly very interested in his shoes, Tony elected not to say anything else to his former teammate. Former? Well, with Clint on the Raft, Steve dead, and Bruce and Thor off doing lord knew what, there wasn’t really a team to speak of. He, Rhodey, and Vision occupied the compound alone.

Tony’s eyes locked back on Peter. “Pretty soon he’s going to be too big to pick up and then he’ll be in high school and then he’ll graduate college. We’ll be old and gray and he’ll bring home some lovely lady or lad. They’ll get married and have babies of their own.”
“You mean when
@jamesrhodes: Yeah, yeah. Tweet deleted.
He didn’t do any of that. That was anger. Blind rage. Anxiety. Under all of that was a sinking, aching feeling of despair. He’d always suspected that Steve would choose Bucky if he ever had to make the decision--turn’s out, he already had.
“I’m not jealous,” Tony assured. “When we met, on your cam show I might add, and I asked you out, you said that you would still have to cam. I said I was okay with it. I was then and I still am now.”
“I’ll still have to… I’ll still have to cam.”
“What?”
@tonystark
“It’s been an hour,” Steve said, though his grin betrayed his façade. His hand was suddenly on the small of Tony’s back; he let out a small squeak as Steve pulled him into the room and kissed him again, this time with more intent than a greeting. “I missed you, too.”
@avengersofficial
“But he’s so tiny and soft.” Tony brushed a stray hair off of Peter’s forehead. The baby crinkled his nose in his sleep and Steve braced himself for the ear-piercing wail, but it never came. Peter made a little smacking noise and resumed his slumber.
Toni and Steve’s first date had been awkward. The day after Steve’s grand gesture in the gym, they'd walked into town after school. Toni had only been on one other date, in middle school. His name was Henry and he tried to kiss her as soon as they sat down for the movie, not even waiting or the lights to dim.
me, Rogers. Did you know?” His eyes searched Steve’s, begging, pleading.
Tony hissed. Steve’s hand was on his arm. The hands that had touched him, taken him apart, put him back together. The hand that bore a wedding ring, engraved with the date of their wedding.
“I love you with all of my heart and I want you to get better.” He put his hand on Steve’s.
She was riding Steve’s cock when someone knocked on her bedroom door. No one was home. At least they weren’t supposed to be. Howard and Maria were scheduled to return Wednesday and it was only Saturday.
“Goddammit, Steve,” he hissed, swooping over the crowd on the bridge and continuing on as the leader of the world’s most depressing parade.
i woke up to pee and couldn’t fall back to sleep because my sheets were too cold. really annoying when you think about it.
Steve left and straightened the bed a bit. He was now required to give Tony the aforementioned massage. If he didn’t, he’d never hear the end of it and Tony would leave and go back to Peter’s room.

“You said we shouldn’t because I’d regret it tomorrow. Or, today, as the situation may be. I insisted that I wouldn’t. I told you that I had wanted to kiss you for a long time. I told you...” Steve swallowed. Was he nervous? Tony had never seen Steve nervous before. “I told you I loved you, Tony.”
“They’re called dampeners,” Tony told Steve over dinner. He pulled out the bottle and gave his sale’s pitch about them. The more Tony explained, the more Steve looked constipated. That look was never good. Shit.
“I get embarrassed when we get caught, too. Sometimes.”
“Don’t ask me that.”
So Steve did.
There is no body in the casket.

The ride back to his Nana’s was short and he knew he should be getting back before she woke up from her nap, but he was worried about gravel getting stuck in the open wounds which were starting to sting.
Established relationship
“Since when can’t you lie?” Tony snarked. Then, leveled by her glare, added, “There’s nothing I can do.”
Hahahahaha I am late just like Toni's period
“You two could not be any more trope-y,” Bucky complained. Steve was ditching calculus (he had Toni for that). His best friend and girlfriend had a different lunch period than him and he was in a social mood.
@virginiapottsceo
You weren’t even there!
@jamesrhodes: It’s been almost two years. You live together. It might be time.
“He’ll be tiny and soft tomorrow,” Steve urged.
“Do you think it’ll work for him?” Bruce asked, placing the bottle back on the desk.
“You can’t die. Please don’t die,” Tony whined. It was too late. Koopa passed him, leaving Steve to finish twelfth, not even getting to the finish line.
“Sounds a little mushy to come out of my mouth but I believe you.”
She gasped. “Daddy says no! I’m almost ‘free.” She held up three fingers.
The same strains that Tony’s anxiety had caused recurred when Steve started acting manic. They fought more often than not. Steve stared into nothingness. His sex drive was nonexistent. On Tony’s urging, Steve checked into a rehabilitation system. It took a lot of wheedling, begging, ultimatums, and sexual promises, but eventually, he’d agreed.

The doors slid open, admitting him into the workshop. “Tony,” he called, looking around. “Tony where are you?” When no answer came, he started to look around. It wouldn’t be the first time that Tony had passed out on a random surface in his lab. After scouring the whole room, he still was unable to find Tony.
On my morning run today I saw a mama pigeon help a one-legged baby pigeon out of the street. How can people call such wonderful creatures “rats with wings”?
“I swear it won’t happen again. Can we leave it at that? I fucked up and now we’re moving on.”
At this, Dum-E rolled quickly away, towards one of Tony’s many desks. This one didn’t have gadgets or tools on it. This one had a few framed pictures--one on their wedding day, a newspaper clipping after the battle of New York with the whole team, a photo of them holding Peter the day he was born--Tony’s personal computer (which had Solitaire installed on it, but he “didn’t use it”), and the baby monitor. Dum-E pointed at the little screen that showed a direct video feed of Tony in the rocking chair where they fed Peter.
“Huh?” Tony asked. “Oh, yeah. This is where my old used to take his mistresses, but he and mom are six feet under now and I have to sell it.”

“I asked you to marry me,” Steve repeated, this time more hesitant.
Tony leaned his head forward on his desk, cupping it in his hand. What did it matter, being by himself? The entirety of his life was spent by himself. Mansions, caves, towers, compounds; it was all the same: lonely.
Tony’s head shot up and he blinked a few times. “I’m so mad at you.”
@tonystark: are you ashamed of me?
“There’s always something you can do.”
But, God help him, Tony loved thinking his name.
“Yes.” Tony’s hand was getting faster as he stroked his own cock. He couldn’t cum yet. He refused to cum yet.
“I’m a pall-bearer,” Tony admitted. “And I’ve been asked to speak.”
“It’s my job and… it’s money and I need the money.”
“Alright.”
“I’m gonna bleed on your floor.”
“Antonio ordered in English,” Alessandro said with his thick accent. “We all know how much you like when he does it in Italian.”
His freshman year roommate smoked cigarettes in the room and had way more friends than he did. His name was Gilmore Hodge and he smelled like B.O. Steve was pretty sure that the only reason Hodge had friends was because they were afraid to say no to him. Or maybe it’s just assholes make friends more easily because they don’t pretend to be something they’re not.
Peter “Daddy Issues” Parker haha
Steve smiled. “Yes, you can do it now.”
“That’s fine with me,” Tony said. Steve noted that Tony’s eyes were still glued to Peter as if he’d disappear if Tony so much as blinked.

Graduation came and went. His friends dropped off the face of the earth. He had Bucky change the password to his Facebook account but didn’t delete it. He didn’t want the texts and emails going on an on, asking why he deleted. Or worse: he didn’t want it to be that no one noticed.

“You did what?!” Tony screeched.
It was the same year that his mom started dating Doug. Doug had been hanging around the house more and more lately, even before the divorce. His mom assured him that she never cheated on his father and that Doug was there for the moral support in a time of need. The romantic feelings, according to her, developed once she felt “free to love again.”
Toni was not happy about Halloween being on a Tuesday. What the fuck. Her annual Halloween party--which had started when she was six and JARVIS invited everyone in her kindergarten class (three people showed up)--had gotten more intense over the years. What was once orange frosted cupcakes and pumpkin painting was not a drunken gathering with loud bass.
“I don’t know!” Tony gave Steve a full body shove, but nothing. “I came up to surprise him during my lunch break and he was just…” Tony fell back his legs. He couldn’t do this. His body literally could not take the stress.

“May I ask you a question?” Steve asked and Tony’s stomach sank.

Things were better at school, at least. He was popular. Playing football in the fall and lacrosse in the spring kept him pretty busy. He would have preferred to play baseball, but lacrosse was full contact and he liked slamming into people out of rage.
5/17/2018 2:46pm
Tony didn’t hesitate, only this time, he swallowed Steve down. Steve was far too big to go all the way, but Tony tried. Sadly, he had a gag reflex and had to pull back. Steve moved his head to see that Tony was a little flushed. He elected not to mention it.
Their attention was shifted when they were instructed to pick up the coffin and carry it down the aisle. Tony had hoped that the sky would break; that there would be a downpour; that the stained glass saints would look to be crying.
Steve sighed and tried a different tactic. “If you come to bed with me right now, I’ll rub your shoulders and neck. If you’re really good, I’ll rub your back. You’ll fall asleep for a few hours and when you wake up, he’ll be right here.”
“Weren’t you?” T’Challa smiled his easy smile. “I will take him with me to Wakanda. We can heal him there. No more blood should be spilled this day.”
Steve toppled over when the backs of his knees hit the back of the bed. Tony stumbled, but caught himself before landing on Steve. Steve’s brain shorted out. Tony was standing above him, his eyes blown wide with lust, looking at him as if he was the only thing on the planet.
“Steve, you’re getting worse.” He was tired of dancing around the subject, of trying to get Steve to work through his problems on his own or with nothing more than subtle guidance. “You act insane half the time and the other half you sulk around. If I hadn’t forced you to get up and come to dinner with me tonight, it would have marked six days since you’d even left our room.
The two men sat in silence for a long time. Nothing either of them could say would change the events of the past few weeks.

Tony frowned. “I’ll still be here. It’ll be hard, but I’d do it. But I won’t resign myself to that until we’ve tried every possibility.” He slid the bottle towards Steve. “Try it. For me.”
“I just.” Tony groaned. “I had this whole speech about how I want to stand by your side and fight by your side for the rest of our lives yadda yadda yadda.” Tony fished the velvet box out of his coat pocket. “You beat me to the punch.”
“We need to talk.”
Tony gnawed on his lip. Of course he was going. No one knew exactly what happened to Steve—there hadn’t been a body—but, like seventy-years prior, he was presumed dead. The public didn’t know there wasn’t a body; that the flag would be draped over an empty coffin.
Save the fucking bees.
“Steve,” Bucky butt in. Tony was a millisecond away from blasting him through a wall. “It wasn’t my choice, I couldn’t say no, but I was still the one that did the things I did. You can explain it away all you want but--”
Then Tony would have to explain the whole thing.
The fat lump didn’t move. Unwilling to argue with (and lose to) a cat, Tony rolled onto his other side. His eyes still open, he came face to face with Champ.
“Hey,” he breathed into the phone. There was an audible sigh on the other end of the connection.
“H—hi,” Tony stuttered out. There was no denying that he was into this. His big gay—or bisexual, he supposed—freak out had been answered. He was attracted to the guy on screen and he wanted to touch him. Wanted to run his fingers along his body. Tony wanted the man onscreen to do the same to him. “What’s your name?”
“Is this the first time you’ve done something like this? You seem kind of uncomfortable.”
Tony awoke to the sounds of a gentle snore. The light was pouring through the window, lighting up Steve’s face. Was this real? No, he knew it wasn’t. He’d had this dream countless times.
Seriously, though. Please leave comments. I'm sick of everyone complaining that they don't get comments but those same people not leaving comments for other authors. Key smash, say "yes," critique, whatever. Just let me know that you're reading, please.

@cptsteverogers: I’ll be in in a few minutes. I’m making you coffee.
“You’re just now figuring this out? Now leave, you’re cutting in on my baby time.”
“It’s May, so how about a Christmas movie?”
“Why wouldn’t it be?”
Tony wanted to cry.
“I am.”
“Yeah,” Steve whispered. Tony had been so lost in thought he’d momentarily forgotten the conversation at hand.
5/17/2018 11:17am
“I’m going to take care of you, okay?” Tony assured. “You know how you mother-hen me whenever I get a boo-boo--”
4/4/2018 1:30pm
Steve awoke to the incessant beeping of a heart monitor. He’s not sure what they were pumping into his veins, but it was enough to sedate him and that was impressive.
“Well, it seems that you’re seventeen weeks along. Your symptoms have evolved the way that they should. Your due date is July 17th,” Dr. Cho read off a clipboard. “You seem to be in perfect health. Keep going the way you’re going and you will have a very healthy baby.”
If Steve weren’t so damn bullheaded he would have seen that yes, the Avengers were
“What if I can’t get better?” Steve asked. “What if I’m a messy roller coaster of a person for the rest of my life?”
He hit the gas and sped out of the cemetery, not once looking in the review mirror at what—and who—he was leaving behind.
Experimentally, Steve wriggled his toes. His right foot cooperated nicely. His left, however...
Of course, everyone wanted Steve to get better. At the current time, though, there was concern about his ability to lead the Avengers. Tony knew it was the right call, he knew that it was
Steve just bit his tongue and wiggled his eyebrows at Tony.

“Hold on,” Tony interrupted, breaking the kiss. “Doesn’t this require, uh, supplies? Lubricants?”

MJ! I read “Little Fires Everywhere” from last month’s list. It was soooooooo good. Thanks for the rec! Can’t wait to check out what you’ve got in store this month.
He tried to push Tony off, but Tony stayed firm. Steve wasn’t sure if he hadn’t heard or if he was ignoring it, but he couldn’t wait any longer. He let himself come in Tony’s mouth.
“Do you think I should?”
“No one died.”

“You’re really young,” Tony noted.
They’d done it more times than either cared to remember.

First kiss
His fingers brushed across Steve’s cheek. Rough. Tony abruptly registered that Steve had grown a beard. That was new. He liked it. It looked good on Steve. It fit him. He was pretty sure he preferred clean-shaven Steve, but he’d take any Steve he could get right now.
“So… do you want me to keep going or do you want to move on.”
Overtired and now bordering on grumpy, Steve took the elevator back up to the penthouse. Once outside of Peter’s room, Steve could distinctly hear Tony’s soft snores and the coos Peter made when he slept.
“What if he doesn’t like me?” Tony whispered, using his toes to sway the rocking chair back and forth. “What if he grows up and I’m a bad dad and he resents me like I resent mine.”

“Eleventh. You could potentially get out of this—CRAB—with some dignity. Okay, quick left. Shit, you went through the mud.”
Tony knew Steve well enough to know he’d blushed red. Unfortunately, the low lighting of the restaurant made it impossible for Tony to see.
he didn’t know.
It's been a hot second.
“Yeah.”
“Well… yeah,” Tony admitted. “So, to clear everything up, I can do it now.”
“Alright,” Tony muttered, grabbing the controller back. “I’m thinking DK Jungle.”
“Of course.”
@cptsteverogers
“Oh.”
@tonystark: i fucking love you
“Steve!” he screamed. He slapped Steve, unconscious of the bathroom floor, across the face. It did nothing, Steve didn’t budge. “Steve!” Tony repeated, slapping him again. “JARVIS, get Bruce up here.”

“After all this time, you really think that I’m going to stand you up? Or be mad when you order my food. I actually think it’s kind of hot.”

“Huh.”

College AU, established relationship, mentions of sex work (legal/camming), no smut, light angst
“Yeah,” Steve announced, removing his fingers. Tony grabbed a condom and rolled it on. Steve could feel the pressure of the head of his cock right outside of him. He wasn’t sure what Tony was waiting for. “You can go. Whenever you’re ready.”
4/4/2018 1:36pm
“I wanna hold him.”
“Tony?” Steve asked.
@cptsteverogers: Brush your teeth. I’ll be in with the coffee in a minute. Be prepared to drink it cold, though. I’m feeling distracting.
Tony materialized right on time, much to Steve’s surprise. Tony went to the bathroom quickly then hurriedly got in bed.
Oh Peter.
As if he’d been waiting to answer the unspoken question, Tony cleared his throat. “It’s something I’ve been working on for awhile. I don’t have a name for it, but it’s a shot that slows down your metabolism. Then they pump you with the morphine and it keeps you out.”
“Can we just get back to the movie?” Tony grumbled. Was that…
“It’s against policy,” Steve said. Tony’s stomach dropped. A nice letdown. Short, sweet. Tony understood that. It was the rules of whatever contract Steve had signed.

“Cat,” Tony informed, lazily throwing his hand over his shoulder. “She won’t get off your pillow.” Steve looked at Riley and moments later, the cat was jumping off the bed. “How come she listens to you!”
“Promise on... swear on your shield?”
“Why would you do that?” Steve asked. For the first time since Bucky had spoken, Steve looked at Tony.
On the floor.
He looked at the reason he’d stopped. A man about his age, maybe a little older, stood on the sidewalk. He was talking into a Bluetooth headset while also typing rapidly on his phone. Behind him, movers were carrying out a large, lush sofa. The man had yet to acknowledge Steve.
@cptsteverogers: Oh my god. :O
“May I?” he asked. “I’ve always wondered what it was like. You know, being on the other side of it.”

Steve’s jaw practically dropped when, the next day, Toni showed up at school. Her hair was up in space buns, her midriff exposed between low riding skin-tight jeans and a white crop-top with two alien heads over her boobs, and boots that went up almost to her knee.
5/17/2018 7:28pm
She began to cry. Steve handed her his cone and went to get napkins to clean up. As he was doing so, he noticed a small group of early-twenties boys pointing at them. It wasn’t uncommon; people pointed and stared at him, Tony, and the kids all the time. It was part of being famous.
“Boston University.” Tony pointed at the screen, indicating the banner that hung on Steve’s wall behind him. “You’re at BU.”

Steve nodded dumbly. Tony made a face before taking the head of Steve’s cock in his mouth. Steve let his head flop down on the soft comforter.
“Yes.”
Tony sighed. This wasn’t a real person. He figured he’d play along, anyway. He didn’t have anything better to do. At least if he was flirting with a computer, he wouldn’t have to think about the fact that he was having a sexual identity crisis.
“Tony,” he whispered, gently nudging Tony’s shoulder. He needed to get Tony into bed, preferably without waking the baby. Tony stirred slightly, his head falling to Steve’s hand. “You can’t keep doing this.”
see. There are so many things to fall off of.”
Tony didn’t bother to answer.
reply to @cptsteverogers
Steve was wringing his hands. In the past, dream Steve never looked nervous. Occasionally he’d get out of bed and they’d talk, but it was never like this.
Injury
Steve sighed. Peter was going on eight months old, but Tony still treated him as if he were a newborn. The baby had even been pushing himself up by the edges of tables; they were sure he was going to be walking any day now.
“Jet-lagged,” he grumbled, burrowing into his pillow. “Just fell asleep.”
Steve nodded because was it okay? "Please, move.“

“No, Steve. We’re brothers and always have been. But you lied to this man.” Bucky pointed a finger at Tony. “When we were coming here, you told me all about him. About the family you were going to try to start.” Steve averted his gaze. Bucky continued. “To protect a person who isn’t worth protecting.”

Steve’s eyebrows drew together, a crease forming on his forehead. “Why?”

Tony cracked an eye open and looked up at Steve. “Doing what?”
“Can I have the homework for Antoinette?” Steve asked Toni’s beyond public-school-qualified-even-for-AP science teacher. “She’s sick today.” Dr. Selvig looked thoroughly unimpressed but handed the assignments over, regardless. Steve thanked him and continued on to Toni’s next class. The rambling voicemail from the Apple store was followed up a few hours later with series of Snapchats showcasing Toni in various states of undress.
“I’ll tell you mine if you tell me yours.” He stopped stroking himself and looked straight into the camera, as if not sure if he should or not. Maybe this was against protocol. Tony had never watched a camgirl before. Hadn’t even seen the interest. What’s wrong with old-fashioned, free porn? But he wanted to know him. This man… he
I was so uninspired. I had no clue how to end this. I'm sorry.
Rhodey swiveled his torso, taking in the room. “Who is there to tell? The way I see it, it’s nobody’s business but yours. I just happen to know you better than anyone else and was able to figure it out.”
“No. No!”
reply to @WHIHOfficial
The coffin, he knew, was empty.
Steve cracked the door to see the very image of what had been on the baby monitor. Tony held Peter, swaddled tightly in a blanket, while they both slept. Tony’s head was hung low and Steve knew Tony was going to have a crick in his next when he woke up that he would expect Steve to massage.
Tony looked up again when he realized that Rhodey had been speaking. “Whu?”
Steve laughed from the bathroom, the sound muffled around his toothbrush. Tony smiled and queued up
“Tony, are you embarrassed?”
“Everyone thinks you’re a morning person,” Tony chuckled. “You are very much not.”

“Yes.” The tone of Steve’s voice led Tony to believe he was honest. It also led Tony to believe that Steve wasn’t used to being asked this sort of questions. “Is Tony yours?”
“That,” Tony managed. “That,” he gasped again. Yes, that was what he wanted. He wanted to watch Steve finger himself. He wanted Steve to tell him how much he wanted it. He
Don’t be mean.
“This brought you out of hiding?” Tony joked, sliding in beside Natasha.
“No, it’s his doppelganger who ended up in our shared bathroom. What a coincidence.”
” Steve demanded.
5/17/2018 2:34pm
“Sweetheart.” Steve was running his fingers through Tony’s hair. “It’s okay that you’re embarrassed. Remember the time at Benihana when you decided to blow me in the bathroom and we got kicked out and you tried to buy the restaurant and I was fucking humiliated because I couldn’t will my boner away and I was in a white suit and it was super obvious?”
Ten or so minutes passed and Steve came back into the room. Tony had taken his place on the inside of the bed against the wall, already changed into pajamas. “Hey handsome,” he murmured into the pillow when Steve dropped his towel to step into boxers. A naked, wet Steve was an excellent view.
4/6/2018 6:18pm
“You probably could.”
“I can’t say I didn’t play jealous ex for awhile.”

“Yeah,” Tony grumbled.

Tony shoved his hands into his pockets, then took them out again. He cracked is index finger using this thumb.
“What have you got to show for all this?” Rhodey finally broke the silence. “I mean, I’m Lieutenant Dan over here—”
“No. You’ll be fine once I clean it up and bandage it.”
The drive to Connecticut was tense. They’d tried to fool around in the shower but Toni’s heart wasn’t in it. Her heart wasn’t in anything but her throat. They pulled up to the Rhodes’ new home, Google Maps announcing to them that they had arrived.
“Hey, babe.” Steve placed a quick kiss on Tony’s lips before dropping into the chair opposite him. “Sorry I’m late.”
“Alessandro,” Steve greeted.
Steve cracked an eye open. “From Wakanda,” he said, his voice sounding more awake than it had a few moments before.
Tony continued to go to his therapist. He talked about Steve, what he was trying to do and how incompetent he felt. The therapist assured him that Steve knew he was doing his best. She also suggested that Steve would get better with time, but time was telling a different story.
The Avengers Initiative as a whole is very proud to support The Substance Dependence and Addiction Treatment Center at Stark Mansion.

, I’m going to dump your ass so hard. Your tailbone will be broken when I throw you on the street.” Unsurprisingly, the threats did not work on an unconscious man.
Tony chewed on his lip, cracked his knuckles, and typed back.
“Steve,” the guy said with a careless shrug. Steve could be lying about his name, but for some reason, Tony believed him. Maybe that was the point. Maybe Steve told everyone his name… or at least his name of Steve. Maybe it was all a ploy. Steve was doing this to make money. This was Steve’s job.
Tony sputtered. “I thought, I mean, we always get the same thing we did on our first date and so I figured... oh, you’re fucking with me.”
The words seemed to trigger something. One moment Steve’s shoulders were up by his ears and then they fell, relaxed. “You want me, dream Steve, to come back to bed with you?”
“Twelfth?” Steve asked. Tony looked at the number and was surprised to see that Steve was not in last place.
“Are you... does it bother you? My work.”
“Babe?” Steve sunk to the floor beside Tony, all too aware that the hospital gown was open in the back. The linoleum was ice cold against his bare ass.
@clintranaway
“How long did you know they were having sex back there?” Sam asked, his phone now forgotten in his lap.
“You’re a straight up asshole.” Tony seemed to deflate after those words, falling into Steve. “I fucking hate you so much. You’re the best thing that ever happened to me, and you tried to leave. Not only leave me but the entire goddamned world.”
“So, BU?” Tony said after a long silence.
“There is no normal!” Bucky shouted, throwing his arms out. Tony was amazed. In the past minutes, he’d seen Bucky emote more than he knew he was capable of. “I’m not that person anymore.

“You’re my favorite,” he explained.
You do realize I follow you here, right?
“It does not,” he said, trying to convey just how serious he was about those words.
“Truth. Or. Dare! Truth. Or. Dare!” Clint chanted, the beer dribbling out the end of his fourth or fifth bottle as he held it sideways. The weed was currently in short supply since Bruce, the wonderful supplier and cultivator, was now at college. So, they drank.
(I suck, bad joke)
“You got a name?” the man asked as he closed the cabinet door, alcohol wipes and gauze in hand.
@cptsteverogers: Then message me, don’t tweet it publically.
“Babe?” Steve asked a few minutes later, dragging Tony away from the brink of sleep.
Sam placed his hand on Steve’s are. “Steve…” he started, but Steve shrugged him off.
“After.”
Joseph and Lindsi are expecting a baby. Steve finds out on Facebook. Turns out they moved to Montana. He’s going to be a big brother to a baby he’ll probably never meet. It’s okay with him.
“You assumed what I’d want?”
@cptsteverogers
Tony, apparently, finally decided to let go, because suddenly he started to thrust up into Steve, meeting him in the middle. He came with a moan, his eyes rolling back into his head.
It appeared that the rest of the team was oblivious. Natasha was playing with Bucky’s hair, her eyes never leaving the screen. Bruce was asleep, his head in Thor’s lap (filing that away for later questioning); Thor was snoring loudly above him. Sam was absorbed on his phone, having recently become addicted to some app called Paper.io.
“Hey, babe,” Tony murmured against Steve’s lips. “I missed you.”
“Well, if real Steve were here I’d be pretty pissed he didn’t come back sooner. I’d probably slap him a few times. He deserves it.” The corners of Steve’s mouth twitched up. “And then I’d tell him we need to talk.” Tony cleared his throat. He hadn’t admitted this part to himself yet. “But we’d talk after. After we held each other and we kissed. After we shared ‘I love you’s.”
“Do you really think this is the time for jokes, Stark? It’s Steve’s funeral.”
@tonystark: during sex? yes always. when making a public statement? not the best idea.
“I am one-hundred and ten percent positive.”
Almost as if his computer was reading his mind, he got a message on tumblr from qtguy-18.
“Good Christ,” Tony moaned, closing his eyes.
“Buck--”
No one has time to read your blog. Come on dude. Get a life.
“Okay, just making sure.”
A pain shot through his body when he leaned back in his chair—his ribs apparently hadn’t healed yet. This was stupid. “We should get going. You using your legs or wheeling around like some quitter?” Tony slapped Rhodey’s shoulder and held on tightly.
Tony’s mouth fell open. “Excuse me?”
“That’s a mathematical impossibility, Steven. You’d think being married to me would have taught you
“Huh?”
“You guys are really bad at
“I think I can figure it out.”
“When we found a way to deprogram him.”
Bruce hummed and picked up the container holding the rest of the tabs. “There’s… this is brilliant,” he muttered, reading over the ingredients. “I developed something similar for the Other Guy but… this is much better.”
“You’re bleeding.”
It was a small smile, barely a twitch of the lips, and it was gone in a second when he remembered why he was using the damn BARF again. God, he killed Steve. What’s worse is that he didn’t even remember doing it. All that was left of that night in his mind was blinding rage. After that, it was a blur of medical bays and surgeries and no Captain America. No Steve.
3/31/2018 11:10am
“Oh, not enough?” Another handful was shoved into his already bulging cheeks.
“No,” said another voice. The three turned to see T’Challa coming around a corner, his mask in his hands. “Mr. Stark will not have to help you. I will.”
Yay! I finally finished this!
“Yes?” Tony asked, uninterested. He wasn’t really in the mood to do this tonight. Especially since it would just end in empty promises. They’d done this dance before; Steve would apologize and Tony would forgive him. It wasn’t that Tony didn’t want to forgive Steve, because he did. Things were just too fresh tonight.
Tony is trying to sell the house his father used to take mistresses.
“What would Daddy say if he knew you were whining?” Steve asked, returning to his normal speed.
While in the hospital, Steve was reevaluated and diagnosed with severe PTSD, survivor’s guilt, and bipolar disorder; a lot more than his initial diagnoses of moderate depression. Tony read the paperwork before Steve came home and had the chance to lie about his level of despondency.
“It should.”
“And, I, uh… I know we met on kind of unconventional circumstances. Not kind of.
“Nah. You already came, anyway. It’s okay. Another time. Now, my goodnight kiss?” Tony reached out and swatted blindly in an attempt to get his hands on Steve. Steve obligingly kissed Tony and crawled into the bed, flicking off the light.
“I think we have a few more years of poopy diapers and believing in Santa Claus and macaroni art.”
He opened his mouth, glanced at the coffin, then closed it. After a beat, he took off his sunglasses and placed them on the podium in front of him.
@cptsteverogers
The door swung open and Steve rushed in. Tony often forgot how quickly Steve could move. In battle, there was so much going on that he didn’t particularly pay attention to the pace of his teammates’ movements, just that they were still moving. In every other situation, Steve was poised, his body constantly in control.
@cptsteverogers: Could you please delete that last tweet?
Clint was at a loss. Would it be worse to acknowledge the situation or wait until it was over? Shoot an alien 100ft away with a bow and arrow without looking? Not a problem. Handling the fact that his two team leaders were currently wrapped up in a blanket together and... canoodling? Time to hop on the next train out of here.
Tony frowned.
reply to @tonystark
He tried it and he liked it. Something about masturbating to an audience was exhilarating. He was making money. He made a tumblr. He brought people to his show. For the first time in a long time, he was happy… as long as he didn’t think about what he was doing all that much.
There was scattered clapping and it took Tony a moment to realize that the president had just introduced him. He once again straightened his already straight tight, and stood. Every step towards the podium felt like running in the ocean. The waves kept pushing him back but he had to keep moving forward or he would be knocked down completely.
Steve is presumed dead. Tony presumed it was he that killed Steve.
“I... liked it too,” Tony confessed. “And I’d like to do it again. Because Iloveyoutoo.”
Steve looked down, blinked once. “Yes.”
5/17/2018 2:47pm
“Because you say things like ‘you’re my favorite’ to her sister. She doesn’t like that.”
Tonight marked that anniversary--the one that signaled half a decade together. The velvet box had been in his drawer since the six-month mark. Now it weighed heavily in his pocket.
The choir sung in Italian as the coffin was carried to the front of the church. Steve would know the name of what it was. Looking around at the stained glass windows, Tony figured that Steve knew all the saints by name and could identify each one.
“Probably?”
“Do you want me to leave?” Steve asked. “I shouldn’t have just come in and gotten in bed. That was creepy.”
“I’m calling them dampeners,” Tony announced, showing the tiny tab to Bruce. “It’ll slow down his metabolism and allow the effects of medications to take route in his brain.”
“That’s not nice.”
“How’d you… never mind. Of course you know where I am.”
Five years they’d been together. Five years of good morning kisses and afternoon “naps.” Five years of arguing and the occasional night on the couch. Five goddamn years. The best of Tony’s life.
a thing that people did. Normal people excused themselves and went to have sex in the privacy of their own room. Like Wanda and Vision had, 15 minutes into the movie. (Hold on, was everyone on the team by he and Sam shacking up with one another? Is this something he should be concerned about?).
“Sorry.”
During Steve’s monologue, Tony had managed to free his cock and was now stroking it. He was pretty sure that he would be able to cum from Steve speaking alone. But that’s not what he wanted. He wanted to cum watching Steve.
“Can I, uh, make another request?” Tony asked. Steve nodded. “Can I hold you? And, uh, maybe do this again sometime? Take you out to dinner at some point? Uh, court you?”
The world had seen his body. The picture had hundreds of thousands of views. It wasn’t even his best picture—just a low angle of him holding his cock and staring into the camera. The picture showed his abs, though, so he figured that was probably a selling point.
Opening the little white FedEx box addressed to him, Tony found a letter with only his first name, written in a familiar all-caps hand. As he read, he forced himself to hear Steve’s voice filter through the room.
“Things could be worse,” Rhodey assured.
“Cat.”
@spidermanfanparker
“You’re real Steve, aren’t you?” Tony all but whispered as he came to the realization. Maybe… shit, he must have accidentally sent the text.
“You're uncharacteristically non hyper verbal,” Pepper noted eight minutes into their 50 minute hour.
Protective Steve
He liked it.
@tonystark
“Tony--” Steve wished he hadn’t spoken because he didn’t have a clue what he would say.
Tony shrugged again. He’d been pretty sure that’s all that had happened. Had he done something stupid like
“Oh. You mean Fag-tain America!” The first shouted, as if his pun were actually worth hearing.
He wished he could just take his hearing aids out, but he was enjoying the movie and subtitles irritated Natasha. No matter how hard he focused on the screen, trying to channel all of his auditory abilities to the surround sound speakers, he was hyper-aware of the sounds coming from the loveseat a few feet away. Wet sounds.
“Sorry for stopping myself before I ran you over.”
“The service? Are you going?”
He’d send Doug nude Snapchats in hopes that his mother would see Doug looking at them. It was a long shot, but it worked. Doug sent them back and Steve’s stomach would lurch and he’d sometimes throw up.
“Tony, to the right,” Steve yelled. Tony did as told and Steve let out a sigh of relief.
reply to @WHIHOfficial
"Get on your back,” Steve instructed. Tony didn’t protest. He pulled out and laid on his back. Steve crouched over him and slowly eased himself onto Tony’s dick.
“Did we lose a man?” Steve asked, now more terrified.
He kept walking towards the group of guys and pulled up the greasy man by the front of his shirt. The group had immediately stopped laughing and Steve took a small amount of pride in that, but not as much as he did when he dragged the fucker out of the restaurant and punched him in the face, breaking his nose.
Tony pulled back experimentally before thrusting back into Steve. He set a slow pace and, yeah, it was good, but Steve needed more. Since it seemed Tony was having trouble letting go, Steve decided to take charge.
“Okay, driiiiiiift NOW!”
That was an option? Tony had to think. He couldn’t think. He brain was in his cock, which was currently throbbing and wanting nothing more than to be able to feel the release of orgasm. “I… y—you choose,” Tony finally stuttered out.
He stepped down from the podium and took his seat in the front pew again, sliding the red tinted glasses onto his face.
Sarah grunted.
“‘M not a cat,” Tony grumbled.
“How am I doing?” Steve asked.
impressive reaction time. what you have me on notifications or something?
He wasn’t about to start filming porn; at least not yet. He was going to get his degree first. But that didn’t mean he couldn’t play around. He looked into being a cam-girl… or boy, as the situation might be.
“For me or for you?”
“Alright Tony, tell me when to turn,” Steve said.
Tony rolled his eyes, his hands squeezing Steve’s face. “Override code 84875. Get Bruce up here
See you guys in a month ;)
“True,” Tony said. “But you mean more to me than just having sex.” Tony kissed him, closed-mouthed and quick. “I love you.”
It fit the man. Probably because he’d chosen it. Tony didn’t even care anymore. Tony just wanted to get on with this.
Tony broke out in a sweat. Until this point, it was purely hypothetical. Yeah, he was talking to a probable bot online and joking with it. Now… well, now he could log in and see a guy. Probably masturbating. Tony thought about it and he liked it. A lot.

“Hey there,” the man purred. Tony tried to swallow. This guy couldn’t be much younger than Tony, himself, if at all. “Thanks for joining me.” The man on camera stroked his cock slowly, then rubbed his thumb along the head and leaned his head back.
“I was talking about my other boyfriend.”
The garage door slid into place behind him. Mounting the bike, he took off down the street. Sprinklers kept lawns green and grandchildren ran around lawns with dogs. Longing knotted in his stomach; why could he be five and jumping through sprinklers again?
@cptsteverogers: oops
Please comment on this trash chapter. The next chapter is all planned out and I promise it will be better.
5/17/2018 11:16am
Tony was sitting at the desk in the study room on the end of Steve’s floor, fingers flying across his calculator. He spent his time at Steve’s place more days than not. They both preferred Tony’s apartment--a real apartment and not a dorm room--but Tony was the one with a car that was able to make the commute.
“Does it matter?” The man was still stroking his cock and Tony, well, Tony was growing impossibly harder looking at it.
@cptsteverogers: We are *not* having this conversation (again) via Twitter DMs (again) or *any other* social media platform (again).
*Finally* doing good with his fortune? What kind of knuckle dragging imbecile is incapable of seeing the good this man has done for his country and the world?
It's late, it's short, but it's here.
“So you can ride cock and moan like a fucking porn star, but you’re gonna chastise me about saying ‘Christ’?”
Steve was up and in the bathroom in seconds, clothes hurriedly discarded as he searched for his pajamas.
The floor fell out from under him. There was a twenty-pound weight in his gut. No. He wanted to punch Steve. To hurt him. He wanted to maim Bucky, the son of a bitch who’d been the divide in he and Steve’s marriage since they found out he was alive.
“You’re not ready to see it, but it’s true.”
“You want me to stretch my ass?” Steve asked, his voice dripping pure sex.
I don't know if I'm going to still keep writing this? There aren't a lot of comments and, idk, I feel like there's been depleted interest since the first chapter?
Steve chuckled. “Yeah, I guess I am.”
“Why wouldn’t it be?” Tony joked. For the first time since this started, he felt like himself. He could slide his mask back into place. For the first time since he “met” Steve, he felt as if he was in control.
Steve with children
“Daddy?” Sarah called after Steve, but he didn’t turn around.
“Are you allowed to ask me stuff like that? Aren’t we just supposed to wank and then part ways?
’ was heard from the loveseat. At that, Natasha, Bucky, and Sam all looked up to see what was happening. Clint didn’t even flinch. He didn’t need to know which one of them had just bust a nut. It was his lack of reaction, though, that gave him away.
“Not a problem.” Tony had an 8am the previous day and had woken up at 5:30 to get ready and get back to his own campus on time--it was no closing in on 1am. “Please come to bed and kiss me goodnight so I can go to sleep.” God, he was slurring. Damn Steve and his regular sleep schedule that Tony had gotten used to; he used to pull at least two all-nighters a week.
Steve knew he deserved it. Of course he did. He’d attempted to take his own life for some foolish reason even he couldn’t pin down. Maybe because it was an option he didn’t have before. Things with Tony had been so perfect. Maybe he wanted to end his life on a high note before the inevitable failing of their relationship.
Desperate to apologize, Steve sat up and ripped the IV from his arm. It wasn’t doing anything, anyway. If his mouth was as dry as it was now, the drip was not doing its job of hydration.
? That would be so much worse.
@cptsteverogers
“Cramps?” Steve asked, searching a website boasting realistic doctor’s notes.
Tony shook his head. “So you’re telling me that you’re ready for round two?”
Steve did, and it only took about four minutes before Tony was snoring again. Steve smiled, kissed Tony’s cheek, and laid down beside him. In the early morning sunlight, Steve caught a look at the gold band Tony wore around his ring finger. His wedding ring.
“I’m Tony,” Tony choked out. It really shouldn’t be this difficult to form a sentence. It was all so overwhelming.
@cptsteverogers: I know
“What did I do?” Tony asked, slightly alarmed.
Steve didn’t get out of bed much. Once a week his mom would call and check in; he’d say he was fine and tell her he loved her. She’d end the call with a falsely cheery, “Doug says hi, too” and his stomach would twist into knots. He knows she just had her third abortion since dating Doug because he refused to wear a condom and she refused to have his children.
He stumbled out of his hotel room, turning left, as he’d seen Tony do. Just around the next corner, he stopped short. Tony was on the floor, his knees tucked up against him. There were tears streaming down his face and he was making gasping little sounds that Steve wouldn’t have been able to hear if it weren’t from the serum.
to Steve, because they did stupid, cheesy stuff like that now. Only when he’d gotten there, Steve wasn’t anywhere to be found. Luckily, Tony had decided he should pee before he went back to work, or he wouldn’t have found
dog had diarrhea on floor should i go to vet
“Let ‘im in, J.”
He was broken from his thoughts when he heard the door open to admit Rhodey, using the chair he so hated. “That’s how you wish it happened.” It wasn’t a question. Tony, frowning, switched off the Binaurally Augmented Retro Framing device, throwing the glasses on the table. The vision of Steve sitting at a desk writing the letter fell away.
(2/4) Mothers, sisters, aunts, cousins, friends – I wouldn’t be where I am today if it weren’t for the support of loving, empowered women. I guarantee you wouldn’t be either.
“You tell James you love
“Just drop the bread and walk away,” Tony said. All three knew there was no malice to the remark, but they also knew Tony meant it when he said to leave.
It was then that a choked off
When they arrived at the cemetery, Tony shed the armor and watched as it collapsed itself into a discreet suitcase. He cracked his neck, straightened his tie, and rejoined the five other pall bearers.
Happy Easter.
“That’s what they call me.” It was a bad line, cheesy and overused, but the other choice was to do something stupid like say I miss you. It slipped out anyway.
When he was sixteen, he let Doug jerk him off in the garage. Doug asked and Steve, mad at his mom and his dad and the whole fucking world, agreed. When he came in Doug’s hand, the paunchy, balding asshole wiped it on Steve’s shirt. “If you tell your mom, it’s the end of you.” Steve managed to keep his composure until the door to the house had clicked shut behind Doug. He fell to the ground and wept.
5/17/2018 12:49pm
Tony was holding the phone, doing his nightly ritual of debating on whether or not he should push the button and dial the nine-digits he’d long ago memorized when it rang. He shouted and nearly threw the phone, but recovered at the last minute.
Marriage
“Did I do it?” Tony asked, peaking from out under the blindfold.
Steve woke to an empty bed. The clock to his left read 4:56am. His husband was nowhere in sight. Groaning, Steve pushed back the covers and stumbled to the bathroom. If he was going to be on a Tony hunt, he’d rather do it on an empty bladder.
“Uhng,” dream Steve groaned. Tony realized he’d been pulling on the hairs. “Sleepin’”
Tony watched the tape play in horror; the man standing a few feet to his right had murdered his parents. His limbs felt numb. A panic attack was coming, he could feel it in his every nerve.
Tony started to lick down the underside of his cock, all the while cupping his balls. Steve wasn’t sure what exactly Tony did, but all of a sudden his back arched and he was at a loss for breath.
Nah, it’s fine. What do you wanna talk about?
I guess this one is finished but I'm not pleased with it enough to post it on it's own, so enjoy this garbage I wrote 200 years ago.
@tonystark
The tension was gone in an instant as Tony leapt on Steve, smashing their mouths together. Steve may not have been a master of seduction, but he was a decent kisser. At least, he had thought he was until he kissed Tony because wow.
“Other men see me. I cum for them onscreen."
Steve’s brow furrowed. Had Tony done something wrong? Shit, was his supposed to take charge of everything and just… use the camm-er to fulfill his fantasy? It couldn’t work like that! He didn’t know what his fantasy was! Yes, he did, he knew his fantasy was Steve. So anything Steve did would have been perfect for him. Had he done it the right way? He wasn’t sure.
“You coming?”
Steve smiled, a tiny thing tugging up the corners of his lips. “Do you remember what happened in between you sitting down and that?”
“Doesn’t matter. Stop making my dream complicated. I just want to snuggle.”
5/17/2018 2:48pm
“I’m not a prostitute, Tony. You can kiss me.”
“I can do it myself, if you want,” Steve offered. Tony nodded, relief on his face.
“Tony,” Steve said, hesitant. Tony looked up as if he were just now noticing that Steve was in the room.
Bottom Steve, pre-relationship
“Yes, it’s against policy, but I’m worried. You seem out of sorts.”
Was the first thing that Tony figured he’d ask. Then say something like
Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, has opened a free rehabilitation clinic inside of his childhood home. Is he finally doing good with his fortune or is this just another publicity stunt to shine a good light to offset the waning trust in The Avengers?
the reason i'm telling y'all this is because i am not in the best place mentally. people i thought we my friends kicked me out of our... their, i guess now, home. idk when next update will come. also, that's why this chapter is shit.
“Yeah,” Steve let out another long breath and flopped back on the couch. Tony snuggled up to his side and handed over the controller and the blindfold. Steve took the controller while Tony got busy tying the blindfold around his eyes.
“Of course I meant it. Now kiss me. And I’m counting this one as our first kiss, not the other one, because I want to remember every part of our first kiss and I don’t remember every part of our last kiss so this is our official first kiss when people ask us years in the future about how we got together.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky is the only smart one
“I know you're trying to take down the patriarchy or set misogynistic douche bags right, but taking off your top and yelling at people for looking isn't solving the problem,” Steve said. Their friends had left hours ago and the pair were curled up on the loveseat, ignoring the TV while they made out. “Especially when those people are our friends.” He kissed her before she had a chance to respond.
“How about we say they went in with two legs and left with one,” Tony tried. Steve could see how much pain it cause Tony to actually have to say it. “And they have a very enhanced and ingenious serum in their body that heals most wounds, but it can’t grow back limbs.” A tear fell out of the corner of Tony’s eye. “I found it and I brought it back but it was too late. The stump--” his voice caught. “It had already started healed over.”
Tony groaned and rolled over so he was facing Steve. He forced his eyes open and, even in the dark, he could still see the faintest hint of the blue in Steve’s eyes.
Tony didn’t have the patience to sit there and stew over what he was about to do. He needed to blurt it out and he’d rather not do it with the server standing right there.
“Dr. Banner seems to be meditating. My protocol is to not disturb him.”
Steve licked his lips. “For us.”
“No problem.” Tony was glad the restaurant was too nice for paper napkins--it would have been shredded the moment Tony had arrived. “I ordered.”
It was almost offensive, honestly, that the two thought they were being sneaky. Oh goodness, there’s a couple curled up under a blanket in the dark during movie night and they’re giggling like schoolgirls. Gosh, gee wiz, what could possibly be happening over there?
Tony sucked on his teeth. Rationally, he knew that Steve was manipulating him. Tony’s therapist had told him about these kinds of manipulations; there wasn’t any maliciousness behind the act, only a desperate attempt to gain control over a situation. Knowing was nice, but it didn’t take the sting again.
“You know what. He needs to sleep in his crib.”
“Pitiful,” Clint drawled.
@cptsteverogers
Steve licked his lips and looked down. Tony could notice a thinking face when he saw one. Steve was actually considering it. Holy shit, that had been a shot in the dark.
