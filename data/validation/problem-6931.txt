Steve watches Peter with a wistful tug in his chest. He’s almost missed a whole year. First, seven months until the Accords were repealed, and then he was too much of a coward to be a part of the family again.
“Please.” Tony didn’t even know what he was pleading for, but he didn’t want it to end here, that much he was sure.
Tony’s eyes fixate on a point behind him, and he’s silent for so long Steve begins to think he isn’t going to get an answer.
And when she’d had to leave for meetings in Japan, and he’d started to overwork, dig deeper and deeper into the faulty code of an update for the newest StarkPhone, she’d…
Bucky’s gone, as well as Wanda and Sam. The largest part of the team he’s been with for the past years is gone.
And Tony stands there and grits his teeth because there’s nothing he can do to make Peter feel better.
Steve rips one of them away from her with his hands and sends in a punch with his sword. The others catch up and turn towards him; Natasha takes advantage of their backs being turned to get and beheads two of them. Steve quickly finishes the last one.
Con: He would know. As soon as he lands in Washington, he would know whether Pepper lived or died. Whether he at least still has his best friend.
He must have more difficulties to hide it than he normally does, because when they’re getting ready for bed, Tony turns to him and says “Stop looking like you’ve run over my nonexistent puppy.”
Tony resists the urge to sigh. The way Steve’s looking at their son, it’s like watching a dying man deny himself the salvaging medicine.
Steve rubbed gentle circles over the skin on Tony’s neck. “I know you have your issues. I wouldn't want you any other way.”
. He didn't unterstand why Steve couldn't stand for the Accords, and Steve also had Bucky to think about.
Then, all around him, aliens as well as warriors appear out of nowhere, most of them still confused.
Tony didn’t comment on the obvious statement. He looked at Steve and remained silent, letting him take the time he needed.
Tony leaned to the side, steadying himself with one hand on the counter, and was just able to see Hammer taking a run for it and disappearing in the crowd.
Steve squeezes his hand, lets him know he’s there without interrupting him. Tony takes a few seconds to respond, and the air grows heavier between them.
He asks Peter about his weekend when they’re both back at the compound, more because of his own self-destructive urges than actual concern for his son, but Peter lets himself be persuaded to talk anyway.
Steve doesn’t rise to the bait. It’s not like he hasn’t had that exact thought himself after he and Sharon called it quits again.
He expects for Bruce to blame him, ask him why he hadn’t worked harder to keep the Rogue Avengers out of Ross’ grasp, ask him why he’d resorted to violence in the first place.
The tree is towering over the mountain of presents under it, brightly decorated with ornaments in all colors and presents rice ranges. And, of course, real candles. Tony always insisted on them, even after one time a whole branch burned down because neither of them were paying attention.
The sunrise doused the whole room in warm light and Tony was close enough to see how the sun caught in Steve’s unfairly long lashes, how his skin started to glow and his blond hair was shining. Jesus. He’d always thought Steve was gorgeous, but this was something else entirely.
That evening, Peter doesn’t talk about his day. Instead, he asks about how Tony’s feeling and really, he always knew he didn’t deserve Peter, but the universe doesn’t have to rub it in like this, thank you very much.
Tony hadn’t mentioned it once so far, which Steve was glad for. At first, he hadn’t been sure if we was ready to paint right here, especially since the changed skyline of Brooklyn had been difficult for him to look at for a long time.
He kneels in front of Tony and carefully takes his hands. When Tony raises his head and looks at him, Steve speaks. Carefully.
That makes Steve feel uncomfortably warm. The mention makes him remember their nights spent in bed, the way Tony felt under him, around him, the sound of the little gasps he’d make.
It all goes surprisingly well; they manage to break into the warehouse, destroy the weapons and take the sellers out of the game as well.
Peter didn’t even get the quick death like everyone else. Stupid kid with his stupid powers had tried... he had tried to hold on for as long as he could.
Peter tenses anyhow. “You don’t understand,” he says, still quietly, but with an edge to his voice. “Tony needs me, I can’t just,
“He disappeared,” Steve whispers, his fingers never wavering in their calm path across his back. “Didn’t he?”
He almost wishes for Rhodes to come back and slap him, but then the Colonel probably wouldn’t let him see Tony for at least five days if he did and Steve wants to make this right.
(He wasn't proud of it, the way the thought of Tony made heat pulse through him; he was in way too deep.)
“The world is facing a bigger threat than ever before, and we have yet to see the Avengers do something about it.”
He’d actually only ever seen the short special they’d aired when he was 12. When the film came out in 2000, he’d been way too busy feeling miserable to bother.
Tony’d seldom been so happy to get back inside - except, when they stepped into the cabin, they were met with freezing cold.
He drops to the ground next to him, wraps his arms around Tony’s shaking frame and holds him. For as long as it takes for his panic attack to fade.
Steve shrugged. “I’m gonna get some wood. If you can find something to light them with, we should be fine.”
Tony blinked, and Steve blushed a little in response. For a moment, it seemed like either of them would pull away any second, but Tony figured
Steve watches him go, and as soon as he’s out of eyesight, walks over to the tree to add his own presents to the pile.
Tony doesn’t know whether to feel worried or just so stupidly, madly in love that it drowns out everything else.
“He offered to meet me more often,” Peter says hesitantly. “‘Cause he and... and the others, they have a place outside of town.”
Steve glances into the kitchen, where Tony is laughing at a now even more flour covered Peter, and knows Rhodey’s warning was unnecessary. He’d never forgive himself if he did them wrong again.
“Tony,” she said, much more gently than she normally would’ve. “You volunteered to go to the Van Dyne’s fundraiser.”
At least it gives him an inkling of Steve’s mood. (He tells himself he shouldn’t care, but he does. Too much.)
Clint grumbled, complaining about how Steve’s usual choices (anything that was at least 50 years old).
Once they reach the field between the concrete of the building and the forest, Steve crouches and begins to
In his dreams, Steve keeps seeing Tony collapse in front of him, clutching at his chest in a vain attempt to get his heart beating again. He wakes up with heaving breaths and tightens his arms around Tony, as if that could change anything.
When Tony stumbled into the kitchen again a few hours later, the sun was already peeking through the New York skyline. He didn't bother checking the clock - it wasn't like he’d be going back to sleep anyway.
In real life, Tony gets out of breath easily while walking up the stairs, his heart starts beating too quickly and he has to sit down for a while. Steve then wonders how often Tony hid that from him, and feels like throwing up.
But now, all he wants is to feel Tony in his arms. And every day he spends with Peter is a reminder of how thoroughly messed up things between them are.
Steve’s arms tightened around him in response. One was still around his waist, the other slowly travelled upwards to his neck, until all Tony felt was Steve.
Steve opens his mouth to protest, then closes it again, remembering that first and foremost, Tony would always search for the mistake in himself.
“And how would you know that?” Peter hisses, glaring at him. “You weren’t there the past two years!”
He doesn’t know how much time has passed when his grumbling stomach finally forces him to leave the room and go back to the common areas.
“No,’’ Steve said, smiling at where their hands were intertwined on the table. It surprised him how true it was. He was still nervous, yes, but this felt like exactly where he was supposed to be.
“Drawing you,” Steve confirmed. “Because I love you, and even though you’d made it pretty clear you wanted nothin’ more to do with me, I couldn't let you go.”
Steve knows Tony’s probably lost people too. But the haunted look in his eyes tells of more than that.
Some of the other attendants have started to pair up to dance to the slow music a piano player provides.
Steve doesn’t even know why he’s so unprepared for that, because it clearly shouldn’t be a surprise.
Peter’s eyes widen, but Steve doesn’t stop to let him talk. He knows his resolve will probably crumble along the way if he did.
The doctor doesn’t tell them much, just listens in on Tony’s heartbeat and breathing, frowns at it, takes his blood pressure, frowns again. Then, after putting his stethoscope away, he looks at Tony, who’s still sitting on the examination table and asks, “How long have you been having these symptoms?”
This time, Tony manages to get the bitterness into his voice. “Yeah, sure. Tell them I’ll miss the family get-together.”
As soon as the door slid shut behind him, Tony took a second to take some deep breaths before entering their small medbay, where they had deposited Steve on one of the cots they kept for emergencies.
As it turned out, the only thing that was open on he 25th of December was a Christmas market two towns over.
They situate each other so that their shoulders are just shy of touching. Steve can still feel Tony’s presence, and they have the space needed for a conversation like this.
Said man fails to assign Rhodey’s tone of voice a proper emotion, but figures it doesn’t matter anyway, since his life is shit at this point anyway.
Thor nodded his understanding and they teamed up to get Captain America to board the Quinjet. Which was easier than expected, given the fact that Steve went willingly, but also a lot more exhausting, as keeping his mouth shut seemed to be impossible for him.
Steve feels his body tense. Sometimes, he hates Natasha’s ability to get under people’s skin so effortlessly, to speak truths nobody is ready to hear yet. Especially if it’s something as close to heart as this.
His voice is small and frantic, his young body trembling in fear as his body dissolves right under Tony’s hands, who can’t do anything but stare and weep.
And that was that - their conversation was over. Which probably should’ve given Steve some indication that something had gone wrong, but as it was, he was too busy feeling giddy to realise.
And, well, for all Tony cared, Steve might as well have given him a sleeping pill. He tried to focus on the screen - since focusing on his own thoughts was much worse - but it wasn’t any good. He never got art. There was something to it that others saw that he didn’t.
Except, when he looked back to the kitchen, Steve was standing with his back to him, hands braced on the isle, unmoving. Every muscle seemed to be tensed up, as if he was waiting for a fight.
Natasha intercepts him in the hallway, as if she was waiting for him to show up there. Which she probably
Steve flinches. The words impale themselves in his chest like a knife, and he can’t even defend himself, because they’re true.
They stop at a small but cozy Italian restaurant that they’ve been to a few times. Tony likes it; the employees are very discreet, and the food is to die for.
“Oh,” Tony responded brazenly, “you know, the usual. Kept Bruce from murdering Clint, and Thor from starving, so I think we can call this evening a success.”
Tony clenches his jaw. This isn’t how it’s supposed to be. This fight is between him and Steve alone. And yet, Peter’s still caught in the middle.
“Because I was scared you didn't mean it. That you’d realise you made a mistake and leave,” Tony replied promptly, before he’d even had the time to think about the fact that maybe, this was the exact topic he’d avoided talking to Steve about for over a year. “But I was even more scared that you’d meant it, and I’d fuck it up again. Because I always do, you know? And you, you deserve better.”
Tony clenched his hands as he felt them start to shake. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” he grid out through clenched teeth. “I’m not -”
Tony takes a step back and shakes his head, like a confused animal. “Why? I know you regret it, you shouldn‘a gone back to a slut like me.”
Natasha tilted her head when he sat down opposite her. “Steve?” She asked, with a frightening amount of certainty.
“None of us had any influence on who disappeared and who didn’t.” Steve’s voice is calm and self-assured. “It’s not your fault.”
“You left,” he finally whispers, almost too quiet for Steve to hear. “And Mr. Stark, I mean Tony, he... He didn’t talk to me at first, see? But then he did, and I started to be around him more and- ”
“Why did you leave your ring then?” Tony asks instead, openly, giving him a chance to explain his actions.
The nurses let him, but Steve knows how they look at him when they think he can’t see: with a horrible mixture of pity and worry. Steve knows what they think, and they’re right; Tony’s care takes all of his time and energy; he hasn’t even been to movie nights or team training. And more often than not, he forgets to feed and bathe
Unfortunately for everyone involved, Tony decides to leave the Compound to do some testing on his new suit just as Steve’s car stops at the end of the driveway.
Steve nods; he always suspected Tony had a problem like this. Too much noise in his head, too much fear of waking up screaming if he did go to sleep.
“You should eat,” Steve says, even though he’s done nothing but stare at the foot for the past thirty minutes.
Steve doesn’t realize how tightly he’s clenching the wine glass in his hands until a calm voice swiftly cuts in.
Steve runs as soon as he realises what’s happening. He doesn't know how or why, only that one of his biggest nightmares have come true and the very thing that’s supposed to protect Tony has turned into a deadly trap.
Their lines are being pushed back, closer and closer towards the woods, where Tony so desperately needs them to keep the aliens away.
“Well, it did.” Tony looks down to wheres he’s sitting on the couch with indifference. “And you’re the one who has to live with it.”
Steve feels helpless. He misses Tony like one might do a limb - a phantom pain that never goes away, no matter how futile it is.
Steve feels a telltale pressure behind his eyes and fights it down. Tony being here is dragging up all sorts of feelings he’d long buried. (And yet, he yearns for every moments he gets to have with him.)
The waiter brings them sparkling water - because Tony’s trying to stop drinking, and the pride shining in Steve’s eyes is worth it.
Tony’s standing next to his workbench. His hands are clinging tightly to its edges, and Steve can see him breathing shallowly.
Chills wrack Steve’s body, because that’s the forest, that’s where Tony is, and just as the explosion has settled, Thor dives in from seemingly out of nowhere and disappears in the smoke.
”Well unfortunately, your living space also contains your company. And it makes customers feel more relaxed if we decorate.”
Steve knows Wakanda can heal bullet wounds in a day, but he also knows that every technology has its limits.
“We’re talking about this tomorrow,” Steve said, after a few moments of heavy silence. “When you can think clearly, okay?”
“He has a few open wounds but none of them are life threatening. With him being in the middle of the explosion there will be blunt-force trauma to his organs, especially internal bleeding. He needs to get to a hospital as soon as possible.”
“It’s been two months, I think,” Steve’s husband answers, flatly. “It was just shortness of breath at first, but I’ve been feeling more exhausted the last couple of weeks.”
Tony shook his head. “Nothing to be sorry about. And I’d say being stuck in a cabin with a national icon is a pretty good outcome.”
Hammer spread his hands. “I think we could both profit from this. Hammer Industries will get the funding it needs and your company will get back on the right track.”
“You can let me go to that fundraiser,“ Tony snapped. He sighed and rubbed his temples. He knew she just wanted to help. But that almost made it worse; having to admit that there was something to be concerned about. “I just need some distraction, Pep, promise.”
“Wait,” Thor complained. “I also require snacks.” He also got up and walked over to the poor kid that looked terrified at having three Avengers coming towards him at full speed.
“Never mind,” Tony grumbled. “Look, I’m awake, you’ve fulfilled whatever moral duties you think you have, you can leave me alone.”
Tony doesn’t watch him leave. He’s back inside before the buzzing of the engine fades out, already scanning the building for his son.
“Oh really.’’ Tony raised his eyebrows, and damn, that shouldn't be so attractive on him. “Cause you're standing at parade rest.’’
He could feel Steve’s eyes following him as he left, burning into his back like soldering iron, but he forced himself to ignore it.
Tony unconsciously pressed his body closer to Steve’s. He wanted, needed to feel him as much as possible while he still could; who knew what would happen once the bubble of their secluded cabin bursted.
Steve didn’t move, didn’t even acknowledge him. Tony sighed and untangled himself from the cocoon on the couch. He moved towards Steve hesitantly. He knew this wasn’t going to be an easy conversation, and he’d known Steve for little longer than half a year. But still, he couldn’t just sit there and watch, while Steve was -
With a bit of swearing and much more patience on Steve’s side they managed to get a fire going. The effect was immediate; Tony felt like his fingers and toes were just then slowly coming back to life.
Peter hesitates for a second, then slowly began to help him. Steve gave it a few moments, mulled the words over in his head and wondered just how much he was supposed to tell Peter.
Before he was even fully aware of what he was doing, he was halfway across the room, standing between Tony and that Alpha.
Peter’s shaking fingers bury themselves more insistently into Tony’s clothes. He looks back at his kid and sees Peter stare at him with big, pleading eyes.
“Hey.” Steve kneels down in front of him, takes Peter’s hands and patiently waits for his son’s tear filled eyes to look into his. “What’s wrong?”
Bucky even told him he looked sick before he left, so there was that. Maybe people would avoid him instinctively. But that wasn’t why he agreed to attend when Tony asked him; the Maria Stark Foundation had suffered under significant cuts in donations, and if him being there would help to show people they had reconciled, then he’d gladly suffer for a few hours.
cold, and he’d lived with his shitty childhood for way too long to still be so upset about it. Steve was probably already regretting -
“No!” Tony shouted, sitting up straighter, then winced. “It’s… I told you, it wasn't his fault. I have it handled.”
of all things; probably told him some elaborate story about how it was super important in Midgardian culture.)
He leads Steve to the roof, where he has a small conservatory that they used to frequent often, back when their relationship was still fresh.
Tony sighed. He didn't have to listen to her probing questions to know why she was calling. “Put her through.”
But she also doesn’t need to know about every last aspect of his relationship with Tony, and hence, he doesn’t elaborate.
(Steve told him, once, how lost he’d felt in his new century. How Tony had given him a place to belong to.)
He looks over to the table, where a big construction is build up that vaguely reminds him of the huge cranes in a harbor.
Steve knew he did, but it’s different, hearing it from the kid who’s been at Tony’s side when he wasn’t.
She immediately starts tapping away on her machinery, so of course Steve has no idea what any of those screens mean, if it’s good or bad, if Tony’s gonna come back to him and his face is
“Sometimes, when you make the wrong decisions you can have temporary mishaps. I’m sure you're aware of that.”
“You’re like hot chocolate,” Steve repeated, as if that made perfect sense. “You make me feel all warm and happy inside.”
Steve frowns at him - of course he does, how dare Tony disrespect his authority by leaving the meeting early - but Tony can’t stay in this room for a minute longer. The talks of
For a second, his mind can’t catch up, and really, he should have appreciated that second more, because when everything comes rushing back, he has the strong urge to jump out of the window right then and there.
His eyes travel from Tony to Steve and back, but he doesn’t comment on the strained mood between them and simply starts to explain what he’s found.
He still vows to make everything right again, and feels more like a hypocrite than during his days as Captain America the actor.
There’s no more treatments to try, the doctors say, and thanks to Helen Cho, they have even better monitoring systems at the tower than the hospital does in the ICU.
Before Tony can even open his mouth, Peter turns around and Tony freezes at the tired look in his eyes.
Tony laughs. That horrible, self-deprecating laugh he’s learned to hate. “Oh Cap, I’ve never been better.”
When they kiss for the first time, it’s just after the battle of New York. They’re on the Tricarrier, still roughed up from the fight, and apparently Steve’s shaken enough to forget that Tony’s not someone he’s supposed to like.
Dinner is a silent affair. Rhodey is eyeing them both with a watchful gaze, and Steve doesn’t quite know what to do with himself. The absence of the other team members is almost tangible, though Steve understands that Tony doesn’t want them here yet. He’s glad Tony’s ready to talk to him at least.
Steve smiles, even as his heart grows heavy and sullen. An outsider would probably scoff - Tony Stark,
If none other, Steve at least keeps this promise. After twenty-five minutes, FRIDAY pipes up quietly and announces that Steve Rogers is requesting entry.
Still, Steve feels uneasy to leave Tony for that long. He’s completely defenseless, and Steve is fidgety and distracted at first, not even posing any kind of challenge for Clint and Natasha.
“I can’t sleep,” is what comes out of Steve’s mouth because apparently, sticking to safe topics is impossible for him.
“Las’ night,” Tony slurs, ignoring the little voice in his head telling him he ought to stay quiet about that.
Tony didn’t have a sleigh at his cabin, much less any maps of the surrounding area, which had given him hope of getting out of this, but Steve had just flattened out some cardboard boxes and used Google Maps.
In the end, Rhodey hauls him bodily up the stairs, and since Tony’s not really in control of his limbs, he can’t put up much of a fight.
“Oh man, thank god you guys were here,” the young hero said, visibly out of breath. “I think Rhino got some sort of upgrade and now he’s shooting rockets at me.”
He must’ve passed out sometime after six in his workshop. His head hurts and his back shoots arrows of pain through his spine when he tries to move.
But then, just as the door closes behind him, Peter comes barreling around the corner and jumps into his arms. Steve hugs him back instinctively, then frowns.
The stab wound in his side might or might not be infected; he hasn’t looked at it yet, and the pain faded into background noise ever since -
He barely makes it out of his bed and down the hall to the bathroom, where he spends the next few minutes retching up what little he’d eaten. Cursing the fact that he listened to Steve’s request and went to bed.
He can still feel the dampness of his skin, Steve’s touch on his thighs, the cold lube inside of him.
“And then you’re gonna get some rest as well,” Bucky says sternly. “You’re no help to Tony like this.”
“Steve.’’ Tony’s tone was calm, resolute. He cut Steve off, but Steve was almost grateful for it. He didn't know how to properly express the feeling of never wanting to loose Tony again, even though he wasn't even really sure they'd get back together. “We can’t do this now, not here. Do you understand me?’’
There was massive bleeding in Tony’s brain, and they haven't been able to reverse all the damage. Even if he were, by a miracle, to regain consciousness, the old Tony would still be gone. Memory loss and paralysation from the neck down is the best case scenario, and even that is unlikely.
. No, he’s not, but it’s not as simple as that. And any other answer than yes would make him a shit father, and an even worse person.
As it is, Tony is currently sitting at the kitchen table with his head in his hands. He knows better than to follow Peter right now and possibly rile him up even further, which leaves him with a lot of time to think about what happened.
In their day-to-day lives however, the worry was more of a constant state of anxiety. Tony was a spitfire, had always been, and that didn't change after they started their relationship. He never held back, be it towards reporters, villains or overly pushy Alphas at galas. And Steve instinctively wanted to move in front of him every time Tony got into an argument.
Tony sucked in a breath, and tried to remind his stupid, racing heart that Steve was high up to his ears. “You know, Steve, maybe you should just stop talking. Your future self would be very grateful for that, believe me.”
Steve, in all fairness, has stopped radiating discomfort and is now acting like nothing ever happened.
Steve though had to pack everything for the first time. Naturally, being Steve, he just took his single duffel bag from the backseat and followed Tony up to the cabin.
Tony scowled. Fine, he’d had a rich childhood, by that didn’t warrant that much of a shocked expression. “I didn’t have a lot of friends Steve. And Dad wouldn’t have -” He came to a halt, realizing Steve probably didn’t want to know that his wartime friend turned out to be a grade A asshole.
Pictures from their wedding and honeymoon, from numerous trips all around the world that Tony took them on.
He hasn’t seen Peter since he stormed out on him, and even though he knows Peter can take care of himself, there’s still worry curling in his chest.
In the end, it didn’t even matter as halfway through the movie, the door swung open so suddenly, that all of them turned to the hallway. They heard a few heavy steps before Tony came stumbling in, a bulky machine in his arms.
Tony can hear the hurt Steve’s so desperately trying not to show in every word he says. He yearns to comfort him, but it’s not his place anymore.
As soon as the clock struck midnight, something changed in Tony. It was December 16th now, and he was 17 again, standing alone on a graveyard.
It wasn’t like he thought Omegas shouldn’t speak their mind, but talking like that would even get an Alpha into a fight.
“What do you want me to say, huh?” There are unshed tears in his eyes, the kind Tony would never let fall. “We lost. I fucked up, it’s my fault the kid’s gone and I...” His voice breaks, and he trailed off.
Because after Siberia, there was no doubt in his mind he and Steve were over. And now, now, with the way Steve had avoided his eyes...
, it makes him feel nauseous. He knows, waiting for the right opportunity is the smart move, but every fiber in him is yelling at him to get Peter back and suddenly, once again, he knows all too well how Quill must’ve felt.
Tony sighs and vaguely gestures at the mess on the floor. “I built him, would you believe that? And all he’s good for is mopping up glass. No wonder Howard didn’t...” He trails off, frowning, as if he hadn’t meant to say that.
“We’ve tried everything we can.” Bruce holds out his hands imploringly, as if this is a negotiation for peace. “There’s nothing more we can do. And even if he does wake up, it… He won’t be himself.”
Steve pushes his way through the battlefield, walks over bodies of both friends and foes until he’s made it to where the Black Widow has been crowded against rocks by four of the alien animal-creatures.
Tony’s eyes are still open - thank god for that - and he’s staring at Steve while taking rapid, uneven breaths.
Tony put a hand on Steve’s shoulder, partly to pacify Steve and partly to steady himself. “Steve, ‘m fine. ’S just Hammer.”
Peter inhales sharply, and it seems like the words are tumbling right out of his mouth. “Tony, he- I screwed up a mission, once, and he told me that if I died, he’d feel responsible.”
He doesn’t need to ask what Peter means. He also can’t tell him that Tony knew that it wasn’t his fault.
Steve gets up and turns away from him. He can’t bear to look at Tony’s face, knowing it’ll miss the warmth he used to look at him with.
FRIDAY opens the door for him, which is the first surprise of the day. Steve always knew Tony’s creations to be protective of him, and he doesn’t even have to argue with the AI.
But this was why he was doing this - because this century was his home now. And he missed Brooklyn. Not just the Brooklyn he grew up in, but as his home in general.
The blinds are drawn tight with only very little light filling the room and it’s so quiet that Tony doesn’t dare to raise his voice above a whisper.
For a second, he considered going after Clint and ripping all the decorations off, but considering that he wasn’t planning to be at the tower during Christmas anyway, it seemed like too much of a struggle.
Seeing Steve during the pardon trial was bad enough. Realizing he couldn’t look at his own husband without remembering his shield coming down on him was bad, but still feeling a part of the love for him was even worse.
“They have a medical center here,” he says hollowly, pointing at a building that seems so, so far away. “Ask for Shuri, she’ll know what to do.”
“It scans objects and assigns them to the smallest possible packaging,” Peter explains animatedly. “My teacher says we could save tons of plastic this way!”
Steve told him about happier times before the war, when Bucky would drag him along to Cony Island despite his health issues. He told him about their double dates and how out of place he’d always feel, as scrawny as he’d been.
Tony squinted at the lanky man before him and wondered which one of his public scandals that was supposed to be a jab at.
Tony’s small smile told Steve how pleased Tony was, though outwardly he just shrugged and said, “Don’t worry about it. Making sure people can enjoy the best things about the future is basically my job. I could show you a lot more.”
Steve refuses to look at the woods, to which Nebula had lured Thanos. It was a trap, of course, with Tony, Thor, Scott and Rhodes waiting within the trees. If their plan of attack had worked like it was supposed to, Rhodes would’ve flown the gauntlet out of there ages ago.
Tony grins and takes him to the dance floor with the practiced ease of someone who’s done this a hundred times and counting.
with me, Steve? Look at me, I can’t even take care of Peter without ...” He makes a gesture, pointing vaguely at himself.
He doesn’t get to see Peter’s reaction to that though, because right in that moment, Shuri enters the room.
. They go out to eat in the evening, back to that small, Italian restaurant in which Steve had asked Tony to marry him.
Steve follows Peter up the stairs towards the common area, trying his best to listen to his son’s breathless ramble. By the time they reach the living room, where a massive tree stretches all the way to the ceiling, Steve’s caught up on pretty much everything that happened in the morning.
Steve places a hand on the small of Tony’s back when they walk up the stone steps to the door. A waiter greets them and sees them to their table immediately; apparently Steve’s been planning this.
He knows Tony’s been discharged, but for the past three days, the billionaire was holed up in the lab he’s been provided with. It’s so achingly familiar that it takes every ounce of his self control not to hurry over and steady Tony’s exhausted frame.
“Yeah, about that,” Tony says briskly. “I’m about to finish my new suit, and it’ll be so pumped up with nano-tech the purple asshole won’t even know what hit him. So, if you’ll excuse me?”
On their left, the side of the mountain was more shallow and the trees were further apart. Standing there, Tony still didn’t get the excitement, but he indulged Steve. (
Tony sighs and wishes Peter wouldn’t be old enough to understand. Because he’s right in demanding that Tony try, and yet he can’t do it, not even for his son.
“Now I get why you watch those telenovelas,” Clint said to Nat and was, predictably, hit by a pillow.
Rhodey just nods, and Steve realizes Tony must’ve talked to him about this, which reassures him, in a weird way. At lest he’s not jumping into this without being sure of himself.
It was Christmas Eve. Normally, he’d be holed up in his workshop, on exactly zero hours of sleep and way too many coffees, doing everything he could to forget what day it was. And yet, he’d followed Steve out into the woods. He’d had fun, even. And he thought Steve did too, but right now, it was like Steve was consciously trying to get away from him.
was lovely at this time of the year. At least, that’s what Pepper had told him, but she’d said it in an obnoxiously happy tone of voice that told him she thought nothing of it.
So when they finally get the gauntlet off of the titans hands and Nebula keeps him occupied, Tony just forces the metal of Rhodey’s suit to bend around it. Then, he pushes his old friend towards Thor, yelling, “Hit him!” and the god blasts him into the sky with everything he’s got.
Even though they’re on speaking terms now, it isn’t his place to intervene anymore. He can’t even really justify to himself that he’s on his way to the Compound. Tony will be even more unstable than he was all the years prior, and Steve can’t stay away, even though it’s his fault.
Rhodey eyes him with a measuring stare. “You didn’t see him after Siberia. Or Peter. I know Tony invited you here, but just because he’s given you this, doesn’t mean you can take a mile.”
Steve was looking at him with wide eyes, and Tony saw the overwhelming desire in them as clear as glass. Steve bit his lip. “I haven’t even... We haven’t even had a date yet.”
But he doesn’t want to run from them. He wants Peter to have a family as normal as possible, and he’s never, ever missed this.
There’s a bit of awkward shuffling, because Steve’s trying to tug Peter into his arms, but his movements are stiff and unsure.
As soon as Tony saw Clint with the giant cardboard box full of ornaments and lights, he left the room. Better yet, he left the floor altogether and went down to the gym to take his bad mood out on the boxing bag.
Now that he’s explained what’s going on, he expects Rhodey to get along with his plan of never, ever leaving the workshop again, but the man now seems even more insistent.
The team was still a team. Bucky had found his death fighting Redskull. Steve still had a place to call home. Him and Tony were still lovers.
But Tony’s not his, not anymore. Steve made that choice himself when he left his ring and his family behind. He’d still been so full of anger and frustration when he’d written the letter. Tony had tried to kill his best friend, the man that had had his back during his youth and the war. He’d refused to listen and put the government before Steve and the team. He didn’t imagine them ever coming back from that. (He didn’t even want to think about the possibility of Tony forgiving him; it seemed as far away as another dimension.)
He gets out of breath - of course he does - and has to sit down at the top of the stairwell, shaking. Steve sits down next to him, wraps his arms around his husband and holds him, because there’s nothing else he can do.
He hesitated. He didn’t know if Steve would appreciate any stories about Howard, but he felt like he had to acknowledge Steve’s honesty somehow.
He feels Tony getting ripped away from him and there’s nothing he can do except sit there and hope that Tony really wasn’t scared, that Tony didn’t lie to him.
He’s trying to get into a healthier routine, because he knows Tony wouldn’t have wanted him to fall apart like this.
It’s one of the few time he’s honestly glad that Tony is as rich as he is; this way, they don’t have to wait as long to get appointed to a doctor.
There’s not enough air in the room; his lungs refuse to obey to his command, and all around him, there’s this weird hum instead of what he was actually supposed to be hearing and -
Steve’s nervous. Steve isn’t nervous around him anymore. Careful and attentive as he’s always been, yes, but never nervous.
Well. Now Tony at least knew what she’d meant. If he’d had the time, and the mental crisis for it, he could see himself putting his Malibu home into a similar state.
Steve watched Tony shout at Thor and Hulk to stop wrestling each other. This was his family. The people that made the future feel like home. And Tony was more than just an integral part of that.
Tony watches him with what Steve hopes is concern in his eyes. “Remember when you used to drag me out of the lab and make me go to sleep? Yeah, I felt like that then, too.”
It fades into background noise. Gradually, but it does, and Steve becomes all the more tender for it. Kisses on the forehead, gently stroking Tony’s skin, roses, the works.
It’s long overdue. And yet, when the date of Tony’s fall comes around again, he feels far from ready. It’s so easy to delude himself into thinking putting it off would be okay, Tony’s still right
They played a lot of video games, apparently. Watched some movies and attempted to make pasta. It sounds so familiar that Tony almost has to excuse himself to his workshop to have a few panic attacks in peace.
Jealous, maybe, but that wasn’t the right word. Terrified. Sad. Lonely. Perhaps a combination of everything.
Steve wondered if that was still the case, and his lungs constricted even more at the thought of Tony suffering through this.
The room Okoye has provided him with is big and spacious, with a bed much more comfortable than anything he’s had in the past two years.
Steve clenches his hands and has to resist the urge to close his eyes. He knows Tony has little to no sense of self-preservation, but this is taking it to a whole other level.
Peter’s eyes go as wide as saucers, and just a few seconds later, Steve has his son in his arms. “You came!”
When they finally parted, Tony had that warm feeling in his belly that Steve had probably been talking about earlier.
Steve can’t blame him. The poor guy came back to the Avengers torn apart and now one of them is dangling on a thread.
They sit in silence, in horrible, tense silence, while Steve thinks about the fact that Tony could’ve died without him even knowing there was anything wrong.
Steve glanced back at Tony searchingly, but whatever he found on Tony’s face made him expression darken.
“Also...” Tony goes on without indicating that he’s picking up any of Steve’s reactions. “Half the Universe is dead. Hardly matters.”
Pepper skillfully ignored him and rushed off to her next appointment, leaving Tony to scowl up at the golden ornaments on the tree that now stood in the entrance hall of the tower.
They heard him swing away in the direction of the loud crashes, but that seemed as though it was lightyears away from Steve.
Tony blinked. Normally, he only saw that kind of determined step in Steve during a battle, what was -
Two months after the crash, Clint and Natasha coax Steve into training with them. (They have Bruce watch Tony for the two hours Steve’s gone, which was Steve’s condition to go with them in the first place.)
It doesn’t even do him any good, wishing for these times to come back. He doesn’t even know if he’d be strong enough to be in a room with all of the old Avengers, even if he got the chance.
Later, he’ll be able to reconstruct what happened with the team, that Tony was knocked out of the sky by a blow so heavy it sent almost all of his suit’s system offline, including the communication links.
Maybe it hadn’t been such a good idea to bring Thor and Hulk along though - shortly after they had sat down in their seats, they noticed a vendor carrying snacks walking through the ranks, which was when the quiet, relaxing part of their outing was over for a moment.
He remains sitting there, fighting against his anxiety for a good hour or so, continuously tethering on the edge of breaking down for good.
“I didn’t like the USO shows either.” Steve sounds resigned, almost depressed. “But it know it’s important for me to show up. If it’s for charity, you know.”
Tony breathes in deeply as he remembers. Peter won’t be home. He’ll be in the city to meet up with Steve.
In typical Natasha-fashion, that leaves little room for argument, but Tony’s too exhausted to try anyhow.
“Bedrooms are upstairs,” Tony said, making a vague gesture to the stairwell. “Just take whatever one you want, I’ll mostly be in the workshop anyway.”
, it’s is one of the two things he was so sure about never experiencing in his life that he never even dared to dream of it; with the other one being peace.
, but what they all don’t understand is that he knows Tony better than Tony knows himself. He doesn't need any of them to tell him what Tony would've wanted. As long as there’s still a chance, Tony would always fight to come back to Steve, he
It was a long flight back home, and Tony hid in one of their storage spaces for almost three hours. It was arguably the longest three hours of his life, and not only because the floor wasn’t particularly comfortable.
Steve frowned at him. “Are you sure? It’s just, I’ve never seen you like this. Sitting and doing nothing, I mean.”
Steve felt his cheeks get warmer. Even though Tony approached him like it was nothing, sharing heats required incredible trust on the Omega’s side. And that Tony had decided to ask him was…
Something sharp bumped into his foot. Tony turned his head and saw DUM-E, clutching Tony’s thickest blanket in his claw.
“I wanted to tell you in person, I swear.” Steve’s close to pleading with Tony, and forces his voice to remain somewhat steady. “I never - I never wanted it to end like this.”
Steve watches him wander around in the kitchen, and hates the fact that he knows all too well what Tony’s searching for. He’s supposed to be over this.
Luckily, Steve didn’t even notice. His eyes were shining with joyous excitement, and it lightened up his whole face. “Lets go sledding!”
“I said I’m coming,” Steve repeats in that calm, steeled voice of his. “I’m half an hour out, tops.”
Tony smiled as he smoothed his finger over the delicate swirl of Steve’s handwriting. A warm feeling spread through his chest, one that he hadn't felt in twelve months.
“Hey, look,” Steve said a while later, nudging his shoulder to show him an old man selling a bunch of knitted hats.
He does his best to smile down at his that’s already been through enough. “I think you’re getting sick, kiddo.”
The first time Tony invited him to spend his heat with him, Steve’s brain short-circuited, and he barely managed to get a strangled
It wasn’t like flying. Hell, it wasn’t like driving a fast car, either, but he couldn’t seem to shake that ridiculous grin. Steve was yelling something behind him that Tony couldn’t quite understand, by it sounded happy, and Tony’s heart swelled even more.
This time, there was no hesitation, no carefulness, and most importantly, Steve responded to Tony’s kisses.
“I know you can hear me, and don’t make that face. You shouldn’t have started throwing sugar at me!”
The doors to the ballroom were opened and little by little, some of the guests started making their war over to dance.
Tony refuses to back down and leave, walking across the room to get his coffee. While the machine hums, preparing his drink, he desperately tried to think of a way to defuse the thick silence that had settled in the room.
Tony sighed. “Come on. you’ve been staring at my neck for the better part of the evening. And I’m up for anything, so.’’
Now Tony turned and frowned at him, trying to place the name and face, and barely suppressed his scowl when he realised where he knew the guy from.
Normally, Tony’d be there to welcome him, either with reassurance and affection or distraction, depending on what Steve needed.
Tony doesn’t think the alcohol outweighs the cons of this trip. Which is a first in a long, long time.
They stare at each other for a moment. Then, Natasha’s shoulders fall. Without a word, the doors open and Steve is pushing past her, Clint and Bruce, already on his way to Tony’s room.
, why do you keep bringing me motor oil, I swear to god, one of these days I’m gonna donate you to the nearest High-School.”
“I mean it,” Tony stresses. “You go meet up with Steve as much as you want to. We’ve been over this.”
The admission is as easy as breathing. It might not be realistic, or even fair. But Steve knows he’s done lying. He has to be, if he wants to have any chance here.
It’s an invisible thing, that can hide from Steve’s eye and it doesn’t give a shit that Tony doesn’t deserve this.
Some start calling for the Avengers, but perhaps for the first time ever, the Avengers can’t respond.
“I can’t do this anymore,” Peter whispers, then turns around and leaves. Tony just so happens to see the first tears running down his cheeks.
As Tony got the plates out of one of the cupboards, he couldn’t help but think about how scarily romantic this all seemed. The sun had already gone down at least, so they wouldn’t have to sit through the fucking
Tony’s voice still makes the warm feelings in his chest bloom. The way his long hair curls at the end, the wrinkles around his eyes, the kindness with which he handles Peter; everything has the longing in Steve’s heart grow stronger.
“Why do you keep saying that?” He can practically hear the frown in Tony’s voice. “I can’t give you the forgiveness you want. I’m not him.”
Then, Tony takes Steve’s hand in his. “Do you remember when I told you about the palladium poisoning?”
They fit right together, as if the last two years never happened. Steve responds almost instinctively, his lips part for Tony’s tongue when he licks at Steve’s lips, and it takes a few seconds too long for him to remember himself.
Because the real Tony died in the Endgame he’d tried to warn them all about. And now Steve is talking to a ghost of his own mind.
But during the fall, the uncertainty of what’s happening makes everything worse. No matter how often he screams Tony’s name, there’s only terrifying silence at the other end.
and gave in to the easy comfort Steve’s arm around his shoulders provided and snuggled a little closer to him.
Bruce flinches, and Tony remembers the hurt and confused look on his face when he’d been told that the Avengers had broken up. The knowledge that this team had probably been his only safety net almost makes Tony reconsider. Almost.
It doesn’t mean anything, really, he’s done workshop marathons more often than he was able to count. But now, Peter depends on him. The longer he takes, the longer Peter will be -
Clint stood up from his chair and walked past Tony, holding his hand out to Natasha in a flourish. “Could a woman be persuaded to let me take her to the dance?”
Steve made lasagna. When Tony resurfaced from the workshop a few hours later, still feeling a bit embarrassed by himself, a delicious smell was floating through the cabin.
Steve feels strangely nostalgic. His mind involuntarily wanders back to a year ago, when the Accords were looming but still far enough away to grant the team a relaxed evening together.
Natasha sighs. “We have bigger problems than him. We can deal with that when we’ve dealt with Thanos.”
The doctor just nods. For all that Tony’s reassured Steve that he’s one of the best in America, his mask of professionalism gives nothing away.
And Steve hates it, that Tony thinks he’s come here only for sex, hates that Tony wouldn’t even be talking to him if he was sober.
Tony missed him, he missed him too much, and now he’s paying the price, fraying the tentative bond that Steve initiated after Tony’d landed in Wakanda.
“We know this is hard on you.” Natasha hesitates, as if measuring her next words carefully. “But Tony is - ”
Tony barely looks at the woman, never mind giving her a chance to reply. He simply slides a hand onto Steve’s arm and drags him away.
Seconds later, Peter shuffles in through the door and falls onto the chair opposite Tony. In lieu of saying anything he grabs one of the bread rolls off of Tony’s plate and begins to rip it to pieces and put them in his mouth.
If he did, everything would come rushing back. Last night as well as the years they’d had together before the Accords blew it all to hell.
He wraps his arm around Peter, lets him lean on his chest and Strange immediately leaves through a portal that lets him see burning trees on the other side.
It feels like all the arguments they had at the beginning of their relationship, when Tony hadn’t trusted him that much yet, and when Steve hadn’t known how to handle Tony’s bad days.
(He still hears his mother screaming. He still feels Barnes’ face beneath his fists. He still sees Steve hovering above him, his shield raised.)
Steve bites his lip and stares at the floor. Dodger licks his hand and whines again, this time merely reacting to Steve’s distress.
Peter stares at him, a myriad of emotions crossing his face. In between shock, sadness and anger, the betrayal there, that look so much like Tony’s did, hurt the most.
Still, he’d fought in a world war, for God’s sake, and had stared into the face of many extraterrestrial threats since then. So, really, he didn’t have an excuse.
“Follow me!” Shuri appears on the other end of the room and Steve’s knees almost crash with how fast they’re moving forward again, hurrying down a hallway until Shuri takes a turn and orders Thor to lay Tony down on a metal stretcher.
Settling it by himself is the least he can do for the team; a team that’s just barely managing to work together again.
The next time Peter’s away for the weekend, Pepper refuses to let him enter any office buildings. Apparently, hiding from his problems by drowning himself in work was “unhealthy”. (Tony just retreats to his workshop instead, feeling quite proud of himself.)
“You have a workshop here,” Steve responded, and Tony had to give him credit for not even making it sound like a question.
Then, Colonel James Rhodes barges through the door like he’s on a mission to conquer the kitchen from Steve’s evil hands.
So he carries on, Tony’s plea in his ears, and holds Peter when he breaks down on the other side of the door.
“I always hated the holidays as a kid.” Tony fought against the tightness in his throat. He hadn’t really thought about how Christmas used to be ever since December 16th 1991. “Howard didn’t...” He shook his head, restarted the sentence. “We didn’t really celebrate. As a family, I mean. My father would drag us to a few important galas, ceremonies... but that was it, really. He didn’t like it very much whenever Jarvis tried to give me a normal Christmas.”
And as soon as he steps through the door, he knows he wouldn’t rather be anywhere else. Peter immediately comes running down the stairs, wearing an oversized sweater that was already covered in flour.
losing his cool like that in a room full of diplomats who were already on edge was not a good idea, he couldn't just let them treat Tony like that.
As he was sitting there, staring at the screen and trying not to think about his mother, time stretched on and slowly crawled into the wee hours of the mornings.
He’s almost ashamed to admit it to Clint and Natasha, but he thanks them anyway. Neither of them is harsh to him about it; they simply tell him they’re glad it did him some good.
Tony chuckles dryly. “See, that’s where you’re wrong. I already had one, it’s just coming back for a bonus round.”
His therapist says it’s due to his mind being used to war, to being alert all the time. Even though Steve’s never bothered to tell her, he knows she’s got it wrong. He has a lot of issues, but the soldier in him usually solidifies in sudden triggers that make him flinch, or plain and simple nightmares.
The reply was perfectly polite, but it wasn’t hard to tell that Steve wasn’t in the mood for small talk.
When Tony asked him on a date, he was terrified. Except for some awkward arrangements Bucky had made, he’d never been on a proper date. He had no idea what the rules were, if he even was allowed to touch Tony.
They’re sitting in the common area, the TV is playing lowly in the background, but most of them are staring out of the window anyway.
Steve hesitated, but the promise of warmth eventually won over whatever war was going on in his head, and he nodded.
Steve swallows against the bile in his throat. As long as the metal is still in there, he doesn't have to worry about the bleeding. It’ll be fine, at least until medical gets to them.
The sheets are plain white, the hospital bed a pale grey. There’s a monitor above Tony’s head, displaying heart rate, blood pressure, and lots of other data Steve doesn't understand. Tony has an IV in his arm and a tube down his throat, and there’s way more cables and equipment attached to Tony’s body than Steve would ever know what to do with. It’s as if Steve’s husband is gone, and a pale, helpless version of him is now lying in this bed, so dangerously close to the edge.
A few days later, Tony surprised all of them with tickets to a baseball game. Steve was a little apprehensive at first - he’d never quite been able to accept the Dodgers moving to LA - but he could tell Tony and the rest of the team were looking forward to it. Also, he supposed this was exactly what this was all about - building a life for himself in the now, instead of desperately holding on to the past.
“Drink?” Rhodes supplies sharply. “Yes. More than I’ve ever seen him drink in the last year. Care to explain?”
It almost seems like he’s just sleeping peacefully. But his face is still so, so pale, and Steve knows that if he were to lift up the shirt just an inch he’d see bandages.
It was the second week of December; northern states like Mishigan were already covered in beautiful, pristine white snow. In the midst of New York though, all they got was a wet, squishy mud that probably would’ve resembled snow if not for all the filth of the city. It was disgusting, quite frankly. And if that wasn’t enough, the day of his mother’s death was approaching far too quickly.
In his bedroom, the sheets still smell like Tony, and here, the stone meets his despair with cold silence.
“So, do tell,” an elderly woman drawls. “Are you guys really going to work together again? I imagine it’s hard after getting betrayed like that.”
Nebula insisted; some bullshit about how Strange has given up the stone for him, so obviously he must be an essential part in killing the Mad Titan.
He knows it’d probably be better for him to get to work, and distract himself, but his hands won’t really move towards it.
Peter knows what he’d say to Tony, Steve thinks dully, and hates the fact that there’s so much they still haven’t told each other that he can’t even pick one.
Also, the power would take another day to be fixed and Steve had used his best pleading puppy eyes on Tony.
He didn't quite know how he ended up here, on this airport, which one of his decisions had been the definitive one, but it all felt inconsequential anyway.
Instead, he draws and paints, he takes care of his dog and reads up on seventy years worth of books he’s missed.
Steve did insist on bringing Tony to his bedroom, which he absolutely had no problem with. He’d missed Steve. He’d missed having someone next to him when he went to bed.
Steve averted his eyes biting his lip. Tony frowned; yeah sure, it wasn't exactly common curtesy to just kiss people while they were asleep, but why was he looking so uncom-
The first time Peter spends the day with Steve and the others, Tony drives him there because he can tell how nervous Peter is, and proceeds to spend the rest of the day feeling like complete and utter shit, while trying not to think about the people he used to love and trust making Peter laugh. It gets so bad that Rhodey has him sitting down on the couch and do breathing exercises.
it provides. In the training hall, he doesn't have to think about the big, black hole of grief that’s threatening to swallow him whole.
Tony sighs, cursing his son who’s too smart for his own good. “It was just a disagreement, kid. We didn’t fight.”
Tony was about to protest - talking about it right then and there seemed like a terrific idea - but he felt tiredness pulling at his bones, and Steve was the heavy, sure presence beside him that he’d missed for so long.
Before the Accords, Tony had managed to quit for over three years. Steve knows that all fell away after Siberia, but he’d hoped...
It took a few moments for Tony to realize that neither of them had verbally acknowledged the other’s presence. Tony because he was too busy admiring the goods, and Steve because he was now moving towards the treadmills.
In contrast, once he’d inhaled his first coffee and started to get aware to his surroundings, he saw Steve sitting on the table, looking utterly miserable.
Their first kiss after Siberia is years later, after they’ve kicked Thanos’ ass and reversed The Snap. After Tony started to heal from the horrible emptiness the events on Titan had left him with.
“Ssh.” Steve laid a hand on his shoulder and shushed him, but that couldn't calm Tony’s racing heart.
He wants to reach out to Tony know, like he should’ve done all those years ago, but he knows his fingers will pass right through Tony’s skin like air.
Tony's entire brain screeched to a halt when he saw Steve lick his lips and felt him angle his hips away from where they'd been perfectly aligned with Tony's.
Steve handles him gently, looks into his eyes for confirmation before removing his clothes, kisses him all the way through prep, runs a soothing hand along Tony’s side.
He’s alone. More so than he’s ever been in his entire life, save from being frozen in the Arctic sea. He’s alone in this room, with no-one except the clock keeping him company. And he’s alone in his heart. The place where usually Tony’s presence is, as sure and sturdy as his shield, is empty.
He should probably listen to her, he knows that. But the prospect of Tony… not being there for him anymore is too foreign, too
As soon as he sees fit, Steve dismisses his new team (if one could even call it a team) and goes after Tony.
(Sometimes he wonders if programming her to be sassy was a good idea. Then he remembers, at the time he thought he needed someone like that - to make sure he would be stopped when self-destructing too much. A horribly inconvenient conclusion, really.)
Steve thinks of how Tony was pushed into alcohol, was strong enough to quit anyhow, and is still paying for it, decades later, and he wants to punch someone.
Suddenly, Steve’s glad for Rhodey, Scott and Thor, because Tony would never call for help on his own.
Tony had never told anyone, not even Pepper, and by now the memories had a dark feel to it, as though someone had laid a filter on them, made them seem like a horrible, alternate reality instead of something that’d only happened a year ago.
“I think,” he begins, voice laden with significance, “that we’re all in agreement here to not give up this fight.”
Steve’s side of the phone remains silent for so long that Tony is starting to accept the fact that Steve probably caught up with what he was really saying.
It sucked, plainly spoken. To have the possibility of Steve returning his feelings right before his eyes, without anything that he could do about it.
Peter snorts, but it’s a cold, horrible thing. “So what? It only counts as fighting if you beat each other up?”
Fury raised his eyebrows. “Do you want to come here every day for training? ‘Cause that’s what this is gonna be like if you insist on being difficult.“
“If you’re really in there…” Steve pauses, tries not to think about what Tony is going through, because of
“I miss you.” It escapes his mouth unbidden, and he flinches in response, tries to backpedal as quickly as possible.
Tony says nothing, because there’s no use in lying now. There’s no way they’ll both come back from this.
Tony allows himself one more worried glance at his son, then hurries out of the room, collecting water bottles and tea, some wet towels and a thermometer.
Tony stares at him, and that’s when Steve suddenly gets up from his chair, makes a step towards Tony and takes both of his calloused hands in his.
And Tony might be dying, or he might not be, depending on how much his heart can still take, and there’s no way anyone could predict that.
They go about their day and Tony takes medication for his blood pressure and his heart, and Steve is even more strict about a decent sleeping schedule, but they don’t talk about it.
“Everyone attack and push Thanos’ army away from the woods,” he tells into the comms. “We can’t let them get the advantage.”
“I’m aware.” Steve sighs. It all seemed so easy on his way here; all he wanted was to make sure Tony wouldn’t need to be alone. And now, he doesn’t know what to say. As seems to be norm around Tony these days.
It shouldn’t bother Steve, especially because he spent two years without even so much as a word to Tony. But it kind of does anyway, and he can’t help it.
The sad and ugly truth is, he’s right. This decision is his to make, and his alone. Since the doctors don’t have a written statement from Tony, the decision on life-support goes to his next of kin, which is, since Tony doesn't have any living relatives, Steve.
They’re in good spirits when they get back home, Tony’s skipping up the stairs with a happy look on his face and Steve allows it because he can’t bring himself to deny Tony on his birthday.
Meanwhile, Steve had already jumped into action. When Tony looked up from his phone, he’d already dumped an array of blankets onto the couch in front of the fireplace.
Nebula practically pushes him out of the plane when he hesitates, and the force is enough for him to stumble and fall on his knees.
The whole building is already open and swarming with doctors as well as patients. It is chaotic, and Steve’s never really been here save from getting checked for injuries after the first battle.
Steve’s been at this point way too often. And he knows Shuri wouldn’t ask them to leave unless the circumstances are critical enough to demand it.
Steve’s heart lurches; his stomach rebels against the horrifying images that sound produces in his mind. As he’s calling for MedEvac, his eyes never waver from the red and gold heap of scraps on the ground.
“You were right,” Steve said. By now, they’d migrated to the couch in front of the fireplace, and covered in blankets as he was, Steve looked nothing short of adorable.
Steve looks up abruptly. “No! I mean, he initiated it, but I know that I shouldn’t have let it happen anyhow. He was drunk.”
“Exactly.” And, wow, there was real sadness in Steve’s voice. “I always miss you when you’re not there.”
He never thought he’d regret his choice regarding the Accords, and he still doesn’t, but there’s so much he regrets not telling Tony.
“It’s a telescope,” Tony said quickly, before Steve could even ask. “I thought you’d like to see how Brooklyn’s changed.”
want the evening to be over already, but he also didn't want Tony to think that he was only here for
Steve presses Tony into the sheets underneath him, and Tony goes willingly, yields to Steve’s touch with so much self-evidence it makes his heart clench.
The main doors opened to a large living space with an open kitchen and a fireplace under the TV. On the other side, a wide spiral staircase led to the upper floor. Everything was flooded with light, since the first floor had ceiling-to-floor windows, framed by the thick logs that lined the walls.
Now, he looked at Tony during team meetings and yearned to warp his arms around him and bury his nose in the crook of his neck, where his scent was strongest. Sometimes he happened to stand too close to Tony and the memory of his scent would follow Steve until he was under his sheets or in the shower.
Still, Tony only really managed to relax when their table started filling up. There were things about being here with Steve that tugged at Tony’s heart, like seeing Steve’s shoulder’s hunch as he stared at the large number of patrons streaming in through the door and longing to comfort him. (But that wasn't his place anymore.)
It was just as sweet as he thought it’d be. He was about to offer Tony some of his tea, but a second later, they were interrupted by a deafening crash ripping through the air, loud enough to trump the humming of the street below them.
But still, he can’t bring himself to leave Tony alone for more than a few hours at a time. It feels like a horrible pull when they’re away from each other.
Steve just shakes his head, looking about as beat as Tony feels. “No, it’s okay. I’ll talk to Clint.”
Steve hesitates for a moment, then relaxed slightly and settles in next to Peter, who immediately snuggles into both of their arms.
“I know it’s not easy for you,“ Pepper went on, without acknowledging his deflection. “If there’s anything I can do -”
He also doesn’t need to, because in that moment, the figure of his worries enters the room with quick and erratic steps that promise no good news.
Tony looks up. He’s completely disassembled the nano-particle holder, determined to start from scratch and eradicate any possible malfunctions.
“We have to keep going until they’ve got the stones,” he tells Natasha, because he’s not thinking about the
He reaches for the thermometer on the nightstand and Peter slightly tilts his head to allow Tony to access his ear.
When they were out in the field, Steve experienced a terrifying kind of worry. He knew that every mission, every one of his orders could mean serious harm to Tony. But he couldn't let that influence any of his decisions. He had to send Tony to scout HYDRA facilities from above even if he could easily be shot at, he had to send him down to their labs even though Tony could easily be walking into a trap. And on the rare occasions where he did have the choice and tried to keep Tony out of harm’s way, the Omega did not react kindly to that.
Rhodes snorts. “Oh yeah, he’s told me alright. As much as he could, considering he was seconds away from passing out.”
She hesitated. “I know he meant a lot to you. If… if you want to come to Malibu again, let me know, okay? I’ll be there.”
Tony had already spotted a small, round stall with pink decorations all over it that made it look old-fashioned. For some reason, it looked charming to him, not silly.
Tony waves his hand dismissively. “I know how you feel about these things, but you’re here anyway. Just making sure you don’t get eaten by the sharks on my watch.”
Tony knew all too well, and he’d been the one to explain to Steve why he kept dragging the Avengers to these events. It was a lot easier for them to convince people to donate than for anyone else.
Tony’d always prided himself in his genius, but in that moment, Tony’s brain short-circuited. Before the logical side of his brain could stop him, Tony had already laid his lips on Steve’s. The kiss was light and careful, but nevertheless enough to wake Steve up.
Steve didn't want to take a break. He wanted to punch that Alpha in the face. But Tony’s tugging got more insistent, and the thought of Tony needing him was what made him get out of that headspace.
They remain like that for what feels like ages. Steve is a silent, steady presence next to him; one hand around his shoulders, the older holding Tony’s palm to his chest.
In the evening, they retreat to the exclusive hotel room Tony booked them for the night. They curl up in front of the TV with
“Don’t lie to me!” Peter shouts, almost frantically. Then, his voice lowers (almost breaks). “I know you’re not even talking to each other.”
“I made something for you,” was all he said before dragging Steve into the elevator. They went up to the highest floor and took the stairs to the roof of the tower, which they’d long ago equipped with a minibar and lounge chairs. Tony led him closer to the edge, where an easel with a canvas was standing next to what looked like a huge camera lens.
On a whim, Tony’d decided to take his old ornaments out of storage; the ones made out of stained glass, one of the few things his mother had had a real passion for. He hadn't anticipated the mixed emotions he felt as he watched his team hang them up, and he’d almost had to excuse himself for a few minutes, when -
, Steve doesn’t want to leave Tony either. But he has to be the adult, the responsible one, and he’s been in this job for way too long.
Now that Tony’s unconscious, it seems like the words that were once so hard to come by have always been right in from of him.
Tony sighs, and for all it’s worth, it sounds tired. “I’ve always had a weak heart, Steve. I didn’t think it was this serious.”
“However,” Strange cuts in sternly. “His head wasn’t sufficiently protected against the blast, so right now we’re dealing with severe swelling in his brain. There’s nothing we can do except hope it’ll go down in the next 48 hours.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Tony says, but Steve can tell that it does. Perhaps more so than anything else.
“Go to sleep, Tony,” he says softly. “We don’t have any leads yet. There will still be time to finish your suit after you’ve rested.”
Tony swallowed, told himself not to stare, and did it anyway. Honestly, it was a ritual at this point. And who could blame him, really, with how well-defined and smooth Steve’s muscles were. (His feelings were just a small factor in it all. It wasn’t like that counted. Or that, at least, was what Tony told himself.)
“The past five years have been the happiest of my life, and I’m so glad we got to have a second chance.”
(They didn’t have the time to figure out something less risky, but Tony can practically see the pile of guilt growing in his chest.)
Since he’d used this cabin as a strategic retreat during Christmas for almost five years now, the only thing he’d needed to do was have supplies shipped to the cabin and he was good to go.
Thankfully, he had no trouble finding a dance partner. Before he’d even crossed the dining room hall, a young woman caught him by the arm and brazenly asked him to a dance.
Clint didn’t notice Natasha smiling at Steve but Steve knew she realised the effort he was making. Ever since he’d gotten back from Zemo’s caste, he found more and more things, in every aspect of his life, that he had yet to catch up on. He’d tried to search for which movie’s he’d missed on the internet, but the search results had been so overwhelming that he’d given up on making a list pretty quickly.
Tony didn’t bring up his promise for the next few days. Long enough that Steve was beginning to think he wasn’t taking this whole thing as seriously as Steve had meant it.
He tries not to look at it; the ring, the letter and the cellphone. Which is why he so rarely actually goes to their old room to sleep. Most of the time, it’s the workshop, or the couch in the living room. Sometimes, when Peter’s away for the night, Tony sleeps in his son’s room. (It’s the only occasion where he’s granted a few uninterrupted hours of sleep, and at first, just after Steve left, they’d both curl up together in Peter’s bed, but now Tony knows he needs to try to give the kid at least some level of normalcy.)
Their communicators have long been rendered useless, and they’ve got pretty everything else in their plan failing as well.
about this, but he can’t. The words have been locked in his throat for so long. “When I left, I... I’ve never stopped caring about you.”
Peter stares at him for a second longer, then all he anger seems to bleed out of him and his shoulders slump.
When he steps into the loud frenzy of a few dozen high schoolers and their parents, it takes him a while to find Peter and Tony. Tony hasn’t bothered to put on a disguise; he’s wearing sunglasses and a undoubtedly expensive suit, looking just as proud as Steve feels, who has a baseball cap covering his face. (He doesn’t know what would happen if people recognized him here, and this is about Peter, anyway.)
The fact that that actually is a reason to believe Tony was still relatively in control of himself probably should worry Steve more than it does; as it is, he’s just glad Tony isn’t already past that stage.
“Uh, seems like I just… started something,” Peter babbled, crawling away from them slowly. “I think I’m gonna go and try to stop Rhino for blowing up the city but I’m just one guy so… if you could hurry up with resolving this, that’d be great.”
In retrospect, Steve probably should’ve been a bit clearer in his request. It was just that he’d never asked someone out on a date and had that person actually, genuinely say yes, so this was a bit nerve wracking.
The nickname made his heart flutter. It seemed like, wherever Tony Stark was concerned, Steve was reduced to a helpless mess.
Steve sighs and lowers his head. “Yes. I know I probably got the good side out of all of this. I know I shouldn’t have left you like that. It was just -”
Tony’s face softened and stepped towards Steve to take his hand. “Hey, that’s okay. There’s no rulebook here. You’re enough.’’
However, that feeling faded when Steve reminded him of the fact that they’d have to walk back, and the wind abruptly started to pick up.
At least, that was what it felt like. In reality, he was sitting on the couch in the communal living room, fighting with the urge to give in to drinking. When Steve sat down next to him, Tony was staring longingly at the liquor cupboard in the kitchen.
Hammer stood up straighter. “See, I have plans for some sound suppressors Hammer Industries is currently lacking the funds for, but -”
Tony sighs, exasperated. (Just like he used to.) “I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we have a giant purple dickhead to kill. The sooner I get that suit to work the better.”
Finally, Tony smiles a crooked smile and says, “Well, I guess that’s the last gift my father’s giving me.”
“Tony, what’s going on?” Steve urges, because he needs to know what happened, now, or he won’t be able to help.
him to. Even so, the suit is dented and even partially torn off. Steve fumbles for the emergency release hatch and the suit falls away from Tony’s body, save for a part that’s stuck in his upper leg.
“That’s what the media called it.” Tony sighs. “It’s stupid, if you ask me. Wasn’t so much of a civil war than a personal little dispute between Cap and me.”
(But they still haven’t heard from Tony or Thor or Nebula - at this point it’s likely that their communicators are being blocked somehow, and Rhodey is unresponsive -)
(There’s so much clawing against the walls in his head, demanding to be let out, but he’s cried enough about all of this already. Peter needs him; he’s got to stop being a burden and start being a parent again.)
He tries to get back to finishing his suit, but his hands won’t stop shaking and his head won’t stop replaying his conversation with the Captain.
They didn’t wait for Tony to join them - when he was on a workshop binge, it sometimes took hours for him to lay down his work and come upstairs. And as much as Steve would’ve loved to have movie night in the workshop instead, the machinery down there wasn’t exactly Thor or Hulk friendly.
Steve frowned. It wasn’t like he was looking forward to living in the cramped SHIELD headquarters, but forcing Stark to take in a bunch of Alpha’s be barely knew seemed sketchy at the very least.
It’s bad enough that he got tipsy and had sex with Steve, Tony thinks as Washington disappears behind them. But the morning after, had to get completely wasted and start crying in front of him, all because he couldn’t handle the thought that Steve regretted him.
It’s dark and dusty when Steve walks into the lab. Everything is exactly how Tony left it; he was in the middle of upgrading Clint’s arrows when they were called out on that mission, and everything is still sprawled out on his workspace as if he’s been gone for a few hours rather than months.
As soon as the glass is set down in front of them, Steve grips it with both hands, as if he doesn’t know what to do with them.
“I...” He searches for the words to describe what he’s failed to justify to himself, and comes up with nothing. “Hasn’t Tony told you?”
“It wasn’t like ours, at least,” Tony adds quietly, with a wry twist to his mouth that makes Steve’s stomach turn.
Steve clenches his jaw. He’s seldom let himself hate people on principle, but in Ross he sees everything that tore his team apart.
The rest of the team wasn’t exactly impressed they were leaving for Christmas, but as soon as Clint made he first joke about what they’d get up to during that week all alone by themselves, their disappointment soon turned into teasing.
Peter’s hands clutch the bread so tightly a few crumbs fall onto the kitchen table. “You better,” he mumbles quietly.
Tony, in fact, did not get a black coffee but something that sounded disgustingly sweet, while Steve opted to go for black tea.
Steve blinked. The elevator doors had just opened on Tony’s floor and had to admit that yes, he had planned to leave it at that.
Tony tries to smile reassuringly, but doubts that he’s doing that much of a good job, considering how out of his depth he’s feeling at doing this alone.
He’d been nervous then too, but since he’d never been alone, it wasn’t as bad. Now though? Tony probably won’t even rescue him out of any awkward situations. It basically feels like preparing for his own execution.
So yeah, Peter doesn’t suffer as much because of their fight anymore, so it’s definitely getting better.
Well; it wasn’t like there was any use denying it, but Tony’s mouth was faster than him once more. “It’s cold.”
He shudders involuntarily. There’s no real threat in the kid’s eyes, but there’s heartbreak and anger and love for someone who’s slipping away from him.
“But fighting you...” Steve concentrates on the smooth feeling of Dodger’s fur beneath his fingers. “It was the hardest thing I ever did.”
“So what?” Tony meant to snap, but instead it just comes out tired. “I need to repair the suit, Bruce. I barely got him to bleed last time, and I can’t... I
Steve feels a horrible lump build in his throat. Tony hadn’t been going to therapy that long when Ross had presented them with the Accords. Steve had been so proud of him then, for finally working on his mental health. And then, just a few months later, they’d ripped everything between them apart.
He heard Steve approach in the hallway and wiggled out of the covers, sitting up properly. Steve still had that hesitant, hopeful smile on his face. In his hands, he held the sketchbook Tony’d gotten him for Christmas last year. (Before Steve’d given him the dog tags.)
Tony’d never been good at that kind of order. And sitting there, in his own bed, after what was probably the worst love confession of his life (and he had quite a few disastrous ones to choose from), waiting for Steve to come back. (Where had he even disappeared to, anyway?)
But Tony shakes his head with such an empty look in his eyes that Steve feels like he’s at a complete loss.
He’s abandoned some of his old ideas here, some of which were just tinkering, some real weapons he’d meant to include in his suit.
He and Tony communicate more often now. Whenever Tony is away on business trips, Steve takes care of Peter. Sometimes he even picks him up from school to get lunch, and calls ahead to let Tony know. Whenever Peter is particularly proud of something he’s built, he’ll drag Steve into the workshop and show him, without worrying about his parents seeing each other.
They actually don’t have a plan on how exactly to bring back those billions of lives - they only know that the soul stone inside the gauntlet is their best shot, and whoever was closest to it would have the responsibility to try. So, Steve doesn’t know what he’s doing, and even worse, the second the gold metal slides onto his right hand, he knows that the stones are powerful enough to get even the strongest of minds to crumble and bend.
Which was totally the reason for what he did next. And not the fact that having Steve all to himself in his remote cabin sounded like everything he’d ever wished for at night as a teenager.
“It’s called arteriosclerosis,” the doctor explains. “It can be a late effect of excessive alcohol consumption.”
It’s the middle of the night, and they’re on their way to bed, when Tony stops dead in his tracks and folds over.
Steve’s voice went quiet, so much Tony almost missed his next words. “I haven’t been out in the snow like that since the ice. I’ve never wanted to, even.”
In bed, with Steve’s arm wrapped around him and the certainty that all their words were too little too late.
The urge to go downstairs and check on Tony himself is stronger than ever now, but he knows that he’s right where he needs to be. Seeing him wouldn’t do Tony any good, but Peter clearly needs him now.
“We agreed that for most of us it would be counterproductive to go back to America, but if you and Rhodey wanted to -“
When he walked into their communal kitchen a few days later, he was holding on so tightly to his resolve of not backing out that he must’ve looked as though he was preparing to march into battle.
Steve adores it, really; the chances of Tony getting to live that long were astronomically small, and yet, he’s right by Steve’s side, every day. It’s proof that his life has finally taken a turn for the better.
Which is his right. He should be able to be with his father. And Steve deserves to see his son, too. Tony’s told Peter as much.
Eventually, there’s a knock on the door. Steve keeps his gaze fixed on Tony, but out of the corner of his eyes, he sees the team silently fill the room, followed by Pepper, Rhodey and Helen Cho.
Some part of Tony thought he should probably do a 180 and leave before Steve said something that he’d be even more embarrassed about later, but he couldn’t. His own curiosity was keeping Tony in place.
Steve turned from where he’d taken the lasagna out of the oven and raised an eyebrow. “You haven’t even tried it."
(Steve’s been his boyfriend for too long for Tony work himself into a frenzy over minor things, so, being Tony Stark, he does it anyway.)
It’s not like Steve hasn’t apologized already; the letter proves otherwise. But it’s different to hear it from him in person after they held their son through twelve hours of fever.
Tony let him, for a while. After all, he was hungry, and he couldn’t exactly force Steve to cuddle with him.
He’d considered shutting Hammer down right then and there - there wasn't anything good that would come out of this, that much was obvious - but part of him was curious just how much of a bad idea would follow this. (And it was a distraction against the persistent worry about -)
“Copy that,” Bucky says and Steve’s legs almost give out in relief. “As long as you tell us the whole story later.”
“That’s right,” Steve murmurs soothingly. “But we brought you all back. You’re in Wakanda now, it’s all going to be okay.”
Tony barely noticed time passing as their care made its way through the congested streets of New York. The city was still lit brightly by the Christmas lights, and they bathed Steve’s face in a warm, golden glow.
“Hey, at least I’m faster than you!” Tony called, and found, to his own surprise, that he was grinning like an idiot.
Thor shoots go higher into the air, and Nebula jumps towards Thanos so rapidly, he has to follow her with his eyes and turn his back to Thor. She dodged his fist and jumps, knife steady in her hand, but Thanks whirls around, grabs her right out of the air and throws her a good few feet.
“Just sit tight,” he says, and if his eyes are watering again, well, so be it. “Papa’s going to be here soon.”
Who was very obviously not drugged anymore. His hands were clasped in front of his chest and his eyes were studying the floor intensely.
Steve used to assume he’s good with kids, but now, with this particular kid, he feels way out of his head.
Their first dance, at a gala like this one. Steve clumsy and nervous, Tony with a small smile and flushed cheeks.
She was looking at him openly, patiently, even though she’d asked him that exact same question twelve months ago.
Too fast for Steve even, who’s standing right there when Tony comes crashing to the ground, falling from almost a thousand feet up in the air.
The whole left half of Tony’s suit has been ripped off, and there’s blood all over what’s left of it. Tony’s fave is pale and unmoving.
(Also, the weight of the housing case for his new suit’s nano-particles is reassuring enough for him to maintain his composure.)
Slowly, the alcohol entering his system does its trick. Tony feels it settle warm in his stomach, feels it travel through his body, make his limbs lighter and his head disconnect from his body.
At first, he stands in the entrance hall of the Compound, not quite sure where to start searching. Then, he remembers that The Snap occurred during midday in Wakanda, meaning late morning in Washington.
Steve takes a deep breath. He’s no stranger to Tony’s insecurities, but knowing that this time, they’re his fault...
Steve swallows. Tony’s right, there is no denying it. “I always loved you,” is what he says instead. “Even when we fought.”
Tony’s still preparing the pasta when he arrives, so he starts to set the table for the three of them. With a bolt of worry he notices that Tony has a few bottles of liquor in the fridge.
Tony was the center of his life long before the crash, he is now, and he will be for as long as Steve can help it.
A smile spreads on Tony’s face, almost on its own accord. He tries to leave his chair, but his shaking knees give out on him, and he falls right into Steve’s arms, whispering his
Steve flinches like Tony slapped him, and yeah, Tony definitely still feels the tug in his heart whenever Steve looks like that.
I didn’t seem like something that would ever happen to him, Steve Rogers, the slim, sickly boy from Brooklyn that was barely able to talk to a dame.
She droned on about her studies at Yale, and Tony made sounds of agreement whenever he felt like he’d been silent for too long. His feet moved across the dance floor almost on their own accord; his feet followed the waltz with sheer muscle memory alone.
“See?” He heard Hammer’s voice, which was way too eager for someone facing an angry Steve Rogers. “He’s fine.”
He was grateful to have his teammates at the tower for Christmas, but now, every silence was heavy, laden with tension and the obvious elephant in the room nobody had wanted to mention.
“As soon as I turned around back then, I wanted to run back to you,” Steve whispers. “I knew I was making a mistake. But I couldn’t face you either, not after what I did.”
Peter pulls back to look down at where the reindeer on the fabric has gained some dusty white spots.
, Tony thought. Of course someone as good and generous as Steve was would appreciate it. Tony wouldn’t even have ever guessed that Steve didn’t like Christmas in the first place; it seemed like something that just was a part of the American picket-fence dream.
Rhodey gently nudged him out of his thoughts. Tony came to with the whole room staring at him expectantly.
He’d intended to ask Tony for recommendations, but he’d barely seen him since they got back a few days ago.
“I’m sorry, Steve” is the only thing Bruce says. His voice is wobbling, Steve realises. Out of all of his teammates, this is hitting Bruce the hardest.
He’s terrified, and he misses Steve so much it feels like there shouldn’t be any more room in his heart for the loneliness.
Peter is blearily blinking up at him, and Tony’s not sure his son’s recognizing him until he speaks.
Tony turned to look at him, slowly. “Excuse me? You’ve never heard of everyone’s favorite Christmas-hating green goblin?”
Steve takes Tony’s hand, like he’s done a hundred times and more since that fateful day, but it’s different this time. He doesn't even know who he’s trying to comfort.
“He wants to, believe me,” Tony says shortly. “But you know him. He’s never going to agree to his if he thinks he’s hurting... if he thinks we’re not okay with it.”
“My turn!” Steve heard Clint yelling. He was trying to wrestle the remote away from Natasha, without much luck.
Steve was staring at him. He’d always been staring at him. First with longing, then with joy, and recently with sadness.
He was right, Steve realised. But that didn't change anything. It wasn’t like someone like Tony would ever want him back.
When Tony walked into the workshop a few hours later, he could feel exhaustion pulling at his bones.
They were walking through the narrow streets pressed against each other by the shoulders, their fingers lightly entwined. Some of the stalls were producing the sweet smell of waffles, cookies or mulled wine, others had cheery music play loud enough for everyone to hear, and then there were those with handcrafted goods. Everyone was wrapped in thick winter’s clothing against the snow still falling from the sky, and although it was just midday, the market was quite busy.
The whole conversation feels like threading through thick mud, but eventually, they decide that Peter would meet with Steve every second weekend, if possible. And if Peter wanted to, of course.
The world’s most effective nano-technology based short-range rockets though, that’s what he does have.
Tony supposed Steve’s cluelessness really wasn’t that much of a surprise, considering how many years of pop culture he was missing, and felt a little bad for forgetting the fact. “Don’t worry, it’s a good movie. Or so I’m told.”
“Well, I thought it could… help, to see that the sky and the stars are still the same.” Tony’s legs were shifting restlessly, Steve noted.
“No, really,” Steve pressed. “Back in the war, we didn’t... we didn’t have these kinds of opportunities. The most exciting thing we ever did was go sledding in the parks. And we didn’t even have real sleighs.”
Dummy comes back, clutching a broom firmly in his claw. Then he starts to mop the broken pieces into a pile.
Tony held up a hand to silence him. “Hold up right there. Are you seriously asking me to fund your weapons project?
Feeling like his body somehow detached itself from his brain, he sits up. There’s no dizziness or pain, so he leaves his bed and kind of aimlessly wanders around the laboratory, until a young woman takes notice of him.
He sits there and cries, and he knows that at least Tony’s not in pain anymore, but it doesn’t seem to make a difference.
It takes a few minutes for him to find his way around, but after that, he’s completely immersed in his work. At the back of his mind, he cant ever forget that this new version of his suit has to be better, that much better than anything else he’s ever created.
suit of course, the one that makes him Captain America, but the fancy, uniquely tailored ones Tony used to buy him for every event he dragged him to.
“I’m not mad about your opinion on the Accords. We were both caught up in different circumstances, that’s not it.” Tony’s voice hardened again, into the kind of steel he always used in difficult conversations.
It’s working, too. Or, at least he’s going on his morning runs again, he’s picked up drawing and he only returns to the cemetery every other week. He smiles, now and then, but his heart still feels empty and cold because of how big a part of it is missing.
It’s mostly silent. Tony doesn’t want to risk the tentative peace between him and Steve, especially not with Peter right between them. (He also doesn’t want to burst the bubble he’s in himself; enjoy these few hours of being a normal family.)
It’s Steve’s last chance to, and suddenly it seems like he can never say it enough, even if he would be to stand there and repeat it over and over for the rest of his life.
A few seconds later, he was following Steve down the mountain. Laying face-down on the cardboard, he picked up speed a lot fast than Steve did and caught up with him effortlessly.
“You’re drunk,” Steve realizes, deliberately going over his comment on Howard. (He doubts Tony would appreciate a conversation about his father right now.)
Tony had helped Bruce cook and made sure to set the table so that he would sit as far away from Steve as physically possible, but he could still feel Steve’s eyes on him every once in a while. And whenever Tony thought Steve wasn't looking, he caught his own seeking out soft blonde hair on the other end of the table.
Steve doesn’t call him out on it though. They finish the snowman and Steve makes him some hot chocolate while Peter looks at him with hurt in his eyes.
Steve knows he’s not even close to begin to comprehend what Peter’s death cost Tony. He doesn’t even comprehend what exactly Peter meant to Tony.
Tony grips the phone tighter and tries to steel himself. “He’s sick. Like, really sick, and he’s asking for you. I know you’ve probably got other things to do but he’s still your son and I’ll-”
There was a slight flush to Tony’s cheeks, and he was looking at him with such hope and joy in his eyes that Steve felt his chest go tight.
Tony smiled at his ridiculous grin and vowed to himself that he’d find Steve a present as well. It was Christmas after all.
But there’s nobody there to stop him anymore, except for Peter, and Tony knows he can’t put that on him, so he permanently restricted his access to the lab.
Tickets to the Smithsonian, from when Tony took him and then laughed at Steve’s shocked expressions upon seeing that his old drawings were on display there.
Which worked, for about half an hour, and then Clint came barging in with strings of tinsel wrapped around his neck.
“I know buddy,” Tony soothes. “But you’re running a fever, so we’re gonna have to check your temperature and try to get that down a little, yeah?”
Now, there’s only Tony’s comatose body in the MedBay, and for a fleeting moment, Steve wonders if this can even be called living.
He’s sitting on his and Steve’s bed, with his drawer open, the envelope in his hand and Steve’s ring in his peripheral vision.
Steve knows what his old friend is trying to do, but finds it hard to care. He’s right, after all, and Steve made a promise.
When the weather is decent, the first rays of sun fall into their bedroom every morning and paint the room in a beautiful, warm light.
Steve watches Tony leave, even though the worry in his chest tells him to follow. Even when they disagreed during their times on the Avengers, Tony never left meetings like that.
He looks better, with the blood and the dust off his face and in normal clothes, even though his eyes are red-rimmed.
“Don’t get smart with me,” Tony warns her. “You didn’t have sex with someone who probably hates you now.”
Maybe he shouldn't have left Steve by himself. They’d broken up, sure, but they were still friends, and it wasn't Steve’s fault Tony couldn't handle being close to him. The guy was probably being cornered by at least a dozen guests right now. Shit.
“I better keep those two from ruining that poor guy’s cart,” Tony mumbled, taking his wallet out of his pocket and hurrying to catch up with the other three.
Steve follows his glance to where Peter is slumped in his seat. “Oh that, that’s Peter, he’s with Tony. Kind of.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “You don’t have to go to all these things either. We do that all year round, take a break.”
He doesn’t really know how to feel about the last name. The bitterness Siberia has left in him is still as cold as it was back then. And, as it is, there’s too much pain inside his mind to be feeling anything else.
“What I don't understand,” Thor said, frowning slightly, “is why you would not make enough for a true feast.”
He didn't know what he was supposed to do as the Alpha here, but Tony had never fit into any expectations anyway.
But still, he can’t help but wish for Tony’s company. He can’t help but dwell in their old memories. Memories of Tony’s smooth skin under his fingers, his soft moans, the way he melted under Steve’s touches. He’s always found Tony exceptionally beautiful, but in these moments, whenever they made love, he almost seemed divine to him.
They have nurses going in and out of the tower on a daily basis. They check on the machines keeping Tony alive and give him medicine through injections, but that’s where Steve draws the line. He learns how to feed Tony through the tube, how to change IV’s. He washes Tony every morning, changes his clothes and has an eye on his vitals every moment of the day.
“Steve and I were training. I felt exhausted and dizzy, and then suddenly I couldn’t breathe and legs just gave out on me.”
They spend the day in New York. Tony insists they take a look at the MoMA while they’re at it, even though Steve knows he finds it boring. Afterward, they take a little walk through a park until they eventually end up in a small, Italian restaurant in Brooklyn, where they’d been on their first first date as well.
Hammer willingly went backwards, but it wasn't like he had much choice anyway, with Steve pushing him further and further away from Tony.
It was said so quietly Tony almost missed it. He frowned, looked at Steve’s guarded face. “For what?”
He ignores the mess on the floor and walks over to the dresser. Tony mostly keeps all types of pain relievers down here, but Steve knows that’s not all there is.
Bruce sighed and looked like he was about to lecture Tony some more, but fortunately Steve chose that moment to join them. “
Tony frowned. He was sure there was something going wrong here, something he should be picking up on, but his head came up empty. By the time he’d decided he should ask Steve about it, Steve was already opening the door of a black limo for him, and the thought fled his mind.
Tony folds into himself as the sharp knife of loss once again strikes him in between the ribs, and his breath escapes him.
Unfortunately, Clint picked that day to finally decorate the communal floor of the tower, and he did so with Thor’s help. (Tony didn’t even want to think about how he’d managed to get the god to help
They’re sparring without weapons, just attacking and dodging like they’ve done every other day before.
The temperature had already dropped below 50 degrees. Tony could feel the cold where his head and shoulders were sticking out of the blanket. And if he could feel it, he could only imagine how bad it was for Steve, who’d been frozen in the Arctic ice for seventy years.
Thanos brought an army with him. They’d expected it, even prepared for it, with Natasha building an army of former SHIELD recruits, Wakandan warriors and everyone else she could get her hands on. Hell, they even found Clint and Scott.
She waited, studying him, and Tony wondered if she was waiting for him to elaborate. But the images were still too raw for him to want to try and find words for them.
“My brain probably just, froze,” Tony went on, aware of the fact that he probably sounded like a complete idiot. “So let’s just forget that happened.”
He let his hands wander over Steve’s pectorals to his belly, gliding lower and lower over twitching muscles.
His crush on Tony wasn’t obvious to Steve at first; it wormed his way into his life, and by the time he caught up to what was happening, it was already too late.
Whenever one of the nurses comes to check on Tony, they tell him to go home, to get some rest, there’s no way of knowing how long it’s going to take.
And, well, for someone who’s last seen them during the mess with Ultron, when Steve still trusted him, even after he’s made mistakes... It probably is hard to believe, Tony guesses. (And wishes it wasn’t so easy to believe for himself.)
“A lot better than I was,” Steve admitted quietly. “Everything you’ve been doing… it really helped. Thank you.”
Tony addresses FRIDAY with some colorfully worded commands, but with the suit compromised as it is, he doesn’t have the power to break free.
“Steve and I need some time apart,” Tony answers, and knows his son isn’t buying his bullshit excuse for something that runs much, much deeper, but it’s all he can give Peter right now.
