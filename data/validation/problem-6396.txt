That was what made the kiss so tricky.  It had been completely unexpected. Pepper was someone who prepared for everything, always had a plan.  There had been no plan for that. She was admittedly annoyed to find that Tony hadn't displayed any guilt or remorse.  But she was inclined to agree with Aria; Tony was sheltered and entitled and also had been raised thinking of omegas as
Again, the woman appeared in his field of vision, her mouth still moving wordlessly; Tony shoved her aside.  "STEVE!"  Why was he yelling?  If Steve was responding, he wouldn't have known, anyway.  The ringing was high and tinny and sharp; Tony's mouth was filled with blood; his mind was full of static, a combination of panic and shock.  His only coherent thought was finding Steve.
"...last year, after I got back from... overseas... I went back to a place called Gulmira... I went back to get revenge," said Tony, talking to his cup of coffee.
The questions kept coming, and he remained as calm as he could, but under the table his hand was gripping Tony's tightly and the other had curled into a fist at his side. He let out a shaky breath as he finished a question about his future plans with charity, to which he'd essentially said
Tony cringed; he couldn't turn off the accelerator now, not without losing all the momentum he'd built up, and who knew if the generators would have enough energy to power it up again?  So he carried on, watching as the particle beam, white-hot and painfully bright, slowly moved across the room as he turned the prism in its base plate, cutting a line across the concrete wall, through a support beam, rebar and all, through a metal filing cabinet, three Fender guitars, the jukebox, a shelf full of priceless retrotech, and an original Barnett Newman painting that he'd set on the floor and sworn to Pepper he wouldn't let anything happen to.  (It burst into flames.)
"The one and only," Steve assured him with gritted teeth as he lowered Nate down onto a stretcher. Ryan smelt different too. They must have done the same thing to him. Fuck.
"Oh, God, the syrup!" shrieked Pepper, who was watching the brutal murder of the white couch through her fingers.
Tony slammed his back against the wall and sank to the floor, unable to keep upright.  It was snowing lightly.  Maybe he was shivering from the cold, after all.
"Just a simulation," Steve agreed quietly, even though they both knew it wasn't quite that simple. Sure- it wasn't
And then DeSoto's Alpha was beside them, grinning like a wolf and Steve wanted to punch him. Then he wanted to haul him up by his neck and demand where Charles was and promise him the sickening and slow death he deserved.
"Also, the Walkers from the Horseshoe Society, Irshad Nazari of the World Omega Rights Council of the United Nations, and Tiberius Stone and Thomas Banksy on behalf of Status Alliance had requested meetings with Captain Rogers."
Steve stood in front of it, his hands on his hips. It was so weird to be looking at it again. The last time he'd seen it was... a very, very long time ago.
Steve took Tony's hand and stood. Although he frowned when he showed him the bruise. "Jesus Tony," he muttered and kissed his forehead. "You're still limping from the last fight. Don't start another one with yourself," he sighed and followed Tony down to the workshop, thinking he'd probably doodle some more whilst Tony worked. He liked drawing his Alpha and the way his brow knotted when he worked, he found.
me.  They were glad to get rid of me and I was happy to leave 'cause they were always shoving me around and stuff."
Ironically, "working for the army" was not what he'd expected.  They'd forced him into tights and booty shorts and shoved him onto a stage to sell bonds; it had been the most painful weeks of his life. He wasn't a performer, or at least, not the public kind. As Tony's PA he'd been in the background. It was easy. No one noticed him, because of both his workplace and biological status. Now it felt like he had a target on his forehead. In the war soldiers had stared a bit, sure, but he was their captain...they were
They asked for his story and he tried to explain but it was disjointed.  "They took my mate.  He lost a baby.  It was my fault.  I loved him, really, but I couldn't mate him, he was too sick.  I didn't want to hurt him.  But then he was mad at me.  I sent him some flowers.  They took him in a van."
"Could be a code name, could be a mutant," said Fury.  "Intelligence has some leads. For now, Rogers, you're decommissioned.  You too, Stark."
Steve squeezed his hand back gently, something fluttering in his chest. A comforting feeling...like reassurance.
One was following Jarvis as a child, watching him clipping the flowerless stem from an orchid in his father's study.  He'd been curious as to why his father, who was not bonded, would have an orchid and had assumed it was simply because it was pretty.  The second was a memory of a vase with a half-dozen white tulips sitting on a small round dining table in the middle of an unfamiliar room.
"I won't," Aria said, a small smile twitching at the edge of her lips. The act before him finished up and announced the final act for the night as Steve.
He left his collar on the bedside table and rubbed at his neck before toeing off his shoes and flopping down onto the bed. Steve hummed and closed his eyes, sun peeking through the curtains and warming his back as the light scattered across the sheets.
He leaned over to retch again, the sudden loneliness of it, the disorientation of no longer feeling Steve...
Aria watched him curiously, still tapping away at her tablet without looking. "Pepper's getting in at 11, by the way. She wants to talk to you." She looked back down at her screen, lips pressed together in a thin line.
"Anthony Edward Stark."  Pepper grabbed his sleeve and wheeling him around, fixing him with her stern, green gaze.  "I am sure that Steve is okay, and that he is not with his other Alpha, and that he's going to come home."
Natasha followed with a smile.  "...you see why we didn't think Tony needed to know about this?" she said quietly.
"I know.  That's why I made you this coffee," said Tony generously, holding out a mug.  Rhodey took it gratefully, sipped, and then cringed.
Twelve miles away, Bucky froze as well.  That was his name. Hearing Steve say it was so... grounding.  He felt like he had just woken up from a long sleep. He was groggy but awake, alive...
"I'll get it," wheezed Tony, flopping out onto the deck and scrambling toward the kitchen to grab Steve's cell phone.  He flipped it open without checking who it was. "Whaddya want?"
Steve felt head as Tom guided his hands down and around his cock. He stroked him slowly, his expression one of awe as he felt his own member twitch. He felt wet between his thighs and shivered. Steve looked up at him with dark eyes, lips parted. Suddenly the blankets around them felt too hot.
"I'm fine. Considering you don't even work for SHIELD anymore, you take up far too much of my time, Captain."  His voice was curt, the trace of a smile gone.  Nick Fury had never been one to talk much about his own feelings.
Steve hadn't stopped driving aside from three small breaks, two of them to get the cigarettes and the burner phone. He was goddamn exhausted.
Steve breathed out heavily and realised the other still had his mouth on his neck. "Does it-- does it taste okay?" he asked tentatively, suddenly a lot more with it than he had been before.
He gave his head a small shake to clear it.  “...you know what this juice needs?  Some scotch.  Sparky, get me a drink, will you?”  He made a point of slapping Steve’s ass when Steve stood up.  He didn’t believe Steve had never slept with one of his bosses before, not for a second.  Steve was gorgeous.  His muscles were perfect.  Actually, he was the most toned, muscular omega Tony had ever seen in his life.  He half-wondered if the guy was on steroids or something.  He looked like a beefalo.  Tony admired the contours of his body; Steve’s muscles were always nice outlined, perfectly proportioned.  He wondered at times if Steve had any idea just how good he looked.  Like an omega version of Captain America.
Suddenly there was a hand on his head; Rumlow was stroking his hair.  "Calm down. You're with STRIKE agents. The most important thing was to get you off the street.  I'm sure you feel threatened right now because we're all Alphas and you're not with your mate, but we're soldiers, like you, Steve, and no one here thinks any less of you for going into heat.  It happens. Take some deep breaths, okay? ...Stuart, can you hand me some water for him? Here, drink this."
Tony shut off the speaker comm.  He was hoping that Steve would be able to get out, but if he couldn't at least his announcement would draw most of the guards up there, which would allow Nat and Clint and Sam to do a sweep.  Tony was planning on going up and shooting every last guard as they came out. One of the last people he expected to see was
"M'fine. Just need a bathroom. I'm sorry, I didn't have time to change into anything else. It's been a long day."
"Oh, this guy's legit, he's got priors!" hollered Trey, and everyone was laughing.  "Watch out-- hey, is Carson here? Carson just got off suppressants, too--"
"Sure, name him Kris Kringle, if he's an O," said Tony sarcastically.  "...it's only May, Donnie, just chill.  You've got nine months to name your little pinto bean."  He threw back another drink.
As much as he believed in the idealism of HYDRA, however, he didn't trust it.  He knew his time was coming to an end. He knew too much and now that they were stripping the soldier of his programming, Karpov was no longer really needed as a handler.  He had already made preparations. He knew they would try to eliminate him; he had no intention of letting that happen. He would pack lightly, taking only a few things. His clothes, his cigarettes, some weapons... and of course, the Winter Soldier's book, the last little memento of their time together.  When the time came, he would leave, disappear into "retirement." And when HYDRA finally establish their new world order, then he would be able to come out of the shadows, a hero, and take his rightful place within the organization.
He rounded on Pepper.  "This is your fault!  You hired an omega!  This is why I only deal with betas... because they do
There was a roped-off corner of the room where omegas were mingling, chatting casually and sipping drinks and lounging on couches.  None of them looked sad to be there but maybe that was just because they didn't know any better. Tony led Steve over and saw the only beta he had seen at the entire convention.
Tony was warm and buzzing against him. he was drunk, Steve could tell, but after the week they'd had and all the chaos around them he couldn't really be mad at him for it. As far as new years went this was pretty awesome. Tony's little mini break down under the bed felt an age away now.
He laughed.  It felt weird, unfamiliar to laugh, his face stretching out in ways it hadn't in a long time.  He couldn't believe it. How the hell had the war ended without him even noticing? This was swell; he could finally go home, a hero; he'd made it.
"Captain America!  Captain America!  Sean's your biggest fan!" yelled one of them, trying to prod Sean forward.  Sean tried to duck away; someone else blocked him.  "Captain Rogers!
"...woo boy.  Yeah, it's possible.  It'll piss a lot of people off.  But it's possible," said Tony, watching the landscapers drag in more orchids.  "The press will eat you alive.  But, yeah, we can do it.  You can do anything if you have enough money."
Tony scanned the crowd, relieved when he finally spotted Steve waltzing with some woman, followed immediately by a pang of jealousy.  The women looked vaguely familiar. Was she a reporter?
"I would never get rid of Steve.  Ever. I distanced our bond, once, and it was the worst feeling in the world.  I'd never do that again. I'm only asking about where bad omegas go because I want to know where Ash and Tricky went.  ...heck, maybe if I got one to help around the house and show Steve the ropes, it would improve our relationship."
Tony looked down.  Steve was lying on the couch; Tony was grabbing one of his wrists, pinning down the opposite shoulder.  A bruise was blooming on Steve's neck where Tony had been sucking at the skin.  He didn't even remember pushing Steve back.  He'd been so absorbed in Steve's neck, the warmth of his skin...
"Gleason! Maybe hold off on Steve's third sedative," Maria said, phone still pressed to her ear.  Steve was muttering something in Russian incoherently. He clearly wasn't going to be much use in a fight either way.
"Just... I'm gonna try and talk to him again," Steve said, pressing a quick kiss to Tony's temple and then disappearing.
Steve just carried Trickshot onto the plane when they got there, it was easier than fiddling with the chair. He gently set him down on one of the long seats when they got inside. Jed gave them all tight hugs, nearly tearing up a little as she said her goodbyes. "Thank you for making this possible, both of you," she whispered, squeezing his and Tony's shoulders.
Upstairs, Aria was tearing through Tony's closet like it was a clearance rack.  Steve owned few ties; it didn't matter.  Aria was helping herself to Tony's.
Pepper examined the tags, then slipped them into her pocket.  It would be better for Steve to deal with the tags later; the last thing in the world she needed was for Tony to find them and set him off again.
"...awful traffic out there, isn't it?" said Malick pleasantly, as if it were normal and not part of a large rally directly affecting Steve.
Tony's eyes darted from Steve back to the others.  He gave himself a small, mental pat on the back for not collapsing right then and there.  Steve was Captain America.  He'd been bossing around Captain America, calling him "Sparky," for over two weeks.  He'd nearly fucked Captain America.  Captain America, his dad's old buddy.  Howard had talked about him constantly and suddenly Howard's views on omega rights clicked into place perfectly.  And now here he was, Captain America, telling him he was actually a good person.  Captain America, who was supposed to be dead, who had returned from the grave to say nice things to him.
She wrinkled her nose in disgust at him.  "Being statused doesn't mean you're allowed to sexually harass people, you know," she said coldly.
"Stan," said Rhodey with surprise.  For a split second, his eyes darted over Steve's body; the aftereffects of Steve's heat were noticeable.  But he wrestled his instincts under control almost instantly and put out a hand to shake Steve's, listening intently to what Steve was saying and nodding, his expression grim.
, Natasha?" Steve demanded. "What do you want me to say? That I fucked up? That I got compromised? I'm a ninety-five year old virgin who’s still coming to terms with the fact that he isn't fucking dead and that I've fallen for Tony fucking Stark- who hates me- because fate has a grim sense of humor?"
"...that was easy," said Tony with fake bravado.  He crossed the the room towards the ring and picked it up with a pair of pliers.
if he had to. How to blend into crowds, how to read people... the soldier had turned into an agent. Steve wasn't sure how he felt about that transformation. But he couldn't really go back now, could he?
my dad.  I think he was more upset over Dad's death than I was.  He, uh... he had that thing... Takotsubo syndrome." Tony finally snagged the olive and popped it into his mouth.  "...but he never wore a collar," he added.
"That's the worst of it," Steve hummed and entwined their fingers together with a sleepy smile. He felt more with it than he had in days, his gaze focused despite his sleepiness as it flitted over Tony's face. "I love you too," he whispered and tilted his head up to steal a quick kiss from Tony's lips. It felt right. It felt easy. It felt as simple as breathing.
"What, he won't have sex with an omega in heat?  Come on, that's a base instinct. The two of them were making out earlier and no one asked them to--"
Steve let out a long breath and nodded. "Yeah. Sure. Just don't tell me how many people are watching."
"I don't remember you," said Tony, squinting at her.  "And I would definitely remember you." She was wearing a red, backless evening gown with a plunging neckline that showed off the curve of her breasts.
Steve was rather taken back by Tony's speech. He didn't know what to say for a moment. He sat there, stunned, as he stared at Tony. Steve blinked.
Steve was blushed terribly and suddenly very uncomfortable in a total different way as he had no idea what to do with himself. "You're so big." Maria smiled, wide eyed as she stared up at him. "Are you bigger, you know..."
"--because that's me and Pepper's traditional and it's Christmas Eve.  If we leave by noon and speed like crazy we can get there before four, maybe even by three."
There had been a picture of Steve and his father in the study, too.  Weird that Tony had stared into the face of his mate since childhood without knowing.  It was like an episode of
"Tony.  No one out there actually cares, you know.  St-- he made it very clear that there's only you.  Come on, you've had what, like thirty ex-girlfriends?  Weren't you engaged once for like forty-eight hours? You already knew he had an ex."
Regardless, Steve thought the story was sweet. Or at least, watching Tony read it was sweet. He looked happy. Steve couldn't remember seeing him this happy in front of this many people before. Maybe it was their heat. Maybe it was christmas. Who knew?
Gleason held out a clipboard for Steve to sign a paper that would let him access the samples SHIELD had taken from him in the jet.
"Sorry, I... drifted off for a moment there," Steve said quietly, pushing the pants into Tony's arms and fastening his shirt one button higher for the sake of smartness.
She grabbed the assault rifle off of his shoulders and threw it over hers.  Steve watched with a frown etched into his features. Seeing a "nurse" handle a gun with such ease was... unsettling.  She was already aiming it at them.
Tony's top lip still had the stitches in. It looked a little sore. So Steve pressed a kiss to his bottom lip gently. "I love you."
"Usually he gets over it within a day or two," said Happy somberly.  "But you know Tony.  The Afghanistanniversary kinda makes the whole month shitty."
He immediately knew he was in the air because of the small window to his right. He could see clouds and the pinkish tinge of the sun rising through the sky. His head throbbed and so did his ankle. They were bruises on his neck. He could feel them.
"I don't know what a Möbius strip is..." Steve admitted in a murmur, fingers trailing down the muscle of Tony's forearm. He watched his Alpha staring into the distance and frowned a little. How could Tony be so close but sometimes feel so far away?
He spared a glance at Steve.  Steve was sitting there, bright pink, blushing, eyes roaming over Tony's body.
Tony downed the glass of water and passed it to Steve.  "Okay, okay, I'm sober now, can I go?" he demanded, rolling out of bed without waiting for Steve's response.  He stumbled, nearly fell, then caught himself.
"Steve, Piper, go get us some drinks, will you?" demanded Tony.  He gave Steve an apologetic look but then realized Steve may not be able to see it behind his sunglasses.
Steve's broad back was to him, staring into the dark room.  The walls were covered in little stainless-steel drawers, like a library's card catalog, almost.  There were lots of blank screens, medical devices, wires strewn everywhere... in the middle of the room, a chair, like a dentist's chair, except no dentist had straps like that on the arm rests...
Not that he was thinking about the other mark at present; he was already gripping his own mark and was going to bite down as soon as Steve sheathed him.
Tony's relationship with his parents hadn't been "precious" and Tony wasn't grateful for his past and he sure as fuck wasn't going to cry over the future he'd never had.  So what if he was orphaned as a teenager. Good riddance; it was only a matter of time before he and Howard killed each other anyway. Perhaps not literally, although there had been plenty of times Howard had chased Tony around the house with a belt.  Tony remembered Lupita telling him it was normal for Alpha boys, going through puberty, to feud with their fathers; it was a dominance thing, perfectly natural, and they would get over it. But they never had. Howard had died without any sort of resolution to their feud and Tony had stubbornly refused to forgive him for anything for the last twenty-five years.  If anything, Tony took a savage sort of pleasure in knowing he was withholding that.
pretend he was just a regular beta businessman, home from a long day at the office.  That everything was normal and okay. The cigarette smell helped cover up Steve's scent, which was nice.  He could almost ignore the upset radiating from their bond.  Steve's upset.
The two scientists didn't move, watching with interest, Karpov stifled a yawn and reached into his jacket for a flask, looking thoroughly exhausted.
insane. But if he wasn't ready to commit to Tony now then when would be he? He swallowed and dragged this thumb away from Tony's mouth and along the curve of his jaw. "I'm here, and unless you want me gone, I'm not going anywhere. I want to prove I mean that.  And-" He hesitated. "It wouldn't mean that you have to forgive me, or anything. I don't mean it like that. This would be because
He tried to remember.  "Well... I just... I wanted to beat up some Krauts," he said lamely.  Hell, everyone had been signing up. It seemed like a good gig, he had an omega and siblings to care for, and he was a strong young Alpha and his country needed him.  That's why.
Also, reminder: no updates on Thursday and possibly no updates on Sunday due to the Infinity War release.  - T
"Ready, Captain Rogers?" asked the female, holding up a syringe.  Tony cringed.  He hated doctors and he hated needles.  A bead of liquid appeared at the tip and slid down, glinting ominously in the light.  It contrasted weirdly with the blonde doctor, who was humming a little and reached out to wipe Steve's arm off with an iodine swab, looking like this was a normal day at the beach.  For her, it probably was.
Steve woke up to his alarm with a groan. He rubbed a hand over his face and felt the dead weight of Tony still sleeping on top of him. He reached over stiffly to stop his alarm. They didn't have long to get downstairs. "Tony," Steve nudged him lightly with his elbow. "Tony? C'mon, we gotta get up..." He let out a soft huff. Steve knew he would be sore later. It had certainly been on the rough side and everyone would see the fresh bite mark on his neck too. God, he hoped they didn't think they were getting something out of his conference. Frond teaching them about the gland had just been a weird and unexpected highlight during a very depressing few days.
It was only once they walked away from the desk that Tony realized Piper hadn't said a single word to them.
Steve stood, a little shakily at first, but then he got his bearings. He grabbed the man nearest to him, the one fighting with Kate, and lifted him up, driving his elbow into his neck, breaking it with a sickening, organic crunch. Then he dropped his body and walked over to where the Winter Soldier was still grappling with Fury. He jumped up onto the countertop, leg trembling a little, but he ignored it.  The Winter Soldier had long hair.  Convenient. A bullet nicked into the cupboard door by his head.
Pietro nodded to her, then looked over at the sniper.  He was far away, but had already stopped and was staring at them.
Then Steve made coffee. He left one on the coffee table in front of DeSoto for when he woke up, and then took two cups into the bedroom, one for him and one for Tony. He set them down on the bedside and then knelt down beside the bed, gently reaching up to shake Tony's shoulder. "Hey, Tony," he murmured. "Time to wake up."
"He'll probably be put into cryo," Maria and Steve's head snapped up in alarm. "It's a precaution. You can't treat someone until you know what the 'antidote' is. It's safer this way. Apparently in HYDRA he has a reputation for maiming or killing doctors."
Steve lifted his leg and Hill walked over to strap the tracker onto his leg with a little more force than was probably necessary. "Why the entourage?" Steve asked. "Worried I'd say no?"
"Oh, shit.  I should call someone else, then."  Tony hiccuped.  "...maybe I oughta call Stan.  I mean, Steve.  I mean, Captain America."  He felt his stomach drop a little.
Tony took a swing the moment that Rhodey was within range.  He was too drunk and had grossly over-estimated the punch; he actually staggered past Rhodey.  Rhodey took the opportunity to throw an arm around Tony's shoulders from behind.  "I said,
He climbed onto the bed, the mattress depressing very slightly under him, Steve's body tensing up with expectation.
Steve's eyes widened in surprise at the pill but he swallowed it obediently without a second thought.
"You better check how Mr. Stark is doing in his poker game," Fred told him, appearing at his other side.
He found a second blue Ford Focus and pried off the license plate, swapping them.  An easy trick, one that could shake off authorities for two or three days. If you kept finding the same car and swapping plates, you could use the same car for weeks.  Even better, if you could find three or four of the same car and swap all the plates around, you could bamboozle the authorities almost indefinitely.
Except, that wasn't exactly true.  Steve had been here before, in a cell in Yemen.  And he knew what came next.
It was funny how even now, when he could drop dead at any moment, he desperately wanted to impress Steve.
"My hand is fine," said Tony quickly.  "No lasting damage. Just a minor little break."  (A partial lie; the break on his thumb was a clean one but it was by no means "minor.")  "I think I had a break-through with the Mark VII. You know, modular, non-gantry, flight-capable armor?  Yeah. I got a whole arm to come to me and self-assemble. It, uh... it had a very small, very
The moment the ten of them (the six bodyguards, plus Tony and Steve, plus Aria and Pepper) crammed into an elevator, it was suddenly and startlingly quiet.
He knew perfectly well it was short-lived, of course.  He'd already mentioned the upcoming quadranscentennial of his parents' death, in a little over two weeks, and now that he'd spoken it, it had begun lurking in the back of his mind like a dark shadow.  Tony usually dedicated at least a week to having a massive breakdown, moping around the house drunk in various stages of undress and playing classical dirges on the piano while Pepper calmly cancelled all his appointments for him.
Tony pulled Steve into an embrace, putting his hand on the back of Steve's head and letting Steve bury his face into Tony's chest.  As usual, Tony ended up on his tip-toes and Steve had to stoop a little.
He slipped his phone into his pocket.  Playing Tetris was becoming impossible, because Pepper was texting him like crazy, and he had to admit, reluctantly, that it was time to attend the meeting, whether he wanted to or not.  He turned and made his way toward the elevators, a lot more worked up than he cared to admit.  Maybe it was Steve saying he was concerned.  Tony didn’t like others being concerned for him.  It made him feel vulnerable.  He preferred to hide his weaknesses.  He wanted to be the same kind of man and Alpha his father had been: unshakeable.  He didn’t want people to know when he was sick or scared.  Hell, when he had come back from Afghanistan, he’d given a press conference immediately, just to prove how strong he was.
. No camp could fix that. And Steve had even been shit at being a forties omega. He was very glad now, in hindsight. Things would have gone very differently if he'd had children...if he'd somehow even managed to survive it.
But Pitbull turned out to be an Alpha, not an omega.  He was a white, bald-headed man whose dominance was on equal footing with Tony's.
Fury sat down heavily at Sam's words.  Tony was barely aware of the others with him.  Dr. Brazinski was there, her hair down for once, her eyes tired behind her glasses.  Tony wasn't sure which one was Sitwell and which one Mackenzie; both had shaved heads and were wearing suits.  One was dark in complexion and had facial hair, the other olive-skinned and clean-shaven. But he didn't really care because Phil was absolutely captivating to him.
"Such a good fit," mumbled Tony against Steve's throat, rolling his hips lazily.  "Feels so good... my good omega..." He sighed contentedly.
"Mm.  Sleep," agreed Tony, closing his eyes.  He relaxed against Steve, feeling limp, like he was drifting, or floating.
Aria raised a hand to rub it away from his mouth with a frustrated huff. Steve felt guilty and confused. Had she really kissed him? Had he kissed her back? He wasn't really sure.
"My mom played piano.  She would walk past and play the opening notes of Ode to Joy whenever she was happy.  It was like laughter. She did that less and less as I got older. Dad drank. Sometimes, I would pass the piano and play those notes, just to piss him off.  I don’t know why I did that. She took the blame for it. He blamed her.” He paused again, letting the silent spool out. "And... and that's all I really remember.  Not her voice or her laugh or even what she looked like, outside of the photos. Just those eight notes on the piano."
didn't really want to go to war. They didn't want to die. What I'm saying is... I think we should talk more and fire guns less, because... um... killing people is horrible. And I never want to wish that anyone. You know?" Steve was kind of rambling. "Sure, the army is necessary. You make awesome friends. Doesn't make it a good thing.  I mean the killing.  Not the army.  I love the army.  I love America."
Was it worse or better to be pinned by an omega?  Hard to say.  Steve had been gentle but Tony was well aware that Steve was bigger than him, stronger; that he could be easily overpowered by Steve, despite Steve's status.
Pepper observed him for a moment.  He seemed... okay. She took the bottle with her, though, just in case.
; waking up and realising there's a whole trilogy now was pretty awesome, I have to admit..." He remembered how much he smiled when Clint presented the DVDs to him as a present. It had made his day.  Hell, his week.  The visual effects were stunning.
"I'm not doing great..." he began.  "I've basically lost all trust in SHIELD.  Not that I had much to begin with. My mate just walked out of here without a word and I just saw the Winter Soldier shoot me and also Bucky is apparently somehow involved and maybe not even dead? And apparently we were always bonded and I just stopped feeling it because
He stood on the gantry platform and let the suit be assembled around him, his mind still turning over SHIELD's psych evaluation.  It seemed extremely, bordering on reckless.
Steve woke at seven am. He checked Tony's temperature again. Then he fetched him a glass of water and left it by the bedside, using the glass to hold down a note that read
Tony felt disappointed it was such a simple explanation, and even more disappointed that he hadn't made the connection.
He guided Steve's fingertips over the arc reactor slowly, tracing it.  "Steve, you're a total badass. You're a soldier. You're giving an interview and it's going to help probably ten thousand omegas.  You're alive and warm and you're with your friends, and you're about to have a
George seemed thoroughly unembarrassed.  "Oh, I was a 'graduate' from St. Claver's.  It's one of those so-called omega etiquette schools.  Not a real education. Just teaching you how to be 'good' for an Alpha.  The 'graduation' was basically being sold. Luke picked me out, there was a big ceremony... this was
"Too-nnnyyy?" Steve nuzzled against his cheek, getting onto all fours. His eyes widened as the dildo moved inside of him. His Alpha still didn't wake up. He looked at the door Tiberius just had left out of it and then shook the intrusive thought away before he slumped back down on the bed and sneaked a hand down between his legs. "If you want something done right..." he mumbled, fixing his fingers around the base.
"Fucking figures.  Bet they've been staking out your place for weeks, waiting for you and Stark to go back there," grumbled Fury, his hands tights on the steering wheel.  They were headed east, too fast, weaving through traffic, their bodies being thrown back and forth every time the car moved.
.  "I would never let myself be treated like that again. I swear. And I never wanted to make you look bad. I didn't want for there to be scar tissue left. I wanted you to bond me. I
"...so my service to you is done?" called Tony as Malick stomped off, with Donner scampering behind him.  Tony felt a lot better after pissing off Malick. He plucked a flute of champagne from a passing tray along with a program.  He flipped it open. The program made sure everything was perfectly legal, at least technically. The auction was for a "night of company" and it noted that the proceeds benefited some private school called Shore's Breath that educated omegas.  It looked like a regular charity auction and if Tony had stumbled in here accidentally he wouldn't had seen anything wrong.
," he said.  Steve looked up; so did Phil.  They were sitting on the floor together, holding hands.  Tony's mouth watered; he might as well have found the two of them in the midst of a naked pillow fight.
Ty went quiet for a moment, still staring at the pool. Apparently it was easier than looking up and meet Steve's gaze.  Steve noticed that, despite Ty saying he'd like a smoke, he'd made no motion to reach for any cigarettes. "Are you happy with Tony?" asked Ty finally.
"Yes. Yes--" Steve moaned, trying to nod even though Tony couldn't really see it. His thighs trembled with need, fingers digging into the sheets tightly. "I need it. Please. Give it to me. I
"Don't worry, Steve, I'm gonna get you to the hospital!" shouted Tony, oblivious to the conversations going on around him.
"Well, I was around for his first heat, and other than a single incident, he seemed pretty with it," agreed Mackenzie.
"His mate was pointing a gun at this other omega, 'the badly behaved one'. He was drunk and then accidentally shot DeSoto in the arm," Steve said.
By the end of the interview and photo shoot Tony was positive he had tinnitus from Jameson yelling everything.
you! Put me down! Tony! Get your omega under control-" spat Justin, squirming in clear discomfort; Steve had a fistful of suit and tie and hair and showed no sign of loosening his grip.
Tony was outside.  He leaned over the balcony, the pool glowing behind him, trying not to look at the several party guests that had gotten naked and jumped in.  He was smoking a cigar, staring out at the ocean. It was a clear night; he could see the lights from Santa Monica pier, the Ferris wheel and the neon lights...
Steve dropped to his knees like some invisible hand had pushed him down. His voice trembled with a strange kind of reverence. "I want to be good for you. I want to give you what you want. All of it. And then I want you to come back for more."
and then you show up in a thirty-year-old t-shirt to make a big announcement without consulting me and also get into a feral fight with one of the presenters
There were red lights flashing on the walls, and sounds from the corridor.  Their stealth mission was no longer stealthy at all.
Tony flexed slightly under Steve's hand.  "You have a lot of Alpha friends," he observed.  He looked over Steve's body.  "...I know they're just friends," he added suddenly.  He
He rose off Steve a little to look out the window.  Ah.  The road was running along a chain-link fence and, beyond it, Tony could see the long runways and taxiways of the airport, the hundreds of yellow and blue and white and red lights creating an artificial, eternal day along the tarmac.
He pulled out his arc reactor and did a quick swipe of his socket with a couple of fingers.  When Tony was stressed he always began to worry there might be something wrong with the reactor; after all, only a year ago, it had nearly killed him.  There was a little discharge but it was clear and didn't smell. Tony double-checked all the wires and connections, then pushed it back into his chest. Steve, who had gotten used to seeing the RT node come out and Tony dig around in his chest, didn't react.
"Look. I better go, you're tired and we're just about to have dinner. But thanks for letting me know about my brother Steve, really."
Steve was a little nervous about Tony going in with no suit, but he thought it might be insulting to ask if he'd done this kind of thing before.  If Bucky was any indications, Alphas were too proud for their own good.
Everyone looked over.  Tony was sitting in a chair too small for the armor.  He'd taken off the helmet and set it on the table, and was staring at it, his gaze distant.  His metal fingers drummed on the table.
Steve had known chickenpox scars didn't look like that. But in the army a lot of people had scars, and you didn't press to know about them. Scars were personal, intimate. They came out in their own time.
"I want a drink," Natasha said dryly and pulled back towards the kitchen area. Phil followed on as the Alpha female moved to raid through a drinks cabinet with a worrying level of comfortableness as she popped open a bottle of dark coloured rum and found some glasses.
"Your point being?"  Fury's voice didn't betray whether or not he was surprised by this information.
He forced himself to go meet Cece at the coffee shop so they could talk about Steve, even though he was shaking and cold and itchy.  He wanted to find Karpov and get some medicine. That mission had moved up on the list. However, with Cece so close, it would be foolish not to consult her.
He sucked in a soft breath. "Yeah...I did," Steve wet his lips and was glad Tony couldn't exactly see all of his face right. He had no doubt he was betraying a great deal of emotions- including both arousal and embarrassment. "You asked me to," he said like it was the simplest thing in the world. Like that was all the explanation required. "I'd..." Steve glanced away, not able to look at Tony as he spoke. Maybe it his old submissive habits coming into play. He'd never look at Tony too long, his blue gaze always flicking to the floor out of respect. "I'd do it again if you asked me to," he confessed in a whisper.
He woke up early, with a headache, feeling ill and shaky.  The whole night before felt like a bad dream, except that the heavy metal suitcase was still on the floor at the end of their bed.
Bucky reached for it with his good hand to flip it open eagerly.  It was blank. He turned the pages, searching for information. There was none.
Then he brought it up and and added, "Yeah, we bonded."  He lowered it and looked over at Steve.  "Steve?  You wanna say anything?" he asked, gently, gesturing him forward, offering him the microphone.
"...Steve.  You're causing quite a stir," said Fury.  He didn't sound thrilled. "Sometimes I get the idea you like getting beat down.  You realize you're picking a fight with a guy bigger than you, right? Gideon Malick is second in command at the World Security Council, and just because you've been decommissioned by SHIELD doesn't mean we're not keeping a close eye on you.  Malick's trying to open up a case against Stark and his weapons again. Seems to think a guy who crashes black-tie events drunk in his underpants shouldn't have access to anything capable of bringing down a fighter plane. Hard to argue with that."
"You should have seen what Phil wanted me to wear," Steve murmured with a roll of his eyes. His uniform was more of a navy, far darker. The red was darker too and the white star in the middle of his chest wasn't too obtuse. He looked more like a soldier and less like Cap from the comic books.
She tried to push her way through the crowd toward him, but Steve was already heading toward the back door.
"Have you thought about what we'll do afterwards?" asked Wanda idly.  They'd done an ample amount of studying. Tony was reclusive, but Steve wasn't.  They were able to figure out his last heat. Pietro cycled every four and a half months, a result of his ridiculous metabolism.  Steve might cycle in, say, five. On the other hand, he had a lot of omega friends, and omegas who were close cycled together. In any case, they knew it was coming up soon, in June or July, and they knew that was the best possible time to attack.
Banksy dragged him and Dr. Gleason off easily; Tony waited until they were gone. "...I'm so glad Banksy's here."
Brazinski smiled at him. "SHIELD is aware of the role they played in setting up your new life. We do not simply wish to abandon you because you cannot go out into the field, Captain."
Steve gasped as he was filled and ground down. Tony's cock teased his prostate just that little bit more and dragged him over the edge. He squirmed and clenched around his Alpha's member and then came, a silent gasp leaving his lips as he made a mess out of both of them. It was satisfying and dirty. Steve really needed a shower but he was content to bask in the moment right now.
Tony laughed a little.  "That's another thing I like about you," he said softly.  "You never heard of me, because you're from, y'know, another time.  So... I get to be myself.  There's no preconceived notions.  You know, most people have heard of me, they have expectations... with you, I get the experience of starting from nothing and... that's kinda cool."
"Yeah, that's true," Tony said instead, because when he thought about it, he could picture Peter hitching a ride on the back of a truck or something. Goodness knows Steve had told him enough stories about when he used to do it.
"Colonel Phillips believes that's a strong possibility," Uncle James said. "And that's all he'd say over the phone, so don't ask me any more questions 'cause I won't know the answers."
"No, he didn't beat me," said Sam. "He only kicked both my ass and Bucky's in about an hour flat. It was like he could see the whole damn game from just the first move."
Pursing his lips, Peter adjusted the mask covering his face and squeezed his eyes closed, preparing to jump from the wall.
Risking life and limb and God-knows-what else in messing with the laws that governed the universe was an infinitesimal price to pay for having his son back.
"Absolutely, little guy," Steve said as he smoothed his hair back. "Just give Dad and me a few minutes to get ready, okay?"
But Flash only smirked, shooting Peter a rather maniacal grin as he took another sip from his cup, which Peter now realised probably had been spiked with something.
Peter's belly gave a swoop at Mr Stacy's gruff tone, and he set down his fork, taking a slow, deliberate sip of his water.
“Okay, JARVIS, here we go,” he said.  “Do me a favour and find me the SI employee file for Regina Williams, will ya?”
"Sam just called. Nat and Clint are about an hour out of Savannah, so he wants us to take off within the next thirty minutes. We're gonna meet up with the Quinjet at a small regional airport about fifteen minutes outside of Savannah. Once everyone's there, you and I will do a couple of reconnaissance runs using the new interface to hopefully see what we're up against, and then—"
“Mmm, that doesn't sound very convincing, hon,” Tony said, his eyebrows knitting together into a frown.  “You know you don't have to do this, right?  I’m perfectly capable of going in there and telling Obie exactly where he can stick it on my own, and—”
Peter's pencil flipped rapidly around his thumb as he studied his drawing of the big backyard tree, his tongue poking out between his teeth as he added the goofy crooked branch that'd always stuck out about five feet up from the ground.
But despite his attempt at bravado, as they made their way towards the bank of elevators, Tony was far more nervous than he wanted to admit. Out of all of the changes he'd made to the security systems at both the Tower and the Compound, having to deal with a possible threat that was the size of a goddamn bug was the one thing that had not occurred to him.
"My dad and Steve are gonna come and visit me tonight, so I'd love to look nice when they get here."
Steve silenced him with a soft kiss, gliding his palms up Tony's back. "That's all that matters to me, sweetheart," he whispered. "I love you and Peter more than anything, and I'll do whatever it takes to keep you both safe, you know I will."
of the polished military shoes against the carpeted floor and the soft jingles of medals a soothing backdrop to what otherwise might have felt like a final walk down death row.
Breathing in a deep breath, Papa pursed his lips and glanced over Peter's head at Dad, who gave him a single nod.
Peter signed, closing his eyes as he allowed himself to wallow in self-pity for a few moments. All things aside about saving the country, Peter absolutely
Steve thought, surprised at the sharp flare of jealousy that shot through him. He had no business being envious of a busy father who finally got the opportunity to visit his sick child.
They flew back to New York the following day, with Natasha graciously saving Tony when Mr Harrington asked to sit next to him on the plane. The last thing Tony needed was to have the final remaining threads of his patience completely shredded by Peter's dorky Decathlon coach talking at him the entire flight home.
"Yeah, I'm okay!" answered Peter, watching in shock as a blue-skinned android jumped out of the wrecked ship, pulling two arm-length knives from her belt.
"What in the hell do you think you're doing?" he murmured as the aircraft's back engine suddenly engaged with a near-deafening
"I'm not afraid to have… all of this," he murmured. He looked over at the portrait of their family that hung on the wall over the bed, one that Papa had painted from a drawing that he'd given Dad right before the Phoenix mission. "I guess… I'm just afraid that now that I've got it… I'm just gonna end up fucking it all up again."
Which meant that all Steve and his teammates needed to do was use the tunnel to transport themselves back to that point during the Battle of Wakanda, and wait.
Anyone who tells his partner that he can’t take an hour’s break from an overly-rigorous training schedule to go and visit his dying mother has to be one of the lowest forms of human.
"Not like I've never heard it before," Peter mumbled, only loud enough for Papa to hear. Papa raised an eyebrow, but thankfully didn't say anything. He knew probably better than anyone how stressed out Dad was lately, trying to organise the various convoys transporting HYDRA remnants to the SHIELD storage facility in Maryland before Congress returned to the Capitol towards the end of the month. Dad really wanted to be able to tell the Armed Forces Committee that the cleanup in D.C. was complete, leaving only the rest of the New York City mess to deal with.
"Copy that," Steve said. "Once you're done head straight towards the main entrance and keep your eyes peeled. We're on our way now."
And no matter how many times Tony tried to tell him that he had never been expected to take down HYDRA on his own, not during the war—wasn't that what the Howling Commandos and the rest of the SSR were for?—and certainly not now, Steve didn't believe him.
"Bucky?" Steve said, whimpering as Bucky attempted to take a step towards him, only to fall flat on his face when his left leg broke apart like a dead leaf. Not three seconds later he was completely gone, nothing but a pile of ashes spread across the dirt.
Uncle Bucky snapped from the gurney he was lying on.  He was hooked up to so many tubes and wires that Peter could barely make out his face, which was almost as pale as the stark-white hospital bedding.
They had checked in with Peter earlier that morning while he was eating breakfast with Sam, making sure that he remembered to pack his gym clothes and an extra hoodie, as well as all the snacks he needed to keep his blood sugar even so he didn't pass out during Decathlon practise. Tony had suspected that he had hit yet another growth spurt while they were in Italy since he'd been eating nearly everything in sight, which likely meant that Steve would have to take him clothes shopping again soon.
"So the bottom line is, we don't know for sure," said Steve, his free hand clenching into a fist at his side. He could feel both Tony's worried eyes and Sam's concerned ones boring into the sides of his head, so he was trying very hard not to give into his welling panic. The team needed him to be their Captain, not the blubbering mess he felt like being at the moment.
"Oh," Steve said, grateful for the darkness to hide his frown. No wonder Tony had been showing up for work wearing the same clothes all the time. He probably hadn't been home much since Peter's hospital admission.
Dad's eyes narrowed as he stared at Papa's shaking chin. "Well, you're just gonna have to figure out a way then, 'cause it's not gonna happen. There is absolutely no way in
Steve's long fingers tangled into Tony's hair, pressing against his scalp. "So… what? Is there supposed to be a question here?"
He felt Gwen's fingers on his cheek, tilting his head up to look at her. "Can you at least acknowledge what I'm saying?"
Deciding that he looked halfway-decent enough, Peter picked up his new camera—a birthday present from Uncle James and Auntie Carol—and headed down the hall towards the guest bedroom, where he suspected Papa was probably pacing back and forth while he waited for his cue to head downstairs for the ceremony. Like many military men—and Auntie Carol too, apparently—Papa was used to getting dressed very quickly, whereas Peter figured Dad was more likely to be pacing back and forth inside the master bedroom still only wearing his underwear and socks.
"Peter Stark, please," he said to the operator, drumming his fingertips on the desk while he waited.
"And your friend is all right, Pete, she's with a couple of the police officers," Dad added, his fingers combing through Peter's singed and matted hair. "And Stacy's gonna be okay too." He paused, pursing his lips. "One of the other officers said that you saved his life, so…"
"Mmm, well, that wouldn't be too horrible, would it?" Steve murmured. "Didn't you tell me once that you like it when I carry you?" He pressed his fingertips into Tony's scalp again, pulling an even louder moan from Tony's throat.
"Yes, and he won't hesitate to rip Wakanda to shreds while he's searching for it," Bruce said, sighing heavily. "Your Highness, are you absolutely certain that there's no way the stone could be moved? Or—or destroyed?"
"They took—HYDRA, they…" He paused to suck in air, his entire body shuddering and his teeth clenched. "Oh God, Tony they
"What're you trying to do with that biological?" Steve demanded. "HYDRA's dead in the water and you know it, so who're you trying to sell it to?"
"Okay, I'm going to ask you again," he said in his Captain's voice. "Do you think this is still a good idea?"
"Yeah, I guess I did. It'll hopefully mean that he'll sleep good though," Steve added, his warm breath on Tony's ear causing him to shiver. "Do you think we should suggest that he head to bed now?"
“Aahh, Steven!” Shostakov exclaims loudly enough for the entire damn pool area to hear.  He stands to his feet and rushes over to Steve, giving an exaggerated bow.  “You like what you see, no?”
Tony quirked an eyebrow as he brushed Steve's bangs from his forehead, his beautiful face so radiant in the soft bluish light of their bedroom that tears pricked Steve's eyes.
"I'm afraid I have no good answer to that question, Captain," said Thor, so gravely that Steve's blood ran cold. "I have only what I fear."
Peter's belly gave a hard swoop, his hands gripping his jacket as if it were a life raft. Of all the traits that he had inherited from his father, apparently being able to easily talk to girls wasn't one of them.
"All I'm saying is that it might give you some more chances to unwind a bit," added Sam. "Which, no offence, you could definitely use."
"Yes, I do," Steve said firmly. "'Cause without you and Peter I don't know if I ever would've opened my eyes enough to see what was going on around me, and that's just inexcusable. No one should ever be that blind, Tony. Not ever."
And judging from what he fears lays ahead, he's going to need every ounce of mental clarity he can get.
"I'm pretty sure your guesses are worth a lot more than most people's certainty, J," Tony cut in. "Go ahead and render a new part that matches these specs, yeah? Use the same gold/ titanium alloy composition that I use for my suits."
looks. "You're kidding me, right?" he asked. "Holy shit, Steve, I've been thinking about it pretty much the whole damn day!"
"Let's not get ahead of ourselves, hmm, Captain Rogers?" added Phillips. "Who knows, you might get up there today and decide that you don't even like how the X-302 flies."
"It wasn't," Steve answered, low and gravelly. He lifted his head, clearing his throat as he glanced over at Peter, his lower lip wobbling slightly as he noticed Bucky kneeling next to him, gently patting his head. "That ice wasn't… natural. It was too strong and spread way too quickly. It was almost like it was weaponised, meant to disable and destroy like the chemical weapons they used during the wars."
Sam grinned as he fiddled with the edge of his napkin. "Well, I'm pretty damn lucky to have him too. Long as you don't tell him that I said anything."
"Hope is always stronger than fear," Tony said out loud, his eyes trained on Steve's drawing. And he owed it to both Steve and to Peter to keep on hoping until all of the hope was gone.
After being forced to watch Peter literally get stolen right out from under his nose and then having Steve get literally torn right from his arms, Tony was taking no more chances.
"She's wonderful, Tony," said Steve. "She told me what an incredible father you were way back before I even met Peter for the first time, so I know she'd be willing to help us."
"'Cause we don't have that much of it," said Steve. "Just enough to power our X-302s and build the container. It's an extremely rare metal."
Gwen gave him a rueful smile. "Well, I know I'm not the smartest person in the class, but I'm no dummy either. Your lightning-fast reflexes when I almost dropped my computer that one time? Your bad reaction to the peppermint in my mom's cake? The fact that I found your clothes at Liz's house that night of her party, and how you were able to save my dad's life when the movie theatre blew up? It all makes sense."
Tony immediately scoffed, disguising it as a weird sort of cough as he tucked his notes under his arm. Out of all of the thousands of members of the Langaran military there was not a single one of them that Tony felt he could trust farther than he could throw, except for Rhodey.
"There are tools aboard," said Gamora, tossing a wary glance over at Strange. "But I really don't think that—"
“Good morning, gentlemen,” Pepper said as she handed Tony a thick stack of collated papers.  “Colonel Rhodes, Mr Wilson, and Sergeant Barnes are waiting in your office, Mr Stark, and I’ve set up your other two guests down in the conference room with Happy.”
Ned exclaimed, so loudly that at least a half a dozen students sitting at a nearby table stopped talking to look in their direction. "You get to go to
"Uh huh," Peter mumbled as Steve brushed the curls from his forehead, leaning down to kiss him. "'Night, Papa."
"And that chance was to steal something from our home? Where we live with our own child?" Steve asked sternly. "Not to mention the other members of our team?"
Peter shook his head, grimacing as he remembered how grumpy Papa had been the night before. "No, I think it's more that the doctor's just being extra careful. I'm sure he doesn't want to be remembered as the guy who botched Captain America's broken foot after Dr Cho personally asked him to fix it. And I also think that Papa didn't really want to admit how messed up his foot was in the first place. I mean, I saw all of the X-rays and I saw how awful it looked before the surgery started, and I still can't believe he could even stand on it when I first found him in that prison, much less take steps with it."
"Most of the afternoon, yeah," answered Tony. "Darn Bruce ended up drinking the rest of my coffee too. Papa had to run out and get me more."
"Yeah. Okay," Steve whispered back. Then he closed his eyes, breathing in the scent of Tony's hair as he allowed sleep to take him, no longer afraid to dream.
"Where're you going this time, Papa?" Peter asked as he stepped into Steve's open arms, squeezing him so tightly that Steve grunted. Peter had had yet another growth spurt over the summer, and still hadn't quite adjusted to his subsequent increase in strength.
A knot rose in Steve's throat at his beloved's tone, all no-nonsense and tough, but still with the slight wobble to it that only he and Peter could ever detect.
"I'd rather you didn't," Tony cut in as he pushed himself up to his feet. He had to get out of there; there was no way he could think rationally with those piercing blue eyes staring down at him, tugging on his heartstrings. "I… I need to go. I can't—I can't be around you right now. I need to think, so…"
"Put the Stacys up in one of the spare apartments," he finally said. "Have JARVIS order in some food and other amenities for them, they might be there awhile."
And then losing Bucky, and being forced to grieve for him while still fighting the war, well… after that, Steve wasn't sure if he'd ever learn how to do it properly.
"Who?" asked Gwen, shooting Peter a questioning look. "Am I supposed to know who that is or something?"
"Steve knows about JARVIS, buddy," Dad said, as if he'd read Peter's mind. "And that we're hoping to start the trial missions soon."
"Yeah, I could see that," Uncle Bucky said after a short pause. "But somehow I doubt that they're just sitting around on their asses either."
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t hesitate to hit the kudos button and leave me a review!  💖
"Damn." Tony sat back as he removed his glasses, scrubbing at his eyes. "Now there's a thought, hmm?"
Peter nodded, burrowing further into his blankets and closing his eyes, trying to focus only on the sound of his dads' heartbeats rather than the searing pain in his limbs. He highly doubted that Papa would get any sleep that night, especially if he was stuck so deep inside his own fears like he was.
"What the—?" Uncle Clint said as a massive portal began to open in the cloud-dotted sky above the plain, an almost exact replica of the portal Loki had used to bring the Chitauri into New York. "Is that—?"
And then, before anyone could move or even react, Thanos opened up one of his portals and disappeared in a cloud of billowing dust, leaving the eight of them stranded on Titan.
"Well, at least there's that," said Dad. He huffed out a sharp breath as he checked his reflection, turning to allow Uncle James to pin on his boutonnière. "Are ya ready, Pete?"
Peter thought, his heart starting to thud. He pressed his palm over his chest, begging his stupid heart to behave itself for once. The last thing he needed was one of his monitors to start going off and halt the conversation.
Tipping his head back, Steve closed his eyes as his aircraft breached the barrier, his hands firm but pliable on the controls as his entire cockpit shook with turbulence. This was by far his least-favourite part of the whole flying into space thing, and he was very relieved for JARVIS's help as he allowed the computer system to guide him through.
"Cap, we need another option here," Sam said as he flew overhead. "Anything we're able to do just gets fixed as soon as the damn thing moves again."
Tony stood rooted to the spot for several heartbeats, almost too afraid to move. It wasn't until another car honked at him to get out of the way that he drew in a deep breath and hurried towards his car, gripping the steering wheel with both hands as soon as he was inside.
"Yes," Gwen said quickly. "I'd—I'd love to see a movie with you. How 'bout a week from Saturday? My dad will be working then, so… he'll be more likely to say that I can go if he's nearby."
"Well, well, well. It's nice to finally meet you, Captain Rogers," said an older, grey-haired man wearing a white lab coat as he and a young woman with long red hair arrived outside the transparent window of Steve's cell. While three entire walls of the barely five metre by five metre cell were composed of solid concrete at least a metre thick, the entire front appeared to be a window. But despite its glass-like appearance, it was clearly made from a material that was not glass, as Steve was pretty sure that he had busted a couple of knuckles the one time he had attempted to punch through it.
"Don't talk to me right now, Steve," Tony snapped as he stared straight at Stane's impeccably dressed and groomed holographic image. "This isn't about me, and I'm not going anywhere."
Tony flinched at Steve's words, prompting Steve to reach for his hand, running the pad of his finger along Tony's wedding ring.
Tony smiled, reaching over to bop Peter on the nose. "If you can make it, I s'pose I can too, bud. But next year we're going to Italy instead. No more of this leaving one freezing cold place just to fly to another freezing cold place halfway around the world nonsense."
"Sir Buchanan?" Bucky said as Natasha let out a snort of laughter. "Where the hell did that come from?"
"Hopefully longer than a few years, hon," Tony cut in. "I'm personally hoping for a few generations."
"Ah, he'll be up for it," Carol said as she elbowed James in the arm. "He's pretty good at smooth-talking."
"Nah, I've got the next five songs already queued up, so I thought I'd come over and see how the commoners were doing," said Flash.
"She sure is," agreed Steve, and she truly was. Peter was indeed a very talented artist for such a young child, something that Steve could recognise as an amateur artist himself. But at the same time, Steve could understand why the boy's grandfather wasn't encouraging of his talent. Artists weren't exactly revered in Langara, a society that had become so entrenched in combat and strategy and just war in general, that things like art had long since fallen by the wayside.
Because that’s not what they do, right? They’re just friends, going to hang out and work on some school stuff, seeing that she doesn’t understand the subject and he’s probably the best of the class. That’s the only reason why she asked for his help, after all.
“Actually, I would be very interested in reading those. It’s really fascinating. Does your strength come close to Steve’s?”
Once they get to Times Square, a whole lot of people are already standing close together. They wait for the screens to light up. A helicopter flies over them, though to where, Peter has no idea.
He’s interrupted when he’s suddenly grabbed by the shirt and pulled up into the air. Then Flash moves forward until Peter’s back is against the wall. Great, this is exactly what Peter wanted to avoid.
And Tony? He decided to take a step back. Explained that he couldn’t do this anymore. Steve knew that he felt guilty about the whole Ultron-disaster, and he couldn’t really blame him. It was impossible to say Tony and Bruce weren’t responsible for it, but in the end, Steve felt like the entire team was in one way responsible.
Steve, though... Steve’s a bit vaguer on the matter. Though he insists that he’s fine, nothing in his past few activities indicate that he’s been alright the entire time. But Peter isn’t asking about it.
“We don’t want money,” Clint says, grin wide on his face. The others are laughing as well. Natasha is leaning against the counter, standing next to Bucky, who has his arm wrapped over her shoulder. They’re slowly becoming more and more affectionate, though they’re still keeping it subtle.
A weird atmosphere comes up when the adults reach them, taking place at the empty seats at their table. Peter’s glad he’s seated between MJ and Johnny, so he doesn’t have to be too close to Tony, who is seated at the far corner of the table, looking like he wants to be everywhere but here.
“They’re next on my tour,” he admits. “Though if anybody knows how I can reach the individuals like Daredevil or Spider-Man, that would be appreciated.”
He sighs, forgetting about going to the toilet after that. He looks at the bruise; it’s enormous. He rubs the spot for a moment, leaning back against the pillow and closing his eyes again.
And she knows, the Christmas of that same year, as she sees Tony in Steve’s embrace with Peter standing next to them, that she made the right decision.
And so, Tony starts explaining. He talks and talks, taking a couple of seconds once in a while to find his words. He notices Peter looking at him with hard, wet eyes, mouth stuck in that grim stance. And once he explains about everybody's deaths, Peter's death, Tony hears Peter gasp for air next to him, seeing him sitting there with tears in his eyes. It’s only then that Tony realizes he’s been crying as well.
Peter chuckles despite his position, liking this girl’s snark quite a lot already. Especially if it gets Flash speechless, she’s his second favorite girl right now. Of course, it goes without saying who comes first to Peter.
“Thanks,” Peter climbed out of bed, grunting a bit from being sore. Yaël nodded, watching him move carefully. Did he want her to help him or not? What did she need to do in such a situation? Maybe he’d rather get out of bed on his own, or maybe it’d be kind of her to support him or something… So instead of doing anything at all, Yaël kept staring at him awkwardly, relieved as he finally got out. Besides, that slight scruff he got going on was kind of fascinating. It had always been hard to imagine Peter with facial hair.
“Yes, sir! Thank you sir!” And with that, Peter hangs up, closing his locker again and starting to run towards his biology class.
One person looks up, and he nods. Then he stands up and starts walking to somewhere on his right. The guard motions for Tony and Bruce to follow him.
“Don’t worry, I’ll remind you to call her,” Charles said, taking account with how distracted and confused Yaël could be. The man also frequently reminded her of the stress-relieving exercises, like meditating, the psychiatrist told her to do, and because she sometimes felt uncomfortable or slightly ashamed for doing these; Charles made sure there was nobody going to bother her when she needed her minute alone.
“Lots and lots of food, but the only think I’m craving is a certain kind of super spider,” Harry mutters at him, chuckling crazily afterwards. Peter takes a step back away from him again, figuring it’s best to keep his distance.
“You, uh… you have a robot suit?” Steve asks in confusion. Tony raises an eyebrow, unbelieving that this is the first thing Steve would ask.
He struggles, fights to be freed, but the chute sticks to him like it’s afraid to let go. Realizing he needs to think
“You know, before I met Tony-“ he starts. Then somebody flushes the toilet, and Happy’s smile falls away from his face, shoulders suddenly tense. To make it even worse, the kid starts slowly washing his hands, not bothering to hurry despite Happy staring at him. When he finally leaves, Peter lets out a breath.
“Keep rolling, rolling, rolling,” Yaël hummed while pulling on the wheels of the wheelchair one of the Asgardians had fabricated for her. A towel, some fresh clothes and bandages and the cloak she had been gifted back on Sakaar were balancing on her lap.
After that, Yaël went back to her apartment. On her way back, she decided to get a sandwich, as it was already evening. Yet again, the moment she walked into the sandwich shop, people looked up and weren’t able to keep their eyes from her. If this kept going on, she’d be painting her hair back to her natural color: dark-brown.
But images of a lifeless Peter comes back into his mind, and Tony shakes his head. He opens his eyes again, looking into the city that never sleeps. There are cars everywhere, lights everywhere. There’s no rain tonight, neither will there be tomorrow.
Tony gives Peter a long look, still dumbfounded. But after a while, he smiles. He takes the few steps that separates him and his son, and puts his hand behind Peter’s head to give him a kiss in his hair.
“Why do you care about this loser?” Flash then suddenly asks, sounding literally confused about her trying to meddle. The girl simply shrugs.
“Do you resent me? For the kid-stuff?” Steve asks then, all of the sudden. There’s an obvious fear in his voice that gives Tony some shudders.
. Before he can get out, Steve grabs his hand and presses a kiss to his fingers. The other four people in the room groan out while shielding their eyes.
Yaël took the brush while smirking at Steve. He was always thinking about training her in all possible ways.
“No way,” he mutters, too shocked by the revelation. He doesn’t let go of his painful grip, instead staring unbelievingly at the man in front of him. Seeing the guy’s eyes, he remembers the guy had been wearing sunglasses that evening. Peter never got to see the green color in them.
“You know, I find it funny that I found you in Queens; by the way, it’s where FRIDAY found you on the camera’s the most frequently.”
How did he even get here? Didn’t he get a ‘babysitter’ all the time? Is there somebody waiting for them outside? Probably Steve, no?
Coming to read up about a certain Helmut Zemo – another link to Sokovia, of course – Tony is already on the chopper that leads him to the Raft. He knows the Avengers are stuck in there – not his idea, more Ross’ – and he just needs a moment alone with one of them. He knows Clint is not going to talk – he’s too much of a child for that. Wanda… doubtful. Despite the fact that they manage to work together just fine, Wanda never really seemed to be trusting Tony at all. The shrinking dude, Tony simply doesn’t know. They’ve never introduced themselves to each other – more pressing matters at the time.
“Uh, I didn’t. I left it in my bedroom. I don’t carry it along as much since FRIDAY usually lets me in.”
Right, he should get that DNA sample for her so they can do the test right away. Then, before he gets out, he turns back around again, lifting up the sleeve from his suit.
Tony turns around, giving Steve a smirk, actually impressed. “Did you just make a suicide-joke? I didn’t think you had it in you, dear.”
“It would be funny for all of us, since Bruce shouldn’t be drunk, I can’t get drunk and neither can Hilde, Steve or Nat,” Bucky adds to it with his arms crossed. Natasha then suddenly comes back into the room, her hair put up in a messy bun.
A fight?! Tony shoots up from where he’s seated, already marching out of the wagon in record time. It helps to have a little more space if he wants to have a conversation like this.
“Lov’ya guys,” Peter mutters, that being the first thing he says after waking up. Tony decides to just try it anyway.
“Uh, Thor, just how long are your vows?” Steve asks when he notices the amount of papers on there. There must be about 10 pages or so of fully written text, noted down in Thor’s neat handwriting.
Peter’s watched a lot of superhero movies in his childhood. The hype for him mostly started with his parents showing him cartoons of the Justice League fighting their way to peace. Peter’s favorite character had been the Batman; he was just an ordinary guy, using tech to fit the team.
they’re talking about. There’s no way a kid can get through that, no matter if they’re sharing the same DNA.
“You don’t have to help me, you know?’ Yaël knew him well enough to notice he wasn’t in a talkative mood, which happened sometimes, mostly when something troubled his mind, as he didn’t answer her, but instead reached his hand to her so he could guide her back to her chair.
“Can I get a lift down? I don’t really want to waste an arrow right now,” he says, trying to lighten up the conversation again. Peter crosses his arms and raises an eyebrow, even though Hawkeye can’t really see that.
There’s a long silence in the elevator. Tony has a strong urge to bring up a casual conversation, get Steve to talk, but he knows he’s already pretty much on thin ice here. For no obvious reason, Steve is helping him out here. He shouldn’t push his luck.
As it is, the current team consists of Carol, Vision, Clint and Kate, Scott and Hope, Peter (whenever he’s nearby) and Harry – that last one being much to everybody’s surprise back when the kid revealed that he wanted to join.
Despite that, despite the fact that the date wasn’t so bad, and Steve had found himself enjoying it, he just didn’t feel it. In turn, Steph seemed to sense his hesitation as well. After he drove her home, she told him she’d see him sometimes at SHIELD perhaps. The way she spoke made it clear that she was not expecting much else from him, much to his relief.
A few desks away from him, Flash – with now a very black eye – is throwing spit-balls at Peter’s head. So far, Peter hasn’t reacted to it. He knows that if he would open his mouth, it could be used against him. It’s probably better to just ignore it and wait for detention to be done with.
Aunt Sharon says that she used to give him a good drink, but that it’s not a possibility anymore. She, too, is in search for something else. Rhodey suggests raiding through the workshop for a bit until he comes across anything.
“Wanda? What about Wanda?” Steve asks in confusion, and Tony thought Steve knew. But of course they haven’t been in contact, and all Tony has done is getting phone calls and answering them. Of course Steve doesn’t know about what instructions Tony got when it came to Wanda.
“Lopt, it’s pretty damn hot in here.” Yaël looked at her other self and saw a drip of sweat roll over her chalk-white cheek. She looked miserable!
“Uh, what is this?” Peter asks. It looks like some sort of shirt that seems way too big for either of them. There’s some sort of sensor in the middle, but the use of that isn’t clear at all.
Peter shrugs, turning around to walk back into the apartment. He doesn’t even bother to be quiet for Johnny’s sake – knowing him, he sleeps through an entire invasion.
“I’ll check at the apartment,” Rhodey says before turning around and getting out of the bathroom. Tony protests when Pepper starts pulling on his pants to get them down.
“Follow me,” Mr. Stark instructs once again. Peter sees how the man is slowly making his way towards his work bench, where something that looks an awful lot like the Iron man gauntlet is lying on the wooden table. “Now, Mr. Parker. Last time I was on the field, my repulsor failed and I missed a shot. I’ve already looked at the problem, but haven’t taken care of it yet.” With that, Mr. Stark holds up his wounded hand and just shrugs.
“STOP!” Hela growled, making another spear that flew right through Yaël’s hand. Yup, she was going to die. There was no fucking way she’d survive all the blood loss Hela had caused.
Like this, he could easily jump down until he was on Mr. Stark’s floor. Of course, he knows he’s not going to. Instead, he sits down on the edge, swinging his feet down and lying back down on the ground. His eyes are open, looking at the clouds painting the sky. His heart is still beating too fast, and he knows his hands are still shaking.
“God damn it, Peter, let’s go!” Peter screened the place too, jumped up and put on his coat. As soon as they were out, Yaël snorted. “Jeez, Peter, we sounded like a married couple in there!”
Brunnhilde ran towards Hela and pinned her down with her sword easily as Hela was finally distracted enough, followed by Thor, who broke down a piece of the bridge by using his lighting. Hela tumbled down into the water, which Yaël immediately started freezing down to keep Hela in the water, trying to not get distracted by her shaking fingers. It was too hard, but heck, she was still breathing so she had to be able to do it.
When the ambulance stopped in a big garage, leading to the compound, a few health caretakers rolled the stretcher she was laying on inside and drove her to what looked like an operation room. There she was greeted by a doctor who introduced herself as Dr. Cho. Wade waited outside.
True, whenever things are boring or just plainly have nothing to do with him, he tends not to listen. But more often than not, he’s giving it all his attention despite not looking like he’s doing it. Especially when people are talking about things they’re passionate about; things they’ve been wanting to do, but haven’t found any chance to do it.
“ESU,” Peter answers, giving Felicia a fond look. “Johnny and I were lost, we didn’t know were to go. She showed us the way.”
So while Peter slumps towards the kitchen to get a glass of water, he almost jumps into the air when there’s a knock on the door.
Just to keep you informed: tomorrow, kalkoekvsneoklak and I are going on a vacation for a few weeks.
Deciding to just do it, Peter presses his thumb against the screen, sliding the green button to the left. Then he pulls the phone up to his ear.
And Peter smiles sadly. “To you, yes. To other people, no. I’m just another human being who is getting the inevitable,” he continues. He squeezes his dad’s hand. “Dad, I know you’re going to be doing some crazy shit to get me out of this. I’m asking you not to. Don’t risk the universe for me.”
“Thanks pal, I should be on my way again,” the guy says, though he’s still hunched forward like he’s in pain.
“You dress up nicely,” Natasha says the moment Tony walks into the living quarters. Sam, Rhodey and Wanda are seated on the couch, looking at the television. Clint and Vision are playing some pool, while Nat is seated at the bar, enjoying some sort of cocktail she must have brewed herself.
“The King and Princess of Wakanda are up, or did you forget they were coming today?” Rhodey asks. Great, he sounds just the way Steve sounds when he’s disappointed in something. Peter can’t really bother with that today.
“Then you’re as much an idiot as I am,” Tony quickly counters. The two men chuckle nervously, but neither relax. Tony sits down on the bed, motioning for Steve to do the same. The other man complies, and takes place on the mattress, a good distance from Tony.
And for the first time ever Tony manages to smile to the man next to him. He holds out a hand and rests it on Wade’s shoulder, squeezing it gently.
Tony sleeps in the plane. He’s tired, exhausted from the day. First all the arrangement at the school, then the ferry… Tony’s feeling like he’s been flying around in circles today. Even now, just to be sure, he has a suit in the plane, easy to access. He doesn’t want to chance another situation where he can’t fly anywhere because he’s missing one.
“So, eh, now we know what happens if we trigger that girl a bit too much. I’ll call her The Bomb, because of multiple reasons! Now, who’s next!” The noise of enthusiasm was still following her. Was Loki cheering too now?
“If you want to visit her on your own, fine. But if Peter tells me now that he wants to meet her, I’m not keeping my son from the chance of going there,” Tony says with a strangely bitter voice. Peter swallows, hating to be suddenly pulled into this argument. Especially when the two men then turn their heads towards him.
The girl seems to notice this. A little worried, she walks up to him, waving a hand in front of his eyes.
“Huh, you sound surprised I’d even ask that,” the Cat returns. “That must mean you’re still young, which isn’t that surprising given the fact that you just sounded like a girl on a rollercoaster.”
But with any other person… he doesn’t. And when he saw the footage of himself with Felicia, things he didn’t remember even doing… Peter can’t help but feel disgusted at every bit of it that reminds him of… sex. Damnit…
The last thing Peter expects to show up from the fog of dust is Wade. Even less a Wade wearing the school’s cheerleading uniform and jumping up high in the air with pompoms while he tries to evade somebody.
“Seriously, Dad, Pepper’s gonna kill you if you’re not there. It’s only a few hours, then we can watch this guy here on the TV, okay?”
It says nothing more. Tony hesitates a bit before reaching out for the mouse, and then he starts moving it around to check if it still works. When he cursor on the screen moves, he lets out a triumphant sound.
The coach invites him back in with open arms, and before Peter knows it, with barely any baggage with him, he’s on the bus on his way to Washington, being questioned by Liz who is trying to keep everybody sharp.
They get to breakfast, and they’re greeted by all the other Avengers as well as the Guardians. Everybody looks absolutely stunning – except for Stephen and Wong, who look almost exactly the same with their robes. Natasha’s red hair has been put up with what looks like hundreds of braids and pearls. She has red earrings that go perfectly with the black dress she’s wearing. It’s a great homage to her uniform, with small blue lines on them and red ornaments. Her cape is dark red, but not the same color as Steve’s or Peter’s.
“The only reason why you left Sakaar is because you want your brother to keep on loving you, even though disappointing him is your favourite hobby! Yet, you keep on trying to act too cool for your family’s recognition!”
“Simple, I want you,” the Cat returns. “I’ve been observing you, keeping an eye on you. You’re a good person, always trying to help people. And next to that, you’re smoking hot.”
His phone buzzes in his pants. He quickly dives into his pocket, finding that he has a message from Harry
Suddenly, the screen starts shaking until the two boys have disappeared from view and suddenly Strange stands there on the other side.
FRIDAY tells him, apologetic. Peter sighs. So he made the journey for nothing. Ah, well, since there’s nobody here other than the doctors, Peter figures he might as well take another look at how Harry’s doing.
“I’m not trying to kiss you!” Wade returns. “I want to know if you’ve seen Yaël! Drinking’s been lonely without her.”
“Besides, do you think they’re taking you seriously with the ‘couple of the year’ thing going on?” Rhodey asks.
“Hmm, doesn’t sound too bad,” Johnny breathes out, resting his head back and smiling. Meanwhile, Tony marches up to them, putting his hands on his hips while he looks at the teenagers (most of them, at least) around him.
“Ah, well, only trying to do my duty, ma’am,” Steve jokes, giving her a wink. May laughs again, and for a moment, Peter is reminded of a time where May used to have a crush on Captain America. If only her past self could see her now, joking along with the man while also dating one of his colleagues.
“Falcon tumbled down,” Steve answered. Yaël looked back while wobbling behind her friend. Falcon was still fighting the Goblin. Then she checked on Peter again. He laid in the grass, coughing out some water.
Peter pulls his hands back, pushing his fingers into his mouth and sucking on his fingers. Tony blinks when his son starts drooling all over his arms.
The ex-boyfriend groans again, pulling Peter out of his train of thought. He hurries towards the guy, leaning down but making a move to help him up.
For some reason, though, Otto seems to want to use an AI to help him along. And while Tony is all for AI’s (If JARVIS, FRIDAY and Karen aren’t enough clarification for that), he never really trusts them with other people. His heart skips a quick beat, a sudden worry coming over him.
“Steve, hold on a minute,” Tony mutters out. He removes the suit and crawls only slightly closer to where Steve is seated.
As her wounded hand refused to stop aching, Yaël had to wander around, mostly in circles, using only one hand, while humming a bit.
It’s by the time that he gets to the second book – yes, he’s finished the first one already – that there’s a first mention of his father, who by that time already worked at Oscorp.
“You know, honey, I get why you went to see him. He was your friend and you just don’t want to give up on him, do you?”
“Wait, I’ll come for you later, you gave me your address!” Jeremy said to Yaël with a ridiculous looking playful smile.
With that thought, Tony turns his head towards Steve, staring at him with his mouth fallen open. Peter makes him happy.
In the complete darkness, someone managed to find her hand and pull her out. As soon as Yaël was somewhat freed from the mud, she looked into X’s eyes.
Strange warns them when he activates the eye. Green light emerges from his hands, but nothing really seems to change. That is, until something invisible lifts Peter back up, and brings him back through the portal they came through.
“Eh, yeah, that’s a given I suppose,” he admits as if it isn’t that big of a deal. Peter unknowingly takes a step forward. Harry’s eyes widen a bit at that, but he doesn’t mention it at all. “So what do I earn the pleasure of your visit? Gossip? Tears? Mutual plans of destroying the world and make it
“No, no no!” he calls out in a faked panic, and once more, the two of them start laughing. Tony feels light inside, with something feeling like luck welling in his chest. His lips seem to be going permanently upward. His heart is beating faster as he sees Peter there next to Dum-E, protesting when Dum-E takes the piece of paper from him and starts rolling off – copying Peter.
Natasha stays silent for a few seconds. Then she turns towards somebody behind her, saying something that sounds a lot like ‘go faster’. When she turns back to him, it’s with that sad smile he’s tired of getting.
“Mr. Stark’s here?” Peter asks a little louder than he’d expected. His eyes are resting on the familiar figure standing in the hallway and currently talking to Cap. He’s a bit too far away to see it clearly, but he looks extremely tired. His hair’s messy, and the clothes he’s wearing look like he’s been sleeping in them.
“Thor and Jane are getting married,” Steve explains then. “Jane is pregnant, and they want to get everything in order before the kid is born.”
Surely, there aren’t a lot of people he knows, but it would surely beat staying at home for the evening, right?
When she woke up again, the whole arena was filled with blood. The dust colored red and the walls had big spats on them. There was nothing left from the man that had been holding her head. Yaël felt like she had to puke, but she didn’t even get the chance. The audience, that had been quiet for a little, suddenly burst into screams and applause. They seemed to be happy with the result. Their noise drummed into Yaël’s ears.
Peter pushes himself from the ground, turning around to face Mr. Stark. But all he sees is Harry, staring at him with a huge grin on his face, mocking him as he grieves. He shakes his head and takes a step back. This isn’t real, he tells himself. He knows it isn’t real. Harry isn’t here – the
“So this woman sends you to a complete different planet, just to find me? How did you even manage to do that? There are more than seven billion people on earth!” Nilla straightened her back and casually cracked her fingers. She would’ve been beautiful if she wasn’t so brainwashed and crazy.
“Oh, you know, going back in time. Had a little chat with the mother of my son. Switched out some blood samples. The usual.” Tony waves off his own comment as if they’re not really that important. Now it’s Strange who looks like he’s just seen a ghost.
“Even more drugs for me, huh? I’m taking enough of them as we speak,” Tony mutters bitterly. “Besides, I’m fine.”
Peter is put in front of a mystery. He’s asked Ned, Harry, even MJ. None of them came up with a good response. A Spa day? A new tie? A goddamn watch? No way, that’s just lame, after all!
“I suppose I’m just an idiot,” he says, tapping the dashboard lightly as he steps out. He’s not wearing a tie, but he’s still wearing a vest above the dark grey shirt. As he walks, he passes his hands over it to clear them out, making sure that his collar is still in place and his shirt is tucked back into his pants. The cuffs of his shirt are still buttoned together.
Remembering how everybody would be training outside when Peter arrived, Peter now feels something hollow coming across an empty field. There’s no Natasha to greet him. No Steve to slap him on his back and laugh at his stupid jokes. There’s no Clint, whose humor is even worse than Peter’s.
“TONY TURN DOWN THAT ALARM DAMN IT!” Rhodey shouts as well. Then, as if on cue, the alarm stops at last.
“Tony… why did you call me ‘honey’?” Steve asks, feeling his heart ache instantly. Besides, what’s this about being back home in no time? From what he read, he thought it was pretty serious?
Peter holds up his thumb before leaving the lab. After grabbing his earbuds again and putting up a catchy song, Peter gets into the elevator the moment it arrives. Now that he’s fully clothed, of course it stops nowhere at all but the floor where he needs to go; the main floor. He clears his throat, hides his badge away in the pocket of his coat, and he starts heading towards the exit.
“Yeah, you made that very clear. Which is why I haven’t seen you in the past twenty years,” he returns bitterly. That seems to throw her off. She opens the door a bit more to lean against it. It’s an obvious sign that she wants to keep him out, which he understands.
So Peter starts running as fast as he can, and while his lungs are hurting or his entire body is hating himself right now for doing so much effort, he keeps on going.
Peter doesn’t say anything, only pointing towards Mr. Stark and then shrugging to indicate he doesn’t know what’s going on. Steve puts his sketchbook away carefully and then stands up again.
“Eh, it’s not the worst, but it needs some fixing-up before you can go live in it again,” Peter admits. “But it’s okay, Dad’s freeing up a few floors for you guys.”
Tony doesn’t care if he’s impolite. He needs an out, just for right now. He needs a moment to himself with no other human around him.
She laid down on the fluffy rug with her cello and started tuning on the strings. After she fiddled with the instrument for a while, she got up and got a book and a blanket and installed herself in her sofa.
Crap, his reflexes hit immediately, making him jump to the right, though not fast enough. The gun grazes over his shoulder, drawing blood and tearing through his suit.
“What word would you use, Mr. Secretary?” she asks. Even from how she speaks, Tony can hear the slight smile on her face. Rhodey lowers his head for a bit before stretching his neck. Vision lifts his hand up to his chin to rub his skin in a strangely human gesture.
“Nah,” he mutters. “I don’t think the world needs more near-death experiences if any of those drawings would end up in the wrong hands.” Miles shudders at the reminder of the world-wide disasters that have happened already in his life. The attack on New York, Sokovia, that time a giant space-ship appeared above the city and took away a weird wizard… Heck, he even learned from Peter and MJ that that one huge storm cloud that hung over the city was actually a huge being called Galactus that was intending on eating the planet. They should thank the Fantastic Four for that one…
As he looks up in the sky, he sees Iron Man’s mask in front of him. What is Mr. Stark thinking there, underneath that face-plate? Underneath that permanent angry look of gold and red. Is he scared? Is he relaxed, having done this many times before? Is he angry at Peter for not getting inside sooner?
“What? Why not?” Peter interrupts. “If it’s because of what happened today, I swear it won’t happen again! I just… I got so angry but I understand now that I need to listen to you-“
Come on, Yaël, she thought to herself, grow up, you’re over two-thousand years old, no reason to feel emotional for something like this. She ignored the fact that being two-thousand years was still very young on Helvegen. Luckily Peter didn’t notice her sucking up some feelings, because he threw her a smile and nodded.
“You see here? You select the date you want to travel to. Could be the future, could be the past. Then once you’ve selected a date you press this button here.” Wade shows him which button he needs to push. Tony nods in understanding.
“The queen told me you were unkillable. I could only hurt you badly, which I tried to do. Well, it somehow worked out too, but not totally by my doing. What a shame.” What was that girl’s problem?
Not all the Avengers are currently in the Quinjet. Steve had assured them all that they should stay there and enjoy the break for a bit. Asgardian food is
“No, no I’m fine. It’s all just… Aunt May asked me to be home tonight,” he lies easily. It wouldn’t be fair to Wanda to say that it’s just driving him crazy to stay here when she can’t get out at all. They don’t need to know he’s going to spend his evening doing what he feels is the right thing to do; being Spider-Man.
Steve raised an eyebrow, but couldn’t help the smile that ran over his face. He stood up and took the empty plates to the sink. Yaël helped him.
“Yes, I wish I was the one who’d let it explode, but this friend of yours was a very unexpected turn to my plan.”
“C’mon! I can handle this, guys! Besides, you’re already two men short now! Just let me help,” Peter pleads, putting his hands together as if he’s praying. Tony can’t see his face underneath the mask, but he can just as well imagine the expression he’s giving.
“Oh, T’Challa is like that, too, sometimes,” Nakia returns. Tony shakes his head and frowns at her. “I mean with the dealing with his problems by himself-part. The kicking me out-part he hasn’t even dared to try, yet.”
Mr. Stark asks questions. A lot of them, mostly about hypothetical situations and how Peter would act in them. Somewhere in the beginning of the interview, the woman called Rosaly Terrence starts cleaning up his wounds while the two keep on talking. After ten minutes, she leaves again.
Helen Cho is quite a friendly woman, and not quite uneasy on the eyes either, if Peter would have had a thing for older women. Her long black hair is neatly tied back into a ponytail and her face looks calm while concentrated. Peter feels safe with her, which is something because otherwise he wouldn’t have let her see so much of him. Luckily, there’s something called patient confidentiality, and he’s quite sure she’s following that one thoroughly.
Yaël breathed on deeply and rubbed the palm of her hands against each other. It had been a long time since she had done this, from before the accident. She sped up and as she breathed out again, she opened her hands. At that exact moment she steered a massive amount of fire against the glass wall.
But, they told Tony to do one thing, and he needs to see this through. Because if he doesn’t, Peter will become part of a whole system Tony desperately wants to keep him out of.
“Surprise!” they exclaim. Slapping Tony lightly on the shoulder, they make their way inside, surprising literally everybody in the room.
Tony hated his body after the surgery. He had so much trouble even looking at himself, disgusted by the scars he’d gotten only by his own doing. But while Tony hated it so much, Steve only loved him even more for it.
The closer Yaël got to the cottage, the older it started to look, but also well maintained. Someone had taken care of all those flowers around the small building. Someone must’ve painted these shutters a thousand times and someone must’ve spend hours of keeping the ivy, curling up against the walls, in control.
With a lot of grunting and cursing, they’re all in the elevator with enough tables and chairs – they hope. They might have raided Bruce’s floor to get to it, but they did what was asked of them. Once the elevator announces their arrival, George quickly comes to their aid to open the door. Sam and Happy help out as well, while the others shift the table further into the room to make place. Pepper and May are busy getting the plates, while Natasha starts searching for more glasses.
“So, how’s the girls’ dormitory?” he asked curiously. Because families got rooms apart, and because there was a shortage of seperate bedrooms, Thor had to make the decision to put the rest of the men and women in huge dorms.
Miles enters the subway. Heading towards Harlem with headphones safely put upon his ears, he looks down at his phone to check the latest news. Disaster-wise, not much has been happening. There haven’t been any reports of the Avengers being called on scene, which is probably good. The ‘smaller’ heroes who limit themselves to saving a city rather than the world stay busy, though. There’s been a report of Dr. Octopus escaping prison once again, and it had been everybody’s surprise when Electro re-emerged last year and still hadn’t been totally taken care of. Next to that, Miles remembers being terrified when a hulk-like Russian guy that called himself Rhino came up on the scene and nearly destroyed Midtown. Sure, school had been cancelled for the days that reparations were needed, but having your life down the line like that never really felt good.
Tony opens his eyes again despite the ache that comes with it and finds Brunnhilde standing there with her hands on her hips, looking down unimpressed.
“O-okay! I’m making a call as well.” But then the phone falls from his shoulder, on the ground. Peter curses, but he can’t stop the car to pick it back up. Not right now at least.
should lecture me about healthy marriages. After all, isn’t yours pretty much breaking apart right now?”
“Hey!” Wade yelled as his army of ducks swam off panicky, shocked by the stone. Yaël and Peter simply ignored him.
“If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it, okay?” he says. God, he sounds like his dad.
“I’ll be back,” he assures them. “Just going out for a walk, you two just… do whatever you need to do. But… please, buy a new couch afterwards.”
As it turns out, I'm only getting sicker. I was about ready to head to bed until I realized I hadn't posted this one yet. So, here we go!
“Seems like we have company!” The Goblin suddenly shouts, and Peter dares to turn his head to the side. He’s proven right when he can see a glimpse of Iron Man following them.
“Oh, I didn’t hear that last part,” Tony says out loud, now this time actually earning a glare from Pepper. He ignores it, instead leaning back in his seat.
“Looks like we’re both hopeless when it comes to the matters of the heart,” Natasha answers. Tony wonders what she means with that, but he already knows that asking will earn him nothing but silence and more questions, still. She’s probably talking about a time before they met her.
“Good!” she said. She just wanted to make a good impression towards the man she saw as the big chief. She wanted him to like her. Unlike Fury, who she sneakily liked triggering from time to time even though she always ended up with some kind of punishment.
“Mr. Stark! We’re so sorry! We didn’t know this would happen!” Johnny says, clearly panicking, as he’s holding a tiny, naked baby in his hands. The baby is squirming, kicking its feet with his eyes squeezed shut. Crying, filling the room with its high-pitched shriek that makes Tony wonder if that’s why his father didn’t really like him in the workshop.
in my world, but I am content. I am in love, and I am loved by somebody in return. And, yeah, I have my mental illnesses and my panic attacks, and I might chase the other you off sometimes in my bad moments, but… in the end, Steve always comes back to me, and I always come back to him.”
"See, I told you he was just sleeping—" Howard started, his mouth snapping closed when Tony shoved past him and into the living room, grabbing the telephone.
And then, only a few seconds after Steve had emerged back inside the planet's atmosphere, all hell suddenly broke loose. That yellow beam—the trajectory of which he was too upset to calculate at the moment but had definitely come from Meridian airspace—had been so unnaturally bright that it had temporarily blinded him, forcing him to rely on JARVIS to prep his aircraft for landing. Steve had barely been able to regain enough of his eyesight in time to actually land, something he had never before experienced.
"It's gonna be okay, Buck. You're gonna be okay," Steve murmured as he carefully laid him down, stepping back to allow Sam to take his place at Bucky's side.
"Maybe," said Steve. "But based on what you've told me about the armament that group was packing, I'm not sure if we would've been able to get you both out alive. You said they had enough of your weapons to supply a small country."
"Yeah, um… hi, Captain Rogers," Scott said, giving Steve a rather awkward wave. "And Agent Romanoff, I've—I've heard a lot about you too."
from down a hall somewhere, followed by the groaning sound of a door opening and then two sets of footsteps, one heavy and one lighter. Peter slowly raised his head as the footsteps came to a halt outside of his cell, the outlines of a man dressed in a fancy suit and a young woman with long red hair visible through the glass window.
"Uh, who is it?" he called. Maybe one of the cadets had just gotten lost or something. It happened sometimes.
"Yeah." Tony rubbed at his scratchy eyes as Steve got up from the bed, pulling on his t-shirt as he shuffled barefoot out of the room. His heart was still racing, with pain radiating from his left forearm up to his shoulder and across his chest, almost like he was being electrocuted. Helen Cho had explained that he had likely sustained some nerve damage the time he got knocked by the fighter jet somewhere over Afghanistan way back when, but Tony didn't have time to dwell on his pain now. He needed to get ready for what lay ahead.
why none of my towels can actually dry anything anymore," Mr Harrington was mumbling under his breath as they all exited the gym once practise was over. "I thought the water at my house had gone funny or something, you should've heard the earful I gave to the water company over Christmas break. Oh boy, did they hear it from me!"
With a final nod, Wanda trotted off as Peter headed for the huge, arena-like area, his eyes widening in shock as one of the Hammer suits flew by him, repulsors aimed and firing right at Dad's heels, the left of which was sputtering slightly. He quickly launched a web, grabbing the suit around its ankle and digging his heels into the hard concrete floor.
"Stop it, Flash!" Gwen said, her green eyes bright with anger even as she glanced worriedly at Peter. "You're just being mean! You know Peter didn't have a choice to go to that safehouse last year, so why don't you just shut up about things that you don't understand!"
"You can't tell Colonel Rhodes that I told you, all right?" Uncle Bucky finally said. "I don't want Sam getting into any trouble because of something I did."
Peter woke with a start, swallowing frantically against the horrible tickle in the back of his throat as he reached for the glass of water on the bedside table.
A knock on his door caused his head to snap up. "Come in?" he said eagerly. Dad had said that he would try to come and—
Howard flinched as the overhead lights suddenly cut out, plunging the entire house into near-pitch darkness. With a muffled curse he opened the top drawer of his desk, rummaging around until he located the small handlamp that Maria had purchased for him during her last shopping trip. The Langaran government had been issuing repeated alerts for the last two weeks, warning the continent's citizens that due to the ongoing energy crisis following the destruction of the main power plant six weeks prior that it would be instituting rolling blackouts. They had even included a schedule of the areas to be affected and when, but, as he usually did with anything government-related, Howard had simply chosen to ignore it, preferring not to be reminded of the day that his young son almost died on the operating table.
Peter bit his lower lip, his fingertips tapping along the edge of the datapad as he tried to force his exhausted mind to think. He had skipped one of his naps that afternoon since he'd been too nervous to try and sleep, and as much as he hated to admit it, he was definitely feeling it now. His arms and legs felt like they'd been filled with sand, and his lungs felt heavy and wet, like they needed to be wrung out.
At least Dad had finally called him, right before his supposed bedtime. He hadn't told Peter anything that he didn't already know, and the intense worry in Dad's voice had nearly shattered Peter's already busted-up heart, but it was still good to at least hear his voice, to know that he was doing whatever he could to help Papa get home.
But Steve absolutely loved Tony's scar, and told him so every chance that he got. He loved how it was a physical reminder of Tony's resilience and tenacity. Tony had told Steve that he'd almost died during his surgery when the power plant was destroyed and the whole country went dark, and yet somehow, against nearly overwhelming odds, he managed to survive.
"It's definitely a long shot," Tony said after a short pause. "And I'm not even sure if we should attempt it, 'cause if it doesn't work then we'll probably wind up with even bigger problems than we've already got, but—"
The light had barely faded when Steve blinked and suddenly Tony and Peter were there, standing in his cell, with Tony wearing his armour and Peter dressed in his Spider-Man suit. Steve gasped, clutching his side as he got to his feet, trying to ignore the searing pain in his ribs and crushed foot as he held out his arms towards his beloved husband and son.
"Tony!" Steve cried just as Tony arrived at the aircraft, a pathetic sound that nearly tore Tony's heart right down the middle. He was so weak that he could barely move as the medics unbuckled his harness and lifted him from the cockpit, their family picture clutched in one hand. "Tony, where—where are you?"
"Natasha, you have to be getting tired and hungry," Steve said as soon as the door latched closed. "And Bruce, you as well. Why don't you let me take Peter now so you guys can get some rest?"
"Yeah," Steve whispered, no longer able to stop the tears snaking their way down his cheeks. At James's encouraging nudge, Steve swiped at his nose and looked down at his feet, willing them to take the steps necessary to get himself back onto the jet.
"You didn't do anything wrong, Ma," Steve murmured as he carefully patted her back. "Tony and I don't blame you for anything."
"Um… is that normal?" Peter asked after a short pause when no parent came running to make sure that no one was dead or bleeding or something. There was no way either Dad or Papa would ever not investigate if Peter had happened to shriek like that at home. No possible way.
Arriving at the building, Steve swipes his ID card at the electronic lock and opens the door, heading up the three flights of stairs to his office area.  As soon as he steps inside, he’s hit with the strong scent of jasmine, the tea blend that Natasha enjoys with the blini she picks up at the Russian bakery every morning on her way in.  He smiles slightly as he says hello to Lorraine, their administrative assistant, and heads over to his cubicle in the corner, setting his backpack down on the floor next to his chair.
And himself, of course, even if he wouldn't currently call the horror-induced haze he was in 'living'.
"I never said it was normal!" Peter snapped, throwing a quick glance at Gwen's partially opened door. When no footsteps came running to investigate, he sucked in a deep breath, squeezing his hands into fists as he tried to calm down. "I never said any of this was normal. My family's about as not-normal as you can get, but hey, most of the time I just roll with it. But tell me this: if it'd been your dad that HYDRA had taken, and you knew they were doing horrible things to him, and you also knew that you could help him, but that if you told anyone else it would put all of the rest of them in danger, wouldn't you have done the same thing?"
"Well, how does it look?" he asked, so sincerely that Tony had to bite back a laugh. He simply could not understand how Steve could not see how hot he was, and especially in a brand-new suit.
"No problem!" Peter said. He quickly slid a chair over next to the hologram, indicating for Bucky to sit down. Then he handed Bucky an extra pair of protective glasses and took Bucky's metal hand, bending his arm at the elbow to allow Tony to access the outside of it.
Nodding, Steve laid his head back down, sliding his leg across Tony's lap as Tony kissed the top of his head.
Only an hour or so after threatening to ground him until he was eighteen, Dad had pronounced him an official Avenger.
"Well, well, well," he said as he got to work repairing the gaping hole in front of him, quickly becoming engrossed in the familiar—and soothing—hissing sound of the blowtorch. For as long as Tony could remember, he had always channeled his anger and grief into either alcohol, sex, or work. And since there was no alcohol on the ship—or at least none that he saw—and sex was obviously out of the question, then work would have to do.
"Namibia?" Bucky said, confused. "Why would anyone attack there? Are they hiding some super-secret tech too or something?"
"Right now we don't really have a choice, Steve," said Natasha. "With the political environment the way it is we need to tread very carefully, and going through the proper channels is the best way to do that. That doesn't mean we can't keep our eye on stuff too, but for now it's best if we play by their rules."
They were silent on the drive back to the barracks, with Tony only releasing Steve's hand long enough to get into the car and back out of it. The weight of their combined worry was so crushing that it threatened to break them, their only hope of survival resting on the fact that they knew they were in this together.
"Hey guys!" Liz said. "I should've asked you this before you all left, but I'm having a party this Friday night and I was wondering if you wanted to come? It's not gonna be anything too fancy, just the Decathlon team and some other people from my class. There'll be pizza and chips and pop and stuff… anyway. You're all welcome to come if you want."
Okay, maybe "concerned" wasn't actually the right word. It was more like he was scared shitless. Tony's worst fear was that some threat would come along—
Besides Tony, of course. It had only taken Steve a few days to figure out just how much he could affect Tony with only a quick smile as he climbed down from his aircraft cockpit.
Sam jerked his head to the two huge pots of potatoes cooling on the stove. "Soon as those are mashed and the gravy's done simmering, we should be ready."
But even though they had resumed a semi-frequent intimate schedule since then, there was one thing that Steve still had yet to experience.  One thing that before Tony, he never would’ve even considered.
"Now, now, you're not blaming me for this whole mess again!" Peter heard Uncle Bruce call from somewhere inside the depths of the ship. "I didn't do anything! Wittingly or un!"
that you don't get a say in this," Tony snapped as he tore himself away, rubbing at the back of his neck. "I'm sorry, honey, I know that sounds, well…
"Then we'll have to figure out a way to get the stones Thanos already does have away from him," said Tony. "And once we've got 'em, we can stick 'em down a garbage disposal or something."
It was an image that, even almost four years later, he still couldn't shake no matter how hard he tried. And he had
Bruce let out an excited grunt as he finally located the part Tony had been coaching him to find for the last ten minutes. "Is this it?"
"Come in?" Papa said, his nervous face lighting up when Peter stepped inside. "Hey, little guy! Wow, don't you look sharp!"
"Captain Barnes's aircraft was attacked by an unknown energy beam just as it emerged from the atmosphere, sir," said JARVIS. "I am at this time unable to determine if—"
"Птер?" Uncle Bucky exclaimed as he came careening around the corner, narrowly avoiding being hit by one of the flying components as he skidded to a stop. "Holy shit, where'd you come from? Are you all right?"
"I see," said Mr Stacy. "So then I suppose you don't agree with the theory that if the Avengers hadn't managed to piss off the god or alien or whoever-the-hell-it-was that brought all those…
"Oh." Tony huffed out a sharp breath, slumping heavily onto the bed. The fact that another highly-regarded Air Corps pilot was encouraging Steve to try and date not only a civilian but a Stark was surprising, and didn't really fit at all with Tony's preconceived notions about pilots.
"Yes, sir. Several of the files were unfortunately damaged by the water, but there are a few that might be of use."
Even when Peter had been in the NICU as a baby he was still able to respond to Tony's voice and touch, but that time when he'd been comatose, that had been a whole new level of horror.
"Damnit, Steve, I'm ready!" Tony said on a gasp as Steve carefully worked him open, all the while pressing kisses to every available bit of flesh he could reach. "Please, baby, now you're just teasing me!"
"Naked," Tony added. He glided his fingers down Steve's neck to his right pec, brushing his thumb across his nipple as his lips attacked Steve's throat, kissing and nibbling across his Adam's apple. "It's the only way to get a completely accurate scan."
think you do.  So why don't you just see what happens, hmm?  Something tells me that you wouldn't be blushing all over the place if this Stark fellow hadn’t given you any reason to, so… just play it by ear, okay?  Maybe you’ll come to realise you’re more ready than you thought.”
"Hey, bud," said Tony, his expression revealing absolutely no hint of the fact that he was trailing his fingertips along Steve's inner thigh under the table. "What's up?"
“Mmm.  A guy, huh?” Dad asked as he pulled into the Tower garage.  “I figured it’d be some old granny-type lady who’d be the owner of something like that.”
"That's one!" he said as the van rounded another corner, with Peter just managing to avoid crashing into another mailbox. He launched another web at a passing lamppost in an effort to slow the van down, but the lamppost only bent under the combined force of the web and the van, and slammed down onto the street.
It took several heartbeats for Fury’s words to completely sink in.  Growing up with Howard Stark for a father, Tony had heard of HYDRA before, but only in that weird, disconnected way of someone who never believed they would ever have to deal with them.  Kinda like the mob.  Or some made-up supervillain like the Joker.
"Oh, thank God!" Tony knew Bucky would rather die than let anything happen to Peter, and Wanda was powerful as hell too.
They were also informed that it would be none other than Anthony Stark who would be overseeing those simulator sessions, which meant that Steve had to decide now whether or not he was going to try and pretend that Anthony didn't exist, or give into his growing curiosity and make an honest attempt to get to know him. He couldn't help but have noticed that as self-conscious and awkward as he'd been when they ran into each other the previous day, Anthony seemed to have been just as flustered.
“What—?” Obie managed to get out just as the door to his office flew open and Happy Hogan stepped inside.  He was followed in by Agent Carol Danvers, Rhodey’s new squeeze, and her partner, a guy who apparently only went by Agent Fury.
"All right!" the guy holding him called. "Everybody stay where you are, let's chill the eff out!" He pressed a button on the side of his head, causing his helmet to disintegrate as he pointed his blaster at Dad for a few seconds before returning it to Peter. "I'm gonna ask you this one time. Who the hell are you, and what the hell are you doing here?"
"I'm gonna take some to Dad now, okay, little guy?" Steve said. Tony had been napping the last time he'd checked on him, when he'd brought in the humidifier and VapoRub, and had woken only a few moments ago. His fever had spiked a bit while he'd been sleeping, but not high enough to worry Steve more than he already was.
Tony's lips twitched as his eyes bored into Steve's, as if searching for any possibility that he might be less than absolutely sure.
As soon as his tablet went blank Peter flopped back onto the bed, frustrated. It annoyed him so damn much that his dads still thought he was too young to know what was going on, especially since Uncle Sam had already told him that the drone had attempted to fire at something, so it wasn't just a glitch.
Anthony Stark would risk entrusting his young child with something that if discovered, would surely get him either fired or arrested. Or both.
"Not about that." Fury let out a sigh, rubbing at his temples. "I'm not sure if I should berate you or thank you for lobbing that Hank Pym issue our way. We've been trying to get our hands on that tech of his for years, but I'm not sure anyone's up for the headaches that are sure to come with trying to deal with him."
Of course, Steve can simply explain to Peter how to do all of those things, but if Peter is anything like Steve, then he would likely catch on a lot faster after seeing what Steve’s talking about in action.  Which means that unless Steve feels like coming up with some sorry excuse for why he can’t physically swim anymore, he’s going to have to do it.
Pursing his lips, Peter grabbed his notebook, rubbing at his sore nose as he began writing yet another set of code. In the end, Peter knew that it would really all come down to whether Papa would agree to go forward with the mission once he was told of its parameters, and based on how well he'd gotten to know Papa in the last few months, Peter had a strong feeling that Papa would do it, no matter what the potential consequences were. He was a military pilot, yes, and very much enjoyed being one, or at least he did most of the time. But meeting Peter and Dad had already changed him so much that now he wanted nothing more than to settle down with his family. He wanted what he had called "the quiet life", and Peter desperately wanted him and Dad to have it.
"Steve!" Tony shouted as he ran towards the aircraft, catching sight of his beloved just as the canopy popped open. Steve looked like he'd been to hell and back, with his pale cheeks all flushed and covered with stubble and partially-frozen sweat, but to Tony he was absolutely beautiful.
"Hold on, Joe, I've almost got him on missile lock!" shouted Chester Phillips, Joseph's other wingman as he flew past Joseph's left wing, ducking down underneath to come out behind him. Three seconds later another explosion rocked the aircraft, and Joseph watched through his canopy as the enemy plane impacted against the mountain in a burst of brilliant fireball.
"Yeah, yeah, okay. I was thinking, those glasses that Beck demonstrated, I think it might be possible to use those to sort of reverse the Winter Soldier programming in both Pete and Bucky." He held up his hand as Steve let out an excited gasp. "Now, before you go getting too excited, right now I can't think of a way to do that without actually saying all of the trigger words in sequence, and believe me, I've tried. But if I can get this thing to work the way that I think I can, once the words are spoken the device would just kind of neutralise them inside their subconscious, essentially removing HYDRA's influence."
"And you think one of these gems is located in Wakanda?" Steve asked as he drew Peter against his side. The fact that he was even hearing this conversation in the first place did not sit well with him at all, but it was too late to do something about it now.
Steve gasped as Tony broke away from his mouth to trail kisses down his cheek to his jaw, sucking gently on the super-sensitive spot just below his jawline. "Sweetheart, we don't—we don't—"
"Well, it's not gonna be normal anymore," Peter said firmly. "Not after Papa and Auntie Carol get back from their mission."
"Are you sure your dads will let you go, though?" Gwen asked, rather pointedly. "That's probably the bigger question."
"Yeah, I've heard that," said Peter. "Nothing like the two most powerful countries in the world acting like a couple of toddlers fighting over a toy, hmm?" Papa had said something to that effect when he was helping Peter research for his own essay on the Iran Contra Affair.
They had to win this battle first, which, from the looks of it, was going to be the largest that Steve had ever fought.
"Nah, just tired," Peter answered, rubbing his temples. "I met the new girl, she's in the Academic Decathlon with us too."
"Yeah, I might know a bit of what that's like," Natasha said with a slight smile. "And then you started your HYDRA campaigns."
"Well, I'm up for it either way," Tony continued. "Just let me know the dates once you have them so I can tell Pepper when we'll be gone."
"Of course I'm sure," Tony softly answered. He ground his hips down against Steve's, the friction of their hard cocks sliding together almost enough to make Steve climax right then and there. "I love you, honey. And I'm sorry—"
"I've already watched one dictator's rise to power, and I'll be damned if I'm going to watch another," Steve concluded. "And I hate to have to say it, but all the signs are there, and it might just wind up being up to us to prevent history from repeating itself."
“No, it’s not,” answers Steve.  “Tony’s just entered the building, but… he seems to have vanished somehow.  I've got no eyes on him at all.”
He arrived panting and sweating to find the entire team minus Thor assembled in the lab, all crowded around Bruce's workstation. Thor had been summoned back to Asgard a couple of days ago in order to deal with yet another incident involving his brother, promising to return as soon as he could.
"Oh, God!" Steve rasped, squeezing his eyes closed as the tears streamed down his cheeks. This was his worst fear coming true, right in front of his eyes. He had always known that there was no way Tony would have left the Afghanistan desert if Peter hadn't survived, had always known how much of Tony's happiness was tied to their precious boy's life.
"I'm so sorry!" she exclaimed. "Mom always says that peppermint helps calm your stomach if you're feeling sick, but I suppose that wouldn't work too well if you're allergic to it!"
"And that's not right," Peter said. "Especially not since the entire country was thrown into crisis. But none of that was my grandpa's fault either. Or my dad's, or mine. But we were all still blamed for it." He didn't add that in addition to Papa's papa, there were also hundreds of other people who were killed on that day. No sense in peeling the scab off a barely-healed wound.
Tony glanced up at Steve, squeezing his hand again when Steve nodded.  “No, Mr Wilson, he’s not.  But I think with your help, he could be.  When can you get here?”
In fact, if Tony were a poet, he would spend hours—days, even—writing sonnets about that dimple.  But since he’s not a poet, and there’s no way that binary could come close to doing it justice, he supposes he’ll just have to keep trying to make Steve smile and laugh so he can get his fix of it during Peter’s practises.
"Why didn't you tell me?" Steve had asked, trying to keep his temper intact through the haze of his own pain and fatigue. "Tony, you know you can't always be forgetting to take care of yourself!"
Langara had been under martial law for twenty-eight years, ever since the Battle of the Continents. Twenty-eight years of rule by a military government so hell-bent on ensuring that Langara never fell victim to such an awful sneak attack ever again that they spent over ninety percent of the country's economy on maintaining their military hardware and training.
"And that's just fine, little guy," Steve said, breathing a quick sigh of relief. He wasn't quite ready for Anthony to connect the dots just yet. "As long as you don't think he'd be more upset to find out later? I don't want to get you into any trouble."
Stunned, Peter laid there for a moment with his hand over his heart, trying to catch his breath as his parachute fluttered down around him.
After another furtive glance at the door, Peter clicked open the document and got to work.  All those hours Peter had spent sitting alone at the school before Steve’s bookstore opened up were now starting to pay off as Peter’s very own decryption program, one that he had aptly named Hufflepuff, after his claimed Hogwarts House, got to work.
"You know I don't mean it like that," Steve said with a sigh, reaching to cup Tony's cheek. "I'm only trying to keep you safe. That's all."
To their log cabin on the lake, which, thanks to Steve's signature on the lease he'd just presented to Tony the night before, was now officially theirs.
He had just slid under his blankets when the announcement came, one he had heard every single night for the last ten years and yet never failed to make his heart jump.
Steve hung back as the three of them walked to Sam's car, smiling as he listened to Sam and Bucky's playful banter. It was amazing, really, how healthy Bucky was now compared to how he'd been when they first brought him to the Tower after Project Insight went down. Back when Bucky had little idea of who he truly was, and when no one could even approach him without fear of being attacked.
Clearing her throat, Gwen thankfully changed the subject to their summer break, asking Ned about his upcoming yearly trip to Hawaii to visit his grandparents. It was the second-to-last day of school, and Peter only had one more final exam to take before he could pretty much coast through the rest of his classes.
Bucky shrugged. "That's what I thought too, but when I asked him that, all Петр did was laugh at me. Then he showed me some stupid little video about a road work sign that he thought was funnier 'n hell, but it still didn't help."
And trying to get Uncle Bucky's name cleared was yet another thing causing Dad and Papa a bunch of stress, especially with the presidential election looming in just a few weeks. The sitting president was still very friendly to the Avengers, but according to the latest network predictions he wasn't currently doing well in the polls, and Peter knew that Dad and Papa were worried that he was going to lose the election.
Sam cut him off with a raised hand. "Nope, we're not going there. I'll see you on Thursday, right? One o'clock?"
"I don't know the whys, Captain, I just deliver the subpoenas," she said. "And now that you've been served, I'll be on my way."
And while Steve could certainly understand that sentiment, he was very concerned about its execution. In his eyes, Tony seemed to have come to the conclusion that he was somehow personally responsible for the alien invasion, and therefore now needed to do whatever it took to prevent it or something similar from happening again.
—son, Peter. It was Peter Quill, Gamora's lover, touching down on the plain just in time to catch her as she leapt into his arms.
"Shh, baby," Tony whispered as he tangled his fingers into Steve's hair, tugging Steve's head back down to his shoulder. He was convinced that there was nothing hotter during sex than hearing sweet nothings spoken in Irish with a Brooklyn accent. "It's okay, Steve. I'm right here."
"Oh, Steven," Ma said as she rushed forward, enveloping him into a hug. "Son, I am so happy for you!"
Steve's heart thudded as he climbed inside his cockpit and fitted his earpiece over his ear, from both excitement and nerves. He had been debating with himself almost nonstop for the last couple days if he should just bite the bullet and ask Anthony out on a date, or if he should confess that he had been visiting with Anthony's son at the hospital first and
"I'm really sorry," Peter added, as if his sentiments would somehow help. "It's not fair that you have to go through all that."
"Yeah, he did say that. But the two things he said that I remember the most, were that originally the Nazis had wanted his formula because Hitler was convinced that it could help them conquer the world, and that the reason he chose me was because he didn't want the perfect soldier, he just wanted a good man." Steve leaned back slightly, his blue eyes troubled. "It's been hard lately for me to think of myself as that same 'good man' that Dr Erskine chose to receive his formula, especially since all these villains that we've faced lately are likely the result of research that HYDRA conducted with my blood samples. It's like they're just spitting in Dr Erskine's face, and with how the political climate has been turning lately, I'm just—"
Tony tapped his chin as he studied the hologram floating in front of him, tilting his head as he made a small adjustment to one of the compositing mechanisms.  Obie had finally left for the day after Tony had literally pushed him out of his office, freeing him to put the finishing touches on the design he’d used to lure all of the pharmaceutical scientists back to the company.
He was going to figure out exactly what his family was up against, and then he was going to help them stop it.
Bucky paused, his right foot halfway into his shoe as he breathed in and looked at Steve. "If I'm honest? Pretty much right after our first date."
"I see," said Peter, clearing his throat and attempting to take a sip of his milk. "So, you think you're gonna be a police officer when you grow up? Like your dad?"
Because no bully ever expects its prey to get back up again, not when he's been knocked down over, and over, and over…
It hadn't taken long for Steve to realise that Peter was smart, especially since he had mentioned to Steve that for the past year he had been too sick to go to school, something he didn't seem to mind all that much. Aside from missing his friends, Peter had said that his classes had only bored him, and that he was learning far more from his father and grandfather than he ever did in school.
And Steve had been only too happy to oblige, especially since despite being able to fall asleep rather easily, he had been plagued by nightmares too. Horrible dreams of Langaran soldiers dressed in enemy uniforms breaking into his ma's house to steal Peter away, or renegade missiles embossed with the crest of the Langaran Air Corps but launched from the Meridian border, all aiming directly for Tony.
A knot rose in Tony’s throat as he reached for Steve’s hand.  “It wasn't luck,” he said.  “I’ve always believed that fate, or whatever higher power you feel like subscribing to, sent Pete to me in order to save my life.  And now, after all the shit we’ve been through, I am firmly convinced that he was sent to you to do the same.”  Tony paused, looking up at the man that he loved more than his own life.  “I can’t explain it, honey.  All I know is that I believe it.”
"Yeah, let's not piss off the Colonel again, gentlemen," agreed Chester as he took up position on Joseph's left, facing away from the mountain with Tomis falling into position on Joseph's right. "Last time I messed up he wouldn't let me fly again for an entire month."
"Let's just try and sleep now, yeah? We can get back to work tomorrow." Tony pressed against Steve's scalp again, relieved when Steve's strong body started to relax.

"Well…" Tony said, trailing off when he realised that he had no argument. After almost four months of marriage, he and Steve's desire for each other hadn't yet waned in the slightest.
"You're not leaving him, Стив, you'll still be here," Bucky said, giving Steve's shoulder a light shake. "But you need to help your husband. I will help Птер."
"Of course it isn't, you're a good photographer," said Gwen. She reached for her backpack, pulling out her own phone. "Can you take one with mine now?"
Slumping onto his chair, Tony reached for his phone. He needed to start prepping for that morning's simulator sessions, but he knew if he didn't at least try to talk to Peter first that he'd be pretty much useless.
"Then how'd the rest of 'em know to come there through them portal thingies?" Rocket asked, turning to Nebula. "'Cause I thought you guys were stuck up there on Titan?"
His lungs ready to burst, Peter finally lifted his head, gulping in air. He pulled off his glasses, rubbing at his eyes as he tried to decide what to do. It was already late, after midnight, and he was so tired that he could barely hold his head up, but at the same time too afraid to go to sleep. His dreams had been nothing short of horrifying lately, and he didn't really feel like stressing Dad out even more by waking up screaming again.
"Mr Pym will be hearing from Maria Hill within the hour, Mr Lang," said Steve. "We'll take it from here."
And the whole time, Steve never let go of their hands, not even once. Even when the surgeon had to pause so more local anaesthetic could be delivered, Steve's grip on Tony's hand never faltered.
“Mmm!” he mumbled as his eyes fluttered open, sounding so much like Peter that Steve couldn't help but smile.  “‘M not done yet!”
Not that Tony blamed him, of course. It was just yet another in the long, unrelenting line of hits that couldn't seem to stop coming no matter how hard Tony tried to dodge them.
"Little guy!" Steve rasped, his throat so tight he could barely breathe as he watched that universe's Steve and Tony rush towards their son, embracing him like they hadn't seen him for an entire year.
"Why do you think I followed him around so much?" said Uncle Bucky. "He'd pick fights with guys all the time, and I was always afraid that somehow one of 'em would figure it out and really try to kill him."
Always the perfect gentleman was Tony's husband. Even on a simple walk from their home over to the training dome.
Seven different levels of hell, all of which almost took Peter's life or the life of one or both of his dads.
"I am unsure, sir," answered JARVIS. "I do however agree that the fog does not appear to be a natural phenomenon."
"This might hurt a bit," Bruce warned Steve as he tweaked Steve's nose back into place, the hair-raising
"All right people, just don't let it slip your minds while you're up there playing that you actually have a patrol to conduct," said Phillips over the comm. "See ya back at the barn."
"What's this about, ma'am?" asked Steve as he opened his paper, his eyes narrowing as he skimmed it. "The Armed Services Committee?"
"Well, as long as one of you grabs the other, you should be fine," Dad said. "But we mean it. Midnight sharp, not a second later, this very spot."
“Ah, yes.  The sneak attack.  Very good, Captain,” says Thor.  “And quite effective, I must add.  There was a battle I once fought on Vanaheim that would’ve ended up being a total loss if I hadn’t—”
"Well, try harder!" said Bucky. "'Cause the last thing you need right now is to get yourself killed!"
That at least was enough to make Steve chuckle. He had never, in all of his years with the Air Corps, ever been late to a briefing, and there wasn't a single person on their team who didn't know it.
"Which isn't out of the realm of possibility, especially with these newfangled machines that you've designed," said Phillips. "And if everything continues to go as planned, then I don't see why—"
Steve smiled, a smile that Tony quickly mirrored. One of the worst things about Peter only getting to see his Auntie Nat on the weekends was that it had greatly decreased their opportunities to continue with Peter's ballet lessons. Peter still practised a couple times per week, and both Tony and Steve loved it when they just happened to wander into the living room to find Peter gracefully leaping across the floor while
"Dad, it's no use!" Peter said, his croaky, raspy voice like fingernails on a chalkboard on Tony's already frazzled nerves. "Dr Strange said he won't do it!"
I going to do with you?" he asked as he pulled Tony inside their grand master suite. He peeled the star from his chest, tossing it onto a chair as Tony worked to rid them both of their undersuits, finally shoving him towards the bathroom as soon as they were naked.
"But you don't need to prove anything to them!" Gwen exclaimed as she pushed herself up, grabbing Peter's hand. "Peter, you're up there at the Compound practising with them almost every single weekend, so I promise you that your dads know what you can do. But what they also know, is that they've both been to hell and back multiple times, and that neither one of them would ever want anything like that to happen to you. Your dads love you, and good parents who love their kids don't try to put their kids into situations where they could get hurt. Or worse."
fault that Peter almost died that night, and if he can forgive you for it then that's because he's too good for this fucking world that we're stuck in. But I will not. It is way past the time for you to start owning up to all of your goddamn mistakes!"
"I'll double-check with him tonight." Steve glanced down at his untouched croissant, finally giving into his growling stomach and tearing off a large piece. "I can't imagine that he's changed his mind though."
"Oh, you know," he said quickly. "Patrols and more patrols. I'm starting a new class tomorrow though, so maybe things'll get switched up a bit."
"Well, yeah, that too," said Tony. "I guess I didn't think that in the grand scheme of things it was all that important."
" he said, very softly. "And the same stuff was happening. The controls were frozen, I didn't know how to land, I radioed for help, all of that was the same."
"Don't worry, I'm just passing through," Tony grumbled. "So you can go right back to doing whatever the hell it is that you do when—"
"Bed!" Tony finally gasped, just before Steve attacked his mouth again, kissing him like he was afraid it would be the last time. Tony let out another whimper as he clung to Steve's broad shoulders, forcibly trying to empty his mind of his worries so he could focus only on how Steve was making him feel.
"Yes, but I'm not exactly sure what you're getting out of this," Steve protested, rather weakly since Tony's magical fingers were still busy rubbing his scalp.
“Of course I’m here about the Jericho!” Obie exclaimed.  “You wouldn’t take my calls all weekend, and that damn imaginary butler of yours wouldn’t tell me anything about it, so…?”  He shook Tony’s shoulder, leaning so close that Tony could smell the Scotch on his breath, combined with the tobacco from the expensive-as-hell Cuban cigars that he favoured.  “Tony, do I need to remind you yet again of how important this missile is to the company?  I mean, you know how much I hate repeating myself, so—”
And yet, like he'd told Steve many times since the beginning of the Avengers Initiative, they didn't exactly have desk jobs. The very nature of their team and its combined strength only served to invite stronger and stronger challenges, and that worried Tony. Despite the fact that they'd recently added two new team members in the Maximoff twins—and he supposed Peter as well, although both he and Steve were still vehemently opposed to naming him an official Avenger—Tony was pretty concerned about what sort of challenges lay ahead.
"Exactly," said Steve. "This wouldn't be like the cave, or Stane and Killian, or even all those semi-enhanced attacks that he went through. Sweetheart, if we time this right, Peter might not even have to know what happened!"
"No, I'm afraid not," Steve said gently. He glanced over at Tony, who simply shrugged. "I'm wondering if it's because he was killed before the snap?"
"Losing my family," Steve said quickly, squeezing his eyes closed when the tears threatened to fall. "Growing up, I never thought I'd—I was always so sick and weak, and I thought I'd die before… and then afterwards, in my time it wasn't—wasn't allowed, so… And now, I have—I have this amazing husband and an incredible son, everything that I never thought I could have, and I love them both so much, but then I almost
"Man, this isn't really even a fight," Clint said as they took off running towards their tower. "After all those tiny bases in Iceland I was hoping this one would be more of a challenge, but—"
Tony’s eyebrows shot up in surprise, which he quickly tried to cover with a salacious grin.  “Oh, really?” he said as he kissed the underside of Steve’s jaw, sending a delicious shudder down his front.  “That’s a pretty unusual request, honey.  Are you sure?”
"I don't want you coming out here without Steve today, Dad," Peter warned. "I haven't seen him in three days 'cause he was afraid he'd run into you if he came here, so I want you both to come together. He told me he could bring you after curfew and you wouldn't have to worry about getting in trouble."
"As soon as possible," Steve agreed. He pulled back, resting his forehead against Tony's. "We're ready, mo grá. We've been training for this for weeks, and we're ready. We can do this."
"Then don't, 'cause it won't help anything," Sam said firmly. "Tony, we're pretty much trapped inside a tin can here. We need to get this place opened up somehow or they'll just end up squashing us like a bunch of bugs."
"Woohoo!" Steve yelped as he lifted off, the usual bumpy lurch as the aircraft's wheels left the runway barely noticeable in his excitement. "Oh man, and I thought that the X-301s were smooth! This thing is incredible!"
“Tony?” Steve calls, blinking as he examines the broken window.  He knows Tony is fast; he’s seen him in action plenty of times.  But he can’t seem to shake the feeling that there’s something else going on here.
"Ah," Gwen cut in, nodding as if she understood. "They've been gone for over a week now, haven't they?"
“Dad, I already know that!  But I’m gonna go bonkers if I have to just sit here by myself for another hour!” Peter practically shrieked.  And it’s not like he didn't already know he was a potential target for kidnappers.  Dad only reminded him of it at least twice a day.
And yet somehow, O'Brien managed to cause not only all of the remaining high-ranking military officers to fall into line behind him, he also managed to completely transform the country from a civilian-led republic into what essentially amounted to a military dictatorship in only a few short weeks, one that had remained firmly in place for the last twenty-eight years.
"I see," the HYDRA agent said. "Well, then I guess we still have some more work to do." He nodded towards the young woman, who's name Steve couldn't seem to remember at the moment. "My dear, if you don't mind?"
"Uh huh," Peter said after a short pause, during which Tony could tell that Natasha whispered something to him.
At least the rain had stopped, leaving only the fat droplets that sprinkled down from the tall trees lining the walkway to shower them as he and Tony headed for the barracks. He had intended to talk to Tony about Operation Darkstalker, or at least ask if he'd ever heard about it, but after all of the rather unexpected events of the evening he had decided to wait. It was late, both he and Tony were exhausted, and he still had a patrol shift in the morning.
Tony looked up at him in shock. "Hell no! He's too busy being a moody teenager, remember? Right now twenty-five sounds positively ancient to him."
Tony's lips twitched, his eyebrows knitted together into a worried frown as he cupped Steve's cheeks in his hands.
"Peter, get the hell out of here!" added Auntie Nat, flipping away from the monster's fist as Thor launched more lightning bolts from his hammer. The monster let out a final, bellowing roar as it exploded, shooting lines of fire in all directions just as an armoured hand poked through the hole in the wall and wrapped around Peter's arm, yanking him through.
“Mmm.  Sounds great,” answered Steve.  Since it was Peter’s last day of school for the year, he was getting dismissed at lunchtime, and they all had plans to go out and celebrate once Steve and Tony picked him up.  Steve, Tony, Peter, Sam, Bucky, and Colonel Rhodes, who Steve had had the honour of being introduced to over the phone earlier that week.
“Well… I’d have to say that it would be kinda nice if you'd release all the files you’ve got on these HYDRA assholes, so I don't have to waste time digging for ‘em,” Tony said.  “Let me at least come up with a bit of a game plan.”
Another loud growl of his stomach jarred Steve from his thoughts, and he scowled, cursing his rapid metabolism for probably the first time in his life. He still had about a hundred unanswered questions, but he also had a strong feeling that if he happened to pass out from low blood sugar that there'd be no way Phillips would let him go up in the X-302 in the morning, and Steve wasn't about to jeopardise that.
So the fact that Uncle Clint, Auntie Nat, and Uncle Bucky hadn't encountered any resistance on their recent raids was probably because HYDRA knew they weren't looking in the right places. But if the entire team all happened to suddenly descend on this hidden fortress off the Georgia coast, there would be nothing to stop HYDRA from taking them all prisoner too, or even killing Papa in retaliation.
As soon as the elevator started its descent, Tony tipped his head back against the wall, closing his eyes.  The last dregs of his caffeine buzz were seeping from his body like excess water from a sponge, leaving him feeling like he’d just been wrung out.
"And yet, they're agreeing to it 'cause you pitched it to 'em," Tony had replied. "They trust you, honey. They believe in you."
Tony scoffed, his head spinning. "FBI. It was the goddamn FBI who took my husband away, so if you think that I'm gonna trust—"
Even Brock said he might show up, which Steve would really appreciate.  Ma didn't seem all that thrilled with Brock when Steve introduced her to him a couple of weeks ago, but Steve is hoping that’s only because she’s still getting used to him dating guys instead of gals.
"Now I've got you, you son of a bitch!" Steve heard as he pushed himself up onto his hands and knees, trying to catch his breath. His ears were still ringing from the various gunshots and explosions, and it took a couple of heartbeats for Steve to process why the voice sounded so familiar, and who it belonged to.
"Maybe not, but that doesn't mean they aren't correct," Tony said, frowning. "And since when do you discount your own suspicions?"
"Nah, hon, it's okay," said Tony. "If it helps Pete to not have to worry about him then I'll find a way to be okay with it. Your ma's friend though, she's probably gonna need hazard pay or something once she sees how bad the house is, and—"
"I am still placing Master Peter's current location at the school, sir," replied JARVIS. "If I remember correctly, they are due to leave in approximately forty-five minutes."
"'Night, Uncle Thor," Peter said, grimacing as Thor clapped him on the shoulder, still munching on what remained of his taco.
Closing out the drone hologram, Tony next brought up the schematics of the MAUDE glasses, tapping his chin as he studied the code that he'd written the day before. Beck had stated during their meeting that the combination of the glasses plus the CTX-616 drug had enabled the system to tap into the user's hippocampus, allowing the user's memories to basically be projected onto an external infrastructure. At first Tony had thought he was going to have to figure out a way to accomplish the same type of connection without using the drug, something that would have taken many months of research and experimentation and likely cost a ton of money as well, when it suddenly hit him a few days ago that the very people he was planning on using the tech with, Bucky, Peter, and maybe Steve, already had the drug in their systems. Even after being treated with the Aminacin antidote, Bruce could still find traces of CTX-616 in all three of their bloodstreams and in Steve and Bucky's spinal fluid, and Tony was hoping it would be enough to enable the tech to work without having to expose them to any additional doses of the drug.
"Captain Rogers, I must apologise for the rather invasive questions presented by my colleague," the chairman said. "There was no need to bring your personal life into this session."
"Okay, so why don't you give me a couple examples of these 'possible scenarios'," Tony said, his hand again curling around his left forearm.
"Oh, like that's anything new," Tony said, his eyes going wide as Peter practically lunged for the nearest platter of turkey, grabbing two of the four drumsticks. The entire table fell into pleasant conversations as they ate, listening to James recap how things were going down in D.C. with the ongoing trials of the former HYDRA operatives, along with Clint and Pietro's banter over who was likely to win the football games being played later that day. Clint had even taken it upon himself to purchase season tickets to the Buffalo Bills, braving the heavy snows and piercing cold every other Sunday to spend quality time with his surrogate son, something that Steve found incredibly heartwarming. Natasha had told Steve at the beginning of the school year that Clint had never expressed any interest in children or being a father until he met Peter, and that it was his relationship with Peter that had given him the confidence he needed to agree to take in the twins.
Tony immediately grinned, taking Steve's face in his hands and kissing a path to his ear, whispering, "How 'bout I suck you off first, baby, yeah? Help take the edge off a bit?"
Sucking in a deep breath, Strange locked eyes with Tony. "I went forward in time, to view alternative futures, to see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict."
"And plenty of security guards," Tony said. "I'd want 'em stationed at every building entrance, and down by the gates to the driveway."
“And in first place, coming in at world-record time,” the announcer says.  “Steve Rogers of the United States of America!”
"All right," Steve whispered, slumping back against his pillow as soon as Natasha left the room. He tipped his head, dragging his eyes back to where his wedding ring sat on the table, sparkling in the sunlight. It was the perfect summer day outside, the kind of day that Peter used to adore since he didn't have to worry as much about getting too cold. The kind of day that often saw him and Steve fishing out on the lake, or playing catch or baseball out in the yard. Steve, Peter, Sam, and Clint against Bucky, Natasha, Wanda, and Pietro, with Tony serving as both the cheering squad and the occasional umpire.
"You know Uncle Bruce is even clumsier than me, right?" Peter said. "Like, poor DUM-E can barely keep up with how many coffee cups he's managed to break in my dad's lab, and—"
"Ah, no, I can see fine most of the time without them," Peter said. "It's just easier to wear 'em when I'm tired."
Whatever was left of Steve, he knew that Tony and Peter loved him.  Accepted him as half the man he’d thought he could be.
attempt to ask him out on a date. On the one hand, despite what Peter had told him, Steve wasn't quite sure how Anthony would react to hearing that essentially a perfect stranger was being allowed to visit with his sick child, while on the other hand, the fact that Steve had managed to pass none other than Howard Stark himself in the hallway outside of Peter's room the other day and
"Yeah, that's true," muttered Steve, suppressing a shiver. He didn't like being reminded of Siberia, and especially of what he had found there. "Do you think this place could be a counterpart to the Siberian base? It's about the same size and design."
"Yes, he will," Steve said, giving Tony's hand a squeeze. "Dr Cho told us there's no reason for him not to."
"Uhh, hi," Peter stammered. He instinctively wiped his palm on his knee before grasping her hand, which felt as soft as silk. "I'm—um… I'm Peter. Peter Stark-Rogers."
“Well,” Steve said with a chuckle.  “I’m not sure he’ll listen to me any better, but I am definitely not above trying.”  He reached for Tony’s hand, placing his other hand on Peter’s shoulder.  “Shall we?”
Tony's eyes gleamed as he grinned. "Oh yeah," he said as he brushed another kiss across Steve's lips. "Hold on tight, baby. We're just getting started."
this universe he was observing, was the one they had been searching for all this time. The parallel universe that demonstrated that it was possible to bring the snapped people back, simply by going back to the correct point before they were snapped.
escaped him that Steve Rogers was a damn good-looking fellow.  And that he was also single, according to Peter’s assessment, which were usually spot on.
“Or a husband,” Tony says, instantly regretting it when Peter’s face lights up like a Christmas tree.
Tony frowned. It was a bit weird that Agent Bartlett hadn't yet returned Tony's call, he'd never had any reason to ignore him before.
"That's exactly what I'm saying!" exclaimed Peter. "'Cause if I don't, pretty soon the enemy's gonna have a weapons system that'll be basically unstoppable!"
"No, I don't," Steve said, again without thinking. Because if he was completely honest with himself, now that they both were fully awake, Steve knew there was no way he'd be able to get back to sleep with the current state of his mind. It had been an easy summer up at the Compound, mainly at Steve's insistence after the incident at the bunker and Tony and Peter's prolonged hospital stays, and the three of them had enjoyed it to its fullest extent. Lazy mornings spent in their kitchen over breakfast, plenty of fishing and waterskiing at the lake, pickup football games with the rest of the team between training sessions, and bonfires at night where they roasted marshmallows and told ghost stories. Or in Clint's case, zombie stories.
, after Peter had managed to figure out the hidden location of the HYDRA bunker, fight off yet another semi-enhanced goon, and finally break in to the otherwise invisible building and find where they were holding Papa, his dads had
Peter shrugged, something that Steve had noticed he did quite a bit.  “Eh, mostly ‘cause I think playing in competitions would take all the fun out of it,” he said.  He leaned forward, lowering his voice.  “And ‘cause a lot of those kids’ parents are a bit mad, if you know what I mean.  Like… cuckoo.”
"Look, I know what you're thinking, and honey, you can wish all you want, but it's just not gonna happen. Not with—well, it's just not, okay? Just get back here, yeah? Pete misses you."
“I will return for you straightaway, Captain!” Thor calls a few seconds later.  “Please do not move from that spot!”
With a gasp, Steve's eyes flew open, flitting around the room as he took a quick inventory of his surroundings, realising a second or two later that yes, he was safe in his bedroom at the Tower, and not still embedded in one of his nightmares.
he thought as he breathed in another deep breath, trying to saturate his senses with as much of Steve's essence as he could. With how well the simulator sessions were proceeding, Tony was certain that Phillips would announce the trial missions within the next few days, and once those were completed and successful and Tony managed to build the containment vessel for the tesseract… hopefully everything would be fine.
"Copy that," Steve said. He glanced back at Peter and Bucky, giving them the signal to take their positions behind the stack of debris about five metres away. The team had already managed to take down three of the twelve enemy targets originally scouted by Redwing; one by Clint, using the brand-new arrowheads that Tony had made for him, one by Pietro Maximoff, in quite impressive fashion, Steve might add, and the third by Peter, who, Steve had to admit, was performing even beyond he and Tony's wildest expectations.
And then, the problems only get worse.  Because of his shoulder injury, Steve was forced to alter his stroke slightly to take some of the pressure off of it.  But as soon as it hits him that he’s already behind, he instinctively reverts back to his old stroke style, the very one that caused all of his shoulder problems in the first place.
Peter gave her a wide smile. "Oh, yeah. The rest of us were so relieved when they finally quit dancing around each other too. I think deep down Uncle Bucky was still afraid it was a sin or illegal or something, like it was back in his time."
"That's for sure," agreed James. "I know you didn't see him much down in Georgia, but he was damn good during that fight. He'll be the least of our worries."
"No, it's okay," Gwen said as she snuggled closer to him, resting her head on his shoulder. "I'm ready."
"Tony, I don't want to—" he started, lowering his fork when Tony quirked an eyebrow. "It was just a bad dream, mo grá. Nothing more than that."
"Oh, sure, now you wanna run," grumbled Tony. He tapped the container on his chest to deactivate his suit. "You haven't even had the decency to thank us yet."
Once again, it was as though someone had dropped a bucket of ice water down Steve's spine as his disbelieving eyes read through the vast list of projects, a list that included none other than Project Rebirth.
"Well, now he's got another chance," said Peter, pointing to his lines of code. "As long as the code is sound there's really no good reason not to do this, and then his name will be spoken with reverence around the entire world. I mean, can you think of a better way to honour him?"
They made love slowly, taking their time despite the lateness of the hour, their kisses and caresses languid and peaceful as their bodies moved together in the intricate dance they had perfected over the last couple of months.
If anything, Peter's constant presence would probably only make things worse. It'd been a long time since Dad and Papa had had any alone time, and Peter knew that Papa was especially looking forward to it.
"A shower? Jesus, Steve, how hot was the goddamn water? You look like you washed yourself with sandpaper!" Tony's eyes narrowed when Steve didn't answer, and he let out a heavy sigh. "Were you dreaming about the ice again? Is that it?"
Still, Tony did appreciate Carol's attempt at following the rules, especially since he had a strong feeling that his bone-deep exhaustion was starting to become more and more physically evident. The last thing he needed now was to come off as anything besides knowing exactly what he was doing.
