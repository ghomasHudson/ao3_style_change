A little giggle leaves Tony’s lips and Steve’s expression brightens up immediately, he kisses all over Tony’s face apart from his lips to try and get more of those adorable giggles and is blessed when Tony laughs more and more.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Tony now lets get back to the Gala before they notice you’re gone.”
“Thor! Jane! So glad that the two of you could be pulled away from your love cave for this” Tony smirked whilst Jane gave him a light-hearted punch on the shoulder and Thor just belted out a loud laugh.
He knew Pepper had a fierce bite but damn now he knows how she keeps Tony in line and when she raises her brow expectantly he can just mutter out a short “Yes ma’am, understood” and she gives him a gentle yet cold smile which vastly contrasts her previous words. “Great talk don’t give us a reason to have it again”.
“Oh my GOD that was awful,” Clint wheezed. “Love it when you talk all old-timey babe. It’s hilarious.”
Steve came over too, looking a little faint. “Sweetheart, I know you don’t like getting checked out by medical but this is a whole new level! You must be in so much pain, don’t downplay it for us.”
Bruce set a mug of coffee down in front of him, strong and black, just the way he liked it. “Thanks.” Tony started to take a sip, startling and almost spilling it everywhere when he felt fingers carding through his hair. “What the fuck, Barton.”
A second after he pried the quinjet door open (it fell off of its hinges, blasting the team with snow and cold air) the majority of the team verbally attacked him.  Tony and Bruce did not.
As they began getting closer, they became much … closer. Physically and emotionally, until they were the closest they could possibly be.
“Alright then.” Steve said, “let’s head out. Tony, you fly ahead of the quinjet and let us know what we’re up against.”
With a sigh, Tony turned the TV off (even though Jarvis could have done that too) and tugged on a pair of sneakers.
“The man of Iron was knocked from the sky when he was acting as our scout.”  Thor growled, crossing his arms, making hs muscles stand out more prominently.  “Our flying ship could have crushed him.”
“Fine!”  Fury threw back, “I’ll just deactivate the EMP and y’all can find your own way home.  Have fun trying to be a real team without us.”
Then Bucky had come back. Steve had been torn. He didn’t want to be with Tony while he still had feelings for Bucky. That wouldn’t be fair. And Bucky had been recovering, plus Steve still had no idea if he was even interested.
They came to an older prototype of the Dora Milaje’s spear. ‘Older,’ meaning, ‘in use currently so according to Shuri outdated already.’
“Ahh, don’t blame him,’ M’baku said, waving his hand dismissively. “I told him I wanted you to warm my bed if you were so willing. He didn’t know about Stane.”
“So, trauma-bonded family for life?” Natasha said finally, breaking the (actually rather comfortable) silence.
He was really talking more to himself than Tony at this point. After all, the genius probably couldn’t even hear him.
Thor shook his head. “Indeed, Anthony is aware of his attractiveness, but he does not seem to understand Midgardian relationships.”
Then Steve started inviting the team down to with movies with him. Bruce began using the communal kitchen to make everyone food. They began making plans to spar with each other.
For a second Tony considered not answering and pretending to be asleep but he was sure Steve wouldn’t have asked unless he was sure Tony was up.
Tony shuddered, remembering how much worse the nightmares had gotten when he realized she wasn’t there when he woke up.  The dreams about losing her had almost tripled.
The rest of the team sprang up and piled on top of Tony and Steve. They ended up in a giggling mess of tangled limbs.
“I’ll go out with you,” Tony said, the words tumbling out of his mouth. “If- if you join me for my next one. I know you like tech too.” His wide brown eyes held Bucky’s, daring him to back down. Wanting to see how far he’d go for Tony.
When Bucky finally gathered up the courage to ask Tony out, Tony’s first question was, “why?” Why did Bucky like him?
Vaguely, Tony wondered when Clint had started calling him by his first name. “Well savor it arrow boy, cuz it’s the only first you’re gonna get.”
“Guys, quit it, I need to go to work.” Tony simultaneously tried to bat Thor’s hands away while melting into the god’s massive bear-hug.
None of them had ever had it before but it turned out, shawarma? Delicious.  Especially when shared with one’s best friends in the world.
“Please do.” Jim’s voice suddenly reverted back to pleasantness. “Have a good night, Captain. Tell the team I say hello.”
Tony responded by swallowing around his boyfriend with a wet gulping noise. His throat was going to hurt like a bitch after, but it’d be worth it.
They knew Tony was down to join their relationship. But he didn’t seem to realize that they were down??? And it was all Dum-E’s fault.
“They’re the ones with the cart,” Clint explained. “You didn’t think this was all we were getting, did you?”
“Just remember,” Colonel Rhodes said, his voice dangerously low, “I know all your secrets. All of your weaknesses. If you hurt Tony in any way I will not hesitate. You’ll never see me coming.”
Tony hit the ground landing face-up. Luckily, he hadn’t been flying all that high, and the snow made for a semi-soft landing.
.”  Tony hissed. To his everlasting shame, tears began forming in his eyes.  It had to be the exhaustion. Everyone cried a little when they were  massively sleep deprived.
Jarvis walked him through making his own account, following Tony’s, and subscribing to his live-feeds.
Steve didn’t even realize his reaction was so noticeable. He was too busy feeling sorry for himself because he’d missed his chance.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Guys. I used to make weapons. I’m an inventor. It’s not that hard to figure out how these work.”
“Alright, alright.” Tony rolled his eyes. “Now didn’t you fellows promise me a full nights sleep?” He cuddled into them more closely.
Cuddling. Of course. That’s all that the colonel and Tony ever seemed to be doing when they were together.
“So that you and Stark could.” T’challa stopped short. M’baku was wearing pants. Tony was fully clothed. They had both been asleep. “Cuddle?”
Natasha nodded. “And I’m the one bringing them up for movie night.” She gave Thor, Steve, and Clint a kiss on the cheek, turned to Sam and Bucky to say, “Close your mouths boys, or your tongues will fall out.” And then she was gone.
Prompt (stuckony): AU in which they all have tumblr, and they all are part of a collaborative blog (w/ the rest of the avengers) (tony makes themes, steve draws, bucky has the most mind blowing meta)+ they keep complimenting each other on anon, then one day one of them is tired of all the shit they get from anons and turns it off w/o telling anyone... (from @three-thousand-starks on tumblr)
“Sounds like a good time,” Nat said. Obviously one of them would be dragging him out of the workshop later. “Hey, can you get me sugar?”
“Y-you didn’t notice?!” Bucky practically shrieked. He hurried over to gently run a finger over the mottled skin. Tony didn’t even flinch.
And now he was in a cave-in with Tony, who was unconscious from a head wound. He really should have seen this coming.
Sam was halfway turned to ask Steve if this was normal, but Steve was suddenly next to Tony too, asking if he could at least get a goodbye hug if Tony really had to go.
Bucky blinked up at Steve silently. “As captain of the Avenger’s and Tony’s would-have been godparent, can I have your blessings to ask him out?”
He felt a little better once his legs were dry, but he was still shivering more violently than ever.
That last bit had turned sharply into a DMC since they’d all had fairly shitty childhoods, with the exception of Thor.
“Still Tony, not in the suit yet.” Tony answered, falling into place beside Natasha, who was already suited up. He almost tripped, regained his balance a little, and started to teeter. Nat caught him by the arm, giving him a slightly concerned side-glance.
Clint was suddenly in the doorway. “Uh … Cuz shopping can be fun and we’re all dying of boredom here?”
Steve hadn’t spoken to either Tony or Bucky about it, actually. He was still trying to pull himself together and face the fact that he was going to die alone.
“Amazing!” Shuri beamed at him and Tony couldn’t help smiling back. She was great. Her and Peter would definitely get along.
“Oh! Hey, guys.” Tony said brightly, the still-full cat carrier under his arm. “What are you doing here?”
Tony put the contents of his basket into the cart slightly nicer than Clint had, rolling his eyes. “Jeez, Cap starts taking classes and suddenly he’s gotta school all of us.”
She had started off consoling and supportive, but in time it had turned into “I can’t do this Tony.  We can’t be together if we can’t even sleep in the same room.”
“Uh huh.” Tony’s eyes darted around the kitchen nervously. He glanced down at Nat’s fingers intertwined with his. Tony’s mouth opened, but before he could say anything, Thor reached for him and the inventor found himself scooped into a large lap.
Surprisingly, Tony felt Steve’s chest rumble with a laugh behind him.  Huh, maybe the captain wasn’t such a tightass after all.
“I-I don’t think theres any other clothes here,” the genius said, teeth chattering. He swore he could feel the damp parts of his clothing stiffening and turning to ice.
With a few forced-but-not-actually-forced cuddling sessions thrusted upon him, Tony warmed and loosened up almost completely. It didn’t take the others long to figure out that touch was his weakness with Natasha on their side.
M’baku’s smile turned lascivious. “Well we don’t have to just … dine. Shuri does not want her weapons defiled but perhaps you would not be opposed.”
Tony actually looked offended at that. “No! I know what broken ribs feel like, that makes the reactor hurt more. I just got squeezed really tightly by one of those tentacle things. It’ll clear up in a a few weeks. Less, if I use that cream Pepper got me.”
Tony wanted to protest, but Natasha sat next to Thor and started carding her fingers through his hair, and he helplessly succumbed to their gentle comfort.
“Oh hell no,” said Natasha. “No offense but I’m not getting naked with any of you.” Then she sent a considering glance around the cabin. “At least not in this current situation.”
“I will be if I don’t get out of this cold.” Tony said, gritting his teeth and wrapping his arms around himself to stave off the shivering. He could already feel his chest and stiff joints aching more from the cold.
In the morning, Fury pried the quinjet door open and found them tangled in a mess of limbs and smiled, because their forced team bonding had been far more succesfull than he’d imagined.
“Yeah, I wasn’t flying us too high.” Clint assured him. “We were planning on unrealistically jumping out of the plane like badasses and into the battle.”
If you're looking for prompts then how about: Tony does instagram live sometimes while he builds because he’s bored and feels weird talking to no one and he eventually gets really popular because well, he’s funny and really talented (sometimes he sees people asking how to fix something in the comments so he takes a break and explains how to) and one time Bucky comes down while he does this because he and Tony started being closer and he wanted to spend time with him, and Tony tells him to just wait and he’ll be done in a moment but after that Bucky always checks when Tony does a live because he loves listening to him ramble without feeling self conscious- after they get together he’s almost always there when Tony does this and sometimes chimes in with his own commentary. (requested by a tumblr anon)
“Nope.” Clint crossed his arms. “It is a big deal and you’re coming with me right now. Get your shoes on. Even Thor has been grocery shopping, holy shit.”
They walked to the nearest supermarket despite Tony’s protests that his many cars were at their disposal. Even Thor looked disapprovingly at him for that one.
There was skepticism written all over Tony’s face but no one else seemed to find this request strange, so he went with it.
“You’re still checking in with Bruce tommorow.” Steve mumbled sleepily, right before they all dropped off.
Tony was 78% sure he meant in just a friend way, but hey. He was Tony Stark. He took chances and went after what he wanted. So he bridged the gap between them and laid one on Clint, right in front of the grapes.
Clint had grabbed Tony’s hand again and was pulling him along, talking a mile a minute and pointing things out left and right. He was unfairly adorable, like a blond, short-haired, peppy mutt. A cross between a golden retriever and a corgi maybe, Tony mused.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Steve murmured. He moved aside to let Thor give Tony a good morning hug as well.
“We should play a game or something.” Clint said, after the sheet had been put over the window and everyone was cuddled in close to each other.
“Does laser tag involve lasers?” Bucky interrupted. “Because if it does then I’m in. No questions asked.”
Well no, they couldn’t really regret it. The rest of the team was perfectly welcoming and down for well … there was someone for anything.
Obviously Tony’s brain did not short circuit at that point. Because he hadn’t been harboring a teensy tinsy bit of a crush on the archer for about a week- definitely not.
“Jarvis, tell the team we’re eating in front of the TV tonight,” Bruce instructed. Then he covered Tony with a blanket and went to go cook.
The only plus side was that neither of them were pinned down. They’d miraculously ended up in a small non caved-in  space. Well, mostly. There was still rubble everywhere.
“We’ll call Sam or Nat or Clint to go watch him.” Steve started steering them towards the stairs. “We have been waiting for this moment for far too long for that cat to ruin it again.”
Tony was concentrating so hard on breathing that he barely noticed M’baku gently prying his hand away and reaching into a nearby drawer for the scented oil that was kept specifically for this.
On this particular day Tony was sleepy, but from waking up too early, not staying up too late. Bruce wrapped Tony’s hands around a steaming mug of coffee as was customary in the mornings before kissing everyone on the cheek and going on his way.
Sometimes they’d play board games (the good ones, like Cards Against Humanity and What do you Meme). And sometimes he’d put on a disney film (everyone knew that Natasha loved them, even if she’d never admit it).
Luckily, due to inertia, Tony wasn’t crushed. The plane crashed down literal inches from where he was laying.
“It’s Tony,” He said automatically. No one ever called him ‘doctor’. “And it’s an honor to be here. I’d be happy to help you out with making your own algorithm.”
Steve wrapped his own arms around Tony, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. “Morning, sweetheart.”
The man shrugged. “Yes, big enough to carry you around if you’d like.” He nodded at Tony. “M’baku. Leader of the Jabari tribe. Princess Shuri allows me entrance into her lab when I’m bored.”
“When I heard of your work on AIs, Doctor Stark,” she said, “I knew I must meet you. It’s one of the only things of yours I haven’t been able to replicate or improve.”
Every considered Bucky x Steve x Tony x Clint???? It’s a cute ship I found that’s pretty small on AO3. If you’d like to write for them, I have a prompt! Laser tag shenanigans where everyone cheats in their own way and I insists they didn’t cheat because x y and z reason. Requested by a Tumblr anon.
Tony shook his head. “That’s not what I meant. I just thought captain tightasses version of civillian wear included a lot more flannel.”
But finally, T’challa and M’baku both had a day free, so they accompanied Tony to the labs to watch how adorable and excited he got over advanced technology. Shuri had let them in with the strict instructions that none of them take apart something they couldn’t put back together.
“I eat vegetables when someone on the team makes them,” Clint defended. “Besides, you don’t have a leg to stand on. I’ve hardly seen you eat anything besides coffee.” He piled packages of food into the basket he’d made Tony take as well.
Steve tried to kiss Tony? Dum-E knocked a glass off the table right in between them, making them jump back. The exact same thing happened with Bucky just a few hours later.
It wasn’t that Tony wasn’t enjoying the activities he picked, he just wasn’t picking for himself the way the rest of them did. He could have been happier. And the team noticed.
“It just called for The Avengers to come to these coordinates. Said it was the world ending type of situation. The call came directly from S.H.I.E.L.D.”
Prompt: I would really love one where Tony is a bamf at like.. business and law and somehow saves them both? Maybe against Ross, the media or something like that? (From @coookiemonsterns on tumblr)
Tony scanned the snow-covered ground with every special feature his armour had. “I’m not seeing anything. What did the call say?”
“Technically there’s supposed to be no physical  contact between players,” The worker spoke up. She looked like she was about to pass out.
Tony picked it up, turning it over quizzically. And then he collapsed it without a second thought, uncollapsed it, and turned the handle to make part of it crackle with energy. “Nice.” He said.
Tony honestly couldn’t believe how lucky he was. The first (and possibly only) American inventor invited directly into Wakanda’s labs. Princess Shuri was showing him around. She was pretty down to earth for a princess. Funny too, even if a lot of her humor seemed to revolve around making fun of other people. And puns. So many puns.
“Steve,” she said sharply, after he crushed yet another glass, shards and drops of blood flying everywhere. “Enough. Go talk to them like an adult.”
“Okay,” Steve said slowly, “but we’re not going to leave, no matter what. And we want him to quote, 'be selfish’ if that’s what it’s going to take to make him happy.”
It happened in classic Tony style. He’d refused to go to medical after the battle, which was pretty normal. He swore up and down that he felt fine, so no one insisted. He was usually okay because of his armour anyways.
A couple days(??) later Tony reemerged, just three hours before when Jarvis would have allowed one of the others to drag him out.
Natasha poked her head out. “It’s all clear!” She called. “You guys going to just stand there and freeze?”
, he thought disgustedly) with a bag over his head. The bag wasn’t the regular rough burlap though, it was something much more breathable and soft. Strange.
First with Bucky, whom he’d thought he could never be with. Not in the 1900s. He’d loved Peggy, he really had, but they’d both had to suffer from the knowledge that she was his second choice.
It wasn’t a planned thing. Actually, it was Dum-E’s fault. Sleep-deprived Tony had thought giving Dum-E his social media access was a good idea for some reason. But either way, it had happened. Tony found himself turning towards his phone camera and explaining in great detail exactly what he was doing- besides for the top secret SI/Avengers stuff, obviously. Later, he’d been informed his Instagram Live Story was extremely popular. Ah, so that’s what Dum-E had been beeping so excitedly about. Tony being Tony, he shrugged and went along with it. Instagram Live building sessions became a regular thing of his.
Bucky glanced back at the door, shuddered, and took Tony’s hand, pulling him along. “You have no idea, doll. None.”
“Eh, i’ll just leave it.”  Tony shrugged dismissively.  “I can just call it back to the tower later, it’ll dig itself out somehow, and if not then I’ve still got plenty of suits.”
“This isn’t about me because believe me if it was I wouldn’t be speaking to you right now.” Not about her? Then what is she angry about? At his clearly confused expression she lets out an exasperated huff and looks him in the eyes for her words to hit home.
“Stark, there you are! I was looking everywhere for you, but I should have known you would be by the bar.”
Their screams echoed around the empty space and Steve stood even more frozen than before, tilting his head in confusion as Tony took a haggard breath to try and compose himself but failed as his tears were falling faster and he was shaking from emotional exhaustion.
“I know that you love being the little spoon because you feel protected, that you didn’t know what colour your eyes exactly were until after the serum because you were colour blind and I say that’s a damn shame because they are the purest blue I have ever seen, the colour of a clear blue sky after the world’s most beautiful sunrise because to me your eyes represent new beginnings and moving on from a dark past to walk into a new day.”
go to the Gala and support Stark because the world knows that they are two bulls clashing horns and due to that fact are hesitant to trust them and let them save the world in peace, you’d think they would be grateful and move on but apparently not. If he showed up at the Gala along with Thor then it would show partnership and that the Avengers are strong, he can see Fury’s logic behind this unlike with everything else but that doesn’t mean he’s happy to do it.
But today was a typical day, a day where Steve had the time to let his pet rest as long as he needed. Tony stretched as he woke, arching long and lean against Steve’s side, his lips curling up in a smile when he felt Steve’s hand gently cupping and squeezing his hardening cock in greeting.
“He is the first man whom I have met who feels like an equal,” Steve said without much trouble. Evidently, unlike Tony, Steve knew how to prepare for a meeting. “He is someone I feel I could speak to, and share my thoughts with without needing to explain myself. My career is important to me, and my sense is that his career is important to him,” Steve added, looking at Tony then, giving him a chance to interrupt if he wanted to. But Tony only watched Steve with a curious and mildly confused expression. “I respect that in a partner. He is kind to strangers, and when I needed him, he was there for me, without being asked. I could learn from him; I could be better, with him.”
“Our army was unprepared, we were too few to defend the country’s borders. When the war broke out, my grandfather moved our people up the mountain for safety,” Tony explained later that night when it was just the two of them in bed. “There he could defend the perimeter, but it was not easy to grow food. It was a long war, and cows do not fare as easily in mountains as horses. Many farmers abandoned their cows in the first winter. My father was only able to repay their families for their losses after the second war, once we developed our wealth through his military investments.”
“This is Fran, she is a ten week old Pomeranian,” Georgie told the audience at home. “She is currently up for adoption at the Sydney Dogs and Cats Home. If you adopt any of the little rascals you see on the show today, the Today show will cover the fees. Just, something to keep in mind when you ask your mothers and fathers for a puppy this morning...”
Tony snickered to himself and settled back to get into the script again. Steve counted up the yolks in his and Tony’s respective bowls, then added an egg white to his before starting to cook up Tony’s portion.
“There’s nothing in the rules that says no seduction,” Bucky insisted. “I was totally allowed to do that.”
Prompt: Alpha Steve omega Tony with them at a gala or something like that where some other omega is flirting with Steve and tony goes over to make sure the person knows Steve is taken... (via @stonys-world on tumblr)
The only one who didn’t have some sort of pattern in his turn was Tony. Tony seemed to rotate his activities to suit at least one member of the team at a time.
When it was Clints turn, he’d scrounged up games from the internet, all of which required a lot of human contact.
“We all have nightmares, Tony.”  Clint said quietly.  “I dream about being controlled by Loki almost every night.”  He glance at Thor. “Uh. No offense.”
. Don’t doubt that. We thought you needed better bonding. We wanted you to be as happy here as we are.”
He was becoming rapidly more aggressive, particularly around Tony and Bucky. Not physically. He’d never hurt them intentionally. But he was snappish and rude and short tempered, and he had a tendency to break whatever he was holding whenever Tony and Bucky did anything coupley. Which being newly in love, they did quite a lot, naturally.
Tony was. Three rounds of raucous enthusiastic sex with two powerful high-libido beasts was enough to put literally the strongest man out of commission for a while. He let his eyes drift shut, blocking out M’baku and T’challa discussing whether they wanted to go for a round four without him.
Pepper had already left him when she found out.  First she was mad he wasn’t sleeping, then she was mad he kept accidentally waking her up.
In the end they moved to Tony’s giant bed after dinner and they all got the chance to cuddle him and each other at once.
That was how Tony’s terrible day started coming to an end.  First though, the worst part had to happen.
Tony had smiled warmly at him. “Aw, you’re welcome.” And then kissed Bucky on the cheek and sent him upstairs.
“It’ll be okay,” Bucky said, finishing up the makeshift bandage. “The team will get us out, you’ll be fine.”
Thor brightened instantly. “On Asgard cuddling is considered the best way to bond with our brothers and sisters! I shall much enjoy cuddling with you, friend Bruce.”
“Never what?” Tony asked irritably. “Shopped in an actual store? I guess I haven’t. What’s the big deal?”
“Tony was almost crushed by the quinjet and Bruce could have very well destroyed everything when he hulked out and left us all in the cold with nothing.”  Natasha said evenly.  “It’s pure luck that neither of those things happened.”  While her tone was mild, her expression was making the director feel a little threatened.
His expression betrayed a tumble of emotions. Excitement and affection, determination, but also apprehension and doubt. In the short time since their friendship took a romantic turn, they had spent more time apart than together.
An icy chill ran through his veins, and he shrunk in on himself, stumbling back to the truck. Steve had no awareness of how or when Tony had wrapped his arms around him, or what his unheard words of comfort were, but for reasons he couldn’t have articulated if he’d wanted to, he instinctively knew to turn into Tony’s body to feel safer.
Tony got no other warning before Mr. Perfect bent to scoop up his legs and lift him in a bridal carry. By the time Tony got over the surprise and thought about demanding to be put down they were already across the street. They were on his stoop in seconds rather than minutes, and what could a man say about that besides thank you?
“I don’t… Are you surprised?” Tony asked, with his tone and expression caught somewhere between confused and rhetorical. “You’re my hero, Steve. I—uh, I mean,” color rose in his cheeks and up his neck and he cleared his throat, clearly not having meant to admit that quite so casually. “You’re obviously
But Steve had been firmly stuck on second base these past three months. It was enough to drive a man crazy.
Like most of Chris’s questions, it left Steve and Tony quiet for some time as they mulled over their answers. This time, Steve was the first to respond.
One great, black eyelid slid open to reveal a blood-red eye. She stared at Clint with a resigned air of amusement, but otherwise, she did not move.
He traveled to D.C. to speak with senators from New England about a multi-state investment in the technology Steve presented at the General Assembly, then flew onward to Sacramento for a meeting with California’s Governor. No sooner had they touched down in California than Coulson got a call from South Korea. It nearly was the final straw.
He could hear Tony smiling, but he didn’t care. All he wanted in that moment was to get his hands on Tony, and to hold him close. Tony readily obliged.
“Greetings and salutations, I am Associate Bob Sitwell,” the Governor’s assistant introduced himself with a low bow. “We met earlier, but I was groveling in fear the time. You have had a remarkable day in New Yorseylvania, Captain Steven Rogers. Chasing a real criminal!”
tied these crimes back to my books,” Tony whispered with a huff of wry amusement. “You said they were handled by three different precincts, too, right?”
“Cancel the call,” he told her as he took his seat, looking through the small stacks of papers and mail Sharon had sorted for him. “Move the meeting to eight. My attorney can wait. Did you call the—what’s her name? The one with the overbite?”
For the last time, Steve shifted down. He tugged the end of Tony’s shirt down in an effort to cover his bare lower back, then, with a final push, he thrust his palms up into the meat of Tony’s ass. Tony’s bones popped twice in quick succession, first his spine and then his pelvis, and Tony melted into the floor in his relief.
“Unless you mean you literally choked and someone called 9-1-1,” Steve drawled, but JARVIS interrupted him before he could continue grilling his best friend for details.
“Fuck,” Tony mumbled drowsily, and even with sleep clearly glazing over his eyes, he struggled to stare at Steve. “‘m I dreamin’? You so hot, so fuckin’ hot.”
“No! No, of course not. You'll meet him first,” Steve hurried to assure his somewhat territorial best friend, who at least cooled off a little with the promise that he was still safely at the top of the list. “But, it is serious. For me, anyway. I gave him a key to my place last night.”
Stark money made a lot of things possible, including last minute romantic get-aways for a long weekend. They both had a Monday off early in October for Columbus Day, or as Tony liked to call it, Bartolomé Day.
It took a little time, but together they adjusted the seat, visors, and monitors in the car to accommodate Steve’s height until he was comfortable. Tony talked him through it step by step, and to his continued amazement, Steve learned it almost faster than Tony could teach him. Soon, the dashboard’s navigation system came on and they were on their way as Steve easily followed its instructions to merge the car into the ambling morning traffic.
There was a tension in Steve’s expression, but he denied it. “I think your mom makes a good point,” he replied. “If we can do the same thing here as there, why not do it with your family?”
“And that woman is doomed for a second orgasm,” Tony said with a defeated sigh. “Why are we good guys again?”
“The way I see it, we’re really the only ones who know the subject is a man,” Tony said under his breath. He glanced at the bathroom door again, then lowered his voice further in case for any reason Steve was hovering in the hallway to listen in on him in the bathroom like some crazy person. “Yinsen won’t know; nobody will know. We’re obviously changing his name for anonymity anyway, so we’ll just change it to a woman’s name. A relationship is a relationship: everything else will be the same.”
“Boss, he’s nothing but an airhead,” Sharon promised as she gathered up the documents and manuscripts she was picking up for the office. “I know your tolerance for airheads is …pretty low, but you got this. It’s working. And, at least he’s hot; and he’s nice, isn’t he?”
“That’s thirty seconds, man,” Rhodey told Steve quietly, sounding sober all of a sudden. He sounded serious enough that Steve didn’t hesitate to follow his unspoken command, and powered down the bull.
“I’m really tired of magic,” Clint muttered while Tony hurried to pull his tunic over his head and offer it to the young Woman. Clint rushed to the cottage, while Tony helped her as she struggled to push herself up to sitting. Careful of where exactly he put his hands, he held the tunic in front of her to cover her until she could better control her jerking limbs and trembling nerves.
By the time Steve got out of his first class, his phone had blown up with messages from people who were only now catching on to the news. He deleted the voicemails Brock had left and skipped the one message from his ma for a more private occasion. There was a solid chance he might cry, and that was the last thing he needed to do in public.
“Romantic feelings?” Tony asked immediately in his excitement, and relief washed over Steve like a cold shower. He bit his cheeks to keep from laughing, quickly nodding his head instead.
Except Steve won't let him. This is his shot at the damn title, and he's not going out because he can't take a few punches. But since he now has been made aware that the other guy is cheating, he knows he can't just let it drag out and win by strategy: he can't win by points, because if Vanko is cheating, Steve won’t last long enough to see it through. Vanko has to go down as soon as possible, while Steve still has the energy to fight. So the next time Vanko comes at him with a straight punch, Steve meets him fist for fist with a straight left jab, putting all his weight and power into it, hitting it so hard the metal breaks Vanko's hand as well as his own. That leaves Steve with his dominant hand, and Vanko in sudden shock and pain, so he swings with the right and knocks Vanko out cold.
“There… Mr. Stark, with all due respect, there is no answer I can give you that will make you feel better,” Steve answered kindly but honestly, and still Tony wanted to be sick. It was too easy to read between the lines.
“Mom, I don’t exactly know,” Tony said quietly; while speaking for Steve wasn’t his first choice, he needed his mom to stop her line of questioning. He pressed his cheek against the side of Steve’s head and rubbed slow, soothing circles over his shoulder, until Steve’s posture started to relax. Little by little, his hands slipped from his ears. “Foster kid, CPS,” he finally told his mom, as if that was all that needed to be said.
Tony sat obediently at his feet, squeezed in between Steve’s knees with his cheek pillowed against Steve’s thigh. He had done so well adjusting to his life as a kept pet, and Steve couldn’t be more pleased. Every look and touch had been ignored or avoided, and even though Tony couldn’t understand any of the droning lecture, he had sat perfectly still from the beginning.
Pepper’s only outward sign of confusion was a small wrinkle between her eyebrows. “With all due respect, it is part of their job to care for His Majesty. You can trust them.”
“You made that face,” Steve whispered, drawing a finger over Tony’s forehead and temple before going back to combing his fingers through Tony’s hair; slowly, he started to rub his fingertips over Tony’s scalp, and before Tony knew what to expect, Steve’s strong fingers were finding the knots of tension over his scalp and the base of his neck.
Tony’s working hours were the palace’s worst kept secret. Whether it was intuited from the wide variety of innovative products that went on the global market year after year, or some enterprising staff member let it slip to the press, the people of Consone were well aware their monarch did not spend his days kicking back at the palace feasting on powdered bon-bons. Their respect and support meant everything to Tony, so when circumstances conspired to prevent him from working, Tony fought back tooth and nail.
“It is water. Drink it,” Tony said as he pressed a tall cup with a straw into Steve’s hands. Steve looked at the cup, then looked at Tony. Slowly, he started to believe he was alive again.
Like most interviewers, she thanked them, looked interested, but somehow wove off with her own questions anyway. “That’s, that’s beautifully put. You both clearly care about these characters. Was that a product of your interactions on set? You share a lot of screen time in this movie, did you do anything together off-set as well?”
“We would like to speak with your agent—” Steve started to tell him, but Tony wouldn’t even let him finish the question in his anxious rush to be helpful.
“After we lost your father, God rest his soul, I had to work two nursing jobs to put food on the table, and to get you through college. To bring you up to the man you are today. You’re my son, my only child. I want you to be happy; I want you to have a family! Can you blame me for wanting to be introduced to a man who is so dear to you?”
Neither Tony nor Steve made another sound, and soon Dr. Odinson felt comfortable enough to sit down in his armchair again, settling down with his notepad and his pen.
“I’m not letting you go to sleep like this, Steve,” Tony decided for both of them. “You’ve got a whole movie riding on you. We’ll watch it together; pull up the video.”
“I’m okay, I promise,” Steve assured him, pausing long enough to take Tony’s hand in his and press a soft kiss into his palm. “I’ll be right back.”
There were too many doors in this damn suite, and Steve was ready to give up and fuck Tony in the bubbling hot water with the massaging jets and breathtaking view when Tony let his earlobe out between his teeth.
“Not everyone leaves room for Jesus, Tony,” Steve murmured, struggling not to get too distracted by the smell of Tony’s hair and how soft it looked and how badly he just wanted to nuzzle in close and wrap Tony in his arms and maybe carry him to bed and peel him out of the tuxedo and—
Before he could grab her, Marple snatched up his favorite rimming butt plug and took off like a shot.
“You wouldn’t,” Steve said with absolute conviction. There wasn’t a doubt in his mind. “We’ll figure it out, Buck.”
“Had to use someone’s proportions,” Tony confirmed with a little shrug, but when he caught the flash of excitement in Steve’s eyes, he quickly understood.
Tony knew where that was, and he quickly led the way. Except, they didn’t meet the Governor in the conference hall. His face was instead projected through a live VideoGram, a vivid, three-dimensional projection on a flexiglass screen.
“And, you know. I might have snooped around while you questioned people last time we were there,” Tony told him before he changed his mind. Trusting people in journalism was a bad idea, but Steve was something else. Tony was trying to be better about treating him accordingly. “Did you know he’s got surgeons on his payroll? Not a few doctors, Steve, I’m talking a stable of experts in reconstructive surgery or, or serious trauma. People who’re paid millions treat extreme athletes and crazy MMA fighters.”
They took the tube to Blackfriars, and walked to what had once been the heart of the capital. London was once protected by city walls, and Ludgate street survived from a time when it had been the westernmost gate into the city. Food was the center of social life in those days, it was a part of the weekly routine that brought people out of the house to see familiar faces and good friends.
“Because I am at home and comfortable, and wanted to assure myself I don't have to leave,” Thor explained honestly. Tony couldn’t find a flaw in that logic.
“Tony, wait, stop—” Steve gasped, but the way his hips thrust into Tony’s palm made it clear what his body wanted. His downstairs brain had clearly taken over the reins.
Steve caught the chain and planted his feet. With one firm pull, he plucked the rider clean off and threw him into the marble walls of Taco Bell. The bike veered off uncontrollably into the truck, and from out of the shadows five more figures rushed after it. Steve took off in a dead sprint to intercept them when a series of explosions blew two tires and the side door off the truck.
As if the experience had not been mortifying already, Tony rubbed both hands over his blushing face and groaned into his palms, as if hiding himself from the world would somehow help him escape this minor nightmare.
“Just because I’m here doesn’t mean you can ignore your phone, babe,” he informed Steve in quiet, laughing words. “Peggy wants you to call her back.”
, moving them to the bed and ease them back down, taking care with laying Tony back on the sheets and following him down, covering him, rocking slowly and gently into him through his orgasm.
“Two doors down to the right,” Steve told him, “oh, and mind your step: the bathroom’s floor is an inch lower than the rest of the house.”
“I’m fucking hungry,” the donkey complained after licking Tony’s plate clean, and Tony frowned. “You got any more turnips?”
When Steve couldn’t muster more than a slight shrug, Sharon made sure to look away and gather her thoughts. She had never seen her boss insecure before, and it made her uncomfortable to think of him as anything but confident and assertive.
“Her body, her choice,” Channing declared before anyone else could second Rob’s criticism, a sentiment shared and seconded loudly by applause from the audience.
In lieu of being absorbed into the earth’s crust of fellow half-wits, Tony gave himself two seconds to freak out by curling in on himself and rubbing his hands over his face, but then he took a deep breath and quickly sat up in his seat.
Steve jumped in his seat at the sound of Sharon’s voice, his hand shooting straight up to avoid smudging his charcoal figure drawing. It was part of his midterm assignment, a revived memory of Tony lounging in the bed loft of the treehouse under a glass roof and warm sunlight, naked and facing away from view. His fingers curled into a loose fist in his sleep, his hair fell in soft waves around his face, and the long, lean lines of his body whispered of a subtle power others dreamed to possess.
Two soldiers elected to walk back to their posts so that Steve and Bucky could make the return journey on horseback. They were both quickly directed to the showers and given all they needed to wash up, including fresh clothes to wear. The limited availability of spare clothing at the outpost meant that both Bucky and Steve were left with the green and gold colors of the cavalry and their unmistakable insignia, the crossed sword and trumpet.
“Happens every day,” the man muttered with a defeated sigh, but then seemed to regroup and give Steve a look of wry amusement. “So, what’s so special about this Sharon? Is your man not out of the closet or something?”
“Then why are you targeting my son?” Howard demanded, somehow angrier now that he’d been proved wrong. “Tony… has a big heart. When he falls, he falls hard and fast. You’ve known him less than a week, and you’re already considering marriage?”
“I’ll find something. Thanks, Happy,” Steve replied, and with a sweep of his finger he called up the media control panel on the backseat console. In no time he had the sixth episode of the Last Days of August pulled up, and as they crawled through the Manhattan afternoon traffic, he caught up on Jon Ronson’s podcast.
“Time is relative,” Jane reminded him with hearts in her eyes. “Pepper’s engaged, James is dating an amazing woman… you’ll graduate in seven months and what will you have to show for it? A robot?”
Tony steeled himself for the opportunity to do better. He would do better - he’d show Steve he could do better, he could make Steve proud.
“Anything to keep the bitches happy,” Tony said with a self-satisfied grin, and he snickered shamelessly in his triumph when Steve facepalmed (loudly).
“That will be all for now, Mr. Stark,” Steve said loudly before whatever curses Bucky was chewing on became a problem. “We will have a patrol car take you home. We will be in touch if we need further answers, but in the meantime, if you think of anything,” he said as he pulled his card out of the evidence folder. “My personal number is on the back. Day or night, if you think of anything, call me.”
Tony pressed his lips together before he continued doing what they had agreed they (he) wouldn’t do. He needed time to brace himself for the truth, but eventually he nodded his understanding and said, “I didn’t make any plans for our anniversary.”
“Possibly,” Steve started to say, not that he could think too straight after that confession. Never meet your heroes, they said.
It already felt like all eyes at 1PP were collectively turned on him. Steve could all but feel them breathing down his neck for breaks in the case and viable suspects. The last thing he needed was Bucky perched on his desk smelling like bacon rolls he hadn’t brought to share and grumbling about Tony Stark’s late night call.
“Mom, I don’t know what to do,” he confided in her one afternoon while the kids were at recess. “What am I supposed to do? I care about him, but I can’t get the day started when he’s there. And my routine is good, it works.”
A little alcove in the hallway leading to the coat room had three doors on it, two for bathrooms, and the third had a sign that clearly stated, ‘Restricted Area - Staff Only.’ Tony couldn’t have cared less. With a firm grip of Steve’s belt, Tony towed him into the alcove and pushed Steve up against the door where he finally, after nearly long two hours of small talk, was free to kiss that knowing smirk off Steve’s sweet lips.
“Five exclamation marks,” Steve noted dryly, interrupting her with the only thought he had on the issue. With his poor approval of Jean clearly expressed, he easily moved on. “Table everything; Sitwell first.”
“Won’t there be some big party tonight?” Tony asked even though Steve had crawled into Tony’s unmade bed several minutes ago and stretched out like he belonged there. Steve turned his head and cracked an eye open to respond with droll disbelief with a finely articulated arch of his brow.
The workshop was dark and abandoned on a Friday night, except for the section allocated to Tony. Steve could see the light on in the distance, and he could hear the soft, intermittent chirps Dum-E made whenever Tony ran through Dum-E’s protocols.
The lights were turned down, but Tony’s arms continued to hold him close—continued to keep him safe.
“Where are we even going?” Tony finally managed to ask as they tripped their way up the stairs, and finally, as they emerged on ground level and sobered in the fresh air, Steve let him go.
In their respective childhood kingdoms, Tony and Steve both grew up celebrating Christmas, but in vastly different ways. Due to its historic poverty and agrarian culture, Terrini did not develop into populous cities or benefit from widespread post-industrial development. Much like their Catholic Italian neighbors to the south, the people of Terrini celebrated Christmas hand in hand with the church. Its sparse population and scattered villages meant that the church became the uniting institution for all holidays around the year. For Christmas, large, elaborate nativity scenes brought a community together, from the carpenters who carved the trough and the statues, the grandmothers who sewed their costumes, to the school children who painted the lightbulbs and dipped wax candles to decorate the scenes. A pageantry of lights, craftsmanship, and community poured together over potlucks and folk music to celebrate family and community on the holiest nights of the year.
He pulled out the pan of cinnamon rolls out of the oven and sat it down on the marble counter. Giving the frosting a final few turns with the whisk, he turned it out over the pan to all but drown the rolls in the maple frosting.
It wasn’t until the masters scrubbed their big paws over the head of Tony’s cock that he sucked in a startled breath of terror. Fear spread like an icy chill through Tony’s veins and his whole existence narrowed down to those stone cold talons scraping over his unprotected cock. He could taste blood in his mouth, he forgot how to breathe, but Steve wouldn’t acknowledge him or take their hands off of him. All Tony could do was stand there and squeeze his eyes shut. He bit down on his lip to muffle his quiet sobs of shame as the masters marveled at the way Tony’s cock inevitably filled in their paws, growing long and thick and wet with precome. He could hear them speaking unintelligible words amongst themselves, as if he was no more than an exotic trinket to explore.
Steve smiled at him as if he wasn’t scared. As if he wasn’t worried. As if Bucky and Sam’s words weren’t still echoing in his thoughts.
“You are rich,” Steve still mumbled incoherently. He couldn’t stop staring at the far left side of the living room where the wall pushed out into a point like the bow of a ship, creating a tucked-away, triangular alcove where a large mahogany table was flanked on all sides by plush leather chairs. It was dark, imposing, and polished to a shine. It looked like money.
With that, Steve turned on his heel and strode away. Maria fell in beside him immediately, looking all but stunned.
“With any luck we’ll have five of them by the end of the week. One guy isn’t responding to anything yet, we’ll bring him on something else next week if we have to.”
“I haven’t,” Steve said honestly, and Tony’s face warmed with excitement, thrilled as he always was to introduce Steve to something new.
His front door blew inward in a shattered chunks of wood. 006 didn’t even flinch as Steve barrelled into Tony’s flat, unloading one full mag after another after her graceful, controlled vault out through Tony’s window.
“No, he’s in admin,” Jane explained, too busy taking in the perfectly decadent view to notice the kaleidoscope of emotions flickering across Tony’s face. “Higher up in management; Thor said he’s basically the guy who makes the pediatric department go.”
“He set the new world records, did he not?” she wondered, and her recognition of a guest had Graham beaming with a smile.
Tony was about to answer him, but Steve bowed his head to take his lips in a tender kiss. Tony moaned with surprised delight and eagerly responded, deepening the kiss with a sudden needful hunger until Steve experimentally rocked his hips forward; a whimper escaped between them as Tony’s mouth fell open in surprise, and Steve swallowed it with another kiss, and another, soothing Tony with a string of worshiping and playful kisses as he gradually, carefully, built up to a slow, shallow rhythm.
Steve stood and took the remote from Bucky to mute the commentary. “What is the nearest foreign airport to Lumine?”
“Oh, god,” he whined miserably as Tony and the woman smiled and laughed together. He was even helping her arrange her scarf just so, as if he needed an excuse to continue being near her. “She really is beautiful.”
By the time they made it to the Tower of London, saw the remains of London’s original city wall, and took the tube back to Steve’s place, Steve was at the end of his rope. He tried to keep it together, but either he was losing his touch, or Tony simply knew him too well. They went back and left the groceries for another day.
Steve grinned like a fool. Like that was a question he’d ever have to think twice about. “I’d like that, Tony.”
“Well, that was quick,” Bucky observed quietly. Steve, on the other hand, flew to the window like a suicidal bird to see this beautiful woman with legs for days.
“I will use it sparingly,” Tony promised, and to be on the safe side, bowed his head to press an affectionate little kiss to Steve’s shoulder. He felt more than saw Steve’s huff of amusement, but he straightened and held up his canvas bag before there was any time for Steve to comment. “Stopped on the way for snacks. You’re lucky: no cashews.”
In the two weeks leading up to the demonstration, Steve gave Tony a break from harvesting. He didn’t bother framing it as mercy. The interlude, however brief, was intended to help the students deal with Terrans who weren’t routinely penetrated. Tony hadn’t been worried when Steve first told him, but as it turned out, Steve knew him best. From the start, he promised Tony that he could taste his cock twice a day to help get through the dry spell.
“Not much, but it sounded rough,” Tony replied with a wry twist of his lips. “We’ll catch them for breakfast before their flight. Sam looked pretty excited about Paris. Something about eating his weight in cheese?”
Tony gave him a squeeze and smiled up at him with nothing but affection. “Can’t I even pretend to be jealous?”
Steve opened the door without knocking and entered Sharon’s office with his usual strut. He did not limp, he did not favor his right side, and his sunny smile did not falter.
Maybe Steve would even let some of them practice on him, finger and pry him open, load him with a canister.
“Yeah, I’ll get them. Hopefully you’ll find more than I did,” Steve said with a wry smile. He’d put it all aside to get his coursework done, so he left her in the small sitting area while he got the case files out of the bag he’d taken to the library earlier.
“I will need updates every four days,” Yinsen said after some moments of silent consideration. “De-identified profiles on each date. Full draft in twelve days, publish in fourteen. Good; go.”
“Who want our products because we’re the best, and I need to be home tonight,” Tony insisted again, completely unmoved by her arguments. “Someone who is very much
With every thrust of Steve’s hands, Tony’s t-shirt rode higher, revealing the smooth canvas of finger-shaped bruises painted across Tony’s olive skin. “You let someone do this to you?” Steve murmured, keeping his voice low in the hopes of keeping his unwarranted feelings to himself.
“Our society is beyond cash, Captain,” one of the gold class lieutenants seated at the table replied with a smug twist of her lips. “Credits are passed using codes, which by the brilliant Governor Alexander G. Pierce’s ingenious design cannot be stolen.”
Warm, lube coated fingers stroked over his spit-slick hole before slowly pressing in, first only with one gentle finger, but as he pressed enough lube into Tony’s body, Steve eased a second finger into him. In every other way they lay motionless, back to front and breathing together. Deprived of his sight, Tony’s world narrowed down to the two long, thick fingers thrusting in and out of him, patiently scissoring and stretching him open. Like this was all that mattered. Steve was devoted to his task, unhurried and thorough, despite how Tony whimpered or begged for him to get on with it, to hurry up.
Steve turned after his voice like a flower searching for the sunshine, and rather than waiting for Tony to push his way past the six women watching Steve stack chairs, he politely excused himself to see Tony.
How he’d lost sight of reality, he wasn’t sure, but any way you looked at it, Steve was anything but alone. If anything was worth the work, it was love, but he’d be a fool to think his life wasn’t full of love without Brock in it.
Steve tried. He closed his eyes and he tried. Tony washed his chest (slowly and repeatedly), then worked his way down Steve’s torso to his legs. His gentle touch calmed Steve’s racing thoughts somewhat, but peace was hard to find. The hand-off to the FBI kept creeping into his thoughts, and if he was honest, as bone tired as he was, a part of him wished he had enough energy to work on the new potential lead Tony had found.
“You got some good dicking, didn’t you?” Four Drink Thor teased obnoxiously in a loud sing-song. “Works every time! You know, there was this one time—”
“It means, if you are willing to be yourself with me, and keep our relationship out of your article, then I have some vacation days I could spare,” Steve replied. “Would five days be enough?”
Bucky’s voice woke Steve out of his happy little daydream, stealing him away from coveted, intimate memories of Tony in his bed earlier that morning. He looked up from his phone where he’d been scrolling absently through photos of Tony ‘trying’ (and failing) to make a pavlova the other week, as if sitting on the front steps of your building and staring at pictures of your boyfriend was a perfectly normal passtime.
“You didn’t have to do this, you know,” Steve said quietly. “There were plenty of people who could have taken me home.”
" (Neapolitan Struffoli's original recipe for Christmas). Google translate is great, but really, you can also easily follow along with the photographs. Alternatively,
“Your repeated violation of the verbal morality statute in a public space is a danger to the emotional sanctity of women and children and therefore I am required to notify the New Yorseylvanian Police Department of your actions. Please remain patient for your reprimand.”
“Then you know, it just takes over. There’s nothing you can do about it. So I turned to him and I said, ‘Would you like to follow me to my college and I’ll suck you off?’”
But it was the way Steve couldn't get enough of him, and how he couldn't stop growling 'mine' softly under his breath in equal measures of disbelief and incredulity that left Tony determined to learn what other fantasies Steve had always been too afraid to try.
“See? The future isn’t all bad,” Steve grinned, only half-joking. “So you went to the zoo with Bruce, you ran into Natasha with Clint’s kids, and…”
“Hang on,” Steve said without thinking, and went to tug the door open real quick. “Almost ready, shoes.”
As much as Steve enjoyed having his hands where he often felt they belonged, he couldn’t take it anymore. He scrubbed his hands over his face slowly, muffling a grunt of frustration and taking a moment to remind himself that he knew exactly what Tony was going through. He’d just never had to deal with himself before, and karma was - apparently - a bitch.
Tony frowned a little at Steve’s question, then stepped in a little closer to quietly ask, “Were you not able to use the facilities at the prison, Steve Rogers?”
“I’m just gonna cut to the chase. I’ve been trying to think of how to say it, but nothing I’ve rehearsed sounds any better than the truth. So, basically, all the sexual material in my books either come from my imagination,
Steve’s question died on his lips as a delicate hand snaked around Brock’s chest from behind. Brock turned and reached for the hand that caressed his broad, muscular chest with proprietary ease, and brought the owner of the hand around to his side to present her to Steve.
His heart raced hard and fast in his chest, and Steve stared at Howard, stared at the ring boxes. If Howard only knew what he held in his hands. They were supposed to be Steve’s ticket to stability, the key to the life he had worked so hard to achieve, and a career in which he could thrive.
By the end of his consultancy, Tony could confidently say he’d done everything he set out to do. Once the other websites got with the program, Tony had the data necessary to make a solid case for their theory - enough so that Captain Carter agreed to back their play. Most importantly, he gave them six viable suspects: six sugar daddies that the four victims all met within the weeks leading to their disappearances.
As midterms approached, hanging out turned into weekly quizzing, where Steve and Erin - who was studying for her Associate’s in accounting - answered quick-fire questions that Paulette and Sam read off cards (and sometimes made up, just to throw them off).
From start to finish, it didn’t take half an hour. Jane conferred the credits and led the way back to the car.
“I know you do, pal,” Bruce replied quietly, then, feeling like words were not enough, he reached over to rub at Thor’s shoulder in a comforting, if awkward, gesture.
“Oh, no—sweetheart, I, I’m sorry, everything is okay, I forgot the time!” Steve rushed to say, “I’m—everything is okay, go back to sleep. Call me when you’re free!”
Tony clearly frowned by Steve’s unexpected suggestion, but Steve got out of there before Tony could ask him any more questions and wake up further. Steve was still waking up himself as he wandered down the stairs, got the coffee started, and with a big yawn he opened the door to grab the morning paper.
This close, there was nothing Steve could hide from him. Tony lifted and rolled his hips over the growing bulge in Steve’s jeans and watched, mesmerized, as Steve’s eyes fluttered closed for a beat and his lips parted in a soft gasp of unexpected pleasure.
Tony snickered quietly, but he didn’t bother answering. Instead, he reached to fix Clint’s tie. “There,” he said when he’d smoothed it out and slid it into place. “I hope Laura at least knows how to tie a tie.”
Steve glanced at Tony, but Tony was too starstruck to notice. Whoever this man was, Tony’s full attention was on him. Steve frowned to himself. What did he have left to lose?
As soon as he could, Steve tore off the cloth covering his eyes and stared after Tony. His eyes watered and he blinked furiously while his pupils dilated erratically in their effort to focus in the forgotten intensity of natural sunlight.
A dip in the road had Dummy stumbling forward at over thirty miles an hour, and Tony went flying over his neck.
“Please,” Tony begged with a hitch in his voice, his hips stuttering up for attention. “Fuck—Steve, I’m so close.”
In the final seconds of the footage, the five stealth planes took formation around the leading jet and vanished into thin air.
His intentions did not go unnoticed. By the second throw, Tony made a point to twist in his seat when possible to meet Steve’s wide-eyed, hungry gaze. His hips undulated with enviable ease, elegant and strong. Every time Tony rolled his body forward, he rose in his seat to follow through with this whole body, until his back bowed in a smooth backbend. Every time the bull spun so Tony faced away, Steve threw the bull back to personally indulge in seeing Tony’s firm, round ass rise and flex as he squeezed his thighs around the girth of the rearing bull.
“Then why don’t you go eat your tasty lunch, and I’ll help the kids if they have any questions. And Friday night, I’ll toss your salad and we’ll see how good it really can be,” Tony murmured quietly and so matter-of-factly that Steve nearly choked on air.
“Tony, you’re going to give him so many nightmares, what were you thinking!” Steve managed through his laughter. “That’s terrible, that’s a really graphic show! That poor kid.”
Heat coiled deep in Steve’s gut when he first heard Tony’s broken, breathless cry. He fell back into bed and stared unblinking at the dark screen. Slowly his eyes adjusted enough to make out the outline of Tony’s body on his knees in bed, his face pressed into the mattress while he rutted into his own fist for release.
Tentatively, Tony ran his hands over his own body, pinching and tugging at his bruised nipple in one hand, until he could twist and pull it just right to make his body jerk with pain. While he continued to experiment and play with his nipples with one hand, he reached down with the other to touch his cock, stroking it carefully, trying to avoid the cuts and bruises left behind by the customer with the scaly palms. But despite how careful he was, his hands inevitably pinched or squeezed over a pinch or a cut, and he would hiss and jolt so badly that the audience got repeated demonstrations of the full length of Steve’s cock impaling Tony.
“No!” Tony grunted emphatically, and before Steve could do much to stop him, Tony tried to push himself upright in bed. His arms, otherwise so strong and capable, wobbled under his weight. He struggled to open his eyes, and when he did, he couldn’t focus.
“Kisses?” Tony whispered playfully, and Steve kept smiling at him, adoring and inviting, until he was distracted by the soft touch of Tony’s lips.
“Look, I’m not doing anything crazy—nothing that crosses the line,” Tony said, though neither Bruce nor Thor seemed that convinced. “Come on, think about it! Bad nicknames, poor grammar—being clingy? I’m just, doing it on overload to speed up the process. Soon, he is going to snap, and then our readers will get a first-hand account of what a man does to a woman he wants to hurt. Whether it’s verbal, emotional, physical—and, importantly, all the warning signs leading up to it.”
“Scraps are not like us, Steve Rogers. They are people who have elected to denounce Governor Alexander G. Pierce’s generous and inclusive way of life. Not one of them would be turned away should they register and assimilate to the Governor’s rules. They would never know hunger or thirst. Instead they choose to live underground, defiling our government buildings and pilfering scarce commodities.”
Steve looked like he didn’t know whether to sigh, glower, or rub at the fresh headache growing behind his eyes first. Instead, he followed Tony’s line of sight to his own partner.
After another beat of silent reflection, Sarah seemed to make up her mind. She smiled and nodded in understanding. “What’s your plan?”
Steve reached under Tony’s body and stopped his whole world by taking his softening cock in hand. With firm, quick pulls, Steve stroked him back to hardness. His ass stilled burned from the unyielding canister the student had no coordination in his movements, but Tony bowed off the cushioned platform chasing Steve’s glorious hand that so quickly reminded him he was desperate for release.
Steve stared between the two blue-blood women ganging up on him like the high-class bullies they were. He fought back tears of humiliation, desperate not to let them see how their words hurt him. He wanted to speak up, to say something in his own defense, but the way Professor Stromwell looked at him made it clear he had no room for argument.
The man grunted in annoyance. “Never mind. I suppose I should let you go.” he signaled to one of his men, who stepped forward and let Tony’s hands free.
Steve’s usually had something to do with learning more about the 21st Century, so generally watching a modern movie, or going to a museum.
“We’ll make sure you get a good nights sleep?” Steve offered from behind Bucky. “We’ve all had a long day, sweetheart. Let us take care of you.”
It was fine for a few rounds. Clint was dared to post weird things to his twitter. They found out Thor’s favorite (earth) animal was the whale.
Prompt: Eventual Poly avengers, fighting for Tony’s attention and/or affection, with an oblivious Tony. Would really appreciate Bucky being included. (@Cheyenne Phillippe on AO3)
The rules were simple: when it was your turn you picked the activity, but the others had veto power (it had to be unanimous). One could trade their turn to another in exchange for favors. Everyone had to participate (within reason).
“You seem honest,” Gorilla guy told him. “I have no interest in your American money, Hanuman provides everything my tribe needs.”
Imagine Tony seeing Wakandanese weapons for the first time and within literal minutes he knows how to use one, and the boys are just like "whut" "guys, I used to build weapons I know how this stuff works no matter how high tech." (requested by anonymous on tumblr)
“This very well could have been lethal!”  Steve bellowed.  “Putting four humans, one who is The Hulk, in a very cold place without warning or heat could have good and well killed all of us.”
“C'mere.” Bucky patted the couch, making a space between him and Tony. “There’s plenty o’ room right here between us.”
“Duh, we’re science bros. We know everything about each other.” Tony wiggled his eyebrows mischievously.
T’challa’s eyes nearly popped out of his skull. ‘My love’???? Apparently this was much more serious than he’d realized.
Bucky came a little closer until he could see himself in the phone that Dum-E was holding up. “Hey,” he said gruffly. He wasn’t sure how comfortable he was in front of a camera, but Tony seemed completely at ease.
“You’re just sore because I didn’t try and seduce you too, aren’t you, sweetheart?” Steve bent down and whispered something NSFLT (not safe for laser tagging) in his ear. “Better?”
Within five minutes, the air was full of the sound of the quinjet. Tony, stuck in his immobile armour, couldn’t signal to them, but his suit stood out starkly enough against the white landscape.
Nat waved her hand dismissively. “It’s not about the money, I just think a DIY is better for bonding. No strangers listening in on our conversations, more … contact.”
Praises spilled past T’challa and M’baku’s lips like a waterfall, telling him how well he took it, how good he looked, how good he was-
“Friend Banner is correct,” Thor said, “and I can only speak for myself -- but I am also happy to give physical comfort to anyone in need as well.”
“I dream about the plane going down, and  losing Bucky, and sometimes about losing you guys.”  Steve said quietly.
Prompt: Bucky and Clint have been courting the genius for weeks, but they haven't really been done in the way the genius would notice, given his obliviousness to everything. It takes Laura and Steve telling their exes to just come out with it (get your head out of your ass Clint) (You used to be a lot better at this, Buck), and thus begins the Tony-Bucky-Clint relationship.
Bucky started prodding them all to the bed. “Doll, we’re sorry we didn’t realize. From now on you’re going to have to let someone check you over after battles even if you think your fine. If you really can’t feel that,” he gestured to Tony’s torso, “then you might someday have damage that can’t be undone. We don’t wanna see you get hurt.”
They made him swear not to do that for the rest of the games (because just one wouldn’t cut it, obviously).
For a few heartstopping seconds, Tony wondered if they’d all been injured in the collison. Then the emergency side door was forcefully opened, and Steve came tumbling out.
Then, they finally got their chance. Tony was sending Dum-E to a … cat retreat? Some ridiculous rich person pet thing. But Bucky and Steve didn’t care how ridiculous it was because THEY’D HAVE THEIR CHANCE TO GET WITH TONY.
Prompt: Poly avengers where they see Tony without his lifts on for the first time and freak out over how smol he is. (From a tumblr anon)
Still, they couldn’t help but love the little bastard. Tony loved him, and he loved Tony. And honestly, he was probably just being protective since they hadn’t asked for the cat’s blessings.
Arguing started. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to cuddle with each other, but they all saw Tony the least!
To cover up his awkward almost blush, he raised an eyebrow judgily. “Is this all you eat?” He gestured at Clint’s basket which was already filled with TV dinners and tater tots.
Steve pulled Tony on top of him in a position that would be better on the inventor’s neck and back. Clint draped the blanket over the three of them.
Tony’s eyes widened. “Holy shit! I’m dating the Avengers? Why didn’t anyone tell me?” He spun around to look at all of them, looking entirely stunned. “Am I dating you guys too?” Tony gestured at Bucky and Sam. “Holy fuck, I am, aren’t I?” He was sounding slightly hysterical.
From Caitlin - Hm...perhaps when the team get back, they tear into Fury about how the 'team building' exercise could've caused them to end up far worse than they did?
From the bed, Tony let out a long low groan. “Can you guys please either leave or come back to bed? I’m trying to sleep here.”
He was uncomfortably aware that EMP’s rendered only him useless.  Cap still had the shield, Bruce could still Hulk-out, Clint could manually reach his arrows, even without the electric swivelling quiver, Nat still had knives and Thor could still use his hammer.  The suit on the other hand, was now reduced to a hunk of metal.
“Fair enough,” Tony conceded. He’d never had to rely on free stuff but he could understand that people with less than him enjoyed it.  And … he could see why Clint liked going to the supermarket so much. It was nice, the anonymity, being surrounded by people who weren’t expecting anything of him, and of course, food.
“Sorry,” Tony said quietly. “You don’t have to be thorough if it’s too much. I can just do you instead.”
“Anyways, I’ll see you all later,” Tony said. “I need to sign some stuff for Pepper. I’ll be back for dinner.” As he shuffled away they heard him mutter, “What I wouldn’t give to get in the middle of that.”
Natasha was the one who fixed it, naturally. She had to do everything herself, since the other occupants of the tower were imbeciles, the lot of them. It only took nine words.
Fury was starting to lose his bluster. “Well you bonded, and that’s the important thing. My plan worked.”
Tony gingerly shimmied out of his pants, trying to keep the blanket somewhat draped around him both to keep warm and protect his teammates eyes.
And Tony, he still picked varied activities, depending on the week. But now, every Tony night ended with the whole team crammed onto one couch, cuddling the heck out of each other, just talking.
“What?  It’s supposed to be team bonding anyways, and it’s going to be really boring sitting around and doing nothing.”
The next person who came up the stairs was Tony, and his presence was announced by … a meowing. Fuck.
Tony banged his fists uselessly on his gorilla of a boyfriend’s back uselessly, immediately stopping because it made him feel too much like a damsel in distress. He sighed in defeat as he was carried out. Being fucked for the rest of the day wasn’t the worst thing, Tony supposed.
“So. Congratulations,” Steve managed, with an awful forced smile. “I hope you’ll be happy together. If one of you hurts the other I’ll give you a harsh glare of disappointment.” His attempt at humor fell horribly flat.
It was inevitable that they’d learn things about each other, since they were all living in the same tower now. It was a slow process though, since they each had their own floor. At first bumping into each other was a bit of a rare occurrence.
Steve was more along the lines of, “That cat has it out for us and if he wasn’t so adorable and Tony didn’t love him so much, I’d punt him into the sun.”
Clint waved enthusiastically as they walked up to the duo. He dumped his basket unceremoniously into the cart. “Me and Tony got all the junk.”
They took turns bringing food down to Tony since he often forgot to eat. If they said they’d made it and needed someone to try it, he’d always be willing to give it a few bites.
Prompt: Might I interest you in, instead of Obie paying the Ten Rings to kill Tony at a demo in Afghanistan, he tries to hire M'Baku and his tribe when Tony gets a spot in a conference for Wakanda's entrance to the world? Requested by @Shi-Toyu on tumblr.
“We’ll be doing our own team bonding from now on.”  Steve growled.  “You and S.H.I.E.L.D can stay out of our business.”
M’baku nearly hurled him at the bed. All he knew is that he definitely bounced a few times before the kings pounced and started stripping his clothes off.
He was going to kill the new handler. He and Tony had been told to investigate the basement together.
Tony could feel M’baku pressing into his entrance and helped him along, driving his body backwards onto the length with enthusiasm. He loved it, being on all fours, filled from both ends.
Prompt: I was wondering if you could do a infinity war AU with tony on earth in wakanda for t'challa/tony/m'baku. (Except the combined awesomeness of the three make it to where they kick giant grapes ass). From a Tumblr anon
“Aww, but Bucky Nat and I would love that,” Clint said with a pout. “Don’t listen to him Tony, you can do whatever you want. It’s your tower.”
“There’s an ice cream parlor next door,” The attendant offered. “Um.” She let out a squeaky cough. “Could I get your autographs?”
It was terrifying, looking down at Tony in the hospital bed although scans had shown no permanent rain damage, which was relieving. It seemed he only had a very minor concussion which would probably leave him a bit confused for the next few days.
“Cap and Thor. You guys generate more body heat than the rest of us, so prepare to become our personal heaters.” Natasha announced.
Bucky had his answer ready. “Well doll, I just seen you doin’ your live-streams and I just  … love watching you. And hearin’ you talk. And the way you go out of your way to help complete strangers fix their things.”
She was right, Steve thought, head drooping. He had to be mature about this. So even though he wasn’t quite ready, he sat down with Bucky and Tony. (gritting his teeth over the way they snuggled together on the long couch. There was plenty of room there for them to sit far apart.)
“There’s a manual unlocking mechanism under a panel on the side.” Tony told him. “You know, so that I won’t accidentally get ejected out of it during battle.”
M’baku picked Tony up and tossed him over his shoulder like a caveman. “The tour is over, we must go defile you now.”
He also wasn’t the only one.  Clint woke up and immediately reached for his bow before realizing where he was.  Steve woke up yelling “Bucky!”  and Bruce curled into him comfortingly.
“You make a good point.” Bucky grinned, “Tony, will you do me the honour of letting me take you out on a date?”
But he definitely wasn’t thinking about then when he felt one of M’baku’s thick fingers pressing into him. He hadn’t been expecting it- he gagged, and T’challa hurriedly withdrew from Tony’s mouth.
“I think you mean tomorrow,” Bruce corrected, with a glance at his watch. “We’re having a slumber party in Thor’s bed tonight.”
Tony had never joined them for breakfast before. Also … he was barefoot. And he was tiny. Everyone stopped chattering and a silence fell as they all took him in. Tony froze.
After the inventor had finally left to invent, Natasha said, “Whose turn is it to bring Tony and Bruce lunch today?”
Clint gave him an absolutely filthy grin and Tony’s stomach swooped. “We’ll see about that.” The archer winked and licked his lips and- what was happening here?
They all watched him with baited breath, hoping against hope they hadn’t woken him. Tony just pushed his face deeper into Steve’s stomach and quieted down again.
Tony’s face when he fell off of a stack made of Clint and Thor and into Steve’s arm that night was priceless.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Tony then. You’re going to need to suit up. The mission is in the middle of nowhere, and it’s cold.”
Sam, who had witnessed the failed kissing debacle and was also horrified, jerked up. “There’s worse?”
“I am surprisingly Very Okay with That,” Tony announced. That was a lie. It was not surprising at all.
“Which we do sometimes,” Steve amended, “Because he deserves all the food and all the sex for being awesome. But also we do it because you know, we want to.”
“Alright!” Clint said once they had made it to the store. The team quickly dispersed without a backwards glance. “Everyone’s got their shopping lists except you so you’re coming with me.” Then he
“Oh please.”  Fury scoffed.  “Stark and Banner are geniuses. There was no way any of you could have died.”
“I want them on my cock,” M’baku agreed. He started divesting himself of his own garments. T’challa followed suit.
They hovered at the sides of the door, like bodyguards, facing the stairs, waiting for Tony’s head to appear over the landing.
A few hours later they had finally been rescued. Bucky had talked to Tony the entire time they were trapped. Tony had only woken up once, briefly. He’d seemed very confused, but then he’d just said, “It’s fine. You’ll take care of me.” And then he’d lost consciousness again.
Naturally though, he began to get suspicious. Tony was a genius, after all. So when it came to his turn and he said they should play party games starting with truth or dare, they all exchanged nervous glances.
The genius shook his head, “Shit, I said that out loud, didn’t I? It’s all good. Thanks for saying that.”
Steve had been stomping around the tower in a storm cloud and no one knew why. Well, except Natasha. She knew everything.
Tony nodded. “I’ll be with you in one moment, just let me finish up here? I was just telling someone how to fix a microwave themselves.”
The quinjet seriously looked like something out of a teen sleepover.  There were pillows spread all across the space to serve as one huge makeshift mattress.  Everyone was draped over each other, surprisingly at ease, and fast asleep.
Okay, so this guy was probably Wakandan. He definitely had the accent, although it differed slightly from T’challa’s. Tony shrugged. He was terrified, but really? This was same old same old. And his heart was beating really fast but it was more from looking at the guy’s super muscular muscles than anything.
Prompt: Stucky wants Tony to join their relationship and they know that Tony likes them too but Tony's cat keeps cockblocking or preventing them from asking Tony out.
M’baku was holding a steaming cup of … well it wasn’t anything like the tea in the rest of the world. He looked possibly more dishevelled than Tony felt, although much more alert and far less worn out. So did T’challa, who had his arms around Tony.
Tony avoided sleeping at all if he could help it, but one thing he wouldn’t compromise on was sleeping in front of others. The nightmares were bad enough without an audience to experience his pitiful whimpers and screaming himself awake.
Steve and Bucky headed over to Tony’s apartment to wait by his door and whisk him off the second he came back, cat free.
Tony huddled reluctantly into Steve. He wasn’t so cool with so much touching from people besides for Pepper and Rhodey.
“Why on earth wouldn’t that apply to him?” T’challa demanded. Not that he had anything against Tony Stark, but what in Bast’s name was going on here?
Natasha was leaning idly against the side of a cart while Steve stood at the front of it, consulting a list.
All three of them usually slept with their shirts off. They liked the skin-on-skin contact, plus Tony said that the other two were like his own personal heaters.
Steve clearly wasn’t supposed to have heard that, but everyone kept forgetting about his enhanced hearing. Before he could stop it, a flame of hope blossomed in his chest. “Interested how?”
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” she said. “I must take this.” she hurried off for privacy. “Do not touch anything while I’m gone!” she called back to him.
“M’baku!” Tony protested. He looked pleadingly at T’challa. “C’mon honey cake, we can do this later right?”
M’baku wrapped the blanket he’d been holding around Tony and ran his hand over the man’s hair. There was a tenderness in his eyes that T’challa had seldom seen there before. “We won’t disturb you any further, my love,” he promised.
Finally, all three of them were naked. Tony had a hand around M’baku, who was growling enthusiastically and hardening quickly.
There were a few other people in the lab, but they mostly ignored him and he avoided getting in their way. Until- “You know that the princess was only joking.” The words were a question phrased as a statement.
