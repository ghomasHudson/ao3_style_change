They entered the building without difficulty, Natasha once more in the lead, Steve behind her. It seemed deserted--dark, quiet, but for their soft footsteps muffled on the floor.
"I do," Tony said immediately. He couldn't come up with anything to say after that so grabbed Steve's face and kissed him again, and really that was the most genius decision he could make.
“Oh, you mean your husband, right?” Sam asked with a grin. “He’s in the gym. But you might want to give him some space.”
“Oh, shit.” Tony had just spotted Steve halfway to the Avenger’s jet, which was preparing for takeoff. “Gotta go. Assuming I’m free to go?”
Tony sat up and pulled him into a hug, resting his chin on the top of Miles’ head. He knew it was the same drive that had pushed him, after his parents died, to try to make sure no one else lost their loved ones and went through what he had gone through. To do what needed to be done to make the world a safer place, to become a hero because the world needed heroes. “I love you, Miles. Your mom would be so proud of you, buddy. We’re all so proud of you.”
Carol handled the Power and Reality Stones. She seemed to know half of what they came to understand as the
, he wasn’t quite sure – when he stepped on something small and cylindrical, and suddenly went toppling backwards. Tony made a
A huge bar spread down the left side of the room, deep mahogany in colour and with a black marble finished surface on top. They were stocked with booze up to the eyeballs, it all on show in racks behind the bar. At the other side of the room tables were set out with chairs tucked neatly under them. The empty ones, anyway, which there weren’t a whole lot of – the place was pretty much packed solid.
“Speak for yourself,” Bucky huffed, flexing his heavily tattooed flesh and bone arm. “I’m in top physical condition -”
“You snitch to the cops,” the Red Skull yelled, manic grin on his face. “We take something you love.”
“Great,” Peter nodded. “You wanna take a left when you get inside and walk past the lockers; it’s the last door on your right. If you don’t know where any of your classes are today, you’re gonna wanna ask a teacher, not a kid. You probably won’t end up in the right class if you ask a kid.”
“He’s gonna be fine,” Steve told her, and didn’t know who he was trying to convince. “He’s gonna be fine.”
“Oh, believe me, he’s gone,” Tony snarled, and then, taking a deep breath, he forced himself to calm down for Peter’s sake. “Why don’t we give him a little severance package, huh?”
Tony just frowned deeper, and had to lean in to kiss her again. She grumbled and wiped her face as though completely put out by his affection, but Tony knew she secretly liked the attention.
Moving quickly towards the back of the auditorium, Steve made for his gym bag and unzipped it, pulling a small towel out of it to dry his sweat damp hair. He was so busy reaching for the back of his head that he didn’t see Tony Stark approaching, and nearly jumped out of his skin when he felt Tony prod him in the ribs.
“Told you I wasn’t perfect,” Cap replied with a smile that made Tony’s heart beat weirdly in his chest. “I’m, um, I should go. You’re not a prisoner – you’re free to go – but… maybe wait until I can get you some clothes and a way to sneak you out without raising suspicion.”
“Good,” Steve smiled. “Now, what would you say to getting high off our asses one last time, for old times sake, and having wild, rooftop sex?”
“All right, Peter,” Tony instructed with a grin. “Throw the paper as hard as you can, buddy. We wanna cover the whole house.”
“Give them some space,” Steve found himself barking, not in the mood to be disobeyed, and watched as everyone took a few steps back, some even sinking into seats to wait.
“I wouldn’t dare to say,” Bruce sighed. “Tony’s a genius, but even he’s limited by the technology of today. He really can’t be that far away at this point.”
“They tortured me,” he continued quietly. “Made my life hell, no matter what I did. I guess… this time, I guess I just got caught up in the fact that people seemed to actually like me, and that was wrong of me.
Rogers Mansion, and the proprietor thereof, Mr. Steven G. Rogers, had a reputation for being… a little out there. With his mansion set miles upstate of New York, Tony’s accountancy firm generally didn’t hear from the estate at all for months and months on end, because God knew Rogers had enough money to literally do whatever he wanted with it, but every once in a while one of them would be summoned. Usually, Pepper or Rhodey came (Tony tended to deal with clients of the young, blond and female variety), but both of them were otherwise occupied with business this time, so the responsibility had fallen to him.
He let out an undignified squawk as Natasha kicked him non-too-gently under the table, and then side-eyed him to the best of her ability. Bucky, across the table, actually looked pretty amused by it all, if a little red in the face.
“Peter, honey, I promise he’ll come,” Steve reassured gently. “And the sooner you go to bed, the sooner tomorrow will arrive!”
When he turned back to Steve and the others, Steve was giving him that stupid, goofy grin that still, even after nearly six years, made him feel warm and fluttery inside. Even in his Frankenstein make-up, he was gorgeous. Stupid, gorgeous Steve.
Peter just ignored him and stepped up to the front of the line, smiling at the lunch lady. “Two mac and cheeses, please.”
“If we find and destroy the stones before Thanos can get to them, we could easily kill the sucker,” Rocket butt in. “Just zap his purple ass out of existence.”
“Okay, so the best way to do this would be through outside donations,” he explained, pointing to an article he’d brought up. “We can speak to some colleges of your choice and set up a series of scholarship programmes for under-privileged kids. There’d be a whole bunch of them – a couple million going towards paying for housing, another couple million for disabled students.
“What, really?” Tony pouted, heart clenching in his chest. “She seemed excited when I took her back to school shopping last week.”
“Well, this isn’t going to be fun,” Peter murmured, right before he felt bones crack and pain shoot through his whole arm.
Steve pulled the towel away from his face and looked up, huffing out a laugh as he, too, spotted Peter. “You’re going as Wall-E for Halloween this year, then, huh?”
“Yeah, sure, so – but the Quantum Realm is super dangerous, and the last thing Janet told me was not to get trapped in a time loop down there,” Lang continued. “Turns out I’m not so great at listening, either, because when they wouldn’t answer me on the comms link I… kinda panicked and got trapped in a time loop.”
Well and truly confused, he looked around. He was propped up in a bed, that much became clear pretty quickly; his arms and chest, when he peered down, looked a little pink in places, but he didn’t appear to be hurt. There certainly wasn’t an explanation for the burning, agonising pain he blearily remembered from before.
“We’re going to fix this,” he murmured softly, and then kissed him again. “We’re going to get them back.”
“Let’s… let’s just finish the tour first, huh?” Steve hummed, beginning to sway them both back and forth gently. “We’re at the top of our game right now; the whole world loves us. Let’s wait just a little while before we drop a bomb on them like this.”
“See you tomorrow, Tony,” Natasha smiled, and then winked at him as she and Bucky turned to leave. Tony tried not to shudder.
Steve seemed surprisingly game with that idea, if his smile was anything to go on. “Okay, sounds like a good idea. I’ll go first?”
“Uh…” Steve replied intelligently, staring at where their hands were linked as Tony tugged him forwards. “Not very often, I guess.”
But clearly Uncle Thor was in more of a chocolate mood, because his hand shot out with a speed that really shouldn’t have been possible for a man his size and grabbed Peter’s arm –
The guy was actually pretty good looking, in a half-hipster, half-hobo kinda way. His hair was long and dark, pulled back and up into a bun on the top of his head. His eyes were piercing, his stubble patchy and seemingly unkempt. Muscles bulged from his Henley shirt, and Tony realised with a pang that the guy had a prosthetic arm.
“What is it, baby?” Steve asked worriedly, accepting Peter awkwardly into his arms. “Careful of your costume –“
“And here I was thinking you were here to help me find my soulmate,” Natasha replied, rolling her eyes. “You’re just too picky with other people’s fairies.”
Before he could finish his sentence, a thunderous bang echoed from somewhere nearby, almost knocking both of them over as the earth shuddered below their feet. Steve stared at Rhodes for a second, struck dumb by the suddenness, before they both swivelled on their feet and set off towards the source of the noise.
“Daddy did all the work,” Tony mumbled under his breath as he passed Steve to grab a bag of candy. Steve caught his wrist before he could get too far away, however, and reeled him in for a kiss.
“We, uh…” Steve cleared his throat, and it felt like he was splitting the silence with a knife. “We don’t have any music now the band has gone. Would you – could you sing so I -”
, did it as easy as breathing, and there was no point getting worked up about it – it was just how Tony was.
Tony had to admit, that really did sting. They ribbed each other, sure, but Natasha was his best (and only) friend, and he knew it was the same for her. He had slacked off a little, he knew that, but… he kinda liked having Natasha all to himself. He wasn’t in love with her – nothing of the kind – but… he liked her company. Soulmates were a big deal, and he… he wasn’t sure he was ready to give up the little family the two of them had made for themselves quite yet. God knew he hadn’t had anything of the sort amongst his own kind.
See, that was another thing. He and Steve had kinda been married for the past six years, had been dating for four before that. They both sort of had a reputation to uphold, though, so they been keeping it a secret. The rest of the band knew, of course, and their management teams knew, and they all agreed – there was absolutely nothing rock and roll about a married man, never mind a man married to another man. They understood it – of course they did – because half of the appeal of the band was that young women could fantasize about sleeping with them. Was it particularly fair or just? No. It made sure they could pay the bills, though.
“I was going to stay for another hour,” she sighed, but was already moving back to pack away her work. “Honestly, living with you is like living with a child.”
“Pepper, honey, you need to calm down,” he insisted, and was met with silence on the other side of the phone. “Are you listening to me?”
“Too long for me to go without seeing you,” Steve replied, and then gestured to the violin in his hand. “Me and my band were just practising.”
Tony made a soft whining noise at the back of his throat and tugged Steve a little closer. Without opening his eyes, he grumbled, “Jus’ five more minutes.”
Nearly all of his friends – the people who kept him sane in this time period when all he wanted to do sometimes was scream – were gone, and yet all Steve could think about was a man that wouldn’t even speak to him after the Accords. Steve stuck by what he had done, by his beliefs, but he couldn’t help but feel guilty over the execution. If only Tony had
Grabbing his coat, he slipped out through the delivery entrance at the back and headed up through the alley beside his restaurant to the main street they were both situated on. Glancing both ways to make sure he wasn’t about to get run over (because Pepper would never let him hear the end of it), he crossed the street and braced himself outside the door of Rogers’ place. Taking a deep breath, he pushed the door open and stepped inside.
“There’s Bruce and Betty, too,” Rogers went on, almost as an afterthought, “though they tend to keep to the labs. They’re scientists.”
“Is it the footage of him rambling about Star Trek? He used to send them to the group chat – but I suppose you were AWOL at the time, so you –“
“Well, fuck you too,” Steve snapped in reply, pulling Tony towards him as anger burned under his skin. “Fuck you for always thinking you’re right, for never listening, for being too damn proud to call me before you
“Did you know it’s cool to hate us now?” Tony snapped, and then sighed. “It’s a craze, apparently. Only
(which Tony was very proud to say he had written), had gone straight in at number one, and had stayed there for fifteen consecutive weeks, tying with Wet Wet Wet’s
He vaguely thought he might have heard himself scream, but there was a rushing in his ears that was making it kind of hard to be sure. His arm hung limply at his side, and when he tried to move it – tried to defend himself – nothing happened. He managed to duck under yet another flying fist from his Pops, but that just put him closer to the open front door, where –
“Okay, this guy,” Tony mumbled around a mouthful of meat, bread and cheese. He nodded towards a guy walking in the opposite direction to them who appeared to be talking to himself. “Talking to a fairy, or just crazy?”
Suddenly, a series of loud bangs and crashes came from outside, cutting Steve off. Pausing for a second, shocked, Steve made himself move from his seat – the others hot on his tail – and ran for the door. Outside, the street was in complete chaos. HYDRA were there, circling on their bikes, laughing as they took it in turns to drive past and take bats to Steve’s and the other’s parked bikes.
“He sneaks off in the middle of the night,” Steve sighed, running a hand through his greying hair. They were all pushing fifty by this point; hell, he’d met up with Natasha to plan Tony’s fiftieth birthday party. “He comes to bed, waits until he thinks I’m asleep, and then he disappears for a few hours.”
Things had turned ugly fast. They seemed to be targeting him specifically – or Spider-Man, perhaps, but they knew it was him – and no matter what he tried, he hadn’t been able to reason with them. His only option had been to distract them and run, abandoning the mission for the moment in order to regroup his thoughts and come up with a plan. His Pops always told him there had to be a plan in place.
“That’s, mmm,” Steve momentarily got distracted by Tony’s lips again. “That’s the cheesiest line I’ve ever heard.”
Steve offered a few more of his own goodnights, made sure the kids had made it to their rooms, and then slipped in his room behind Tony.
“And…” he continued, “turns out that I’m not great at it and I don’t totally know how it works, because I ended up in 1985, and then the future, and then I’m pretty sure I saw a dinosaur, and then –“
“Guys,” Steve warned, and they fell quiet again. “That sounds good, Sam. Get their number, book us a unit or two depending on how big they are.
With a sigh, Steve leaned over his guitar, towards the microphone propped up in front of him, and grumbled, “Sure, Tony.”
There was a couple on his left. Tony hadn’t officially met either of them, because they seemed to hold even weirder hours than he did, but he knew their names were James and Tasha simply because he could hear them calling each other’s name when they were having sex. The sex thing didn’t particularly bother him – it was better than the couple who used to yell at each other twenty-four seven in his old building.
It was only with that revelation that he also realised that he wasn’t in a hospital bed, or even at Tony’s garage, but tucked up safely in his own bed at home.
Tony was pretty proud of his place. He hadn’t purchased it in the best of circumstances, but it felt good. His last place had technically belonged to his father, as it had been bought with family money, and when they’d argued Tony had been kicked out. It had been inconvenient, as Tony had a job at a local garage that he had to get to every day, but Rhodey had kindly put him up at his Mom’s house until Tony had saved enough to rent his own place.
“Now we know he’s alive, he’s the best chance we have of reversing this thing,” Steve argued stubbornly. “He’s our best shot. We have to find him.”
“You don’t kill people,” Cap murmured firmly a moment later, as Tony was trying to haul himself to his feet, and that sentence was so unexpected that he slipped a little bit and wobbled in shock.
That was where Steve had come in. It had honestly been kind of a drunken mistake, but one that he had been secretly glad of ever since. Bucky had come in late one night, drunk off his ass from drinks at the bar with some work friends, and in a terrible mood. All the guys had either taken girlfriends or one night stands home with them, and Bucky had been left without. He wasn’t even sure why he was in such a bad mood about that, just that he was sick of the same old routine. He was sick of one night stands, sick of relationships that didn’t last, so… in his drunken state, he had wished for a soulmate, something constant, and Steve had appeared.
Rhodey sighed and placed his spoon down in his bowl. “It’s a nice place, okay? Good, family atmosphere, hearty food, and great booze. Believe it or not, after spending a full day with our shitty customers, sometimes it’s nice to actually leave this place.
While Tony hummed his way through the few bars leading into the dance sequence, they both got into position. Steve allowed Tony to take the lead, because there was really no point in them doing this otherwise. It had nothing to do with the fact that he was still struggling to process the moment they had just shared, and needed Tony to take charge.
“You get some rest, Petey,” his Dad nodded, probably reading the exhaustion on his face. “Get yourself better.”
The gang knew that Steve was seeing someone, but they didn’t know it was another man, and they certainly didn’t know it was Tony. He tried to keep his work and private life as separate as he could to protect each party.
“I…” Peter hiccupped again, but thankfully seemed to be calming down a little bit. “I don’t want you and Daddy to get married, Papa.”
Peter was quickly working himself up into quite the crying fit, already hiccupping and with snot dripping from his nose as he ran to Pepper and wrapped himself like an octopus around her waist. She managed to catch the grimace that wanted to form as snot got on her beautiful bridesmaid’s dress, and instead glanced up at Steve uncertainly.
“You’ve got to be more careful with it, bud,” Steve sighed, grabbing a plate from the pile his Ma had placed on the table. Picking up a spoon, he started dumping eggs onto his plate. “What if I’d trodden on it?”
When he glanced at Buck, the man smirked, and he suddenly had the craziest idea that this had to have something to do with Steve. Rolling his eyes, he paced the room and threw his door open; across the hall, Steve’s door was also open, and Tony could just about make out what appeared to be a classical three-piece string band inside.
“And you don’t know where he’s going?” Natasha asked, brow furrowed in concern. “He’s never cheated on you before – why start now?”
Taking a deep breath, he asked, “Wanna play a game with me?” and watched as Steve sat up a little straighter, intrigued. “We each have to say five things we like about each other, and one thing we need to improve on. Might break the ice?”
Instead, he stepped into the faux townhouse and locked the door behind him. An ominously loud click followed, proving there was some kind of deadbolt attached to the door, and he finally took a deep breath, knowing – for now, at least – that he was safe.
Steve thought about it for a moment. His Ma would probably worry if he was home late, always was worried about him for whatever reason, but… getting to spend a few moments alone with Tony? To dance with him? Steve found himself inexplicably drawn to that idea, and found himself nodding his head before he’d really thought it through properly.
“Great,” Tony grinned, because he could work with that. “Okay, we’re gonna have to go DIY on this one, kid; is that okay? We’ve got some boxes at home that could work really well, but we’re gonna have to pick up some paints and glue. Sound good?”
“I see,” Rogers nodded his head amicably. “Well, let’s see. There’s Mr. and Mrs. Barnes, though they only live here while they’re not adventuring around the world. Then there’s Sam – he’s my music man. If you happen to see him around, you should ask him about the Trouble Man soundtrack.”
and ripped the rug right from under him. No more. This had to end, even if it meant burning everything to the ground and starting again. He would eradicate this disease if it killed him -
“Um…” Steve hummed. “You’re friendly… outgoing. Erm… you obviously care about Natasha. You seem intelligent, and… you have nice eyes.”
Sat at the other side of the table, Sam hummed his agreement as he crammed half a burger into his mouth.
“You promised you wouldn’t do that anymore,” Natasha hissed, side-eyeing him. “It makes me look bad.”
tobacco in it – and Steve felt oddly grateful for it. Sure, Tony shouldn’t have really been doing it, but he hadn’t been having an affair like Steve had thought, and he was just so happy that he found he really couldn’t even be mad.
than me – why do they like you when they’ve only ever made fun of me for working hard? Why are you so popular when they think I’m such a
“There’s blood on your neck,” Rhodey hummed, as though it were the most normal thing in the world. “And… all over your face.”
“I – you had to heal… Doctor Banner said -” Cap seemed to realise halfway through stuttering that Tony was playing with him. “You’re making fun of me.”
until he felt just a little lighter, and opened his eyes again. Bucky was staring at him like he’d seen a ghost, which Tony realised had to be pretty accurate, seeing as, to Bucky, he had just appeared from nowhere.
“Tony?” he murmured, leaning forwards to kiss his pouty, sleep-warmed lips. “Come on, honey, it’s time to get up.”
“Papa!” came Peter’s agonised cry from nowhere, and Tony had spun on the spot before he’d even really thought about it. “Daddy!”
“Nah, we’re good,” Tony waved her apology away as she let him into the apartment first. “You were right; I wasn’t pulling my weight. It’s all in the past now, though, baby. We’re not the same people we were back then -”
“All right, all right,” Tony chuckled, reaching over to grab Peter’s sippy cup of OJ before that ended up all over the table, too. “Can I just have a bite? One bite for your starving old man?”
, we’re still here,” Lily whined, and Steve couldn’t help but snort out a laugh at her horrified face.
Peter didn’t really know what was going on. One minute he had been helping the Avengers take down some kind of Voodoo Witch who had been tearing things up in Midtown, and the next his family had turned on him.
“So when I offered to set you up with a bunch of girls…?” Natasha yelled from her bike as they sped through the streets towards HYDRA’s clubhouse.
“You’re a bully,” Tony grumbled, awkwardly shifting in his seat so he could hold the guitar properly. “Hmm, okay -”
In true Stark fashion, Tony was halfway out of his bed, eyes wild and hands quivering as he looked all around him. As soon as he clocked Rhodes at the door, he sagged back onto his bed and a terrified sob left his mouth.
“What, I – who said anything about dating?” Tony scoffed, heart hammering a little in his chest. “You guys are crazy. Steve’s obviously just got no qualms about his body – and he’s got every right to be proud, because sometimes the light catches him just right and it looks like he’s made out of marble, and –“
Only, after a couple of years… he kind of hadn’t gotten used to it. He actually found himself in a bit of a funk, if he was being honest. Having joined the army right out of high school, he wasn’t the most educated guy, and he certainly couldn’t afford college on the Sergeant’s salary he had stocked up over his years in service. He could barely afford the insurance he was paying for his prosthetic arm, for God’s sake. That left him training as he went along on the building site he had managed to get a job on, and though he enjoyed being around other people on a regular basis again, it wasn’t very fulfilling work.
In fact, with them both making a conscious effort not to rile the other up, Steve found that they actually had far more in common than he had initially thought.
Tony didn’t really know how to respond to that. He wasn’t even really sure if he agreed with the guy. Cap didn’t know what Tony had done in his past – the kind of person he had been when he was younger. He was trying to atone, sure, but it was going to take a hell of a long time before he even considered himself
“Look, okay, I know he’s a weirdo,” Buck waved a hand to shut Tony up. “He gets panicky and makes bad life choices when he likes someone – it’s a thing, we’re working on it – but, honestly, that’s just the kind of dork he is, and it can come off a little creepy, but he’s a good guy and he deserves someone who’ll treat him with the love and respect he deserves.
And it was just as he was thinking this, sat alone in his apartment one evening, that someone started knocking urgently on his door.
Tony just shuddered in response. He thought for a moment about asking whether the lion had actually been legally imported, but decided he didn’t want to know the answer.
“Uh-huh,” Natasha hummed, obviously completely unimpressed. “Keep telling yourself that. Now, either make yourself normal, human size, or buzz off. I have to work.”
On his way into the kitchen, Steve almost stepped on what he soon realised was one of Clint’s hearing aids. Rolling his eyes, he stooped to pick it up and carried it with him through the kitchen door.
. Glancing over at Natasha, she sent him a look that told him she was thinking the exact same thing.
“Stop, baby; you’re going to make yourself sick,” his Pops murmured, his words rumbling against Peter’s back. “We’re so proud of you. You got yourself away long enough to recuperate.”
He hit a button on his suit before Steve could even turn to get one last look at the pit where Tony had fallen; the last thing he saw as they were jettisoned somewhere into time was Thanos’s ugly face sneering back at them.
And just like that, the message cut out. Steve stared at the helmet for a moment longer, not really sure what to do with himself, and then he finally took a deep breath.
HYDRA’s clubhouse was very similar to their own; they were based in what looked like an old restaurant, but now just looked run down and boarded up. Many of the buildings around them seemed to have suffered a similar fate, though those looked truly abandoned.
“What’s all that noise?” Tony asked as they got closer to the stage, and, when they were situated in the wings, Steve finally pulled the blindfold down.
“He didn’t say we were having guests,” Clint frowned, but then shrugged his shoulders. “Oh well! Come on in.”
Natasha ended up getting her usual pastrami on rye, and she bought Tony a meatball and mozzarella sub while he stole pieces of bell pepper as the prep guys ignored his very existence. They ate as they walked, deciding to forgo the subway because it was a pleasant evening, and life felt good.
“Next,” he moved on swiftly before everyone could start chattering again, “Pietro, Wanda, you said you know a guy that can help fix our windows for a discount price?”
Steve knew he was right. It was the best chance they had of ending this once and for all. They could collect the stones, but without the gauntlet there was no way of harnessing the power for long enough to turn it inwards on the stones themselves. The gauntlet could do that.
“Good to know,” Tony hummed, leaning up on his tip-toes to peck Steve’s lips. He grimaced. “Ew, you taste like sweat, shame, and a potentially under-age girl’s lip gloss.”
It was a plan. They had been without one for so long that Steve felt lightheaded with the possibility. It would be dangerous, and damn near impossible, but it was a plan. Steve knew his team, and now they had even more members than they had before. They could do this.
By the time they were out of supplies, they were all out of breath with laughter, and the expensive town house looked a complete wreck. Taking a step back next to Steve while Peter continued to run around, searching for bits of paper they hadn’t thrown, Tony couldn’t help but grin.
He was basically dressed in a TV box. Tony had cut off the flaps so Peter could wriggle his little body through it, and had then attached two strips of material to either side of the top to hold the box in place over Peter’s shoulders. Together, they’d cut two holes in the sides for Peter’s arms, and had then repurposed some toilet paper tubes to make arms and claws. It had taken a few moments to think, but Tony had then gone back to the cut off box flaps and had reshaped them into caterpillar tracks to stick onto the sides of the main box.
“Jesus,” he squeaked, startled, and then frowned when he spotted Tony grinning at him. “That wasn’t very nice, was it?”
Tony also loved to cook. In the first few days after his return, he was rarely found anywhere other than in the kitchen, cooking or baking the most delicious smelling meals. Again, Steve could see trauma peering through, almost an obsession, as Tony gorged himself on huge, hearty meals. He knew what it was like to go hungry, could see his childhood self in Tony as he stuffed pasta and bread and all sorts of things into his mouth, but he could also see it becoming a problem if it wasn’t monitored.
“It’s a yes, by the way,” he panted, still out of breath, and grinned harder when Steve jerked beside him in shock.
They were kissing again, but this time it was more desperate, passionate, and Steve wrapped his arms tightly around Tony as it went on, terrified that if he let go everything would go away. He cupped the back of Tony’s head, crushing their mouths together, and thrilled at the sound Tony made.
“Rhodey has been eating over there?” Tony all but yelled, angry and betrayed for what he knew were childish reasons. “That’s it. I’m sending out a staff memo tomorrow morning banning anyone from fraternising with the enemy -”
A guy called Bruce lived directly on his right. He was a little shy, but seemed really cool; he was a science guy, like Tony, only Bruce specialised in gamma radiation and particle physics. Incidentally, he also made the best pot brownies Tony had ever had.
“Good eye,” Tony praised with a grin, glancing behind them to confirm the earpiece. “I swear, the things you pick up, you could be a spy or some shit.”
Steve couldn’t think of a single thing to say. All this time, all these years, Tony had been an asshole to get his
“We go back and destroy the stones before he can get to them,” Carol nodded. “Everyone’s saved, and it’s like none of it ever happened.”
“Night night, Papa,” Lily hummed as they all made their way to bed after their customary evening family movie.
,” Peter sighed, dragging the syllables out as far as he could. Reluctantly, he started to shimmy out of his costume.
kind of way. Allowing himself just a moment to take a few more deep breaths, Peter stood on unsteady legs and dropped the tracker onto the ground, where he promptly crushed it beneath his foot.
“Cap’s here!” someone called, having obviously spotted Steve coming in, and everyone started automatically moving tables and chairs, pushing them together so they could all sit for their daily team meeting.
“That’s the spirit!” Tony grinned, bounding out of the elevator after her when it stopped outside her office.
. He opened his mouth to yell at her, maybe, or at least strongly disagree, but what actually came out of his mouth was:
Steve ached all over, so he couldn’t possibly imagine how much Pietro hurt. Adrenaline was still thrumming through his veins, which was helping, but by the time he stepped back outside with Bucky to ride over to Tony’s garage it was quickly starting to wane, leaving him jittery and exhausted.
The effect was immediate. He could feel the gauntlet working, eradicating every inch of Thanos from the universe. His very existence was disappearing, as though he had never been born at all, and Steve found himself laughing with joy as he realised that this was it – this was the end. He had done it; they had done it.
There weren’t a lot of boxes left in the hall when they made it back out there. Tony actually didn’t own a lot of stuff; at least 50% of the boxes were filled up with scraps of metal and a couple of tool boxes, because he liked to tinker in his spare time. Other than that, he had his laptop, TV, a box of pots, pans and cutlery for the kitchen, and some clothes, and that was pretty much it.
“We didn’t know what else to do,” Clint murmured out loud, and Steve opened his eyes again. “We tried calling Bruce, but we all kinda just panicked, so we took you to Ma at the surgery and she patched you up.”
“No thanks,” Peter shook his head, swallowing past a lump that was starting to form in his throat. “You go have fun, but I think I’m gonna stay at my regular table.”
“Can’t you just sew him up so he can make more?” Bucky asked, padding over to grab a bottle of whiskey from the bar. He took a swig right out of the bottle.
“He came to us from a circus,” Rogers murmured, and then smiled when Tony stared at him blankly. “Clint. He ran away from a circus when he was a teenager, ended up wandering through my grounds.”
“I try my best,” Tony grinned, gently nudging his nose against Steve’s. Then, clearing his throat yet again, he continued, “So, um, maybe the wrong order, but… do you wanna maybe get some dinner with me after this?”
Before he could leave the room, Steve reached out on a whim and grabbed his arm. Rhodey looked momentarily startled, but then his face set into something more solid.
“I’ll talk to them in a little while,” Peter murmured, suddenly overcome with tiredness. “For now, can we just -?”
–“ Tony started snippily, and then took a deep breath and sighed. “I just… what else am I supposed to do? Climb out of the fire escape every morning?”
“All right, all right,” he called, and then had to wait at least another minute for the cheering to calm down. He turned to the band. “We’ve not sold
. That included, as Tony had found out this year, his choice in costume. Usually Steve took Peter out for his costume and the decorations, but this year he’d been called away with Natasha on a covert mission for a few days, leaving Tony to get the squirt and the tower ready for their annual Halloween party.
Peter ignored his voice, and then scrunched his eyes shut when he heard the door click open and closed again, and felt a dip in his bed as his Dad sat down.
“Nah,” Tony shook his head, a little spring in his step as he followed the other kids towards the entrance. “Wait, who beats
“Uh-huh,” came Peter’s muffled reply, before his head popped back up and he got precariously back to his feet, grinning happily. “Daddy helped me.”
“Oh,” Cap looked a little guilty. “It wouldn’t let us in when we tried to get you out, so I… I had to tear it apart. We hid the parts under your bed.”
“Hey guys,” he panted, clutching his broken arm protectively. “You gonna join us for milkshakes? Uncle Thor isn’t feeling banana today, but I’m sure we can find something else –“
“Come on,” Tony hummed, gently curling his fingers around the nape of Steve’s neck to soothe him. “Come on, Clint’s gonna be fine. I’m… I’m sorry I yelled at you.”
“Whatever’s on tap is fine, thank you,” Tony replied quickly, and Sam nodded, moving as if to disappear to get that for him. “And, actually, can you just bring me your special of the day, thanks.”
Steve baulked, taken aback by his own words, and felt a blush rising on his cheeks. “I didn’t – that’s not what I said -”
“You know he probably only likes you because of that, right?” Peter replied, probably both a little too quickly and bitterly.
“No, Daddy,” Peter shook his head vehemently, and Tony despaired. “Don’t wanna be Iron Man. I wanna be a proper robot.”
wait until the Avengers are there to take care of civilians before the real fights begin,” he finished. “You could have let me die back there, when Stane set the rocket launcher off, but your first instinct was to protect me. There wasn’t time for you to think about it – you just did it. You… you nearly melted in that tin can of yours – Doctor Banner and Cho had to use the Cradle to produce new tissue for you -”
Out in the corridor, Stane yelled, visibly startled, and swung around to face him. With only a split second to spare, Tony realised he was wielding a
Turning, he came face to face with Thanos. He looked smug, as though he knew exactly what they had just sacrificed, and took a hulking step towards them.
Bruce paused for a moment, obviously overwhelmed by the responsibility, before, taking a deep breath, he started tugging supplies out of the expansive first aid kit they usually kept under the bar.
“Bye, Papa!” Peter called, a grin breaking out over his face as Pepper closed the door behind them both.
“Shit,” he hissed, batting the tears away from his eyes as though he were ashamed of them. “Shit, Peter, my Petey, my baby –“
They only had to circle the stretch of street outside the clubhouse for a few moments before HYDRA members came pouring out. They looked startled for a moment, as though they hadn’t expected Steve to come after them, but then they started yelling and laughing, passing guns and things to throw out of the door.
Now, the night before Christmas, everything looked perfect. The lights on the tree sparkled, light bouncing off the shiny tinsel they’d hung all around the room, and there were already a few presents scattered around from the other Avengers, family, and friends. Steve and Tony had a full sack of presents for each other and Peter to add once the little boy had gone to bed, but they were safely tucked away in the back of their wardrobe for now, and Steve doubted Peter would last much longer before he fell asleep.
“Right,” Tony sighed, setting his pen down. “You see, the problem is that you can’t actually buy a university.”
For a moment, Tony seriously considered seeking out the source of the voice, if for no other reason than to make sure this wasn’t all some huge fever dream, but ultimately decided against it. He could hear noises coming from the archway at the end of the corridor, and so, hoping he was heading in the right direction, he set off again.
“You have to wear it,” Carol insisted, and Steve looked at her incredulously. “Don’t give me that look. You’re the one that has to end this.”
A wall of noise hit him all over again, and he laughed out loud at the absurdity of it all. Still, after all this time, he couldn’t quite believe that this many people were here to see him and the band Steve had put together in his two room apartment nearly ten years ago.
“Hey, you want some coffee?” Steve called from in his apartment, and Tony realised he was still frozen to the spot by his front door.
They had been keeping the Time Stone in a magical bag that Strange had given them so they didn’t have to touch them with their bare hands. Carol held open the bag and let Heimdall drop the stone inside. They glowed together for a moment before going dark, but Steve didn’t question it. He knew how much power was in that little pouch already.
But, despite that, Tony had learned his lesson from his previous relationships; once he figured out that he had a crush on Steve, he did his very best to avoid him. Rhodey told him that wasn’t a particularly mature thing to do, but it seemed to be working so far, so Tony wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
His Dad had been a teenager for almost two weeks at this point. The first few days had been okay – fun, even – but things had slowly gotten worse and worse for Peter since then. His Dad had somehow managed to win over all of the popular kids, including the bullies, and Peter just didn’t understand. He was just as much of a nerd as Peter; he was currently wearing a
That didn’t mean that Steve wasn’t going to smack him upside the head for continuously misplacing his hearing aids.
“I don’t understand the question,” Rhodey replied, wincing in sympathy as Pepper applied some antibacterial cream to Tony’s face. “Is this some weird guilt trip? Because you’re not allowed to do that – not after
“Some of us need time to recuperate from traumatic experiences, Steve,” Tony grumbled, his breath hot against Steve’s back. “Shut up and at least pretend to be asleep before your Ma comes in here and reams you out.”
“I’ll rest when we’ve fixed this thing,” he ground out instead, and purposefully avoided Natasha’s disappointed gaze.
“I’ve seen it all before,” Tony waved her concern away, and then gestured to his suit. “How do I look? Tie? No tie?”
“That is cheating,” Tony agreed, bending down to her level. “Tell you what, cutie pie – you go over there and tell Jimmy to knock it off, unless he wants me to go get Iron Man –“
Steve smiled intimately at him as he got up to start clearing up, grabbing Tony’s plate in the process.
“Not if you don’t want it to,” he told him cautiously. “Me and Daddy are going to have two last names – Stark-Rogers – but you can stay just Rogers if that’d make you happier.”
Against everyone’s wishes, Tony was up and about within a few days. He immediately caught himself up on what the plan was, and as a result locked himself in his lab with Bruce and Carol to start researching what they could do to reverse the snap.
Pepper had been his last attempt at a proper relationship. They’d been together for three years – the longest relationship Tony had ever managed – before they had finally decided that it wasn’t going to work for them full time, and that they were better off taking a step backwards and remaining friends instead.
since we got laid,” Tony whined, holding securely onto Natasha’s hair as he perched lightly on her shoulder. “The whole point of me being your fairy godmother or whatever is that I help you get laid.”
“We need a distraction,” Steve decided, throwing an arm out to stop anyone stepping out into plain sight where HYDRA goons could be watching. “Natasha, you’re good at sneaking into places, right?”
“Well, is it?” she asked again, unashamed. “We used to be able to hear you two going at it like rabbits on the tour bus. Is the spark still there?”
Tony quickly cleared his throat and made himself turn back to his laptop, ignoring how his cheeks felt a little warmer than they had before. Old buildings like this had insulation packed into the walls - that was the explanation.
“I see,” Steve grinned, and Tony found himself charmed by the sight. “So, let me ask you a question. Are you just here for dinner, or do you have an ulterior motive?”
Had he mentioned the guy was gorgeous? Because he was Adonis levels of hot. Golden blond hair ruffled and obviously just slept on, warm, bright blue eyes that seemed kind, a jawline that could cut glass and sculpted abs that must have taken years of work, Tony was actually pretty sure he had never seen a more beautiful person in all his life.
“Okay,” Tony nodded, because he could do that. He could probably do that. “Okay, we’ll wait a couple of weeks. So you don’t think I should go over there and talk to their owner?”
Tony rolled his eyes, but took the flowers all the same. “You kiss a guy one time and suddenly you’re stuck with him for all eternity.”
But despite the confusion over Iron Man’s motives, he had a pretty good life. He was a rich, eligible bachelor who could have his pick of anyone he wanted, he owned a multi-billion dollar company that was at the forefront of clean energy, and he got to secretly atone for all the trouble he had caused, no matter what the news and the government and the whole damn world thought of Iron Man.
Steve knew a Tony apology when he heard one, and stepped forwards. Just as he thought he would, Tony opened his arms and let Steve fold himself into them, hugging him tightly. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s middle and hugged back, shutting his eyes tightly for a moment to compose himself.
They were both still pretty mad, if the luke-warm shoulders they were giving him was anything to go by.
“I don’t even think he’s showered to wake himself up a little,” Steve replied, leaning over the back of his chair to tug Tony away from her, before pushing him gently towards the coffee pot on the counter.
“Right,” Pepper also nodded. “Then, when today is over, you, your Daddy and your Papa get to go on a vacation for two whole weeks.”
There was another explosion from somewhere nearby that rocked the whole building, and Tony staggered. Stane was close.
was crazy. “Because getting to spend more time with you is the only reason I agreed to do this stupid musical? Because I’ve been building up the nerve to ask you out for weeks, and you kissing me back just now kinda made me think maybe you liked me too, even just a little?”
“Uh huh,” Peter nodded, and shifted so he could clutch Steve’s hand with the one that wasn’t holding Tony’s.
he was classed as an enemy of the state because he blew up the occasional thing or two, but he wasn’t a
“You really think,” Rhodes started, and for the first time Steve heard a little slur of alcohol in his voice. “You think we can reverse this?”
“I didn’t want you to get hurt,” Steve sighed, leaning forwards to rest their foreheads together. “Looks like I didn’t do too good a job of that, huh?”
Steve had kind of been hoping that he’d be able to wear Tony out enough with sex that he wouldn’t have the energy to sneak off, but it was only an hour and a half after they’d finished, and Steve had fallen into a light doze, that Tony quietly rolled out of bed and shuffled off.
“Hey, neighbour!” Steve called over his shoulder as he pushed his door open. “Water’s not working in my apartment, had to use Buck’s shower.”
“Sounds like a plan,” Pietro nodded, and was zipping off back down the alley to grab his bike before anyone else could reply.
“HYDRA paid us a visit,” Steve replied, following Tony into the garage as the others wheeled what was left of their bikes inside. “They… Tony, they have Clint.”
In the meantime, Steve and the others were thinking tactically. They didn’t know how to destroy the Infinity Stones, but if they could collect them all and somehow use them to defeat Thanos first, then they’d have time to figure out how to destroy them afterwards. Steve planned their route, starting on Earth and then branching out further and further into space. The concept was terrifying, and he didn’t know how Tony had done it and kept his mind, but what kept him going was the thought that they were going to get everyone who had disappeared back. They were going to save them all.
He struck a shaky chord, and then another. With a reassuring smile from Steve, he seemed to get his confidence in order, because he strummed with more flair. And then he began to hum. There were no words, because Tony really hadn’t ever been a
Tony had promised to keep quiet in exchange for Steve promising never again. So far, he had managed to keep that promise. He hadn’t been back to the hospital.
Steve felt like he was going to be sick. For a moment time seemed to still, his breath caught in his throat, and all he could see was Clint’s confused, terrified face as he was taken away from him. He couldn’t move, couldn’t breath, couldn’t think – all he was was the single tear running down Clint’s face.
“You know full well your father hasn’t checked his Twitter account in years,” Steve smiled. “The secret is safe. Good job, baby; God, he’s going to be so surprised.”
“We don’t have the technology to track the message directly,” Bruce shook his head, “but he has to be close. The suit only has a limited reach, so if it’s picking up the message it means Tony’s got to be nearly home.”
“Oh, I… sure. Table, yeah, uh – yeah, table,” Tony replied smoothly, smacking a palm against his forehead as soon at the guy turned away to lead him to a table.
“You see that girl in the front row?” Clint asked as they made their way past parts of their extensive team towards their dressing rooms. “The one who kept flashing her tits at me?”
A man stood looming over both Tony and the lion from the stairs, white suit immaculate on his well-sculpted body. His hair was the colour of the sun on a cold winter’s day, his eyes the colour of the clearest sky. Miraculously, at the sound of the man’s voice, the lion had stopped in its tracks, dropping down onto its belly in submission. Tony felt himself instantly relaxing in the man’s presence.
Steve grinned goofily. “It was a pretty good kiss. Not so great circumstances, but ten out of ten for the actual kiss.”
It took a few weeks, but finally they were all prepared. Honestly, Steve took an extra couple of days to go over everything personally just to buy them a little more time; the closer they got to being ready, the less ready everyone seemed to be. They were still raw from the trauma of everything that had happened, and where there was now hope, there was also terror that their plan might not work.
Bruce was waiting outside when they pulled up, looking terrified. Thor plucked Pietro’s limp body off the back of Steve’s bike as he skidded to a stop and carried him inside quickly, Wanda following a hair width’s distance behind. Taking a deep breath, Steve forced himself to kick out his bike stand and then climb off, and was the last inside as everyone raced to see what was going on.
Tony's eyes lingered on the cigarette for a second longer before he managed to gather himself. "Inside. Natasha agreed to meet with us.", he replied.
Still, it put him on edge when Peter was behaving like this. There was a certain uncertainty between them, something foreboding. A storm was forming and it finally broke loose when Tony and Steve mentioned moving Peter.
Natasha's eyes were focused on Peter, though. "I'm sorry, Peter. This is for the best.", she said calmly and Wade felt Peter stiffen beside him. "You need to hear this, Tony.", Natasha then said, looking over at the Superdads.
The traffic in NY was insane but Tony insisted that Peter wasn't supposed to use public transport. Too many people. Peter didn't complain. He also didn't complain about the wristwatch he couldn't take off which contained a tracker in case Peter got kidnapped a third time. He was just glad that he didn't need a baby sitter all day every day anymore so he put up with Tony's rules.
"... and that's when I figured that the 'blowjob' was poisoned. Worst blowjob ever, am I right? But you should've seen the guys face when I came back and turned him into a popsicle with the help of my friends Arthur and Bea!", Wade had been talking for hours, telling Peter about all his missions and fights. There was no end in sight.
Wade got up and Peter couldn't hold back his flinch. But he still smiled, he wasn't sure if he could've stopped smiling if he tried to. That didn't make it hurt less."Peter, you're clearly not okay. So whatever it is that you need, tell me and I'll take care of it.", Wade said, he was perfect.
"We'll wait for the results, they should be ready in a few minutes, we'll think of something to do after that.", Steve said and he ment it. The fact that this wasn't Peter Stark didn't mean that he didn't deserve care.
Another long stretch of silence. Peter could feel Gwen shake ever so slightly and he wrapped his arms around her on instinct. She sounded choked up when she finally spoke again. "They tried to get me under control... thought it had to be easier without you present. I started to give in." She sounded ashamed and miserable and Peter's heart ached for her. He could also tell that she wasn't telling him the whole truth but he figured she'd tell him once she was ready.
"It really is, though. Apparently it causes cancer. ", Bucky argued, pulling a face before frowning down at the cigarette between his finger. For a moment Peter thought he'd put it out but instead he just took another drag.
you. And believe me when I say that I don't pity you, that I don't think that you're a lost cause or a timebomb. Maybe I'm not in my right mind, no, scratch that, I'm definitely batshit crazy but I know what it's like, okay? Believe me I do. And I am here, Peter. I'm here and I'm not going anywhere."
She looked satisfied when she looked down at him. "You pull a stunt like this again and you won't be the one getting shot.", she added before returning to the pilot's seat, leaving Peter laying on the ground. She sounded like she ment it.
"Yeah, fucked your mom and pissed off when you were 10.", Peter said it like a joke and Bucky smirked.
Steve gladly accepted this job, but who had the audacity to show up at 11 PM? Tony was still working on new repulsors for his suit and would probably stay in his workshop for another few hours. Steve got off the couch and took the elevator downstairs.
After their meeting they'd all separate again and Wade would wander the city, searching for something to take his mind off of the bottomless spiral it threatened to tumble down. It never worked, not really. He'd always find himself empty and desperate in the end.
Also, thank you so much for all your kind comments, I'm blown away by how many people are reading this, it's insane to me, thank you so so much!
Foolish, really. This could get him in serious trouble. Not listening always got him in trouble. That's why he couldn't check out when he was with HYDRA. The risk was too great.
Peter was unraveling in front of him, more and more ever since they met and Wade couldn't help but to feel like he was the completely wrong person to handle any of that. With his own truckload of issues, how was he supposed to help Peter? He should just bring him to his father as quickly as possible and never think of him again.
'- tone. He was probably right.  Peter handed the phone back and dropped the cigarette but on the ground before laying back on the car until his back was resting against the windshield.  This way he was staring straight up at the sky, at the thousands of stars shining above them, so many more visible out here where there was no light pollution.
They decided to get breakfast first but afterwards they returned to their room where Peter sat down in one of the chairs.mWhen Bucky asked Peter how he wanted it Peter thought back to the haircut Wade gave him.
"Where are you really taking me? After the waffles, I mean.", his face didn't change but he sounded confused, irritated. Wade was just happy that he wasn't catatonic.
"'Cause of the crash sight, the blood, you really shouldn't be alive. Plus, your friend spoke to Death and she told him you were dead? Whatever that's about. ", Bucky sighed but Peter didn't seem to be listening anymore. He was staring into space, not a good sign. "Peter?"
Silence filled the space between them, thick and suffocating. Wade was the first one to break it. "And you signed that shit?!"
"I prefer to not look at myself. Describe it to me.", he said before letting his hands wander through it.
"I- sorry, I didn't mean it like that, it's just something I saw in movies-",  he stuttered before coming up with another idea. "How about I pay for the tickets and you pay for the food. It'll be expensive, I promise, I eat a lot.", he suggested.
Bucky knew that Peter wouldn't die. That his wound was already healing, that he'd be back on his feet in a few hours. After all Peter had walked around for miles in a body that was completely shredded. This was nothing. Bucky knew that.  But that didn't mean that this made anything easier. Bucky reached for Wade's hand that was pressing the towel to the wound to stop the bleeding. Wade flinched when Bucky touched his skin but he still let him lift his hand away. The cut was bloody and deep but Bucky could already see the wound closing up.
Wade understood that Peter was having a cathartic experience or whatever but that didn't make it any less worrying. He slowly sat down on the ground across from him and Peter tracked him with his eyes. "You okay, Spidey?", he asked concerned and Peter looked over at him, a wide smile on his face.
He then bit on his lip, hesitating for a moment before patting the space beside him. "Lay with me?", Peter asked, sounding so god damn innocent that it made Wade's heart melt.
Eyyyy! You didn't really think I'd kill Peter for good, did you? Nah, I'm a firm believer in happy endings. I'll talk a bit more about that topic once I post the last chapter. Because there is only one more chapter left! Are you excited?
"That's what you don't understand. None of us were ready but we don't have time to wait until we're ready. If we do, it might be too late."
He didn't know where they were going, and quite honestly, he wasn't interested in staying awake or pulling through. So he kept his eyes closed as he waited to fade away once more.
"Do you think I don't know that?", Tony snapped at which Steve laid a comforting arm around him. It seemed to do the trick because Tony shut his eyes and took a calming breath before adding, much calmer this time:" Peter is the only one that can identify her. According to Natasha her story made sense, though."
He looked to his right and saw who was driving the car. His eyes were recognizable, Peter would recognise Wade's eyes anywhere, but the rest of him wasn't. He was flawless, with smooth skin and soft dark blond hair. This must've been what Wade looked like before his mutation. Handsome, perfect, to Peter he just looked wrong. This wasn't Wade, at least not the Wade that Peter knew.
"Better. For now. He's asleep.", he replied but neither Stark nor the Captain seemed relieved by that so Wade went into an explanation of what went down. He kept it as brief as possible, holding back all the gory details. "I got him lucid, got him to take a bath and sleep in his bed. We talked for a bit, too but he was too tired in the end. Bottom line is, I'm staying here."
"To be honest... so did I.", Peter said. "Before Bucky found me... I was sure that that was it. I was done. And it's not like I wanted to die but I... I looked up at the sky and it was all red and pink and gorgeous, I don't know. I didn't mind it so much in that moment. It wouldn't have been a bad end. I could've lived with that." He smirked at his own choice of words but it didn't take away from the gravity of them. Maybe it just added to it, to the sweet sweet bitterness that laced his voice, that was chiseled into every feature of his face, painted in his eyes. Beautifully ruined.
For the first 10 minutes or so they didn't even talk, Tony only let Peter take in his surroundings. The sun was beating down on them in a way Peter had never experienced before. All he knew was cold, he wanted to bathe in the sunlight, get devoured by it. He'd gladly burn if it ment never freezing again. The sound of the waves blocked out almost all other noise and the salty smell of the ocean was foreign. But the most intense feeling was the sand, he'd never walked on sand before. He wondered if it felt so intense to other people, too, tingly and prickly and hot, or if this were just his heightened senses. The water pooling around his ankles was a real relief for the sensation, cool and soothing.
Besides, Wade made it clear that he was fine with it, a fact that hurt more than Peter would've liked to admit. Wade was '
His eyes were focused on Wade's masked face and for a while that was the only thing he did, stare at Wade silently. It was really intense in a weird way. Then:"Can you take off the mask?"
"Yeah, I thought you'd like it.", Bucky replied with a satisfied smile. He let Peter take in the view for as long as he wanted. He just stood there turning round and round, committing it all to memory. When he was done he turned back to Bucky and a smile tugged at Peter's lips. A real genuine one. It felt foreign and rusted, like he had somehow unlearned how to properly smile. But it wasn't forced, and he didn't force it down either. Peter just let it happen and Bucky cracked a smile as well.
"This is SHIELD. They are against HYDRA, too.",He replied after a moment and Wade was sure that all of them noticed that he didn't tell her that she could trust SHIELD.  Why would he?
Kid didn't flinch, he stared Bucky down. Then he did something Bucky would've never seen coming. "Peter.", he said and his voice was weak and cracked from not being used, but it was much cleared than when he spoke in his sleep. Bucky was absolutely baffled. For a second he thought that he had imagined it and then the boy cleared his throat before saying:"I'm called Peter."
They buried an empty casket. Peter Stark was dead and for a while, Tony was too. Life continued though, the earth kept on spinning and it wouldn't wait on Tony. He was well accustomed to loss, he knew how to pull himself out of sorrow, even if it always stayed with him.
"You remind me of Tony. I mean you look alike but you just sounded like him, too.", Steve smirked but Peter seemed to shy away even more, suddenly looking at the floor.
After the last fluffy chapter it's time for a bit more angst again. Nothing too extreme but there is one part that could be considered gory. It's not vital to the story and I'm going to mark it with this** in case you want to skip it. It's not a lot at all.
"And what if I promised you that they won't force you to do anything? What if I could keep you safe and keep them safe from you."
Peter found that something about his body felt weird, even now that it had healed, but he couldn't point his finger at it. It just felt sort of wrong. It didn't disgust him like before. He didn't really care for it. This wrongness brought an apathy that Peter had only experienced under the influence of drugs. Back then it had been much stronger, more general. His current apathy wasn't all encompassing so Peter decided to worry about that later. He had more import things to worry about.
A short one today but at least you finally got their first meeting! And because I love pain I'll let you feel it, too!
Okay... So first of all, sorry for falling off the face of the earth. I kinda hit a writing block with this story but I never planned on giving up on it. I just needed a little time away to work on some other things. If there is any criminal minds fans here, I started writing 2 criminal minds fanfics in the meantime. But I'm back! And I definitely still have a lot planned for Peter, Wade and the rest!
"So?! That's not good. You wouldn't be yourself anymore. ", Wade snapped and this time his frustration shone through. Peter didn't flinch. He stayed completely calm and Wade hated that.
Peter didn't ask what happened, he didn't have to, the raise of his eyebrow was question enough. "I- I hated it. I thought that Steve could never accept what I had become. I mean I couldn't even accept it myself. Turns out it was more of a me-problem anyways. He mostly felt sorry for me, which isn't all that great either, but he never blamed me. Tony wouldn't blame you either."
"I'm not pretty, I'm hideous.", Wade said with a chuckle but it came out bitter and breathless. Peter didn't laugh, he didn't smile, either.
"You do work the stage quite well," Steve said. "Honestly when I came here tonight, I didn't think there'd be an omega here like you "
“Well, then Steve, you do your best at that, and then in the morning when we get cleaned up, you go take care of your bill while I’ll go find Clint. Sound like a plan?”
“You know, I kind of guessed that big galas like this would have… different music. I mean the piano classical music is nice of course, but i thought maybe there’d be a whole orchestra here.”
Tony grinned and snuggled into the alpha, “What do you want to watch? I have access to practically everything.”
Steve smiled at Tony, then looked at Thor again. “I don’t usually run into jerk alphas. Most take a look at me an decide to not mess with me, especially if I wear one of my old army shirts.”
The agent hesitated, but she took his things with a sigh and left the room, giving the couple their space.
Their scents were mingling together quite nicely as Steve set Tony down on the cot. It looked so small, but it was apparently big enough to hold a nest. Must have been an extra large size. Steve worried it was going to tip over, but the cots were usually built pretty tough, so it might work.
“You keep saying Hydra...isn’t that some mythical beast from Greece or something? Lots of heads that grow back?”
“I believe it. But I promise I’ll do my best to not be an asshole alpha. You deserve someone to treat you right for once.”
“Oh, shit,” Tony groaned as he arched up into his alpha. He wanted to take every inch Steve offered him, wanted to feel how deep he could reach when they weren’t in heat or rut.
Tony cried out, almost as if he had a second orgasm when Steve’s knot caught and then finally locked in place, trapping the mix of slick and cum inside him and making him feel ready to burst from the fullness of it all. He loved that feeling, and he wondered just how full he’d be if Steve was in rut. Would his belly expand from it?
Tony didn’t say anything, only dropping his bags and reaching around Jarvis to hug him tight. If anyone could comfort him in this time of need, it was Jarvis.
Steve growled low at Tony’s pleasure filled voice, unable to say anything back, so he grabbed Tony’s thighs and dug his fingers into them. He was pleased when a small rush of slick was produced. It was enough for him to work with for the moment, so while he continued to give Tony a blowjob, he took one hand and wiped up some of the slick, spreading it on his own cock and stroking it in time with his head bobbing.
“Ah, yes, you’ll want to take Elevator three up to floor forty-five.” There will be someone there to direct you further.” they said, pointing to where the elevators were.
"He helped attack the last hydra base. He was a part of the assault team! He was in the crossfire of an explosion that caused some shrapnel to enter his chest. The arc reactor is keeping him alive by pulling the shrapnel away from his heart."
“Sounds like a plan,” Steve said, ignoring the remaining flashes from cameras that had suddenly gone off during the kiss.
However, in the recent days, Steve had gotten much closer to Tony, and being the supportive guy that he was, Steve of course wanted to be by Tony's side, being his bodyguard and his support to lean on when things got rough.
The trip to the military base felt too long to Tony. He watched trees and cars pass by, but he still felt like the drive was taking far too long already. Time seemed to stand still when Tony was waiting on his alpha.
“Yeah, I’ll be making sure you have a wardrobe ready at my place, and I have one at yours for any staying over needs we have. But for now, we have these, and yes to the snacks. We left before they served dinner so I only have alcohol in me right now.”
“You mean another near-hundred year old used-to-be beta that got frozen in ice and thought dead?” Tony asked, still not quite believing such a story. He’d have to run some numbers to see if freezing a man as the story stated was even possible without killing him. He’d trust the science.
“Tony’s alpha was in rut in December,” Maria said, sighing in what almost sounded like relief as she rubbed her face.
Tony smiled and pressed up into the kiss to return it without pressing for it to go deeper before letting it come to a soft end.
"Tony might not like it, but it's cold out, and anyone deserves a warm meal, even wrongdoing alphas."
He frowned, confused as he glanced at his watch, “You told me ten thirty on the dot...it’s one-oh-seven…”
Tony hummed in contentment, and soon after had fully drifted off, held snugly against the alpha’s chest.
The pain medicine had helped keep Tony’s soreness at bay, but he wasn’t saved from his stomach suddenly getting upset again right before he was ready to leave the house to go shopping. Once again he was forced to stay in bed and try not to throw up just from watching the room spin. He was, to put it simply, baffled that now two days in a row had ended the same; throwing up and laying in bed trying to sleep but failing. Maria had told him to wait on eating solid foods again until he was completely better, which he hadn’t liked, but it was the only way he was going to get better.
Looking around the store, there were several racks of clothes that were either brand new or on sale, most of which were not exactly in styles that Tony liked. He wandered around until something, hopefully anything, would catch his eye. It took going through most of the store before he finally found something on a rack hidden away at the back of the store. It was mostly clearance, but the one thing he did find on the rack was something about as flashy as Tony could imagine himself wearing.
“Well, I’m still horny.” Tony said, pushing Steve so he’d sit up. The omega then shifted into Steve’s lap, facing him and fitting himself between his large torso and Steve’s dick that stood tall and hard along his crack, “And if you are wondering which
Pulling his mask up, Tony smirked as the shield went up around him, allowing his own bullets to shoot through but blocking the ones coming towards him. He let out a whoop of excitement as he charged forward, taking down five Hydra agents with a single sweep of his gun.
“I’m more expensive than other high-end omegas. I’m not some knock-off merchandise. I’m name-brand.”
Here's this chapter a little earlier than normal! My normal posting day is a busy day, so I thought I'd be nice and give you some more angst early lmao. Also this chapter is where the unprofessional medical procedures tag comes into play.
Tony nodded as he sat up in his bed, revealing a bare torso that showed every muscle he had built up as a soldier. “I’ll do my best.”
“Mmhm,” Tony said, grabbing a couple of his nesting blankets to drag over to the couch where they could set up a comfortable area to snack, cuddle, and watch movies. “Will be perfect once we’re cuddling. Want to set up our snacks while I get the nest situation situated?”
"Fuck.", Peter hissed in pain, regaining all of their attention. Bucky knelt down next to him, once again taking over for Peter who just leaned back and let the pain wash over him.
Okay, a quick warning, I did include the Rape/non-con warning in this story and tagged it as extremely dubious consent because technically Wade is consenting but I still consider what Death does to him non-concentual because he doesn't really have a choice.
His jaw ached and felt hot and there was red on the Widow's knuckles. But her eyes weren't on Wade, they were on Tony who stood in front of her.
He straddled her lap and let her eager hands run along his naked torso until she grabbed a hold of his neck and pulled him down into a bruising kiss once again.
Wade hated that. Hated that it sounded like a threat, like a promise. "Doesn't everybody?", he asked, a bitter smile tugging at his lips.
Wade needed a moment to access the situation. The bed Peter slept in only minutes ago was completely ripped up, as if a feral animal went wild with it. It took him a solid minute to figure out that Peter wasn't even awake.
"Look who's calling. Should we say hello?", Gwen announced before pressing a button and the noise stopped and was instead replaced by the voice of Peter's father.
"Are you serious? What? Because I'm a woman I can't pay for myself? That's super outdated.", she stated her tone sharp and Peter immediately felt bad. He could tell that he offended her but not really why and it was stressing him out right away.
He had been 15 when Tony Stark's kid died. It was all over the news, everyone and their mother was freaking out because of it. There was no way in hell that this was the same Peter.
"Thing is, I think I might be... But I don't know. I'm sort of a difficult person to be around. Like, I'm hardly able to lead any kind of normal relationship. I also don't know if he's even into me. " The words just spilled out of him, ever since his date with MJ he couldn't stop thinking about Wade,  about their relationship, about if Peter could even imagine being in a relationship like that. It felt good to let it out after it had been festering inside of him for days.
Sorry for being gone again. You know, work, art, other projects. But I still have a lot planned for this fic and I can't wait to hear your thoughts on the resent... developments.
Part of Wade thought that this was all he'd do now. Be miserable and pathetic as he waited for Peter to forgive him or at least feel like he could bear Wade's presence.
"Okay, sorry. But what I'm saying still stands. Yeah, the withdrawal will suck but afterwards you can finally heal again." Wade could see how some might interpret his words as hollow but Wade believed that Peter could do it, or at least he tried to. His own conviction didn't matter. He only had to make Peter believe it.
The boy quickly scrambled away, his eyes shooting around the room frantically. "Hey... hey, you're okay. It was just a dream. You're not at HYDRA anymore, you're with me. Remember? We ate waffles...", Wade tried to calm him down and amazingly it seemed to work. Peter's eyes focused on Wade and he nodded shakily.
"Stop making that face.", he told MJ after he couldn't bare her staring anymore.  Sometimes he felt like he was made of glass an no matter how hard he tried to keep it together, everyone could see the cracks, everyone could look straight through him and see the shattered mess he was inside. With MJ he felt like she could always see him which was both a relief and a threat. He couldn't hide from her the way he used to be unable to hide from Gwen.
Wade couldn't remember what the dream was about but when he woke up with a racing heart and in cold sweat he figured that it must've been a nightmare. It took him a few seconds to orient himself but then his eyes fell on Peter and he remembered. He was in Peter's room, in Malibu, and he'd stay here, because Peter wanted him to stay. His heart skipped a beat.
"I said eyes on the road, shit-liar. I didn't survive my own suicide attempt just to die in a car crash because you were too busy ogling me to watch the road.", he said in this tone that wasn't quite snappy but definitely frustrated.
Peter didn't want to disappoint Bucky, didn't want to prove that he couldn't even keep it somewhat together for 24 hours. And it's not like he was completely losing it right now. He just needed to be under the open sky. He wouldn't do anything stupid. So he left the room and then he left the hotel until he found himself at the pool area. Out here he could breathe properly. Out here not every second of living
"Great, Love you.", he said and even though he was pissed off Peter still embraced Wade and gave him a quick kiss. Because the last time that they parted after a fight Peter almost died without confessing his feelings and he didn't want that kind of regret again.
"You've got a phone dumbass, use it.", she said with her typical grin but it wasn't as sharp as usual. It looked quite sad, actually.
On a different note, the overwhelming amount of attention this story is getting and your lovely comments really motivated me to get back into this story and I have a few new ideas, the next chapter will come soon and will be longer, I promise!
He was also very cool when it came to letting Peter hang out in his studio. Peter wasn't artistically gifted at all but he did like looking at Steve's paintings. They made him feel, which got harder and harder these days. Steve never seemed bothered when Peter would just sit in his studio and watch him work.
"Ahh yes, I used to read the story to my sisters. It's pretty good, and the movie is supposed to be amazing."
In fact it had been so easy-going that Peter didn't think twice about taking his shirt off. Sure, it should've bothered him more. He usually hated people seeing his body but lately Peter didn't care.
"No. This is not how the fucking story ends, this is no way to end a story! You don't just torture a person for 50 chapters straight and finish it by killing them! What sadist would write something like this?!", he argued, frustrated that they were all just sitting there, not doing anything.
"Of course I do. I know how to fly a jet and you think I don't know how to drive a car?", Peter questioned. He sometimes got the feeling that the others forgot that HYDRA hadn't just tortured them day in and day out. They were trained, too, in lots of different fields.
"Nah, I put them in there.", Bucky replied and glanced over to find that Peter had abandoned all CDs but one.
He was reading, which he'd been doing often, whatever book Bucky left in the room last. Or he was pretending to read. Bucky could tell the difference. It was all too perfect when he pretended. The time between each page turn was always the same. Kid's attention remained on Bucky.
"No but Bucky texted me that they'll be here in a few minutes. ", Steve replied, looking down at his phone screen. In the light of his screen Wade saw that he actually had a case of bed-head. Apparently the two had rolled out of bed for this.
"I coulda stopped him but I didn't wanna.", Wade pointed out, his hands in the pockets of his pants and a satisfied smile on his lips. Tony got it, he was also thrilled everytime Peter wasn't this timid, quiet boy that you couldn't speak to. But right now was just a bad time.
"What?",Wade asked, his voice cracking. He couldn't get the image of Peter staring at him through dead eyes out of his mind. His toneless voice when he said:"Don't bother coming back." mixed in with the voices of his boxes.
"Don't flatter yourself. I watch everyone. Especially the ones that knock on my door as frequently as he does. Of course you'd have to fall for
He stepped into the dark bedroom, all the curtains were drawn and there was a distressing smell. Sweat and... blood. It took his eyes a second to get used to the dark and another one to locate Peter. Hanging from the ceiling in one corner, not moving at all, predictable. His body was completely curled up and in the dark it was hard to make out body parts, he was just a ball of limbs and messy brown hair.
"And what changed?", Bucky heard himself asked and Peter's eyes fell on the book in his hands. He let it fall close before holding it up as an answer.
Once Wade took a seat beside Peter he asked the question he was more interested in:"So why are you up here?"
"Don't you have your own life to get back to?", Peter asked but there was no sharpness to his tone, it didn't sound like it was supposed to be an insult but Wade still wanted to be sure.
So, the last chapter made a few of you a bit upset? Not gonna lie, for now it isn't getting any better.
He gave his therapist a ring. He had stopped seing Dr Carson on a regular basis a year ago because he finally felt like he could manage his life on his own. Well, things felt less manageable now. It took him a whole hour to get her caught up on everything that had happened since they last saw each other. They went on from there, meeting once a week like they used to. It helped. Tony was still fucking miserable but all the distraction kept him afloat.
Bright warm light, no pain, no suffering, you know the drill, Wade was dead. He was on a train station facing Peter but it was the perfect wrong version of Peter that Death liked to put on.
The thing was, Peter didn't have to tell her anything but on the very short list of people Peter cared about there was now a new spot for MJ and she had already seen his powers, already recognized Bucky and already proven herself trustworthy. "An experiment gone wrong.", he replied with sigh before telling her everything, about his powers, about how he got them, about who did this to him, about how he got out. Telling his own story felt strange, he felt disconnected, like he wasn't really talking about himself, maybe he was dissociating, he hadn't felt quite steady ever since his fight with the robber.
"Hey! I'm not killing myself, if that's why you're panicking!", He yelled over to Wade, giving him a small wave. Okay, he seemed normal. False alarm.
The boxes weren't gone, Wade knew that they always returned eventually, but they were quiet for now.
"I'll stay with him for now.", Wade replied, sliding past Bucky into the bedroom. Peter's eyes didn't meet his, he lowered his gaze and turned away without a word. He didn't watch Bucky leave.
"Your standards for friends must be pretty low for you to consider me one." Peter realized how rude that was the moment he said it but to his surprise MJ let out a chuckle, glancing down for a moment.
"Then it isn't irrational.", Wade replied gently before taking a few steps back. "I'll just stay on my side of the room, I promise.", he said and Peter wanted to cry again. Wade was so fucking gentle with him, much kinder than Peter was used to and he didn't deserve any of it.
Natasha slowly started to reboot her brain after a few more seconds. "I- I can't believe it, everyone thought that you were dead- How- Where was he?", that last question was directed at Tony but Peter answered anyways.
"You do?", Peter asked surprised, looking over at Wade. He didn't look as nonchalant as he did before, his shoulders looked tense, his jaw tight. Peter knew that feeling.
It was already pretty late and aside from the cashier, that only gave Wade one strange look before returning her attention to her magazine, they were alone.
Peter's eyes fell to his phone and pack of cigarettes between them."Do you mind if I smoke?", he asked and MJ frowned at him and then at the pack between them, as if she didn't notice it until now.
Wade didn't start the day planning for it to go like this. Well, kinda. He did plan on infiltrating a HYDRA base and killing everyone there to the sound of '
"I- I'm sorry- I-", he stammered, reaching for the door handle and opening the door before falling out of the car, backwards.
Wade was still rattled though. He wouldn't deny that it hurt to see Peter so involved with Gwen. They were inseparable. They didn't let go off each other for a second and for someone that could barely get Peter to stand close to him... that was a lot.
"Hm?" Peter didn't look at Tony, staring at the sea instead, at how the sun was reflected on the waves, making the water look like liquid gold.
"Then do it. But hear me out first, please?", he pleaded and he could see Gwen shake, could see the bottom of her lips tremble. But she didn't shoot him, didn't tell him to shut up, so Peter spoke.
"You see what I mean now?", he asked quietly, eventually glancing over at MJ. Her expression looked worried. Peter didn't even need her to answer the question.
"Natasha called. Gwen wants to see you.", He explained with a smile and Peter's heart stopped. He was pretty sure that it did and he wasn't sure when it started beating again.
, yes, I can't believe you're real.", Peter let out a broken sob before leaning his forehead against hers.
"Look, I don't know you very well. But I do know Tony and trust me Peter, that man's a mess.", he then said which seemed to catch Peter off guard. So much so that he let out a surprised chuckle, which made the invisible hold on Steve's lungs ease up a little. "Like, really. You should've seen him when you took off, he was a wreck. Understandably so of course. And I get that you can't know that. He hides it, he has to, he's the parent. But believe me, he's just as terrified as you are, we all are. It's human nature. We're all so fucking scared, especially of the unknown. And don't beat yourself up, if you feel that you can't help others right now. Sometimes you just gotta mend yourself first before you can do it for someone else.", he explained. Steve wasn't sure where the words came from, just that they felt right, important, meaningful.
"Okay... But you need to promise me to not touch me.", he whispered, his voice shakier than he'd like it to be.
"Yeah, ' cause you switched off his emotions.", Wade spoke through gritted teeth. Lorenz gave him a cold glare but kept up her smile, not replying to his jab. This woman gave Wade the creeps.
Tony needed a second to gather himself, blink away the tears but then he nodded. "Yeah- Yeah, of course. I'll let him in." With a pounding heart Tony left the room, running straight into Deadpool, or Wade, how Peter called him. "Hey, Daddy-o, you okay?", he asked, holding onto his shoulders. Tony looked around frantically, shaking his head slightly.
"Yeah, yeah, give me your hand now.", Bucky mumbled before analysing Peter's fingers. "This might hurt a bit.", he said before grabbing a hold of one of his fingers and yanking the broken bone back into place. It hurt, Peter didn't flinch, physical pain he could handle, it brought everything into focus. Bucky fixed another one before taping the two together, so that they'd stay in place until Peter healed.
one week. But that didn't mean that whatever happened in this week wouldn't be detrimental to Peter's recovery. It didn't mean that they could just hang back and wait for him to return.
"I don't want to die." It was a strange realization for Peter. He had wasted so much time with hating existence and now that he was dead he wanted nothing more than more time.
"I wonder if you intended to keep us low profile. If you did, you fucked that one up spectacularly.", Peter mumbled as they sat in one of the booths of the waffle house, the seat was soft, comfortable, foreign.
"How come? Have you found a will to live? If yes could you lend it to me sometime?", Wade asked, amusement in his tone.
"You're weirdly quiet, what's on your mind? ", Peter asked, apparently unaware of how close they were and how it drove Wade mad.
Wade didn't really think about where he was taking Peter. It was a given. Bring the boy back to his father. That didn't mean that it wasn't thoroughly discussed by his boxes. A conversation he tried to tune out to the best of his abilities. "Shut the fuck up.", he finally spat at Yellow just to realize that Peter was not only awake, but also staring at him.
For starters, I wanna say that I'm not trying to make Natasha the villain here. I don't consider her actions in this chapter right personally but I hope I did a good job of describing her point of view and why she did what she did. She thinks what she's doing is right.
"For the thousandth time, super hearing, you can't whisper in this house.", he said and Wade hoped that he wasn't imagining the slight hint of exasperation in his tone. It would be something.
As soon as Peter was present again the dread set in. Suddenly his eyes were shooting around fratically. Wade, Tony, Steve, Bruce, Wade. Then he looked down on himself like he only noticed his position now.
"I just want to say... that I know that this isn't your fault but you won't know that. Once you'll wake up, and you will, you'll blame yourself, so I need you to know, that I forgive you..." Speaking was hard, breathing was
Suddenly everything stopped. Peter felt a needle pierce through the skin of his neck and cold rushed through his veins. Whatever they gave him, it only took minutes to take effect. The fuzziness dispersed, the fog lifted and everything was crystal clear. The white lab, the doctors in white, agents in black, Lorenz smiling. Peter didn't hate her.  He didn't feel anything for her. He didn't feel anything at all. It was weird. It wasn't like he was numb to his feelings, his panic and terror that had been so prevalent only minutes before. It's like they weren't there entirely. Peter was empty. But for the first time he was empty and fully conscious. They lowered the halo and the cold plates pressed against his face, soon the shocks would run through his body, manipulate his brain in whichever way SHIELD saw fit. Peter wasn't afraid. He could get used to this.
"Yeah, take your time, will you?", he didn't mean for it to come out so bitter and Death noticed it as well.
"What about you, did HYDRA try to make you their next pet assassin? I mean, why give you all these powers if they can't use it?", Wade then asked and it was a valid question. It still made Peter's throat close up in panic.
"I don't know, he was like this when he got here, there is definitely something wrong with him.", Steve replied, worry coiling in his stomach. He didn't know the kid and there was no chance that he was really Peter, but he clearly needed help.
That was unusual. Normally the Fake-Peters were super confident in their heritage. Steve never understood what they were thinking. That they wouldn't make a DNA test? That they'd just believe them? Were these people all delusional?
Still, when he saw Steve's paintings, huge canvases that showed brutal, abstract and emotional motives, he had been surprised. He hadn't known that Steve had it in him.
"I thought we had time- I'm sorry, I was wrong- but I need you to know-", Peter mumbled, his eyes already half shut. Wade couldn't lose him, not now, not ever,  his heart couldn't take it.
"You can eat what you want.", Steve pointed out and Peter glanced up at him, he looked slightly startled, like Steve had pulled him out of a thought but his expression quickly neutralized again.
To say that Peter didn't take it well would've been an understatement. His head whipped around, his eyes wide, glaring at Tony, uncaring that they could now see the rivers of tears that ran down his face. "Stop! Lying to me!", he yelled, his voice cracking with the strain of it, his whole body trembling from the emotional intensity. " I can't be loved! I'm a fucking monster! I'm a thing! I'm fucking toxic, if I was left to my own devices I'd destroy everything. I know that! "
"She didn't die when Peter attacked her, she was badly injured though. Once she healed they told her that they had to put him down. That sort of broke her spirit. HYDRA apparently decided that using them as leverage against each other wasn't worth the trouble anymore. She thought he was dead until a few weeks ago when she overheard two agents talk about the west base that got corrupted and the subject that got out in the process and that there were rumours that said subject was Peter Stark. The name alone was enough motivation for her to try and break out. She then went to Stark tower because she researched Peter and in connection me and that's where Natasha picked her up.", Tony explained.
Okay, this one's a bit short but I needed it to get the plot moving. I hope you enjoy it none the less! There's a mention of Peter's suicide attempt but it's very brief and not at all graphic.
Death had wrapped her arms around her torso like she was shielding herself but she didn't step away when Wade got closer and closer.
"Okay, well I think that it would already help, if we kept him mostly lucid. As far as I can tell it's more of a compulsive thing right now, he didn't even seem aware of it. If he stays present it might be easier to keep him from harming himself. Though, we should also consider that he's using this as a form of self inflicted punishment. That's one of the more pressing issues. We have to get him to stop acting like a prisoner.
"This is not fucking real, this can't be happening. ", he whispered and started to shake his head. He must've looked pretty frantic because Bucky came to his side and laid a hand on Wade's shoulder that he flinched away from.
The jet, his father, Steve, blue sky in front of them, the soft fabric of his sweatpants between his fingers, the noise of the engine, a bitter taste in his mouth. He focused on everything he could see and feel until he felt like he was in his body again.
"Yeah, Karen made me do it.", she replied her tone as bored as her expression, she gestured into the general direction of the counter where Bucky was still talking to Karen. "It isn't my usual kind of motive."
"Peter. I'll say this real slow and as clearly as possible to make sure that you get it through your stubborn head. I'll stay here, not because I feel responsible for you but because I care about you. I care, much more than is appropriate and I kept my distance because I thought you wanted that. But the truth is, I fucking
Wade figured that there was no right answer to that question so he just went with the truth. "I know, it could be attributed to the author just being bad at plot but something about her backstory seems fishy. Why the fuck would HYDRA agents talk about you somewhere she could hear, if she's supposed to think that you're dead? How did she suddenly manage to break out all by herself? How did she even survive on her own on the run from HYDRA? These questions don't have answers and they're too big to attribute them to simple plot convenience!", Wade argued but he could already tell that he had lost Peter.
"How about a bath?", Wade asked his tone lighthearted but Peter could feel his whole body tense instantly as fear crept up his throat. Apparently that didn't go by unnoticed because Wade pulled his eyebrows together and took a step back. "Unless that's connected to a certain trauma?", he asked carefully and Peter tried to swallow the lump in his throat before replying.
He had arrived at a weird point in the conversation. Peter was far more communicative than usual and if he wanted to talk about this Wade really didn't want to stop him. But this whole topic was a minefield of possible catastrophes. Still, he dared to ask the next question."Did you ever try to-"
"I...Guess you're right... I haven't processed it, yet. ", Peter shrugged before sitting down on the couch across from her. He was dead, he knew that, but he didn't quite believe it yet. He still felt the sense of panic he had felt right before the end, the worry he felt for Gwen, the regret.
"There's a nicotine kick that sets in at first. People enjoy that. ", Bucky explained and soon Peter felt what he ment. It was weird a thing. It wasn't a huge change, Peter just felt slightly...calmer, somehow focused and fuzzy at the same time, all in all just a little lighter.
The stranger that opened the chamber was alone. That was unusual. So was his get up. Still, he was a threat, about as tall, if not even a little bit taller than Peter, but with broad shoulders and muscles showing underneath his peculiar suit. Not to mention the two katanas and the guns that were fastened to his body.
Gwen had distanced herself from the group, had curled up in a ball and started to rock while still crying quietly. Bucky was by her side, trying to get her to calm down even though he himself was shaking.
The waffles were delicious, he knew it, and the taste was almost too much, swallowing hurt but he didn't care. Peter was so focused on eating that it took him a while to notice that the waiter was still standing next to him, glaring.
"Gwen- Where did you get a gun?", he asked carefully, raising his hands to signal that he wasn't a threat.
Peter didn't recognize the woman's voice but when he crept a step further into the workshop, he could see her face on the large screen Tony was sitting in front of. She looked quite uptight and proper, her strawberry blond hair pulled back into a tight knot, a little crease between her eyebrows as she spoke.
"Just promise.", Peter asked, while taking his phone, keys and cigarettes out of the pockets of his sweats, placing them beside him.
"What he deserved.", Gwen replied cryptically and Peter heard Wade curse on the other side of the line, promisisng Gwen very inventive and gory ways in which he'd seek revenge, if Peter was harmed in any way.
I wanted to warn you that self harm is mentioned in this chapter, it's very brief and not really graphic but I still marked it with this symbol *
"And also...", Peter went on, closing his eyes for a moment before taking a rattling breath.  "For not being braver, for being a coward, for waiting until it's too late. ", he said, sounding apologetic and bitter and Wade had no idea what he was talking about.
"Because I promised to stay until you feel ready to be on your own.", Wade replied truthfully. No, it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that he was growing attached to the Spider-Boy, no, nada.
"Damn right, I fucking am!", he exclaimed. His whole body was trembling violently and he felt like he'd completely come apart if this went on for just another second. Then he felt Wade's big hand on his shoulder and they locked eyes.
