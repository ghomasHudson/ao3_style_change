Steve pulled out his phone, about to send her a text when he saw the time on his screen. Almost 1 AM. He put his phone on his nightstand instead, but asked Jarvis to let him know the moment Nat woke up tomorrow. He would need as much advice as he could get with this.
somethin-somethin." Clint quietly sneered from behind his cereal. Steve wasn't really sure what he meant. Surely Tony wouldn't want anything from him, would he? He thought about it. No. Over the last month, he's gotten to know Tony, everyone at the tower really, and knew they all had each other's backs.
Last chapter will be up tomorrow morning!
shut them right up.
"What?" Steve's eyes went wide. Had he? "No...I don't think it's come up. But I thought...I thought it was obvious? I mean,
"What exactly happened? The day you moved in?" Tony asked frantically. Steve thought back, trying to remember anything of significance. It seemed like a normal day.
"That's not it at all Steve." Natasha calmly explained. "He's just worried about you."
"There!" Steve pointed at a large building. "It's a Macy's! Let's go."
As luck would have it, Natasha and Clint decided to come in to the SHIELD office after breakfast. Steve was glad to run into them - he pulled them aside and explained Tony's plans in Tajikistan, and how the Avengers and SHIELD could help with construction and security.
"Sorry, Stevie. I just woke up. Looks like we missed the game." Tony apologized with another little peck to Steve's cheek.
"Selfie mode?" Steve looked down at his screen. "What's that?"
“Er...maybe too much fun.” Tony pushed his face back into Steve’s broad chest, hiding his blush. “I may have accidentally slept with you in another dimension.” He confessed.
7-13-12
Steve cut up a portion of asparagus and dipped it in their decadent, creamy garlic aioli, guiding the delicious bite to Tony's lips.
It's like it was just him and Tony, now. That was enough. More than enough. He let himself fall asleep listening to Tony's voice.
Yep, our little baby's birthday is on May 29th. More coming soon. Everyone stay safe <3
"I'm not." Natasha poked him in the chest. "But YOU are. So make a move already."
A bartender came over unprompted with two drinks in tall glasses. He lit the small candles on their table and left again without a word. The warm lights flickered, just bright enough to barely reach their faces and not an inch more, a constant reminder of just how close the two men were sitting.
"I had a great time." Steve stood up and motioned for Tony to follow. They walked back the couple of blocks to the hotel, Steve explaining something to Tony on the way. "You know I really enjoy that you talk to me so much, right? I don't want you to stop just because you feel that you're annoying me or anything. You aren't annoying at all. In fact, I don't know where I'd be without you." Tony slipped his hands in his pockets, but kept quiet to listen. "You gave me a place to stay, made sure I was safe on this trip, in more ways than one. You even offered to visit when I was feeling real' low. I couldn't ask for a better friend. So I want to hear
"I mean, we don't have to talk about it if you don't want." Tony shyly replied. "We can just, you know. Hang out." He got uncharacteristically quiet, waiting for a response.
Steve took a deep breath. He knew Tony liked to dance, knew Tony would have fun if given the opportunity, knew he needed to start making his intentions known soon, or he would lose his chance.
"It's a Speedo! A perfectly acceptable swimsuit for men."
Tony just looked down at their joined hands and nodded.
think I was his husband, I guess they use my room sometimes when the penthouse is being renovated. He just crawled into my lap and said he’d missed me, and I said I’d missed him too. I thought...I thought it was
"Yes. Jarvis pulled that up for us and we are ready."
The biggest item was a black sturdy circular bag - clearly made specifically for his shield. There was a small rectangular block, which upon closer inspection, had the same input that his phone charger did. After a few tries, he found that it was a phone stand, that was charging his phone without being connected to the outlet on the wall. There was a small bag that contained a lot of tools inside, clearly meant to be a roadside repair kit. He didn't recognize what one of the items was, a silver box with a keyhole, but no keys. The last thing he found at the bottom of the package was a wallet containing only a black credit card made out to Steve Rogers.
Tony stepped out of the portal, and into the lab - wearing his full Ironman suit and carrying several bags of testing equipment. Good - it had worked. The HUD in his helmet shut down around him, just like he knew it would. His systems weren’t designed to be compatible with the mirrored servers here in this universe, after all. But thankfully, all he needed was the maneuverability of the suit, and the independent oxygen filtration to run. He took a step forward and heard something crunch under his boot. He looked down and saw he’d stepped on some blueprints. For some kind of spaceship? He looked back, no inter-dimensional portal - no frame or control panels. If this was a mirror universe, everything should be the same as back home. Great. So it
Overall, it was a good first day back. Great, even. Almost perfect. They ate cake (after Steve stealthily hid the shortcake away- thankfully Tony had ordered several small cakes this time to avoid certain people from finishing it all.) Clint showed Steve some video games and they played for a while. They all watched old Disney movies together, Thor asking hilarious questions about animal communication, only slightly confused when everyone had to explain to him that deer and rabbits can't actually talk. Then they all shared an early dinner and went their separate ways to get ready for the work week. So yeah, a good, good day.
"Uh," Tony stopped and looked at him. "What?"
"You're going to scan my muscles?" Steve instinctively got into a defensive position when some holograms of the alien creatures they battled a few months ago suddenly appeared all around him.
he didn't like."
“Get back! Who the fuck
"Did you finally make a move?" Natasha asked. Steve sighed.
"It's..." Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. "Yeah. I'm sorry. I wish I could stay, I really do. This is just a really busy week. I promise I'll make it up to you."
"Thank youuuu." She cooed.
have in his room, waiting for Tony. Now was as good a time as any, he supposed.
"I might give it a try then." Steve beamed. "The pants I mean. Not the clubbing. Not really my style." Tony chuckled a bit at that. "You coming up?"
The waiter came by to take their empty plates and was back a moment later with a small dessert. a piece of chocolate cake, adorned with berries, and one fork to share. It was surrounded by a chocolate drizzle, in the shape of a heart.
Steve snorted, "Yes, mother." He sat on his new bed, much firmer than his last one, which he appreciated. There was a small ding from Tony's phone.
"I vote for Die Hard! - OW!" Clint yelled from his spot next to Natasha right before she punched him in the arm.
"Nonsense." Tony waved him over to the car and driver currently packing up his bags and bike. "Just wanted you to see what you've been missing." Steve walked right up to Tony and hugged him tight, feeling the smaller man hug back, and it didn't feel as awkward as last time, when they were saying goodbye. Maybe it was easier now, because Steve was certain of where he belonged. They both got in the car and were off, Steve grateful that he didn't need to try to stay alert on his bike at this late hour. As excited as he was, he began to nod off to the rhythmic sound of the tires on pavement, and the dull shine of highway lights passing them by. He closed his eyes and let himself rest for a bit, guessing that Tony wouldn't mind the quiet drive home.  Steve had guessed wrong, apparently.
be another timeline.”
agree to a day off? But as Steve pulled Tony down into his lap on the loveseat, he couldn’t help but wonder what the others would say when they got there.
“That’s the NATO Secretary General over there - he’ll introduce us.” Tony quickly interrupted, never looking away from the crowd. He sounded...normal. Cheerful, even. “We won’t need to say much - this is more of a Q&A thing. The reporters are all hand-picked so nothing out of your league.” He waved at the crowd again and flashed a smile at the man clearing his voice at the podium before continuing. “Then there’s a meet and greet with the VIP reporters and politicians in attendance. Just smile and shake their hands. You can do that.”
He opened the door to reveal a winded, nervous...
“I’ve
Steve didn't know what 'posting a nude to Twitter' was, but it sounded like Jarvis would look after him. As nervous as he was about staying with all these people he just met, he was also relieved that he might be able to get some answers about day to day living now, more than he could at SHIELD anyways. Everyone there treated him like he had a 'fragile' sticker on his forehead, and were so secretive to boot.
- I’m sure your Tony wouldn’t be upset if you explain what happened.”
And they hung up, Steve instantly missing Tony already. But he fell into an easy sleep, warmed by how close the two were becoming.
"I don't really celebrate my birthday, sorry." Tony pulled away. Steve immediately missed the warmth. Why did he always go and say the wrong thing when it came to Tony?
He tried to think back to the gorgeous half naked men and women he saw today. But it felt so impersonal. Cheap. Fake. That didn't do it for him, so he tried to think of Peggy. That just made him sad.
“Maybe you should renovate then.” He half-joked. “How are we supposed to take long, romantic baths together without a huge tub?” That made Tony laugh, and he excitedly pushed Steve into the shower, listing off all his ideas for how they could renovate the penthouse. Steve listened quietly, a big smile on his face as he scrubbed Tony’s back gently with soap. When they were clean, he guided them out, wrapping Tony up in a big fluffy towel.
"Mm..y'kay?" He mumbled out.
"Okay. Sorry for the ugly mug. Been trying to scale some reactor batteries down in size again, but it's hard when you have to try to make them on a budget for your cheapskate investors, you know? I'm on the clock, so no time for my fancy bubble baths."
He'd promised himself that he wouldn't let this year end without getting an answer, but it was already the end of December, and this party was just so...so damned
Steve let out a shaky breath and couldn't stop a tear or two from slipping out. Why was he crying? Some of the tension in his chest left at the realization that Tony was still up, and probably still overthinking everything like Steve was. God, he felt like he was on an emotional rollercoaster. His hands were unsteady as he texted back.
"I understand that reactor energy is affordable, self-sustaining and reliable. I've seen it in action myself, as have all of you. There's no mistaking it - it's revolutionary. No. It will not be as lucrative as selling barrels of petroleum or hoarding coal reserves. But that's not what this company is about. I knew Howard Stark - founder of Stark Industries. He was a man with a great vision for the future. He always told me that he was limited by the technology of his time. Back then, we had to solve problems with brute strength and weapons, because it was all we had. Well, now his great son - Anthony Stark - has achieved far more than Howard could have ever expected, or imagined. We are now able to solve problems with brains instead of brawn. It would be foolish to hold back the progress of society over one generation of profits."
“Is that bad?” Steve asked, suddenly very worried. “Will Tony be able to get back home? Will
“Oh, right.” Tony got a worried look on his face. Steve was thankful that he had a better idea of Tony’s insecurities after their talk, and he was able to guess the problem right away.
just days before such a big event. All the major news outlets would be there. Steve considered how he could spin this - the media would surely notice that Tony wasn’t speaking to him - that is, if he showed up at all.
After the 5th inning, Tony was getting irritated at the constant back and forth. The next time Steve came to his side, he grabbed his arm, dragged them to the couch in front of the big screen, and yanked him down beside him.
So they stayed up for a while, Tony telling Steve about his troubles that day. Apparently there was some important project that Tony was trying to get approved, but a lot of the board members were against it because it wouldn't be profitable for the company. Today, those members decided to hold their own meeting, where they scheduled a town hall for next week, inviting some of the biggest shareholders, without consulting or inviting Tony.
"Just...still hard to believe I guess." Tony smiled, already feeling better in Steve's warm embrace.
He quickly got a response.
They finished stripping down, leaving their dirty clothes in a pile on the tile, so they wouldn't ruin the soft rugs in their bedroom. Steve blushed as Tony took his hand, leading him to their spacious bathroom, water already heating up for them. Steve tried to avert his gaze from his very handsome, very naked boyfriend in the rising steam. He still wasn't used to seeing Tony naked, maybe he would never get used to it, the way it gave him a rush, made his mouth water.
"Uhm. Yeah." He spurted out. "Night."
trust you, I came back for
So to hell with being nice.
“I thought - I don’t know. He said he had missed me. I thought he just meant, in general. Like, since we’ve been apart. I mean, I missed
Steve stared up at the ceiling, listening to the swish and tumble of the washing machine. He had to do something about it. There was no way he would wait too long to make a move again. If only it was that easy, though. Even though he was a big, strong, manly looking guy, he was actually very shy when it came down to it. Most people wouldn't spare him a second glance for most of his life, so he never learned how to properly court someone. He remembered some moves that Bucky would use on their nights out but, well, those usually ended in one night stands where Steve would pretend not to hear heels quietly tapping across the floorboards, out the door early the next morning. He didn't want that. He wanted something real, something lasting with Tony. So he had to do this right, he wouldn't mess up this chance with such an amazing, one of a kind fella.
Steve just winked at him.
"Guess so." Tony smiled back. Neither one wanted to move, but Jarvis unfortunately had to speak up again.
Steve slowly drifted into consciousness. He was warm.
"Speaking of that," Steve started. "Um...so...are we...just so we're clear, you know..."
Tony watched as everyone scrambled to make their afternoon one that they would always remember. Just a few days ago, he felt like an intruder in his own home. Now, he was glad to be here, happy to see everyone so comfortable with each other, so comfortable with
“Need a hand, gorgeous?” Tony purred, noticing Steve’s fascinated gaze. He straddled Steve, leaning forward to pull his jacket and shirt down. His fully erect cock rubbing against Steve’s unbearably tight pants that were still on for some damned reason.
“Shut up. Come with me to go say hi, guys. I wanna see if he’ll let me tag along next Patriots game.” Sam grabbed Bucky’s hand, pulling him along.
It was more than that, though. Yes, Steve was aware that he had a crush on the man. That much was obvious now. But it was like an obsession, his every mood affected so strongly by his interactions with the genius. He yearned for Tony's attention. Like an addiction, he would seek him out, do almost anything to make the other man laugh, or talk to him, or touch him.
At the end of their conversation, when it felt like the rest of the world had long ago gone to sleep and it was just the two of them under the stars, Steve was feeling brave. He always liked when Tony would call him fun new nicknames. It was clever, and he saw it as Tony's way of showing that he cared. Secretly, he'd come up with a few himself for the other man, though he'd never been bold enough to use any of them. They were both yawning and struggling to keep their eyes open, when Steve internally said 'fuck it' and decided he wanted to show the scientist that he cared too.
"At the office right now. Why?"
"Deal." Tony smiled. His night got considerably better after that.
“What do you think? It was humiliating. Disgraceful. Awkward as hell.” Tony put his ice cream on the coffee table, giving up on it entirely. “I was basically groveling for them to come back. But if I
"So is that a yes or no on taking it slow?" Tony traced circles on Steve's chest with a finger while he zipped his pants back up with his other hand.
Steve shook is head no. "SHIELD offered, but the doctors there seemed...off. Like I was some experiment they wanted to study. I was afraid the therapist would treat me the same way."
"Not at all." And he meant it. "But who taught you the word 'tacky?' You're not using it right. What you
how it happened, Tony.” Steve pressed.
Huh? He was about to text back, asking what on Earth she was taking about, when Steve walked into the room.
“But...but you said it’s not-”
Tony was going to open his mouth to protest - to make another joke - to say something, anything to put Steve's confession into doubt, because surely his feelings couldn't last forever, and he needed to protect himself through quick words and humor, just in case. In case he was let down, in case Steve changed his mind in the morning, in case he realized Tony wasn't as good in bed as the tabloids made him out to be, or was too clingy, or always said the wrong thing at the wrong time. But all those thoughts came to a screeching halt when Steve's lips found his, the tender kiss melting away his worries. Steve pulled back again and searched his eyes before speaking.
"Tony don't worry about a thing. The worst is over. It's up hill from here keep that in mind ok?" He smiled, trying his best to comfort him. From what he'd learned from experience on the battlefield the best thing you can do is to just keep up hope. He wasn't able to predict the future but nothing good can come from being pessimistic. That wouldn't help whatsoever; he just didn't want to lose Tony. He was the only tether to his past. He was his ally and friend, the son of Howard.
"What's happening?!" Steve exclaimed hysterically. The one holding a face mask explained that there was nothing wrong, that this was the desired effect. He stated that the sedative would relieve most of the stress and help him relax. It made everything a lot easier on him to be sedated and not awake, that way he was able to get some well deserved rest. Being he's been through quite a hefty amount of trauma and blood loss, it's a wonder why he hasn't keeled over by now, let alone you know. The worst was over but there was still a long period before he would be out of danger. He had sustained quite a severe injury, as well as lucky enough to even stay alive and in such high spirits.
He had plenty practice concealing his presence on missions, it would be nothing to slip out of a building he'd become accustomed to. He threw together a gym bag with some clothes when he had the idea to bring Tony some fresh clothes and things as well. His room was on the floor below his. He slipped out allowing his door to slowly shut behind him as he made his way down the stairs.
The medics rushed Tony in as soon as possible, his two friends went to wait and the rest of the hospital crew was on standby for this very moment. He was in really bad shape at this point, still unconscious but barely breathing even with oxygen support. The pair of medics busted threw the doors with the gurney and never stopped; some nurses who had been patiently waiting rushed over and helped redirect them toward the Emergency Room. Steve and Bruce were hardly able to get into the building with all of the commotion going on between the staff. Most of them were shouting commands that they only half understood. A lady took them a side and brought them to the waiting room, they just watched as their friend was being wheeled away from them.
The shock wave was much greater than he's originally expected that as well as the blinding flash of light. 'Somebody must have been playing prank on us or something. That was hardly a threat, more of a nuisance really.' Tony thought to himself as bits and pieces of debris lightly pelted his armor. Nowhere near able to a dent in his suit, after all it was meant to deflect bullets and all other attacks.
"Honestly Tony that's one of the stupidest thing I've heard you say. Aren't you supposed to be some sort of genius, what kind of crap is that to ask?! We all care for you and what happens to you even if you don't seem to care yourself." Steve huffed in frustration. He'd waited hours to see him and then longer for him to be comprehensible and all he wants to know is why he did what he did. Tony merely blinked at his supposedly empty words.
He tensed up again; he hated not knowing what was going to happen next. Stressed him out beyond belief, that was way worse than his anger, he could at least control that now. He didn't even have a clue on how to even begin to tackle the uneasiness of anxiety. Whatever elevated feeling that filled the small space, disappeared once more and was replaced with a gloomy once again. The driver glanced back at him again but this time increasing his speed.
After all they had been waiting hours for any sort of word and this was the first time they were getting anything remotely close to news. It was safe to say they were a little on edge. They made way for the other two to enter and silently waited for them to speak. Steve could sense the tension in the air and did the only thing that would alleviate it. "He's fine," he said flashing a genuine smile before heading to the couch. Thor was passed out on the right side. So much for being a god, it's kind of pathetic that he couldn't even stay up passed 2:30. Oh well it can't be helped, if anything it was kind of a blessing in disguise. The last thing he needed right now was an overjoyed Asgardian. He gets enough of that on a regular basis since they've been working together.
"My radar's informing me the there is an incoming missile and it's headed straight for the tower Sir." Jarvis quickly informed the lot as he took the liberty of pulling up some of the current satellite feed. The Stark Company being one of the most technologically advanced in the world as well as one of the most profitable companies as well had loads of excess wealth. Not to mention the largest global guiding systems as well, over 20 satellites orbited the planet. It seemed like it could have been used for way more than just targeting for nukes. Being that the Avengers would be saving people more regularly now that they're were officially a team. The tech had a new purpose, crazy that the first alert would be a threat sent directly to their door.
Steve stood from his seat without a single word. A tightened expression plastered on his face. He put his chair back where he found it and the pair walked out of the room, Bruce closing the door behind them. They walked down the halfway in silence. At two in the morning the hospital wasn't super busy and they were the only ones walking around at least on that side of the building. Only the sound of their footsteps echoing in the hallway gave to the silence. After rounding the corner Bruce decided it was time to break the silence. "What do you think he meant?"
His head pounded and his body was hot and burning against the sheets. His body jolted when he felt a strangers hand touch him, he quickly realized where he was and he couldn't decide whether the nightmare was actually over. However he would allow them to stick him with whatever needle they so desired, anything to kill the pain.
Once his patent was settled the doctor then rummaged through several drawers before pulling out a little vile and a syringe. Since he found what he was looking for he rushed over to Tony and pierced the covering of the vile and filled the needle with dull yellow liquid.
Once he could keep the coughing at bay he gave up his attempts to sit up and let his head sink back into the pillow. He felt every inch of his burning insides as the slowly settled back down as well. Pained tears worked down the sides of his cheeks although he wouldn't want them too. With the rest of his efforts he lifted his hand to wipe them away. It crossed over the light cast from the reactor the substance on his palm reflected. It showed dark liquid against the blue glow. He knew exactly what it was.
Tony never cared much for his father. He loved him he really did but he was always too busy to pay attention to him when he was growing up. He couldn't really blame him though; I mean he did have one of the biggest companies in the United States to run after all. When he was around Howard the thing he talked about was either ways to improve the business or about his past working with the famed Captain America. For the longest time Tony idolized his, how couldn't he? He was a hero that ended the world war.
"This idea of romance you humans have on Earth is so subtle compared to that of Asgard. Jane is the complete opposite of how normal people how you say 'flirt'. When I first met her she hit me with her metal carrier. Now that's a woman." He finished with a smile.
His mind was stuck between whether or not he should make an omelet first or another drink. He seemed to miss a beat in his step. Almost like he awkwardly lost control of his motor skills, no matter how drunk he got he was able to right himself. He took a couple steps before his knee buckled and stumbled down into a kneeling position, bracing the fall with his forearm before completely embracing the floor. There was something utterly wrong with this picture. He blinked a few times to comprehend what just happened but it only made his vision blur.
"Oh it's not that. It's just I guess I forgot how it felt to be treated like a person and not something that'll just level a house or fend off an entire army." Bruce admitted, swirling his water once more before taking a sip.
“Hey I brought you some stuff.” Steve rummaged through the bag finding his phone beneath some clothes he’d snagged last moment. Tony looked over as he handed it over. Steve set it in his hands and sat back down. Even though Tony was half out of it he had no trouble unlocking it and tapping rhythmically against the glass. Steve hadn’t figured that one out yet. He didn’t want to seem amazed but he kind of was.
"Hey don't get all sentimental on us now. I don't do gushy." Tony stated, finishing off his drink.
"No I got it.. But I didn't think I was that drunk..." Tony said slowly coming back to reality now that he was settled, although his head was swimming and the throbbing feeling has yet cease. In fact he felt sick to him stomach and hunched over expecting to vomit all over. Hoping it would finally relive this sick feeling.
"Thanks captain obvious." Clint said while walking over to join the others as he placed a hand to his side as he watched Tony configure to screen, beer still in hand. Even though he was trained to be calm in extreme situations, he still seemed a bit more lax than he should have been; this was after all an emergency. Probably because of all the critical missions he'd been involved in as well as being utterly out matched during the attack on Manhattan. Someone else could take care of it for once, they were qualified enough, plus it was his day off anyway.
Tony’s room really wasn’t that far from his it was quite convenient. It felt like he was at his door in an instant daring to go inside. He’d never seen the inside before, he wasn’t even sure if he’d be able to navigate it. He was lucky to find the door was unlocked as he let himself in, overnight bag in hand. Tony’s room was extra large and dark besides the dimmed recess lights lining the ceiling. The atmosphere was sort of ominous and displacing for Steve, still the furniture that filled it was exquisite.
"You're right Captain, like always but it really makes my blood boil knowing that after all we did for this planet a few days ago it still doesn't change the fact that some people just want to watch the world burn."
A shaky yet firm hand reached out and grasped the wrist of the doctor before he was able to inject the substance into the IV. His finger tips dug into his sleeves as he lifted his head to look him in the eyes.
"You underestimate.. How well I can hold my alcohol.." He smirked. He always had a habit of making a joke in bad situations. It made everything feel less tense in a way kind of like a defense mechanism. He attempted to sit up more but it sent a shooting pain that spread through his side and up through his chest. Forcing him to fling his head back and stay still until it would suffice, his eyes squeezed shut. His side throbbed vigorously as he clutched it with the arm that was not attached to an IV and other machines. His head pounded just as bad, an after effect of the drugs mixing with the alcohol already in his system.
In a way he almost blamed himself for not compromising on a best strategy. Though no one could have seen something like this coming, after all the Iron Man armor was supposed to be near invincible. It's like someone planned it out and targeted Tony. Knowing that he would of went up there and dealt with it. "You're going to be ok Tony." Steve interjected as he and Natasha rushed over with the cutters.
The doctor pulled the covers Tony and left the room for the others to say their goodbyes. Steve sat back down in his chair resting his cheek against his fist and Bruce decided to stay standing. The two of them remained silent as they watched Tony sleep. He looked so peaceful even with the oxygen mask was strapped to his face. A faint wheezing could be heard with every inhale he took. Bruce placed a hand on his shoulder and sighed, "I think it's about time we headed back to the tower; I'm sure the others are worried sick."
Steve remained timid and distant as the woman tended to Tony's vitals and distributed various medicines through strange tubes connected to his arm. He did seem to tensen less as the drugs entered his system his body didn't have to work so hard. Keep his body focused on healing and not on the pain.
The way his skin looked made him near sick to his stomach, if it wasn't for his time in the service he probably would have lost his lunch. How Tony was able to hold out the way he did or even be able to force himself to sit up was a mystery to him. It was a long cut at least 20 stitches and a few staples held it together, but that wasn't what alarmed the hardened soldier. It was his skin; the discoloration was something he hadn't seen before. It was made him ache just to look at it. He turned away for a moment while the good doctor rewrapped his side.
He met new people, two special agents, a scientist with an special ability who was in fact a really nice guy, and some guy that fell out of the sky that actually turned out to be a pretty cool guy also. There was also the son of his old friend who happened to be the same age as his father back when he knew him. There was also entire organization that he knew back in the day as merely a starter project, climb its way to the top. They'd just barely got to know each other, post introductions were only an understatement, but none the less they learned how to work together and it paid off. They'd won, it was near impossible but they had done it, together.
"From the information that Jarvis collected it appears it'll hit the tower within 15 minutes or so. That is unless we can destroy it before it demolishes the tower. It's still pretty far away and it shouldn't take much to destroy it before it can get any closer. Lucky for us Jarvis spotted it before it got too close for comfort." Tony said, slurring his words just a tad but still adequately informing the all too eager super soldier.
It was just shy of 10 hours since an incident occurred at Stark Tower when a rogue missile causes their celebration to cut short. Among the Avengers, Iron man was the one who’d easily be able to take on the projectile aimed at them. With seconds to act he suited up and swiftly disposed of the projectile. He didn't think much to who'd sent it, surly it was only a matter of time before they'd be targeted. What he didn't expect was to be impaled by something imbedded within the weapon; something able to pierce his suit.
"Huh I guess so." He seemed to daze off a bit, the thought of that battle still haunting him even though he'd been awake. The thought of sleeping and potently reliving those nightmares over and over again terrified him. 'A hero? More like a frightened puppy..' he thought.
She walked past the huge puddle of blood where Tony was bleeding out just moments ago and traced the marks left when Steve slid the shard away out of exasperation. It left a large red skid mark to where it now lye presently. She had a very peculiar idea as to what it was made of, but wasn't entirely sure. She took a glance at the Captain America shield lying up against the side of the couch where Steve was sitting earlier.
He raised his hand to the dimed light and stared at his darkened finger tips, stained with his ally's blood. He had seen many of his friends slant in battle like a true hero defending their beliefs and even willing to die for them. This was not honorable; a sneak attack was one of the most shameful things a person could do in battle. But then to not even show their face is just cowardly. He scowled, just the thought of it made his blood boil. Having made a new friend, he was not about to lose him this way. Or if anything to let his sacrifice be in vain. "Be strong friend."
"Tony maybe it would be a good idea to slow down a bit. I mean just take a break and relax for a while" Bruce was referring to the drink he was in the process of making, which in this case would be his fifth one. Even if he was a rich boy with a high tolerance for alcohol it would still be in his best interest to let up a little. After all drinking yourself into oblivion was not always the best way to party.
"I thought the same thing when I heard it but the thing he needed was rest or else he wouldn't recover. I hope it's nothing I really do. I don't want him to suffer anymore then he already has." Steve answered solemnly as they approached the front doors, giving a slight wave at the receptionist as they exited the hospital. "I'll tell you one thing I do know. I hate this, all of it and I want whoever did this to Tony to pay for it. They haven't the slight idea who they're screwing with." Steve said quietly and colder than Bruce had anticipated this was something that was way out character for the so called liberator. He could tell he was serious. After all they were the Avengers.
They wheeled him out and down another hallway. The main surgeon cleaned himself up and removed his soiled scrubs. He didn't want to alert them by his appearance, like buttered him or something. He washed his hands and left down another hallway that would lead to area where the waiting room was. He knocked on the door and was immediately greeted with the worried Captain. "Hello sir my name is Dr. Shelton, may I come in."
Even since leaving the hospital couldn't shake that uneasy feeling he had. He was able to push it down and ignore it for a bit but it was beginning to eat at him. "..I can't.." What did that mean? What was he trying to tell me? It was like he was afraid of closing his eyes or something. Maybe that's why he forced himself to stay conscious when it would have been easier to drift off and not feel anything for a while.
Steve and Bruce figured it'd better to observe from the roof where they could see just about everything, just in case something was to go wrong. They walked over to the side of the balcony where there was a ladder that led to the very top of the building. Steve was first to climb which took mere seconds compared to Bruce who steadily followed him. The others stayed inside not having much interest in watching. It wasn't too exciting since Tony pretty much blew up something on a daily basis.
One well placed, concentrated blast should be all he would need to explode the insignificant threat. He held out his right arm, keeping the other down at his side in order to maintain his stability. Jarvis targeted the missile through the suits system and locked onto its exact coordinates. He held his position and charged of up a fair amount of energy in his palm to blast a hole straight threw a cinder block building with little resistance. He waited until it was nearly in front of his face before he finally shot a bright blue ray in its direction.
Tony's eyes opened slowly although they remained unfocused, his lids desperately clinging together wanting to stay sealed. It was when he was greeted with a sharp agonizing pain did he force his eyes to see. There was this dull ache that intensified with every breath.
It wouldn't take long before it would hit so he'd have to deal with it while it was a safe distance away from them or any other buildings. His radar quickly picked up the location and distance of it. It was less than a mile out from the tower. He figured he had enough of wasting time and the quicker he dealt with this the quicker he could get back and relax. He put his arms parallel to his side and boosted his thrusters, taking off into the air.
"Is he dreaming?" Steve said beneath his breath. He squeezed his wrist feeling the pulse become erratic. His muscles were twitching; whatever he was dreaming about got him riled up. Then the machine went off.
There were moments where he'd reminded him of his friend from ages ago. He'd known him for less than two weeks but it feels like years. He was the closest thing that reminded him of one of his dearest friends. It just wasn't fair, not after everything we've been through. He shouldn't have to be suffering. Steve bit his bottom lip a surge of helplessness flowing through him.
Against his better judgment he mustard his strength and hauled himself up. Every inch of his body screamed in disagreement but he ignored it. He grunted painfully, his body warn and tender.
He didn't miss his time line too much; there was way more poverty and diseases with no way of treatment. He didn't miss the war; after all he half expected to die in it. Along with everyone else he fought alongside with, even with the serum he figured it was inevitable. All he could do was except that fact, but after all the hell he'd managed to come out of it. The only thing he missed was his friends, Bucky and Howard, and Peggy. He wished he could have had their dance just before his mission. He really liked Peggy and his entire life he could never even talk to a girl, she was different; it's like she could see him for who he was and not judge him by his appearance. She was a caring woman just like his mother. He wished he had longer but his timing was off, it was always off.
After the battle, Thor took his troublesome brother Loki home to Asgard to be tried for his crimes in attempting to take over the Earth. The Allfather was not proud in the least bit though Loki could honestly care less. He was the god of mischief after all. It was his pleasure to cause trouble. Even if it was just to destroy or enslave another world. It wasn't a mystery as to why since he couldn't rule over his own. Or what he at least thought was his own.
"I've had this job for over 25 years believe it or not." Bruce was shocked that he ended up answering his stupid question from earlier. It made him happy to be heard, whether it was Steve, any other one of his team mate or just some random stranger. It was nice to be able to vent to someone who's willing to listen. "The name's Denis by the way, nice to meet you Bruce." He said sticking one of his hands out to the other, who in turn grasped it firmly. "We're finally here."
It was funny he spent half his life idolizing the man to his right and the other half resenting him. Tony was a logical thinker and no matter how he looked at the question he still couldn't figure it out. He didn't even know him until about a week ago and it just didn't add up. "Why do you care so much anyway?" Tony chuckled painfully but he couldn't help it. He had to know. That last remark caught Steve off guard but attention in an instant, drawing it away from Banner suddenly leaving the room. He instantly went from being worried to angry, "how could I not care?!" He retorted a little harsher then he was meaning to. But to him it was a stupid question to ask.
Steve and Natasha looked up at the blond with raised eyebrows, Tony only laughing at the far end of them. Clint shared in on the chuckle; Bruce just shook his head then looked at his glass of water. He could see his reflection on the liquid. Every time he'd move it'd ripple slightly, distorting the image.
"Look down at his side. There's something stuck in him!" Clint quickly pointed out. The others looked down where he was pointing. There was a large shard of metal that seemingly sliced threw his high tech armor as if it was as thin as paper, piercing his left side.
He pulled it out getting a better look in the light. His eyes widened, instantly he realized who it was even through the dark muddied hair and rugged appearance it was clear that was Tony. He read the headline to one of the papers, ‘American scientist and entrepreneur Anthony Stark held captive after weapons test in Afghanistan.’
Bruce looks more ghostly compared to his companion, somewhat lost like he didn't know what was going to happen next which in all honesty they didn't. Steve more as if he was on a mission, that if something extremely important was at stake. Bruce however seemed stuck in a trance at least for the moment. I guess you could say even after the hours of waiting things were still processing in his mind.
The surgeon used biodegradable stitches and with carful precision started threading them threw the ripped sides of his lung, pulling them back together best he could. This would be the longest part but once all the necessary structures were reconnected they could finally close him up. Once the inner parts of his lung were reattached the blood flow slowed down considerably. He then enclosed some of the loose muscle tissue back together and with much thicker stitches he sewed his skin back best he could. IT didn't look horribly bad, the cross stitched line on his abdomen was straight and bound tight. The bruising around had gotten extremely worst once the procedure was near finished. Dark purple was all that was there, it surrounded the fresh scar.
Tony looked so peaceful, his face was relaxed and his hair was in a tangled mess. It was getting really late. Bruce had been falling asleep over the past 2 hours; his head would occasionally nod off until he finally gave in. He sat behind the captain in an overly comfortable chair and joined the other in rest. It was almost midnight and after all the commotion I wouldn't blame him for being tired. They would be leaving soon anyways the other are probably worried sick by now.
"Hey Bruce are you really ok. You've just seemed really off today. I mean I haven't known you for very long but you always seemed pretty upbeat even if you are you know." Steve blatantly mentioned, I guess in attempts at making small talk. That or it was high time he got to know the real Bruce and not just what he's heard in the briefing he got not that long ago when he first met him. From what he's heard and what he's learned from working with the man, they were two totally different given aspects. He was very impressed by what he was capable of but in another sense deep down he could understand what it's like to be different also not fitting in as well as you would initially like.
He didn’t acknowledge her until she spoke up, her voice low quiet. “Take it you couldn’t sleep either?”
He dashed for the elevator not taking a chance in waiting for the paramedics to come all the way up to the first floor with a stretcher. They were trained professionals he knew that, but time was of the essence and even if they knew whose life was at stake they still took too long. The only thing that truly mattered at the moment was that the ambulance was here waiting down stairs. The rest was irrelevant, just as long as he could get him medical help, all would be well... He could only hope.
"Lovely," Tony sighed, his eyes heavy again.
"Steve I feel really horrible. Like all of this is my fault. If I just tried to stop him from flying up there then none of this would of happened. He wasn't fit to be out there like he was; at least if he would have been sober then maybe he would have been able to dodge it in time."
The Black Widow is well aware of her surroundings but tonight she was in a fog. She noticed Steve was being unusually distant since coming back; he didn’t look anyone in the eye. Just as her mind turned to him he passed by, she was sitting in the dark. They just so happen lock eyes with each other. She was cozied up on the couch with a blanket still bright eyed and awake.
That reassured him as returning to a light genuine smile. He combed some of the jet black hair out of his face using his fingertips. 'I don't think I've ever seen him look this happy before, so peaceful. It's a lot nicer than his constant diarrhea of the mouth. It's sad that he has to get sedated to be like this.' He thought to himself as he hummed lightly to himself. He could watch his chest steadily rise and fall all night if it meant he was alright, even if it was with an aided breath. Seeming utterly content and remaining hopeful, he knew Tony was strong that he was going to get through this like it was just one really bad hang over.
Steve assumed he'd nodded off again. Several minutes rolled in silence before he spoke up. “Thank you by the way. You cared enough to save my life.”
"No sedatives.." He managed through clenched teeth, wincing at what few words he could manage. The doctor only gave him a confused look. It didn't make any sense to him. It was obvious he was in a substantial amount of pain.
"Yea and don't forget to wear your seat belt Tony. Remember click it or ticket." Clint interjected with a snobbish resonance in his laughter obviously attempting to be the funny man in this situation. No one was buying it. Everyone either looked nervous or near discussed, well the ones that acknowledged him did. Honestly Bruce and Steve were too caught up in the situation to be bothered by his unusual ignorance.
But now it's gotten way out of hand. There were things out there too big for any of us. I mean they got extremely lucky the first time but that's an understatement. How is anybody supposed to just walk away from what happened that day. Our entire world has been turned upside down and now all kinds of craziness is happening all around. No sane person could walk out of that unaffected. So I guess that sums up where Tony's sanity lies, up there in that hole that opened up over the city.
He was beginning to coupe; after all it'd been such a long time since he'd worked with others. Especially one's as extraordinary as these ones. In his mind it hadn't been long at all, almost like waking up the next day, when in reality it had been several decades. It was an experience to say the least; he'd never been in a situation like that ever before. But he was glad he was able to work with people with hearts as big as his, even if some of them had their faults but they all meant well. He thought of Bucky a lot, it was understandable to miss your best friend. To watch your friend fall from your reach in unforgiving tundra was one of the hardest things he's experienced.
She went to turn on her heel to check on the data but was stopped by an unexpected embrace from her long time friend. This surprised her for a moment, but it really shouldn't have. Clint hated seeing her troubled it didn't suit her, she was too strong to be put down by something like this. They were never the worrying type; never really had to, with them it was do your job to the best of your ability and live to see another day. Not to worry but be aware of any possible outcomes. He hugged her tighter, I guess this time they couldn't help but worry. They'd seen similar situations involving other agents they knew, with more devastating results. "He gonna be fine Nat, they man is just as stubborn as Furry. It'll take a lot more than something like this to finish him. I bet even right now he's pushing everyone around and giving them a hard time."
Natasha arched her eyebrows at the last comment he'd made. If anyone understood how he felt it was her. The only reason she was born was to become an assassin with absolutely no emotion. So is to never get attached and potentially fail a mission. That was her entire purpose in life, to serve. For once she was beginning to feel exactly the way he was describing. Like she belonged and wasn't just a battle ready pawn. Perhaps she was regaining what little emotion she had left.
His dizziness lingered alongside the exhaustion frightened him still. The look in his eyes could tell it all, constantly dilating darting in between lucid and awake. He could only pray for rest but he wasn't so sure God would be willing to allow him even that. He allowed his eyes to slide shut, best to not focus on anything in particular.
Steve's expression tightened when he knelt down to pick up the broken man. As he worked his hand behind his neck he felt how cold he had gotten. His skin was like ice and extremely pale compared to his usual tan complexion, he'd lost so much blood it was no wonder. He knew he had to hurry if there was any chance of saving him. He worked his other arm under his legs and gently hoisted him up. He leant his head up against his shoulder, him nuzzling just in the crook of Steve's neck. Tony seeming to swoon as Steve cradled him in his arms. Steve was so gentle every move he made was so subtle and well calculated. He could run all the way down the stairs right now and never disturb him, but he refused to take the chance.
The opposite of himself he took everything seriously, except when under the influence. To him it wasn't his problem per say and there were many able minded people in the room that wouldn't mind handling the nuisance. After all he wasn't much of a drinker and Natasha considered him much of a light weight. In truth he would rather stay sharp than dull his senses so he stayed away from booze. But this being a special occasion he made an exception. Thanks of all the years of training he'd been through, he was well able to bring himself down when it was needed. Almost like a self-sober up, he liked to think of it as like a type of ninja focus move he'd come up with but in reality that was redundant.
Steve felt useless standing idly to the side while the professionals did their thing. He eyed his friend coping with his fate. He does manage to catch a glimpse of the arc reactor imbedded in his chest; although vague he could see the scar tissue coiled around it. Given the bulk of the device he couldn't imagine it sunk into someone's sternum. It was set deeper than he thought possible. From the other model it was of pretty considerate size and the fact that it was near flush with his chest spoke volumes.
"Oh no.. We need to hurry! Lift his head up a bit more. It must have punctured his lung. It's filling up with blood!" Bruce quickly deducted as Steve began cutting his suit open from the bottom up, quickly and cautiously as he could manage. But it seemed with every squeeze down on the handle brought with it a flurry of pain.
"At ease Capsicle," Tony said half assing a salute. He flipped his face plate up and flashed one of his trademark cheesy smiles paired with a set of bloodshot glassy eyes. Steve's own smile melted into more of a scowl. He hated the nickname Tony made for his supposed superior; it was a little degrading to him, somewhat of a cruel reminder of being frozen in a hunk of ice for more or less 70 years. But he knew it was just a lighter way to think of his past, which in after a while he could actually look back on and laugh. It was almost like a form of closure however childish it was.
The blue tinge of my arc reactor slowly blinked on. Like someone hitting the switch to a light in an old abandoned building. They couldn't have been happier once it finally flicked back to life. I jerked awake at the roar of an angry green giant standing over me. I don't know where I am. Oh I remember. Alien attack. Falling from the sky. Surrounded by people dressed in costumes. I remember now. I almost died. Almost.
Tony looked so defeated. His eyes fixated out the window as they stuck him over again with the needle tugging his flesh tight again. Within minutes his wound was resealed, it was clotting so at least the bleeding has stopped. With assistance they rebound his incision tight with clean bandages. Carefully they rolled him back onto his back his brows taught in discomfort but still managing.
"You need to relax now Tony and try to get some rest." The man in bed was hardly able to keep his eyes open, his vision fading once again. Steve caught Tony and gently laid him back in his bed, his head heavily sinking into the soft pillows. His breath was slow and shallow and his bandages were a tinged a little redder than he'd originally anticipated. This made Steve a little nervous as he watched the other drift off. "Steve I can't," He barley let out as a whisper before there was a knock at the door.
He must have been about 100 yard away from the missile by this point although it was coming in pretty fast it was still far from the city. Maybe less than five minutes or so before it would actually hit anything. Tony glanced around the area for a second and figured this would be the best place if any to detonate the projectile. It was nowhere near anything that would take on damage; it was being far enough away. Right outside the city just before it could be met with any sort of skyscraper.
He snapped back to reality before the man even noticed he was completely out of it for a moment. A drew a now faker smile on his lips as he worked to push the nagging uneasiness into the back of his mind. He took in a deep breath, well as deep as he could manage without hurling over or becoming comatose out of the stress put on his body.
Tony had a tendency to brush off any sort of uneasiness, especially health wise. He hated doctors. Anyways he just figured he must have been hungry or something, I mean when in doubt food is the answer. After all, blowing up missiles and saving the day once again could work up quite an appetite.
"It's the least I can do for guys, I don't know what happened but I'm glad I could do everything in my power to save Mr. Stark. You boys are Heroes." Shelton said as he crammed his hands in his pockets. Bruce stood from his seat and silently thanked the man as well.
"We're done here for now, can you guy's clean up while I got inform his friends of the situation. We need to run some tests real quick before we transport him to a room." The doctor said removing his blue latex gloves that were covered entirely in blood. Some of the nurses check his blood pressure real quick and cleaned him up. They bandaged him thickly in gaze to prevent the stitches from being loosened if he rustled around or was being transported. Once they finished lifted him up carefully and placed him on a gurney to be moved.
"Bruce is fine thanks," he replied with a chuckle. It was nice to be thanked for once rather than blamed. It made him feel good about himself. Saving lives and being able to have a conversation with one of the survivors. Made him feel a kind of warmth deep down, a way better feeling than the fiery burning sensation of anger, he liked praise. "If you want to thank anyone for that feat you'd have to talk with him," he said throwing his thumb up behind him. "He's a true Hero. He distracted that abomination long enough for me to; as you say pummel it into the ground."
That's why he always had the deep seeded urge to be the center of attention since he never received it growing up. This time however he wasn't in the mood for attention even though everyone was giving it. It had been a long time since someone showed real concern for him that wasn't political. It was an odd feeling but he could tell the Steve really meant what he said. You could tell by the way he carried himself and the tone in his voice that there was something he'd lived through that still haunted him. Perhaps Tony was too quick to judge him; he truly was one in a million. An honest, caring, and misunderstood soldier that wasn't the show boat he'd grew up believing him to be.
"Feels like Bruce got angry and wailed on me.. Head hurts.." He said with what little breath he had, straining every few syllables. "But it's ok.." With those last words he slowly started drifting, his body was steadily getting heavier and he was slipping. Steve felt the shift in weight on his shoulder and knew Tony needed to lie back down and rest. He should have stayed there to begin with but it couldn't be helped. He wasn't ok but he was too innocent to know any better. Surly he hadn't gone through anything quite as serious as this. Even if you counted his unfortunate stay in Afghanistan, this was not to be taken lightly.
The shard was of significant size, about eight inches long and looked as if it was chiseled into a spear like projectile. Someone had planted it in the missile just hoping that one of them would take the bait. Which had happened, Steve didn't pay much attention to the object once he dislodged it from his friends' body. He couldn't care less where it came from as he slid the object away, more worried about Tony at the moment. He moved closer to him his hands coated heavily in blood.
If anything the ones who remotely registered his words gave him a dirty look for not taking the situation at least half seriously, being a Shield agent and all. Natasha was especially disappointed but if anybody knew him it was her. It was never wise to give him too much to drink this is how he got after one too many. I mean it started out as a celebration after all. Unfortunately that didn't change the way Natasha thought about it."Really Clint.. You pick now to make a lame ass joke..." She said judging her friend and coworker.
Clint shaped up real quick once everything suddenly became serious and sent one of them to the hospital in critical condition. All because he was way over his head and figured he could handle something so easily. In retrospect he probably could of but given the circumstances as well being oblivious to the extra surprise hidden within the initial attack. To make matters worse he was too out of it to avoid it or even notice what had happened until it was too late. This was so typical, inexperienced people dealing with serious situations so carelessly simply because of their ego.
"Before we can remove that shard we need to get him out of that armor. I don't want to risk the extra resistance. It'll cause more harm than good, by that I mean unnecessary damage to his body." Steve being the one with tactical medical training from his army days knew the effect of not being properly prepared for serious injuries like this. Tony just stared blankly back at him as he barked orders.
They've drank together, joked together, and fought alongside each other for the sake of everyone on this defenseless little planet he's grown to love; to make matters worse the common enemy was his troublesome brother. They could have executed him right when they caught him but they were kind enough to let him go back where he belonged. They didn't have to do that and for their generosity he would be indebted to them. But even so he didn't want to see him die in such a pitiful state after celebrating such a glorious victory.
"Clint you've got eyes in the sky. Keep a look out for anything suspicious and make sure Jarvis stays online, I have a feeling someone is planning something." Steve ordered the others. Making sure the situation stayed under control and didn't get any worst. However it was that sent the first threat took advantage of their defenses being lowered and well as their initially raise spirits.
He smiled at the thought of her. 'Before I leave again I promise I'll make sure to come see you Jane, I'm sure your worried when you shouldn't be.' He said silently to himself as he took a deep breath and sighed, remembering where he was at the moment. It was easy to get lost in thought when distracted by the natural beauty of the sky over the huge city.
"I had a feeling but I had to be sure. What is the rarest substance on the planet doing hidden in a missile?" She said out loud placing a hand under her chin out of confusion, although she knew the answer to that question as well. Just not wanting to come to that conclusion just yet, one thing she could never be was clueless. Clint was the same way most of the time.
Tony figured rather than to have a huge monument located in the center of New York with his name plastered on the front if it. It would be put to better use as the head quarters for the newly form team of misfits. Or in his words a playhouse for the super wanna be hero freaks. The world however will soon know them as the Avengers.
It's funny, his whole life he'd been looked up to as the son of the king and one of the strongest. All of his friends were fighters like him, but it felt a little bland at times with them. The same old thing every day, an all out brawl followed by an over the top feast. He wasn't saying he was sick of his long times friends, it's just it's nice to meet new people, some of which who were so diverse and interesting. This was the place he'd met Jane after all, the most wonderful women he had laid eyes on. She was so beautiful and intelligent, not a very common combination in Asgard. In his eyes she was perfect, not a care in the world and so innocent. He would have never imagined himself falling for a woman with absolutely no battle experience who would never harm a fly.
"Yes Jarvis." His creator replied calmly before taking a swig of fresh bitter alcohol. As it slid down his throat as an icy river yet still burning ever inch it traveled down into his system. It caused slight shivers to run up and down his spine, this was the feeling he loved from the burning to the tingling sensations. It was a plus to the real reason he drank and after a while he'd learned to love all of its effects. Well except for the morning after hangover.
"Although we haven't known each other very long you're still my friend. We protect our own and I wasn't just about to let you bleed out and die on your own floor. I know you're strong and well able to handle yourself; you've done it way before knowing any of us. But we're a team and we do care for you. We're friends now Tony, whether you like it not I'm going to have your back."
I am still again. Broken. I think I am home but I cannot see anything. I am heavy and I can't breathe. Frozen. Am I back in the void? No, I can see Pepper crying. I hear the muffled sobs that refuse to be contained behind a pair of soft hands. And Rhodey with that blank almost dead look in his eyes. This must be what it's like when you die. Others around you suffer. I'd hate to believe that anyone really cared that much. Most only look out for their best interests. Or at least it would be easier if they did.
"Why'd you come back?" Tony spoke suddenly catching Steve off guard.
"The ambulance is here!" Clint said rushing through the side doors over to the others.
"Why thank you my sweet prince in green. How about you Captain, ready for another drink? I'll make you one if you want." Tony tilted his drink towards the blond sitting on the couch before taking a sip. "I make a mean daiquiri. Any flavor you want."
"You're welcome little birdie." He retorted with a hint of sarcasm. "I'll just go out there real quick and blast it before it gets any closer." Tony said before activating a few switches, in seconds pieces of armor were being lowered from hidden places in the ceiling. The robotic arms very carefully set and locked every piece into place, which was extremely useful when you were to the point of intoxication where you couldn't even be able put on a pair of pants even if you wanted to. Bruce walked over his arms crossed until he placed one of his hands on the newly hyped mans shoulder, before it became covered in a thick shell of metal. Tony glanced back to the man, glassy eyed but way more serious and alert.
"Do what you wanna do. It's none of my business. Just enjoy yourself if that makes you happy." Bruce grumbled thinking the man was too high up on his ego and just tap dancing on his nerves. Probably not a good idea but Tony just loved to push other people's buttons to see how far he could get away with it, even if he wasn't exactly the right person to be doing it to. But hey he's drunk right, that means everybody's a target.
"Not again," Steve said silently to himself. "I can't lose anyone else." He continued to pace back and forth; the lobby couldn't have been anymore baron, just the two of them and the receptionist until they were moved to a more private waiting room that was meant for families. It was just him and Bruce waited for any word regarding Tony's condition other than the ones waiting at the tower, they were alone. Bruce remained quiet, only an occasional sigh escaped threw his fingers. He sat hunched over in his chair, his face nuzzled in his hands, deep in thought. He never really vented his feelings to anyone instead he'd rather contemplate quietly to himself.
"Oh the Incredible Hulk is telling me when I've hit my limit," Tony said jokingly as he began to shake his mixer containing God knows what. The look on the other face however was in distaste. Tony was already hard to deal with sober. Damn near impossible when he's drunk. Whenever he did get that way he had a habit of joking around more than usual. His favorite activity to date as far was poking fun at Banner. Up until he could provoke a reaction out of him. Being he could keep his emotions so well in tact after all. It wasn't such an easy task but it still entertained Tony to try.
His head pounded against the side of his skull blocking out all of the surrounding noise. All he could hear was the muffled footsteps of his teammates as they rushed over to him. The ones who were already at his side were immediately to his aid. Calling out to him in order to find out what was instigating his affliction, but they seemed as only distant echoes to him, too far away to recognize. He started to cough feeling something wet begin to run down his chin. Through his hazy vision he started seeing dark spots forming on the floor in front of him.
His last comment struck something in Tony and caused him to soften his expression. In a way he sensed how much that comment hurt the supposedly impervious super soldier. The only two people in his life that he showed real emotion towards. That truly cared for him and not afraid to show it was his best friend Pepper and Jarvis who was nothing more than a computer now. I suppose Rhodey could be thrown in that equation as well but their friendship was a little different than the one he had with Pepper. To Tony she was always there since the beginning, she was like the sister he never had who always nagged him about doing something stupid and occasionally scolding him for embarrassing her.
Steve and Bruce entered the dark room. After being in such a horrible state he finally looked peaceful even if he still wasn't flushed with his usual tan color. From his stomach to his chest was bound in thick bandages tinged slightly since first being set. His left arm attached to a blood bag as well as an IV. He was unconscious and hooked up to all sorts of different machines, the duo hated to see him this way. It was pitiful and weak, the complete opposite of what Tony stood for.
After a short period of time light snoring could be heard from the other side of Natasha. Bruce fell asleep with his head resting on his palm, similar to when they were back at the hospital. The two who remained conscious looked over to the source and simultaneously chuckled at the sight. Drool was running down his forearm which made it harder for them to contain their laughter. At risk of waking the demigod to his left Steve remained silent, Nat did the same.
"Hey it's not so bad. We're all a bunch of freaks here and besides you've somehow managed to learn how to control the shift. You're a hero now not a monster you helped save the lives of hundreds of people. Hell maybe even the whole planet from that power hungry god." Steve finished his sentence as if someone had dripped a bitter poison on his tongue.
Thor came along side of him carrying one of the couch pillows. It was best to keep his head elevated, from the looks of it the shard might of hit something vital. He slid it gently up underneath the others head and knelt down next to the scientist. The two carefully removed each piece.
"The smell. Just a lot of mixed feelings that come with it." Tony put an arm around Steve's shoulders, urging him to go on. "Buck and I, we would stand outside the five cent stores and listen to the game on the radio. We couldn't get too close though, 'cause of my asthma. A lot of workers would smoke while listening to the game, so if I got too close I'd have a coughing fit. Sometimes when I wasn't feeling too good, I'd sit on the curb and Buck would go listen and rush back to tell me when they scored." He chuckled through a sob, and Tony squeezed his shoulder. "Then when I found Bucky, after they....after Red Skull got him. Old Gold was a big company and so they had a camp that processed prisoners of war. That's where we took him, and all the other soldiers. He was really out of it. The smell just reminds me of that day we spent at that camp. The only time I'd ever smoked one of these. Waiting for the doctors to work with him. I knew he would be fine, physically. But mentally...I didn't know if he would be okay. He was my best friend and now he's gone, and now everyone's gone. Everyone, Tony.
The next day, Tony was laying down on the couch, waiting for Steve to come back from showering. Natasha walked in with a hot mug and eyed Tony, until he looked up at her.
So he
to rub this in Rhodes’ face.” She quickly pulled out her phone and started texting as Tony shook his head.
"So?" Tony shoulder-bumped Steve on their way out, back to the car. "Was that as horrible as you imagined?"
“That wasn’t too bad, right?” Sam breathed a sigh of relief. “I thought for sure Fred from KPIN News was going to crucify us up there, but he was chill enough. I love his Rowdy sports Recap segment.”
“You...You’re not Tony.” He quietly put together.
"I...I wasn't spying on you or anything" Tony rushed his words. "It's just that you have the same kind of phone I have, and Jarvis uses it to monitor your health condition, you know in case he needs to call for emergency help. He doesn't keep data of it, it's not like I'm using your vitals for anything. And well, he tried to bring you down himself but he said you weren't responding so he patched me through. I should've told you sooner but I didn't think about it, I'm sorry."
"I meant, uh...a kid. You ever wanted one?" Steve turned bright red and looked away, towards the big screen on the field, trying to act casual about such a probing question.
.” Steve explained.
"You mean you didn't spend the night in my - er, in Tony's penthouse that night?"
Tony spun around, slamming the notebook on the control panel face-down. He hadn’t heard anyone come in. It was Steve. Fuck. Of
"Let's go to that rooftop terrace."
“How what happened?” Wanda asked, but Tony ignored her and marched right up to Steve.
Tony held out a hand, and Steve took it. He didn't need to say anything else, Tony leaned on his shoulder, closing his eyes, letting out a contented sigh when Steve carefully set his other hand above Tony's hip, pulling him in closer, swaying them to the gentle melody. The song wasn't very long, but it felt blissfully eternal.
“Who did you set up?” Wanda asked as she and Vision joined the group.
"Well hello to you too, Tony." Pepper placed her briefcase down on the common room table.
You could hear a pin drop. Steve uncrossed his arms and stood at parade rest, puffing out his chest, the American flag pin on his lapel catching in the light.
“Good.” Tony turned back to the city. It was shining, full of life, full of promise. “Good.”
"No," Steve pulled up some swim trunks with a Captain America shield plastered on the crotch. "We'll pick each other's swim trunks to hang out in the room's hot tub until lunch!"
"I'm sure I won't." Steve fondly smiled at Tony, who was so excited that he was talking with his mouth full. Before he knew what he was doing, he reached over and brushed a crumb off right next to Tony's mouth. Tony froze and stared at him.
a favor by getting a bunch of those tight shirts and pants that everyone was wearing nowadays.
"No need. I've got this." Steve nodded at Pepper, who was waiting for him outside. "Wish me luck."
I miss
He found some more of Other-Tony’s projects by the deep space telescope. They looked interesting - apparently he was aiming for something called a jump-point. But as much as Tony wanted to copy the notes down, he needed to finish his star observations before the morning sun made it too bright to see anything.
"Yeah." Steve blushed. "You remind me of a tornado sometimes, flying in and out of places, leaving everything in chaos behind you."
the one who paid for all the attorneys that kicked Ross out of the picture.
All in all, Steve figured there were many, many others who'd had a much harder lot in life than he did. So he felt it would do those soldiers justice to go visit these cities, even if it was decades later, to see how the people of America were doing now. There was no use fighting for your country if you didn't even know it or its people.
"So whatcha got in the bag?" Steve leaned in, pretending to be curious about the bag on the other side of Tony's chair. He reached over only to have his hand slapped away playfully.
When he got back to his room, he got ready for bed, changed his passwords like Jarvis had suggested, and climbed under his blankets. He smiled to himself as his eyes dropped shut on their own accord. Today really had been a good day after all. It was the fastest he fell asleep since getting to New York.
." Steve grinned, lowering his head a little so he could meet Tony's eyes again. When he did, he saw a little glimmer of hope in there. "I think it's actually impossible for me to lie. You can count on me, I won't let you down, Tony. Not now, not ever. You're my family now."
He also learned from chatting with the construction crew that a large part of it all was thanks to Tony Stark. Not only did Tony fund a lot of the rebuild, he was also constantly emerging from his lab with easier and faster ways to complete the work that Steve thought would be insurmountable just a few days ago.
Steve felt.... something. Like homesickness. He realized that he hadn't really hugged anyone since coming out of the ice. He couldn't remember the last time he held someone before that, even. He felt Tony squeeze back, finally, and decided to take a small risk.
Luckily, as soon as Tony got to talking again, he was impossible to stop, and Steve was grateful for that. While they had their lunch, they talked about all the places Steve visited, he showed Tony pictures and they talked about all the other places he had yet to see. Tony was so knowledgeable, it seemed like he'd been everywhere in the world. Soon, they sat back in their chairs, stuffed.
A heavy thud on his front door pulled him out of those thoughts.
“So, you think he likes you?” Tony kicked his legs out in front of him like he was asking Steve to dish on a cute boy at a sleepover. “You certainly like
Tony was still dumbfounded by their extremely cavalier attitude about all this, but Steve was apparently unaffected.
After his multiple death scares, after Ultron, after everything, he really thought he was a changed man, but right now, all he wanted was Steve. To be his, and for him to be Tony’s. For things to be easy between them again. He was tired of the fighting, of the sneaking around, of the constant war. Tony couldn’t help his rage, couldn’t help but be selfish.
Before Thor took Loki back to Asgard, Tony had pulled all the Avengers aside, and asked if they wanted to stay at the tower.
After realizing he wasn't going to get anywhere with his packing today, he decided to go for a walk. His walk eventually turned into a jog, which turned into punching bag after punching bag in the gym.
a shareholder though." Tony fumbled to pull up another hologram screen. "I gave all of you- the Avengers- company stock when you moved in, in case of an emergency, or if I was ever cut out...so you have every right to be there... Pepper could add you to the docket...in fact if I bring in the Avengers to help build it as a charitable contribution you could even be a consultant at that point...those hounds won't say no to a big tax deduction like that...even Williams with his big fat balding head couldn't say no to SHIELD level security..."
"Me, dumbass." Natasha smiled. "You're such a goner. Come find me if you need pointers to seal the deal, yeah?" She tapped his shoulder and left him standing dumbfounded in the middle of a hallway. He hoped he wasn't as transparent as she made him out to be.
Crap, he’d hoped he could avoid seeing anyone on today’s mission. That’s why he chose the middle of the night on a Sunday, hoping most of the tower’s residents would sleep in. He didn’t exactly feel like explaining dimensional travel to the team, and he didn’t want to waste time with distractions when he had more than enough experiments to work on while here.
Then Tony was gone. Steve turned around and headed back to the party, trying his best to keep a big smile on his face when he walked in.
"Really?" Tony grinned, "That's great news! I knew you had it in ya, Winghead. You 'oughta look into being a professional diplomat if you can handle
Steve did. It had been one of the bigger blows about the future. His all time favorite team of his all time favorite pastime had been moved to another city. On the
"I mean, it
“Not at all.” Tony took his hand and squeezed it. “I’m sure your Tony realized by now that our universes are different and left me a copy of his notes. Plus, I didn’t bring any equipment with me. Oh, speaking of which, here’s your phone.” Tony was starting to hand the phone back when he thought better of it. “Actually-” He turned on the camera and wrapped an arm around Steve’s neck, giving him a big smooch on the cheek and snapping a quick photo of the two of them. He handed the phone back. “There. Something to remember me by. So you don’t forget that someone out there loves you.” Steve took back the phone and stared at the picture, the loud whir of the portal powering up was drowned out by the roar in his ears as he tried to hold back his tears.
“Hey, has anyone seen Tony?” He asked no one in particular. Wanda and Vision were huddled together in one corner, Wanda shook her head and went back to their conversation. Sam and Bucky motioned for him to come sit with them, but Steve waved and went to check the cockpit, in case Tony was up there. Instead, Natasha and Clint swiveled around from their pilot’s seats.
"You're really good." Tony flipped through the pad while Steve took a break to stretch his hands. "If you ever wanna retire from the superhero business, I bet you'd make a great starving artist."
He wiped his hands with a couple paper towels and started undoing his shirt and took it off, figuring it would make him feel a little better not wearing his team mate. Lucky for him he had on an undershirt, that way he wouldn't be bare chested in a hospital. He balled up his once blue shirt and looked back at himself in the mirror and sighed. "Come on Stark.. Don't you die on us.."
"Someone will be checking on you within the hour. Just get some rest." With that he disappeared through the door.
The open wound in his side was bleeding way more now. Especially after what little cough Tony could manage, it seemed to explode with dark liquid. Bruce briskly ran to the kitchen and grabbed a clean dish towel, folded it and handed it to Steve who placed it over the wound and pressed firmly down on it. Tony panted lightly and winced at the applied pressure. He was riddled in sweat and the back of his neck was all wet. She brushed the hair off of his face as delicately as she could as if the man would shatter any minute. Bruce knelt down the opposite of Steve and waited, not able to pry his eyes away from Tony's pathetic state. Now all they could really do now was to wait for help to arrive.
Steve looked up at the other in the bar and shook his head. "I'm fine. I'll just stick to beer, can't get drunk anyway so no big deal." He'd been unnaturally quiet all day and Tony was about desperate to get anything out of him, even a chuckle would be nice. Being a downer doesn't suit him well, from all he's heard he should be the light of the party. Telling an old war story or something, it's weird seeing him so quiet almost like he's lost or something.
Thor looked at the two utterly confused until he looked up what was displayed up on the big television screen."What's this all about?" He blurted out in confusion, not used to such technology conveying such intricate pictures as well as the numbers that go with it. He looked at the other two in the room, the spider women burying her face in her folded arms and the bowman starring at the ceiling with his arms behind his head. Thor arched an eye brow and walked over to the couch, setting his hammer down on the table and sitting across from the other man. He cupped his hands in his lap, waiting for some kind of answer that would be more satisfying than the one he would have to come up with on his own.
He leaned in close, studying the others pained face. He felt his forehead with his knuckles and noticed the difference in temperature. Tony leaned into his hand as his breathing became more erratic. He narrowed his brows. His temperature was rising and showing signs of fever.
The duo walked over to the center of the gravel roof top and sat down next to each other to watch and wait. The beams of light from his thrusters slowly began to blend with the sky as Tony went out to greet the smoke exhausting missile sent by an unknown alias. He seemed like more of a streak of blinding color with a red speck tip. If you didn't know what you were looking for you would simply think of it as a passing jet or something rather than a one person suit. Although after the crazy things that have been happening around here lately, people would begin to think otherwise.
Tony was probably the only person that would never make a mistake on the job even while intoxicated. He was just that brilliant sometimes even if didn't have very much self control and the remainder of the time he acted like a self loathing jackass. The others had to admit after that day the Earth was attacked he'd strive to make a bit of a change. Even if it was a small change he would eventually catch on. They could only hope so.
After what seemed like hours of torture to Tony had ceased within minutes. With every cut Steve made, came paired along with it a grunt or a wheeze by the man. Every jolt of pain was hard but manageable at least for someone like Tony. Alas he was far from out of the woods. It was time to move on to the glistening steak that was still sticking out of him, which would be way harder to remove. Even when compared to splitting open indestructible armor.
"It's no problem really. I've dealt with worse. Sure beats the hell out of bed pan duty." Hector said unable to keep himself from chuckling. Tony smiled, refraining himself from anymore unnecessary movement. In this case laughter was not the best medicine. After a few carefully calculated scrubs the mess was gone, almost like it never happened.
His heart began to race yet again as his eyes widened at the sight. Blood ran from his palm down the length of his wrist. He couldn't help but think the worst. That maybe his dream was a warning of his imitate demise. He needed to know where the others were. He needed to see them.
"Tony, this is gonna suck really bad. So here bite down on this." Bruce rolled a small clean towel into a neat roll and placed it between the man's teeth. Without hesitation he clenched onto it and nearly bit threw it, bracing himself for the worst part. The other lightly set his hands on his shoulders to keep him still.
"It's no problem; I thank you for taking your job seriously. That's my friend back there so it means a lot." He smiled at his honesty, then paused for a second to let what the driver said fully register in his head. After a moment he finally realized just exactly what he said which made him hang his head low out of shame. "Wait, you said don't get mad… That means you know who I am don't you.." He sighed out of shame, he hated who he was and after so long of trying to hide just exactly what he was, all those year of secrecy melted away within a few days.
"Hey look at it this way. If the tesseract had never of been stolen you wouldn't have been able to meet this awesome guy." Tony smiled and pointed his thumb at himself.
He approached cautiously this time and waited for some sort of answer. Tony looked at the needle then back at the doctor and managed a small nod. It was enough of course but every little movement brought with it a shudder of pain. No matter how subtle it was it still hurt like hell.
Even so something was bothering him. Although Bruce was playing along it was hard for him to hide his concern. He always felt like he never had or needed anyone to look out for him. He'd always been able to care for himself he had to after what happened to him. After all he had no other choice. Not much in the world could actually harm him. But he liked to watch over others the only ones who he felt actually accepted him for what he was as well as who he was. Not just the monster but as the man. He pictured himself almost as some sort of guardian angel in some ways, probably more of an arc angel in other ways. He narrowed his brows slightly, figuring it wasn't right to joke around about serious matters like that. He'd always had a tendency to jinx things.
“I gotcha, is there anything else?” Natasha shook her head returning only a tired smile.
"Anesthesia" The surgeon shouted over his team as he pulled a pair of latex gloves over his hands. Numerous people were zipping around the room, some of them were prepping Tony for the surgery itself and others were setting up their stations. One of the nurses hustled over with a breathing mask that would replace the little squeeze one they'd used when bringing him in. Another young nurse rushed over to cleaned his arm and set up an IV. A meticulous syringe held delicately between her lips as she finished placing the needle in his vain. She pulled out a piece of tape to hold it in place and removed the syringe from her mouth and injected it into the porous tubing.
He hadn't the slightest idea the state he was in until his vision blurred and he looked through everything around him, blocked out by an insatiable white noise. The only familiar thing he could make out were the distorted sight of his friends with their echoed voices reminding him where he was back at the tower. He hadn’t even realized he’d been hit until collapsing in front of his teammates. All he could think about was how tired he was, it was obvious to everyone else he’d undergone a state of shock.
"Tony you really are drunk off your ass and shouldn't be operating your suit while you're this intoxicated. Ever heard of drunk driving I'm certain flying a tank suit is way worst. What if you crash or hit the wrong button and self destruct or something?" Bruce said sounding angrier than he was meaning to. Although he was nowhere near losing control of himself. He'd had enough of that to last for a week although his tone with more of a combination of seriousness and concern rather than anger.
Steve sighed in his seat, some of the anger and vengeful feeling settled back inside for next time he needed it. Now he needed to focus more on what was around him and he needed a clear head for that. He shifted his look over to Bruce who was hunched over slightly, gripping his pant leg.
Each foot step they took on the marble tile made an eerie echoing sound that bounced off every wall in the lobby. It was too quiet. It made Bruce think of the very same places he used to hide in while on the run not so long ago. It was abandoned and gloomy but it wasn't like it was trashed or anything. It actually gave him a sense of home even when he did look down at the floor. It gnawed at him and reminded him of something he didn't want to think about at the moment.
He pulled his gaze away from the city and looked over to Bruce who had his chin resting on one of his palms with his mouth hanging open and a stream of drool running down his arm which made Steve giggle. He looked comfortable as far as he knew; honestly he could never sleep like that. He sighed and looked up at the digital clock in the corner of the room; it was almost one in the morning. He rubbed his eyes and heard something from behind him. It was light grunting that sounded strangely familiar. He paused for a moment before he realized who was behind him. He looked back to see Tony wincing and slightly moving his head to the side in discomfort.
The driver glanced over for a split second after noticing the sudden change in atmosphere and the tone of the others voice as he spoke those words. "Hey honestly it'd be pretty sad if I didn't know who you were. After all if it wasn't for you, none of us would be here, right? You pummeled that lizard thing into the ground before it could reach the apartment complex live in. I'd have to say I owe you my life Mr. Hulk."
He allowed his head to sink into the pillow his body finally releasing the tension. He let out a shaky exhale as his eyes fixated on the ceiling. His breath evened. It was calm and quite when familiar face finally stepped out of the corner.
Steve stood up for a moment and yawned as he walked towards the window, careful not to disturb either one of his friends. The moon was so beautiful it shined so brightly threw the glass panels and against the tile. New York has come so far since he last saw it; the buildings doubled in size and seemed to cover as much square foot as possible. Everything was so compacted and full of life, such an odd pair. The moon was as bright as the sun tonight, just like the city that never sleeps.
I feel like I am not breathing though there wouldn't be any reason to draw a breath. As if I were in a state of suspended animation. In a way I have a strong sense that I've been left to parish. I refuse, especially not in the dark lonely place. I am determined to find a way out and help the others. Alas I cannot move. But I must find a way out of here. I am needed back home.
"Jarvis can you scan the materials for me and give me the specs." She flipped a few switches that were hidden underneath the table. The flat surface opened up to show a shallow divot like a sink that was lined with a reflective material. She set the item carefully in the vat and a gridded blue light shined over the top of it, reflecting off the metal and glistening with the reminisce of blood.
He opened his eyes again lying on the ceiling fan idly spinning above him. He was still remembering bit from the day prior. With Steve’s help he was sure he could fill the gaps in his memory. He didn’t get a good look at the metal shard while he was bleeding out. His curiosity peaked.
Tony's eyes were wide and seemed permanently fixated on the ceiling. Natasha continued to hold his head but his sight never appeared to shift; almost like he was having an inward struggle with in consciousness at the moment. The blood engulfed the small area once there was no longer anything stopping the flow.
He looked up for a moment before he finally answered. "Can you take us to the Stark Tower please; it's urgent." The driver glanced at Steve in his rearview mirror as he spoke, his eyes shifting and settling on the man next to his right. He remained quiet and almost over of place until he looked up for a brief second back at him in the little strip of reflective glass. He could see bright glowing green eyes peek out from underneath his dark curls, menacing and full of a mixture of hurt and confusion.
"Oh its nothing, it's just so many things have changed all at once. It's a little overwhelming or at least for me it is. I went from helping sick families in a Third World country where no one had no idea who or what I was, to being recruited by the very people I've spent most of my days trying to avoid. Then to turn into the other guy that I've been keeping locked up for so long out of the safety for other people but this it was the exact opposite. But in the end it really didn't even matter now did it." Bruce said sulking in his seat a little bit.
Even now his stomach twisted full with tension of the unknown. Who'd planted that metal? Why would someone use a shard of vibranium set as a deliberate trap? What's keeping them from coming back? To not know what might happen while no one is there to protect him. His eyes darkened eloped in grief.
“Steve before you go, I managed to get a hold of Pepper shortly after you guys got back. I didn’t tell her all the details just that there was an accident, but he’s out of surgery, safe and resting.” Nat didn’t have the heart to tell the poor girl everything over the phone. After the scare with that portal she felt inclined to stay closer to Tony. She’d come this close to losing him again, especially after he’d promised to stay home and out of trouble, convincing her to go on the business trip to Tokyo enjoy herself.
“If you want me to be honest, I feel like I'm just above water and there’s weights tied to my ankles dragging me down. My chest feels like it's going to exposed under the pressure and every time I go to sleep I feel like I'm suffocating.”
