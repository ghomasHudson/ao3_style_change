“They’re my family now, I think.” Peter had taken a seat at the grave. He spoke as if he were having a conversation, smiling at the stone gently.
While the reality was still that he was a prisoner, there were things that had started to become skewed in his brain. No one had ever taken care of Tony like the two men, doting on him and making sure his health was up to par. He rarely worked through a meal, and had a sleeping schedule that he’d never taken on before. His body, while having lost some of the muscle, had grown healthy and content with the new regime.
He couldn’t stop the laugh, Loki was one tricky bastard. The god had easily conceded to the soldier’s request, but he had not completely changed the girl, no, woman in front of him.
“I’ll grab the first aid kit!” Steve was already on his feet, looking absolutely concerned for the boy as he all but sprinted from the table to grab the item.
Tony raised a brow, looking between the bundle of energy in his lap and the sugar bomb nearby. There was absolutely no way he was going to let the little boy eat the cake. Peter as a teenager was beyond energetic, he didn’t want to think what Peter as a toddler would be like with sugar in his system.
“Jarvis!” He’d made to move forward, but was stopped by a hand dropping on his shoulder. Before he could turn to face the owner, he heard Peter release what sounded like a battle cry before the kid had soundly kicked Steve across the room and into the green monster.
Suddenly, everything made sense. The promise, the desperation, the items being moved for stock. It all made sense, and Peter wasn’t happy with it.
“Is there even a television here?” Tony raised a brow, looking at the room where everything pointed at a fireplace, no screen to be seen.
Without the mug the tremors in his hands didn’t go unnoticed, but he soldiered on, knowing that if he didn’t get the words out he may never do it. “You take the kid, you take Rhodey, May, and Happy, and you keep them safe. I…. I’m almost positive that if they get their hands on any of you, they’ll use you against me.”
The blond reared back like he’d been struck, but it lasted for only a moment before the hand tightened again. Tony refused to cry out, glaring daggers at the man above him even as he felt the dampness of blood on his wrist, the stitches likely undone.
In what appeared to be a caring motion, Bucky reached forward and scooped both up without a second’s hesitation while Steve pulled back the covers to arrange them over the pair when they were set down.
She reached down and pulled his palm up, ripping the glove off his hand roughly as she held it eye level.
Tony returned the smile with a fond expression before he wheeled himself into the bathroom, watching as Jarvis slid the door closed behind him. He couldn’t hide the fact that he felt warm from their attention and care, it wasn’t something he’d had growing up.
“Don’t touch another hair on my kid’s head then,” Tony countered. “The only three people who know how to run the suit are me, Rhodey, and Peter. I’ll get out of it, he’ll get in it and leave. That simple. I’m not exactly in a state to fight, if you can’t tell. I won’t bring any people with me.”
“Peter apparently got Clint to promise a barbecue today. Bruce is making the side dishes, but it may take another hour before we’re ready. I wanted to see if you wanted to help me.”
“Peter,” he murmured, slowly peeling away from Steve’s grip and holding out his arms to take the child from the super soldier. To his relief, Bucky didn’t hesitate in handing over the distraught child so that the quivering brown eyes could bury themselves in Tony’s shirt.
When the sun began to set and indicated that they were hours from being separated once again, T’Challa reappeared. He joined them for dinner alongside Carol.
“Tony!” One of the figures cried in excitement, before pushing from the tree and starting forward. The gold in her hair almost sparkling amongst the brown, hazel eyes bright and happy, all hints of red gone for the moment.
Heart still in his throat, Tony was glad to find that they didn’t so much as attempt to fight him on going into the bathroom alone with the child. They didn’t try to sit in, so that when the door closed and the teenager returned, the man no longer had to pretend.
Unable to stop the blush that bloomed all over his face and down his neck, the genius quickly nodded and tried to not so subtly throw himself forward and out of the man’s hold. Steve’s arm was solid, and he only grinned before tugging the genius towards the table where Bucky was placing Peter into a highchair.
“We watched a show that’s a little too mature for the kiddo,” he reached forward and didn’t wait for permission, running a hand through Peter’s hair. “I don’t think we should be watching those kinds of shows just yet, right Peter?”
With the sedative still working, the blond didn’t notice the full-blown panic in Tony’s eyes. Instead, he focused on lifting the man’s body and settling him into the tub. The water covering them both, although Steve had the thought to place Tony right next to him so that he wasn’t pressed up against the completely naked soldier.
The genius immediately pulled back, frowning as he gazed at the three people in the kitchen. “All of you?”
Bucky laughed, but already he started to remove his own clothing as he set the platter aside, heading straight for the bed. Two pairs of blue eyes looking at Tony with a determination he wasn’t sure he was ready to handle.
A few grunts later, and what sounded like Natasha saying something, and the noise died down substantially.
“Told him about their crimes?” He asked upon seeing that Tony didn’t seem as shaken as they expected. When Steve nodded his head in acknowledgement, the soldier closed the door behind him and ambled to the bed, sitting in the corner.
The revolt had been easy to overthrow, especially when the Russian’s had seen Thor show up with an equally pleased Loki beside him. After some negotiation, they had brought the God back with the promise that he would rule over several Midgardians in exchange of not being completely in power.
He looked back down, armor flying to reveal his face, so he can look at the blue eyes directly. “Please, please let go.”
Rogue had decided that while she appreciated the rebellion and what it stood for, that she had no interest in joining the organization. She claimed that if the time came, she would be on their side, but until then, she wanted to roam.
“No!” Peter cried, throwing himself on top of the pile when Clint made to reach for a piece again. “No! There’s a plan!” He openly glared at Clint, slapping at the man’s hand again.
Taking a moment, she raised her hands and threw her hair into a ponytail. They’d put her in the same sports and baggy clothing that they’d been giving Tony. No jeans or anywhere they could really store things. Just sweats, socks, and a t-shirt.
Before the genius could deny the question, his stomach decided to complain rather loudly. The blush of embarrassment spread all the way from his cheeks to the tip of his toes, and Tony had to withhold a groan as the little boy whimpered from behind him.
Peter started whimpering and Steve swiftly escaped Tony's hold and practically sprinted towards their son. Before Thor could react, Steve had removed the now crying Peter from his grasp and was clutching the baby tightly.
It was to this lovely scene that Steve returned home. It warmed his heart to see the three people he loved most in the world all curled up happily together and he knew that Tony would be ok. Or as ok as Tony ever was.
“Of course not, sire.” Minister Ku said to his King with a slight bow of his head. “If you’ll excuse me?”
Tony leaned forward, just enough so that Steve’s fingers finally made their arc along his skin instead of just the air. He felt goosebumps rise all over his body at the contact.
Steve pointed towards the opposite side of the valley from where they were emerging from the trees. Opposite them sat a village nestled at the base of a jutting mountain. Farm land and livestock spilled out into the valley from the cluster of round houses whose foundations could only be distinguished from the rocks of the mountain by their almost black mortar.
"To answer your previous question, I found her. She was abandoned. Actually I was hoping that you could translate something for me." Steve explained with much more patience than Steve thought he was capable of at the moment.
Tony fell back on the bed, resigned to having to share more about himself that he thought he would have to in their marriage.
Tony shot Steve a sharp glare before moving down the hall and knocking gently on the door of the only other occupied room in the tower. Tony could feel the ghosts of the other children he and Steve had dreamed of having dancing at the corners of his mind. He had wanted so much more than this. More for his son. More for his kingdom.
Tony, frustrated by Steve’s continued collectedness, decided that his lover had far too many clothed on. He started kissing his way down Steve’s body, his hands gliding down ahead of his lips. Once Tony’s slightly rough hands found the band of his partner’s now infuriating pajama pants and boxers, he slipped them beneath both pieces of offending fabric and proceeded to remove them. Steve’s hips lifted slightly to allow Tony to more easily remove the clothing. The ex-playboy tossed the clothing over his shoulder carelessly, fully enjoying the view before him with a little smirk.
Peter’s little face contorted into the kind of fury that T’Challa had never seen on a child, and honestly had no desire to ever see again.
“Are you coming, Betrothed?” Steve asked from several paces away from Tony’s horse, hand offered out to him.
Tony continued his assault on his partner’s neck until Steve had finally managed to undo the very last button of the billionaire’s shirt and triumphantly tore the material from his body. Tony chuckled slightly at Steve’s exuberance, clearly he wasn't the only one who’s control was starting to waiver. His smirking mouth slowly made its way up to Steve’s ear. His hot breath made the super soldier shiver underneath him, which only caused Tony’s smirk to grow.
"I'm kidding! KIDDING!" Said Thor, erratically gesturing with the hand that wasn't clutching his young nephew who had been looking back and forth between his father and his uncle in interest.
The baby’s cries were so loud that Steve and Tony could hear it both echoing from the hall and emanating from the electronic device that the younger man was now glaring at. He was silently hoping it would be one of those times when their infant daughter just needed to voice some complaint or another for a minute before falling back asleep. Unfortunately for Tony, it was not one of those times.
Tony let out a husky moan in response to the delicious contact. The Steve’s arousal was evident through his thin pajama pants while Tony’s was still relatively concealed in his now slightly too tight dress pants.
“My King.” Pepper said in her native Gaelic. “We are the representatives of Prince Anthony’s household. We honor you as our new King.”
Steve softened slightly, cause in a way he did see Tony’s point. Even if part of him, the part of him who was still that poor city boy from days long gone who dreamed of fighting for what he believed in, still didn’t fully believe that he was doing everything he should. But that hardly mattered when his partner said those things and made the part of Steve that was more and more becoming a part of the 21st century melt a little. For now, he could let the part of him that still doubted go, just for Tony. He might not fully believe it just yet, but Tony had a way of convincing him about most things and Steve was sure that this would be one of them.
“You don't wike-” Steve immediately clamped his free hand over his mouth, his eyes going wide with shock and embarrassment. Fortunately for Steve, everyone was a little more concerned with Sarah’s behavior than Steve’s unintentional baby talk. “Like. Who do you not like?” Steve recovered quickly.
He looked up in time to see the little blond girl’s almost four year old brother run into the room with a concerned look on his face that made King T’Challa worry about his dutch nephew and how much stress he was already carrying on his tiny shoulders. The worry, however, melted off of the little brunette at the sight of his Uncle.
“I was born on this isle, my King. My father sold me and I was taken to King Anthony’s homelands. There he freed me. I am more loyal to him than to any other person alive or dead.” Pepper said.
The first man to great them was only slightly shorter then Steven was and had his long brown hair tied loosely back. Next to him stood a short red haired women who Tony could immediately tell was another foreigner. She exchanged a nod of solidarity with Tony, two strangers in a land they weren’t born to.
Tony looked down, unable to meet Steve’s eyes any longer, but Steve stopped him. Steve’s fingers lifted Tony’s downturned chin so that he was force to Steve’s eye level.
“Don’t try it” Tony retorted. “I know that you have been thinking that you're useless or not doing enough cause I go off to work everyday while you stay here with our children, and thats bull shit.”
“I’m alive.” Tony whispered so harshly that one would suspect the words of betraying him in the worst possible way.
Tony turned back to his last trunk. He kneeled down and unlatched it. Inside was his blazing red and gold armor. Tony checked it over to ensure that it was none the worse for wear after the long voyage here. Thankfully, it was in the same perfect condition it had been when he had forged it on the mainland. Tony reached in and pulled out his sword. He unsheathed it and took a moment to admire the obsidian colored blade before replacing it in its scabbard. The glowing blue jewels sparked up at him from their places on the hilt as Tony replaced in at the top of the trunk.
A quiet whistle sounded beside the focused man, causing him to jump and glance over the kitchen counter where the light of the fridge illuminated the hunched form of Peter Parker. The teenager slowly stood straight, a piece of cold pizza hanging from his mouth. He’d quickly grown on everyone, and had even started to reference them as family. “Don’t let Mr. Stark hear you talk like that Uncle Rhodey, he may have a conniption.”
It didn’t take long for the two to finish the meal set in front of them. Clint, whom had been watching the two the entire meal, immediately pushed the cake towards the little boy. It seemed as if the man truly wanted to win the love of the child, even it was by means of bribery.
He jumped when a hand ran through his sweaty hair, a voice gently cooing at him that he was alright.
Like a light switch that had suddenly been flipped, the change in demeanor was almost immediate. Peter nodded eagerly with a huge grin on his face as his eyes twinkled brightly. Quietly, the child wondered what Tony would think when he explained what had happened, and how he was quickly getting them to eat out of the palm of his hands.
His fist was trembling, the gift he’d been given unused for so long, he’d almost forgotten about it. Clenching down, he brought it down to his lap and stared ahead for a moment. If using the talent for one night meant getting Carol to go to safety without him, then he’d do it. After all, it wasn’t like he was scared of his own memories… right?
“Hear me out,” he spoke calmly. “Buck and I… we saw this entire world at war. We saw the worst that humanity could do. Human experiments, people attacking people for food or supplies. We saw a world without order, and when we tried to fix it by modern societies rules, it got worse. Now, we don’t have hungry children on the streets.”
“Manners,” Bucky admonished, although he didn’t hesitate to wrap the little boy up again into a nice bundle.
“While there are still several attempts to find you, they have not found any data related to the bunker. I have not scanned databases for today’s conference as I did not want to raise a red flag on their radar. You have nothing to worry about sir,” the A.I. finished.
“How do you always get yourself injured?” Bucky says fondly, carrying Tony back into the large cabin and to a living room that could easily hold a large number of people.
“Hulk smash!” Was roared into the shaking building, just as the green creature slammed the server onto the ground with as much force as he could muster. The lights in the room went berserk, flashing in sparks . Tony screamed, a sound torn from his throat between despair and rage.
At eighteen, Tony was asked to represent Stark Industries on the presentation of the Jericho missile in Afghanistan. James had accompanied him as liaison for the army, and had been helpless to stop the kidnapping of the young CEO.
When Stephen finished, he simply nodded at the three, turned on his heel, and was out the door without speaking a single sentence to the men.
He started to walk away from the king, taking a moment to glance over his shoulder and smile softly. “Thank you, for everything.”
It rang twice before it picked up, and this time the brunette had the projection thrown onto the wall rather than the 3D hologram it was designed to make.
Before the kid could reply Tony hoisted himself to his feet using the hand as leverage. And promptly, the world spun and Peter’s entire body became the only thing holding him up. With a groan he heard an alarmed cry, and felt two arms wrap around his waist and lift him up. He would have panicked, but he recognized Rhodey’s voice coming from the chest where he lay his head.
“Cheeseburger for me, at least two hot dogs for Peter.”  He didn’t bother in fighting to make his own plate, knowing that he would be denied.
Once they arrived in the warehouse, it was evident there was quite a bit of work to do. And while Tony couldn’t do much, he hung around and tried to provide support to the team by chatting and keeping them generally distracted from focusing too hard on their tasks.
Taking the hint, Tony easily spoke, all hints of crying gone from his voice, unwavering. “My kid doesn’t want you in the bathroom!”
“You see, I don’t want to hurt you Tony, neither of us do.” Steve started up again. “But we still need to show you that there are consequences to your childish actions. If you don’t let us take care of you, then how are we going to keep our promise?”
But the ramp was closing, and the plane was lifting from the grass and getting further away from his kid. The genius screamed, his hand coming down and slamming against the metal as he tried desperately to reach his family.
Tony doesn’t jump, he doesn’t! Well, he would never admit to it as his head whips to face the newcomers. The movement is too fast, and the genius immediately sinks into the pillows with a groan, his hand flying to his temple and eyes slamming shut to stop the wave of dizziness that hits.
“What?” The blond seemed surprised, his eyes scanning Tony as if looking for some sort of injury that may have caused the attack. Even Peter had frozen, looking like the world had just fallen on his shoulders as he took in the state of his mentor.
With another bang the metal dented enough that the last rays of the dying sun flooded the warehouse floor. Tony sprung to his feet, unable to be of much use in or out of a suit with his hands in the condition they were in.
Peter, whom enjoying teasing the man, had climbed onto the ceiling and used some of the webbing to cling upside down above the unmoving genius.
And with that the two proceeded to cover the lab with blue foam that took several hours to clean. Not that any of the other bunk mates helped, instead choosing to laugh and walk away.
Tony is gently placed on a very soft cushion, the blanket following to curl up around him as pillows are propped to keep him sitting up. He’d be offended at being treated like a child, if he weren’t grateful for the fact that the props are helping him stay up.
It took a moment, looking into the blue eyes and seeing his own reflection, before Tony nodded. “Yeah… yeah… I’m fine.”
Tony almost sagged in relief, Rogers was no longer paying attention to the struggling prisoner, it meant perhaps that they would just let it go. He looked up to meet the blue eyes of the insane leader of the team, unable to hide the tears that were quickly surfacing from the high emotions of the tense room.
With another shake to the foundation, the door to the lab burst open as the Winter Soldier appeared, looking very much like the murderous man Hydra had originally made him to be. Gone was the spark of joy that Tony had quickly grown to like, replaced by a glint of something so dark that Tony knew he had to get out or he would regret his decision to attempt escaping.
A trunk that had been repurposed as a bench sat at the foot of the bed, a beige cushion making it more comfortable to perch on.
While the king and Carol had disappeared to get things prepared, Tony got to spend a wonderful day reconnecting with his family.
“Really, out of all the music you’d listen to, that’s what you choose?” The voice was snarky and a bit friendly, as if trying to gauge just what kind of mood Tony was in.
“Jesus Barton!” Bucky growled, throwing aside the manual to pluck the hysterical toddler from the panicking man.
“Do you want to bake some cookies for your daddy? We can finish this right after?” He smiled, “they can be part of dinner, or we can put them in your cake.” The last part was said with a less amused tone, eyes narrowed on the grinning archer.
Glad that the child is so close, Tony ambles back to the bedroom.  He’s not surprised to find both Steve and Bucky inside, both already changed for bed. Bucky is resting on the bed, and Steve is flossing his teeth in the bathroom.
He had been on the verge of snapping when Steve had lifted two of the large beams over each arm without so much as a struggle and moved them to where Tony needed. His smug smile when he caught Tony staring with his mouth slightly unhinged made the man want to test the strength of the hammer in his hand.
Moving up as much as Bucky would let him, Tony turned to the archer with a brow raised. He would never admit that he was pouting. “Did you just call me honeybee?”
“Whipped,” the archer coughed into his hand. Tony didn’t bother turning when he heard a fist smack an arm, followed by a startled yelp. Instead, he focuses on going up the stairs and carrying his kid and new cat away from the men. How could he have forgotten, even for a second, that the two men were obsessive and not in love?
For a moment the genius froze, thinking about all the nights where he had to sit with the former group. All the horror movies that had made him cuddle closer to Steve and Bucky, and the odd feeling that it would be strange not having someone to curl him up in their arms during a film.
“The Avengers, they traced the bunker. They know where we are! Tony wasn’t getting stock, he was moving everything out so that we could make a quick get-a-way!” Peter was still shouting, jumping from foot to foot in nervous energy.
THANK YOU FOR THE KUDOS, COMMENTS, AND BOOKMARKS! You guys are absolutely awesome! :) Per usual, I hope this chapter makes sense, I wrote it in one sitting and wanted to get it out here 'cause I'm about to be super busy for like seven days straight. So... enjoy.
“I still don’t understand what the point of this is,” his voice was flat as he stood at the end of the mat, staring blankly between Peter and Rhodey.
She pushed the man to his feet, leading him out of the room with the same gun that had killed his coworker sitting snuggly against his back.
With a sigh she lifted the wrist where her watch rested gently on her skin, holding it out so that Tony could look at it. “Is this going to work?”
Tony didn’t bother to withhold the groan at hearing the same familiar beeping of a heart monitor nearby. Was he in medical again?
Bucky nodded, moving forward to wrap his metal arm around the blonde’s waist. He leaned forward and pressed a firm kiss to Steve’s neck, “we’re not stopping Stevie. And this time, we’re getting the kid too.”
Thor had quickly left the room upon hearing the news of the breakout, vowing to speak to his own people in order to track the man. Loki had followed slowly behind, claiming he wanted to witness if their friend could truly track someone that he could not.
“Dad, look out!” Peter appeared just in time, kicking what appeared to be a liquid filled needle out of the scientists hand and into a nearby wall. The thing shattered, the glass seeming to awaken something in the occupants of the warehouse.
Peter, albeit confused, nodded and started to speak. “Jarvis is Tony’s Artificial Intelligence system. He’s….” It was obvious the boy caught on, an abnormal gasp sounding from the machine. “You’re brilliant!” The kid exclaimed.
Arms pulled him closer to the warmth, and he felt safer than he had in a long time. Tony finally drifted off as the voice promised gently, “we’ll get him for you.”
“Jarvis, Protocol Panther, now.” Tony couldn’t begin to figure out how he’d managed to say the words, barely hearing the affirmation as the ship started to rise, the occupants trying desperately to get to him.
Instantly, Bucky stepped into the water and held out his arms, taking the now slightly struggling man into his hold. He didn’t lower Tony into the water immediately, waiting until Steve was in before the two moved together. They only let the water hit up to Tony’s lower chest, speaking gentle reassurances to the man as they washed him.
He keeps an eye out to make sure that Tony isn’t trying to build a suit or stealing pieces to use in the room, but otherwise, he sits at a table and looks over paperwork.
“Look, let’s not talk about that right now.” Tony finally managed, wheezing only slightly. “What do I have to do to get Peter back you son of a bitch?”
“Mr. Stark,” his voice instantly giving away his German accent. “It’s a pleasure to meet you. I have been waiting for you. We all have, actually.”
Fortunately, or not depending on one’s point of view, everything that had happened was quite exhausting and he was finding himself coming in and out of consciousness. Tony was so caught up in his thoughts he didn’t notice as the bedroom door creaked open, eyes half-lidded.
The king, looking as cool as a cucumber, spoke calmly. “You know I can’t do that Tony. You must calm yourself.”
A silent understanding rang between the two men at that moment. Both understood the struggle the new world had brought with it, and both had universes hanging on their shoulders.
When the food was placed in front of him, Tony waited until Peter had reached for his own part of the meal before eating above the boy, tucking the kid’s head under his chin so that he could eat relatively easily with the kid in his lap. His right arm held his burger while the left wrapped softly around Peter’s waist.
The smile that was already half formed turned bitter, the mug moved up to hide the expression on his face. Leave it to Pepper to catch the phrasing. “I’ve run the numbers all morning with Jarvis. The possibility that you can all get away without me is a lot higher than if you take me with you. Almost eighty-seven percent, if they found the bunker.”
The soldiers had educated themselves with a few classic films, and he was glad that he knew a little bit of the hype that came with the flicks.
The genius moved to struggle, to be set free, but the movement jolted his wound and he let out a pained cry.
He was also teased that he wasn’t the only genius in the warehouse, and that he’d better get ready because the other person was bound to have him on his toes.
Tony barely registers what is happening, his eyes focused past Bucky’s shoulder as he tries to come to terms with his new reality. What had happened? How had they found him? Why was there a sense of foreboding in his gut, like he had forgotten something important? How had they put up an invisible barrier around the house?
After a bit of quiet, Carol looking as if she were deeply considering something, the girl turned to Tony with a very serious expression on her face. He tilted his head, trying to gauge what was about to come out of her mouth.
“How did it end?” Peter asked, tilting his head as he paused after coming back from depositing another box into the craft.
With a curse that would have made his mother blush, Tony threw himself into the suit behind him, barely having the armor close around him when a metal arm tore a piece right off the suit. He threw himself to the right, swinging a fist at his assailant and watching as the Winter Soldier ducked deftly out of the way, holding the armor of his left arm.
Standing slowly, he kept his attention on the man in front of him and hollered to the craft behind him, “go!” He screamed.
“Thank you, but I’m okay Jarvis,” he murmured. “Can you-can you check to make sure no one’s found anything out about the bunker?”
Trying to snap out of it, Tony leaned against the headboard and turned on the television screen. It took five minutes before his eyes fell to the door, hoping that someone would come inside. It was frightening, how being alone for the first time in days left such a heavy feeling in the pit of his stomach.
Immediately he is shushed, “you’re not hurting anyone.” Steve reassures him. “You’re okay honey, you’re okay.”
Taking a second to release a breath that he hadn’t realized he was holding, Tony steeled himself with the age old mantra of being made of iron before sitting on the other end of Steve’s couch.
“Jarvis, I think escape would be good right about now!” He yelled out in a panic, the repulsors on his feet lighting up quickly as they threw him and the suit back.
In seconds, Bucky entered with their new head of tech, looking rather pleased. He smiled as Steve looked up, hope in his eyes.
“Obie did-” Tony cut himself off. He didn’t like to talk about the very man whom he had trusted. The man who had hurt the genius more than the two soldiers could possibly attempt to do.
“I’ll take care of you,” Bucky was quick to jump up, taking the spoon and filling it with soup. He blew on it for a moment to cool it down, and then began to feed Tony like it was an everyday thing. When the man noticed that the genius still held the question of the girl in his eyes, Bucky looked over his shoulder at Steve.
“How long until these are done?” Bucky asks, glancing around at the room where three fourths of the bots are already fixed.
A half hour later, Tony had strewn himself onto the ground of the gym and refused to move. He claimed that they were actually trying to kill him with the amount of exercises they’d pushed him through, and inwardly cursed that he was the only one sweating. The man was fit, but hours upon hours in the lab and his body was no longer used to keeping up with physical exertion.
Stopping in front of a set of double doors, Tony lifted his head to meet that of a softly smiling Steve. A shiver ran down his spine, and he immediately curled closer to the soldier holding him to hide the reaction. It was wrong, for someone so cruel to be able to look so kind.
“Hey sweetheart, how would you feel about helping us with some machines?” Steve leaned forward, setting the sketch pad on the nightstand as he smiled gently.
“I guess I made them a little too strong?” Tony concedes when the rest of the team appears, looking out of breath. His leg is bleeding and he knows that he won’t be able to stand without help. “Whoops?”
“I studied how to make it from some old journals… I hope I did it justice,” Bucky murmurs, breaking through the man’s shock.
“So, what? You’re saying that if someone does something that you don’t like that they can just… walk away?” Tony leaned back on the chair as he had already emptied out his cup of coffee, half the omelet still cooling on the plate.
“Buck, take him and get cleaned up, I’ll take care of Tony.” Steve spoke calmly from behind the genius.
The team had believed it, although Bruce was a consistent presence in the lab. If he was unavailable, someone would hang around to ask questions, or simply to observe and make sure things were going alright.
He’d learned quickly that both men were like furnaces, and that there was no way he would dream of the dark cave in Afghanistan when the warmth chased his nightmares away.
Both soldiers were quiet, as if waiting for him to gather his thoughts and ask whatever questions he may have on his mind.
Bucky only held on tighter, keeping him cradled as he desperately tried to pry himself away, unaware that he was not in the cave of his nightmares. The one that had caused the PTSD.
With a scream that he wasn’t exactly proud of, Tony backpedaled away from the computer monitors directly towards the hole in the wall.
He tried, he really tried to focus on the king. But things were blurring together, and all the fight left him as he was pushed into a pit of despair. Tears started to run down his face, the cool wind of the air brushing them aw- wait.
He threw his hands over his ears, trying to smack the memories back into the correct order. He hated the soldiers, he wasn’t supposed to be there. But they loved him, took care of him, made sure he was well fed and healthy. They watched movies with him, played games, and let him ramble about the bad mechanics of the television.
Taking a moment to catch his breath, he plopped himself into the chair across from Carol and leaned forward. His eyes were panicked, thinking on how he was absolutely growing dependent on the two men, and how the affection only left him feeling warm and not sick.
“It takes time, but we just want to bring order and justice to the world. Like when you stopped making weapons, wasn’t that a similar move?”
When they finally start to build, Bucky carefully reading the instructions and pausing to let Natasha hand Peter the pieces, the child completely ignored the archer nearby.
“Blood loss,” the man explained. “He’ll be fine. Let’s get to the craft and we can set you two up in the back with medical while we get out of here.”
Tony was shaking again, unable to stop the whimpers. He raised a tired hand and tried to paw away at the oxygen mask still tightly clasped over his mouth.
His arm is bleeding, and Tony can barely register that Jarvis has taken over the suit and started to shoot him up into the sky.
The redhead nodded, wrapping her arm around Tony’s shoulder as she leaned back on the sofa. He was still drinking his coffee with both hands.
Just as he begins to question it, Tony slams into a wall. His body careens back into the grass of the front lawn, barely missing the pavement of a round driveway. Looking up to see what he ran into, Tony frowns when he notices that there is nothing in front of him.
Immediately, he turned and found that he couldn’t figure out the emotion swirling in his chest. Was it fear? Joy? A weird mixture of both fought for dominance as the woman approached, her face almost as red as her hair in her rage.
The brunette froze, his body stiffening despite being around a man that he absolutely loved. Abraham Eskrine was the reason Steve still existed. Why Howard had someone to worship as a hero, why Tony was currently in his situation.
“How to get out of here, I have a plan.” She smiled. “A fool proof one, with my powers and the suit you made.”
The action seemed to spur more of a tantrum in the boy, who stumbled from out of the pile and ambled towards the archer. His lack of coordination didn’t help, and instead of crawling up to grab the pieces, Peter fell face first into Clint’s lap.
And thus, Iron Man started to fly on severe missions with the team. Tony was never truly in the suit, operating from afar, and only interacting when he needed to. Thus, they wrote the man off as arrogant, a young billionaire whom had no business fighting beside them. None of the team ever having seen his face.
Tony shoots her a smile, sitting idly in the lab chair as Bruce lingers nearby, in case the genius needs help. Not that he would considering she’s almost half his size.
By the fifth day, Tony quickly learned that the two men seemed to enjoy themselves a bit in his punishments. Bucky had repeated the spanking when Tony had refused to eat breakfast, and Steve had made him watch a snuff film of one of the weapon’s being used on another victim.
So.... that happened. Will Tony finally crack, or pretend to crack? And do I see someone in green in the next chapter? Hm....
Bucky, having disappeared for a moment into the room, returned with a pile of clothes. The two quickly dressing Tony in a pair of boxers, sweatpants, and an old AC/DC t-shirt that Tony would have recognized as his own if he hadn’t been completely out of it.
It would be easy to shoot the data to Wakanda, it would only take minutes, really. In a couple hours, the processing would be complete, and a few buttons would make everyone he loved safe.
He isn’t surprised when another hand reaches forward and moves his away, pressing firmly against the skin as if checking for a temperature. Wearily, Tony blinks his eyes open and finds Steve Rogers looking pleased.
There was a pause in the fight, as Hawkeye and Black Widow stepped back almost as if they were given orders. Tony had taken it as a moment to stumble from his breaking suit into the new one, freezing when he stepped out to come face to face with Steve Rogers himself.
And Tony suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of fear, eyes widening and unable to hold a whimper as the hands on his wrists tightened.
T’Challa and Rhodey had quickly secured the chains to the craft before donning their fighting gear. And while Tony had obviously seen War Machine before, he’d never gotten a chance to peek at the feline based outfit that the king wore. It was amazing, seemingly glowing from an energy he couldn’t begin to identify.
Both of them sauntering from the room, the banter about food trailing behind them as Tony continued to stare blankly ahead.
He was doing his best to eat a sandwich that Peter had whipped up for him, although the hard bandages made him look more like a five-year old, his coordination completely off. At one point, Peter had taken pity on him and wrapped up the bottom so that the insides of the thing would stop falling in his lap.
Soon enough, both Tony and Clint were in full hysterics, Thor (whom had appeared without Loki) had started to release his own contagious laughs that had led to Bruce joining in. Natasha’s lip had curled up, an indication of her amusement. And soon enough the only person looking unamused was Bucky, watching as even Steve started to chuckle with the contagious laughter.
A hand catches his shoulder and keeps him down, but he only yelps and keeps fighting, wanting to get away. Had they tricked him? Were they taking him back to test more weapons on people?
Rhodey began to pace behind the sofa, hands curled into fists as he did his best not to scream. He was glad that Tony had thought to build a gym into the rather large underground facility; he’d have to punch something later.
“Tony?” Bucky’s voice rang from the other side. “Doll? Is everything alright? Can I come in?” He knocked a second time, as if the two hadn’t heart his voice from their lack of immediate reactions.
When the little boy nodded again, the blond soldier leaned back where he sat, Bucky leaning against the bedpost nearby. “Peter, did what happened to your daddy scare you?”
And Carol was smart enough to catch on that they were being watched, because she smiled just as brightly back and nodded her head.
His gaze zeroed in on the king standing a few feet from the office, looking happy and relaxed as if the man hadn’t made the decision to leave a child behind.
Rhodey groaned, stopping his task to throw a fond glare at Tony. “Yes, and they immediately said I would never be anything but your liaison, because no one else wanted to deal with you.”
He hears the end of a laugh as the radio starts again, “he won’t eat you Tones. Don’t worry.” Carol assures before her voice is replaced by Rhodey.
Peter had been there. The kid had called him dad, and Tony had never corrected him because it left the man feeling absolutely loved. And honestly, he loved Peter as if he
“Peter,” Tony sighed in relief, slumping into the kid’s hold. From the side of his eye he could see Rogers take a concerned step forward, realizing that Tony was truly not doing well.
The battle bots have been worn down, but it won’t take him longer than a few hours to get them all up to speed. It isn’t hard to convince Bruce that in order to make the bots actual worthwhile adversaries, he’s going to have to recode their programing.
“Sit on the bed, sweetheart.” Steve slowly led him to the mattress, setting him down and moving so that he can slip on the items. Once he’s done, he holds out a hand for Tony so that the genius doesn’t accidentally slip as they move towards the door.
Steve’s gaze traces Tony’s. He frowns at the slow-moving objects in question. He pinches an animated tissue between his fingers, bringing it to eye level. Tony grimaces as Steve shakes his crumpled, white prize, expecting the worst, but when nothing untoward falls from its folds, Tony’s face relaxes.
Tony flops Steve down onto the mattress, and crawls over him, stopping to feel the erratic thumping under his lips as he presses a kiss to Steve’s chest. He lifts his face to stare into those familiar blue eyes: desire, trust and love shining up at him. He cups Steve’s chin and smiles softly. “Doesn’t matter, the bits of you that matter are all still here.”
Tony’s smirk is back, fixed firmly in place as he dips out of view to grab something from the table in front of the couch. Clint takes a few steps forward, pushing past the thick air of humiliation determinedly until he can see the large platter Stark is lifting into view.
Wringing his hands together, Tony mutters, “It might.” He doesn’t need the suit to assess his bio-data and let him know that, no, he’s very, very
“Maybe that’s the plan, Stark. To take my revenge on you for turning me into a science experiment.” He rolls his hips again just as the elevator opens to Tony’s room.
“You know, Rogers, it is imperative to accurately reflect all possible adverse reactions in the fact sheet,” Tony murmurs lowly.
Steve laughs, leaning close to Tony and licking his lips. “No, no, now’s good. Probably best to try again while I still have the taste of the first one on my tongue, and I remember what to do."
Tony internally bemoans the fact the finite amount of blood in his body doesn’t seem to be sufficient to power two heads at once. With his brain running on half power, it takes a moment for the puzzle pieces to line up and click into place. “Oh. Right. All your time spent in war, and ice, and as a lab rat, you’ve probably got PTSD enough to rival mine. We should compare notes sometime.” The levity in his voice is due only to the hollowness of the words, but Steve doesn’t push the point.
Tony shakes his head and attempts to drag his thoughts, kicking and screaming, back to family-friendly territory. This is so not the time. “I should be asking you that, Tiny Tim.” Tony presses the back of his hand to Steve’s forehead, frowning before pulling it back and wiping it against the bright yellow and red Iron Man masks printed on his pajama pants. “I’m not a doctor, though I’ve played one a few times, but given your body is running hot enough to cook my breakfast, I think we need to get you out of this blanket. Insulation is the last thing you need.”
Steve shakes his head, his eyes opening, the wheeze finally fading from his chest. He hesitates, eyes sliding from Tony’s before answering. “Nothing that should be a problem.”
“What the actual fuck, Rogers? Where--” Tony gestures to Steve’s now very small body lying on the workshop couch, “--is the rest of you?”
Steve's moan echoes around them. “I was just going to say we can’t do this sitting down.” Strong hands slide under Tony’s ass, taking his weight as Steve lifts them both in one smooth move. Tony's squeak of surprise is chased by throaty groan as Steve somehow shucks his pants without putting him down.
“The most important thing,” Tony continues, rubbing Steve’s shoulder, “is whether or not you liked it.”
Oh, god. Clint is suddenly at the crossroads of trying to decide whose wrath he fears more: the hulking national treasure and the tin man’s or Nat’s. He sighs. There’s really no contest. He thumbs open the SI app linked to his hearing aid, and presses the purple and white target icon to start the recording.
Steve’s tight shoulders drop visibly as tension leaves him. He blows out a relieved breath. “Oh, good. I thought I did something wrong.”
place to blow things up. I doubt they’ll even be mad. I bet they don’t even send me a bill. They’ll probably apologize to me for their stupid elevator putting me in this position in the first place, which, come to think of it, they really should.”
Tony’s gut clenches painfully, but it’s too early in the crisis to take a time out to examine the unsettling mix of fear and grief that Steve’s comment has stirred up, so he shoves it down under his always-ready supply of crushing guilt and heavy denial. “I am not killing a national treasure, if only because it would land me on a murderous ex-assassin’s kill list. I need to run a few tests, but in theory, it should be reversible.”
, and Tony does a double take. Those eyes are the same. And the nose, straight but for the bump where someone had obviously taken issue with Steve’s particular brand of annoyingly righteous bastard before he became
Steve’s gaze falls and locks on to his lips, and Tony can’t stop from swiping his tongue over them, watching as Steve’s eyes darken in response. Reaching up to run a tentative thumb over Steve’s pulse point, Tony smiles when he feels the erratic thumping of Steve's heart a mirror of his own.
Clint thumbs the lockscreen away and presses on the cropped picture of Nat smirking up at him. His fingers dance across the screen.
Steve’s face is so close to his, that the rush of air carrying his words brushes over Tony's lips like a warm caress as Steve murmurs, “I’m always off-balance around you, Stark.”
“JARVIS! Scan the tower, find an inhaler! Or, uh, call Doctor Cho!” Tony’s voice is riding the edge of hysteria, but it’s an entirely valid response to the current situation, so he’s not going to get cringey about it. He twists on the spot, eyes darting around the room, wishing that Barton or Barnes, or any one of the freeloaders living in the tower, always choosing the most inopportune moment to appear, would show up when they were wanted for once. But of course, that would be expecting too much. His eyes fall back to Steve’s cheeks, the red tinge only serving to contrast how pale the rest of him is. “JARVIS, both! Do both!”
The red on Steve’s cheeks spreads quickly to every inch of skin on display, and, Tony hopes, all the parts that aren’t.
“Careful, Stark. People will think you’re a genius if you keep up those astounding feats of observation.”
In his blanket-nest, Steve is still focused intently on his carefully measured breathing,  though something sounding very much like an annoyed huff reaches Tony’s ear. “Ignore him, JARVIS. I’m fine. Stop overreacting, Tony.”
Tony’s voice drops conspiratorially, leaning in like it isn’t just the two of them --well, three of them, but he doesn’t know that, Clint thinks-- in the room. “So, are you still hungry or have you had your fill for now? It’s okay if you need a break before round two. Your secret is safe with me.”
The gears in Clint's head, lubricated by his extremely active imagination, pick up speed. His eyes go wide as he fumbles in his pocket for his phone.
“No, I heard you the first time. I just meant... ah...” Tony’s pretty sure he’s just suffered acute mental whiplash. Or... a dislocation? A dislocated brain. Is that a thing? It must be a thing because he’s pretty sure he has it and is going to need some form of mental traction. “Uh. Um. No…?”
“Well, should I expect the cutting edge tech to stop doing whatever it’s doing before it kills me? Or is my death certificate going to read,
Tony mentally curses his traitorous AI, resolving to send a small power surge his way later. Just enough to trigger a reboot, send him to the virtual naughty corner, and give him time to think about what he’s done. “I am
Steve is the first to recover, snapping his mouth closed, his eyes dropping low, suddenly finding Clint’s shoes fascinating. Tony blinks a few times, gradually bringing his eyes back to their normal size. He coughs but remains uncharacteristically quiet.
Steve rocks forward again, catching his mouth. Tony moans into the kiss as slender arms encircle his neck and tug him closer. Steve tastes exactly the same, as it turns out.
, he eyes Steve cautiously. “So, uh, would this be a bad time to tell you I’m more than slightly claustrophobic? And by more than slightly, I mean
Clint freezes before taking a silent step back and flattening himself against the refrigerator. He taps the aid behind his ear and winces as Steve’s voice stabs into his head like an auditory ice pick. Fucking Stark tech, as temperamental as its creator. He slides his finger over the hearing aid gently, adjusting the amplification, finding the sweet spot.
Tony waves Steve’s words away impatiently. Good ol’ Steve, if he didn’t have the serum coursing through his rather attractive veins, his superpower would be oversimplification. “That’s different. My suits are comfortable, like metal pajamas with life support. That and they have the added benefit of being a form of voluntary confinement.” Tony’s words leave him in a rush, like rats abandoning a sinking ship, as if they can sense his lungs are about to collapse. “This is not voluntary. This is very much the opposite of voluntary. Extremely involuntary. And is this box shrinking, or is it just me?” He presses two fingers into the seam where his neck meets his shirt collar and tugs frantically.
Tony corrects himself silently. Steve is almost entirely pink now, but remains silent. Tony nods and claps his hands together. “Of course we’re not! So, clearly, you did something to, uh…” His head quirks to the left, eyes narrowing on the table. “Why is Mount Kleenex reforming of its own accord?”
The garbled noise in his throat is somewhere between a laugh and a scream. “I’m pretty sure we passed okay about ten minutes ago, Cap. We’re rapidly speeding into very
The corner of Tony’s lip pulls up in a smirk, while Steve’s brows furrow, confusion scrawled across his face. He turns to Tony who throws him a knowing glance, and understanding and embarrassment spread over Steve’s face like a time-lapse sunset.
Steve’s face falls, and Tony has the decency to feel a little bad. He sinks down next to Steve, takes the bottle, breaks the seal, and hands it back. Steve turns his baby blues Tony’s way, a begrudging
territory without brakes or airbags.” A slight tremor is the only warning he gets before his legs buckle, and he's sliding down the elevator wall to the floor.
Steve is suddenly extremely interested in the tissue in question, but Tony thinks his cheeks look a little brighter than a moment ago. And damned if he isn’t seven shades of adorable when he blushes like that. Tony’s smile pushes higher as he comes and takes the tissue from Steve’s grasp.
When the bottle is empty, Steve takes it, replaces the cap, and tucks it back in his bag. Tony shifts his focus to his own hands, fingers opening and closing around thin air.
Tony’s hands cup Steve’s ass, taking his weight as he stands, swallowing down the soft gasp of surprise as he carries them toward the elevator. He can spare thirty seconds of their twenty minutes to return to his room, where he can take Steve apart properly on his king-sized bed. Steve’s legs lock around Tony’s waist, grinding desperately against his belly, and Tony almost abandons his plan in exchange for taking him up against the wall of the elevator. He breaks the kiss with a gasp. “...Fuck, Steve, if you keep that up, you’re going to kill
“You really don’t know?” Steve’s voice is soft, and his eyes waver like they want to fix on anything but Tony.
Tony walks to his workbench. There’s a jumbled mix of metallic noises as determined fingers go searching through the organized chaos before he turns, triumphantly, one black nitrile glove snapping its twin against his wrist. “Want to bend over and cough, Rogers?” His eyebrows twitch up suggestively.
Tony folds himself down on the couch next to Steve. “Scientifically speaking, cravings indicate your system is unbalanced and requires additional ...nutrients.” He closes his fist around the blanket and pulls it from Steve’s lap to his own. Steve watches it slide away without protest. “It would be a shame to deny your body what it needs.”
Steve pulls the fabric over himself, a little more red balancing out the greenish tint of his skin. “Ideally, you’re about to figure out what happened and come up with a genius idea to reverse it.”
Steve shakes his head, scrubbing a hand through his hair. “You’re just saying that to try and make me feel better.”
He then moved the trunk over to sit innocently besides the trunk that held his husband’s armor. An Alpha and Omega pair that were ready for war. It was fitting seeing as the purpose of this union was a martial one. The light in the room was fading now. Tony had barley noticed the passage of time as he worked and was started when there was another knock at the door.
Tony turned his eyes back to his husband-to-be. Steven was pouring them more meed and Tony could make out what appeared to be a satchel beside the goblets. Steven was still using the goblet Tony had given him and he had pulled out another one for Tony. Steve gently replaced the pitcher and gathered up goblets and the satchel. He turned and slowly made his way over to Tony. Steven sat down and held out the plainer of the two goblets to Tony.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Oh. That was one thing Tony expected to have to deal with after marrying a celt that he wasn’t looking froward to.
“The owld man.” Sarah cried, burying her face in her father’s chest just like she had done her Uncle’s.
A hand clapped Tony firmly on the shoulder. “Are you ready?” Bruce asked, thankfully in Tony’s native tongue.
The soldier’s hands quickly left Tony’s lower body to allow him to remove the last of his own clothing.
Tony nodded gravely as he looked down at the baby girl held lovingly in his arms. At some point the baby had fallen asleep. Looking at her peaceful face, Tony couldn't imagine anyone ever being able to do something like abandoning such a beautiful little girl. And yet, the fact that she was in an orphanage in the first place suggested that this might in fact be the second time someone had done so.
"Sarah Taelyn Adelina Rogers-Stark." Steve breathed adoringly as he looked down at their daughter. "Its perfect."
"I got it." Tony said, waving the still warm piece of paper in the air. "Sarah Taelyn Adeline Rogers-Stark. Born on May 19th. Daughter of Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Its official. She's ours."
Steve’s face fell into a serious mask that Tony worried he would soon become familiar with. “I’ll be right there, Jimmy. Go tell my brother where I have gone and to meet me there if he could.”
The minister looked appalled at the display, but it only made the King’s smile grow. T’Challa bent down and caught the little girl as she threw herself into his waiting arms with another happy cry of “Kitty”. The King laughed and stood to his full hight, the little girl still clutched lovingly in his arms.
Tony slowly entered and walked over to one of the windows. He could see the sea beyond them through the pane. It allowed sunlight into the room that lit the space. Tony turned back to take in the rest of the room. It was rather sparsely furnished, but the furs and the large bed made the large room feel cozy.
Steve began to turn slowly onto his back. Tony moved his hand way and made room for his betrothed to lie flat on his back, Steve’s broad shoulders making his skin shoulder brush against Tony’s bare chest.
Steven let go of his hand once they entered. He reached down and unlaced his shoes, depositing them by the entrance flap. Tony followed his lead and started unfastening his own shoes as he watched his betrothed light the fire so that they could see in the dwindling twilight. Steven bent down and quickly got a spark with the flint. He blew hard on the sparking embers and nodded to himself in satisfaction as the fire lit up. Tony watched him walk across their tent to a small table in the corner before sprawling down on the inviting furs. The pelts were just as soft as Tony though they would be.
Tony sighed once the door closed behind his fiancé. He turned back to the room and started taking in more of the details. There were two candle holders on either side of the bed that hung from the wall. The itself bed was made of thick solid wood. It was simple, but elegant. The poster were carved into twisted pillars and there was an intricate knot carved on the footboard that was surrounded by various leaves and swirling designs. The bed was covered in soft furs with what was probably a fine linen sheet underneath. Tony ran his hand over the sheets as he walked around the bed to go back to now of the windows. A nock on the door startled him out of his explorations.
Steve sighted and shook his head, clearly not agreeing with Tony’s assessment. Tony studied Steve with half lidded eyes. There was something there that Tony couldn’t put his finger on. There was clearly another layer to this that Tony wasn’t grasping, but it was apparent that Steve wasn’t going to do anything fun with Tony again tonight.
He grabbed Tony’s very loose tie and pulled him into a much steamier kiss. Steve’s action elicited a slight moan from his partner before the two pulled apart.
Tony frowned slightly. He had decided long ago that the High King of Ireland was the man he was going to marry, but now that he was here, Tony was having second thoughts. Was he really prepared to do this?
Tony turned around and came face to face with his fiancé. Tony didn’t turn to look at Natasha, but she must have made some sort of affirmative gesture because the next thing Tony knew, Steve’s hands were pressed to his and there were sparks zinging down his spine. Tony lost track of time. He didn’t know how long they spent dancing there on the floor, but at some point the guests had begun to filter out of the hall.
“And thats not even the worst part.” Tony continued, though it was difficult for Steve to even begin to imagine something worse than the images that were permeating his mind and slowly invading his subconscious like molasses oozing through the cracks in his defenses.
“I-“ Tony paused. He could not tell Steve any of this. He couldn’t show this weakness. “Etruscans are exclusively monogamous in marriage. I… I take that commitment seriously.”
It all started with a Shield job that Steve was needed on. He had gone off on what was only meant to be a quick trip. He was only supposed to be gone for a few days, staying in the couple’s D.C. apartment to rest before returning to their Malibu home after the job was over. It had ended up being a much longer stay than either partner had anticipated.
Tony shook his head. “He could care less. Bruce, Pepper, Rhodey, they all were victims of my father’s greed. My father allowed the slave trade in the city to expand far beyond anything that had been done perviously. He and most of the rest of the nobility didn’t actually see them as people so of course they didn’t care what happened to them so long as it provided those bastards with a cheep labor force. I did what I could to counter that, but there was only so much I could do myself. I was my father’s heir, but in his eyes I could never be good enough.” Steve’s fingers tightened infinitesimally against his cheek, but their caress continued just as gently as it started.
However, before the super soldier had time to act upon his plan, he noticed the metallic glitter of some sort of projectile moving towards him out of the corner of his eye. Acting on instinct, Steve turned his back towards the attacker and curled his body protectively around his young son and the baby, clutching them both as tightly as he dared.
“Hello Pete-y pie.” Tony closed the door behind him and made his way over to his son’s bed. “How was your day, my shining light?”
The baby started quietly complaining again and Steve, who had plenty of experience from when Peter was young, quickly realized that the little baby had only been crying because it needed a new diaper.
“Yes. Until you have learned how to behave yourself” Steve said smugly before parading victoriously out of the nursery.
“Are you going to say anything or is it just going to come down to me doing all the talking as always?” Tony said, his face kept carefully neutral.
Eventually, Steve came back to himself, despite still being worried about Bucky. Though he continued to be consumed by guilt over all of the hardships his best friend had no doubt endured during his absence. The relief that Tony experienced over Steve’s recovery was short lived, however.
Steve and the rest of the avengers slowly (too slowly for the tastes of Tony, Hulk, Thor, and Hawkeye) made their was towards the center of the city and were nearing the end of the battle. Steve for his part, could hear the fighting beginning to die down and decided to make a sweep of one last building before making his way towards his comrades, figuring that by the time he got there the fighting would be completely over.
Tony nodded to them as the servants left the room. The young black man bowed and made to leave, but Tony stopped him.
Tony pulled on the loose Etruscan trunks he still favored for underclothes and sleeping in and turned
Tony took a moment to replace his mask, which he had removed after landing, and look over the embroidery. After a minute or so, Tony reached up and removed his mask again.
When he finally couldn't put off leaving any longer, Steve regretfully took one of the couple’s private planes and headed for the battlefield. He was desperately worried about Tony and willed himself to resolve the situation as quickly as possible so he could return home and take care of his family.
The man was taller than Tony and had large muscled arms. Tony’s eyes jumped from his bulging biceps to his glorious chest and a shoulder to wait ratio that would have made any of the many gods he had hear tales about jealous. Tony inhaled sharply. His future-husband was hot. Tony’s eyes trailed down to thick legs and an unfortunately loose fitting tunic top. Curse the Celts for not wearing clothing that was just a little bit tighter. Then again Tony supposed he should be grateful it wasn’t the loose fitting Etruscan entire of his homeland, then he would only have his handsome face and broad shoulders to admire.
Steve’s hands moved to Tony’s hips and slowly, achingly, made their way up his partner’s body feeling every muscle and curve of the body that the super soldier knew so well. When he finally reached the top of his lover’s shirt and the aforementioned tie, he started to undo first Tony’s tie and then each of the tiny buttons on his shirt with practiced fingers. One of Steve’s fingers delicately brushed against the hollow of the other man’s neck as he undid the top button of the shirt causing Tony to gasp slightly at the unexpected contact. Tony used the intake of breath to his advantage and decided that his lover was far too composed for his liking.
Tony had pouted for days at the perceived suggestion that his security system, which he had just finished thoroughly updating at the time, was inadequate to protect his new baby son. Steve had, as of yet, not succeed in convincing his partner to take them up on the offer.
The super soldier’s smile melted in an instant. He opened his mouth to argue, but his partner cut him off.
Tony took several deep calming breaths that only partially worked with the scent of his own slick and the building scent of Steve’s musk permitting the air. When he could finally hear more than his heart beat and their mingled breaths, Tony he focused on trying to hear was Steve did.
It was in that instant, looking at his lover and their children, that Tony realized he was well and truly screwed and he wouldn't change it for the world.
“Well, if you eventually take another spouse who will surely live with us, why worry about who does and does not hear me when we mate?”
Little Sarah, who was almost a year old now, enjoyed watching her brother’s antics and seemed to especially enjoy the desperate attempts her parents made to try and get Peter off the walls and into the cage like playpen.
“Steve.” Steven interrupted. “I wish for you to call me Steve, if you would like…” Steven looked down nervously and began fiddling with the furs below them.
"Sarah huh?" Tony said. Testing the name. "I like it, but its a little old fashioned. Maybe we should balance it out with a name she wont hate us for?"
Steve’s head rolled over to look at Tony, face serious and giving off an aura that instantly made it seem as if anything Tony had to say would be the most important thing in the world. Tony swallowed heavily, no one had ever looked at him like that. Like his words and opinions could alter his audience’s fate.
Peter was currently strapped protectively to Steve's chest and Steve was practically going out of mind with worry. He wasn't alone. Tony was on the cusp of an all out panic attack and was frantic about the idea of taking his son out on a mission, but they didn't have much choice. The Shield helacarier was a giant target floating in the sky and the super heroes would not leave their baby boy on there. No, he was much safer with them. IT also had the advantage of allowing them to keep a constant eye on him, leaving both parents (but especially Tony) free to focus on the task at hand rather than be distracted with worry over what could possibly be happening to their son while they were elsewhere (though Tony still had half his brilliant mind worrying over the safety of his partner and child).
“What happened?” Tony questioned sharply, already moving towards the young King and the children held in his arms.
Tony’s hand reached over to soothingly run his fingers through his son’s curly locks. “I don’t know. I’m sorry, Peter. I wish I had a better answer for you, but I promise your Papa loves you so much. I will tell you anything I hear from him, but for now just know that we both love you more than anything.” Tony bent down and kissed his son's head.
Tony went to the door and entered the hall. He came face to face with a short haired man who was only slightly taller than himself. This face was another of the men he had seen in the group that brought him there.
Despite their initial confusion and uncertainty about the extent of their babies full abilities, since Peter was only about six months old when he was left with the super couple, Steve and Tony had learned rather quickly. At some point, Steve and Tony had grown so accustomed to their super powered baby and his frequent roof rampages that they had done everything they could to baby proof the entirety of the house, floor to ceiling. However it wasn't perfect and they tried to keep Peter away from the majority of the house when he was running all around the walls and ceiling.
When he stood up he found Steve’s eyes raking over his body and the blush firmly back in place. Tony reached up and pulled Steve down into another chaste kiss. He pulled back, satisfied with the distinctly dazed look on his husband’s face.
“I swear to be honest and true. To calm you, keep you, and honor you.” Tony said, managing to say it as well as he possibly could.
“Yeah I get the whole 1940s thing that a man is supposed to be the ‘bread winner’ and ‘bring home the bacon’ and all the other crap they call it, but this is the 21st century and thats bull shit.” The shorter male gestated rapidly, his hands flying in random directions. “You staying here and taking care of our children is far more important than my stupid job! You are not useless. In fact you probably do more work than I do” Tony ranted, his voice ever escalating in both volume and emotion.
Tony’s hands moved up to grip Steve’s hair tightly. Steve leaned farther in, his breath ghosting across Tony’s face before he moved to kiss the hinge of his jaw. Tony whimpered softly. He wanted Steve’s fingers to press harder against his bonding gland, but he also wanted Steve’s lips to kiss down his neck. He wanted Steve to bite him, milk his bonding scent from the gland, and forge a mating bond between the two of them. Tony’s legs started spreading of their own accord at the same moment that Steve pulled completely away from him.
Instead of taking his anger out on his friends after the horrendous woman had left, Tony channeled his emotions into teasing Fury about his protectiveness.
Baby Sarah was in a similar state of near waking as her new brother had been. Steve smoothly moved his arms so that he could reach down and pick up the little baby before clutching her lovingly the his chest. She yawned widely in Steve's arms before nestling slightly into his warmth. Steve started swaying slightly to sooth both kids and hopefully get one or the other of them back to sleep.
Tony bends quickly, retrieves the blanket and throws it back at Steve. “Yes, yeah. Right. It’s just big, I mean, we have big, uh, bigger problems then.... Huh. Sorry, what am I doing? And why do you find the current conversation so…stimulating?”
“Asthma!” Tony jolts to his feet, wincing at the high pitched note of panic ringing loud in his voice. He clears his throat. “Since when do you have asthma?”
his eyes are going to pop out of his head if Steve keeps going... followed in short order by some kind of massive coronary event.
Tony curls his fingers around the bottle and frowns down at it with vision that is darkening around the edges. “You’re seriously at me to hydrate right now?”
“So, I’m starting to get dizzy. Are you starting to get dizzy? It could be the carbon dioxide. Oh, I should have worn the suit to dinner. I was
“That’s called saving some for later, Rogers.” Tony’s laugh is low and husky as he swipes his finger over the aforementioned body part.
Steve pulls his knees to his chest inside his blanket bubble. “You ordered us sushi for dinner.” Steve’s nose wrinkles at the memory. “You ate mine, and then we went to your room... for dessert.”
Tony drops a kiss on the end of Steve’s nose as he carries him to the bed, enjoying the role reversal of being the one doing the man-handling for a change. “You were a science experiment long before I met you, Rogers.” Tony smirks at the dark look that crosses Steve’s face. “Oh, don’t be like that, or I won’t let you be my adorable little guinea pig next time I have tech in need of testing.”
-whatever it is between them- for a while now. And if Captain America’s secret kink is panic attacks, Tony might as well roll with it. It can’t be said that he doesn't seize opportunities with both hands. And he’s more than willing to lay hands and mouth and more on this particular opportunity. “I’d say we would probably wrack up more damage to this box than my repulsors could ever dream of achieving.”
Steve had been researching for him. So that means... “You wanted to see if it makes me a liability in the field. To the team.” Tony says flatly, flushing hot for all the wrong reasons.
Clint peels himself from the fridge and clears his throat. “Uh, hey, guys. Hi.” He waves as Tony and Steve swivel toward him. “I couldn’t help overhearing, and that’s your fault, Stark,” Clint says, gesturing to his high-tech hearing aid. “I’m happy for you, really.” He pauses, considering. “Mostly,” he corrects himself with a shrug. “I had money on you getting together a month ago. As it stands, Nat’s gonna take the pot. But, if you could put a pin in the blow-by-blow, and any subsequent blowing until after I get my coffee to go, that’d be great.”
Clint is grateful when Sam’s face pops up on his screen, relieved to put his eyes anywhere but the men on the couch.
Staring at Steve and trying to concentrate on anything other than the large hand still wrapped around his, Tony scoffs. “What are you talking about? It’s the
“Helpful, yeah. But why are you using it to research this, specifically? Most people just use it for porn.”
okay. Trying to keep his heart in his chest where it belongs, and not taking center stage in some kind of cardiological remake of
Tony’s brain is reeling, trying -and failing- to follow the abrupt u-turn in conversation. They’ve been dancing around the edges of this ...
overreacting, this is the perfect amount of reacting. Is there anything else I should know? Any other ailments I need to prepare for?” He can feel his heartbeat picking up pace in his chest, racing his brain toward the hazy shape of a panic attack looming large in the distance.
Steve pushes the blanket off Tony’s lap and takes its place. “Hmm, then you give and I’ll take. It’s the least you can do after almost killing me.”
Sarah curled herself more tightly against her “kitty’s” chest, her face burrowing in the crook of his neck as if she were trying to hid from something.
King T’Challa was currently standing in a very last minute and remarkably boring “meeting” with one of his older advisors. He was supposed to have been at the landing pad to greet his friends and fellow Avengers almost 20 minutes ago. He had invited them all here for a celebration in their honor. Didn’t his dimwitted minister realize how incredibly rude he was making his King appear to be?
The CEO came home every day exhausted and complaining about how the Board was nagging him as usual. So, in an attempt to keep from adding any extra stress to Tony’s already heavy load, Steve had kept this insecurity to himself. However, Tony could tell that there was something bothering his lover, even if Steve wouldn't say anything to him about it.
“And you seem observant.” Tony replied, his young apparently still sharp despite the cotton filling his head.
Fury's only response was a grunt while the rest of the avengers, minus Steve who was putting down the kids for a much needed nap, lost it with laughter.
There was an emergency! Shield had issued the highest level warning in their system and had called in all the members of the Avengers, including Steve and Tony. At first the couple had been frantic about what to do about their baby boy, but the problem was too large and important to waste time. Besides, the only people they trusted to keep their precious son safe were also called into action. So, the new parents had been forced into drastic measures.
“Oh Anthony, Steven. Wonderful. Now we can start the feast.” Sarah said from her seat on the left of the highest backed chair.
He gestured to the ropes and Steven nodded. The brunette man began untying the ropes and soon Tony felt them go slack on his wrist. The man pulled the ropes away, allowing their hands to fall. He then moved to drape Tony’s rope around Steven’s neck and, after a pause and another nod from is betrothed, Steven’s around Tony’s neck. The man stepped back and grasped the woman’s hand in his own. Ah, they must be married.
As their party finally emerged completely from the trees, Tony could make out just the edge of the ocean and a stone peer jutting out into it from the heart of the village. Tony looked back towards the trees and could see where the black sand beach curved back out towards the sea and rose into high cliffs covered in the same thick forest they had just traveled through. As he observed, their party continued riding through the tall grasses dotted with the last wildflowers before fall truly took hold.
“Mother, this is my future husband, Prince Anthony Stark of Vetulonia, rightful King of the Etruscans.” Steve introduced.
Steve reached up and pulled on Tony’s loosened tie, dragging the younger man in for a much deeper kiss. The genius quickly gave up on the idea of getting up and instead leaned further into the kiss, his arm reaching out to balance his weight.
The caller stepped forward and began to speak, but the king could not hear him. He knew the lines the man spoke, “… King Anthony first of his name…”, but the roar of emotion defend him. It wasn’t until the caller ended his speech by announcing “Sir Steven Rogers, the Shielding Star” that the King became aware of the room again.
“I could go along with that.” Tony teased, smirk in place and his own empty hand quickly retrieving his new dagger.
A long silence followed his desperate plea. If Tony hadn’t been so shaky in Steve’s arms, the elder would have suspected his lover of being asleep.
He had hoped at first that the situation would sort itself out without the super soldier having to interfere, but alas it had not gone that way. To the contrary, Clint and Natasha were already on the scene but the situation was steadily worsening. They needed Steve and they needed him now.
It was on one of the nights that Tony returned home particularly late from work that he finally had enough. He had come home to a dark house, their children already having been asleep for hours and Steve himself appearing to have gone to bed already. The genius had tiredly made his way up the stairs and down the extensive hall to the master bedroom, silently cursing how far away his comfy bed and sexy lover were from the garage.
She and Rhodey both rose out of their bow making the tension that was visibly building in his future-husband start to fade.
Tony sighed, but allowed himself to turn into the soothing feeling of his Fiancé’s fingers brushing over his skin.
Sarah, having somehow sensed her fathers’ presence and Steve’s proximity, untangled her little arms from her Uncle’s neck and formal shirt to reach meekly out to Steve.
"If this is an orphanage, then why would they leave her here?" Steve asked, unconsciously reaching up to touch Peter. "I mean look at her. She's tiny. She can't be more than a few weeks old."
Steve furrowed his brow slightly and bit his bottom lip nervously. He reached out for his daughter and Natasha, somewhat reluctantly, handed her to him.
Steve and Tony shared a momentary look that clearly held an entire conversation between the two partners, but gave away nothing to T’Challa. When the couple broke eye contact, Steve turned to his comrade and nodded.
When the man reached the steps below the throne, he knelt, those blue eyes breaking away from the King’s gaze for the first time as the man bowed his head. The King gripped the arms of his seat so tightly he thought they might break as the feelings of hurt, betrayal, and sorrow attempted to consume him.
Tony was distracted from the pit of memories his mind was diving into by a tap on his arm. He turned and came face to face with the red headed women who was soon to be his sister-in-law. There had been an itch of recognition when he had seen her at the ceremony the previous day that now focused into knowledge. He had seen that face before.
“…as much to this household…” Steve continued on, valiantly trying to get his point across over his lover’s aggravated interjections.
“Thank you, Jarvis. Please give Ana my best.” Tony replied, pushing past Jarvis and into the main living space.
to watch as his fiancé finished undressing. Steve was dressed in the usual loose pants that the Celts favored for sleep, but he had apparently elected against the usual loose fitting tunic they also wore. His back was mesmerizingly beautiful, broad, and muscular. Tony wanted to claw at that expanse of smooth skin as the alpha’s cock pounded into him, but that probably wasn’t going to happen tonight with the tension that had built between them on the walk here.
Fury had sent one of his men out to find the head of the orphanage and drag her back to the helacarier. She was met with a great deal of anger from all the shield agents and Avengers. At first she hasn't understood until she had seen the baby that Steve was clutching protectively. As soon as saw the child that she referred to as a "worthless brat", she exploded in anger. It escalated to the point that Fury was so angry that he had actually yelled at the woman, who preceded to begrudgingly hand over all the information the orphanage had on the baby girl before swiftly leaving. It wasn't much, but it did confirm Tony's earlier fear that his new baby daughter had been abandoned at the orphanage in the first place.
