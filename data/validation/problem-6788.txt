Nobody had the heart to point out that, whether or not the knife pierced his heart, few ever recovered from being stabbed in the chest.
Steve hesitated, glancing down at their joined hands – it was strange to take such comfort from her as this, though he supposed she took comfort from his touch in return. They had only met once as children, spent but a few weeks together now, but still he felt that he knew her better than he should. Perhaps it was their shared loyalty to and love for Tony that tightened their bond. He hoped that they could retain a friendship even after this terrible situation was dealt with, but for now he allowed himself the simple reassurance of her thin hands and strong grip.
Stane’s skin went a little gray beneath his beard. “I am a representative of the Royal Kingdom of Menahahte, a guest here in your lands! To treat me like some sort of
Nia had a room on both sides of the line. Every Sunday night, she would walk to the dining room with one parent, hug them goodbye (stiffly, if it was Howard), and watch them walk out the door. Jarvis, Howard’s driver, would wait with her for the other parent to show. Then she would cross the line and live with the other parent for the next week.
“If I didn’t want to stay with you, Tony, I would have left,” Steve said firmly. “You think I’ve just been tolerating you all these months, waiting for the chance to run away?”
Steve was going to fall back on his original idea, which was that Tony was an arrogant, snide jerk who did not care about other people’s feelings… but he was uncomfortably aware that that particular line of reasoning was feeling its six years of use. And that, furthermore, Tony had done quite a lot to redeem that impression in all those years.
“Who are you?” Tony asked, feeling stirrings of unease settle deeply in his stomach. Fury had, apparently, had good reason to fear that the Asgardian civil conflict would spill over into Midgard. “Who are you working for?”
As King Howard looked bemusedly between them, the queen and regent nodded at each other in acknowledgment that they were of one mind.
Bucky did not wake up at all for three days, and was only conscious in fits and starts for the next four or so, never fully coherent. Steve was mulishly adamant that he never be absent when Bucky was awake, sleeping on the edge of his cot and all but physically assaulting people trying to move him without a sufficiently compelling reason.
As if his eyes are operating with a mind of their own, Tony’s stare falls slowly, inexorably, from the man’s beautiful face to his beautiful stomach. He had never thought a stomach could be beautiful before. Sexy, sure. Flirty in the right shirt, hell yes. But dear god—it’s not even the heroic six pack that’s doing it for him, because it’s not like he’s never seen one of those before. The guy’s hips are even narrower than Tony’s, which—taking into account the fact that his shoulders are probably
Bucky and Tony both shot their gazes up to the battlements behind the guardhouse where, sure enough, Clint’s shiny gold head was visible. He gave them a jaunty wave when he noticed their attentions.
“… Someone must have told Loki we were coming,” Natasha finished with a faint snarl in her voice. “Only a handful of people knew of our destination, and it took us less than a day to reach it. Which means there is a traitor in my household.”
There was a horrible keening noise in Tony’s ears all of a sudden, like one of the street lights out on the road was about to blow. It was so loud Tony swore he could not only hear it but also
“These books,” Maria said, as she shoved the bookshelf-door shut and then pulled four different books out from their spots on the shelf. The door swung open again, and the books popped back into their places. “Try it.”
“We could simply arrange for the impostor to be… waylaid,” she said sweetly, with what was a very concerning sort of charm even when Steve knew it wasn’t directed at him. “While we sneak Tony into the castle and into the wedding.”
Yinsen was kind: tending to Tony as best he could if he ever found Tony transformed off of the lake, prostrate on the ground or curled in upon himself in the dregs of pain. He was intelligent, as well. A chemist of some sort, judging by his sparse stories.
He knew that they wanted him to marry Natasha one day when they were grown up, and as much as he didn’t hate the idea, he knew Natasha would not want him – and even if she didn’t mind him, it hardly mattered what either of them thought, in the end, because they would not really have a say in who they married anyway.
From near the front of the formation created by the five of them, Bucky blindly sought Steve’s shoulder and clamped his hand around it. Steve was perfectly still, coiled like a wild animal waiting to strike, itching to catch a glimpse or a scent or a whisper of Natasha’s return. She was not with them in the forest, waiting anxiously – for she was ahead of them, scouting out the ruins beyond.
“Tony!” Obadiah greeted him, grinning widely as he swung the door open. “Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes? Come inside, come on.” He ushered a grateful Tony into the room, securely shutting and latching the door behind him.
Tony relived the early years of his relationship with Steve over the next week or so, both seeming to avoid each other with equal parts stubbornness and bitterness – at least on Tony’s part. Even Natasha had not tried to convince him to spend time with Steve, which Tony assumed meant that she did not know what was wrong and was determinedly working to figure out what it was before addressing either of them.
“He is far more than a mere archer,” Natasha clipped in, suddenly conceiving that to have the renowned warrior Thor on their side would be a goal worth actively pursuing; especially if his brother were in fact involved. Thor’s brilliant grin at the mention that Clint was an archer was promising enough, but this was no time for understatement.
Slowly, he lowered his head once more and pressed his soft, feathered cheek against the cold flagstones. He should have told the others goodbye when he had the chance. Should have told Steve how deeply he loved him. He had been running half a step ahead of his death for so long now, he should have known he would stumble at the last jump.
Natasha tried her hand one more time, being very fond of Pepper even though objectively they had only really spent the one summer together, many years earlier.
“She got sick,” Natasha continued, stroking a hand along one of the shining cream keys. “He didn’t have a pa, not then. Bucky’s ma died before he knew her, and his pa got the plague, his sisters, too. They needed friends, like I did.”
This was not like Tony. This was not like Tony at all. Tony did not choose silence, did not turn his back. Tony fought, and scrapped, and said hurtful things like his voice was as sharp and cutting as a cheese wire. He had fire in his brown eyes and they glowed gold and his cheeks flushed and he plotted revenge and he stayed cool and… he did not just…
He’s clearly missed something there, but Tony just cocks his head and jams a finger into the middle of Steve’s chest, where it presses against a long necklace. He’s willing to bet a ghastly amount of money he doesn’t actually have that it’s a set of dog tags. “Wait here, soldier.”
They all had only a brief moment to process the words before Tony had vanished from Natasha’s arms and shot across the grass to grab Bucky in a desperate embrace. “He told me you—” Tony cut himself off, hugging Bucky tighter as the other man blinked down at him in both shock and tentative hope. As the moments went on, and Tony showed no signs of leaving, Bucky’s arm came up to wrap around Tony’s shoulders, and he allowed his head to drop down and press against Tony’s damp hair.
After a moment spent considering Loki—or, perhaps, considering putting an arrow through his throat—Clint nodded and took off out of the splintered remains of the door without so much as a backwards glance.
He revealed Thor’s amulet cupped in his palm – covered with dried blood. Nestled alongside it was a single, white feather.
He and Bucky headed in that direction as slowly as Steve could manage through his fog of expectation, checking through several open cell doors, before eventually they ended up in front of a closed one. The light was very dim here, but there was just enough to make out faint shapes, and their eyes were adjusting better every moment. Unlike the outer portal, this door looked very new and very sturdy, and a quick wrestle with the handle let Steve know that it was firmly locked.
She laughed, bitterly, unsure why, of all the things to come to her, that was it, but it opened the floodgates of worries: what had happened to the other people at the hotel? Did her parents know what had happened to her? Did they know where she was? Would she see them again? And her friends; she wanted her friends. She wanted Jim there to pat her shoulder and tell her it would be fine; she wanted Carol to find something about her deserving of a compliment. She half-wanted Ty there; even as angry as she was at him, he wasn’t as terrifying as
Feeling like his heart was going to beat right through his ribs, Steve took another involuntary step forward as the swan looked up – looked right at him.
Clint reached into the inside of his jerkin and pulled out a neatly folded piece of paper. “Even better than that, Falconer. I have a list with only three names left on it.”
Steve turned slowly to Bucky, giving his friend’s face a quick glance. He was at once reassured and horrified to see that Bucky was glaring at Tony, eyes narrowed in clear suspicion. To someone who didn’t know Bucky like Steve did, the expression on his face could easily be interpreted as that of a jealous lover watching his beloved being married off to another man. But Steve knew Bucky very well indeed, and that was not a look of jealousy on his face, but one of outrage.
“Well, he seems to be taking his time,” said Nia. She scratched at the sleeves of her jacket. “Who else knows he’s here?”
other circumstances, I wouldn’t try it, but you kind of look like Snow White here, and I’ll kick myself if I don’t, so..”
Tony thought about Natasha’s joke about the ugly duckling, and found he could not help but to agree with her.
She touched a finger to the star, then looked in the mirror again. Her hands were trembling; it was almost time to go.
She had turned and looked at him, standing with one hand on the doorframe, looking somehow sad. He was a war hero, one of the most powerful men in UNITY, but Nia had watched, over the course of her young life, as he'd grown tired, diminished even, from the strong, dashing figure he'd cut when she had been a tiny girl, and he had always been out of reach, a man she knew more from the television and the radio than from playtimes or family outings.
She gritted her teeth, vowing to ask Howard what was going on, later, when something rapped at the window of her car. Startled, she looked up, to see a wide-eyed child peering in, jogging to keep up with them. She thought it was a boy, but she couldn’t quite be sure.
Nia sat in the car-- a very nice, shiny black car that contrasted sharply with the old, rusty models she saw on the road as they pulled out of the airport-- and stared out the window as her father and Dr. Yinsen talked about weapons upgrades and partisans and something about a skirmish in the hills.
“Oh, so this is a family thing, now?” Nia asked sullenly. “Not showing up to things we’ve promised to be at?”
The pain was getting worse the longer he stayed away from the lake, he could feel it. His thoughts were disappearing like steam. His muscles began to seize.
“Oh.”  Maria frowned for a moment, then say back down on the sofa and patted her lap. “Okay, sweetheart. Come here.”
He had found Tony, his Tony. He was alive. He was safe. The nightmare of uncertainty was finally over.
The girl frowned at her, not looking as if she knew what to make of Nia’s comment, and then held out her hand. “I’m Nancy,” she said. “I’m with General Ross’ party.”
This small castle they were encamped around was very old, and long-since abandoned. The large, gray stones of its walls were irregular but tightly and expertly packed together. If it had once had a roof, it had long since been lost to time. Its squat, square layout suggested it predated the Midgardian monarchy, and all around them in the woods were pieces of decimated structures and rings that indicated where the castle’s village would once have been.
Nia froze. She couldn't breathe; it felt like her ribcage was contracting. When she tried to speak, all she did was sputter wordlessly.
But then along with the setting sun came the same pain of the first transformation, and he thought for the first time that he might have wished Loki had just cursed him to remain eternally winged. The pain did not end, this time. The transformation was stalled mid-way, pulsing agony flooding his body with no result. Once more, the lake was his only relief – dragging the horror of this transformation down to a dull roar throughout his body, and letting it follow through on its shape-shifting threat. But it was nothing like the spasming nightmare of remaining off the lake's surface.
Then, just as soon as it had appeared, the glow was gone. The change was so abrupt that Steve barely had time to adjust to the darkness of twilight before a dark shape crested from where the swan had disappeared moments before.
“You have given us a great deal, Your Highness,” she demurred, bowing slightly in thanks. “And even if there was nothing else, you have given us renewed hope.”
“Oh my god,” Tony said in a quiet voice, then repeated, much louder, “Oh my god! How dare you be magical around me? Around DUM-E, no less! You brought magic into my den of science, you heathen!”
He was wearing an embroidered red shirt over plain brown breeches, a strangely common item of clothing for a prince. The sleeves of the shirt were rolled up to expose his forearms, and it was open to the chest as though he had gotten bored half-way through buttoning it. He was tall, much taller than Steve, and beginning to fill out with muscle at the age of sixteen. His hair was still short in a boyish style, but long enough in places that Steve could tell it would curl if allowed.
Steve didn’t dance. And he didn’t ask Tony to play any songs. That night, when Natasha and Bucky had collapsed on the rug, flushed and grinning and with their hair wild from their twirling, Tony peered over the top of the harpsichord at Steve, who was drawing in his bound sketchbook.
She walked into her room. It was palatial, twice the size of either of her bedrooms at home, and had an enormous bed at the center, with a thick down coverlet, and a bathroom with two sinks and a bathtub large enough that Nia suspected she could swim in it. The carpet was rich and plush; the windows took up an entire wall, and were hung with rich, shimmering draperies.
Bucky was good company, as always: fascinated by Tony’s work with machines and automation, and full of questions and anecdotes about the past year at their respective castles. They fell silent for part of the trip as the carriage wove through the mountains, and then Bucky tentatively mentioned that he had been a little leery about deep crevasses ever since being thrown into one the year previous. Tony snorted at that and noted that most sane people had a healthy fear of deadly ravines, which led to an argument which descended promptly into a wrestling match in the close confines of the carriage.
Steve would say so much more than that, but if Tony needed to hear it, after all these years, it was the very least of what he deserved after all Steve’s cowardice. So he rose up onto his knees, his face almost level with Tony’s where he sat upon the couch, and he summoned every scrap of feeling he had for the brave, beautiful man looking at him with a sort of disbelieving expectation.
For the next few days, it appeared it was Tony’s turn to avoid Steve, since Steve was certainly making no conscious effort and he barely even saw the man’s shadow after the night in the drawing room.
A scream wanted to make its way from his throat, one of pain and despair and frustration, but he did not have the energy. He wanted to warn the others, he wanted to see their faces one last time – he would remain a swan for the rest of his life if he had to, if only he could see them. He could be brave, like Steve, and watch the man he adored marry another, as long as he could be there at his side. But he wanted kisses and he wanted… he wanted…
Steve leapt out of the chair like it had been kicked out from under him, and Sam instantly lunged over his seat and wrapped his entire body around Steve’s back, trying to keep him from pouncing on Tony. Sam was bigger and much less frail, so his weight would have been enough even if Bucky had not joined in, darting around the table to press his hands on Steve’s shoulders and yell at him to calm down.
“There isn’t much I can do for curses either,” came another quiet voice from the back of their group, where Steve looked up to see the doctor, Bruce, standing with Sam and Clint. “But…” he drew a little nearer, and looked meaningfully at Steve. “I’ve traveled extensively, and the one thing I’ve seen that can reliably break a curse is… well, love.”
“It was my choice to stay, Tony. Whatever you’ve cooked up in that head of yours, it isn’t true. I stayed with you because I wanted to.” Steve’s eyes were shining, whether from honesty or unshed tears Tony wasn’t really sure.
Despite everything, Steve found himself shrinking back around the corner and peering out to spy on the scene, his hand pressed over his mouth, trying to keep in a laugh. The swan was alternately pecking at Clint’s stomach, pulling at his boot, and honking at him urgently.
He felt like he could scream, it was so unfair. How could he not have seen this when he had Tony right in front of him? Was he so selfish, so stubborn, that he was incapable of recognizing a blessing and a miracle all in one when it was standing in front of him with glowing brown eyes and a crooked grin?
Natasha flung a hand in his direction. “As I said to Sitwell, yet he's still adamant about a cartouche. A
“I am fortunate my treacherous brother has not soured your opinion of me,” Thor grinned wanly, at which Tony merely snorted. “It is an honor to meet you, Prince Tony. Your friends speak highly of you.”
,” the guy grumbled, but he looked like he was cracking a grin. “But, yeah, kind of. Tony, I’m not really sure how to ask this without sounding like a dick, but… did you say you loved me?”
“No wonder you’ve been so weird all this time! How did you know this Peggy? How long have you been a monster and why the hell—how the hell did that happen? No, wait, you’re back to your normal self and we don’t have to worry about that whole monster thing anymore so does this mean you’ll finally kiss m—mpfff!”
Steve shoved him fondly, peering around him to see that there was another door immediately behind the one Bucky had just opened, and that this one was already ajar. Behind it was another short hallway ending in a sharp turn. Bucky strode down to the turn confidently, disappearing into the room beyond, and Steve followed him curiously.
Tony’s eyes were large and bright, challenging Steve and refusing to back down. It was one of the things about Tony that made Steve’s stomach tighten with affection - that stubbornness to match Steve’s own. Only, these days Steve was simply too compromised by his own desires and traitorous heart to step up to Tony’s challenging glares.
Steve began seeking Tony out during the afternoons, then, after all his chores around the castle were completed and he was scolded away from carrying on his work in the afternoon when, as the Crown’s ward, he should have been on his own time.
Her mother had looked a little sad at that. “Annie,” she’d said. “Your entire life, people are going to judge you. They’re going to say you don’t deserve what you have, they’re going to accuse you of getting where you are by cheating your way, by doing things you would never do, they’re going to underestimate your intelligence.”
She tapped the window lightly, jiggled at the tube, and tried to fit a finger into the space where the tube ran. It was sealed over with caulk, up to the space where the tube passed through, but she was able to peel some of it away with her fingers. She held the window carefully in place, wriggling the frame up as she dug out more of the caulk, until she had managed to squeeze her hand in, sliding her fingers around the frame until she found Howard’s electronic lock and entered the security override.
Obadiah settled a little more on his hip, tilting his head at Tony. “The wedding has probably already started, and Hammer will be there to throw off your friends. Apart from that one – the archer? He’s unconscious in your chamber, bumbled in at the wrong time, I’m afraid. Now,” he tapped the feather on Tony’s head once more. “Shall I snap your neck, or just leave you here to bleed to death?” He looked up and down Tony’s body, then smirked and returned his gaze to Tony’s black eyes, glaring coldly down. “You’ve been a thorn in my side for over a decade, you little cuss. I think I’ll leave you to die slowly.”
And Nia burst into tears. “I hate him,” she said, her voice sounding thick and shrill and ugly, and her stomach lurched. She put her hands to her middle. “I want to puke.”
The cacophony of honking, hissing, and the quacking of many distressed ducks drowned out the sound of one particular swan, which honked in utter disbelief when it saw them standing around the perimeter of the lake.
“Oh, uh,” Tony’s eyes flitted from Steve to the door to the stone floor and back again. “Sounds… sure, the drawing room, yes. Let’s…” He sprung to his feet, and Steve quickly looked him over, noting that he was slowly gaining back the weight he had lost, but that he still did not look much less sickly than before. His eyes still lacked the solidity they had had prior to his kidnapping, their bracing fire, and his mouth lacked the self-assured curl. Upon his return, he had completely shaved his face and Steve, oddly, found that he missed the elaborate beard Tony had been working on for the past few years.
“Oh,” the other man said, a large, ugly smile stretching across his face as he took another step towards Tony. “I make no such mistake. But you are wrong, Stark, to think that they will ever find you.”
It wasn’t like most divorces. Neither of them left. They didn’t stop working together, on whatever it was that happened in the laboratory with the hidden door, the one behind the bookshelf that Nia had found when she was eight but had never figured out how to gain access to. They simply weren’t married anymore.
Nia winced. "He won't be gone," she said. "He somehow managed to follow me from New York; he's not going to let the distance of a few hotel rooms get in the way."
“Why? Going to try and prove you can outsmart me when we’re both conscious? And don’t think I didn’t hear you making a dick joke at me in this highly public venue—”
The dining room-- what had been a dining room, when she was twelve-- wasn’t a dining room anymore. Years of family meetings and negotiations had necessitated that the one shared space in the house-- apart from the foyer and the secret room she wasn’t supposed to know about-- had become more of a conversational space, and there were now sofas and chairs and a wide coffee table.
Pepper blanched. “That means he is not able to come to us. What if Loki has done something else to him? … What if he has stolen his memory, and that is why he has not sought us out?”
Tony blinked up at him, surprise overriding his mirth. He looked at Steve’s hand, then up at him. “Will you tread on my toes?”
“Well,” Howard said. “You saw how things were going down there. If they know I’ve actually synthesized the element, they’re not going to let up; they’re going to want it. They’re going to try to weaponize it. And if it can power a city for ten years, imagine what it could do if--”
Steve, who’s terrified of spiders, and yet still had the presence of mind to waddle out into the hall to set his devious schemes in motion when the opportunity presented itself, confronted with just such a monster during his ungodly early morning shower. And really, who wouldn’t appreciate someone with such a cunning mind as that? Tony loves a sexy body, but he might fall in love with a sexy brain.
She hesitated, steeling herself, but this time she was prepared for the body inside its protective shell. She put her hands on the case and looked down.
He wanted Tony so desperately. He had always had him, had always had the luxury of turning him away – but now that he wanted him, he was gone. Now that he needed him whole and hale in his arms, no doubt making some sort of self-deprecating joke or deceptively intelligent comment about the mess Steve had made of all this… now that he could distinguish his desire for Tony from every other daily need he had, he was gone.
The prince did not open his eyes but folded his arms tightly over his chest. “It is possible,” he confirmed. “Loki escaped confinement over six months ago, and we have had no word of him since.”
Tony chimed in by rote, feeling a little gnawing of anxiety in his belly, and Natasha greeted him as officiously as usual. After their proper welcome, Lord Fury cast a slightly wary look over his shoulder at the two boys standing there – the brunet with his hands on his hips, head cocked attentively, and the blond with scowl still in full force and his twiggy arms folded. The castellan shook his head faintly and simply elected to say his goodbyes, leaving it to the children to make introductions amongst themselves.
“Lord Fury?” Steve asked, cautiously. Her face fell instantly, and that was enough of an answer for him. “Our friends, then,” he amended. “At dinner, tonight.”
Now, not quite eighteen, she put her cap on her head, using bobby pins to affix it-- not perfectly straight, but a little to one side, a little bit jaunty, a little cavalier. She smoothed the front of her jacket. There was a wide, blank space on the placket, where her star would go, the star that signified that she had graduated and become a full-fledged member of UNITY.
Graduation ceremonies were always the same. A moment of silence for those lost in the war, a moment of silence for those lost in the Stamford Incident, important-sounding, droning speeches by UNITY officials to begin, followed by some student who was probably going to get assigned to public relations, and then the assignments. No one actually cared about the speeches. They were mostly propaganda. Howard had given them a few times; they’d offered him a slot this year, but he’d turned it down, saying that he thought it was in poor taste to speak when his own daughter was graduating.
It earned him a chuckle, and a wonderful blush. Tony did not bother resisting the urge to run his hands up Steve’s arms from his wrists to his chest, feeling the thick new growth of muscle there. He squeezed Steve’s impossibly broad shoulders with only slightly feigned disbelief. “You aren’t even wearing shoulder padding!”
Maria’s eyes narrowed. “Why not?” she demanded. Her voice was slow, colder than her mother had ever sounded before.
Every night, Tony returned to his human body. But every morning, as soon as the sun rose over the horizon, he turned back into a swan. The change was indeed painful every time, though the pure, incandescent, unbearable agony of the first time had not yet repeated itself. It had not escaped Tony’s notice that the change was significantly less intense when he was closer to the lake, and he did his best to be on the water when the sun set each day.
,” he breathed, before launching forward to lay his hands on Tony’s shoulders. He ran his fingers along Tony’s ribs, from his protruding collarbones to his neck, then up to his gaunt face, trying to convince himself that the moment he had been dreaming of for so many months had finally arrived.
“Tony?” came Bucky’s voice from behind them, oddly tentative, and Tony curved around Steve’s shoulder to look at him, his eyes widening. He didn’t say a word, just stared at Bucky, then at Natasha, and Clint, who was half hovering nervously in the doorway and half glancing at Tony as if he could scarcely believe his eyes.
Tony blanched, and his hand lifted quickly from Steve’s body. Steve immediately felt the loss somewhere in his chest, and he had to force himself not to chase that warm, affectionate touch. Tony turned to the side, half of his face glowing with firelight, then turned away from Steve completely. They sat for a few minutes, and Steve had to watch Tony tremble slightly as he sought control.
“Mr. Stane,” said Dr. Yinsen. “With all due respect, we don’t know how many civilians are on their base; we need more intelligence before we--”
“There is no reason to split in two,” Steve was shouting at Clint on the main deck of their rather small craft, while the entire crew did their best to pretend they could hear nothing of it over the roar of the sea. Natasha watched from her perch in the shrouds over their heads. “Loki is the most powerful magic user on your list, with the most motive, and the timing of his escape is
They ate cold bologna sandwiches on rye bread with mustard, before Howard, looking uneasy in Maria’s half of the house, excused himself and shuffled off. He looked back at Nia before he walked out the door, but didn’t say anything, just stared at her for a long moment.
It was impossible not to notice Steve’s absence, which Natasha ended up addressing when Bucky started scowling at the empty space beside her.
Bucky returned the greeting and also expressed his delight with the new facial hair, before he squeezed Tony a little tighter in his arms – Natasha finally let out a truly displeased noise. The pair of them drew back to allow Sam through, and once he had thoroughly embraced Tony and petted his mustache questioningly and scolded him for being several days late, he drew back and Tony allowed himself to look up at Steve. There was another young man Tony did not recognize standing there with dirty blond hair, a cheerful grin, and a bow and quiver slung over his shoulder, but Tony only barely noticed him because of
Impulsively, she clutched at Maria’s shoulders and kissed her on the mouth--  something she hadn’t done since she was a small child.
Nia nodded and started for the door. Just before she reached for the knob, she stopped, took a breath, and looked over her shoulder. “Dad?” she asked. “Thanks.”
?! You’re Steve? Is this normal for you? With the face and the abs and the—” He gestured frantically at Steve’s entire body.
The scepter in his hand tipped immediately in Tony’s direction, and he had a moment—as the burning gem glowed white and red like glass pulled from a furnace, and Loki snarled a series of words he did not understand—to feel an all-encompassing terror. His death was imminent, and he barely even had time to acknowledge it. He had heard that a person’s life appears before them like a ballad of sight in the moment before they die, but he did not even have time for this.
He flopped gracelessly into the water of the creek, a moment of hope swelling in his feathered breast with the touch of the water – but there was no relief here. This cool water was not that to which he had been tied by a traitorous madman, and though its liquid cold was a balm against the surface pain, it did not seep and soothe deep inside him like the lake had done. He collapsed, letting his entire body sit in the slow water, resting on the smooth pebbles and gritty sand that made up the bed. Only his neck stayed outstretched, so that his head remained cushioned on the damp mud and soft grass of the waterside.
All evidence, therefore, indicated that the man currently holding Tony captive was indeed an Asgardian and, far worse, a magical one with no particular qualms about using his abilities destructively. How many of Tony’s people had this man killed to spirit Tony away to this place? Had he killed Bucky? Had he killed Tony’s parents in this wild scheme?
“We’ll talk about it on the way,” Howard answered. “Just--” he gestured at her bedroom. “Get packed. Say goodbye to your mother.”
Tony got to keep those letters though, with Steve’s determined, blocky hand and determined, blunt words. It was a poor substitute, but it was still a part of
“I’m going to live in the other side of the house,” Nia had answered, a little bit irritated that she’d been dragged all the way to the hospital for this, and had dressed up and everything. “I’ll see you in a week.”  She had thought bitterly that sometimes she’d gone much longer without seeing her mother, when her mother ran away to some far-off Territory to practice medicine in refugee camps, but by twelve, she knew enough not to say so to Maria’s face, even if she had sometimes felt a little bit like her mother spent more time caring about other people’s kids than she did about Nia.
She had peered at the newspaper on his desk; the cover story was about an execution, about a couple named Wendell and Heather Rand who had been accused of treason and conspiracy against UNITY. They had supposedly been transporting information to the Territories, though Nia had no idea what that meant, and they had apparently overstayed visas, been unaccounted for, supposedly had been seen conspiring with enemies of UNITY.
Tony, splayed out on his back on the couch, was staring sideways at him in what looked like utter shock. Once Steve stopped speaking, Tony got his elbows beneath him and pushed himself up into a sitting position, but not once breaking eye contact with Steve.
She understood it now, better than she had at twelve. But she had begun to understand where the cracks had come from, why her parents weren’t meant to be married. There they were, seemingly so similar, nearly identical, right up until that last sentence, where it turned out that their perspectives were entirely opposite.
Sometimes Clint went with them as well, and it turned out that Clint was a skilled trick rider. He was under oath not to attempt to teach Tony how to ride a horse backwards, sideways, balanced on his hands, or in any other questionably sane manner, no matter how much the prince needled. So that was how they found out another snippet of the former mercenary’s past: Clint had belonged to a traveling entertainment troupe for most of his life, which was the source of all sorts of bizarre talents.
he escaped,” Clint shouted right back. “Until we know whether or not he escaped before the attack, he's no more likely the culprit than the other two! All I know is that he made his alleged escape ‘recently’,” He threw his hands in the air. “That could mean he escaped last month, Steve, I don't know!”
"It's been years, Howie," Maria had answered, cutting him off before he could finish. "We could all use some closure."
And then the bird dove beneath the surface of the water. The glow followed, blocking out every glimpse of where the swan’s body touched the water of the lake. So all they could see was a rapidly expanding light dipping below the waterline, where it stayed and churned beneath the surface of the lake for several agonizing moments.
Tony sighed, but nodded. “I can work with that. So, what, I show up at the castle two nights from now, slip this on, and just walk into the great hall? Seems… worryingly simple.”
“But where?” Pepper asked, glaring at them all. “You said the castle was a wreck, and you searched it from top to bottom.”
In her head, she ran through so many things she could say. She could demand to know why she’d been refused an assignment. She could detail her impressive academic career. She could go on one of Howard’s lectures about patriotic duty or one of Maria’s lectures about the failure of the system.
But to ask these questions would betray several weaknesses Tony would rather keep close to his chest, all things considered, so instead he asked: “What do you want with me?”
“What happened?” Sam asked quietly, watching Steve from where he had curled up on the large windowsill. The last dregs of sunlight drifted down upon him even through the black and purple rainclouds hurling rain upon the castle, limning his face with a shimmering pale glow.
Maria rarely laughed, certainly not around Nia, or at Nia’s jokes. Now, she cackled gleefully. “Good,” she said. “If any of those reporters hound you, that’s what you tell them.”
For a while, he simply breathed, luxuriating in the feeling of not being in what felt like fatal agony.
Jim got his Air Force assignment, just as everyone expected, and he blew a kiss at Carol, who had thrown both hands up in the air and whooped amidst all the polite applause.
And to find out for certain, they would either have to ask very kindly and hope the royal representative of Asgard with whom they were soon meeting was accommodating – or else they would have to sneak into one of the most heavily guarded and technologically advanced buildings in the nine realms, break into their records vault, and find out by those means, or perhaps kidnap and torture the information out of someone. Though neither Natasha nor Clint were shy of hard work, there was a definite appeal to at least
,” he snarled again. “I don't care what it is you want. There is nothing you can do to me to make me change my mind.”
Then Steve heard it – a faint sound, metallic but loose, like chain links scraping together, and his breath caught.
a girlfriend, a perfect, tall, blonde girlfriend with muscles like a wrestler and a face like a fashion model. It had been her first real crush, her first crush on a real boy who wasn’t fictional or dead, and she’d sworn to hate Carol for as long as she lived. But hating Carol was impossible, when Carol called Nia up to go to the movies with her, when Carol begged her to join her for lunch, just the two of them, when Carol gave her a dress that ‘didn’t fit anymore,’ the kind of tight, red, dress Nia’s own parents would never have let her buy, the kind that didn’t even pretend to fit regulation.
Steve turned to gape at his friend, perched on the edge of his bed in the middle of removing his breeches. “Everything, Sam,” he managed. “We have everything to lose. I have everything to lose. Tony might be able to recover unscathed but I… I would be ruined.”
The moment she reached the window, one of them pointed, and all of the cameras swept upward, angled directly at her.
Steve grumbled a little, arguing that “it isn’t like that, Tony,” which it was, it totally was. Because they had long since taken to sleeping in the same bed (after Tony had reinforced it for Steve’s massive bulk), and it turned out that Steve made an
“Tony,” she said, sounding torn between scolding him and wanting to weep into his mantle. “I missed you, why did you not come?”
Tony had some choice thoughts about Sir Alexander’s needlessly dangerous training methods, but decided to keep them to himself. “I see you survived.”
He grinned down at Tony from where he was kneeling beside him, and there was no trace of the loyal family friend Tony had known in that smirking face. His eyes were cold, his smile chilling, and the realization of what was happening began to make its way through the cloud of pain in Tony’s mind.
“You okay, Steve?” he asked carefully. A moment later, Steve gave him a nod. After quickly glancing around to see if anyone was watching, Tony leaned in to say, quietly, “How long has it been since you’ve gone outside?”
Blood dripped from his sliced-open elbow onto the face of the amulet under Obadiah’s keen gaze. Tony did not know how long the pause lasted before Obadiah was apparently satisfied with what he had extracted. He smirked at Tony, dropped his arm heavy on his stomach, and unceremoniously pulled the amulet up and over Tony’s head.
Steve lifted his head reluctantly as Thor looked up at Bucky with large, guilty blue eyes. “I can do no more,” he said sadly. “I have only limited healing magic; a spell that keeps a parcel of my mother’s spirit within my breast. But I cannot break this terrible curse. It is not the wound that afflicts him now, but my brother’s machinations. Forgive me, Princess, Steven,” he nodded to both of them with pleading eyes. “I have done all I can do for him.”
Her mother’s assistant, the young, freckle-faced Miss Potts, had taken her for lunch in the hospital cafeteria, and Nia had gotten to eat pizza off a plastic tray and drink  chocolate milk from a paper carton. Plenty of doctors and nurses and other strange adults she didn’t recognize had come up to her and asked if she was Dr. Cerrera’s daughter, told her they’d seen her on television, asked her how old she was, and generally tried to make small talk, before Miss Potts had taken her back upstairs and buzzed her into her mother’s office.
It was too late for this. Or early for this. Maybe this was all a vivid, exhaustion-provoked hallucination. Wouldn’t be his first. Although the subject matter was certainly novel: apparently Tony had
The day after the feast was a somber one. The guests trickled away for the journey home after the morning meal, and finally Tony and his parents took their leave without too much ceremony.
The ease of so many years of friendship laying smooth and deeply fond between him and Natasha – that seemed to have all but disappeared. Tony drew away sharply when she attempted to kiss his cheek upon their departure the second day, and seemed genuinely unnerved, even
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve says as he passes. The words sound uncomfortable in his mouth—Tony’s name in particular—and Tony almost cringes.
The redheaded menace gave Jan a little smirk, effortlessly snatching her Three Musketeers out of the air. Half the room cheered while the other half booed—Tony, for one, had already complimented Nat on her “This is my Halloween costume” t-shirt, and was snickering into the top of Steve’s head.
“Hold him,” Fury ordered, and several guards, including a glowering Sam, darted forward to hold Stane in place while the man rolled his eyes.
His entire body ached, from a pounding headache in his temples to what he hoped was not a broken ankle. It took him several long moments to realize that he was on a thin straw cot, and that he had certainly not been in bed last he remembered. The memory of what had last happened to him was hazy, blurred somehow, and it took him a long while of lying very still and wishing his headache away before the memories began to trickle in.
Inside, fruit trees bloomed and a sparkling fountain shot water high overhead. Nia wanted to be in awe, but she couldn’t rid herself of the feeling that an entire block of the slum had taken up less space than the front lawn of the hotel.
The Dean shook his head and looked down at the envelope. “Tiberius Stone,” he recited. “Public Relations.”
“No sign of the escort!” Sam called back to Steve over the sound of the rain thudding all around them.
“Yeah, wasn’t expecting to be outed as a monster-f—lover in front of half of my class,” Tony joked. Judging by Steve’s wince, it maybe wasn’t as funny as he’d hoped.
Natasha gave her a piercing look, then darted her eyes to the man beside her for a split second in comprehension. “Not at all. Enjoy your rest.”
Jim. Jim Rhodes. She watched Jim on the stage, the picture of supreme confidence, grinning from ear to ear. Jim sought out Carol, scanning the audience before he winked, and then Nia, shooting her a thumbs-up.
“Nope,” Howard answered, shaking his head. “You synthesize a new element, you get to name it after your only child. That’s how it works.”
He lay there on the floor, waiting for his strength to return or for the pain to recede. But neither end came, and the wind outside just kept screaming louder and louder.
They had been in the carriage, on the road to the docks. His mother was trying to discern why he looked so melancholy after such a wonderful feast, and his father was berating him for looking forlorn in front of the princess – as if Natasha cared, at this point, about him keeping up appearances. Not that either of his parents were terribly up to date on his relationship with her, for all they would not stop talking and questioning him about it. Honestly, Tony was fairly certain they both thought he and the princess had been having sexual dalliances together for years, and he had to studiously remind himself not to think about his parents arranging for an eight-year-old and a five-year-old to spend their summers together in the hopes that they would get a head start on their conjugal obligations.
“No, Tony, no,” Obadiah said soothingly, and he started rummaging through a small pack he must have dropped earlier at Tony’s side. “I didn’t plan this. This is… plan number three, shall we say? I’m adaptable, after all, and who am I to let someone else’s plot to kill you go unused? I’ll admit,” he turned back to Tony with something in his hands, just out of Tony’s line of sight, and began fussing with Tony’s sleeve, clumsily rolling it up past his forearm. “This is more complicated than I really wanted. If those pirates had just killed you like they were supposed to… ah well. Then I had to wait for things to settle down, and even now it’s easier if you just appear to be an unlucky prince with foreign enemies. Otherwise your successor would have to answer so many
Steve was beautiful. For someone who had started out so scrawny and pointy, with that overly large hooked nose and a jaw so wide it looked misshapen on his otherwise straw-thin face and neck, he certainly had grown up to be a startlingly handsome man. His nose became proud rather than beaklike as his cheekbones widened and sharpened – and as he grew tall and muscular his square jaw simply looked as powerful as the rest of him. His shoulders had become even wider since Tony had last seen him, which he would not have thought anatomically possible. Steve’s eyes were the same as they had always been, though, ever since they were just children – bright blue and thickly fringed, piercing and oh-so-clever.
Her daughter, dressed in a surprisingly good Moana costume, continued to stare suspiciously at Steve for a few seconds before turning to give Tony the stink-eye. He grinned toothily down at her. Soon enough she apparently decided to accept that Steve was a monster for Halloween just like Tony was a vampire, and whirled around to skip towards the next house.
But now… now his mouth was parted unashamedly as Tony’s tongue flicked up against the exquisitely sensitive underside of his lip. Steve trembled with every pass, wanting to return the gesture but feeling too unsure. His bottom lip disappeared between Tony’s, burning sharply as Tony sucked on it with little finesse, and a grinding moan finally escaped Steve’s throat. Tony groaned in response, which was almost as arousing as the way his hands both shot up and clamped around the back of Steve’s neck so he could dive into another deep kiss.
“Thanks!” Tony replied, giving her two thumbs up, then pushed himself up on Steve’s back to bend over his head and grin at him upside-down. “See? Everyone loves your costume!”
Still, she thought, selfishly, they had made an exception for her assignment; maybe, maybe she was important enough to save.
“So I did,” Steve replies, crooking his head around the door and peering suspiciously down the length of his nose into the tub, then cursorily examining the rest of the small bathroom—as if Tony might be lying, and the spider might be crouching in wait for him behind the toilet or under the striped bath mat. Tony watches him inspect the terrain with a smile threatening at the edges of his mouth. After a moment, Steve turns his stare onto Tony, and a nervous little grin appears. “Should probably just get on with the day, really. I don’t think I’m ready to go back in the water just yet.”
She shook her head. “No,” she answered. “I had to sneak out. But I figured, military always ships out the day after assignments, so--”  she shrugged.
He tightened his grip on Tony—ow—and tensed up like he was about to flee mysteriously into the night.
Tony’s nose swept upwards, and was replaced by his lips. Touching ever so faintly on Steve’s burning skin, catching staccato as Tony dragged them slowly across Steve’s cheek to his ear. When he kissed the shell it felt like a shock of lightning, and when he drew the lobe into his mouth and
He tensed. “You say I'm the fool, and yet you’re the one who only wanted me after I became attractive to you.”
And she’d gotten older, and watched as her father invented weapons that let UNITY hunt out dissidents, the last traces of Hydra, hiding in caves, or the groups that had appeared since the Last War, dissidents like the Ten Rings and the January Rebels, who opposed the global government...and then watched Maria, never far behind, risking her life to save people who wanted her dead, practicing medicine in places that barely had running water, building prosthetic limbs and organs where Howard built bombs and guns. They were both inventors, each one of the greatest minds of their age, but Howard’s inventions visited destruction wherever he went, in the name of maintaining order, and Maria’s inventions healed, mended, mitigated all the chaos that was an ironic byproduct of Howard’s way of keeping order.
“Stalled out,” Howard answered. “That’s your progress report. Stalled out, and too unstable to use as a weapon, without risking the lives of good UNITY soldiers.”
Clint shuddered. “You mean, that man we just had dinner with, who I’ve gone riding with multiple times, who I let work on my armor the other day, who I let work on my
The others talked for a little while longer, but Steve only listened with half an ear. He turned Tony gently in his hold and then wrapped his arms securely around his waist, burying his face in Tony’s hair or the crook of his neck, feeling his heart beating and feeling Tony’s hands come up to grip his forearms.
“Nee?” Ty asked, looking down at her. “Can we...go somewhere? I need to talk to you.”   He looked up, his eyes searching, head turning toward the wooded area that backed onto the nearest house.
Tony grinned one last time, then patted Steve on the head as though he were a little child, and turned to get into his carriage. Steve bristled a little. He was not a child, and Tony was not allowed to treat him as such.
But Bucky did not respond. Panicked, Steve snapped his hand out to hover over the man’s mouth and nose, feeling his breath with a flood of relief and dropping his hand to clutch at the front of Bucky’s leather jerkin.
Yes, there was Lord Stane in the doorway of the second side hall, the one opposite Natasha’s, giving the signal to go ahead.
“Could it have been a landslide?” Steve yelled, making the slow, sloppy trek across the mud that did its utmost to consume his boots each time he stepped down.
There was silence as everyone tried their best to figure it out. If he was hurt, he couldn’t have gone far, but would he have gone to the castle, or elsewhere?
Because… Steve had no desire to ever live without Tony. And he knew he would never have to, since Tony was to wed Natasha one year from now, and officially unite their two kingdoms. Menahahte was small and quite self-sufficient, so Steve already knew that Tony planned to take up residence in Natasha’s lands and merely visit his own from time to time.
Steve felt like he’d been pushed into a trough of water, relief almost sticking his voice in his throat. “Tony? It’s… it’s me, it’s Steve.”
The man frowned, his lips drawing into a sneer. “Hardly.” Tony had a brief moment of relief before the stranger quickly crushed it back down. “I would not take you into my idiot brother’s domain, not with the use I have for you.”
Steve felt a sick rush of guilt when he thought of his friend. With his mind consumed by the question of Tony’s return and strange behavior, Steve had scarcely given himself time to worry over Bucky since their arrival. He hoped that Natasha and the others were seeing to his wellbeing, but he realized with a flood of shame that he did not know how his friend was faring. The last he had spoken to Bucky was the handful of tense words they had exchanged as they approached the castle several weeks ago. Bucky had clearly been avoiding Tony since then and, almost by extension, Steve himself. He must have therefore been spending the past several weeks upset about his role in Tony’s disappearance, blaming himself – and Steve had not been there for him.
Giving him a curious frown, Thor eventually nodded. “Yes, that is possible. But very difficult, unless you have sufficient expertise. Which,” he admitted after a moment. “My brother may very well possess.”
angry he was ignoring Tony completely. Part of the reason Tony loved coming to Natasha’s home was that she seemed to really like him as much as he really liked her, and he didn’t care that she was only practically a baby. She was smart and funny and mean, just like him, and she made him very happy. Nobody back home was nice to him like Natasha was nice, nobody talked to him like she did, or played with him, or argued with him.
“No, you don't,” Tony informed him, sitting up as straight as he could without wincing. He would stand, if he thought he would not immediately collapse from pain and weakness. “My people will come for me, make no mistake.”
He was a very handsome man indeed and, more importantly, the omnipresent scowl that seemed to be widely associated with Loki was entirely absent from his face.
It was therefore Clint’s horrified warning bellow they all heard while Natasha and Tony were sharing a long embrace.
“Hey,” Jim said, waving his fingers in front of her face. “Hey, Nee. You okay? You know we don’t care where they put you, right? You’re still
But another green-clad figure knocked Nancy to the ground. The gun went off harmlessly, and clattered to the patio, even as Nancy yelled again.
Tony laughed despite himself – and despite the little curl of hurt in his stomach, one he was not yet sure would ever go away at the mention of Steve’s name.
He grunted, and sucked in a breath. “I have to leave tomorrow,” he said. He brushed a fingertip over her clit, and her knees wobbled. She braced herself against the tree as he kissed her again, deeply, and pressed his erection up against her palm. “I don’t want to waste our last--”
She purred, pleased, then crushed his throat a little bit more to lean over and kiss his cheek, before finally springing off him and letting him stagger to his feet. Sam and Clint shouted eagerly about Tony having been taken down by a small, delicate princess, which only earned them Natasha’s attentions in his stead.
She looked fretfully out into the audience. Jim was staring, Carol was staring. Obie was standing in his seat, hands in fists, as if he was one breath away from starting a fistfight. Peggy was still seated, but she had a very dark look on her face. Miss Potts was walking from her seat toward the back of the amphitheater, away from the graduation.
Something hit in Steve’s gut which felt at once excited and terrified, and he quickly drew back behind the wooden wall, gasping in a breath.
They arrived at the party to very little fanfare. What few college kids weren’t utterly hammered by this late hour were well and truly in the Halloween spirit and made no comments to Steve that weren’t compliments on his “sick fangs, bro.”
“Then if we establish his alibi we can split up to search out the remaining two magic users!” Steve insisted.
Steve hardly realized he was beaming at Tony until Bucky elbowed him in return, with a bit of a laugh. They were both giddy with excitement and Sam, on Steve’s other side, was grinning from ear to ear. In the tradition of his homeland, Thor was standing and bowing to the princess as she entered, which she acknowledged with a smile and a faint nod. They owed a great deal to Thor, Steve thought, and he hoped that one day he might be able to pay the foreign prince back for his kindness and service.
Maria's expression tightened, hard and etched, a cold glare. "January's a myth," she said, through gritted teeth.
Nah. No need to be that paranoid. Tony settled for pouting just a little and kicking disconsolately at Steve’s shin until Steve flicked him and glared.
He put a hand against the heavy weight of her hair, pressing his face into the vibrant copper curls and almost wondering himself why he had tried to give this up. “I was ill, I'm sure they told you.”
“I really am sorry…” says the vision in front of him, starting to gently and charmingly shift his weight from foot to foot. (Sadly, he seems to think better of it when the towel slips tantalizingly low on his hipbones and has to be immediately grasped in the name of public decency.)
Howard simply stared at her, hard, for a long time. He opened his mouth to speak, then shut it again, and made a chewing motion with his mouth, as if he were literally  ruminating on his words.
He had never admitted his feelings to Tony aloud. He had never had the courage. Now he refused to lose the chance to cowardice. He had spent enough years in that particular prison.
“What exactly the problem is,” Steve finished for her, and she tipped her head slightly in agreement. “But what is there to do? The wedding is in less than a week’s time, and we can hardly accuse Loki or
With a deep breath, Nia got up and walked out of her bedroom. She stopped at the door, and looked back at it-- at her pile of messy blankets on her bed, at the half-assembled robotic arm on her dresser, at the prosthetic heart schematics she’d been looking over for her mother, at the trail of hardware strewn across the carpet. She ran her thumb over the bandage on her index finger from the little soldering iron burn she’d given herself the night before, building a model of her mother’s design. She hadn’t finished it, yet. She wasn’t sure when she was going to. It lay on the desk in pieces, the chambers of the heart open to the elements.
The rest was muffled again in Steve’s chest. As he curled protectively around Tony, Steve’s entire body was shaking, but whether it was with relief or ecstasy he had no idea. Tony was here. Tony was home, he was free. Natasha jumped up and plastered herself against Tony’s back, and that was apparently permission for the entire motley group to leap over and join in the embrace. Tony and Steve were trapped in the midst of them all, laughing like fools and kissing every time their mouths passed each other with all the jostling.
The next day the others announced a hunting trip, and though Steve was desperate to take off as soon as possible, he knew it would only raise questions and more danger for all of them if they let anyone know they thought something was amiss. So that afternoon they took off into the forest as casually as they could manage. The most difficult part of getting on the road with haste turned out to be getting Bucky on horseback in the first place, after he had missed the entire conversation over dinner the night before, and the resultant series of revelations. Through a combination of Steve’s manhandling and Natasha’s cajoling, Bucky was extracted from his room soon enough, and by sundown they were flying down the roads back to the abandoned castle, in the desperate hope that they would not be too late.
There was a moment of dismayed silence before Sam, who seemed to be familiar with the original tale, guffawed loudly. “You're a horrible storyteller, Your Highness.”
“And I don’t have anybody else to talk to,” she added quietly, tapping on the icy floor with her fingers. She shivered, pulling her jacket more tightly around herself, and leaned her head back against the case. “My boyfriend was getting date-rapey, my friends are all leaving, my parents...well, you know my parents. I mean, I guess...they listened more today than they usually do, but we’ll see what they do when there’s no more crisis, yeah? They’re both really good at emergencies, but the rest of the time…”
“James?” Natasha said, softly. This was not the first time they had been disappointed by the unfulfilled promise of his emergence from sleep. “James?”
It almost would have been easier if Steve had remained the drifting Crown ward – and yet Tony would never wish to take from him his position as Sir Alexander’s squire for anything, least of all Tony’s passing comfort.
For a moment, Pepper visibly struggled with herself, obviously wanting to believe him but feeling nonetheless wary. “We must find out if the problem is with his memory or… something else.”
He lost his train of thought when Bucky disappeared around a corner, into what turned out to be a short hallway with a closed door at the end of it.
Even having expected it, Tony chokes on his coffee. Steve laughs brightly at him, and this is hands-down the weirdest, greatest first date Tony has ever been on. It’s still pretty much dark outside, they haven’t even started their coffees yet, and he already can’t wait for the next time they meet up. He beams over at Steve, who is flushed and actually not wearing it very well, all ruddy and flustered—which is even more endearing than his general perfect gorgeousness. Tony smiles at him as un-sappily as he can, under the circumstances.
“I’ll...I’ll find something,” she said, shutting her eyes as she brushed the back of her hand against the impossibly soft silk.
The situation may have been more manageable if it weren’t for one critical detail. Which was the fact that Tony was not respecting Steve’s unspoken plea to pretend as if their affliction did not exist. For as much as Steve found himself staring at Tony, watching him speak and gesticulate cheerfully, listening to his voice and ideas, seeing him kissing Natasha affectionately upon the knuckles and forehead, shoving playfully at Bucky and Clint, arguing joyously with Sam, or even just sitting around lackadaisically and scribbling in his notebooks – for all of the time Steve was looking over at Tony, Tony was looking back at him.
Natasha brushed past a shock-frozen Steve and held out the handkerchief with Thor’s own amulet inside it. Thor immediately pulled the fabric aside and turned to dip the amulet in the water, brushing frantically at its surface with the handkerchief, digging the silk into each and every crevice as he did his best to remove all traces of blood from it.
Bucky wore his affections upon his sleeve, and to put him in a room with her and another man seeking her hand would be pure foolishness. Steve deflated slightly – because he surely realized that if Bucky could not go, neither of them could, and it would therefore truly be best for them to seek out Amora and Killian. If he insisted on going with Natasha, he would only be leaving Bucky behind, either alone or with Sam, which she knew he could scarcely stand the idea of for fear of what might happen to Bucky.
She bit her lip, still expecting him to wake up, to say something. When he didn’t, she turned her back to him, leaning on his box as she slid to the floor. “Today
The reporter gritted his teeth. "Miss Cerrera-Stark is eighteen," he answered. "She's graduating from school. You can't deny us access anymore."
Natasha froze mid-chew for an infinitesimal moment before resuming as if nothing was amiss, while Pepper glanced at Steve and Clint and Sam outright gaped at Tony.
“If you try it—” Tony notes, looking Steve’s bulk up and down out of the corner of his eye as he quickly locks his apartment door. “—I’ll go down like cotton candy.”
Tony half-turned to give him a grave look. “‘Painful’ is one word for it.” Then he jolted, and his gaze sharpened over Steve’s shoulder, to where Bucky had soundlessly retreated to give them space as Tony had sprinted out of the lake. Tony’s eyes went wide and a look of shattering hope spread over his face. “Bucky?” He blinked. “Bucky – you’re alive!”
—Tony has an almost manic grin on his face, he’s sure, since he can’t possibly help it. But from somewhere small and desperate, too scarred over to let this person he likes turn around and whip the rug from beneath his feet without at least
, she mentally corrected, though she wasn’t quite sure, really, what to call this. She watched his face, watched his long, golden eyelashes, waiting for them to flutter, to show signs of life.
The very thought sent anxiety skittering down his spine, but he forced himself to consider it because… he could not trade his emotions for Tony for his emotions for his dead ma, he simply could not. And, if marriage really was no more than a contract designed for a cold, practical purpose—especially something as direly impersonal as a political union—what meaning did it truly have? What sanctity? Because right now, Steve felt that the love and loyalty he had towards Tony were far purer and richer than any ceremony that required little more than signatures on a piece of paper to have any meaning.
“This is a terrible,” she told herself, rubbing at her face with one hand, “place to fall asleep. Stop it, stop…”
When he reopens the door a brief moment later, wearing jeans and a jacket over a reasonably clean Guns N’ Roses t-shirt, glasses-b-gone contacts in and hair more or less tamed, Steve is still standing obligingly at attention. Tony grins up at him and gestures out into the hallway. “Lead the way, fair damsel.”
A blaze of light arced from the gem into the center of Tony’s chest, shoving him over the surface of the cot and into the wall behind with a painful thud.
“There’s news the Rand boy is in New York,” said the man who had greeted them. “No confirmation yet, but if his crowd is spoiling for a fight--”
When he did, he was not remotely as either of them had anticipated, based upon physical descriptions they had been given of his brother.
“I want to see her,” said a female voice, fierce and demanding. “I’m not listening to anything you say until I see my daughter.”
“That wasn’t a request,” Tony said firmly. He turned around and flipped on the overhead lights, then walked into the middle of the main room and stood with his arms folded, tapping his foot loudly. “Out you come, Colossus.”
Steve nodded. “Thor, you lead. Take out the door. Pair up: Sam stays on guard with Thor outside. Sam, lake-side, Thor meadow. Nat with Clint, Bucky with me, looking for a dungeon or any locked chamber. If Tony’s being kept in there it’ll probably be underground. If Loki is in there, he is likely armed and deadly. Use necessary force. On my mark.”
She had to hold onto them, to keep them afloat, and she turned them to face her, so she could clear the fluid out of their mouth, too.
“Your replacement,” he clarified, petting the long stretch of Tony’s neck. “Seventh son of Lord Hammer, one of your princess’s barons. A pathetic, power-hungry little man. He has his uses though – when I stage your death a few months from now I’ll be able to use him again. Until then, of course, he’ll be in the lowest bowels of the castle in Menahahte. As soon as we’re on home shores I’ll take over the role of newlywed prince, wait for things to calm a little before abdicating. You know, I served your father for over twenty years, and when he died he left me nothing? I quite like you, Tony; it’s a shame it’s come to this. And a shame that you involved Pepper…” he sighed. “I would have preferred that she lived.”
Though some members of the group were adamant that the Tony impostor be thrown immediately into a prison cell, pending interrogation (and the most creative punishments they could come up with between them), Natasha reminded them all that not only was the impostor working within her castle, but an unknown traitor was there somewhere as well. There would be no point in letting said traitor know that they suspected anything until Tony was safely in their hands once more.
He had slipped into Natasha’s chambers while she and their three other friends were eating supper – the meal was quickly forgotten.
No further clues had appeared to them, however, so they had taken to simply searching every spot around Loki’s last known location that may have been of any value to a man with a prisoner. Meanwhile, they set about making Loki’s sneering face one of the most well-known sights in the land and the adjacent realms, attempting to cut him off at the ankles were he to attempt to simply relocate as they latched upon his trail.
And this was the last night she wanted to get caught sneaking back, not after everything else that had happened that day.
He wasn’t actually her uncle. He was her father’s partner; the one who had the head for business and politics so that Howard could stick to the important work of inventing. A good ten years younger than her father, he’d been young when the Last War ended, and he’d always just seemed to
, a rich brown color at the roots but lighter, more golden at the ends of the hairs and on the guy’s extremities. Tony’s gaze dropped from his hairy face to his hairy hands, still raised in surrender, and then his hairy feet—all of his digits tipped with great big black claws—, then back up to the horns protruding from his temples and twisting back over his skull.
Ty pulled his cap from his head. “I should find my parents,” he said. “There has to be something we can do; we-- if they think for one second I’m going to protect their corrupt bureaucratic asses--”
“Fine,” said Howard. He pushed the door at the far end of the hall open, and held it for Nia. "I am leaving for the Northeastern Territories tomorrow; it's as good a task as any for you to take until we decide what to do with you."
“We suspected,” Pepper said, giving him a quelling look. “Surely you also knew something was amiss.”
She took a quick shower, lamenting that she didn’t have time to luxuriate in the gigantic tub, dressed, and went to meet her father.
“He’s probably very grateful he has a shirt at all,” Howard said. “You’re being too softhearted; you sound like Maria. If you help one of them, they’ll all want help, and they’ll-- they’ll get vicious, if they think you have something to give. There are better ways to help than just handing out money.”
Tony started for the door, then reeled to a stop and looked back at Steve. “Why don’t you lead the way, big guy?”
He was provided for largely by a man he soon learned was called Yinsen, whose wife and children were being held against him in some way by Loki – he did not give details, and Tony was not eager to ask.
“But Nat said it wasn’t a duck,” Clint said, peering suspiciously down at the drawing in the middle of the table.
Steve obligingly took the lead, and fought down the insistence of his heart that he take Tony’s hand. He wanted to thread his fingers through Tony’s and feel their distinctive patterns of callouses from his work in the forge, and in the mystical Workshop he spoke of in his home castle. He wanted to lift that hand to his mouth and kiss each of its knuckles, the pads of Tony’s fingers, the center of his palm; press his lips to the pulse point on the inside of Tony’s wrist and see if the skin there was as soft as it had always looked.
characters—they seemed to be missing a Chewbacca, and maybe Steve wanted to volunteer?—when there was a child’s shriek from off to the right.
“Can’t you give me a hint?” Nia asked, and she bit down on her lip, then reached for her glass of ice water.
Knowing that Steve preferred to go last and decidedly without an audience, both Bucky and Sam jumped forward to greet Tony as well, crowding Natasha out of the way and ignoring her threats (she was grinning, so they were probably safe). Bucky was his usual very undignified self and poked interestedly at Tony’s new mustache, which led Tony to grin and pretend to bite at his finger. Sam clapped Tony warmly on the shoulders and exchanged some quiet words, and before Steve knew it they had all retreated.
, however, going to show up in the newspapers,” said Maria, though she didn’t look angry. She put a hand to Nia’s shoulder. Nia glared at the floor and shrugged her off.
“I’m going to make you a new one,” he promised, giving Bucky a little shake. “The best damn arm you’ve ever seen. Built-in armor, perhaps a small crossbow mechanism. Maybe a hidden compartment for a dagger or two, or snacks—”
Steve felt sick. Even just looking at the carriage… it must have tumbled down the decline, spinning and flipping before it finally landed in this place, wedged up against a large tree it had not had the force to dislodge. With numb legs he continued forward, approaching the carriage and watching his hand shake as it reached out to pin the door open against the side panel.
“Tony!” Jan screamed from the front room, over the music, sitting on the shoulders of a huge guy Tony didn’t recognize through his Batman costume.
“He’s all yours,” Nia replied, grinning tightly, as she ducked out of the way and back to her own room.
“We have to find the carriage,” Steve said, noting how remarkably even his voice had come out, when he felt like his entire body was trembling with fear.
“Which means Tony must have been there,” Sam said, horrified. “He was there at the castle while we were there.”
The carriage had traveled a long way down into the gully, but even at his careful pace Steve reached it within a few minutes. The carriage was upturned, with three of its four enormous wheels ripped off and strewn along the path it had created. The remaining wheel spun slightly in the wind, rattling against its axle from where it had almost joined its brothers. The carriage door was swinging open, slamming closed and then flinging itself away again as the wind whistled through the trees and did its best to tear the door free entirely.
“I’m nowhere near the lake!” Clint snarled at it, kicking at it periodically without actually trying to hurt it. “I’m not in your territory! Leave me alone!”
Tony had only once been exposed to magic, as a young child; when the Asgardian Queen Frigga visited his home on a state tour. He had been all of four years old at the time, and had been playing with Rhodey out in the gardens as Queens Maria and Frigga were walking together along the flowerbeds. With a startled cry, he had tripped over an uneven patch and fallen hard along the cobbled path. His mother had cradled him to her chest, fussing over his torn-up knees and palms, while Rhodey hovered, the slightly older boy still ill at ease around Tony’s very prim and unforgiving mother.
Then what? The grinding, stinging pain of the transformation had taken up in his body like it had replaced the marrow of his bones, and then there was the knife to contend with. The great hall where the wedding was being held was a steep uphill trek from this storehouse.
“Did you miss me?” Tony demanded, seated on one of Steve’s thighs and balancing an elbow on his shoulder. His fingers were in the perfect position to stroke softly through the fur of Steve’s neck.
“I like him,” Bucky said sleepily from his bed, a few feet away from Steve’s. His voice was muffled, since his face was mashed comfortably into his blanket and pillow.
Steve managed quite skillfully to avoid ever being left alone with Tony, even as he remained at Natasha’s side at every waking—and some sleeping—hours. Tony looked more handsome and appealing than Steve remembered, which he would not have thought possible except it seemed to happen every year. Tony’s burgeoning whiskers of the last few summers had now become a fully-fledged mustache, accompanied by a beard which was artfully crafted to obscure the fact that his facial hair did not grow uniformly upon his chin.
“Your mother is an extraordinarily talented woman,” Obie agreed. “The leaps and bounds she’s made in organ transplant technology, in prosthetics...it’s just as incredible as Howard’s work. I think you’ll make your parents proud whichever direction you go.”
“Are you certain?” Sam asked carefully. “It doesn't look all that necessary from where I'm standing.”
"It's really him," she said. She pressed a finger to the plastic, as if she could feel him from this side, as if she expected him to respond, to shift or stir. She looked at her mother, shaking her head. "But he's only a little younger than Howard!  How is he so young?"
Tony, of course, insisted upon sailing over regardless. But his ship was attacked, as feared, by an unidentified, possibly-Asgardian patrol vessel, which refused to allow them passage across the neutral waters of the Midgardian Sea. Steve and the others received word of this many weeks after it happened, since the war meant getting messages to and from the neighboring kingdoms was becoming practically impossible. It took a few more weeks still to get word from Menahahte that the prince had returned home safely from what turned out to have been a band of pirates. Steve spent most of those weeks picking fights with anyone and everything he could.
Tony and Steve remained alone together in the room in silence, and Tony was all but ready to make like the rest of them and flee like a frightened partridge, when Steve sighed expansively and peeled himself from the large armchair he had been sitting in. Tony was seated on the floor in front of one of the low chaises, where Natasha had been preening his hair with her fingers, so there was a brief moment before Steve sat on the opposite chaise that he was towering over Tony. Never before had Tony thought to be nervous around Steve, but the other man was much larger than Tony, far stronger, trained in combat, and—most unnervingly—not acting at all like himself.
Clint slammed both his palms down on the table, hard enough to rattle the cutlery. “Thor. Could you disguise a person as something not a person, you know, with magic?”
There was one more room in the castle that was locked, and even with all the time he had Tony simply lacked the expertise to pick its ancient, complex lock. Without being able to access that last room, he had read every book, scroll, and carving in the place several times over, often losing himself in his escapism and only recalling his curse when the telltale fire started burning in his bones. Sometimes he would make it out to the water before the shift ended, sometimes he would not.
The two attackers were now on her-- martial arts had never held her interest, and she wished now that it had, as they were both much larger, much stronger, and one of them held her down and tried to cover her mouth.
Maria blinked. “I don’t think he can hear anything,” she answered. “His brain doesn’t register any kind of--”
This time, Nia had rolled her eyes again, but she had answered her father. “I know,” she said. “I know, I know. It’s because I’m a woman.”
“Tony, I love you. I do. I’ve loved you for years, so much it frightened me, and I’m sorry for letting it scare me away. You’re so brave, Tony, so kind and generous and I love you so much. If I could, I would marry you a hundred times, I would stay with you for the rest of my life if you wanted me. Please Tony, please don’t leave me. I love you, please.”
“No,” Nia had answered, honestly. There were too many things she liked, too many things she was good at, and the idea of picking just one had always left her cold, even though she knew it would happen, someday.
“Tony,” the guy said yet again, turning his hands so that his palms faced upwards and spread out slightly. “Don’t freak out. It’s me. It’s Steve, I’m Steve, I swear.”
Nia shook her head. “I thought it was because one of you had an ancestor named Anthony or Antonio or something.”
At Steve’s signal, Thor leapt from the bushes they’d sheltered behind like a great wild boar, his powerful legs thundering beneath him across the dewy grass to the castle, with the others streaming in his wake. He reached the enormous main door of the structure and, hardly slowing, spun tightly on nimble feet and smashed his hammer through its decrepit wood. As Natasha had predicted, the door splintered instantly and Thor shouldered aside what remained of the frame just in time for Steve and Bucky to leap through into the castle, Natasha and Clint right behind them.
“Yeah—yeah, sure,” comes the flustered response, followed by the sound of bare feet padding away towards the kitchen, then padding quickly back.
“No assignment,” the Dean repeated. His tone was patient, matter-of-fact, as if it were the most normal thing in the world to
were some impressive fangs.) He rolled his eyes and removed the vampire teeth for now, sequestering them back in his wine-red waistcoat. “You be quiet. Get your cape and let’s get out of here before we’re late.”
“Okay, you see,” Tony snapped. “That is exactly the kind of bullshit that I’m telling you not to try on me. I am an engineer, not a magician. If you’re trying to—”
?” she said, scowling at the photographer, who was still clicking away as she tried to sort out the mess of her hair.
“You must be Lady Pepper,” Natasha said, ignoring Tony entirely. “Tony speaks as if you were an angel descended to our mortal realm.”
“Complicity… Steve…” Tony sounded lost. “I want you. I'm… I'm sorry I'm not what you wish I was, but this is who we are and this is what we have been given. I have been given you in my life,” His hand left Steve’s thigh and reached upwards, but he was too far away to touch Steve’s face like he clearly wanted to. The hand dropped gently to Steve’s stomach instead, his thumb resting on Steve’s clothed navel and his fingers curling around his side. “If you want me, you have me.”
She closed her hand around his cock mechanically, reflexively, and he sighed softly, and slid a finger inside her. She wobbled again; it was hard to stay upright against the tree.
There was a sudden racket from inside the room: a great squeaking of the bedframe and some scraping sounds, then two loud
The music stopped suddenly as Natasha turned on the stool to face them all, and Steve and Tony broke apart as if they had been pulled by invisible ropes.
Quick, light footsteps announced Natasha’s arrival, and she shoved Steve unceremoniously out of her way before whipping out the lock-picking kit she carried on her thigh and set to work. Steve didn’t know how long it took, but it felt like an hour before the lock clunked obligingly and the door swept open.
“Mr. Stark is concerned,” Obie put in. “And I understand his concern. Let’s not all forget what happened the last time he was put in charge of rebuilding something from Hydra schematics.”
“You want me to believe that you’re Steve,” he demanded, pointing at the guy with an accusatory finger. “The giant poofy monster who I found under my bed and who makes me drink disgusting green protein shakes after forcing me to do a workout every day? That Steve?”
“Well, you're not wrong,” came a voice from Steve’s left, where his hearing was still a little spotty after the small accident in the stables a few years back.
“You are most welcome, Prince Tony,” she sassed, before kissing him on the cheek and leaving for bed, soon followed by the others now that the evening’s grand excitement appeared to be over.
She looked back at Jim and Carol, who were staring affectionately into each other’s eyes and whispering, and figured she could give them the time alone.
She opened her eyelids just slightly, so that her eyelashes were still brushing against each other, and turned the knob.
“There’s money on it,” Obie said, as he walked up behind them both. He gave Peggy a kiss on the cheek, rested his hands on his hips. “Tell me you don’t read the news.”
The row ahead of them rose. Nia straightened up-- it was Jim's row, and he glanced back, shooting her an eager grin. She nodded, and hoped her nod looked reassuring. In reality, the closer they came to her own assignment, the more frightened she felt. She wished she'd said something in her exit interview, anything. She could get stuck with something she really hadn't wanted, or they would put her in surgery with Maria and Howard would be convinced she'd chosen it to spite him. It would all go sideways on her, and this was the rest of her life-- well, at least four years until she could appeal, after her mandatory service was complete. But appeals were rarely granted; by then, you were four years behind your peers, and there were few individuals who could catch up.
“Stop it?” she asked. “You were trying to stop them from not assigning me? Or…”  She sniffled, shook her head, looked from one parent to the other.
A frisson went through the air – a spark of excitement and expectation, and for a moment Steve could not tell whether it originated with him or with the man sitting stock-still on the couch before him. Tony looked down, rubbed his hand across his chest, his entire body bunching with nerves…
that room had been-- behind her. It was plain, unadorned, apart from a set of hooks bearing two long coats.
“Is there any truth to the rumor that your assignment was postponed because of a quarrel between your parents?”
. Since I’m leaving to work for UNITY... I sent that film to forty of our affiliate channels. With instructions to air it only at my say-so.”
Her friends would be on the beach; she knew that much. It was a long walk from the house, but she was full of nervous energy, and the summer air was warm but comfortable, a cool breeze blowing in off the coastline.
He had fine golden hair, and she wondered, as she looked at how it curled just behind his ears, at his smooth skin, if her parents had to shave him, if they gave his hair a trim now and then.
“Could you disguise someone,” Clint continued, his eyes sparking with disbelief at the words coming out of his own mouth. “As an animal?”
She had the faint memory of being carried, and then of rumbling beneath her, and voices-- two men, and a woman, and then nothing, nothing, darkness, nothing, followed by vivid dreams rich in detail: sights and sounds and scents and contact all heightened to surreality.
“But--but everyone gets an assignment,” she said, her voice trembling. “I...I’m first in my class. In...in
“For the deaths of King Howard and Queen Maria, yes, Your Highness, I'm afraid that is so,” Clint nodded.
He froze with a morsel of cheese partway to his mouth when he realized this, and Sam was instantly concerned. Steve brushed away his friend’s worry as best he could, but when the overly perceptive Sam refused to let the moment drop, even with Thor sitting right there, Steve gave him the only piece of reassurance he could. “After tonight,” he said. After tonight, hopefully things would change for the better around the castle. Steve would make an effort with Bucky, who still needed him. Not to mention how badly Steve found himself needing his friend, too.
She prodded her own thumb in the air and grinned. But she felt like her smile was stretched too wide, like she was gritting her teeth down too hard.
The castle was dim inside but light enough to see by as the weak sun poured over the walls. It was not a large structure, and the entry hall they found themselves in had three exit points on each of the other walls in the form of towering archways. Considering what they had seen of the layout from outside, Clint and Natasha ran for the archway at the far wall while Steve and Bucky steered right. They could see instantly that they had chosen the correct path. Right before them was a sharp turn to the left followed by a straight staircase down, which was not the best defensive design, but Steve deduced that this castle was so old it had been before the spiral staircase had come into standard use. Steve took the lead as they made their way down the stone steps, where the sunlight began to falter and darkness was creeping in all around.
She sat down on the other sofa, clasping her hands between her knees. She realized, belatedly, that she could take off her jacket, too, and she tossed it over the side of the sofa, breathing in, feeling less stuffy in her plain white tee shirt.
Tony’s face sharpened, and he ignored Steve’s hand to meet his gaze. He searched Steve’s face for a long moment, before his arms dropped to his sides and he walked forwards. Their hands slipped into each other’s like they had done only once before, and Steve allowed Tony to lead again this time. He was not sure he was capable of much higher thought than simply following along. They bypassed the standard dancing position for social events, leaving Tony’s hand warm in Steve’s own, the other a tantalizing press on his back. Tony’s body was oh-so warm through his clothing, and Steve clenched his other hand helplessly in the fabric at his shoulder. They swept around the room in silence for a few steps, before Tony began to hum a gentle tune in his rumbling voice, pulling Steve into a new dance.
The cold air was rushing into the hall, fast, and Nia swore as she realized she had to choose between warmth and light.
“Great,” Steve replied, decidedly unenthused but surrendering himself to being Tony’s ride for the foreseeable future.
Obie said it kindly, defensively, looking loyally up at Howard, but the response in the room was a rising murmur.
felt the deep thrill of fear at the reckless speeds they reached. Tony always ended up beaming and bright-eyed, Bucky frantically and fruitlessly scolding both him and Steve. Honestly, Steve thought a little terror was worth it.
“What?” Nia asked. “Because I said spit?”  She stepped up on her tiptoes, licked his face. “Come on, get a sense of humor, Captain.”
would be there, Peggy who had filled in for her mother on so many occasions. It had been Peggy who’d bought her her first razor, her first package of tampons, who had taken her shopping for a stylish dress for her first formal dance.
Slowly, he opened his eyes. He was upon an enormous lake, glowing with the light of the dying afternoon sun and shimmering beautifully in the gentle breeze. To his side was a small, ancient castle ruin, which he could only assume was where he had been kept by Loki. The first thing he wondered was if Loki had lied, and he was in fact in the magical realm of Asgard. For everywhere he looked, he could see brilliant flashes of colors he had never seen before, and which he scarcely had a name for.
Of course, Tony chose that moment to mutter something completely muffled into the shoulder of Steve’s jerkin.
Steve held him closer to his chest, kissing his hair despite the frankly terrible pondy smell of it, and Tony pressed right back, not wanting to be separate from Steve any more than Steve was willing to let him go.
The day of the wedding dawned unseasonably cold but otherwise unremarkable. As was tradition for the royal family, the ceremony was not to take place until after the sun had set, which left them with many long hours to spend in preparation and worry. Steve eventually had to be sent down to the kitchens to help with preparations for the feast, because his restlessness was not only beginning to grate on the others’ nerves, but threatened to give away that they knew something was wrong.
“That has nothing to do with it,” Steve snapped. But the question stuck in his skin: Tony had asked him almost the same one.
“Other men would find this position very enticing,” he mused to her, spitting sand off his tongue with a series of little
Sure there were long looks and awkward silences, but also venting and arguments and make-up hugs, surprise dinners and gifts, impromptu snuggling while watching movies, and all those things that—in Tony’s admittedly lacking experience—smacked of couple-dom.
“Steve,” Thor repeated, not relenting in the slightest. “Forgive me, my friend, but I do not think it wise to go out onto the lake. My brother may have enchanted it in some way, set up a trap of some sort. We must wait, we must wait and see what the bird does. We cannot even be certain that it is your friend.”
She scanned the heads of the retreating guests for someone she recognized, anyone. It was easy enough to spot Miss Potts’ bright red hair, and she started after her mother’s assistant at a  jog.
Startled and befuddled, Tony glanced down at his costume, having already forgotten what he was wearing. And okay, without the fangs, which had fallen into his drink quite some time ago and been abandoned to their fate… he maybe looked a little like a gender-bent ghost-Belle. Maybe. A little. What with the brown ponytail and pasty-white makeup and gold pseudo-Regency getup. And, uh, especially considering his companion for the evening.
Well, that at least solved some of Tony’s concerns. They would not, after all, have to worry about how such an arrangement would work if Steve was unwilling to be involved in the first place. Tony forced all of his hurt and pain into a tight ball of iron in his gut, offering Steve a decent approximation of a grin. “Good to know. Good. I suppose that's over with, then. Friends?”
military air about her, from the way she stood straight at attention with her hands folded behind her back.
“And Maria wants me to go save babies with her,” Nia answered, shrugging. “Either way, somebody’s going to be disappointed. But I’d rather it be because my aptitude lies elsewhere than because I had to disappoint them.”
She shut the encasement again, and grimaced. “I’m gonna...I guess I should actually talk to my parents and see what they’ve tried, yeah? That’s probably, uh--”
“As far as I can tell,” said Doctor Yinsen. “We’re in the Hydra base. You…”  He went quiet.  His face was ashen; his expression grim. “You were knocked out. Something’s happened to you, but I think it would be best for you to hear it from the doctors.”
. With an orange bill, crested with a black knob beneath beady black eyes, a long, thick white neck, a rounded body covered all over in what appeared to be feathers glowing white in the dregs of the sunlight and, not to forget, two enormous panic-ruffled wings flaring up behind him in alarm.
“You're so graceful on the sands,” Tony was gasping between laughs, and Steve was likely a shade of burgundy at this point. “How can you be such a terrible dancer?”
The next thing she knew, Ty was clasping her hand again, and they were on their feet, moving toward the stage. She couldn’t breathe; she was going to collapse, she just
cross when Bucky and Tony finally found him. They had to appease him with a delicious, freshly roasted apple they’d finagled from the head cook.
Maria had said some other things to her, and Nia had bobbed her head when she thought it was best to acknowledge what Maria was saying, and had gone home, and moved into her new bedroom.
“Remember how you sucked my cock and let me come all over your ugly little face?” Ty asked, his voice whisper-soft.
Nia thought back, to all the nights in her own childhood when her parents had vanished, to all the time she’d spend wondering what they did in that secret room, and shook her head, pursing her lips together. “No,” she said. “I can’t imagine.”
"Oh?" Nia asked, and it felt as if the capsule against her chest became a little bit warmer at Nancy's admission.
Nia slumped back, as if she could shrink into the leather seats of the fancy car. “Fine,” she answered. She tried to sound nonchalant, but it came out hollow.
Steve smiled almost against his will at the sight of the feared archer heroically facing off against an agitated bird. Clint forced it back onto the lake, where it flapped in what seemed to be surprise, and then suddenly subsided, looking up at Clint and letting out one last petulant honk.
Offended by the rock-like surface he was apparently supposed to sleep on for the next four years, Tony resigned himself to sleeping on the couch until a new mattress could arrive. It would be worth it if he could actually get a good night’s sleep. He flung himself up and bounced on the bed a few times to see if he could break it in a bit, and maybe a little bit out of spite for its betrayal.
She pressed her hands against the ground, the earth yielding under her fingers, and started up, when she caught, in the corner of her eye, light reflected off something running horizontally along the wall of the house-- completely obscured from the lawn by the bushes.
“Target eliminated,” Tony calls out to Steve over the sound of the toilet flushing. “You can get back in the shower now.” No, wait, no. “Once I’m—you know, not right
“What sort of power source do you mean? What kind of power would overcome the spell’s failure?” Natasha asked, staring intently at Thor.
Tony looked hurt for a moment, devastated, and Steve only had enough time to feel confused at the raw pain showing on his face before it disappeared in the next heartbeat, and Tony gave him a winning smile. It did not brighten his eyes, though, and Steve hated that smile more than he hated Tony’s aloof stares.
Steve and Sam took off running after Clint, and Steve managed to overtake them both on the way down. He burst into the enormous chamber and immediately ran over to Natasha, who was standing over a man Steve did not recognize. Both of them were in the middle of a buzzing crowd of servants and the odd courtier. The man was seated on a low stool, dressed warmly and covered with a blanket, but clearly soaked through from the storm outside. Lord Fury and several others stood close-by, watching the man with wary concern.
Steve gathered Tony’s hands up in his and pressed them tightly to his mouth. “I’m here. We’ve been searching for you for months, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry it took so long – I’m so sorry I said—”
"Good, good," he said. "Pulse is a little lower than I'd like, but that's to be expected. Doctor Yinsen, if you would be so kind as to assist?"
The tears erupted, spilling down her cheeks, and she wiped her eyes on her bare arm, the sticky tracks of saltwater glistening on her skin.
were making out on the beach. All you needed to do was say ‘I want to suck your face off in the woods, wanna come?’ and I would have been like, sure, let me hydrate so I have some spit first.”
Sam made a noise of dismay but did not comment. Instead, he helped Steve tie the horses' reins securely to a protruding tree root at the safe side of the road, then watched determinedly from a perch at the edge of the cliff face as Steve began to eek down the stone and mud. Sam had an excellent eye, better than Steve’s in this bad light, and he called out directions for footholds and smooth, slippery-looking patches of rock to avoid as Steve made a slow descent in the hammering rain.
One evening, they were all lounging in the drawing room together: Bucky curled up on Natasha’s lap and Clint curled up on Bucky’s, while Sam attempted bravely to teach Steve how to dance yet again. Tony accompanied their efforts on the harpsichord, but not long into the endeavor he was laughing so hard there were tears on his cheeks and he certainly could not play any longer. Sam threw his hands up in despair and went to go sit on the couch opposite the one containing the Natasha-Bucky-Clint knot.
“What the hell?” Clint barked, looking between Steve and the two women frantically. “What is his problem?”
They were almost to the door that lead into the hall when the hollering over the winners of the group costume started to wane, and Jan’s voice could be heard calling out: “And finally, the prize for best couple’s costume goes to… Tony and Steve as Ghost Beauty and the Beast!”
“What are you doing here, then?” Tony asked as they watched his various possessions being loaded into the carriage awaiting him.
Steve spent the entire time sulking, according to Natasha. And Bucky. And Sam. And Sharon. And Peggy, when she visited. And once, memorably, Lord Fury.
“Or lack thereof?” Nia asked. “Do you...I don’t understand,” she said. “I--”  her voice cracked, she winced as she realized she was about to start crying again. “I worked
“Rad. Okay. Coffee.” Tony whipped around and made his way over to the kitchen half of the room. A nice coffee for the toothy beast. Why not? “I swear by molten black coffee, as nature intended, but I recognize that some people aren’t so enlightened. So do you want milk in yours?”
They painstakingly avoided talking about it, and while Natasha and Bucky had realized the situation and respected the pair’s decision to remain silent (or at least had the decency to keep quiet about their opinions, for the moment), Sam made no secret to Steve what he thought of the silence and awkwardness.
Finally, her head feeling heavy and her eyes sore from lack of sleep, she climbed out of bed again. She tiptoed downstairs in her pajamas, pulling on a thick, fluffy pair of slippers, and crept back to the dining room bookshelf.
Jarvis appeared, having parked the car and removed his chauffeur's cap, the wing on his sleeve enough to mark him as support staff to a UNITY official. Then Miss Potts showed up, prim and lovely in her white hospital dress uniform, but Nia's parents were still nowhere to be seen. She saw Jim's parents and Carol's whole family, taking their seats in the section reserved for civvies, toward the back of the amphitheater benches. The crowd was filling in, a sea of blue school uniforms at the very front, just behind the UNITY officials in their darker blues.
She put her hair up in a twist, as best she could, the way Carol had showed her how, and found matching earrings in a drawer in the hotel room dresser. She was still hopeless with makeup, but she
“That also means he will not be able to break the spell before the wedding,” Natasha pointed out sternly, before turning to look a little apologetically at Tony. “We were hoping there would be a clue in his notes, but none of them whatsoever seem to be regarding this swan spell on you, nor the one on the impostor. Then there is the matter of the traitor in my household,” she added in a snarl.
And then they were off, out in the open, and—it being Halloween, and all—the streets were positively crawling with people. Tony’s apartment block was part of a larger complex not far from campus, but most of the area was residential housing. Meaning they were surrounded by a healthy mix of bouncing children, trudging adults, and over-eager college students zipping from house to house in search of treats.
There was a knock at her door, and she went to answer it-- seeing the tiny glass peephole, she got up on her tiptoes to peek through it, although of course it was her father.
; he wasn’t stupid. She gritted her teeth, wondering if she should tell him, after all-- she was enough used to her parents underestimating her, she supposed they must do it to everyone else.
Eventually, Tony turned back around – and now he looked angry. Even knowing that this was Tony’s way of defending himself, Steve finally shifted into a sitting position and waited for whatever Tony would throw at him.
, feeling weak and heavy. He eventually managed to flip his body around so that he floated on his stomach, then went through the needlessly difficult task of dragging his head out of the water – which felt like it took ten times longer than it should have.
They sat in the first class cabin on the plane, and the flight attendant offered her a drink. She watched her father to take her cue-- of course Howard ordered a whiskey, so Nia took a glass of red wine, drank it much too quickly, and settled down beneath the not-quite-sufficient airplane blanket and fell immediately to sleep, finding the lull of the engines strangely comforting.
"Whatever that cable is running the the window," Nia answered. "There's a break in the seal; I was able to disarm the house alarm without tripping anything."
“I just want something to remember you by,” he whispered softly, and she recoiled at his words, without quite understanding why.
Tony made an inarticulate noise of protest while Pepper giggled and leaned out of the carriage window, and Natasha perked up like a fox catching the scent of a helpless little bunny. She turned slowly to look at Tony, and he was very much aware of who was the bunny in this scenario.
Steve heard Natasha and Pepper shouting at him, but his eyes were fixed on the way Thor kept his large hand pressed over the amulet, pushing it against Tony’s flesh as he started to murmur something in a language Steve did not understand. But it was magic, he realized, when the amulet began to glow. The others fell silent, gathering close around, until the glow sunk away into Tony’s skin and Thor moved the amulet to the side – revealing a nasty-looking scar where the open wound had just been.
He was glad that Natasha had friends, but he didn’t like at all that they were supposed to replace him. What if she didn’t need him anymore?
Natasha knew Steve had not been happy with this assignment. Not least because it was her and Clint who were to track down information on the first name on the list: Loki, the disgraced prince of Asgard.
Tony had a moment to think, “Oh shit,” and Steve a moment to tense up as if to flee, before the child’s mother turned and saw them—and smiled blandly.
“Isn’t this nice?” Tony said when they entered the room, spinning around and looking at everything like he’d never seen it before. He collapsed on Clint’s couch and closed his eyes with a sigh, while Steve frowned and walked over to the low chaise Tony normally used and ran a hand along the deep blue fabric of the backrest.
Tony interrupted him right back. “It’s Halloween, Steven!” He made a woo-woo-wiggly-fingers motion with the hand that wasn’t wrapped around Steve’s wrist. “Their first thought isn’t gonna be, ‘oh shit, look at that scary monster!’ It’s gonna be, ‘oh shit, look at that badass monster!’ They’re going to think you have the best damn costume they’ve ever seen!”
Very dashing, if Tony did say so himself. The cape was navy, made of some sort of cheap, scratchy fabric that Steve promised he couldn’t feel through his fur. It swept from his shoulders to his knees, ending at about the level of the khaki pants Tony had stolen from Rhodey after Steve kicked up a fuss about
Thor’s eyebrows jumped up, and he flashed another assessing look over at Clint. “To what does this information pertain?”
He pressed her farther up against the tree, catching at one of her hands as he separated her lips and slid his tongue over her teeth, and she dropped back, feeling the tree bark scratch her back through her shirt, but not caring, because for the first time all day, she didn’t have to
excused himself to his chambers to change clothes and retire for the night, and everyone else was left in an odd, floating moment of shock.
The spider puts up a worthy fight, which Tony decides to immediately forget as soon as the deed is done. He twitches once, violently, from his head to his toes, trying to remove the sensation of the monstrous creature making a break for freedom up his arm.
Nia looked up at her father, saw the rage in his eyes, the way his forehead creased, the ways his lips curled down, and she bit her lip.
The scraping sound was the blacksmith, who was seated at a bench and shaving at a piece of metal with what Steve could only assume to be a razor-sharp piece of another metal. The fire gurgled mightily from its pedestal in the center of the room, casting out sparks and dancing orange light in the otherwise dim chamber.
Nia hesitated. “Uh. Okay,” she replied, and she stood in front of him, shifting from foot to foot. “This,” he said, holding out a tiny metal capsule.
He wondered for a moment if he should not try to get Pepper and even the others to safety – but Tony did not seem to present an immediate danger to anyone. In fact, he seemed far more harmless now than his usual self. Than he should be. Than he was. Steve had wondered before how much a person had to change before they became in effect someone else, but now he was beginning to wonder if that had not been thinking far enough. Tony appeared to know who each of them were, knew their names, knew plenty of information about them – but did not know how to talk to them. And they all knew, in the form of a well-worn joke, that Pepper and Tony’s farewell exchange had been the same since they were very small children. There was no way Tony knew who Pepper was but did not know the correct response to that phrase.
Steve obeyed, if somewhat mulishly. He swept up the cape Tony had ordered him from where it lay on the kitchen counter, shook it out, and fastened the clasp around his neck.
There was a long silence, then Carol began to giggle. “Sorry!” she exclaimed, and she put an arm, gingerly, around Nia’s shoulders. “I’m so--”
“Yeah,” Steve nods, drumming his fingers in a line down the side of his cup. “Got a friend who works here and gives me probably-illicit discounts. Besides, I enjoy being a man of habit, sometimes.”
“Those burns?” Clint asked, directed at the princess. “You were right. A great many people remember seeing burns like them before, during the first insurgence. See, it turns out it takes quite a strong magic user to generate a heat blast such as the one at the accident, which already narrows our options down quite a bit. I have spoken to every notable chemist and weapons-maker on this and the other side of the Sea, and they are all insistent that nothing but magic could have done so much harm without blowing a hole in the side of the mountain. Which means the marks in the burns we thought could be runes probably were just that.
Steve was seated in the front row with Bucky and Sam, with Thor on the opposite side of the aisle nearer to Tony. Because the wedding was so private and so (relatively) small, they had decided to forego the traditions of bridesmaids and groomsmen, which Steve, at least, appreciated because it meant he would have a far better view of the ceremony than if he were forced to stand at the fringes, on guard.
to know, what her father had been working on, what was so dangerous, that he didn’t want her to be part of it.
“Hullo Nat! Hullo Tony!” Bucky called from the water, flinging his sodden hair out of his eyes. Steve gave him a dirty look, but Bucky ignored it.
He stroked a hand along Tony’s splayed wing. “You could have had a lovely life together as disgusting perversions of nature, if only you had been something other than a prince…” Obadiah paused for a moment, then pinched one of Tony’s secondary feathers between his fingers and yanked it sharply out of the flesh. The pain scarcely registered through the rest of the agony and horror overshadowing Tony’s mind, but he flinched nonetheless. Obadiah twirled the feather between his fingers, then stroked it down Tony’s bill. “I’ll give him this, shall I? A token of your final failure. After Hammer’s unfortunate death, of course, when I can ascend unchallenged to the throne. I would love to see the look on your dear knight’s face when he realizes just how long you’ve been dead.”
“Well, let’s get you to a--”  Maria started, standing up and reaching for Nia’s arm, all efficiency.
There had been a softness in Maria's voice, something Nia had rarely heard, the tone she used with very young patients, and it had struck Nia unexpectedly, with a feeling of melancholy, to hear her mother talk so lovingly to her father. She had felt angry at her parents, inexplicable ire boiling up in her chest, and tears pricking her eyes, and then anger at herself for being angry with them, and she hadn't been able to understand why.
Howard's footsteps had padded over the carpet in the hall, and Nia had had no choice but to return to his office, lest she be spotted leaving, lest Howard discover that she'd been listening in.
When he pulled back from the kiss, he almost expected to see Tony’s honey brown eyes open and shining at him.
“Come on, Steve,” Bucky chimed in, though Steve had stopped struggling. “What were you going to do – swim out there and dive-tackle it?”
After a moment of silence, Thor banged his mug angrily on the table, making all their dishes jump. “My brother will pay for this, I assure you,” he snapped. “Magic should never be used for such ends. Your prince may very well be in disguise, or under another enchantment, but he might also be restrained by non-magical means. I cannot tell you, forgive me. Please, Princess,” He looked imploringly at Natasha, then turned to look at Steve. “Sir Steven, accept my sincerest apologies for the role I and my kingdom have played in this terrible event.”
Tony recognizes that his brain is malfunctioning even as he speaks. He can almost feel the wires being crossed somewhere between
“I’m sorry, I don’t understand,” Ty replied sweetly. “Perhaps if you spoke in a more reasonable tone of voice.”
Tony cracked the door back open with wide eyes, desperately curious about the clumsiest home invader he’d ever encountered—and froze when an enormous shape started to rise from where it had been laying on the floor.
As unhappy as Bucky looked about leaving Steve here alone, he nodded and shot back the way they had come, boots slapping urgently on the flagstones.
So Steve succumbed to the desire that had taken up a space in his chest so many years ago in this very room, and held out a hand to Tony. “Dance with me,” he challenged.
more often than not playing the responsible adult in their group, especially when Sam was not there to be level-headed and reasonable.
After a moment, Steve obligingly looked up and looked Tony in the eye. His face softened, and Tony’s nerves eased a little. Those blue eyes fell away though, as Steve laced his fingers together on his knees. “The way things were,” Steve said in a controlled voice. “They can no longer be that way.”
"Come here," said Maria. She handed Nia one of the coats, wrapping the other one around herself, and opened the door.
“With all due respect, General Ross,” Howard said, raising an eyebrow. “You of all people should have some idea what happens when technology is tested in the field before its time.”
?” Tony demanded, but there was hurt and confusion in that word along with the frustration. “Tell me the truth! I know you want this, I know you want me. I want you so badly, I don’t understand
Eventually, he returned his sketchbook to the satchel over his shoulder and made the short uphill trek back to the castle in Natasha’s footsteps. After depositing the satchel in his room, he traipsed reluctantly back through the halls until he was outside the door to Tony’s chambers again. He knocked morosely, hoping that Tony was somewhere else…
Tony kissed the pad of his thumb without a moment’s hesitation, before reaching up to grab Steve’s wrist and pull his hand forward to press another warm, firm kiss to the center of his palm.
“It’s the only sample,” he said. “It’s the element that Hydra was using in their weapons. We never-- it took me this long to recreate it. And that little tube-- contains enough to power an entire city for a decade.”
But at the front of the room, there were half a dozen people on their feet, and Obie and Howard were talking heatedly between each other, and now Ross was shouting at them both, and Howard threw up his hands and walked out of the room.
Still, when the prince had to leave at the end of the summer the whole castle slipped into a period of melancholy, feeling the silence and emptiness in his wake and missing the vibrancy that the other child’s presence brought out in their young princess.
“Stop here,” Nia directed, and Jim let the car roll to a halt in the driveway up to her house. “I have to sneak back in; if my parents hear the monster--”
in his life, the idea of a marriage keeping them separated seemed… sickly. Wan, and weak, and hardly even a contender.
“Oh, and get yourself thrown in jail,” Jim piped in as he finally ambled his way over. “Real smart, Captain.”
It was uncomfortable at best and downright tortuous at worst for Steve to stand at attention behind Natasha as she spoke with Tony and, later, his parents: listening to Tony’s deep, smooth voice and wondering what his beard would feel like against Steve’s lips, or his chest, or… elsewhere.
“Bet you they kiss before the summer is out,” Bucky whispered obtrusively to Sam (who was several feet away from him), over the easy but rather loud tones of the music.
This was one of the most intimate touches they had ever shared, since usually they were both extremely careful to avoid this sort of thing. Steve got the sense that this was a bad idea even as he dragged Tony in close to his chest, but there was no chance of him abandoning it now. Tony made abrupt motions at Natasha, the only other member of the group with the capacity to produce music from the harpsichord.
The transformation had been obscured by water and the strange glow of the curse the first time they had seen it. They had been spared the sight of Tony’s bones cracking and splintering, rearranging themselves by dislocating and shifting beneath skin that took on a gruesome texture, as the feathers were slowly subsumed back into it. The change was mercifully quick, and soon Tony lay before them in his real body, breathing shallowly and not opening his eyes. His beard was as messy and unkempt as Steve remembered from the lake, and he took an odd sort of comfort in it. His hair was as long and ratty as it had been when they found him, and Steve began to run his fingers through it, trying to tease out the tangles for want of anything else to do as the transformation seemed to wind down.
And so the mighty kingdom was put under the rule of a mighty queen and her foreign king. Between them the land prospered, and if the king and queen ever seemed to be overly solicitous of two of their knights, well, nobody had any real complaints. The traitorous Stane and Hammer were never seen again in the light of day, and even Asgard was finally at peace. Even more startlingly, her king agreed to reopen trade with its neighboring realms for the first time in centuries.
Tony finished saying goodbye to Sam and came to stand in front of Steve. He was standing very close, and Steve only just came up to his shoulder, so he had to crane his head back to look up at the older boy.
Nancy, groaning, pushed herself up from the patio just as one of the assailants knocked the gun from Yinsen’s hands and shoved him down to the ground.
They even danced a few times, fast and happy and spinning. Natasha was a lovely dancer and Bucky… was very exuberant.
And inside was a man-- a naked, sleeping man. Her heartbeat sped up, her jaw dropped, and she screamed in spite of herself.
She was alone, bobbing on the surface of an enormous sea that stretched to the horizon in all directions, the sky pink and burning overhead. She kept herself afloat by treading water, staring up at the hot sun.
She wanted to cry. She knew every word of what she said was true, and it ached. Whatever Howard might want, ransom was off the table. UNITY had let hostages die before, and they couldn't make an exception for anyone.
Bucky was convinced this was somehow Steve’s fault, but refused to explain himself, and Natasha refused to hear a single bad word about Tony at all.
He knew they were watching, the nosy lot of them, but he did not much care at that moment. “Tony,” he breathed, then grinned.
She was sinking, in a viscous fluid, but it was transparent, and when she opened her eyes, she could see...though the fluid was filling her nose and ears and throat, surrounding her with intense pressure, somehow she didn’t drown, wasn’t suffocated by it. She saw a light above her, and tried to move her arms, tried to swim toward it, but when she did, a dark silhouette blocked her view-- she reached up, grabbing hold of whatever it was that was blocking her way to the surface.
She brushed tears from her eyes, hiccoughed loudly, and hid her face in her hands; too many people were taking pictures.
“… Free?” his neighbor says in a tone of mild concern, fingers tightening in the fluff of his towel.
“Wake up,” said another voice, one she couldn’t quite place, and now, she slowly returned to consciousness, her eyes still shuttered.
Bucky. His parents. They were not in here with him, he could tell – were they elsewhere in this place? Were they still at the crash site? How bad had the crash been, really? How long had he been unconscious? Where
you say this?” Sam barked, alarmed. Thor spared a moment to look up at him with a crooked grin, while Loki rolled his eyes (pretty haughtily, for someone who was beginning to turn pink from the forearm pressed against his throat).
An involuntary noise escaped Steve’s throat when he realized what Tony was trying to say. “It’s painful. The change is painful unless you’re in the water.” That was why Tony had stayed on the lake long after he'd seen them approach, waiting for the sun to set before he stepped foot on land.
“Okay,” Tony agrees, because why the hell not? But also, “Why?” because he just can’t leave well enough alone.
“This was the first building in the area commissioned by the UNITY government after the accords,” the young woman said. “The government claimed all lands previously owned by war criminals to be used for UNITY service.”
“Hey,” Clint said suddenly, in an inappropriately energetic voice. Everyone’s attention zeroed in on him. “You said that… if Tony’s enchanted, it would wear off at night, right? So, if we were there during the day, the spell would be working, right? So if Tony was
"Miss Stark!" He exclaimed, loudly, loudly enough that it turned the heads of the crowd milling nearby. "Are you excited for your assignment? What do you think it'll be?"
The three of them drew to a halt next to an over-sized suit of armor they had already passed, and Prince Thor looked incongruously quite pleased with the entire affair. “Forgive me, Princess,” he said, hardly sounding contrite. “But I’m sure you understand – sometimes time is the far more effective betrayer of deception than any other means.”
“I can't marry James,” Natasha said finally, looking over at the boy in question. She had always insisted on using Bucky’s proper name, claiming that his nickname was ridiculous – of course, in doing so she had made ‘James’ her own personal endearment, but nobody ever dared to point this out.  “I am a princess. He is a…”
Soon enough, though, Tony returned his gaze to Steve, who was still feverishly clutching his hands. “Steve,” he said roughly. “Please take me home.”
“I have a solution for that, though it is only temporary,” Thor said with a grin. He reached up and into his thick leather coat, pulling open the burgundy collar and fishing out the gold chain hidden beneath his shirts. “This was given to me by my mother,” he explained as he lifted the chain over his neck. “It guards the wearer against enchantments. Loki has one like it, though,” he grimaced. “I suspect he has re-enchanted it and altered its purpose somewhat.”
“I missed you,” he said again, his hand darting out and grabbing at the fabric of Tony’s buttoned jacket. “And I promised myself that if I got you back, if the stars looked so kindly upon us, I would not let it go any longer. I… you deserve more than that.”
“Steve died trying to protect the world from the same weapons I used against it,” Howard said, wistfully. “You would think the least I could do is save him.”
He held back as long as he could, but the horses were slowed practically to a crawl as they made up the final distance to the gatehouse, and Tony could stand it no more. He flung open the carriage door and ran past both the carriage and the horses, a smile wide on his face.
Tony wasn’t particularly thrilled over having his date co-opted either, and told them so as he tugged on Steve’s cape to make him follow.
The man’s eyes flared with rage, and he darted out with his free hand to snare Tony’s throat in an iron grip. “Have care when you speak thus to a prince of Asgard,” he snapped viciously, and—
The room erupted once again in cheers, and everyone followed Jan’s pointing finger to look at where Steve and Tony were frozen in the midst of their escape.
“I am afraid not, King Anthony,” he smirked. “It was not my intention to kill them, I assure you, but I must admit it's not an entirely unpleasant outcome. Perhaps they don't yet believe you are dead, Stark, but soon even the most hopeful of your vassals will begin to believe.”
Distantly, Steve was aware that he must look equally as debauched, if not more so, with his pale skin and the way Tony had seemed determined to ravage him with his mouth.
Tony shrieked, dignity be damned, scrambled up to his feet, and sprinted out of the bedroom, slamming the door behind him for good measure.
Steve rolled his eyes a little, and gave Tony a bit of a shake with the huge hands still gripping his shoulders. “Yes, you idiot genius.”
There was a beat of silence, of almost frantic anticipation, before Natasha dropped down beside Steve and kissed Tony’s forehead. She drew back only far enough to whisper a simple, “I love you.”
She opened the door and nearly smacked directly into Obie, who was standing with a hand raised, about to knock.
“It’s not ready,” Howard said, his tone short, and Nia got the sense that he was cutting Obie off deliberately.
“It is possible,” Thor nodded, then swallowed. “There are many ways to create the false appearance of another person. The easiest would be a simple magical disguise, a veneer of some sort.”
“They shot her,” Nia said. “They...they killed her.”  Her throat was hoarse, and every word was effort. “Water?” she asked.
Howard took advantage of his newfound status to return to his notorious reputation as a womanizer, though Nia had never seen him bring another woman home, had never met a girlfriend, was fairly certain that it was all for show, because her father seemed to spend more and more time in the lab, working on his designs, presenting new weapons to the UNITY Council, making political speeches, and building new inventions. Nia barely saw her father, and when she did, it was either in the middle of a press conference, with strangers holding a microphone up to his mouth and calling him “Mr. Secretary,” or he was staggering drunk into her room and watching her, while he thought she was asleep, ambling over to her bed and whispering goodnight, pulling the covers up a little higher around her neck.
“He’s just inside, with Sam,” she said reasonably. Then she added, less reasonably: “Clint is watching.”
Bucky and Tony were an excellent riding match, since they both enjoyed the thrill of speed and competition – but Bucky was more cautious and careful than Tony, which ensured that their rides never fell too far out of hand. Steve always went with Bucky and Tony, practically giddy to have both of them all to himself for however many hours they were out riding.
Every hope that had been fluttering in Steve’s chest, insisting that it was perhaps not that long of a drop at this point in the mountains, that perhaps it was reasonable that most if not all of the caravan had survived the fall – every little flame of optimism guttered at once as Steve looked into the yawning, black chasm below. The cliff was practically sheer for the height of at least three men before ever so slowly beginning to level out. At that point, the trees could begin to grow, which meant that both Steve and Sam could clearly see a path slicing through the copse of broken trunks and splintered branches, where the carriage must have tumbled down.
This was a mighty realm with powerful warriors, and for hundreds of years it had never been invaded by a foe. Many had once sought its power and wealth for themselves; all had failed. Many more still had tried to trade with this prosperous land, but they were set in their ways, and did not care to build relations with the lands outside their borders.
After a reluctant pause, Tony shifted his weight back onto his knee—which made Steve’s body jolt with a shock of pleasure—then he fell back to sit on his heel, his other foot still firmly on the floor. They stared at each other. Steve’s breath was evening out, but his nerves still sung with excitement and eagerness. He lay where Tony had dropped him, feeling too weak to even sit up. Tony had managed to undo the ties at his throat at some point, so his shirt was falling open to almost half-way down his chest – Steve noticed this only because Tony’s eyes kept flashing to the exposed skin there, then darting away.
coffee joint just a few blocks down from their building, and they let the conversation lapse comfortably as they make their way over to it—Steve probably senses that Tony will be more coherent company once he’s been sufficiently caffeinated. There’s only a small line before the till at this heinous hour, nobody even gives Tony a second look while they wait, and soon they’re seated at a cozy two-person table in the corner of the room.
“If Loki enchanted someone else to look like Tony,” Sam conjectured, tapping his fingers on the tabletop. “Could he have also enchanted Tony to look like someone else?”
Because as those years went on, Steve became more and more certain that Tony shared this affliction with him – that perhaps he suffered from it even more than Steve, when Tony’s life was so closely scrutinized at every turn. Steve was a lowly squire, and Tony was a prince. His associations could only naturally be expected to be gossiped upon. Steve tried to remember this as Tony’s very personality seemed to jump in between moments: from staring at Steve’s lips as they said goodbye, and on into the beds of women dotted all around the castle and Kingstown.
Moments later, the footsteps resounding through the place and disguising their number resolved slowly into a single pair of boots, striding in the direction of Tony’s cell. Keys scraped in the lock on the door, and what remained of Tony’s optimism about his situation crashed to the ground. When the door swung open, the light from a single fiery torch danced abruptly into the room, burning Tony’s eyes despite how small the flame was. By the time he had adjusted to the light, the door was closed once more, and a tall man was standing before it, staring back at him.
“Hey,” Nia objected, but she knew it was true. She’d barely seen the inside of the kitchen at home; she knew how to work a toaster, and she had a vague idea of how to turn a can of tuna into tuna salad, but cooking was hardly her area of expertise. "They're not going to make me a cook."
Steve had claimed another armchair for his own about an hour earlier, and Tony was pretty sure he’d been napping in the damn thing, the party pooper. Tony, for his part, had been making the rounds with people he knew, people he knew of, and people he didn’t know at all—though he was always aware of where Steve was, and kind of wishing he was where Steve was.
Tony blinked as his brain raced in five directions at once. The easiest bit to process was that his own hands were still up as if he were ready to fight his way out of this, which would only end in tears. His tears. With a jolt he brought his arms in to fold them over his chest.
His eyes caught on the desk by the window, which was covered in the glass and metal things Tony had been setting up earlier. Steve slunk over to the desk, eyeing the… things on it. He recognized none of it, but he could tell it was all worth a small fortune. He briefly considered just stealing something – but he did not wish to get whipped for thievery if it was found, and he could just hear his ma scolding him for even
They had been gone for months and were due to return in another month’s time, and Tony felt very cheated. He and Steve had exchanged the occasional friendly letter over the past year apart, devoid of emotion except in the very deepest crevices of the words, since it was impossible to know who might get their hands on those missives. Steve had warned Tony of this long mission, excited about it in the letter but giving just enough indication to Tony that he too was frustrated by the poor timing.
words to be the last he ever gave to Tony. He would not have to live on with his last memory of Tony’s voice being one of anger and pain.
“No one but your mother,” Howard answered, and he gave her a stern look, the kind that said he meant it. “If you need to trust another person, tell Jarvis. No one else. Especially not your uncle.”
“He doesn’t have the amulet,” Bucky pointed out grimly. “Which means he’s transformed and probably in a lot of pain – didn’t he say the water was the only thing that helped with the pain?”
Tony was not there, but by the look of the large, fresh bloodstains on the flagstones and the outer door swinging wildly open in the wind, he had been recently. And he was badly injured.
Tony considered this, then reached out and took the amulet from Thor’s palm, inspecting the pendant hanging down from the robust chain as best he could in the low light, and with Steve refusing to release his other hand. “What’s the catch?”
She walked up to the Dean, just as she’d been instructed, getting ready to shake his hand and accept her envelope.
It was a woman’s voice, a voice she hadn’t expected to hear, but instantly recognized. She disentangled herself from Ty and went running.
But then the surgeon lifted his shirt-- displaying not a human torso, but a wide, blank screen, that blinked to life, first with static, then with an image, a blurry human face.
a stranger to Tony, produced much the same reaction as the others, and thus Thor had taken to keeping a secure distance out of deference to Tony’s unease. Eventually, Thor left their party entirely and pulled on ahead of them with Loki tethered to his saddle, whining heartily as they trekked back towards Kingstown at speed.
Tony grinned, burying his face in the long hair on the back of Steve’s head. “Don’t be like that, Beast Mode. You’ll always be my favorite monster.”
He came to a choked stop when he saw that Tony was frozen in the doorway opposite him, staring at him in surprise and what appeared to be dismay.
Shuri cheered for herself along with everyone else, and managed to catch her candy bar using a gripper-arm-thing that extended from the sleeve of her trench coat and scared the hell out of several people standing near her.
And so Steve was officially conferred the duties of a squire, and set about training with the others in earnest. Sir Alexander had three existing squires, including Bucky, all of whom had the significant advantage on Steve of having been raised all—or at least most—of their lives with the expectation that they would become squires one day. Still, Steve had been raised alongside Bucky for the most part, and Bucky was a bit of a determined follower of rules, so Steve had that advantage, at least. In addition, Steve had gained a great deal of height over the previous year, remaining comfortably even with Bucky though his friend was a year older. But he still lacked the muscle mass of the other squires, and
The same sort of encounter happened several times along their way. By the end of it, Steve had relaxed enough to show off his enormous fangs along with Tony’s rather more teeny-tiny ones, which made most of the kids either scream with pleasure or gasp in awe. The adults, amazingly, didn’t seem to entertain the idea that Steve was an actual monster for even a second. Steve even took a selfie with a group of freshman girls from the nearby college, although admittedly he didn’t look thrilled about it.
She chose warmth, snapping the door shut behind her, and felt her way blind along the walls of the hall. Her head and her heart were both pounding; she panted softly, and, for a moment, rested her cheek against the plaster wall.
There had been protesters outside the hospital, people with white picket signs, shouting. Jarvis explained that there were some people who felt that people from the Territories, the land outside UNITY Central, should be able to cross the border to receive medical care, and some people didn’t.
Yinsen had been one of Tony’s only comforts. First Bucky, and now this. Tony knew full well that he was not worth the pain of so many people, and it was sometimes only the thought that he would not let their pain—the haunting horror of whatever misery Bucky had been put through or was still living with—be for nothing. He would not bow to Loki.
Steve had been prepared for any manner of greeting by Tony after their disastrous farewell. He had anticipated anger, coldness, relief – and in his weaker, more hopeful, besotted moments, he thought that perhaps Tony would be overjoyed that Steve wished to move on from their longstanding past of denying their feelings for each other. He had often imagined greeting Tony with a kiss: a kiss like those they shared in front of the fireplace, kisses that escaped reason and robbed him of breath and thought. Even on the ride back home, he imagined sitting upon the bed with Tony as he convalesced, eating proper meals and resting and recovering his strength. He imagined curling over Tony’s thighs and just feeling his body present and warm beneath Steve’s, or holding him close with his hand over Tony’s heart, feeling it beating alive.
“Will you play for us?” Natasha asked Tony, herding him towards the harpsichord without awaiting a response. She shoved him down hard onto the seat. “We have missed your playing.”
Nia looked back and forth between her two honorary relatives-- neither of them family by blood, but both of them here, both of them interested in what she would become, both of them aware of how important this day was. At eighteen, she couldn’t blubber at them, couldn’t tell them she wished they were her parents.
“Not every plan need be brilliant, Tony,” Natasha scolded fondly. “I will arrange for someone to meet you at the storeroom entrance with appropriate clothing, say at eight hours past noon? That gives almost no time for anyone to notice anything amiss and interfere.”
She sighed, her shoulders slumping. “Right,” she said. “Okay. Well. Back up to bed, I guess. Maybe it’ll be better in the morning.”
“Well, you’ve got that the wrong way around, now,” Howard answered. “I named it after the rarest and most precious thing in the world.”
Clint’s admittedly tasteless jokes seemed to make Tony more uncomfortable than they ever had before, and the sharp wit they had grown to expect from the man seemed to have vanished beneath an odd stretch of uncertainty. Even Sam’s gentle solicitousness appeared to unnerve Tony to an extent, and his comfort and reassurance seemed to fall upon stone ears. The overwhelming presence of Thor, who really
The storm was a summer spell, and would not last much longer. After a brief moment of consideration, he leaned over the desk and grabbed the window latch, depressing it and letting the window swing outward. The sound of the rain flew in along with the fat raindrops, and Steve allowed himself a moment to ensure the droplets were hitting the open notebook before turning and scampering from the room like a rabbit from a foxhole.
He whispered Steve’s name and the man came striding over. He gathered Tony in an eclipsing hug and Tony just soaked it in for a moment.
Just before he fell asleep, Tony turned his head back over his shoulder and whispered to Steve that he loved him too, and he meant it about their wedding, and Steve fell asleep with Tony bundled in his arms and an irrepressible smile on his lips.
“Come on, after what happened to you today?” Carol asked. “He didn’t even ask how you were; he just launched into his own complaints.”
He left the room without looking at anyone, feeling like a coward, but knowing little more than the overwhelming need to get away from Steve before he did something truly pitiable, like beg him to just say what Tony had done wrong now.
“Do we want to take that with us?” Steve looked apprehensively at the scepter in Sam’s outstretched hand.
Nia screamed. Something smacked her upside the head, and she wondered if she’d been shot. She could hear the commotion behind her-- surely the other hotel guests, Obie, her father, even Ty, must be coming for her. The man who held her started dragging her away, toward the expansive lawn behind the hotel.
She tried to dig her elbow into his side surreptitiously, suddenly regretting the blue dress. “What are you doing here?” she asked, trying to sound casual, not as if she were interrogating him.
He must have made a noise (hopefully a manly gasp, but more likely a childish squeak), because the figure cringed and paused half-way up onto its feet, putting its hands in the air as if in surrender.
Ty’s expression went cold, stony, and he looked back and forth from the envelope to the Dean once more before he waved away the woman with the stars and
“I love you,” Tony whispered, pretty confident that Steve wouldn’t hear him even with his super-beast hearing, what with Tony’s face being crushed against his chest and all.
She supposed it was the journalist in him: he was born to it, the only child of the great defenders of the Fourth Estate, Ty had been raised by the people who had done the most to keep the press from being dismantled when UNITY came to power. There had been arguments that negative press could hurt the fledgling government, but it had been the Stones who championed the free press, even at great risk to themselves, and Ty had grown up with journalism in his blood. He knew a story when he saw one, she intrigued him, and at some point he’d confused that fascination for attraction. It was the only explanation for someone like
"Hello, my dear," he said, and she felt the impulse, as the rage rose in her head, to tell him she wasn't his dear, but she managed to keep her mouth shut this time.
Steve reached up and touched her face, very close, and for a moment, she thought he was going to kiss her, but instead, he whispered to her.
Tony was not incapable of fighting by any means, but he clearly did not take quite the pleasure in it that the others did. He also had a natural heart condition that had persisted through the threshold of teasing and proved itself to be something of a threat to his consciousness if he overexerted himself. This was not something that had ever been a problem when he was a child but, when pressed, Tony said something about the Asgardian pirates who had taken him briefly captive a few years before, and then said no more.
all seemed wrong, he was probably no longer human. With a deep preparatory breath—and even that simple inhale felt viscerally wrong—Tony tipped his face down to look at his reflection in the lake.
“Your date?” Steve asked him, bemused, as the girls giggled behind them and continued to drag random passers-by into their selfie trap, like modern-day sirens.
But Steve watched all of this as though from a great distance. If Stane, the traitor, had the amulet, what had he done with Tony? Tony had clearly arrived at the castle, and instead of Clint going to meet him, well, then what had Stane done to Clint? And if Stane had the amulet and one of Tony’s feathers, then Tony would have had to have transformed, without the lake to ease the pain…
She trembled, knock-kneed in her too-high shoes, and Ty took a long look at her, his eyes focusing on the low neckline of her dress.
Nia winced, and she looked back at Howard, who was watching, shivering, in the doorway. “It’s his heart, isn’t it?” she asked Maria. “This is why-- your new prosthetic, the one you had me help you model, that’s for
Steve was well on his way to becoming an exemplary knight. He had been well-trained in chivalry and other such knightly trappings, and over the past few years Tony had been extremely gratified to find that he now had to work that little bit harder to draw out the snarky little terror he knew lay behind those polite blue eyes. Steve had grown far taller as well, outstripping even Bucky the last time Tony had seen him, and therefore Tony too by a rather disconcerting margin.
“That’s not tactics!” he points out, a ludicrous giggle lurking in his voice. “That was the least tactical move I’ve ever seen.”
Sir Alexander, however, was very understanding about Steve’s wish to remain with Bucky, and had assured Steve that he was readily excused until Bucky was as recovered as could be expected. He seemed almost as shaken and distressed at Bucky’s injury as Steve himself, which was a little surprising, given that he had not expressed anywhere near that much concern for Bucky’s welfare the entire time Steve had known him.
“I don’t go to cocktail parties,” Nia pointed out. “I have one party dress, and one, uh. One dress for funerals that I guess would be all right?”
“I suffer thy pain,” Thor said in the tone of a well-worn phrase, and extended his arm. Clint took his wrist in a tight grip and they nodded at each other once, with understanding, before dropping their hands. Then the prince turned to Natasha with a serious but open look upon his face. “What is it you believe my brother has done, Princess?”
Nevertheless, Tony, Natasha, Sam, and Clint managed to amuse themselves in the others’ absence. One memorable afternoon, Natasha demonstrated the trick riding Clint had been teaching her – first on a horse, which was honestly impressive enough, and then on
against regulation, even for off-hours clothing, and white shorts that were just as likely to earn her a infraction if someone saw them.
Natasha leaned in until her nose was almost brushing their captive’s as he desperately leaned away, caught between her fierce grip and Thor’s enormous hands on his shoulders. “They might just kill you first,” she said sweetly, glancing at Steve and Bucky.
Or, at least, that was the official line she extended to reject the incoming offers, not to mention help fend off Lord Fury’s concerns.
So it was that wedding preparations commenced apace, just a few weeks in advance, though Lord Fury argued fiercely for more speed. Lord Stane would not hear of it, and insisted that Tony be permitted to enter his care and recover in his own home. Natasha put her foot down at that – arguing that Tony had always been comfortable in her castle and that there was no reason to add the strain of the trip by sea to his harrowing experience, especially when he would only have to turn around and return for the wedding. Tony seemed not to have much of an opinion either way.
“Fuck you, Steve,” she murmured at the paper, and started filling in a star shape around the prosthesis.
Howard rubbed at his chin. “I’m right next door,” he said. “To your left. Put something on that’s suitable for lunch, and for meetings; you’ll be accompanying me today.”
But there at the side of the desk was a notebook. Steve flicked it open and recognized haphazard columns of numbers, though they did not look like records or an invoice or anything numbers were actually useful for. He looked a little more closely and noted that it was written in ink. Directly over the notebook was a window pane, through which he could see the rain sheeting against the glass.
over your assignment; it’s only natural to take out your grief on other people.”  His voice went low; he practically purred into the phone. “You want to make it up to me? Come over here right now, let me bend you over the kitchen table and fuck you till you’re writhing and helpless and screaming my--”
Of course, Bucky instantly disobeyed and shifted his weight as though he were going to try to get his arms underneath himself and sit up – Natasha pushed him firmly back down and Steve refused to let go of his hand. They managed to keep him calm until Bruce finally staggered in, panting deeply, and administered a sleeping draught.
Their days passed in smaller groups than they had last year, with Tony spending more one-on-one time with Natasha than he had since they were small children. That was admittedly pleasing, but also a reminder of how much things had changed since last summer, when the six of them could scarcely be separated for an hour at a time.
Even so, when Tony crawled into bed that first night, well and truly exhausted from the all-night engineering binge and cross-country move, he had not expected the mattress to barely give at all under his weight. Or for it to make a sound weirdly like a startled exhale. Shouldn’t a place like this have the plushest furnishings money can buy?
The story changed. Sometimes Loki told him that Bucky had been killed in the attack. After those days, Tony could hardly sleep for the pain in his heart. Other times, Bucky had survived the initial attack, but had not yet woken up. Sometimes he had woken up but with no memory of who he was. Sometimes he had lost an arm, sometimes a leg, sometimes two. Even knowing that Loki was playing obvious, vindictive games with him did not make it easier to bear. Tony dreamed of Bucky, his dear friend of so many years: mutilated somehow, blaming Tony for being weak and needing his protection in the first place.
He called up for Sam to remain in place for the moment, and continued on through the trees at a steep decline. The path of the carriage was not hard to follow, considering the amount of destruction it had caused, not to mention the fragments of what had once been its expensive adornments which now lay scattered all over the ground.  The rain continued to sheet down against Steve’s face, even as he had to brace his shoulder against a nearby tree to take a deep breath, trying to still the quivering in his hands by clenching them into painful fists.
But the other boy was even tinier. He was scrawny and pale-skinned, pink-cheeked and tow-headed, and scowling.
She clutched at her little purse that had her hotel room key and her lipgloss in it, and wished Jim were there.
A small, wicked smile began to wind its way onto Natasha’s face, and Steve suspected it had nothing to do with the fact that he had wound his fingers in with Tony’s at their sides, which made Tony dart him a pleased, knowing look.
As much as he wanted this very masculine development to help reduce the inappropriate affection Steve had for the other man, it seemed—to his despair—to have quite the opposite effect.
. But then he would remember that Loki could not be trusted – no, he was almost laughably untrustworthy, and Tony could not give in for fear of what would happen to those he loved if he did.
“Ty,” she murmured, weakly, into his mouth, her cheeks warm and her head fuzzy, even as she slid her own hand over the bulge in his pants, teasing at it with her fingers through the fabric. “Today was kind of fucked up, I actually did want to talk--”
. The knowledge, something she had never been quite sure of, made her eyes well up with tears, and her throat tightened.
It was Thor who spotted him first. Once he’d seen their destination, his long strides had eaten up those of the others. By the time the rest of them arrived seconds later in the clearing by the water, he was on his knees in the shallows of the creek, running his hands over the large bird lying still before him.
“Response?” Ty asked. “Do you think I’m trying to get retribution?” He laughed. “I’m not mad at you, Nia. I know you were in a…
Until the princess was old enough to take her rightful place, the throne would remain empty upon its dais. So when the foreign royals entered the great hall of the castle, Lord Fury stood on the middle step of the dais, with the little princess standing at attention on the level above him. The adults made a production of the entire event, through the introductions and the speeches and all the political fanfare. Throughout it all, the young prince and princess examined each other in curious silence. And though Prince Anthony could not resist looking about him at this new place from time to time, Princess Natasha did not take her eyes off the older boy.
Steve had to remind himself almost daily that this was still the man he loved, and that his resolutions upon Tony’s loss were not to be negated by the trauma he had suffered while in captivity. Even in the face of Tony’s new, pervasive indifference to all of them—even Steve, even
Sam gently urged her aside, while Steve was beginning to breathe for what felt like the first time since he had seen the carriage.
she was going to do something terribly embarrassing, and it would be too late, she wouldn’t be protected from the press anymore, it would be in every single newspaper come morning.
"I'm meant to find out which of the officials here are in support of waging war against the insurgents, and which would prefer a peaceful solution. It’s pretty obvious which side your--"
He did know that he was vibrating like a plucked string as Tony’s carriage approached for the first time in years. He had to remind himself that Tony had a chaperon this time, and that they would have to behave themselves in front of this very important member of King Howard’s court. (At least initially. Stane was not, after all, planning to stay for the entire summer.)
Maria sat down next to her on the sofa, put her hand tentatively on Nia’s shoulder, and gave it a pat. It was a little mechanical, a little uncertain, but in that moment, Nia was incredibly grateful.
For his part, Tony was looking up at Steve in almost equal disbelief, as though Steve could not possibly be real. The chain rattled as Tony brought his hands up to Steve’s chest, pressing against the muscle as if to rest before continuing up to his face. He had one hand on each of Steve’s cheeks, and his brown eyes were dull, as if he hardly even recognized the man before him.
As Tony’s thumb moved down Steve’s jaw and on to the cords of his neck, the hot, beating desire that had been overtaking Steve’s mind started to recede.
Maria got up from the table, leaned over, and kissed Nia on the cheek. “No,” she said. “But I love you.”
And through all of this, Steve… Steve had very carefully and with extreme bias avoided thinking about what had truly happened to Tony. Each time his mind tried to approach the topic he jerked it forcefully away. He focused on Bucky. He focused on the uproar surrounding the loss of the king and queen of the neighboring kingdom. The frantic search for an appropriate successor, at least until the prince could be found.
The assignments took on a rhythmic quality, the way they had in years before: name, assignment, polite applause. Name, assignment, polite applause. The Dean’s assistant would pin a silver star over each graduate’s heart, and the graduates received their envelopes with the full details on their assignments, clutching them carefully with both hands so they wouldn’t drop them-- even as UNITY tried to discourage superstition, it was considered terribly bad luck to drop your envelope, a suggestion that you weren't a match for the assignment.
For a moment, Nia imagined that maybe he had already decided not to come. She sank a little lower in her chair. Ty, glancing at her, as if he could sense her unease, squeezed her hand lightly.
Nia found a small button, and pressed it, and the seal released itself with a hydraulic hissing sound. She felt a tingle rise up from her fingertip through her arm, like a little electric current, as she pulled the casing back, turning to watch the dials and sensors behind her, to make sure his vitals remained steady.
But then a new invasion came from the west – a plague that swept through the kingdom, killing without a care from the lowliest serf to the highest nobleman. By the time the plague had run its course, the population had been dealt devastating losses. The king and queen themselves were dead, along with five of their small children.
“Well, you look very grown-up.”  Obie gave her a pat on the shoulder. “We’ll have to have lunch later; you can tell me what you’re planning to do with yourself. Howard, are you going to try to recruit her?”
“Show who what?” Nia asked, looking around for another person, someone apart from the surgeon and Dr. Yinsen.
“I really don’t think anyone’s paying us any attention. And yes, I’m going to prove it. Look: give me your hand.”
He let go of Tony’s neck abruptly. Tony coughed in a breath and glared up at the ruined prince with watering eyes. “
Pepper, as the champion of the theory that Loki had somehow altered or damaged Tony’s mind, was one of their most dedicated code-breakers. She was also in constant communication with Tony’s friend Rhodes, who was far afield defending Menahahte from the increasing attacks from their neighbors. Stane’s leadership, it seemed, left much to be desired, and it had been the rare month recently that some foreign land was not snapping at the kingdom’s gates, testing its new regent or simply bolstered by the death of its brilliant king.
“My Lord,” he said smoothly. “I have never met that madman before, and I certainly know nothing about magic. I assure you—”
The guests had all gathered in the great hall – not as many as one would normally see at a royal wedding such as this, but as many as could be received on the short notice Lord Fury was given. The man himself was at the side door with Natasha, ready to escort her to the awaiting priest. Tony was to be escorted by Lord Stane, as the closest thing to a father he had remaining. Pepper had assured them that Lord Stane would be keeping the impostor detained before Clint could make it up there to keep him trapped in Tony’s rooms. Clint had disappeared for that purpose about twenty minutes ago, which meant that—
There was a disbelieving noise from Clint’s direction, followed by a low thump and a grunt of pain – but Steve paid it no mind. He gripped Tony’s slack face between his hands, running his fingers over the man’s soft cheekbones.
Justin went white. “That magical guy, you know the one – I’m sure. Long hair, never seen the sun? Total lunatic, right, but he told me I could be king and all I had to do was—”
“He—” Steve was unsure how much he could tell her. It was possible Pepper knew that Tony shared his inclinations towards either sex, but that was not an assumption he was at all willing to make blindly, not even to Pepper. “He doesn’t remember things, events that he should. He’s saying things… he’s just…” He struggled for a moment for the right word.
“I love you too, Tony,” Pepper said quietly, firmly. Bucky echoed her, and even Clint and Sam said something Steve could not hear over the sound of the wind.
“Did I forget something?” Tony asks. It’s the only plausible explanation he can come up with for Steve’s return to his doorstep. He doesn’t think he’d brought anything but his tired self down the hall, but then again,
The Peace Officer looked thoughtfully at her. “Look,” she said. “I probably would have done the same thing in your shoes. They’re assholes, all of them, and you don’t seem like the spoiled brat they make you out to be.”
She snuck her own hands up beneath his shirt, sliding her fingers over his smooth chest, his well-defined muscles, and laughed as he caught his fingers on the back of her bra, unfastening it and tugging it forward, away from her breasts.
