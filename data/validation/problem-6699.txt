“Brave soul, this one. I don’t feel any breaks or sprains, besides this back leg. It’s already wrapped, though, so I assume it wasn’t new?” She asked, and Bruce nodded.
“That’s a good one. He’s a dog, he’s wily and smart, and he’s not afraid to bite. Fits well enough.” Clint held up his hand for a high-five, and Natasha bumped it with her fist. Fury wrote something down on his folder and cracked his knuckles.
“I’m starting to panic, right now. I’m panicking.” Tony said this to Steve, whispering in his ear and turning his back to the others.
The first thing Tony did was go back to the kitchen. It was empty, as was the living room. He had no idea where everyone was at, but at least he could choke on the dog food in peace. Tony was so hungry that it went down easier than he thought it would. He only gagged once or twice, but he didn’t throw it back up, so he counted it as a win.
Tony sagged in defeat, letting Steve huff and puff and carry him all the way back to the foyer, where he unclipped the leash and put away his shoes with a single hand, Tony tucked under his other arm.
“Welcome back, Steve. So Peter, the basics, are this; these are the Avengers. They were... transformed into cats. As you can see. You also found Tony and indirectly returned him, for which we’re all grateful for.”
Tony came up to a door that had a charred support beam fallen across the front of it, and someone was pounding on it from behind. The agent stopped beside him and looked around. Tony barked and the pounding stopped, voices murmuring excitedly.
Tony actually shouted in surprise as they dropped like stones and sunk much the same. The grasshopper thrashed and ripped off the boots, crawling across Tony and tearing at the armor, as if trying to get back to the surface as fast as it could. He threw up his hands as the grasshopper made to chomp down on the helmet and got his gauntlets torn off for his troubles. Water was steadily leaking into the suit and JARVIS was saying something, sounding urgent, but Tony was panicking and trying to push the bug off. The prongs on the grasshopper’s legs were caught in the armor and there was a soft
Tony was the Merchant of Death, and if he had to spend the rest of his life seeking retribution for that, he was more than ready to clean the blood off his hands. No matter the personal cost.
It may have been a few minutes or a few hours, but Tony eventually got unsteadily to his feet. He had no idea what to do.
“No, I have a lot of work to get done. Tony won’t be able to go to any meetings like this. He can’t even do phone conferences, I’ll have to make up a cover story and reschedule everything- dammit, Tony, the Board of Investors are going to get suspicious if I keep delaying. Please sort this out as soon as you can, Phil?” She asked, giving Tony a quick kiss on the top of his fuzzy head before she handed him to Peter, whose only available arm space was on top of Natasha. She didn’t seem to care, so Tony lounged across her back, and started to groom the fur behind her ears, where there was dirt matted in little streaked clumps. A purr started up in her chest and Tony was internally crowing over his victory.
“Wait to push up until everyone is in position- if we shift this the wrong way, we’ll hurt her.” Tony shouted, waiting for the debris to stop settling before he shouted, “Go!”
The other voice on the line was tinny and quiet to Tony’s ears, but he could still make out what Steve was saying.
Next thing they knew, they were waking up on top of each other after a three hour nap, and Tony  didn’t really regret it; he was more fond than irritated
“Oof!” Peter had the breath knocked out of him and he stumbled back in surprise, hands automatically coming up to keep Tony from falling as the cat rubbed his face all over Peter’s chin.
“Paws, you mean.” Loki stood up and laughed, striding over a few feet and picking up Tony’s pile of discarded clothes. With a faint white glow and a matter of seconds he transformed himself to look like the spitting image of Anthony Stark. He gave Tony a smarmy grin before he changed into the jeans and shirt, and then nobody would have been able to tell them apart. Well, before the original Tony became a dog, that is.
century but disused in his childhood and eventually demolished in the early 30s. It was also, unfortunately, full of lawyers. Between the contemporary New Yorkers fleeing and the confused time travellers panicking, the place was in so much chaos they had called in the other Avengers to help try and keep things under control whilst they tried to work out what was going on.
instead of a pink one, and how it had taken hours for him to work out why no-one was responding to his charms. Good times.
Bucky's face softened slightly, even as he said, 'And you don't have any friends to help you? Like me? How come your pride can take becoming a dime bride but no, asking for help is too much?'
The grin returned to Steve's face, bursting out of him uncontrollably. 'Buck,' he said, 'You are not going to believe this.'
'It's S-' Steve cut himself off. If the Starks found out he'd been flirting at a bar after the third gift had already been sent, he could ruin the whole thing. 'It's James,' he finished, hoping Bucky wouldn't mind Steve borrowing his name. It wasn't like Bucky ever used it anyway.
, and he couldn't stop laughing, but when he looked at his dad to see if he was enjoying it too, he saw tears in his eyes, like he was about to cry. Peter stopped rolling immediately, the happy feeling pushed right out of his stomach by a much more familiar dread. He hated it when his dad was sad. But he wasn't dying any more, so his dad should be happy? Right?
'So retire,' Tony had said, completely unsympathetic when Steve had voiced the feeling to him one lunchtime. Tony came by most days now around one, to share in coffee and whatever vittals they had going. Seeing how much better he looked, how much more relaxed he was, made everything else worth it. Steve would have born anything to keep him this near to carefree, with the blue ribbon on his lapel now tattered and frayed, not changed once since Thor had arrived. 'Come on, Sheriff,' he said, wheedling. 'We'll get a couple of chickens to keep you busy, go grey together drinking coffee on the porch. Doesn't that sound better than staying here to be constantly upstaged by Deputy Handsome?'
flowers. My friend was not impressed that I got her lilies after “almost killing her”. Some people are so dramatic.’
With so much time to think, Tony was uncomfortably aware that while the Venom-inspired impulse to kill Steve had completely vanished, the rest of his feelings had not. If anything, they had grown. With Venom, he had just wanted to get Steve to bed. Now he pretty much just wanted to get into Steve's bed, stay there, wake up there every morning for the rest of his life. These were feelings that, given the circumstances, kind of sucked.
He wasn't in a jail cell or a lab or even tied up or anything. In fact, he was lying on a couch made out of some super fancy material that was thick like a really furry dog, and coloured a deep red. He'd rolled onto his side, and all he could see was the back of the couch. It was kind of a nice couch, way nicer than the one he and his dad had at home. Maybe Mr Halloween was rich. However nice it was, though, it didn't stop the scary, tingling feeling in his stomach that something bad was about to happen. Peter opened his eyes all the way, and moved his head as slowly as he could.
'It's only the three months where you were sick,' Natasha said. 'I bet the other months are still in there somewhere, it'll come back to you.'
Tony had learnt from it though, determined not to miss out on any more love in his life, and when Steve had shown up he'd fallen in love quickly and completely, taking things slowly only for Peter's sake. Eventually, though, he'd confessed how he felt, he and Steve began dating, fell more in love, and now they had been married two years. It felt like things had finally come together. Tony had never been happier. Except now something was wrong with Peter. Tony's chest was starting to grow tight.
(Then again, whenever Bucky teased him about this moment, Tony would tense up, and his smile wouldn’t meet his eyes.)
the tradition,' he clarified, quickly. 'I want to keep the tradition. I really, really want to. I've wanted to for months. Please. Thanks.'
'You're a good kid,' Tony said, ruffling his hair. For once, Peter didn't swat him away. 'Don't worry, okay? It'll be fine.'
now. Was that possible? Was it going to burst? She was not going to die because of her own urine soaking into her blood stream. She stood up, trying to ignore her stomach screwing up in pain as she did so. 'I have to pee,' she said, for no real reason, shoving past Cap's legs and making a beeline for the bathroom.
unless he wanted it to, and when he wanted it to, he made it happen himself. Everything in his life was how he wanted it.
'I know a place,' Barnaby said. 'It's like a, a sculpture garden? On the roof of the building where I work. I have my pass, we can get in, it's not far, and no-one will be there at this time of night, it's-'
'Electricity 11% functionality,' Jarvis told no-one in particular. Peter carried on climbing, hoping to get to the top before his luck ran out. He was nearly there.
It was too late anyway. Tony was already getting up, using Steve's knee for balance. Even through the linen of his trousers, Steve could feel the callouses on Tony's blacksmith hands, the hands that made such miraculous things. This time, however, he was more concerned with the stumble itself. It was an unfortunate fact that Tony was a drunk. He was at least trying to fight the demon now, had signed the temperance pledge and started wearing the ribbon months ago, but once something had claws in you that deep, it was a hard thing to shake free.
Steve gaped at him stupidly for a moment, then drew his jaw tightly closed, locking his knees so he wouldn't just get up and walk out of there. This man was intolerable. But he hadn't even asked his question yet, and Peter this so badly.
what I'm supposed to be,' Steve said, then sighed. 'Listen, Ms Potts. I don't... this isn't going to make any more difference to his life than he wants it to. If he wants me to sign the marriage certificate and then get out of his life, I will.'
'You did not say there would be dancing,' Angela said to Thor, scowling, but Thor simply laughed at her and ushered the two of them out onto the floor. Tony took Angela's hand and her waist and off they went.
The doorbell rang. Steve hauled himself off the couch and slowly dragged his disobedient body to answer the door.
Steve was in the forties, still tiny, his breath hitching asthmatically. He was in space, he was under the sea, he was tall, he was short, he was old, he was young, he worked in a coffee shop, he was a student, he was a rockstar, a spy, he was Iron Man, Spiderman, the Sorceror Supreme, Hydra Supreme -
'Oh, I wouldn't want to take up your precious time, Steve. I know you need to throw out the trash.' Stark gestured at the scrunched up garbage in Steve's fist, then blinked rapidly. His expression changed to something Steve couldn't read as he darted forward, plucking the bit of ribbon out of the mess. 'You kept this?' He demanded. 'Steve... you kept it.'
'Yes sir Dad, I'll put it down just in like one more block. Oh, sir?! Sir, Ma'am?! You can't go that way! Ma'am! Stop!'
The next day, Tony came back again, startling Steve. He’d been sitting at the counter, writing on the back of an old receipt all the lies he had told Tony
it might not be that simple; that Tony might change his mind or Howard might put a stop to the exchange, that even if Steve was free Barnaby still wouldn't be, that Barnaby might not forgive Steve lying about his name, that Barnaby might not feel the same connection Steve did, but the bond mark was a warm reassurance. He knew, somehow, on some level so deep inside that it had gone well beyond self delusion and into cosmic certainty, that out there somewhere Barnaby was trying to find his way back too.
'It wasn't difficult to work out. Not to anyone who actually knows you. Frankly I was fed up of waiting for you to tell me.'
'Peter,' Tony said, in the most authoritative tone he could. 'Gotta give me something to go on, here, kid.'
The door to the coffee shop chimed and Steve swivelled his neck to look at it, but it wasn't Tony Stark. Not that Steve really knew what he looked like in real life; his mom had tried to describe him but
‘This won’t take long.’ And just like that, she showed herself into the lounge. Peter looked at her in alarm. ‘Hi,’ Romanov said.
They were sprawled out over the bench, Steve's back pressed up against one end, with one of his arms securely wrapped around Tony's waist and the other stroking his face. Tony was propped up on Steve's shoulders, kissing him. He sighed into Steve's neck at the interruption. Steve reached into Tony's jacket pocket and fished the phone out.
'Steve,' Peggy said, trying not to sound as alarmed as she felt. 'Tell me, what is it? What's wrong?' On instinct, she went to him, wrapped her arms tight around him. At first he tensed, and she thought he was going to pull away, but then he started to shake again.
'I'm not,' Steve said, shortly. 'I'm just going to go in that convenience store there, get a few things. I'll be right back.'
The chorus finished and the pitch decreased slightly, and Venom, enraged, became aware of Peter, throwing him aside as if the boy wasn't even there. Peter hit the bar, moaned, and lay still.
'Yeah,' Steve smiled fondly. 'Got in a few hours ago. I came and said hi, but I think you were only half awake. I got a shower, checked on this little guy, then I had to go to a debrief that took half the night but-'
The song, the exact song started playing at a volume so high the vent was shaking. Peter cheered and went to look for a way out into the room. He'd like to see any monster standing up to
It was an excellent question, at which point Natasha lost herself completely, laughing hysterically into the cushion, and leaving poor Steve more baffled than ever before. And then, for no reason at all that she could figure out, the laughs turned back to sobs. After a moment, she felt the couch cushions sag by her feet, and then Steve's kind, reassuring hand was making small circles on her back. She concentrated on the movement and said, 'You can have the pill. It stops you getting pregnant but it also... makes all this, better. For most people.'
'I know, I saw,' his dad said, and pulled Peter into a tight hug. He was smiling as much as Peter was. At least he appreciated how cool this was. A few days ago, Peter would never,
'Oh, calm down sweetheart, before you wrinkle that pretty face,' Tony tried to smile winningly, but it went down even worse than the first one. Steve sat back, folding his arms. 'It's not as dramatic as you think. One of my... colleagues has been researching animal survival traits. Lizards regrowing limbs, spiders sensing danger, that kind of thing. Seeing if it could be used for human enhancement was the idea, although, of course, he was too dumb to get it off the ground. But using a little dash of my dad's vitaray stuff and the genius of yours truly...' He waved a hand to indicate it was no big deal. 'Think of it as the same as what was done to you, only... themed.'
'Easy,' Steve said, and apparently without thinking, rubbed Tony's back as if he was Peter. 'You've woken up a few times, but you weren't really making sense. You don't remember?'
'Captain Rogers is currently attending a public relations seminar at Shield. The one you are also supposed to be at.'
'Peter!' He said, racing forward, not even thinking about what he was going to do, so desperate was he to get Peter away, away from anything that could hurt him, he was on Venom's
‘Yeah, and then you smashed my window so you owe me for that,’ Stark shrugged, settling himself onto the couch to wait. ‘Anyway, this is for your benefit. Have you even left the house since you brought Pete home? You need to get out, so does he. He’s not dead yet.’
Before long, he was deeper than the moonlight could reach, and he stepped forward blindly a few paces before his grasping hands hit a rubble wall of dislodged earth and rock; the cave in Miss Maximoff had told him about. Pietro must be on the other side of it, or worse, underneath it.
'We don't understand your powers yet, and I don't have time to argue. You stay here.' Steve reached into his pocket and pulled out Peter's precious phone. He'd picked it up almost on reflex before they left the hospital room, and now returned it to its owner. 'You put your playlist on, okay? I'll be back soon.'
'You know why he's never seen with men, Steve? Let me tell you about the absurd levels of petty-mindedness Tony Stark can achieve. He did have a boyfriend once, as a teenager, and his dad found out, and was
ridiculous; the situation itself or the way it had come about. Because the road to this moment had started months before, when Shield had turned out to be riddled with Hydra double agents, when the helicarrier had crashed, and when Tony had visited Steve in the hospital only to be told, slowly and haltingly and so, so sorrowfully, that his parents hadn't died in an accident at all. That they had been murdered by Hydra. By the man now standing in the hall of his parent's mountain retreat, glaring at the snow piled up in the door frame as if the look alone could melt it.
'No, Steve, listen.' Sarah said, firmly. 'He was very impressed with your painting. He talked about it a lot, apparently he's already hung it in the hall of his apartment. And he said, if you didn't want to go through with the marriage but let him keep the painting anyway, he'd let us keep the ring.'
'I made a bad decision,' Bucky said. 'Really bad. I hurt someone, and I gave them the worst possible advice. I was young and it was a different time, and they could have gotten into a ton of trouble, but...' he shrugged, downing the last of his own wine. 'I regretted it then and I have ever since. I wish I'd been braver. I wish I'd told them to do what made them happy. That was the biggest mistake I ever made.'
'I don't care about them,' Steve said. 'I can be with you, tell people I'm with you, tell people how I feel about you, and no-one's going to put me in jail for it.'
'I'm standing in front of you, they won't see you,' Steve replied, lining himself up a little more neatly. 'Finish that drink. And mine.' He passed over his half-finished bubble tea, strawberry and peach, the same as Tony's.
Sometimes someone came in to check on him, to bring him water he didn't drink or food he didn't eat. Rhodes came in and they talked, and Rhodey said he should let himself cry but no, there was no need to cry yet, not yet, not when it wasn't real yet. So he promised Rhodey he would get up soon, didn't mean it, and eventually Rhodey had to leave.
It was hot. Way too hot. He was going to faint. Was that why he couldn't remember? He was going to die.
Stark removed one arm from around the red-head's waist to remove his sunglasses, and surveyed Steve.
Steve sighed. He couldn't forget that, no matter what he had done, Stark was dangerous. And , from the looks of things, a little deranged.
'Tony? What's wrong?' Steve asked, dropping the wreath onto the bed without further ceremony and sitting beside him. His eyes were full of concern,
'I was wondering if I could talk to you about my godson, Peter,' Steve said more loudly. 'He's a great kid. It's his birthday on Friday, he'll be four. He's a huge fan of Iron Man.'
Ugh. He had always been hopeless at poetry. The words he was trying to put to the feeling were too inadequate, too cheesy. It was much more simple than that. He knew, however irrational it was, and however unlikely it was to happen, that he wanted to be with this man, dancing, every second for the rest of his life. And that feeling might just break his heart.
Tony did so. 'Sweetheart,' he said, looking at Steve's hurt, angry expression. 'It's going to be okay. We'll find out how they got it and sue the pants off whoever gave it to them and in a couple of weeks everyone will have moved on to the next thing. Or I can just do something really big and stupid right now and take the spotlight off you. I always kind of wanted to try skiing down the Grand Canyon. I bet if I wore the armour-'
With that, Steve fell silently into step beside him, a solid and reassuring presence. Tony found himself blinking back tears again – an annoying habit he'd developed since losing Venom – because he didn't deserve this. He didn't deserve to have anyone beside him, and yet, Steve stayed, sitting beside him in the back of the cop car, staying in the room while he was processed, and walking with him all the way to the holding cell. The pity in his face when the door was about to shut nearly broke Tony's heart.
'Sap,' Clint said, and then his phone started buzzing. He pulled it out of his pocket and they both saw the caller ID.
to some researcher or lawyer or administrator Tony was unlikely to ever talk to. This man worked in his house, it was personal, intimate – he saw his trash, for goodness' sake, and after a similar stint in the lab Tony had once eaten 12 Krispy Kremes in a single afternoon. Tony ought to have at least known he existed.
that they forced Steve to wear round his shoulders. He needed the lift in spirits after the morning he'd had. Missing six months of school in every subject at once was no joke.
‘Really? Huh, and he told me he could keep a secret.’ Stark’s voice was the picture of mild offence. Steve’s control finally shattered.
. Love at first sight and all that crap. And the only word he could get out, the only thing he could say to his literal
'No,' Steve said. 'The trail's dead anyway. You go home, get some sleep, get a shower, and we'll come tomorrow.'
The flight suit felt somehow tighter tonight, as if something inside him was reluctant to go outside and face the light and the noise again, but Tony ignored the feeling. He stepped out of the car, briefcase in hand, and went on his way.
He started crying, even though he knew he should be brave and strong, because he couldn't help it, because his dad was Captain America, and he'd saved Peter, and a monster had eaten Mr Stark, and Peter didn't really get what was happening, but it had all started because he was sick and Mr Stark had helped him and now it had all gone crazy and he
‘Relax. We’re only going to the museum, there’s a bench every three feet if he needs it. Anyway, I thought he might find it interesting, get to know you better.’
But that was before Afghanistan. Before she was kidnapped and held hostage. And here's the thing about kidnappers - they aren't particularly concerned with their hostage's sanitary hygiene or providing her with tampons, towels, or access to contraception. Really, Natasha supposed she ought to just be grateful that she hadn't been raped; but frankly she wasn't surprised they weren't tempted.
a dad. A dad who loved him and meant the world to me. The first friend I had here. I don't want to just act like he was never here.'
On his days off, it would usually be eight or nine am before Steve showed up in the common areas; but on days like this, when he was needed at Shield, he liked to have an excessive amount of time to get ready. Sure enough, at 6.35, just as Tony was nodding off in a chair, he appeared, hair wet from the shower, sticking up in spikes where he had combed it. He looked at Tony.
The place was undoubtedly a dive, lit by neon tubes and exposed light bulbs. Everyone at the sticky tables seemed to either be there alone, glaring at anyone who came near, or in twos and threes piled in each other's laps, drunkly making out. It was not the sort of place one would expect to find a billionaire, but Steve's Google Alert had told him Tony Stark had been sighted here, so Steve had to at least check it out. He was not invited to the same sort of clubs, parties and restaurants that Tony Stark was, and waiting outside them had got him nothing but the odd punch from a bouncer or bodyguard. But this bar was the sort of place that would let anyone in and not tell anyone you had been there, and so Steve had left Peter dozing off over a colouring book at the hospital and rushed over. It was three in the afternoon.
He prepared the syringe, turned over Peter's unresisting hand, and injected it into his wrist. Then several things happened at once, that took a moment for Tony to sort out in his head.
‘Mr Stark!’ Peter hadn’t wanted to get up again that day, but now he was peering round the door to his room, and once he saw who it was, he beamed and ran across the room, throwing his arms round Stark’s waist. Steve had never seen him greet anyone like that, except himself.
The Spectrum was unlike any other establishment in town. More of a bar than a club, and more of a club than a bar, it defied definition. For one thing, instead of being pitch black, the place was softly lit with coloured lights, mirrors, glittering chandeliers and crystals, every surface sparkling. To the right of the bar was a large area full of secluded booths, each one closed on three sides and piled high with luxurious cushions and soft furnishings, with a rose-coloured lamp to read the drinks menus and colour guides by. The rest of the place was given over to a heaving dance floor and stage. There was live music almost every night, though today the music was being pumped out through speakers and the stage was being taken over by dancers looking for some space. It was crowded even compared to usual.
Tony had no idea what the origins of the insult could have been, but he was delighted with the expression it produced on Osborn's face. Apparently unable to answer, Osborn and his cronies slinked away.
Steve couldn't help it, he laughed. Then he took Tony's hand. 'Then our cover is blown. Come on, Bar.'
'You are so like your father,' Steve remarked, which killed Tony's libido in a single stroke. Even his flight suit seemed to tense in disgust.
Surprising absolutely nobody, money really had made a difference to Steve's life. Getting him healthy enough physically and financially to go back to school and finish his bachelor's, for one thing. Getting his mother somewhere decent to live, for another. Plus the Maria Stark foundation was starting to make a difference in lives across the world, in all sort of ways. None of that, though, had made as much of an impact as Tony himself. Simply the act of loving, and being loved in return, made Steve feel alive in whole new ways. They'd done the whole thing backwards, getting married first and then getting to know each other after, but there wasn't a day in his life that Steve didn't wake up thinking how lucky he was. So he smiled back at Tony, taking off his graduation cap and plopping it onto Tony's head, before pulling him in for a kiss again. In the back of his mind, he was making all sorts of plans about what he was going to do just as soon as he could get Tony into the school and the back of a deserted supply closet. Preferably one where they kept paint.
'No,' Steve said, shortly, dropping into the chair next to the desk he so clearly wasn't going to be invited to use. 'I can't. Messes with my medication. Messes me up.' He decided not to mention the beer from the other night and looked pointedly at the glass in Stark's hand. Stark laughed.
'Steve,' Peter said, 'I'm finished!' He proffered up the cereal bowl. There was still more than half left.
'And the candle,' Steve said, pointing to the candle at the top, 'Is to remind us that Jesus is the light of the world.'
documentary – where it had said that all the army guys had said no to him, but he had wanted to help anyway. And now Peter had to do the same. Mr Stark was Iron Man, and now his dad was Captain America, and they helped people all the time. Well now Peter had to help them.
'Good morning, Sheriff.' He said, cheerily, shaking Steve's hand with a grip firmer than any Steve had ever felt. 'I think you're expecting me. Shall we go in?'
It always happened quite suddenly, this snap back to reality after he'd finished a project. It was also usually quite jarring, and was probably why he spent so long tinkering in the final stages, getting everything perfect before admitting something was finished. After days of working non-stop, totally focused, barely eating or sleeping, fuelling himself with work, and coffee, and ideas, after days of successfully not noticing anyone or anything, reality always liked to show back up with a vengeance. The moment he put down the last tool or finished the last scan, it would be waiting there to reassert itself.
Tony nodded and they started to head for the doors, but then, Tony's screen blacked out. The suit whirred, powering down, and fell off him in segments, even as he made to grab at it. He pulled the helmet off himself, trying to see what was happening. What he saw was one of the guards, one of the hundred they had knocked out that day, obviously concious, standing at one of the computer terminals, looking very pleased with himself.
but he suspected Cap was probably right. And the thick hoodie wouldn't be helping matters. Beneath it, Tony was acutely aware that his shirt would probably have to be removed with a chisel.
'Also the season for mistletoe,' Bucky said from the doorway, pointing above their heads to where there was indeed a sprig of mistletoe hanging over the sink, exactly where Steve was standing. It had not been part of the decorations Tony had had prepared.
In the end, the charge was seventy-two counts of causing grievous injury and eleven counts manslaughter; because while the court accepted that the murders had been greatly influenced by the symbiote Venom, there was insufficient scientific proof to completely absolve Tony of any responsibility. It was pretty much what Tony had expected, but when they met in the briefing room to wait for the sentence to be decided, Steve couldn't hold still.
Peter nodded. His face was turned to the side, nestled against Steve's chest, so he saw Stark first, and smiled.
After the argument, Steve had waited in Tony's room for over an hour before giving up and leaving himself. After that, it was only another hour or so until the warning went off and the Avengers were required to assemble again. When Steve arrived, Tony was already there – wearing the armour, his face hidden. He didn't say anything to Steve.
'Whereas Steve,' Bucky shot back, 'Could have a drink and a half and then he'd throw up everywhere and pass out by the bins.'
They had spent so many Saturday and Sunday mornings like this, lying close together in the gentle, sleepy quiet. Eventually they would start chatting, about nothing in particular, and then the teasing and playfighting would start, and it would either end in sex or breakfast. Steve liked both ways. They had problems, of course they did, but the problems were all external. They faced them together. It was simple. It was happy. It was beautiful, rare and precious.
'Not well enough! What happens the next time Fisk, or someone exactly like him, comes calling?! Because they will come, Steve, and if you can't defend yourself then-!' He cut himself off, smashing the hammer viciously down onto the now-cooling metal, the sound reverberating around them. He looked Steve dead in the eyes, defiant. 'I can't go through that again. I
Tony didn't notice him at first, absorbed in his work. He'd abandoned his shirt entirely now, wearing only his vest, the muscles in his shoulders rippling as he hammered away at the red hot metal in front of him. The sight of him like that made Steve's breath hitch, but he shook himself sternly and pulled his shoulders back, arms folded, waiting to have his attention.
. She cleared her throat and continued, 'With not being on it. But I want to think about it, at least.'
Now he was just confused, and she was in serious danger of being completely distracted by the cute little furrow in his brow. 'I would?'
'Don't cry,' he said, and his voice sounded so panicked and yet commanding that it came out sounding exactly the same as his orders in the middle of a battle when everything had gone wrong and he was trying to salvage the situation. Natasha laughed in a watery sort of way. She knew she ought to be even more ashamed of herself, clinging onto Steve like this, but he was so big his arms went right round her. Steve was on every side of her, holding her so close that he was almost enclosing her. She felt safe. She felt like maybe she wasn't disgusting.
Steve shot him a look, finally leaning back in the chair. 'I'm his godfather, I make him say his prayers.'
and the words were changed just in case anyone – horror of horror – thought he was gay. No-one knows about your version. No-one's going to be able to find the recording.'
'It will be the end of the world if I don't get my just-engaged sex,' Tony grumbled, but reluctantly got off him and sat up, answering the phone. 'What?'
'The one that goes DA-DA-DEE-DA-DA-DA,' Peter said, singing in his most high pitched voice, trying to imitate the song he wanted. If anything on the playlist would hurt a monster, it would be that one. Unfortunately he had never really been able to hear what the words were.
It was, then, perhaps a blessing that Thor chose that moment rather than a few seconds later to enter, shoving a stumbling man in ahead of him. It just didn't feel much like one as Tony quickly withdrew his hand and leaned back in his chair. Steve got up, going to open the cell ready. The young man, he realised, was one of the newspaper men,Tiberius Stone. Tony was already cackling with delight. He had never liked Stone, not since the journalist had written a very unflattering and almost inflammatory expose of Tony's father instead of an obituary. Stone glared at him.
Doctors couldn't save Peter. Even if Steve had been able to afford the best doctors in the world, they would not have been able to save Peter. But doctors weren't as smart as Tony, and, unlike him, didn't have illegal-access to the barely-legal experiments of major corporations, Howard Stark's Vitaray research, a few precious scraps written by Erskine giving hints at his formula, and the DNA profile of the strongest symbiote in the universe.
work. More or less. He and Yinsen had built the suit in a strictly prioritised order, knowing there was only so long they could disguise the shape of it and that eventually even the most slow terrorist in the world would realise it was too man-shaped to possibly be a missile. So they came, sooner than Tony had hoped but, if he was honest, later than they could have reasonably expected.
Tony could feel a headache coming on. 'Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's happening?'
'Yes,' Yinsen said simply, and Tony didn't ask any more questions. It didn't matter. He was going to fix all of this. Other people, not enemy soldiers but innocent people were getting hurt, because of what he had made. He swore to himself that when he got home, when he got out of this, he was going to put it right. He was going to make the world better. He just had to get out first.
. And Tony had clung onto that, desperate to believe it was true but never really being sure, until Steve suddenly turned up at school again, looking blank. He hadn't even needed to open his mouth for Tony to understand what this meant, what had happened. Steve had been bound. Tony didn't want to believe it, but it was so obviously true that he couldn't deny it; Steve had agreed to forget. He'd given everything up, and Tony didn't know
'It'll work,' he'd said, 'You just have to trust me.' For once, he hadn't even sounded convinced himself.
'Good to have a clear out, huh?' Stark said, suddenly right next to him. Steve jumped, slammed his locker shut, and met Stark's glare with his own.
Tony laughed. 'You say the same thing to every horse you meet. And I think they've figured you out.'
Steve was a second behind him, but one of the tentacles already had Osborn pinned to the wall by his throat. Peter was strapped to a table in the centre of the room. The adult-sized restraints had obviously been too big, so he was bound with straps, wound into the restraints built into the table. From one of his arms, a slow drip of blood flowed down a tube, collecting in a flask at the bottom.
It is unclear what the legal ramifications of the announcement will be as Stark Industries is a board and shareholder controlled company. However, when asked whether they would go along with his decision, Mr Stark simply said he would 'handle it'.
When Howard had found out about them, Tony had begged him, desperately, not to kill Steve. When Steve had disappeared from school, Tony had assumed the worst until Howard had told him, sneering, to
Peggy replied right away, Steve was sure of it, but he couldn't see it. Every time he tried, he found himself blinking, vision blurring, going black. His stomach was screwing itself up into a ball again. He tried to ignore it, tried to go back to the screen, but the effort of it made his whole body lurch like he was walking the deck of a sinking ship. He didn't even make it to the bin in the corner of his room before he threw up.
Tony was still gesticulating, talking about the innovations, but Steve brought him up short, grabbing one of the waving hands, intertwining their fingers and squeezing, just briefly, before he had to let go. Tony smiled.
'I didn't expect you to be so eager,' his mom said to him, when he was ready to go twenty minutes early. 'Is there something you're not telling me?'
And Tony suddenly realised just how close they had been standing this whole time. He realised it because in one easy movement Steve turned, putting down an arm either side of Tony, trapping him against the counter. Tony looked up at him, heart thudding. He'd had dreams that had started this way. Steve leaned in toward him, pressing a hand to Tony's cheek. Tony shut his eyes, opening his lips, but the kiss he expected didn't come. Instead, he felt Steve whisper into his ear, so close that he could feel his breath, feel the ghost of lips on his ear and cheek, making his stomach flip and his body shiver.
'Tony,' Steve said, softly, stopping his words. And that was all he needed to say. A moment later, he was in Steve's arms and they were fulfilling the tradition very thoroughly indeed.
Steve hesitated outside the door to the bar, more so he could tell himself he had than out of any sense of indecision. Six months ago he would never even have considered this, but it was not six months ago, and time was running out. This might be the only chance he had.
(‘And the next time Tony showed up,’ Bucky would say, as the laughter died down. ‘This stupid punk looks into those big brown doe eyes of his and can’t bear to let him down and so
It was all fine and comfortable until they reached the door of the bathroom. Tony’s legs froze and he stopped, unable to make himself go forward. What if he got shut inside, alone, in the pitch-dark?
“Breakfast.” Steve said curtly, sliding the food bowl across the floor with his foot. The others went back to what they were doing and Tony stared down at the food, his stomach churning at the thought of eating it once again. Smelling it made him feel vaguely sick.
Steve buried his face in his hands. 'Can we please just never speak of this again?' he asked, his voice muffled.
'You're drunk,' the cold voice said. The surgeon. 'Have some respect. I'm going to fetch more bandages, and you'd best be gone when I return.'
Around noon, he was standing in the kitchen making toast for their lunch, when Peter sidled in, hovering nervously in the doorway.
He left the office and walked off down the hall. He wasn't going to go back to Peter just yet. Not until he'd found something to punch into the dirt.
, losing Steve completely when he started talking about science; but his enthusiasm was contagious. By the time the waitress came and apologetically told them they were about to close, Steve was three-quarters in love already. As if he hadn't been from the moment Barnaby had chosen to shelter in his booth. They went outside and stood beneath a lamppost, neither of them wanting to go home just yet. They lapsed into silence.
. In all of this, he had never got the man's number. It was probably for the best, though. Clear boundaries were obviously essential with the man.
It was his old room. 'Room' was a strong word; it was more of an alcove with a door, originally intended to hide the boiler that was plumbed into the wall at the foot of his bed. The door was standing open, letting him see out into the lounge. It was a view he'd seen a thousand times growing up, but not one he had ever expected to see again.
. Steve, let me tell you a little known fact about Tony Stark: He is bisexual. Well, really, I'd just say he isn't fussy, but for simplicity's sake, let's call him bisexual.'
And they rocketed up at speeds Steve wouldn't have thought possible. He knew he was putting an awful lot of trust in someone who probably wouldn't hesitate to drop him if things didn't go his way. But until Peter was safe, it was a risk he would have to take.
'N-no,' Peter said, trying to take deep breaths so the crying would stop. 'I-it was just me and Mr Osborn and Harry.'
Steve started and blinked at Tony. His eyes were glassy, almost like he was tipsy too, or like he was about to cry.
'Unacceptable,' Tony grumbled, resting his head against Steve's chest. Steve put his arms around him, dropping a kiss into his hair before releasing him and heading back to his own chair. 'I'm going to invent a fully automated mechanical body. We're going to live forever.'
'Sit down,' Steve said again, laughter in his voice and mischief in his eyes. He could get like that, Tony had discovered, up for practical jokes or teasing as long as nobody got hurt. He'd evidently decided that it would be the height of entertainment to see Tony sticking stuff in an orange in the name of Christmas.
Tony’s lips brushed his gently. At least, Steve thought they did. He was blind and everything felt very far away.
'I'm sick of seeing that stupid expression on your face, Steve,' Pepper said, into the silence. 'Just, just, I don't know. Sleep with him or marry him or do whatever you need to do so you can get your brain out of your pants and not go around attacking housekeepers for him.' She turned back to Tony. 'I think I can keep this out of the courts and the papers, but I hope you realise you are putting
'And what's going on here?' Meredith had entered the room. Osborn dropped the papers back down on the desk.
Tony wrinkled his nose. The only university he was interested in going to was MIT, but his parents had said it was
'That reminds me, Mr Stark,' Steve said, very aware that Thor and Stone were both still watching. 'I was going to ask if you'd consider rigging us up some of those fancy electric lights in the square, for the dancing.'
'It's a Christingle,' Steve repeated, putting the board into the drainer before emptying the sink and turning to dry his hands. 'A Christingle, for Christmas.'
'woefully small'(2) and had to look more widely. Hannah Smith was selected by his parents because she was 'a goodly young lady, who spoke her prayers well, curtsied prettily and was pleasing to the eye with no sign of being marked for another' (3), and also because 'her family, being poor, and often burning straw instead of wood or coal, are most mindful of the elevation that might be brought upon them by the marriage, and wept with gratitude for the charity being done them' (4). Once married, there are few mentions of Hannah in Monkton's diary.
when he said he was bored, and found ways to try and challenge him. She even saw through him when he tried to use the 'I'm-only-terrible-in-class-because-I'm-bored' line to get out of gym class. He sort of hated her for that, but he respected her too. And all had been forgiven when she had given him his own key for the labs.
'Me too,' Peter agreed, fervently. The doctors were being extremely thorough in their examinations. Apparently Peter doing forward rolls continuously on his bed for half an hour wasn't enough proof that he had been cured and they were stuck waiting for them to be completely satisfied before Peter could be discharged.
Peter huffed loudly and rolled back onto his back, but even that didn't get his dad's attention. He was
'Nah,' Bucky said. 'Remember they're doing this to make themselves look good. The more pathetic you look the better. No offence,' he added quickly, seeing Steve's scowl. He took the list, drawing an arrow and scribbling
Tony looked delighted and started rambling about coloured glass and hidden mirrors and generators and fuses and a whole bunch of other stuff Steve didn't understand, but he could have listened all day. Tony was gesticulating widely as he talked, thoughts so quick and large that he was unable to express himself with his words alone, the beautiful lights reflecting in his eyes.
applied to most of the shop's patrons. The only reason he knew Stark wasn't here already, not recognising him, was that Steve was the only one sitting alone.
'Anyway, it isn't really my choice. I'm not going to make Peter call me anything he doesn't want to,' Steve concluded.
He crawled easily down and got onto the road on the other side before setting off at a run towards where, in the distance, he could just see Mr Stark's tower dominating the skyline.
Tony sighed deeply, and allowed himself to slither off the step completely. 'You're going to be the death of me, Margaret Carter.'
And Tony knew exactly who it was. Only one other person had touched his bag, while he was engrossed in his work and distracted enough not to notice them taking the key. It was Osborn, Norman Osborn, he had taken the key and snuck down and done
'It's okay,' Tony said automatically, even though he wasn't sure it was yet. 'We'll work it out. Jarvis, where is Steve?'
Getting to Osborn's house took a while, longer than Steve wanted, but with the armour gone they had to 'borrow' a car, and no matter how recklessly you were willing to drive navigating city traffic was always going to slow you down. Then, once they arrived at the house, they had to scale the fence; easy enough for Steve, but Stark had been on another level, practically leaping over it, and as he passed Steve had seen his eyes, and there wasn't much sense left in them. He had really started to worry, then, but his priority was, as always, Peter.
He looked round the shop, the buckets and boxes of cut flowers and bouquets, the trays of seedlings and shelves of houseplants, the ceiling trellis full of heavy wisteria flowers that Mr Flynn had been gradually growing since they opened almost forty years ago, but he didn’t see any of it. He felt completely dazed. Like he’d just skipped over a line between ‘before’ and ‘after’ that was always going to divide his life.
Time was suspended. He lay in bed, knowing he could never leave it, because all that was out there was a world without Steve. While he stayed in bed, it wasn't real. Not yet. Time had stopped.
'Nope,' Tony agreed, because while he liked the aesthetic of them, he imagined that would soon wear off when dealing with feeding, and poop, and trying to keep that magnificent plumage clean. 'So, did it at any point in this process occur to you that maybe I'd like some time to enjoy being engaged? That maybe I'd like to have a role in planning my own wedding?'
The voice inside him roared with displeasure as he walked away, giving up his shot of seducing the Captain whilst he was an easy mark. This wasn't how Tony Stark did things. Tony Stark put his wants over everyone else's needs. He did not let the things he wanted pass him by when they were sitting there just waiting to be taken.
'What, seriously?' Bucky asked, and Steve pulled out his cheek to show the back of his top row of teeth, which was indeed gap free.
, and something Steve had done, a mistake he had made, and now all was lost. Perhaps it was shell shock, Peggy thought, a hysterical, nervous attack over something that had happened years ago, a comrade lost in the war. She didn't dare let go of him long enough to get him a brandy, and doubted the alcohol would have any effect anyway. The other thing was, she supposed, to slap him; try and shock him back to reality, but he was crying so brokenly in her arms that she couldn't bear to give him any more pain. So, wondering if she really was acting in his best interest, she let him cry, holding him tightly, stroking his back and his hair, trying to ground him.
'Mm?' Tony said, because it really wasn't fair of Steve to expect him to make conversation when he was this relaxed, and when, by all natural laws they should have fallen into lazy kisses by now.
'He might be right, Stevie,' Sarah said gently. 'And, you know, it will stop them from expecting anyone more... experienced.'
It hadn't all gone according to plan. Steve had planned to propose during their big anniversary dinner, had not planned to get married with traces of charcoal still in his hair, or with smudges still on Tony's jacket. But the rest, he had admitted, was as he had hoped.
At first he had thought Meredith must be one of the parents. He'd seen her impeccable dress, her thick brown hair, seen that she couldn't have been older than 35 at the absolute most, and seen how Howard immediately turned on the charm; and thought that Howard would not flirt with one of his teachers. Except he would, and he did, and the older he got the less Tony could blame him. Meredith had a strong, lilting Irish accent that came out from behind a no-nonsense smile that seemed to send all the male teachers and older guys gaga. She introduced herself as what she called 'The Head of Lower School' and which actually translated to being the one in charge of the 8-12 year olds. The kids that liked her nicknamed her 'Auntie Meredith'. The ones that didn't called 'The Babysitter'. Tony was one of the kids that liked her. She neither went all gooey about his abilities like most of the adults Tony met, nor ignored them like his Dad. Instead she called him into meeting after meeting in her office, challenged him about playing up in class, actually
'No,' Tony said, not sure whether it was true or not. Then again, he was not normally in the lab so long.
But he had promised confidentiality. He had signed several non-disclosure agreements to that effect. And behaviour since aside, Stark had been great at the hospital visit; showing Peter the simulation, taking the picture, giving him the phone… he had been so gentle with Peter, made him so happy. It was like two different people.
Right. The Captain was not Tony's usual variety of airhead; he wasn't just going to take whatever story Tony gave him. Tony shrugged. 'I don't compromise my identity for just anyone. I did a bit of digging.'
The box was there. But as she took a deep, steadying breath and felt inside, it was empty. Her period was starting and she didn't have anything to stop it with.
be telling about this. Otherwise, the job was great. The old couple that owned and ran the place, Mr and Mrs Flynn, were friends of his mother’s, and had approached Steve to see if he wanted the job for a few months. They knew all about his health problems and were quite happy to let him sit down while he worked, which was more than could be said for every other store Steve had tried to work at. He usually lasted about two days before his traitorous joints locked up so much he couldn’t even get out of bed. They were fine with him using his inhaler, even in front of customers, or stepping out for air if the pollens and the scents got too much. The colour blindness was more of a problem, but they had given him a chance anyway, and Steve had soon got used to identifying flowers and plants by their shape and scent, even if they weren’t the same colour in his eyes as they apparently were in everyone else’s. Steve had gotten pretty good at arranging bouquets, their beauty in the shape and sculpture and arrangement of them. By Steve’s second week, Mr Flynn had looked at one of his bouquets and laughed, saying there was nothing more they could teach him.
'Can I offer you anything?' She asked, as Steve sat down in front of her desk. 'Tea? Coffee? This is early even for you.'
'Electrified?!' Peter almost lost his grip. He had been climbing quickly, and now he was almost a whole storey up. Far enough that a fall would hurt, or worse.
'From the changes in your behaviour and personality, sir, I can safely say your actions were from the Venom symbiote, not you.'
'He did, did he?' He asked, and laughed. Peter didn't like that laugh. His stomach was tingling worse than ever now. He put the rest of the juice back on the table. 'Well, Peter, you shouldn't listen to everything Mr Stark says. He's a killer.'
Stark said nothing, watching Steve with an incredulous expression. Steve took this as a sign that he ought to continue.
'Of course I'm worried, you dolt, I've been worried about you ever since we met, but everything with Fisk...' Tony took a deep breath, then, not quite able to meet Steve's eye, he added, '...the drink helped. But since I took the pledge, it's gotten harder.'
Bucky looked up at the ceiling for a long moment, gathering his thoughts, then he turned back to Steve. 'I still don't like it,' he said. 'Are you really sure about this? What if you end up with someone awful?'
'I'm going to get a drink,' he said, heading into the kitchen. He was angry, and he didn't want it to explode out at them. None of it was their fault. Apart from the
'Sheriff!' The first he was aware of Miss Maximoff was when she grabbed his arm. 'Please, I need your help, it's Pietro.'
his painting wasn't worth that, at least if he went through with the stupid marriage he was selling himself for the money, it was closer to a true exchange – but this would pay their debt off in a single go. If they were careful, saving as much of it as they could, he could probably cover his medical bills for the rest of his life and still have enough over for rent. Not to mention he could see Barnaby again; help him with whatever he was stuck with, make things change. Steve valued his pride pretty highly, but if it could take being a dime bride it could take this. He could accept help, accept charity, if it gave him the slightest chance with his soulmate, if it gave him back the slightest glimmer of hope; so he nodded. 'Okay. Yes. Yeah. Let's do that. Let's pull out and sell the ring.'
' Tony repeated, exasperated, knocking lightly on the bandages over Steve's chest. 'Thor set it up. I think he's been looking for something like this for a while. You know, where we're such good
As soon as Tony walked in, he was met by four sets of glares. Bruce wasn’t there, but Tony figured he would have glared too, if he had been. They were all still angry.
Tony shook his head and sprinted after them, the weakness he’d felt after the spell fading as he ran towards the…
Tony could run if he wanted, and he stared longingly at the open door the entire time Steve was gone. When he came back holding an orange bottle he didn’t shut it behind him.
Tony’s eyes landed on the tree he had been under. It was only a couple feet from the fence; maybe he could jump off of it to reach the top?
“Is there also some top-secret reason that Iron Man has been gone for a couple months? The press keeps speculating that he’s been wounded within an inch of his life, or that he has like, a brain tumor, or something. So everyone is really worried… He’s okay, right?” Spider-Man rambled, then his shoulders hunched as the team all stared at him. Pepper had been trying to reign in the press, but she could only do so much. They just had to deflect and pray this kid didn’t manage to add two and two together to equal
“Well, we’ll need x-rays for his chest, too, so we might as well get it all done.” Hannah walked over to the curtain and grabbed the edge of it before she looked back at Steve and raised her eyebrows.
“Where have you been all morning? You barely even said hello yesterday. Is everything alright?” Tony peeked his head over Peter’s shoulder and she made a face. “A cat? Peter, you know I do all I can to support us, but we can’t-”
“She’s still alive, ‘cause of you, buddy. Thank God you’re one stubborn sonovabitch who doesn’t know when to quit.” Clint sat back and got out his phone again, and Tony’s tail swished back and forth on top of the covers in the quiet. He craned his neck around to see that the clock on the wall read 6:32- and it definitely wasn’t p.m..
The doors slid open and Pepper Pots made an aborted step forward, frowning at Peter and then at the cats he was escorting. She likely knew the list of people that had access to the Avenger’s quarters and the upper half of the building in general; Peter was a stranger to her.
“Tony was thrown off the roof when the magic... exploded, and Bruce is over there.” He pointed with his nose to the door, where Bruce was still unconscious. He hadn’t strayed far from the entrance, unsure if they would need the Hulk or not. Natasha nodded, and led them over to the pile of clothing. Steve was the first one to prod him.
“We can do it out there, let me grab a towel.” Bruce called, disappearing briefly before he walked back out and sat down on the edge of the bed. He spread the towel out on his lap and beckoned Tony over. “Put you head on my knees so that we don’t drop any toothpaste on your floor.”
Tony had no idea what he was supposed to do. The room was suddenly roaring with the echoes of the hairy insects and the scaffolding was screaming as it buckled; he was nearly thirty feet up in the air, and he couldn’t jump, he couldn’t climb back down because he likely wouldn’t make it in time.
“Miss Potts, there’s been a situation. Nobody is hurt, and everybody is accounted for, but I would prefer to debrief you in person, and privately.”
“Oh Tony, what have you gotten yourself into this time? They called me when it first happened, but I’ve been so busy in Malibu, I couldn’t come back until yesterday. You’re always getting into some mess or another.” She murmured, and Tony heaved a sigh. He let his tail flop and set his head back down. Pepper paused, shifting position and letting her hand rest on his head.
Tony found an alley with a brick wall at the end, and considered his options. He could use the close walls to propel himself up and out. He could also use the dumpster as a platform to jump off and onto a wall, and from there he could use his momentum to clear the barrier. He made up his mind and leaped onto the dumpster, then straight at the wall. Tony had a second of panic as he slipped, but then he pushed off and jumped over the brick wall without a scratch. Easy.
“Woah, Thor, wait. We know nothing about this dog. What if he’s here to hurt Stark? When we found them the first time, it was attacking him. This dog broke his leg! Why should we let him anywhere near him?” Clint said, holding his arms out to stop Thor from going down to the workshop.
“Good morning.” Steve said, looking up from the book he was holding. Tony didn’t catch the title before he put it down. “It’s around ten o’clock.” Tony looked around, but he really couldn’t tell besides the analog clock hanging across the room; they didn’t have any windows and the only difference from earlier in the morning was that the hallway lights were on.
Tony’s ankle finally healed, at least enough to stop wrapping it and to start putting weight on it again. Steve and him resumed the runs during their morning outings.
Please leave some feedback if you can, since I still think this sucks, and it really helps when you guys are encouraging about my writing! Every time i get more kudos or a new comment, i binge-write for at least an hour. It really helps boost my motivation! Not to say that you need to leave something for me to write more, or something like that. I just really love it! And I hope this chapter wasn't
Steve went slow at first, but the more Tony tugged him on, the faster they got, until they were both sprinting full-tilt down the sidewalk. Steve guided them all the way to central park and they ran halfway around before Tony started to get tired. They slowed down to a walk and Steve found a bench, flopping down and staring out over the grass while Tony tried to catch his breath.
“Well, Vivian, I’m Peter Parker. Nice to meet you.” It took Tony a few seconds to register the name, and he made sure to remember it. Once Tony was human again, this kid was getting a pay raise.
His story finally trailed off, and they breathed in the silence, his face buried in Tony’s side as he clutched at the dog like a lifeline.
The team had all fled the communal area as soon as they got back though Bruce had gone into the kitchen while everyone else went to their rooms, likely to get some tea while everyone else showered the disgusting bug guts off. Tony didn’t hear Bruce come back into the living room, but he felt a comforting hand on his shoulder after almost a minute of creative scream-swearing into the poor pillow.
Tony lifted his arm again and looked at it, shouting obscenities when he realized what had happened. He was covered in fur, and Loki had said ‘transformation spell’. From the look of his hand- paw, damnit- he was some kind of dog.
“If you ever tell anyone that I cried, no-obody will find your body.” Clint said, though it was an empty threat and he hiccuped halfway through it anyhow. Tony nodded solemnly.
“Does this spell out ‘Tony’?” He asked, and Tony nodded frantically. Thor seemed a bit surprised. “You understand english?” Thor was bemused, bending down again. Tony nodded and Thor frowned even harder.
. “-it’s easier to see. There’s Tony Stark, the business man. The way he always smiles at the cameras with that crazy mega-watt grin you never see anywhere else, because it’s stiff and doesn’t reach his eyes.” Clint sat up, leaning back on his hands. “That’s his mask, the persona he hides himself behind. You wouldn’t think of him as a turtle but he really has a sort of shell. We don’t know who he actually is, because we didn’t bother to look any farther than that fake bravado he’s always got going.” The room was silent when Clint finished, and he looked around the room defensively. “What? A spy has to be good at reading people.” He grumbled, finally standing up from the floor and rolling out his shoulders.
“When did this happen? Where?” He took over Steve’s spot, looking through Tony’s fur to find the scabbed cut.
She groaned, sliding her hands to the floor and heaving herself into a standing position, leaning against the wall since she couldn’t put any weight on her bad leg. Tony rooted around the room and brought back a two-by-four that hadn’t been burnt for Natasha to use as a crutch. She seemed groggy, but she limped after him as he led her back towards the steps.
His feet scrambled for purchase on the hardwood floor as he slid into the living room. Sure enough, robots were whizzing by the windows, the impacts of fighting reverberating in the air.
Tony was dozing in his bed when Steve jogged into the kitchen, right at six thirty, like clockwork. Except this time when he started in on his ritual pre-run fruit mix he looked over at Tony and spoke up.
“I am not picking up traces of our young friend. Perhaps he was waylaid by law enforcement before he managed to return?” Thor called. They all converged in the main living space and exchanged helpless glances.
Tony pushed the bowl away with his paw and turned to the fridge, but Steve blocked his way, arms crossed and jaw set in anger.
“He’s here, but he’s unconscious. Loki had put some kind of illusion over the containment unit, because when we first got here it looked like he was still in here. After Thor realized it was a trick it kind of flickered, and then he was gone, and Agent Monroe was laying here-”
Natasha and Clint were occasionally in the kitchen, often at the same time. Tony always offered to talk and they always politely declined, though they did seem to generally talk more about other things as time went on. The world was for once so calm and normal that Tony was actually surprised when they got another summons from Fury- this time, for only Tony.
“What do you want? I thought you were rotting in Asgardian prison.” Tony hissed, rubbing his thumb on one of the homing bracelets he had on. The suit could get there in a minute or two, but depending on what Loki was up to, Tony had no idea if that would be soon enough.
Steve was getting on his nerves more than usual lately, always carrying a short fuse and more than ready to work Tony into blind rage. He had the uncanny ability to piss Tony off like few people had ever managed. Government officials and militant leaders were the first two, and Steve Rogers had weaseled his way right into slot number three.
“Your job.” Coulson started, taking a deep breath in his nose and slowly letting it out through his teeth before he went on. “Your job, right now, is to sit there in your little tower and do. Nothing. Why? Because all. Of. You. Are compromised. And why is that?” Coulson continued, picking Tony up by his scruff and looking at him at eye level. “Because of you. You’re not allowed to do your job right now, because you fucked up, Tony Stark. You fucked up during Loki’s attack, and you just fucked up again today.” He bit out, waiting for it to sink in. Tony’s ears were flat back and he thought he might curl up and die of shame right then and there.
“This does concern me- you’re in my house. Get out.” Tony growled, tensed and ready to take the hit he knew was coming. The stranger’s tail whipped back and forth in anger and she flattened her ears with a hiss.
“I’ve got a good feeling about today, guys. Loki is in containment, There haven’t been any explosions, and I can fit into almost every small space I’ve found so far. It couldn’t be better.” They all exchanged exasperated looks, but Clint was already bouncing off to the kitchen where Coulson and Maria were putting together five bowls of cat food. None of them were thrilled about that particular development, but it wasn’t something that could be helped.
Clint handed Loki off to Bruce, who took him inside to look at his leg. The rest of the team stood together and didn’t seem to notice Tony stop behind a car a few yards off.
“It’s been a long time since I slowed down enough to enjoy the day like this.” Steve said, and Tony looked up from where he was licking his bowl clean to tilt his head. Steve chuckled and leaned back with his arms folded against his chest.
“We do indeed, Mister Parker. What would you like to watch?” The brand-new TV came to life and a mile-long list of films started scrolling by. A few of the cats perked up but Steve and Thor remained broody, the former up on a bookshelf and the latter moping underneath a chair.
Tony sat up to see Clint drifting around the kitchen, face blank but focus intense on his task of scooping what looked like cookie dough out onto metal cookie sheets. Tony frowned; Clint must have been absolutely silent up until the pans, because he’d made the entire bowl of dough without waking Tony at all.
“What’s the plan, Iron Man?” Steve asked, shoulder pressed against Tony’s as they surveyed the land in front of them. All of the houses were at least partially torn up, and one or two were just rubble. There was a distant thundering of the mechanical snake tearing up ground as it went, but the road they stood on was eerily silent, without even a breeze to kick up dust.
There was a grunt, then an inhale of breath, before the pile of clothes began shifting wildly as Bruce struggled to free himself. All four of the cats worked to untangle him and before long he was pressed against the door, fur fluffed up in fear. They all hung back warily; nobody knew if the magic had affected the Hulk too.
“I’ll bring you some more later, we want to make sure you don’t get sick before we give you a ton.” Steve tucked the tupperware back into his bag and Tony laid back down on his side, since he wouldn’t be going anywhere anyways and sitting up was making him feel groggy.
Either way, he needed to earn their trust and their acceptance. It hadn’t been easy just living with them, and Tony would have to swallow his pride to make them like him; but it was better, anyway. Tony probably deserved much more pain than he had gotten already and they were all inherently good people.
!” She emphasized, nearly poking Tony right in the chest as she continued. “The Fantastic Four are on standby if things get out of hand. You’re insane if you think I’ll help you get yourself killed.”
Tony sat down and worked on accepting his fate while Steve went through the bag and got out a few things.
“Damn, he really did a number on your leg. Bruce can check it out when we get back to the ‘jet.” Clint helped Loki up again and checked his other leg for wounds while Tony stared in disbelief. Logically, he knew that Clint wouldn’t realize that he had the wrong guy, but Tony was having a hard time accepting what was actually happening.
Tony felt embarrassed listening to it back, but Peter’s eyes were all doe-y and awed when the clip ended.
“-nthony, the beasts are vanquished. Anthony?” Thor was saying, apparently having missed Tony go under.
Success! His paws clumsily tapped away as he logged onto the Stark servers and painstakingly navigated his way through the security and into JARVIS’s servers.
“Stop for a minute- we want to take an initial reading.” Dawson’s voice was loud in the quiet and it startled him. Tony crouched behind a chunk of wall, breathing heavy from the exertion of being silent with so much weight on his back.
Deep breath. Tony was fine, he wasn’t going to die. Yet. Which meant he had to get away from Loki or otherwise stop him- alone, suitless, and no longer human. So Tony did what he did best, and turned his fear into a shield of anger, posturing in the vain attempt to buy time before the Avengers responded to the alert he’d put out before Loki turned him into a dog.
“Couldn’t sleep. I think all of us have that problem sometimes.” She said, wrinkling her nose when she took another sip of her cold drink. “Oy, gadost…” She muttered, and Tony had to assume it was russian, since it didn’t make a lick of sense to him.
Since he couldn’t get into his workshop, Tony decided to go down to the gym and run again; though he found out that he wasn’t the only one there. Steve was going hard at the heavy bag, while Natasha and Clint sparred in the ring towards the back. Bruce was even sitting on a bench with his tablet.
“You can speak to dogs.” Steve deadpanned, arms crossed and utterly unbelieving. The rest of the team shared similar looks of doubt.
“Alright, there? I can leave your lights on dim, if you’d like that.” She said, checking his chart at the foot of the bed. Tony wasn’t sure if they had all been briefed on him and knew who he was, but he nodded at her and she smiled again, glancing back one last time before she left, dimming the lights and leaving the door open a crack.
Immediately Fury looked to the agent on his left, and she took her backpack off and rummaged through until she pulled out something black and bulky, handing it to Fury. He tossed it right to Tony who had to roll off his bed and dodge it- it made a heavy
“Yea, memory loss is a bad sign. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to have her give him a check up.” Bruce nodded, patting Tony on the uninjured side of his face.
“Sorry, hon. I’ll be as gentle as I can.” She murmured, careful with the foot while she kept a firm grip on his leg to keep him from moving. She poked around the inflamed joint and had barely rotated it before Tony was trying to sit up, pulling to get his foot free because that
“Is that all you’ve got?” He huffed, tail lashing as she calculated her next move. She settled on another full-frontal attack and she descended upon Tony with renewed vigor, adrenaline spiking his heart rate and making his ears rush with the sound of blood.
The air was thick and acrid but Tony was low enough to be underneath the smoke as they made their way to the steps, painstakingly climbing over rubble and around the flames. The building was rumbling again when they reached the second floor, and they broke into an almost-run, being as careful as they could while moving as fast as the debris would let them. Tony was thankful for his new lungs; the arc reactor had damaged a lot of his human lungs, and he would have already been out for the count if he’d gone in without the suit.
“Let us settle this.” Thor said, looking at Steve to lead the way. The other Avengers gave Tony skeptical looks before they all headed downstairs to the workshop. Tony’s blood started to boil at the thought of Loki touching his stuff, and he had to consciously keep himself from growling.
“We’re going to talk to Loki, and see about getting you guys turned back.” He said, absent-mindedly stroking his fingers down Natasha’s back, who was nestled in the crook of his arm. Steve and Tony exchanged a glance before they got in the elevator, where Clint was also a little weirded out, Thor was grooming his ass, and Bruce looked like he was trying not to laugh.
can’t I lay on my own, god-damned couch?!” Tony shouted, and they all sobered up a little. They apparently hadn’t realized how much it bothered him. “It’s my couch. My chair. My whatever. It’s not like i’m going into your bedrooms and rolling all over your pillows. Lighten up.” Tony finished, wracking his brain for any other glaring mistakes his team had made. He didn’t come up with anything so he flopped back down, tirade officially over.
While they were waiting, Clint found them and filled them in on Natasha. She was going into surgery to have rods put in her leg, but she would be alright after some rest. They would be keeping her overnight to watch her breathing and make sure it didn’t get any worse.
“What time did he drop by?” Tony asked, taking the plate with him and returning to his desk. Dummy left the smoothie next to his keyboard and went back to his charging station to nap, or whatever it was the robots did when they re-charged. Butterfingers and U had been charging all day- they were getting software updates, and Tony wasn’t doing suit repairs, so he didn’t need any extra hands.
“Can you guys distract her? I need to use JARVIS to find the nearest SHIELD team. They’re bound to be swarming all over the place.” Tony meowed, already trotting over to the armor and activating the wrist panel.
Hiiiiii thanks for being patient with me! This chapter is kind of short, but ya'know. I'm doing my best!
Tony panicked and snapped his jaws shut on her hand. She gasped in pain and he let her go, scrambling for the edge, fight or flight instincts kicking in full-force. Natasha snagged him before he could go far and she slung him over her shoulder, gripping him tight enough to bruise as she hauled him back to his bedroom. Clint glared at him as they left, already heading to the communal bathroom to get the med kit.
Tony stopped in his tracks and barked, making Clint jump nearly a foot in the air. He whipped around and then relaxed when he didn’t see anything abnormal, instead glaring at Tony.
“There is some less-good news, though. You’ve got some fluid in your lungs- here-” She pointed, and Tony could
Apparently, Tony needed everything. They got him toys, brushes, bath soap (which would never be used if Tony had anything to say about it), a leash and harness, nail clippers, a bed (why the hell couldn’t he use his own?), dog food (no way would Tony be eating that crap), and finally, a few shirts. Clint actually picked out a Hawkeye hoodie and chased Tony halfway across the store before he could get it on him. Once it was on Tony found that he didn’t really mind it, so he allowed it to stay while they took pity on him and grabbed an Iron Man hoodie as well.
They eventually made it back to the living room, depositing Loki in the middle of the floor. Just as they let go of the cloth, Coulson burst out of the elevator, taking a few strides towards the roof access door before he spotted the odd group of cats in the middle of the living room. He took a half step back, as confused as ever as Natasha and Clint trotted over to rub against his legs. He frowned.
“So now that Peter knows, we can keep him, right?” Tony asked. Natasha let out a half-snort and Steve sighed, as if he’d resigned himself to his fate.
Due to the power-and generator, whoops- being down, Tony had to take the dozens of flights of stairs down to their ‘bunker’. For caution’s sake (and Bruce’s sanity), he’d had a Hulk chamber put in eight stories deep below the building. It was made of concrete, the walls ten feet thick, supplemented with layers of steel and the thickest rebar Tony could get his hands on. It couldn’t necessarily contain the Hulk forever, but it was the best they could do given the circumstances. Even Fury’s glass Hulk room would likely have been insufficient.
“Captain Rogers brought down a plate of fruits, presumably for you to eat as breakfast. Dummy used a banana and the strawberries in addition to the normal protein mix.” JARVIS said. Tony looked over to the door and saw a plate with bananas and some blueberries perched on a nearby table. He used his chair to roll over to it, popping a few berries into his mouth.
“It appears the fighting is heading south, closer to the heart of Queens. It started with an explosion about a half hour ago, and has continued to-” Tony tuned her out as he watched the destruction, now from the angle of a helicopter. It was a swarming mass of glinting metal, like some kind of giant snake made of millions of small, interconnected moving parts. His anxiety lessened a little when he spotted a blue-and-red form trying to wrangle it, spinning webs and keeping it from smashing into too many residences.
Three hours later and Tony was planted on the couch, bark-yelling at Linda, because that shade of red did
“You can’t have people food, Stark. The kibble is good for you.” Steve wasn’t backing down, and Tony felt a surge of fury, snarling as he turned and kicked the bowl across the room, scattering the dog food all over the kitchen. Clint stood up and started to bitch him out, while Natasha came around the table to pick him up and haul him kicking and barking away from the mess.
“Fury is stopping by later today.” Natasha announced, the thumb of one hand tapping at her phone while she ate a cheese danish with the other. “He says he has a debriefing for us, but I can’t say I know why he wanted to come here instead of us going to the Helicarrier.” Clint groaned from where his head was buried in his arms, and Bruce gave him a sympathetic pat on the back. Non-urgent briefings always meant that Fury had a stealth op for someone- usually the spy twins and occasionally Steve. Tony and Bruce were always exempt since they relied on brute force more than stealth.
Tony off the couch. “Stay off the furniture, you’ll get dog hair everywhere. And you’re going to make yourself hoarse, so keep it down.” With that he turned and vanished into the hallway again, leaving Tony to glare daggers at his retreating back.
“You’re just a softie, aren’t you? All bark, no bite. Well, okay, maybe a bit of both. It’s gonna take awhile for the scabs on my arms to heal up.” Night had fallen while Tony was asleep, and Peter eventually deposited him on the bed before leaving his room. What the hell? He was enjoying those ear scratches! Tony laid there in annoyance until he heard the faucet running, and the sounds of Peter brushing his teeth carried down the hall. Tony suddenly came back to himself and shook his head. What was he doing? he needed to contact the rest of his team to come get him!
“As a human I could read lips fine. Now all I’ve got is meowing. Perfect.” He curled up into the classic cat-loaf position and stared past Steve at the sky he could probably barely see. “Why am I so nearsighted, too? Being deaf again is bad enough.” Steve blinked in understanding, and mentally combed through Clint’s files. It hadn’t said anywhere that he was deaf, but if he had implants, maybe it hadn’t seemed relevant to S.H.I.E.L.D? Either way, they would need to figure out how to communicate to him without his sense of hearing.
Bruce walked back in and settled himself on the floor next to Tony, busying himself with wrapping the ankle. Steve and Natasha eventually wandered off and the two of them were left alone in a companionable silence. Tony licked Bruce right on the cheek as thanks, and he chuckled, wiping the slobber off on his shoulder.
The ticking noise was louder now, maybe a few rooms down the hall. Just as he darted back into the corridor, the ground shook hard enough to cause dust to fall from the ACT ceiling above his head.
“Good to hear.” Steve came in next, sparing a second to pull off his gloves before he crouched down to hug Tony around the neck. Tony felt better seeing their Captain’s composure back. Thor came next, and took his turn giving Tony a hearty pat on the shoulder.
have something.” Clint asked, frowning. Steve opened his mouth to answer just as Bruce flopped down into one of the seats between them.
By that point it had been nearly three days of moping around and pretending that he wasn’t eating garbage, and it was getting old. Fast. Tony had already choked on a chicken femur and he wasn’t about to be killed by dead poultry. He needed to do something about the situation; he needed to take a stand.
It was always hard to admit that he couldn’t do something; the most frustrating things to Tony were the things he could have done better, the times he could have gone faster, and the schemes he didn’t figure out until it was too late. Tony’s biggest regret was not being able to do more.
“We don’t know where he is, but he was definitely thrown off the roof, at least. All we can hope is that the armor protected him enough that he isn’t terribly injured.” Steve meowed. They all exchanged glances before Bruce looked back to the center of the roof. They followed his gaze to the unconscious god.
“What makes you think I’m going to tell you anything?” Loki hissed, leaving his back to them and hunching in on himself. Shield had fabricated a miniature version of the Hulk-Buster about the size of a dog kennel, and gave one to each of their ‘guests’. Neither were pleased.
The hands let him go and Tony made his escape, vaulting out of the water, feet sliding on the floor until he found traction and then he was gone- running as fast and hard as his legs would carry him.
“It actually happened an hour or so ago. Before our meeting with Fury I was making lunch, and Tony got so excited he knocked me right over while I was dicing tomatoes. I felt horrible about it, but luckily we have a resident doctor who patched him up. None of us are vets, though, so we really appreciate you coming up to give him a physical. I know it must have been out of the way.” Steve lied right through his teeth, though somebody who hadn’t been there would have no idea. Tony’s jaw nearly dropped open; it was well known amongst the Avengers that Steve had the worst poker face out of them all.
So he was suited up, escorted to the carrier via quinjet, and debriefed at headquarters before he was off to a little commune in France called
Hey all! This chapter is a leeeeetle bit short, because there was no better stopping point unless i wanted the chapter to be huge. So I will likely update in the next few days with the next chapter <3
Bruce and Clint were already there with the other pilot- his name was Jackson,Tony recalled- and they took off for the helicarrier as soon as Steve and Tony were aboard. Bruce stayed by Tony and checked out his eyes and nose. Tony recognized it as his anxious mother-henning so he let it happen without complaint.
“Oh, Okay. Thanks!” The kid sat down next to Tony’s head and scratched under his chin, careful not to brush any of the cuts or bandages scattered around in his fur. Clint turned away to stifle a laugh, but Tony figured the real joke was on him. The kid was alright, and Tony didn’t mind the petting one bit. He even laid his head on the kid’s knee for good measure. It only got an eye roll out of their archer, but Tony took it as a win.
“You just really want to be up there, don’t you?” He cooed, setting Tony on the bed before turning to open his closet. He felt slightly insulted by the coddling, but he was really liking the petting more than he cared to admit. Peter changed into a pair of fleece pajama pants that had little penguins all over them (Tony almost burst into laughter at the sight of them, but it hurt his throat to laugh and it just sounded like a hacking noise anyway), schootching the cat out of the way so he could clamber under the covers. “We’re getting up early tomorrow, so I suggest you go back to sleep.” Peter said, before rolling into his side and falling silent.
“This might need stitches. Clint, get me the first-aid kit from over there.” Bruce ordered, pointing at the one hanging on the wall next to the doors. Clint hurried off and Tony scowled at Bruce when he started to press harder on the gash. “Sorry, Tony. Please sit still.”
Coulson came tripping back down the stairs, confusion and unsettle written across his face as he carried their discarded uniforms. He looked over at them again, and understanding dawned on his face when he saw Mjolnir on Thor’s back.
“Stay out of the fridge, Stark. You have a bowl of food right here-” He nudged it with his foot, “- and you can’t have people food. You’ll get sick.” Steve went back into the kitchen and started to rummage around in the cupboards while Tony stood where he’d been planted and stared.
noises as she sharpened them. Tony could smell new car and an overwhelming musk of warm leather, from the car seats and the uniforms of the agents. Tony rolled down his window a crack and stuck his nose up against the cool air. It wasn’t necessarily a horrible smell, but there was so much of it that Tony was getting a headache. The wind whipping by was a nice cold relief.
.” Tony insisted. He hoped he wasn’t making things worse when Clint curled up tighter and started to cry again, but after another few minutes he calmed down again and began absent-mindedly playing with one of Tony’s ears.
“Well, I was hoping I wouldn’t see you again so soon. You must be Doctor Banner-” Hannah held out her hand and after a beat, Bruce gently shook it. “I’m Hannah. I heard about what happened, but I think a first-person account would help me know what to look for.” She said, gently removing the mask while she started checking Tony’s eyes and gums as Steve cleared his throat. Her face was set in a frown as she thumbed soot off of Tony’s nose.
It was pretty simple; there were four different readers strapped to his sides, with a small transmitter and a GoPro on his back, so the rest of them could see what was going on. He had a modified Comm unit in his ear, but none of them were really sure if it would stay in since it had been a bit jerry-rigged at the last second.
Tony was halfway through a righteous pity-party when his skin started to feel prickly. His fur stood up and he felt like he was being watched, but an inquiry to JARVIS and a scan of the room showed no signs of anyone else. Thoroughly unsettled, Tony ditched the half-assed attempt at a nap and decided to return to the commons area. At least, that was the plan.
“Hey Nat, do you think you could keep Stark occupied and send Bruce over here when they’re done?” Steve murmured. She didn’t look thrilled at the idea of babysitting, but she nodded anyways and stood gracefully from her seat.
“You want to go to Queens? Tony, I am not taking all of you over to that shitstorm. You aren’t active duty right now! You’re
“That smells awesome, what is it?” Tony asked, hopping out of the carrier and limping down the hallway to the kitchen. Steve padded behind him and his tail curled up when they turned the corner to see Pepper standing at the kitchen island. She was chatting with Peter and mixing something in a large bowl.
He wasted no time in using his teeth to pry apart the faceplate, tossing it on the table and using his paws to gently prod away wires and get a glance at the motherboard. Those were most
“You’re not going to be arrested. Or forced to tell us your identity.” Natasha confirmed, a faint smile turning up the corner of her mouth. If Tony had managed to pick up on the youth in the kid’s voice earlier, there was no doubt she had too.
“I’ve had to have those before. They suck ass.” He said, looking back to his game. Bruce was looking a titch green and Tony wondered if he’d ever had to have one before. Harley put some ice on his sprained ankle and made sure it wouldn’t slip off before he backed up and put his hands on his hips.
Tony finally found himself in the living room, so he painstakingly used the remotes to turn on the TV and he left it on HGTV when he couldn’t press the channel button. He was a secret architecture nerd anyhow so it didn’t really bother him.
Tony was currently using his nose to rifle through the contents of the fridge, and had just snagged a takeout bin containing fries when Steve shouted.
Tony had enough to focus on to keep him from panicking about the dark, and Finley checked in with him every ten minutes or so for almost two hours as SHIELD tried to dig their way down to Natasha and him.
Tony barked, turning in a circle and jumping up and down. The Avengers looked at him like he’d gone crazy, and Thor frowned a little harder.
And Peter's eyes, when Steve turned back to him, were about the size of dinner plates. He clutched reflexly to Steve's sleeve.
'Good. Need someone to put him on the straight and narrow. We have a family history of alcoholism.' He downed the glass and poured another, impervious to Steve's harsh look. 'So,' he said, wiping his mouth. 'Stuart. Let's talk about you.'
that, and even if he did, Steve didn't know how he would react. Until Barnaby, the idea of having a one and only true love, forced together by fate, had made his stomach shrivel up in horror. What if Barnaby felt like that too? Maybe he would see the blemish and run a mile. Maybe he already had. Not a single text.
'Oh!' Tony understood at last. 'Is it my turn? Thanks, baby, that's very kind, but Daddy's too big.'
The practice of Charity Marriage was very common for several centuries, believed to account for around 40% of marriages in the US at its peak. Charity Marriages became a symbol of status, desirable for the aspiring middle classes, who would sometimes arrange marriages with people only slightly less well off than themselves. The practice began to decline soon after the end of the
'Alright, I get it,' Stark said, tapping something into his phone and then setting it back down on the table. 'You know, I don't normally let my dates talk about their kids this much. Or at all. Or have kids in the first place.'
. His mother. His father. Even Tony, in his own life, had been in a coma in a high tech coffin for months; though Steve hadn't so much felt that, being stuck in his own mind at the time.
underneath it. Even the way the rancher looked back and forth between them, frowning, did nothing to dent his mood as he headed back to the station. People could say what they liked as long as they never took that look off Tony's face.
'Fine,' said Tony, in a very un-Tony-ish sort of voice. He was glad for the glasses. He thought he might actually be starting to well up. And now Steve didn't even
, with a great deal of suggestion in his eyes, but Steve couldn’t think about that. Not in the workplace. Nope.
'Whatever you did back there...' Steve said, 'You saved his life. Because of you, we got him here, and at least now there's a chance. I won't ever forget that. Thank you.'
'Great, deal, problem solved!' Bucky said, enthusiastically, beaming at Steve. 'This totally counts as you selling a painting for a million bucks.'
'Drink?' He said, sitting down behind the desk and pouring himself a glass of whiskey from a decanter. Steve stepped into the office properly, shutting the door behind him. It was barely ten thirty in the morning, and he was pretty sure that wasn't the first glass the Director of Stark Industries had had.
'Not that one. Tell me why you don't let Peter call you dad.' When Steve didn't reply, Stark kept prompting. 'I mean, you've raised him since he was a baby. You're all he remembers. And you love him like a real father would. More than some real fathers would.' There was a note of bitterness in his voice. 'So why don't you let him call you dad?'
Delighted, Peter reached forward and eagerly ran his hands over the helmet, gently tracing the curves and welds in it. Steve remembered vaguely hearing some rumour about Stark being able to shoot lasers from the eyes of that thing, and thought about intervening, but there was nothing threatening about Stark now. It was almost like watching a completely different person to the drunken mercenary he had met in the bar.
For once, the fight wasn't so much as fight as it was crowd control. The WW2 bomber, complete with confused Japanese fighter pilot, had been quickly followed by the horse and cart of a terrified milk man from the 20s, and then by an entire building that according to Steve had been a law firm at the turn of the 20
And now without any further blather, please enjoy the chapter. I consider this the 'half way point' and I finally get to (more or less) do my big reveal!! I've been waiting for this, haha XD  Next time will be Tony's backstory. Enjoy!
Peter's second birthday had been almost identical to the first. He had been in hospital, this time for the last of a string of planned operations to help open up his lungs and windpipe. That was the first day he had ever breathed completely unaided, but, again, he had mostly slept the day away, oblivious to Steve's fretting.
Either Shield had somehow known Stark was going to turn up the day following Agent Romanov’s visit, Stark knew Steve had been warned off and had decided to come, or it was a complete coincidence. Either way, Steve wasn’t too happy when he opened the door to find Stark there.
An hour after that and Tony ran into Steve in the kitchen. The access to his lab had been turned off and the whole downstairs was dark, so Tony had taken to wandering frustrated throughout the mansion. It was strangely and uncomfortably reminiscent of his childhood before he had been sent to boarding school.
“Not enough time. I’m sending you her last recorded coordinates.” Steve said, and a red dot blinked onto the map they had pulled up. She was in an apartment building- third floor.
Tony wasn’t sure how much time had passed before there was a small commotion in the foyer. Someone had come to visit, and the team was gathered to talk with them. Tony didn’t even bother lifting his head until he heard the distinctive clack of heels entering the kitchen. He smelled Pepper, and his heart lifted. She could always make him feel better.
Tony made a decision and leapt out of one of the shattered windows, making a break for the yard’s fence. Half of it was destroyed so he easily shot off of the property into the streets.
“How long was he exposed to smoke?” She asked, pulling out a few q-tips from her coat and swabbing the inside of Tony’s cheeks. Steve rubbed his chin and glanced over at Bruce.
“Barton? Why are-” Tony didn’t get much further because Clint dropped the cookie pan he was holding with a deafening clang, and his body dropped out of sight behind the island. Tony sat in silence for a few beats before he stood up and debated on his next move.
He slumped and went back to his designated bed, curling up to wallow in self-pity for as long as he liked. He didn’t have anything else to do, anyways. JARVIS was down. His workshop was closed. He couldn’t even go outside.
“I have missed Tony’s chatter. Have you not?” Thor seemed genuinely confused, and the others chuckled.
Steve stilled immediately, and they looked each other in the eye for a beat. Tony broke the contact and gestured for them to follow.
, and it went flying across the room, sand spilling everywhere. Natasha and Clint stopped to gape at him, and Bruce finally looked up from his tablet with his eyebrows raised. “If we can’t trust him, he could be a liability in the field.” Steve finished, starting to unwrap his bloodied knuckles.
“Okay, let’s calm down for a minute-” Tony began, but Peter started to pet his head and whatever he was going to say dissolved into a happy purr.
“Coyote, god dammit, report. We’re sending an agent in if you don’t respond in the next minute.” Rumlow said, and Tony winced.
Tony sat back on his haunches and looked at the screen, shrugging a bit. He really only needed to have JARVIS scan him a few times and they were good to go.
Tony barked, crawling underneath burning wood and plaster to her head and licking the soot off her face. It tasted disgusting but it was worth it when she stirred, coughing weakly as she blinked up at him.
“I can not say. Would you like to write something else for us?” Thor asked, and Tony nodded so hard he thought his neck was going to break
“Sorry, sir, I didn’t mean to interrupt you, but Miss Potts has me cornered in the elevator, I need an immediate extraction, she is
Tony felt nausea and panic rise up in his chest and he heaved in a breath, noting how much easier it was to breathe without so much weight in his chest. Wait-
. Suit up and meet here in two.” Steve barked, abandoning the art supplies and striding off towards the bedrooms. Natasha and Clint were the only other two that needed to change, so Bruce and Thor turned their attention to Tony.
“I forgot how much he used to talk. Never ending…” Clint went back to his card game with Natasha, who was offering Tony a soft smile. Steve snorted and shot Clint an exasperated look.
“What the fuck?” Tony looked down at himself, and made a sound akin to a cat coughing on a hairball. Hell, maybe he was, considering the four furry limbs and new tail he was sporting. At least the arc reactor was still intact. Tony tried again, and wobbled over to his helmet, feeling weird using his hands- paws, to walk. God, he really hated his armor in green. He stuck his head and front paws in, unable to squeeze much more of himself into the small cavity. “JARVIS? Hello? Power on.” He commanded, before he realized he was meowing. No wonder JARVIS wasn’t responding. That, or the fact that the suit was in pieces, and out of power; very much a contributing factor.
as the workshop doors slid open. Tony was grease-stained in an old black wife beater with holey jeans, wearing a protective mask and gloves in preparation to solder, but Steve still gave him a small smile instead of the Disapproving Frown like he usually did. He was also carrying a small plate, which when Tony took a closer look, seemed to have several sandwiches on it. Steve navigated his way to Tony’s seat and held out the plate.
“God, Tony, I’m so sorry. I wish you could tell me what’s wrong...” She settled on the most comfortable couch and he curled up with his head in her lap, dozing on and off to the stroking of her fingers across his fur. “If I had the time, I would take you back home to Malibu with me and let you stay there, but that just wouldn’t be fair to you. I have so much work to do…”
“Perfect. What about Spider-kid?” Steve added, eyes flicking up for a brief second toward their young charge.
Tony finally took a break longer than an hour, lounging in his bed in the kitchen to get some sleep.
Tony used the claws on his right paw to slowly spell out the word ‘Tony’, looking up at Thor hopefully while the god frowned and stroked his beard.
“Fine, we can stay out a little longer. But we need to head back soon.” Tony trilled in delight, pulling Peter as hard as he could towards the tower. Once Pete held him up to cross the street, however, he picked up on a scent. It was so familiar- but Tony couldn’t quite place it. It was like a woodpecker in the back of his brain, and it wasn’t until he spotted a suit and the back of a well-known head that he could place it.
“Oh-hoh, oh my god- imagine- oh my god, what if they’d shaved your whole butt? YOU WOULDN’T HAVE ANY PANTS!” He was saved from kissing the floor by the vet, who slid him back to the middle of the exam table. Tony tried pretty hard to be angry, but he knew that those weird cat videos were Steve’s favorite and he didn’t mean any malice by it.
“Well he sure as hell acts like one.” Steve said, wiping his hands on a towel and leaning against the island.
; he’d socialized with the team around dinner-time, but elected to take an early night, after his fitful napping throughout the day hadn’t brought any relief to his anxiety. By now he was relatively relaxed, and had been sleeping rather soundly if the crust in the corners of his eyes was anything to go by.
They came up on the rear of the building and Tony noted with dismay that it was on fire, smoke pouring out of the windows on the lower half. A corner of the building was completely missing up near the fourth floor and they had to climb over the bricks to get to the door. The other agent pulled on the standard issue mask, and started patting down her pockets.
“They need to make sure the fluid doesn’t build up in your lungs again. We’ll come back early in the morning to bust you out, I promise.” Clint said, stepping back when Natasha used her crutches to stand up, hovering next to her while she waved him off. Tony huffed and made to jump off the bed, but Steve jumped forward from the doorway and put a hand on Tony’s chest to nudge him back. Tony flinched away and Steve frowned.
“Wait, Coyote? Whose code name is Coyote?” Steve said, his voice strained. Tony had no idea if they were still fighting or if they’d switched over to search and rescue.
“HEY! What’s going on?” A new voice shouted, and Tony could have cried with relief. Natasha was power-walking down the road towards them, seemingly unhindered by her air cast. “Put your weapons down,
“Coyote, are you there? Report.” She said, even though Tony couldn’t talk. He barked, though, as much as he could without upsetting the debris supported by his back. The comm seemed to pick it up because she heaved a sigh of relief that was audible even over the comms.
“Is there something else? Did you leave something? You’ve got all your equipment.” Clint started muttering to himself and he made his way back, stopping when Tony backed up an equal distance. They stared at each other for a few moments and then Tony stomped his feet impatiently, backing up further before he turned to lead Clint back to the town. Something was
Harley came back in with a second nurse in tow, both carrying machines. They set them up while Hannah gave Tony the I.V, as well as hooking up a heartbeat monitor before she wrapped his wrist and let the other nurses handle the rest. Harley got Tony an oxygen mask that had a strap on the back and carefully fit his muzzle into it. The other nurse set a machine aside and plugged it in, though she didn’t do anything else with it.
“Tony, stop, take a deep breath. Stop struggling, you’re safe, you’re in New York. Take a breath and count to three, okay?” Rhodey said, and Tony slowed down, trying to get air in past the metal sitting heavy on his lungs-
“Sure. Come back to the jet here when you’re all done, if you still want to come to the debrief.” She said. With that, she lifted Tony right off the ground, and turned to carry him back to the waiting quinjet.
“Pepper!” Tony called, immediately darting forwards to weave himself around her legs. Steve did the same, and she stumbled a bit at the force of their excitement. It was nearly dinnertime, and Tony realized Steve and him had missed dinner the previous night, having fallen asleep while Tony was coding. It smelled like cheese and Tony really hoped she was making some kind of pasta.
“Kid, I’m fine. You need to just, chill out. Do some yoga, meditate, whatever it is you need to do.” Tony meowed, unconsciously kneading his paws against the kid’s sternum. Why hadn’t he become a cat before now? The slow strokes across his fur were practically melting him into a fuzzy puddle.
It took longer than Tony would have liked, but after a minute or two of pecking the command into a computer and he was rewarded with the building falling into silence.
‘Thor! Man, am I glad to see you. You’ll never fucking guess what happened!’ Tony bounded up to him and wagged his tail, subtly blocking him from getting any further up the driveway.
“This is the Mark VIII, which sustained heavy damage during the Battle for New York. Mr. Stark decided not to perform repairs.”
Tony got up onto the couch and flopped down with a new chew toy to gnaw while he rested his aching paws. He was finally feeling tired, and he just wanted to sleep. Clint and Natasha both gave him looks, though, and Natasha gestured for him to get off. Tony was still terrified of her, but he wasn’t even doing anything! What was so horrible about laying on the couch?
‘Noooo,’ Peter whined. ‘I want to go! Please!’ He was still wheezing, and now he was starting to cry.
'How have they even read it this fast?' Steve asked, sitting back down. He couldn't think. He hadn't expected anything this soon; he thought it would take days or weeks before he got any interest, if he had any at all. Sarah had gone into the inbox section of the site and was working through the messages.
And for some reason, that desperation, that despair, made Tony feel better; because if Steve at least felt bad about it then maybe there was a chance they could fix this. He could do better, be better, be whatever Steve needed; and Tony knew he was being pathetic, he knew it, but this was
Tony hesitated, then slipped it off his finger, holding it out in the palm of his hand. 'Okay, Cap,' he said, quietly. 'But don't leave me waiting too long.'
He was too busy trying to stay upright to watch Stark's expression, but he saw the scrap of ribbon drop to the floor, skittering in the dust. He looked up, annoyed that Stark wanted to make him pick up after him, but Stark's expression was stone cold.
'Oh, that one's just spam. It must generate when a profile is added. Maybe they're all – oh, no, this one is genuine – Sixty-seven years old?! I don't care how rich you are, I won't – Oh! That's disgusting! No I will not 'rent' my son for a night, number three – or to you number four – this person wants to know your sperm count, guess they're desperate for kids? - This one is spam, this one is just a penis, this one wants to see
‘Why, because you haven’t put on the suit for a while? Come on, that doesn’t mean anything. Anyway, I think you should get it back out. I’ve seen the pictures, your ass looks great in it.’
Here, Tony was dead. Dead in a way that it would probably stick this time, not in glorious but convoluted battle, where there was some hope of a loop hole or a way back, not going out in a blaze of heroism, saving the universe. Just dying, the way everyone else died. Dying as a human.
But it had been a dreadful night. After a few moments of hope, it became clear that the pain was not subsiding. Peter was in agony, burning up at his touch, twisting around in his bed, slipping in and out of conciousness – and there had been nothing Steve could do. He'd wanted to get a doctor right away, but Stark had blocked the door.
'Steve? What's the matter?' Peter asked, trying to ignore the twisty, sick feeling in his guts that he knew had nothing to do with the forward rolls.
t-shirt had been almost an involuntary reaction. As had phoning Bucky, and saying he needed to go to a bar,
'Yeah.' Unfortunately Steve was obviously only just warming up to his subject. 'I mean, back home - ' This was always how he referred to the forties, as if he had just moved to the States from some other country. 'Back home we had these ideas about how the future would be.'
Bucky groaned, pulling a hand down over his face, his expression changing from anger to resignation. 'It's what you want?' he echoed. 'Steve, you're a damn stubborn idiot.'
At six thirty am the next day, he was in the kitchen. He hadn't slept, but it was worth it. He wanted to catch Steve as soon as possible, because this was good. Really, really good.
And then it hit Steve all over again. Peter would be discharged. He had a whole future in front of him. He would go to school, grow up, go to work, maybe get married, have his own kids, live a whole life.
They'd been there on many night outs since turning 21. It was one of the few places that openly welcomed people of all sexualities and genders, and had a truly zero tolerance policy against any kind of discrimination. Things were made easier too by a table full of a rainbow of wristbands just inside the door, with different colours to indicate whether you were looking and who you were looking for, along with black bands to indicate 'None of your business' and white ones for, according to the sign above the jar, 'Ask me like a socially well adjusted person'. That jar was always nearly full.
Still, Tony had to admit, he had listened to the recording a few too many times to justify it merely as a desire to tease Steve. He'd never heard Steve sing before, and he'd been a little surprised by the talent he had. Even through the terrible audio quality, there was a crispness to his voice, something in the timbre, that had made Tony go a little weak at the knees; even with such hammy lyrics.
laboriously written out by hand, with different coloured felt tips used for the speech of different characters, because Peter thought he was probably bored. Tony read the whole thing.
'Yeah, fine, I'll, uh, leave you to it.' And with that, Steve left without even offering to help with the clean up. Something was definitely going on.
in the future. There were hundreds of TV channels. You could go to restaurants and taste food from almost anywhere in the world practically on your doorstep. It seemed like every basic appliance and piece of furniture was customisable to exactly what you wanted. Everything came in twenty colours and shapes. There were entire shops that only sold coffee and yet still managed to have a menu full of options. If you went to Subway, you not only chose a sandwich, you had to choose how big you wanted it, and what bread you wanted it on, and what ingredients should go in the salad. The future was amazing.
After a moment, he woke up enough to realise that he had been woken by the sound of Peter crying over the baby monitor, and swung his legs out of bed. Then, across the crackle of the monitor, came another voice.
for the millionth time. Steve did not get it, at all. He'd paid some level of attention to the film the first few times, if only so he could talk to Peter about it, but these days he usually watched Peter watching instead; especially if they'd put it on because he was feeling tired or sick or unhappy, trying to see if he was comforted. Today, though, it was all he could do not to sit there staring at his watch instead. When was Stark going to come?
to say these things to a woman, a specific woman, that meant something even worse. Tony wanted to run, he wanted to head straight for the nearest bar and drink until things made sense again, but he didn't. He didn't even run out to his private jet and head somewhere far away where Steve – and the argument they were going to have to have – couldn't find him. He stayed put. To talk about it, like an adult.
'Well,' Steve said, smiling up at him, squeezing his hand tighter. 'I've got to make sure you get your money's worth.'
Of course, Steve wasn't stupid. He knew people were complex, often contradictory, and people as clever as Stark probably even more so. But still, there was something. He kept thinking of the brief flicker he had seen in Stark's eyes in the bar, and the way his flight suit had rippled and clawed up his neck and over his hands like tentacles. It had almost seemed alive.
It happened towards the end of summer after he'd graduated high school. Out of nowhere he'd gotten a message from one of the art teachers, asking if he would consider life modelling for an evening class she was teaching, as he had an 'interesting body type'. He'd meant to disagree, he couldn't think of anything more humiliating than stripping off and letting strangers draw him, but at the time he had been trying to get more out of his comfort zone. It didn't hurt that Miss Rivers was only twenty-four, and although he had never been fortunate enough to be in her class, Steve had been nursing a crush on her for months. So he had gone, and tried not to feel too weird about it, and hoped to dear goodness that Bucky never found out about it, and at the end he had gone behind a screen to get dressed as the class filed out. Miss Rivers hadn't drawn him, just supervised. The next thing he knew, she had joined him behind the screen and he stood, frozen against a wall as her fingers went everywhere and did everything, and she kept asking him if he was okay, if it was good, if he wanted it, and he kept saying yes, because he was so damn touch starved, even though he would have preferred to have been touching her, even as a hot ball of shame started to fill him.
The spiral of pleasant, panicky thoughts was stopped abruptly when Stark breezed in, looking, as usual, as if he owned the place. The discomposure that Steve had seen in him last night seemed impossible to imagine now, as he strolled in, obviously completely certain that Peter would be fine, calmly carrying a balloon in the shape of Lightning McQueen.
“It’s always so awful when we accidentally hurt our own pets. He seems alright though, and your doctor did an excellent job on this. I’ll give you some antibiotics, just to prevent infection.” Hannah left the room for a few seconds and returned with a little orange pill bottle full of tablets. “Have you had to give a dog medicine before?” She asked kindly, and Steve shook his head, looking bashful. Tony was so going to tease the shit out of him about his previously non-existent acting skills once he was human again.
“Does she need immediate medevac?” She asked, and Tony took a moment to pause. The broken leg wasn’t life or death, the scent of blood wasn’t thick or strong. They could last a while as long as Tony could hold up the debris. He gave two barks.
Any thoughts on what Tony is going to find in Benevento? It's a real place, or at least according to google. I do my best to achieve maximum accuracy (At least when it comes to geography). Comments and kudos are very appreciated!!
The internal war was over when Loki got a particularly nasty bite to the back of his neck and he caterwauled loud enough for Dum-E to wake from where he was charging.
“Clint, is it alright if I come over there?” Tony asked, his own wheezing breath loud as he listened for a response.
Tony wiggled himself free of the safety harness and whined, pawing at the locker where they had stored his kevlar vest and other gear. The pilots glanced at him and said nothing, though one of them raised the ramp so that Tony couldn’t just run off.
barely audible from her comm. Tony made a disgusted face and shot his repulsors into the mass of insects as he flew by, not staying to watch any explode. Tony wasn’t usually squeamish; he could handle blood and gore, but he drew the line at furniture-sized grasshoppers getting disemboweled in the streets. He did
“Steve, really? You’re going to lock Tony up, like a dog?” Bruce argued, and Natasha paused just out of sight of the living room.
The clicking of his nails on the floor was the only sound in the silence, and Tony stooped in a crouch before he dared to round the island.
New York wasn’t much of a corn field, but there were two answers; scare them, or lure them. And they had already done their damndest to scare them, though it only made them eat faster, and that was the opposite of what they wanted. What would interest a bunch of man-eating insects more than concrete slabs and squishy humans?
Finally, with a breath of pure relief, Tony spotted the wing of a Shield quinjet sticking out between the buildings a few streets down. There were agents rushing around it and directing people to safety. One of them turned in Tony’s direction and seemed to spot him, because the figure started to beckon urgently.
“You didn’t steal him- at least not directly. Actually, he was lost, so for finding him we should give you a reward.” Maria soothed, but Peter looked even more skeptical at that.
This chapter is a bit shorter, but after seeing all the positive feedback, I decided to post what I had written, and hopefully have a bigger chapter next week. Thank you all of the comments and kudos!!
“Tasha, his magic fried my implants. I have no idea what you just said.” Her face lit up with understanding, and she nodded, looking over at Steve while her tail gently swished back and forth. He shook his head.
“Tony, are you alright?” Clint asked, leaning over so that their eyes met. Tony gave him a nod and the nurses seemed to settle down when his heart rate went back down to an acceptable level.
“I have a bad feeling, I don’t know. It feels like something is wrong.” He hissed, tail swishing back and forth with uneasiness. Steve was sitting next to Natasha on the couch and he shrugged when she made eye contact with him. Tony pretended not to see it and instead jumped onto the coffee table, pulling the remote towards himself and painstakingly putting on the local news.
Tony decided, padding over to the sink and grabbing a washcloth in his teeth. It was hard to see by the glow of the dim hallway lights, but he managed to wipe down the small trail of dripping blood left behind. His cheek was cut the worst, his neck having already stopped bleeding. He gently turned on the tap and wetted the rag, then with some maneuvering managed to lay down in his bed with it resting on the injured side of his face.
Clint had just put the third batch of cookies in the oven when a car buzzed the front gate. Clint left to let them in and Natasha took her opportunity to sneak into the kitchen, stealing a half dozen cookies before she tip-toed out. Clint walked back in with Fury and three other agents that Tony didn’t know, and who were giving Tony some heavy side-eye.
He couldn’t say his thoughts out loud so he settled for barking as he was pushed out of the kitchen and into the living room.
“We aren’t doing anything today, why can’t we take it to a shelter and have it checked for a chip? It’ll only take half an hour-” Clint started, but Steve shot him down. Tony didn’t catch the rest of their conversation after that because the quinjet doors shut and the engines revved. It raised up vertically until it was clear of the surrounding buildings, and with a roaring of propellers started off towards the mansion.
“Oh, cool. Hopefully everything turns out okay with that. So uh, your dog? His name is Tones? Can I pet him, or is he like genetically enhanced as a military weapon or something? ‘Cause he can do some cool stuff!” Spider-kid continued, arms gesticulating more as he got himself on a roll. He didn’t even pause when the quinjet roared to life and began ascending. “He was running all over in the battle, like dodging bullets and bad guys, it was so sweet! And then I saw him use some cool moves to take down one of those robot things! Where did you get a dog like that? Will he live as long as a normal dog, or like-”
Tony made a split-second decision as the building shook, shoving himself under the charred wood and straining every muscle in his body as he tried to lift it. His back foot was screaming in pain but he was inching it up, getting the beam just high enough for Natasha to wiggle her foot out and get clear. As soon as Tony heard her shuffle backwards he slid free, jumping out before the whole weight of the rubble could trap him, too.
“Tony, focus.” Bruce said, brushing his tabby fur all over May’s leg and butting his head up in the crook of her knee. Clint joined in and they all managed to get her upright through helpful nudging and meowing. Tony grabbed the hem of her skirt in his teeth and started to walk, leading her out of the rubble and padding alongside the Avengers while they picked their way back to the Iron Man armor.
Tony bumped his head against Pepper’s legs and purred, even though he knew she wouldn’t pick him up. Pepper was allergic to cats, and it was the reason Tony had never gotten one. Maybe Steve would want a pet?
In truth, Tony was losing his cool. He’d lasted a while, but his heart was starting to race and the meager grip on his control was slipping fast.
“What happened to this one?” Peter asked, leaning closer to the glass until his nose was almost touching it.
“You’re not coming, Stark. One rookie mission for SHIELD doesn’t mean you’re ready for a combat situation. There isn’t much you can do without the suit, anyway.” He added as they touched down a block or so away from the fighting. Clint and Natasha ran off immediately, while the pilots started setting the interior up as a makeshift medbay. They were in the opposite direction from where the carnage was heading, so they were safe enough to stay put.
“Why am I not surprised?” Was the first thing Coulson said, slapping down a cell phone in front of Tony and Steve rather angrily. “Explain to me, in detail,
When Tony sat up and shook himself out, he was met with a sight for sore eyes. Thor was looking at him in amusement as he lowered his hammer and scanned his biometrics to get in the gate.
Steve’s hand made an aborted move forward, like he wanted to touch Tony, but he wasn’t sure if it was a good idea. Tony resented the fact that they might start treating him like he was glass. He moved sideways a bit to bump his back against Steve’s hand, letting him smooth the fur down Tony’s spine. Petting never got old and Tony sighed, lowering himself down on the pile of towels and letting his muscles relax while Steve scratched behind his ears.
“I let the rest of the team come with Hill and I when we were looking for Tony, because being equipped and having supervision are perfectly acceptable safeguards for leaving the tower under a normal circumstance which involves minimal danger. This situation is much different. You disobeyed a direct order, for starters. Then you left with barely any equipment. And no- the suit hardly counts at all, you’re unable to use it. Forget the supervision part entirely. You came completely alone! Nobody knew where you were, and nobody would have known until too late if something happened.” Coulson seemed to run out of steam at that point, because he set Tony back down and scrubbed his hands over his face. His whole body deflated a bit and he sighed.
Tony was lying down underneath the coffee table when the pizza arrived, and the whole team (Thor included) piled into the living room, Natasha snagging the remote and turning the T.V. to ‘Say Yes to the Dress’.
“Alright, continue.” Tony got up and did a quick perimeter check, stopping when he noticed a muted blue light coming from one of the upper windows. Nobody commented on it over the comms so he went back to the main entrance and decided his point of entry.
“I think it’s broken.” He moaned from across the jet, and Steve exchanged a perplexed expression with Clint and Natasha. Stark had never complained about his injuries before- especially not about the serious ones. Steve had heard him whine about a paper cut at Bruce until the man’s eyes turned green, but never before had he actually consented to a real medical exam like this without being threatened first.
Hey guys. I'm sorry to say that my grandmother passed away on Wednesday; It's been hard to make myself write, and I don't have enough to post much of a chapter. I will most definitely be back next week, but I hope you understand me missing this update. Love y'all, and I'll see you next Friday/Saturday <3 <3 <3
Tony pressed the button for the garage, and the others kept pace with him as he strode towards Mark XV, the front opening as if JARVIS knew exactly that they were trying to do.
He made his way through New York using mostly alleys, getting creative whenever he hit a roadblock. It got easier as he went and it was maybe an hour later when Tony turned onto the street where the mansion was waiting. He picked up speed and reached the driveway in a full sprint, clearing the security gate with a hop onto the trash can and over.
“O-okay!” The spider-kid called, and when Tony craned his head around Natasha’s shoulder, he was swinging back into the fray.
“Okay! Well, we can confirm that he’s… a little enhanced. But nothing crazy. He’s mostly just specially trained.” Clint cut in, a smirk curling his lips. “And you can definitely pet him. He doesn’t bite.”
It’s… unideal. The new wave of robots are eerily akin to the Iron Man suits, but their propulsion was shaky and their power source was likely lithium-based; creating a volatile situation. They wouldn’t be able to withstand a direct impact or high heat of any kind without exploding.
“Well then we’d better go deal with the guy in the basement.” Steve said, just as Natasha and Clint came jogging in from the other room. Thor had wandered into the living room while Bruce and Tony wrote out the codes, but he came back in after the spies and gave a solemn nod.
The content atmosphere didn’t last long, because- surprise, surprise- Tony got bored. Quick. The whole day he pestered the others, whining and constantly rolling over trying to make himself comfortable, which irritated them because -
“Nyet. I am fine, thank you.” Natasha cut off agent jackson, passing by the team and picking her way to the aircraft. “We had quite a scare, Bruce and I, when the battle moved onto the mansion. We tried patching into the mansion comms, but the power grid has been knocked down and the generators aren’t working. You did a good job getting away.” Natasha said to him, and Tony’s tail wagged ever so slightly. He’d grown closer with Natasha after the battle in Queens that took them both out of commission, and getting her approval on his choices gave him a small surge of pride.
“Okay! So, Jarvis should be back soon, and he’ll be a big help in sorting out the robot attack. But for now-” Steve paused when the lights flickered back to life, sparing a look towards Tony, who had his tongue out and tail wagging. Steve winked back. “For now, we need to put together everything we already know for Fury- and Shield- to look at. Ah, perfect timing guys-” He said, the others turning to see Bruce and Clint entering the room with several party-platters worth of sandwiches. Fury, Hill, and Agent Jackson filed in behind, all with bemused expressions.
“This morning. He’s just tired; the guy never sleeps.” Clint was holding the whole coffee pot, and Bruce kept shooting him looks as he drank straight from it like a mug.
“Oh, let me go find something for you to write on.” Bruce vanished back into the hallway, and Steve was still searching the room when he returned.
“He’s just-” Bruce started, but Tony wasn’t having it. He threw the pillow down and stalked towards the staircase to hide out in his lab. He had a shower and a small linen closet full of spare clothes, so he didn’t see a need to stomp past Steve’s room lest he do something ‘impulsive’ and ‘reckless’ like breaking down that douchecanoe’s door and punching him right in the face.
“Okay, I have to go help. Stay out of trouble, okay puppy?” He cooed, giving Tony one last scratch under the chin before he pulled the mask back on and swung towards the thick of the fighting.
“So do you know where those things came from? I thought I was going crazy when I first saw them, they looked so much like the Iron Man suits. Except they obviously weren’t made to have a pilot inside. Plus they were made of some kind of aluminum alloy! Which is waaaay weaker than the gold titanium alloy Tony Stark uses in his suits. It’s a cheaper option though, which probably made it easier to have so many. Whoever was behind it definitely didn’t care about them being expendable. I-” Spider-man spoke, rapid-fire, but stopped when he seemed to remember himself. “Oh uh, sorry.”
“What do you mean, ‘compromised’?” Fury didn’t sound like he was in the mood, and Phil’s eye gave a tiny twitch.
“Alright, Tony?” Bruce asked, putting down his towel to instead rub his fingers underneath Tony’s chin. He was still shaking despite the warm air and semi-dry fur.
“JARVIS, comms-” Tony spluttered, clawing at the grasshopper’s legs and trying to wiggle out from underneath it.
“I’m bored out of my skull.” Clint whined, jumping up onto one of the sofas and dramatically flopping himself down in despair. Peter momentarily looked like he was going to take the collapsing cat seriously and check his health, but he relaxed a little when the other cats huffed and went back to what they were doing. Tony hadn’t come with them to the commons so he was in unfamiliar territory- literally. He’d never been there before, and he’d never truly met or gotten to know these people- well, cats- before. Bruce was happy to curl up in his lap and get a nice ear scratch but the rest? They all gave him a wide berth and seemed to prefer entertaining themselves to interacting with him. Which was fine.
'Helped?!' Steve barked. 'Listen to him! He's in pain!' And he released Tony slightly, only to slam him back, painfully, against the wall.
'I don't remember that last afternoon,' Tony said. 'I remember the rest. I will always remember the rest.'
'So,' he said once he was finished, having been completely distracted by the food. 'Was that why you shut it all down? You were making enough off the patents?'
Steve considered this. It was true that he had known a lot of loss in his life, and he didn't really want to imagine losing anyone else, he wasn't sure he could take it. Knowing Peter was sick was painful enough, and he knew there was worse to come. He had no idea how he would handle it, how he would survive it. He knew, somewhere deep in his bones, that his life - or at least a large part of it – would end the moment Peter's did. But change it? Live his life without Peter? That was unimaginable. It was no life at all.
'I'm your new deputy,' Thor said, rummaging into the pocket of his coat before producing an envelope of somewhat crumpled papers. 'I thought Mayor Danvers would tell you.'
'I'm proud of you,' Steve blurted, and Tony just had time to see his face flush with embarrassment before the door was shut between them.
'Inhaler,' he said. Asthma, then. Punishment, probably; fate making Steve even more pathetic because he dared to complain about it. He dug out his inhaler and gave himself a couple of doses, feeling his chest begin to ease almost immediately.
Steve nodded, still wide-eyed. 'Hearing him say that... that he was wrong...' He shook his head in disbelief, but a smile began to tug at his lips. 'It's thrown me for a loop. But... it's also a big relief. To know the person your closest to won't judge you.'
'This has been a complex case,' the judge said when they were all in position, 'With many people speaking passionately on your behalf. It was further confused by the Venom symbiote, which is scientifically unprecedented. Currently, although much of the jury and I myself believe it is likely you had little to no control over your actions, there is not enough legal proof to declare you innocent, and I must base my ruling on proof. However, I believe there is sufficient evidence to state that your actions were without deliberate malice, and that by submitting to the authorities before any case was made against you, you have a genuine desire to make amends.'
Tony opened his mouth to ask for details, to remind Bucky that this wasn't the cryptic crossword, but before he could Steve suddenly jerked to his feet, grabbing the now-empty glasses and muttering something about washing up before dashing to the kitchen. Tony stared after him, unsure of what was happening.
He made it all the way to the tower without anyone stopping him. He ran up the steps and tugged desperately on the door, sure his dad and Mr Stark had to be inside, but the doors were locked. Despite all his new strength, he couldn't make them budge even a little. Frustrated, he took a few steps back, craning his neck to try and see another way in. When Mr Stark had told him about the tower, he'd said he lived right at the top. Maybe he'd left a window open or something. But Peter couldn't even see the top floors, the tower was so tall. Not sure what else to do, Peter went back to the doors and wrenched as hard as he could.
every different version of myself possible, and... it was always you, Tony. I saw every single roll of the dice, and every single time it came up with you.'
'Look, it's tea or, I don't know, yoghurt-y stuff with little chewy bits in, I don't know what they're made of, but they're good and I'd like strawberry with peach chewy things. Please.'
Steve had never been a good dancer, but just then he didn't care. He would have said yes if Barnaby had invited him to go out to the nearest dumpster and lie down in it. Something about this man just drew him in completely. He downed the rest of his beer, almost spilling some in his enthusiasm, and followed Barnaby out to the dance floor.
He placed the bag of presents onto Peter's bed and watched as the young boy excitedly unzipped it and took out each of the brightly-wrapped parcels, laying them out on his bed before starting to open them. He looked at each one carefully and gratefully, even whilst eyeing up the next. They were all exciting, they were all appreciated. Steve was glad Peter didn't notice that only one of the toys was brand new, still in the packaging. The rest he had found in charity shops. He hated that he had spent less than $25 on Peter's birthday, but it had been all he could spare. Caring for Peter meant he could only work ad-hoc for Shield, and then strictly only as a consultant. He got some money from his old WW2 service pension, but by the time he'd paid rent and tax and food bills and Peter's sky-high medical insurance, it just didn't stretch very far.
Unfortunately, his face was not currently recognisable, and his bank card was presumably somewhere in Stark Tower.
Peter was trying so hard to sound strong and heroic, but the way his voice creaked at the end made Tony's heart ache for him. And then start to pound, because if this rift was capable of something like this
Sighing, Steve straightened his own shirt and necktie, putting on his hat before stepping out of the front door and onto the porch.
'It's like, super weird,' Peter said. 'I tried getting the cops to evacuate people but, you know, they were all like
That didn’t help, at all. Every drop of blood in Steve’s anaemic body seemed to be rushing to his face and neck.
Even so, he felt as if he was attracting more looks than usual on the way to work that morning, and you didn't need a lawman for a lynching. Maybe he ought to sleep in his own old room that night. Or would the change in habit just set more tongues wagging?
Tony's life started going off the rails after his ignoble exit from his first school, too. After that it was school after school, expulsion after expulsion, because what did they think was going to happen when they put a genius in what they called 'age-appropriate' classes? His life was long stretches of boredom at boarding school, where he was forced to make his own fun, and then brief spells at home with Howard yelling at him for getting thrown out again and insisting he still had a nanny because he 'couldn't be trusted'. Somehow, he survived his education. He was finally allowed to go to MIT, and thank goodness for that, because he sure as hell couldn't have survived another school. Jarvis died just before he started, but there were drinks and parties and real friends for the first time in his life, and
At the same time, he was burying his face in the pillow, trying to block out the flickering light as his wife clicked the switch on and off, on and off, gleefully crowing about how she was up first for once. In a moment, Steve was going to reach out and drag her back to bed, making her laugh and squeal.
'Now then Stone,' he said, sounding quite genial. 'You stay nice and quiet, you hear? Or we'll find out how well you dance the hangman's jig.' He dropped Stone to the floor and the three of them retreated to the far side of the office. Steve's heart was pounding, and he couldn't help but keep looking over his shoulder.
A dreadful noise erupted from behind him as he tried to focus on shaking the professor's hand and taking his degree, tried to ignore that Bucky and his mother and his damned
Steve felt his frown dig a little deeper into his face. You didn't bring moms into it. 'Yeah, she did. She's the reason I'm doing this, she's done enough for me. At first she wasn't sure about it, but it's what I want so she agreed.'
In the end, though, he didn't have to. Because he'd muted Jarvis to listen to the recording, and was just hearing it for the sixth time when Steve's voice – his real life voice, not covered by crackles from seventy years ago – said, 'Tony?'
Peter scowled at the door, blowing on his hands to try and cool them down. Mr Stark had told him Jarvis was just a computer who did what it was programmed and didn't have any personality, but Peter still didn't like him. There had to be another way in.
But he had been different, last night. Steve had seen the occasional flicker of doubt or discomfort on Stark's face once or twice in the past, but he really had seemed almost distressed by Peter. Not that it was easy for anyone to see a child suffering, but it was a little unusual in a mercenary.
Tony had a state-appointed lawyer, a capable middle-aged woman, who he met with every day. He liked her. She understood his desire not to 'get off', but to get to the truth. She also liked puzzles, and brought him a new one every day to try and keep him occupied. True, he solved most of them in less than five seconds, but it was a kind thought.
Peter was quiet as they walked up to the park. It had been a long time since they had been out anywhere but the hospital, and he lolled back in the seat, looking at the clouds. Steve tried to strike up a game of finding shapes in the clouds, but Peter wasn't really into it, and in the end, Steve let him be. Once they'd reached the playground and he'd given Peter enough time to recover from the trip, he decided, he was going to let Peter go on the swings for as long as he wanted. If there were other kids waiting for a turn, they would just have to wait. That said, the streets were quiet, everyone was at work or school. With any luck, they'd have the whole place to themselves. He should have packed sandwiches.
'It's not Christmas until tomorrow,' Steve made the token objection even as he got to his feet. He'd learnt that when it came to Tony and his needlessly elaborate gifts it was better to just go along with it and get it over with. Tony just wanted everyone to be as happy as it was in his power to make them, and didn't understand that a gift that could never be reciprocated could be overwhelming. Steve was trying to learn to be grateful.
Steve looked at him, eyes widening. Not that Tony could see his eyes behind those dark glasses, but he could hear the eye-widening in Steve's tone. 'Not still analysing the...
'Yeah? And how is that working out for you since biological weapons were banned?' Tony asked, taking hold of the papers and trying to pull them free. Osborn tightened his hold.
'Peter, you know you can't-' Steve swallowed the admonishment, suddenly realising he was about to tell a four year old he wasn't allowed to
There was a beat of silence as Stark and the Captain gazed questioningly into each other's eyes. It was terribly romantic.
'Mr... Stark...' He started, but whatever else he was trying to say was lost in the panting. Steve sat him upright again, reaching with his other hand to open the valves on the oxygen tank. There was the nasal tubes Peter had to insert to keep him breathing through the night, or there was a mask for crisis. Steve took the mask, and although Peter swatted irritatedly at him, held it over his face.
'Consider it done,' Barnaby said, standing and heading for the bar. 'Nice shirt by the way. Eat the Rich, definitely.'
Steve was sure he could almost recite it word-for-word at this point, but Peter never seemed to tire of watching it. As far as he was concerned,
Everyone knew Tony, of course. He was rich, famous, a genius. The sort of kid the school liked to brag about having, the kid whose picture was on the front of every prospectus and advertisement, even though everyone knew he was only there because he had been thrown out of so many private schools for the rich elite that his parents had run out of other options. Steve didn't think they had ever even spoken before. They didn't have any classes together – heck, he wasn't sure Stark had classes with
They probably weren't bottled. Now that he looked properly, the little bottles seemed to be the deodorants. This did not help very much.
Steve squeezed his shoulder. 'Go home, Tony,' he said, kindly. 'Clean up and get some sleep. We'll come talk through your results tomorrow.' He smiled, turned away, and Tony realised in a panic that Steve was going to leave him stranded here.
But she was beautiful. It made his heart ache again, to see her looking so much like his Tony and yet not. She had a weak chin, and he suddenly understood why his Tony always kept a beard and loved it all the more. When he got back, if he got back, he would rub that beard all over his face.
Natasha swatted him, trying to deny the way the words made her stomach swoop. 'We're already married, idiot.'
'Certainly is,' Tony confirmed, gesturing at Steve. 'You're looking at the most patriotic man in the United States. His momma didn't even expect him until September, but Sheriff Rogers here was determined to celebrate this great nation's birthday. That's why his middle name is Jefferson.'
'Nope,' Stark said, and Steve looked up to see him shaking his head frantically back and forth. 'Nope, nope, nope.'
‘You’re too scattered,’ Steve tried to explain. ‘Some flowers just don’t look good together. You should start with your favourites and then build up from there with complementary kinds.’
Cautiously, he pushed the cupboard door open, peeping out into the entrance hall. Agent Meason wasn't back yet, so it was the perfect time to go. Without wasting another second, Peter ran to the front door – he could run now - and out. There were a lot of people covered in sheets, and a few doctors looking after those who were hurt, but the agent lady had gone and taken the others with her. No-one was looking at Peter or the house, but they probably would if he started running. He would have to sneak.
is considered. The wealthy family is expected to provide proof of their income and assets, whilst the poor family is permitted to dwell more on the candidate's personal skills and attributes.
'I've tried, believe me. Nothing works, he's obsessed with you. I think it's because he likes the science behind the suit. He draws all these pictures...' Steve fumbled in his pocket, sure he had brought one. He found the piece of paper and unfolded it, so Stark could see. On it were some red and yellow shapes, mostly crude rectangles, with a smiley face. Next to them were some blue and red scribbles, loosely arranged in the shape of a person. Beneath it, a staff nurse had written 'Iron Man and his sidekick Super Peter'.
Peter was definitely getting too big for the pushchair, but it was the only way Steve was going to be able to get him out. Stark had been right about one thing; they had been cooped up in the house too long, and two days after his visit, when Peter seemed to be having a good day, Steve decided they ought to get out for some air. He loaded the tank into the bottom just in case, strapped Peter in and noticed how his knees were practically under his chin. Peter couldn't walk more than a few hundred yards without getting breathless. Steve wasn't sure how they were going to manage when he couldn't fit in the buggy any more. The hospital were unlikely to provide a wheelchair. He would just have to think of something else-
With a herculean effort of will, Steve managed to half open his eyes. His vision was blurred, mostly eye lash, and nothing more to see than an empty room.
'I really liked him,' Steve muttered, bringing up a hand to wipe his mouth. The vomit had changed to acid and empty retches, so he thought the episode was over. Maybe.
Tony didn't even look up at the sound of Peter's voice. The kid was almost seventeen now, sensible enough to keep away from anything in the lab that looked sparky or likely to explode, and patient enough to wait for Tony to finish the bit of armour he was welding before moving out of the doorway. Normally, anyway. Today, Tony could see him in his peripheral vision, shifting nervously from foot to foot. He turned off the blow torch. The plating could wait.
But then there were hands on his shoulders pulling him away, and when that didn't work arms around his torso dragging him off, and Tony knew those surprisingly-strong arms, and knew Jarvis was here already, that it was over.
Steve had hurtled through the door to Peter's room without looking around, but now he was coming back, marching purposefully towards him. Tony straightened up.
'Steve,' she said, perching on one of the breakfast stools. 'I've booked another appointment with the therapist.'
'None of that is true, Thor,' Steve said quickly. 'Except that, yes, I was born on the fourth. Not that anyone cares except Tony.'
Feeling his heart sink, Steve took the proffered papers, knowing before he even looked that they would all be perfectly in order. He hadn't appointed a Deputy since losing Bucky, and didn't plan on doing so.
That was the final straw. He didn't want to see that face. Tony wasn't going to let this happen. He got to his feet.
and brought out the dessert, some sort of fruit soufflé topped with ice cream in a flavour he could not identify.
'What about you?' Tony asked, just as Steve slowly struggled to his feet again. 'Any regrets, Clementine?'
Days passed, followed by nights in turn. Tony's pallet was nearest the locked closet. Some nights, he dreamt he could hear a voice whispering to him from behind the door. Most nights, he didn't sleep.
'They're the worst,' Steve said, turning to look back at the view. 'That and adult responsibilities.'
'I knew you'd be hot when you're angry, babe,' he said. 'Look at this manly clenched jaw.' He patted Steve's cheek, and Steve dropped him in disgust. This was useless. Well, he thought bitterly, this was hardly the sort of person he wanted anywhere near Peter anyway, even if it was the thing Peter wanted most in the world. He turned to leave.
‘Why in the hell would I want you to message my kid, telling him who knows what, behind my back and without my permission?!’
'I didn't have you down as a giggly drunk,' he said. 'I thought you'd be a morose one. Bucky always got really fatalistic whenever he'd had a few too many. We'd be debating the point of existence while I hauled him home.'
'Hey Nat,' he said, faux-casual. 'You should see this. Stark's singing about yoghurt like a knock off Mary Poppins.'
It was as if he had stepped out into a totally different world. Even though he had literally just walked there, Tony suddenly had no idea where he was. He turned, uncertain, disorientated. The road hadn't changed but for some reason, he was drawing a total blank on how to get home. Panic surged like bile up his throat, and if there had been anything at all in his stomach he might have vomited right there in the doorway of the tea shop. What was happening to him? How could he not know the way home from a place he frequented, a place he had walked to without thinking just twenty minutes before? He should have paid more attention to the route. But no, he knew the route. Didn't he? No, he didn't. He must do. But he didn't, he didn't.
'Absolutely ridiculous,' Tony repeated. 'We're three super humans, we can't be stranded by a little snow.'
But four weeks later, it happened again. She had still felt dirty from the last time, but had subsisted on the idea that she wouldn't have to go through it again. But she did, and this time was worse. She reeked of blood, with no way to get clean, and the guards called her
Forty minutes later, Steve came back. He was looking for him, calling Tony's name, but Tony couldn't reply. He still had the underwear twisted in his grip, and for a brief second he thought about tossing them back in the cupboard, out of sight and out of mind, because if he pretended not to know then they wouldn't have to talk about it and he wouldn't have to maybe lose Steve. Just the idea made him feel sick – but it was too late, Steve had found him.
'We'd better get going,' Thelma, the mother – Wanda's daughter? Pietro's? - said, and scooped the child up. 'See you soon, Uncles.' She kissed them both on the cheek, and made her way down the steps to the street. Tony looked a little bereft. He would have liked to have had children, Steve thought. He wondered if Tony regretted it.
This may not be quite the ending you wanted, but I hope you will all enjoy it. Thanks for reading :D
He headed upstairs into the lounge, and nearly collided with a older-middle-aged man who appeared to be mopping the hard wood flooring near the door. Tony yelped and jumped back, straight into another wave of dizziness, and had to hold onto the handrail to stop himself tumbling back down the stairs. The man yelled too, grabbing his chest in shock.
Just then, Peter fell back flat onto his back on the bed. Steve looked at him, saw how quickly his chest was rising and falling, and ripped the helmet off him. Peter was beaming beneath it, wheezing, but eyes bright with excitement.
Steve couldn't help it. He didn't even think. It was just that the next thing he knew, he was on his feet, his fists curled into the collar of Stark's shirt, the table overturned between them. Steve had no memory of how he had got from the one situation to the other, but found he wasn't displeased about it. He slammed Stark back against the wall.
After the fence, there were guard dogs with two handlers. Stark had laughed at how 'old school' it was, talked at length about his own, high-tech security, and they had batted the dogs aside. One of the handlers went down almost immediately but the other ran, and Steve managed to stop her just before she called the house to warn them. They'd reached the front door.
