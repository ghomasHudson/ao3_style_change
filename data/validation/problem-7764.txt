“I know, son,” Steve whispers, pressing a kiss to his curls. “I do, too.”
As Tony took his last breaths, he has turned to Steve with a cheeky smile. “Did we do it, then?” he rasped out.
“Yes,” Steve replies.
He made peace with the fact, too. He was used to not getting what he wants, of living without love.
The giveaway was the look in his eyes. When Peter had first bounced up to him and launched into his story, Mr Stark looked like he had seen a ghost. His eyes were wide, bright with what looked like tears and Peter was confused because
“Hey, Pete,” a voice says, and
“Yeah,” Steve says. “I just wanted to talk to you before I go.”
“His name is James Buchanan Barnes,” Steve says suddenly. Five pairs of eyes shot towards him. “He was, is, my best friend. He got fell off a train not long before I went down with the Valkyrie. I, well I thought he was dead, until I came across the Winter Soldier.”
Rogers turns to look at him. “That day… it was you I fought wasn’t it?”
So, when Steve turns away from the lake in which they had just sent Tony Stark’s heart off to, he was prepared to turn away from this place and never look back.
“He doesn’t love me,” Peter says again, looking straight ahead at the lake, “because if he did, he would be here. He wouldn’t leave me.”
“Steve thinks I’m ridiculous for recording this, but I know he will go back someday. I’m going to kick the bucket eventually, aren’t I?” Peter winces, and Tony does too.
When Steve holds his waist. The music carries on, but Steve looks only into Tony’s eyes and thinks:
After waking up, and even after the Battle of New York, Steve was nothing but a ghost of the past roaming the world aimlessly. He was seeing things, but not believing, not truly taking it in. He had to survive, because that is what he does – but that is all he was doing. Surviving. Living? That wasn’t something he ever thought to do.
It feels like a sign from the universe.
He presses on though, because he has to.
) held her head high even as tears had fallen freely down her face. He had stayed over that first night, everyone holding vigil outside the room where his body was being kept, and he had heard her sobs, a sound he wishes he could forget.
Steve smiles, his eyes going glassy with memories of a cherished life – of brown eyes with golden flecks and brown curls and a knowing smile.

Tony tilts his head slightly, pressing a soft kiss to Steve’s hand.
They go to a little diner two blocks from the Tower.
, Pepper) has him quarantined with a large stack of files he must read and sign. Tony looks up gratefully, smiles at him with such intensity that Steve almost blinded by it. He is holding cheap card paper in his hands, the artistic splashes of colour visible from where Steve is standing. He walks over to Tony, leaning down to press a chaste kiss on his lips. Tony expects it too, because he tilts his head up in anticipation. It blows Steve’s mind sometimes, how well they know each other, how well they work together.
anyways!! there will be more parts to this series, hopefully soon! Steve still has a lot to work through.
“Ah,” Tony says, walking into the kitchen and pressing a tender kiss on Steve’s cheeks. “I see you have met our resident doppelgangers.”
Tony blushes under his gaze, his olive skin tinted with a dab of red that makes him look so adorable. Something about the way Tony is looking at him makes him look away, his eyes bouncing across the room until they land on a jukebox tucked in the corner. He smiles, standing up suddenly to walk over to the jukebox. He can feel Tony’s puzzled gaze following his movements, but he ignores it, choosing to instead slide a coin in and press the 3
"I owe Fury 20 more bucks."
Of course, it would be Peggy. That’s okay, he is going to see her again, soon, anyway.
“Stark,” Steve corrects.
“Yes.”
On the day Tony had passed, Steve woke up in the morning and just knew. Tony did too, because he had kissed Steve’s forehead and whispered: “it’s okay.”
the voice comes and oh god, Steve knows that voice. Knows it so well, because he has been hearing it in his head every day for five years.
He hands Peter a small box.
he whispers, and everything slots into place.
“Sorry, I suppose it is a bit too early for me to be making that joke at you, huh?”
Peter wishes he could say he was surprised when he sees Captain Rogers – 50 years older in the span of 5 seconds.
Tony leaves without a word.
“I don’t want to, sweetheart,” he says, “but there are people waiting for me over there, people who need me. People you told me to look after.” His eyes dart to the paper that is lying forgotten next to Tony, the small
He takes a deep breath, because this is it.
To be honest, though, the news didn’t shock him as much as he would expect it to. After…
“We’ll find him, Steve, and we’ll bring him back. I promise.”
He doesn’t wait for Tony’s answer.
They stare at the New York skyline for a while, both lost in their own thoughts.
Steve remembers thinking.
Afterwards, after he had let Peter rest his head on Steve’s shoulders and let himself finally cry, finally let out the pain he was feeling of losing another father, after he had tucked Morgan into bed and Morgan had whispered a quiet “I love you, 2000, because I only love Daddy 3000 but you’re close too,” – after all that, he had finally let himself settle on the couch in Tony’s workshop, cradling an Iron Man helmet to his chest. He had pressed a kiss to the top of the helmet, whispering one thing over and over again.
And yet, somehow, in all this mess, he had managed to find a family.
“It isn’t,” Steve says. “it’s about the past.”
He still looks like Tony, in a ratty MIT hoodie and his curls in an undignified mess. There’s a dark streak on his cheek of something Peter is sure of motor oil, and it’s such a Tony thing that Peter laughs, even as he feels his eyes well up with tears.
Tony’s face tilts up, and Steve’s lips meet him half-way.
Tony holds the picture up, a drawing of all the Avengers standing together holding hands. Steve laughs, the picture warming his heart. He surveys the picture, nodding impressively at how well drawn it is, especially considering the kid can’t be more than eight or nine years old. As he is surveying, though, his eyes land on the signature at the bottom of the page.
Steve needs to tell Tony.
Tony keeps an eye on Peter pretty much right after Steve tells him about Peter, but doesn't engage until the spider-bite.
Tony lets out a quiet breath.
In those 22 days it took for Tony to come back, all Steve wished for was to see Tony, alive. Steve promised to every deity in the universe that he would want for nothing else, so long as he gets to see Tony again. He wouldn’t ache for the past; he wouldn’t wish for a second chance. He would take Tony as he finds him – accept the hatred and the bitter words as long as Tony is alive.
Steve couldn’t stop the first sob that erupted out of him –
Tony grins, a grin that etches across his face, and Steve knows it is reflected on his face, too.
You said, ‘We’ll do that together too.’ And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren’t there.
But he can be here, this time around. He can stop it, stop all of it. He can save Tony.
“Why didn’t you ask me about it?”
Steve nods. He knows what is coming next.
Steve didn’t need to ask him what he meant.
“No,” he agrees, “No, I am not.”
Not the kind of alive he was back in 2012, and definitely not how he was in 2023, seconds before he died. No, this Tony is young, he isn’t carrying the burden of the world on his shoulders anymore. He looks more relaxed, his eyes having a twinkle he very seldom saw in him, in all the years they had known each other. This Tony looked happy, in the truest meaning of the world.
Steve was still frowning, but it seemed that Natasha’s words had helped immensely compared to Tony’s own efforts—which was rather disheartening, on Tony’s end. “Only because you think it would be better, Natasha.” He turned to Tony, who had begun to play around with one of the smaller Iron Man suit joints that he’d been attempting to fix. He pocketed it discreetly when he felt Steve’s gaze. “How much will it be?”
Clint then went into the kitchen to get a drink, and Tony took his place on the floor.
The elevator dinged, and they walked into the elevator, still holding hands.
Tony ignored her and tilted his head at the archer. "So, Legolas what exactly is at stake here?"
"Great. You start now."
Tony rolled his eyes, and quickly put his phone in his lap. He turned the sound down, and texted Spangles back.
Clint thought about it for a minute before responding. "If I win, you make me a new bow, and give me five hundred bucks. If you win, I'll do your bidding for two months," he said with a grin.
Steve's face burned a bright shade of red. "Oh my god, Tony."
After about a minute of thinking, he smirked at the archer."Okay, Legolas. You've got yourself a deal."
Most bets didn't turn out so well.
"What? You can have sex without talking," he reasoned. "Actually, there was this one time…"
Clint was the one who started it all. He set his bow down, and looked at Tony.
The female assassin had been quiet for most of the conversation, but she suddenly spoke up. "What if there's a mission?"
Clint interrupted him by pretending to vomit. "Nobody wants to hear about your sex ventures, Stark."
Tony grinned. "Barton, I don't know what you're talking about. Cap and I would never do those kinds of things on a mission." He turned towards his boyfriend. "Right, Steve?"
Lost in his thoughts, he barely registered his phone dinged again.
Tony sipped his coffee, and watched as Pepper tried to mediate an argument between two old business-men (God knows what their names were). His phone dinged, and he looked down at it to see a text message.
“Mr Stark, you would not believe what’s happening!” he had rambled, jumping in front of Mr Stark and gesticulating animatedly. In hindsight, perhaps he should have been a bit wearier of how utterly quiet Mr Stark was, how passive and old he looked.
Five seconds, he remembers Steve thinking. Five seconds for them, but for Steve it will be however long he needs.
“Corporate files are boring, that’s what Pepper is for!” Tony says. “I was just looking through some fan mail I got. This kid drew a really nice picture of us and wrote a really nice letter. He seems to be a bit of a genius.”
“What the fuck,” Nat says again. Steve thinks distantly that this is the only time in all these years Steve has seen Nat look so shocked.
Thor was going with the Guardians, exploring space with a freedom he was never afforded the luxury of.
The device inside looks almost like a remote in the shape of a Spiderman mask. Peter looks at him confused.
And Steve was happy, he really was. He found people to love in the form of his rag-tag group of superheroes, he found a purpose in the form of the Avengers, he found a home in the big ugly building in the middle of Manhattan that soon became the warm feeling of a summer day to him.
“I-“ Steve starts, but Tony’s gone.
But it was okay – it was fine because he saw Mr Stark.
Of course, it is Tony.
When Steve opens his eyes, he is back.
Tell you I set you apart
” Tony says again, and his name from Tony’s lips sounds like honey. “
“Cap,” he said. “How’re you holding up?”
Oh and I rush to the start
“Yeah,” Steve said, pressing one last kiss to his temple. “We did it, together.”
“Who said you figure it out?” Steve laughed out.
And then he died.
Past-Steve glances at Tony and Steve’s intertwined hands.
You don't know how lovely you are
He turns, because he never thought he would see him again.
“Steve, I can guess what happens in the future,” he looks up to meet Steve’s eyes. “I die, don’t I?”
“Please stay,” he whispers again, “it doesn’t have to end in the same way it did last time, in your time. Whatever it is, we can defeat it. Together.”
“And you two are… together?”
Peter slumps against Steve’s side.
Steve grins. “Good. Happy.” He looks at Peter for a moment before saying softly, “alive.”
He gets spotted by the Tony Stark of 2012, a confused “Cap?” making him turn just as he was about to go away.
“And you want to stay here in the past?”
And so, he pretends, balances several boxes of pizza on one hand and walks into Tony’s office where Pepper (his future
Rogers looks at him with a silent question in his eyes. “Why didn’t you take the opportunity, then?” he asks. “Why did you come back here?”
(and finally meet the other Avengers again!)
Tony Stark had died surrounded by his family, his son holding one hand and his husband holding the other, his lips pulled in a smile.
“Now,” Steve says. “I’m not as young as I was 10 minutes ago. Help an old man up, would you?”
“I don’t know,” Steve admits. “Nat and I – well, your Steve – were supposed to find him in DC. But I think I changed the past somehow, coming here. I don’t know where he is.”
That was the problem – Steve had a family there, and he has a family here, and he doesn’t want to leave either.
Tony looks sad as he answers: “I know. I wish I wasn’t, I wish I could have stayed with you, with all of you – but I can’t. So you’ll have to do it for me. Promise me you’ll do it for me.”
Steve thinks, because he knows all of Tony’s ticks now.
“No,” Peter says bitterly. “No, he doesn’t.”
He knows that, deep down. He has hidden things from Tony before, and he has spent every day of the last seven years regretting that decision. The thing is, Tony and he were friends – not close, not in the way Steve had hoped, but they were friends. Steve didn’t really know why he kept pulling away from Tony. The eccentric billionaire had certainly tried to leave their rocky start in the past, offer a fresh start where they were both the friends they could have been, the friends they wanted to be. Steve never extended the same courtesy towards Tony, though. He always thought it was the guilt that prevented him from getting close, the fact that he was hiding such a big truth from Tony. He didn’t feel he deserved Tony’s trust or friendship or respect – still doesn’t, in fact – but it wasn’t until he was in the Quinjet, minutes or maybe hours after leaving Tony in the cold snow of Siberia that he realised why he needed to keep that distance from Tony so desperately.
“Pym particles,” Scott replies. “So that you can go back.”
"Is that what made you finally tell me? he asks. "This... this kid?"
Steve smiles at him and thinks:
And so, Steve tells her everything.
Tony will tell him later that he had no plans of doing it that day – he was going to wait until their anniversary, in front of the Louvre during a romantic trip to Paris. But they were at a gala, one of the many Stark Industries ones Tony always managed to guilt Steve into attending, and a song had started playing.
Morgan – oh god, Morgan. Tony’s little girl, his little girl who looks so much like him. When Peter had first seen her, had heard Happy quietly whisper her name next to him, he almost gave up right there. Morgan Stark – who had gone to bed one night with promises of seeing her dad again and had woken up the next morning in a world without him. Morgan Stark – wonderful and perfect, who would never get to see her father again.
I had to find you
Tony stares at him for a long moment.
But then he found his family.
“Well, if you’re from the future clearly I figured out time travel, and time is fragile, Cap. I assumed you can’t answer any questions I ask anyway.”
He had woken up in a world he didn’t belong in, alone, with no one to call his own, with no place to call home.
Tony presses his forehead against Steve’s. For a minute, they just sit there, breathing in each other’s scent. Steve runs his hand over Tony’s face, tries to memorise every contour, how every breath he takes sounds.
“We’ll do it together.”
But that day on the Quinjet, he saw Tony’s face without the cloud he had covered his eyes with, the cloud that made everything seem grey. He saw the way Tony’s erupted with colour, the way he vibrated with the energy that had long since dissipated out of Steve. For about two seconds, the realisation had filled his heart with a joy he had almost forgotten the feeling of.
Tell you I need you
Honestly, Peter had not completely believed this whole ‘it’s been five years and now the world needs us’ thing Dr Strange had told them – not until he had seen Mr Stark again. The grey stuff in his hair (
They both nod.
He finds himself in front of Tony’s lab, sees him through the glass doors and almost collapses right there and then.
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
He was in love with a brilliant man who shone red – red as the anger reflected on his face when he found out he had been betrayed by the person he called friend.
Steve looks surprised by Peter’s words, his eyes almost clouded with anger. “Why would you say that?” he asks, his voice deceptively calm.
Steve places a hand on his shoulder. “Yeah,” he says. “He’s alive. You’ll be given a mission in DC soon. You’ll find him then.”
But then Steve lost that family, lost his home, lost Tony.
His face – or lack thereof – forms into what Steve would think of as an eerie smile.
“I’ll be Stark, soon,” Steve replies. “Better get used to it.”
“You… you know?”
“Steve,” he whispers into the dark. “Steve.”
He was in love with a brilliant man who shone gold – the gold he had scratched and tainted as he had fought him mere hours ago, each punch leaving a scar Steve knew could never be undone.
They both stay silent for a minute.
Steve looks into his eyes. He stands up and moves forward until he is standing right in front of Tony. Kneeling down, he cups his face. “I needed to see you,” he whispers.
“You weren’t there!” Tony had said.
“Do I have something on my face?” he asks with a laugh; a laugh Steve knows is fake and forced.
Tony smacks Clint across the head, “you know why, bird-brain.”
Come back and haunt me
Steve laughs, taking Tony’s hands in his own and leading them to the dance floor. They both hold onto each other, swaying to the slow rhythm of the music, Tony leaning his head on Steve’s shoulder.
He shook his head. “I’ve only gone through major events and changes to legislation so far.” And the document that contained public knowledge of and response to his identity as Captain America, but he didn’t feel that was necessary to mention.
When Steve glanced at Natasha, she was shaking her head with a smile that seemed to soften around the edges when she turned to face the man. It made him even more confused, but he merely watched as she marched up to him and waved her hand right in front of his face.
The following fifteen minutes was filled with Tony going through all the possible advantages of possessing a StarkPhone, paying extra attention to areas where his product drastically outranked Apple’s (which, if you asked him, was pretty much everything). He glanced up at Steve a few times in between, only to find him watching the demonstrations with nothing short of pure awe, even though his eyebrows were often scrunched up in confusion.
A hospital room. (Did that mean they’d hauled him out of the ocean after all?)
If Tony had to describe his day—or rather, his last sixty-eight hours, because that was how long he’d been awake, according to JARVIS—in a single phrase, it would be
A helpful voice in his head reminded him that it wasn’t so late yet and most coffee shops were likely still open, though their products rarely satisfied his tastes. Well, with the exception of that one place down East 45th and a select couple others on opposite sides of the city. But Tony did not have the energy or patience to head anywhere further than his own (figurative) front lawn, so that left only one of those options available.
“Natasha!” Tony and the barista exclaimed in unison.
—even if he’d instinctively reacted the way he had, ever stubborn and proud.
“JARVIS, find everything you can on Steve Rogers.” Tony would have done the hacking himself—a perfect opportunity to see what the latest S.H.I.E.L.D. files had to say about him—but sleep seemed like a much better idea. “Wake me up in four hours,” he instructed with a yawn.
Naturally, Tony’s first reaction was something like this: “What the fuck.”
Natasha motioned for Steve to come forward. “Steve, this is Agent Clint Barton, the manchild who happens to know the manager of this shop. He arranged for the three of us to work here part-time while you become accustomed to your new life.”
, how could he be using an Apple product when Tony Stark was a customer of his workplace?
Steve whirled around at the sound of Fury’s voice, his posture straightening instinctively. “As much as expected. Sir,” he added at Fury’s expectant quietness.
“Got it in one,” Clint answered, which Steve took to mean ‘yes.’ “Can’t really hear well without them—which, I mean, is what they’re there for after all. I had the volume turned down when you guys walked in, so sorry you didn’t get to experience my dramatic welcome.”
Fury took Steve to the communal dining area next, explained mealtimes and, quite considerately, the lack of necessity for rationing, then maneuvered them back to his own office. There, a redheaded woman, whose strong stance reminded Steve so much of one Peggy Carter, awaited them.
He was gorgeous.
By the time Pepper overrode his workshop lockdown, he was ready to tear out his hair, moustache,
Sorry for the super long wait (wow it's actually been almost a year since I updated this), I told myself I was going to keep writing after my exams and then I got into like a hundred new fandoms and signed away my time lol. I'm trying to get back into writing this, but I can't make any promises about updates, especially since I feel like I'm struggling a lot with characterization now that I've been away from the fandom for a while (actually I'm mostly just figuring things out as I go).
How had he survived the freezing ocean, trapped without oxygen? Even if the ice had preserved his body somehow, it should have been impossible for his brain to wake after seventy whole years.
(Why did Howard have to ruin everything?)
“Uh, I didn’t mean to offend you, I just—you look like someone I used to know so I, ah, didn’t really think before saying that and, uh— So, what can I get you?” He ended with a somewhat sheepish smile and an awkward wave towards the menu.
Tony was a man of high standards, despite what the tabloids may think, but this man—blond with blue eyes, delectable muscles, an air that practically pushed innocence and comfort in your face—Tony was astounded by him.
“Try calling me,” she prompted and Steve pressed the middle button to open the menu, scanning the screen for his contacts. After finding Natasha’s name, he selected it, then pressed the green phone image on the keypad. Natasha’s phone rang in her pocket and Steve couldn’t help but feel a tingle of excitement at his success. He held the phone up to his ear and spoke into it.
Blinking in surprise, Steve hesitantly asked, “Are they . . . hearing aids?”
Recognizing the dismissal for what it was, Steve nodded curtly in respect and exited the gym. Truthfully, he had his concerns about beginning a life in this new age. There was much he still did not understand about current social customs and culture, not to mention all the references he would miss out on if he hung out with a group of similarly aged (seventy years of sleep excluded) peers today. Perhaps returning to his status as a soldier would have been the simpler, less stressful choice.
“Made it just for you, Cap. It has little cartoon drawings and all,” he boasted.
The director looked most perplexed at the request. “Of course, Captain. They’ll be delivered to your room later today.”
Natasha had refused to reveal where they were going, so Steve merely followed silently, taking in the changes to a city he used to know like the back of his hand. He pointed out a few notable locations and signs, sometimes interesting and sometimes confusing, for Natasha to explain—people actually enjoyed shooting others in a
, but his shift was thankfully not until two in the afternoon (Natasha mentioned something about avoiding the morning rush). He arrived nearly an hour earlier, though, to watch the other employees work and see how the café operated. Clint sat across from him, pointing out seemingly random observations about the regular customers and directing Steve’s attention to examples of mannerisms or dialogue he needed to remember as a barista.
When one soulmate died, the end of the string still connected to the other would turn completely white and cut itself off, curling around the finger like a ring. But Steve’s wasn’t like that, instead remaining a cross between the regular state and that of a soulmate’s death, and Tony, ever curious, wanted to know why.
Steve still seemed a bit in shock, eyes staring down unblinkingly at the screen. It was several moments before he raised his head and, with a sheepish smile, said, “Um, thank you. For explaining all that. Really, I appreciate it, Mr. Stark—”
, Clint,” he moaned as he finished another slice of cake. Key lime with coconut, it was called. “If I didn’t know exactly how my body works, I’d hate you for making me gain ten pounds overnight.”
Steve glanced around him and, almost instinctively, replied, “Yeah. Yeah, I just . . . I had a date.”
First of all,
Steve grimaced—she was right, he knew that, but he also knew it would hurt even more if he tried to put Bucky out of his mind. Nonetheless, he appreciated her concern. “Thank you, Natasha.” He would keep her words in mind.
out-of-date, right?” Tony said as he strolled up to the counter. “Let’s ignore Apple’s promises of ‘better privacy’ and ‘faster touch response’” —yes, air quotes were used— “for a second and just talk about the basics. The StarkPhone three models ago already had better processing speed, storage, battery life, pretty much anything you can name. Not to mention the helpful little tutorial AI who will guide you through absolutely anything—which, I’m figuring you’d need, considering, you know.” He waved a hand at the phone still clutched in Steve’s hand. “You’re talking to Siri.”
Because when Tony arrived at the coffeeshop twenty minutes before closing, prepared to dramatically announce his entrance, he found Steve engaging in what seemed to be a serious conversation . . . with Siri.
Coming back as we are
Everyone had come to him, told him that they understand what he is going through. Peter nodded, accepted their hugs and their condolences. He nodded when Thor patted him on the back and told him he fought valiantly, that he should be proud of Tony. He said nothing when Happy and May and Pepper and Rhodey came over to him, told him that he isn’t alone in this. He smiled when Clint and Bruce and Scott all gave him soft smiles and promises of always being here for him, no matter what. He accepted Bucky and Sam’s apologies, and he accepted T’Challa and Carol and Quill’s sympathetic smiles. He thanked them for understanding, for being there – but all he wanted to do was tell them to
He sees hope in his counterpart’s eyes; in a way he doesn’t think he ever saw in himself. “Is he okay?” Rogers croaks out, his overwhelming emotions apparent.
The team are all huddled together in their meeting room, strategizing ways in which they could catch the Winter Soldier out. Steve stays quiet during the discussion, speaking only when spoken to. The team all know the truth, know how little Steve can truly discuss with them, and for the most part they adhere to the rules Steve and Tony had set out for them, all those months ago.
“Hey,” Tony says. “I’m not going to leave you over this. I understand why you did it, and I understand it’s not his fault either. I was angry at first, when you told me. I wanted to find him and strange him with my bare hands. But I know now that it’s not his fault.”
He didn’t understand why Mr Stark would look at him like that, but it was then that he realised that he looks older. Not physically, though there are physical changes Peter doesn’t remember seeing an hour (five years) ago. But there was something there, as if time hadn’t been kind to him.
“Are those…?” Steve breathes out.
“So you wanna tell me about her?” Sam asks, smirking at the ring on his finger.
“Okay,” he says, pressing a kiss to Tony’s forehead.
He is a coward, because he has spent so long wishing, hoping, pining – and he has all he wants now. He isn’t strong enough to let go of it.
“I was scared,” Steve replies. “Last time, everything went to shit when I told you. I know that was my own fault, I should have told you as soon as I found out. But I still lost you, Tony. This is how I lost you. I couldn’t bear it to happen again.”
Steve is a liar though, just like Tony said, because Steve couldn’t expect it. He saw a second chance, and he needed it.
Tell you I'm sorry
“Tony,” he says, pulling away from the hug.  “I need to tell you something.”
Steve Rogers is in love with Tony Stark.
He died - and in that moment, as he watched the blue light of the arc reactor dull until it completely snuffed out – he didn’t think he would ever be okay again.
“I know,” he says.
“Talk to me,” she whispers into his ear.
Steve finds Steve – Rogers, as he has been mentally calling his alternate version in his head – leaning against the balcony of the tower.
Steve can see the exact moment Tony understands, because he closes his eyes and lets out a deep breath, leaning into Steve’s touch. Steve continues, “I wasn’t going to stay, I just came to take a look at you, just see you once before I had to go back to my time. But then you looked up, and you smiled at me and I wasn’t strong enough to walk away. I couldn’t.”
“I got nothing for you, Steve!” he had said, his face sullen and so so broken.
“Years,” Tony whispers, though to whom Steve does not know. “Jesus, Steve – years.” The look on Tony’s face is desperate.
Scott came up to him after the funeral.
And then he gained them again.
“May I have this dance, sir?” he says with a flirty tone.
Tony Stark was the stars, and Steve Rogers was the sea, and they were destined to be apart.
Steve’s eyes soften, and he gently places his hand upon Peter’s shoulder.
so here is the last chapter of this story!!
“Because the past – your past – that isn’t my home anymore. I lost my home. This is the only place I could find him.”
But he can be here, this time around. He can stop it, stop all of it. He can save Tony.
“You love him that much?” Rogers asks sincerely.
“That doesn’t look like corporate files, sweetheart,” he says playfully, depositing himself on the large armchair beside Tony.
“Thank you,” Steve whispers sincerely, his lips ghosting over Tony’s skin.
Tony is there, alive and whole, his AC/DC t-shirt smeared with grease and motor oil, an expanse of empty mugs of coffee scattered on the table in front of him, a clear proof of the countless hours he has probably spent in the lab. Steve can tell he has music playing, because Tony’s hips are swaying rhythmically, his head bobbing to a fast tune as he stares at the screen in front of him. His face is lit up in blue – the blue screen, the blue reactor, and he looks absolutely ethereal.
And then, well, in the space of an hour (5 years) he was fighting a giant purple grape again.
Somewhere, behind Tony a kid shouts “Mr Stark!” The voice is both achingly familiar and unfamiliar to Peter, because this kid has a bounce Peter hasn’t been able to muster in a while. A smile spreads across Tony’s face when he hears the voice, warm and indulgent, and that is the last image Peter is left with as the hologram feed cuts.
Clint was going back to his family, as he should.
hope you guys enjoyed this chapter!! nothing much happened in it, unfortunately, but hopefully we'll see a bit more action in the next one.
Steve had called everyone almost immediately, and it didn’t take them too long to show up.
In all honesty, Steve had every intention of never going back.
“In this other timeline, were we together?” Tony asks.
, and more weirdly –
A nod.
Rhodey – he had stopped crying long ago, but he had this haunted look in his eyes, one that Peter was all too familiar with. Sometimes he would hear a sound, and his head would whip around expectantly. There would be a hint of a smile on his face, only for a split second. It would disappear as soon as he would realise that it’s not the person he has been waiting for.
“I’m just sayin’” Clint continues, “it would probably save so many lives.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Open it,” he says.
It sounded like
“How was he?” Peter asks softly.
He takes a deep breath. “He was brainwashed by HYDRA. Kept in some kind of cryogenic freezer for 70 years. At this point, he probably doesn’t even remember who he is.”
“No,” Steve says. “I waited too long and lost any chance of love I could have with you. You didn’t love me.”
“Steve,” Peggy says, her eyes welling up with tears. “
Steve looks at Tony, and in that moment, he doesn’t understand how he could have ever thought he wasn’t in love with this man.
Tony’s figure emerges completely from the thick fog.
“No,” Steve replies honestly. “But he will be.”
“What is it, sweetheart?” Steve asks, stroking Tony’s arm.
Sam was strong, Sam was good, and Sam doesn’t need him. Not anymore.
“What’s up, dear Captain,” Tony says with his trademark smirk.
“I accept,” he says, his voice unwavering.
“Pete… Peter,” Tony says, and Peter can’t bite back the sob that is escaping his mouth. “You are going to be better than all of us. You are going to do amazing things, kid, and I am so proud of you. So is your Tony, wherever he is. I can guarantee that. But I need you to promise me – promise him – that you are going to live. You are not going to let the grief overtake you. You are going to go out there, and you are going to be happy. I love you, kid.”
“Can someone explain to me what the ever-loving fuck is going on?” Nat says, looking at Steve with curious eyes.
“What?” Steve asks, confused.
Past-Steve leans back on his chair, his shoulders slumped with defeat.
This Tony? Looking at this Tony, Peter understands what Steve meant by ‘alive’. Every part of him seems to be glowing – there are laugh lines Peter doesn’t remember his Tony ever having. And it’s more than that, too. He looks softer somehow, without the hard edge that had been carved into his Tony. And he looks younger, although his greying temples tell Peter he is pushing 50 at least. He is the man his Tony could have been, if the world had been nicer to him.
remains unsaid, though they both hear it.
It was okay, because he had Mr Stark with him.
That had been 5 seconds ago for Peter, until he was told the news that it has really been 5 years.
It was then that Peter realised that he had lost five years of his life. But it was okay, it felt okay, because Mr Stark was holding him, whispering things against his ear that Peter couldn’t really make out.
Steve knows he has to tell Tony.
When Peggy opens the door, Steve feels almost complete.
, his brain supplied,
“The thing is, kid, I know what happens. I didn’t all this time, but we defeated Thanos just last week. Steve and I are retiring now. I’m building him a farm in front of a lake and everything – it’s all very American Dream.” Tony laughs, and Peter aches at the sound. “Point is, I got lucky here, in this timeline. I got the love of my life, I got this amazing kid that quite literally fell into my life. And I know I lost some things too. But I don’t regret the life I am living now, and I certainly don’t regret the life I led in your time. Steve tells me I died to save the universe, but importantly, to save
This whole time, he hasn’t really had a chance to mourn Natasha, not really. They had been thrust into the fight, had to keep going to bring everyone back because that is what Natasha would have wanted. Nat gave up her life, and they needed to win – win, so that her sacrifice didn’t go in vain. And when they had won? They lost Tony, and that grief had punched every last shred of his being out of him.
Steve’s hands reach out to stroke Tony’s cheek, and Tony leans into the touch.
“Say, Cap,” Clint says, “you probably know where this Winter Soldier dude is. Why don’t you just tell us and speed up the process?”
“No,” Steve says firmly. “He didn’t take her life. He gave her one in a world that isn’t built on ashes. He didn’t do it for nothing, he did it to give his son a life he always wanted for you. You are allowed to be angry at him, to be sad and to grieve, but one thing you cannot do is say he didn’t love you. He loved you with everything he had.”
They’re the only ones in the diner, and he can feel Tony relaxed against his body. Tony doesn’t hold him the way Peggy did, her head on his chest. No, Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s shoulders, protesting with a
Steve needs to tell him – needs to, because this is the only chance he is ever going to get.
That is how Red Skull found him.
Oh god, -
Can never be okay, because they don’t understand what Peter feels like right now. They can’t, no matter how much they try.
Steve hadn’t considered it, because he knew he hadn’t the first time.
“You banished me to a fate worse than death,” Red Skull says, as if he didn’t hear Steve. “I am going to enjoy watching your pain.”
Peggy stays quiet for a long moment, after he is done.
“I wanted to say I’m sorry,” Steve says, “for what I said that day on the Hellcarrier. I was wrong.”
“I love you too, Tony,” Peter says in between his sobs. “Dad. I love you, too, Dad.”
Tony physically flinches back, and Steve remembers, remembers that flinch and he drops on the chair, his chest heaving with sobs.
“I just want to know one thing,” Tony says quietly. “Why are you here?”
Past-Steve is still... somewhere. He tours America for a bit, fights as Captain America for a bit, and then eventually dies during a mission gone wrong. Our Steve retires as Captain America, so the world doesn't randomly see doubles.
And yes, if you had told Steve Rogers of the 40s that he will find family in a man with anger management issues who sometimes turns into a green rage monster, a literal god from another planet, two super-assassins who know of 57 different ways to kill him with their pinky figure and a genius-billionaire-playboy-philanthropist with arrogance levels that are off the charts and flies around in a metal suit of armour – well, he would punch you first and then advise you to check into the nearest mental institution.
Bruce was taking off tomorrow, to god knows where, in pursuit of solidifying the harmony between himself and the Hulk he had been chasing after for years.
Steve’s eyes widen.
Steve doesn’t know how long he stands there, his eyes glassy with unshed tears. He sees this Tony, a little bruised from the encounter they had with Loki not too long ago, but Tony – alive. He drinks in the image of him, tries to erase the picture of Tony that has been etched into his brain in the last few weeks – the image of a bruised Tony, a burnt Tony, a dead Tony. Instead, he tries replacing it with this Tony – happy, and whole. He raises his hand up, pressing his palm over the glass, his large arms covering Tony’s face. He pretends it is his face Steve is holding, tries to imagine l the rough stubble of his beard, or the softness of his skin, the fluttering of his eyelashes. Steve remembers how they all felt, and yet he wishes he didn’t. He knew how the sensation he felt when Tony’s eyelashes tickled his skin, knew because he had bent over his lifeless form and closed his eyes after he had slept away from the abyss Steve would never get him back from.
or: Steve tries to choose between his head and his heart.
So yes, Steve was happy. Soon, he stopped wallowing in self-pity. He stopped longing for the past, and instead started to embrace the future. He watched frankly outrageous sci-fi movies with the team every Thursday night – the night Tony and Clint had declared Avengers Movie Nights to Integrate Capsicle Into the World. He cooked dinner with Bruce every Friday night, swatting Tony’s hands away as he tried to steal bits of food from the pan. He made blueberry pancakes for Tony every morning, standing guard over them until Tony emerged from his lab so that Clint would not steal some away. He ordered dozens of boxes of pop tarts every day, because a Thor without pop tarts is a grumpy Thor, and no one wants to see a grumpy Thor around. He is like a little golden retriever.

, and learned from Natasha how to use the Internet—and, by extension, Google—to his benefit. He’d never admit it, but the first time Natasha had opened something called Google Chrome on the laptop she’d given him, he’d shrieked at the list of suggestions that had appeared the instant he’d typed a single word into the “search bar.” Once he’d overcome his initial shock, however, Steve had discovered the ease of obtaining information from the Internet. He’d ventured into a few sites he’d rather not have seen, but his overall experience had been better than he’d expected.
? Weren’t the World Wars bad enough for them?
Steve’s heart pounded wildly in his chest, his breathing quickening as panic welled inside him. “Break what?”
“Call me Clint, I don’t need that ‘mister’ or ‘agent’ nonsense. Can I call you Steve?”
be considered a cellphone, in an age where
And Steve had to interject here because “How?”
Steve gritted his teeth and nodded sharply. It wasn’t that he didn’t understand—he hated being treated like he didn’t know better, and he hated that in this case, he really didn’t know anything about the world now. So he turned to the agent and said, “Ms. Romanoff. Thank you in advance for your trouble.”
“Captain Rogers—”
Natasha pursed her lips. “All right, that’ll make this a little harder. Basically, they condensed the computers that took up half a room in your time to fit inside a more portable device.” She lifted the bottom of the laptop and tapped it twice in demonstration. “Using this, you can access and save files of all kinds, and search for new information on the Internet. I’ll teach you how to log in and use Google later. For now, let’s talk about this.”
Steve inclined his head in acknowledgement, but hesitated when he took his first step to leave. “Director, if it’s not too much trouble . . . could I have a notebook and some pencils? The, ah, blank kind. Not the lined ones.”
“Hold on a second,” Steve protested. “I don’t even know who you are.”
Natasha rounded the counter, staring down at Tony with disapproval. “I know the only reason you’re here at this hour is because Pepper forced you to eat and you don’t have food at home, which means you’ve stayed up for far too long already. Steve” —she turned to the blond man— “go grab him a cream cheese bagel and a sandwich, we still have a few left. And don’t make the coffee.”
“Sleep is for the weak,” Tony proclaimed. He took the offered items of food from a pair of hands without a second glance at their owner. “By the way, who’s this?” he said after taking a bite from the bagel.
Contrary to his earlier reluctance, Tony collapsed onto the bed and was asleep within minutes. (Reality proved once again that human beings really should not go without sleep for extended periods of time, for both their own sake and that of people around them.)
Tony nearly threw up his hands in exasperation at the act. “I’m going to overlook the fact that you insulted my tower—
—but I’m not going to budge on this one. I don’t believe it for a second that you don’t realize how much better a StarkPhone is in every sense.”
“A Nokia,” he repeats almost robotically. “A flip phone. A fucking
Steve began without holding back. He channeled all his strength into his fists and each punch sent the bag swinging a metre away before returning. It was only in this that he found an outlet to his rage, his despair at fate’s betrayal. Why him? Why had the world, or whatever deity governed it, allowed Steve to be thawed from the ice into a time that was not his own? Why couldn’t they have left him dead?
Tony pushed the remnants of the dream out of his mind and headed towards the bathroom. He washed his face in cold water until his head was completely clear, but when he slid his hands down from his face, a familiar flash of red caught his eyes.
“My name is Nick Fury. I’m the director of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division. Welcome to the twenty-first century, Captain.”
“Who are you?”
Looking decidedly self-satisfied, Clint finally sat down across from Steve at the table on which he’d laid out his creations. “Hey, once you start working here, you can have the extras whenever you want. Your metabolism will just burn it all off anyway.”
he thought.
His comment drew a surprised laugh from Clint, loud enough to attract the attention of the nearest customers. With a firm pat on his shoulder, Clint told him, “Yeah, you’ll fit in just fine, buddy.”
And that was the end of their interaction.
eyebrows.
Tony could tell what he’d been about to suggest—likely something along the lines of waiting until their next meeting to complete the transaction—and interrupted, “Just start using it for now and I’ll collect the payment another time. I promise I won’t run away from you.” He topped it off with a wink, left a bill on the counter for his drink, and walked out of the shop, hot chocolate in hand, before Steve could say another word.
“That’s all you’ll need to know for now, at least until you get used to this,” she said. “I think you should read up on the advancement of technology before we start on the laptop, though.”
of this world—it would cement his position here, permanently.
“Howard?”
He could’ve demanded a regular price, but to say he didn’t pity Steve would have been a lie. Honestly, an iPhone in this age? And a
(It may have been Steve’s imagination, but he could have sworn he saw warm affection passing between the two of them in that fraction of a second when their eyes had met. The kind of affection he’d shared with Bucky.)
No harm done.)
“Good morning,” she greeted, and her accent wasn’t quite right either, but without all the earlier clues, Steve wouldn’t have thought twice about it. With a glance at her watch, she amended, “Or should I say, afternoon?”
His greatest gift to Steve was the stack of files that Fury explained contained information about all his friends and allies from the war, including their current statuses and locations. They were placed atop the many books Steve had received, and under Fury’s direction, he placed them in his living quarters for future reading. The director assured him that he could reside there for as long as he wished, but would in no way be forced to do so. It was, however, recommended that he stay until appropriately acquainted with modern life.
It didn’t feel quite as it should’ve, Steve decided, but he couldn’t pinpoint why.
“You did, sir.”
Around rush hour, the flow increased as people coming off work came to pick up desserts or grab a sandwich and pastry to-go. Though the food selection was limited—they were a drinks-focused café, after all—its options were well-priced and, judging from the images and their popularity, quite delicious indeed.
“Of course, sir,” JARVIS agreed, and Tony could hear the amusement dripping off his AI’s voice, but he also knew that he’d been awake for too long and the hot chocolate hadn’t helped his fatigue in anyway. Now that the excitement from introducing Steve to the wonders of the StarkPhone had faded, his lack of sleep was even more apparent, both in his appearance and his mind.
Natasha was unmoved by his threat, rolling her eyes as she moved around the counter to take a seat at an empty table. “You wouldn’t, we make the best coffee when you’re not dying of sleep deprivation, and this is the only shop you can stand within walking distance of your tower.”
If Natasha was surprised, she didn’t show it on her face. Instead, she nodded and gestured towards the park in front of them. “Central Park has experienced its ups and downs, and you’ll notice some changes because of that, but I thought you’d appreciate the greenery.” She hesitated, then added, “I’m sure you don’t need me to remind you that it’ll only hurt to dwell on the past, Steve.”
As a child, Steve had never had many chances to indulge in the finer aspects of life—having a billion and one health complications while growing up in the Great Depression will do that to you. So it would’ve been an understatement to describe his reaction as anything less than absolutely entranced.
It wasn’t an unreasonable request, in Steve’s opinion. If Fury had come to him with news of an imminent threat, there would have been no question that his answer would be ‘yes.’ But there was no threat, no war, nor anything else that required uncovering the presence of Captain America. So why would he?
,” he emphasized when Steve’s frown deepened, “because I have now made it my duty to help you, poor soul, by educating you properly on the wonders of modern technology, which is presently represented by Stark Industries products.”
The plane. Peggy.
(Bucky had come down with a cold a day later. Steve served him porridge in bed and drew his portrait as he ate.)
Tony raised a hand to stop him from continuing. “We are fixing this problem, right now.” He pressed the StarkPhone into Steve’s hand and was about to reach for the iPhone when a new concern popped into his mind. “You don’t have anything of value on that right? You probably don’t, since you haven’t even had this thing for a month yet, so I’m assuming you won’t mind replacing it with this much better device.
“Yes, ma’am,” he replied automatically. “Are those—are those supposed to help me do that?”
Whatever case it was, Steve couldn’t sleep.
I admit that most of this was written during times I should have been studying... Whoops. I might've also angsted over the characterization of basically everyone but I think the result was worth it. Thanks again to my lovely beta for enduring all my questions XD
Tbh this chapter was supposed to be the first meeting between Steve and Tony but the characters had a mind of their own and I somehow got to 3000 words before realizing Tony hadn't been introduced yet lol. My updates unfortunately won't be as quick from now on because school is about to get reallyyyy busy, but I'll try to write whenever I can (I have a habit of stress-writing so I guess we'll see).
That last bit still needed more observation though, Tony decided as he climbed into bed. It could have simply been a coincidence on Steve’s part.
When he’d finished drawing the night view of New York as seen through his window, Steve glanced at the clock and blinked in surprise. 11:34 PM. When had it become so late?
Steve blinked down at the box. “A computer.” He was tempted to glance at the walls to see if they’d hidden the processing units behind the paint, but something told him that would make him seem . . . well, technologically uneducated.
“Hi, Steve.” Hearing her humour-filled voice through the device while she stood a foot away was odd, but Steve wasn’t really in the mood to care. “Okay, press the red little phone symbol to end the call.”
“. . . so you see, there’s absolutely no reason—many negative ones, in fact—for you to carry around an
babysitters. The secret agent kind.
“Just take it, Steve.” Sometime during their conversation (or Tony’s one-sided attempt to persuade Steve of the StarkPhone’s superiority), Natasha had returned from the kitchen after storing away the unused ingredients. “He won’t stop until you concede, otherwise, so if you agree now it’ll save the nonstop marketing later on.” She stuffed a paper mug into Tony’s hand and it was only after he lifted it to his face that he realized it was hot chocolate, not coffee.
“Punk,” Bucky had retorted, his arm resting on the back of the bench behind Steve.
“Nope, no, none of that,” Tony interrupted. “Mr. Stark was my father. It’s just Tony. And speaking of which—”
been built in his time, after all—but nothing of such modern design. (He used ‘design’ quite loosely because frankly, some of them were downright hideous.)
“. . . Yes?”
,” she stressed, then turned away momentarily to direct a much warmer smile and a small wave to Dum-E, who had wandered towards her with his singular arm lifted in greeting.
Steve took the phone from her when she offered it and tentatively experimented in pressing a few of the buttons as Natasha had demonstrated earlier.
Later into the evening, when the crowd had gone, Steve stepped out from behind the counter to clean up the nearest tables. Natasha had switched with Clint mid-afternoon and was currently organizing their cups and other materials. Steve had asked earlier whether it was okay for them to be staying with him at the coffee shop instead of doing their S.H.I.E.L.D. work, but she’d assured him that a) they had the time and were not dealing with anything of stronger urgency, and b) Steve was of high enough priority to occupy their time.
(That wasn’t a lie. But it wasn’t quite the truth either.)
Tony wanted to bang his head into the table, but caught Pepper’s unimpressed look and held up his hands. “I’m going, I’m going.”
As men in dark suits exited the cars and began to keep the crowd away, a bald man with an eyepatch approached him. His expression betrayed nothing, but his voice held genuine concern as he said, “Look, I’m sorry about that little show back there but . . . we thought it best to break it to you slowly.”
The last sentence seemed to have been relayed with a pointed look at Tony, which he would have ignored whether or not JARVIS had eyes.
“Tony,” Steve cut in before Tony had a chance to ask what he had been wondering since their last meeting, “I’m immensely grateful for your explanations. Unfortunately, I must say I didn’t understand even half of it—I’m less than a beginner when it comes to smartphones, I only got this one” —he pointed to the iPhone left abandoned on the counter— “last week. Before that, I was using a—I believe it’s called a Nokia? One of the ones you flip open. So I’m afraid your sales pitch may have been wasted.”
The message, it turned out, was not a summons. Well, not an immediate one, at least (and thank God for that). It turned out that S.H.I.E.L.D. had adjustments to their demands regarding the helicarrier vehicles that Tony had begun to design, which meant that Tony would have to make accommodations for whatever they want to add to—or hopefully take away from—their lengthy and tedious list.
Then, he introduced Steve to the gym. Though the layout and equipment were somewhat unfamiliar, he was endlessly grateful for the punching bags lining the back wall—he would probably end up using them later when he needed to unleash his suppressed emotions. (If you asked Steve, he’d tell you he’d done quite well to hide his frustration from Fury so far.)
He glanced at the keypad and spotted the red button to the opposite side of the green one. Upon pressing it, he saw the message on the screen that notified him of the call’s end.
Red . . .
It had been a while since Tony had found himself so intrigued by someone—the last person had been Natasha Romanoff, and he’d learned
Steve’s insides lurched as the announcer continued. That couldn’t be right. He remembered this game from May of 1941, remembered watching it from the stands, hands clenched into fists as he urged,
talked to Siri? And expected real, useful responses?
He turned in a circle, then another, his eyes scanning over everything again and again although his brain could not keep up with how
Steve remembered intimately the last time he’d been in Central Park. Although the view was different, there was no doubt where they were. The memories crashed through his mind in an unstoppable wave, and he took a step into the park, then another, his body moving as if in a trance.
instinctively glance towards the pinky finger adorned by a single string, wiped the breadcrumbs on his fingers, and then accepted the handshake. “Tony Stark.”
Steve found his gaze constantly straying away from the road in front of him and latching onto advertisements, fast food restaurant signs, and towering skyscrapers. He’d seen his fair share of tall buildings—the Empire State
it all felt. It was overwhelming, the lights and images that almost seemed to multiply each time he looked.
It was rather pathetic that he achieved neither.
“Captain Rogers, this is Agent Romanoff. She will accompany you anytime you need to go outside.” He held up a hand before Steve’s protests could push past his lips. “This is for your own safety, Captain. The world has changed since the forties and until you can hold your own in a conversation of modern pop culture references and slang, I’m afraid I can’t let you go out alone.”
for a solid thirty seconds before he remembered why he was there in the first place, and that had not been to ogle stare incredulously at the man conversing with the Apple device.
Steve stared at the device for a few more seconds before nodding slowly. “I think so.”
Also, do you guys think I should write some chapters in Tony's POV? There's so much opportunity if I occasionally use his perspective, but consistency... I'm not sure what I'll do yet :/
. Are you telling me that in addition to using an Apple product, you’ve been using that hunk of metal which absolutely
Steve’s eyes shot open and he clenched his fists tightly over the mattress, trying to shut off the influx of thoughts in his mind. He felt his heartbeat slow to a steady pulse and snuck another look to the clock.
And that was the truth, Steve realized, but not all of it. He gave her a once-over, glanced out the window and then at the radio before turning back to her. “Where am I really?”
Steve nodded in acknowledgement, his eyes wandering to Clint’s ears. Now that he was closer, he could see small devices hooked at the backs of his ears with thin tubes leading into them. They didn’t look like anything Steve had seen before, but if he had to hazard a guess . . .
“I have a proposal for you, Captain,” Fury said after a beat, during which Steve had not moved a muscle under the director’s observing eye. “How do you feel about joining a team of exceptional individuals as Earth’s defense to external forces?”
As his senses began to realign themselves with his consciousness, Steve pushed himself up to a sitting position slowly and took in his surroundings. He felt tension from inactivity pulsing in his muscles as he swung his legs over the side of the bed. There was a fan turning slowly on the ceiling and the only source of light came from two open windows (other than a lamp so dim it contributed almost nothing).
“Nat, if you keep doing this, I’m gonna have to reconsider coming to this shop,” Tony complained after begrudgingly drinking a third of the cup. “You could have at least given me something iced.” He knew Natasha wouldn’t agree to make him an actually cup of coffee—she and Pepper were teaming up against him, he was sure.
Tony had never seen one like it.
Roughly an hour before closing, Steve was startled out of his persistent staring match with the clock by the chime of the bell as the door opened. “Welcome to Happs,” he started, the customary greeting falling from his lips instinctively before he abruptly cut himself off and took in the stranger’s appearance.
“Sure you don’t.” A casual smirk on his face, Bucky had lifted his arm and Steve had known he was going to ruffle his hair but stood there and allowed him to do just that. “Gotta keep yourself warm, or you’ll get sick again and then who would I tease?” Then, he’d spotted a bench and dragged them both over to rest.
“Shut up,” Steve had responded, though in reality he’d been a bit winded from their long walk across the park. “Quit mothering me and just walk.”
When Fury did not speak, Steve continued, “If you truly need me, when such a danger arises, I will stand by the team you have assembled and fight as I always have. In the meantime, it looks like I’m here to stay, so I’d like to start a new life.” In his gaze, unspoken, he conveyed exactly how serious he was about this decision and the stubbornness with which he would hold this choice to the end.
By the time he called Natasha to pick him up, Steve was beginning to feel the consequences of his superhuman metabolism, combined with not having eaten enough at breakfast that morning (he was trying to save food, okay?). Clint’s solution was to feed him an assortment of baked goods that he’d made for the café as potential candidates for future weekly specials.
Enjoy!
Second, who
Their proximity had always made Steve feel warmer than any number of clothes or blankets. It had become second nature for him to be beside Bucky, to have his hands helping him stand after a confrontation and to hear his laughter in his ear. His mother had told him once that home was a person, not a place, and it had been in these moments that Steve had known with more certainty than ever that Bucky was his home.
Steve Rogers . . .
,” Tony finished with a self-satisfied grin.
Once she was gone, Clint waved Steve into the back room. “The other employees will be preparing the food in here throughout the day and they’ll pass it to you using this counter here.” He pointed to the window in the wall between them that had a wide metal surface as its base. At Steve’s look of awe towards the machinery inside, he added, “You’ll never need to be back here, don’t worry.”
Steve only understood the scope of what Fury’s
Steve shook his head. “Don’t worry about it. Besides, when you put it like that, I’m not sure I’d like to experience it.”
And after seventy years . . . was there anyone he knew left in this world?
The director invited Steve to return to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters (not that Steve had any other options) and explained first and foremost that the Allies had won. Which Steve had already partially inferred, based on the lack of
With a sigh, Steve swung his legs off the bed and left the room, tracing the steps from Fury’s earlier tour towards the gym. He was briefly startled by the lights that had turned on overhead as soon as he’d taken two steps into the room, but recovered quickly (after falling into a defensive stance because, hey, there could’ve been an intruder trying to blind him with lights, okay?). He headed straight to the punching bag hanging from the ceiling near the back, remembering last minute to wrap his hands using a roll of gauze that he found on one of the benches nearby.
The first few hours of his shift passed uneventfully. Steve became the subject of a few wide-eyed and unabashed stares (and unintentionally heard many whispers complimenting his physique that made his ears turn red) but managed to only mess up once while ringing up orders. In his defence, the customer had ordered something he’d been sure the café didn’t serve, until he’d realized half of the things they’d said were add-ons printed in a tiny font at the bottom of the menu.
Steve stood stiff and still, his gaze never wavering as he held Fury’s eyes. “With all due respect, sir,” he started, knowing that Fury must have known anything beginning with such a phrase would traditionally be disrespectful or rejective, “I may be a soldier, but we are not at war. I’d like some time to . . . to make New York my home again.”
‘Steve’ complied as Tony began to protest, “Come on, Nat, don’t be like that. I need to get back to work.”
He froze. Nostalgia slammed into him like a bucket of cold water.
She glared at him. “You need to sleep.”
Steve took the opportunity to step up and extend his hand. “Steve Rogers, pleasure to meet you.”
“Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Barton.” He held out his hand and the agent shook it, his grip firm.
He thought back to Steve from the coffeeshop and the string that was tied around his right pinky. Tony had been able to see soulmate strings for as long as he could recall, though he’d long since realized it was more of a curse than a blessing. Most people knew of the existence of those strings—crimson red connections between fated companions, romantic or platonic—but whether they believed in them was a different story. Tony, well, he didn’t have a choice.
Although Steve’s sense of justice and loyalty had never wavered, he wasn’t sure he was ready to be Captain America again. And who was to say the world was ready for him?
was a logical assumption, because anyone who owned an iPhone and sought for help from Siri was, by his standards, technologically incompetent).
“I know Fury’s already given you books to catch you up on all the history you’ve missed, but you’ll need new technology if you want to understand how today’s world works.” She pointed to the file. “This details your new life—your backstory, your living accommodations, your resume, and your job.”
After his experimentation with the Internet had granted him enough knowledge about current culture that Steve hadn’t been able to truly understand from the history books, Natasha deemed him to have progressed far enough to be released into the world (under supervision, of course). She handed him a schedule of his shifts at the coffee shop and told him to begin the following Monday.
It was Manhattan, that much he knew—he could recognize the New York City streets anywhere, no matter how much they differed from what he was used to. Almost as soon as he’d exited the building, a car that looked nothing like the ones he’d ever seen—not even Stark’s ‘flying’ ones—nearly collided with him. Pedestrians hurried along the side of the road, shielding themselves from the drizzle with dark umbrellas. Steve barely spared a glance at all of it as he picked up the pace and ran as far as he could from wherever he’d been held before, though he only had a vague sense of where he was going.
“You know that’s
“Already done, sir. Might I add that Ms. Potts will arriving at nine tomorrow morning, so it would be poor judgment to continue a project tonight. Or to begin one, sir.”
before that? If Tony were any older, he’d probably have a heart attack.
“I don’t need your charity, Mr. Stark,” Steve bit out, appearing to have lost his patience. Tony didn’t know whether this newfound anger was due to his persistence or his attitude, but outwardly, he didn’t react. “It’s kind of you to offer, but I’m afraid I’ll have to decline.”
Welcome, indeed.
Steve exhaled in relief, knowing he would soon regain some form of the past. “Thank you, Director. Good afternoon.”
“Try to memorize most of the stuff we sell and their prices, especially the special items of each week,” he advised. “It’ll make working the machine and answering questions a lot easier for you.”
His second visit
He must’ve been less subtle than he’d thought, because Clint noticed his staring and said, “Whatever you’re thinking, it’s probably right.”
“And who gave her that authority again?”
Upon walking through the door, the first thing Tony noticed was the emptiness of the café, which wasn’t unusual given the time. The second was the man behind the counter who had looked up at the chime of his arrival.
“This is not a decision you need to make today, Cap.” Fury gestured towards the broken punching bag. “I’m sure you still have a lot to process.”
Tony quickly quoted a price that wasn’t even close to what the company would be demanding when this model entered the market in a few months, and judging by the amused expression on Natasha’s face, she knew it too. But Tony was betting on his instinct and observations that Steve wasn’t nearly as knowledgeable about the current smartphone market and certainly wouldn’t notice how unrealistic it may be.
in his head. It made Steve uneasy just recalling it because he knew he’d crashed that plane into the ocean and even if he’d been rescued (unlikely in itself, he’d known the odds when he went in), this kind of bare room wouldn’t have been the type of place in which he’d awaken. And the game—that was a major red flag.
. The brown-haired man who stood behind the counter was completely focused on a small device in his hand and did not look up at their arrival. It seemed rude not to acknowledge one’s customers, in Steve’s opinion, so he rapped his knuckles on the wall by the door. Still, the man continued on as if he hadn’t heard.
Steve’s mind was trying to process her brief description without dwelling too much on all the unfamiliar terms—Internet? Log in?
Thankfully, Natasha was patient with him. “You see the small letters beside numbers two to zero? If you press each button once after opening the option to text, it’ll input the first letter. Press it twice or three times fast to reach the second and third ones. Then, when you’ve constructed your message, press send.” She sent ‘hi’ to her own number and dug out her phone (also a flip phone, Steve noticed, though it may have been for his benefit) to show that she’d received it.
“Wait, are you talking about Stark Tower?” Steve interjected. “That big ugly building one block down? That’s
Unfortunately, in his eagerness to relieve his frustration, Steve had forgotten to take into account his own strength. With a particularly strong hit, the punching bag flew off its chain and landed just in front of the wall, split open, leaving Steve’s arm frozen mid-swing without a target. He let both his arms drop to his sides, breathing heavily—not at the physical exertion, but the emotions that he’d allowed to surface from their repressed place in his mind.
But that would be a question for his refreshed brain to ponder in the morning. If he had any time to do so between all his projects.
True to Fury’s word, two notebooks and a sturdy cloth bag—a pencil case, Steve was informed—that contained HB and 2B pencils, an eraser, and three black pens arrived in Steve’s room shortly before dinner. He ate quickly, deciding he was finished long before he felt full, and spent the rest of his evening curled up against the headboard of his bed, notebook balanced on his knee. Art had always been his one remedy whenever he needed to untangle his mess of emotions. In his sketches, Steve could clear his mind and focus solely upon that which brought him happiness, and there was nothing he needed more after the day’s events.
