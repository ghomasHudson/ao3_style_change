Tiberius poked his head in and immediately looked up at the ceiling.  "Sorry. Pill, Steve," he said.
CAPTAIN AMERICA!"  Others had taken a more aggressive stance, such as, "OMEGAS DESERVE BETTER," (which had made Tony feel shitty because he agreed with them... Steve probably did deserve better) and, "Α + Ω + Α = LOVE" (which had made Tony feel shitty because they weren't in a trio and the idea of being in a trio with another Alpha absolutely sickened him.
He rolled onto his side, propped up on one elbow, watching Steve with undisguised interest, the sheets draped at his waist.  The arc reactor was glowing, strong and steady, the triangle sharp in its center.  Tony wondered if Steve thought the scars were gross.  He had, for a while.  The light had kept him up, too, for months.  But now, two years later, he was so used to it, he couldn't imagine it not being there.  Sometimes, if he woke up to a dark room, a pillow pressed over the reactor, he panicked, thinking it had gone out and that he would die.  Its glow was comforting, a promise that he wasn't going to buy the farm... not yet, anyway.
Steve was clearly confused. His eyes darted back and forth across the kitchen island, without focusing on any specific object. He seemed to do the math and tried to put together a timeline that made no sense to him. Tony then had his answer. No, Steve didn’t know about his memory loss and he wasn’t sure which feeling to choose to live that moment. He had several at his disposal. In the end, Tony chose relief with doses of apprehension. It seemed appropriate.
“That you missed me and that you thought about me all this time?” Steve’s eyes shone with anticipation and practically shouted “say yes!”
Tony took a breath. “Know that everything I’m going to tell you now has also been told to me. I can’t say with one hundred percent certainty that it all happened just like that. But I trust the people who gave me that information.” Tony shrugged.
"Come on." Tony put an arm around Steve's shoulders and guided him to the quinjet. "You think you can get your energy back in two hours?"
"The signature is the same in both." Vision moved one hand, indicating the young woman leaning over the fountain, and the ship. "But what intrigues me is how that is possible.”
"Yeah, I didn’t. But I want you to fulfill your part of the bet entirely. You need to love this party, remember?”
“To lose you again,” Tony found himself speaking quietly. “But this time I will remember everything.” He looked at Steve, took a deep breath and continued. It was now or never. “I’m afraid to accept that it’s no longer possible to separate our lives, because every time I try to move away, chaos sets in and I realize that I can’t imagine my life without you. I’m afraid to open my heart, as I’m doing now, and to give you my heart in the end, and confess that I’m in your hands. I tried to stay away, to forget, but the truth? Do you want the truth?” Steve nodded and Tony resigned himself. It was about time to stop the lies, to deny the evidence. Tony squeezed Steve’s hands. “The truth is, I am and I have always been crazy about you, Steve.” Tony realized that since he had arrived at the apartment, that was the first time he had said Steve’s name out loud. It tasted good, sweet and comfortable in Tony’s tongue, as if it were meant to be spoken by Tony all the time.
"On the way to the quinjet, Captain. Black Widow took the liberty of carrying your shield with her.”
"Yes," Steve confirmed with a nod. "As we're dealing with energy readings, Thor and Vision are going too.”
The girl stared at Natasha, seemingly not understanding the question. In the other room, Steve and Tony straightened up in the chairs. After a few seconds of silence, Tony saw the expression of understanding appear on her face and it was lovely to see her eyebrows arching, her mouth opening into a perfect “o” and her eyes widening slightly.
"Mind telling us what's so funny, Stark?" Tony heard Fury ask and forced himself to look away from Steve, who smiled beautifully at him.
After that, there was no room for many other words, with mouths occupied on each other and everywhere where there was exposed skin. They had a lot of time lost to make up, many wounds to heal, but the prospect of a new, bright and optimistic future, full of possibilities only served to warm hearts even more, to bubble blood and increase the volume of moans and sighs. Tony was afraid that all of New York would hear him scream Steve’s name, but in the end, he didn’t care. Let everyone know who he belonged to, to whom Steve dedicated his love. They were each other’s and Tony wanted everyone to know.
“Won’t take long. Try to relax, okay?” Natasha smiled at her and walked away, heading toward the front of Quinjet. “Contact either of those two and see if they've gone back to the Compound,” she whispered to Clint and Sam.
“I will, don’t doubt that, not even for a second,” Steve stroked Tony’s face and left his hand there, stroking the hair on the back of Tony’s neck, who bent his head to kiss Steve’s bare wrist. “You are the reason I came back, because
The vault door opened and Tony dragged himself in there. The box was still in the same place, in the center of the vault, but it was no longer glowing. Tony took it with one hand and headed back to the lab.
“Well, according to Urich, he didn’t need to publish that information to ruin me because I would ruin myself, after all, apparently, this was what happened to people like me,” Tony said, remembering the conversation he watched between him and Ben Urich, recorded by his office security system. Tony laughed through his nose, but the sound was like a sad moan. “Thinking about it now, I wonder if that wasn’t a dark prophecy.”
“Because then I will owe you a favor.” Strange said without even blinking, as if that was obvious and the best thing in the world all at the same time.
unexpected turns. He wasn’t expecting that question. He should simply tell his version of the story and that’s it. Tony realized that he was trapped by Steve’s hands, that they were extremely close to each other, as they hadn’t been in a while, and Tony’s heart raced. He swallowed.
Tony thought without being able to look away from the soldier, who had gone to get a slice of pepperoni pizza and gave a nice bite.
“Well, it wasn’t my best choice, but Thor and I managed to drive his lightning bolts with my shield, hitting straight into your new reactor. It worked, but you remained unconscious,” Steve shrugged sheepishly and looked away.
“It’s amazing how one experience can put all others in perspective,” Steve suddenly said, without looking in any specific direction, and Tony found himself freezing in place, afraid that not even his armor’s camouflage would be able to cover him up there. “On any other day, some time ago, I would’ve said that the night could be better, with less clouds in the sky, to be able to see the moon,” Steve continued in a soft, almost dreamy voice. “But now, after everything that happened, I just feel grateful to be here and to be able to see the sky exactly as it is.”
"All right." What else could Steve say? The man had just said that he liked him, even though they had known each other for a few hours, that there was a connection, whatever it was. But it was a good thing. So, how to avoid that it was something, and to let that keep happening?
Tony was still silent and Steve could almost see his brain working, weighing the possibilities, the pros and cons. Finally, he looked at Steve. "I don't want to bother you any more than necessary."
“What happens now? What happens when we decide to leave here and face the world outside?” Tony turned his face away and listened to Steve’s heartbeat, amazed at the perfection with which he fit every curve of Steve’s body, ecstatic that they were halves of each other.
Tony thought somewhere in his mind, moaning loudly when their tongues met. A shiver of pure pleasure ran through Tony's body as he heard Steve moaning too, the vibration coming from the back of his throat. It was more than he'd dreamed, more than he'd expected all along, but at the same time it was all he ever wanted. Steve's taste was intoxicating, inviting, sensual and
"I am," Steve blew out a breath and grabbed the door handle. Peter was behind there, waiting for him. Afraid, scared, needing him. More than ever.
Steve thought, watching Wanda dodge skillfully from the onslaught of Cerberus to attack him right away with her powers. Sure that she could handle well, Steve ran toward the infernal dog's left flank.
“We've heard your story,” Steve said. “And we're deeply sorry that you've been through all those things. No one should carry such a heavy burden in such a short time.”
Before Steve could say anything, Tony wrapped his fingers in his hair and pulled him, sticking their mouths together. Steve wrapped Tony in his arms and slid his hands down his back, finally without shame, without any fear of being caught. It was just the two of them and their desire for each other.
Tony looked into Steve’s eyes, and he looked right back at Tony. Both of them were obviously savoring the sensation.
Tony faced the other two Avengers. Natasha had already put away her batons and was looking at Strange with disinterest, but when it came to her, one could never know for sure. Steve was ... Tony allowed himself to check him out. Steve was beautiful as always, radiant in the sunlight setting on the horizon. Tony blew out a breath. Steve was too much for him. Completely out of his league.
Tony smiled without showing his teeth as he remembered that day, a memory as clear as if it had happened hours earlier. “Because that’s still the best day of my life,” he looked at Steve. “We had no pretensions at all that day, nothing extraordinary should happen and, suddenly, we found that frozen man who, in the end, ended up being the hero of my childhood and youth,” the two exchanged smiles. “I’ll never stop feeling a secret pride for being the first person you spoke to when you woke up,” Tony fell silent as soon as he realized what he had said.
Despite trying to deny it, the urgent sensation grew, taking over Tony's body and bringing the worst headache he had ever felt in his life. Shaking his head -
," he must have made a face of panic or something, because Tony came over and put a hand on his shoulder and looked at him. Steve noticed the difference in height between them, the difference of a head, but it was ideal ... for something Steve couldn't name.
"Strange? Unusual? Unorthodox? A little unethical?" Tony cringed a little at each thought. "Yes, I know, Rhodes. I know. But you weren't there when he offered. You weren't swept away by his adorable smile. I took the whole hit alone and couldn't handle it. So now I'm the Rogers' newest guest."
Tony walked over to meet them halfway and looked at Peter's hands, joined in front of his body by a pair of handcuffs that were clearly attached too tightly to the boy's fists, with the skin around them red and stuffed. Tony looked at Rhodes very seriously. "Get these things out of him." Rhodes looked at Tony as if to apologize, but he pulled a bunch of keys out of his pocket and freed Peter from the handcuffs. The boy rubbed his aching fists, and looked at Tony. "Thank you, Detective," Tony said, taking Peter’s backpack from Rhode’s hands. "We’ll talk again soon, I hope."
"Why going so fast, Mr. Stark?" Steve smirked, clutching Tony's waist, gluing him to his naked body.
“Under no circumstances open this box. No matter how tempting it may be, how curious you may be. Don't. Open. This. Box.” Strange said slowly and emphatically each word. He looked deep into Tony's eyes and his look was a great warning that he meant it. “You got it?”
Tony let out a weak noise but Happy was already closing the door behind him.  He turned to Steve to ask his opinion, but the words died on his lips because Steve was kicked off his socks and leaning back, belt already off, and Tony's mouth was watering.
"Steve.  I wanna look for Trickshot," said Tony, looking at the map beside Steve.  The map was innocuous. There were classrooms labeled, a common room, a reading and study room, a gym, a cafeteria... it had all the trappings of a regular junior high school.
"...glad one of us was paying attention," said Tony, forcing a smile.  "I'd better go get him before he gets into trouble, tries voting or something crazy.  ...take care of DeSoto, Ron, he's a sweet guy, seriously."
"Tony has a habit of freaking out over things.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Your other mate is not part of this equation," said Pepper firmly.
"...this one?" said Rhodey in confusion, reaching out and picking up a heavy ceramic vase from a small table.
going out... it's my birthday, after all," said Tony.  He paused and looked down at his hands. He picked at a hangnail, then put his finger in his mouth.  Tony was a nail-biter, something that his manicurists no doubt found very aggravating.
"You were bonded once. You don't remember that. They took everything away, didn't they? S'why I stopped feeling you. But the bond is broken." Steve leaned forward again. "I know you felt me. And I know you felt Tony. When I kept seeing you outside, a part of me knows that was real.  Somewhere in our subconscious, we're still tied together, somehow."
Tony looked around a bit blankly.  "Er," he said, intelligently. He wasn't sure.  Fortunately, the elevator next to them chimed and J. Jameson strutted out with Joan and Maria on his arms.
He had not spoken to President Ellis since he had been unfrozen.  Their exchange had been brief; Steve had stood on a stage as the president said, "Welcome back, Cap," for the cameras, and that was that.  Steve was looking forward to a real meeting.  He'd never much liked politicians but, then, he was willing to give Ellis a chance.  After all, this was the 21st century.  Maybe things had changed.
He pulled Steve into his mouth, sucking noisily, playing his tongue over Steve's skin, one steadying hand still on Steve's smooth, pale thigh.  He reached between Steve's legs with his other hand to stroke his entrance gently; Steve's hole twitched in response, already wet. Tony could smell his mate's arousal and the smell alone was getting him off.  This was something that he'd never quite experienced with betas, the sort of maddening hands-off arousal that came from pheromones.
They stepped out of the way of some dancers and Steve reached up to wipe up at Tony's face with the napkin again. The bleeding had mostly stopped, but it still looked sore.
Then she went home for Christmas (home was in Connecticut) and Tony spent Christmas by himself, getting slowly trashed, which is how he remained through New Year.  He wasn't sure how to ask Steve, or for that matter Pepper, what they'd do for Christmas eve this year. Tony hadn't even realized how much the tradition meant to him until he started considering what the year would feel like without it.  He kept hoping Pepper would bring it up so he wouldn't have to.
Steve almost smiled at their bickering. "I missed you JARVIS," he told him and it felt surprisingly normal to say to an AI.
There was a collection of tables and chairs. The courtyard was covered in a blue canopy that draped over small arches they were entwined with vine leaves. It was a gorgeous and homely place and it made something seize in Steve's chest. He squeezed Tony's hand.
"So it's two hours until the shit actually hits the fan, got it," Steve said conversationally, trying to look casual.  DeSoto frowned.  "I mean the auction," clarified Steve.
"My God, how did you get this far without knowing any of this?  ...you know, Captain America is actually pushing for omega education--"
, he thought, fondly.  Love, longing, a desire to nurture and protect and provide for.  Bucky felt whole again; he felt a range of emotions he hadn't in probably seventy years.  There were no words but none were needed. Their bond, like most, was one of feeling, of emotions.
Part of the reason, Tony suspected, that Justin hovered around was because he, like Tony, was not an especially strong Alpha but he, like Tony,  happened to be in a business that drew lots of intense Alphas, ones of high dominance.  Their pheromones screamed aggression and assertiveness.  But there was a difference between Tony and Justin.  Tony would have been remarkable if he were a beta; Tony's claim to fame was his intelligence, not his social status.  Justin clung desperately to his because it was all he had, and revolved madly around Tony, trying to validate his specialness by drawing a comparison between the two of them.
"Don't come into our bedroom," Steve told him simply and stood up, heading to bed. He'd tried to be nice to DeSoto. He thought he could teach him a few things, maybe they'd spar, get to know each other. But the guy kind of spoke to him like the /Alphas did...dismissively, as if Steve didn't know what was really good for him. And his
"Please Bucky?" Steve asked in a murmur. He let Bucky nose against his neck and admittedly shivered at the sensation. He would have felt guilty about this a month ago but Tony had made it pretty goddamn clear he didn't want him anymore, that he didn't care about him. He was still hyperly aware of the fact that Bucky wasn't himself. He didn't even know who he sat cosied up against anymore.
Grabbing Steve around the waist felt weird in the suit; Tony had gotten used to being the smaller, shorter one, but the suit changed that.  Now Tony was the bulky one. He was glad he couldn't easily smell Steve, couldn't feel his skin. Right now, he wanted to think of them as Captain America and Iron Man, not Tony and Steve.
Tony promptly leaned over the railing and vomited.  "...oh, shit!  That was... unexpected.  Wow.  Okay," gasped Tony, heaving.  "Sorry, I... I had a few drinks... actually, I feel a lot better now... I'm ready for Round 2..."  He shook himself out, a cold sweat breaking out over his skin.  "...wouldn't be a party if I wasn't getting palladium poisoning!  I mean alcohol poisoning.  Sorry,
"Status Alliance is all about giving omegas control over their own destinies," said Danielle.  "We just want what Alphas have always had. The right to carve out our own paths."
"Rogers," he whispered again.  "I... I don't feel good.  I gotta go outside and have a smoke.  You wanna come with?"  He didn't add that he hated the way Howard was parading him around like a fancy little show dog.  He wondered if he should possibly tell Rogers the truth: that he didn't know how he'd gotten here or what his name was or even what Rogers's name was, and that he was frankly not sure this was real and that it was possible they were having this conversation in a trench somewhere in France.
Beth, who was hovering nearby, gave a loud scoff of disapproval.  Pepper's phone chimed; she looked down at him and groaned. "Arcadia just tweeted about you, Tony.  It's not flattering.
"It's not your fault," Steve murmured, reaching for Tony's hand and grabbing it. "Promise. He'll get what's coming to him."
Tony was feeling completely wrung out and considering he'd just had two glasses of scotch and a large piece of cake, also a little ill.  He staggered upstairs (Steve could handle Banksy and Donner, he figured) and flopped into his own bed with a groan of appreciation for the cool, soft, luxurious sheets.
"I'm great.  I've got a new ticker, and I'm bonded, and Hammer's been arrested; everything's great.  It's like Christmas.  Say hi to my mate, Pepper."
There was a loud metallic click when the suit had been assembled and Tony stepped off the gantry, giving his fingers a few test-flexes, making sure everything was working right.  It was. He clamped across the concrete floor toward the stairs. He felt better about all this than he had earlier. It was one thing to talk about when they were both in jeans. Knowing Steve had his shield and that he had his armor, and that there was at least some sort of plan, well... that made it a lot different than Steve's situation had been in July.
," he added, feeling acutely offended.  Everyone in the lobby was eagerly taking pictures with their cellphones, despite their various maladies, and security had been called to shoo a crowd from the doors.  Calls from the Expo were pouring in and the combination of a sudden influx of patients along with Iron Man in the ER lobby was causing the hospital to fall into chaos.  Dr. McCloud had every right to be furious.  But in Tony's mind, insulting the suit was a bit much.
"Maybe Bucky wasn't human anymore. You said you stopped feeling him," Natasha pointed out, tone gentle. "It's possible that whatever Zola did to him meant he could survive the fall...hell Steve, look at what
!  What do you mean, you don't take walk-ups?" demanded Tony, putting his forearms on the drive-through window and glaring.
hadn't been an omega captain.  Steve's title had been honorary.  Everyone treated him like a Captain but it was only because he was a super-soldier.  A regular omega would never have been given such a title.  "Can omegas join the army now?" he asked, suddenly curious as he watched Natasha take a dinosaur attack. He almost wanted to ask her the same question:
"This way, please, Mr. Stark," said the colonel politely.  "Captain Rogers was left in one of the second-floor lounges."
Steve froze on the rooftop. He knew how the kid got here up so quick but that didn't make it any less disconcerting. Steve didn't step away; in fact, he stepped closer. He wasn't afraid of the other omega.
"...should we sit down?  Stark looks like he's had about enough," said Matthew Ellis worriedly, casting a glance over at the bar, where Tony was demanding the bartender mix "a pizza shot," whatever that was.
Steve liked Tony with his glasses on, even if they did perhaps make him look a little older.  Maybe he liked that too. "We're going to a research base. Forty-five scientists. Twenty-five armed personnel.  Maybe mutants, too.  Whether they're captive or hostiles, I don't know.  But I have a plan; don't worry," he said, honestly quite excited by it. "It's just a basic recon mission so we're going to be using stealth.  But we'll get into that later. It's high security, which means the personnel probably don't know what's going on the actual labs.  So ideally we'd like to capture one of the scientists, which I doubt will be very hard."
The crowd laughed properly then. Steve turned a little pink, honestly not meaning it like that.  Boswell fondly rolled his eyes with a sigh.
The thought sobered him enough that he was able to let Pepper drag him away before the press attacked them, but the moment they were in the car, Tony felt like someone had punched him in the head all over again.  The thing is, it wasn't a bad feeling.  Tony suddenly felt sharp, alert.  His heart was pounding; his head was swimming.
Three of them had died less than a meter from the vehicle and the fourth had been shot in the cave.  Made an example of.
, I'm just warning you. His job is seriously on the line here. He misused government resources. And he, well...they're going to need a statement from you."
"It wasn't you that put me in danger Tony. I put myself in danger," Steve pointed out calmly, his voice quiet but steady.
They had unceremoniously deposited Steve's and Tony's limp forms on the poured concrete floor; Tony was attempting to drag himself over to Steve, still compelled to breed him.
On the sidelines, the crowd was frozen with panic, watching with shrieks and gasps at the suddenly gladiatorial battle they were being treated to.  And Steve had never been so torn in his life. Break cover or save Tony's life? Fury would kill him if he broke cover. But he'd also kill him if he let Tony die. Steve couldn't win in this scenario, but he also couldn't just watch Tony die. No fucking way. The man who was attacking him, and his creation (a deadly addition to his body), looked fearsome, but with a well-timed kick Steve was sure he could bring him down. Before he knew what he was doing he was bending the railing with his bare hands, the chaos meaning no one had noticed his super-human strength. Steve swallowed thickly before stepping onto the track.
"I could have killed him Sam," Steve said quietly, picking at the sandwich. He wasn't hungry but he didn't dare disobey Pepper right now. Besides, the heat was still leaving him pliable and easy going. He would do most anything anyone told him to, within reason.
This, Tony was aware, was exactly the sort of scandalous thing that would cause a media frenzy.  This was the sort of thing that was just between them, that couldn't be shared with anyone because it was too intimate.  Steve couldn't be seen like this, as a subservient little omega; he was Captain America, national treasure, living legend.  Something about knowing that, though, made it feel even more intimate to Tony.  He had exclusive access to something no one else ever would.
"I will not walk into HYDRA's arms..." Steve said, shaking his head. He was physically trembling and Pietro had a knife and fuck his head hurt. He couldn't see straight. He stumbled. "What...what are you doing..."
His eyes darted across the page.  He ignored the stabbing headache behind his bad eye.  It was no longer fuzzy.
Maybe, he reflected, that was how Natasha and Clint did it.  By separating their battle personas from their real ones. Then again, as far as he could tell, both of them lived for their jobs.  He'd never seen Natasha wearing anything but tactical gear, and Clint had been away for months now. Maybe there was no separation after all, and they just didn't mind seeing the other one killing people.  Maybe they'd become numb to it.
Tony's nose wrinkled and the corners of his mouth twitched as he tried to repress a smile.  "Here, let me do that," he offered, reaching over to massage Steve's scalp. He examined Steve closely, not with lust so much as concern.  The nature of Steve's metabolism meant that he never remained ill or injured for long. Yemen had been so recent, yet both that and the two months preceding it had already been erased.  Steve didn't look thin or pale or a bit sick, and any and all injuries and scars had been erased. Except for the one.
He stood up and grabbed Steve, for a split second almost picking him up.  His bad shoulder, the right one, made a crack of protest. He winced, flexed it (another pop-crack), and grinned sheepishly down at Steve.  "Right. You're huge. ...c'mon. Kitchen."
, Steve," she was saying.  "I mean, I believe you're having these flashbacks... but not that they themselves are based in reality.  I'm sure they
Tony crossed the room to get another cup of coffee, but only filled it halfway.  He topped the rest off with vodka from the bar, then walked into the living room to tap DeSoto's shoulder.
It was still strange to him to ask Steve, this fresh, young-faced guy who was half his age, about his father, to remind himself that Steve was, chronologically, old enough to
Clint woke up to a strange blue light in their bedroom. It was 4 am. He groaned and sat up, rubbing at his eyes with the heels of his palms. He blinked slowly to see Natasha sat the desk against the wall, staring at the blue computer screen before her. She didn't look like she'd slept, her eyes almost watering.
"Basically do what you want?" repeated Tony.  "A man after my own heart.  I, too, have been known to do whatever I want.  You, for example."  He smiled down at Steve, running his fingers through the other's hair, rinsing him off.  "Do I have to call you
Natasha grabbed a small thumb drive from her pocket and plugged it into a tower next to the monitor; a moment later she was slipping it into her pocket, and she and Tony were both behind Steve, Natasha pointing a gun into the beta's back.  Tony's face plate was still on, the face of Iron Man fixed into place, expressionless.
Steve heard Tony talking but he didn't really register it. As soon as Tony pressed that magical spot he was out of it. He was gone. Steve trembled a little, his lips parted... but he didn't manage to actually speak. The longer Tony pressed down the wetter he got between the legs and the more his dick began to thicken against his thigh.  It was like being in heat but instantaneously, all the more powerful because of how sudden it was.
Steve sat with his knees drawn close to his chest. He looked almost child-like. Natasha was getting a smaller box out of the elaborate first aid on the wall. He swallowed. "So how do we do this?"
He curled his hands onto the side of the pool either side of Tony's hips and ducked down briefly before rising up, lifting up his entire body on his arms so they were face to face. Normally this  kind of position would make a man's arms at least tremble with the effort. But Steve's didn't. He looked comfortable, like he could just hold himself up like this hours. Water dripped down him and it gleamed in the sunlight. Their faces were close, closer than they had been since Steve returned, and the omega's blue eyes were dragging over Tony's face slowly.
Aria dragged Steve through the front doors while Pepper snagged Tony's sleeve; both were too agitated to focus properly on verbal instructions. Some scuffling could be heard from the kitchen the moment they entered the front door.
Karpov gave him another cigarette for giving the right response.  The rewards were already raining down.
"Try not to go insane?" Steve teased gently. He was careful with the collar, feeling bad for closing it over still-pink skin. Tony's neck was far less swollen but Steve didn't think that would last long.  His own collar didn't leave a mark on him, it being custom made and all. But no collar was ever made with hackles in mind. "And try not to let Frond bother you. She's creepy." He kissed Tony's cheek.
Tiberius offered him a small smile.  "I... I want to thank you. For... letting me be here for you two.  It means a lot to me. I know that my... my pheromones are... revolting.  Having your trust and everything is... it just means a lot, that's all. I'll never experience another heat or a bond but being asked to... help you two.  Well. It's nice. It's the closest I'll probably ever come. Thank you."
The women on the television were still talking but Tony couldn't hear their words.  Anger was coursing through his veins, white-hot, anger and something else; how dare anyone touch his omega; how dare anyone try to hurt him?  It wasn't just a sense of protectiveness.  No.  It was a memory, a memory of two years ago, Afghanistan.  At the end, it wasn't about escape.  It as about cold, raw vengeance.  Tony had had every intention of going out in a blaze of glory if necessary, laying waste to his captors, as if, once he killed them, he could regain what they had taken.
"Get out of here," he said quietly.  "Go kneel for someone else.  There's another Alpha upstairs.  Why stop at two when you could have three?  Hell, might as well treat us like Pokémon - try to catch us all."
Tony hesitated, then reached up and gently brushed the back of Steve's neck.  "Is this okay? If I touch it?" he said softly.
...a surprise?  Tony was an impatient person and disliked surprises.  He doubted he could be more surprised than he already was, though, after learning who Steve really way.  He threw back the aspirin Steve gave him, watching the other man leave.  "Uh, Steve?  You might wanna... you know, wear a scarf."  Tony pointed to his own neck, indicating where the bruise on Steve's was.
"I'm more of a waffle guy than a pancake guy, but sure.  If my omega made it for me," said Tony, reaching for the food.  He looked over at the desk.  "You were drawing me?" he asked through a mouthful of pancakes.  Tony didn't see the appeal of drawing him while he was sitting on the floor, sweating, arranging pieces of metal and banging out dents and welding joints together.  But he felt oddly flattered.
on instinct now. What did that even mean? Steve knew a lot about omega biology but nothing really beyond that. His sex ed back in the forties had been non-existent. Clint had joked about it being much easier for people to prevent pregnancies now...Nat was on, what was it called? The pill? Steve didn't really understand it. He hadn't thought he'd need to any time soon.
argue," he added, seeming rather proud of this.  "Him and Trickshot argued all the time, and look what happened.  He distanced the bond and sent Trickshot away and I bet Trickshot ended up somewhere real bad.  Don't tell me there weren't auctions in the forties." His voice softened. "I hope Trickshot found his brother.  But his brother was an omega, too, and he probably got sold off a long time ago. And everyone knows used-up horseshoes don't go nice places.  Us here, we're all the lucky ones." He hugged his knees and looked over at the bedroom door, and his lips quirked up in a smile. "You know the last three times I got betted off, the Alpha was too drunk to do anything?  It kinda all works out. That's what we gotta do, as horseshoes, just trust that it'll work out. And it does, usually, especially if you behave yourself."
Steve wasn't really a crier. He used to suck it up and bare it but he was feeling over emotional and shaky and Tony just said he...he wanted to...
"Are there other omegas here?" Steve asked, trying to sound much more confident than he felt. He felt
"A...a studio?" He echoed in disbelief and was so overwhelmed with emotion he didn't know how to feel. "I would love that," Steve whispered and felt gratitude swell up in his chest. "Seriously, Tony... wait a second.  Did you say The Scouts? Really? Didn't know they were into modern art."
SHIELD's records had been sparse.  In 2010, there had been waterboarding and unspecified torture, "physical and psychological." SHIELD's psychologists had easily diagnosed Tony with the usual gamut of disorders: narcissism, OCD-like tendencies, PTSD, anxiety, addiction.  But all of it was speculation and no one spent more than a paragraph on it because they just didn't know.  Realistically, Tony probably knew more about Steve than Steve knew about Tony; both were outrageously public figures, but Steve was guileless.  Tony's openness about himself was always tongue-in-cheek.
Oh lord. Pepper was going to kill him. And then bring him back to life. And then kill him again. Steve's throat went dry. This was a disaster. This was the worst it could have possibly gone. His phone buzzed in his pocket. It was Fury.
Tony felt a pang in his heart.  "...trust me, Pepper. It's worth it.  Please. Please? You're my accountant, you're my CFO, you're my golden girl... if anyone can free up ten million, it's you."
Steve was out of control, but he didn't care, he loved Steve's spark.  He'd always loved that. Steve was unlike any omega Bucky had ever known.
Tony said all this with a forced lightness that meant he'd obviously done his research but was hoping Steve wouldn't notice.
Tony shuddered when he felt Steve's teeth graze his neck.  He nuzzled his cheek, briefly, his cock throbbing inside of Steve.  "...yeah... yeah, my omega..." he murmured, breath catching. Hearing Steve beg for it... that was enough for him to come undone.
Tony snatched away the tablet to look at Pepper's itinerary and groaned.  "Lots of buddy-buddy photo ops.  Gross."
She didn't reply after that. Steve tucked the phone against his chest. They were his best friends and he missed them terribly. Maybe he could get Sam to meet him there too. Steve knew he was in DC though; he would need a lot of warning. But it would be nice to have something to look forward to after the fundraiser-public apology-press conference.
"...Miss Potts will see you out," he said, a bit stiffly, extending a hand to shake even though he hated shaking hands.
His brow furrowed.  He obediently tore off the silver paper.  There was a box of Lucky Strikes. He looked up.
Well, she certainly wasn't as brilliant as Tony, right?  She couldn't be. No. He was, supposedly, the world's third smartest man alive.  He had to be right. As his number of total encounters approached infinity, each individual encounter approached zero in terms of significance, negating any singular bad thing that had ever happened to him.
There was another rush of air behind them. Steve twisted around. "Who's there?!" He called out. "I know you're there!"
"Speaking of plates, where are the stuffed mushrooms?" asked Pepper, snagging one of the caterers.  Steve understood that meant the conversation was over.
Maria managed to convince Tony to come to the kitchen, but she couldn't get him settled.  He paced around aggressively, hackles up, hands flexing at his sides.
Steve could feel Tony nerves even though he wasn't show any. It was quite impressive, really. He certainly wasn't that good of an actor himself. He slipped forward, leaving Nat and Sam to talk about...something. Steve reached up to squeeze his shoulders briefly. "You've got this, okay?" he whispered, voice sincere as he tilted his head.
soldier positions. He'd also heard of some form of beserker rage that was apparently unique to omegas, but that was only mentioned in old myths and stories. There was no real mention of it now. "So you've met them before, the royal family?"
The doctor gently pried Banksy off him, guided him to a seat in the room, and sat him down.  "Mr. Banksy... we're doing everything we can. Mr. Mackabee is a fighter and considering how quickly you responded, he has the best shot of recovery.  However... I'm sorry to say that... at this time, his prognosis is not promising."
"Just please make it into bed by three Tony," Steve asked with a sigh, knowing it probably wouldn't happen.  The moment Wakanda had come up, he'd felt Tony's guilt in his gut. He stood and then leaned down to kiss Tony's cheek. Hopefully he'd finish the newest version of the suit soon; at least that would make him feel better.
Steve blinked awake with a yawn and stretched out against Tony like a cat. Seconds later an alarm went off. He quickly reached over and hit it off, smiling as Tony groaned beneath him in protest.
"Sorry," said Tony quickly, drawing his hand away.  He settled down at the table with his orange juice and looked out the back window.  Tony's home had lots of windows; it was a very airy place.
Tony paused in his frantic, squirrel-like collection to observe Steve.  He was an omega, yes, unmistakably an omega.  For Alphas and omegas, they could identify their orientations as easily as if it were their gender or age range.  But Steve was a uniquely powerful,
"Right," Steve said, finishing the last of his coffee. He just wished Tony would get dressed already and they could do. DeSoto was still freaking him out. He somehow managed to make Steve feel uncomfortable in his own skin. His and Tony's age difference wasn't weird, was it? Besides, it wasn't like he was still in his goddamn
By the time he was on the cusp of puberty, Tony had figured it out.  What his father wanted was a cardboard cut-out of a kid he could drag to press conferences to complete his perfect image.  He was a pilot and a patriot and an inventor and an entrepreneur and he didn't really have time for a kid in his life, but he needed one, so he could add family man to his list of accomplishments, and have someone to carry on his legacy.
"I already sent it over, remember? You just never check your emails." Steve's voice was quiet, growing distant. Maybe he was wrong- maybe he read it wrong. Maybe him kneeling for Tony didn't mean as much as he'd thought it had.  Tony was so sloppy drunk that Steve doubted he'd remember much of this conversation, or his suggestion that they might be scent-mates.
Abby shrugged. "Who knows?" And there was it. Her tone was casual, like she was talking about an old high school friend-- not a guy who'd been bought and then publicly bonded in front of everyone. Disgusting.
"Jeanette, get Stark a--"  From behind him, someone popped a bright red Santa hat on him.  Boswell heaved a sigh. "--I'm not wearing the hat."
"Not at all," Steve hummed. He curled his arm around Natasha's waist; she gripped his arm tightly. Steve stepped them up onto the stairwell's banister and then jumped, the rope's decent slow enough that Steve landed without any pain to his knees. Natasha pryed away from him then clicked a small button on the handle, calling the rope back.
The man in question was currently chatting with Clint at the other side of the room. Steve pulled back, his expression bemused as he raised a brow at him. "I don't know. You'll have to ask him yourself."
He crawled into bed with Steve and settled back against the pillows, sinking into the bed with a sigh of satisfaction.  "So.  Which are we doing first...  blowjob or
"Here," said Clint, pressing a cool cloth over Steve's neck.  He glanced over at the others, then back to Steve. No one, he remembered, had explained this stuff to Steve; Steve had grown up in the twenties.  "...that's actually how it feels. I mean... I mean, every time you're bitten there. It's just that, the first time, you go into the honeymoon phase and you're so full of hormones, you don't notice it.  Same with heats. It actually hurts like hell if it's..." He trailed off. Steve's heat had been induced, not natural, and now that the hormones had worn off, Steve's neck was no doubt in excruciating pain.  Omegas had described abnormal breaking of the gland to feel like acid. "It takes two or three days before it stops stinging," he added.
"Yes," Wendy said, appearing at his left and reaching for something with avocado in it. "Don't they force-feed them alcohol, or something? It's not very pretty."
of Steve riding him was getting him off.  He was infatuated and he knew it and he didn't care, because, like he'd said to Pepper, the feeling was so thrilling and intense and wonderful that it was worth every vulnerability.
"Remember... we're doing this for the omegas... for kids like Piper," said Tony firmly.  "...and also I'm getting a
Tony understood, though, Steve's paranoia of being seen as submissive.  Right now, he was a malleable little puddle of pleasured omega, squirming himself onto Tony's fingers, soft whimpers still falling from his lips.  Somewhere deep in his mind, he made a note to put up some more security measures around the house.  It wasn't only HYDRA who would probably love to discredit him; any tabloid in the world would cream their pants at an opportunity to see Steve like this, helpless in Tony's lap.
"You're going to be sick if I take you back down there," Steve said seriously. Drunk Tony was surprisingly passive.  Way more needy, and annoying. But less of the bullshit. "And you don't want all your guests to see you like this. You'll do something stupid, Tony, and then Pepper will kill me." He was only half joking. The surprise heat didn't put Steve in anyone's favour right now, really.
Steve let out a gasp as teeth sunk into his neck with warning, the pain piercingly pleasant. More marks meant even more of a claim, and even more pissed off Fury was just a bonus. Steve would do whatever- and whoever -he wanted and boy did he want Tony.
"Anyway, I promise tonight I won't do that.  Today's just for us, okay? Tomorrow is your big speech and so I wanna make sure today is relaxing.  ...how about I finish with this and you let me serve you? I can probably fry bacon without screwing it up."  (Tony had never fried bacon himself, but how hard could it be?) (He had once made a turkey using a microwave oven he built.  The microwave had been twenty-something kilowatts and had had no door, so he'd tested it in the garage. The turkey had taken about twenty minutes to cook before bursting into flames and Tony had also melted the paint off one of his dad's cars and shorted out half of the house's electronics.  It was one of few times that Aaliyah had actually hit him;
Tony was feeling calmer.  Here in the dark quiet of the backstage bathroom, where the only smells were cleaning products and his omega, where it was just them... yes.  He felt better.  His lip was throbbing painfully.
Tony squinted; he thought he saw Steve, the outline of him elbowing a man at the base of his neck.  The man dropped limply.
There was a pregnant pause on the other line.  "...I see. Well, Dr. Thompson, this does present another problem.  You see, our school only accepts unbonded girls, the goal, of course, being for them to be bonded when they graduate.  You understand that our clientele doesn't really... want omegas that are already marked."
"Mm-hm... well... might be worth freezing just in case.  He's the next best thing."  A pause.  "A partially detached optic nerve, some broken teeth.  I can have him back in ship-shape by morning, if you want."  Another pause.  "...I would waive my usual fee for some blood draws and behavioral testing.  He's really quite fascinating."  He reached over to pat the asset on the head.  He didn't react.
Maria whipped around; the camera crew, Gleason, Pepper, and Aria were all far too involved with Steve and Tony to notice anything amiss.  Yet.
Shit.  "Terminate learning algorithm six and re-calibrate your self-awareness, JARVIS.  I don't want you going sentient and trying to destroy the world."
They maneuvered through the press with well-practiced ease.  No one paid Steve any mind.  He handed Tony his smoothie once they were in the car.  He’d eaten about four bagels himself before they left.  It didn’t matter if some random kitchen staff noticed his super soldier appetite, but he tried to reflect at least semi-normal eating habits in front of Tony.  Tony looked almost nervous for someone who was just going to be watching a race.  The Monaco Grand Prix was supposed to be a relaxing bit of time off for him, but Tony seemed distracted and worried.  Steve frowned a little, then quickly composed himself, knowing Tony hated when people acted concerned for him.
"--you're welcome," said Piper, a bit loudly, and shot Tony a look of warning.  Tony blinked. Piper was clearly more clever than she let on. The card meant something.  Tony just didn't know what yet.
He only cracked an eye open when he smelled an omega passing by.  She was in post-heat and her scent was absolutely cloying. "Hey, can I get a drink?" asked Tony, snagging her.
"If the device is complete, then why are you stalling?  Are you afraid it won't work?  Turn it on, Mr. Stark."
"Hey," he said softly. "We don't have to talk. We can just lie here, if you want. You wanna do that?"
don't care about winning doesn't mean I don't either," she snapped, pacing around the table, checking all the different possibilities.
He had not even considered it.  That this was the season when Tony's parents had died, and when, much later in life, he'd spent a season in a cold, bleak mountain range in Afghanistan, having gotten into a car himself and proceeded to watch all of its occupants slaughtered in order to kidnap him.
fixed the damn reactor; this was his second chance and they were threatening it.  He wished both would just come out of the shadows so they could just get the inevitable confrontation over with.  He wondered if his and Steve's announcement might draw Bucky out.  How would it feel for an Alpha to watch his omega suddenly appear with another Alpha, looking happy?  If that didn't drag Bucky out from the shadows, nothing would.  Regardless of what had happened to him or how messed up his brain was, the bond between Alpha and omega was devastatingly strong.  Surely he'd recognize his omega, leap to defend his claim.
Tony huffed softly, an almost-laugh.  "It still tastes... real bad," he confirmed.  "But it's okay. I... I still have a few toothmarks I can line up to.  The upper canines and one of the lower ones. ...and it was easier because I... I wasn't surprised."
Outside, the sun was just starting to set over the horizon; the view out the west window was magnificent.  The ocean was peaceful and sparkling pinks, purples, and golds.
He tossed the cigarette to the ground and put it out with the toe of his shoe, suddenly aware he was gasping shallowly.
The collar looked nice on him.  Tony glanced into the mirror, examining it.  Yeah, it looked really nice. But it would have looked nice on a warthog; it was, after all, a one-of-a-kind, two-million-dollar choker.
Hal had brought lunch over for everyone in the form of sandwiches and they were practically having a picnic of sorts. The auctionees were all very chatty and asked Steve about just every aspect of his life. Then they turned to Hal. One asked her how she bonded her own Alpha.
"Steve, you answered your own question.  You can't save someone who doesn't want it.  You can only give them a chance. And you don't always save everyone.  You're not a comic book superhero, Steve... sometimes, people get left behind," said Tony quietly.  "But the point is to get through to as many of them as you can. And the ones who need it most are gonna be the hardest.  Guys like George? They didn't really need you, Steve. George left Luke when he had a chance and he did it by himself. It's the ones like Donner who actually need your help."  He rubbed Steve's back against the cool Pacific wind. Steve was shuddering a little, perhaps crying silently. Tony didn't ask; he just held him and left him work on getting ahold of himself.  They had time to spare, after all. It would be several hours before they knew what Donner was going to do.
"Steve?  ...can I... you mind if I climb into bed with you?" asked Tony tentatively.  Even though all evidence pointed to Steve not having been raped, the bite on the back of his neck might as well have been the same thing, and Tony didn't know how much contact Steve wanted right now.  Tony desperately wanted to hold him but he didn't feel like he had much right to demand cuddles after what he'd put Steve through. This was his fault, after all, pushing Steve away until he finally cracked.
Pepper was getting up and grabbing Steve's arm.  "We have to stop him, he can't-- oh my God, what the hell is he doing, Stan, come on--"
"--don't want to leave any marks.  That reflects more on you than him.  The omega is an extensive of yourself; you should treat them with the awareness that clear signs of abuse reflect that you aren't in control and discredit your own standing.  Jenny, come here. Let me demonstrate the--"
It had been years since he'd seen it, though.  He'd forgotten how violent the chainsaw scene was.  Steve was tense, pressing into his chest.
Banksy stood there for a moment, shocked, then squealed and threw himself at Boswell, wrapping his arms around him and giggling manically with unconstrained excitement.
It was mid-May and no one, except perhaps Pepper, had noticed that Tony wasn't excitedly talking about his birthday.  It would be his forty-first, but there was little planning or fanfare. Tony seemed far more interested in celebrating his and Steve's first anniversary together, which was a nice change of pace from his usual manic insistence on over-the-top parties.  Perhaps his last one had been a bit much, even for him.
stupid!" barked Donner suddenly.  "I-- I'm not stupid, I know I'm not, and I am so having a baby.  And-- and you can't--"
"...I bet myself," said Tony.  He looked over at Steve. "I brought my collar.  Because I knew they would all pressure me to bet on you.  So I bet myself instead. I thought it'd... make a point. And Gideon won me.  I was trying to get Donner away for just one goddamn night but I lost. ...you don't think I'm going to have to actually spend the night with Malick, right?"  Tony's tone was one of forced lightness, but in the cold, sober light of day, Tony was questioning the whole stunt. He had assumed Malick would have zero interest but suddenly he was wondering if Malick might swallow his pride and actually try to make Tony make good on his promise.  "I mean... I mean, Malick's a politician, he wouldn't... right? He wouldn't treat me like an omega. Right?" pressed Tony, seeking reassurance. He tried to force a smile. "--not that it matters, I made my point, right, and it wouldn't be the first time that--"
"I'm not goddamn anyone’s!" Steve  cried out but neither of them had been listening. Neither of them cared. Typical.  Fucking unbonded Alphas, in an Alpha pissing contest.
"Rogers," he whispered to the breeder, prodding him.  "...I..."  What?  What could he possibly say?  That he didn't even know his own name?  This was possibly normal, though, right?  He remembered hearing somewhere that sometimes soldiers got confused when they'd just come back.  Shell-shock, they called it.
She'd walked up to the door in this time, slim fingers curling around the edge. Annnnd yep, she was still naked. Brilliant. Steve didn't know where to look.  He settled for the ceiling.
She came running.  Tony had changed; it was a black-tie affair and he always kept a few tuxedos in the jet.
Tony blinked.  "...did you... did you used to go sledding on trash can lids?" he asked uncertainly.  Right when he thought he was going to get used to being bonded, it surprised him like this.  "Gross," he added. Trash can lids, fuckin' Edison, seriously?
. Steve and Tony were just tangled together, not speaking either. He was just grateful to hear his Alpha breathing properly, or at least, actually
He dropped the bags onto the couch and pulled them open to find his sketchbook.  It was unharmed.  Then he went searching for his phone, and found it  quickly. Fortunately it didn't look like any their stuff had been vandalised; the phone, like the sketchbook, appeared unaltered. He found texts from Clint from before his call with him on the plane (and a lot of other missed calls). Aria had forwarded him some articles and Sam had texted to check if everything was okay. Steve decided to call him, flopping down onto a couch as he did so.
"You mentioned collars?  What's your opinion on stuff like collars? I imagine it was very different back in the forties."
Dr. McCloud got that a lot.  There was no malice in Tony's voice, just surprise; it was an unusual position for an omega to hold.
Tony cracked one eye open.  "I am not a morning person," he growled.  He looked over Steve's bright, sweet face.  There was some peach fuzz on his jawline and upper lip.  Steve looked damned good in the morning, in a rugged sort of way.  "What's the point of having a day off if you wake up at six, anyway?"
Karpov told him not to be difficult and Steve wasn't. He was all too aware of the girl.  He would have to plan an escape later, when she wasn't there.
She was clearly stressed about this, had clearly thought about it a lot... Aria was almost shaking. She brought her cigarette to her lips and took another drag. "Tony's under a lot of pressure right now. A lot of mates don't like it when their O might be stealing the spotlight. They won't
"I'm going to swab inside your mouth first.  Then between your legs," said Phil, with his usual professional attitude.  Clint's hand was still resting lightly, gently, on Steve's bare leg. "I'm going to comb through your hair-- all of it-- and scrape under your fingernails.  We'll have the lab process it and we should be able to figure out... if anything happened." A pause.
He looked up; he was turned on again, wanted to fuck Steve again, but also liked Steve like this, filled up, stretched out impossibly with the--
The elevator took them to the basement and Tony led them through a series of unmarked hallways, deep into the heart of the building.  The floor was poured concrete and the bulbs were fluorescent.  There were no decorations here.  It was clear this space was not intended for much use.
He looked up just in time to see four people before something slammed into him, rattling his bones to the very core.
Tony stood up, pulling out his wallet and throwing down a few bills on the table without looking.  "Well, let's get it over with.  You're driving," he added.  He got a thrill from knowing that it was killing at least a few Alphas to see an omega driving a two-million-dollar supercar.
Phil watched Steve go.  He was unbonded and didn't fully understand what Steve must be going through right now.  But the misery was palpable. Even a beta could probably feel it.
Tony played with the model distractedly.  "This is the 1974 Expo," he informed them.  "I was four.  I didn't even see him that year at Christmas.  The Expos, they really suck up your free time.  If any of you guys get a chance-- I know you're real busy, you know, harassing dying men and all-- but if you get a chance, check out the one I'm putting on this year.  It's dynamite."
True to her word, the picture that accompanied the article had been touched up.  Steve was wearing a high-collared blue jacket on, his hair a bit of a mess, hands in his pockets, looking thoughtful and serious.  There was a second one that circulated of Steve looking over his shoulder, the bite mark on his neck visible.
"Tony..." Steve tilted his head up, breath ghosting over the edge of Tony's jaw. He shifted, moving to sit in Tony's lap.
Steve sighed, exasperated as Tony disappeared again. Oh well. He supposed if they had to, they could stop by the hospital on the way home... ER trips with Tony were a fairly common occurrence nowadays.
Steve was in running clothes, the faintest gleam of sweat on him.  Still looking magnificent, as always.
"I'm sorry," he said, feigning innocence. "I have no idea what you're talking about. And, how did you get this number?"
The sheets... weren't utterly ruined. Huh. Steve blinked in surprise and then realized that someone must have changed them. Oh God. How bad they been? No time to worry about that now.
."  Steve gave her a blank look and she sighed.  "They're a conservative magazine with a very large Alpha reader base.  And they've hinted before that Tony's an acer. The last thing we need is for them to get you to say anything that could be twisted... you
He went to room 3 and tried to shoulder it open.  Unlike Steve, he found it difficult. He gave it a few more kicks; Vim hesitantly helped him kick it, even though she was barefoot, looking cautiously hopeful that they were truly being rescued.  Vigor hung back, clearly not willing to cause any trouble.
Tony should have felt nervous about being paired with Steve for life in such a profound way but he wasn't.  There was no anxiety there.  He had been so desperate to mate Steve, he'd almost not even had a choice.
Dum Dum was an unbonded Alpha but he'd just strode over, picked Steve up like he was nothing, and carried him into a safe house.  A small cottage, abandoned over a year ago, the farm long-since ruined by war.  He'd barred up the door and sat outside with his gun the whole night. Steve knew he hadn't meant it in 'Alpha' way. He'd been protecting him, as a friend. And Bucky had stayed well clear of him, like he was afraid he might pounce on Steve if he got too close.  Steve remembered kinda wished he had at the time.
until July, it's going to be so fabulous-- oo, is that champagne?  Excuse me darlings, that glass has got my name on it!" He flitted away.
Kerry was scribbling again, her handwriting nearly illegible because of the pace of it.  She held up the clipboard.
Pepper gave him a sympathetic sort of look that made him feel like an idiot. Steve really should have known. But he didn't rummage in Tony's workshop, just like he didn't look through Steve's sketchbook.  He was tempted to go down there and try and find the damned stuff but he knew Tony could acquire more very easily if he wanted to.
Wanda looked sympathetic; she reached out and put a hand on his knee.  "Later, James. I need a nap. It's exhausting to be in someone else's mind and to control their thoughts.  But listen. The bond is there. Someday you'll be able to do it yourself, if you try hard enough."
Tony ignored him, intent on the game.  The only part of him that moved was his hands, hitting buttons on the controller, toggling the joysticks.
relationship looks like!  ....come on, beefcake.  Obviously, your blood sugar is low.  Let's get you a sandwich," said Tony gently, threading their hands together.  "...wait 'til you see the information packs I got on these conversion therapy camps, Steve.  It's not just cutting out the gland, they do other stuff, too... trying to implant hackles and artificial knots and stuff... it was insane.  Dumping Alpha pheromones into them, electroshock, forcing them to mate other omegas, you wouldn't
"But Stark isn't, is he? The age difference is quite significant, isn't it," Pierce commented harmlessly. "Whichever way you go."
With Rumlow's coat over his shoulders and Rumlow stroking his hair and handing him water, Steve was being overwhelmingly smothered by Rumlow.  The other Alphas in the car were not as dominant, and Rumlow seemed to be in charge. His touches were not sexual in the slightest; it was the sort of petting an adult might give to a weeping child.  On one hand, the patronizing was insulting. On the other, admittedly, Steve was throwing a bit of a tantrum. Then again, he had every right to, considering he was blind and in a moving car with a bunch of Alpha strangers who were taking him to an undisclosed location.
He was trying not to think over what had just happened but it was inevitable.  He and Steve were bonded, but he was still embarrassed and disgusted by everything Steve had just seen.  His father, drinking at 9 am, and the omega he'd grown up with, never meeting his eyes, calling him "sir," being casually bossed around by the family.  In a way, almost, that was worse.  Steve knew he'd been a POW, knew he'd spent three months in a cave, and could probably guess at everything that had happened to him there.  But Tony had never communicated all the minutiae, and it was that that bothered him.  He'd never shared Yinsen with anyone.  It just felt too personal.
"Nate," said Nate while Steve stalked around the room searching like there were closets full of mutilated omegas just waiting to be discovered.
," snapped Pepper.  She checked her watch.  "We've been here less than an hour!"  She and Aria both went to fix Steve's tie at the same time.  Tony slumped in the doorway, the bass pounding behind him in the main room.
He watched Tony take a sip of beer and sighed fondly. "You, lay off the drinking? That would be nice..."
"I love you ," Steve whispered to Tony, eyes moving from the pin to Tony's face, and something warmed in his chest. He exhaled. He could do this. He had fought Nazis in the war. This was a piece of cake.
, and everyone knows male omegas can't impregnate female Alphas.  How in the hell are you forty and you don't know this?"
Tony had felt acutely offended by the mere suggestion.  "...no.  I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.  I mean-- I doubt it.  My old man wasn't like that."
It was grounding, calming; Steve slumped against hat he figured was a leg, eyes tracking the lines of Tony's face. Familiar and strong, the sharpness of his eyes piercing into Steve in that moment. Steve let out a ragged breath, his chest shuddering with every rise and fall.
"JARVIS!" yelled Tony, cramming on the helmet and turning on the HUD display before the suit was even on.  Thank God he'd left all the gantry equipment here from his drop-in a few weeks ago.  Thank God every one of them had an uplink and could communicate with each other.  Thank God he had JARVIS.
"I thought..." Steve looked back at the alpha and frowned in confusion. "You were bleeding. What's happened to your chest? I don't understand. You...you were bleeding..." There had been wires and red everywhere. It reminded Steve of a battlefield wound. It was grimy and gory and now apparently the Alpha was fine? And where had the beta male gone?
"Oh, I see..." Steve hummed, feigning seriousness. His blue eyes were bright with mischief, something swimming beneath the surface. He was never usually his confident, not in a sexual sense anyway. But the endorphins from his final sprint were still pulsing through his system. He rested his hands either side of Tony's hips on the desk, not glancing down at his arousal almost pointedly.
Tony laughed, crossing his arms and letting Steve take his donut.  "I know, I know, I... I just... every time another Alpha looks at you, I want to tear their head off.  You're a good-looking guy, Rogers.  I like your smell.  I don't know.  I know you're rocking the whole strong, independent omega thing.  I respect that.  You just get me all hot and bothered."  He gave Steve a grin.  "Welp.  Now that you've figured out I'm dying, you can, you know, buzz off.  I probably won't need you pretty soon.  But it was good meeting you.  You're... a damned strong omega.  Power to you."
"F-forced bonding is the worst thing in the world," managed Tony.  His mind was still back there and suddenly George's jokes about Luke being bad in bed, about letting someone bite the back of his neck, weren't funny.
He took about an hour to huddle up in the corner of a roof next to an air conditioner, shivering even though he wasn't cold.
did they get you drunk?" Aria demanded as she pushed Steve into a bathroom. She moved to get him a glass of water after shoving him down on the edge of the bath. "Drink this."
His grip loosened.  "что такое Bucky?" he demanded.  Curiosity had flooded him.  Who the hell was this guy, anyway?  This guy with a weird smell... an omega who fought back, who punched hard and stabbed him and then tried to order him around... this guy who said words like "Bucky."  His heart was pounding.  Even the fear of punishment and reprimand, of disappointing Karpov, of a re-training session... even all that couldn't stop him from asking.  That word carried
"Hey there," he breathed, laughing gently when Tony cracked open an eye to glare at him. Steve leaned down to kiss him and then nudged their noses together gently. It was so easy being domestic like this, being happy...it was easy to forget about HYDRA and Bucky and everything they'd done and wanted to do. It was easy to forget about SHIELD. This was just
Tony hummed in agreement and interest.  He was a fan of Bacardi. "So China's the heir to the Bacardi fortune?"
"Cooper's very into dinosaurs right now," explained Laura.  "I made the mistake of letting him watch Jurassic Park and now he's obsessed."
But he also decided it was probably best not to make any comments immediately.  He didn't want to undermine what Steve was doing, and besides, he had to be on his best behavior for SHIELD.
Steve looked at the offered hand and almost looked like he might take it until Tony mentioned Pepper and then he drew his hand back into his lap with a swallow. His face was blank, hard to read. He still looked tired which was uncharacteristic of Steve in the first place. Not eating for four days straight had hit him harder than anything else had.
"Your sense of humour really is quite something," Steve sighed softly, relaxing now Tony was still and not trying to pull out. He pulled a hand back to run through Tony's hair, moving it out of his eyes. His Alpha looked so forlorn- wait.
A week, right. Okay." Steve murmured and stared down at the floor. A week and then the connection with Bucky, however weak, would be gone. He felt both awful and relieved about it. SHIELD wouldn't trust him with the Winter Soldier bonded to him, would they? This could ruin everything.
With some difficulty, they made it into the door and into the corridor. Tony initially tried to resist Steve's help, but Steve was having none of it; every time Tony tried to push off him, Steve grabbed his arm.  It probably looked ridiculous.
"Education's safe," agreed Happy.  He slowed the car as they passed through a security gate; past a chain-link fence, Steve spied Tony's private jet sitting on the tarmac outside a hangar.  It was hard to miss; STARK was emblazoned across the side, bold and unapologetic, much like Tony himself.
But that wasn't what Tony was saying. He was saying Steve was...he shivered when his Alpha ran a foot up his leg, blue eyes darkening a fraction.
"Alright, is that it?  Any more questions? Usually there's more question... then again, I generally teach twenty-year-olds... alright, well, that's all I have for you!  If you want to speak with me in private about any concerns I'm happy to talk to you, but disclaimer: I'm a doctor and my hourly rate is
"It was," said Fury.  His voice was surprisingly gentle without any of its usual anger.  "Give Steve one of your guns.  Rogers, when we stop, you get on that train and you don't look back.  Head to the airport, get a plane ticket, and get the hell out of here.  Understand?  You
"He was going to mate me," Steve said like it was the simplest thing in the world, his voice terrifyingly calm. "So then I killed him."
"--I h-hope I feeling better-- better by the time-- time Gideon gets here," he said into the bowl.  "---I shouldn't have had-- had that cake."
"If I hadn't been allowed in the army then history might have played out differently," Steve pointed out coolly. He didn't usually blow his own trumpet. But Steve had potentially saved a lot of people but from a lot of bad things happening to them. Who knew what would have happened if Schmidt was allowed to carried on? Would someone else have stopped him?
Tony chanted inside his head.  He refused to let himself get swept up in emotion.  But he also didn't move his hands.  He held Steve's cheek; Steve held his other hand; they were perfectly frozen in time.  It was that moment in the basement, all over again.  But this time, no Clint to break them apart.  No Phil to get a phone call from New Mexico.  No Natasha to smirk and tease and make Tony feel defensive.
Tony and the other man rolled. Steve didn't know how Tony was doing inside the suit but the HYDRA agent didn't look great. There was blood, but not much of it. The man wasn't dead; Steve could hear him groaning.
He wondered when he should shoot himself.  It was getting bad.  Not unbearable, yet.  But he didn't think he had much time left.
"...I think I'll just asked my agent," Steve said with a soft chuckle, still unclear on who Ellen, Taylor, Cher, and others were. And then his expression softened. "But that stuff's all in the future. You have me all to yourself for the week," he assured him. He didn't voice it, but the thought of going on TV? That was scary. There was nowhere to hide.
When Tony was ready Steve gently eased them down in bed, throwing the towel away as it wasn't needed anymore. He dragged the duvet over them and placed a hand on Tony's chest so he would know he was there.
"Off," demanded Tony, playing with Steve's waistband.  He leaned forward to nose Steve's ear, run another hand down the back of his head, feel his soft blond hair.  A few brief, loving strokes; then he grabbed Steve's shirt and tugged it up, gently pulling it over his head.  His body might as well have been made of gold.  It was so utterly different than what Tony had always been led to think of as "omega."  There was nothing soft or feminine or weak about it.  It was a soldier's body, toned and taut and conditioned to perfection.
He held the door open for her so she didn't have to fiddle around with all the reports under her arms. She thanked him and slipped out. Steve wasn't sure but he was pretty certain he spotted Happy waiting out in the driveway behind the wheel. He smiled subtly and let the door slip shut.
"ENTER!" barked Tony.  He was actually fairly used to commandeering household staff to cater to his needs.
"I'll call in some of our bond experts in Bern about this," one of the techs offered a moment later. "Obviously, we don't know the extent that this can be manipulated. Safe-guarding against it, however, might be impossible."
"It's math, Pepper.  In a ratio of two numbers, as one number approaches infinity, the other functionally becomes zero."
Then Steve told him to stop.  He pulled into the first spot on the curb he could; Steve got out, and Bucky's heart dropped.  Was he leaving? Had Bucky done something wrong?
He yanked open the door of the car and leaned out to gag.  "Oh, fuck me... Maxwell's Equations, that hurts..." he gasped, spitting onto the pavement of the parking lot.  "S-sorry... I g-guess I'm still... getting over..."  He gagged again.  The headache that had flared up so suddenly was already ebbing, leaving Tony feeling worn out and shaky.  "...no one told me I'd have hangover flashbacks," he joked weakly, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes.  "What was I saying?  Right.  We're in this together."
. He might sometimes be an idiot, and I certainly am, but he respects me. And that counts a hell of a lot more than dominance.  Whatever that even really means..."
"Ha!" he said.  His triumph was short-lived.  His sleeve was on fire.  He slapped at it.  "Euler's ghost, the fuck," he said.  His whole world had become a narrow, surreal fight for survival.  In front of him, the damned man was still, somehow, alive, grinning, walking toward him, his skin shiny with burns and abrasions, and Tony was crouched, staring at him, wondering what the hell he was supposed to do next, because so far, he'd been lucky, but unless something changed, and fast, Tony was pretty sure he was going to lose this fight.  He stared, wide-eyed, still not ready to stop.  It wasn't his nature.  Tony had always been a fighter, a stubborn ass who didn't know when to quit.  The cables crackled ominously, dangling from the man's hands; the two of them made eye contact, but neither spoke.  What was there to say?  Their lives had both been distilled to this single, simple moment of survival.  They were nothing more than mortals, animals, fighting.  Tony didn't know why.  Didn't care, either.  He just didn't want to die.
"...what are your plans for the future?  With regard to your career, and your relationships?" asked Dr. Brennan
"I would rather die," Steve said flatly and the smile fell from his face. Malick didn't look like he believed him. Steve leaned forward. "I am not Captain America
"I think that's a brilliant idea Steve," Tiberius told him. "Here, I brought you two some snacks. Make sure you eat. That's a lot of medication. I'll, ah... leave you two to it.  "I'll see you in an hour."
A gun that Carter and the other agent were fighting over went on and a bulb above their heads shattered.
"Donner said he got a place in lawschool, but didn't go because of Gideon," Steve murmured, looking sad for it. He thought of all the omega lawyers he'd spoken to in New York, how feisty and fiery they were. Maybe Donner could have been one of them, maybe Steve would have met with him if... if Gideon hadn't come along.
"If it makes you feel any better, Steve, they've had the recipe for the serum since the eighties," said Phil calmly.  "...they'd never been able to activate it correctly, though. Most of their soldiers turned feral, based on our intelligence, and were disposed of.  ...I doubt they'll be able to use your blood to learn anything they don't already know."
"They also said they were sending in a psychologist tomorrow," Sam added quietly. "You know, they're...worried about you."
He had a very vague idea that they had been bonded and then gone to war and the bond had gone away and Steve had been absolutely furious with him, but...
"I'm... I'm just gonna drink some coffee and go back to sleep.  Do you have aspirin?  I need about... ten, twelve aspirins."  He reached for the mug and sipped the dark, bitter liquid, examining Steve over the rim of the cup.  Steve's style had changed slightly.  Tony didn't dislike it.  In fact, he liked this new, more confident, more assertive Steve.  Steve was, hands-down, the most self-assured omega he'd ever met.  It was disappointing to know he'd have to find a new PA.  But he and Steve had something better now.  They were friends.  Steve wasn't on his payroll, and he was still bringing him breakfast.  Taking care of him when he was drunk.  That's what friends did.  Tony felt a swell of affection for Steve.
"--land the plane, I wanna get out, I'm serious, let's go crazy, let's go to Paris, let's go to Oslo, I just... I need a break, come on, Pepper, you and me, it'll be a blast," insisted Tony, looking a little more wild than usual.
Outside, the sunshine was bright and brittle, and the mountains were covered in a heavy blanket of snow that glistened like diamonds.  Tony had been at the lodge for the last week, unplugged, which was unusual for him. Not unusual for him was wandering around in a pair of MIT sweatpants and drinking liquor straight from the bottle, listening to Excision instead of Pepper.
"But it doesn't make it easier to live with," Irshad pointed out softly. Her drink looked sweet, some kind of fruit juice concoction that was littered with pomegranate seeds on top. She changed the subject smoothly. "I was impressed with your interviews, by the way, especially considering you only just woke up here. And, for the record, my mother always told me you were an O."
There was a man in a suit, a man in a uniform, and three people wearing white lab coats.  They all stared at Steve with interest.  Steve stared back unwaveringly.
was why Tony was such a lousy Alpha, because his role model wasn't even an Alpha at all, just one of Dad's little jokes.
" he barked.  He couldn't even remember what he was saying no to, only that they wanted something and he didn't want to give it to them.  Tony had made himself into an impenetrable tomb where he’d buried his thoughts, and he was using his own flesh to protect them.
"My baby," said Donner in a hushed, awed tone, clearly delighted with the tiny infant nestled in his arms.
Karpov sighed a little.  "It's time for me to go, soldier.  I'm retiring. Better for me to disappear than to have HYDRA make me disappear.  Geniuses are rarely appreciated in their own time. The world wasn't ready for Guiding Star.  They'd rather fight their wars with muscles, not brains. There is no place for me here now. Perhaps someday HYDRA will be better equipped to make use of my research.  I still believe in its principles. But the fools running it right now... they would dispose of me like yesterday's newspaper. So, soldier, it is time for us to say good-bye and perhaps, someday, we will meet again.  It was an honor to work with you. You have been an excellent asset."
Steve watched her pull out her phone. "He's not doing this for Fury's benefit," he said quietly and Natasha looked up at him. Her gaze lingered a second too long, like she was trying to make a point.
He slipped out a back door and leaned his back against the stone wall of the building, already warmed by the sun.  Behind the school was a small playground and a couple of large, old trees. There was a single low, stone building off to one side, probably a shed or something, and beyond the well-cared for lawn was an old, mossy-looking wood.
Steve opened the program. "The auction isn't until tomorrow night, least there's that... but there's dinners tonight. I'm not gonna be put on some omega table, am I? I might die from boredom. It's like they don't even have
The lights flickered as JARVIS rerouted the all of the house's generator power to the collider, and Tony remembered, suddenly, long ago, his father talking about creating Captain America.  They'd been in his study.  Tony wasn't allowed there, technically.  But sometimes, if Howard had had a few drinks and was in a good mood, he'd let Tony sit there and talk happily about the past.  Before the age of eight or so, Tony had sought out these rare meetings, eager to bond with his father.  He would listen, enraptured, remaining silent and nodding gravely, excited for the special privilege of being in Howard's study, an honor that only a few other men had, like Stane and Jarvis.
Thumps weren't uncommon from Steve and Tony's bedroom, but some sense of intuition told Tiberius that this wasn't a regular thump.
"Great!" said Tony with delight.  He was walking a motorcycle across the floor; he threw out the kickstand and began stacking books on it.  "Lift that pipe up here, all of these pipes have fittings, uh, metal clamps, those need screwed on, there's grommets that fit between them, but don't tug any wires, there's two smaller pipelines--"  Tony was talking rapidly, wrenching a bolt onto a L-pipe.  The notes JARVIS was maintaining for him had grown as messy as the desk; projections of diagrams floating around the room like fish swimming lazily.  It was a bit like being inside Tony's head.
"Yes'm," mumbled Donner.  Lots of the Alphas he'd met over the last week seemed to enjoy having him disobey and then punishing him for it... living out a weird Steve Rogers fantasy, he guessed.  It was a strange paradox, getting ordered to disobey, to say no, to be bad. It wasn't in Donner's nature to do those things.
Steve settled into his seat opposite Tony and resisted the childish urge to put his shoes up on the table just because he could. "Since when were supposedly dead war heroes still 'crushes' in the 21st century?"
Steve decided on black jeans and a white shirt for underneath. He was kind of sick of wearing dress pants all the time and besides...he was aware that he looked
Steve moved to dry his hair, then the rest of himself before pulling on comfortable clothes as he spoke. "How's Clint doing?"
"Can I leave you two lovebirds alone now?  Can you go a day without having some sort of over-dramatic mental collapse?"
The man swung but hit nothing but air; Pietro had already moved.  He swung a second time; Pietro had already moved again. He caught the man's ankle with his foot and dropped him, then, lightning-fast, got in three sharp jabs on his face.
"HOLD ON!" barked a familiar voice.  Tony barreled in, dragging the woman in the pink dress behind him, giggling.  "Are you guys mixing drinks without me? Oh, hell no, no no, move aside, move aside, let me show you a thing or two-- oh, hi, Steve!  This is Ji-Yoo, an ex of mine."
"Kerry is a woman," replied Angela, who had also wandered over.  "He's expecting Richard Emmett. We need a male Alpha to go and he's got to be unbonded."
Tony hadn't ever had one of those but he wasn't going to admit that now.  He felt Steve's body tense a little and assumed that meant the doctor was up in there.  Gross.
Tony knew when he was out-numbered.  In retrospect, he should have left the present upstairs, but he hadn't been thinking.  He had wrapped it himself in his shop and Pepper must have found it and placed it with all the others.
The pub Tony had chosen, King's Stores, turned out to be the most remarkably old-school pub in the world.  The windows were all closed against the cold, but it was still lively, with the bottom half painted black and the top part brick.  The floors were wooden and so was the furniture. Tony looked pleased with himself for accidentally selecting a good-looking pub. (He had made the cab driver drop them off at the entrance of Frying Pan Alley, where Tony had taken several selfies with the street sign, prompting one annoyed passerby to mumble, "Bloody tourists.")
"C'mere," demanded Tony, holding his arms out affectionately.  "I'm out of bed, give me a reward. Let me kiss my boy. Then I'll put on your Christmas vest."
"No," he said with surprise.  "Of course I'm not mad.  We're pals... aren't we?"  He looked over Captain Rogers.  There was a weird disconnect between his smell and his appearance.  He looked like an Alpha; he was tall and muscular, with a strong jaw and straight back.  But his smell was omega, and it made Buck feel a powerful tug toward him.  He liked Captain Rogers a lot.  He'd never smelled an omega whose scent gave him such a warm, familiar,
' is passed out drunk. So we can either sit here and awkwardly make small talk into the small hours of the morning, or we can spar. Besides, our relationship is like that. We don't trade partners for sport. God knows why you all think this is normal."
Tony flipped his head back again with a groan.  Steve sank down and Tony shuddered with delight as the omega sucked him off, slow and sweet, his tongue tracing familiar skin, never giving Tony too much.
"Never mind. Listen, Rhodey- watch where you're pointing that thing-" said Tony, spying an anti-personnel gun mounted on Rhodey's shoulder.  Hammer Industries.  Ugh.  Seeing the H.I. logo on
"A white tulip bouquet connotes an apology or symbolizes forgiveness.  Shall I send one to Miss Potts?"
"...there were status riots in the sixties," explained Tony briefly.  "People were really pissed about omegas voting and going to college and stuff.  That was right after suppressants started really taking off and you could just grab them at the pharmacy.  ...but my point is, Steve, this is, you know, it's 2010, okay?  People are just upset because you're pointing out we still have a way to go and everyone would rather just, you know... people aren't great at changing, that's all.  But you're not going to fuck up.  And if you do, whatever, I'll fuck up with you, it'll be a big fucking mess, but we'll still have each other.  So don't sweat it."
He set a slow, steady rhythm with his hips, rocking into him with a contented sigh.  It felt amazing, easy and slick, minimal friction, the pressure from Steve's body driving Tony wild.
"Steve," said Tony, his mouth still full of Steve's flesh.  He glanced up at Steve and, almost begrudgingly, he stopped biting Steve's shoulder.  "Steve," he repeated with uncharacteristic seriousness, his hands running hypnotically down Steve's arms.  "I want to mate you now."
"Hi, folks, sorry I'm so late.  I'm Doctor Richard McDermott, but you can just call me Richard if you like."
just... I'll be ready to go again in thirty or forty minutes, okay?"  Tony didn't want Steve to think he was losing his edge.
But he wasn't about to tell them he was a virgin, either.  He'd been at college for a year now.  How sad would it be if he admitted he'd only really made one friend and the only social life he had revolved around getting drunk and doing graduate students' homework for them?  No, he was already dedicated to this lie.  He shot "Nick" a warning look.  If "Nick" didn't want to get arrested, he'd better play along.  Tony was interested to know how he'd gotten past their home security system, anyway; he'd spent half the week rewiring it for fun and it should have been impenetrable.  Clearly, something had gone wrong, if this tweaked out little weirdo had gotten into his room undetected.
She laughed suddenly.  For a split second, she wasn't scary; she looked like a typical teenage girl.  "You are the only person in my whole life who's ever said I was normal," she said, smiling at him, and he smiled back, and the two of them leaned in to each other's shoulders and somehow fell asleep on the rough wooden benches in the back of the truck.
Steve let Tony lead, even though he was shorter.  He knew the way; Steve was already lost in the crowd.  His Alpha's hand was a hot claim on his waist through the thin fabric of his shirt. It made Steve shiver. Tony guided him through the crowds and it was a relief to be with someone who knew what they were doing.
He ended up sat on a sofa, legs tucked up and boots discarded on the floor. He chewed on the fourth piece of pizza slowly, actually tasting it this time.
"I can... I can see glass?" Steve's eyes fluttered open and he frowned. He reached out, as if he was touching something, but his fingers met nothing but air. "It's steaming up." Then he almost smiled before he was back to frowning again.  His gaze shot up as Tony's fingers brushed against his cheek. Steve's gaze didn't focus on Tony's face but instead hovered over it. "You left me here. It's cold here." He clutched Tony's hand tight. Steve's voice broke a little. "I don't want to be alone anymore."
Steve stepped inside wordlessly and closed the door behind himself before leaning his back against it. "So," he sighed. "What is this about?"
"Unit 17, I've got a couple of hooligans over here on Ocean Front and Navy, and there's a beat-up guy with a metal arm--"
Nate let out an undignified sound when Steve picked him up. "Tony? Can you tell medical we're on our way?"
Tony closed his eyes and nuzzled into Steve's throat lovingly; he heard Pepper and Rhodey retreat, leaving the two of them alone, and Tony made a small mental note to thank them later for being there for him, even when, lately, he'd been a fairly huge ass to them.  (Although, he defended himself, he
"I love you," he mumbled.  He said those words a lot less than Steve did.  They felt foreign in his mouth. But he said them now because he meant them; he felt high from the post-heat rush of hormones.  He kissed Steve's nose again.
Tony would have given anything in the world for Steve not to be there.  He didn't dare more, worried that doing so would break the fragile dam that was holding back a deluge of emotions.
Tony, of course, growing up in the seventies and eighties in the upper crust of society, had never really been aware of such things.  Omegas were all well-behaved in his neighborhood. No one would keep an omega that wasn't, after all. The omegas were pleasant and servile and Tony had never seen anyone have to raise a hand to one, at least not in public.  In the country club, the omegas floated around with a pleasant sort of desperation to please, and Tony couldn't think of a fault with a single one of them.
"Actually, I might, lemme check..."  Eric began rooting through his pockets.  Onstage, Gail was giving a lengthy intro.  Tony pretended to seem interested because he didn't want to seem desperate.  Yet behind his sunglasses, he was watching anxiously. He didn't feel like Eric was checking too hard, frankly.  Eric had a stack of cards (of course he did, damned collar-maker and all).
.  For one thing, it was locked and there was no chance of bumping into household staff there, unlike the rest of the mansion.  For another, he'd decorated it mostly by himself. Whereas the rest of the house was all minimalist design and modern art, the garage boasted a bunch of pop art posters and a neon beer sign and all the trappings of a place that was truly lived in and personalized.  Tony flicked on a Van Halen song and sat down in the middle of the floor, among the scattered notes on the floor, and picked up a few pieces of loose paper, examining them.  Notes on nitramene.  A faded photo fell out.  Four people standing on a pier, a lighthouse in the background.  Cape Cod?  Tony's father and mother were smiling at the camera; Ana and Jarvis were there, too.  Tony's mother was noticeably pregnant.  Tony examined it for a moment.  His father and Jarvis were shoulder to shoulder, but Tony's father's arm was around his mother.
"They're always furious," Steve mumbled, laughing easily as their legs tangled together. He was distantly aware of Tony's erection pressed against his thigh but his attention was snapped away by the drag of Tony's teeth against his skin. He shivered, feeling much more awake than he had before. "Tony..."
Steve didn't recognize the Alphas either side of Gideon, but both of them were pretty similar to him; stretching middle aged, in slightly too-tight suits and not the best in the looks department. Did Gideon have a mate, he wondered? Steve struggled to imagine someone who wasn't having a miserable time of it.
"It's not about needing something," Steve mumbled with a smile. He let his eyes slip shut, savouring Tony's touch. "But no, it's not another orchid. Although that would have been funny.  I wish I'd thought of that," he hummed and ran a hand down Tony's bicep absentmindedly. "Would have been hard to wrap anyway, I guess..."
Tony wanted to lie down and cry, but he literally couldn't remember how.  He never cried.  Never broke his carefully maintained mask of control.  And so instead of having a meltdown, instead of screaming, demanding to know how Steve could do this to him, lie to him, Tony did what Tony did best.
Steve was shaking. Maybe in fear or awe. He wasn't sure. Slowly, the soldier raised his human hand and pressed it against Steve's on the other side of the glass.
omega."  He got a bit of a glassy look.  "Although I do think Stephanie would be a nice name, if it were a girl.  Gideon Jr. if it's a boy."
He got up to let Pepper know he was headed out.  He flung open the bedroom door; Pepper, Phil, and Steve all looked up guiltily.
"I'm not tired!" yelled Tony.  "And also, stop talking about me like I'm not here!  Hey! Since there's three of us we should--"
As long as she didn't watch the simulation.  Tony was already preparing himself for the worst.  He couldn't know, not really, what "the worst" was.  Afghanistan?  Stane?  Something from his childhood?  ...all three?  There were plenty of things he'd never told Steve, things he no longer admitted to himself.  Tony's method for coping was to cram everything away and never examine it again.  Now they were dragging it all out and... well, who knows, maybe it wouldn't be that bad.
put him there. We have to do something to get him out. Please, Rhodey. We'll owe you one. A huge one."
Steve went for a third doughnut. Runs made him too hungry for words. "Sometimes I wish I could just make a phone call and have Gideon suspiciously end up in a ditch somewhere..."
Tony was trying to find a way not to let this bother him.  But of course it bothered him.  This was one of the things he'd been most afraid of- another Alpha, encroaching on his territory.  Even though he desperately wanted to follow Steve's advice, say
"Stone, you help me carry Steve.  Aria and Gleason, take Tony." (The two were both flopped on the couch limply, happily riding the effects of Gleason's sedative.)  "Virginia, I assume you know the code... get us into the basement."
No time to cry over spilled milk.  Tony continued to yank on the wrench, every muscle straining; the beam hit the support plate for the arc reactor and for a moment Tony worried it would cut through that, too, but it only etched the surface of the stand.  (Tony had been using an adamantium alloy.  Thank Tesla.  Most metals would have warped hopelessly under the heat.)
But before Steve could finish his sentence his phone started ringing. He pulled it out to see it was Fury.
"Your accent is nice," Steve told him. He probably would have said that even if it was shit though. Everything Tony did just endeared Steve to him further. His voice was velvet, a low rumble. Steve could see how Tony ended up with so many bedmates throughout his life. Right now it felt like he would do anything the Alpha asked of him, as simple as ever.
Was this intimacy?  To Tony, sex had always been a contact sport, not something people who were in love did.  Granted, it was a contact sport played with attractive women, but it was nonetheless more of an
"No, no!" Steve was wide-eyed, his hands in front of him. "It didn't bother me at all. I meant that I came to see what it was because the smell was very good."
With a crash and a flashlight, the four heads fell. Thor and Steve landed next and Tony realized that they had done their "Vibranium Hammer" move when Thor simply hit Steve's shield with an extremely strong bolt of lightning and everything around was destroyed by impact. Fast and efficient.
“Come on, Tony, ask the questions you want to ask,” Steve said with a half-smile. “I told you, I didn’t ask you here to fight. I want to talk.”
On the underside Clint, Natasha and Steve were no better. Natasha's widow bites didn’t even tickle the hydra's legs, the ropes Clint threw trying to catch them weren’t enough and Steve could do no more than irritate the monster by hitting his shield at pivot points.
So this sixth chapter is just a breath until what we're all waiting for (yes, I know you guys are as eager for their weekend as I am!)
Tony blinked a few times to see clearly again and found himself clutching Steve's shoulders like he was his lifesaver. Tony paused to catch his breath and thought better of it.
"Damn," he said when he realized that none of the missiles had penetrated the monster's thick skin. “Plan B.”
Tony thought, because he was already one step away from having an extremely embarrassing boner there, right in the middle of a meeting of the Avengers with Nick Fury.
The quinjet landed in the Avengers Tower hangar a few hours after leaving the A.I.M. base in Alaska, and despite the Hulk's angry grunts toward Hawkeye because of the lost pickles, it was a silent trip with Steve and Natasha piloting and the others sitting around the holographic table.
Steve didn't respond immediately. He thought about it, and Natasha waited, still smiling without showing her teeth. A snake ready to strike was the image that came to Tony's mind.
“I was just kidding, silly.” Steve kissed the top of Tony's head. “Yes, I promised you a shower, and we’re going to take that shower, don’t worry. But can we finish our coffees first?” Steve pouted.
“Hulk, a passage through the ceiling, please,” Tony asked and with a roar, Hulk flew past him toward the ceiling, making his way to the base exit.
Passing behind Vision, Natasha positioned herself between the android and the God of Thunder, which, as far as Natasha could see, not without surprise, would have his amount of scratches and bruises. That was really impressive.
“Just you and me,” Steve agreed and refocused on his task of getting rid of Tony’s pants, unzipping the button and zipper and carefully pulling the pants down. He wanted Steve.
