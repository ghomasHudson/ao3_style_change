He tried not to flinch.
“Four hundred thousand remain ready to come online. But sir…there was talk of a clean. What is protocol if the backpack is to be thrown away?”
Steve stood and they headed out the door. “Overwatch, are they using the entrance we came in? West side?”
“You’re thinking,” Tony murmured.
“Fine. I promise.”
“You’ll tell me everything?” Steve asked.
Family movie night.
Steve’s chest pinched. “I’m here to support you, Pete—“
Steve felt like an absolute dick, but his conscience was quick to remind him that Tony could get pretty nasty when he started a fight with Steve. Thinking back now, he’d just retaliated, even in moments where he should have questioned why Tony was starting a fight out of the blue.
Tony’s eyes narrowed, indicating he knew exactly what he’d done. “I’ll be different when we’re in front of people.”
Morgan giggled. “Nu-uh.”
It was bad enough he was crouched there, totally naked with sand up his ass. As if that wasn’t humiliating enough.
“I’m sorry,” Tony said as he brushed off his shirt. “Didn’t mean to sound rude. I just…” He shook his head. “You’re funny, Steve.”
And then after his life was over, he would rot in hell for making his child hate him and turning his back on a man who had loved him to the very end.
“Is that a threat?” Steve growled.
The waitress headed off without giving Tony another glance.
Tony’s brow furrowed as a warmth started in his stomach, a warmth that moved up his body where it settled at the back of his jaw, tingling there. This wasn’t right.
Tony meant to tease back, but suddenly Steve was there, his arms wrapped around Tony’s middle. It was familiar and warm, but not in the way Tony remembered. Somehow it felt like this wasn’t really Steve, just one of the dopplegangers Tony had called in during his darkest moments.
There were all kinds of perks that came with Special Forces. Even more than when Steve had been involved during the forties.
Bucky shrugged, and a sad smile came to his lips. “All I’m saying is that if you want this to work, you gotta stop texting him. I know him better than anyone, even you. He’ll come around, and he’ll let you know. He won’t…he’ll never leave you hanging.”
Tony returned to his side, his hand resting on the small of Steve’s back in a comforting gesture. “Presents, maybe? Mistletoe? Something else Christmas-y?”
“Listen to me,” he pleaded softly, his voice cracking.
Boone shrugged. “Nobody left any messages. Just calls.”
Friday scanned rapidly to try to identify the source of the laser point, but as his glasses went infrared the laser vanished. Tony set his jaw, more frustrated than scared.
His radio crackled to life. “Winter, candidates ready to begin testing, over.”
“That’d be pretty rude for me not to say hi to the people getting married. But, Pete, I wanted to ask to see if—“
The man fell into the snow with a wheeze.
At 10:05, Steve told himself Tony was just running late. At 10:30, he no longer found a reason to be lifting weights.
“Well,” Tony chuckled. “Can’t say I’ve heard that one before.”
The car stopped and for a moment neither of them moved. Steve looked out the side window at the growing storm clouds and Tony stared out over the steering wheel.
Steve handed over the falcon and opened his mouth to say something else, but Pepper was gone.
Peter pulled furiously at his tie, his face in a scowl.
Tony shook his head. “You said you needed space. Didn’t really think you needed that much, but we’ll get past it. I love you, and I know now that you never wanna do anything bad by me.” He swallowed. “Even if sometimes you do that the wrong way, I think we’ve both learned our lessons.”
The reporter nodded. “He declined to comment for this show.”
“I’ve got it handled, Blaine,” Steve cut. “You’re out of line.”
They rounded a corner and Steve lifted his rifle, firing at three oncoming guards. One after the other, they fell to the ground, no match for the practiced accuracy of two operators.
“Come on up, slowpoke,” he said as he crouched down and offered Steve a hand to help him up the ladder.
Steve did. “I still don’t see why I need to be involved. Or why I
The grass whispered around him as he strode through the outlying field surrounding the manicured lawn of the compound. He listened for the rustling of animals as he moved through the silvery sea until the grass suddenly shrank to nothing when he broke onto the grounds.
Fighting for God and country was out the window. They fought because it helped them feel alive and breathing and good. They fought for praise from fellow soldiers and the glory of enemy lives in their hands.
But he loved Tony. Still. He could never shake it. Loving Tony was part of his being—he’d taken an oath to love and protect him at all costs. Even if Tony broke that oath and severed that vow, Steve would always hold up his end up the bargain.
“Let’s hope not,” Steve chuckled. He looked to Tony. “Good to see you. I hope everything is going well.”
Their conversation the night before hadn’t been anything special. Crashing on a deserted island hadn’t even been anything that would bring them closer together. Nothing new had really been exchanged between them. There was no cataclysmic event that tore them to their core like Steve had always been expecting.
Tony stood with another draw of wine. “I’ll be back for more magic juice,” Tony told Thor, who might as well have been wagging a tail and slobbering around a tennis ball with the look he got back in return.
Vision’s eyes opened, his chest tight. “Why would he ask for this?”
“How together do we have to be?”
Steve nodded while he folded up his wallet and repocketed it. “Yeah, I’d like that.”
on the outside of their shelter signaled that the rain was finally beginning.
Right now, he just had to make it through the next few minutes while Stark got his coffee or his breakfast or whatever.  So he focused on his newspaper and tried to think of a witty comeback.
“Your kid’s a real prick,” Blaine muttered, tossing the invitation onto the table beneath the window.
Instead, he stayed quiet and kept staring, and Steve stared right back.
“Sorry about nappin’,” Bucky said, another yawn escaping him. “Jesus, can’t stop.”
He slung the boy’s body unceremoniously onto the other man’s before tossing the dog on top.
Bucky let out a snort. “I told Peter to call ‘n leave a message. That’s all I can tell ya.”
A lump formed in Steve’s throat.  He hated that it had come to this. Divorce was supposed to happen to other people, not to them. They had been so perfect together, so right for each other. And Steve still loved Tony, but loving him had become too painful. Tony wouldn’t accept help, and Steve couldn’t stand to see him endanger himself any further. He loved someone who was no longer present in his husband.
“Good. Don’t go to the wedding then,” Bucky said.
Last night was yet another example of that uncertainty flaring up into defensiveness, sharp tones, and all out yelling.
“Just look at this, Steve.”
“You gave up,” Blaine said quietly. “I watched you just give up, you fucker.”
Bodies had been everywhere during the war. Decaying corpses were commonplace, both enemy and friendly. During the height of the fighting, there just wasn’t time to get anyone in caskets or in the ground.
Steve slackjawed for a moment, his big blue eyes searching for the words he seemed to have lost.
Steve rolled onto his side to face Tony, carefully reaching out to smooth a hand over Tony’s shoulder. Tony flinched, but relaxed almost immediately.
“Have you set a date for the wedding?” the reporter asked Peter with a wide smile.
He paused for a moment when he noticed the old-fashioned, drooping lamps that hung overhead. They were cast iron, shaped like bulbous cages—and he had
“The UN has even commented on the positive implications, and I have fifty seven calls from various diplomatic leaders with well wishes, congratulations, and various charities requesting your first public appearance as a couple.”
and look at that, a happy ending. thanks for reading! had a lot of fun on this one. new stony fic coming in the near future. :)
“Uh oh.” Iron man stopped his descent, hovering over the team. “That bad today?”
Jackson was perfect, honestly. Steve could see it just as much as everyone else. Jackson never once allowed any awkwardness between himself and Tony’s ex husband. He had met Steve one-on-one on several occasions when Steve had been visiting in New York, just to discuss what Steve would be comfortable with. Never once had he crossed the line, nor had he even neared it.
Bucky gave a curt nod and left without saying goodbye to Tony or Jackson, but they didn’t seem to notice. They were lost in their own little world, though Jackson was trying not to be obvious about it.
Blaine took a long sip of his beer from where he leaned on the terrace wall beside Steve, scanning the rooftops.

Not today.
“колыбельная,” he murmured. “That’s her name.” Engraved there with a knife when he had been promised that this was his weapon. The only item he had been able to own beyond a few knives.
“Best I’ve ever had.”
Despite what Tony liked to think, Steve was a lot different than he’d been on that helicarrier decades ago. He crouched beside one of the computers and started tearing at wires. In his head, he knew what each port and wire did, and the potential value for all of it.
Their fingers twined together a moment later, and Steve swallowed hard, already knowing what this meant. He glanced over at Tony, and they shared a look that Steve couldn’t decipher in words or thoughts.
“Next week,” Tony finished. “You’ll see us next week.”
Somehow, they would still be enough.
, Steve,” Tony growled, squirming to try to get Steve inside him any way he could.
His vision began to fade, and Steve knew it was going to go black for a long time. He didn’t think of Peter, or Tony. He saw balloons, Coney Island. But he felt the warm hold of a chubby little fist around his index finger, the feeling of ruffling Peter’s soft hair, warmed by the sun.
God, he’s been a damn idiot. The sparkle in Tony’s eye had just been excitement to go on a mission, not to go
“I moved in last September, so almost a year now,” Steve replied.
Steve slapped him away. “Don’t
Tony turned to look at the setup of blood bags and tubing, and pressed something on a tablet beside him. Steve heard a hum, a few clicking noises, and then a rhythmic
“Yeah.”
Those memories would never return. He knew now that those feelings of love and affection would never return either. Certainly not for Tony.
Tony clucked his disapproval. “Like I said, you weren’t intruding. Now, what did you want to see me for?”
“Don’t touch.”
The two were spotted hand-in-hand last night in Manhattan leaving Stark Tower!
Leave it to Tony Stark to prove a theory wrong.
“Where is he, Bucky?” Tony asked, and his voice was quivering. “Just tell me where he is.”
“I need more of an explanation than that,” Tony said.
I also hope missing out on this is your greatest regret. I hope my name brings a bitterness into your mouth you can’t get rid of for days. I hope every object you see, every word you hear makes you think of me and hurt.  I hope you have to go to medical sometimes just to make sure you’re not having a heart attack, and I hope you feel guilty that it’s my money paying for that EKG.
Soldiers made the mistake of calling them wannabe badasses until they saw the way that operators (that was what they were called—not soldiers) lived and trained.
He was fine now.
“Sam,” Steve breathed with a hint of a smile, unsure of what to do.
Steve swallowed hard and tried to relax. “Oh, jeeze, yeah. This is Blaine. We work together.” He looked at Blaine and motioned to Bucky and Sam. “Blaine, this is Bucky, and that’s Sam.”
“He got me in the ribs, but it didn’t go deep,” Blaine replied, gingerly prodding at his right side. “I’m all right.”
“I don’t know,” he finally answered, looking down at his hands. “We’ve been dating a few months and it seems like it’s in a tailspin. We fight all the time when we’re together.”
Tony almost laughed. Almost. “Right. He does go on the internet, you know. Not that he needs internet to see that me and him don’t exactly match up on the morality scale. ”
The roar of an approaching train was promising though. Steve pocketed his card and carefully stepped forward toward the platform, awaiting the train.
Tony. Tony, who had more grey in his hair every time Steve saw him. They had joked about grey hair many times over the years, and Tony had always pretended to loathe age. But he wore it well and he knew it. Though, obviously, Steve was the king. Steve didn’t look any older than maybe thirty.
There was a pause, then Tony shifted, clearly confused. “Secret? Uh, what do you mean?”
“That still doesn’t explain how you got an invitation.”
Then again, his gut had also told him those eyes were familiar. Maybe a different color, but familiar.
I know that’s selfish, and these are words I won’t be able to take back, but they’re true.
With a final check to her vitals, Tony turned to head back to an empty bedroom to curl up in cold sheets and wonder if a man across town had fallen out of love with him.
“Sounds good. Tell him I’ll see him at home.”
Peter stared back at him, his face full of nothing but relief.
Steve bristled, lips curling to a snarl.  “The penthouse is not yours to give,” Steve grit out. Despite all of the warning signs to the contrary, Steve was disturbed to find that he didn’t feel any gripping worry. There was no sense of dread in his gut, like he usually felt when Tony was in any kind of danger--when anyone he cared about was in danger.
By the time he met Rhodey on the track and started jogging, the engagement party was in full swing. He watched Steve dance, listened to the whispers about guests, the inside jokes the three of them shared now. The things Tony would know whenever Steve decided to come back. No gap to bridge, no relationship to rebuild.
“That’s his spitball,” Tony said, pointing at Steve. It was only right that she knew.
The darkness was a gentle presence as he settled a little deeper into his position on the bed. He thought about how it wasn’t too long ago that he had thought they would spent the rest of forever sharing the same bed. He still thought of his ideal future as one where he woke up beside Tony.  But he understood that wasn’t going to be the case now, and he’d resigned himself to accept it.
Her “connections” were Peter and Stark Industries. Her threats were real. Her father was his son. Or used to be.
When he yanked the door open, it flew off the hinges.
“Yeah,” Steve said, sniffling a little to make sure his nose wasn’t going to bleed anymore. “Peter.”
He waited for an argument, but there was none. Wanda just gave a small shake of her head, defeated. It was better this way. For the team.
Blaine popped an eye open. “Even though you’d still fuck him if he asked?”
“No.” Steve shook his head. “You have to promise to be decent to me. I’m not going to let you verbally abuse me behind-the-scenes.”
The sounds called them. Each rolling wave beneath them sent energy surging to triumph over their fear. They were scared to death and itching to fight all at once. Some men howled, like dogs. They were all like dogs, Steve supposed. Dogs penned up for too long, trained but never put to the test. Now they were furious with excitement, ready to sink their teeth into flesh and tear away.
Steve’s beard itched uncomfortably against the bottom of his helmet as he walked, but other than that he was just fine. The mission would be an easy success, as they all had been so far. Even when things got sticky, they were the guys who were hand-selected, the best of the best.
“Did you just spitball me?” Tony asked, utterly dumbfounded.
“Tony,” it came out garbled and weak, but he spoke. “Tony.”
Devastation came without precursor. Even so, Steve should have seen it coming.
Steve shut up.
That set Peter off at a run—he loved holding the shield.
Her hat at least made her stick out among the kids, and Tony could track her by watching which direction those little faces were looking, and a few anxious little souls trying to run after her.
Tony’s gaze softened. “I know, Steve. You’re too good for that.” Tony’s hand lifted from beneath his, and Steve hummed as fingers carded through his hair. He heard the tablet click off, and opened his eyes when Tony slid back down beneath the covers, arms winding around Steve’s middle.
“Soon,” Steve sighed. “Two hours. I think. But I’m already packed.”
“Paparazzi caught you both leaving Stark Tower last night, and every major tabloid publication has a variation of the image on their front cover. Online news media outlets have been reporting on it all morning, and major political channels have been discussing the implications of your new relationship.”
Winona frowned. “I can’t make that promise. The very nature of this is public, Tony. Trying to hide that you’re adopting a child could seriously impact your standing.”
“Excuse me,” Steve said quietly, gently pushing Tony aside.
“I wanna sleep in tomorrow. I don’t want to have to set any alarms.”
But none of that made it any less terrifying.
“Fuck off,” Blaine growled, his light eyes narrowed to two foamy-green slits. “What’d he say?”
The words hung in the air a little too long, twisting them from something positive to something less so. He hated the way it echoed in his chest like notes gone sour, because it was all a lie. He could have fun at a pop up exhibit with Steve Rogers, but it didn’t change that he was hiding a pretty big secret, and would be hiding one for some time still.
“I did not—“
He took a breath, calculating the beats of his heart. One-two, one-two, one-two—
Fuck.
Not-Tony opened his mouth to speak, then closed it again. After a moment, he let out a sigh.
Unless…Tony blinked as worry began to creep up. Had he missed something? A parent-teacher thing? He’d only met Morgan’s main teacher once, but they used a new teacher every other class. She’d been a kind older woman with small glasses and a big smile. She looked about as safe as he could have imagined.
“I think I need to go,” Steve said quietly. As soon as the words left his mouth, he knew it was what he needed to do. He couldn’t stay here tonight, even if he’d been dreaming it for the past three months. Not if Tony had a kid here. He’d been around enough orphans in his lifetime to know that some new person in their home—especially a person there to stay—could ruin whatever Tony had built over the past few months.
“What, something on my face?” He grinned, then plopped a little spot of red on Morgan’s round little nose.
“Because of some pictures?” Tony stammered. “Jesus, we haven’t even confirmed anything yet!”
He felt the mattress sink as someone sat down on his bed.
No, instead of using Extremis, he had let his hair grey as much as he could stand. At this point it would probably be all grey like his father’s, but Tony had to dye it. The touch-of-grey look was as far as he would go.
But he just couldn’t take a hint.
Steve wasn’t entirely sure Jackson was actually talking to him, but he smiled anyway.
“Is something wrong? It’s three.”
“By who?”
“I’m leaving for three months,” Steve reminded him.
“Yeah, of course. Why wouldn’t it be?” Steve quickly shoved more oatmeal in his mouth.
“You should come! It’s not just painting, we actually haven’t really painted anything yet. We sketch, mostly.”
Tony cocked a brow. “Yeah?”
“I panicked,” Tony explained. “I planned to pick you up with Morgan, but I couldn’t decide if that was better or worse. I thought better, then worse. So I drove her over to Pepper’s place, then she started telling me to bring her. Then Morgan started crying--and I can’t stand to see that kid cry, Steve and—” He looked defeated, running his hand through his hair again. “I dunno, I fucked up. I fucked up a lot.”
Tony tried not to have expectations. He told himself (and his therapist) that he knew expectations set him up for failure. Steve had to show up on his own accord. It was Steve’s choice, and Tony had to be happy to see him when and if he did appear.
She beamed at him before wiggling an eyebrow at Steve as she walked off. Everyone loved Steve. He was too perfect not to. But there was only one person Steve had chosen to be with, and that was him.
“Can you send Ant Man up there?”
“No. I’m having Dad come pick me up.”
“With Captain America, right?” Steve tried, lip curling to a smirk. “Heard he wasn’t so perfect after all.”
“That’s not what I’m doing,” Tony said, and he sounded so defeated that Steve couldn’t be angry. “I told you that I couldn’t tell you. Even if things have changed, I still can’t say anything.”
“It’s the closest to our operation,” Natasha insisted. “I’ve stayed at this safehouse several times. It’s solid.”
“That’s fair,” Steve said with a shrug. “I guess you’re right.”
“…like living with two of the most prominent Avengers as parents? You’ve got Tony Stark, Iron Man, who you now co-own Stark Industries with, and then your other father is Captain America, whose legend spans over a century.”
Nobody said anything as he walked out. They weren’t the type of men to ask unnecessary questions about his personal life.
were. The only exceptions were far worse: press.
Steve. Steve was how. Steve was the reason for most of the good decisions he’d made in this chapter of life.
“You’re not interrupting anything,” Tony purred, looping his arms around Steve’s waist. That always seemed to work. Steve relaxed into the hold, and Tony knew any suspicion that might develop was melting away with Steve’s surprise. “Just catching up—old lawyer friends.”
“Before you do it then, you need to tell me.”
Peter’s eyes were glassy and Steve couldn’t understand why. “Papa, I didn’t mean to make you so sad,” Peter stammered. “I just got mad at you for a second, that’s all.”
“Meet her?” Steve scoffed, eyes welling with tears. “What, now? Where is she?”
Steve looked away from Peter and his smile fell at once. “I don’t need ‘help,’ Tony,” he hissed quietly. “If you just wouldn’t have run up here to make a spectacle out of this, then everyone would be perfectly fine right now.”
The man leaned back and closed his eyes. Bucky guessed he was singing, because the target’s lips began to move in time with his and her mouth stayed open too long to be talking.
Of course, Steve was still the same, his bags were already packed, and he hadn’t forgotten anything.
One thing Tony hated most in the world was being tricked.
Steve had imagined this meeting a thousand times over the past three months. He’d played out scenarios where Tony leapt into his arms, kissed him at the door, or just grinned in that soft way he did when he was so, so happy. Of course, he’d also played through the scenarios where Tony just stared at him coldly, greeted him with a sarcastic remark, or just avoided him entirely.
Steve scowled. “Right. That doesn’t change that it did happen this way—that you chose for it to happen this way. You’re still in the wrong.”
“I get that,” Steve said carefully. “But how is sleeping next to me going to change that? I’m not him, Tony. I’m not.”
“Go to your room,” Steve said quietly.
“Did you hang up on me?” Peter demanded. “Jeeze, Pops, I didn’t know sex scared you that much.”
It was the same reason he hurried to get to the training center before nine. Before Tony showed up to throw a few punches with Happy. Accidental. It wasn’t like Steve knew for sure that Tony was going to be there. Yes, he often showed up between nine and ten, but it wasn’t like Steve went to work out just to see if he showed up.
Steve blushed (he wasn’t even that embarrassed!) and took another spoonful of chili.
“You’ve been trying to do everything yourself,” Peter said, sounding far too grown up to be a sixteen year-old. “Let us do something for you.”
Steve stepped toward it, trying to recall where exactly he’d seen them. It had to be during the war—he couldn’t imagine any place having any ugly lamps like that now.
Just to see.
“If it meant keepin’ you from bein’ like this—“
He was going to do it. He was going to ask this guy out.
The waves hissed in the distance, and the rain continued to pound against the metal keeping them dry.
Sometimes he tried to force himself to imagine Bucky, only to feel ashamed about it because there was no way in hell he was ever going to be attracted to Bucky that way. He’d even tried to think about Sam, but then he always pictured Sam’s cheerful grin and shuddered.
Steve shrugged. “She talks to me. A lot, actually. And she loves talking about you.”
Steve didn’t even make it to the ocean before Bucky stepped out of nowhere and grabbed him, Blaine hot on his heels. He tried to fight them, but Bucky and Blaine knew every move he had in his arsenal. He threw out his elbows and screamed for them to let go, but they dragged him away from the frothing, hissing waves he had so desperately wanted to dive into. Not to kill himself, just to see if he could swim all the way across the Aegean in one night. Just to do anything but think about how much he had destroyed the people he loved the most.
It only took a few minutes for the eyelash to reach its destination, where the nanobot at the end of the hair follicle burrowed back into Tony’s upper lash.
Tony didn’t respond right away. “Yeah, we were.”
“This isn’t my first leave, bud,” Blaine murmured before taking another swig of his drink. “You’re gonna be nervous the whole time.”
Steve could see his hands shaking. He reached forward, gently folding his over Tony’s.
Just before he dropped off to sleep, a little squeeze came back.
Not-Tony chewed his lip, looking out the windows at the city beyond. “Something happened to you not that long ago. You were somewhere familiar, and suddenly it wasn’t familiar anymore, right?”
All of a sudden, Steve realized that none of these people were his friend anymore.
“Well, you didn’t die,” Thor said proudly.
Lunch wasn’t as telling as dinner, but the fact that it was just going to be the both of then made Steve nervous. That party hadn’t magically changed things between them. Steve couldn’t think of one reason why Tony would want to meet him for lunch. They were simply coworkers now—and the fact that they could even run missions together was something of a miracle.
Steve stepped from the shower and grabbed a towel. “I’d do it, you know,” he said to the shower door. “This. Every day. If you’d just stop with it all.”
No grime from the station floor. No wet slime from the rain.
He looked up at him, past those impossibly long lashes and into those familiar blues. It was hard not to admire the perfection in human form that was Steve Rogers. The way his jaw set, the subtle curves of his cheekbones. The little tiny dent in his nose from a fight Tony never wanted to hear about. This was indeed his Steve. But this was a Steve who had accepted defeat and come back to him willingly.
She wasn’t looking at him. Little brat.
“Holy shit!”
Despite all of that, Steve just had a pressing numbness in his gut about the whole thing. He feared what Tony would say, but he wasn’t sure what words he was actually afraid of. He couldn’t imagine that Tony was calling him up on a date (he’d made it clear that wasn’t what this was) but there was always a chance that maybe Tony was just trying to get his guard down, to make him more susceptible to saying yes.
That got a real smile out of Rhodey, and he patted Tony’s shoulder.
“You backed out,” Tony started, because that was where it all began. “You came back and didn’t even want to meet her before you left.”
A thin smile came to Steve’s lips. “Like I said, it’s okay.”
Steve wouldn’t have been able to go to the funeral even if he had been invited. He was currently at a diamond mine in Russia, ensuring that insurgents didn’t steal any more gems from the mines. In reality, it wasn’t the diamonds at stake, but the stronghold of vibranium stored two miles underground, imported from Africa and currently the most desirable material on planet earth.
Why was he always so mean? Every time anyone was nice to him, Tony especially, he was wary of them. Like a frightened dog, he snapped at the hands that fed, clothed, and housed him.
Steve looked at Peter over his shoulder, his grin threatening to split his face. “Yes. I promise.”
“Hey, Dayvon! So glad you made it. Was the flight okay? Good, good.”
“Okay,” Steve said stupidly. What else could he say? Leaving would only make him seem like a drama queen. Staying meant living with the fact that he had done something bad to Tony’s wedding day.
“If you want to see any robots, you’ve gotta let me wipe it off,” Tony argued. Sometimes bartering worked.
Bucky shook his head. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep, Steve.”
God, it was so strange to touch him again. Even if this was not consensual by any means, Steve had to do it. Just to make sure that was still the same Tony he’d left. No—the same Tony who had left him.
Steve’s vision blurred for a moment, but he blinked it away, trying to avoid the dizziness. He hadn’t taken a good look at his arm yet, and he didn’t think it would be a good idea to do so until they were back in the barracks.
“You said it was gonna start hurtin’,” Steve reminded him, gently easing back against Tony to sit up, ultimately ending up on his lap.
“Whatever it is, we’ll face it together. Just like always,” Steve soothed, but his face had gone cold. “You and me.”
Steve settled in under the covers, but his heart ached. Maybe he really had been insensitive with Tony. Two years had felt like plenty of time for Tony to come to terms with what had happened, but then again if Tony had known some kind of truth about how Bucky had died and withheld it…that wouldn’t be anything close to enough time. Enough time to get over the anger, sure, but not the pain.
“Was that what it was?” Tony pretended to think it over. “Hm. Fine. That might’ve been excusable.” A little grin came to his lips. Okay, even if Rhodey was just trying to cheer him up with the Steve liking him thing, he had a point.
He turned his head to look at the door. “Blaine?”
He could feel Steve fight off a cringe. “Thank you,” Tony said, and he met her eye as he handed over the drawing. “For everything.”
“You waited for me,” Steve murmured, lifting a hand to gently thumb Tony’s cheekbone.
Then Tony was sitting there, looking older and wiser, but still with the same warmth to his eyes and smirk on his lips.
“Deja-vu,” Steve snorted, looking over the portal.
“You said I had to accept your terms, but you couldn’t tell me why. Well, wouldn’t.”
Tony shook his head. “Nope. We’re not doing this.”
When Steve shot Tony a confused look, he clarified. “Cleaning bots were always around when we were all here. Hard not to associate them with a houw full of people who aren’t here anymore.” Tony stood and offered Steve a hand. “Should be good to stand on it now.”
Peter walked by him without so much as a glance and Steve found himself unprepared for the sting of being ignored.
“A little, yeah,” Steve chuckled, his voice wet.
One of the soldiers, the furthest one, was smoking a cigarette. He had an ugly scar on his right brow, with an ugly smile to match it. The other soldier holding the dog was significantly younger than the first, with blond hair peeking from beneath his hat.
Steve had listed everything, angry and upset because Tony was really gone, Tony was really leaving him for good.
Steve looked up again, this time scanning for any signs that this guy was duping him. But Ben’s body language was honest—a little tense, a little excited. Not a guy who seemed to have any clue who he was talking to.
Tony frowned, then after a moment just rolled his eyes. “You’re allowed to touch me. Hell, I’ll even allow cuddling.”
Morgan frowned, but it was the kind of frown that asked
His son ignored him and his ex husband thought he was a horrible father, but Steve would take that over becoming an abuser any day.
“Steve?” Tony croaked out, gripping tight to him, his fingers curling into Steve’s shirt. “What the hell happened—where were you?”
Steve looked away. “She could change her mind. It’s not—“
Steve could only make our the basic features of Tony’s face in the dark and it reminded him of the sketches he used to draw while he had been on the run. Something so familiar to him should have been so easy to capture and recreate for himself on paper. But as time had gone on he’d lost the wisdom in Tony’s lashes, and lost place of the little lines  at the edges of his smile. No sketch was ever completed, all of them too unfamiliar.
“Hey, Tones,” Steve greeted. “The storm woke him up.”
Tony sighed, but didn’t turn away. “Yes. That.”
Nikolai, Steve’s German Shepherd, sniffed the falcon and looked at him, wagging his tail. Charlie, one of his retrievers, cocked his head, watching the falcon as though it might come to life.
Two more boats hit mines that they could hear.
So he sat on the furthest edge of the sofa, folding his hands in his lap and trying to portray some kind of confident politeness.
“I do,” Steve blurted out. “I do love you, Tony.”
“Well, that’s encouraging.” Rhodey handed over the glass and took his seat again, looking at Tony expectantly.
“Uh, hey,” Tony managed to get out, shifting on the couch.
Steve looked away. He could handle this. It was just a little drive with Tony. And really, they had been divorced for fifteen years. Bucky was being dramatic.
Steve cut him a glare. “Blaine.”
Long gone was the round chubby cheeks and squealing giggles.
“Well, looks like Hulk found something,” Iron Man said, flicking his live feed onto Steve’s desk. Hulk had the creature by the mouth, pulling back with all of his might. The creature sputtered, but appeared immobilized by the move, but it was still struggling to free itself where it could.
“I can make sure you get there on time every day, if it’s the travel,” Steve offered. “I can call in some favors and—“
Rhodey let out a snort. “That’s it? Hell, I coulda told you that years ago. I knew that MIT education was just a joke. I knew it all along.”
“You should finish this up,” Steve said quietly.
Steve sighed, but lifted his gaze to meet Tony’s.
“And, for the record, I didn’t sleep with anyone last night.”
“What?” Steve blinked. “Maybe physical, but not that kind of physical.”
“You should definitely go,” Tony said, almost too quickly. “I think it’d be great for you.”
Steve didn’t have to think hard for that one. “When the fighting’s over, we find each other like we always did. Ask each other if we’re okay, big hug. Maybe kiss your head or something.”
“Thank you,” he murmured, giving Tony one last smile. “Stay safe, Tony.”
Instead, work had fallen completely to the wayside. He found himself wanting to work on one—and only one—project: his family. A piece of that family was missing, but he wasn’t sure that piece was even going to come back. Yet the bed did feel empty every night, and the sole letter he had was feathering at the edges and starting to come apart in his hands.
She nodded distractedly, still looking out the window.
“Awh, Popsh,” Peter said around the chips. “We jus droff like forepher and I had to listen to Dad’s life story for like the hunreffh time.”
Helmets had gone from the glorified buckets of World War II to technologically advanced systems that projected images from inside the helmet that made it appear as though the wearer didn’t have anything on at all. Steve didn’t even know how it was possible, but he was wearing the same helmet, and could see everything in the OWL cabin as clear as day. Well, night.
Where normally the place looked like your typical posh school for socialite children, it was set up today with modern furniture, bright lighting, and spotlights on ornately framed children’s drawings. The atmosphere was cheery, and warmer than Tony had expected, and almost no one looked like they particularly cared if he was there or not.
“Your problem is that you think I’m going to go looking for a fight,” Blaine explained as they headed down one of the brightly lit passageways toward the mess hall. “When I make a move, you keep thinking I’m going to follow through with my original plan of attack. But when I see you’ve anticipated, I adjust. Your center of gravity is up here,” Blaine knocked the back of his knuckles against Steve’s chest. “Black Widow? Hers is in her hips. That’s partly why she likes the thigh moves—yeah, yeah, I’ve seen her fight.”
Tony was the same. Love had made him better and brighter, and that had stayed. Somehow, that had stayed. Steve couldn’t say the same for himself.
“Buck, leave him be,” Steve warned, still breathing hard. “He’s always cranky when he doesn’t have his caffeine.
Steve just waved a second time, the lump in his throat too big to speak around. He busied himself with his phone turning it back on to receive several emails and yes, a few texts from Tony.
Rhodey cocked a brow. “Yeah? Name one time.”
Just as before, so long as he breathed and walked around pretending that things were going to get better, nobody would care.
,” Peter laughed. “We can talk in code, Papa!”
With only slight embarrassment, Steve stood up, allowing the blanket to fall and exposing his naked body to the moonlight. Some years ago, this might have triggered a crafty line from Tony that ended with them fucking in the surf.
They should have been having this conversation a year ago. Now Steve and Tony both had scarring, their respective wounds healed over.
And he’d been stagnant for fifteen years. What did that say about him?
Tony frowned. “Why not?”
“Yep, enough!” Tony cut her off, face flushing.
An hour later, Steve was sitting with his bottom lip between his teeth, staring out his window from where he sat on the edge of his bed.
Steve smiled and sent another bullet into a man’s chest. “So you are nervous.”
Winona narrowed her eyes, but shook his hand before standing up. “I’ll do my best. But I’m not making any promises. In fact, I’m telling you this could blow up in your face in a very big way—”
But Steve had a paper invitation. Thick cardstock with a nice weight, but paper nonetheless.
“I don’t think so,” Steve added after a long moment. “But I don’t know how we’re supposed to do this.”
They stared at each other for a moment, and then they were circling. Steve scanned for a sign that Blaine would come at him, and Blaine looked for the same thing in him.
“Woah, woah.” Tony rubbed Steve’s arms, concerned. “Baby, slow down. Tell me what’s going on—what happened to you? Did someone hurt you?”
“You said that about that mead, too,” Steve muttered, but he reached out and grabbed the glass by the bowl. Didn’t even take a whiff of it before sipping it like a dog.
Steve gripped tightly to the white stucco underneath his palms, breathing hard as he fought another wave. He could feel eyes on him. He could feel the prickle of crosshairs on his back, his head, his chest. All around him people were talking, filling the night air with so much fucking noise that he couldn’t think.
He heard the clink of a coffee mug and the sound of Tony rubbing his face. He couldn’t help but wonder what Tony had been up to if he had spent a Friday night alone. He’d probably been in the lab. Or maybe he’d been waiting around to ask someone out. Sitting there in his penthouse, wishing Steve was there. And then maybe they would have ended up on the couch, watching the fireplace and talking about things. Tony would lean over and say how much he had wanted this to happen, and then, just like that, they would be kissi—
He wasn’t supposed to answer questions like that, but he shook his head.
“Is that coffee I smell?” Tony asked, sitting up on his elbows, the hologram vanishing.
“Says the guy drinking champagne while I’m here sucking on sparkling grape juice,” Tony heard himself say in reply. It was strange to hear his own voice when his mouth wasn’t moving.
Blaine smirked, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Trust me, if you don’t eat…you think you’re seeing things now.” He lifted his brows and laughed, though it was a bitter sound. “I saw some kid with chicken wings and—well, first I thought he had a pistol, but then I grabbed him by the collar and put a knife to his throat—and he handed them right over.”
Someone was sending a message.
Steve woke with the sun, and immediately knew where he was before he even opened his eyes. The penthouse master was his second home. He’d woken up with the scent of Tony’s silk sheets in his nose more than once. The last time he’d slept here had been years ago now, but everything was exactly as he remembered. Tony was an innovator, but he seldom changed his habits at home. Tony liked routine—it comforted him the same way it comforted Steve. There was familiarity in repetition.
When he looked over, he met Tony’s eyes. They were the same warm brown, with the same welcoming aura he’d always been drawn to.
Tony perked up. “Yes—yeah. My PR team ran the numbers, and that little tabloid piece did a lot for my image. Of course, it’s fragile and I know it won’t do anything long term, but that’s what I need you for.”
“Steve,” Tony said, his voice having lost all of the show he’d given Natasha.
“I knew this was a bad idea,” Bucky muttered as they started up the stairs to Steve and Blaine’s apartment.
In some ways, Emory filled the spaces Peter had left in him. Emory was just a kid. A kid who had been raised military and who had already been in Steve’s unit (though ‘unit’ was a loose term now) for four years. Emory had given up the possibility of a normal life, of a family. Steve wasn’t sure if his supposed military experimentation had been Emory’s choice, or if he had been the only candidate to fit the bill. Sometimes Emory faltered when his brain or body moved too fast, and his tendency for self-punishment left Steve to be the one to stop his angry fists and torn knuckles from hitting anymore concrete.
Tony Stark, who was now dead and buried.
“What are you doing here, anyway?” Tony asked, finally realizing that this wasn’t an Avengers event.
Tony rubbed his jaw, frantically trying to remember their previous conversation about this. He’d dumped everything in the back corner of his brain to be forgotten about. A year with Steve. God, had he really agreed to that? They hadn’t even made it six months. This wasn’t supposed to happen so early.
Blaine rolled his eyes. “I’m hungry.”
That was when his heart started pounding. All of the emotions that should have been hitting him already were attacking him all at once—pride, hurt, anger, confusion—and he had no idea what to do, no idea how to fix it. Because he did want this. Of course he wanted to be locked up in an art classroom with Steve Rogers staring at him through fake glasses that somehow made him even more attractive. But it wasn’t supposed to be like this. He couldn’t just…accept what Steve had done.
“I will.”
“—heard Steve Rogers, the ex, is
Rhodey smiled nodding once. “Yeah, yeah. But really, it is what I want.”
He looked…younger. His eyes had life in them Steve hadn’t seen since the Accords, his skin glowed, his small wrinkles looked smoothed out. This was not a man who looked unhappy, who looked like he had been pining after the man he’d dumped at the tarmac three months prior.
Two shadows appeared in the archway between the bar and the terrace and both Blaine and Steve looked over. Steve’s hand flew to where his rifle was usually resting, and inwardly panicked when it wasn’t there.
“And we appreciate it and want you to stay,” Jackson said. After a moment, he elbowed his fiancé.
A smile almost came to his lips.
“Pops, it’s not that.” Peter sighed, shaking his head. He looked exactly like Tony did when he was distressed. The last thing he wanted was for Peter to be distressed. “It’s just…it’s hassle if I live here, you know?”
Tony frowned, reaching over and pulling at Steve’s blanket, exposing his bare thigh. “Jesus, you’re not!”
“Projectile approaching, PREDATOR missile—your location must have—”
It was a curious thing to see a man in so much pain still refuse help, but that was Steve. He would rather suffer than swallow his pride. It was as infuriating as much as it was familiar. Tony could certainly do the same.
“With his dying breaths, Jesus extended grace to the criminal hanging beside him. There was no hope for him, no chance to promise God if he could just get out, he’d change his life, no chance to turn his life around. No more Goodness Points to be earned—and yet Jesus gave him grace!” The pastor paused, staring straight at him. Steve didn’t flinch, mostly because he knew it was too dark where he was sitting for the man to actually make out anything in the inky blackness from the stage.
“Pops, I know you and Dad got a divorce. It’s not gonna offend me or something.”
Tony gave a little start, then dug into his pocket, producing his phone. He clicked it on, holding it out to Steve.
old.’ Tony took his hand, lacing their fingers together and squeezing tight. “C’mon.”
“You’re all right, Rogers,” Blaine said, and Steve felt the thuds of his near-silent footsteps as he approached.
was good enough, or if he was going to Hell forever for letting a team of scientists alter his God-given body.
Steve shook his head. “Oh—no thank you. But I appreciate the offer.”
She didn’t even say anything to him.
Jesus, he couldn’t even keep himself together for a fucking rehearsal dinner.
“Bucky, I don’t…” He choked on his words, fighting himself not to say them.
Peter stepped back, his brows pinned as he scanned Steve’s face, confused. “I…I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said—“
“After I left, I didn’t even want to cry,” he said quietly. “Crying only makes it worse.” It made him see how weak he was. How fragile. Even talking about crying made him cringe. What a pathetic word. “And I know Tony’s either gonna find me tonight or find me tomorrow and he’ll try to talk to me about it but I just don’t want to, Buck. I don’t want to be around them anymore.”
“I am okay,” Steve argued. “I’m fine. You’re both getting upset over one outburst that I already apologized for.”
“I’m so glad you’re okay,” her father said. “I’m so glad.”
But it was also a place where Tony only existed in the form of spotty encrypted phone calls. Steve hadn’t seen Tony’s face in the flesh for two years, though he was fortunate (or unfortunate, as it was some days) to have such a high-profile husband that he got to see Tony’s face on magazines and TV quite often.
But in a moment like this, Bucky wanted to taste that aftershave and drink in the warmth that Steve’s body always exuded. A comfortable warmth, like curling up in bed with a big stuffed animal.
The man looked up at him and smiled, extending a hand. “I’m her husband, Franklin Richards.”
Another wave slammed against the stern, knocking into the ship and sending a few privates to the deck, young cheekbones slamming against wet rubber.
“Tony messed with this?” Steve asked, reaching forward.
“Mr. Snail,” Steve repeated, voice cold.
Tony rolled his eyes and pulled his hand away. “Get your clothes on before I’m finished.”
“I don’t want him just living with me. He’s our son, not just mine. He’s ours,” Tony said.
Though it did kind of bother him that Steve still hadn’t responded to his text.  But even that had about a million explanations. It was the middle of the afternoon, lunchtime, and training time for Steve. They had a briefing that they both needed to be at by seven anyway, so Tony knew he would see him then.
“Oh fuck that,” Bucky said, and Tony detected emotion in his voice—almost desperation. “Peter hasn’t called Steve in way over a year. Not even for Christmas or anything. After everything Steve sacrificed—for both of you. You abandoned him. That’s fuckin’ cruelty. You had to know that’s cruelty.”
“A call from Peter, sir,” JARVIS announced, interrupting his AC/DC.
It wasn’t.
His eyes narrowed. “You using my kid as leverage?”
He waved his hand, sending the hologram screen away before grabbing a pair of glasses,
Tony’s gaze didn’t waver. “Yeah, I can, Spangles.”
Steve frowned, but shrugged. “I guess that’s true.” He glanced down at the rifle. “Then what’s Lullaby for?”
Tony’s smile widened into something real as he let out a snort. “Told you, don’t get any ideas.”
“And I’ll be back on Saturday,” Peter said with a smile. “But maybe we could have dinner sometime this week too?”
And how could Steve deny that smile? Tony had no idea he’d disappointed him—Tony just wanted to be around him. He just wanted to spend time with his…friend. But maybe this was the way back to where they had once been.
can convince them.”
He pretended not to feel the way Tony’s body shook with a single, silent sob.
“Last night initiated Project Get Him—”
“So,” Tony asked as they waited. “Have you even been on a date since the divorce? Ever?”
“I’m coming, I’m coming,” Tony assured her as he hustled. Morgan seemed comfortable here, and she was smiling wider than ever. This place had become something of a home to her, a place of safety and refuge. Exactly what he’d been hoping for when he started all of this.
“I can’t exactly teleport down there,” Steve replied bitterly.
“Sir, I’ve been trying to wake you for several hours,” Friday responded a bit impatiently.
“I love you so much—”
“What about Tony?” Iron Man asked.
“I try so hard to leave you behind. Every fucking day I say it’s gonna be the last time I let you control my life, and every fucking day, I can’t do it,” Steve forced out. “When I don’t see you for awhile I think maybe I have a shot at this and then you show up again and I’m back—I’m back to square one—I fucking hate it!”
There was silence where there should have been a question.
“I am happy,” Steve said, but right now he felt numb.
“Pinned?”
But his heart knew. It clenched impossibly tight for just one moment, and then relaxed. Let go.
“Pops—Pops, we’ll be fine. We probably won’t wake up until noon anyway, like you said,” Peter said. “I haven’t slept in like two weeks and neither has Harry. We just got done with class two days ago.”
Steve swallowed, feeling sick again. He didn’t like lying to Sam, but anyone could be watching, listening, recording. “It’s great. Been awhile since I’ve been to Greece though.”
“He cares,” Steve said almost bitterly. “It’s not his fault. He’s just…it’s addiction. And alcoholism. That’s what’s taking him away.”
“Good eye,” he murmured before turning back toward the door.
His therapist had said it was a great idea. His therapist had encouraged him to come here. Bucky hadn’t even fought him for very long. Sam said he could get off work to hang out with him if he wanted someone at the wedding with him.
Embrace Jackson. Befriend him.
“A problem? Is everything okay?”
The Ferrari purred to life once Tony got in, and it was the only sound as they pulled out of the driveway.
“Knock it off!” Bucky was saying, but his voice was muffled. “Do you know how long it took me to plant that fuckin’ tree? Yeah, get the—stop! No! Fluffyfucker, I swear to God if you don’t let go of the tree—“
Steve kept his eyes to the ground as Tony and Jackson walked by, making their way to the flowery archway while everyone clapped and cheered. Faceless people in forgettable dresses and suits.
Tony frowned. “Babe,” he whined. “I want to catch up too, but I want to spend some quality time with you. The kind we can only have when the little guy’s asleep.”
Steve picked himself up off the ground, eyes narrowed. He wasn’t used to being beaten in the sparring ring, but the men in his unit weren’t normal soldiers. They were the cream of the crop—the people that hadn’t existed in Steve’s day. At least, the Army hadn’t been able to spend the time and money to look for them.
Most noticeably, the room was quiet. And clean. No decorations to clutter up space, no rugs or furniture to distract the eye. Steve smoothed out the sleeping bags, relieved that they could actually sleep at all. He’d expected the mission to take longer—they always did—and yet he didn’t have the pent up feeling of dread that came when a mission was
“Introduced?” Steve snapped.  “That’s a person you’re talking about, not a lab rat!”
Tony couldn’t fight the warmth in his chest when he heard that, but he shook his head. “That’s still not okay. That’s like, a big red flag for abusive relationships—why did you put up with that?”
Bucky frowned. “Why? Why the hell would you want this?”
The air went still as both of them stared at each other, Peter breathing hard and Steve just…staring.
Now, with the words still floating in the room around him, he felt vastly unprepared.
Tony set her down and took her little hand, watching as all eyes turned to them. Yes, they were the most high-profile people here, but Tony wasn’t going to let Morgan suffer for that. He offered a wave at the program director and led Morgan inside.
He plopped her back down and she was off again, dashing around the living room at full speed, lunchbox swinging in her hand. Part of him worried that she’d fall and hurt herself, but he’d been slowly learning to take at least a smidge of a step back on the helicopter parent thing. It helped that he’d been consumed in a new bio-engineering project recently that involved trying to 3D print organs.
“Tony,” Steve returned in the same bewildered tone.
Peter made a little noise in his sleep and Steve hushed him, gently scratching Peter’s back the way that always knocked him right out.
“Cigarette—but I wasn’t even able to—eating the fucking thing,” one of the soldiers was saying.
“Want a drink?” Blaine asked after a slow scan of the roof.
He wasn’t sure JARVIS had heard him until he heard the click of a line and someone breathing on the other end.
When he found Maria again, she was hugging tightly to a man that made Steve immediately uneasy. He was young and handsome, with blond hair and a frame that didn’t look all that powerful, but yet Steve had the feeling he should stay away.
“Boss,” Friday interrupted. “Captain Rogers is heading this way.”
More gunfire.
It wasn’t working.
When everyone started to leave, Mary Jane walked right over to him with a teary smile and pulled him into a tight hug, resting her cheek on his chest.
Steve put his hands up, taking a step back. “Whoa, Tony, I think something must have gone wrong. I got an invitation. I’m not crashing your wedding.”
Steve had always judged people who got divorced. He couldn’t help it—he had always seen marriage as something with greater importance than a relationship.
Steve shook his head. “They don’t have a signal. The EMP took it out, I guess.”
“She wants me running operations for her and Clint’s next mission.”
He turned his gaze away for the next few pictures. He already knew what they were. One of Blaine fast asleep in a hammock with Pearson grinning behind him, a foghorn in hand. One of their old team, all of the guys smiling falsely, the way men did when they were at war. And another, taken by a nanodrone just before their last mission together, Blaine mock-sneering at the camera.
“Mhm. It involves you and me, like the good ol’ days.”
The exertion, the falling to the dirt because he physically could not stand, and then getting back up and finding the will to move on because his team needed him, his men needed him. Not because of Peter or Tony.
A Navy commander stood on the deck, hunched against the wind, a wave cracking into the belly of the boat behind him. Steve remembered the white mist raining down, squinting into the grayness. Everything was gray. Dark gray paint on the deck, white gray in the clouds above, green gray on the uniforms of all the men.  All gray, everything gray.
Steve fought at his restraints, teeth gritted tight. He could have been home. The very thought enraged him and made him feel helpless at the same time. There was nothing he could do—sure, he could fight his way out, only to live in a world that wasn’t his own. The only way back was through Tony.
Peter extended a hand. His face was so old, with graying temples and hollow eyes. He aged just like Tony had.
Tony shook his head. “You know what, forget it.”
Until Morgan suddenly let go of his hand and rushed into the next room.
“Well sorry, you didn’t bring your vibranium shield,” Blaine growled. “Remind me to have you bring it next time.”
“Enemy patrol headed in your direction,” Cueball said over radio.
Despite not speaking to him for almost five years.
God, he couldn’t do this.
“Oh fuck off,” Pearson grunted. “We aren’t your FNG’s in the sim, Blaine.”
Steve laughed—it came so easy. Everything good came far too easily when Tony was around.  He sipped his drink, watching Tony with fondness in his eyes as he scrolled through the tablet.
“Peter, we see each other sometimes, right? Would you say we see each other sometimes?” he asked quietly, picking at his thumb again, his eyes glazed.
It would be the first time in a long time that Steve would be genuinely happy around Tony without fear that something dramatic was going to happen.
It was all for nothing, though. Steve had no plans with Tony, and whatever he’d been talking about with fake dating had obviously been some kind of joke. It occurred to him to text Tony to clarify, but he didn’t want to give the impression that he was looking to see him again, or even
He wanted to apologize for mentioning her parents, but he knew that would only make it worse.
He had slowed Tony down. He had taken him completely off the tracks because Tony had needed him to. Peter didn’t know that Tony would have literally worked himself to death if his values hadn’t been shifted and set straight. Peter had no idea how many nights Steve had spent awake, just making sure Tony stayed in bed and didn’t sneak down to the lab to finish whatever it was he was working on. Because he loved Tony too much to watch him waste away.
The first word Peter had said while Steve played with him alone on the kitchen floor. The frustrated look and puffy pink cheeks and the very loud “poh-t” that had him laughing for five minutes before he called Tony.
Steve could only imagine the kind of constant terror that would come with having to live with civilians for any length of time.
“Don’t even fucking try it with the guilt tripping, you pretentious ass,” Peter snapped after him, following him, haunting him as he threw open the door and—
“They aren’t saying anything important,” Steve murmured, carefully pulling his scope to his eye.
It was impossible to ignore the last texts they’d sent, and Steve figured Tony must have given them a long look before sending his message.
Her polite smile returned. “Of course not, Steve. We’re just busy. Not as busy as your wedding, but still very busy. I’ll take your gift.”
There was a brief pause. “Uh, I’m not sure. I wanted to see if you and Jackson were available first, for the more recent stuff, you know?”
The following phrases will be useful:
Steve glanced at Peter’s hand, but didn’t take it.  “Yes,” he finally answered.
“He doesn’t want to be around me,” Steve sniffled. “I’m some stranger—“
. The Army didn’t claim them in any paperwork, and they had no commanding officer documented anywhere. They also didn’t have to follow Army regulations: beards and stubble were commonplace, as was civilian clothing around base, and no one ever had the safety on when they walked around with their weapons.
“Was what worth it?” Steve asked, though he knew exactly what Blaine was asking.
“What’s her fever?”
Steve didn’t know how he was supposed to look it up without knowing the name, but Ben was a smart guy. “Here, let me just write down my number. Just in case you can’t find the place.”
“When you can pass a PT test, we’ll talk,” Rhodey cracked back, greeting Tony with a pat to the shoulder. “I was worried I’d lost you to the lab.”
“You talk to Bucky?” Steve asked. “Where is he? How does he know you?”
And now that same little kid hadn’t even wanted to tell him the news.
“Dad—“
Steve bit his lip and turned his face away.
Steve Rogers was crouched on the floor, and Morgan was jumping to him. Jumping. Her little arms wrapped around his neck for a big hug, and Steve was laughing as his stupid fake glasses were knocked right off his stupid, pretty face.
Tony laughed, but it was a bit pained.  “Aren’t I always? But no, not right now. I told you that last time.”
With a rare show of PDA, it looks like things are back on for the two superheroes.
Tony frowned. “Oh yeah? Why do you think that?”
“I dunno. I’m happy, though. For now. All of the crazy monster alien stuff is more for you guys anyway. I’m still a military man, always will be.”
Tony closed his eyes. He hadn’t known that, but now that he thought about it…Peter hadn’t mentioned ever going up to visit.
But their unit did not ask questions, like Blaine had said. They killed because someone else deemed it necessary.
Tony frowned, unconvinced. Morgan had been through fevers before, but this one just felt worse than the others. She’d been sluggish and cranky all day, and just wanted to sleep—all of which was very unusual for her.
Regardless, the wedding would be beautiful, Steve was sure. A quiet wedding on the beach, with none of the flair and dazzle of other celebrity weddings. The food would be excellent, the reception band superb, and none of it would be anything like when it had been Steve marrying Tony. Tony would probably make sure of that.  Even so, it would be a great time and a great day.
“I’m so tired, Buck,” he whispered. “I’m tired of this. I’m tired of everything.”
it wasn’t completely Barnes’ fault that his parents were dead.
“Two aces,” said Pearson, putting down two cards.
Tony smiled, letting his gaze drop. “You know, “ he said after a moment, “we should hang out while you’re here. Not too often that both us are in the city.”
Tony honked the Ferrari, but that only set the dogs howling as they danced around the cars, looking every so often at Steve.
Tomorrow would be the last time.
They both knew that might not happen.
Steve’s cheeks flushed. He didn’t remember saying anything that incriminating. “We were both drunk.”
Rhodey rolled his eyes and took a sip of juice.
Then a picture of Sam popped up, him and his buddies at his retirement home all wearing sunglasses and nodding to the camera. An old picture of the last time Steve had seen Clint, at a party for some charity Steve had never heard of. Clint had passed away just a few years after that. Assassinated by one of his own men.
“But really, they don’t put you out in the field anymore?” Tony asked. “I thought you were doing all kinds of, y’know, missions and stuff.”
Steve shook his head, tears streaking down his face where it was hidden in the crook of his arm, his knees drawn up to his chest.
The ceremony wasn’t longwinded. Tony knew everyone was here to party, and it wasn’t like this was his first wedding anyway.
“What is it?” Tony asked, because for all his brainpower, he really had no idea.
“We’re leaving, Morgan,” he said in his dad voice. It sometimes worked.
Steve had no recollection of that morning. He raked his mind to see if there was any time he could have woken up and noticed anything different. He couldn’t recall. But love was blind, all of that.
Even thinking about their last kiss on his doorstep almost eight years ago made his nose wrinkle up in disgust.
Bucky’s eyes went to his feet then, and he toyed with a piece of gravel under his boot.
He wasn’t expecting the wide smile that came in response. “Nobody picked us up yet?”
Yeah, right. Steve didn’t think it would be all that difficult for Tony to fall back in love with him if he actually wanted to. That didn’t even make sense. If someone wanted to fall in love with another person, how couldn’t it happen? The hard part in that case would be getting the other person to love them back. In their case, Tony had no issue there and he knew it.
She shook her head. “We’re done for the day. As much as we should be practicing while you’re distracted, you should go see Tony.”
His fingers curled at the nape of Steve’s neck, hugging him closer. Steve responded in kind, and Tony let out an amused little noise when Steve got a handful of his ass.
The best day of his life, Steve had called it once. Marrying the man he loved.
“So tell me I’m wrong, then!”
“Sir!” a voice came from the phone he hadn’t heard in two years. Steve stiffened, lowering Peter to the ground immediately.
“Yes.”
Steve looked Tony in the eye, unsure of what to say. “My therapist says I’m not allowing myself to move on.” He sighed. “I know it isn’t right, but I still love you, Tony. I’m jealous of Jackson. Every time I see the two of you together I feel like I’m interrupting something. I like him, I do, but it hurts me to see you two.”
Oh shit.
It had been a beautiful home. All glass windows, perched on a private lake that was dotted with lily pads, some large enough that a dog could curl up on one if it wanted.
Steve smiled, wishing more than ever that he could rush down there and embrace him. He had tears in his eyes too. “Okay, Pete.”
“It’s not,” Steve blubbered. “He doesn’t want to see me.”
Steve cracked a smile and grabbed the supplies as Blaine pulled up his sleeve.
He shivered as Tony’s warm mouth left his cock, and dimly remarked how it had been almost half a decade since he’d reached eleven orgasms in one day. Tony was sitting at four, but the last one had been with the assistance of drugs, Steve was sure. Technically all of them had, of course. Tony had popped his most recent round of pills while Steve was in the middle of fucking him. Didn’t even try to hide.  And Steve didn’t care.
“So Steve was the ‘dad’ dad, yet you said that you aren’t very close to him anymore. Can I ask how that came to be?”
“Steve, your friend doesn’t laugh at my jokes,” Sam said with a pout. “I know they’re funny so I think he’s just got a stick up his ass.”
A shimmer ran over Blaine’s form before his body disappeared altogether, save for a few refractions of light that didn’t look quite right.
“So you’re siding with him,” Steve said gravely. He leaned back in his chair. “I don’t need to hear anything else. Just do whatever you’re going to do to me.”
Tony didn’t reply. But he did roll over to face Steve, propping himself up on an elbow.
“What are you going to do to me?”
Well, he was never good at deflecting compliments. Tony just stood there a moment, then lifted a hand.
Bucky hoisted up the rifle and set her down facing the field beyond. “Yeah, there’s a reason.”
So that was why she sat next to him. Because everyone thought he was here to ruin Tony’s wedding. To stand up and make some stupid claim that he still loved Tony, like a goddamn romance movie.
A low rumble of thunder bellowed through the penthouse, rattling the priceless paintings on the walls. Steve wasn’t overly fond of storms, but he did appreciate the beauty of them. Right now, though, he was tempted to call in a favor from Thor to send the light and noises away.
“I’m asking you not to.”
Tony frowned, but gave a singular nod. “And it wasn’t like I suddenly didn’t care about you anymore. I know it probably seemed that way. But I couldn’t keep leading you on like that when I could feel that it wasn’t coming back.”
“He’s seen pictures,” Steve assured him. “You have grown a lot, though. Did you know you’re almost six inches taller than when we first came here?”
Harry and Peter burst out laughing.
Emory knocked him with his shoulder.
She let out a little sigh. “Please? I really would feel safer.”
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Nothin’ my ass.”
The sea was angry that day. Waves lashed at the sides of their battleship, sending frothy whiteness up onto the deck and spraying them all. They didn’t mind, because that day was  hot and sticky, like death. Suffocating. Steve remembered breathing in salt. He also remembered vomiting salt.  Just salt and stomach acid, nothing else. There was nothing else.
Tony remembered those calls. He used to be able to tell how difficult Steve’s day had been just by his tone of greeting, his choice of words. Now he couldn’t remember those cues and they had once been so ingrained in him that he could hear them in his dreams—and nightmares.
It looked…a bit unlike Morgan’s usual art. She was very smart, picking up on things many kids hadn’t—like the sky not just being a blue bar above the trees. But her drawing was just a bunch of sloping lines and circles all over the page. The color palette was nice – blue, purple, and red crayon.
“That’s…wow, Peter. That’s amazing,” Steve breathed. His son made that.
“I didn’t want her here when you got home,” Tony confessed, voice tight. “I wasn’t going to bombard you with that.”
He glanced at his phone to see that Tony wanted to meet in an hour. There had been a lot of times over the past year that Steve had ached for something like a lunch with Tony. Sometimes to scream at him, other times to apologize, and yes, sometimes to get back what they had lost.
Rhodey looked at him for a moment, blinked, and stood up.
He checked his timepiece again, then his phone. Nothing.
Steve told himself to look at it like a vacation. Malibu in springtime. He would be escaping the miserable weather in the north, staying in a nice hotel, and he’d get to see all of his friends in one place. That barely ever happened anymore.
Two years they’d spent in this tiny apartment in France. Two years he’d raised their son alone, but safe. Tony didn’t even know where they were, and this spot had been meticulously chosen to be busy but tucked away. A place where Peter could grow and still be a child instead of staying all but imprisoned in a small apartment.
Steve laughed to himself upon thinking that, and moved up a little more as the line moved.
Easy enough.
Suddenly Tony’s lips were on his, gentle and pressing. It wasn’t the type of kiss Steve was expecting—and he hadn’t been expecting a kiss at all. But as he closed his eyes and lifted his hands, he knew something wasn’t right. The rush of adrenaline settled in his throat, welling there and sticking. But he didn’t pull back. He knew this could very well be the last time he ever got the chance to have this, even if it wasn’t genuine. And he knew it wasn’t.
But tonight was all about art class graduation. Morgan’s biggest and best projects would be on display, and Tony couldn’t wait to see them. More so, he wanted to see how she interacted with her classmates. Whenever he dropped her off at class she would zoom right to a table of other kids, but she never talked about them. When he asked, she rolled her eyes. Teenage years were going to be fun, he could already tell.
“Goodnight, Tony,” he whispered.
Steve glanced at the elevator door, checking to make sure it hadn’t moved. No one was coming. Tony had to know he was here by now, and yet hadn’t appeared. His mysterious lover hadn’t either. And whoever they were, Tony was keeping evidence locked up tight somewhere.
Mrs. Freeman presented a drawing that Tony instantly recognized. He had a few black and white photos of angry waves in the living room, and Morgan had clearly based her drawings off of them. Once again it was mostly just swooping lines, but black paint had been sloshed across it. He wasn’t sure if Morgan had meant for the dumped paint to give it even more of a stormy wave feel, but it did.
“Call your son. Don’t come calling to try to make me feel bad for you anymore. He’s your kid, you tell him the bitter truth. At least have the balls to do that.”
of his oxygen system as it adjusted to the intake of air.
Tony wondered if Steve ever did that on accident before swiping open his phone.
Steve adjusted his bag, knowing full well this was a terrible idea. But the welling of warmth in his heart was so perfect. He was happy now. Why should he not let himself be happy?
Bucky had only said it about a hundred times at the bar, and Sam probably a dozen times more before he had left the bar with a nice girl. Bucky had gone back to his hotel, unable to sleep anywhere foreign that wasn’t at least ten stories up.
“I think we should do the fake relationship thing,” Tony finally confessed. His cheeks flushed, visible even in the low light.
Steve grinned. “Steve Rogers.”
Tony moved closer, his brown eyes ringed red, bloodshot. He was speaking, but Steve couldn’t hear.
A simple order.  They were all waiting for it, the instruction had been given about a hundred times for a hundred false alarms. The group shifted, churning within itself like a sand pit, men falling back and coming forward, no one wanting to be first.
“I don’t give you this and you’ll wake up and try to kill someone,” Blaine said evenly, pressing his thumb against the crook of Steve’s arm where the bump of a vein was visible. “Obviously, this dose would kill me, but I got some extra from Sharp just for you.”
They all started running and shoving, a stampede of men and guns. Steve cut out first, and leapt into the water. He expected to hit sand, but his boots went straight down, water swallowing him up to his waist. Too early. They had opened the door too early.
Seeing the good in someone was watching the life drain from their eyes and knowing he had done his job right. Good was completing the mission, making the shot, making the kill.
“Really? That’s fantastic!” Jackson exclaimed with a grin.
But as Vision sat back against his chair, he wondered if it was truly worth it.
“Won’t be,” Tony said. “That’s the thing, Steve. I’m waiting for him. Always. That’s not to say there can’t be someone else, but I know there won’t be.”
Steve was reeling now. That couldn’t be the mystery woman. That woman—what was her goddamned name?—had been cold with Tony, formal. Lawyer-like even in a private meeting. But then again, Steve wouldn’t be all that kind to the man in a pretend relationship with the man he loved.
Bucky’s eyes turned upward, and for a moment Tony could see the twenty six year-old kid who went from working in a shipyard to waging war in countries he probably couldn’t have even pointed out on a map a few months prior.
Of course, the church had its problems. Catholicism had plenty—so many that Steve only went to a Catholic mass on Christmas Eve and Easter, and that was mostly to appease his mother’s spirit.
“I know,” Steve soothed, resting his cheek against Tony’s head. “I’m here now, though. Forever, I promise.”
There wasn’t a use in him being here at all.
“Don’t worry about who I’m with, babe,” Tony said.
“You have to get that looked at, Rogers,” Blaine warned. “That can’t happen on mission. You’ll get us all killed.”
“I was for a stint, yeah,” Bruce muttered on the other end of the line. “But I think you’d be better off calling her actual doctor, Tony.”
She looked at him then, her smile bittersweet.
Blaine moved onto his stomach and Steve squeezed in beside him, grimacing as the branches scratched at his face.
“But I make it up those stairs, my whole day’s wages gone in one swoop, balancin’ three different kinds ‘a tonic,” Bucky continued, but the teasing tone was gone. “And get back in that dump of a flat, cover ya with two more blankets ‘cause you’re a punk who thinks he doesn’t get cold, and I stuff ya up with medicine ‘til you can’t hardly open your eyes.” His grip started to loosen on Steve’s forearm, but Steve didn’t pull away.
Wanda’s face was downcast. “I thought I knew, but maybe you know more than I do.”
He blinked and looked back over to Peter. He noticed Mary Jane smiling and dabbing her eyes with her napkin. She gave Steve a little wave of thanks.
“Yes, you do,” Wanda said, smiling down at her wine. “Tell me.”
The air didn’t seem so sticky anymore. It turned cold, the kind that clawed into your bones and filled the marrow.
“You’re making assumptions.”
“West side is clear. Repeat: West side is clear,” Cueball said hurriedly. “Can’t say for how long though.”
“You fell asleep,” Steve said, walking into the living room with a bowl of soup. He offered the bowl to Bucky. “Want soup?”
Steve stayed in his seat, not wanting to look like he didn’t want Ben to leave. “Of course. Hey, how about I give you my number? I’ll text you the name of the painting class place.” He smiled, smirking a little. “No pressure to go, if you don’t want to.”
“Stay quiet,” Steve murmured, peering out at the beach.
Tony nodded. “Yeah, I thought you might say that. And I can’t tell you what the reason is. But it’s personal to me, and it won’t harm anyone. In fact, it’s going to only be good for people.”
The new blood was cold in his veins, and it wasn’t long before Tony was laying a thick blanket over him to stop him from shaking. Steve tried to scream many times, but the fear rendered him mute with terror.
“You don’t believe me,” Tony said in mock disgust.
“Anyone could know that who looked deep enough in HYDRA’s history. You’re crafty enough to get in here, I think you’re capable of doing something like that.”
As the service closed, Steve said his prayers with an unsettling feeling in his gut. He’d done his duty—he’d extended his grace to Tony. Agreeing to be his fake boyfriend for potentially a full year? Yeah, he wasn’t afraid to say that was a big sacrifice. He was paying his debt and cleaning the slate. And if someone was going to make a grace argument, Tony was the one who was withholding.
“No, you need to know,” Rhodey said. “I’ve had a hard time living with this, and now it’s almost over. Tony kept experimenting without telling anyone. Tried every approach to get you—to get the Steves—to cooperate, made changes each time. The tech got better each time, the targeting system. I found out again, and just said fuck it. I convinced him not to fall into some batshit crazy fantasy of finding a copy of his Steve to keep like a pet. But we had to find a near-perfect genetic match for what we needed to do, which wasn’t easy. When we hit fifty, he said he’d given up, but he kept tweaking. When he pulled you…you’re the match.”
“I’m here for her too,” Steve said quietly. “And you.” He looked increasingly uncomfortable standing there with everyone watching him, but Tony took some pleasure in watching him squirm. Maybe that was cruel, but he’d been under the impression this man wanted nothing to do with him until a few minutes ago.
Candice was Peter’s surrogate mother.
Steve smiled and set the soup bowl on his lap. He turned his head and Bucky found himself without breath, because fuck were his eyes big and blue. “I’m just really happy I’ll have my friends around for the next few months.” He licked his lips and let out a chuckle. “Happy to have them around and not have a mission, I mean. I think it’ll be great.”
“Grab the dog and the body. Hurry up,” he muttered over his shoulder.
The Tower wasn’t a permanent residence for any of the Avengers, but when threat levels were high, they found it easier to move into Stark Tower—now Avengers Tower.
“Oh come on—”
“And you, Captain?” the robot asked.
His dreams were narrated by those seething, foamy breaths that had been Blaine’s last.
Blaine didn’t say anything for a moment and Steve could feel the heat of the distant explosions as the compound burned. He dimly remembered the emergency backup plan. Even though they were expendable, even though they could be replaced, the military took care of its own. They made sure their boys came home, even if it meant burning cities to the ground.
He was about to lose everything. His entire life was about to walk out on him, hating him and cursing every memory they had ever shared. Loss shredded into his heart, cutting him down without hesitancy or celebration.
Tony nodded, glad he’d found something to get her mind off of things. “Absolutely.” He glanced up as their valet walked toward them. “All right, kiddo. Time to go.”
Steve shouldered Tony away. The last thing he wanted right now was sex. “I missed you too, but I don’t want to have sex tonight. I want to catch up with you.”
“Bucky?” Tony asked, though he knew who it was. “Is this a bad time?”
“I don’t remember what day it was—but it was springtime. It was like a movie. Everything glowed—there was like some sort of cinematic dream effect on everything, or maybe that’s just how I remember it now. But I remember waking up, I remember looking over to see that you were already awake, all thoughtful and looking over a briefing or something. And I remember feeling nothing. But some kind of omnipresent nothing—a nothing that came with the expectation of something else. Like a fucked-up dream. Y’know, when the floodgates open and all that ooey-gooey warm fuzzy stuff is supposed to flow, except
Tony’s laugh was a joyous sound. It didn’t bring Steve any pain in that moment.
“You should call him. He would want to hear from you.”
Of course, Steve dodged it and it splatted against the vinyl of the seat. Steve Rogers had just shot a spitball at him. What a fucking world.
Bucky pushed him back a little and looked him over with sad eyes. “I wish I coulda been there,” he murmured. “I wish I coulda done somethin’ to stop this.”
Tony sat up, cheeks still flushed from sex as he reached out for the robe to inspect it.
Vision frowned. “I think I would rather fall from the peak. At least that way you will have lived what would have only ever been fantasy had you stopped at the foundation. You would have something to cherish before meeting your demise.”
Of course, it was a pretty much completely open floor plan, so the living room wasn’t actually a separate room at all. Steve took a big breath, trying to keep it quiet just in case Friday was monitoring him for signs of weakness or something to bolster Tony’s ego.
“You’re spacing again,” Tony murmured, stepping up to him and framing Steve’s face with his hands. “Wanna talk?”
Something rammed into his right side and suddenly Steve was truly soaring as he miscalculated his dodge.
He set Tony down after a moment, looking into his eyes. Dark, warm. Nothing like the bright blue he’d seen during his time away. Steve’s hands framed Tony’s face, thumbing at his perfect cheeks, unable to stop smiling. It was really him.
“You won’t, but I know you’re always prepared anyway.”
“They’re coming, don’t worry about that,” Steve growled. “Was kinda hoping I’d have this room finished to serve them in. Or should I go to whatever supermodel’s house you’ve been staying at this week?”
“Natasha asked if I could run point on this mission she’s cooking up. Wanted to—”
Steve almost started looking around to see if he was being mistaken for someone else. He barely knew MJ. They had seen each other only a few dozen times, as she had lived closer to Tony.
was…perfect somehow.
“Hey! Steve, come back here right—“
He sat on the mattress okay.
The ghostly hiss of the waves only served to distance Steve from what he was doing as his palm came to cup Tony’s jaw, as his thumb stroked the curve of Tony’s cheekbone.
Steve frowned. He didn’t like that such a simple text made his insides churn with irritation. It felt like Tony was just trying to rub it in that he was still upset—undoubtedly exactly what Tony was doing. Some days, like today, it didn’t even feel like they were dating. If they even were anymore. They hadn’t been on a date in weeks.
He sat back in his chair, nearly falling to the floor thanks to how forward he’d been sitting. Approved. He hadn’t ever expected to hear those words, and he’d been too afraid to look into the next steps because that always seemed to guarantee failure.
“No, he doesn’t,” Steve muttered, trying once more to pull away.
“I’ll have some orange juice,” said Harry.
“You don’t have to,” Steve said. “It’s helpful, but she’ll feel cold. It’s pretty uncomfortable, even if it helps the most.”
“Thinking about what’s waiting for me when I go home.” He wouldn’t bother to hide it.
Well shit. This was not going to end well.
Tony let out a sigh. “Is pursuing somebody seven months after a breakup still considered a rebound?”
He rolled out from beneath the car, uncaring that oil was still gushing from the crack in the oil pan he had created only moments ago. Peter problems came first, and clearly he was having an issue with something.
“You are absolutely right,” Tony said with a peck to Morgan’s forehead. He lowered her down and took her hand. He wasn’t even going to try to process what he’d just heard. Or anything about tonight, actually.
“Aren’t you nerv—“ He retched again, doubling over and wishing like hell that he had eaten more before he getting on the plane.
Tony stood too, crossing his arms. “If we can convince them. If
Bucky stormed across the lawn, his metal arm glinting in the morning sun. “You okay?”
Tony did. Stupid question.
Steve smiled slightly, his eyes falling closed again. “And you don’t love me.”
Emory was just a kid.
“I know,” he finally replied, not looking Rhodey in the eye. “I’m not gonna go after him or anything. It’s not really worth it. Last thing I need is an ex running my company and an ex on my team.”
Tony’s eyes narrowed. “I’m not here to talk to you. I’m here for my kid, Steve.”
Steve thought he had misheard. “I didn’t hear you, what?”
This was one of the moments where he was glad Steve had been gone so long. It wasn’t right, the way he felt sometimes, even if Steve had come out and said he liked dames just as much as he liked fellas.  Bucky remembered how he used to be with women and how damn good it felt to have a girl’s legs wrapped around his hips, but he hadn’t just been with women. He gathered that Steve knew that, more or less, though he never talked about it. A few times, it had come up. A few times, Steve had let something slip.
“Maybe it is, but maybe it isn’t,” Bucky replied, arms crossed. “Just be careful out there, okay? Don’t make me get arrested again because I gotta cross borders to save your ass.”
There was no signature, and there didn’t need to be. Iron Man’s helmets were unique, created with metal alloys only he knew how to make.
Blaine set two beers down on the table and a basket of some sort of fried bar food. Probably an attempt to please the young American tourists crawling all over this place.
Before long, they had left town and were close to home, never once slowing. Mile after mile, turn after turn, Steve only pushed faster, his lungs screaming and his heart roaring in his chest. He lengthened his lead, his eyes only focused on the ground ahead and nothing more.
It had been a big subject of debate to decide which supers would be giving up their identities. Steve had no issue announcing himself to the team. Many people knew who he was in the public sphere as well, given that all of his documents had been declassified after he went in the ice. Some chose to keep their personal lives completely separate. Iron Man had said once that he had a past, and as the unofficial leader of the team, he didn’t want to be  seen as lesser than. He’d told that to Steve in confidence, and even Steve didn’t know his true identity. Iron Man was a private person, an incredible mind, and was one of the few supers that Steve could see surviving well on his own.  Most importantly, Iron Man was his friend in a dwindling pool.
Tony smiled at him, his eyes alight with genuine fondness.
A vacation, maybe. Or a fancy restaurant with one of those visual menus. Or maybe a trip to Europe—that would be perfect, really. They’d gone on their first trip as a couple to Europe.
Tony’s smile twitched with a glimpse of something like despair. But he nodded.
“You weren’t fucking invited, Steve. I didn’t want you to come here and ruin everything like you always fucking do.”
Tony smiled a little. “It’s been a little while. And besides, I’m just supposed to assume a Steve from an alternate dimension can’t get infections either?”
kid even care.”
“Of course someone likes you. He’s coming to my New Years party. And I think he’s hot, so you don’t have to worry about him not being attractive,” Tony said, smiling around the rim of his coffee mug.
“What’s the last thing he said?”
“So tell him.”
A chorus of barking began at the side of the house and Steve laughed as three Golden Retrievers and a German Shepherd raced from the side yard, all of them sopping wet.
The kid sitting beside him was his. That blew his mind on a daily basis.
The room was a mess, from the spoiled food sitting on the bookshelf to the torn posters on the walls.
“Well, you two get settled in and I’ll get the boys to unpack,” Steve said with a little nod.
Because he knew Steve was a hopeless romantic, and he also knew Steve liked to torture himself.
It was the little moments. The ones he didn’t remember with own father.
Blaine pulled off the cap of a syringe, holding it between his teeth as he checked to make sure the solution inside was free of air bubbles.
It was fucked up how they had to be stranded on a deserted island to have this conversation. Probably to save Tony some pride, or maybe because he didn’t want someone else to see them together. Steve never really suspected Tony left him for anyone—that much was true now, since Tony had never spoken of anyone else. Then again, Tony knew Steve still loved him. He probably wouldn’t say anything until there was no way to hide it anymore.
“It’s not like—”
They entered the coffee shop ahead of the tourists because the barista recognized Steve. Locals got special service lines here.
Too late to run.
“I thought I had more time before,” Tony muttered. “I was told a year.”
Bucky shook his head. “Nah, I know. I know.”
Thank god.
Steve couldn’t speak.
One of the sailors said that the boat had strayed off course a few feet because the wind was so bad. The Germans had been preparing for this invasion for a while. They had the whole place rigged up with mines. Steve had seen the rough sketches that their intel had given them, but none of these men had that authority. Even the Major, whose face was now freckled with blood, probably had no idea what ominous devices lurked all around them beneath the waves.
Tony blinked. “Uh, yeah, since like—“
“So,” Tony said, “I know nobody really pays attention to these speeches anyway, but, from Jackson and I, we wish you the best of luck in your future together. We love you both more than anything.” He raised his glass. “Cheers.”
“What? You don’t even know the dates yet, Steve.”
Boone let out a grunt as Blaine kicked him in the calf.  “She left a really hot message.
Aside from training new recruits, he was also in charge of testing them. HYDRA had given him numerous skills (thinking about how bad a soldier he had been back in World War II made him cringe), and he had taken it upon himself to train his students to a similar caliber. Enhanced enemies were becoming a greater threat, and, having been one himself, Bucky knew what lengths they would go to complete the mission. No corners could be cut.
Steve couldn’t fight the stinging guilt, the anger that pricked him afterward. He wasn’t sure he’d ever be able to get past what happened in Sibera—not with Tony, at least. Sometimes it felt dooming, other times it felt like a challenge. Surely someday he could be truly good again in Tony’s eyes.  Wasn’t that the reason he agreed to this mess in the first place?
“Hey!”
Steve raised a brow, but didn’t comment. He’d read Jane Eyre in preparation for this paper the week before, and he certainly hadn’t seen her love as lacking. He wrote a little note in red pen to remind himself what his thoughts were later on when they talked about it, and then ticked off a few misplaced commas. Grammar wasn’t actually his strong suit, but he knew what proper sentences were supposed to look like just from the amount of books he’d read in his lifetime.
Oh, the nerve of this fucking—
“And what happens when you find someone else?” Steve asked. It was a question he’d been asked a thousand times by everyone who knew them. Because it was one thing to still love a Tony who didn’t love anyone else, but it was an entirely new form of pain to love a man who loved another. “I still get to play pretend that I’m your favorite now. I get to delude myself as much as I want to try to deal with this. But everything is going to come crashing down when you’re with someone else.”
I lost sight of a lot of things when I realized you weren’t coming back to me. I continued to believe that one day you would show up and all of it would be over. I would have forgiven you, Steve. I wish I could say I forgive you now, but I don’t. I can’t. I can’t forgive you for loving me so much and then taking it all away.
She’d only been with him a week when Steve’s letter arrived, and stepping into fatherhood cold was a lot more stressful than he’d anticipated, even though he’d spent the previous month reading every book he could get his hands on and watching about fifty thousand YouTube videos with tips and tricks for everything from eating vegetables to stitching up ripped teddy bears.
“Please,” Franklin said. “Would you come with us? Maria’s parents are outside. I’d feel safer if we had an escort. I’m sure Mare would too.”
Steve chuckled. “Not for long. Daddy knows a lot of French.”
But Tony did have to pull away after several heated kisses, though he did so reluctantly. “Gotta get back out there, babe.” He carded his fingers through Steve’s hair, trying to fix it up a little bit. But it would be hard to hide the red of his lips where Tony’s teeth had been, the flush to his cheeks and that goofy grin. “Will you come home with me?” he asked, taking Steve’s hand as they left the art room.
Before he realized what happened, Bucky’s metal hand was clasped around Steve’s wrist. Pure reflexes, residual from a life of survival and carnage and blood. Bucky knew that, but it didn’t make him feel any better that his body still had control of him.
“Yes,” Steve said, determined.
His hold around his spoon was white-knuckled.
Bucky didn’t move. “Goodnight, Tony.”
“I did,” Tony said distractedly.
He owed Tony a thank-you. For raising their son and letting him pursue his dreams at his own pace. A young scientist already featured in magazines worldwide, but still in the same year of school as the rest of the people his age. Tony had really learned from his childhood mistakes to turn Peter into far more than a chubby-cheeked baby boy.
His chest twisted up and started to wring his tear ducts, but he refused to cry in front of Peter. So he swallowed hard, putting his hands beneath the table to keep Peter from noticing how hard they were shaking.
Steve took the familiar weight into his hand, then slung the backpack on with practiced ease, even going to far as to clip it at his waist, just in case the trip wasn’t as seamless as his arrival.
“You’re damn right,” Peter snapped. Steve wanted to close his eyes to see if that would stop the peeling of his long-healed scars. Peter cleared his throat. “Captain America ruined my father’s legacy. We could have been decades ahead of where we are today if Cap would have recognized that he was slowing my father down.”
Tony smiled. “Not getting cold feet, are you?”
“Bucky said Pops couldn’t come to the phone.”
He smoothed back Morgan’s damp hair and forced himself to take one step back. Nothing he could do now. He had to step back. He had to.
The cracks of gunshots grew louder and louder until they were constant and in every direction, penning them in.
“Technically I just di—”
Class 7 missions weren’t exactly uncommon. They were the highest classification for risk of death or injury, which usually meant they required only two to three people and had some kind of tactical challenge.
“You can always come home,” Bucky said quietly.
Steve frowned. “Bucky…”
“Good to see you too, Nat,” Tony shouted after her.
He nodded, gently knocking her gloves with his taped knuckles. “See you tomorrow.”
Steve cleared his throat. “See, um. Tony and I don’t sleep in the same bed. I live in Brooklyn, he lives at the tower. I mean we have, before—but nothing like that. Just. Just sleeping.”
Steve eyes rolled in his skull as another flashback—if it could be called that—seared through his head. That tiny hand, the way Tony’s skin had started to blister and peel. They way his eyes…
“I mean, he’s handsome and he’s nice. And he’s pretty much the most badass guy on the team, not to mention he’s just downright generous and all that, but yeah, not worth it. He’s actually a good friend of mine.”
Steve buried his face into the join of Tony’s neck and shoulder, shaking with something between a laugh and a sob. He was home.
Tony met his eyes then, holding his gaze long enough that Steve felt his cheeks start to turn hot.
“Oh, Peter, it’s all right,” Steve soothed, hugging Peter a little tighter. “Just keep me updated, okay? Maybe we can grab lunch sometime during the summer and you can tell me everything that’s happening.”
That was all Steve needed to know.
“Another soda?”
“Clear!” Emory echoed, and the rest of the team filed in.
Steve sighed. “You’re right, you’re right.” He supposed it wouldn’t be so bad. It had been quite a while since he’d had Tony sleeping beside him. Natasha was actually his most recent bed partner—they had shared a bed a lot while they were on the run.
“Leaving so soon?” Steve said as he pulled on a pair of sweats still on the floor from the afternoon before.
“And with Qatar.”
“C’mon, kiddo, you’re gonna be late.” Tony handed over Morgan’s little lunchbox as she came flying around the corner of the kitchen island. Tony had picked out a lovely purple dress for her—velvet—with a little white collar and matching white sunhat. Pepper said she looked like Madeline, but Tony thought she looked adorable, even if that was true. Morgan seemed to love  it, and that was all that mattered.
Tony turned. “What?”
“Can we catch a plane tonight?”
“I am glad to see my plan as worked,” Thor said with a grin.
Peter laughed, turning to MJ. “God, remember when your mom met Jackson?”
“Hey, Pete,” he greeted, leaning back against his worktable and flexing his fingers.
Steve smiled. “You’re being a little bit of a creep, maybe.”
“I don’t want you to wait for me, though,” Steve said, and he couldn’t believe the words coming out of his mouth. He barely knew this Tony—he’d been here for less than a week and now he was talking about coming back?
Winona frowned. “You didn’t seem to think that before.”
“Good for you?” Tony asked, his voice a bit hoarse. He was behind Steve again, hands on his ass, rubbing everywhere he could reach. Probably peaking this most recent high.
“It’s alcoholic,” Tony snapped. “I’m getting drunk, Viz.”
“And what about Steve?” Rhodey’s brow quirked. “Oh, right, you haven’t told him yet. That’s not important or anything.”
“Am I gonna like this coffee?” Tony asked awhile later, after they drove past the shop to look for a place to park.
Steve didn’t have a sweetheart during the war (and Peggy couldn’t really be considered his sweetheart, as much as he had wanted her to be at the time), but the stories at mail call were endless.
“I don’t give a flyin’ fuck what you do and don’t know, Stark. I said it’s nothin’ to worry about, so shut up about it. Ain’t like you or
“Just like that?” Steve asked. “Haven’t they been here for a month?”
He knew Candice had a legal right to her baby, but Steve wasn’t sure what he would do if she took Peter. Probably something bad.  Nobody was going to touch his son. If Candice tried to take him and raise him, Steve was pretty sure he would kidnap him and take him back. He didn’t care if it was illegal. Peter was his son.
“Don’t call me that.” He hadn’t heard that in a few decades.  “I’m nowhere that concerns you or Peter.”
“Monitors in each room, at the ready for movements as necessary,” Francine replied. “Attempted sweep by Stark’s security bots was successfully avoided via Steve’s personal belongings protocols.”
Peter groaned, pushing at his face with his little hands.
“Do you want to take more pictures down?” Steve asked.
It was his voice. Tony hadn’t heard it in months now, not in that soft cadence that said personal not professional. Warm in place of distance.
It was Steve’s turn to snort. “I would not.”
“How long have you been living here again, Steve?” Jackson asked, turning a little to look at him over the back of the chair.
“Six hundre’ yars wiff a tracker. Fat’s gotta be a record,” Emory said around his food.
Once they were situated in the Escalade with Happy, Steve felt Tony relax.
“You’re asking me about a mission for Steve?”
After a few more attempts to free himself, he fell limp, barely registering the world as he was taken through the streets of Mykonos hooked in the arms of two of his best friends. He didn’t hear Sam, but he knew he would show up before too long. All three of them were going to become witness to one of his dramatic episodes.
Nuts. Nobody said ‘nuts’ anymore. Goddammit, Steve. Tony rolled his head to give Steve a look that said ‘nice one, old man.’
Steve frowned and moved over to sit at one of the empty tables. Blaine was right.
“This one’s going in the lab,” he announced, looking over the picture again. He owned a museum’s worth of art, and none of it touched the piece of construction paper in his hands. A year ago he wasn’t even sure he’d be able to adopt at all, let alone find the perfect daughter. So many things had been uncertain. And Steve had been the key to finding what he wanted most. Steve, who had rested a comforting hand on his back and started to rub gently.
a little crush thing, then maybe we could go from there, but—“
“That’s great, Tony,” Steve said. “I’m glad.”
“No, Tony. I’d really like for you to leave now,” Steve whispered with a sniff. “You aren’t supposed to be in here anyway.”
Steve squeezed the trigger.
Steve knew he was supposed to stand up for himself, but he also knew that Peter would just see it as proving his point, that he just wanted all of the attention on himself. Maybe that was true. And no greater punishment for his wrongdoing was worse than his own son cutting him down without hesitation.  He brought a hand to his mouth, cursing himself when his tears welled over and tracked down his cheeks.
Steve just shook his head, his tear ducts somehow still functioning. “I’m disgusting,” he whispered. “All I’ve ever done is hurt the both of them.”
No, Steve never wanted to touch that life again.
“Well, apparently I’m stuck in my fictional world,” Steve chuckled.
Yet the more he thought about it, the more he couldn’t remember. His mind just kept skipping to waking up in Steve’s bed with less clothing than he’d started the night with.
“That’s for scaring me,” Tony breathed when he pulled away.  He adjusted his collar and cleared his throat. “We’ll talk. I’ll send you some numbers tomorrow.”
“Not you,” Steve said, holding Blaine’s gaze.
Tony shoved his duffel toward Steve. “I’m not as nice as him.”
“Hey, Steve,” he greeted, like it was normal to find Steve Rogers shirtless on the track at four in the morning.
Tony closed his eyes, tears wetting his cheeks anew as he nodded slowly, shakily. When he replied, it was so quiet Steve wouldn’t have heard it if the room hadn’t been so goddamn silent:
But he didn’t like the way the penthouse was evolving without Steve there. Morgan’s toys started to pile up in odd corners, and he was usually too tired to pick them up when he was stumbling to bed. She was a bright little thing, and sometimes liked to show him just how bright she was by hiding toys in places she wasn’t supposed to be in the first place.
Before he even realized it, Steve had hung up his phone. The color drained from his face and he staggered to the closest empty chair before putting his head in his hands.
Tony suddenly wished he could be one of these children and run to hide behind the legs of someone bigger than him, someone who would send Steve away. But instead he could only watch as Steve came closer and closer, as his daughter gripped Steve’s hand like maybe he’d just missed out on the whole part where he and Steve had gotten back together and were co-parenting.
“That means we gotta shower again, and I gotta replace the—fuck—the sheets again,” Steve tried to argue.
Tony’s voice, thick with sleepiness.
Steve just kept staring at him.
The Navy commander’s face turned stone, and he pointed toward a soaked sailor gripping the guardrail for dear life.
Steve waved. “Hey, Buck. Didn’t know you were visiting.”
It didn’t.
“You always do this to him. Every time he sees you, he ends up miserable. It took Jackson a week to get him back to normal after we visited last summer,” Peter hissed. “He’s just trying to move on and you act like he’s turned his back on us.”
to him again.
“You’re unbelievable,” Tony breathed, shaking his head. “Unbelievable.”
Tony’s eyes widened or a moment. “Wait,” he said, turning on his heel and dashing back toward the lab.
He was getting old.
Tony yanked his phone away, stepping back as he started to text someone. “I’m listening.”
Even so, the anguish he felt did not puncture all of him. It did not puncture the parts that longed for the itch of sand against his skin and the raw pain of a well-timed punch to his jaw and the exhaustion that left his bones rattling and his eyes bloodshot. No pain reached there. In fact, it made him want to lung and grab Peter by the throat and explain to him in excruciating detail what all he had sacrificed. He had never felt that urge so strongly before.
Maria looked like she might slap her husband for a moment, but then her expression changed. She didn’t say anything.
“It is pretty convenient in times like this,” Steve said dryly, slinging his rifle up onto the log. “Do we have an EVAC?”
“Copy that,” Cueball replied. “They’re currently heading southeast toward the gate.”
“He’ll sabotage himself every time,” Bucky murmured. “He wants to show up. Every week he’s gotten so close to stepping out the door. But he has a lot of pride. He got rejected a lot when he was a scrawny stick of a kid. Still carries that with him, even if he doesn’t think so.”
“…say so now or forever hold your peace,” Happy said.
The first comparison to his wedding.
He sent the text with a little smile curling at his lips, but an ache in his heart.
The cabin was completely silent except for the jostling of equipment as they fought the wind. Even the blades of the heli-jet were silent thanks to Stark reactor technology. That was why these things were called OWLs, though Steve didn’t actually remember the meaning of the acronym. Operation something.
“Conversation appears to be ending,” Friday finally informed him almost an hour later.
“Come on,” Steve said with a shrug toward the shower. “We’ll find something to do in there.”
“Dog! Dog!”
Francine didn’t answer right away. “Yes, sir.”
“I do know how fevers work,” Tony muttered. He’d only researched practically every study ever done on them while she got worse. He was fairly certain he’d know more than whatever doctor her took her to at urgent care.
Tony sat down next to him and Steve immediately leaned away.
He cut himself off, swallowing hard.
The phone rang a few times, but then someone picked up. They didn’t say hello, and there was a lot of barking in the background.
Her tone reminded him of his third dissertation. He’d been too drunk to remember much of that one, but this all sounded sickeningly familiar.
“Do your thing,” Iron Man said. “Sorry, Steve. Things were looking hairy for a minute, thought we’d need more help.”
Something screamed in the air above them and suddenly he was on his back in the snow with Blaine leaning over him.
“Good luck,” Steve snorted.
He was stalling. Rhodey just didn’t know it yet.
“It’s not, and we’re over. I just regret how it happened.” The one-two punch. The breakup, then the betrayal in Siberia. Steve couldn’t recover from that and he knew it. He really didn’t blame Tony for that part of things: he wasn’t sure he’d be able to forgive if the tables were turned.
The man smiled, and it was Tony’s smile. Except this guy was about twenty years younger than the real Tony Stark. Same facial hair, though.  “It’s me, Cap. It’s Tony.”
Well. Today was just full of surprises. Tony was fairly certain he’d lost all the color in his face, because Steve started to look horrified.
“I’m not worried about your contact,” Steve said. “I’m worried about the area. Everything is so packed together, the group of us is going to stick out. Someone will recognize us, then our cover will be blown.”
“Steve,” Tony said, right on cue.
It was at that moment that Tony realized he hadn’t visited this floor in over a year. He kept his gaze firm on the boiling pasta. No need to get sentimental here.
Nikolai rested his muzzle comfortably on Steve’s shoulder as he just breathed slow. A coastal breeze caressed them, blowing away the sticky heat for a moment, allowing Steve to feel less like he was suffocating.
Morgan gave him big puppy eyes full of concern, and damn if it didn’t melt his heart. He took her hand and gave her knuckles a kiss in promise.
Tony froze, momentarily deciding whether or not he should drop the blanket and run.
“Fine,” he finally said. “I won’t text him this week. Or next. I’ll let him…make his decision or whatever.”
“Since when are you on our feed?” Iron Man snapped.
and he wants you!” Steve cried. A low noise left his throat, one he’d never made before. It sounded like someone dying.
“Can I at least get your name?” Maria asked as Steve escorted her down a hallway, firmly gripping her by the elbow. She kept looking around and it made him nervous.

Wanda set her glass of wine aside, lost in thought. “It wouldn’t be so bad if it didn’t cause Steve so much pain.”
“So, what, you’re just a pretty face? You aren’t that good looking, Rhodes.”
MJ extended her hand to show off a spectacular ring of what looked like white gold and rubies. Far from the amateurish thing Steve had expected.
Jeeze. Maybe Steve was a worse boyfriend than he’d realized.
But he froze when he heard Tony’ voice, angry and sharp.
“I love you,” Steve said as their lips parted.
Just Cap, the Commander said. Quick and easy mission. They just needed Cap for the newsreels. The papers.
Though as they walked back into the exhibit room, Steve’s sole competition was standing there with children hanging off of him like Christmas ornaments, wearing Morgan’s sunhat cocked on his head.
The air was sucked right out of his throat. The words on the page in front of him went out of focus as Steve tried to process what he’d just been told. Peter didn’t want to live with him this summer. Steve had planned to take him to D.C. for a week to hang out with SHIELD scientists, so he could get a look into the field beyond Oscorp. He’d been trying so hard lately to rebuild what he’d once had with Peter as a child, but it seemed the older they got, the more Peter connected with Tony and disconnected with him.
“Four targets, two o’clock,” Steve hissed.
Steve leaned in, but Tony pulled back, wiggling his finger at Steve. “Nope. No peeking.”
Steve chuckled, but shook his head. “Nah. Forget it—I obviously did.”
“I’ll tell him,” Tony said again, and this time it sounded like it might actually be genuine.
Steve watched as Sam flew in, throwing Ant Man into the gills of the creature while Hulk held it up.
And really, if Steve was going to come back into their lives, he would’ve done it by now. It was one thing to take time, it was another to take months and miss vital parts of Morgan’s growth—especially if he planned on co-parenting as Tony’s husband someday.
Tony unclasped his restraints, and Steve immediately curled up on the chair like a frightened child. Not that frightened child—goddammit. He let out a whimper, but it didn’t sound like it was even coming from him.
Steve let out a snort. “I don’t treat people with respect who make unnecessarily stupid choices and risk my friends’ lives for no reason.”
“Overwatch, give me something. What can you see in there?” Blaine asked.
Their relationship was a lot of this now. Steve never asked him hard questions—the ones the therapists asked. Steve just asked how he was feeling, if he needed anything, if he wanted to go anywhere. Kind of like Bucky was sick. In a way, he was, he supposed.
“Lickity-split,” Peter repeated, feeling the words out on his tongue.
He fought the urge to roll his eyes. “What, Stark Industries’ shit? Please. Peter Stark would turn over everything he and his father ever created if you paid him enough.”
“I can sleep on the floor,” Steve offered.
But he watched her walk down the alleyway and just before she turned the corner and out of sight, his finger shifted and he touched the metal scythe at his fingertip, running down the little curve but never firing.
Tony listened on about Rhodey’s night out with a Finnish model, but in the back of his mind he was unsure about what he was going to do. Realistically, he knew trying to get with Steve was a bad idea. And his crush thing wasn’t that big anyway, and very easy to stomp down when he had to. Up until now, things had been fine.
“I have to go,” he said abruptly. “Let me know if you need anything.”
Steve sighed. “I love you too.”
Blaine set down his beer and stepped away, but only a few paces. He returned with some napkins and handed them over. “Wipe off your mouth. You really don’t want phlegm in your beard,” he said, rubbing his stubbly chin as if to show Steve how to do it.
Natasha let out a sigh. “Fine. I’ll see about finding a safe place outside of the city.”
Bucky reluctantly pulled back and gave Steve’s shoulder a rub. They locked eyes and Steve was so tempted to look away, but managed to hold the stare.
He wouldn’t give up this life for anything. He had everything he had ever wanted. More than everything he had ever wanted. He had Tony and he had Peter, their son. They both loved him. Nothing would ever change that.
That was confirmation enough.
angry about something. Usually him.
“You know
“No, it’s okay,” Tony said gently. “You did get through it. I’m sure it was terrible for you. It was terrible for us too, and let me tell you, there are few things worse than finding out your husband has been keeping a secret from you for years.”
Steve’s eyes flicked open, and he was surprised to find Tony awake and alert, tablet in hand. He rested against the headboard, tapping away.
“I got two over here,” another soldier called.
Steve supposed it didn’t really matter if Tony loved him back—they had clearly tested that one.
“Trying to,” Steve replied with a chuckle. He wasn’t sure why it came out sounding like something bad.
It was true. Steve had taken a long time to ask Tony to go to a game with him precisely because he knew Tony didn’t like baseball, so he’d been more than surprised when Tony showed up decked out in Dodgers gear, and it had taken a full hour for Steve to figure out that Tony hadn’t just memorized every baseball fact he could think of and instead had them scrolling across his sunglasses at will.
Their drinks were presented at the bar, and Tony snatched them both up before heading to a table. One of the smaller tables that restaurants seemed to design to purposefully aid two people in getting comfortable sharing one space. Not that Steve would need any aid there.
“A call, sir.”
I am an American –
“I don’t want you in my life. I don’t want you in Dad’s life. The only reason you’re here is because MJ loves you because I didn’t have the heart to tell her that Captain America is such a shitty person underneath the mask,” Peter snarled, but he was crying too. “Don’t walk down the aisle tomorrow thinking that things are going to change just because I’m getting married. You left this family.”
And then the humiliation in court as Tony glared at him while his lawyers shredded him in front of a room full of cameras, press, and civilians. The anguish of Peter saying he didn’t want to stay the summer. The hatred in Tony’s voice and in Peter’s.
Suddenly Peter was right in his face and Steve had no choice but to look into his eyes. The eyes that he always saw on a chubby little boy that liked to chew on blocks and thought paint was something to splash people with. Now they were dark brown pits of loathing and utter hatred. The eyes Steve knew would never leave his mind as long as he lived.
They would eat good food, dance, have fun when everyone got drunk (except Tony, Steve, and Thor—and maybe Jackson) and then everyone would hang out again the day after to soak up the sun before Tony and Jackson headed off to wherever for their honeymoon.
His own son didn’t even consider him family anymore. His own son didn’t even tell him about the important things in his life that apparently everyone else knew. His own son didn’t even want to see him after seven months apart.
Blaine pulled out a new syringe and another bottle of solution.
for Steve.
Tony looked over at Steve. He barely remembered that night, but he did recall how quickly the glass of non-alcoholic wine had made him feel very much drunk. He also remembered finding his way to Steve, Steve finding his way to him, and tumbling into the back of the car that night. The rest of his memory was foggy, but he did know what had happened. At least, he was pretty sure.
“I haven’t planned for anything involving you,” Tony returned with a bit of an edge. “I want you to stick around, but I won’t blame you if you go.”
Tony never asked why Steve wasn’t at the wedding. He never asked why Steve had not spoken to Peter since that day. Even though they were grandparents now. Even though Steve had not met his grandchildren and one of them was already out of college.
“I’m sorry,” he murmured.
But he had a hard time imagining this Tony doing something like that. It was selfish, maybe, but this Tony would cherish him. Make sure never to let him go. There would be no mistaking any of Tony’s actions for ones indicative of a man falling out of love.
But for what?
Steve didn’t know what to do for a moment, so he just stood there stupidly before awkwardly hugging her back.
at him.
Tony snatched his arm and Steve nearly clocked him on reflex. “Steve.”
a piece of shit that begs for attention by cutting up his arms—don’t you even
Tonight, everything would be okay. He would tuck a daughter who loved him into her bed with a kiss goodnight, and slip into his own sheets with the man he’d waited for all his life. He would wake up next to that man in the morning, and say he loved him too.
His own son didn’t recognize him.
As he approached the tower lobby, it occurred to him that Tony might be long gone, that Stark Industries was now run by one of his kids, or by someone else entirely. But something told him that wasn’t the case. He couldn’t explain it, but he just knew Tony was still around.
He threw the hand over the side. Part of a leg was tossed over too.
“Course I can. How do you think we lasted as long as we did?” Tony returned with a snort. In the scheme of things, they hadn’t been together all that long. They weren’t some married couple that watched their world burn away. They had been two people who had become two very different people all at once. That kind of pain never healed, not fully.
This feeling was a hollow version of the one he felt before. Before, an inkling of this feeling would prompt a kiss. The slightest whisper of this feeling would have him resting his forehead against Tony’s, sharing his breaths.
Captain America would be gone without a trace, literally. No survivor to carry on the Rogers family name, the awful genes.
Steve scrunched his nose when Tony kissed his cheek, shivering at the warm wash of breath over his ear. Tony snuggled close again, draping an arm over him, and Steve turned his head to breath in the scent of Tony’s shampoo.
A LOOK BACK:
“My apartment,” Steve replied. “You okay?”
Steve gazed out at the bleached blue sky, absently knocking his boot heels together in the wind.
Tony hung up before Bruce could finish, and gave Morgan a kiss to the crown of her head.  She didn’t stir, not even when he rested his cheek against her forehead. Still hot, and she was burning up in his lap.
“I’m sixteen! I can make my own decisions!”
Steve leaned over the edge of a rooftop terrace, eyes wide and throat tight as he stared into the churning sea. There were too many people. Too much noise that he couldn’t account for or defend himself against.
The church started to empty, but Steve remained in his seat.  As much as his mother would scold him for not being a good Christian and finding his community here, he knew what his being here could mean. Protestors, for one. A lot of Christian groups loathed him now that he was out, and they would definitely make trouble here.
“And then he would understand exactly why you didn’t go.”
Tony decided he wasn’t going to take Rhodey’s advice and even entertain the idea of going after Steve. They had a friendship and professional whatever relationship that was perfectly good enough. Steve’s company was all he really wanted anyway, and he could get that without a relationship or dating/
Vision followed her gaze to the window, watching the grass sway in the nighttime breeze with perfect clarity. Sometimes it was difficult for him to remember the difference between night and day.
It was refreshing.
“Fine,” Not-Tony said. “Ask me a question I could only know if I knew Bucky.”
Blaine burst out laughing and Boone cracked a grin. “Fuck you, Jess.”
“Hey what?” Tony replied, equally distracted.
“Your go, Rogers.”
Steve shook his head, his cheeks full of burger.
“I planned on being there—”
Well didn’t Steve know how to make him feel all warm and fuzzy.
No one dared to claim that it was because of their relationship. Everyone in that room knew better than to think Tony would agree with him just for the sake of their relationship.
Tony shrugged on his jacket and pulled his sunglasses from his pocket. It was dark outside, but it was one habit he wouldn’t break from his days of drugs and drinking.
Steve shook his head. “I lost the version of you I wanted, Tones. I lost the person who loved me and comforted me and
The age factor came in because when Blaine laughed, there were the beginnings of crow’s feet at the corners of his eyes, and his stubble was flecked with grey.
“You aren’t going anywhere,” Tony murmured. “You’re staying right here with me.”
A silence settled over them all as Steve turned his focus to the fizzing alcohol in his glass, and it was only after Tony nudged him with his knee under the table that he realized he was supposed to say something.
“You needed to sort things out,” Bucky said with a shake of his head. “You still gotta sort things out. You ‘n me have plenty of time to loaf around.”
Steve smiled wide. “Really? That’s great. I love painting, sketching—all of it. I just don’t really make time for it in my schedule, though I know I should.”
“Ten seconds—”
Steve woke up refreshed, like he always did, and swung his legs off the side of his bed. A quick glance out the window showed that the day was overcast. His phone buzzed insistently where it lay on his dresser, but Steve made no move to check it. Not yet. He took solace in these quiet moments before he was fully awake, where he lived in the margins between still sleeping and supposed-to-have-texted-back-by-now.
Except with Tony there had been screaming and grabbing and seething.
Steve’s brow creased. “Peter, Tony and I discussed—“
“Yes, um. I mean—nothing’s wrong. It’s—yeah, it is three, huh.” He cradled Morgan’s little head in his hand, already bigger than when she’d arrived in his life just a few months ago.
“I don’t drink,” Tony muttered, flicking his fingers to send the wine away.
Tiredness had sunken so deep into his bones that he could hardly feel it anymore. But once again, his face was still normal. When he smiled, it was still pretty damn convincing. He tried it a few times just to make sure.
Steve quickly looked away when he spied a hiccy peeking out from beneath Tony’s collar, his cheeks flushing pink.
“Well, no. I’ll keep serving until—“
“Well, duty calls, Tony,” Steve said, forcing his smile a little too much.
A sentinel found him before he was able to make it to the tower, scanning him and demanding where he had been.
Steve gently lowered Tony onto the cold sand, and for a moment he felt a familiar pull.
“Now,” Tony panted. “You’d better shut up and fuck me, Rogers.”
With one last quiet sigh, Steve slipped into the darkness of his own living quarters for another night that was no more a victory than it was a failure.
“I’m securing the connection now…” Cueball muttered. “Okay, I’ve got ‘em. Locating security system, here we go.” He tapped some more. “There. Security system on standby, you’re clear.”
“Steve, you—” He tried to somehow convey fucking with just his face. He wasn’t sure if it landed.
Nikolai’s tongue lolled out and he wagged his tail a little harder.
Goddammit. “About what?” Steve asked. “I think we’ve talked about everything we could possibly talk about on this planet.” But Tony had already punctured his cheek with the hook, because Steve had never thought to spit it out. Not really.
His fingers twitched as the door open, wanting a rifle in his hands in case something had gone wrong outside. Blaine and Sam stepped in unharmed.
Steve tried to smile, but it didn’t really work. “’S okay. I woulda done everything the same.”
That night terror had been worse than normal. Bad enough that Blaine had to shake him awake to get him to stop screaming.
Maria scowled. “I have connections. I’ll figure out who you are.”
“Okay,” he finally relented. If Peter wanted him to try it, then maybe he should. “I’ll try it out.”
, Blain, you shoulda heard--”
“The fuck are you on this morning?!?” Bucky panted as he hoofed it to catch up.
Steve believed her.
His therapist did not know he’d been sending a text every week for two months with a time and place. He never got a reply. He tried not to expect one. Steve was still figuring things out. Right now that involved not talking to him, looking at him, or making any kind of suggestion that he was even acknowledging Tony’s existence.
“Hi, Tony.”
As though the world knew better than to send anger with a soft beginning.
He briefly wondered if this was what it felt like at his wedding. They had gone a lot bigger, and rented out a luxurious ballroom in New York. Practically everyone they had ever met came to their wedding. Well, everyone they had met since Steve had thawed out.
