Sighing, Bruce gave Steve a pleading look. "I don't think Howard is trying to
talking like I'm not there. It's infuriating. But I know he's doing it because he loves me." Tony paused, taking a swig of water. "He's not trying to piss me off; he's trying to protect me."
Affronted, Hill shoved a large text across the table at him. "In your dreams. You're grounded, by the way," she pointed at him and slid her hand through the air to point at Natasha, "you too."
"It's been a hell of a year."
"Yes! You do! I'm your-"
He's up again not a half hour later, his hands opening and closing.
"Pretty sure that's mine."
"Clinton!"
He laughed, looking as innocent as he could -- which he was well aware he could pull off far too effortlessly -- and shoved the text back to Hill. "Don't make fun of me; I'm deaf."
for his return single,
"I didn't- Were you always a queer?" He asked Steve. Again, it was the wrong thing to say. It was like he couldn't keep his word vomit from spewing out all over the place. "Fuck, I'm sorry I- But were you?" Nothing was making sense. How did he not know? How had this happened?
"So soon?"
Tony scoffed. "I'm not taking that bet." He paused. "Twenty that the nerdy one hacks into something governmental."
"Tony-" Steve's eyes went wide. "-I don't think that's such a good idea."
"Hey! I got dumps like a truck, truck, truck!"
The sweet momentum was driving them closer and closer, but not enough to send them over the edge. Steve pulled Tony up to sit on his lap, kissing him deeply as the position drove his cock deeper into Tony, swallowing the genius' gasp as he stilled him from moving by grabbing his hips.
"Tony!" Steve gasped, suddenly all too aware of what the genius was about to see, but Tony quieted him.
Clint was amazed; Nat really
"Somewhere, I'm sure. Check the closet."
"Steve?" Tony spoke as Steve was turning to leave the room, "I love you."
But if Tony hadn't made a move by now...
confused as to why you've decided that dumping him is the best possible course of action."
Natasha. And Steve.
The smile came slowly, but it lit up Tony's face brilliantly. "Two halves of the same idiot."
"Children!" Natasha yelled out, arms up like she was a lion tamer and not the only mature one of the Avengers. "I will turn this tower around, or so help me!" Or maybe they were a bad influence on her.
"As you should be. I could bounce a quarter off that thing. All the squats in the world won't give me an ass like that. But you're missing the point."
Steve was on the verge of giving in and Tony--Tony was gasping and rocking his hips, so close to coming that Steve knew at some point he wouldn't be able to stop him. "My little whore likes this." He grunted, his own hips starting to move up, trying to get the friction he so craved. "Then he can eat you out," he looked at Clint. "His tongue is wicked. Just like him."
Steve chuckled. "We can have it delivered."
and schedule manicures. She'd even traverse Fifth Avenue with Natasha, shopping and chatting, but Happy was always waiting with the car, and Pepper was certainly not the type to dive naked into the Atlantic Ocean.
He had thought they made progress, had thought they were moving past Tony's fears. Whatever Tony had to tell him was serious enough to bring all of that back to the surface like boiled rice in a pot. Howard's chest tightened in anxiety. "Whatever it is, Tony, you can tell me." He tried to sound calm and steady, everything his own father never was.
"Oh, is it?"
"So does Steve." It was said softly, gently, but with purpose. Understanding Tony was never easy, but sometimes he was so transparent; he would do anything to make Steve happy (including harming his own happiness, as he so perfectly demonstrated with breaking up with him), but that also extended to self-care. If Steve wanted him to eat, Tony would at least try. As far as Rhodey understood, anyway. He wasn't expecting much, maybe a few bites, but it was better than nothing, so he smiled encouragingly as Tony bit into the sandwich. "You always said Bruce got the cream cheese to jelly ratio just right."
The sweat was starting to cool on their skin, and he felt Tony shiver from it. Kissing the side of his head, he gently lifted Tony off of his length, loving the way he quivered as he pulled past his prostate on the way out. "Come on, angel, let's get cleaned up."
to understand. Didn't he? Steve didn't punch Howard for himself. He did it for Tony. Hell, he did it for
Steve laughed in answer. "Was it?" He snorted.
The electronic voice called back, "Timer set for twenty minutes."
Steve doubled over again, "But, Tony! It's lit!"
She left the glass, with a hastily scribbled note, on his work bench, and made her back to the living room. Bruce was en route, having been in Westchester picking up a few chemicals he needed that had to be retrieved in person. Depending on traffic, she knew he'd be back sometime after dinner.
Michael looks a little contrite as Joseph coughs into his fist, "He called you out."
"That's beside the point," but she was right. That type of dark humor was right up his alley. Usually. "Watch what you say for a few days, Natasha. Tony's not going to be thinking like himself until we get
"Tony," Steve started, but Tony had already snuck from the room.
Steve took full notice of his actions.
There was nothing he could do until they found a way to get him back (not that he was being very helpful), no way to plan and plot until he was back in 1961. Howard wouldn't exactly say he was dragging his feet by offering no further details as to how he got to the future, and it wasn't like he was outwardly
"What can I do for you, Agent Romanoff?"
think you're doing what you believe is best for Tony. But that's not your decision to make." Picking at the edge of his napkin, Bruce balled it up and tossed it on the table. So much for a nice lunch. "I know what Natasha thinks is right - and that she has Clint on her side. I know that Rhodey is on the fence, but he's leaning in Nat's direction. Hell, I even know what Howard wants. All of that has been discussed
It was terrifying and wonderful. Tony had somehow shifted everything. All of Steve's priorities switched. He didn't want the white picket fence anymore; he wanted coffee grounds and workshops. Reading nooks and sarcasm.
"Start from the beginning, angel."
His guess - and he's sure he's right - is that the couple are well into their nineties, most likely born around the time he was. Hell, if they were from the city to begin with, he may have even known them. Stranger things have happened.
"Yeah, yeah, go ahead," Tony said, standing to use the bathroom and almost walking into the door as he opened the page in his phone's browser.
His chest is getting tight, and Tony rubs the skin above the arc reactor.
The idea that regardless of how better they behaved towards each other now, Tony's memories of his childhood disrupted whatever sense of security he had was disconcerting at best.
Bruce continued like he hadn't even heard him, "-They don't want well composed harmonies waxing poetic about love and loss." He sat back, giving her a small and kind smile, "I don't mean to burst your bubble. Really. But you need to face facts."
"You're in Manhattan." A voice behind him said. Wheeling around, Howard took in the man before him. It was Steve, all right, but his hair was shorter, and he wore denim dungarees and a white short sleeved shirt. Aside from black socks on his feet, he was barefoot.
Tony didn't fight it. Normally their cuddling was a cute way to either sleep or watch a movie, and most of the time it ended in sex. They rarely had the need to snuggle for comfort. Tony was far too independent for that. But there were times…
"Too late to back out, honey. See you at two?"
. Ya here to do a job for me, not be inducted into the business."
The battle lost, Tony let the tears slip down his face. He tried for a joke, but all that came out was a stilted, "Boy, have you got me pegged."
"That is not fair!" Thor laughed, "I have yet to create any!"
"JARVIS," he started softly, looking up toward the ceiling, "can you tell me where Tony is?"
The assemble call and the aftermath.
Steve looks like he badly wants to respond to that, but instead, he plucks the parsnip from Tony's hands and drips it into a Ziploc bag with a handful of the beans. "I like parsnips better anyway," Steve finally says as he zips the bag closed.
"But him knowing, Steve, I fucked up. He needs to go back at some point, and now he
Also the group chat? It's entitled: AVENGERS ASSEMBLE TO GET STEVE AND TONY TOGETHER
on the finer points of lovemaking are intelligent and profound," Steve finished for him. "Lovely. Now let's eat." His face was a nice shade of crimson.
He sighed, dramatically enough to have Jarvis answering with a quiet, "Sir?" before looking back up at the screen.
Steve loved the Avengers. They gave him a family when he had lost his own. He had a different relationship with each of them, and he appreciated every one. Nat was like the sister he never had: she put him in his place and challenged him. Clint was the guy you went to when you wanted to have fun but also feel secure and included. Thor was the big brother who loved unconditionally and had the best advice. Bruce told it like it was, never sugar coating it, but somehow it always came out kindly. And Tony.
"Killjoy."
Hello! Sorry for the delay in posting, but the good news is that entire story is officially written! This was supposed to be the last chapter, but it was far too large, and I felt bad dumping an almost 20k chapter on you guys, so it's split up. Two 9k-ish chapters and an epilogue that's less than 2k.
of things.
"I know. You're right, Tony. I have no excuse."
"Don't act surprised."
"-Poo! Clint, fuck off!"
"You're not sorry."
"I'll go. I have -- uh -- I have some… Some paperwork." He stood up, fully intending to slink off to his apartment to lick his wounds when Tony raised his hand to stop him.
Something to keep Steve warm in the days and weeks ahead.
"-Good."
"Yeah, it is." They stayed just like that for a long while. Each fitting comfortably against the other, and basking in the warmth and the closeness, Tony humming softly a tune Steve didn't recognize. It was slow and sweet.
with Howard. Natasha didn't seem to mind; she was almost encouraging it. But what she thought wasn't what mattered. This was about Tony - and Steve to a lesser extent.
The kitchen was spotless, as it usually was (they did have a cleaning service, after all), but things were moved around.
"Is that even a question? I seem to remember in the last story this was the part where you threw me on the bed and fucked my brains out." Tony's eyes darkened, and he rocked his hips against Steve.
"God, you are so beautiful."
In the bed next to him, Steve is quietly seething, his leg in a cast from thigh to foot. He'll heal quicker (which Tony maybe had complained loudly about) and be able to leave this godforsaken place
"Nick, Jesus, fuck. These guys'
"How chivalrous," Tony deadpanned, though his eyes were light. She let out a snicker and closed the door behind her.
Sitting on the porch with her feet up on the railing, Natasha dropped her head to the side to look at Clint. "He doesn't need his fingernails, right?"
They make it to the park in record time, considering the slippery conditions. If they landed on their butts once or twice, only the beginning of the Sunday morning commuters saw it. It's barely half past 4, much too early and snowy for even Manhattan to awaken just yet, and when they reach the park, they are gloriously alone. It's not common to attain that luxury in the city, but the best chance is on a cold and weathered Sunday morning. Tony wonders at their luck. At least this way, there will be no paparazzi to take their photos, no fans to gawk and point, and no parents to glare that two adults dare take up space and snow from their children.
him. It would be another choice out of his hands, but he would do it."
As Steve finishes, Tony purposefully brandishes the parsnip. "And now!
And Steve was gone.
Steve turned briefly to Howard, "Just, crap, stay there! Don't move!" And he was back to running down the hallway, following the sound of the slamming of Tony's suite door. He keyed in his code and was inside before Tony made it halfway across the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
To finally have a piece of his past with him in the future.
When she next looked up, tucking her phone back into her pocket, it was to see Howard wearing the box the pin came in as a hat.
he had managed to fuck up.
"My, my," teased Bruce, "who will eat all this food?"
But Tony barely heard them. He was wrapped up in Steve's arms, the laptop forgotten on the floor, surrendering himself to the kisses, his body trembling with the need to be close.
"Not yet. He has to actually agree to date me first." Tony replied, picking up the empty cellphone box and opening and closing it, just to have something to do with his hands.
The creature was literally a sewer dragon. A fire breathing, nasty smelling sewer dragon. Ridden by a burly man with a dirty beard and beady black eyes in a long coat and a top hat. Steve had to rub his own eyes to make sure he was seeing what he actually thought he saw.
Throwing his head back, he came. "Fuck! Yes! Steve!" He rode through his orgasm, loving the feel of his come coating his fingers and the velvet of his insides.
doing it. And
"Yeah? What's that?" Sitting, Howard swept some of the discarded salad from the table onto the floor.
"It's only 46 degrees."
"I'm a rich bastard, what did you expect?" Tony retorted instead, bouncing on his toes in anticipation as the coffee maker began sputtering its final descent into completing his ambrosia.
"No throwing vegetables!"
Fury was still watching the doorway through which Howard had disappeared. "Now we create a life for him here. The public already figured out who he is." At Tony's stunned look, Fury held up a hand. "It's crazy. I know it. You know it. Hell, the hot dog vendor down the block from here fucking knows it, but I say we go with that. If they didn't know, I might say differently. But let's work with the shit we already have. Introducing him as anything else will cause the public to call our bluff. With all the technology out there -- most of which you created, so you know what it's capable of -- there's no way we can keep this secret. And it will make the transition easier on everyone."
"But why do you have to go? I want you here. Who's going to keep me warm tonight?" Tony's voice was petulant.
"Oh, what a travesty!" Steve jokingly balked, turning to swat at Tony's ass with a dish rag, "Get a move on!"
Swallowing, Steve arranged his features into something he hoped was a positive expression. "I love you too, Tones. Get some sleep."
"Or was it your turn to clean the dishes?"
Thank you for coming along for the ride! Please leave a comment if you enjoyed. :)
He caught the paper as the printer spit it out, reading quickly and heaving a long suffering sigh. A monster would have been so much easier to deal with. But it was there, in black and white. The DNA from the scotch glass matched Tony's on a paternal level.
He shakes his head, feeling a wave of dizziness. He knows what he wants - what he
over protective of Tony. Not just Steve." She brought the point home by majestically stomping her foot.
"Steve, I just...ugh!" The anxiety within him put a stop to the confession. Again. He sputtered for a moment, throwing his arms up in frustration. "You're just so...and I'm just...I mean, look at you!" He was gesturing wildly back and forth, to Steve and back to himself, then back to Steve. "And then there's me. And you! You're so good and perfect and me? I'm just...I'm just Tony."
"Toenails?"
"Same creator, but no, they're different," Clint responded, looking at Nat.
Tony's mouth dropped. It all made sense now.
Tony is left making faces at an empty doorway.
one of them said, gesturing to Tony,
"Oh, look," her voice dripped with sarcasm, "they have me quoted as saying:
"We got this," she said, turning down the happy act enough to set them better at ease. She could effortlessly play the part of overly excited manager; that worked on the new acts and the old ones too dumb to realize, but not these guys.
"Tony! That's it!"
"Tony! No! That's not it! We do need you!" Tony fought against the hold, but it was nowhere near his usual strength. "Babe, listen to me. You're sick. That's not your fault, but it's the truth. And until we get you better-"
. As much as she witnessed for him, he witnessed for her. You couldn't touch their bond, and no one tried to.
The pain is intensifying, and Tony gasps, unable to respond. The man gathers him into his arms. It's so gentle and sure that he's able to do it without jostling Tony's wrecked body too much. He holds Tony against him, carefully lifting his head to see the sunset.
Steve tilted Tony's head up and kissed him again, and Tony felt the passion, the love, and the acceptance. Once more, his eyes started to fill. He pulled away, frustrated with himself.
Tony knocked on the glass, waving idiotically when Bruce lifted his head to see who was at the door. He plastered on his best media smile and entered when Bruce gestured him inside. "Brucie Bear!"
Steve's fingers ran the length of Tony's arms and down his wrists, clasping his hands on either side of his head, and he slowly pulled out, moaning at the feeling. "Tony," he gasped, and pushed back in.
"Hey!" Steve started with a pleased look, "That's my old pin!" Tony gave him a confused look and Steve explained, "I was part of the art club, one of the only things I could do."
"Everyone thinks you're such a good soldier boy, just like Steve." Tucking his legs underneath him, Tony flipped through the menu, laying it on his thigh when he reached the espresso page. "I know better. I have seen both of your 'O' faces."
Her smile was soft; it was one she didn't usually show in public. "Likewise, jerk."
"You had years of hurt built up by how you were raised. Of course you wanted his approval and love." Sitting up from his supine position, he sat back on the arm of the couch, partially tucked into the corner of it for support, and pulled Tony on top of him. Tony settled his legs on either side of Steve's and lay against him, his head tucked under Steve's chin and his arms wrapped around his middle.
Tony was thinking,
Please comment down below with what you think!
"That's all good and well,
"Who are you?"
Howard stepped back. This was a lot of information from one picture.
"You're an idiot."
"I mean, they're not all bad, right?"
"Mr, Stark," a microphone was shoved in his face, "what did the doctor tell you? Are you sick?"
Rhodey had flung himself from the bathroom, intent on attacking Howard when a sob from the floor detoured him.
Walking to the door, he called out over his shoulder, "At least I'm predictable!" And left. Once again leaving Tony to his thoughts.
It was too much to digest all at once, so Tony took a shower instead. It was, after all, the best 'think box' out there. He let the water wash away the day and scrubbed his body clean, all the while obsessing over every detail he had missed:
"Pleasure."
"Tony, I'm sorry," Steve began, "we didn't do it to hurt you, we're just worried-"
Tugging on Steve's hand, he moved toward the door, "Can we talk? Please?"
"Tony! Oh god, what about Tony? I just- I just got him back!" Steve turned to press his forehead against Tony's, his eyes filling with unshed tears. His left hand reached up, cupping Tony's cheek, his eyes not moving from the other's, which were wide and frightened. Tony had faced his mortality before, but not like this. If Howard being there meant he was never born, there wouldn't even be a legacy to leave behind. Not to mention the ramifications of a world without Stark technology.
"Sure you want me to stop?" he teased, tucking his palm flat under Tony's hand and on his stomach. He inched up under his t-shirt. In answer, Tony just smirked and scooted his legs further apart, no longer bothered by the tickling.
"For the love of-"
"Cartilage in his knees?"
"He packs a hell of a punch, I'll tell ya that."
"We're close, but no one has ever been able to reach Tony like you." Moving to the coffee table and picking up a tray, he held it out to Rhodey. "And try to get him to eat something?"
He washed both of them, going from Tony's arms to his chest, reaching around to clean his stomach and finally slip in between his legs to carefully wash there. If he was worried he hurt Tony, that fear abated quickly when Tony moaned at the feeling.
"And you three!" Steve rounded on them, "You're more interested in gaining fame for your video than helping! You should be disgusted with yourselves! Famous or not, he doesn't deserve to be molested by some filthy sycophant!" With that Steve turned from them and grabbed the safety bar with one hand and put Tony's hand back on his arm with his other, like he belonged there.
Steve breezed past Howard, coming to stand in front of Tony, "Hey, what are you doing up?"
dating him."
He really was a good friend.
Which was working. Tony's face went red, his hands clutching his stomach, and fell against the counter, gasping for breath and laughing so hard he started coughing. "App-Appetizer!"
"Make me." The man said, pulling Tony backwards by his hip.
"Don't do that," Tony whines softly, "I can't do this without you, Rhodey-Bear."
"What's, uh, what's rimming?" Steve asked, eyes wide.
"Tony," Steve began, but Tony hushed him with a hand held up.
"I really do not feel like having to take Hulk down." The bag of sugar landed back on the table with a plop. "Though I could use a fun romp in a secure facility."
"And here we go again." Tony grumbled, annoyed, into his lunch. He threw his fork down. "Talking about me like I'm not even here."
"I saw it," the voice on the other end of the line spoke as a greeting, "Go, there's nothing important over the next two days anyway. Though, you may want to invest in some bubble wrap."
If you enjoyed this, please let me know in the comments!
Howard Stark."
"Babe?" Steve's sleepy morning voice was a favorite of Tony's. It was a bit deeper, raspier, and totally sexy. Tony felt a flush as his body woke up to the sound, but he really needed to tinker. He had too much in his head to work out.
Raising her eyebrows, Natasha barked out a laugh, "I beg your pardon?"
"Uh, well, it's been a few months, I don't know, maybe almost a year? But I keep getting sick after I eat. I can't keep anything down. And, uh, sometimes," he paused, slightly coloring, "sometimes it's diarrhea. Sometimes I'm, uh, I guess constipated." His face pinched. This was embarrassing. "I'm also always really tired. And I get these migraines, and this ridiculous brain fog. I don't know, there's other things. Like my stomach gets all bloated. But those are the worst." He thought for a moment. "And I can't keep a tan apparently."
With a grin, Tony showed him the screen, "But you take a mean picture!"
Tony didn't hesitate. He mixed the cleaners and solvents with an expert hand. "This is dedicated to every winner of every science fair
to kiss me."
"Do you see now? How perfect you are like this? Look at what you're doing to them, my pretty little slut."
"Thank you. I know this has been crazy, I know everything is fucked up right now, but if there's going to be a mistake, let me be the one to make it."
Maybe he
over his best friend. Oh, he worried. And that was an understatement. He worried Tony would fall into bed with the wrong person, or piss off the wrong businessman. He worried he'd drink himself into an early grave. He worried at the lonely nights spent in his workshop,
Bruce looked completely grossed out, paused over the table where he set the eggs down, "I don't need to know
"I'll show you diligent."
Natasha waved her hand, dismissing them both. "Regardless, this has been going on for months. I say we drug him and dump him at the emergency room."
This Howard wore a SHIELD t-shirt a size too big and sweatpants that were probably a size too small. His hair was disheveled, and he looked like he had one hell of a night. His hair was still black and thick, still good looking, still with that charming smile Rhodey hated that Tony could do too.
It was Natasha's turn to narrow her eyes, this time at Steve. He flushed and looked down.
"Not a perk for you, I'm afraid."
"One stick of butter, coming right up!" A thunk behind Clint's head had both he and Howard whipping around, Clint yelping. "Jesus, Nat!"
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Tony slowed in counting the money. The safe was filled with stacks of it, more money than Steve had ever seen before.
Chuckling, Steve stood up straight and tapped a box in his hands, "Fury sent this. It's from the Smithsonian."
Something snapped inside Tony, the media fallout be damned! "GET YOUR GRIMY HANDS OFF OF ME!" He twisted from the man's grip as best he could in the limited space.
play them for fools. They're older and they're pop, but they're intelligent and talented men. If you do this," he stood and walked around the desk, "then I have a nice cushy office waiting for you as a partner."
"You're not fine; don't change the subject."
"Tony!" she scolded loudly, waking them both. "We have a meeting in twenty minutes!"
"We don't got a clear shot, Cap." That was Natasha, the quinjet moving through the air in an attempt to find the best vantage point in the narrow street. "Howard is in the way!"
Laughing, Steve twisted his body enough to capture Tony's lips. "Insatiable. How can an old man like me keep up?"
"Doctor," Tony squirmed in his arms, "I'm so close,
Who just barked a laugh in return, not hesitating, "You haven't had virtue since you were sixteen."
he said softly. The paramedic was watching them weirdly, his eyes wide and confused. Tony, with his arm still wrapped around his midsection, put his hand on the paramedic's shoulder and steered him toward the ambulance.
"Ugh, they're annoying. I had high hopes Howard could keep up," she shook her head, "and he called Tony the disappointment."
Tony had never heard her speak so much in one go, and it momentarily shocked him quiet. He blinked, slowly gathering his thoughts. There had to be some way to salvage this situation. "Tashy," he said, the moniker was his alone, no one else could call her that, and she more than tolerated it from him. She actually loved it; it was endearing. "I was raised in a different world than any of you. There are things that were expected of me. Being a genius only added more, but I was born looking like this," he gestured to his face, "and into a wealthy, famous, and high societal family. People like thinking they can touch the good looking rich man." At her murderous look, he hurried on, "it was always a bargaining chip, you know? It made them feel special to take my hand or put their arm around me. It's not like I okayed anyone to, you know, take me. I wouldn't allow that happen! You know how I feel about that. Don't you remember? A few months ago, that guy was all over that girl and she was visibly upset?"
But Natasha's words were ringing around in his head.
Steve's eyes darkened. "I've got work to do." With a meaningful glance at Tony, he turned on his heels and left.
Steve's head popped out over the blankets, "Chicken nugget? That's a new one."
Bruce's face was red with embarrassment. Oh well. That's what he got for choosing Tony as his best friend. "Forget it. I don't want to go to lunch with two horn dogs."
As usual, ALL the love for my beta and cheer readers: Lan, Rachel, and Wilma.
Tony was upside down on the couch. It was just his way, Steve knew, but he still thought it was weird. It didn't mean Steve loved him any less, of course. On the contrary, his adoration was deepened by Tony's little quirks. He was so unashamedly himself that it was hard
He was so beautiful. It took Steve’s breath away whenever he thought about it, whenever he contemplated his luck to have this amazing, gorgeous, and brilliant man to call his own.
Tony dropped his hands flat on the table, the bang and clanking of glasses startling an older couple next to them. "I already spend
- had it screwed up something
"Oh yeah, she asked if I wanted to give permission for photos of me to be included in something." He chuckled and sang softly, "It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now..."
"And what happened?" He remembered the first time he had met Howard. Tony was fifteen, top of the class - hell the whole college - excited and proud to show Howard what he had been working on. The entire time, Howard had looked annoyed, bored. It was an obligation to him, seeing his son in school, non-important, but quintessential to continue the facade of the loving tech family. He kept up appearances until they were behind closed doors. Until he thought they were alone. Rhodey had shifted on his feet in the bathroom, peering through the crack in the slightly ajar door. He didn't want to interrupt a private moment between Tony and his father because
For all Tony claimed to not be abused,
Tony didn't seem to care about the state of his clothing though. He pulled Steve close to him again, falling back against the wall, and attacked his lips.
Final chapter will be up next Friday and the epilogue the Friday after that! Enjoy the rest of this wild ride!
"I know, baby. I love you too, now would you keep going with what you are doing? Getting a little antsy here."
"You should be protecting my precious child's virtue." Howard tried, but he could barely keep a straight face. It cracked into a grin, and he coughed to cover it up.
"And Steve? If sometimes your best is only 50%, that's okay too. But I know with certainty that you were at full capacity on that day in Rochester, and even if you weren't, you are not responsible. The man that released that demon creature is. I just… You know I always looked up to you?"
"I promise. I know we need to do the whole...honesty thing. I just..." he sighed, turning his head to kiss one of Steve's palms. "I just need you right now."
Out loud, he said, "Yeah, no, I know the owner. He's kinda a dick, and he frowns upon that."
"Whatever you need, angel." And Tony felt tears spring into his eyes. He hastily blinked them away.
Sighing dramatically, Clint let his head drop onto Bruce's. "They grow up so fast."
As usual, many thanks Wilmakins and LadyLanera for the cheering, and all the praise for MugiwaraLexi for the beta!
"Then do not do my job for me."
"Howard? Drunk? What? Impossible!"
"Fuck, yes, hurry up!"
"Breakfast," Tony quietly offered, "Bruce's pancakes. They're really good. Uhm, there's syrup in," he turned and pointed, "that cupboard. I'll get you a fork."
In the bedroom, he gently tugged off Tony's sneakers and socks, jeans, and t-shirt, replacing it with a pair of his own sweatpants, his own hoodie, and a thick pair of slipper socks. Tony’s feet felt like ice and Steve wrapped his hands around them, trying to massage some warmth back into the appendages before pulling the fuzzy fabric over them.
"All part of my charm."
what you did to him!"
"I'm-" She paused, surprised at how happy she felt despite the situation. Although, she really shouldn't be all that shocked that she was. She loved both of them and loved them together. Of course she'd feel happy to learn they were good. "I'm glad...I mean I'm really glad to hear that. And it's bad timing, but we need you. In the living room. We have information pertaining to Howard."
"Tony!"
"This is Manhattan?" Howard asked, stepping closer to Steve. The soldier took a step back and Howard froze. Something was wrong here.
Steve blushed, chuckling at himself for being so blatantly caught. "I'd apologize but-"
"Favorite pastime of mine."
The only response he got was from Natasha. It was a picture of the three of them crammed into Bruce's lab, all flipping off a hologram of Howard.
"I was you for Halloween! Mommy painted my face green!"
"No. But I'll try."
He doesn't dream, but he floats away to somewhere in between.
Steve's breath caught. He was even more beautiful than he could have hoped.
But Steve was with him through it all, right there. Next to him. Comforting him. Going as far as to help bathe him when his energy was so gone that he tried to sleep away the need for basic hygiene. He rubbed his stomach, and soothed his aches. He loved him.
But there was still business to attend to. He had his mother to think about.
Howard made a face and grunted. "Fine!" But as he turned to leave, he threw over his shoulder, "Nice to meet you, Steve's Nice Assed Lady Friend!"
"See, that's the opposite of what I should be doing." The carpet under his back was itchy, but Tony didn't move. He had a point to make. "Coming out, that is. Seems counterproductive."
But not right to hate this one.
"Jesus fucking H Christ!"
you be all artsy and get the rest."
Bruce was sick of surprises. He was sick of
It took him a second before he realized that, as he was occupied cleaning himself, Tony was busy trying to undo all of Steve's hard work on his own body. His hands had gone under the water and under his himself, fingers slipping inside to touch where Steve's cock had been, not that long ago.
Steve saw the joy that comment cultivated within Tony, and it hurt to see. Just one little bit of praise and Tony was leaning in closer to his father and chatting about his other accomplishments, like a few minutes of playing proud father would fix everything. He swallowed back his anger. It didn't matter that this Howard wasn't exactly a bad guy. He would turn into one. And he would hurt Tony. This was too little, too late as far as Steve was concerned.
Bucky had been his Jiminy Cricket, but just like Pinocchio, Steve didn't always listen to him.
"No."
"I'm just saying. You need to stop being so fucking hard on yourself, man." He shrugged.
"Gotta say, love this whole fanfiction thing. People always write me cooler than I am."
"I need to ask you something," Steve began, taking the plunge. "Tony isn't traditional, and I know it's considered out of date these days, but I'm a relic, and I'm proud."
"We do. It is about time you have...jumped on the bandwagon, so to speak." Thor had been trying to incorporate American colloquialisms into his speech, and though he often got them right, sometimes he was just enough off the mark to be funny.
He felt his body grow cold at the reminder. "I'll let Natasha know."
predictable), Steve popped his head in, a frown on his face.
"Hey, babe," he murmured, sliding his hand down Tony's side, "Tony, wake up."
"I'm not important."
"And you?" Thor asked Clint. "What would you do to Anthony?"
That got Bruce's attention. "You know what? Yes. Yes, I want to blow something up. I'm trapped here or in my room until Howard vanishes back into the abyss, and you know what? I would
Tony played the piano, and he played beautifully. Enough so that Steve would take his sketchbook out and let the music guide his hands. They'd spend hours just like that. No need for conversation. It was cozy. Natural.
And the stares from the other patrons didn't help. They glanced from the magazine's to Tony's face and to Steve's, their looks pitying or disgusted.
Pausing while adding more milk, Steve gave Tony a harassed look, "As tempting as that is, it could mean no you."
Steve was biting his tongue, seething with anger.
"I haven't slept well," Tony admitted quietly. "Without you next to me I just tossed and turned. All I wanted to do was sleep, and I just couldn't."
"Clint," Nat warned, "Maria doesn't work for the Avengers."
The waitress, a young girl who looked barely old enough to work there, smiled. "Sure thing!"
"Wait," Steve held his hand up, "how does that-? Ugh. Never mind. Spy. I get it."
"Then tell me!" Howard exploded. "I don't know how many times I have to say it, but I'll say it a thousand times more if that's what it takes!
worthy of Steven. And he is worthy of you."
Tony's face fell, "Hey, that wasn't you. You're the Howard I got to hear about from Steve when we first met." Hoping up onto one of the benches, Tony clasped his hands in front of him and angled his body so he could look at Howard straight on. "I'm pretty damn happy to meet that guy. I didn't know he actually existed."
"Oh, darling, don't you want to hear about how Steve and I barely left the bed yesterday?" Grinning wider as Steve turned to snort at him over his shoulder, Tony laid the clothing on the bed and chuckled at Bruce's sputtering.
Across town, in the AirBnB that they had rented for the week, Steve was making coffee and half listening to the news. At the dining room table, Thor had spread the contracts out, going over them with a careful eye, and Bruce sat on the couch, lazily strumming his guitar and singing a few bars here and there.
"Neither do I."
Steve's lips over his, his tongue dancing in his mouth, tasting all of him, and Tony, oh Tony. He felt the wetness on his cheeks and couldn't help but laugh again. Because he didn't think he had ever cried in happiness before this.
, did he hate the man he would become.
Steve was shoulder to shoulder with Tony. So close he could feel his warmth. "Well then."
"Man after my own heart," he spoke loud enough to get a rise out of Steve. Bruce chuckled, recognizing the ploy, and watching the door frame with Tony. As expected (because he was so,
like me got to the top? Yeah, I took out the rat bastards that tried to stop me, that tried to kill me, but my brains," the finger left Steve's chest and he tapped his own head, "that's what really got me here." He finished counting, and shoved the money at Steve. "I own this whole city, but I don't collect on it. You don't shit where ya eat."
"Go ahead, no one is going to take that bet."
"I'm okay." Looking up at him with worry and longing on his face, Tony placed his hands on Steve's chest, pushing him back just enough to slip away. "I'm fine! Get your shield!"
"I'm CEO, but you still own the company." The chastise was light, but still made her point. If he needed time, that was fine, but he had to make some form of arrangement.
Tony winced. So, he was Stark again. "I'm really sorry. Seriously!" Tony said, holding his hands up and knowing that the other man wouldn't believe him. "I didn't know that Natasha would bring you to the workshop. It's just, you know," he shrugged pathetically, "the stories are hot."
She waved her hand over her shoulder as she entered her room, an obvious dismissal. But his raised voice had finally drawn Howard's attention.
"Who knows what I would've been had it not been for the family money. I'm just trying to even the score."
Tony's face was burning. Not much made him embarrassed, just screaming his crush's name in front of him, and being groped on a subway apparently. It didn't help that those who had recognized him had their phones out, filming the exchange. The others surrounding them were looking furious, one man trying to move forward though the sardine can of a train car to help.
"I don't know. Fries?"
"Sorry," a cute little brunette woman interrupted them, "I couldn't help but overhear. Your friend, what's his allergy? Maybe I can help."
Steve was finally able to corral him back into his arms, and Tony, well, Tony just melted. "Okay, so he knows now. We'll deal with it."
But it wasn't. It was 2018, and no one gave a rat's ass if they acted like children.
She waves her hand, "Fine. Go ahead."
"Of course," she nodded. He slipped the hoodie back over his head, and stepped onto the scale. Steve's breath caught in anticipation as she slid the metal rungs back and forth.
It's Tony. It's actually, for real this time Tony.
and it fell flat," he looked sheepish for a moment, glancing at Thor. "It was just the four of us then. We thought we'd try something different."
"I'm very happy to see how you handled that Miranda Cummings incident last week," Nick Fury said, leaning back in his office chair and propping his feet on his oak desk. "You are more than a manager, Nat, you're public relations and promotion rolled into one."
. As Tony retook his seat on the table, she spoke again. "What brings you in today?"
"And you threw up?" Avery frowned when Tony nodded. "All signs pointing to celiac." He gave Tony a reassuring smile, "don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this."
"Wanna blow something up?"
"Steve?" Tony mumbled, his eyelids fluttering tiredly.
"For what, Your Grace?"
He sees the smiling face of Petra, cradling him on the swing on the back porch of the Stark Mansion in Glen Cove.
Steve batted his hand away, and finally, finally! lowered the pants. He stepped out of them with grace and Tony huffed at yet another thing Steve was flawless at. He'd show him! If he had to learn to pole dance, he'd do it! Just to upstage Steve at his own game. Because the strip tease he was receiving had Tony so hard he was almost aching. He wanted so badly to touch himself but refused. After all the stories, he at last had the real thing. He wasn't going to waste it with a quick handy.
"That's it, sweetheart. Come on." Steve pulled at the brown strands, making Tony's neck bend back just enough to look up at him "Take it all, you can do it." Tony's mouth opened, and he let Steve guide his cock halfway in, the considerable length and girth filling him until his pretty lips were stretched wide around his shaft. "I bet you look just as good being filled from the other end as well, huh?"
"You're annoying."
indeed a good man - a great one even - and he deserved Steve's friendship. He deserved a better father than someone who would lose himself into drink and violence.
Tony relished the sound of the bed knocking against the wall, how Steve's grunts and moans picked up in volume as he neared his release, and how his own body tightened. So close, so desperate to feel himself filled, so
Steve let his head drop into his hands. There was nothing normal about any of this. Good grief.
Steve crashed their lips together and pulled out, enjoying the shiver he felt run through Tony's body. When he pushed back in, it was like the whole world opened up. Like he all of a sudden had the answers to everything.
hate him. Probably more than you do, because he's still a part of me. As much as I don't want to admit that. He's all the bad within me."
Tony tried to conceal it, and most of the time he did it well. Until he became overwhelmed, until the seams in the walls he built around himself started to leak, faster and faster, and he could no longer keep his head above water.
"Not in the slightest. You have a gift. Now lay back. I'm going to ride you."
An exaggerated horrified look crosses Tony's face. "What did you do?"
"Pleasure, actually."
," throwing his arms out, he angrily gestured around him, indicating the other occupants of the tower, "are the ones who showed him that he deserves love and happiness. That he's not worthless. That it's okay to
"Yeah. Are you?"
But you could-"
"Oh, goodie!" Clint set his own mug down enthusiastically, spilling some of the liquid inside. Tony cursed and rushed to wipe it up before it hit one of his computers, but Clint was already across the room, digging through the box. "I want the blue one."
Kneeling between Tony's legs, he gently pushed them up, something unspoken between them letting him know it was okay that he topped, that Tony wanted it like this.
He sat on the edge of the bed, drying his hair using a second towel with vigorous rubs across his scalp before running the towels over his chest and glancing up at Natasha with a quirked eyebrow.
"-I don't ever want to hear that word out of your mouth again, Bruce," Clint stage whispered.
Letting out of breath through his lips, Tony offers him a smile as consolation. "Thank you, I mean it."
Playing with one of the wrappers, Tony nodded. "He says it's just who he is."
Time was frozen, just as he had been. Useless except for the steady reminder that the love that had given him meaning had dissolved like sea foam in the tide.
Happy nodded, frowning. He was of the same mind as the others, which was simply that the media were a bunch of assholes who didn't know jack shit.
Each one had a picture of Tony, pale and sickly, some with additions from the team. Steve guilding an exhausted Tony back into the tower. Natasha looking worried as he stumbled through a hotel entrance. Bruce with his hand on Tony's shoulder in the Audi, his face full of concern.
They were in the penthouse kitchen, Steve at the breakfast nook, flipping through the newspaper and sipping orange juice. "Knock 'em dead," he cheeked.
"Whatever," Tony grumbled in response, picking up the pancakes. "I hate both of you."
Tony braced himself on the bed to lean down and kiss him, "Just text me when the chef shows up. I promise I'll come a-running."
"I guess not. You gonna be okay?"
"We'll see, I'll have Steve let me know if you're being good," she cheeked, "otherwise, you're on your own."
to leave your positions once you think you've done enough damage control."
Coulson's face shows no change at Tony's comment; instead, he motions to Tony. "You were 38 when you died, so the difference in what your shell looks like and your spirit body will be minimal. I was 48 when I died, so the difference is much more pronounced. My current shell, however, is at 44. When my wings are away, I look much older."
News of Tony's visit to the doctor spread fast throughout the media outlets, each speculation more wrong than the next. Paparazzi lined the streets in front of the tower, hoping to catch even the smallest glimpse of the genius, flashing cameras at almost anyone who entered or exited, just in case.
Hope everyone got a good chuckle!
to. He knew that no matter how angry he got, Steve did his best to at least attempt diplomacy.
Steve looked worried, "I mean about the tower. You think they know the layout?"
Tony groaned petulantly, burying his face in Steve's chest. "Meanie."
Howard didn't know a lot about this time, but he knew one thing. He knew it was high time Tony had a father. He wasn't seeking forgiveness; he didn't deserve that. But maybe,
Shit. He had forgotten about him.
"My estimate is that Director Fury will arrive in 9 minutes and 57 seconds," JARVIS supplied.
"You're an idiot."
Sighing, Steve stepped off the elevator and turned toward Tony's suite. When he answered, he kept his voice low, just in case they were overheard. "I thought about it. But SHIELD may complicate things. I'm here for Tony - we all are. If it gets out of hand, that is - if it looks like he needs a professional to speak to, then we will. For the moment, the less people that know, the better."
"There's actually an island in the Pacific that's angels only. Lovely resort with the best LauLau I've ever had."
"That's an oddly specific number."
Steve pushed back into Tony's mouth, pumping in and out for five strokes, savoring the feel of it before pulling out completely. "Now, I asked if I could come inside of you. Is that still a yes?"
Before Bruce could speak another word, Steve was in between him and Howard, and the Other Guy was sitting back on his haunches in his mind, watching curiously. At least that was one crisis averted.
"Okay!" Natasha exclaimed, clapping her hands together once, startling them. "Let's go food shopping!" She
Chuckling, Coulson looks at Tony fondly. "Yes, the one and the same. I haven't met him yet, but I hear that Bruce is a very kind man, despite the Hulk." His head dips. "I don't hear—I know. It's hard to code switch sometimes. He's very sweet. Good heart.
"Are you okay with that?"
"Oh, please, call me Howard," he waved his arm around, dismissing the use of his last name.
He caught Tony's eyes, giving him a questioning gaze, but Tony just shook his head minutely. The meaning was clear. He needed this. Steve didn't understand why; he couldn't comprehend any reason for Tony to feel the urgency to care for his estranged - and dead - father. The man had neglected Tony. He had been cruel. And even if the physical abuse wasn't all that often, it
Tony moaned, "The cursing is really sexy. Never thought I'd say that. Can't believe Captain America is a potty mouth."
"Still two years younger than you!"
Tony's nails raked down Steve's chest, "Yes, Doctor!" Sweat had gathered at his hairline, one droplet rolling down the side of his face.
Tony felt his face fill again. "Yeah, what gave you that idea?"
And Steve loved him with every fiber of his being. Had loved him since the day they met, when he was 21 and Tony a saucy 18-year-old with a chip on his shoulder. He thought he would never get through to the disgruntled teen, but when Tony started singing his audition, his walls dropped. He revealed himself in a way he never did otherwise, at least not until Steve got to know him better. But that was when he fell for him, when a stranger walked into the room and opened up his hills and valleys, and Steve knew he had found his person. He just never had the guts to admit it out loud.
"Fuck yeah, it was."
the man!"
Clint rocked his head back and forth, weighing how best to explain the situation. "He cast a magic spell, in 1961, on a pin Steve had given him. He set it up so that the pin would be returned to Steve and as soon as he touched it:
When he approached Clint, he told him he loved light bondage, like being tied up. Not a lie. He kept this one truthful simply because he liked Clint's reaction to it. And the not so subtle bulge growing in his pants. Clint was known to enjoy tying his partners up.
He attempted to steel his voice, he really did. If he didn't feel okay, he could at least act it, but the slight shaking was obvious, especially to someone who knew him so well, and Tony had to look away as he saw the worry grow in Bruce's eyes. "I bumped into Howard in the kitchen. I can't…I mean, why- There is no
had happened between her and Howard. He had walked in just as they were finishing lunch and aside from offering him the rest of the
These people were crazy. That was the only explanation. Howard sat frozen in his seat, eyeing them warily. It was no wonder Steve was so different if this was his new team.
Steve was stunned still. He nodded, once, and watched with wide eyes as Tony pulled the computer onto his own lap. "I want to see what you're working on now." Tony spoke softly, running his fingers over the keyboard. The same keys that helped write the stories that had started the whole thing; he imagined them warm with Steve's touch, the muted clicking sound they made as he typed away about all the things he wanted to do to Tony. It sent a shiver up his spine.
Tilting his head, Tony replied, "If you're sure."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony doesn't believe him. "A kitten?"
"Crawl inside Tony's head for a minute-"
Tony bit his lip. Topping from the bottom, they called it. And it fit him to a t.
It was stilted still, for a few days, both Steve and Tony trying to fall back into the rhythm of friendship, but once they accepted that what happened was unchangeable but didn't need to deter the status quo, things fell back into normalcy. Three mornings before the next story was posted, they found themselves alone in the tower and seeking company. With no one else around, their only choice was each other. But it was the catalyst they needed to get back into the groove of things. It also helped that Tony didn't bring up kinks or fanfiction or the need to scream Steve's name when he came.
But it still wasn't the same.
The last thing Howard saw before he closed the door was Steve flopped backwards on the bed, throwing his arms over his face.
Tony laughed hard at that, bent over and rolling with it, wiping tears and letting his face crack open in a bright grin. "That's one way to put it!"
But yet, over twenty years later, the Avengers were still going strong.
he meant it. Forcing Tony to talk about what had just happened wasn't going to help him. It was too much, too soon. Tony had come a long way from his lonely days prior to the Chitauri attack, but he was still healing. Decades of abuse at the hands of people he should have been able to trust had dimmed his ability to speak freely about his emotions. They had been thrown back into his face all too often.
"Sure, you wanna get lunch?"
It was a week into this experiment and Tony still was unable to get Steve alone to feed him a prompt. And to apologize. He loved Steve. He wanted to be with him. Plan a life together, be all cute and domestic and lame together. All that stupid, cozy shit.
"What are you? Twelve?" Tony chuckled, trying and failing to grab the box back.
"Steve Rogers," Coulson says softly, "Captain America. We're still looking for him."
"Trust issues?"
"J, dim the lights. Let's set the mood." If AIs could roll their eyes, Tony was sure his was.
"Hey!" He fought back, just as loudly, "What the fuck, Rogers? Do you know the trouble I went through to get here? I needed to know you were all right! And look at that! You are!
"Everything? A lot of takeout, but then they all started cooking, trying to help. We thought it was the processed foods," Tony shrugged, his empty palms up and open like he has nothing left to give.
Seeing Steve, alive and vivacious. Passionate.
Tony is still clueless, but he does suspect someone in the tower. The wrong fucking person, of course! And Steve may start getting an idea that his star spangled ass has been found out.
"Because I didn't calculate landing gear and crashed into the desert?"
"Shut up, Clint."
"Were you sick at any other point during the week?" Avery asked, and when Tony shook his head in the negative, he continued, "and what about after the bagels?"
"Bed." Tony was kicking his pants off, stroking his dick a few times before he moved to take the hoodie off.
Not once did his mind let him have the happy family ending he craved so deeply.
"They are amazing," Bruce boasted.
In the guest room, he made quick work of the bed, and rustling through the dresser produced a pair of sweatpants and a shirt that looked like they'd fit Howard. It was all a hodgepodge of left behind clothes from SHIELD agents who had spent the night in the past. He was thankful for whatever he could find, the stuffy suit Howard wore wouldn't be comfortable to sleep in.
"Doubtful, but I'll give you this one. For the record, you're absolutely right. But," Michael taps his chin, "we'll have to send him back to the desert. And he'll need to be believably injured. I know Colonel Rhodes is searching for him."
"Tony, please!"
Steve went with Tony to the doctor the next morning after giving him yogurt and a banana and explaining what they thought he had. Tony wasn't happy, but any answer sounded better than not knowing. He could handle changing his diet. What he couldn't handle was continuing to be so sick every time he tried to eat.
Steve's head snapped up, and he smiled, but it was worn and forced. Tired and strained. Tony felt something clench inside him. This was his fault.
"Baby move your butt, butt, butt!"
He shrugged again. "The man I love is wasting away before my eyes. Not really."
He took her hand. "That's me!" One of the three leads back in the day before they started dividing up the solos equally, he had a strong melodic voice, though he had struggled with vocal problems a few years prior: mental stress from an illness and losing his brother tragically. Single. No kids.
But Steve's eyes widened. Apparently, he spoke 'Tony,' because something clicked and he understood the words buried underneath the stilted and jumbled mass of verbs and nouns that tumbled out of the genius' mouth.
With that, Steve bent his knees, dropping to the floor and leaning back enough to lift Tony's hips up against him, driving back into his stretched and wonderfully abused hole from behind, the rim deliciously creamy with his precome and the lube. Tony propped himself up on his elbows, his forehead resting on his arms, cock swinging between his legs. His knees dug into the rough carpet.
"Right. How silly of me." He stood and stretched, shivering a little at the loss of Steve's warmth. "I'm gonna grab a sweater before we go."
"I was abused."
"Great word. But, you sure? I mean. He said...He said there were tears."
"You said I was your favorite."
. He gave
"Would you get your
Steve.
"Sir," JARVIS' voice spoke up, "Agent Romanoff would like me to inform you that she and Agent Barton have acquired nourishment in the form of processed pork. I believe that means hot dogs."
"Having trouble, Agent Romanoff?"
"Stay?" he asks, lifting his other hand to tug at Steve's sleeve, "Please?"
They tumbled into the afternoon, the outside world still grey, while the bedroom was awash with brilliant color.
Rhodey gave her a confused look, deepening it when both Clint and Howard groaned. "Right. I'll talk to you later."
"That might be best."
Catch me on Tumblr @xRia-Rose
Bruce laughed affectionately, "He's like a musically inclined ninja savant. Check the bench out back, I found him there this morning."
"Because he was trying to find me? Why does Howard do anything? He's selfish, he doesn't think of the repercussions of his actions."
"You don't have to know, Tones, I said it before and I'll say it again, you don't have to have all the right answers right now."
"If you told me," Steve giggles, wiping at his eyes, though this at least for a better reason, "when we first met, that you had looked up to me as a child, I would have called you a dirty rotten liar."
When the others left, he made his way to Tony's side, lightly rubbing his arm to get his attention. "Hey, angel." Tony's eyes blinked as he looked up at him. "Come on, you should be in bed."
"I always loved your drawings," she said instead of answering. "You're amazing at capturing emotion."
"I think the only choice is Lethal Weapon." Clint agreed.
"-Oh, no you don't!" He shut up. "That's not an unconventional idea, Tony. I know your unconventional idiosyncrasies: keeping yourself awake until you finish a project, punishing yourself by taking on more than one person can handle, basically starving yourself into some sort of manic ideology that you think better on an empty stomach; they're all stupid. But I can live with them because we can force feed you, or drag your dumb ass to your bed. They can be corrected when need be. You're a genius, your brain works differently than the rest of us normal people; I can live with that. WE can live with that because we also know we're there to help when it's necessary. But thinking you don't deserve common decency? Hell fucking no. That's where I draw the damn line."
"I try."
It was also nice to know that Tony had someone to wake up next to. Someone who wouldn't leave in the middle of the night and take his favorite Rolex with them.
"Steve, please!"
Musical theater is Steve's thing. I hear he likes trained monkeys."
"Shower first?"
"It's been like twenty minutes, think he'll be sick soon?"
I'm chuffed?"
"I have plenty, anyway."
"Care to summarize, Plato?"
Steve chuckled. "But that's not food."
"Listen, sugar plum, knowing me means knowing I got some screws loose, I got some unconventional ideas about things-"
Smiling softly into Tony's hair, Steve slipped his arms around him, "I know, I started the fire, and if you start singing that song, I'm getting out of this bed and taking the blankets with me."
"Steve, I'm
The sigh Steve expelled had Tony grinning into the darkness of his hiding spot. "Anthony."
"What movie?" Clint asked, picking up the two hot dogs with no sauerkraut on them. A small piece had edged onto one of the buns, and he flicked it off.
"Momma, she, uh, had a cake made. Three tiers, eighteen layers in all. Vanilla cake with chocolate frosting and mocha filling, my favorite. He didn't show. I blew out the candles with just her and Jarvis and Ana. The next day he went to get some cake and complained - loudly - that he hated this flavor and why would anyone get it?" Steve listened as Tony spoke, as always tempering the anger he felt when Tony mentioned the abuse and casual neglect he faced growing up in that household. He slowly ran his fingers through the hair on the back of Tony's head, a small comforting gesture.
"You heard me."
"Why don't you go flying? It's been a while," Steve tried, tempting Tony with the one thing that almost always put a smile on his face. It didn't. His brows furrowed, looking up at Steve with a darkness behind his eyes that twisted inside of Steve.
"Box of the new Starkphones over there," Tony gestured with his head, taking the second mug from Clint's hands. "They come out next month."
"It's God awful. Can I say that now, or is this like a thing? No more using the Lord's name in vain." Tony holds up the packet, "Because this is awful. But, when she kicks the bucket, Megan from my marketing team is fantastic. You should recruit her."
Rhodey rolled his eyes, signing at the ceiling, "Thanks for the vote of confidence." He knocked, three quick raps on the door, before keying in his personal code. He could go anywhere he wanted in the tower, another perk of being Tony Stark's best friend.
Children on their parents laps and teenagers sitting next to their mothers and fathers looked with wide eyes at him. Adults both with recent diagnoses and and older ones found themselves suddenly attached to the figure before them. A superhero who was just like they were.
"Taking out a piece of garbage like Paulie, or any of those rats that disgraced my mother," he turned back to Steve. "It feels good, don't it? Like ya taking the trash out."
Tony deepened the kiss, sliding his arms up and around Steve's neck to pull him closer, bringing them down onto Steve's bed. Their bodies, hot with want and need, ached for the touch that had been denied them for their time apart. They were tense with anticipation and excitement, the desire for that physical affirmation tangible.
auto-tune."
"At the end of the hallway, take a left and follow that down. It's going to be the last door on the right." Standing, she rounds the desk to help him up, ushering him toward the door. "Don't look so worried! This is a huge honor!"
He couldn't control himself when Tony rode him. He couldn't set the pace and slow down if he felt it would be over too soon. It was one of the reasons he loved it so much. Tony would ride him, and it was like diving into a wave at the beach. You could only control so much before you were shifted in the water by the power of the current. He moved to take hold of Tony's erection, but his hands were forced back.
"-Call me Natasha."
On the far wall, directly in the middle, was a large printed board with several paragraphs. Tony read it silently.
"I'm hurting you."
"You know," Tony starts, looking up at Steve's beautiful face, "I can't cook to save my life, but I can make a mean cup of hot cocoa."
With a groan, he grabbed the box of hibiscus tea from the shelf and headed to the counter.
, and be loved in return."
For a few moments, the only sound was their panting, as they fought to regain composure, holding each other in the aftermath, pure bliss dripping from their bodies.
"I'm just saying," Tony gave him a look at that. Whenever Clint was
"I'd like to see that someday. Would you fuck him raw, Thor? Would you fill him up? He loves to be filled." Steve teased, and stilled the vibrator, pushing on it so the tip was pressed into the one area that made Tony keen like a wild animal. He was undone. The legs in the air behind Steve shaking, his hips undulating, trying so hard to hump back onto the toy, to gain as much pleasure as he could from the amazing buzz that rocked his body.
At least I don't think I am. So can we stop with the nasty attitudes?" His body went slack, his anger diffusing into concession. "I don't know what I did," he pleaded, looking back and forth between them both, "but whatever it is must be pretty bad to have even someone I considered family angry with me." Pausing, Howard swallowed, visibly upset, "I just wanted to see Steve again. I'll work on getting home and be out of your hair. I'm… I'm just happy he's okay."
He snorted, "Long and hard!"
to have something work out in my favor."
He knelt to the ground, moving the bags away enough that they wouldn't interfere with the shot. The boy unabashedly threw his arms around him.
"Gentlemen, I'm Ryan, may I start you with a drink?"
Steve ushered Tony into the room with a sweeping gesture of his arm, Tony's file grasped in his hand. He was careful to use the file to block the chart from Tony's view, keeping his movements natural but deliberate. He waited until Tony was seated and had pulled off his glasses to drop his arm. He knew from being Tony's eye doctor for so many years just how bad his vision was; Tony would be unable to make out any letters without the help of the Phoropter machine.
Barton answered for her. "He's a time traveling experiment gone wrong.
"Are you going to do a full body exam, Doctor?" Tony asked, stretching his arms up as Steve removed his shirt.
Then there were the migraines, his nails brittle and breaking, the pure exhaustion, the weight loss, his stomach so distended that he would have sworn he was going to burst, and the brain fog. That was the worst. He would sit in his workshop, hell bent on getting something done, and his mind would just… leave. He couldn't focus; he kept forgetting. Things a genius like himself should never have to deal with.
He forgot his wallet at a restaurant. Forgot his cellphone on a bench in Gramercy Park. Forgot meetings, and dinners, to call Steve when he returned safely from a business trip. Sometimes he would forget where he put a tool, not five minutes after he set it down.
Steve's laughter trailed off into the room and Tony ended up being twenty minutes late to meet Happy.
Steve deflated, turning to watch as the paramedics rushed over to them.
He was gone.
"I'm not your assistant anymore, but I think I can make you some for old times sake. Don't get used to it," he could almost hear her eyes rolling. "I'll be back in a few days; I'll be over as soon as I can get away, promise."
is that we have a rare opportunity to give someone we care about some closure."
Tony's eyes opened groggily. "Rhodey?"
Chuckling, Steve pulled out, eliciting a moan from the man underneath him, "Let me clean you up, and then I have to go save our sweet assassin."
It was sweet, in a twisted, messed up way, but Steve swiftly put a stop to it.
Steve paused in putting on the other sock. "I'm going to keep a tally of everyone asking me that."
Tony took those rules very seriously.
"Tony, no!" The repulsors fired twice before the dragon, still controlled by Large and Beady, swiftly spun, its tail reaching high, and knocked Tony right out of the sky. He landed hard, skidding across the pavement and bouncing over the curb before he came to a silent stop. "Tony! Iron Man! Report!" Without a single thought to himself or anyone else, Steve took off in a run. Tony was too far, more a block ahead, and the dragon was closer. "Take him out!" Steve screamed, pleading for anyone on his team to act, "Take him out! Don't let him near Tony!"
"You gonna tell me who Cara is?"
Tony sighed, setting his cup back down. The delicate china clincked against its saucer, a cutting sound that sliced through their thoughts.
He feels like he's under water, like he did the few moments after he hit the ice before unconsciousness took away the pain. It's jarring. Confusing. If Tony is dead, then Steve can never tell him. And that's not right. That's not how the story ends, it can't be! He has to tell him, has to at least take the chance of holding Tony close and saying those words. It's not right. It's not fair.
She shrugged, "I'm good at what I do," and smiled that evil smile she had. Man, was she good at that. "Also, you're off your game when you're hungover. Might want to work on that."
"Go on," he smirked, leaning down to blow a breath of air over the tip, "guess."
"I was gloating because I knew you were both in love with each other!" She paused, "Also it was kinda fun watching you two suffer and flirt and not fucking realize it."
Steve chuckled, "Of course, angel." He lapped over Tony's other nipple, grazing his teeth over it, his hands working deftly at the drawstring to Tony's pants. "I need to be in you,
The blonde on the right beamed, "Hi, Tony!"
"No, thank you."
"Forever."
"Why didn't you tell me?"
"No!" The voice came from nowhere, and Steve felt his heart drop. They had left him in the tower, where they thought to keep him safe, but Howard Stark wouldn't be who he was if he didn't take unnecessary risks. "Get away from my son!"
Tony was quiet for a moment, his inquisitive nature warring with his lust. "Ah, fuck," he relented, squirming around in an attempt to right himself on the couch. Steve looked down at him, a fond and amused expression on his face.
He shot up quickly, his heart beating fast before the events of the day before crashed back into focus.
"It's amazing, Tony hardly sings on it at all," Clint joked, making Tony throw his head back in laughter.
Tony suffered panic attacks often enough that Steve knew exactly how to help him. He knew how to ground him, how to bring him back from the traumas of his past. He could anchor Tony like no one else had ever been able.
"How are you feeling?"
But Happy being there meant the paparazzi knew that it was likely going to be Tony coming out of the revolving doors to the tower, and they were in a frenzy.
Bruce takes the phone from Steve's hands, hitting the end button and placing it on the coffee table. "We need to call Pepper."
"His feet just go flying over his head as he sailed over the kitchen island. It was beautiful. Majestic as fuck." Clint laughed, miming the fall with his hands. "Then
Much thanks to my betas!
Something flashed across Howard's face, a spark of recognition, but it was gone before Tony could fully decipher it. "Bad?"
He had felt so positive that he was right, so incredibly certain that everything he was feeling was
"Why me? I'm not sure I've ever been the voice of reason. Circus freak, remember?" She was already headed toward the door, and he jumped up, blocking her. "I'm not saying I won't, but come on, let's be serious here. None of us are very good at remaining objective. I'm just being honest."
Howard raised his eyebrows but said nothing, instead choosing to sit on the armchair. "Ask away."
And anyway, it wasn't like there was a rule saying that there was a cap on how many best friends one could have. This wasn't high school. But Bruce had been alone so long that it was hard to just let go sometimes and allow himself to be loved.
"Steady, it's only me."
to blow something up."
With his nose buried in one of their discarded Starkpads - and Natasha knew he really shouldn't be looking at that if he was who he said - she was able to quietly swing down and snag his abandoned scotch glass before swinging back up and making her way to Bruce's lab.
"Everything okay, Tony?"
Bruce had told him what had happened that morning. The furious blinking away of tears, the anger, and the compassion he showed in bringing a meal to Howard.
Dum-E poked him again and made an inquisitive sound. "Are you all right?" He seemed to be asking. Tony laid a comforting hand on him, smiling softly. Who said robots couldn't love?
It's surreal. He could have wheeled him over then lifted Tony from chair to cushion, but instead, he stops Clint at the doorway where the archer was pushing him and scoops Tony up into his arms. He's warm and steady. Careful with Tony's broken body.
"I have a packet here, of information concerning celiac." Natasha took the packet from the folds of her jacket and placed it on the table. "But maybe you could help us, Bruce?"
"You're all mouth is what you are," Tony grumbled, lifting into his elbows and pushing himself up into a sitting position.
"No," Bruce poked him, causing Tony to bend over a bit and suppress a giggle, almost dropping the bowl, "still rock solid there, GQ!"
"Is it? Tony, you need to let go of Howard. The one you grew up with anyway. Let him go. He's dead. He can't hurt you anymore."
"Now it's my turn." He looked back at Pepper. "Set it up."
Steve scoffed, and Bruce threw him a glare. He schooled his features. "Just because Howard decided to take a trip through time doesn't mean he gets to monopolize Tony's time."
Never before had Tony felt so on fire with arousal without having all that much attention paid to his cock. His body was trembling with need, and Steve was still fully dressed. Tony clawed at his shirt, trying to pull it over the blond's head, and Steve laughed quietly.
The voicemail was still saved on her phone, but she had listened to it enough to memorize it. The first time, her mouth had gone slack at the shock of it, and she had called Tony immediately, but through his slew of
"Not with Asshole around."
When the bed dips, Tony has to grip the edge to keep from rolling toward him. His knuckles go white with the strain.
"But...?" Tony prompts, his anxiety beginning to rise.
"I know. But I'd be lost without you, angel."
"Oh, I see how it is, it's only okay if you do it."
"And he'll probably throw you a party for showing that your sense of humor is as infantile as his."
Bruce chuckled lightly, "I wouldn't say aloof. But they have major trust issues-" he walked over to the dining room table, pushing several contracts around and plucking one from the pile.
"No, fuck, no. Forget I said anything." Linking their hands together, Tony rolled his body, letting his eyes flutter closed as he felt Steve shift inside him.
As Steve dipped his tongue just past the muscle, Tony's mouth fell slack. He let out a long, high pitched moan, his hand flying from the back of the chair to Steve's head, pulling him closer to his hole. Steve took the opportunity for what it was and used his hands to spread Tony even farther, delving into him, licking and sucking and biting until Tony was writhing on the chair, gasping and moaning, his cock heavy and fully erect, waving in the air above his abdomen.
"He's an idiot," she says, and Tony feels his heart drop, "but he's my idiot. And he's a great judge of character. Welcome, Mr. Stark." She turns and leaves, and Tony looks at Coulson like he's about to flee.
"In and out! Bruce! I can't get him to- I need help!"
"They're extraordinarily talented.
But he wasn't. Howard was staring straight ahead, a confused look on his face.
) as he spoke of the more severe, alcohol induced beatings and Jesus fucking Christmas. Howard knew he was a lot of things. Smart, annoying, driven,
"I like when he changes into the Hulk! It's super cool!"
"Steve," Tony whined. But the soldier wasn't having it.
Tony bites back the urge to shrug. "Technology, I believe." Clint gives him a look that screams
They're so close that Tony can feel the heat of Steve's breath on his face. "Okay, Steve."
Tony jolted, his gasp coming out guttural and hoarse as he came, shuddering and jerking with the force of his climax. Feeling the wetness spread across his abdomen, Steve let go, relinquishing what little command he had over his body and letting his orgasm cascade over him, filling Tony again.
Steve pulled a small serving dish from the cabinet and filled it with butter cookies. He arranged the rest to fit the platter and picked the tray up before cursing softly to himself and setting it back down. He'd forgotten the spoons and napkins. His fault, really, for listening more than doing.
Sitting up, Steve pulled Tony into his arms, kissing him deeply. "Now, about dinner," he asked, kissing the tip of Tony's nose, "would you like to accompany me? I
"Perhaps, but you're miles from where 1961 is. Seeing how ferocious you all were about protecting them I-" he paused, his hand hovering over a spoon. "I realized that my ideals are outdated in these times, and as a scientist, it's my job to adapt with new developments, not harbor old ones. I wouldn't be a very good engineer if I didn’t."
It was softer, somehow, and sweeter. They were exhausted, the movements measured and slow, Steve sleepily fucking up into him, his hand around the genius' dick. Tony rolled his hips, bringing Steve in and out as he moved, the positioning perfect for direct stimulation to his prostate. His right arm up and cupping the back of Steve's head, his own pressed against the hard shoulder behind him.
look into other illnesses and do the same, because
Stepping into the kitchen, Rhodey pulled him into a hug. Tony was stiff but went with it, his hands frozen midair. Rhodey could smell the sickly sweet of the syrup from the plate. "He told me what was going on," Rhodey held him tighter, "said he thought you'd need me here."
"Throw in those pancakes you make from scratch, and we have a deal."
Steve leaned down, "You can kiss me." He knew Tony needed contact, and not just any; he needed to feel loved and appreciated without any obligation. Contact he never received from Howard. Until they were able to get his father back to his own time, Tony's mental health was probably going to be as up and down as the March weather. Steve needed to do what he could to stabilize it.
"Nooooo...."
cold when they finally got around to it.
are not so subtle when you gloat."
He followed Tony through the thick cloud, passed the bandstand, and the barrels, through a dirty curtain, and behind a heavy door. A small space where Tony conducted his business when in this particular bar. The bodyguards stood a silent vigil outside the door.
Steve chuckled, "Me too." He tugged Tony's hand. "I want to make love to you, and every single fanfiction trope."
"So what? You made a stupid choice. No reason to live the rest of your life under it. It happened. It's over." When Howard moved to walk away, Tony caught his arm. "I get to meet the real you now. And that-- that feels good. It feels right. So, cut the shit. You want to make up for what happened, well-" He spread his arms, indicating not only him but the tower, Steve, the other Avengers… "-Here's your chance."
In the morning, Tony slipped into the shower with Steve, running his hands up his chest and kissing the tension he felt there. He let Steve take him against the wall, fast and passionate, Steve's teeth leaving marks on his shoulder. He shook with his climax, knees growing weak, and allowed Steve to carry him back to bed. There, they stayed until the afternoon, teasing and edging each other until they tumbled away into the first fully restful sleep they had in days.
"Later," Tony promised, "not right now." His eyes opened, looking up at Steve pleadingly. "I can't think about food right now."
Tony winced, looking at Steve a little guiltily. "It was needed, as I said, but I didn't mean to upset him."
He shelved the mug, not wanting to look at a word that held so much meaning without anything to back it up, and plucked another blindly. It was a Thor cup, the handle being an upside-down hammer. And really,
"Despite never saying it aloud, and prior to the fanfiction, you are very easy to read."
The tea bag dropped into the hot water with a splash.
Steve contemplated. "Okay. You're on."
Tony swallowed. How exactly did Natasha know so many details of their dinner? Their conversation? How Tony had tucked himself into the hoodie for warmth?
"Think we're in trouble with El Capitan."
Hey all! I edited this chapter to hopefully make it better. ❤💙 The story will be slowly renovated. This was one of my first attempts back into writing after ten years and since I've completed it, most of what I learned has come back to me. 10/28/2020
He could tell Bruce was weighing his next words. He always shifted from one foot to the other when he felt he had something important to say but didn't know how to voice it. Steve was patient, waiting him out with a calm understanding. The doors opened when Bruce finally found the words.
Natasha paused at the door to her room that led to the hallway. It was open just enough to hear the raised voices in the living room. Across the hall, she could see Clint staring back at her with wide eyes, his own door open just a crack as well. She waved her hand, motioning for him to come into her quarters. He peeked his head out, checking to see if the coast was clear, and skirted across the floor and into her room, shutting the door soundlessly behind him.
Bruce swatted at him, "Gross!"
Howard wasn't just a bad father. He neglected Tony. Had physically hurt him as well, if Clint was reading the situation correctly, and that meant that
"Whatever, I didn't want pancakes anyway," she huffed, crossing her arms, but the tapping of her foot gave her away.
Enjoy!
"Thor Odinson, you put me down this instant!"
Chuckling softly, Steve carefully removed Tony's octopus hold from his body. "Shower, then we'll talk."
Clint smirked, "Tutt tutt, Captain Rogers. Language!"
"Didn't think so."
"It's not your fault, right?"
too much.
"Natasha."
"Hah! That's not a no!"
"Okay, fine, but I'm still calling you Asshole," he paused for effect, "Asshole."
A well placed elbow to the ribs had Clint doubled over, but all it did was help him misplace whatever control he had. He lost it, giggling and laughing so hard tears started to stream down his face. "Clint!" But the euphoria of the night hadn't worn off of Bruce either, and he felt his face split open into a wide grin. "Barton, conceal! Don't feel!"
"What?"
"Oh, wow," Tony said, impressed, as they reached the exhibit. The photographer had taken photos of individual pieces of rubble and constructed them together to form an arch around the door to the room. "That's actually kinda cool."
"Aw, was little Clinton scared of the nice Russian lady?"
With a giggly laugh (and Tony would rib him for that later), Steve stepped behind Tony as they walked through the door, sliding his hands around to cup Tony's, ah, belly under his shirt.
"It was a very cozy closet," Steve sasses right back, leaning forwards a little and lifting an eyebrow, "and we made a rather comfy home. But what's the fun in that if we can't have friends over to visit?"
. His son! They looked a fair bit alike, he'd give into that, but Tony's eyes were something else. Big and brown, soulful and deep. They looked like...well, they looked like Maria's. The thought of starting a family with the beautiful Italian he had just started dating should have sent him into fits of joy. Maria was
Steve is gentle as he wraps the casts and washes him, edging around the arc reactor and rubbing lightly over the bruising and scrapes. When he washes Tony's hair, Steve lets him rest his neck on his left forearm, and lathers with his right hand, always conscious to not allow any soapy water to get into Tony's eyes.
Tin Man.
He loved movies, especially those from the Golden Age of Hollywood, and they bonded over Cary Grant and Gene Kelly, Veronica Lake and Lauren Bacall. Spoke of their crushes on both and giggled at the old horror movies, throwing popcorn at the screen and yelling at the characters.
Thor was waiting outside when they pulled back up at the tower. Tony's face split into a grin -- it had been a while since he had seen the Asgardian.
Clint whipped his cell out and tapped, her phone going off a moment later. "Really?" She glared at him, eyebrows raised.
"Oh no, you did not just say that."
Steve hid under the blankets, laughing, "Maybe!"
"Fuck no. Let that animal out more often!"
another concern, that being the drunk archer and the even more inebriated time traveler. And the fact that he had no interest in tempting the Other Guy by going anywhere near Howard Stark.
The ding of the elevator arriving on their floor cut off any answer he had.
A sob escapes his throat. "He can't be!"
Howard's head shot up, surprise painted across his handsome features. "You did?"
The switch in demeanor was quick, meant to throw Steve off his guard. It worked enough that Steve answered, "About two years ago."
She tilted her head, surprised. "I have to admit, Mister Stark, I wasn't expecting that from you."
One of him flying, a blast of light shooting from his hands, one of he and Steve, reflecting the repulsers off of the shield, him and Clint, as he gave him a ride up to a building...pictures he never remembered posing for, the photographer in danger every step of the way but determined to capture the battle. Unobtrusive to the point that until Tony caught the man's reflection in a not yet shattered window in a photo of the Hulk, he never would have known exactly what he looked like.
"It was on MY chair." And Tony spun away from Steve with a ridiculous flourish, like he had just won some great battle of wits (he didn't.). "Coffee?” He cringed as the thumping grew louder. “Also, that's not annoying at all."
He clamored to his knees, bringing one up to ready himself to stand when a hand shot it to help him. It was Howard, because of course it was, and Tony couldn't find a reason to ignore it that wouldn't make the situation worse.
The movements caused the blankets to fall away from Steve's body, but it didn't register at all. Heat built around them, partly from the fire and partly from the passion. They worshipped one another. Praying at the alters of each other's body, a hymn of sex and adoration and unyielding love. Heaven mixed with the fires of hell, baptised in come and sweat. Anointed with love and desire.
"Guess not. I did all the hard work. Again." He snorted.
Sweat had gathered along Tony's back, and he slipped down the couch, laying flat on his back. His knees were bent and up, the muscles aching with the positioning, but he didn't care.
over it." She let that one word hang over them, swinging back and forth like a pendulum.
And maybe it would.
It took a moment for Howard to gather his words, Thor could see him struggling. He looked away, studying the door frame and Thor could easily imagine he was looking into the hours past. "He told me," he gasped out, "about him and-and Steve. About how they are gay. And in love. But he used another word, he said-"
He released it and moved to hover over the arc reactor, looking at Tony for permission.
"You know, I'm a growing boy."
"What's a Pepper?"
"You can't resist me forever, Rogers!" Tony sang out, giving in to the need to shower. "I'll get details from Bruce, you heathen!" He pulled his phone from the extra charging stand he kept in Steve's room, scrolling through his recent calls. Putting the phone up to his ear, he listened to it ring, "Babe, what do you want for lunch?"
"I love you too, angel." Standing, Steve bent over to kiss Tony's forehead and left the room. Tony closed his eyes to savor the moment, replaying Steve's words over and over in his mind until he thought he could bring them up on a whim, something to keep him warm for the days and weeks ahead.
Rocking his head side to side, weighing how to answer, Steve crossed his arms. "No one I wish to discuss with you, but I can say that this person is the absolute love of my life. Knock next time.
"So I'm learning."
"Probably finish that movie with Steve," he said, catching Steve's eyes and smiling, "then go to bed. I have actual work to do in the morning. This thing," he wiggled the tablet, "is supposed to have a new model coming out in a few months, and I need to finish the upgrades to the OS, er, operating system."
Rolling her eyes, she muttered something that suspiciously sounded like
"This is weird." Tony said.
Steve, pulling orange juice from the fridge, heaved an exaggerated sigh, "Guess it's just you and me, Brucie."
"We love you for it!"
In the doorway stood Tony, frozen. A look of panic freezing his features.
Overwhelmed for a moment at the maturity and love with which Tony spoke, Steve had to take a deep breath to steady himself. "I'm so proud of you for coming to terms with your abuse. That's a huge step. That's number one, and it's so important that you accept the things you can't change." He tugged Tony back down, resting his chin against his head. "And I promise I'll step back and stop trying to insert my opinion in everything. I don't mean to be so self-righteous. I just want everyone I love safe and happy."
Back in the kitchen, Natasha was standing at the counter, poking through the cabinets, "Hungry?"
Breathing heavy, the phone fell from his chest, where he had laid it when he grabbed himself.
"Like twice, Rogers, and that doesn't count!"
Steve visibly moaned, "That's...that's so sexy." He closed his eyes, imagining. "Not tonight, but fuck, I want to use them on you."
unashamed) and grabbed his cell from the charging dock, "I'll see you in a bit."
And then they had argued. Fought about him. Like it was the beginning of his and Steve's relationship and every get-together with Rhodey ended with some misguided shovel talk and an argument about what was best for him.
Another smack. "You're getting precome on my pants, slut. Knock it off." Steve glared at the body on his lap, but Tony couldn't control his movements. He let out a guttural groan, his fingers going to his own hair and grasping it.
"Howard, no! You need to back up!" The Other Guy didn't like people in Bruce's face, and though he tried, he felt his control slipping.
Tony struggled weakly for only a moment. They weren't usually so affectionate. But if there was one thing Rhodey had learned throughout his years of knowing him, it was that when Tony felt off, he needed the contact. It grounded him in ways nothing else could.
Steve began walking towards the bedroom. "I love you."
"And what if this is it? What if this is what's holding me back? And forgiving him…"
"You bet," Steve brought his hand up to cup the back of Tony's head, kissing him again, deeper this time, trying to pour all the confidence and contentment he felt into it. When he pulled back, Tony beamed at him.
"Who is she?" Howard inquiried. "How did you even get her up here without my knowing?" There was a bit of pride for Steve flashing across his handsome face.
"Help! I need an adult!" Tony yelled, hopping over a stack of newspapers and sprinting across the street.
"Hey, stop doing that." There was a rustle of the leather couch as Rhodey moved. "Stop picking at your fingers, Tony."
She looked incredulous. "Firstly, how is that not treating him any differently, secondly, of course he's not okay, his dead father is in the guest room!"
"Thanks. Any questions, just ask JARVIS, he'll walk you through."
- had dropped on him.
"Whatever." She pulled her phone out and plopped into the couch. "It all sounds good. Do what's easy." His head popped out of the kitchen, one finger raised and an impish look on his face. She threw a hand up to stop him before the words could leave his mouth. "You'll want to think long and hard about what you're about to say."
"Which Stark?" Tony sassed, shooting a feisty glare at Clint.
Steve tries again, but still he can't put a voice to what he needs to say. So, he just keeps hugging Tony and doesn't say that he loves him.
He laughed loudly. "Shut up, you idiot. You know for what."
Steve grinned at his reaction. "I'd like to ask your permission to marry your son."
Looking back to Clint, Steve nods. "Same, only make mine a double. Deluxe."
For several moments, Howard was quiet. He stepped up to Dum-E, petting him. The robot whirred and leaned into the touch.
Tony tugged the waistband down and was rewarded with the first sight of Steve's cock. Eight inches, at least, and a girth that absolutely looked the perfect size to fill Tony up, but not make him uncomfortable. "Speaking of beautiful," he purred, darting his tongue out to taste the precome that danced on the tip. Steve groaned, low in his throat.
Natasha picked up a fresh piece and rolled her eyes. "Vodka doesn't have a smell, idiot."
That was Steve's first hint to how wrong the situation was. The second was that Tony wasn't overtly working on anything. Steve watched from behind the glass wall for a few minutes, studying Tony's form as he sat, pulling out wires from one of his gauntlets and tossing them. To the unknowing eye, Tony was busy doing what he did the best, which was building. Steve knew better. This was Tony throwing himself into anything in order to distract himself. Fixing problems that he invented with an anxious mind, could bes, maybes, might happens… It often helped to solve issues before they arose, and if Tony was anything, he was definitely a problem solver and proactive in anticipating what could potentially go wrong. An engineer at heart.
"I did."
Howard nodded and followed him to the couch, sitting and leaning back into the corner of it. "If I may-" he began, his face open and earnest, "I know my fault in this. I really am so sorry. I had no right-"
"That's okay. You can have it. Looks better on you," Steve remarked, reaching over Tony's head to lift the can of Chock Full o' Nuts and hand it to him. Tony almost went red at the statement. Almost.
He was completely, fully, irreversibly done with it all. Which led to him the end-cap at the Kirby's Market and Delicatessen torn between the cinnamon tea and the hibiscus. On one hand, the cinnamon tea was a comforting favorite. He knew he would like it. It was delicious and the type of warmth he craved. On the other hand, he had never tried hibiscus tea before, and it could
"You came to see Steve," she said, clasping her hands in front of her. "Bit off more than you could chew?"
Thank you all so much!
The backhand had sent Tony sailing to the floor. He cried out and slammed his hand over his mouth to stop any more sounds from escaping.
Cast the spell and if Steve was found in the future, he'd be taken right to him. Consequences be damned. He wanted to know where Steve was, find him sooner. Worrying about things like getting back was insignificant. He'd find a way back. He always landed on his feet. He'd be fine.
After years of feeling like he wasn't good enough, Tony was given the approval from the real Howard, and it worked wonders on his insecurity.
"What's going on?"
"Just like his daddy!" Tony lets Steve decide which of them that is.
Steve didn't look convinced, but his face softened, if only a little. "Howard, you need to go home."
Howard, so angry over a skipped class, he'd beaten Tony with a belt.
He was tragically beautiful, and no, Steve would never say that out loud.
Feed my poor ego and leave a comment? Pretty please with a naked Steve and Tony on top???
Which reminded Howard that he hadn't had anything to drink the entire day, and his body was trembling lightly.
Steve gave a jerk of his hips, grinning as Tony's head fell back. "You gonna argue with me over
"Yeah, well, it's nice to hear it. You're welcome, Tony. You've done the same for me."
Howard's head tilted to the side, a small amount of confusion growing on his face. "I thought you said you were okay now?"
"Damn it."
a fair bit alike.
Stomach gurgling in a plea for food, Steve pushed aside his own discomfort and gestured to the toast, "Take a bite?" He could see Tony was fighting with his own body's needs versus his want to curl up and pretend he didn't exist. "Just one?"
The doors opened, and Steve patted his back as he stepped on. "You are a hero, Bruce."
Steve's hand wrapped around him, jerking his dick, pulling guttural moans and heavy breaths as his fingers dug into the skin of the taller man's back. Drawing him in, marking him as belonging to Tony. Marks that Steve would look at in the mirror in the days to come and grow instantly hard from.
"Beautiful name for a beautiful woman," he grinned, leaning toward her, his eyes dancing flirtatiously.
The next morning brought a slight headache (wine hangover, ugh!), and Natasha fucking Romanoff sitting at the foot of his bed, playing on her phone.
Steve's breath caught. He didn't know Tony ever paid that much attention to poetry or his ramblings about their meanings. Certainly not enough to say what Steve thought he was trying to say.
The internet really was enlightening, but that meant he knew without a doubt that he was no longer around. That didn't mean he couldn't set plans into motion; Howard was never known to be a quitter. Number one being that as soon as he got back, he'd unfreeze Steve the second it was possible. That was in the original plan, but now it was imperative. He needed Steve as the catalyst. The impetus that would fix
Tony's mouth closed around him, wrapping his lips over his teeth, and using his hand as a guide, sucking Steve hard and fast, the soldier gasping and clinging to Tony's hair, his hips stuttering as he fought to keep himself still. "Oh, Tony, oh, God..." He was moaning, head dropped forwards and eyes clenched shut. "Tony, fuck!"
"Fucking starved."
"Do that and you're headed to Nassau Community College quicker than you can say Jackie Robinson!"
. His own flesh and blood.
"Tony!" But Steve was laughing too hard to finish.
"Not if he starts to feel better," Steve added. "He's lost so much weight."
To make his decision, Tony started to read. Just the beginning, he thought, just to see how badly he wanted to finish and if it was worth waiting until he got to his own bed.
"Didn't mean to interrupt! But, ah, Steve? Relax, it's just me. Your lady friend is safe! I don't steal! Promise!" Holding his hands up, Howard shot his best innocent grin. "But I will offer my congratulations on having a little piece." As unexpected as this was, perhaps it meant common ground between them; he would take any opening he could (and so did Steve, apparently).
"Then go get me a stick and the milk."
have issues. It's not a matter of packing a bag and sending them to rehab, they've been there, done that. They're damaged goods, Nick. Obie Stane himself is enough to keep me away from them, hell, keep
"I love you." He would never get sick of saying that.
Splayed on Steve's lap, with his thighs wrapped around Steve’s waist and his arms braced on the floor, Tony gasped. His back arched as his cock gave another jerk, Steve's fingers pulsing inside him. They'd been playing all night. Edging Tony, bringing him close then backing off. Tony was a beautiful wreck, and Steve loved him that way.
Steve placed a kiss on top of his head, "So? Good news?" Tony looked up at him. "Bad news then."
"Nat, we talked about this respecting privacy thing…"
Tony is knee-deep in schematics to rebuild the suit that got him out of the cave. He looks up at Coulson guiltily. "Ah," sliding the toolbox in front of him over, he attempts to block Coulson's view of what's obviously a blueprint for the armor, "you know I already have a job, right?"
Unable to help the sigh of dismay, Steve let his head fall to the side. "Tony!"
Climbing onto the bed and plopping next to Steve, still naked but content, Tony handed him a plate stacked with sandwiches and tossed two bottles of water onto the bedding. They ate and drank their fill and pushed the plate to the floor along with the empty bottles, and Steve took him again.
"You said hell!"
At some point, right after Steve had woken up, he would have been overjoyed to see a face from his past, especially this one. But at that moment, Steve could only let his eyes follow Tony's escape as he jerked free of Howard's exuberance and chased after the fleeing form of his boyfriend. "Tony, wait!"
She picked up her knife, "That can be arranged."
Losing Tony was bad enough, but it might mean she'd lose Steve as well.
Because if he wasn't, then why would anyone keep him around?
"They came out to Howard." Rhodey stopped short, his heart dropping. Bruce, unaware at first that Rhodey had ceased his steps, kept going. He froze several feet from Rhodey, realizing, and turned. "Col. Rhodes?"
Thor, he was positive wasn't in any way involved, but he told him he liked wake-boarding. Not even a real kink, but the Asgardian used his tablet to read, so a Google search history would prove he wasn't involved.
"Spit it out, Barton."
It's a brisk January morning when Steven G. Rogers realizes with a sudden and jolting burst that he loves Anthony E. Stark.
"Howard," Steve repeated again with a deep breath, "
"Because we think it's what you're eating that's making you feel like this. So, if you won't go to the doctor, we're going to try changing your diet. Ours too. We'll eat what you eat, I promise."
"I entered and he came up to me. I was fascinated." Howard shrugged sheepishly. "I wanted to see how he worked, you know, trying to keep my mind off of what happened." Tony nodded in understanding, staying quiet for once so Howard could finish. "And he shoved the tennis ball into my face. Imagine my confusion. JARVIS helped out, said Dum-E really likes fetch and he's basically a robotic dog. Also, Dum-E? Really? That's what you name him?"
her!"
"Shut up. Go read. Don't jack off on any pro-bono projects."
"Out like a light," Steve remarked, "don't think he had much left in him after seeing Howard."
Rhodey jolted.
"No!" He wrenches away from the physicist, standing and viciously wiping tears. "No! Not until we know for sure!"
like him. When Tony had told him that not only was Steve found but
Throwing her head back in a sigh, Natasha groaned. "God, you're clueless. Anyway," she hurried on, "I take it you liked the next installment?"
Being with Tony and living and serving with the Avengers had done wonders to Steve's psyche. It had healed the biggest holes inside of him, but something had still been missing: A way to reach back to his past and relive it through memories. With the Avengers he could only go back so far. Back to when they all first met. And it was nice reliving their moments together, trading stories even though they had all been present. Reminiscing. But each of the Avengers had someone else in their lives to reach further back with. Tony had Rhodey, Natasha and Clint had each other…
See you all tomorrow! 😈
The thought of never seeing Tony again sent a pang of something through his heart. He couldn't be falling for him! He barely knew him! And anyway, two men couldn't be in a relationship together, it just ain't right.
Because of course he was. But even though it was Natasha who asked, Bruce called Steve. He didn't know what Tony's mindset was at the moment, but he did know Steve could be counted on to best relay the information. And Tony
Another deep and phlegmy cough. "Ain't never had nothing like first class before."
"Genius," he mumbled instead, kissing Steve's arm.
this awkward?"
of dollars for the best therapists money can buy. I don't need another one, you mother hen."
She had been there from the beginning. Sure, Rhodey had been too, but he was oftentimes unavailable. Pepper was Tony's daily support, and that meant something bigger. She was there when he returned from Afghanistan, there through the whole debacle with Stane, there through it all. She had seen Tony through his manic building frenzies and his inevitable collapse afterwards. Had seen him go through countless one night stands searching for
"Do they really?"
Was he missing too many pieces of his own?
It didn't take much to convince Tony to leave the tower, and he wasn't sure how they did it but when they left at noon, Howard was nowhere to be seen.
"Don't mention it," Bruce said, plopping the cookies in front of Tony. "We're just glad you're going to be okay."
Steve bent Tony's neck forward to kiss his head. It was so gentle, so loving, so much of everything Tony didn't even know he needed. "I know. I want to know it all, Tony. The good and the bad."
"Not for you it ain't," chastised Steve, hooking his hand under Howard's elbow and steadying him. "There's a guest room, right off the kitchen. You can stay there."
"No way!" He laughed, "He's making Tony and me pancakes because I saved him from having to save
they don't need the help." He sat back. "Eighteen months. That's what I want to see."
Tony gasped as the cool lubricant hit him, pressing his forehead into his folded arms in front of him. He was too pretty like this. Too beautiful for words. All wanton and needy, breathless and desperate, and when Steve straddled his thighs and pushed into him, it was like all the air had been forced from his lungs. He was going to suffocate on Tony, and no other death could ever suffice.
Slowly, Howard dropped his head, his gaze falling to the floor in between Tony's feet. He was defeated, that's what he was. He was defeated, and he was underwater.
"Excuse me?"
out of here."
"I seem to remember only promising a blow job."
Howard nodded. "No problem."
So Steve did. He thrust, hard and fast into the compliant man below him, taking his pleasure as much as he was giving it. Tony's body rocked, his back arching, and his head twisting and turning in absolute bliss. He had never felt like this: So undone, so worshipped.
"Think I could get contacts, Doc?" Tony asked, blinking up at Steve blindly as he folded his glasses and placed them on his lap.
." He was saying it now just to get under Steve's skin.
Chuckling, Tony ran his fingers through Steve's hair. "Never thought I'd actually get to see this. To have you do this."
There were fewer than outside the tower but still an annoyance. He made his way just as stoically as he did before, keeping his head up and ignoring the questions fired at him. Sometimes, being famous really was a bitch.
Snorting, Steve sent a harassed look at Tony, "Didn't we do that this morning?"
Tony slipped an arm around Steve's waist and leaned up on his toes to kiss his cheek. "And I appreciate it. Lord knows I was too scared to make a move. Although, I still need to have an actual eye exam. This prescription is no longer good."
As promised, when Steve returned with two tall glasses filled with the smoothie, he dutifully drank one as Steve drank the other. He let Steve take his hand and lead him to the bathroom, let him carefully strip him of his dirty clothing before taking off his own. In the shower, Steve gently cleaned Tony's body, washing his hair and kissing his skin as he rinsed him. Tony felt his resolve slipping, but he remained strong in his decision. When Steve kissed him, Tony kissed back passionately, pouring all of his love into it.
"There's more."
"Also, you're draped over a railing in Central Park."
Tony was in bed sleeping when Rhodey let himself into the suite, curled up on his side and hidden by the blankets. It was disturbingly quiet. Usually the dishwasher was running, the television was on, or Tony had music playing. At the very least, he and Steve -- and sometimes the others -- would be on the couch chatting away like high schoolers in the cafeteria. Open containers of takeout on the coffee table, half empty tea cups and discarded saucers, and shoes piled by the door, a hammer hanging on the hook… All signs of the family Tony had made for himself.
