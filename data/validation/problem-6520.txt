“I feel like we should start over.” Diplomatic. Obie says being approachable is good. “I’m Tony Stark.”
"I'm guessing you need to go?" Steve carefully says. He's learned that crowding up the ER isn't a good thing, and he suddenly becomes uncomfortably aware of his large body blocking the way.
He lets the feel of rough paper beneath his fingertips calm him, and the sounds of DUM-E beeping away at his charging station are familiar enough to pull him out of his thoughts.
been getting better at it. Most days, sleeping starts to get easier, the world stops blurring away, he will be able to smile at Steve without the long shadows of their fights looming over them.
Steve frowns. The few times that he had made waffles for breakfast, he hadn’t gotten nearly the same enthusiasm. He cranes his neck to see the pan over the Colonel’s shoulder.
He shoves his hands in his pockets and steps further into the cramped space, picturing Steve's holidays here, all the summers he had asked Tony to come over.
Ostentatious as ever, the diamond stares back up at him. There isn't even a fleck of blood left on it, even though it had been covered in red when Tony had been called up to - to identify their bodies.
Giving Steve a self-satisfied grin, he shakes his head. No. Steve wouldn’t really want to befriend Tony if he knew that Tony thought he could be stupidly reckless.
“Well.” A pause. Tony gives his spoon a quick lick, glancing at the folded-up post it next to his bowl. “There are a few old-fashioned things worth keeping around.”
Tony huffs. “I'm getting your meds from the ambulance.” He stands up. “And paperwork for you to fill.”
Rhodey laughs, taking Tony's hand to stop him from picking at the medical tape keeping the IV needle in place. "I don't envy what Pepper's going to do to you when you get back."
On Tony’s fifteenth birthday, Tony takes them back to the roof of the highest tower. The slanted red tiles are warm even in the darkness, sun-kissed from the early summer.
“Perfect,” Tony steps aside to let Sam pass through the ER’s glass doors, and he smiles at the tall firefighter, “now I get deal with this pest.”
"Mr. Stane wanted the natural light to come in," Pepper says. "Made a whole riot about how it's Central Park out there and the image we need."
, he'd done all that in about the same time it took for Steve goddamn Rogers to become a supersoldier.
No amount of dodging or hiding could stop Obie from finding him, and find him Obie does in the basement of the nearly finished Malibu Mansion. Mid-April means deadlines for the quarterly financial report, which Pepper was meant to handle, but which of course showed the company wasn't doing as well as before Howard's death.
“It was the least I could do,” Jarvis answers. “My young sir writes often of how your son makes him smile.”
"I do." There's a hint of fond amusement in Tony's voice, and Steve considers that a mark of his triumph against HYDRA's insistence on ruining their dates.
Tony's standing now, hand landing on his shoulder, squeezing once before darting away. The touch is enough to quiet him.
Then, before Steve can come up with another quip, Bruce tosses something – a magazine – on the table.
When he finally feels Tony’s knee bump against his, barely an inch between them, he indulgently puts down the StarkPad on their nightstand, shifting the blankets around to cover them both properly.
"If we don't know, then we should find out," Steve argues, pacing the Mansion's empty corridors, not bothering with the lights.
He thinks of the neat lines that had graced Tony's blueprints, of another lifetime when Tony had admitted
Tony tries to work on a phone for Steve, but Obie finds him again and hands him some of Howard's blueprints. "Your father doesn't know about this. He's getting old, and we need someone new. Now, look, I know you're young. I also know you're smart enough for this."
On the other screen, Peggy points at Bucky beside him. "You're dropping Barnes off at the Gulmira airbase. Then you're coming to New York, Captain."
“I have an idea for a cleaner source of energy,” Tony confides to Obie one afternoon. He has other ideas, too: medical technology, crop farming, space exploration.
, and Steve slips into the ER, feeling awkward with his three pizza boxes and bright uniform that turns heads.
Speaking of, "you mentioned a date tonight?" Steve squeezes Tony's hand. The ambulance sirens are growing closer.
There is a battle going on in the streets, ambulance sirens coming closer, and the occasional flashed of lightning coming down from Thor's rage. Their team can handle the last of the bots, Steve decides, giving in entirely to Tony's gentle touches.
Careful to not show his frustration, Tony flips the computer screen. The computer's one of his proudest inventions, slick and simple, even if it's too expensive to market yet, and it'll have to do for a while until he discovers holographic tech.
Strategy was his natural advantage, and a month after that meeting with Fury - when Sam is in deep shadow conditions monitoring the movement of weapons and Bucky is burrowing together with Nat closer to the source of these false trails - Steve continues to stay on high alert.
Their thighs press against each other, Steve's hand resting on Tony's lap, dangerously close to his hip.
Steve shakes his head. “Spent a lot of time on painkillers as a kid,” he gives Tony a tight smile. “Didn't like the feeling much.”
Before everyone else, before Tony had found contentment in the warmth of Steve’s kisses, Rhodey was the first to carve out a home for Tony, decades ago in their dorm room, the first to believe in Tony.
“And the thought of losing your dick would certainly make you miserable,” Tony hums, lips clearly twitching as he tries to smother his laugh.
“We’re both young,” Steve shakes his head. “And you have the entire world. You’ll forget about me soon enough.”
Tapping at Tony's cheek to keep him awake, Steve purses his lips, clearly worried. "Fury should get through in a few minutes."
Part of SHIELD's elite STRIKE team, Steve spends his nights hunting down HYDRA and his days keeping tabs on the people most important to him. If those people also happen to be among the most important people in the world, it's an extra perk that lets him keep Tony safe without too much interference from SHIELD.
Hand shifting from Tony's temple, Steve makes an aborted move towards Tony's own hand. "Stop me if you don't want it?"
The conversation is in safer waters, and Steve lets himself relax slightly. “Tech and electric plugs are a fire hazard.”
There are days that Tony wishes it were easier for him to be Howard’s perfect son. And there are days that his curiosity flares brighter than that. Today, as he sees something dangerous flash in Steve’s eyes, he finds that the curiosity wins.
Friendships have been ruined by things less monumental than lust, and he doesn't think he can stand losing Steve again, especially when they're both tangled in a web of lies and Howard's pride.
Not when she can make Tony laugh. Not when Tony's smile sends something tumbling in Steve, falling and breaking and fracturing promises he made a long time ago.
“What you just did,” Tony meets Steve’s eyes. “Breathe. You’re going on a date, not getting a dressing down from your C.O.”
"Captain, I have isolated the two most likely locations," JARVIS cuts through his wallowing. "Data from MARIA's archives show an uptick of missing palladium-based weapons making their way through the coordinates."
“Alright.” His pacemaker ticks on. He understands the horrid disorientation from too many days on drugs. “I need to sew this up. Think you can handle that?”
He's seen no hint of Tony since he got here ten minutes ago, the fire shows no hint of abating. Whatever chemicals Hammer had spilled to cause such a hot fire, it's persistent and dangerous.
Steve turns back to watch Tony cross the street, disappearing into the crowd. He coughs to clear his throat – to clear his mind.
Tony wants to say something, anything. To lash out, to hurt Steve so he'll stay away from the ticking time bomb, to hold onto Steve because he has always been Tony's shield, Tony's refuge.
The bar and his friends here were all well and good – he's endlessly grateful for them, and yet, when Carol flips her phone screen to him, he can't help the silent sigh of wistfulness tinged with annoyance because
borrow Tony for a moment." Maria takes out a name card. "I'm sure you can arrange something with his latest assistant."
This week they were enjoying the breezy warmth of New York - at least, when Tony wasn't holed up in the lab building a thousand and one new things.
. The late nights, the nightmares, the shitty broken bones and the — ” he leans forward, cupping Tony's cheek with one hand, and splaying his other hand over the scars where Tony's arc reactor used to be, “the strength of your heart, the
“Yeah,” Rogers agrees, “the fire department wins the competition any day, but sharing the victory is caring.”
Immediately, he’s greeted by a family portrait. A woman on a chair, her blonde hair tied into a bun, her painted rosy cheeks contrasting the pinch between her eyes. She’s flanked by two men, who needs no introduction.
Not too long ago this conversation would have seemed surreal to Steve.  Now, though, it felt horribly real.  Real and relatable.  “How’d you realize it was a crush?”
“Nah, we’re just good friends now.  I don’t think he even realized I had feelings for him.  And in any case, it would never work out, dude’s straight as an arrow.”
), this had been happening more and more, this nighttime rumination on a man who seemed determined to drive him crazy, and now it was practically part of his routine.  He supposed it wasn’t that unusual: Tony was a special kind of infuriating, after all, blowing up tech equipment and acting like the resulting burns were all in good fun, promising to come to dinner and then making Steve fetch him like a wife minding her husband in decades past, throwing old conquests in Steve’s face—old conquests’

“For this year’s Pride March,” she explained, giving Tony her patented “you’re a handful and a half, but I love you” side-eye.  Something in Steve’s chest constricted painfully at the sight of it.
—was still pretty new to him; there’d been nothing of the sort back in the ’40s.  He thought it was wonderful, exactly the sort of thing Captain America stood for: the freedom to be yourself, to bare the most intimate parts of your being, without needing to fear that doing so would bring your entire life crashing down around you.  That was a message that resonated with Steve Rogers, too, and he wished there had been something like Pride Month back when he was a kid.  Would’ve been risky as all hell, of course, but who was to say it wasn’t still risky in this day and age?  And what kind of life could someone possibly lead when they were too afraid to be themself out in the open?
“Yeah.”  The noise around them had been drowned out by the sound of Tony’s voice.  “I like going on dates with you, too.”
“What are you doing?” Steve retorted shortly, looking at the purple puddle again.  Cautiously, he went and picked it up; it was soft and slippery in his hands.  A button-up shirt, he realized as he held it up for inspection, made of silk or some such material.  He quirked his eyebrows.  “What’s this?”
“Yo, Purple Mountain Majesties,” Tony called.  Steve started a little, realizing Tony had been trying to speak to him for some time.
, he mimicked silently, and felt his stomach flip again.  He looked down at the shirt, momentarily admiring the nearly electric shade of purple, running the incredibly smooth fabric through his fingers.  It
He was holed up on his floor at the moment, curled up on a cushy window seat in the living room that looked decades more antiquated than anything else that could be found in Avengers Tower.  Off in the distance, the Hudson gleamed dully under the pale, metallic light of an overcast sky.  Billowing feather-gray clouds blanketed the atmosphere, threatening at any moment to unleash another torrent of rain upon the inhabitants of New York.  Steve could see—far, far below—that many of them already had their umbrellas out, a steadily moving stream of rainbow-hued canvases on either side of the busy street.  He wondered, in between stubborn thoughts of Bucky, how many of them were planning on attending the Pride March.
.  Countless nights Steve had lain awake thinking about Tony and Peggy and Bucky; countless dusky mornings he’d spent staring at his painting of the violets, at his carnation in its slim vase of water on the windowsill, wondering how the hell it all came together.  He’d been staring at himself in a metaphorical mirror for a long time now, and he felt no closer to unraveling the mystery of his conflicted feelings at all.  Tony made Steve
Sometimes, still, it got to be too much, all the excitement and his unexpected new happiness, and Steve retreated into a lonely shell of contemplation and self-reflection.  Tony let him be when he got like that—but never for too long.  He always busted in eventually to drag Steve back out into the real world, and Steve, though terrified at times, never failed to end up feeling grateful for it.

a funny guy, had made Steve laugh more than anyone else in the tower by far; and those rare moments that he managed to catch Tony in a moment of quietude, staring out at the Manhattan twilight with a tumbler in hand or totally absorbed in a state of scientific creativity…
The argument was long over, and he and Peggy had more than made up after it, but Steve still winced whenever he recalled the venom in her beautiful voice and what a ginormous bonehead he’d been.  Concentration broken, he blinked in a familiar bit of bewilderment at the canvas, which now depicted a quartet of violets bowed as though in deference.  He eyed the transition of their yellow-white centers to their royal-purple petals critically, thought to himself he didn’t do such a great job capturing the flowers’ texture, but the deed was done.  All in all, not the worst work he’d ever produced.  He glanced at his watch: nearly 16:30.  Time to head home.
“And you went all out for me, huh?”  And there, at last, was that familiar smirk—not a mask to cover up how he was really feeling, but a genuine expression, illuminated with joy.
Tony laughed, a flash of white teeth in the sun.  “I don’t doubt it.  So, how’d you find this place?  Was it when you were hiding from me?” he teased.
His third trance of the morning broken, Steve finally found his voice.  “What exactly are you asking me?” he said cautiously.
“Ooh, there they go, there they go!” Tony exclaimed, nearly hopping up and down in excitement.  He waved crazily with both arms.  “DYKES ON BIKES!”
”—this directed at Pepper, who merely rolled her eyes and shook her head a little—“then Captain America should get one, too.  Whaddaya say?”
Besides, even Tony couldn’t deny that Steve’s humble coffee shop was a nice place.  Shelves stuffed with donated books—beat-up paperbacks and hardcovers with cracked spines—lined the dark walls, and soft light filtered down from large round bulbs dangling from the vaulted ceiling.  That distinctive brew smell permeated the air to the very corners, and the comforting sound of a drip machine was always going somewhere.  The real draw of the place for Steve, though, was the expansive courtyard out back, shaded by trees and ferns on all sides and blooming with riotously colored flowers everywhere you looked.  Groups of benches were arranged in intimate square formations, and tables with wicker chairs pushed under them reclined in the shadows of big striped umbrellas.  It was at one of these tables that Steve and Tony now sat, each nursing a steaming coffee and tiny plates loaded with sandwiches and pastries.
“Or it could have slowed right down, you wouldn’t have wanted that,” Tony said, stroking Bucky’s hair, his hand pausing as it moved over his ponytail. “When you’re feeling ready to talk to someone else, I promise you I’m going to get you the best help, but for now I want you to know you always have me. I’m here for you.”
Steve wanted to call Tony arrogant and tell him that the were leaving the second the chip was out of him, but he couldn’t fault a single action Tony had made since they met. He was willing to save Bucky, he was willing to let him free, and Steve felt a bit guilty that he’d never considered that to be a possibility. He’d damned Tony before they’d even met, unfairly so, so the other man deserved a proper second chance.
“The same kind of things I do in the rest of the day, time doesn’t really matter down here,” Bucky said with a shrug, repositioning himself so that his legs were crossed and his arms were across his chest, hugging himself again. “…I have pretty much every video game ever made, every movie, I have some games I used to play with Jack under my bed, like chess and stuff, some other toys and junk…I don’t know…”
“Hm, I don’t know, what else are we good at?” Steve laughed, watching as Peter ran over, eyeing Bucky’s water before his father gave him the bottle and he ran off again. “He’s going to dump that on Penny’s head, you know.”
“Oh gods no! Of course not, no!” Steve rushed forward, though he stopped within arms distance to Bucky, not knowing if he should close that space. “You’re not gross or ugly at all, you’re incredibly gorgeous. Moreso than you were back then, you’ve grown into your looks like…gods, I can’t stop looking at you.”
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…” Steve sniffed, unaware that he was crying until he felt the tears running down his cheeks. “I didn’t mean to push you away, I was stupid and scared, but that’s no excuse. I fucking love you and I still let you down.”
“It’s a good thing you look so hot in sweat pants. Nice shirt, by the way,” Steve said with a laugh as he cleared the couch off so Bucky could lie down on it for the ultrasound.
“No, I’m glad you were,” said Tony, though he wasn’t entirely truthful about that. He felt like a stupid asshole having let his Kingdom get so far gone. “Pepper, can I ask you something? The executions, what do you have to do to get executed?”
“Can you hold me here?” Bucky whispered as he stared at the fetal monitor, watching the numbers on it, wishing he could see his babies on their screen.
“Uh huh. Steve Rogers, how do you get in and out of that room?” Tony asked, looking around until he spotted a control panel. “Which button?”
When Steve had informed Ms. Carr that he thought it would be best if he stayed close to Bucky, he was surprised how fast she had one of the rooms down the hall renovated for him. He was glad that there didn’t seem to be a problem with his marriage splitting up, and that living on lower level eight appeared to work for everyone involved. He didn’t have a kitchen down here, but the cafeteria was open all hours to provide for all the different shifts, and no one cared if he used the company credit card on take out. He missed the couch outside of Bucky’s room at first, but after a few weeks, he felt completely at home in his new room.
“Not just that…” Bucky’s voice was small and tight, looking at the mirror at Tony’s expression and frowning. “They didn’t say it would just happen…”
“I…” Tony hadn’t thought about that part of the funeral preparations, but he supposed he had to do this. He hated talking about Steve and Bucky like this, even knowing that they were okay. “I haven’t paid attention to the last funerals I was at, I’ll be honest with you. What should I say?”
“I think so…” Steve whimpered, his cock twitching inside Bucky as he felt Tony’s fingers hit that spot inside him that Bucky had told him about. Letting out a sharp cry, he gripped Bucky’s hips harder, his fingers turning his skin red. “Have you done this before? Sex with two people?”
“…your majesty…” Steve began with a shaking voice, not sure if he was in any position to approach the King. “I have a mother, but that’s not who I want to talk to you about.”
Tony set down his mug with a shaking hand, staring back at his father with wide eyes and a dropped jaw. He felt like someone had dumped ice water down his back, his stomach settling in a knot.
“I want to go home,” Bucky whimpered, holding his stomach and breathing slowly. He’d only been to town once since they moved to Dawson City, and he’d hid in the car the whole time. “I just want to be with you two, I don’t want to do this with anyone else. I just want to go home with you.”
“Are you sure?” Tony asked, not surprised when Bucky nodded, but his eyebrows raised when Steve agreed as well. “I’m not going to argue getting in bed with two hot guys.” He regretted it as soon as he said it, his smart mouth getting ahead of him like always. Opening his mouth to apologize, he was surprised when Bucky began to laugh.
“He’s not a joke. His name is James, but he likes to go by Bucky, he’s turning eighteen tomorrow,” Howard said, walking over to Tony, putting his hand on his shoulder. “You’re going to love him.”
“They still make me want to be a better version of myself, they make me want to be a better King,” Tony continued, looking heavenwards for a moment as he sighed. “So I want to announce that, as of now, I am going to be that King. I am going to take over my kingdom, lower taxes, and give back to the people like I should have been doing for years. I will fail the Iron kingdom no more.”
“I have to admit, it would be nice to have real paints and brushes,” Steve agreed, letting out a long, slow breath as he looked up at the green lantern hanging from the post beside him. “I’d like even more for you to not have to work.”
“You be the King you want to be now, you start today,” Pepper set down her notebook on the floor, taking both of his hands in hers. “I’ll help you with anything, okay? We can figure out what’s been going on and fix the economy of the Kingdom.”
“Then why don’t we just drop the prices on our iron in exchange for you making us some of this steel. At a reasonable rate, of course,” Tony suggested, hoping they could at least get enough to outfit his more elite army. He wasn’t thrilled with the prospect of going into business with Latveria, but if it meant saving lives in the long run, he’d have to do it.
“We’ll manage,” Steve said as he followed Tony into the house, immediately impressed with his surroundings when he stepped inside. Everything was relatively modern and clean, much different from the rustic cabin that Steve had pictured, and partially been dreading as he was the only one that could cook. “Wow, this place is nice.”
“Uh huh…” nodded Tony, though his mind was quickly drifting off of the topic and back to the project he’d been working on. “Say, why don’t we revisit this in the morning? I have some things to do, I can think about what you had to say, and we can figure it out from there. Sound good?”
“…because I’m alone…” Bucky whispered weakly, his eyes meeting Steve’s again as they silently pleaded to him for help, his arms shaking as he held himself. “…I’m scared…”
“What if you shut them?” Bucky asked, pulling his blanket over so he could pull it around his shoulders.
“So is this, this is important to me,” Tony pointed to his work with the end of the tool before tossing it up again. “Making something the world hasn’t seen before, that’s what’s important to me.  I want to be the king that ushers in the next great age, not the one that did the same old shit until I died.”
“No one can blame you for that, Sire,” Pepper frowned, rubbing Tony’s shoulder lightly, not sure how else to show him that she was there for him. She was going to have to be direct. “Sire, if I can do anything, and I mean anything, I don’t mind putting in extra time if it means doing something to make you happy. I feel terrible for your loss, I want to help.”
“Yes, how rude of me, shall we go have a drink?” Tony got to his feet, gesturing towards a door behind his throne. Walking with Von Doom, he beckoned for his Uncle to follow as the door was held open for them by his guards. “You drink, right?”
“It’s still a good idea, there was just a little mistake, not a big deal,” Tony said as he walked over to Pepper, putting a hand on her shoulder until he felt her relax a bit. “Take your time, I’m sure we can find something to talk about. You, what’s your name?”
“Thank you,” Bucky nodded, just glad that their family members were okay, though he knew he’d feel better when he saw them for himself.
As Bucky looked up, his bright blue teary eyes meeting with Tony’s dark ones as they met each for the first time. Tony couldn’t ignore the feeling of his heart aching in his chest looking at the beautiful young man, guilt aching in his chest at the thought that he’d had to give up his entire life just to be a solution to a problem that Tony didn’t even care about.
“Fine, you don’t get any,” Tony said stubbornly, pushing the wheelbarrow further into the woods, pretending to be angry as he tried not to burst out laughing. It didn’t last long, though, the second he looked back at his husband, he lost his last bit of control, the sound of their combined laughter echoing in the empty woods.
“Then I can do a display in the sky that won’t rain down and burn everything,” Strange refilled their teas as he picked his cup up again. “Is that satisfactory? I’ll make it look like the stars are coming to life to dance through the sky.”
“I definitely need something to eat, I’m starving,” Walking over to Bucky, Steve began to undo the ties on his clothes, working the man out of his fancy clothes. “There you go, how’s that?”
“Do you want us to take a picture of you with them?” Tony offered, reaching into his pocket for his phone and turning the camera on.
“I’ll meet him one day, Steve, and I’ll tell him how much you love him, right in front of you too so you get embarrassed,” Sam said, reaching over to the table beside them to steal one of the napkins, setting it down by Steve’s utensils. He knew he should probably think about this more, but he knew a good gut feeling when he had one, and he knew deep in his heart that Steve would do the same for him. “As of now, you two aren’t alone in this. If you need someone to help break him out and fly you two to safety, I will.”
“No one remembers nice unless you have a grand gesture to prove it,” Tony pointed out, crossing his arms over his chest. “This is my grand gesture, so if my other great works don’t reach fruition, at least I’ll have this.”
Bucky looked into Steve’s eyes to see if he was serious, cautiously extending his hand until Steve took it, helping him from the back of the car carefully. Giving Bucky a kiss on the forehead, Steve scooped him up into his arms with a grunt, trying not to act like Bucky was heavy, that was the last thing he needed. Nodding at Tony, Steve began to walk, heading for the main road with Tony close behind him in the SUV.
“Good, I love flukes. There’s something satisfying about them,” grinned Tony, giving Pepper a wink as she shook her head again. “This is going to go down in history. No one’s going to want to forget it.”
“His son had an accident and needs care in the city, so he can’t come up here with him,” Tony said, taking a deep breath and picking up the bags again, heading up the stairs. He’d packed the bags until bursting, everything from clothes to toiletries to electronics, he wanted to make sure they weren’t going to be bored when they were there. “If it makes you feel better, I gave him more than what he was asking, figured it might help with his kid.”
“Would it sweeten things if we tripled your salary and bought you a Corvette?” Ms. Carr asked as she leaned forward.
“You’re going to get it…you’re going to get it, Buck…” Steve’s voice was getting louder and more desperate, the sound of skin slapping filling the air alone with his cries. The bed was creaking louder and louder between the three of them, the sheets torn from the bed as Bucky clawed at the mattress. Steve didn’t know how much he could take, he hadn’t done this in years, and this was so much more intense than he was used to.
“Steve, we won! You won! Oh my god!” Sarah gushed excitedly, bursting into happy tears as she held up the ticket, waving it excitedly as her son stared forward in shocked silence. “Steve, come on, get up there!”
“Isn’t it? You didn’t try to kill the men I love twice?” Tony demanded, stepping away from the pulpit and closer to his guilty Uncle. “You didn’t steal from this kingdom? You didn’t tell me for years that taxes were low and prosperity was high? And meanwhile, the only one prospering was YOU! You selfish, petty, small man…” Tony took a deep breath, shaking his head. “You have no place in my life any more. I have half a mind to just let Von Doom there take you back to Latveria with him. Just half a mind, though.”
“That’s very touching, Tony,” Pepper smiled at him sadly, not surprised when he couldn’t return the expression. “What about Bucky? He was so quiet talking to me, I feel like I barely knew him.”
“And I love you with all my heart,” Steve gave Bucky a squeeze, glad that they were nearing the road finally. He’d definitely got his workout for the day, he’d have to carry Bucky around more, though hopefully not with an extra sixty pounds on him. “How are you doing, baby? You holding in for me?”
“Is the mysterious answer to this riddle trans men? I am aware of the existence of men with uteruses,” Tony took a sip of coffee, a strange feeling of dread coming over him looking at Howard’s expression. He was pleased with himself about something. “Look, Dad, I’m not looking to get set up with anyone. I’m sure he’s very nice, but I’m not into dating right now, and that really wouldn’t be fair to him. It’s nice he volunteered but…”
“We have to go after him,” Tony said, about to get up when Steve reached out and took his arm. “You’re not suggesting we leave him alone, are you?”
When Bucky’s eyes began to open, he didn’t know where he was for a moment, feeling like he was lost in a dream still. He felt like he was drifting, like he was in a gigantic warm bath, feeling supported but weightless at the same time. Blinking, he looked up at the ceiling, a flash of panic hitting him when he realized he didn’t know where he was,  which only grew when he realized he couldn’t feel his body.  Weakly, he moved to push himself up off the bed, jumping a little when he felt a hand close on his wrist.
“Are you joking?” Pepper said as Tony came waltzing in, thankfully enjoying a closer relationship with the King that allowed her to be casual with him. “Sire, this is insane, how am I supposed to do this in a month much less a week!”
“You do?” Bucky clamped his mouth shut the moment he realized he’d just spoken to Steve, though he too was nervous about sitting on the couch in his goat herding clothes.
“Isn’t this nice? I figured we might as well get something we can use even if we’re not running away. I thought Bucky might like it up here,” Tony said as he got out of the car, walking over to the front garden to pick up a rock and retrieve the key from underneath. “Bucky, go ahead in, the lights should work.” Opening the door, he pocketed the key and walked back over to the car as his youngest boyfriend headed inside.
“Everything with you is serious,” Tony didn’t budge in the least except to sink in his chair a bit. “Can’t we just ignore tradition? I mean, we got rid of killing a servant during the Night Sky Festival, surely we can get rid of this.”
“I’m sure that was true at one point, but they’ve camouflaged themselves too well, and there’s no telling them apart now,” Tony picked up his cup, getting to his feet as he took a drink. “I’m doing this, Uncle, and you’re not talking me out of it.  You might as well help with the process.”
“But…” Bucky began, looking hesitant for a moment as his eyes turned back to the skies, the first few stars of the evening beginning to appear. “…will you still hold me like that when they’re born?”
“I don’t know…” Pepper began to open books frantically, trying to ignore Tony pacing behind her. The last thing she wanted to do was let him down. “I will get to the bottom of this, I promise you, just give me some time.”
“I still hope I don’t suck,” Bucky replied, blushing as he tried to calm himself down, wondering how Steve felt about all this. He supposed they would find out as soon as they found him. “Do you really think Steve will be into this?”
“It doesn’t seem like enough,” Tony said quietly, turning his body a bit so he could face Steve instead of stare out the window. “Nothing seems like enough, I just look at him and I want to give him fucking everything.”
“Mhm?” Tony looked up from his throne, sitting upon it with red rimmed eyes. He’d been there for hours, since he’d announced the deaths of his fiancés, doing his best to act like he was in mourning. So far it had to have been working since everyone was avoiding him unless they were giving him empty platitudes about the men he loved being at the feast of the gods now. Hopefully Pepper would have more to say.
“Good morning, Bucky, and…Natasha, right?” Pepper asked, smiling when the other woman nodded. “How is your meal? Is everything to your liking?”
“Package deal, huh?” Steve asked with a laugh, slipping the ring onto Tony’s fingers, grinning at him from ear to ear. “So you’re a thrifty relationship man, are you?”
“The goats, mostly. Only the goats,” Bucky corrected himself, hoping that the burning in his cheeks was from the alcohol and not him turning a shade of red to match Tony’s chair. “I don’t think anyone else wants to listen to that.”
“Family will be housed in the Upper East wing, but I want their quarters closer to mine,” Tony said without hesitation, he’d already been thinking about that. He didn’t mind if whomever won brought their family, he wanted them to be happy here.
Bucky just nodded, not sure what to think of that reaction, but afraid that if he tried to talk, his voice would just crack.
“I’m here now. I know it’s too late, but I’m here now, I promise you,” Steve pledged to Bucky, fingers gripping the black material of his clothes. “I’m not going anywhere, I’m not-“
“Natasha Romanov…” Bucky wondered once again about Namor. He hadn’t even come to the town square today, he didn’t know how he was going to reach him to tell him to go to the castle.
“Bucky? Buck?” Steve called out, walking down the hall, poking his head in each room to call out his boyfriend’s name. He hadn’t seen him since breakfast, where he’d barely eaten anything, and since then neither Steve, Tony, nor any of the staff had seen him, and he wasn’t answering his texts. “Jesus, Bucky…”
“I think it’s odd how little we know about life here, yet they’ve dressed us up and stuck us here with pretty much no instruction,” Bucky frowned, going over to the chair next to Natasha’s to take a seat himself. “I’m starting to wonder if we’re not here for some weird game for all the rich people’s amusement. Ohh look at the poor people, they don’t know how to eat, let’s laugh at them.”
“Sorry. Sorry. Okay,” Tony tried to take another deep breath, mentally willing his heart to slow as he took another long drink of whiskey. “I have to be completely and totally honest. I didn’t think this would happen, I didn’t think when I did this lottery that I’d actually fall for someone, much less…I just didn’t think this was going to happen. I thought I’d have a friendly marriage, I thought it would be nice and easy, but this isn’t easy at all. This is the complete fucking opposite of that. This is-“
“Of course,” Bucky nodded, figuring he wouldn’t mind performing it in the future now that his initial jitters were gone.
“Good morning to you too,” she said, turning the coffee maker on before sitting at the small island with her make up bag and a mirror. “I’m using that Kenyan blend you like, maybe you should bring a coffee with you to the office. Though I’m sure they have coffee there too.”
“I asked Pepper if he could be my personal bodyguard,” explained Steve, hoping that asking Tony directly would speed up the process. “His name is Sam Wilson, he’s been a soldier since he was sixteen, and I don’t think there are many better than him.”
“Am I the only one to come down here and spend time with him now though? I haven’t seen anyone else around here, why is he alone now?” Steve’s heart ached for Bucky, just wanting to go in the room and give him a hug. This wasn’t the way for anyone to live.
“Clint Barton,” Clint sheathed his sword and pulled his mask back, reaching a hand out to shake Bucky’s. “No hard feelings, I didn’t know you were one of Natasha’s friends. I owe her my life, I wouldn’t do anything to hurt someone close to her.”
“You don’t know the Asgardians. They’re a rough bunch, the Princess fights as much as the Princes do, and drinks the same,” Tony realized he was going to have to coach them both a lot about the other Kingdoms. “But she still didn’t appreciate me doing it. I thought she was going to knock my teeth out.”
“I’ll be fine,” Bucky said as he walked awkwardly away, trying his best not to waddle as he headed up the stairs, hanging tightly to the railing.
“Just...just hold me, okay?” Bucky said softly, scared and feeling utterly helpless as he buried his face against Steve’s neck. Closing his eyes, he wanted to shut out everything in this world except for the two men he loved with all his heart.
“Wine, now,” Stane said flatly to the servant behind him, who immediately rushed to fetch it. Turning back to Tony, he gave his nephew an annoyed look. “You can’t marry a stranger after a month.”
“I don’t care, it’s not happening any more,” Tony shook his head again, emphatic in his newfound cause. “We are going to be gentler and more humane people, better people.”
“I don’t want you to think I don’t really like you, I do,” Bucky whispered, hugging onto Tony and closing his eyes. “Tony, I get it if you question me, but I’m begging you to just give me a chance and I’ll prove to you that I like the man that saved me, not the person whose picture hung on my wall. I want to know everything about you, I want to know how to make you happy.”
“Don’t even think of losing, Steve, you have to stay positive,” Sarah reminded him, watching as Jarvis skillfully snipped through the thick blond hair, scattering it around Steve’s feet in a ring. “Steve, you look so much older. So distinguished. You look…” Tearing up, Sarah wiped her eyes with one of the napkins, her heart swelling with pride.
“Of course,” Jarvis said to her, not pausing as he worked on Bucky, the pile of brown hair growing on the floor. “That would be a beautiful look for you, my lady, I’d be happy to.”
“They’re alive, they’re in hiding in Bucky’s old home, no one knows so I can keep them safe,” Tony whispered even though they were alone in the room, and the heavy doors were soundproof. “The attempt on their life was real, but Natasha knew the assassin and he agreed to help us get them out and hide them. The funeral is just a front for the wedding.”
“Sorry I’m late, sorry,” Steve said as he stepped inside Bucky’s room, having left his helmet and jacket on the desk in the other room. He didn’t have set hours when it came to Bucky, but he always tried to get there in the morning when his nurse was with him. Having spent the morning with Peggy, he hadn’t had time to grab any treats, though he was planning on ordering Bucky a calzone from his favourite pizza place if the was up for it later. “Bucky?”
“Trust in Natasha, she’s really smart, okay? She’s really tough too,” Bucky said as he looked into Tony’s eyes, smiling weakly. “If she says she can do it, she can.”
“So can I call you Bucky again?” Steve asked, laughing breathlessly as he pressed their foreheads together. “Can I tell you I love you again?”
“Oh, shit!” Steve cursed, putting the scoop back into the container to start cleaning up the spill. “Sorry, sorry…morning, Peg.”
“You do, Bucky, you already do,” Tony said, slipping inside him with a low moan, biting his lip to silence himself as he slowly began to move his hips. He felt like if he opened his mouth, he wouldn’t be able to stop babbling about how amazing this was, and he wasn’t here to talk Bucky’s head off.
“You’re not going to be, I promise you won’t be broken up,” Tony reassured him, laughing again, though there was some lightness to it. Wiping his eyes, he looked at Steve, feeling desperate at that moment to be a part of their embrace. “M-May I?”
“Don’t worry, we’re no going to the big airport, this is a smaller one, no one’s going to be looking for us here,” Tony said, driving away from the city towards an airport just outside of it. He didn’t want to be anywhere with cameras, he didn’t know who was watching for his father, and he wasn’t going to risk being followed. “There won’t be crowds, you might not even meet with the pilot, you don’t have to worry about that.”
“…it’ll be okay…” Bucky mumbled after a moment, knowing that Natasha would kill him if he blew this chance just because he wanted to punch Steve. “You won’t have any problems with me.”
“I was told to kill Steve Rogers and James Barnes,” Clint said as Tony took the slip of paper off him to look over his code. “I know they’re the King’s fiancés because I was there on the evening of the lottery.”
“I don’t think the royal treasurers would like that much,” Sarah chuckled, joining in on her son’s amusement by all this. She did like that she had something to look forward to besides work and cooking, life was going to be so boring when it was over.
“Do you know how hard it is to care about marrying someone else other than them?” Tony asked him, his voice wavering with false emotion. “I told Pepper I’d just marry her if I had to. I mean, I love her, but…not like Steve and Bucky.”
“O-okay…” Bucky said weakly, turning to half walk, half stumble towards the side of the stage, looking back over his shoulder every few seconds to make sure she was still watching him.
“Something definitely did,” Tony’s lips stretched into a wide smile at the pink tinge on Steve’s cheeks, pretty sure his own matched.
“I’m sure he has his reasons for making us wait,” Natasha said as she looked at the books lining the walls, wondering if anyone ever read them. She felt like she’d never felt before wearing a fashionable black dress with short, curled hair. “Maybe this is just creating drama.”
“…you know, there’s a bar in town that has a drink called the Sourtoe cocktail. It’s a glass with a shot of whiskey and a mummified toe, so if you want to join me and earn a certificate with your name on it, Stevie…” Tony chuckled, trying to lift the mood a bit, though he didn’t blame everyone for being exhausted and cranky after travelling for so long.
Tony, Steve, and Bucky all looked at each other, smiles breaking out on their faces at the priest’s words. As Tony stepped forward, he leaned in to press a short, but tender, kiss to Bucky’s lips before he turned to do the same to Steve. Stepping back, he teared up watching as Steve pulled Bucky into a kiss between them, letting it linger for a little longer before breaking it.
“Sire, we’re ready for you now,” Pepper came into the tent, going right over to Tony to start adjusting his outfit, smoothing some areas and puffing up others. “Were you lying down in this?”
Steve wanted to say he was pleased for Bucky, that he didn’t want anything to happen to his friend either. He didn’t think Bucky wanted to hear from him, though,  and he couldn’t blame him. Steve really had abandoned Bucky when he needed him most, no wonder he hated him. He should have gone to look after Bucky, he should have taken care of him and made sure he knew his sacrifice wasn’t for nothing. Steve was strong and healthy, and it was only because Bucky’d lost his arm for him.
As the two of them laughed together again, Steve knew that he’d made the right decision, and not just because it was going to make Peggy happier, but she’d be safer the further away from him she could get. Pouring them each a coffee, they shared the morning together, going over good memories and bad, realizing how much they’d needed each other for so long. Steve knew that there was never going to be another Peggy in his life, and for that he was grateful, because he didn’t think he could handle two. As sweetly and playful as their relationship began, it changed over Kenyan blend from a fairytale marriage into a rock solid friendship.
“I have the movies…” Bucky said, still looking nervous, clutching onto himself so tightly that his knuckles were white.
“I wrote it all down and gave it to Pepper,” Tony pulled the bowl over, wanting more grapes. “I want this executed immediately. I want the people to get their numbers starting today so we can make the draw soon. I don’t want to wait.”
“Okay, I’ll be doing that, I-uhm, I guess if you direct me?” Tony suggested, not sure how else they were going to do it. He was pretty sure he could find the baby, but he didn’t know what to do once he had.
Reaching for Bucky, Natasha positioned him at her side and took his arm as Sarah did the same with Steve, staring forward as the doors opened before them. On the other side was what looked like a years worth of food, piled high on various matching table, and dancers performing in the middle of the three tables running along the walls. It smelled wonderful, the scent of spiced and roast meat permeating the air around them, making their mouths water. The King was already seated, as were lots of other men and women who were talking softly between themselves, but it was evident that everyone was waiting for them.
“I know you would have, you’re a sweetheart,” Steve smiled weakly, looking down at Bucky as he kept him close, hoping it was making him feel as loved as he was. Relaxing, he looked down at his phone in his free hand, his thumb hovering over it for a second before he typed in ‘early pregnancy symptoms’, looking them over to see what was and wasn’t normal so he knew what to watch Bucky for, for now anyway. He was so wrapped up reading an article that he hadn’t seen Tony approach, the knock on the window nearly scaring the life out of him.
“I have no idea, but his father married a commoner, so it may be a family thing,” Sarah looked out the window at a couple hurrying past as the rain fell harder. “Though he met her out hunting when she was looking for mushrooms, that’s a much more conventional way to meet than the lottery.”
“You’re at twenty six weeks, you’re going to get bigger,” Steve said as he gave him a hand getting to his feet. “Don’t take a long shower, don’t tire yourself out.”
“I don’t know if they can do that,” Natasha interjected, pointing at her friend. “And you look fine, Bucky, you’re not a bad looking guy.”
“Hey, if it’s your arm, I don’t think it’s cheating. It’s not like you’re bringing in a ringer or something,” Steve said, wanting to ask about it, but not feeling like it was his place to get too personal at this point.
“Steve, I’m getting close…” Bucky had gasped, his metal hand gripping a handful of bedding and twisting it into a ball as Steve pounded into him. He could feel it building every time Steve’s cock hit that good spot deep within him, and it was getting harder to breathe each time. Looking up at him, Bucky’s half lidded eyes met with Steve’s as he felt his orgasm building inside him, swelling and hitting him hard before he had a chance to warn his lover. Squirting out onto his bare, flat stomach, Bucky let out a desperate cry, not even thinking of how loud he was, unable to think of anything more than Steve in that moment.
“…I have no idea, to be honest, sire,” Bucky said in a whisper after a few seconds of being put on the spot. “I don’t have a family, just me and some friends live together, and…I do my best. I didn’t even buy the ticket, my friend did. I just-”
“Put the card in the scanner again, as you put your thumb on the pad and look into the scanner. Then ask to go to the eighth lower level,” Ms. Carr said, watching Steve with a polite smile on her face, and Howard Stark’s voice in her ear. So far he was pleased.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispered, watching as Bucky’s gaze seemed to drift off, knowing that the pain of their death weighed heavy on him. “How old were you?”
“Isn’t it? Open concept, new fixtures, new furniture, the guy that built this place was ready to spend his retirement in style,” Tony said, putting the bags down with a sigh, looking up at the balcony where he could hear Bucky moving around. “That’s supposed to be all one big bedroom up there. How’s it look, Bucky?”
“I will never hurt him…” Tony said softly, making eye contact with Steve as he kept his arm around Bucky. “You have my word.”
Sitting at Bucky’s side, holding his hand, Steve stared over at the machines on his other side, one monitoring his husband, and the other his children. He’d been there alone for hours, and he had no idea what he was supposed to tell the doctors and nurses about who Bucky was or what had happened. He did his best, and now James Stark-Rogers was checked into a hospital in Whitehorse, Yukon after a scary helicopter ride, one Steve had to do without Tony, who was in police custody back in Dawson City. Bucky was immediately given blood and brought into surgery, adding another scar near his metal arm. The doctor told Steve that they’d saved Bucky, but that they needed to keep their eyes on the twins, leaving him in tears by his husband’s side.
“We’re going to miss you too,” Bucky echoed, leaning closer to Steve, glad that he’d at least have him. “But we’ll be married soon. We’ll be your husbands in less than a week.”
“I’m not liking this, that’s for sure,” Bucky said, furrowing his brow and setting his half piece of bread down.
“Never mind,” Bucky grumbled, sitting on the edge of his bed and shaking his head as he looked over at the intruder. “What do we do with him then? I mean, he did try to kill me. Tony’s not going to be happy about that at all.”
“I think you’re right, I think this is the best place for him, even if we have to pay for our own doctor to live nearby,” Steve frowned a little, looking at Bucky’s face as he flinched a bit. “I think he’s dreaming…”
“It’s funny you say that,” Howard said, leaning against the couch as Bucky was forced down onto it by Howard’s guard, watching as the doctor unpacked his portable ultrasound to get the sample without stabbing a fetus. “I read an article the other day saying that CEOs of big corporations have psychopathic tendencies, and I went through all of the other large company owners that I know, and I could see it. In them, not in myself, but you’re never really the best judge of your own character, are you?”
Bucky looked up at Tony again, swirling his tongue around him, sucking hungrily as he tried his best to push the man close to the edge, though not quite over it. He wanted tonight to last longer than that. Having Steve fucking him again just made him want more, it awoke the thirst inside him he’d ignored for so long. He didn’t know how he lasted years without having another man touch him, but now he knew he was quickly going to get used to having two. Squeezing down around Steve, he pushed back so he was flush against him, needing to feel him buried deep.
“Not a problem, you’re having a baby, yell away,” Tony said as he picked up the bag, heading to the SUV with both in hand, wanting to get going as soon as possible. “Got him, Steve?”
“What is it?” Sam asked, picking it up and putting it in his own pocket before leaning forward again.
“So they’ve threatened you if you say anything, I assume?” Sam asked, keeping his voice low. “How closely are you being watched?”
“Are we doing this in the great hall or in town?” Strange needed a bit more clarification before he could make any promises.
When Steve heard the knock on the door to the suite he shared with his mother, he gave her a nervous look and slowly got to his feet. Smoothing out the wrinkles from his clothes, he ran his hands over his hair, taking a few deep breaths before sliding his fingers around the knob. He could do this, there was nothing to be nervous about, he just had his entire life hanging in the balance.
“There’s probably a better tool for that. What else is downstairs?” Steve immediately headed for the basement, hoping to find something more effective than the keyhole saw amongst the old tools that had been sold with the house.
“Go ahead, Peter was going to soak Penny, but he knows we’re watching him now,” Steve said, pulling out a bottle of water, figuring he would stay off the beer until they got home from town later. “Are you good to watch the kids when I run Bucky into town? We can take the twins.”
“It’s a big choice,” Steve acknowledged, but he too was running out of patience. “But I think you’d feel better if you just told us, Tony. Keeping it in is just driving all three of us insane.”
“Do my people think so?” Tony leaned back, looking up at her with a serious look on his face. “What do my people call me? What do they think of me as a King? I doubt I’m anything like Roger the Wise, my father was practically perfect for this job.”
“There aren’t actual words for what I did, I’m sorry, that’s as good as I can come up with,” Steve frowned, his shoulders sagging. “I had you, we had each other, it was fucking perfect and I destroyed everything. You lost your arm because of me.”
“Seriously…a boy and a girl…” Bucky said, hugging his stomach, looking like he was in shock. They suddenly felt so much more real to him, and the fact that they were only a couple months away made him terrified as well as elated. “We need to come up with names, so…everyone start thinking about that.”
Tony didn’t respond for a moment, too busy mentally high fiving himself to think about speaking a full sentence with actual English words. He felt like he’d hit the lottery with Steve and Bucky in his life already, and all he could think was that he didn’t want to screw this up somehow. Bucky was an absolute treasure, and Steve was one of the nicest guys he’d met in a long time, he was looking forward to every moment he was going to spend with them. Especially the naked ones.
“He’s right, it’s a private plane, it’ll just be the three of us, baby,” Tony said, rubbing his brow with one hand, feeling like he was going to be sick. He hoped there was a fully stocked bar on this thing, he needed to get very drunk, very fast, though he doubted he was going to have a chance to do that. He had to stay strong, as hard as that was right now.
“I will thank her, then,” Tony nodded, wondering just how personal they should be getting right now. She knew Pepper wanted him to keep it light and friendly, but this felt a lot more important. “What happened to your family? Can I ask that?”
“And do the goats like it?” Tony asked next, genuinely interested in Bucky’s hobby of goat serenading. He didn’t know much about animals, but he was always happy to hear stories about them.
“Bucky, baby, you have to listen to me,” Tony said as he leaned over the couch, looking down at him for a moment before kissing his forehead softly. “Steve and I are right here, we’re not going to let go of you, and we’re not going to let go of our babies and…just come back to me, okay? Open your eyes and tell me that I’m fussing on you too much, Bucky, please…”
“O-oh, alright,” Steve said, holding his pass in his hand, pausing before he scanned it. “…is getting into the building at the door I’m supposed to use going to have security at this level?”
“If that’s what you’d like, sire,” said Pepper as she clutched her notebook a bit tighter, hoping that was the end of Tony’s odd requests. She was worried enough about him without adding his mental health to her list. Though she was still going to go forward with her plan to spend time with him, hoping nothing else would pop up.
“I haven’t heard word of a tax increase, but you’re right, it’s possible,” Sarah mused, worried that they wouldn’t be able to handle another one. Things had been tight enough since her husband died, and even Steve’s wages didn’t cover enough. She had to hope that it wasn’t the case, she didn’t want to think of them ending up on the streets.
“You have our word,” Tony said from the front seat, swallowing hard as he knew how hard it was going to be to get through the rest of the day without losing his mind. He wasn’t going to be the one to shatter the very delicate shell Bucky was trying to put around himself. “We’re almost at the airport. I’m going to go deal with everything, you two stay in the car where no one can see you.”
“I’m not alone, there are a lot of good men in that profession,” Steve felt like he should stick up for at least some of his coworkers, or former coworkers if this went well. “Like Sam, he’s a great friend and one of the nicest people out there.”
“That’s fair…” Steve said, hugging Bucky tight, noticing how erratic his breathing was getting. “Bucky, I’m sorry you’re going through this, we hadn’t even talked about you going on a plane yet. How are you holding up?”
“As ready as I’m going to get,” Tony gave Pepper a weak smile, handing her the glass as he took a deep breath in. “Wish me luck.”
“Where do you want to go first off?” Tony asked him, waiting patiently as Bucky looked horribly nervous. “I mean, I can pick a spot, we can go up to the roof if you want, or we can go in the gardens, or-“
“Hang on…” Bucky was pretty sure he was caught, pulling the blanket off his head, looking up at Steve with his hair stuck in all directions. “I don’t want…I don’t want to talk.”
“Nice to meet you, Steven, and…James or Bucky,” Tony could tell the second man was bothered by something, but he didn’t want to pry. Maybe he was just shy. “What is it you do?”
“You literally pulled me off the couch at a party and announced that I was yours now,” Steve chucked, rubbing her back as his mind went back to the first night they’d hooked up. “You were scary and I loved it.”
“Yes, they’re in, and I’m fine,” Bucky replied, not looking back at them as he stared into the fire, holding his right hand up towards the flames to warm it. There was a twinge of cold in his left arm, the ghost of nerves that no longer existed, but there was no warming what wasn’t there. He just had to hope that a decent night’s sleep took care of the sensation.
“What do you mean? Do we share spells or something?” Strange raised an eyebrow, not entirely sure what Tony was getting at.
“Got him,” Steve said, leading Bucky outside, much to Laika’s disappointment, and locking the door. “Come on, Bucky. Do you want me to carry you?”
“My people…” Tony began as the clamor began to die down, feeling a bit better that things were going well so far. “Welcome, all of you, to the first of many nights of festivities. Tonight has gone so well, I don’t see why we can’t do this more often.”
“Stane, you better have good news for me,” the man said gruffly, staring intensely up at Stane. “I’m sick of you telling me every day that you don’t know what’s going on.”
“I think it’s beautiful, it’s so…” Steve was at a loss for words, not sure what he should say. He still didn’t know exactly what Tony had in mind, but he was sure he could guess. “Who works in here?”
“And did you even almost get caught?” Tony was seething now, wanting to hunt down Nick Fury and tell him off for his lax security teams. He wanted his fiancés safe, this obviously wasn’t safe, and he wasn’t happy.
“I do, I know forty four different types of solitaire,” Bucky said, reaching into his bedside table, taking out a pair of Stark Industries branded playing cards, and holding them out to Steve. “I know a few types of poker, crazy eights, blackjack…lots of others. I have some poker chips too.”
“Did you see Sam? I was glad he didn’t have to work, it was funny seeing him get that drunk,” Steve laughed, sitting on the edge of the bed, though he wondered if he was being too bold taking a seat there. “I didn’t even know he could dance like that, especially on a table. Natasha sure got a laugh over it.”
“Are my mom and Natasha okay?” Steve couldn’t help inquiring about them, especially considering what happened to Namor.
“The client is here on the premises, you’ll be dealing with them face to face,” Ms. Carr said, knowing that this was where it was going to be harder to keep Steve. “Your client is a young man, he’ll be eighteen in a few weeks, his name is James Barnes, and he lives here where we can monitor him. He’s very special, and we want him to be happy and comfortable, so we have a member of staff take care of his more social and emotional needs.”“O-ooh…” Steve blinked, a little surprised that they picked him to babysit a teenager. He used to babysit the boys next door growing up, but he had a feeling this was going to be very different. There had to be a catch to this, it all sounded too good to be true. “Where will I be doing this?”
“It depends who you commit the crime against,” Pepper sighed, not really liking the system, and liking that Tony was asking her about it even less. “Tony, please, you need to rest.”
“He’s been here since he was four, his family died in a car accident, and he was dying as well. We were able to bring him here and save him, and he’s been here since,” Ms. Carr said, trying to still seem pleasant as Howard Stark told her to keep him there no matter what. Lying outright wasn’t going to work because Bucky could correct him later. They couldn’t be made to seem like they were lying on top of everything else. “It was different before, he had a nanny, he had more nurses, a tutor, and every toy he could ever want.”
“Fury,” Tony said with a nod towards his uncle, smiling as Nick Fury stepped forward himself with two guards at his side. “Arrest this man for plotting against the crown, attempted murder, theft, and anything else you can possibly throw at him so he spends the rest of his life in a jail cell. You’re lucky I got rid of the death penalty, Uncle, or maybe you’re not. A life inside is going to be a lot more boring than death.”
“Yes,” Tony said, taking the turn towards the parking lot, hoping that Bucky believed everything Steve had to say, he couldn’t bring himself to talk about that right now. “Like I said, I’m going to park and find this pilot. You two are going to stay here, and I don’t care who comes to the door, if it’s not me by myself, don’t open it. I’m leaving the keys with you.”
“You can find a better way, Steve, you can…what are you looking at?” Sarah asked, following Steve’s eyes over to the pub, spotting Sam. She hadn’t wanted to push things, but she was beginning to think there was a bit of a spark there. After years alone, she’d hoped Steve had found someone new to fill that hole in his heart.
“Natasha, seriously, look at me,” Bucky said, standing up straight and taking a drink of beer, doing a slow turn around. “If I win, they’re just going to pick another number.”
“You just plan on marrying and murdering my nephew,” Stane couldn’t help but laugh at that, having waited for his nephew to die and finally be out of his way forever. He’d wanted to do it before now, but it was easier to just let Von Doom do the work rather than deal with the legalities of an empty throne with no heir.
“Yes, alright, I’ll do that right now,” Pepper smiled weakly, looking at Tony as she could still see sadness in his expression. “When did you want me to take him to his room?”
“As long as it’s over, I’m happy,” Bucky took off the chain from around his neck as they  walked into their sitting room, setting it down on a table. “I say we spend the rest of the night in here. Just ask for some food and drink to be brought up.”
“Thank you,” Bucky said, getting into the car and pushing his bucket down on the floor as Steve got in from the other side. Lying down on the seat, he rested his head in Steve’s lap as Tony began to drive again.
“You are doing good, my son,” Sarah said as she reached out to tousle his messy blond hair. “Bar fights can get bigger and very dangerous, you’re saving lives by ending them before they end in murder. And, as sure as I am that cats can get down on their own, you saved its owner from worry.”
“Stane…” Von Doom’s tone was low and dangerous, his teeth grinding together as he clenched his jaw tighter.
“Steve’s right, let’s think about that later and celebrate now. I’ll go into town later, get pizza and drinks, and we’ll let Bucky pick the movie,” Tony said, sitting down and putting Bucky’s legs in his lap. “For now, you have both of us, Bucky, what would you like to do?”
“I’m fine, just…getting settled with this new position is more stressful than I thought it would be,” Steve said, letting her take his temperature as he turned the blender on, guilt mixing in as she pressed her hand against him. She was always the most loving wife, and it wasn’t that he didn’t love her, he just didn’t know how well they fit together any more. He didn’t want to upset her, though.
“I know, it’s j-“ Bucky began when the baby monitor went off beside him. Looking over at the screen, he saw their sixteen month old son trying to get out of his crib, grunting. “Eddie’s trying to escape, you better go get him.”
“Does he know you’re getting someone new for him? Will he know about me?” Steve asked, his hand resting on the box.
Taking a card out of the deck, Bucky flipped it between his metal fingers, his eyes on Steve’s as he flashed him the ace. One. For now.
“You can sing for us,” Steve suggested, smiling a little. “I mean, quietly, but I’d still like to hear you. You never used to sing to me when we were together aside from the dirty songs we learned from here and there.”
“He used me and forgot about me,” Bucky answered, giving Steve another look. “He needed a sacrifice and I was conveniently there.”
“You view things too negatively,” Stane chastised as he finally got his wine, wasting no time drinking it. “There are many good people in those courts.”
“Come in,” Stane said in a cheerful voice, hoping that his guest had finally arrived. As the door opened, he was disappointed to only see one of the men who worked for him. His tone quickly changed. “What do you want? I’m a busy man.”
“Tony, I’m…I don’t even know what to begin to say, I’m sorry you were put into that position, and I’m sorry your father is dead,” Steve said weakly, not about to celebrate Howard’s death, even if it meant that they were free. He wasn’t that cruel.
“Do the other kingdoms know how you’re choosing your spouse?” Bucky asked, wondering if anyone else had ever done something like this before. “Where did you get the idea?”
“Cheers,” Steve repeated, bringing his hand back to take a sip of the amber liquid, the burn hitting him quickly, leaving notes of salted caramel in his mouth. He didn’t think he could go back to drinking the watery ale at the pub after a few more glasses of this.
For the last few minutes in the car ride, everyone was silent as they looked at the beautiful scenery, though the lack of moose was disappointing. It had been such a long day, and nothing was going to get any easier any time soon. Though now that the sun was setting soon, they could at least look forward to crawling into bed and forgetting everything for the time being.
“Tony, he’s alive!” Steve said in a panic as he stood over Bucky, who’d been hit in the shoulder, looking over at the doctor cowering in the corner. “Can you help him?? Please? BUCKY!” Steve panicked as Bucky’s eyes slowly drifted shut, slapping his cheek to try to rouse him with no avail.
“Yes, Tony, of course,” Pepper looked over at Von Doom, who didn’t appear to be drinking his whiskey as fast as Tony was. “Your Majesty, if you’d like to come with me, I’ll bring you to your room so you can rest.”
“Oh probably,” Tony laughed, finishing off his almonds and getting to his feet, holding his arms out to pick Penny up. “You’re going to drive your Daddy crazy if you keep doing that, and people will think we don’t look after you if you’re always covered in dirt.”
“Come here…” Tony led Bucky over to the couch, sitting down with him before he carefully took the younger man’s shirt off, holding it against the wound. “Bucky, you have to take it easy, this is a serious wound, you could have really hurt yourself. Not again, okay? Promise me.”
“Don’t try to get up, Bucky,” Steve said, still wearing scrubs, his voice gentle but firm as Bucky’s heart rate started to raise. “Baby, remember you came to have the twins, do you remember that? You did it.”
“You going to tell me what that was about? How’d you lose weight if your calories are regulated so closely?” Steve asked, taking Bucky’s smoothie over to his nightstand before he sat down himself in his chair. “You had like four slices of pizza for supper last night.”
“What? No, this is nothing, it’s fine,” Tony said, clearing his throat as he wondered if now was the time to alleviate some of his fears about Bucky, needing to know that he wasn’t doing this for the wrong reasons. He couldn’t forgive himself if he brought any kind of harm to Bucky, so as hard as this might be, they needed to talk. “Come on in, there’s nothing here that will break or hurt you. Well, maybe some of that stuff in the corner, but don’t worry about that. Where’s Steve?”
“Shut up, shut up, shut up…” Tony didn’t know what to do, he felt like his heart was being squeezed in his chest. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing, he couldn’t believe what his father was admitting to. “You stole a child, mutilated him, and locked him up…for me? And you didn’t think that I would have a fucking problem with it?”
“But you have made a decision?” Steve felt sick, he really didn’t want to do this. Either way, he was saying goodbye to Bucky, and as much as he really liked Tony, that would hurt way too much.
“I would have given anything for your life before us to be different,” Tony said sadly, hating to hear how Bucky had suffered under his father, though he would never tell him how much it hurt him. He didn’t want Bucky to bottle everything up. “I’m so sorry, Bucky, I’m sorry for everything he did to you, I’ll never be able to apologize enough.”
“Not probable,” Bucky shot back, staring into the fire with a renewed vigor. He wasn’t angry with Natasha, he understood what she did and why she did it, but that didn’t mean he had to be happy about it. She knew he was going to be upset, she knew him too well to think that Bucky would take this lightly. But he could understand her desperation, he faced the same conditions she did, that they were all trapped in. If there was the possibility of ending that, he had to swallow his own emotions and do what needed to be done.
“Why? It’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Tony smiled as their eyes met, having caught Bucky looking at him, and vice versa. “I mean it. You don’t think you have a disadvantage with me because of that, do you?”
“I hope so, I hop-ohhh!” Steve gasped loudly as Tony pushed the head of his cock inside him, his nails digging into Bucky’s flesh as he felt him inching inside him. He was completely trapped between his two husbands, Tony pressed up flush against him behind with his body tight against Bucky. “Oh gods above, I can’t even think…”
“All of that, just…for one client? Can I only call them from here?” Steve said, questioning a lot of what Ms. Carr was saying, but not wanting to sound like he was being too critical of the job opportunity.
“You did not cost me my father, I promise you, and I’m not going to feel differently,” Tony said softly, looking into Bucky’s eyes as he stroked his thumb along his cheekbone. “As for the kids, we can lie or something.  And when they get to be teenagers, then we can tell them the truth about him, unless that steps on the toes of what you want to tell them about yourself.”
Steve’s eyes met Bucky’s again as he felt like he’d swallowed a bowling ball, a sick feeling coming over him when he thought of the word ‘creator’ again. This was why Jack died. This is why he was going to die if he didn’t tread carefully.
“Okay, my turn now,” Tony clapped his hands again, rubbing them together excitedly as he looked straight at Bucky. “I have a bit of a confession to make, though, and Steve already knows this, but my present isn’t for both of you. It’s just for you, Buck.”
“I’ve heard word that stealing from the businesses and homes of the upper class is automatic hanging,” Pepper looked back into Tony’s eyes, frowning. “Hurting them, or murdering one, you lose your head.”
“You’re welcome,” Von Doom bowed his head again before looking up at Tony. “If you ever want more, I’m sure we could come to an understanding, of sorts. What belongs to Latveria is open to the Iron lands.”
“I mean, when he was three years old, we saved him after a car accident killed his family, and we brought him to Stark Industries. We put a synthesized womb inside him, cloned from his sister’s, and we’ve housed him ever since,” Howard said, frowning as Tony leaned on his work station, a hand over his heart. “Tony, what’s wrong?”
“Nothing you do is terrible,” Steve sat down in his armchair, lifting his glass to his lips. “I think we’ve all established that you’re incredibly wonderful and brilliant all the time.”
“Mr. Rogers, we are definitely sure it’s you we want. You’re a good employee, you fit the job, you’ve got a clean record,” Ms. Carr said with a stiff smile, not taking her eyes off him. She wasn’t going to mention that it was also him being married that helped seal the deal. “If you choose not to sign the contract, you can leave now and the matter will be dropped, you can return to your old job. You don’t have to take this new job, but you must sign before I can tell you about it.”
“I don’t think I talk to these people enough, I don’t think they like me,” Tony said weakly, looking at her imploringly. “Pepper…”
“…deal…” Pepper reached forward to shake it, though she didn’t look very happy about it. “I hope you can find someone else.”
“I…I had the Rogerses at least,” Bucky admitted, figuring their past was bound to pop up here and there. He might as well be forthright with it. “Sarah was kind of like a second mom to me. It really hurt me when…when things went bad.”
“So which one’s real?” Tony asked her, holding his hand out to take the books from her to examine them himself.
“I do worry about you. It’s easier to worry about other people. I’ll unpack the whole thing with my father another day, but I don’t have the energy to do it now. I’m dealing with my real family,” Tony said, hoping that Steve got the hint that he was serious about that and that he didn’t want to discuss it. “I knew you’d check him in under James Stark-Rogers, you know, you’re kind of predictable.”
Steve pulled him close, cutting him off with a kiss of his own, deeper than the one Bucky had given him. He’d wanted to do this for a while now, but he’d always felt like Bucky should make the first move. Now that he had, Steve didn’t want to hold back, he wanted to hold Bucky in his arms and love him with everything he had. But that wasn’t the only thing he had on his mind.
“If you don’t mind…” Bucky said as Tony helped him to his feet, and then swept him off them. “I don’t ever want to say no to you when you want to spoil me.”
“Oh let them, they want to get out of the castle too,” Tony was already picturing the procession now, he was going to have to get his best carriage oiled and shined. They had to make some sort of an entrance, though he didn’t want to waste too much money on it. Their best clothes and carriage would have to do.
“Then we’re going to have to get this done in a month,” Von Doom was blunt, but he didn’t feel like wasting his time with niceties. “We’ve left this too close, Stane, I don’t like having such a large margin for error.”
“Are you going to tell us?” Bucky’s voice was barely above a whisper as he leaned forward. Everything in him was telling him to grab onto Steve, but he couldn’t force himself to move.
“I like to make clockwork creations,” Tony replied, a bit surprised at Bucky’s boldness, but appreciating it all the same. “I can make little…uhm, I’d suppose you’d call them toys. They move on their own, I’m quite proud of them, but I’m often told it’s not what Kings should be up to. What about you two, what do you do for fun?”
“Good luck, but you don’t need it,” Pepper smiled back at him, hoping to instill some confidence in him, but as he walked past her, it didn’t look like it worked. “Good luck, sir.”
“Yeah,” Bucky added, looking down at the clenched fist at his side, specifically his twitching thumb. He didn’t know how much more of this drinking and procrastinating he could take.
“Okay, you two…” Steve appreciated the laughter, it cut the tension of the room, and felt like their first real steps to being friends. “At least it’s a big bed, we won’t be cramped or anything, lots of blankets for everyone. Oh, and neither of us snore, you don’t have to worry about that.”
“NO! No, they’re mine, we know they’re mine, Steve wasn’t with him then…” Tony fumbled through his lie, desperate to keep Bucky and his children alive, trembling all over as he kept begging this to be a nightmare. “How did you find us?”
“I’d say hopefully they’ll be too drunk to care, but there are a lot of violent drinkers out there,” Steve turned around, looking through the crowd for one particular face, though not wanting to find it at the same time. “Whatever happens, just hold on to me and don’t let go.”
“Duly noted,” Steve said with a nod, following Bucky who had walked into his bedroom, hoping that they could have at least some privacy. Stepping into Bucky’s room, he watched as his former friend took a seat on the edge of the bed, purposely avoiding eye contact. “…James.”
“I’m pretty sure Rhodey can look after anyone we pick up,” Tony sipped his coffee, looking thoughtful for a moment. “…and if it goes that badly, I can just pick one of your people. The North guy or something.”
“Like Steve said, every night,” Tony insisted, his own hand joining Steve’s under Bucky’s shirt to lay on his warm skin. “We are going to prove to you every night that we love you more than anything, and I don’t care how many times we have to repeat it to make up for your lifetime alone. We love you, Bucky, and if it takes marrying you in the backyard among the trees to convince you, we’re going to do it.”
“Are you sure we’re safe?” Bucky frowned as they were loaded up into the covered cart, staying close to Steve.
“…what do you mean you made him?” Tony asked, mentally begging for this to be more innocent than it sounded.
“Oh we will. I’m going to get the Wizard Strange to perform magic the likes of nothing they’ve ever seen,” Tony grinned, ideas pouring into his head.
“I have people trying to escape me, it’s not much fun,” Bucky said as he wrapped both arms around his bucket, putting his face inside of it and moaning softly. “I read so many books, I didn’t think it would feel like this, I didn’t think anything could hurt this bad.”
“I…” Pepper dropped her voice, looking around to make sure no one else had slipped in the room. “I’ve heard that people that go to Latveria have a habit of not coming back. And those that go to look for them suffer the same fate. It could just be a story to scare children, Sire, I wouldn’t say that’s the truth.”
“If you know it, it must be true,” pushing the muscles in his cheek to pull back his lips further, Stane didn’t know if he was smiling or wincing. “Go to your work, Your Highness, and I’ll see to your vision with Pepper and your staff.”
“You really think people would care about that with a face like yours?” Steve asked,  reaching over to touch Bucky’s empty shoulder, giving it a squeeze. “That doesn’t make you ugly.”
“Not yet. He’s not talking, I can’t find records, Ms. Carr and everyone you mentioned have disappeared,” Tony shook his head, lacing his fingers together to hold his knee, wishing he had something he could fiddle with. He needed to burn off his nervous energy, and he couldn’t think of a single healthy way to do that right now. “Dad was really thorough, he knew this could happen, and he covered his bases. The only real proof is Bucky himself, and you, so you’re going to be more involved in the investigation than I wanted you to be.”
“And I love you,” Tony said, cupping Bucky’s cheek in his hand, leaning in to press their lips together for a moment. “You didn’t think I loved   you less because of what happened, do you?”
“Namor? No,” Natasha shook her head and laughed grimly. “He’d probably just get us kicked out, so don’t worry about him. He thought this whole plan was stupid anyway, he’d probably just be annoyed with us that it worked.”
“I-thank you,” Steve said, stammering for a moment as his eyes looked over his file. “I just try to bring a good attitude and my best effort  into everything I do.”
to be a woman.  And it had been, eventually.  Peggy—gorgeous, lovely, attractive Peggy.  It wasn’t like there was a second option.  He couldn’t like
Purple, Steve thought as he added another squirt of red to the bluish splotch on his palette, was a hell of a color.
“Is that okay?” he asked quietly.  All of the confusion and struggle of the past several months was packed into those three words.
Tony opened his mouth to fire back, but Steve pushed ahead with his next thought before he could lose his nerve.  “Thought you said you had a date.”
It was only a short while later, in London, that he’d learned that blonde woman had a name: Lorraine.  She was a private in the Army, Colonel Phillips’s secretary, and she was one hell of a kisser.  More than the memory of his teeth scraping her tongue and her hands tugging on his tie, though, Steve vividly recalled Peggy’s anger—the oddly personal hostility in the glare she’d leveled at Lorraine and the disgust in her voice when she’d told him:
Tony some of the things he’d drawn flirted with the boundary between anxiety and anticipation.  “Yeah,” he said before he could think better of it.  “I do.  Maybe if I show you some of those, you could tell me a little about what you’re always doing in your super-secret science lab.”
afraid of that, Steve thought with an amused smirk, watching as Tony and Pepper returned to their good-natured bickering.  He was only joking, of course.  For all that he got on Tony’s case sometimes, both to the man himself and in the privacy of his own head, Steve really did like him.  In the year since the formation of the Avengers, they’d certainly had their differences, but they weren’t as incompatible as they often seemed.  Tony was brilliant, Steve knew; and even though his sense of humor could be grating at times, he truly
The elevator doors opened with little more than a pleasant ding, but Steve felt as though Tony had burst into the room, dramatic fanfare and all.  He stood frozen, heart going like a racehorse, and had the grim realization that at last it was time to face the music.
?  He had no reason to be nervous, not a single one.  He doubted Tony had gotten them floats, so it wasn’t like he’d have to put on a show for the crowd or anything, not that he lacked experience in that area.  It would just be the two of them, walking amongst the noise and the rabble, enjoying the festivities the same as anyone else.  There was no reason to be so wound up about it all.
Steve’s hand clenched spasmodically around his water bottle; the crinkle of the plastic seemed unusually loud against the kitchen tile.  If any of that water had been in his mouth, he’d have choked.  “What…”
Tony had a big grin on his face.  “The very one.  Met him at MIT.  Kinda had a crush on him for a while.  I didn’t realize it at first—that it was a crush, I mean.  I thought I just really liked the guy.”  He paused, then gave himself a conceding nod.  “Well, I guess I
Steve tried to swallow his nerves and only half succeeded.  “Figure out that you liked guys, too.”  He felt like his face was stuck over a boiling pot; his stomach revolted and his extremities felt numb.  He didn’t dare look at Tony again.
That night, Steve lay awake far into the earliest hours, gazing at the shadowed ceiling and listening to the ever-present cacophony of New York dozens of stories below.  His thoughts were consumed by the image of Tony, basking in the holograms’ blue light; Tony, red-faced with laughter during dinner over some lewd joke made by Clint and Natasha’s swift retribution; Tony, telling him the purple suited him, eyes running up and down the length of his torso, searching for something and apparently very satisfied with whatever they found.
Steve breathed as deeply as he could without giving himself away.  On the exhale, he tried for a smile himself, but he could feel how it wavered at the edges, and he knew it looked as uncertain as it felt.  “Yeah, well… I’ve always been more of a blue guy myself,” he said, trying to sound breezy.
, he thought, almost stupidly giddy about it.  “Is this a date?” he asked.  It had been meant to sound like a joke, but it didn’t.
closely as he cut the first slice of cake (“Birthday boy!” he exclaimed in celebration as he did it, and okay, maybe he was more than just
“Well, I actually didn’t.  Go on a date, I mean.  There was no one.  I just wanted to see how you’d react to the idea of me going out with a guy.”
Steve wished the ground would just open up and swallow him whole.  His cheeks tingled sharply as they warmed, and he hoped to God the blush wasn’t as obvious to either of them as it was to him.  “I’m really sorry, Tony,” he said, “I’m just… tired today.  Give me one more chance?”
He hadn’t so much as seen last year’s Pride March, too busy assisting the Manhattan clean-up efforts in the wake of the Chitauri invasion.  Tony had gone—with Natasha, actually—and though he didn’t have a float, he nevertheless came home absolutely giddy, trailing glitter in every color of the rainbow with stripes of pink, purple, and blue painted on both cheeks.  He’d been like a little kid in a candy shop, all big grins and lit-up eyes, and Natasha had been happy, too, Steve recalled: a more subdued happiness that was obvious in her feline smile and the confident way she moved.
“Jesus Christ, just look at it, it’s…”  Tony ran a hand over his mouth, seemingly at a loss for words for once.  He locked eyes with Steve, and his gaze said everything his mouth couldn’t:
But when he got to the kitchen on the communal floor, Tony wasn’t there.  Everyone else was, surprisingly: Bruce pouring himself a glass of water from a big pitcher; Thor quaffing coffee from a mug, hopefully not about to smash anything; Natasha tucked into a plate of fettuccine alfredo, mouth stuffed full; Clint standing at the stove over a steaming skillet of veggies, sifting through them with a spatula.  He glanced over his shoulder as Steve entered, then turned back to his cooking.
in response to Steve’s comment about settling (and it worked out just fine that way, but technically, Steve never said the one he’d settle for was a woman).
Tony smiled, a slow-growing expression that drew attention to his intense dark eyes glittering in the afternoon sun.  Looking at that smile, Steve felt breathless.  Sudden anxiety took him; he averted his eyes and played with the carnation’s petals, smooth like silk.
“This is a big deal for you,” Tony said suddenly.  He looked to Steve.  “Right?  I mean, your paintings are… your drawings… they’re like… they’re like my inventions.  They’re a part of you, the way the stuff I build is a part of me.  I don’t show just anyone what I make.  That’s… personal.  Private.  You painted this for
to know.  And Steve himself had never had any problem with people like Tony—had, in fact, thought the problem many of his contemporaries had with them was silly, unwarranted,
Tony shook his head.  “Red and blue,” he insisted.  “Makes purple.  You always had it in you, Captain.”
“Havin’ fun, Steve-o?” Tony called.  His cheeks were once more painted with stripes of pink and blue and purple; they glimmered with sweat and sunlight when he smiled.  Steve realized in that moment that it could just be the two of them, in the dark and the cold, marching all by themselves, and as long as they were together he would still be having the time of his life.
hiding from you,” Steve said with something like a pout.  He totally had been.  “Found this place… hm, maybe a week ago?  I was just looking around for somewhere I’d never been.  The courtyard caught my eye.”  He tipped his sandwich towards Tony and smiled.  “Not to mention the menu,” he teased back.
Tony nearly jumped out of his skin; the jerking motion of his hands sent the closest holograms to him spinning away, and he sighed noisily in exasperation.  His chest expanded with breath as he prepared to snap at whoever had waltzed into his lab, but when he saw Steve, he stopped short.  His expression froze for an instant, eyebrows scrunched and lips parted, and then he gave a crooked smile and said, “It fits.”
Steve had no idea what to do with this information.  Maybe there were more important paths to pursue, but—“And… do you
Despite his irritation, Steve couldn’t help the wry smile that flitted across his face.  He could picture quite clearly how
The Brooklyn Botanic Garden was packed on a cool Saturday afternoon.  In early April, the trees at the Cherry Esplanade were just shedding the last of their flowers, and the discarded cherry blossoms carpeted the grass like soft pink snowfall.  Those few minutes on Cherry Walk, it had been like Steve was eleven years old again, his mother gently pulling him along as they both craned their necks this way and that to marvel at the shower of radiant blooms.  His allergies had been going absolutely haywire that day, but he hadn’t cared, begging Mom to stay even as she grew concerned about his asthma and insisted they head home.
Steve took a deep breath and shook his head a little bitterly.  “I don’t even know why I’m going,” he muttered.  Guilt bit him; he knew he was in denial.
But Peggy had only gazed at him, intense dark eyes searching, and then she’d smiled enigmatically, making Steve wonder if he was in trouble after all.  “Oh,” she’d said, in a voice so innocent it had to be an act, “you know…
she had a mission for SHIELD, but Steve was certain she was lying.  He, Thor, and Bruce were all abysmal cooks (though Bruce did make a mean curry, and Thor could at least handle eggs), so they ended up ordering out, and the hour or so they spent together was pleasant but awkward for the knowledge of how many of them were missing.
Steve turned around and left.  He felt numb all the way down to the ground floor, all the way outside, all the way to Central Park, and feeling didn’t return until he was nearly halfway through his run.  At which point he had only one thought to sustain his sanity:
.”  Steve’s mouth snapped shut at the annoyed quality of Tony’s voice.  “For God’s sake, Steve, just let me take you out somewhere.  We can go for lunch, anywhere you like, my treat.  All-you-can-eat buffet?  The most expensive restaurant in New York City?  You name it, we’re there.”
Steve could see them, too, a miniature sea of red and blue and purple.  Signs were thrust above their heads: WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HERE and NOT A PHASE and BI AND PROUD.  He read that last one again; something tightened his chest and throat, so much that he couldn’t breathe for a moment, and he held onto Tony’s hand so hard some part of him wondered if it hurt, but he couldn’t let go.  Wouldn’t let go, no matter what.
know,” Steve shot back, smirking, “I’ll be making promises to show up somewhere and then breaking them to get a little more time with my paintbrushes in.”
A surprising feeling of buoyancy ballooned in Steve’s chest at that, swallowing some of the nerves of before and converting them into a satisfied sort of confidence.  “Oh, alright,” he said, trying not to sound too happy.  “Well, in that case”—his smile came much more easily this time—“why don’t you come down and have some pasta?  Whole gang's waiting, you know.  And you
like it, not just say he did because it was a gift.  “Here goes,” he said mostly to himself, and he reached out and pulled the sheet from the easel with a silken whisper.
It wasn’t just Pride, though, really.  It was Tony’s comment about his uniform, about fitting in.  Steve still had a lot of learning to do before he was all caught up with the twenty-first century, but he wasn’t stupid or ignorant.  He knew what the colors sported by Captain America meant in Tony’s world—and it sure as hell wasn’t the American flag.
“The drawings you did here.”  Surreptitiously, Tony stretched, his right hand brushing one of the green carnations.  “Or, you know, your drawings in general.  I’m sure you have lots of ’em.”
The sincerity of it almost caught Steve off guard—almost.  He smiled breathlessly at Tony, whose intense dark eyes flashed in the sun, and said, “Me, too!”
Steve used to lie awake at night thinking of her like this, too.  Only that had been different.  His thoughts of Peggy had been because he loved her.  Tony was just… a hell of a personality.  That was it.
“Nat?”  She looked at him; Steve suddenly hoped what he was about to ask wasn’t too personal an inquiry.  “Why do you go to Pride?”
Natasha probably knew it, too, but if she did she gave nothing away.  “For the party,” she suggested.  “The atmosphere.  Pride is high energy; it gets pretty wild.  There’s barely enough time to do and see everything.  Like I said, I think you’ll have fun.  We all will.”
“What kind of float are we talking about here?” Steve asked as he entered the kitchen, pulling a bottle of water from the fridge.  He was getting ready to head out for his daily run; normally he’d have finished it by now, but after committing violent crimes against no less than four punching bags, he’d collapsed into bed and into a blessedly dreamless sleep for several hours past his usual wake-up time.  He was still tired, but not as exhausted as he’d been before, so hallelujah on that.
But although Steve had no problem with people like Tony, he wasn’t one of them.  He couldn’t be.  It was women who’d always caught his interest, women who did still.  He noticed their beauty, the ways they walked and talked, their little quirks and idiosyncrasies, the times they smiled and the times they frowned.  It just wasn’t the same with men.  Was it?  He didn’t notice any of those things on a man.
After dropping his painting, easel, and art supplies off on his floor of the tower, Steve decided to head down to the communal floor to see what the others were up to.  The plan was for the Avengers to have dinner together tonight, but the last time they’d tried that, Tony holed up in his lab to work on God only knew what; Clint got called off on a mission for SHIELD; and Natasha
Something that felt an awful lot like hope blossomed deep in Steve’s chest.  His instincts told him to tamp it down, rationalize it away, but he squashed them and listened, for once, to what he was feeling instead.  Yeah, that was definitely hope.  Hope and comfort.
“You could never,” Tony said.  Any other time it would have sounded like a joke.  He was still staring at the painting, looking on the verge of emotional.  Normally at this point, he’d be covering up his reaction with some of his patented sarcasm and flippancy, but now he wasn’t even trying.  In spite of his relief, Steve felt worry grip him.
Steve was quiet for a long moment.  “Okay, then.  It’s a date,” and he didn’t even try to make it sound like a joke.
And Steve’s response, quiet for how he missed Bucky already, quiet with a keening sort of longing that made him feel like he was going to shatter under its strength and never be able to find all the pieces, had been—
Steve froze just as he was about to take a sip of his coffee.  He lowered the ceramic cup.  “Yeah,” he said softly.  “How’d you know?”
Bucky.  Steve’s chest tightened with a familiar, potent misery.  He always felt breathless whenever he thought of his old friend, and he knew part of that was pain, a horrid cocktail of grief and guilt and self-loathing—but was there something else to it as well?  Something he’d been ignoring all these years?
“Hey, making fun of my size there, Spangles?” Tony asked with feigned hurt.  His grin had a lascivious lilt to it, and Steve felt his stomach squirm, half pain and half pleasure.  He got this feeling around Tony sometimes, and the strange flipping sensation of earlier, but he’d never been able to puzzle out why.  He didn’t like it, or so he told himself at night.  “It must’ve been left behind by someone.”
In any case, that was a non-answer at best.  Steve looked at Pepper and raised his eyebrows in questioning.
, that was why.  Liking both wasn’t sustainable anyway—eventually, he’d have to pick one, and he’d made his choice long ago, before he’d even realized there was one to be made.  He liked women.  That was it.  Tony and Bucky… they were just really good friends of his.  He liked them a lot—loved them, even—but not… not like that.
“You’re gonna eat me out of house and home, Cap,” Tony joked, watching Steve dig into his third turkey and avocado on Italian.
, made every nerve ending in his body tingle with fire, made Steve feel like he was somehow complete, but
Tony beamed, that megawatt grin.  “It’s a date.  I promise I’ll take you out on lots as long as you don’t go all Houdini and disappear on me again.”
it was a shirt.  “You wear it, y’know, on your body.  Found it in my closet.  Designer—Neiman Marcus, I think.”  He spoke so quickly it nearly gave Steve a headache.  “Try it on for size, Capsicle.  I think you’d look good in purple.”
Violets always made him think of Peggy.  Once, he’d watched her hand one off to a woman with coiffured blonde hair; the two had exchanged words, but from a distance he hadn’t been privy to them, their painted lips forming silent shapes and smiles.  The blonde woman had leaned in, pecked Peggy on the cheek, and walked away, violet in hand, and when Peggy had turned and Steve got a good look at her face, her cheeks were positively aflame.  The memory was striking for that reason alone—it was the only time he’d ever seen the cool, unflappable Agent Carter
Steve laughed a little, still enjoying the sound of his name on Tony’s lips.  He wasn’t as surprised by Tony’s understanding as he would have thought he’d be.  “You’re right: it is a big deal.  That’s why I did it.  I figured it was the best present I could give you.”
She smiled, and it was a surprisingly soft expression on her usually steely face.  “I’m asexual,” she said simply, openly.  “It’s kind of funny: I was trained to use sex as a weapon against marks, but I never really understood what the big deal was.  For a long time I thought I was broken, like something was wrong with me.  Clint helped me realize that wasn’t the case.”
“I…”  Steve had never been more confused in his entire life.  “I—s-sure, why not?”  He thought of the flags that had been painted on Tony’s cheeks and shook his head.  “But Tony, I’m not—”
“The ace crowd.  Or one of ’em, at any rate.  Hey, we should go find the rest of the bisexual motherfuckers.  Come on, I know where they usually march.”  Tony grabbed his hand and started pulling him against the flow of people.  Their palms were sweat-slicked and slid against one another; without even thinking about it, Steve tightened his grip, and he felt Tony squeeze back as he glanced at Steve with a happy light in his eyes.
Bucky, swaggering towards him after saving him from yet another ass-kicking in yet another dark alley, grinning like a fox, like he knew everything there was in the world to know (and for all that Steve told him he was taking all the stupid with him, he didn’t doubt it back in those days).
“Aha,” Natasha said suddenly, “I have found my people.  Well, boys”—she turned to walk backwards, smirking at them both—“have fun.”
“Do I like…”  Another shake of his head.  “Steve,” he said again, and Steve shivered.  “It’s… incredible.”
Once in the elevator going up, he allowed himself to scowl.  “JARVIS,” he ordered, glowering at the ceiling, “what exactly is Tony doing in his lab that’s so important he can’t even come down to dinner?  This is the second time he’s bounced in as many weeks.  There’s a reason we try to spend time together every once in a while, you know—so we’re not constantly at each other’s throats the rest of the time?”
Natasha smirked and Steve knew she could see right through him.  Damn her.  “That you’re coming to Pride with us,” she said.  Her smirk slid into something more authentic.  “It’ll be your first time.  Pretty exciting.”
Tony looked at him pensively.  Steve was suddenly, terribly aware of how perfectly their fingers fit together, like they were meant to be interlocked this way.  “If you want it to be.”
, but that night, camaraderie had lit the room in gold and champagne shades and laughter had filled up the empty spaces Steve sometimes forgot lurked within his heart.
“Do you like it?” Steve asked quietly.  He thought about mentioning how hard he’d worked on it, but Tony must have seen that; he
“Awesome!” Tony interrupted jubilantly.  “And hey, no worries, El Capitan.  I’m sure you’ll fit in just fine.  You get the picture.”
“Oh, that.”  Tony sighed, not sounding overly upset, and shook his head.  He pulled a hand through his hair, making it stick out all over the place; Steve watched the motion very closely.  “Didn’t pan out,” he said simply, and seemed disinclined to explain much further.
“Hey, man, it’s alright,” the young man said genially.  “No need to explain.  I get it.”  He peered at Steve over the rims of his sunglasses and winked like the two of them were on the inside of some great joke.  Then he fell back into marching, hollering and chattering to his fellows on either side of him.
Steve smiled, and now he did say, “I’m glad you like it.  I worked really hard on it, you know.  I kept worrying I was gonna screw it up.”
.  It’s been about seven years, but I definitely know you from somewhere.  Have we officially met?  Tony Stark, pleasure to make your acquaintance.”  He held out his hand for a shake.
Abruptly forgetting the events of the past few moments, Steve pivoted on his heel and glared sternly at Tony, who stepped into the elevator.  “Tony, I want you back in time for dinner tonight.  You’re not skipping out like you did last time.”
They marched over a rainbow-striped crosswalk at the corner of 7th Avenue and Christopher Street, and before Steve knew it they were standing in front of the Stonewall Inn.  Dozens of flags clustered around the second-story windows like brilliantly colored flowers growing in sill gardens; the lit-up glass reflected long draping banners that said things like STOP THE HATE and WE ARE HERE.  A cheer like none before went up through the crowd at the sight of the inn’s brick walls; Steve’s ears positively rang with it, and more clearly than any other he could hear Tony’s voice, whooping excitedly.  He squeezed; Tony squeezed back, and swung their clasped hands to and fro like an exuberant little kid.
Snapping in flags in hundreds of hands on each side of the street; bouncing in layers of tulle fastened around dancers’ waists; sparkling in a thousand pieces of jewelry around heads and wrists and ankles, sweat-glistened and gleaming in the sun; fluttering in the form of paper flowers strung about parade goers’ necks, everywhere Steve looked.  There was hardly an inch of New York that wasn’t covered in the rainbow, it seemed, and he was draped in it, too: a lei hanging down to the center of his chest, scraping at the base of his neck; beads and chains that had been pushed onto his arms with glowing reverence by a merrymaker with multi-colored streaks in her hair and delight in her soul.  It was suffocatingly hot in his purple button-up, but he couldn’t have cared less if he’d tried, and to either side of him Tony and Natasha were also close to boiling, but they were both smiling in a way he’d rarely seen.
“Pride float,” Tony said.  He took an aggressive pull from the can of Pepsi in his hand, a solution Pepper had enforced to curb the worst of his pre-noon drinking habits.  Privately, Steve thought it was a good idea, but he knew it wasn’t his place to say so.
A moment passed in quiet.  “It took me a while, you know,” Tony said then.  “To accept it.  I wasted a shit ton of time thinking it wasn’t real, that I’d have to ‘pick a side’ eventually.
“Hey, we’re almost at the inn!” Tony said, snapping Steve back to awareness.  He swallowed with difficulty.
Steve thought he should make some excuse, explain away his disappearance as quickly as possible, but all that came out was “Tony.”
Tony put his hands up.  “Alright, truce.”  He sobered then.  “You’ve been avoiding me,” he said, an edge of accusation in his voice.
Steve had already known this: that it wasn’t just women Tony counted as notches on his bedpost.  He’d heard Tony talk about other men—strangers, usually, picked up in some bar or at some Stark Industries soirée—in a decidedly more-than-friendly tone too often
, Steve thought; God, no.  But looking at the well-concealed hope in Tony’s expression, he said, “Yeah.  I’m good now.”
“Tony,” Pepper began in a lecturing tone, “you know registration for the floats ended back in March—”
mention the menu, my poor wallet can’t take it.”  Tony took an innocent bite of his jelly-slathered bagel as Steve snorted incredulously.  He cast his gaze around the courtyard, taking in the artistic play of sunlight and shadow on the old cobblestones, the clusters of galaxy-purple and chalk-green carnations to either side of him.  “Bet you came here to draw, didn’t you?”
—then looked at the person who had thrown it.  It was Tony, with his eyebrows pushed up to where his red sunglasses rested on his hairline and a sarcastic expression on his face.
Later, back at the tower, Tony had broken out a bottle of champagne that, according to him, he’d been saving just for the occasion.  The sparkling golden bubbles took up residence in his eyes as he’d poured a flute for each teammate, quipping and congratulating, and he’d topped up Steve’s glass with just a bit more than he’d given the others, winking at him slyly.
“Aren’t you supposed to be in the med bay?” he said sternly.  The Avengers had just returned home after a very unpleasant skirmish with Doom; there had been a few injuries, the most severe of which had been those of Natasha, who’d been briefly overwhelmed by an aggressive surge of Doombots.
Steve blinked, taken aback.  “What?  Oh.”  He looked down at himself, at the silk gleaming in the spectral light of the holograms.  “Yeah.  Thank you.  Actually, about that”—he met Tony’s eyes again, glad to have been reminded of his earlier question—“why exactly did you have something like this just lying around?  It certainly wouldn’t fit
Tony glanced at the lab-spanning sea of holograms, lips pursed.  There was that knife’s edge in his eyes again, a brief contemplation that put all the rapidly working gears in his head on full display.  The seriousness of the expression was ruined by his crazy Einstein hair, though, and Steve felt a powerful surge of affection for him in that moment as he tried not to laugh.  Finally Tony said, “Yeah, alright, I’m pretty much done here for now anyways.”  He turned back to Steve and let go that luminescent grin of his again; Steve wondered momentarily at what a good mood Tony seemed in tonight, and before he knew it, the thought had him smiling back.
Steve took a deep breath and exhaled it through his nose, trying to keep a lid on his frustration so Bruce wouldn’t think it was directed at him.  So Tony had gotten home in time for dinner like he’d asked, then decided not to show?  “Of course he did,” he said tightly.  “I’ll be right back.”
“Compared it to how I’d felt about girls all my life.  I crushed on one of my maids when I was a kid—though, come to think of it, she and my dad may have…”  Tony shuddered.  “Let’s not go down that route.  But there was the maid, a couple of girls in high school… the list goes on.  When I realized I felt the same way about Rhodey as I did about them, it all just kind of clicked.  Lots more things made sense then.”  He tilted his head thoughtfully, gazing at Steve.  “Why d’you ask?”  He sounded like he already knew the answer.
doing this thing.  They’d go to Pride and have a great time and it would be an amazing experience worth having.  Steve wasn’t about to back out, especially at the last minute, not after he’d made a promise to both Tony and himself.  It was just… he’d started to wonder if attending the March together was going to be a date, and if it was, what that even
.  Were thoughts of Tony unexpected?  No.  Were they mind-breakingly confusing and frustrating?  Absolutely.  Had anyone been around to hear it, he’d have denied snarling like a wild animal as he ripped off his blanket and slammed to his feet.  If making art was one of the best ways he knew to clear his head, destroying a dozen punching bags in the gym was almost as good.
throwing his proverbial hands in the air and giving up; no, sir, not at all).  With careful, steady strokes that looked much more effortless than they felt, he began committing the violets to paper—the leaves shaped like serrated hearts and the little ants roaming the stems.  In patches of sunlight, the petals took on a reddish tint; then, cast back into the shadows by the breeze, they edged closer to dark blue.  Purple, he thought absently, completely lost in the activity.  A hell of a color.
“Later” turned out to be noon the next day, when Tony had finally slept off most of his hangover and post-celebration grumpiness.  Steve, a bundle of nerves, summoned Tony to his floor of the tower, where in the living room stood an easel draped under a big white sheet.
The shirt fit perfectly, which bothered Steve maybe more than it should have, because why the hell did Tony have something this big just lying around?  It certainly wasn’t a pajama shirt or something to lounge around in; it was high quality and undoubtedly expensive.  If not for the fact that it would have been ridiculous to be paranoid over this, Steve would be expecting some sort of elaborate punchline.  Hell, knowing Tony, an elaborate punchline was still entirely possible.  God, that man was exhausting sometimes.
“Be decent, Tony,” he said, but his voice—his heart—wasn't in it.  He felt almost shaky all of a sudden, imagining that.  Shaky and dejected.  And pissed off.
“Oh,” Steve said softly.  He thought of Natasha asking Clint if it was okay to be the way she was, and his answering smile.
In the near-total blackness of his room at three in the morning, he turned over and directed his gaze where he knew his painting of the violets rested against the wall.  He looked long and hard, and eventually the canvas’s white edges floated into view.  He thought he could see the dark amorphous shape of the violets sprouting up, too, but maybe that was just his imagination filling in the gaps.  He thought of the color purple, and the way that shirt had felt against his skin (
When Tony winked at him, Steve got the distinct impression he was missing something.  “Wh—” he started as his stomach did an odd little flip, not even sure what he wanted to say, but then Tony brushed past him and called for the elevator.
Silence came over them for a few moments—a light, contemplative sort of silence.  Finally, Tony said, “Jeez, that’s tough to say, Cap.  It’s been such a big part of me for so long now.  Honestly?  I think it was Rhodey.”
“I love you,” Steve said.  He was still getting used to the feel of those words in his mouth, the taste of them; he said them every chance he got, wondering when he’d finally grow accustomed to their presence in his life.  He figured it must annoy the hell out of Tony, but if that was the case, Tony didn’t let on.  Instead, he responded, sleepily this time around, with the same unhesitating words he gave back every time:
A motorcycle revved; an elderly woman with cropped salt-and-pepper hair and a leather vest waved back, grinning sharply as she rode by.
“Okay.”  Steve took a deep breath, willing away the tremble in his fingertips.  He’d worked really hard on this piece, and he felt a desperate need for Tony to like it—
I felt alone.”  Steve had rarely seen Tony looking so serious.  “Really alone.  Like I was the only one in the world who felt this way, even though I knew I wasn’t.  It wasn’t an instant ‘hey, awesome, I’m bi’ thing.  It took time.”  He smiled cheekily.  “But I figured it out eventually.  And I
Tony’s eyes got very big; Steve was abruptly reminded of a deer, pretty eyes dark and full of unmoving startlement.  On the canvas was an abstract rendition of that first day in the lab: Tony, rendered in gentle yet intense shades of blue and pink and purple, the sole pillar of solidness in a landscape of floating ghosts, face etched deep with focus and alive in the glow of his creations.  It was that day as Steve remembered it, ethereal and full of emotion, the true beginning of the past months’ journey whose destination Steve didn’t quite know yet.  It was Tony at the center of a world—Steve’s world, for as long as the scene took to see, for as long as it took to paint, and far beyond that.
