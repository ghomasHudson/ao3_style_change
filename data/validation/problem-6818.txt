“He's also kind of an asshole, but the apple don't fall far from the tree. Anyway! Um.” Stark falters, pressing his lips together. Steve hands him back the tablet carefully, aware that he's just been fiddling with the molecular structure of something most likely highly flammable.   “Thanks. If you're hungry I think Carol might be roasting something.” Steve is almost always hungry now, but food just doesn't seem appealing. Still he nods encouragingly, letting Stark back out into the hallway.  “I'm happy you decided the stay here.” Stark says, as if Steve's doing him a favor by staying in his house. Steve can't figure him out at all.  “And yeah, shutting up now and leaving. Bye, take care, call me if you need me. I'll have more stuff for you later.”
“Uh. Winghead, do you really think someone like Stark would be okay being with someone that hurt him like that?” If possible, Steve's expression becomes even more mulish.
“You!”  Zemo shrieked, jumping back away from Steve, his eyes were wide, arrogant still but afraid, “I thought you were dead, I thought I had rid myself of you forever!”
“Hey Stark, Stark, Staaark-” Clint whines, rolling across the cushions to get a little closer. “Let's watch something.”
“Alright? Alright Tony?” Steve gasps out. Tony's eyes have slipped shut, he pushes himself up and back so his shoulders rest against Steve's chest. He's quiet, harsh panting gasps leaving his lips until their hips are flush, and Steve kisses over his shoulders, runs his hand over his stomach, and up under the crop top to press a palm over the arc.
Hammer keeps talking, immune to Tony's visceral disdain as he always is. “Watched your eulogy, the speech you gave for him was really-” Hammer takes a drink of his martini, hand over his heart in an exaggerated pantomime of grief. Tony wants to plant his fist right in his bleached chiclet veneer teeth. “-really touching”
“Out, get out, I've had enough of you Captain Sassypants.” For all he sounds affronted, his face is still endearingly flushed. Steve winds him in close again, cooing endearments to him in French, making them as sweet and saccharine as possible. Tony grows redder and redder until they reach the kitchen and he scampers away to perch on the counter next to Bruce.
“Does that feel good, is this-I can stop-I'm not hurting you am I?” Steve really needs to work on understanding when Tony's on the verge of taking his clothes off.  Tony wonders if it would be bad form to rip his shirt off and hang a
Tony props his head on Steve's lap while Clint scrolls through their massive movie selection. Hulk has already eaten through a pile of snacks, but he appears to have several more stacks within reach. On the other couch, Jan and Natasha are playing rock paper scissors over the last box of sour candy gummy worms. Thor is singing loudly and off key to Jane over the phone while Sam covers his ears with one hand and tries to hide the box of cookies he snuck into the tower beneath a pillow on his lap.
“I can't believe we came in our pants.” He says instead. Steve laughs, and Tony starts looking for the wet wipes he knows to be stowed in the center console near the driver's seat.
“Yeah okay, okay.” Tony grumbles, but the smile on his face is wide, genuine. A few beats of silence pass, before Tony's lips brush against his ear again.  “You want to hear the rest of my projects?” Tony asks almost shyly. Steve smiles, tilting his head to show he's listening.
“Careful” Tony murmurs, dark eyes fixed on his, the pupils blown out wide.  "Or I might think you mean something by all this.” The words are hesitant, clearly meant to give Steve an out-to turn this into their usual banter, but Steve is done being cautious, has been for months now. This is it. He thinks. His chance to lay it all out, to make Tony see what he's been trying to show him.
“Go go, try it on, go.” Tony shoos him.  Steve jumps, grabbing the gear from the table and going to change in the bathroom Tony points him in the direction of. He feels giddy with possibility, Tony has given him permission to court him, in so many words. Steve is going to put his all into it, he has to.
It's an odd disconnect for a man with the reputation he has. Then again Steve lives with him, it's all one big long front. Steve is just happy he gets to see behind the curtain. He really likes the wizard hiding back there.
“No, non lo sono, la nonna era uno squalo e lo sei anche tu.”  Steve answered back without missing a beat.  Tony threw his head back and laughed delightedly.
Camp Lehigh was as far from home as he’d ever been.  Even though there were others all around, it was still an isolating experience in many ways.  Steve stuck out there like a sore thumb; surrounded by alphas and betas stronger than him, healthier in every way, Steve found himself at the back of marching formations, he struggled with exercises, and nothing in his training with Lorenzo could have prepared him for real hand to hand instruction with a drill sergeant breathing down his neck.  The tincture Dr.  Erskine had given him for the bronchitis had helped tremendously, but it couldn’t make up for every other ache and pain Steve had carried with him for as long as he could remember.  Still, he stuck it out, he had to do better, to show them all he belonged there, that he’d do anything to serve, to be a good protector, the kind of alpha he’d always wanted to be.  He wouldn’t squander this chance, no matter how much his body hurt when he fell into his bed in the barracks at night.
“Sorry,” Steve says, glum and contrite all at once.  Tony just laughs, stepping back and swatting him on the rear playfully, directing him towards a colander full of imposingly green leafy things, and a few halved pears.
“Tony, are you going to come for me? Come on Sweetheart, show me, show me how good it feels, show me how good I'm fucking you.” Steve gasps out, hardly able to believe the words coming out of his own mouth, but Tony's reaction is something he will draw later. Tony's breath stutters, arching so hard only his head remains on the pillows, eyes rolling up and fingers scrabbling at the sheets when Steve slaps his hand away from his cock and replaces it with his own, grabbing at Tony's hip with his free-hand.
“Why did you choose me?”  Steve asked, after the silence between them stretched on.  The building around them was alive with activity, scientists and personnel preparing for something important:  Project Rebirth, him, he supposed.  “I just don’t really understand is all, there were better soldiers there than me, and I kind of got the impression General Phillips wasn’t too keen on an alpha, for this.”  That and, he often looked a little teary eyed when Steve was doing drills, as if watching Steve struggle was ruining his entire day.
Steve took it from him, staring down at the huge plate of what looked like some kind of chips and bright yellow sauce, meat, and spicy smelling red stuff.  He could feel his cheeks turning a little pink from the way Tony had gone about it, but he was so hungry.  Steve sniffed it, and then popped one of the chips in his mouth.  It was delicious, spicy and hot.
Tony was probably an alpha, but it wasn’t unheard of, was it?  The saleswoman hadn’t seemed all that surprised.  He imagined it, Tony laying back, letting Steve cover him with his body.  He would be so warm, he always looked so warm, welcoming.
He should have known Tony would be right. He can almost hear him, see him in the lab, half turned towards Steve with a grin of self satisfied triumph.
There wasn’t really anything he could have said to that.  Not without being a total heel who ignored their wishes.  Besides, Steve supposed they were right.  He was just a skinny little alpha walking up to them.  There was no reason for them to have believed he was capable of holding his own against anyone really, alpha or not.
“Well um. Well. I.” His mouth snaps shut when Steve stands, coming over to link their hands together. The rest of the Avengers are silent, but he hears Thor sigh somewhat dreamily and pointedly ignores it. If someone had told him he would meet the Norse god of thunder-and that said Norse god would end up being obsessed with romance novels he probably would have had a few choice words for them. He's seen Thor's library though, the man has enough material to fill a book store.
beyond the pale. He and Steve are really doing this thing, it's normal to want, Tony's just not used to any of his more romantic leanings being fulfilled.  He's usually the one pulling out all the stops, planning the dates, all that stuff.  They're taking this at Steve's pace though.  He has to admit, being courted by Steve Rogers is way better than his fantasies about Captain America ever could have been.
“You want dinner, how about Patsy's when we get back?” Steve loves Patsy's Pizza, it's been around since he was a kid, and it doesn't seem to have changed all that much. Sometimes when he goes in there he feels like he almost might be back in the forties-well if he ignores all the people milling around, but it's still nice on days he's feeling nostalgic.
kind of banana. You're going to go jog right? It's too early for you to get in bed with me.” Oh how he wishes that were not the case. Steve has better things to do than cuddle him while he sleeps. He's too tired to offer anything enticing right now as it is, and Steve obviously has his plan. “Mister Nanners, Capnana, he's soft and he makes a good pillow.” That and it always makes him think of Steve, but he's not going to say that. He's being ridiculous enough as it is. A wide smile is pulling across Steve's face though, as if there's nothing better than the idea of Tony wanting his silly plush.
Tony, or Tony Stark, as it turned out was not only the Avengers benefactor, but also Iron Man.  He greeted Steve in the garage of the biggest mansion Steve had ever seen.  He was still in the armor, red and gold, like a figurine of Midas made real, but as welcoming a host as he had ever met.  He gave Steve an abbreviated tour of the place, while helpfully not mentioning how badly Steve’s hands were trembling.
“Sure Cap, I'll add blue to my repertoire, just for you.” Tony simpers, batting his lashes ostentatiously in Steve's direction. This close he can see each individual lash-the dark frame of them casting shadows over warm brown irises.  “So, what's this about Crossbones anyway?” Tony whispers, interrupting Steve's intense scrutinization of his face.
She leaned forward to whisper conspiratorially.  “You’re welcome, and for what it’s worth, I think your intended is one lucky guy.”  This close he could tell she was an alpha.  That gave him more confidence in the gifts, if she thought they were good ones, he supposed she’d know, and she hadn’t judged him for wanting to court a possible alpha.
“Kay.” He says for lack of the ability to come up with anything better in the face of Steve Rogers asking him on a date while sporting an amazing case of bedhead.
“I’d say if he doesn’t, then he’s got his head stuck up his rear end.”  Steve nearly dropped the book on beading he had been reading, jumping up to walk over to the bed and help Sarah drink the water she was reaching for.
“Oh yeah, real sure about that aren't you Shellhead?” He says, squeezing Tony's hand affectionately.  Tony just shakes his head, looking away. He doesn't comment when they make it to a big outdoor rink and Steve makes good on his promise; taking Tony's hand in his and pulling him onto the ice.
“Never thought I could have this, have you.” Steve speaks against Tony's lips like a secret. Tony shivers, pressing closer, pulling him into more kisses. He's so eager, so warm and genuine, and Steve is gone on the moment, lost in everything he never thought he could have. He's so awed, so grateful, he wishes he was as good with words as Tony is, so he could tell him exactly how much this means to him; how much
“You're very naked, you answer the door for our breakfast like that?”  Steve croaks out once he manages to unstick his tongue from the roof of his mouth.  Tony tosses his head back in a laugh, then leans down to steal a fleeting kiss. He doesn't sit up though, leaning over Steve, rubbing his thumbs over Steve's cheeks, blue eyes soft and sparkling with amusement.
“Yes, and I'm real green right now, just so-” Steve turns his head, rubbing his nose against Tony's silk covered wrist “so you know.” He can smell him through the sleek material; a warm heady scent that speaks of expense, and makes something curl tight in Steve's gut with arousal.
JARVIS' reply is lost on him, but he gathers enough wit together to rasp out “Get him out, get him, he is not supposed to be here, not on the guest list.” His voice sounds wrecked to his own ears.  It's pathetic,
Down on the field, while there was some kind of dispute about the validity of a play, Tony pulled a big foam hat out of his box.  It was shaped in a circle, and looked a lot like the Statue of Liberty’s crown.  He grinned, and Steve helpfully inclined his head so Tony could lean up and settle it on his head.  He patted Steve’s hair, then sat back to admire his handiwork.  “There he is, the sentinel of liberty”
“Dramamine won't work on me. Not motion sick.” Steve has been poked and prodded with enough chemical concoctions to know it's pretty hopeless.  Iron Man seems to slump; compartments closing up all along the armor as he abandons his search for the medication. Steve opens the food pouch and dutifully pops a few strips of fruit into his mouth. More to appease Iron Man than because he's really hungry, and also to give his hands something to do. Something other than balling into such tight fists that he can hear his bones creak.
“Not living up to that now am I.” The words sound torn out of him, but Iron Man continues as if he hasn't spoken at all.
-To everyone on The Tony Stark Defense League Discord who listened to me yowling in frustration ILY more than words can express!
“No, darling, this sight is only for you, besides, I made this myself, aside from the muffins, those I bought and warmed in the oven.”  He says, cool minty breath fanning between them. “That is, if you do want to have breakfast, if you don't want to go, but-” Tony bites his lip, sitting back, and Steve doesn't want that at all, Tony moving away with that look on his face.
“Justin Hammer.” Natasha agrees, sitting back in her chair with all the satisfaction of a hunter having found her prey.
“This isn't going to be a training exercise is it? You're not going to tackle me on the ice right, because that would be mean.” Tony sounds just a little suspicious.  Steve laughs, pulling him in a little more tightly.
After jogging for two hours, he stopped by a vendor and picked up a pretzel and a hot dog, sitting on a bench to enjoy his spoils. A few giggling betas holding their phones waved at him, and he waved back, making sure to give them a friendly smile. Everyone seemed friendly too, while he jogged back to the mansion, stepping out of his way, and giving him plenty of room.
“As always talking to you is a Sisyphean endeavor. I feel like any minute now a vulture is going to swoop down and start picking at my liver. But I'm getting my metaphors mixed up. What do you want?” Tony is not playing nice with this asshole, not even for a moment.  Hammer just laughs, ignoring Tony's blatant hostility as he always does. Tony sips his drink at him in a way he hopes conveys his bitter contempt.
“Course I'm sure.  I want to sleep and I want-”  Steve swallows, feeling himself go red almost down to his toes with what he is about to ask for.  But Tony said he could ask for anything, and hasn't judged him yet. “I want you uh, up against my back.  I want you to hold me.” He says it loud and clear, straightening his back and refusing to back down, it comes out a little abrupt, but Tony still leans back, his mouth curving into the shape of an 'o'.
The drive takes over a day, but no driver means they can sleep in the car. Or rather, Tony and Rhodey sleep, the other two don't seem to rest at all. When they take breaks at rest stops there's always someone at his side. Tony avoids looking at the magazine racks and televisions, sinking into his hoodie when people look at him just shy of too long.
“Hey there, my sweet, beautiful guy, you with me?” Tony murmurs, and Steve just smiles, still not wanting to open his eyes.
Fantastic, now come on, give me a thrust, hit me with your best shot, sunshine.” Tony purrs, stroking himself again, unbending one of his legs to tap Steve's thigh with his heel. “Giddy up, cowboy,” Tony says, laughing when it registers even through the happy haze making Steve's thoughts slow, and he smiles wide, firming his hold on Tony's hips to hold him steady while he begins to move; carefully at first but then more decisively, firmly working his cock into Tony, watching his face, his body, reveling in the way Tony's body clutches at him, the way Tony's entire chest flushes and his eyes fall shut.
That's; that's well, something. Tony feels like he might cry, their first shared orgasms and neither of them even managed to get out of their pants. It would be a tragedy if it didn't tic so many boxes on his Ultimate Fantasy Hitlist (mostly involving One Steve Rogers). “Besides” Steve continues “This was about you, I wanted to do this, to see you. Like this.” He finishes, the set of his jaw making his bottom lip jut as he sets it stubbornly in reaction to whatever expression Tony can feel his face twisting into.
smelled like, close to the skin. God that was inappropriate, Steve winced, shoving that thought away with grim determination.  He was supposed to go shopping with the team, that was not the time to begin one of his guilty fantasy marathons about his friend and teammate.
When he walks into S.I. Pepper is waiting for him. She smiles, bumping her shoulder against his while they walk to R & D.
“You're going to have to spell it out, no jokes, he's not good with conversations about feelings, believe me I've been trying for years.” Rhodes stands up, patting Steve's shoulder consolingly.
“You forget your entire life, but you still remember that, man I have the worst luck.” He says, shaking his head, but there's a wide smile breaking out across his face. “Call me Rhodey.”
“Want you to be my contact, in case that ever happens.” Steve murmurs into the quiet of the room. Tony knew it was coming, saw the trajectory of this conversation, and still gets blindsided. Steve's cheek is hot against his, and Tony leans back, eyes roving over Steve's face searchingly. Steve's jaw is set stubbornly, brows knit together in a fretful line of worry.
Steve wasn’t sure why all eyes had turned to him with such disbelief, but he reached out and clasped Iron Man’s forearm just the same.  “That I am, honor to meet you all.”  The armor was so smooth, warm to the touch,  Steve almost imagined he could feel the living, breathing person beneath it.
“Oh so you brought your big blond boytoy with you. Well at least he's good for something.” Hammer says, as if Steve's presence leaves a bad taste in his mouth, and Tony wants to punch him right in the face, but he maintains his calm by remembering years of his mother teaching him how to smile in the face of people he despises. It's one thing for Hammer to insult him, it's another thing entirely for him to talk shit about
Dinner was a surprisingly casual affair.  Tony took him to a pub style restaurant with big plush booths, and about a hundred or so beers on tap.  He ate a big messy hamburger and stole fries from Steve’s plate, but declined to order his own, claiming stolen food always tasted better.
“Don't worry, Iron Man and I are still madly in love, you can tell your mommies I said so.” This seems to brighten her spirits, and she gamely joins in recreating her snowman, Tony dictating the size of the base for maximum sturdiness; holding her on his shoulders so she can plop the head on and its coal eyes. After they finish, Tony produces a sheet of Avengers stickers from somewhere in his pockets. They've attracted a small crowd, but the only ones that approach are the little girl's mothers, who thank Tony and Steve profusely for keeping her safe while they chased their little boy down-the apparent culprit of the first snowman destruction.
when Steve grinds into him with a hard involuntary thrust, both of them startle and curse, their rhythm thrown off, but Steve picks it back up again. He knows he should be focusing on getting Tony off too, but he has a few ideas as to how to go about that. Now in this moment it's all he can do to stay upright, thrusting and thrusting into Tony's welcoming body, hands on Tony's hips hard enough to bruise until he's coming, sagging over Tony's back and dropping panting open mouthed kisses over his neck and shoulders. Tony just groans, rolling his hips back and letting him ride it out. He doesn't know how long they rest like that, but Tony's sweaty hair is tickling his nose, and he's still flushed beautifully when Steve blinks back into the world of the living.
“Natasha,” he said, laughing. Natasha only smiled in response, reaching up with one of her gloved hands and patting his cheek, before sweeping up her mug and walking towards the door.
“That we have a visit to make to SHIELD.” Natasha finishes for him, smiling and rising to her feet, all grace and poise.  “You know, if that thing had really hurt you, we would have had to get you out of the armor.” She murmurs, looping her arm through his. Tony sighs, patting her hand and pushing off the desk, drawing his cellphone out to shoot off a few texts to his various other appointments.
He's always been too stubborn to back down, and he doesn't plan on starting today.  "I could use some of that old Irish luck 'ma, if you can hear me."  He says to himself once he's retrieved the shield and is safely ensconced in his bathroom.  "Or your charm Buck, maybe a little bit of both if you're feeling generous."  Somewhere he can picture one James Buchanan Barnes having a good hearty laugh at his expense.  Steve smiles despite himself.  What does Iron Man like to say sometimes?  Go big or go home.
He remembers Rhodes' words in the kitchen. Someone, or several someones hurt Tony in the past-likely enough that he has chosen to keep the truth from even his teammates. Steve mentally checks his own form across from the heavy bag and starts working it.  His fists connect with a satisfying thud, but it's not enough to fully distract him.  He can't shake that thought, that there are people around who would see Tony being Iron Man as a bad thing.  Steve can't imagine anything better, and it makes him angry too, if he's being completely honest.  Tony should be proud, Iron Man is incredible, and the armor isn't too shabby either.
“Steve.” He laughs, tugging him towards the shop “Stop being an ass and come eat your weight in yogurt.”
“Iron Man gonna be joining us?” Steve asks quietly, tugging him close to walk arm in arm towards the jet parked on the compound's helipad. Tony nods, pointing over to the red and gold armor standing just beside the jet. JARVIS is definitely getting some new servers, he's been so great about this whole running interference thing.
Tony's gaze flicks upwards as he drags his lips, then his tongue over his covered cock again, before pausing to
“Come now, you’re coming to the infirmary,”  He said to Waters, then turned to address Steve, “and you, Mister Rogers, I will speak with you this evening.”  Usually that kind of statement preceded a dressing down in Steve’s experience, but somehow Dr. Erskine’s tone made it seem warm, that Steve had done well.
“Hi Steve.”  He said, smiled wide, and then looked up, past wherever he must have set his phone to make the call.  “Bambi, I don’t care if Wilkins got the memo or not, the plant looks absolutely dismal, how are my people supposed to work in those conditions?”  He looked back down, the smile was back on his face, he took a sip of his coffee.  “Sorry, there’s  rash of stupid going around and I need to remind some people that I don’t just barely scrape by safety regs, anyway, I didn’t call you to bore you with all that, I called you to tell you all about the wonders of indoor heating.”
“Should have built her a suit of armor, kept the witch away.” Tony half slurs against his very Steve shaped pillow. The warm solid muscle beneath his cheek shakes with laughter.
Steve would bet dollars to donuts that Happy is behind the wheel. The other Avengers are grouped off to the side watching them. Steve mouths a quick
“I got flowers, I am the prettiest, fanciest person here.” He thinks about that for a moment. “No scratch that,
“No, they would not have, you just said so yourself, and that is why you are special, Mister Rogers.”  The words startled Steve back another two steps, he didn’t know whether he should have been getting ready to fight, or anything really.  It was so strange, so surreal, as if Steve were standing in the middle of one of Salvador Dali’s paintings watching the walls warp, and clocks melt.
“I noticed something-” Steve starts, and Tony scoots a little closer, listening intently as Steve maps out his observations. He interjects now and then, but for the most part seems content to hear him out. Their foreheads are pressed together; blue arclight casting a chilly glow over the space between their bodies. Steve only quiets when he notes that Tony is shivering slightly. The rest of the Avengers are deep asleep; slow even breaths fill the space, it looks like only he and Tony are still awake.
“I like that it's heavier Tony. Feels substantial.” He says, undeterred by Tony's continued besmirching of his old uniform.  Tony cuts off mid rant, finger half jabbed into the air for effectiveness in delivering his tirade against the horrors of last century superhero attire.  “Thank you. You're wonderful.” He says, and he means it.  Tony looks away, hands drumming along the lab table nervously. Steve stares at his hands, and suddenly everything makes perfect sense.  It's a nervous gesture so like Iron Man's that first day Steve woke up in this strange new world. An empty suit. Bruises with an explanation that just seems phoned in. Tony exhausted and aching but still working, funding the Avengers through his own pockets. Tony keeping untold secrets close, brown eyes wide and filled with something unspeakable in the hallway, leaning away from Steve's arms instead of into them. If it's true then Steve's in more trouble than he already thought he was.
“Sweetheart?” Tony repeats dumbly, Steve's answering smile is small and intimate in the shifting light of the television.
“What, you uh, just like that?”  Steve said, caught off guard entirely by that easy acceptance.  “What about my membership dues, shouldn’t I pay that first?”
The bed dipping and Tony murmuring to him wakes him up the second time.  He can smell baked goods, coffee, and bacon, but he still doesn't move, cracking one eye open to glance back at Tony.
“There was another alpha, one other, a man named Johann Schmidt, the serum destroyed him.”  Dr.  Erskine shook his head, his lips twisting into a semi grimace, “what there was to destroy.  He was already cruel, evil, working for Hydra, a crushing arm of the Nazis.  The serum, it made him stronger, madder, it took the alpha’s desire to protect and twisted it into a mad desire to subjugate, to rule.”  It was a horrifying story, and a terrifying thought, that something could taint the drives an alpha had, he could not imagine wishing to hold a power of that kind.
“Fuck yes.” Tony practically moans out. Steve feels the tips of his ears go a little hot. It's all too easy to imagine those words in a
“What ya got cooking in that brain of yours?” He asks, smiling encouragingly when tony turns onto his back to look up at him.
He runs a hand up beneath Tony's robe, traces the strong line of his back, the slope of his shoulders.  He feels so warm, covered and comfortable here, with Tony's breaths puffing out against his neck. Tony murmurs sleepily when Steve rubs one broad palm over the soft skin of his lower back.  He cuddles closer, throwing one arm over Steve's shoulder, and Steve can't help but kiss the crown of his head, burying his nose in soft curling strands of jet black hair. He thinks of his lonely bed, how much he hates sleeping there, only doing so when it is absolutely necessary.  Here with Tony is nothing like that, and he finds himself yawning, sinking down into the soft cushioned bench. His thoughts feel fuzzy around the edges, warm and glowing with contentment. It's such an unusual feeling, one he hasn't felt for what seems like a lifetime now.
“It fits perfectly, it's heavier than the old uniform was-” He starts, smiling when Tony grunts, and turns his nose up with disdain.
“Sir” JARVIS starts “that has not been batched for human use, it has none of the limitations and fail-safes of what you and miss Shuri developed in Cairo.”
“It will be.  It will be amazing, the best, you always are.”  Tony murmurs, tracing his fingers over the tips of his ears which have gone hot and red with the praise.  Steve doesn't know how to respond to that. Not in a way that won't seem like he's fishing for compliments.  How could he be the best to Tony Stark? Most of the time he just feels clumsy, like a bull in a china shop, but Tony never complains, always seemingly delighted to have Steve under his hands; always telling him he's the best, that he's perfect and wonderful.  Steve takes a deep breath slipping his hands up from Tony's hips to cup his cheeks and bring him closer. “Steve, darling, what is it?”
He's on his knees in cargo hold just by a stack of Clint's ammo, Clenched in one hand is another arc reactor. It's wow. A lot bigger than Steve thought it was. He wonders how thick the chest plating of the armor must be, the dimensions look impossible. Over the comms his breathing sounds shattered, nothing like the relative calm Iron man has maintained up until this moment.
“What, I know you said no fish-man jokes but c’mon.”  Hawkeye held his arms out to the sky in mock supplication.  Iron man just sighed.
Tony manages to contain the little moan that threatens to slip out at the thought of Steve Rogers on his motorcycle, but it's a close thing.
“Just wanted you over here.”  He admits, turning to rub his face against Tony’s stomach, wrapping his arms around the lean compact body he dreams about probably way too often.
It's chaos, but it's organized chaos-and when Iron man flies down to stand at his back like a wall of metal and provide cover-well, Steve just breathes deep and lets himself feel alive. It turns out that joining the Avengers may be the only thing he's certain of in this world he's found himself in. That and that with all luck he will never have cause for Thor to smack him with that hammer. It looks terrifically painful.
“Yeah Steve, tell me about these thoughts, I'm all ears.” He says, waggling his eyebrows at Steve in a way he hopes is enticing. Steve frowns.
“Cap's old fashioned, nothing more old fashioned than a handy in the back of a car with your steady.” Steve says, in the voice he uses when he's fucking with the press.
“Nothing, nothing, they're still in merry old Brooklyn, right where they should be. Nothing to see here, now whassa matter, tell old Shellhead all about it.” He babbles, eager to change the subject as quickly as possible; Steve has enough things to be upset about without adding the loss of his home team.  He gets a suspicious glare for his efforts, but Steve seems to have bigger fish to fry.
“Can it parakeet boy, everyone better pay the piper with a smooch or it's bad luck. And to sweeten the deal you get a piece of candy per kiss.” Tony does a little spin for effect.  Clint's dancing pauses.
“Tony.” Rhodey's voice is soft and coaxing but he's not looking up.  “Tones, I love you, but you are
“Ooh really? Well, Captain America can't tell a lie, chop chop.” Tony says imperiously, indicating said underwear with a wave of his hand.
Steve dragged his mind away from that possibility, but just the passing thought of that, made him cry out loud enough he worried about being heard down the hall-and came all over himself.
“She told me her name is Shuri, wouldn't give me a last name. She said if her name ended up on a research paper her big brother would have kittens. She seemed to think that was hilarious though. Anyway, she's Wakandan and she helped me come up with
All of their work becomes needless when Hulk makes it to the scene; taking one look at The Gravitron and jumping up into the air to wrestle him to the ground. Gravity maps ripple, the focus of the distortion focusing on the Hulk, weighting he and the villain down, pavement cracks, but it's all over when Cap jumps into the fray-slogging through high gravity to knock Gravitron out with a painful looking shield strike to the head.
He slept well that night again, but woke some time just before dawn feeling overheated and lonely. His vision in the dark since the serum was fantastic, but it had sharpened, and seemed almost day-bright despite all the lights being off. Every scent around the room was sharper as well. He wondered where the team was, the urge to herd them into one spot where he could make sure they were safe, taken care of, and well fed seemed to be the most pressing thing imaginable. His own scent seemed far stronger to his own nose, strong enough that even someone unenhanced might catch a whiff from across the room. He hadn’t been expecting rut, his alpha cycle so soon, but it was very likely brought on by having close contact with an omega. He’d read about that happening before, and people joked that alphas would often sync to their omega partner’s heats. He wondered if maybe Tony was due for a heat, and-he forcibly tore his mind away from that thought, and stood up to pace around the room.
As he thought on it more, something dawned on him. Between the horrible drop after what happened with Amora and Executioner, and everything after, a matter of great importance slipped his mind. Zemo was still out there, running around free and a real and present danger to anyone unlucky enough to encounter him. There was no doubt in Steve’s mind, that the lousy sock faced bastard would turn up again like some kind of nasty fungus. He would put Steve’s team in danger, if he were allowed to plan unopposed until his trap could be sprung. Zemo could always be trusted to be too ambitious for his own good, and too spiteful to leave something alone even when his goose was cooked. He would attack the team again, and that was just unacceptable. He was one of Steve’s villains, and truth be told, he wanted nothing more than to take the rat bastard out himself.
“Mister Stark, he must be a real genius. I don't think even his old man could have dreamed this up.” He says, awestruck by the sheer brilliance of the technology surrounding them.  Iron man has gone stock still in the hall. Steve turns to look back at him. Are his hands shaking? Before Steve can apologize or ask if something is wrong, Iron man starts laughing.
before we were so rudely interrupted by tin man over there. There I was, hanging from a grappling hook off the side of the building-” Hawkeye spreads his hands out, clearly gearing up for a dramatic storytelling session.
“Yes sir, I promise I'll be careful. I'm sure Mister Stark appreciates having you to smack us around.”
“Tony, Tony, Tony, coming all the way out here to visit little old me, and you brought friends too; how much did you pay them to come with you?” Hammer sounds as nasal and slimy as ever.  Tony ignores him, nodding to Natasha, who passes him the leather folder.
“Hey! Don't waste food!.” Clint grabs the sausage off the floor, but loses it to Jan's quick fingers.
you, and I know you're a good man, a great man. One of these days you're gonna get your head out of your ass and tell the Avengers the truth, and they're all going to welcome your dumb ass in like you've always been there-because you
“Tony, oh God, baby no.” Steve says, and Tony can't even begin to compute that statement, holding onto the grab bar next to the toilet for dear life.  “I'm going to touch you, okay?” Steve says, all caution and worry, and affection that Tony can't possibly have earned.  Tony just groans, trying to stave off the nausea, the grab bar is cold against his clammy forehead. Warm hands stroke over his back in slow soothing circles, and Tony shudders. He feels rotten. As if something has climbed into his skin and made its home there. Sometimes he forgets what he used to be,
“Oh, someone's been taking care of the house making sure it's habitable. They must have been feeding a cat.” Rhodey's voice breaks Tony out of his contemplation of the empty bee boxes situated near one of the fences.
“Just think on it, you need not risk yourself needlessly when there are alternatives.” With that, Thor turns on his heel, nodding over to Natasha as he exits the room.
“Tis no fair competition, I know when I am bested good Captain-but perhaps I shall find some of yon sweets you spoke of in glowing tones.  What was it you spoke of?  Ah yes, Necco Wafers.” Thor says with a good natured smile over at Steve.  Tony tries not to stare at Steve like he's a madman.  Necco Wafers are
“C'mon babe, your chariot awaits.” Tony says, half out of the car as the armor peels away from him and rockets back towards the tower.
Iron man goes down to a knee, arm wrapped protectively around his own chest. Steve is at his side in an instant, but Iron man flaps a quelling hand in his direction.
“Wait.” Tony blinks in confusion at the three tablets stacked oh so neatly next to the bed. “Wait, what?”
“Bitter, bitter! I'll have you know-” The bickering reminds him so much of the Invaders that he can almost picture them all sitting around a fire taking playful potshots at each other.  Steve tries to move then, but all he manages is a sort of sad flailing motion with his right hand. That seems to be enough to get the attention of the people in the hall however, because the next thing he knows there are loud footsteps coming towards his bed.
Steve goes without comment, letting Tony walk him through the familiar process of dicing and boiling potatoes to make a mash.  They both busy themselves with their tasks; Tony with mixing garlic and fragrant spices in a pan with heavy cream. After that is heated he sets that aside and moves on to making the stew, and the room soon fills with the scent of browning meat and simmering vegetables.
“Um, guys” Peter all but squeaks.  They really need to work on his self confidence.  “Avengers I mean! Sorry, sorry-but he's giving a speech right now. Something about being lord of the carnival.”
“Alright then Stark, bring it.” Says Steve, crooking his finger at Tony in a way he knows will get the genius all in a huff. It works, and soon they're rolling across the mats, Tony using everything Steve and the others have taught him to put up more of a challenge than he ever has. Still, it doesn't take long before Steve has him down on his back. Most people would be offended by this, but Tony just laughs, delighted as ever by Steve's abilities. Only Tony would wear a smile on his face while Steve throws him around the gym. His tenacity and unwillingness to give up is one of the many things Steve can't get enough of.
“You smell like cookies.” Steve murmurs against the soft, sweet smelling strands.  Tony takes a pointed sip of his hot cocoa, biting the head off of a reindeer.
“Good, you're so good, just look at you, perfect.” Steve moans out, sounding awed and out of his head as he always does when Tony lets him do this.
We're near the end here everyone!  Next chapter is the big breakthrough for  our poor beleaguered Steve-depending on interest I might write an epilogue to this.  As ever, your comments bring me more joy than a sack of gold bars and sugar cookies.
“Yeah um. Well he thought that at the very least you deserved a proper burial. We didn't expect to find you alive. Which by the way, wow. Amazing, incredible. Stark is going to have an aneurysm.”
“Hi Steve, welcome back, how did it go, oh..” Tony gasps, because Steve has decided to answer by kissing him with such thorough focus that Tony contemplates offering to get on his knees. Or he would, if he didn't know Steve was so bent on this whole
“Oh my god, take your foreplay to the bedroom!” Clint calls, earning himself a smack on the back of the head from Jan.
It all came to a head one afternoon during an Avengers alert.  They were fighting two of Thor’s countrymen.  Amora the Enchantress, who was both beautiful and dangerous, and Executioner, who he guessed was there to cheer her on and punch things.  He supposed it was a job.
“That was gorgeous, darling.” Tony says warmly, slowly slipping the toy from Steve's body and tossing it somewhere. Steve has no idea where, his eyes are closed, and it doesn't seem important anyway.
“There's really nothing for it, you shouldn't worry about it.” Maybe he should be more concerned, but it's the price he pays for being who he is. There are worse things.
“No. No, not bad enough for that.” His mouth feels dry and disgusting. Water would be nice, but water means getting up out of bed. Tony squints over at the door to the bathroom where he knows there is a full pitcher.  “Gonna build a drone to bring me water.” He mutters, mentally counting to ten before swinging his legs over the side of the bed.
He lays in bed after that, staring up at the ceiling and knowing that sleep is unlikely to come tonight. The splint is as comfortable as it can be, despite the persistent healing ache that tells him the serum is definitely still working.
“What?”  He said, looking around quickly to see if there was an easy way to get around the car if he needed to.  Maybe he could climb a fire escape.  “Whaddya want from me?”
“Yeah man, you're a regular hussy.” Both of them are laughing now, and it feels so good to be talking to Rhodey that Tony almost forgets his earlier anxieties.
He felt for them though, as much as he didn’t want more omegas to be lost.  Steve knew what it was like, that desperate desire to fight and protect, only to be turned away because of how you were born, what it said on your medical records.  There would still be losses though, omegas that would slip through the cracks, or insist they be sent out, and if the war got desperate enough, they would be, and another generation might be lost.
“Okay, okay honey, you’re a mess.  I’m going to get you to bed and stop asking questions.”  He said, moving to pull away.  Steve held him fast for a moment, but then his efforts registered to Steve and he let go as quickly as the misfiring neurons in his brain would allow.
ready.” Tony moans, hips twisting when Steve curves his fingers to rub over his prostate, and Steve moans with him, drawing his fingers out at last.
he is. Their lives are dangerous, some villain might pop up to steal Tony away from him. It would kill him to lose Tony. Steve has given up a lot in this world. He woke up on what seemed like an alien planet after having lost seventy years, but there are some things he can't even think about without having to go down and destroy a punching bag or ten.
That explains the discomfort. He thinks with dawning horror, taking a deep breath to try and steady his nerves. Or he would, but the breath catches in his lungs shallowly, sending him into an abrupt coughing fit that leaves him wheezing, curled on his side. So that's a no on deep cathartic breaths then.
. This just keeps happening with Steve. He's never felt so needy with a lover before, if that's even what they are. Tony doesn't know what kind of label to give their relationship, but he does know that he wants Steve all over him, and not even in a purely sexual way. Steve apparently trips every single touch starved thought Tony has ever had in his life. He might be more upset about it Steve didn't treat cuddling Tony like his own personal mission in life.
Tony looked good as ever, in fine trousers and a waistcoat so fitted, Steve was not surprised to see it laced up the back when he went to get breakfast from the icebox.  It was a pretty daring choice for an alpha to wear, but Steve liked it, hell, he loved it.  The way it hugged his body, the way the trousers emphasized his lush rear and thighs.  Steve swallowed, hurriedly looking down, it was rude to stare, and ruder still to be sitting there panting after his friend while he was just trying to get himself breakfast.
hedges around important things he might have needed to know at one point. It doesn't seem to matter all that much though when they kick off their high heels and clamber into bed with him in just before the sun is coming up.
“Knew you were in town and I thought to myself, so am I. Just had to come out here and see what you've been getting up to. Building water treatment plants, Polio vaccines, medical tech, you sure have been busy. Hey Iron Man is here too, but you can skedaddle I need to talk to your boss now.” Hammer has really always had an incredibly overblown opinion of his own importance, but trying to shoo off a superhero is a new one.  Tony rolls his eyes so hard he wonders if they might fall out of his head. JARVIS elects to say nothing, staring at Hammer from over Tony's shoulder with what Tony can only describe as quiet menace. Hammer is undaunted though, because he is as ever a complete twit.
“Is that a new uniform? Is that a robot?” Steve asks, staring as both roll towards him-the latter chirping away gleefully and bobbing it's be-hatted pincer as it comes right up to him.
“Steve. Steven Grant Rogers, if you-if you get that fuc-darn song stuck in my head I'm divorcing you. I don't care how much you love Frozen.” Tony's grumbles.  Steve raises his eyebrows in response.
“Oh, right, New England.”  Tony said absently, Steve eyed his hands.  He was definitely counting cards.  Steve wondered if he even knew he was doing it.  The answer distracted him though, and he groaned.
“It almost got the arc, you would have been stuck then.” Steve says, patting over the armor as if somehow it will help him feel for injuries on the man within it.  Iron Man doesn't say anything, letting Steve pull him to his feet silently.
“That's for me to decide, for us to decide, and what you're suggesting is potential suicide.” Steve tries to reign himself in, but his voice rises like the tide of helpless anger within him.
True to his word, Steve is knocking on the blacked out lab doors a few hours later. Tony sets down his welding torch and strips his protective gloves off, zipping the leather welding jacket up to his neck once his hands are free. The arc is covered by a bulletproof half-vest that ends just under the bottom of his pectorals. Rhodey calls it his Iron crop top. Tony doesn't care, he loves crop tops. Rhodey just doesn't understand fashion. Still, he's not yet ready for Steve to see the lines of it beneath his ratty engineering tank, so the jacket stays closed.
“Steve, Steven, you mean to tell me you were out there in the wild,” he waved his hand around, he was looking red in the face, “corrupting the public with lust for your American icon body?” He sounded just a little hysterical.
“We watched a movie together, I got to cuddle you, which was really great. I want to do that some more soon if you'll let me. I thought it was a pretty nice date, but I'd like to take my fella out somewhere too.” One of these days Steve is really going to cause him to short circuit out of sheer confusion.  Tony stares at him utterly gobsmacked. His brain just doesn't ever seem to want to work right around Steve. This is not happening.
“Sorry Hap, come get Steve's motorcycle, sending you the location now, can't talk, gotta go.” He fires off rapidly, power walking over to an empty alley, waiting for his own ride. JARVIS does not disappoint. Within moments the armor lands, metal peeling back to let him in, and then closing up in a snug embrace. The armor's built in powercells dim on the screen as the Arc takes over all the heavy lifting.
Tony just can't deal with him. He wants to yell at Steve that this is about him too, to whine that this isn't the best he can do. There are expectations of what Tony Stark might be like in bed, and this is definitely not any of them. He's supposed to be making this good for Steve, supposed to be blowing his mind; so he'll stay, he has a reputation to uphold. A reputation Steve doesn't really seem interested in, he's looking at Tony, down at his spent cock and the mess on his hand as if it's the best thing he's ever seen, and Tony has the irrational urge to cover himself.
“Cap..Steve, talk to me, what can I do, can I help?” Iron man says, worry coloring every word.  Steve just focuses on breathing in and out. He's cold, breath leaving him in gasps that feel laced with frost. “Fuck, it's the train isn't it, shit I should have thought about that.”
“I know you were feeling...under the weather and I might be your CEO, but I'm also your friend. So if I want to remind you of your schedule then I will.” She says in a tone that brooks no argument.  Tony bites his lip, eyes glittering with some emotion before he squares his shoulders and locks it down tight. Steve wonders just how bad he's feeling, just how much he's hiding from all of them right now. His breathing sounds faintly raspy under the rapid fire stream of his words, and that minty smell still clings to him.
Steve doesn't know what to say to that.  Part of him wants to buck against it, to tell Tony he's being ridiculous, but another larger part wants to melt into that praise.  It feels so good to have Tony warm against his back, whispering honey sweet words into his ear, so good that he turns his face into the pillow in a futile attempt to hide the blush that must be everywhere by now.  Tony shifts down, pressing kisses against the back of his neck, his hand slips back beneath Steve's shirt to splay over his stomach, and Steve sighs out when deft, clever fingers rub there in circles.
“It's not that I don't think you can take care of yourself. That's...that's never been what I thought.” Steve's throat clicks on a swallow, Tony wonders if Steve's own heart is pounding away as rapidly as his is now. Distantly he can hear the sound of Happy playing really peppy music behind the divider.
Outside the weather was warm and pleasant. It was nice to just feel normal, to feel his body at rest, no rush or drop clouding his awareness. He set off from in front of the mansion at a nice clip, letting the repetitiveness of his steps calm him even further. He could feel eyes on him, but no one bothered him, there was sure a lot of honking though, he didn’t know what that was about, probably the red lights not changing quickly enough.
“Yep, I'm officially on my deathbed, grant me my dying wish?” Tony's eyes are fever bright, sparkling with desire and mischief. He arches beneath Steve, managing a slow roll of their bodies together despite having very little leverage, pinned beneath Steve as he is.
“It’s my private jet, it goes when we get there.”  Tony smiled winningly, sitting back on the bed, resting his palms on the covers.  The motion pulled his jacket sleeves up enough for Steve to see the cufflinks he’d given him glittering away there.  Steve swallowed, his cock gave an interested twitch in the sweatpants.  Steve bit the inside of his cheek hard enough to taste copper.  Tony was still speaking, completely oblivious to Steve’s inner turmoil.  “That is of course um, if you want to.  I realize I’m just kind of springing this on you.”  He laughed nervously, rising from the bed and taking a few steps toward the door.  “Sorry, I’ll go, this was dumb, nevermind me.”
“I just need three and then I win the big prize right?” Steve asks their sullen audience after demolishing the second row. She just stares at him, the star on his chest, the shield on his back, and then over at the armor. Tony gives her a jaunty little wave and she slumps, rummaging around in the back of the stand to produce a brand new giant banana plush. The heart eyes stare up at Tony when Steve shows it to him proudly.
“Jan is his favorite.” Widow says, jumping out of the way as Hulk goes charging by to tackle doom to the ground. Dirt and grass flies up everywhere, Doom's cry is loud in the park, Steve has a feeling their early morning workout will be coming to an end soon-no matter how much Doom is ranting to the contrary.
“We were out here because we were looking for you.” That gives him pause. Steve's head snaps up. The bed creaks with the weight of the armor. It must be reinforced-he thinks somewhat distantly.
“Okay, got it, you're not gonna tell me. Still, I'd like to help him get to a bed.” Steve tries not to think of that as an innuendo. It's a good thing Clint is not around to hear him saying stuff like that.
His ears burned more as he got out the nicest stationary they had.  A smooth cream colored cardstock with an illuminated border of gold and green swirls and swooping birds in vibrant colors.  It had been a present from Sarah on his twelfth birthday, and had surely cost her a pretty penny.  Steve’s hand shook as he poured his heart out onto the page in his neatest calligraphy.  When the letter was finished, he waited for it to dry, and sealed it with wax, tucking the bracelet inside the envelope with the letter.  His heart raced, he just knew his face had to be a glowing shade of scarlet, but he had done it, he’d really written it out, his intentions and his jumbled feelings.
Steve looks at him and everything falls into place, in a way it's always been there in some corner of his mind; but now in this moment it hits him like a wave of realization.
? Frequently? We made out like a pair of teens during the party a week ago, I don't know how else to show you I mean it. Even
For a moment it almost seems as if his bluff is going to be called, but instead Steve lets out a long breath and smiles crookedly. Strong arms enfold him into a tight hug, the closeness more than he deserves after all this, but Tony doesn't fight it. He melts into it immediately, resting his head on a broad shoulder, pressing quick grateful kisses to the juncture of Steve's neck and jaw.
“Whaddya want me to tell him to get him to help?”  The chief asked, already nodding to people off-screen.
Steve gets a bunch of different flavors in truly impressive quantities. He covers them in toppings, looking increasingly gleeful about the amount of sugar he's about to inhale. Tony chooses coconut-a little inside joke with himself, but also he really does like the taste of the stuff.
“Sure, of course, but I get to pick.” Steve squeezes him once more, tightly enough to make Tony wheeze and smack at his back with a laugh.
“Hang on tight Tony.” Steve says, kicking the bike to life with a loud rumble of the powerful engine. Tony could have installed a push button start, but he knows Steve, so old fashioned kick start it had been.
“Can I come in?” Steve sounds almost hesitant. Tony's eyebrows raise in surprise, but he nods, stepping aside and cueing JARVIS to open the door for them both. Once they're inside Steve turns to him, gaze serious. Tony has a moment of panic that something in their silly fight in the living room has upset Steve, but that worry is soon gone with Steve's next words.
He lectures himself sternly. Weird, his self lecturer voice sounds a lot like Rhodey. Still he supposes a few lascivious thoughts aren't
“We'll help you decorate it. That's a big tree, wouldn't want you to have to do it all alone.”  He says, offering tony an encouraging smile. Tony's smile in return is brilliant, and Steve holds his arms out, motioning his favorite fella down. He gets his wish, and an armful of warm snuggly genius when Tony jumps into his arms a few ladder steps from the bottom. Catching him takes barely any effort at all, and is completely worth it when he gets a tight hug for his heroics.  “Good morning Tony.” He murmurs, setting Tony down and kissing his cheek. Tony flushes a little, darting in to give him one in return.
“Are we ready?” Rhodey asks, when the last of the suitcases in the room is neatly zipped and locked.
The game went on, but he didn’t let go of Tony’s hand until the halftime show began.  The Patriots cheerleaders were down on the field performing impressively, one of the guys had just thrown a tiny woman high into the air when the ground rumbled ominously.
JARVIS stays with him as he navigates the constant conversations, hand shaking and ass kissing that always goes on at these functions. It's nice to have friends at one of these things, Rhodey couldn't make it, and Pepper is in Tokyo for a week. He misses them but they have lives of their own, no matter how much it makes Tony want to take his private jet and pop up at their hotel rooms. He's a mature adult man, he doesn't need constant attention and validation.
It was a decidedly bad idea. Swimming through the dark-that he recalls. His head on someone's knees while they yelled for him; blue eyes wide and terrified.
“No um.  Iron Man wasn't here, he's investigating something for me."  Tony is aware that he sounds anything but convincing, but Steve is just nodding as if it's not a flimsy as hell excuse.  And Tony just can't control himself, the guilt and shame of his secrets eating at him until it just spills out.  "What if I was lying to you-” Tony whispers “-about something big? Would that-would that change the way you feel about me?”
“Everything alright?”  Steve asked.  Tony, shot him a little half smile and sat on the bed, leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees.  Steve wondered if it would be wholly improper to ask him to roll around on the blanket so it would smell like him again.  He knew it was an unacceptable thought, but his hindbrain sure thought it sounded brilliant.
He still misses the past terribly. There are nights he wakes in a cold sweat, gasping for breath and reaching for things he will never get back, but Tony is always there to welcome him back-to gentle him down from memories that make him ache with loss.
“How close are we to land anyway? I'd go up and see myself but the barometric pressure keeps changing topside and it makes for bad flying weather.” Says the voice of a woman. Flying weather? English though, that's a good sign he's not in Hydra's clutches.
Giant Man was holding a slim panel of glass, holding it up to the scene around them, it looked like he had the police chief on the line. “We’ve tried everything, from acetone to industrial grade solvents, I’m sure we can figure something out, but the Brooklyn Bridge can’t be out of commission for weeks or months.”  He said, and Jan buzzed up next to him, growing back to her normal size.
“Am I in trouble?”  Steve asked, as the notion that maybe he’d broken some law with all of his applications.  Steve didn’t care, it was a dumb law, if they planned on locking him up for trying to serve.  He’d tell it to the judge.
Tony hates this guy already. How dare he name himself after Tony's favorite carnival ride? Maybe it's just based upon simple centripetal force-acceleration and curved paths, and orthogonal directions, but tony
Eventually he makes it out to the garden. It's a cool night, just edging on too cold, but Tony needs out of the gala for a little while. The air smells like flowers. He remembers his mother planting night blooming Jasmine all over the place here and smiles. Music floats out from inside the hotel, but Tony pays it no mind; walking through the garden paths and sipping his drink slowly-only to be stopped by JARVIS grabbing his arm and stepping smoothly in front of him.
“Oh I'm not falling for that Tony, banana innuendos were around in my day too.” Steve looks a little red around the ears. Tony rolls his eyes, his heart squeezing troublingly with how much he loves this man.
After he left, Steve wondered if Tony had started wearing a new cologne.  Beneath the typical scent of his lab, he’d smelled sweeter than usual, like he’d been chewing on a cube of brown sugar.  It was unusual for an alpha to smell sweet, really, but Tony Stark was
The hand rubs there for a long quiet moment before stilling-as if registering suddenly that he's being carried. Tony's head comes up. Wide terrified eyes meet his, and Tony leans back in his arms, bracing his hands against Steve's shoulders. It takes a surprising amount of strength not to fumble his hold.
Steve is still thrumming with his post battle high, the fight had been over pitiable quickly. Turkey boy -or whatever his name was-had gone down like a wet sack of feathers after one very pulled punch from Captain Marvel.
He stayed in the training room long after Clint and Natasha left, working on the agility course and then strapping weights to himself to climb the rock wall near the back.  He lost track of time until the growling of his stomach sent him on the search for food.
Tony blinks intensely, closing his eyes and swallowing thickly to hide the way his eyes may have gone just a little bit wet with Rhodey's whole I love you speech. Tony feels nauseous, undeserving. He takes a sip of his drink instead of finding a nice couch to hide under for the foreseeable future.
As much as the torture in Afghanistan had fucked him up, that's not what haunts his nightmares the most. Torturers gonna torture, and terrorists gonna terrorize. He reasons. These things are expected. Sure it was awful, and most days Tony takes surprisingly fast showers for a guy with more than one sunken tub in his mansion; but none of what the ten rings did to him was shocking.
“He has been speaking of giving you heelies, but I believe that was not a serious consideration. Ah, perhaps you may ask him yourself, he requires your assistance in the tower living room.” JARVIS says, pulling his attention away from a box of paints sitting on his dresser that definitely were not there before.
over the desk.” Steve is proud of the frankness of his own voice, even if he feels the tips of his ears warm. Tony lifts his head, eyes wide as he gapes at him, setting his phone aside, and sliding further up his body to press their lips together in a slow lingering kiss.
“Well I like him. I mean, gosh, the stuff he makes is just amazing, and he's so busy all the time. It's amazing he has the time to even do little things for the Avengers, but he does, and it's always incredible-” What follows is a long and surprisingly through examination of all of Tony's recent innovations and philanthropic work.  Tony is dead, this is it, this is his dying vision: Standing in a kitchen drinking a smoothie and having Steve Rogers talk about how great he is.
So he drags himself up off the floor and gets back to work. The holograms fly back over to him, and he swipes through them. Staring at the math until it blurs, until his hands ache from trying new variables, new ways to look at this problem. Bullet wounds, scars that won't heal, limbs taken by landmines with his fucking name on them-Tony can fix this. The nanites are stable, but people they really don't like the idea of stuff living on in their body.
When they get to the compound Bucky is there, standing between them and the entrance to the building. Another ghost Steve can't forget, but at least he's alive. Still, Steve feels the breath freeze in his chest painfully when Bucky steps close.
“Indeed I’m sure you can, but Anthony insists, and I shan’t deny him.  He makes the most dreadful faces when unhappy, you see.”  Jarvis’ eyes sparkled fondly.  He seemed more like a father figure to Tony than a butler, if Steve really thought about it.  No one ever spoke of Tony’s old man, he wondered what that was about.
“Iron Man, I need to talk to you.” Captain America is using his 'this is official important business' voice.  Tony very carefully extricates the straw from his mouth and sets it, and his smoothie on the counter.
“Well I figured you wouldn't want to try this right in front of the windows shellhead.” Steve still sounds a little shaky, so Tony steps closer, reaching up to stroke his thumb over Steve's cheek, then down to rest both of his hands on Steve's broad chest.
“Hey stars and stripes, stop fondling the armor and hear me out-” Clint sounds amused. At some point he's acquired corn dogs from the vendor inside his perching spot. Tony stares at the curly haired teen inside who has apparently decided the excitement is over and has gone back to working the deep fryer. Tony is amazed. That kind of unflappability is impressive.  He wonders if they would like to work at S.I..
“You know me so well, go get some rest Shellhead, get yourself checked over too.” Steve grits his teeth to keep from saying more, to pull him back and beg him to strip out of the armor so Steve can run his hands all over him, just to make sure he's whole and alright-but he doesn't, he turns away and takes a shower so scalding hot it almost makes him forget about cold mountain air and the clattering of wheels over train tracks.
“Oh, honey.”  Tony smiles, but gamely lets Steve shift him over to the side and crawl off the bed.  “You're absolutely delicious, I don't know what you're talking about, but if it makes you feel better, I'll be right here, not going anywhere.”  Tony sprawls back on the bed invitingly, posing like a centerfold. Steve feels his resolve waver, but drags himself towards the bathroom anyway.
“That would imply I'm ashamed of anything birdboy.” Tony punctuates the statement by wrapping his legs around Steve's waist while leering in Clint's general direction.  “Now you should leave before you get an eyeful of me sullying the innocence of a national icon.”
“Gosh Tony, we didn’t have indoor heating in the forties, we just put hot rocks in our beds.”  He said earnestly.  Tony pursed his lips, but he was clearly trying not to laugh.  His eyes sparkled.
Three hours later he jerks awake to the sound of sirens going off. He's half sprawled over a lab table, sheets of plans sticking to his face when he raises his head.
“What, can’t a mother have an opinion these days?”  Her eyes sparkled in a way Steve hadn’t seen since she had become bedridden.  Steve swallowed, closing his eyes and trying to burn that image into his mind.  The way she looked when she smiled, when she called the guy that turned up at their door selling snake oil a crackpot and a quack.
“Just my hands, my bad circulation, it happens.” Tony tries for levity, but Steve's brow furrows with concern, and before he knows it they're both standing again.
Steve doesn't want to put him down. He wants to sit in the bed and just hold him close, stroke his hair, soothe the bruises he knows hide beneath the well tailored lines of his suit-but that's not right. Tony didn't ask for that, and Steve's not going to do anything without getting permission first. Besides, he needs to court Tony properly before even thinking of getting into a bed with him-late night guilty fantasies notwithstanding.
“Darling, my darling, you are so lovely.  I don't think anyone knows how much, but I do.”  Tony murmurs against his ear, and Steve flushes hot, something warm and fluttering spinning out in his stomach when Tony drops kisses over his cheek, his red, red ear, and his neck.
Once Steve leaves, Tony presses a hand to his mouth, fingers tracing over the places he swears he can feel the impression of Steve's kisses etched there like a hot aching tattoo.
Some warnings for panic attacks here, and there's a scene where someone throws up, so please be aware-here there be angst.
in private. Surely those freakishly large mutated arms of yours are good for something other than ruining my beautiful plans.” Steve looks down at his own arms critically, before shaking his head. He must be desperate if he's even entertaining this ridiculous conversation.
“Yeah well I don't like to assume.” Says Steve, helping Tony flatten the sleeping bag out over the cushion beneath it.
” He shudders, slipping his hand away from Tony's chest to grab at the thigh wrapped around his waist-pushing it up and to the side so he can settle closer, feel the evidence that Tony wants him just as badly as he's always hoped. Tony is staring up at him with shock, and it's not every day Steve gets to see a super genius thrown for a loop.
“I like a lot of things Steve, and I'll like anything you like probably, unless it involves um.” Tony licks his suddenly dry lips “Blindfolds, I used to really like them, but I-I can't now. Being tied up, that kind of thing, used to love it.” Tony has been on both sides of the experience, both the one doing the tying, and the one tied up, he hates that it's just one more thing his kidnapping stole from him.  He wishes he were stronger.
needing help, and if anyone has anything to say about it they can come talk to me.” Tony is getting all worked up into a rant, Steve can hear it in his voice, feel it in the way his shoulders square. The little guy he used to be, and the scrappy bastard he
“You are still shivering, stop whining Stark.” Anyone else might balk at having the Black Widow approaching them in a semi menacing fashion, but Tony just looks nonplussed.
“Hands up, sparkles,”  Iron man said, hovering just behind Steve, his palms pointed towards Amora with the repulsors a bright glowing blue.  Amora shrieked in response, magic ballooning forth from her in an explosion like a dam breaking.  Steve jumped up to shield Tony, but was caught up by him instead, the jet boots carrying them up in a steep ascent that made Steve very glad he’d not eaten soup for breakfast.  “God I hate magic.”  Tony said over the comms.
Tony was scarce for the next two weeks, but still showed up for movie night.  He was curled in the center of Natasha, Clint and Jan, eating a sandwich when Steve walked in to join them.  The lettuce slid out of the sandwich and down onto Clint’s face, where it was pillowed on his thigh.  “Oh my God.”  He said.  Clint ate the lettuce.  Tony ignored him, staring over at Steve with wide eyes.
“Follow me then, handsome, let's go to bed.”  He breathes against Steve's cheek, steering him towards the staircase as he speaks.  Steve goes without complaint, letting Tony steal a few kisses as they make their way up the steps, and stealing a few of his own in return.  Tony's arm is strong around his waist, sure and steady, and Steve turns into him when they make it into the bedroom, slipping his hands up to cup Tony's face between broad warm palms.  Tony's blue, blue eyes are just visible beneath the dark fan of his lashes, but they drift shut when Steve pulls him in for a kiss. God can Tony kiss, it's always so incredible. Like a match striking flame, hot and consuming but still so so sweet, as if kissing Steve really is taking all of his concentration.
“This is something I didn't know about you, I'm a little surprised, thought you were an open book.” Steve knows he still sounds shaky, but Tony doesn't comment on it, laughing instead and taking Steve by the shoulders to give him a very unimpressed look.
“You caught me, soon I'll have my own pair of rocket powered roller-skates, just you wait.” Steve says, raising Tony's hands to drop a kiss over his knuckles. Tony stills as Steve follows that with a kiss for each of his wrists, watching Tony's eyes drop shut in a slow blink with the gesture.
“God,” He gasps, when Tony spreads his thighs wide and pulls his knees up, quirking an eyebrow at Steve as he does.
Steve blinked, he was starting to feel sleepy, the good kind of tired, where the thought of a warm comfortable thing to lay down on sounded like the best thing in the world.  Tony was an omega, his gorgeous, amazing teammate and secret crush was an omega.  “I don’t know,”  He half slurred out, “since the forties, never had an omega touch me, anyway.”  That came out fully slurred.  Tony swore under his breath.
Tony is half sprawled across the kitchen table fast asleep. His cheek rests atop one of his ever present tablets, he's wearing the remains of his suit from this morning, only the shirt and pants are still on, the rest of it is probably in one of his shiny flivvers. A half eaten bowl of Linguine and pesto chicken has gone cold where it was obviously set aside to make room for more tablets. Several coffee cups are in various places around the room, as if Tony had been up and pacing-forgetting them there. Math is scrawled across the glass surface of the table-the culprit guiltily indicted by the dry erase marker still clutched in Tony's hand.
"We need someone like you, the world that is, us, who wouldn't need Captain America?" Iron Man says, and Steve can feel himself flush a little at how certain he sounds. "People never stopped looking for you, and Mister Stark was hoping even if you weren't uh.” Iron man trails off then uncertainly. This isn't the first time the name 'Stark' has popped up. He knows they're not talking about Howard. Howard is long dead, this must be the man's son. Still, it's nice to know at least one tie to his old life has survived. Even if Howard Stark had never much seemed like the kind of guy that should have had kids.
“Oh yeah, good one, definitely do not interrupt coffee time. Also watch your step, he falls asleep in weird places.” It's obvious Wasp considers Mister Stark a friend, but there doesn't seem to be anything but platonic affection there.
“I sure hope so, only I don’t really know how to start, never done this before.  I’ve read about it but,”  He shrugged helplessly.  Julia nodded, he could hear chains clinking, the sound of things rolling around in cases.
“Sure thing Shellhead, but I like you all the time.” Steve knows Tony won't take him seriously, but that won't stop him from trying.  Sure enough, Tony looks away, a soft self deprecating laugh falling from his lips as he gets to his feet.
, he wants to say, but the words choke in his throat. He feels lost, forgotten and ghostly, wrapped in a watery burial shroud. For a moment there is nothing, only silence, as if even the wind in his dreams has forgotten to whisper. Steve feels his chest ache, some pang he cannot name, but then their eyes meet. It's a lance to the heart. Like coming alive again, like the first gasp of air after diving too deeply. The thread that has been connecting them through time and destiny seems to pull taut. I've found you, He thinks, even as they reach for each other and fail to touch.
“No, you know-do you think he'd like one of these prizes?” Steve looks so earnest, as if the thought of showing up empty handed is not an option. Despite his height and general supersoldier everything, sometimes Tony can really tell Steve used to be the kind of guy no one looked twice at.
“Why are you all so hot and sad?” Tony asks before he can stop himself.  That startles a laugh out of the woman holding his hand though so maybe it's not the end of the world.
Business contracts, he wanted them, contracts Stark Industries had, technology we had too. He had some wild scheme he wanted me to be part of.  Me being someone he wanted to fuck just made the deal sweeter.” Tony says it with such matter of factness that Steve feels his blood boil anew. “Probably, I don't know-Steve, ease up a little would you?”
“Don't. Do not sacrifice yourself for me. If ever there's a choice between you and me Shellhead, you better not choose me.” In the light of the hall Steve feels the eyeslits boring into him like a physical touch. Iron Man is silent for a moment before speaking again.
“Well hi, hi there, aren't you just a beautiful girl.” Tony murmurs, carefully reaching out so she can sniff his hand-an action that is deemed acceptable, if the cat butting her head against his hand is anything to go by. Tony pets between the pointed triangles of her ears and smiles.
It was a fast fight, but no less furious in its intensity.  Steve found himself falling in easily with these strange new allies.  They were brave, intelligent, moving with an experience with each other which spoke of their bonds being green, but still tested and true.  In the end, he knocked Namor’s diamond hard head with the shield hard enough to make his eyes roll.  Their eyes had met, and recognition had shown.  Namor had some choice words for him, but Steve knew him well enough to know when he was being thanked.  Steve had a feeling whoever had mind controlled Namor into attacking them was about to be in a world of hurt.
Tony thinks fondly.  “I believe he is particularly suited to the task sir. He has spent extensive time in the public eye, and he has displayed a particular disdain for your detractors. Both of which make him an excellent candidate as a long term partner.”
“Love...Beloved, going to come, going to-” His words trail off into a sound of pleasure so intense it seems almost painful when Steve bites down onto his shoulder, grinding against his prostate and stroking his cock in tight corkscrewing motions; and then he's coming, clenching around Steve's cock and bucking against the hold around his wrists; eyes wide and stunned as streaks his own chest with his release. That's it for Steve too, watching Tony come apart beneath him is better than anything his half fevered imaginings have ever come up with, and he's grinding in deep, kissing Tony's panting mouth and coming so hard his vision spots around the edges.
“He requested my assistance in transporting you to your bed. If I might say so it was quite, as you put it-It was sweet.”
They had lost a generation of omegas to the combined forces of the great war and the Spanish Flu, and they were been rare to begin with.  Everyone had hoped the peace would last, that maybe their numbers would recover, but the person in line ahead of him smelled a little like vanilla cookies, sweet, heady, and wrapped in spice.  A young omega, just as young as Steve himself.  Steve knew they would not be allowed out on the battlefield, no matter how much they wanted to fight.  He knew they would likely be held back, too valuable to be sent out on the front lines, if they were allowed to join up at all.
” Tony grits out no sooner than Steve has put the lube within easy reach and stepped up behind him, the playfulness before draining away into something just shy of desperate.
He slept less than two hours that night, in the morning he knew he looked rough, but Tony didn’t comment, for which he was grateful.  It seemed they were both leaving some things undiscussed.
“I'm just gonna go boss, you two kids have fun.” Happy says, climbing out of the car as he speaks. Tony waggles his eyebrows after Happy's retreating back and then crawls right up into Steve's lap again.
He tried to sleep, but found he could not.  His mind was racing, and his body was not yet ready to rest.  He’d been asleep for decades, that made sense, and he was afraid, if he really examined the feeling.  He was afraid if he closed his eyes another seventy years would pass, and then where would he be?  Steve shivered, throwing off the blankets and getting out of bed.  There was nothing for it, he would have to tire himself out.  He put his boots back on, mentally apologizing for their less than optimal state.  He’d have to get some new ones, he felt like a little kid tracking mud across a fine Persian rug at this rate.
Natasha is waiting for him when he makes it into his office in the penthouse atop S.I.'s Manhattan headquarters. The reinforced catsuit zipped all the way up to her neck, and the downward tilt at the corners of her lips tells Tony this isn't a courtesy call. He eyes the leather-bound binder on his desk warily, coming to rest his hip against the dark wood. These things are somehow worse if he's sitting down; he prefers to get bad news standing up anyway.
“Shaddup, you know I love shepherd’s pie.” Steve sets the nuts aside, wiping his hands against a towel folded up next to the cutting board.
“It's not the forties anymore Steve, and anyway it's no one's business but yours if you need to find someone to talk to after all the shit you've survived. No one could possibly fault you for needing help, for
“I thought we could stay here, make dinner together, catch a few movies, just relax.” Tony turns toward him, glance uncertain as he too slips his shoes off. “Does that sound like something you would enjoy?” Tony steps a little closer, lashes dipping as he looks up at Steve.
Steve watches him and realizes that for the first time in a week he feels well and truly relaxed. The ever present tension that makes his body thrum with barely contained agitation is gone, and it's gone because of Tony. Tony with his sweet words and his endless desire to please, and his shocking thoughtfulness. Tony who has halted in his progress towards the Stove because Steve has been staring at him, utterly gobsmacked and silent for the last few moments. He doesn't look like a billionaire right now. He looks soft, attractively rumpled, and at home in his warm slippers and half open shirt.
As it turned out, lying about his age didn’t seem to help matters any.  He was still turned away, his health records doing more against him than any forged age marker could.  All the while, the war in Europe waged on.  Steve read all the papers, saw the devastation in pictures of a bombed London, tales of horrible scenes witnessed by fleeing refugees, and waited for congress to finally join up.  He worked out harder than ever with Lorenzo, on some days Mia came down and helped with his form too.  He was starting to get real good at speaking Italian too, good enough to get his cheeks pinched by the tiny stooped nonna that visited the De Rossis every weekend for gossip and espresso.  She critiqued his accent at first, but lately she had nothing but praise.  Steve felt unaccountably proud when he’d greeted her last, and she exclaimed in approval, she was a tough critic, and a shark at cards, Steve couldn’t have asked for a better bellwether for his linguistic success.
Hammer is in an orange SHIELD issue jumpsuit, looking far too chipper for a man whose company is coming apart at the seams. He watches their progress with a sly little smile, but Tony's eyes are sharp enough to catch the tiny tremor right at the corner of his lips when he catches sight of the armor.
Moments after handing the phone back over Tony gets the text. Steve has drawn little hearts around the banana. The caption reads 'It's Banan-a long day, hope to see you soon.'
“They're mine, give them back.” He hisses, uncaring of the alarm bells this person's presence is setting off.
“Stop sassing me, I have watches wherever I like.”  Tony sauntered a little closer to Steve, he wondered how he did that, fully armored as he was.  It was sure nice to look at though.  “See you soon.”  He said, dropping his voice lower, only for Steve’s ears.  Steve felt himself turn a little red, beside him at the table, Natasha piled his plate with food, she didn’t say anything, but she looked a little worried.
“Hit the nail on the head, mister.  You don't have to though; I know you were busy before I came in.” The last thing he wants to do is impose, but Tony just hums, nuzzling into his hand and casting a look up at Steve through his lashes.
“La petite mort, I can get behind it.” Steve pants, shocking Tony entirely by reaching between their bodies' to cup Tony through his pants with one hand.
Captain America carrying him to bed? Tony is torn. On the one hand, wow, childhood fantasy come true. On the other hand, Tony does not do well with people touching him while he sleeps. That is an understatement. Thor tried to move him once, and he'd apparently gotten an elbow to the soft parts. Tony winces.
She screamed as it hit her, clearly not expecting Steve to strike out at something wearing Bucky’s face.  The rushing in his ears grew stronger, he caught the shield on the rebound.  All at once New York City was back, or forward, depending on how you looked at it.  There were helicopters up in the sky, beside him the wind kicked up, and Thor landed just as Amora got to her feet.  He could hear Giant Man over the comms making short work of Executioner.
“Tony, it's okay, just focus on breathing, it's okay.” The tall red head in the sky high heels is there suddenly-Cinnamon? Her name is something spicy, he knows it, if he could just
“Your pacemaker-” Steve says suddenly. “You rubbed your chest a lot while you were sleeping. Does it bother you?”
“Nothing appears to be amiss sir.” JARVIS says after a short silence. Tony looks over the results, scanning over information as quickly as possible. Everything looks in order. “However, the handwriting matches that of Tiberius Stone. Would you like me to notify The Avengers
Two days later he was in the kitchen, finishing his third peanut butter and jelly sandwich when Tony walked in chatting away to Natasha.  He only caught the tail end of the discussion, but it sounded like they were talking about medical terminology.  Steve couldn’t make heads or tails of it, but it sounded like it wasn’t any of his business as it was.
“Well.” He growls, biting at Tony's lips. “I have the red covered, seemed appropriate, underwear's real uncomfortable though sweetheart I don't know how you stand it.”
“We know, it's kind of sad.” She says, patting his hand consolingly.  Steve sighs, shaking his head, but gamely going back inside to stand just behind the ladder. Tony is in a pair of green leggings covered in candy canes, a red sweater with tiny red and green versions of his shield, and a headband with reindeer antlers. He should look silly, and he does, but Steve finds the getup endearing.
'.  “No. No that doesn't work on me anymore. Tell the truth. And if you tell me that the truth only involves you banging Captain America like a screen door in a hurricane I will fly over there just to tell you in person that you're a liar.” So serious, that's Rhodey's command voice. Tony feels mildly accomplished at having been enough of a wreck to bring that out of storage.
“Aw,”  He said, he wasn’t sure about that at all, but he was glad someone thought so.  “I’m not exactly an ace choice, but he seems to like me alright anyway.”
“It’s alright son, you’ve done marvelously, you can relax now.”  She wove her way over, her steps short and measured.  There was a little pin on her blouse now, she was air force.  Steve felt like his world was sliding a little sideways.  What in the blue blazes was going on?
“That's good, because he disappeared right around the incident with Hammer. Without him, we're out a huge puzzle piece.” Natasha is all business, but there's no hiding the pinched expression of concern turning her lips down. “Would he respond if you contacted him?” The question makes Steve's blood run cold.
“If he doesn't talk, Widow will take over, but we thought you should try and get the jerk to spill his guts first.” Jan's Wasp costume looks particularly shiny today. Tony wonders if she added a fresh coating of color reflective cells to it. Everyone is looking at him, including Steve. It becomes obvious to him that they're all waiting for something, and Tony feels a strange foreign realization steal over him like a wave. They all want to come with him, they really
“Are too.” Two can play at the stubborn game. “They're actually really good, why are you such a hater?” Tony says, fighting the urge to laugh when Steve narrows his eyes as Tony takes a particularly loud drink from the straw. “Here, taste it.” To Tony's surprise, Steve takes the shake, bringing it to his lips and taking a cautious sip from the glass. He starts sputtering immediately.
statement of a gift, it practically laid out that you wanted to bond, the only thing more like a proposal was a handfasting silk.
“Is something the matter Captain?” Their resident Asgardian sounds far too pleased with himself.  Steve glances up, and Thor winks, sitting back to take a bite of his food, smiling as he chews and looking so damn smug that Steve has to roll his eyes. Tony settles back in next to him, yawning and stealing a hashbrown from Steve's plate.
“Oh, honey, you're so hard, that is delicious.” Tony all but purrs, but he's taking his hand away a moment later, crawling back and making room for himself between Steve's knees. “Here, help me get your pants off so I can get a taste.” Tony hooks his fingers in the waistband of his pajamas, and Steve helps him, shifting around and tugging at the material until it slips off, and Tony slings the pants across the room.
“You are-you are ridiculous.” Tony murmurs, and Steve just hums, tugging on his tie again, pulling slightly this time with more force.
“You are shivering Captain.”  Steve's eyes snap open at JARVIS' soft words.  “Would you like me to raise the temperature?”
“Don't start Jay, now is not the time.” Will it ever really be the time? Tony doesn't know, but he can keep putting it off at any rate.
Steve takes his hand away from where it's braced against the wall, grabbing Tony's chin and tipping his head back. Tony's pupils are blown, a dark flush across his cheeks. Steve drags his thumb over kiss reddened lips, watching Tony's eyes flutter closed in clear expectation of another kiss-and Steve gives it to him, burying his fingers in Tony's hair, and slanting their mouths together again. It's hotter this time, dirtier with Tony giving just as good as he gets; strong fingers winding into Steve's hair to pull until Steve growls and nips at Tony's lips warningly.
Update:  There WILL be an epilogue once I finish ch.10 of my longfic, thank you all for your words of encouragement!
Steve dreams of blue eyes first-not his own blue, these are more aqua to his cornflower, with long black eyelashes, wide, and beautiful, and they are everything. He dreams of the rasp of facial hair along his cheek, quick hands, the smell of metal and an insatiable curiosity. Tall buildings-so tall they make the empire state herself seem shy by comparison. He sits in his sickbed, frail, wracked with cough and fever and wonders how such a thing could be.
“Capitan! You are out of your mind, a nice warm bed is in your future!” Barton says with all the subtlety of a crowbar.  Steve can't help but like the guy.  He gets the feeling Hawkeye and subtlety only mix during battles.
“Oh yeah, real titan in the industry, but you'd know that wouldn't you Tony?” Hammer continues talking, his voice grating over Tony's nerves like nails on a chalkboard.  Tony stares into his glass, watching the amber liquid melt the ice-changes in states of matter, transference of energy, the melting point of gold titanium alloy-anything to avoid really thinking about this conversation.  “Real shame what happened to him.” Hammer says, nodding solemnly.
“I-is it, Is it good?” Steve just barely manages to get the words out. Tony feels amazing, so hot inside, clutching at his cock, all sleek heat and God he feels perfect. That doesn't matter though, not if Tony doesn't like it, he'll do something; pull out and suck him off, or use his fingers, his girlfriends' had always liked his fingers at least, that he can do. Tony interrupts his train of thought though, tossing his head back and grinding against Steve's cock with a decadent moan. His hand travels up, wraps around his own cock and gives it a stroke. Precome makes a shining trail over the clenched lines of Tony's abdominals as he strokes himself slow and languid; the way he does when it's more for Steve's benefit than is own.
“I do, and you love me too.” He also grants several of their mutual wishes that night. What can Steve say, he's always been weak for Tony Stark.
“I was thinking about what Natasha said. That's what the meeting is about tomorrow, but I uh..didn't want to spring this on you.” Steve says sheepishly. There's a flush working across his cheeks, but he still squares his shoulders, meeting Tony's wide eyes with his own.
“I'm ready, and I've got you at my side, right?” Steve's nervous little smile ought to come with a warning.  Tony swallows, squeezing Steve's hands reassuringly.
“I just wanted to spend some time alone with you, I've been working, been gone too much lately.” Tony says, wriggling around in the blankets to look up at him. Steve shakes his head, setting the mug of tea down on the coffee table and pulling Tony up onto his lap, blankets and all.
it even, but he's self aware enough to realize how many times he's traded the act for the intimacy that follows. That cavernous emptiness in him that craves love and affection; he's been tossing it scraps for years. Steve is here now though, spelling out something that feels a lot like love with every action, kissing him and cherishing him despite everything in Tony that says he can never deserve this. When they part for air again, Steve shifts them around so Tony's laying half sprawled atop him.  “Let me take care of you sweetheart. Wanna take you on dates, show you off, make 'em all jealous.”
“Christ Rogers, way to give it to me.” Tony sounds breathless, reaching back to pat over Steve's hair almost soothingly.
“Not silly, I always want you to tell me when you want things. Do you even know how hot it is when you look at me like you can't get enough?” Tony's voice has gone deeper, dropping an octave as he whispers encouragement against Steve's lips. “You want me so badly, don't you darling, tell me about it, I can't go again, but you can, c'mon baby.”
“You're sure?” Steve is looking into the faceplate intently, as if he could glean more truth from it by doing so. “There's no one hurting him?” The 'no one I can punch' seems implied. Tony allows himself to feel a little warm at the thought of Steve jumping in a time machine and punching some of his bad decisions.
“Steve, hold that thought, God, I'm sorry. Natasha made an appointment with me at five, sounded important.” Tony should have remembered earlier, but well, he was a little distracted.  Steve sits back, but doesn't protest when Tony slips off his lap to slink off into his walk-in closet.
“Yeah, I know you would, but don't. SHIELD has him now and they're keeping him for a long while.” It's a pleasant thought, if anything it will make parties easier to deal with, knowing Justin Hammer won't be able to make an appearance.  Steve sets him down once they reach the kitchen, hugging him close for a moment before releasing him into the wilds of the kitchen. Tony wanders over to the coffee maker to fix himself a mug of his favorite elixir of life. It's quiet in the room; the only sounds the metallic clink of his spoon on the ceramic cup, and the ping of Tony's emails going off in the pocket of his leggings.
Tony blinks, then blinks again when Steve slides down to lay atop him, a soft little sound of surprise escaping his lips when it brings their hips into contact.  “Oh, oh I thought...I thought you were just-” He breaks off clutching Steve close by the shoulders, and throwing one leg around his hip when Steve nuzzles his chin and kisses over the prominent arch of his cheekbone.
“Of course,” Tony sounds so soft, almost awed. He slips up closer, kisses a path over Steve's hips, up to his mouth. “I like everything about you. My good boy, my sweet Steve.”
The pale blue lights from the screen reflect in the futuristic looking lenses Tony has perched on his nose. Tony explained them earlier, along with the nifty little device spanning the palm of his flailing hand. Something about tactile holograms and their application to finding weak points in submerged structures. Steve had been fascinated, but what's new? Steve knows he has been in a near constant state of
“Tones, what's wrong, when's the last time you got some sleep?” He starts in without even pausing for breath. Tony feels something tight unclench in his chest. He knows it's alright to call Rhodey when he really needs it, but some part of him always expects to be slapped down even after all these years.
. Tony settles on grabbing a discarded band t-shirt off the bed and tugging it over his head instead. Steve averts his eyes, cheeks pinking. Huh. So, scars and crop tops are definitely not a turn off then.
“Captain Rogers-” JARVIS says hesitantly.  “Sir was asking after you earlier, he heard of your predicament and was deeply concerned. It would seem you are not currently asleep so I thought it acceptable to bring to your attention.” JARVIS hasn't finished speaking before Steve is sitting up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed and rising to his feet.
“It's not that big.” He finally mutters, feeling his cheeks burning. Tony turns in his arms so they're face to face, sliding his palms over his chest. One dark brow quirks upwards. Steve feels his doom approaching maybe just a little bit.
“Steve, honey, that's-that's Shh, Steve baby, it's okay-” Tony soothes, combing his fingers through Steve's hair, brushing his fingertips over his brows, his cheeks, the bridge of his nose. It's such a gentle touch, so full of concern that Steve shuts his eyes tightly, clutching Tony as closely as he can.
“If I didn't I'm sure there's a reason, but don't worry, not looking into that.” He murmurs, curling up against Pepper where she's spooned up behind him. Natasha's knees slot between his, her expression relaxing as she scrapes her fingernails over his scalp gently. The last thing he hears before falling asleep is Natasha's quietly whispered
Dr. Erskine arrived shortly after sundown, and with him came even more confusion.  He was being shipped back to New York, he’d been chosen.  There had been a terrible sinking moment when Steve thought he failed somehow, that his landlord was right after all.  Dr. Erskine assured him that was not the case, and that he would explain further back at headquarters.
SHIELD is bustling with activity when they get there. Agents run this way and that, whispering to each other and looking through files in little groups. The whole setup reminds Tony of an ant colony. He supposes that would make Fury the queen. Tony shakes his head, ant queen Nick Fury is not a thought he wants pinging around in his brain. Ever. No matter how cute Disney tried to make the ant queen in A Bug's Life-and thank you very much Steve for reminding him of the existence of that movie-no matter how cute that was, real natural biology is rarely so adorable, in insects, at any rate. He's getting side tracked though, their guide through SHIELD's maze-like bowels is still talking, and Tony has heard all of it, but it doesn't seem all that interesting. Especially with Steve standing directly to his left like a sentinel. Natasha is at his right; the others fanning out behind him in a show of support so imposing that he swears he's seen a few agents backflip into side rooms to get out of the way.
“I want a long time then, possibly a life sentence.” Tony mumbles, turning into the touch.  Steve hums as if he's thinking it over, running his other hand over the dip in Tony's spine in small soothing circles.
“M'tired, you're tired, where's the bed?”  Steve says, reaching out to run his fingers through Tony's hair, tousling it up into a gorgeous mess.  Tony's smile morphs into something real then. He shivers, and gets an arm around Steve's waist, stretching up to drop a kiss on his cheek.
“Steve, Cap, please don't go all Brooklyn bruiser on Justin Hammer. The guy's built like balsa wood, you would snap him like a twig.” It's not that Tony has any qualms about punching Hammer himself, but Steve would probably feel bad if he seriously hurt the moron.  Steve grunts, urging Tony to settle against him once more.
“I could walk you guys home, this isn’t a real prime place to be after hours.” Steve squared his shoulders, tried to make himself look broader and more like the big six kind of fella he watched in the movies.  An alpha they could trust to get them home all in one piece.
“Tony.” He says; amused, aroused, and exasperated all at once. “Tony, I've been flirting with you nearly since we met.” He pauses, unsticking one of his hands from the mats to stroke over Tony's cheek. Wide brown eyes stare up at him, guileless for once with utter disbelief.  “I like for you to sit with me during movie nights. Been cuddling you during them for the last few months.” He narrows his eyes, leaning down to press their foreheads together. “I greet you with a good morning kiss on the cheek Tony. I...we go on
Tony drummed his fingers on the desk, biting his bottom lip and shaking his head. Steve couldn’t help but notice he was wearing the cufflinks. “Sorry, I uh, wasn’t expecting you to pick up so quickly. I just noticed um, that the quinjet was missing, and so was my favorite hero in red white and blue…”
“What, Tony, how?” It was a lot to take in, the thought of getting some of his past back. He stumbled over to sit on his bed, and Tony followed, sitting next to him.
“Well, I could make you my kept man, then you could be just Steve Rogers all the time, but you won't let me buy you presents.” He's not pouting, he's
“Not much to sully here.” Steve says with a shrug when Clint gapes at them both. Clint's eyes get a little wider when Steve's hands migrate south to cup Tony's backside and give a good squeeze. Someone has a
Tony takes a snowball narrowly missing their vantage point as a sign, going off to put on warmer clothes. Steve follows him inside soon after when JARVIS informs him that Tony is on the first floor waiting for him.
Steve fills his water bottle, capping it and then setting it on the counter before slowly making his way over to Tony. He stands at his side for just a moment, considering how to approach this before JARVIS quietly breaks the silence.
“Gets lonely sometimes, round this time of year. You made it good. For all of us I think.” He says, indicating Clint and Natasha's cuddling forms. Both of them look warm and content swathed in an oversized red blanket decorated with Iron Man's faceplate.
“No hammer shall ever best mine.” Thor says proudly, hefting his prize up to the sun, his golden mane blowing majestically in the wind. Tony winces. Now he's definitely going to be replacing at least one attraction here, even though they're all obviously rigged.
“Oh,” He says dumbly, arousal pooling hot in his gut with just the suggestion of what Tony is doing.
right, and wow. Wow. Tony would like to write a letter of thanks to the committee responsible for passing out anatomy.
“Steve, this isn't, it's not just about me, tell me what you like, anything you like, I'll-I'll do it, I want to make you happy too.” He realizes he's getting a little worked up here, but he can't help it. Most people have been all too happy to let Tony run the show so to speak, but Steve just continuously leaves him guessing.
“Big mistake, Mole Man.”  Iron Man said, holding out his repulsored palms.  Steve threw the shield at a few straggling Moloids trying to sneak up on the armor.  Mole man sneered, pulling up some kind of long gun-like apparatus and pointing it at Steve, where he stood on the field.  “Bigger mistake.”  Iron man dropped his palms, his chest lit up blue.
Steve, just fine. Just a momentary lapse, I'm good now.” He's not-not entirely, but it's enough for now. Enough, with Steve crowding him up against the counter and holding him close, stroking his hair. Enough when the other Avengers trickle into the kitchen, and Carol shows him today's news headline detailing the massive info leak of all of Hammer's shady business dealings. JARVIS has apparently been
“What! Why would he-” Steve thinks about that, thinks about every time he's given Tony a compliment only to have it turned around into something self deprecating, or deflected into losing its meaning. He thinks of the way Tony looks at him, a way he doesn't look at anyone else. It used to be a sort of reverence reserved for pictures in history books, now it's-
“Have you-” Steve rasps out, clearing his throat and trying again. “Have you been waiting long?” He asks, and he can't help it, he reaches up, tracing his fingers over the base of the plug. Tony is lube-wet around it, the skin silky and hot. He gasps at the touch, hips tilting up in wordless invitation.
“You're not doing anything wrong. Tony has what we call a lasagna of trust issues and self loathing so deep you might need a archaeological dig crew to break the surface.” Under other circumstance the wording might have made Steve laugh, but now it just makes him slump even further into his chair. “I probably shouldn't tell you this but I am so
“Don't apologize.” Tony says, pressing his hand over Steve's mouth before he can even get a word out. “Don't. It's not your fault, it's
He's never touched Tony like this, never put his fingers inside him.  Always too worried it would hurt, that Tony wouldn't like it. Tony is asking him to, no,
“Stark industries-The Maria Stark Foundation is holding a fundraising gala to funnel money into clean water services for communities around the globe.  We will match any donations made to the foundation through S.I., I'm not an Avenger, but I like to think I can make some kind of difference-it doesn't make up for what I-” Tony stops when Steve reaches out to tip his chin up so their eyes meet.
“Well if I'm showing off then we can't hold hands while we skate. You think of that ?” He feels that Tony would call this a well reasoned argument.  Tony's cheeks pink endearingly and he shoots a glare in Steve's direction but it lacks any real heat.
“Don't. You're...you're Captain America, the world spins on without me, but it needs you Winghead. Needs you more than me.” Steve is struck again with the powerful desire to find the people who made Tony feel so low about himself and seeing about introducing them to his fists. He knows it's a hollow sentiment, and too late at that, but it's still a satisfying fantasy.
“Oh, is this-” Tony touches over the links of a fine silver chain, clearly not standard military issue. “Is this real...is this really your-” The chain pools in the red silk of the bag with one singular dog tag hanging from it.
“Might I direct you to the bouquet approximately three steps to your right and ten steps forward. The one with the red Camellias and orange roses.”
It's also wrong. The thought breaks through his lust fogged mental exclamations with all the force of a battering ram. Steve doesn't want him like this. Tony has never been the kind of guy to take advantage of another person. Tony likes his partners explicitly willing and enthusiastic. Steve is a friend, his
“Disregarding how wrong you are, and how much I do not care about the press and what they have to say about you-when you look at him what do
That was where Tony found him, sometime after midnight.  He was still partially in his suit, but his ritzy dress shoes were off and in their place was a pair of bunny slippers.  He shuffled over, dropping into the seat across from Steve and pushing a deck of cards towards him.
“Course I do, just c'mere, closer.” He whispers, urging Tony to scoot up and sit on his lap to whisper armor specs and frighteningly advanced tech ideas into Steve's ear. Half way into the explanation Tony starts rubbing at his own hands, shaking them out, and twisting them together in a clear expression of soreness.  “Keep talking, you need these in working order hand them over.”
He pushes away though, nodding to Steve and slinking down to the workshop to be alone with his thoughts. When he walks in he has JARVIS cue up the video of him slapping the piss out of Justin Hammer. He emails it to Pepper and Rhodey, then he gets to work.
such an honor to be inside him like this, for Tony to let him, to want this from him, God, he's so lucky. Tony's body is so hot too, so warm where they touch, and soft and slick, perfect around his cock, hotter there, holding him so snugly it's only through sheer force of will he hasn't come yet. Tony hasn't told him to come yet though, and he wants to hold off, for Tony to come first, the way he asked for, to watch his face go lax and ecstatic with pleasure; yes, he wants that now more than anything.
“Why is Doom sad for you? Are you dying?” Tony says, having apparently decided to return to Steve's side.
No, non lo sono, la nonna era uno squalo e lo sei anche tu.-No I'm not, Nonna was a shark, and so are you.
“Usually three or four if I uh-have really good inspiration.” Steve says, feeling mildly embarrassed by the admission.  His refractory period since the serum took effect has been the source of a lot of frustration.  Tony looks more than a little impressed, but also more than a little smug.
“Shame on me for letting you feel anything but warm and toasty again.” Tony says with a light laugh.  He saunters over, the corners of his eyes crinkling when Steve catches his wrist no sooner than he’s come into range.  He doesn’t say anything, merely sighing when Steve rubs his fingers over the smooth skin of his wrist. “What is it darling, what do you need?”  He murmurs, lifting his free hand to scratch his fingers over Steve’s scalp lightly. It’s all he can do not to purr, it feels so good; that light careful touch.
“I'll go if you think it's a good idea, I trust your judgment shel-sweetheart” He corrects himself instantly, relief sweeping through him when Tony seemingly doesn't catch his telling slip of the tongue.
“Two reindeer per penguin Captain Handsome. Don't be cheap.” He says, holding up his hand and making a beckoning gesture.  Steve huffs out a laugh, passing over two reindeer cookies and getting one penguin in return. Tony settles against him after that, methodically working his way through more cookies than he's ever seen their usually health conscious co-leader eat. Steve smiles at Tony when he's caught looking, leaning in to rub his nose over Tony's hair.
“Hulk trying to sleep, be quiet!” Comes the sudden bellow, both of them jump. Steve hears the other Avengers hissing various invectives at Hulk, but it's too late, the moment is broken.
“What, we're married? Well that's unexpected but not entirely out of the realm of possibilities since I do think you're way too attractive, actually all three of you are scary hot, and wow I said that out loud.” Cap looks like he doesn't know how to react to that statement, but his cheeks turn a pretty endearing shade of pink beneath his blue cowl.
“Just, don't watch okay. I'm going to try to do this as quickly as possible. JARVIS, throw up those scans please.” Iron Man is making a concerted effort to sound sure of himself, Steve wishes he had more faith in the trust Steve has for him, but the man is almost as stubborn as he is.  Steve closes his eyes, steeling himself for what is to come. Iron Man is shifting around beside him, cutting the sleeve of his uniform off with warm precise laser-light. He feels terrible about ruining the suit, but something tells him Tony has other concerns on his mind right now. The air smells cold, damp and green, when he takes a deep breath in it tastes of pinesap and resin. Above them in the trees the birds are utterly silent. Steve has a moment to register the oddity of that, and then strong gauntleted hands are pulling on his arm, aligning the bone with quick efficient motions. He doesn't know the sound he makes but it clearly distresses Iron Man deeply. He apologizes profusely, quickly moving to lock the splint in place. Steve groans, knocking his head back against the tree and gritting his teeth.
He shivers, pulling Steve closer, a short moan escaping him when Steve lets one of his own slip. They part and then return seamlessly, one kiss becoming many. It's so easy to kiss Steve and be kissed in return-as if they've always been here, doing this. Tony can feel his heart pounding in his chest, rabbiting away as Steve sits down on the couch behind them. They break for just a moment, before Steve kisses him again, pulling Tony down atop his lap inexorably, his arms tight around Tony's waist.
“Hey.” Tony huffs, poking him in the side. “Hey I didn't say that was a bad thing, lift up a little bit-” He says, coaxing Steve to shift atop him.
“Walk of shame already?” Comes a voice from behind them.  Steve's mouth stills against his, and Tony groans, tilting his head back to glare at the person standing in the doorway.
“You do, but it's okay if you can't tell me anything.” In the video the two little girls offer Tony colorful bags with pencils and little knickknacks. Tony takes them with a joyous laugh as if he's not a multi-billionaire, as if he doesn't routinely carry around pens that cost as much as some cars.
“Tones, what have you gotten yourself into now.” Rhodey murmurs almost to himself. Tony huffs, dropping the comforter from around his shoulders to return the hug one armed. His cocoa runs the risk of spilling, but hugging his friend-his
His contemplation of the odd little device Stark had called a phone is interrupted by a hesitant knocking at the door. When he opens it Stark is there, he looks nervous and sheepish. Steve is surprised a man like Tony Stark can even feel anxiety. Captains of industry are usually terribly sure of themselves. Here with it being just the two of them, Steve is struck with the sudden urge to draw the bright gleam of his eyes. Steve blinks, stepping back to let him into the room, feeling suddenly oafish standing by this beautifully suited man in the waning light of dusk.
“There is still a lot I’m learning to let go of, Steve, but we’re a team.” She smiled, just a small upward curve of her lips, private and delicate. “I had to learn it too,” She looked down, her lovely green eyes fixing on some point on the floor, “that I’m not alone.”
“Will you uh..will you sit with me? Kind of chilly tonight.  I know you don't like the cold much and neither do I, makes my skin itch.” The thought of being so close to Tony, wrapped up in a blanket and surrounded by pillows is about the most comforting thing his mind has come up with since getting on that damned train. Steve feels something miserable and unpleasant unknot and fade away as he slips behind Tony, mindful not to lay on his injured arm. The pillows are soft and warm beneath him, but not as warm as the man curling into his arms. Tony sighs quietly, turning to face him and tucking his head up under Steve's chin. He plucks at the fabric of Steve's shirt, breathing into the scant space between their bodies.
“Oh fuck yes, Steve!” Tony wails, toes curling when Steve presses three fingers into his wet hole and works him in time with his mouth; hollowing his cheeks as he sucks and spreading his fingers wide. Tony doesn't last long with that treatment. He's white knuckling the edge of the desk, head tossed back, cursing up a blue streak that would have made the commandos blush. One of his heels is pressing almost uncomfortably into Steve's back, but it's worth it when Tony falls back on the desk, throws a hand over his face and comes with a shout so loud Steve is once again thankful they're alone. Steve sucks him through it, pulling back and giving his cock a little kiss. Tony just lays there sprawled across the desk, he's staring up at the ceiling, eyes glassy and mouth slack.
“Careful, I might just keep it.” Tony says, rubbing his hands over the warm buttery leather.  Steve smiles with satisfaction-as if that was the plan all along. Tony feels like he might have been played.
“Okay, count on me, I’ll get it back for you ma'am.”  Steve said, making sure the woman sat before taking off at a sprint in the direction of the two fleeing men.  They hadn’t gotten far, seemingly thinking no one planned on chasing them down.  Steve felt anger course through him as they ran into an alleyway.  How dare they, how dare they attack someone like that, someone that obviously had no way of defending themselves.  His lungs burned, but he didn’t slow down until he was face to face with the two goons.
“You ransoming me now?” Steve says, but he crawls up on the bed and leans in, trapping Tony beneath him where he's bundled in the covers. Tony wriggles his other arm out from beneath them and pulls Steve down. The first touch of their lips is soft, and it stays that way, presses of their mouths between shared breaths. Steve sinks down over him, tracking kisses over his cheeks, his jaw, the bridge of his nose, and then back to his mouth. Tony feels hot beneath the covers, burning up, just from the way Steve feels over him, kissing him like this.
“Uh, Steve, I think. I think we're here.” Tony says more than a little breathlessly.  Steve sits up, looking out the window to the the cheerful signage of Tony's favorite coffee shop.
“I'm not, I would never...I don't want to hurt him. He-I think he's really special and I want to-I want to show him that. Want to treat him right.  I'm just-really bad at this.” He says, frustration coloring his words. Rhodes' face softens a little at that, but he seems determined to say his piece regardless.
They didn’t speak about it however, that Steve was looking worse and worse, even though his performance on the field never suffered, and he still spoke to the press with the smile he’d worn in the old film reels.
Steve is silent for a moment, just rubbing his thumbs over the tiny scars on Tony's knuckles. How they came to be there is a mystery to him, but he's obviously the sort of guy that works with his hands.
“You're Captain America. You're allowed to have a bad day. Or a bad month, or a bad whatever. You're the biggest hero that ever lived, but that probably doesn't mean jack shit to you right now does it?” It's so odd that the person comforting him the most is encased in metal, but Steve will take what he can get right now.
“Still up?” Steve asks, Tony jumps slightly, levering himself up on the pillows to blink tiredly over at where he stands in the doorway.
He can't think much after that, lost in the way Tony has begun bouncing atop him, the clutch of his body, the glitter of his eyes, the way he pulls and pinches Steve's nipples.  Tony is making sounds too, soft gasps and low pitched whines. Those sounds; the sounds of Tony's enjoyment, the thought that he's making Tony feel good-he wants that, for Tony to keep moaning, to ride him and come all his over chest maybe; that would be incredible.
“God I hate magic, and wizards, and summoned shit.” Tony grumbles. JARVIS begins playing Lord of The Rings on one of his side displays.
“Are you happy?”  Steve asks, before he can think too hard on why he shouldn’t ask.  “With me, are you, are you happy?”
“Tony, I'm gonna put you in your bed now. Don't know how comfortable you'll be though in that suit.” He coaxes.  Tony doesn't respond, merely snuffling closer, tucking himself up tightly against Steve and sighing contentedly.
Afterwards he flew Steve back to the mansion in a thrilling, spiraling flight that left him breathless and laughing.  “We’ll have to practice that, maybe I can put some special grip compartments on the armor for you.”  Tony said, letting the helmet recede once more.  Steve laughed, feeling lighter than he had all week.
“Please. Please yes, touch me, touch me all over, anywhere you want, I need it, want you” His voice cracks with desperation but he doesn't let that stop him “-want it so bad.” Tony feels like maybe he should feel more concerned about how quickly he's losing it, but it doesn't matter, not with Steve looking at him like
“I don't know what you're doing, but you need to-need to stop. What's your angle, what do you want from me why are you
That night when he finally drags himself into his room the events of the day are almost enough to distract him from the vast empty space of the bed. Logically he knows the room temperature sits at a comfortable level. Logically he knows with the serum there is no real reason for him to be cold, but cold he is. Holding a warm sleepy person in his arms seems to have broken the dam, and he wants, wants
“Nope, had a smoothie, I'm all good, and if I eat any more carbs I'm going back to sleep. Not all of us are supersoldiers. I work hard for this bod, so many squats, you don't even know.”  Tony grumbles, glaring around the table as if affronted by all the superhero metabolisms surrounding him.  Steve resists the urge to glance down at the body in question.  He stares enough as it is.
“Well James, welcome to the Invaders, can't say we'll help you find her, but we could always use someone with a fighting spirit.” There is a part of him that balks at someone so young joining the team, but he himself is young, and this war has younger soldiers, younger casualties. He remembers what it was like to be sent away, to be told he couldn't fight, that he was too young, too weak, too sickly. He will not do the same here now.
"Yeah.” His voice sounds harsh even to his own ears, but Jan just looks happy for him. “Yeah they're from Steve.” Then he's laughing, burying his face in the blooms; Forget Me Nots, pink Camellias, Chamomile and Iris. God, he's so fucked he can't even bring himself to be upset about it.
The twenty fourth rolls around more quickly than Steve anticipated. The villains have been more active than usual, and Steve has been thrown at Tony so many times that the armor now has a Fetch Cap protocol-Steve knows that's what it's called, he's heard Tony talking about it to JARVIS. Tony seems unconcerned by all of this however; thoroughly decking the tower out in more decorations than Steve has ever seen. It's impressive, as are the ridiculous hats he passes out to the Avengers after using their communicators to call them all down to one of the common areas.
“You're such a dork, I swear, fucked my soul out of socket and then you say shit like that.” Tony grumbles against Steve's lips.
“Paste Pot Pete, he’s the only one we think can help, we wouldn’t ask otherwise.”  Jan made her already expressive eyes wider, imploring the guy to see it her way.  It clearly seemed to work, he sighed, steepling his fingers in front of himself, ready to capitulate.  Steve had not been around for the whole Paste Pot Pete debacle, but Wasp and the others seemed confident the former villain would be able to provide something with the ability to dissolve Adhesive X.
Later he sits in a ruined bar, emptiness clawing at him as surely as any knife wound. Peggy puts a hand on his shoulder but he feels carved out of glass. Numbness is better than horror he supposes, but Bucky was one of the people he'd counted on coming out of this war no matter what.
It all fades away far too soon, but Steve dreams of him again, and again. Sometimes he is standing beside him as a silent sentinel, watching slim shoulders bow beneath the words of a man who must be his father. He is a dark shape, smoky and swirling with seething words and reeking of drink. He longs to wrap his arms around his soulmate, to comfort him and tell him the poisonous words spewed at him are not true, cannot be true. Steve knows his soulmate, knows his soul, knows the incredible brilliance of his mind, and he knows with unshakable certainty that his soulmate is better, and more, so much more than the man trying to mold him into something unrecognizable.
Tony is everything he's ever wanted, and everything he never knew he wanted all in one fascinating and sometimes infuriating package. He loves him, he wants him, and it all seems doomed because for all Tony flirts, he seems utterly unable to understand that when Steve flirts back it's in the utmost sincerity. Steve
“No one expects you to just bounce back, Steve, no one expects you not to grieve.”  Tony reached out hesitantly, rested his hand on Steve’s shoulder, the way he had in the armor, but his unarmored hand was even warmer through the thick sweatshirt material.  “You’ve lost so much, but I’d like to, to try to make this alien planet feel like home again.  Or we, me, us, the team, we can try.”  He flushed, looked down, went to take his hand away.  Steve reached up, curled his palm around Tony’s elbow and held him there.  Beneath his thumb, through Tony’s shirt, Steve felt his pulse jump into a tripping beat.
“You've been holding out on me Steven.” He grouses, pointing at Steve accusingly. “But I have decided to let that slide because I am benevolent and understanding.” He says in his best impersonation of their friendly neighborhood Atlantean.  Steve snorts in response, sitting up on the couch and winding him in to stand between his spread knees.
“You got it sweetheart, anything you want.” Steve says, his laughter full of joy and relief. He takes the necklace from Tony's hand, undoing the clasp and settling the thin chain around his neck. His fingers brush along Tony's neck, warm fleeting sensations that make Tony shiver. He stays still though, sucks his bottom lip between his teeth, letting Steve settle it to his liking. When it's good and in place Tony poses a little bit, watching Steve's eyes darken with no small amount of satisfaction.
At times like these when he's stuck, his mind drifts back to Stane. Always so encouraging when Tony hit a snag. Always ready to do anything Tony needed to get him through that push of innovation. He wonders how much of was fake, how much was just the figurative dollar signs he could see all over Tony. Itemized like a prize racehorse, and just as ready to put him down when he was no longer useful. Tony wonders sometimes if Obie had ever meant anything he said. He wonders if any of his indulgent smiles and warm hugs were ever sincere. Betrayal is something Tony always expects, but with Obie he didn't see it coming until the man ripped his heart out in every sense of the word.
“Let him in Jay.” A moment later the doors whoosh open, and in comes Steve Rogers himself. Is he holding a silver tray? How did he get into a shirt that tight? Is that pomade in his hair? So many questions. Tony just barely keeps his eyes from bugging.
Tony kisses him again, and continues to kiss him until they're in the shower beneath the warm comforting spray of his truly excessive shower heads.  They stay in there for an indulgent amount of time, tumbling back into bed together once they're reasonably dry. Tony cuddles close, offering no resistance when Steve curls around him and traps him against his body.
Tony just can't deal with that.  “Steve are you out of your mind?” He mutters, grabbing Steve by the front of his uniforms and planting a kiss on him that they both feel in their toes.  “I love it, I love your gifts okay. You could give me a fucking-” Tony flails for words, stealing another kiss when Steve seems at a loss too. “Singing fish. You could give me one of those stupid singing fish and I would still love it. Because it's from
“Mister Stark will return at Eleven in the morning sharp in five days' time.” Steve nods, getting to his feet and rolling through a few quick stretches. Five days is enough time to plan his first move. He might never have been good at talking to people he was sweet on, but you can't fail if you never try, and Tony, well he's worth trying for.
“Thor let me have a bite of that Froyo stuff he was eating. It was really good, I thought we could go get some.” He trails off when Tony just stares.  “I can choose something different, we don't have to-it just seemed..”
“I'll have you know I can be very convincing. I am the King of Convincing, the Imperator of Impressive.” Tony informs him with mock haughtiness.  Steve just raises his eyebrows.
Back in the room, there was a neatly folded stack of clothes with a little note atop them written in sharp geometric print.  “
Opening the door out into the hallway, there was a thick envelope made of an odd crinkly white material resting in front of his door.  Steve picked it up and tore open the package along the perforated line.  A ticket to the football game he and Tony discussed the night prior fell out, along with a cottony wristband emblazoned with a hawk, and a note with one of Tony’s little Iron Man stick figures.  He was giving a thumbs up, and a little speech bubble above him said
“You have known what it is to be weak, and you will not forget what a privilege it is to be strong.” Erskine reached over, squeezed Steve’s shoulder.  “That is why I have chosen you, not because you are a good soldier, or a strong alpha, but because you are a good man.”
“We did.” Tony whispers, eyes fluttering shut when Steve wraps him in a tight hug with one arm, and curls his free-hand in the dogtags around Tony's neck. It's gratifying to know he never took them off, even when they were apart.
Tony can't even say anything to that. His mouth is open against the pillow, hand spasming in Steve's grip. Then Steve does it
“I'm decorating, Steven, unless-” Tony pauses, fixing Steve with a contemplative glance, but Steve beats him to the punch.
And Steve would have gotten over it, I don't know where you're getting that he loves m-” The elbow jabbing into his side momentarily knocks the wind out of him. Before he can get his wheezing under control, the door to his office is sliding open to reveal all of the Avengers currently in the tower in fresh gear. Ah, so that's what the elbowing was about, they have company.  “Um.” He says, rate of blinking increasing when Nat passes him off to Steve. “Hello? Are we having family night and no one told me? I didn't think it was my turn to pick the movie?”
Everything after that is a blur. Then he crashes a plane into icy water and doesn't hear much of anything for a long long time. Later they will ask him if he dreamed while he was frozen, and he will tell them there was only blackness, but that is a lie. Deep in the dark he dreams of falling endlessly in silence.
He spent the following few hours organizing his things. There wasn’t a whole lot, but he got it all sorted and set up to his satisfaction. The room seemed warmer, less empty after he was done. For years during the war, there was no home, and after Sarah passed, even his drafty lower east side apartment felt far too empty. This was his chance, here with Tony, the team, the mansion, he could build a life there, in the present.
Thor's spaghetti is surprisingly good. So is how the man looks in a pair of oven mitts. Jan shows him the picture she snapped. He supposes Asgardian warrior Princes probably look majestic no matter what. When he informs Thor of his opinion he receives an extra meatball.
“Give it a whirl Dummy, strut your stuff.” The robot has a tiny plush shield strapped to its side, Steve's shield.
Inside the house is well kept and cozy. Big windows in the kitchen let in long bands of golden sunlight. A window-seat takes up another wall. Built in bookshelves packed with books line the walls of the living room. The whole house is stocked for various different hobbies; one room holds an easel, art supplies, a violin, and what looks like a vintage piano. Another houses boxes upon boxes of craft supplies for everything from knitting to train sets. There are two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a detached garage that's almost bigger than the house itself. Tony stays in there for an hour, finally getting to reunite with the trio of bots he knows are his. They whir and click in a way that can only be described as excited; crowding around him to seemingly check him over for injuries. The biggest one, Dum-e rests his pincered claw atop Tony's head.
