Stefanus opens the flap and pulls out a large bronze disk, the design on the face of it made of concentric rings painted to match his gladiatorial armor surrounding an inlaid star on the raised center.
Hadrianus considered a politically-motivated munera as pandering to the masses. He had even gone so far as to call Caesar’s famous munus of sixteen years prior an embarrassment, an unnecessarily elaborate largesse, especially considering the rumors swirling around the man’s excessive debt.  He preferred to run a clean campaign instead… by bribing every family of consequence and influence, of course.
Michelle finishes lighting up then taps the pack until she loosens a fresh one to hold out to Steve. He accepts, and she flicks on her lighter underneath as he breathes in, allowing the end to catch.
“Stank! There’s a Tim Dugan on the phone for you,” one of Tony’s floor-mates calls from the hallway phone booth.
As slaves, Steve and Bucky are going to be referred to as “boy” by other characters throughout the fic, regardless of their actual age. In Ancient Rome, a puer (boy) referred to either free male children or male slaves of any age. A slave was never considered a “real man” (vir) and would be referred to as “puer” (boy) as they age.
“Sorry to disappoint, ma’am, but I’d prefer to be alone.” He takes a sip of his drink, being sure to flash the gold band on his left hand. “I’m on my honeymoon.”
Cap’s eyes are drawn to his stomach, and Tony bristles under the scrutiny. “Are you… are you pregnant?” he finally asks, cutting to the meat of the matter.
It is an attractive vase, but very expensive for something Stefanus is so used to seeing as utilitarian in everyday life, containing everything from wine to oil to fruits. “I think it might be overpriced?”
“Bacchus is renting a small apartment close to the arena. He works as arbiter of the games when he can and an assistant trainer when he can’t,” Stefanus explains, his eyes lighting up when he speaks of his lover(?).
Tony’s expression is unreadable before it shifts to a sort of glibness that seemed to be his default whenever Steve was trying to be serious. “Well darling, have you packed your footlocker with the essentials for the honeymoon or should I have a barrel of lube delivered directly to our suite? I assume we can forgo the condoms now that we’re hitched.”
Dracula hums, flicks his hand to look at his talons. “And if I had meant it, you would be dead,” he states matter-of-factly. “It is a long drive back to your abode. You and Anthony will spend the night here. In separate bedrooms of course. I am what you would call a ‘night person,’ and I will be keeping watch.”
The following Monday, Steve pours himself a cup of coffee – black, no cream, no sugar – from the communal pot in the Triskelion break room before heading out to his meeting with Director Fury to discuss his upcoming mission. It’s a welcome distraction, the opportunity to be useful, to be sent out to the field once again after all that time spent lying low, not to mention all the psychological evaluations where the shrink treated Steve like he was nuts, like he is no longer fit to do the job. If he couldn’t hack it anymore… Captain America is all Steve has left, his commitment to the patriotic ideal the only thing that kept him going these days. Besides, who else were they going to get to fill his shoes? Thor? The man had no loyalty to any nation in this realm, much less the good old U.S. of A.
“There you are, Antony,” Iovianus says, hurrying him along. “Come, come, you should be at the very front of the procession.”
Suibne bristles beside him and turns away resolutely, digging his spoon into his rations and nearly inhaling the contents so as to be allowed to leave the mess hall faster.
Steve is about to follow when Dracula attempts to shut the door in his face, only to be stopped by Steve’s foot in the door and arm braced in front of himself to stop it from breaking his nose.
Steve gives him an odd look, his brows drawn together. “Don’t you have to return to MIT eventually?”
It’s a long road to recovery, and Tony is just at the trail head really. As a result, he’s uncomfortable with what he feels is unearned praise. “So, enough about me; how’re you and Carol?”
As a reminder, Tiberius Stone is Tiberius Servilius Priscus Structus. He is Pierce’s nephew. The Servilii gens were a very powerful, prestigious patrician family that later had plebian branches. The branch of the family with the cognomen Priscii (meaning “antique”) remained patricians and often carried the agnomen Structus. They continued to have great influence through the Republic and into the Imperial period. All that is to say that Ty is of a significantly higher social rank compared to Tony, though they may be equal in wealth.
“Nonsense,” Antony replies, waving off his concern. “You can wear it to the lecture halls, be the envy of the students and faculty both.”
The boy’s dark hair is long and softly curled while his chin and chest remain smooth, though with that muscle mass Stefanus suspects he’s older than he’s presenting himself to be, having been depilated rather than possessing the natural hairlessness of early adolescence. The boy winks in his direction, and Bacchus holds his cup aloft in acknowledgment. “Want I should call him over?”
“Jesus, Tony,” Steve murmurs with a moan as he clasps onto Tony’s thighs for leverage and leans back, his sweaty body nearly clinging to Tony’s shirt. The friction bumps up against Tony’s chest plate, and Tony immediately pushes Steve forward, spilling him onto the bed as he slides in deep and silently prays Steve didn’t notice the anomaly. It was something he had been able to keep from Gialetta for months, but the minute she found out… he thrusts in a bit firmer, a touch too fast, his hand planted on the back of Steve’s neck to hold him down, hold him steady. Steve grunts and sucks in a breath, his hands clutching the sheets tightly as his body tenses and clenches around Tony’s dick.
When Tony is old enough to understand what happened, he would think that this had been the beginning of the end. Had he stayed for tea after or quit piano earlier, perhaps none of it would have happened, maybe his mother would even still be alive…
“What? No… No…” Steve surveys the room – from Clint’s smirk to Nat’s knowing smile and Banner gamely trying to keep a straight face in the wake of hilarious circumstance – and decides to come clean. “Look, I have needs…” he begins, but he can’t do it. He drops his phone to his lap and massages the line of his brow in an attempt to conceal his blush.
Steve had remembered the day Master Phillips had told him they would be sent away from Coruscant, the very center of the Core Worlds. He had thought he was being punished for what he had done to Master Erskine’s assassin, with his new master possibly being collateral damage or even acting as his voluntary jailer.
“Afghanistan?” she guesses before giving him a quick once-over. “You look a bit young to be a Gulf War vet.”
After dropping that bomb, Steve abruptly stands and speed walks out of Tony’s room, turning left down the hallway towards his own before Tony can react.
“Name the goat,” Tony clarifies, his fingers tapping on the side door. “I don’t want you to get attached.”
They don’t talk about it again, about what Tony had said when he was a vulnerable child, but Steve makes it a point to compliment Tony on his resourcefulness and his contributions to the Avengers when merited. And later, when Tony is cleaning out his boxes of forgotten childhood memorabilia, he comes across a picture of the costume he and his mother had made one Halloween when he was nine. He’s wearing the Captain America star and stripes she had sewn him, a makeshift shield in hand and broad smile across his face.
“If you believe that, then you can wait another eight or nine hours to call.” Rhodey looks pointedly at the clock. “Besides, it’s like 1 a.m. He’s probably asleep. If you’re going to confess your eternal, undying love, don’t you want him to be awake to appreciate it?”
“I do not think they would appreciate such fine craftsmanship, but thank you… perhaps I can wear it to your father’s victory feast.”
It's still a tempting prospect. Perhaps he shouldn’t have been so hasty as to decline Tony’s earlier suggestion.
The gravity of what was lost in the apocalypse, of what remained in its stead… it’s liable to drive a man insane.
“Steve. I want to, but… it’s the meds. It’s difficult for me to… to get hard and stay that way, okay?”
He wants to go down right now and introduce himself, but maybe that will come across as too eager, too desperate, like when he had gone to lunch on the first day of school and realized he didn’t know where to sit because he was too new and too young and everyone else already had friends from middle school. He had come to realize that the key to being cool was being aloof, but by then, it was too late. His reputation as a needy baby had already been cemented.
“I’ll give you sixty cred for the lot,” Master Phillips haggles with the essential mineral merchant. Minerals are one of Pax’s few exports, its mudflats rich with kaolinite and bentonite for pottery as well as magnesium and potassium for the body among other things necessary for the Initiates of the Jedi Academy he ran.
“Don’t chu wanna have a li’l fun, Cap?” he slurs, clumsily sliding his hands up under Steve’s shirt.
And so by the time Steve knocks and enters Tony’s room bearing the traditional hangover cure of orange and ginger, his mystery visitor is long gone, and Tony breathes easier feeling secure in the knowledge that his secret is safe.
It is certainly one of the happiest assignments Stefanus has ever had, if not the most profitable, and Antony is an attractive man with his dark hair and dark eyes and supple olive skin. Stefanus finds it hard to believe such a gorgeous specimen of a man would have trouble finding partners, especially given his willingness – nay, his preference – to be the receptive partner. He loves Antony – what is there not to like about him – but he wonders what Antony sees in him, why he chose Stefanus to warm his bed, or how he fell in love with him, though he is too wary of the precariousness of his position to ask. Because despite Antony’s professed love for him, he knows he is replaceable even if Antony does not acknowledge that truth, and so he remains silent on the matter, resolving to enjoy the fruits of whatever happy circumstance brought Antony to the ludus without question.
Stark looks at him, pensive, his head tilted in thought. “For someone who believes in the Force, you should have a little faith in your fellow man,” he finally says. “But let’s say there are no Jedi left. You show up on Tython, and no one else is there, and there is no way to contact anyone that remains…” His fingers tap a rhythm across his knees as he weighs his next words. “Have you considered… that is to say… you could always ditch the Jedi robes and hide out with me,” he offers before quickly adding, “at least until Order 66 has been rescinded.”
“Go back to MIT, and we’ll never find out what I am willing to do to ensure your future. Everybody wins.”
Steve chews his bottom lip. “Well, if one or both of us die tomorrow, I don’t want to be left wondering what it would have been like.”
“My, you really are the clever one,” the first sounds almost impressed. “The vow of silence begins upon your agreement to our terms.”
“Guys, it’s really none of our business,” Cap declares, crossing his arms. “We shouldn’t speculate about the identity of the father.”
What follows is a crash of porcelain followed by a shout, and then Tony is there, trying to pull his father off his boyfriend.
Tony looks over his shoulder, finding the other boy with his gaze downturned and hands shoved in his pockets. “Hey,” he replies.
“Well then, good thing I ain’t one. I’m just sayin’ so it’s out there… You can drop the act. I already find you attractive,” Steve says, a touch exasperated. “So… what do you say?”
“I know what it tastes like,” he interrupts harshly, but at his client’s surprise, he purposely softens his tone. “I’ve had it before, and it is not to my taste.”
Stark’s hands reflexively go to his holster, holding his blasters in place. “Why are you asking me to surrender my weapons?” he asks, suddenly serious.
“How’s MIT?” Steve had often asked during their twice-a-week phone call. “Is college all it’s cracked up to be?” They had all seen the movies. Steve probably thought Tony went on panty raids fueled by underage drinking binges every weekend.
And of course, Tony has to be a dick about it. “Really, Steve? A lesbian? Why do you always have to like the permanently-unavailable ones?”
Probably more than a quick fuck in the secutors’ barracks, no matter how much he desperately desires the distraction.
Mr. Rogers seems relieved at that. “I have to say I’m surprised. When I answered the ad, I didn’t expect
Tony spends the next two years shuffling between MIT and Stark Mansion in Manhattan, between his college life with Rhodey and home life with Steve. He comes to understand what Steve meant all those years ago, about needing to straddle two worlds and learning how to show different facets of yourself under varying circumstances. He thinks he is the best, most authentic version of himself when he is with Steve or Rhodey, a fact he mentions to honeybear one night in the man’s off-campus apartment when they’re both high and he’s feeling acutely nostalgic.
At breakfast, Tony does thank Rhodey. He shudders to think what would have happened if the man hadn’t been there to stop his more-destructive impulses.
“I’m serious, Tony. If you want to be one of us, then you don’t have the luxury of puzzling out the humanity of the undead, not when they remain a serious threat to the living.”
Or perhaps he had known all along and simply didn’t wish to see it, the truth engraved in hundreds of tombstones in the cemetery reserved for the disreputable, the forgotten ones who lived under the crushing heel of servitude and more often than not died young.
To his credit, Master Phillips waits until the kid is inside the ship and mostly out of earshot before asking Master Erskine, “You’re not really thinking about training the kid, are you?”
The conversation doesn’t end there. Now that Steve has revealed the possibility that maybe, just maybe, he was thinking a bit too hard about what Stark’s lips might taste like, Stark seems to have decided it gives him free license to flirt even more with the Jedi, to rile him up and try to inspire him to undermine his own sacred vows.
Had Bacchus been lying about his chances this whole time? In a way, it made sense. Bacchus was always trying to get him to spend his earnings on prostitutes and drink, things he could enjoy in the present without an eye towards a future he didn’t have the heart to tell him was a fantasy. If Bacchus had said something in the interim, if Stefanus had known…
“You boys going to stand in the driveway all day or will you be coming inside for a snack?” Ms. Sarah calls out from the door as Jarvis walks past carrying Tony’s bags.
“You can’t stack him with so many abilities. He needs a weakness.” A good hero always had something. Hawkeye is deaf; Black Widow is haunted by wicked deeds past; Thor has been cast out of his family due to hubris; Bruce Banner can’t control the Hulk; and Iron Man has his bum ticker.
Steve lunges forward, his lips sealing over Tony’s in a kiss. For once, Tony is speechless, too surprised to move or respond in any way that could be construed as intelligible.
But perhaps his pregnancy had granted him a bit more leniency where Cap was concerned. The alpha is old-fashioned like that. It is a bit patronizing in a way, but if it meant their infallible leader would excuse Tony’s eccentricities time and again, writing them off as the foibles of a hormonal pregnant omega… well, what is the harm?
Steve is not amused. “Not this week, you don’t. We’ll turn up the air conditioning, and you can sleep in one of your swim shorts and a T-shirt. You have extra.”
Tony hadn’t meant to posit himself as the neighborhood kissing expert, but he supposes if he’s in for a penny, he’s in for a pound. “Uh… Yeah, I guess it was okay. Like she was pretty good, but I’ve kissed a lot of girls since then, and they’re all pretty different, you know,” he hedges. “So, it’s hard to say.”
Tony knew that. He understood and respected Rhodey’s reasoning, his new direction in life, but– “I could really use you on this one. There’s no one with a better grasp of Egyptology, no one I trust as much as you anyway.” At least Rhodey would never turn on him for thirty pieces of silver. He’d ask for all the gold in Fort Knox before he’d even entertain such a betrayal.
It hadn’t been hard for Purple Man to escape S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. All it took was a tiny breech in containment – an unsecured mask, a leak in a hazmat suit – and his pheromones had done most of the heavy lifting from there, allowing him to walk out of an interrogation room straight into the office of world-renowned futurist, Tony Stark.
And now Stefanus is a touch sheepish himself. “I wanted to.” It had seemed like a good idea five minutes ago, but perhaps Antony had long resigned himself to Stefanus being little more than a platonic escort, a paid companion, and no longer thought of him that way. “I apologize if I was being too forward. It will not happen again.” He had hesitated, had waited too long, and now he had misinterpreted Antony’s kindness for interest. He had seen the man gift dozens of his acquaintances with similar thoughtfulness, and yet Stefanus had thought himself special in that regard. Like an idiot.
The referees step in, declaring Stefanus the de facto winner of the match as he rises to his feet, gazing down at Bacchus still on his knees.
Jarvis had called emergency services, and Tony is rushed to a private (and very discreet) emergency clinic where they administer sedatives and monitor his condition through the night. By the time Tony comes home, Steve had found and flushed his stash, and made him promise never to do such a thing again.
Rhodey picks his words carefully. “Right… well, I don’t know what to tell you, Tones. Are you sure he actually likes you like that? I’m sure he cares a lot about you as a friend, but maybe… maybe your judgment just might be a little impaired, and–”
Tony fidgets with the knot of his robe, trying to keep it together, to occupy himself as Rhodey approaches. His fuck-ups and general neediness has already driven away one friend; he can’t afford to lose another.
“Come on, Steve… one for you, one for me,” he had tried to tempt him in Philadelphia when he had managed to land twins.
“Tough break, buddy,” Bruce commiserates. “We still on for tonight? That science project isn’t going to build itself.”
“All your clothes,” Purple Man prompts him when Rogers stops short of full nudity. He hooks a pair of thumbs into his underwear then slides them off as well. He stands before them then, stoic, unmoving, his eyes vacant and glazed over purple.
Concubinus: Male concubine, pretty much always a slave but with an elevated status in the household. Upper class men may have a concubinus until they took a wife, at which time the concubinus may be discarded. Occasionally, a treasured one may be passed down as an inheritance father to son. The female version is a concubina.
He feels the need to apologize. “I’m so, so sorry, Steve,” he says after the fourth increasingly-mortifying encounter.
boobs is one of the boy’s better attributes; it’s partially why they got along so well. “Come on, can’t we just play on? Steve’s not even–”
Cap quickly locates his pants, throwing the sheet directly in Tony’s face. He shrugs them on as Tony reorients the sheet to wrap it around his body.
“Alright,” Bucky concedes even as he thins his eyes at Tony from the other side of Steve. “Fair warning, we play ball in a grass field, not Yankee Stadium.”
He supposes it’s the lack of a fight putting the men on edge and causing arguments to erupt among them more often of late. It had been a couple fortnights since their last contract when they had fought under Lord Fury’s banner to keep his liege lord’s enemies at bay. Steve hadn’t been familiar with the particulars, but then again, it hadn’t been his job to know, only to fight for his shilling a day plus a share of whatever regard Bucky had managed to secure for them for their service. It is a hard, dangerous life, but it is a good living, better than he could have made had he stayed a tenant on the Barnes family land, and he got to remain in the employ of his closest childhood friend, protecting his lord by serving alongside him. It was what Lord Barnes had asked of him when he left, though the order hadn’t been a necessity. Steve had always held a special regard for Bucky and would have followed him to the ends of the known world regardless of any vow.
Suibne has never seen a marketplace so large and grand, with smooth-hewn stone on all sides from the large cobblestone streets up to the towering columns and brick walls separating hundreds of shops and stalls where all matter of goods could be purchased through the exchange of round coins smaller than the iron bars to which he is accustomed. He misses the hillfort of home, large grassy expanses enclosed by earthworks and stockades that often contained more livestock than people. Here, it’s too loud, too crowded, too smelly, and with the sun beating down on his exposed sunburnt skin and reflected off the light stone, much too hot.
“I said get off!” Tony’s leg shoots back as he turns, nearly kicking Steve in the groin in the process and scrambling to the other side of the bed, reflexively assuming a defensive pose.
Their weapons are lighter than the ones used in training, the edge sharpened to deadly efficiency, with Aemilius on the other side.
Stefanus remembers the resistance of his blade through muscle. Aemilius didn’t want to die; his body had fought its death though the spirit had been resigned. He doubts there is meaning, much less honor, in such a death. What are they fighting for if not to sate the bloodlust of men who would never dare step into the arena at the risk of their own lives, to die so that others may experience the fragility of life by proxy and thus be rejuvenated? What honor, what higher purpose could there be in such a death? It was not like his service in Britannia, where his people had fought against the Roman invasion, to protect their home, their families, only to lose and be enslaved in the end.
Steve only grimaces as he massages the bruise developing on his thigh. “What’s the matter, Tony? Did I hurt you?”
Tony brushes off her concern, choosing to introduce his team to each other. “This is Steve Rogers, my new assistant,” he says, turning to Steve, “and this is Frank Finley, my chronicler from Marvels.”
“Greedy. You’re being greedy,” Tony grouses. He hunches over then thinks better of it as he tries to stand taller, his back straight, almost overextended in his attempt to become eye level with Steve. “Why not save some height for the rest of us mere mortals?”
Stark stands, grabs a spit, then walks over to the other side, holding it out to Steve. When Steve doesn’t immediately accept, he buries the sharp end near his feet, returning to his side to dig into his remaining share.
The man sure loved to hear himself talk, but as Steve understands it, that’s a pre-existing condition. Steve and the others follow after them, landing deftly on the other side. They make their way to the side entrance then bang on the door to announce their arrival.
Suddenly, he hears a light roar. He sees his opponents look up, just as the first five are gunned down from above. His gaze is similarly drawn upward, until he spies the source: A Mandalorian, wearing red and gold armor drops into the fray, his blasters blazing and beskar acting as a shield against any return fire. Steve snaps out of his shock as he joins his unlikely ally, cutting down any in his path, until both he and the Mandalorian are fighting back to back. They circle around, firing and slicing through opponents until only they remain.
Steve simply stares at him. “And what about you? A Mandalorian cannot remove his helmet in the presence of others. Isn’t it uncomfortable? Doesn’t it get hot in there?” This planet is tropical. Even Steve finds the environment sweltering in his Jedi robes, and yet the Mandalorian’s armor remains.
The body under Stefanus writhes as he thrusts in and out, the wet sound of skin against slick skin filling the unfamiliar room. His partner moans, clings to him, the needy little whimpers of
Antony had never had a friend his age before, and so he does what he had always seen work for his father: he purchases many a gift for Rabirius, who he had affectionately taken to calling Romulus due to his intelligence. For his part, Romulus accepts his gifts but tells him they are unnecessary, that he doesn’t need whatever bauble of friendship Antony had decided to bestow upon him, but the ploy did attract the others who had previously shunned him. And so it happens that for the first time in his life, Antony is popular, receiving the approval and affection he has always craved, though at a price. He habitually gifts favors to simpering “friends” and associates alike, until even Tiberius takes notice.
“The Jedi have no shortage of enemies these days. You should be grateful to have an ally. Any ally,” The Mandalorian crosses his arms, his hands nowhere near his blaster. “Plus, your master paid in advance.”
It’s not like any of them had much of an opportunity. Barton had taken to wearing the vigilante mask at all times, shedding his name to assume the moniker of Hawkeye full time. He is angry, bitter, and one day, the Ultimates might just have to put him down if he couldn’t stop, but that day hadn’t come. Not yet. Steve hopes it never does.
to smoke; most chemical dependencies had little effect on him after Rebirth, but sometimes it was nice to have an excuse to stay silent for two minutes without the need to make awkward conversation.
It takes several days to locate the purported site of the tomb as well as hire the requisite locals to dig out the stone stairs leading down to a small, unassuming entrance carved into the raised hill. Pharaoh Ramesses VIII hadn’t reigned long – only a year at most – and he was so obscure and unremarkable that the only mentions of his reign were a couple inscriptions on one stone stela and a scarab as well as in the tomb of his father amongst a list of sons, though he hadn’t been identified as his direct heir at the time of burial. As such, Pharaoh Ramesses VIII’s final resting place had been simple, far less opulent than his forebears, and long forgotten. Tony hoped it had remained so, untouched by graverobbers even in antiquity.
“Tony,” Dum Dum says, his tone serious, missing the jocular quality common to his speech. “Stevie’s mom died. The wake is this weekend.”
can pull this prank off and not get in trouble for it. You’ll receive a pat on the back. Boys will be boys, you know. That’s what they’ll say: Boys’ll be boys, especially if they’re white. And rich. But a black man on scholarship tries to pull that shit, and it’s just not gonna fly, okay? I’m sorry, but those are the facts, and wishing it was different isn’t going to make it so.”
Tony hasn’t contacted him since the failed booty-call a few months prior. Every time he thinks about it, he rubs the one-month sobriety chip in his pocket, stares hard at the phone, and runs all possible simulations of the outcome in his head. Steve had said to call him when he’s sober, but what if Steve is still angry? What if he never actually expected Tony to call?
I could make you laugh, laugh until you wet yourself, until you fall to your knees, shaking and clutching your chest, your diaphragm aches, and you can’t draw your next breath, until tears are streaming down your cheeks and you suffocate with a final gasping wheeze, as a testament to just how damn funny I can be. It must have been the best joke in the world – a joke worth dying for – that’s what they’ll say when they see your broken, twisted body in tortured repose, eyes bulging and a Cheshire grin frozen permanently on your face. I could make that happen.
“Yes,” Tony replies, thoroughly annoyed as he ruffles the hair at his temple. “Jesus, it was just a question. I don’t need the third degree.”
He sets out early the next morning for the ludus, aiming to acquire the services of the secutor that had so enchanted him in the arena. He passes through familiar streets, reading his favorite risqué graffiti and finding new ones from the night prior.
“What we have witnessed here today is a love rivaling that of Achilles and Patrocles, where both are willing to die to spare the other from ruin, from destruction, both willing to march into the face of death rather than suffer the loss of the other,” Antony shouts. “I, for one, am moved by their devotion and so in recognition of such a display, I, Antonius Staius on behalf of Marcus Staius Hadrianus, grant both combatants the rudis, and along with it, their freedom.”
kissing?” Stark leans forward. “You thinking about kissing me?” he asks, his voice low, almost sultry.
A man can’t claim to have had sex in all fifty states without Alaska, and where’s the glory in stopping at 49?
“There isn’t much to tell,” Antony says, swirling the wine in his cup. “I tinker I suppose. My father is a senator – politics, you know – and I believe he wanted me to follow in his footsteps, but I find diplomacy exhausting. Give me stone and concrete over making love to the public any day of the week.”
Well, he should, but instead Tony hugs his pillow to his face, rolling into the center, towards the natural crevice Steve had made with the imprint of his body.
Tony’s face twists at the suggestion. He still remembers Bucky’s sisters as fourth graders, and they’d never… not with the other one
Pepper averts her eyes as well to glare at Tony who has since shut the door and made his way to his trunk, to pull out his outfit for the day.
It will be ten years, give or take. Ten years under Master Erskine’s tutelage. Steve will learn the ways of the Jedi, become a knight in his own right, and be a part of something bigger than himself, something good.
. So what if he doesn’t get a kiss as well? That’s like eating a full meal and complaining about missing the amuse-bouche. “It’s nothing.”
“Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has just declared himself Emperor and dissolved the Republic to form the Galactic Empire under his rule,” Rhodey reports.
Is that something a man congratulates another man for? Like ‘Hey, congrats on your dick being a certified weapon of mass destruction; I hope Steve’s ass survived the battering ram that is a night with you even if his furniture did not’? It seemed at once impressive and also way too much information.
“Howard.” Mamma collects him in her arms, shielding him from the short-tempered man. “He’s just a child. He can’t turn it off just because you demand it of him.”
Rhodey doesn’t even pause from reviewing his notes from their most recent lecture as he replies, “If she’s at least 18, yeah man. No one likes being talked down to.”
Tony doesn’t even flinch. “I told you it’s easier than the VCR. It will find and automatically record ‘Days of Our Lives’ at its new time slot,” he points out. “You won’t even need to record over your old tape. It’s so old that the tracking has deteriorated anyway.”
Over a dinner of Chinese takeout, Clint cracks jokes at Steve’s expense. “Careful with that Kung Pao chicken, Bruce. It will sting Steve when you eat him out later.”
But now, he’s pregnant, surprisingly so, and equally surprised to find he wants to see it through, even if he didn’t want the alpha who had made it possible (not that the alpha in question would want any of this either; Tony is doing him a favor by not involving him). He wouldn’t be the first omega to do it alone, and better yet, he has the resources not afforded to most. And so he cancels his standing order of single-malt scotch in favor of prenatals and Vitamin B6. He gives up rare Kobe steaks and sushi and Eggs Benedict.
Antony cants his head in consideration. “Would you prefer I have you rather than vice versa like the first time?” he asks
“I will be holding a munus in honor of your mother. I have already contracted Priscus to supply the entertainment. Your gladiator – Stefanus, was it? – will be matched against Ignatius, a veteran of sixteen matches of which he’s won fifteen and has had to be reprieved only once.”
It takes a moment, but Bacchus returns the gesture, his arms wrapped around his friend’s back. “Then you are a fool.”
“He was a practical one. They all are. You don’t understand because Priscus is your first dominus, and we’re all fated to die in the arena before any of us can ever hope to earn our freedom, but even outside the ludus, out there… they– they ensure to set the purchase price so that you can only afford to buy your freedom after your best years have passed, when you’re too old to be useful, when the cost to feed and clothe you outweighs the worth of your labor. Only then will your freedom be within reach. Then they will take your money and expel you to live a life of poverty with no support in your old age, using your hard-earned coin to supplement the cost of a new slave to take your place. That’s the truth of it. A dominus will only act when there is something in it for him,” Bacchus says, the weight of his words heavy between them. He places a hand on Stefanus’s shoulder, takes in a steadying breath. “So, if you have a chance to leave with Staius while you are still young and strong, use him as your ticket out. Collect what tokens of favor you can to fund your freedom once he grows tired of your charms, and if he is kind, if you can negotiate a better exit from his service…” he can’t even finish the sentence, too overcome with the thought of his upcoming abandonment.
His father would have his hide if he ever found out the provenance of that particular scrawl. Though in his defense, he was very drunk, and Romulus had dared him to do it.
“I’mma freshman,” Tony slurs, vaguely insulted and wondering why the hot guy is standing so far away. He tries to step closer, misjudges, and nearly plasters himself against the stranger’s chest.
“I’ve already made my donation and put in an appearance.” Tony usually left these things halfway through anyway, once he had secured a date for the evening. “Besides, I’d, uh… be interested in seeing if your flogging arm is as good as I’ve heard.”
From then on, they are less shy, less restrained around each other. They fuck most nights, sometimes slow and gentle but oftentimes frantic and needy. Upon entering the domicile, Stefanus would nearly rip Antony’s clothes off at the threshold of his bed chambers, and Antony would attack him in a flurry of tongue and teeth as they melded together – one man with nothing to his name but his desire for the lover in his arms and the other with everything but what he desires most – until they were one body possessed of a singular carnal urge to have the other, consumed in the passionate fire of their coupling.
Steve buries his face in his hands, takes a deep breath, and pulls down, stretching out his face with a sigh. “Did you at least try talking to them?”
His father is quiet at that. “I don’t know if this is some sort of phase, but you’ll be a man soon enough. You need to pull yourself together and act like it.”
“It is called a ‘day off,’” Antony scoffs. “I have not wearied of his presence; I simply am in no need of a bodyguard at all times.”
Tony digs his heels in about six yards away then leads Steve off to the side of the room. “What was that about?” he asks him point blank.
“Which you shouldn’t do,” he grabs Steve’s upper arms, turning him bodily to square up in front of him. “Steve. Stevie. Earth to Steve. Look at me.” He snaps his fingers to draw his attention. “You are not going to obsess over this, okay? Promise me.”
“…At least I am a real man, not a sniveling little loose-belted cinaedus who doesn’t know how to use the cock the gods gave him.”
Bacchus nods, and with that, he steps out of the relative safety of the hypogeum, his stride confident and sure-footed, towards an uncertain fate.
Tony fumbles in the dark and picks up his flashlight from where it fell, again tapping it a few times to activate it. He aims it at the stone slab then at the side where he can clearly see how it had slotted into grooves carved into the wall. “Looks like we may have triggered one of the original seals that didn’t go off when they originally closed the tomb.”
Tony Stark. I was expecting someone looking for a caretaker for an elderly parent or maybe a young child while they go to work, but uh… I didn’t realize you had a child?”
Was his master less of a Jedi because of his attachment to Steve? Master Phillips probably thought so, but Steve is not so sure.
To Antony’s surprise, Tiberius can be downright pleasant (when he wanted to be). Antony can see why he is so well-liked. Tiberius is charismatic, friendly, and funny, everything that Antony strived to become. It also didn’t hurt that he is athletic in build and handsome.
When Steve doesn’t answer right away, Tony shakes his head. “I’m sorry; that was out of line. Old habits, you know. Ignore me.”
After they return to the villa and Antony has directed him to place the amphora in the bath angled just so to allow optimal viewing of the painting from the tub, Stefanus draws them a bath to wash away the grime of both the city streets and Antony’s run-in with Servilius.
But his new dominus, the man known as Priscus, demurs. “He is rather pretty, is he not? I would prefer his face unblemished so as not to spoil such beauty.” Suibne is unaccountably relieved until: “His right hand will do just as well, to remind him who he belongs to.”
“I wouldn’t try to cheat my best customer, not for a slave discounted so steeply,” the slaver reasons. “He doesn’t have the constitution of your usual purchase, but what he lacks in stamina, he makes up for in… other areas, as you can see.” Suibne doesn’t like the sound of that. “And if he doesn’t serve well in that capacity, I’m sure he’d make a fine r
It comes back positive, a result that is further cemented by an ultrasound a couple days later when he sees the bean itself and hears its double-time heartbeat, strong and sure.
Tony smiles and cants his head to the side. “I happen to like your beard, but if you want to ditch it, then grow it out long enough and maybe Laura can show me how to knit you a scarf from the trimmings to keep your neck warm instead.”
A futurist and a man out of time walk into a restaurant, angling for a fight they don’t know they can’t win. The futurist is full of ideas, and his partner is full of ideals. They want to save the world, to make it a better place.
“Nice!” Steve declares, his eyes roving the page, engrossed in every curve. “Do you think they all look like that? With the…” his finger is lower, so he’s likely referring to her butt.
Tony finally looks up from the paper to examine the man’s gaunt face. His jutting chin too large for the rest of his face, high, angular nose, and blue eyes may even be called handsome if he had an ounce of flesh on his frame. The great depression must have hit him hard, or–
So he concedes, “Okay, Mamma,” and slides off the bed towards his room to don a clean button-up and sweater.
“I wasn’t poisoned,” Tony interrupts him, “Well, not surreptitiously anyway. It’s the side-effects of my medication. Chemotherapy. Doctor’s orders.” He waves towards the bottle of pills on the bathroom vanity. “I’m not supposed to drink with them, but…” he gives a half-shoulder shrug. “Tumor’s inoperable. I’m only delaying the inevitable. Might as well enjoy the time I have left.”
Rhodey/Romulus is Antony’s close friend and a scholar. His real name is Julianus Rabirius (Rabiria being a real minor plebian family of senatorial rank in Ancient Rome), but Tony nicknames him Romulus after the mythical founder of Rome.
Rhodey frowns, tilting his head to regard his friend. “Tones… how many black friends you got? Am I your first?”
“About that thing you were talking about, you know, before dinner.” Steve’s jaw becomes hard, his lips thin.
He doesn’t know how much time has passed when there’s a soft dip in the mattress and a warm presence by his side.
Stefanus nearly falls onto the bed behind him, his knees giving out like a puppet whose strings have been cut. He lies back and gazes unseeing at the ceiling then at the nearest wall in the middle distance.
would even look like, the aggressive blonde holding him down, tearing off his clothing as Tony weakly tried to protest, to beg off and retreat to the safety of a highly-populated school event. Would Tony like that, for the other party to take charge? Is that something Steve should try? Or would Tony be frightened that someone so much larger and stronger could easily box him in and take what they wanted from him?
“I will never forgive you,” Antony vows, “Not for Stefanus and not for dragging Mother’s memory into your personal vendetta.”
Steve had wanted to meet Tony’s family for months now, but his boyfriend had always demurred. And now, faced with the inevitability of Steve finally meeting his father, Tony only rolls heel-toe then back again, staring hard at the door. “You know, there’s a Burger King about five miles down the road. We don’t have to do this.”
So, he wasn’t going to win any popularity contests. And dating? Well, he could forget all about that. If no one wanted to be friends with the child prodigy, fewer still wanted to date him. It didn’t help his case that it is also illegal, at least until he turned sixteen the following May.
His attraction to the secutor in the arena would have been no greater than average had his helmet not flown off halfway through his fight to reveal a stunning blond with a broad, handsome face and jawline that could have been chiseled out of marble. With those features, this modern-day Adonis should be by all rights one of the more popular gladiators among both women AND men; it’s a wonder he wore a helmet at all.
He wants to tell Steve he can’t play Avengers if he’s not going to take this seriously, but then Tony will have no one else with whom to play. “Alright,
“I don’t know, Tones. Even with the clothes, he’s not exactly inconspicuous,” he says when Steve exits the ship wearing the brightly colored pants and contrasting long shirt of the locals. Being on the outskirts of the Republic, this planet hadn’t experienced the explosion and thorough integration of migrants from other worlds that more-centrally located planets had, and someone as fair as Steve simply stuck out as an outsider, which to the locals usually meant a representative or ensign of the Republic. “He looks like a stormtrooper who lost his shell.”
The swan who had been Bucky honks and waddles over, his gait ungainly as he flaps his wings as if telling Steve to leave, to save himself.
As if Tony didn’t already have enough problems, how is he going to explain how he tried to get over his crush on Steve by sleeping with a string of doppelgangers?
“I’ll do whatever the mission calls for.” Steve replies with no hesitation, his jaw gone tight and teeth clenched at Tony’s flippancy over his presumed sexuality.
“Every time someone orders pineapple on pizza, a demon gets its horns. Though this is half a pizza, so maybe it’s just the one horn, like a unicorn,” Tony rambles on. It offended his sensibilities as both an Italian and a New Yorker, and he always had to place the order under a false name. He preferred the small pizzerias and would like to one day patronize them in person again. He didn’t want to have his options limited because Steve’s taste buds developed frost bite and had to be amputated (or at least that’s what he theorizes must have happened for him to think fruit on pizza is in any way acceptable).
During the gladiatorial games, Stefanus catches the eye of Antonius Staius, the son of a high-ranking senator. Antony rents him as a “bodyguard” for the night.
It is an unusual occurrence. Stefanus reported to the Staius villa for bodyguard duty in the late afternoon or early evening after his training had ceased for the day and collected his per diem every morning before he returned, passing his agreed-upon fee to Priscus and keeping any additional tips Antony had so generously bestowed upon him for his exceptional service. Antony himself had little reason to visit the gladiator barracks, and so Stefanus is elated but curious as to the purpose of his presence and that of the lady beside him. However, the reason quickly becomes apparent when they are led to one of the nicer private rooms off the main barracks. Unlike the small windowless cubicles that made up the majority of the block the gladiators had colloquially termed “the brothel,” this one is larger, used for entertaining more upscale clientele. Inside, there is a bedframe made of woven metal with a feather mattress atop it underneath a large, elevated window for light and ventilation.
Julia mulls it over. “I am going to let you in on a little secret, something that I learned from my first two husbands,” she tells him. “A man who abuses you two times out of ten is still an abuser. That’s how they trick you. If he was bad eight times out of ten, how many people do you think would suffer his company?”
Nat squints her eyes at their team leader, her gaze even and calculating. “Twenty bucks says it’s Cap.”
To the captain’s credit, his hands barely shake when he peels off his uniform, first pulling at his top before unbuckling his utility belt. Stark tries to avert his eyes when he reaches for his fly to undo the fasteners of his pants.
Having made the decision to proceed, Steve waves at the others, signaling them to move out. They make their way down across the parking lot towards the Home Depot where they fan out in pairs with their weapons drawn, killing the slow-moving zombies and leaving the incapacitated ones, the dried-out husks, where they lie. It would be mercy to destroy them, but they are short on time, only crushing the skulls of the precious few in their path as they approach the building. There priorities lie within.
“You lucky bastard, why didn’t you tell me?” Bucky shakes his best friend and team captain by the shoulders before sliding in beside him on the bench, looking for all the world like the cat that ate the canary.
“Tools, nails, screws, seeds, food, fuel, matches… those are priority,” Steve states, snapping his binoculars closed to pocket them. “But if we have the space and you find one, then you can have your meat grinder.”
“Yeah, and if you kept to your weight class, maybe you’d even have a shot,” he quips. Steve was always the type to bite off more than he could chew, throwing himself headfirst into fights he couldn’t possibly win like a rabid Chihuahua. He wasn’t going to take down anyone nipping at their ankles, but he’d make sure his opponent regretted whatever they did to set him off.
Clint scoots out his chair, the legs screeching across the tile. “Don’t know what’s happening here. Don’t care. I’m out,” he says as he makes a beeline to his room. He can pack up, claim any of the other vacant guest rooms, perhaps even the one next to Nat. It’s on a different floor, and he’s sure his two team leaders will appreciate the privacy…
“I think we both know why,” Bacchus replies. He grasps Stefanus’s thigh, already prepared for death. “Omnes Una Manet Nox. Et calcanda semel via leti… I’ll see you again in the Fields of Elysium, Stefanus,” he mutters through a wheeze. He’s heaving, his chest rising and falling visibly, through fear, through waning adrenaline, as the crowd calls out for his death, uncaring why a gladiator would flout his purpose and cast aside his weapon, thinking he had lost his nerve in the end. Stefanus knows better; Bacchus’s actions are not the result of cowardice as the masses suppose, but mercy, sacrifice, and brotherly love.
good for their cover, so Steve accepts, allowing Tony to pull him to the dance floor, but once they’re there, they run into yet another problem.
“Limited visibility inside, though the garden and sign on the roof indicate there may be survivors–”
Her casket is made of solid mahogany lined in blush-colored silk and covered in the largest arrangement of white roses money can buy. The booze is top-shelf and the food even better, until his father takes a drunken swing at Tony’s ex-piano teacher and knocks over one of the canapé tables in a crash of glass and caviar toast points. Uncle Obie had to hold him back while security escorted Mr. Morelli out of the funeral.
“Yeah, and uh… sorry about before. It couldn’t have been easy watching me go through all that,” Tony says. “Thanks for sticking around, because I know I can be a real pain in the ass sometimes.”
“What did you think about the parbit? You liked those, right? I was thinking of maybe pairing them with a kebab of those weird fruits you found.”
While Steve tries to find a vase, Tony scopes out his apartment. It’s a nice place, with a full-sized bookcase ensconced against an exposed brick alcove. There’s an overstuffed black leather couch nearby with a record player behind it atop a buffet cabinet filled with old vinyls, and beyond that, the kitchen where Steve is filling an old spaghetti sauce jar with water.
“I have a friend, a fellow padawan who recently became a knight. We call each other on occasion. It’s a secure channel. I just want to make sure he’s okay, that he made it.”
Tony’s fork clatters to his plate, drawing the attention of both men. “Can’t we all just take it down a notch and have a nice dinner?”
Antony is surprised at the man’s fury, but despite his ire, he doesn’t even try to hide his deeds. “I did what I had to to protect you.” He will never apologize for protecting Stefanus. Never.
“What? It’s not an insult; it’s envy,” Clint clarifies. “Anyway, six weeks thereabouts? Twenty bucks says it’s Channing Tatum. That kid is going to come out with a cocky glower, working class face, and dreamboat eyes, just you wait.”
“That’s out of my control,” she tries to reason with him, “but I haven’t done anything. I haven’t acted on anything. I thought it would just go away with time.”
“You will not be banker. It is Jim’s turn fair and square,” James states flatly, having sussed out the larger man’s game.
Chapter title is from actual ancient Roman graffiti from Pompeii “Secundus felator rarus” which means “Secundus is a fellator of rare ability.” Oral sex was common but also particularly humiliating in Roman society. It was not something a husband would have expected from his wife and was usually performed by slaves. Accusing a man of cunnilingus was bad enough and often made the man an object of mockery, but accusing a man of performing fellatio on another man was one of the worst insults in Ancient Rome. While fellatio was seen as a laughable preference for men with performance issues, forced fellatio (irrumatio) was proof of virility and something to boast about.
“Bucky!” Steve shouts, but he stops short, his arms reeling as his boots barely toe the circle of dark green grass bordered by white mushrooms.
It’s just that… well, Tony didn’t like to admit it, but it had been a while since he’d gotten laid, and Cap was right there with his perfect muscles and his perfect face and perfect hair, smelling of alpha musk and spice. It was enough to make him want to punch the guy in his perfect teeth (and then kiss it better).
Stefanus thinks deliriously as he follows the nimble retiarius around the arena, the referees remaining on the periphery.
Steve had been a touch cagey on the phone, but Tony puts it out of his mind. The guy is sentimental. He probably just missed having someone else under the age of thirty-five in the house.
“What? I said I’ll think about it, okay? Okay. Good talk. Bye,” he says rather flippantly, not even looking up from his work.
And so Tony clasps Steve’s thin shoulders and tries to assure him. “We’ll always be friends, winghead.”
Tony’s parents had sprung for the nice flower arrangement, snow white and voluminous, to adorn her coffin. It’s closed casket. Tony understands that it is because Ms. Sarah had been much too thin and frail in the end, hardly recognizable to those who had not witnessed her decline in the final six months.
Dum Dum sighs, bringing Tony back to the matter at hand. “Never gonna live that name down,” he grumbles before getting down to business. “Look, Bucky told me not to call, saying that we should respect the guy’s wishes, and normally, I’d agree, but fuck that, you know?”
They each pick up a garden hoe, using them as rams to carefully bat and dislodge the slats from the door – the untreated wood splintering easily from exposure and the rain that must have streamed down the side in the winter months now that the canopy has been compromised – until they’re in. The air is still and stale, the interior deathly silent, almost eerily so.
Stark touches the device on his ear, not looking at Purple Man as he reports. “I think we’re done here.”
“In the tombs of the builders of the pyramids,” Tony corrects him, “and it’s not real anyway. Just some words to deter people from grave-robbing back in the old days. Didn’t always work, and a lot of the thieves were acting on their successors’ behalf anyway.”
He seems to consider it. “He was stern,” he replies, “Old and wrinkled, that kind of jowly you get when you’ve only ever frowned your whole life. He also had a giant stick up his ass. Not that surprising though. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree; you clearly learned that from him.”
Stark reaches into his side-drawer, rifling through the contents before selecting a half-used bottle of lube.
Probably not. With how close they are, that had the same chance of happening as him and Bucky, for Chrissakes. Plus, Steve is pretty sure Rhodes is straight.
But Steve must be a saint with the fortitude of the pope himself because he had simply glanced over at the two blonde bombshells and told him, “You go on ahead, Tony. I’ll just… I’ll wait by the ice machine.”
Even before they had stepped out into the oppressive humidity of the morning to traverse the stone path stretching from their sleeping quarters to the official Republic outpost in this backwater planet with a trusted clone escort in tow, Master Phillips had been more irritable than usual. Something had been troubling the man for the past several months, and the cloud that hung over him had darkened in recent days. Steve had a sneaking suspicion it was annoyance at his padawan’s growing restlessness, built to a fever pitch in the same interval.
“…Him, too?” she asks, a touch incredulous. Steve only cocoons himself further into the safety of the blankets, suddenly embarrassed now that he is in the presence of a lady. Naked.
because I knew – I just knew – that you would never accept me for who I was. I knew my father would disown me; my mother would probably cry, but you… you were all I had for years before…”
Tony gives him a loose one-armed shrug. “Well, nobody’s perfect,” he says, moments before vomiting all over the man’s sneakers.
If he wants to be a child about it, then fine. Purple Man gives him a small wave. “See you around, Tony.”
in the market for a new bodyguard. I cannot be expected to wander about unaccompanied. I could be beset by thieves, murderers.”
And when Tiberius turns his smile towards Antony, it feels like the sun itself with how it warms him up inside. The beard is such a small thing in the long run, and shaving will make his lover happy. He has all the time in the world to grow one when they are older and Tiberius gets used to his own scruff, he thinks.
“You must try the wine; it is simply delightful,” Antony gushes, his grip on his cup loose and wobbly.
He waits a beat, looking back at Steve, whose hand has wandered near his belt, close to his lightsaber. “What about the apprentices? The ones that haven’t made it into the Order yet.”
“May I have this dance?” Tony asks, holding out his hand to Steve after dinner on the fifth day, when the band has started to play some soft, warbling tune neither of them recognize.
“It wasn’t even that funny! I just misspoke!” Steve exclaims, nearly pouting when he states, “You guys just get a kick out of bullying an old man.”
“Jan’s trying to ‘make things work’ with Hank,” he tells him through grit teeth. At Tony’s look of surprise, he turns away. “Don’t ask.” Steve doesn’t even know why he’s still so broken up over it. They hadn’t dated that long and weren’t even engaged at the time. Jan hadn’t been like Gail, ripped away from him six months shy of their wedding. And yet…
“Maybe nothing. I’m not eight years old anymore.” He’s not the inconvenient child always in the way whose father was too busy to so much as attend his birthday party multiple years in a row. DUM-E had to cut the cake, for Chrissakes. He had the photos to prove it, though Tony still wondered why he kept any of his childhood memorabilia. Incidents like that were best relegated to the dustbin of memory, buried deep enough for the therapist he never hired to not uncover.
Tony doesn’t know what to say to that, only: “Cap, be reasonable. Where are you going to go? This is your home.”
“I don’t know; probably a medical condition. Anxiety by proxy? Is that a thing? I feel like that would be a thing.”
Steve is suddenly angry, aggressively pointing out Tony’s window. “You know what’s going on out there? Men are dying out there doing what you’re doing.”
he’s got a date tonight,” Steve doesn’t sound too convinced. “You want to order in or something? Any preferences?”
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers, I expect to see you both back tomorrow after class,” he states sternly, before returning to his desk pack up for the day.
Immediately, they turn, each fluidly drawing his lightsaber as they face not an unknown enemy but the very escort meant to fight alongside them. They parry and advance, deflecting blaster fire as Steve deftly circles behind Master Phillips to meet the clones coming from their original destination, all intent on their destruction.
Unfortunately for Tony, reality is not pornography, and the twins are not conducive to sharing. He had only earned himself a slap and iced soda poured in his lap at the suggestion.
Though how is he to survive the knowledge that Antony is the one hurting him so intimately this time? He tries to clear his mind, to think of nothing at all. He is an empty vessel that an unknown man will fill, and when he is done, when he has squeezed every last drop of pleasure from his body, Stefanus will return to wash out what he can and ignore what he can’t. He’s done it before, and he will do it again and again and again, until there is little left they can take.
The remainder of Tony’s shock seeped out of his system leaving only emptiness in its wake. It was terrifying how intimate he’d become with this nothingness, but there wasn’t a thing to be done about that now. It was over. He’d been angry at first. Furious beyond belief. Until it faded, leaving absence in its scarring footprints.
Tony jolted at her words, breath catching. “You think it was my fault?” he asked, sounding and feeling like someone had just knocked the wind from him.
At that, Tony did roll his eyes, anger welling inside him. He could feel it burning against his veins as his heart pumped it through his system. Goddamn, it was wonderful.
“You lost your glasses,” he blurted because his filter was failing at keeping guard over his mouth. He closed his eyes on his next exhale, sending up a quick prayer for the cement beneath to crack open a gaping maw and suck him under in disaster-like proportions. He doubted anything could be worse than what Bucky always referred to as his hopeless imitations of Rick Blaine (which he’d only seriously done once in an attempt to talk to one of the fellas he’d seen perusing the bar at one of the clubs they’d haunted before their deployment. It’d ended with one of the bathroom quickies Steve had enjoyed for the many months following his mom’s death, so it wasn’t like it
Steve could see waking up with an armful of thin limbs and slipping out from underneath a warm body and a couple covers to start the coffee machine and maybe get a run in before the day started and they’d be forced to part ways. He could see holding a trembling body as newsfeeds spread something horrid and heartbreaking across millions of people’s screens. Could see being held in a tight embrace after a particularly difficult day where past and present blurred and left him near incoherent. See watching television on his old, lumpy couch and ignoring all that extra space to their right. Making a mess of the kitchen, but coming out with an edible feast for friends that were family. Asking to move in together with a golden key wrapped in a little, red box tied with a yellow bow. Looking for a ring and hearing a yes to his question even though he never got to finish because there was too much excitement. Standing in his uniform and saying, “I do.” Playdates at Natasha’s and Bucky’s house because they had the pool. Looking at colleges and attending weddings as Fathers of the Groom or Bride. Two rickety rocking chairs that Steve remembered from browned and torn photographs with softened edges holding a couple sitting in each one, reaching across the distance to hold hands in front of his childhood home. Chairs he would dig out of the storage unit he’d always refused to get rid of because he could never bring himself to throw away his parent’s things. Sitting those chairs on the deck of their home up in the mountains because it was time to escape the city and pass on their legacies to someone else. Taking a similar picture to pass down themselves.
Nodding absentmindedly, Tony ducked around her and headed towards the elevators. Turning around as he pressed the button and waited; he let himself grab one more look in case she decided this was the straw that broke the camel’s back.
Bruce had only rolled his eyes and gave Steve a sympathetic look that had him feeling hot all over. He was in way over his head, and Steve knew a hopeless situation when he saw one. There was a very big difference, though, between understanding something and accepting it.
“You have to admit,” Steve said, not bothering to try and hide the grin that had broken out over his face. “He won that one. And you kind of deserved it,” he pointed out, feeling completely, utterly, insanely overjoyed all at once.
The touch, the voice, all surrounding him in a warm cocoon made him feel safer than he had in a long time.
It wouldn’t be the first, and it definitely wouldn’t be the last, he thought, a burst of tempered guilt sweeping through him. Bucky was right. Steve was gone on the guy. And after a single conversation, too.
He supposes Howard never saw the future or present for glum or grey. His father always did manage keep himself relevant.
“I honestly don’t know how I could possibly be any fucking clearer,” Tony snapped. He continued to lean back in his chair, feeling it dip and roll with a warning groan at the shifting of his weight, and folded his arms. Hardening his gaze, Tony levelled them with a glare. “Everyone’s favorite super soldier decided to pull a
And now you’re telling me you want to go back? Let them do this to you all over again?” Her eyes danced around frantically, and her face was screwed up in pain. “I’m worried about you, Tony. I love you, and you’re scaring me. You can’t keep running from your past,” she told him, her tone gentle. “You need to face it.”
Tipping sideways, he watches as the world swims in front of his eyes. An earthquake of far larger magnitude than in the last shift. There are shooting pains, like electric shocks zapping up through his bones, alerting him that the ground has met his knees. A ragged cry jerks itself from his throat, and gravity yanks again and suddenly he’s bending over, one hand shooting out to land in the tar with a
Tilting his head, the man looked to Steve for a moment before glancing toward Bucky. “You don’t know?” he asked.
Steve let the tenseness seep from his shoulders. Whoever this man was, Steve could tell he had what it took to deal with Bucky. Steve even suspected he might just come out on top.
“Nay!” Thor boomed, and Tony jumped. If that hadn’t woken him up, then Tony was definitely, unfortunately, awake.
He shuffled himself a little closer to the man, making a covert attempt to put his body between his and Bucky’s.
With every step, his stomach clenched farther and farther, tying itself into one hell of a knot. He could feel the tightening in his gut as if he were getting a stomach cramp.
Tilting his head back up, their eyes snapped to one another’s. This time, Steve could make something akin to confusion swimming through flecks of deep greens and golds. He got the distinct impression that he was being asked some silent question, but he couldn’t figure out what it was.
So he hadn’t gotten around to sleeping much lately. Sue him. Pepper’s nagging was more than enough reminder of that for him. And he’d tried. Really. Behind closed eyelids, well, he only found memories. Nightmares. A strange mix of foreign and chokingly familiar that left Tony reeling whenever his screams woke him up.
their hands digging into his chest. Just like Yinsen’s hands. Like a dark cave where only a car battery would do. An abomination he turned into his saving grace then rejected once again.
He can feel the increase of rage flooding through him like plasma in a star before a stabbing pain pierces through his brain. As if a knife were being plunged into his right temple.
Tony ticked numbly, lips pulling into a frown as he looked to the ground. Without waiting to see if Thor had finished, Tony said, “It’s Stark Tower,” and swiped the screen away without so much as looking up. Flopping his head into his hands, Tony squeezed in on himself as hard as he could, muscles tensing, waiting for the next blow. Forcing back tears, he took in a few wet breaths, hating himself all the more.
Tony glanced over at his suit standing behind the glass casing like some relic in a museum. Lights shone down on it and he threw his head down with a gulp. A long time ago – ages ago, really – the suit of Captain America had stood under similar lighting on a mannequin stuffed with enough polyester to fill a woolly mammoth. He could recall the childish thought, a thought only a six-year-old could have, that even with all those polyester steroid shots, the dummy still managed not to fill the suit. There was a concave dip here, an odd bump there to prove it. It was a pathetic attempt to emblazon immortality on a man already dead.
The clashing sound of thunder all around him made Tony practically jump out of his skin. He whipped around, heart racing. It was a sound that brought so much nostalgic familiarity, and his eyes darted around wildly, searching for something his mind had tried to block out.
So Tony forced himself to release his hold, his muscles shattering the thin layer of ice that surrounded them as he jostled them into movement. Sluggishly, he tipped swollen lids towards the clock glaring at him from the bottom right corner of the holoscreen. 9:57.
Turning back, he caught the man’s eyes flicker to his for a second. The look was similar to all the one’s he’d received whenever he mentioned he was a veteran. A mixture of pride and respect and honor Steve never felt he deserved. But this look was also different in a gaping, vast sort of way he couldn’t place his finger on. This look didn’t make Steve squirm in discomfort, and he felt a sense of pride wash over him. He supposed this was what he was supposed to feel; he liked the look in those eyes. It made him proud to be the one that got to put it there.
Tony puffs out a skeptical breath. “Like you can stay away.” His tone is condescending even as his chest constricts. He needs Steve to leave, preferably five minutes ago.
Steve springs into action, already hurrying to the duffle bag to retrieve his satellite phone. “I’m calling it in. We’ll get samples from all the food and drink you had tonight, analyze the poisoning agent, and get you to a–”
“It’s just… with his fair hair and that face… Need I remind you of what transpired last you took a shine to another like him? Your father spent a small fortune to keep that scandal out of the public eye, and you are older now. No longer a youth where such… indiscretions may be excused as boyish folly.”
For his part, Tony can’t stop thinking about it. Had Steve ever had anyone do that for him? Probably. War is hell, and men will do just about anything for a respite. Plus, Steve is uniquely attractive. Even given that, he likely has gone without for at least sixty-seven years. Tony has never seen him bring anyone home, and the only time he doesn’t sleep at the Tower is when he is on assignment for S.H.I.E.L.D. so that precluded overnight dates.
Later, after he has cleared out his hold, secured his belongings in the hatch and lashed everything else down, the Mandalorian settles in next to Steve, who sits along the edge of the common room.
“Presume nothing. This is me propositioning you. Explicitly. Would you like to join me upstairs where we can do what we could have been doing the last five days instead of bickering over itineraries and how much situational awareness is appropriate or possible at all times?”
Bacchus brings the training trident down on Stefanus’s unguarded knee for the second time in a row, the third such hit in their sparring session. Fidelis calls for a break, and Stefanus rubs the reddened spot, wondering if it will soon bloom into an ugly bruise.
“Come with me if you don’t want to get arrested,” he states blandly. He gives Tony a boost, helping him up and over the fence into the neighbor’s yard, before scaling it himself shortly after. Tony stumbles on the other side, falling face-first into the bushes before rolling onto his back to stare up at the night sky. Disoriented and aching, he considers the wisdom of spending the night amongst the azaleas, but Prince Charming pulls him up yet again and leads them both out the garden’s side gate so that they exit on a street parallel to the frat house.
The second orb darts close to his face, veering off at the last minute as a needle made of sharpened ivory falls at his feet. “With this needle, you will be able to keep the nettles fresh and ever-stinging, allowing you to finish this task,” the voice clarifies cheerfully.
“I know it has been… a long time since you’ve been with a woman,” Antony begins diplomatically, “and Julia here is a big fan of the games.”
Unfortunately, Antony and Tiberius run in the same social circles, and when Hadrianus presents his son at the Forum a month later as a fully-fledged citizen of Rome, Tiberius is there to snub his debut. The only youth who hadn’t followed Tiberius’s lead was Julianus Rabirius, the son of a plebian family of senatorial rank who had already been too low on the social ladder for Tiberius’s sway to have been effective.
(Funny side-note: Unlike Ancient Greece where small penises were preferred and large penises were associated with buffoonery and idiocy, a large penis was seen as attractive in Ancient Rome.)
“Men such as Steve and I should learn the finer points of combat and seek to improve our swordplay. What good are letters in the heat of battle. They do not cut nor wound–”
Obi, his father’s personal valet, pops his head into the door. “Staius, my boy, your father is looking for you. We are about ready to depart for the cemetery. Hurry along now,” he says before exiting to attend to the final preparations.
However, all is not lost. Luckily, it’s early enough for Jarvis to still be abed and for Steve to have left on his morning run, so he nudges the guy awake and sends him packing in short order with a mumbled apology and directions to slip out the backdoor.
“Agreed. If one is a man,” Fidelis watches the boy rise, observing his underdeveloped muscle mass and limbs long and near-gangly for someone so small. “I asked for decent recruits, and all I got was him.”
Tony thinks there might be something wrong with his new friend. “Okay. Fine. Whatever,” he concedes. “His name can be Red Skull.”
Tony snorts. It’s clearly an innocent (albeit hilarious) butchering of ‘eat out together.’ The fridge is empty, having been cleared out by Banner during one of his high-metabolism-induced binges earlier that afternoon, and Steve is perusing Yelp; he clearly means they should go out for dinner. It’s not like the guy is caught up on current sexual lingo.
That is certainly true. From what Stefanus had observed, Antony does not want for much of anything and regularly shared his wealth with acquaintances and household staff both. Case in point: the cost of the bolt of cloth he now held in his hands likely exceeded the per diem he paid Priscus to rent Stefanus for this very trip, and yet he thought nothing of fashioning it into a base tunic for a slave he didn’t even own.
Taking one final deep breath, Tony taps his fingers against his thigh, checks his watch, and knocks on Steve’s door at exactly 6:00PM.
Tony is standing in front of the mirror in the ensuite bathroom, dabbing a light coating of concealer to the bruise blooming on his cheek and along his orbital bone. He rolls his eyes at his reflection even as he dusts powder over the cream to set it.
‘Rhodey’ sticks, both the name and the man himself. He doesn’t much mind the moniker, preferring it to Tony’s other nicknames for him: honeybear, platypus, and – when Rhodey is in a foul mood – sourpatch. He quickly becomes a fixture in Tony’s life as he takes the younger student under his wing.
“No, you want me to be straight,” Tony corrects him. “For months now, it’s been a revolving door of women, and you don’t say a word about it. You even chat them up the morning after and make them breakfast like a fucking doormat. Every other morning it’s a new girl, and you don’t say shit about it. Hell, I’m surprised you haven’t asked any of them for their number. And the one time it’s a guy, suddenly you’re up in my face about ‘safety’ and ‘knowing their names.’”
“He was cold, calculating, never told me he loved me, never even told me he liked me, so it’s not such a stretch to believe I was a disappointment to him, but you know, he stopped at the one kid, so the fact that I was his only choice for an heir… well, that’s on him.” Tony never asked him to put all his eggs in one leaky basket, but then again: “I just think he never liked kids; maybe Mom wanted two and they compromised or something.” He thinks of Steve. Perhaps Howard would have liked him better if he was more like Steve, minus his recently-discovered sexuality of course. “Well, he disliked most kids.” And ultimately Howard was still willing to throw Steve to the wolves, if it would keep Tony in line. “He saw them as useful sometimes. Not often, but sometimes.”
“And what would that be exactly? I’m already the resident piggybank. Some would say that makes me the boss, the leader of this little rag-tag team of superheroes.”
“Yes; he needs to mind his head and avoid Aemilius’s trident if he is to live,” his friend replies, betraying only a cursory interest in the development.
Tony can feel the anger, old and profound, rise up. “…You think I’m what? Too easy?” It’s obvious Steve doesn’t want to stoop to his slutty, slutty level by being with someone like him, and the knowledge wounds something deep inside him. “For your information, just because I have a lot of partners doesn’t mean I’ll fuck just anyone that asks.” He knows he’s attractive, and that in combination with being rich and a certified genius just means he has options, damn it. He scoffs, “You really think
Stefanus can take the hint. He divests himself of his own belted tunic, folding it to place on the floor as before.
He looks to the editor’s box, expecting Hadrianus to deal the death sentence only to find that he is turned towards Antony, who rises and walks up to the balustrade until he is the one in the editor’s spot, his arm outstretched to pass judgement.
Steve squeezes his way around Tony to prevent the man from locking him out yet again. He eyes the unmade cot, the three-day-old socks strewn around as well as old 2AM Chinese takeout left on the counter to dry out into an unappetizing skin stretched over glazed chicken and pork atop shriveled lo mein, the disposable chopsticks sticking straight out of the container.
Tony simply wraps the Golden Rod himself and puts it into his own bag. “Yeah well, I can get you one later. If you’re good,” he says, before slinging it over his shoulder. “Now, let’s catalogue the other artifacts until Pepper can break us out.”
“…Sorry to hear that,” Mr. Rogers says as he scratches the back of his neck. “So… when will I get to meet the client?”
“Hey Nat, have you seen my charger?” Steve inquires. He doesn’t even look up, his eyes glued to the screen of the latest StarkPhone Tony had supplied to each of the Avengers, save Thor who left to deliver his brother to an Asgardian prison shortly after the Battle of New York and had yet to return.
Steve exits the ship to join them. He’s already secured all the cup holders two to a seat in the cockpit while adding additional ones to Stark’s central workstation table and the cargo area. He doesn’t know why Stark would need cupholders in the cargo area, but he figures better to have them and not need them than the reverse. Besides, after he had installed them in all the obvious places, there were still plenty left, and he felt he needed to put them somewhere.
Tony stares at the back of Steve’s head, his form just barely visible from what little neon light filters in from the edges of the blackout curtains, and he knows, with a somber sort of clarity, that he can never reveal that side of himself to Steve.
goes unsaid. “Rhodes has always been better at managing your worst impulses anyway, at funneling them into something less damaging.”
some crusty mummy,” Steve finishes for him. “I will not be the one conducting the full body cavity search to fish it out. I don’t have the training for that.”
“But I am not here to discuss leasing gladiators for our own games,” Antony states, putting aside his cup. “I am on the market for a bodyguard, and I am looking to hire one of your gladiators for the job. You will be well-compensated, of course, and should he please me, it may turn into a more regular arrangement.”
He knows he isn’t the only one left, but he can feel their numbers dwindling in the emptiness that follows as each light flickers then blinks out of existence.
Tony flops down on his pillow with a dramatic sigh. “Does your libido ever quit? Tell you what: Give me a couple days – a week tops – and I’ll join you in a broom closet somewhere for a couple rounds of ‘I’m not dead’ sex. Should be life-affirming, you know. A good time had by all.” They can iron out the details later, what this means for the two of them, for the Avengers as a whole. Is this an HR violation? It feels like one. Will they have to disclose their ‘relationship’ to the one-eyed wonder? Then again, he probably already knows, the nosy bastard.
“You don’t have to be mentally ill to need a little help now and then,” Rhodey reassures him. “Just… think about it, Tones. I want you to really consider it.”
Well, that isn’t exactly fair (or accurate). Romulus had said he couldn’t do it, complete with a ten-item list as to why he should abstain, which is as good as issuing a challenge to a drunk and contrarian Antony. So really, they were both at fault.
“No! I just– If you were in trouble, if anyone was in trouble like that, I would want to help,” Steve clarifies. “It’s not just you, but– but because it was you, I – I don’t know – I’ve always cared about you, and I was afraid that maybe someone had hurt you, was hurting you, and I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if I suspected what was going on and did nothing. Even if something was happening and I stopped it, I wouldn’t expect you to do anything. You wouldn’t have owed me anything.”
Stefanus braces himself against the feather-stuffed mattress, his hands fisted in the fine woolen bedsheets, as the man hovering over him thrusts roughly into him from behind, either unaware of uncaring of his partner’s pleasure (or lack thereof). He leans over, his slight paunch squished against Stefanus’s ass, as he kisses the base of his neck and reaches around to paw at his chest, squeezing much too hard for it to be pleasurable. Stefanus winces; he grunts but doesn’t say anything. After all, the man isn’t paying him (or rather his dominus) to talk.
Rogers complies, slipping between Stark and his desk and bending over to present his pert ass to the man. His back muscles twitch and quiver, in excitement, anticipation, or fear, Purple Man is unsure. Even from this angle, he really doesn’t understand the appeal. Rogers may be well-formed, but he’s bulky and much too tall, bigger than Iron Man even. But if he’s what Stark wants, who is Purple Man to judge?
He can see Stark struggle, those purple eyes flashing brown below a placid exterior, but it won’t be enough.
That’s odd. It’s not like Steve knows many people from out of town. Come to think of it, even Sam stayed at the Tower last time he came up from DC.
all things considered,” Romulus says, rather seriously. He bumps his shoulder in easy camaraderie. “You have many talents, my friend. Discretion is not one of them.”
Two nights later, Rogers manages to shake his control and rally the Avengers to his side to destroy the Stark Energizer satellite holding the world in Purple Man’s thrall. Stark and he had finally created the perfect world – free of poverty, of war, of famine – and they couldn’t just sit back and enjoy it, the ingrates.
Tony perks up at that. “Do you think they’ll have meat grinders, specifically a LEM Products #10 manual grinder?”
Being from Britannia, Stefanus is likely unfamiliar with Antony’s native tongue, because his expression passes from confusion to what might be understanding if not for the final look of weary acceptance.
Dracula lifts his hips up, flipping over Steve who hangs on even as he ends up under the vampire’s bulk.
When Antony takes his seat beside Tiberius, the man casually places an arm around his shoulder, drawing him close. The action inspires Antony’s face to burn and his stomach to flutter in a way that isn’t unpleasant.
Tony slaps his hands away, leans in to get up in his face. “You were hot for this before,” he slurs, pawing at his own chest and wondering why he’s still wearing a shirt at all. He tries to fix that, but Steve keeps putting his clothing to rights, and Tony is too uncoordinated to stop him. “What’sa matter, honey?”
“What are your orders, Iron Man?” Captain America – no, Steve Rogers – says when he arrives at Stark headquarters.
Dracula stares at the outstretched limb as if it is a coiled viper before turning to address his son. “Anthony, if you could help me with the VCR… I require it to record the legendary epic ‘Days of Our Lives,’ which has changed time slots despite multiple ravens delivering my missives to the executives of NBC protesting the new schedule.”
When Steve was in the Academy, some of the boys and girls and beings that were both or neither would sneak off into a cave or behind the showers or (as legend would have it) in the headmaster’s quarters during the day to make out. The janitorial closet in Corridor 4B in particular had been quite the spot for the younglings who were just coming of age to experiment before they graduated and went on their separate ways.
Tony thinks of what Steve had said about Pepper and her ‘roommate’ and nods. “Now, if you could kindly step outside, Steve and I would like to get dressed for the day.” He starts to untie his belt. “Unless you’re here for the show.”
Because at the end of the day, Steve might like him more than he used to, but he will never love Tony. How could he?
“No, but it’s what you got, and we both have to work with the hand we were dealt.” Tony stands, heading towards the door. “I’m going on a booze cruise then to the Full Moon Party on the beach. You’re free to join me or mope in the room.”
He peers over at the family portrait on the mantle, raises his glass in mock toast and drains the remainder in one go.
“Don’t hold it like that,” Aemilius instructs him, correcting his grip on the net. “You need to release quickly and trap your opponent under so they cannot escape, then you deliver the winning blow.”
The mission isn’t exactly a bust – after all, they had found and identified the tomb of the seventh Pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Egypt still intact, even after all this time – but one thing’s for certain: This is one adventure Marvels will
The man takes one look at his customer’s clothing, the clean white overtunic and brown cloak made of heavy wool, and plugs “100” into his rudimentary calculator, flipping it over to show the Jedi Master his counter-offer.
To be fair, Rhodey had never seen Mr. Rogers in person and likely had no knowledge of his physical shortcomings. Still–
Purple Man is puzzled over his response. He knows he’s not wrong about Stark’s little crush. Unless… “Color me surprised,” he says, lifting a brow. “I always thought you were a man of action, a more do-it-yourself type of guy, but I could get Thor in here to finish the job, if you’d rather watch.”
There is one small snag, one tiny detail that Steve had obviously not considered. “Nazis are from like forty years ago,” Tony points out, unimpressed with Steve’s clumsy integration into his carefully-constructed, realistically-gritty superhero universe populated by random Lego minifigures stolen from various sets. Backstory is key after all.
“I didn’t name the goat. He came with it. Organic, pasture-raised with plenty of friends, a horse named Belle, and all the other kids.” Steve slows to take a left into the long driveway of the Dracula family estate. “Only the best for your father.”
“Stefanus!” Erasmus calls out to him, causing him to turn and witness the truth of Bacchus’s words himself, for beside his doctores stood Antony and a woman he had never seen before dressed in a bright yellow toga. He beckons him over then motions for another secutor to take his place opposite Bacchus. “Crispus, you’re up.”
Dracula is speaking to Tony but staring directly at Steve. “Might I suggest Anthony the Black Widow?”
The rest of dinner passes uneventfully with minimal conversation, mostly directed towards Tony who continues to run interference between the two.
“And yet he does not,” and that should be the end of it. This is different; Stefanus will be different. “He will be well-compensated. I can be generous of my purse and affections both.”
But Antony had to be selfish, had to hold onto someone who was never his to begin with, and now Stefanus will pay the ultimate price.
“I’ll fix up the engine, and you…” Stark sorts through the pile of debris Rhodey had collected for him using the list he had transmitted the week prior. He pulls out a twin pair of rounded flat-bottom plastic, flipping it right side up. “You can add on the cupholders.”
And why wouldn’t he? Steve is all baseball and apple pie – polite, courteous, athletic, and straight as nails – the epitome of the wholesome all-American man and everything Tony wasn’t. Though Howard never said it outright, Tony suspected his father actually preferred Steve to him some (most) days. He certainly spent more time with Steve than his own flesh-and-blood son the past three years, not that Tony ever held it against Steve.
“What? Why?” It’s not Steve’s fault Stark didn’t secure his ship properly, and besides, he is simply a padawan, an unpaid apprentice. He didn’t have the funds for this.
. Steve is pretty sure they all had to watch the same HR training video covering this exact scenario not six months prior. He was even forced to attend a refresher after the dissolution of his relationship with Jan as a precautionary measure to ensure he wouldn’t do anything drastic to Hank.
“You don’t even know how many Jedi are left,” Stark points out. “If you lot are smart, you’ll scatter. Disappear. It’s a large galaxy; you won’t be noticed or missed.”
Steve wants to ask, but the memory is clearly painful for Stark, and tonight is about pleasure. There will be time for questions later when they survive the morrow.
He’s already sick, been sick for months, and he knows with a grim sort of clarity that he is going to die. He has no one to blame but himself. His carefully-cultivated acerbic personality, his general cynicism and promiscuity as well as any promises he’d made to himself once he discovered his genetic predisposition, all of it didn’t stop him from falling in love with Steve “Captain America” Rogers.
Stefanus’s heart swells, and Antony looks so happy that he is well-pleased with the shield that Stefanus leans in and kisses him, a brief press of lips against Antony’s own.
He recalls Bucky back on the estate, back when Steve had been undersized, underfed, and too mouthy for his own good. Bucky had pulled more than one bully off him, had snuck him sweets when his tutor, who had been trying to instill a sense of class cohesion, hadn’t been looking. It was Bucky who funded his purchases of armor and a horse, who had vouched for him, given him the opportunity to prove himself when he came of age and rise up to his current station.
“I haven’t really done it much since the war, and it seems to have fallen out of fashion among civilians.” It’s not like Steve
All things considered, it hadn’t been Tony’s best decision, and he instantly regretted it in the grey dawn of morning when he woke up with a sore ass and crippling anxiety over having been drunk enough to not only hook up with a man the night before but in his own bed no less where Steve (and to a lesser extent, Jarvis) could potentially catch them together.
Contrary to Tony’s expectations, he finds himself liking Steve. The other boy may be stubborn, his imagination lacking a certain sense of narrative cohesion, but he is fun and compassionate and willing to entertain Tony’s flights of fancy, so really he’s the best friend Tony has ever had.
“Nothing?” His father looks like he’d very much like to hit her but refrains. “You call this” – he holds up Tony’s Xerox packet – “nothing?”
It’s times like these, when Stark is faced away to partially remove his helmet, that Steve remembers the Mandalorian is a living being of flesh and blood, instead of beskar and circuitry.
They haggle over his purchase price as if Suibne is a barren bone-thin cow fit only for marrow for the stew pot until they settle on a price amenable to both.
“Steve,” Tony stops him. “I get it. You should never have to compromise on something like that. You have boundaries, and only a complete asshole would try to coerce you into making an exception.”
His father is the first to emerge with Mamma following shortly after, sounding distraught. “I’m sorry, Howard.”
When Stark emerges ten minutes later, he hands a twisted, cracked cup holder to Steve. “We might need more of these,” he says before stalking off towards a junk heap in the distance.
Steve tears a cupholder from the dislodged table – it comes off cleanly, having not been bolted on very well or competently – and jams it into the seam between the man’s helmet and chest plate for an effective throat punch. He then springs onto his haunches, grabs his lightsaber from below, and slices it across the stormtrooper as Stark blasts another and then the third near the door.
“This can’t happen again,” the man states as he threads his arms through his shirt and pulls it over his head, “Ever.”
“Right pocket on the smaller Gucci toiletry bag next to the lube,” Tony tells him, but he locks his thighs around Steve’s legs. “You don’t need one, you know. I was checked not too long ago, and I haven’t been with anyone since due to well…” he looks down the line of their bodies at his own dick, plumped but mostly flaccid. That had likely done a number on his sex life, not to mention his self-esteem. “Recent developments. And it’s been a while for you, too. Six months since Jan, and you had your physical three months ago.”
The slaver hadn’t been successful, and he had wanted to kill Suibne for his resistance, but his compatriot stopped him and reminded him of the coin the sale of an undamaged
They’ve never gone to the same school, but Steve will be starting sophomore year of high school while Tony will be matriculating into college. It’s a completely different stage of life. Steve must feel like Tony is abandoning him.
“Well, we all make mistakes. Perhaps I shouldn’t have left either, but we can discuss this later, after we blast our way out of here.”
Bacchus cants his head as he regards Stefanus, his mouth opening as if he’d like to say something further, but then the horn blows, signaling his turn in the arena. Still, he hesitates. “Don’t do anything stupid until my return.”
The following morning, Stark casually strolls into the kitchen for his customary cup of coffee, as if nothing untoward had occurred the night before. That’s fine with Clint. He is all too happy to ignore the elephant in the room as well, but then Stark just has to open his fat mouth and ask for a favor.
, on the corner of an alley, wondering if it is the libel of a jealous rival or an advertisement of her popularity and success as a prostitute. Perhaps it is even the scribbling of a jilted ex-lover considering the response written below in a feminine hand, declaring
“I just don’t want to lose it to someone I met three hours ago. I know it’s prudish, but I just want it to be special, you know?”
Antony does not care. Whereas he had been too afraid to free Stefanus earlier lest he lose him entirely, Bacchus had proven he would die for Stefanus, would give everything and anything in his power to ensure his safety, and for that alone, he deserved him.
The implication is there, plain as day: If a dominus wouldn’t free his own son, if he would sell him to the ludus to be prostituted, to fight and die…
Tony begins to struggle, trying to break out and reach the phone. “I have. I love Steve, and I’m gonna tell him.”
“…I expected better from you, you know,” Tony says, somewhat deflated and subdued. “There was a time when… You think it’s easy, hiding who I am for
“Your mirror is lying if you think you two look the same,” Antony retorts dismissively. “You must have quite the high opinion of yourself. Only you would be conceited enough to think you are the only blond man in Rome.”
Tony’s version of ‘figuring it out’ involves a welder and University President Jerome Wiesner’s car. The prank is messy, clunky, and missing the finesse and intelligence of a truly great MIT hack, but it gets the job done. Of course, Tony had copped to the deed immediately and was suspended for the rest of the academic year. Rhodey had been quick to point out that had Tony been anyone else, he would have been expelled, but as it stands, he
Some secrets are easier to share in the dark, when neither can see the other’s face, only hear their steady breathing, their low voices soft with an almost unbearable honesty.
Stefanus tries to be reasonable. “The blue is nice, but it is too fine for something as simple as a tunic, and I fear such beautiful fabric will not survive long in the barracks.”
Bucky had fallen ill with a pox and had been secluded from the others for days now. Occasionally, the pox had swept through the Brookland Home for Boys and taken one in twenty as well as deafened an additional two. So, realistically, the odds were good for Bucky to pull through unharmed but still too low for Steve’s comfort.
“I’ve fought and beaten quite a few vampires in my day,” Steve grasps his steak knife tightly, cutting another ragged slice of blood sausage and spearing it along with a piece of stewed apple. “Hitler had many in his army.”
Antony broods upon a marble bench amidst the carefully cultivated hedges in the peristylium. He finds no joy in the elaborate fountain, in the beautiful shrubbery and flowers of the enclosed garden as he contemplates recent events. Antony can now admit that when Stefanus had made his plea, he reacted… poorly. Perhaps it was base jealousy that another could occupy the man’s heart in such a fashion or it was Antony’s encounter with Tiberius earlier that day that set him on edge, but they are poor excuses indeed, because the result remained the same. Antony had been tested and ultimately proven himself unworthy of the man’s trust. He had feared losing Stefanus, and instead of dealing with it in an appropriate manner, he had given into fear and became just another man who hurts Stefanus deeply, intimately, just another who would force him to submit glassy-eyed and unresponsive to his unwanted touch. And now, Antony reaps the fruits of his actions, all the shame and regret and loss filling his very being. He hadn’t gone through with it, but the threat, the way he had exerted his unspoken power over Stefanus will alter their relationship irreparably, if he can hope to salvage it at all. Would Stefanus ever forgive him? He didn’t think it likely, but that was no reason to not try to make things right.
Steve hates it. Without the distraction of other people, he is forced to focus his full attention on Tony. He wishes any of the cocktails he had ordered had the slightest effect on his sobriety, like it clearly had on Tony, who seemed to prefer a liquid diet over any of the food.
Steve shrugs and gives him a self-satisfied smile. “Maybe after a couple more inches. I’d like to break six feet for the bragging rights.”
“And yet I have,” Antony points out. “It is done and announced. Publicly even and with their favor. Now, the question remains: Will a Staius go back on his word?”
Stark is quiet at that. Steve thinks he’s won (with his prize being blessed silence), but the man again opens his mouth. “…It is the price of being a warrior. The others, the ones left on Mandalore… it’s different for them. They gave up the old ways of our people, but they’re vulnerable without the beskar. Threw us all out – all their warriors – exiled us to Concordia when we refused to give it up. It made Mandalore weak, weak enough to be invaded and occupied.”
Tablinum: Study where all the family records are kept which usually served as the bedroom of the paterfamilias and his wife
The man looks down then. “That was too far, and I would understand if you wanted to make a complaint to Director Fury,” he says. “I’ll uh… I’ll be out of the tower by the end of the day.”
Steve blinks, confusion clear on his face. “You don’t have to. I was serious. You wouldn’t have owed me anything even if I was right, and you definitely don’t owe me anything now when you’re not actually in danger.”
“Speaking of the poor sod,” another retiarius interjects, leaning in between the two to address Bacchus. “The collegia retiairii is taking up a collection to get an inscription in his honor. Dominus will only commit to engraving the letters of his name, foregoing his many achievements in the arena, though I’m sure the cheap bastard profited handsomely from his deeds. His death alone would have fetched a pretty sum.”
“For you and your ‘friend’… for one of you to find a man who would love you, cherish you, a man rich enough and weak enough to buy and free you both from Priscus so you can be together?” He turns away, furiously tearing off his towel to wrap a toga around himself.
He draws his lightsaber, activating the crystal beam, prepared to take out as many of them as he can before his inevitable death. He would like to say he is at peace with his fate, but that would be a lie. Truth is, he is angry that it has come to this. It is the end, the very hour of his death, and ultimately, he couldn’t save anyone, not Master Erskine nor Master Phillips.
would fetch. Suibne hadn’t understood the term, but he wondered if the second man regretted his intervention when Suibne had thrashed and nearly bitten him when he tried to undress Suibne for the auction block. Suibne had stilled when the blade glanced his sternum and hadn’t struggled further as the blunted end drug down his skin, slicing the scratchy shift asunder for easy removal. The blade had stopped at his sex, and Suibne had held his breath, too scared to move.
Antony seems to give up the charade, baldly telling him, “Then I beg your forgiveness for such an unreasonable query. I, for one, prefer to be fucked, but I am willing to try the reverse if that is your preference. I do not wish to deny you your pleasure as well.”
His skin continues to prickle, and he uses the back of a shaking hand to wipe the beads of sweat now forming on his brow and gathering at the back of his neck. He
He eyed Bruce and more anger flushed his system. Everything was a mess. One big terrifying mess, and no one seemed to give two shits anymore. Bruce and Thor? Well, they’d chosen to leave, to hide out, just like everyone else. So Tony had no more open arms to give. He was all out.
When the sweet, blond waitress came back to him with his food and a coffee in hand, he was grateful for her timing.
God, he’d always hated hypnotists. Exchanging fucked up mind games for money. A trick of the light. A trick of the scepter.
Pepper had suggested therapy. It didn’t take a genius to be able to tell that his reactions to the nightmares scared her. That she wanted to help somehow. But Tony had tried the therapy thing. Many times.
Stepping out onto the concrete of the rooftop, he shivered as a spike of cold wind poked into his exposed skin like a thousand needles pricking at him. A particularly large gust slammed the door shut behind him with a finalizing bang making him jump. Tony’s eyes glazed over the shimmering surface.
“Hey,” he replied, voice coming out rough, and he found himself fighting against a lump forming in his throat.
It’d be nice, Steve thought, a scant wistful. Bucky always had this tendency to get them into trouble with the combination of his mouth and his boredom. He never meant anything by it, and by the end of most of his escapades, Bucky had won himself two black eyes and three new friends.
His face begins to tingle as he stares up into the empty expanse of sky. The lack of clouds is worrisome, and the lack of wind even more so. Tony has no idea what layers lie in the atmosphere above him, but if there is no weather... He can’t be sure if some sort of troposphere is going to mitigate the climate or if a stratosphere is preventing UV rays from frying him. Hell, for all he knows, the exosphere is the only layer around him and this place is going to lose oxygen faster than his body can take it in if the planet is already tidally locked around a red dwarf.
Sighing, Tony pushed himself from his knees and onto his feet ignoring the cracks and pops. He set the fabric gently on the table next to him before wiping his sweaty hands over spoilt and stained jeans. Tony rubbed at his bloated eyes, staving off a yawn as he approached the holoscreen.
His five sightings had taken Bruce by surprise. According to him, between Mr. Stark’s California branch and this one, and Mr. Stark’s growing negotiations with other countries and businesses, Bruce and many other employees had a running joke that they’d never seen Tony Stark stand still, much less stay in one place for more than a couple of days.
Fuck, he should’ve just kept them gone after the attack in Miami. Instead, he set up new shop in New York and never looked back.
In hopes of keeping the dizziness at bay, Tony circles around slowly, eyes caught on the far-off horizons trapping him like a crop circle. There seems to be some indication of trees far off, stabbing through the orange sky like dripping ink blots. It’s an eerie sight. A chill runs through him, but it looks the only way to go. Everything else is… tar and horizon.
