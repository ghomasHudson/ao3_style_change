"You mismanaged an asset so badly he didn't even think of asking for help from the people who should have been there with him. We don't know anything about AIM, or the Chitauri, or any of the other major groups he faced— because he never felt comfortable discussing them with anyone in this room.
"But that's not the only thing we need." Hill cut in. "We also need to get our hands on the Tesseract, and track down Tony if we want to stand a chance against what's coming, and for that..."
For something that wasn't even their fault, because Natasha had been the one to access their system to cause a delay to prevent a chance encounter between Howard and a potential buyer-slash-apparent budding warlord[???] and while it was necessary, it still was very hard to watch.
details that piqued his interest. Specifically, that one guy who'd shown up with a bodyguard detail bristling with Stark guns.
And Jarvis, who taught him control, taught him mercy, was the gentle smiles to his mother’s vicious defense of their family. Was the one who taught him of the difference between ignorance and malice, was the one who kept them both grounded, was a constant reminder that the world wasn’t as cruel a place as it sometimes looked.
willing to risk him not pulling through?" He countered, deadly serious in a way he almost never was. "He barely survived last time, are you willing really to gamble on the changes not affecting that somehow?"
] and so Tony'd found himself having to cancel his reservation for that engineering conference in Leipzig and instead found himself showing off the latest in what he'd privately called his spite line of weapons [
that's part of why I need to look further where he's concerned because he's a Holocaust survivor and a good chunk of the reason all our intel's worse than useless for anything after 1963. Him and Xavier.
Makes sense Stark senior'd keep looking, s'not like he ever stopped for you back in the day. Even if things're different. Personally, I'd have thought he'd have gotten the message by now, but. Whatever."
Bucky spent every step since the train trying to remember the dates of every single major historical event he could think of, and swearing under his breath.
He noticed the Captain making a face as if to protest, and with a strange, feral sort of vindication, turned to look at the one-eyed man and continued. “For I do not know who else would have been capable of wiping out the entire invading force of the Chitauri, otherwise.”
It was a very painful realization to have. Very, very painful, especially because the man he’d glimpsed in the headlines and in his friends’ words was…was…
There had been little love lost between Loki and Thor’s quaint Midgardian allies: most of their vaunted team had reminded him far too much of the Warriors Three, all well-intentioned chivalric brawn with little else to speak of, but…two of them had stood out to him. The Spider with her intriguing wordplay, and the Man of Iron.
] under a glaring sun in a country where he couldn't even get a good drink if he didn't bring it himself.
Natasha delicately picked through the pile of newspaper clippings in front of her, and raised an eyebrow. "This 'Magneto' guy sure was busy, wasn't he."
Which raised a metric buttload of red flags in and of itself, especially when combined with the few scraps of information Juno's network could scrounge up, and the nightmares that Logan
But he'd fought too long and too hard to set his boundaries. If he hadn't taken this kind of bullshit from Howard or Stane, he sure as hell wasn't taking it from anyone else.
Sometimes, this strange new world felt like a little piece of heaven. Where SHIELD and HYDRA were sworn enemies, old friends were still alive and well, and a surreal lightness that even now felt too good to be true.
“Oh, this and that.” Bucky gestured vaguely. “Tried to avert an assassination here, undid a sabotage there.”
Suffice it is to say, Loki took the young Spider under his wing. Especially when he found the child shared the Man of Iron's lack of self-preservation in favor of snark, and that is
"It was shockingly cooperative." He replied after draining his cup, and started searching for a suitable receptacle to discard it in.
She took a beat to long to respond, and he groaned. Figures Stark's bad habits rubbed off on his people.
he could do, just knowing some of the language and their customs. It’d be a better bet than risking the timeline, since he didn’t know much about time travel beyond some of Sam's favorite movies but he didn't want to prevent Tony or Sam or Shuri or any of the others from being born…eh. Whatever. He'd figure it out somehow along the way.
"Let me guess. Forgive me? Of what, surviving from what should have been certain death?" Loki asked acerbically, then shook his head. "Your father was just looking for an excuse."
“What year is it?” He asked with no small amount of trepidation to a jarringly-young Okoye who had yet to make General.
“Wait, where’s Tony?” was Steve’s first question after he took a look around the now-familiar people around him.
"Because I have no problem doing this the hard way." Tony continued, voice aggressively pleasant. "No problem whatsoever."
“Back to the subject,” Phil Coulson said stridently, trying to keep things devolving before they had everything in order. “Just what exactly have you been up to? We’ve noticed a few changes, but I’d rather hear straight from the source.”
'It wasn't our fault', just like 'wherever you go there is war, ruin, and death'— absolving themselves of the blame, of the consequences of decisions made. He was
“Sorry, I just need to check on something. Be right back,” he called before they could even reach him, and then the man who had been struggling with magic in combat not the day before had confidently thrown himself into the portal he’d made with an absent gesture.
“…right.” Steve murmured, and didn’t resist the urge to bury his head in his hands as realization after realization came crashing to the fore.
"Geez, Steve, what's the big—" Clint started as he hastily dodged the hot coffee and ceramic shards, before he noticed what he was looking at. "Oh. Guess it's that time of year again."
"When is the Convergence set to occur, again?" Loki asked stiffly, and Thor took the subject change gratefully.
"What about your bodyguard?" Agent asked with an odd note of amusement in his voice, and Tony bristled at the implication.
] surprised for a moment, as a quicksilver smile flitted over his face before returning to his mask of stoicism and oh, this all felt so
not smuggling out a man who'd singlehandedly taken down a roomful of jack-booted types in her trunk, for that matter, but beggars can't be choosers.

“Frankly, had things been different I’d have tried to make a case for bringing her in even if she doesn’t know. We could use someone with that level of long-term contingency plans in our corner. As it is, though…” She trailed off, and Director Fury cut in.
Except said gentleman was Howard Stark, who, despite pushing 80, was giving back just as good as he was getting.
Hank Pym had nearly laughed them out of his office when he'd gotten wind that SHIELD was asking around for consultants; his wife had looked similarly amused but given them a business card with a 'for emergencies only' scrawled on it when she'd escorted them out.
“Wasn’t us who screwed up, Barton. We’re down a heavy hitter, and the more I’m seeing this play out the more I’m thinking it's a damn shame we couldn't bring Howard's ex into this.”
"Fancy meeting you here," Tony called over his shoulder, not looking away from his work even as part of him noted the silence that stole over the comms. Interesting.
compared to him. Tony may not have anyone at home who'd miss him, but these soldiers were...he could easily imagine they had friends and family waiting for them at home. He could far-too-easily remember when Rhodey'd been their age, and it's because of moments like these that he remembers the promise he'd made to himself when he'd first set out to reshape Stark Industries.
Maybe she was taking a risk here, but...he'd already proven he was more trustworthy than some members of her own damn network. Almost complete stranger or not, he was the reason she was still alive. Her gut instinct said he was okay, and thus far it hadn't led her astray, so...
But abroad...Bucky breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the headlines proclaiming the birth of Howard Stark's son, though he had a brief flare of panic when he tried to recall if Tony had been born in 1970 or 1974 in the world he remembered. Well, either way it didn't matter now; at least he was
] and new wounds, to blink away the last of the blue haze that lingered and parse through the memories.
Instead, Loki absconded with the Tesseract, and hid it in one of the many nooks of the Yggdrasil that branched into Midgard. Not that these 'Avengers' appreciated having less of a target painted on their collective backs, but then, it wasn't like he particularly cared about their opinion anyway. Not anymore.
It took the Black Widow to convince the Hulk to put Tony down. If she hadn't already been his favorite person in this mess, then that would've cinched it.
] Tony knew why, of course— Howard's right-hand man in everything business-related would want to make nice with his only heir. On paper, Tony was supposed to be a chip off the old block, especially with his brains.
The soldiers themselves were the highlight of the presentation, honestly. But then, they were a good chunk of the reason he'd stayed with Stark Industries, because...well.
Maybe, in another life, she might've been able to pull her punches, might have been able to burn his empire to the ground with her bare hands. But here, she had less than a month to get her son and herself out from under Howard Stark's thumb.
The man looks tired, but smiles when he sees them. Or, rather, sees Peter, at least—he gives Loki a wary look, right up until Peter shoves down his arm while muttering about how he’s a friendly.
“You have the Eye,” the Ancient One said with a raised eyebrow, even as she too moved to approach them. “The Eye that I personally ensured was secured during the Zealots’ attack. Stephen, what have you been up to?”
Steve Rogers startled. He wasn't the only one, just the one to jolt the table enough to net him a dirty look from Maria Hill as she scrambled to keep her notes from falling.

SHIELD. Nothing personal, agent, but his old man's still involved enough that he'd reject it out of hand."
Were it not for Natasha's hand on his arm, he would've stepped in already. As it was, Steve was sorely tempted to just shrug it off and interfere anyway; this was meant to be a routine surveillance mission to check up on what Howard was up to, his disguise was decent but wouldn't hold up to the type of scrutiny Howard was capable of, but...
of these lies, after a lifetime of hearing them. If the Man of Iron had been treated even a fraction of the way Loki had...
…then, one day after he’s winding down from patrol and meeting up with Loki to catch up on how things were going, a portal opens. Loki goes from relaxed to battle-ready in a second, shoving Peter behind him with one hand while the other’s already sparking green, when they see a familiar face.
The Winter Soldier was a cryptid in the intelligence community: a masked man with a silver arm who flitted in and out of shadows on a whim, who appeared to sabotage some projects while assisting in others without exchanging so much as a word with anyone. There were alleged sightings on nearly every continent, but even the best cameras on the market didn't capture so much as a blur regardless of where he appeared.
...however, that did not mean he was completely heartless: loathe as he was to admit it, Loki had a soft spot for children.
Sure, he'd been annoying at times. Had been flashy, always had some smart-alec remark ready— but it was a sight better than Reed Richard's unintentional but incredibly irritating condescension, than the unease Clint and Natasha had felt when having tea with the most powerful telepath in the country [if not the world], and leagues beyond the amount of self-control needed to spend more than five minutes in the same room as Howard Stark and not punch him in the face.
Then again, SHIELD had apparently a small squad's worth of hired guns his way in what he could only presume to be an attempt to intimidate him, so.
Maybe, in another life, HYDRA might have found an unconscious soldier lying in a snowbank. In this timeline, however, he was long gone by the time their patrol found where he’d landed.
Tony hadn't set out to take over the organization that kidnapped him, but that's what ended up happening anyway.
No, he didn’t feel quiet relief or gratitude at the knowledge that his brother was safe and healthy and alive, no, he was irritated. Yes. Just irritated. Right.
"You can't be serious." Clint demanded, all levity gone as he lurched forward. "Are we really talking about—"
He…hadn’t been fond of the man, truly. Hadn’t been amused, hadn’t been reminded of himself when he’d glimpsed the Man of Iron’s sniping with his purported allies, no, absolutely not. Really.
]. But it was the reason they’d started the meetings in the first place, such as the hours-long arguments they’d had discussing the pros and cons of not recovering Steve ahead of schedule, or the one on the fate of Obadiah Stane, or the problem that was Howard Stark.
"Seems to me that there's a lot of chatter that's the same lines as anything remotely approaching queer issues back
By all rights, it should have been impossible to create a portal capable of interfering with the space-time continuum without an incredible amount of focus
Made even worse by the fact that the Jericho seemed to be a smash hit with these generals, and Tony just continued smiling and acting like there wasn't anywhere else in the world he wanted to be, like they weren't all having three conversations at the same time.
This time, it was Deputy Director Hill who gave him a flat look. "You've never had to deal with Howard Stark or Obadiah Stane, have you."
what the stakes are, we cannot afford for you to fuck anything up. Damn it. Looks like we’re going to have to call an emergency meeting.”
"Take a day off, Hill. I'll do the research in the meantime, but for the next 24 hours you are now officially banned from our archives."
Instead, she all-but-dragged him to her office, and signaled him to get Agent Coulson while she did her routine check for bugs to ensure the area was secure.
Clint looked a mix between thunderstruck and highly entertained, Natasha merely nodded and shared a look with Maria Hill, Phil Coulson looked pained and Director Fury merely pinched the bridge of his nose as he sighed.
It took far more self-control than he was willing to admit to, to tear his eyes from a sketch artist's rendition of what Tony would look like now. It was surprisingly accurate, all things considered. The artist seemed to think Tony would take more after his mother as he got older, though it wasn't like there was a way for him to say anything about it. "This happens regularly?"
"You expect me to trust your people with my mother's life, when you couldn't even care for one of your own?" He continued with a scoff, and didn't bother biting back the tendril of vindication when she tensed minutely.
He stole medical supplies to bandage his mangled left shoulder from the first village he saw, stole a notebook and a pen several dozen kilometers after that, and just generally used every shred of skill he had to evade every single patrol he saw because the

He’d been so, so meticulous, he'd himself a headache over how much he'd deliberated over it. Had written out a goddamn timeline of both everything he’d remembered and everything he’d read about after the fact, and burned it after he’d made his decision to fix as much of it as possible.
] brick walls, trying to pinpoint the exact moment where and how the timeline diverged from their own past.

This time, it was Fury who spoke. "We're also trying to pinpoint the differences between universes, see how far this goes. As far as we can tell, Ivan's filled just about every role Tony had in our timeline, fuck knows why though— either way, we now have a valid reason to be in communication with him for as long as it takes for him to mock up some blueprints. Sure, he's going to charge us an arm and a leg for it, but...it's not like the technology's going to happen anytime soon, otherwise."
Between the giant green guy who was currently treating him like his favorite teddy bear, and the Captain America wannabe, Tony'd choose Jolly Green any day.
In doing so, the Eye of Agamotto was put into full display, gleaming almost tauntingly as his shoulders squared and his cloak settled itself.
"You can stop laughing anytime now, man. Anytime." Tony groused over the receiver, but to no avail: the tell-tale crash told him Logan'd knocked over the ugly vase by the phone in between his guffaws.

handling. Especially if they had connections anything like the ones Howard had, being golf buddies with generals and senators and Tony might've had a weird childhood but he distinctly remembered seeing g-men around the mansion, and the more he thought about it the more certain he was that something was very, very wrong and last thing he needed was to paint a target on the back of anyone he knew.
Because Maria was able to handle it, normally; was able to fight fire with fire, snap back whenever he spewed vitriol, meet his venom with a smile like bared teeth and normally, that was enough.
"This isn't then. The habits and behaviors you picked up helped you survive that environment, but not all are applicable now."
Even when they'd lost everything— even as their world had crumbled around them, home destroyed and nearly everyone they cared about dead and buried— he had never seen Tony like this.
Here’s the thing: at the end of the day, some people don’t get along. Just too similar, some personalities clash and either get along like a house on fire or fight relentlessly. Tony and Howard Stark were two such people: both brilliant and passionate about their interests, both trying to make a difference in the world, both fiercely protective of the people they deem family.
Natasha gave him a flat look. "It's not that simple, Clint. I'm not happy about it, but it's a key event that changed the world. Are you willing to risk it?"
"What're you doing here?" She asked with a curious tilt to her head as she looked between him and the remains of the archives. Her voice was unusually soft, as if she actually cared— and when Tony stole a glance, he saw what looked like genuine concern on her face for a moment.
In a different universe, Howard and Maria Stark would die at the hands of the Winter Soldier— though the truth would not come to light until decades later.
Despite the warning, it was clear Steve hadn't fully expected it; hadn't been ready for the front-row seat he now had, watching as the kid gloves came off and despite having his security clearance under review and his entire company being audited, Howard Stark was in fine form today.
“I’m not about to go through with the Mad Titan’s plans, if that’s what you’re asking.” Loki snapped, and tried to bristle even as the rest of the room started to put two and two together and got five, if the profanity was anything to go by.
Maria Hill rifled though her notes, and spread them out on the table, talking as she went. “His appearances fit with the timeline I’ve compiled, almost on the dot. But the effects are different— see here, with the Chilean elections? Intel had him pegged as the most likely shooter, back home, but here the vic reported a masked man saved his life. And it’s not the only case, either.”
“I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I hereby call this meeting to order.” Fury said, voice ringing out over the din in the relatively-cramped room.
Sadly enough, Reed Richards was shaping up to be their best bet. Especially compared to everyone else on the list: Victor Von Doom had a lot of potential, but he was also very much a wily bastard and last thing anyone needed was to risk pissing off the future leader of a foreign power who made full use of his diplomatic immunity at every turn. Conversely, Dr. Charles Xavier had been very polite during their meeting, but had also emphasized that his school for 'gifted youngsters' took priority and thus might not answer if they needed help. Meanwhile, nobody was inclined to reach out to Howard Stark for help, not when the man made no bones about how he'd do things.
ideas for commissions. Although...I'm afraid I can't help but wonder why you didn't reach out to your usual contacts?"
He didn't need to think twice about this change in plans. Steve turned the handles to as hot as he could bear and closed the drain. He ran to grab the duffel from the bedroom and tossed it onto the vanity. He pulled his shirt over his head, then his pants and underwear came off in one quick motion. Steve was so excited he nearly tripped out of his pants before stepping into the tub.
"When it comes to self-loathing I am king of that castle," Tony said as Steve wrapped his arm around Tony's shoulders. "But I learned to see the good in other people. I believe in the future, and if the future is a good place that goodness has to come from somewhere, right?"
That’s the thing. They say, Steve’s just with you for your money. But you haven’t asked for money! You said we are giving you
"We weren't properly introduced," Steve said. He offered his hand but Mr. Stark waved it off. "I'm Steve Rogers."
“Figured I would stop by Carol’s and see if she will let me crash on her couch while I figure out where to go from here.”
Thor did, Mind Stone in hand as he made a vain attempt to clear his brother's name in their realm, but Loki was perfectly content to never return.
“Okay, from the top.” Maria Hill’s sharp voice cut through the din that came with cramming seven people in a glorified broom closet trying to pass itself off as a secured conference room, and everyone settled down while she passed several folders around. “Here’s what we have of our original timeline, here’s the changes that have been noticed in this one, on page three is the list of key players and the contingency plans in place for handling assets. As always, burn this before leaving.”
In a world where mutant rights were as hotly debated as civil rights in the United States, where children could be kicked out by their families and labeled as 'freaks' because of something they could not control and AIM and HYDRA were both acknowledged as domestic terrorist groups by the FBI and Reed Richards was Tony Stark's self-professed rival in academia— it's funny, how the more things change, the more they stay the same.
then some guy showed up wanting him to consult on some project, and refused to take no for an answer. Even though said project was more Howard's speed than his, even though Tony had specifically said he wasn't in the business and
“You’ll work on it. I don’t need you to be perfect, I just need you to try. It’s new. We’re both really fucking new at this. All I need you to do is go to the bathroom, shave, put on some decent clothes and be prepared when Jarvis sends the call to you.”
Steve stared intently into the popcorn bowl. It was mostly kernels and liquid butter that had begun to harden at the bottom. Tony chattered to fill the silence.
stationed here. It was obvious things would never be able to happen with Buck, and when Peggy entered the picture I understood that whole love at first sight thing."
Tony bit down on his lip and admitted, “The idea of having a heart attack that turns into a stroke terrifies me. I’m so scared of it, being alive without being able to do everything I feel I should? I am nothing without my brain, Steve.
“How do you ‘kind of’ have a heart attack?” Steve asked. “That seems like something you either do or don’t.”
"There is an event on Sunday that Pep wants us to attend. Our official 'coming out,' in more ways than one."
Steve stood up, satisfied that if he wanted his friends to stop worrying, he should show them they had nothing to worry about. Except, Peggy was right. There was one thing he needed to tell Tony before making things official.
Thor scribbled on his notepad for a very long time. Steve sat up straight, waiting for him to say something, waiting to hear about where he went wrong. Thor finally looked up after awhile and asked,
There was a tiny park not too far from his apartment. It was always busy, and it would be classified as more of a yard in any other part of the country. There were a couple tables and a water fountain, with a tiny game of cornhole toward the back. One of the beanbags always seemed to go missing even after it was replaced. Steve sat at one of the tables and spun the cup between his fingers. Steve leaned back in his chair, savoring the morning chaos from his table. He watched as businesspeople ran full-tilt toward the subway or their rideshare. Tourists walked by at a slower pace, gawking up at the view.
His phone vibrated in his back pocket. Steve pulled it out to see an incoming call from “Subatomic Particle Overlord.” He sighed as he answered,
That was the scariest part of it, that Steve wanted to give a relationship a try. He and Peggy were always on the same page, and Tony was something else.
Steve kissed him before Tony could reply. He pulled Tony closer by the nape of his neck and his eyes fell shut for the briefest moment as Tony melted against him. It felt good, felt
“So,” Tony spread his arms wide and stood to do another quick 360-degree turn, “what’s wrong with this place? What needs fixing?”
Steve didn't understand what he said to incite this shift in the air between them. He didn't like it. Tony continued,
"That is one of the perks of this gig, soldier." Tony winked and Steve's heart skipped a beat. "Cameras or no cameras, I am one hundred percent your sugar daddy."
guy. This man who changes the world with one night in his workshop. When you told me about Afghanistan, I thought you told me everything. You omitted the part about how it’s continued to affect you ever since. While I know that you put a lot of trust in me when you opened up … Last night, when you told me about your heart, all I could think about was what I felt after I lost Bucky.”
He placed the water glasses on the table and plopped into a chair to watch the show. It was quite entertaining, watching Tony dance his way around the work table as his hands remained steady on his tools. A few minutes later he shouted,
“For his twentieth, there were twenty people. His thirtieth had thirty people, so you know where this leads.”
“Now I’m scared, too. I came into this and put everything on the table for you. I had barely accepted myself as bisexual before my face was in the corner of every magazine in the Northern Hemisphere. I told you about the worst part of my life because I thought you needed to know what you were getting in me. Now, a full month in, you
“Well, I want to date you. I know it’s for the cameras and the board, but … If you want to give it a shot, then let’s do it. Let’s have some fun, and you can make this into whatever you want it to be.”
"It means that everyone knows and no one talks about it. No one tries to reveal it because it could cost me my life. I used to sell weapons in countries where being gay will get you killed. Now I am trying to sell those same countries renewable energy technology. Coming out would have ruined my ability to run my company."
“I know you all missed me.” He pointed at one of the people toward the back and said, “Even you, Richards!”
"Jarvis, I'd like to ask you a question and you might not be able to answer it, but I'm gonna ask you anyway."
His phone pinged right as Steve finished wafting the roasted Brussels sprouts. Steve placed the oven mitt on its hook and pulled out his phone to see three new messages.
Oh, fuck, this was not the place for that conversation. Or was it? Was there any proper place to speak about what he'd done?
“Look, I don’t know a lot about your world, Tony. The more I experience, the more I think the quiet life in Brooklyn ain’t so bad.”
Steve nearly jumped out of his skin when he read the clock. He sat up, popped his joints, and stretched. It was a well-established routine, but he wouldn’t be able to go for a run. Not in the middle of Midtown. He hadn't slept this late for ten months, and even that was aided by heavy medication.
"I know; you could break me in half like a toothpick. But you cannot understand the power the media has, how bad they can make you look if you even cough in the wrong direction."
"HAH!" Tony doubled-over in laughter and whacked Steve in the stomach. "Oh, God, that would be amazing."
"Huh. What kind of parent names their kid after a president? You know James Buchanan was a confirmed bachelor? I had a thing with a girl on the quiz bowl team at MIT so I learned a bunch of history and—wait. James
“You are in for a long wait, Steve, but Tony has something to fight for and he needs a partner. I can’t think of anyone better than Captain America.”
"Not nearly as much as I need you. If I lose you and have to begin all over again, Steve, I'll just give up. I don't want to have to try again."
He pulled on sweatpants and a hoodie since it was still April, and the mornings weren’t any less cold than the pre-Tony part of the month had been. Steve walked downstairs and out the door, then glanced down at his watch. It had been a thoughtful gift. Not needing to pull out his phone to check the time would make the runs easier. Steve pulled the hood up and forced the sleeve down over the watch, praying no one would notice him.
They went through two more lights in companionable silence. There were no more people with cell phone cameras pointed in their direction, the novelty having worn off a block earlier.
The conference room was tucked into the corner with a presentation pulled up on the television screen against the far wall. Tony wore an impeccably tailored suit and shoes that shone bright enough to reflect the lights on the ceiling, a departure from the man Steve remembered in the workshop or the messy-haired asshole who popped out of a Snuggie. There was a great deal about Tony Stark that Steve had yet to learn. Steve lost his nerve for a moment but figured he couldn't fall much lower in Tony's favor than he already was. So he rapped his knuckles on the conference room door.
“Of course.” She patted her papers into place then placed them toward the side of her desk. She punched something into her StarkPad and asked, “What can I do for you?”
Everything happened so much quicker than it should have. Tony Stark looked nothing like the man whose head had poked out of a Snuggie earlier that afternoon. This version of Tony was wearing a thick coat, too warm for the current weather but easy to hide in. He held himself differently than Steve thought he would, cautious and almost nervous. Then the people Steve had been chitchatting with turned their lenses in Stark's direction. Tony's mouth formed a thin line as the flashes went off in his face, the lights reflected in the dark lenses of his sunglasses. It was like they practiced this, solidifying into a three-headed monster shouting questions.
"Every year on March 10th we get a reminder about Bucky's birthday." Steve's hands shook so he twined his fingers together and hoped Tony didn't notice. "When that little red number one pops up on my app I hope it's Bucky with a nice message telling me he's risen from the dead. Pretty sure my ma'd say that's blasphemy but neither she or Buck is here to give me shit about it."
“Well.” Steve opened the front door and gestured for Tony to go up first. “Therapy on Thursdays. My VA group on Saturdays. Sam usually calls twice a week, and that’s always nice. It’s good having a friend who never knew Bucky because our conversations are never about him.”
“‘Aquarius moons pretend to despise emotional neediness while often depending on their partner to read their innermost feelings without helping them to do so.’ The shoe fits, Cinderella.”
"He sacrificed himself to save me." Tony turned to look at Steve with sad, tired eyes. "I will not let anyone else give up their life for me."
“I’m sorry, I really am. Leaving the army was not my first choice. It felt like I failed, and I didn’t want to talk to anyone afterward. Especially not you.”
"Each time he fired me I would show up the next shift with a smile and a cheeseburger. Well-done, no pickles."
“Because I still love you. So, so much Peg. Maybe not the way I used to, but I can’t think of a single person I’d fight for more than I’d fight for you. I want the best for you, and not
Steve didn't press the matter as Tony landed on the bench seat across from him. Literally, Tony plopped so loudly Steve heard the smack of his ass against the bench. Mr. Stark spread out in the booth, pulling one leg up underneath him and leaning against the wall on his left. It made Steve feel rather rigid in comparison. Stark grabbed one of the straws from the holder and ripped the top part of the paper. Before Steve understood his intention, Stark had blown the paper across the table so it hit Steve in the forehead.
"It's a nice ass," Steve conceded. He pushed the pizza box forward and said, "Pepperoni and sausage."
you to go to any trouble. Why should you make an effort when I could buy literally whatever I want?”
Steve goes on his first date with Tony Stark at a shitty diner he secretly loves. The date goes better than he thought it would.
"That's it, isn't it?" Tony asked. He leaned back against the couch, and nearly sank into the cushion. "You were always with him, weren't you? Probably coordinated your vacation time so you could come home together. When you left the army, you didn't come back to Brooklyn because it's home, did you? You came back because it was the only piece you had left of Barnes."
Dr. Gilbert blubbered nonsense, "Well I will not stand for ... Fairy boy ... Insult ..." but Steve could only smile harder. He dropped his hold on Tony and patted Gilbert's shoulders.
“Many things.” Steve frowned. “I keep waiting for the sky to come falling down on me. Spending so long terrified of even
Then she left to speak with someone across the lobby. All the people in this building seemed to have conversations that same way. They began and ended quite abruptly, and Steve was forgotten the moment they needed to be somewhere else. With that thought, he stepped inside the elevator and was greeted by a familiar (still a bit creepy) robotic voice.
"Be careful with this. If it ends badly, everyone will blame him and you will blame yourself for that. Think about it, maybe go on a few more dates with him, but don't dive into the deep end of the pool unless you know what you're doing. Now, my lunch is over so all I will say is that if you fuck a billionaire you have to tell me about it in excruciatingly awkward detail."
Steve bit back the instinctive, "Never heard that one before." His ma said sarcasm never made a good first impression. It seemed Miss Potts did not require a response.
"I did," he confirmed. "I went first, testing the ice as we crossed. About a third of the way through, it cracked behind me and swallowed four of my men. I managed to get them all out—"
"I hope to be seeing you again, Captain Rogers," Happy replied in a tone that heavily implied the opposite. He looked at Steve in the rearview mirror with a sad smile on his face.
"No, he was captured before me and the Ten Rings used him as a translator." Tony paused for a long time. So long that Steve thought he might've fallen asleep. "His name was Yinsen."
“I’ve been alone for a long time, and I really like you. I was terrified of being with a man because I was never allowed to be. If I so much as hinted at it, I would have lost my career. Then I met you and thought, to hell with it. If there’s going to be a guy, I want it to be
Steve prepared their plates; lasagna, Brussels sprouts, and baguette slices. He sat across from Tony at the table and waited for him to dig in. Except, Tony didn’t. He stared at Steve for an uncomfortably long time. Steve poked at a sprout with his fork.
"On his own, and other than somehow faking his death while saving the President of the United States I don't know what happened. Did he talk to you about it?"
Within 36 hours, HYDRA burned, SI was put under more scrutiny than ever before, and it would take months for Howard to realize his heir had never arrived to the boarding school he'd had him shipped off to.
Agent inclined his head. "You wouldn't happen to have some knowledge of thermonuclear astrophysics, would you?"
then he gets kidnapped at a conference and Victor Von Doom causes a minor diplomatic incident searching for him because he considered him "a worthy rival when Reed was busy" [
“Well, at least now we know why Tony didn’t want to work with him.” Bruce said after a few minutes’ worth of carefully-regulated breathing. “Especially after the hard time Steve was giving him with Ultron, and then…”
"When Miss Potts said you have a drinking problem," Steve hesitated for a moment, "she didn't mean you like to go out and drink. She was trying to tell me you're an alcoholic."
The employee said, "You could probably use one of these after the week you've had, huh?" As if they were friends.
“You can’t script these things. Maybe try letting him lead for once, but I know how difficult it is for you to do that.”
New York City seemed to have one of just about everybody; except the one person he missed the most. Everything in Brooklyn had Bucky written on it. Steve kept watch while Bucky puked over there in those bushes. Bucky had pulled a guy off Steve in that alley after a particularly nasty fight. They even stopped in the cafe two blocks down every week when they were kids because it had a jukebox. Two dollars got them ten songs.
That earned him another smile. He understood, then, that this was Tony's comfort zone. Banter was something he could do, and it was as good a place to start as any.
"You don't have to sleep with him! Just make the world, especially the board, believe you're dating him. He will take you to lunch and you can take him to dinner. Have some overnights at his penthouse and go to a few galas with him. Stop him from throwing things at photographers and, most importantly, keep him from making an ass of himself in public.”
"So your ... what? Your 'fans' are watching me?" He tightened his grip on Tony's hand. "They know where I live?"
The floor felt more like what he was used to. The army's mattresses were only slightly more comfortable than sleeping on rocks. Sometimes, Steve preferred rocks because they didn't sound like cracking plastic when he moved half an inch. He used the wadded-up sheet as a pillow and nestled into the duvet. The floor was firm beneath his back and Steve fell asleep in seconds.
“Were you?” asked Tony, his voice a bit strained. “Let’s hope our meeting doesn’t run long, then. Actually, Sergeant Wilson is my guest.”
Steve went to the grocery store. His ma said, “If you’ve ever got something to say, cook up some lasagna. Everyone loves pasta and cheese, and they can’t interrupt if their mouth is full of food.” He used to cook meals for Peggy when things were good. Then he started cooking when things were bad.
Steve glanced over and confirmed, "Yes, they are all staring at us. The man holding the remote looks like he's about to vomit."
The expression on Tony's face said he knew Steve was holding back. Thank God he didn't press further.
“You said that Stark changes when the cameras are around. Give him a day with no cameras. No need to impress people. A day where you show him that he is enough for you.”
Steve chuckled and admitted, "I don't understand much of it, but I do like watching him work. Watching things go from a bunch of blue holograms to scraps to a fully-formed prototype? It's art."
Said no to Howard’s impossible standards, said no to the weapons-making, and turns his back and walks away with his head held high.
All the while, Thor traveled back and forth between Asgard and Midgard and Loki did not envy him in the slightest.
"Don't look at me," Maria Hill said with a raised eyebrow as she held up the folder in her hands, "I've been busy tracking down the divergences between our timelines. Which, by the way, isn't as much as you'd think it is, which is suspicious in and of itself but that's something for later."
Something strange was afoot. His reaction alone had been very odd, when he’d seen them; he’d blanched, then looked around as if seeing everything for the first time, and then— he’d left.
He nodded at her, then addressed the rest of them. “We’ve been monitoring Steve’s crash site. Absolutely
James “Bucky” Barnes woke up. This in and of itself shouldn’t have been unusual— except his last memory was of choking on his own blood in Steve’s arms, with the bitter knowledge that they’d failed in protecting the others, so.
Director Fury glanced at the file she hadn’t put down, and gave a low whistle. “Damn. He sure knows how to pick ‘em.”
Steve didn’t answer calls on his morning run. Friday, he ran his route as usual, though someone called a third of the way through. He figured if it was urgent they would call again. He jogged up the stairs to his apartment after the run and pulled his sweatshirt over his head. He grabbed his phone from his pocket.
You came back with a cheeseburger. It was like a dream, you know? A hot man kissing me and I got a cheeseburger out of it. Kisses come first, though. Remember that. Kisses before burgers.”
Peggy was right. He knew as much, but he needed to hear it from her. She knew him better than anyone, better than even Sam or Natasha. She could have asked for more of him when Bucky died, but she didn’t. Peggy gave as much as she could, and when she couldn’t give any more she asked Steve if he could give just a little.
“I think we all saw on TMZ that Tony is certainly no Whitney Houston, but this guy definitely has Kevin Costner vibes.”
There was so much about this situation that Steve didn't know, and before retiring he hated not knowing. Steve could do it, though, could do something to help get himself out of his shitty apartment and do some good with the money. Steve couldn't think of anything more interesting than the rumpled inventor halfway to suffocating himself on a couch cushion.
Sam called on Wednesday. Or, well, at 2:00 on Thursday morning. Steve pulled his phone off the charger and pushed the quilt down to his hips. He answered the call, put it on speaker, then placed the phone on his chest.
“Okay,” Tony shrugged it off. “But if I’m going to fix it, I need to know if you prefer the water to come out fast and hard, or if you’re more of a wide, slow spray kind of guy.”
The moment people began to pay attention, Tony became a different person. Well, Steve supposed he wasn’t a different person so much as he turned parts of himself up and put others on silent. No one could look away as Tony made a few more jokes and motioned for Steve to sit in one of the nearby chairs. Steve sat ramrod-straight and wondered what the popcorn cost in a place like this. A hundred dollars a bucket? A thousand?
Steve laughed as he started to pull away, but Tony had his fingers through one of Steve's belt loops.
” Steve sagged backward in his chair and tossed the fork onto his plate. “How could you think it was about money? I made you dinner tonight because I wanted to eliminate the barriers I put up between us. None of my feelings for you are artificial. I wanted to date you, Tony.”
“Why are you calling me.” She paused for just a moment before rephrasing. “Why the bloody hell is Tony Stark calling me?”
Tony stopped in the middle of the street then pulled Steve over to the edge of the sidewalk. He raised his hand and Steve asked,
“I don’t get you. I wanna be with you so badly. I wanna have you in the workshop, wanna have you in my bed, wanna make you omelets. I like when you kiss me, and I really like when you say all those nice things about me to people. I know you mean them because you don’t say things you don’t mean. I’ve never had anyone like you in my life before. Pep was close. Real close in her own way.”
The worst part was that Tony was not entirely wrong. Steve wanted to move on from Bucky because that love held him back, but he didn't know how to move on without forgetting the way Bucky made him feel. Steve never wanted to lose that. At least he was certain of one thing ...
The StarkPad fell out of her hands and she nearly jumped out of her seat. In an eerily calm voice, Pepper asked,
“J comes everywhere with me. Don’t worry, he can’t see anything, it’s not like you have cameras in here …” He paused. “You don’t have cameras in here, do you?”
Steve clenched his teeth together but forced himself to be calm. This woman probably had to deal with the worst of the worst of Manhattan businessmen every day, so she deserved some kindness.
If Steve didn't know better, he'd say Jarvis sounded defensive. But he knew he shouldn't feel guilty about this. He hardly knew Tony Stark, how could this be his fault?
Without looking away, Tony said, "Making everyone in there very uncomfortable is what you're doing."
"Fine," Steve said, opening the back door and tossing the duffel bag inside, "but we have to make a stop along the way."
“Because I do, Steve, and I’m pissed I needed alcohol to say it. You tell me things about Barnes, about your friends, showing me pictures of what your life was like once … And I’m too afraid to tell you how I feel even right now. It’s not fair to you.”
Steve’s entire world stopped turning. He’d put everything on the table, found something he wanted to pursue. A man he
"You could have picked that up from a tabloid." Thor leaned forward and put his elbows on the desk. "Was there any way you connected with him?"
"I've always been fighting against something, and fighting to help you keep your company is a way for me to fight
"No, I don't believe you. You cannot understand what that moment did to me. What it still does to me. It ruined my relationship with Peggy and it has damaged me more than any hit I ever took. When Bucky fell I saw a dozen futures hit the ground. My best friend was gone right out from under me. And do you know what he shouted as he fell?"
“Tony’s first boyfriend.” Rhodey rolled his eyes. “Could see that bastard for what he was ten miles away, but Tony was blind to all the signs. Not really my place to tell you about it, but if you Google Ty and Tony, you’ll figure it out.”
"You are damning a relationship before it even begins! Maybe you're right and it will fall apart before the year is up. Maybe we are completely incompatible or you get tired of having your photo printed in magazines, but I want to try."
was never meant to feel good. But it always helped. Steve went downstairs and found Tony talking with the receptionist.
Tony laughed and said, "I don't know you well, but I doubt being my boyfriend is the most impressive thing you've ever done."
. You asked why they pushed me out. I went out because, as one of the majors said, they didn't want 'that fucking queer getting proper men killed because his dick buddy died before he could get some.'"
Running through New York wasn't really running. It was running, jogging, stopping to wait for a light, running across the street, and continuing the process until he hit Prospect Park. Halfway there, someone tapped Steve on his arm in a crosswalk. He pulled out one earbud to hear them say,
“I have no idea.” Steve offered his phone for Sam and Nat to see. “The people, and even the robots in Tony’s world speak English like it’s a different language.”
"You, soldier, are amazing!" Tony grinned even harder and fell back onto the cushions. "That little stunt back there has changed the entire outlook on my probation."
“Tony invited himself over to my apartment and started fixing things. The sort of things a landlord would repair if they cared. He does it, though, because he wants to earn affection. He isn’t comfortable asking for it unless he feels he has done something to deserve it. I don’t know how to make him understand he doesn’t have to buy me things or fix my stuff for me to like him.”
Tony tossed an inordinately large tip down the moment he finished his float. He tugged on Steve's arm as he scooted out of the booth. Steve followed him out the door before asking,
"Well yeah, who the hell decided to go to a diner on a first date? With all his money he should have flown you to Rome or some shit like that."
Steve laughed and said, "Sorry, that came out wrong. If you're under the impression I didn't enjoy kissing you, then you're out of your goddamn mind."
"Maybe you are right and it was a test, but not of whether you would leave. If Mr. Stark could get you to open up about your deepest pain then he would feel safe opening up about his own."
“I saw this photo of you and Stark, and it reminded me of us. When I’d see him, I always met him with a hug. He’d kiss me on the forehead and say, ‘Hold me closer, tiny dancer.’” Nat swallowed thickly before she continued. “I think of him less now. It’s been years and I am trying to focus, but there are moments when I lose it and I feel him again.”
Tony smiled and gave them all a wave before standing in front of a massive backdrop with the museum's logo plastered across it. Steve remained shell-shocked on the curb until Tony smiled and held out his hand, motioning for Steve to join him. Steve's feet led him there, though he didn't remember telling them to move.
He leapt up from the floor and grabbed his phone. Two missed calls from Sam and a voicemail from an unknown number. Steve wiped the crust from his eyes and pressed play.
“At this point, who hasn’t?” asked Tony. He shook Sam’s hand and said, “Steve hasn’t told me much about you. I look forward to seeing you later.” Tony turned to face Steve and gave him a look that said,
piece is right." That was the second time someone dropped that magazine into the conversation like it was important. "But I hope he's turning things around. Who knows? Maybe that starts with you."
“If Tony Stark puts his arm around you, it’s a one-way ticket to Tinseltown. People have gotten modeling gigs, acting gigs, put themselves on the map just being seen with him for a night. He held your hand, Rogers, and that means everyone in the city knows who you are. So what’s your endgame?”
"But Pepper found whatever I didn't," Tony admitted. He waited until Steve looked up at him to ask, "What happened in Austria?"
“You must really like him to have told him already. I am so happy for you, Steve. Truly, I haven’t seen you smile this much in years. Is he good for you?”
“You did the same thing. You said it yourself, your company’s success depended, for years, on you hiding the fact that you are interested in men. Why have you stayed?”
Steve didn’t correct her; she was right. Nat was second the same way Peggy was. Always second to what might have been.
Agent Coulson replied. "We had this one, actually. Civil war in the early nineties, and nobody questioned how a monarchy that survived everything the Soviet Union threw at it fell right after—"
which, in retrospect, was a very foolish thing to have done and resulted in a very pissed off Frost Giant squaring off against a race previously considered extinct.
thing he needed was any rumors of James Buchanan Barnes surviving an impossible fall, especially since the full extent of what the supersoldier serum was capable of wasn't known yet.
“Lady, all I did was try and remember what HYDRA had me doing, and do the exact opposite.” Bucky raised his hands, then shrugged. “S’not like all of it stuck, anyhow. I saved some people and projects, but…not sure if it was the butterfly effect or what, but some things ended up happening anyway.”
“You’re saying you were mind controlled, last time.” The one-eyed man said, suspicion heavy in his voice and gun unwavering.
"All you want is the Tesseract and a willing tool. I'm sorry, but I will provide neither." With that, he tossed his empty cup into a nearby disposal unit, and stalked away, mood now completely soured and pulling on his illusions to melt into the shadows as the locals scrambled to capture his afterimage.
Tony was not impressed by whoever it was that was responsible for the rumble above him, or the multiple voices chattering over a communications system that'd been laughably easy to hack. Really, the only saving grace of their little shindig was the agent who'd had enough sense to poke through what was left of the archives before working on bringing the base down around them. Black Widow, according to the comms, which only made the entire situation that much more ridiculous.
” Natasha cut him off sharply, then paused and gentled her tone. “It’s a terrible idea. Howard and Tony are very different people, treating them otherwise would be a huge disservice to both. Now more than ever.”
In one timeline, he would grow up with the odds stacked against him from the start. Would, after the death of his father, be shuffled off into a broken system and forgotten, condemned to be another statistic. Would be young and
Cue timeskip, and everyone starts going their separate ways but keep in touch. Tony goes "I'm an adult now, I'm fine" to his mom, and like 5 minutes later gets kidnapped by AIM. [AIM plotline, go! onto the next installment]
bringing Howard Stark in for anything less than as an absolute last resort. Not even then, if I had it my way."
It wasn't a fun game. More of a long con, actually, and Tony wasn't proud of the person he was becoming as he fought Howard and Obie's attempts to keep him under control, as if he was some child who they could manipulate into doing their bidding simply because they asked. [
Screw it, no time for subtlety, he was currently trapped by a bear hug by something that probably could crush his armor with their bare hands and looked to be about half a minute from breaking down in tears. This was extremely uncomfortable on a number of levels.
Peter, however, did not reciprocate— and because of it, Loki acted as a bulwark whenever they tried to disrespect his wishes.
The relieved sigh Agent let out was more than enough for Tony to make his decision. Even if his schedule was now three different types of royally screwed, he never regretting being able to help people.
found himself kicking himself for not having thought to research further on mental health during medical school because he could count on one hand just how many times he'd needed to use organic chemistry throughout the entirety of his career but none of it was of any help right now, when Tony needed him.
All of his furtive studies of how to travel through the Yggdrasil paid off in spades as he raced from one realm to another, baiting the Svartalfar and trapping them where he could and and utilizing the terrain when he couldn't. Hostile native life, the harsh landscape— it didn't matter. He lost count of how many times his magic kept him a hairsbreadth from death, one step ahead and to the left of where they struck, how many times it was flicker of will and a shockingly-agreeable Infinity Stone that kept his head firmly on his shoulders, instead of bleeding out in a Norn-forsaken land.
“Now is not the time for regrets,” Phil Coulson cut in with a new weariness that spoke of long experience. “We’re trying to prevent future disaster, not recreate it.”
Tony would've just rolled his eyes and made a joke about technical difficulties if something like this had happened. Steve would know— they'd both been tired and grimy and awkwardly standing around in the lobby while the booking clash was cleared up after their latest battle. He still remembered how close to hyperventilating the poor kid'd been when he'd seen them at first, and the way Tony'd laughed it all off and left a tip afterwards.
“Man was part of the Manhattan Project.” Director Fury chipped in with a tired look. “I don’t think I need to explain that one to you, do I?”
Natasha scrubbed a hand over her face. "From what I saw? Egoistic. Brilliant like Tony, but with ten times the self-preservation instinct and way,
It'd been awe-inspiring, really. She owed him one: she might not have been able to make it back home after her local contact sold her out, otherwise.
All in all, this gala's list of attendees was a powder keg just waiting to go off, and that wasn't even mentioning the other wild cards in the room.
Natasha elbowed Clint, then took pity on Hill. "This isn't the world we remember, Tony Stark went MIA in the '80s and we've been trying to play catch-up in the time since. Janus Enterprises was considered to be a non-entity in relation to the main mission since it came to our awareness because let's be honest, there's a lot of stuff that's different from
She leaned back into her chair, abruptly exhausted even though her tone brooked no argument. "We're at square one, less than that in some cases. As it stands right now, we're outgunned and hilariously outmatched for what is to come. You all know what's at stake, people, so do the work. Or don't get in the way when I do."
He appreciated it— right now, he just wanted to be alone right now, maybe break a punching bag or three. Just…he needed to think.
In this universe, there is no Battle of New York. No swarms of Chitauri streaming in through a portal to herald the imminent threat that was the Mad Titan, no mass casualties, no warheads launched that would drag the World Security Council under great scrutiny for considering millions of civilians as 'acceptable collateral damage'.
He'd shared some of what he'd seen last time with Loki, who'd gotten a scary look for a moment before he'd smiled brightly and said he'd take care of it.
She gave him a tired look. "Tony Stark could get annoying, but at least you could count on him to pull through when the chips were down. Reed Richards is a mess of hyperefixations that means he

meant that each time he left his cryo chamber, he recognized the world less and less. Not in Wakanda, of course; King Azzuri himself had been adamant on not hearing about his country's future for fear of risking its prosperity, and thus far his country's isolationism was working in their favor.
], and he resolutely did not want to think of how much shit Sam would give him for winding up in multiple conspiracy theories— but for the most part? It was worth it.
One thing led to another, and next thing Tony knew, he was announcing his new 'bodyguard' to the press because JARVIS had found evidence this Killian creep hadn't been working alone and anyone connected enough to access that kind of firepower was going to require...
"I said what I said." Fury smiled thinly. "Looks like our guy has some friends in high places. So. Who fucked up and tipped our guy off?"
"We need to debrief," Agent said, again, as Tony slumped against the rubble of what had once been an abandoned base and did a systems check.
He saw the Ancient One, and Mordo, but he couldn't afford to stay and chat, not when the future of this universe depended on it, because Tony had never quite realized just how much of an effect he had on the people around him and Stephen had never told him of just how important his role was when it came to facing what was to come and—
After all, one of the biggest names in philanthropy was still in the coma she'd been in after the accident— and the odds of her ever waking up were...not good. Meanwhile, the man responsible for her condition walked out of the same hospital with nothing but a scowl, a limp, and a slap on the wrist to show for his wife's condition.
In his defense, Stephen hadn't known Wong hadn't been joking when he'd said the Time Stone seemed to like him. Had thought Wong was trying to make him feel better, after Mordo's death and the loss of another Sanctum.
"What does it matter?" Steve Rogers asked, only for Natasha to snort even as the files Deputy Director Hill was holding crumpled in her hands.
"Buddy, you're not the only one running from something." Maria quirked a smile as she gave him a sidelong look.
“I see you all survived Ragnarok as well—” Loki started, but didn’t get any further as Thor bodily threw himself at him as the rest of the room started to move.
Steve got a sinking feeling as he saw Howard Stark’s sneer under the headline of the paper he had yet to read. Just one look, and even though this was a strange new world, he couldn’t help but think…
“By all rights, he’s the first one to show up and try to micromanage the timeline.” Fury shrugged. “I’d say that’s enough to cut him some slack, don’t you?”
“So we're supposed to count you as an ally, then? I don’t think so.” The Captain said, crossing his arms.

To avoid frowning, as he straightened up and set to discreetly healing himself, because— they didn’t match up. Not that he was complaining, as he had absolutely no intention of carrying on with Thanos’ plan, but…something very strange was afoot.

It took Bucky quite a bit of fast talking to avoid getting stabbed by the Jabari tribesmen who spotted him.
At that, Hill's face went blank and her shoulders stiffened, before deliberately relaxing. Then she put down her pen and the notepad she'd been writing on, and whirled on Clint.
More than once, the young Spider had laughed when the Captain returned to his team with neon-colored hair, or the archer sneezing iridescent bubbles. Personally, Loki was more proud of the small bird that had perched on the one-eyed man's coat for a week, but he did not begrudge him for it.
"Like your Man of Iron?" He asked pleasantly, a vicious edge in his smile and magic ready for whatever trap she was trying to lure him into.

The agent looked... it was as if he knew something Tony didn't. Something big and gamechanging, and if he hadn't already shown his badge and been vouched for as coming from a legitimate agency, Tony would've already been bracing himself because the last time he'd seen that smile had been shortly before the AIM clusterfuck.
Maria's smile brightened even more, and she extended her hand to shake his gently. "Pleased to meet you, Mr..."
Thor’s the one who remembers how it came to happen, but in this lifetime, it’s Loki who removes the catalyst that results in their mother’s death.
