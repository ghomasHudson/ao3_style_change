Sitting up Bucky playfully punched his shoulder, “Since when do you not know how to say anything to me. We’re best friends Steve, you can ask me anything.”
Thanks again for the comments and kudos, I’m ashamed to admit how much I love writing this ☺️ But at least i’m not alone.
Tony had to close his eyes as he let out a shuddering moan. The arousal bursting through him at Steve’s words left caused his voice to tremble slightly. “Why, just do it, I want you to. We’ve gone over our list, safe words all up and running, what’s the hold up? Just fuck me already.”
Bucky sounded contrite as he rubbed his forehead looking bashful. “I uh, guess it because we’ve been at it so long, I felt like I was gonna, you know... cum on Tony. I’m still really close and it’d take a while to get off the edge.”
He amended that statement to majorly overboard when Clint nearly fell to the floor laughing when Tony walked into the room. They were going out to meet Darcy and Jane along with Thor at the bar they frequented that night. It looked as if everyone had already gathered on the common floor except for Steve. His science bro was giving Tony a bewildered look of confusion as Thor leaned over to ask him whispering; well what Thor considered whispering, “Is it a Midguardian custom to wear your new mate’s colors? Does Jane not consider us… Uh, what’s the word… Ah, ‘dating’, since she’s never done so?”
When Tony agreed, Steve’s face grew radiant as he kissed Tony again before racing out the room to retrieve the other man. Tony made sure his expression didn’t betray how he truly felt about what Steve wanted until the other man left the room. He would rather eat his suit then watch the full Bucky Barnes and Steve Rogers love fest, but Tony reasoned he may be able to use this to draw Steve back in somewhat. If Steve thought Tony was okay with the three of them in bed, he might ask Tony to be with them more often. Tony would get more time with his boyfriend who’d still get to have boyfriend number 1 fuck him into the mattress and not have to sneak out their room for it. Tony could even ignore them if they fucked again through the night, it wasn’t like he wasn’t used to it already and hadn’t learned to sleep through the noise.
“Um, Buck… You um,” Bucky looked up to see Steve’s very red face staring at his dick as he gave the man a feigned look of confusion. “You have , um, you’re showing… Uh, you’re... erect Bucky.”
Bucky had been playing with his new interest for a few days now. It was the best luck when Tony needed a part for his arm he didn’t have on hand. This meant Tony had to order it, extending Bucky’s time with him a few weeks. Downside, Bucky no longer had his alone time with Tony in the lab so had to improvise. Seducing Tony in Steve’s presence and under his nose while challenging, was nowhere near difficult. Steve was truly oblivious to a lot of things and didn’t understand
But, when Tony heard Bucky voice say, “You need it deep like this don’t you, the way only I can do it.” Tony’s body began to shake, needing release but unable to move under Bucky to stroke himself. “I own this ass now don’t I sweet thing?” Tony felt Bucky’s hand gripping tightly at his ass before speeding up his pace, “It’s ok to want it, sugar. It’s ok if you want to be all mine.” Somehow getting impossibly deeper inside Tony, the careful thrusts Bucky began with were now replaced by the harder snap of Bucky’s hips down to Tony’s. “No one’s made ever you feel this good have they?” Speeding up his thrust, Bucky made Tony see stars. His vision began to blur around the edges and his body hadn’t stopped shaking as Bucky overwhelmed him. “Course not baby, no one will ever touch you as deep as I can.” Tony only faintly realized the voice echoing through the room was his own. Unable to focus on anything other than Bucky drilling into him, Tony was surprised when Bucky’s teeth bit at his neck. “Say you’ll let me have you whenever I want. Tell me you’ll be mine sweetheart.” Tony moaned Bucky’s name over and over again like a prayer, awareness centered entirely on the other man.
“Yeah, he was really going at me. Caught me off guard to, can’t say I know too many that can move their ass around like Tony can.” Tony was so lost in his movements, tiny moans and whimpers escaping frequently as he drew toward completion, that when Bucky’s hands touched his waist it startled him. He paused in his actions only a second as he noticed Bucky’s arms had slipped beneath the blanket. Tony’s performance was completely hidden now the blanket was tented on top of Bucky’s forearm. This gave Tony the freedom to change his movements and bounce his ass the way he wanted. “He was doing this bouncing thing Stevie, swore it drove me crazy. Just started wailing on me out of nowhere.” Tony leaned more weight down to the hands on his knees, gaining leverage to really pop his ass down harder.
Tony was nearly flat on the surface of the water, Bucky’s body the only thing concealing his plunges inside Tony as well as his hard on from Steve’s view. Bucky’s first thrusts into Tony caused his back to arch and mouth to fall open as his moans became desperate. He was pummeling into Tony so hard Tony’s back slid against the wall occasionally bumping his head into Steve’s stomach. “Tony likes for me to shove into his ass over and over again like this when his muscles start cramping. Fuck, Nmmm, yeah, can really feel those tight muscles squeezing me every time I hammer them apart.”
. Codependent Dom’s lived off their Sub’s approval, adjusting themselves to whatever their partner needed. Because of this where often called the chameleon’s of the Dom world, able to service pretty much all the Sub types. Service Dom’s needed to have someone to take care of; giving them the love and stable environment they need to feel safe and cherished. Authoritative Dom’s loved being in control and exerting that control on their partners as well as others. These were the Dom’s that could make a Sub fall to their knees with just a look.
He gave Steve a disinterested shrug trying to hide the fact he wanted that more than anything right now. “If that’s what you want I’d be ok with it. Maybe not anytime soon though, I’d need to get to know Bucky better first.”
The third time however, all of the team had been in residence as Tony began to feel the shaking start in his hands. Locking down the lab, he had been there for 2 days. Jarvis was continually telling him about Natasha and Clint asking if he was okay and Bruce had been constantly tapping at his door. On the third day, when Tony ignored Thor banging loudly on his lab door saying, “Stark, I need assistance with sending electronic mail to Jane. Is this some message sent with electricity, can I just use my powers?”, that the four of them had enough of Tony’s disappearing act and called in reinforcements.
Bucky bit at Tony’s lip as he looked up at Steve saying, “I completely understand why you don’t like to top with me now. Not sure anything can hold a candle to having him squirming on your dick begging for more.”
“Ok, Tony looks like he’s about finished with what he’s doing but knowing him, he’ll try to start something else. Don’t know if I’ll be able to stop him until you’re back.”
Laughter still in his smile Steve wrapped an arm around Tony. “I told Buck he could take one of the guest rooms, up here with us. There any one specific you want him to use?”
“Fuck yeah, AHhh, yes, it’s coming… God Bucky don’t stop, Uh, coming apart for you…” The slaps of their bodies coming together echoed through the room, Bucky thrust so powerful he shook Tony’s body with each impact. “God Bucky, so far in... uhh, hammering me so good...” Tony was on fire knowing Steve was watching Bucky fuck him so well but was thinking Bucky was pounding a hand on Tony’s back.
Tony threw up a hand pointing to Clint exclaiming, “Now that would have been a way more believable answer.” Tony tossed over a smirk, “It also would have been a hilarious one coming from you. Do you even have sex? Have you even had sex?” He gasped as something as came to mind. “Oh God, please tell me you’re not a virgin. Oh my God… You are aren’t you?”
Bucky let Steve continue as he saw Tony erection begin to flag after about 10 minutes. Looking at the smaller man’s face he smirked, Tony eyes were closed trying so hard not to lose it now that Bucky wasn’t touching him. Seeing Steve growing frustrated as Tony dick lost more and more of its interest Bucky advised, “Why don’t you try eating him out and giving him a few fingers?  Sometimes you need to switch things around depending on what your partner is feeling and needing at the time.” Bucky really wanted to hold Tony open. He hated that Steve was maneuvering him into any position, but knew his plan wouldn’t work if he touched Tony in any way.
That was pretty much the beginning of the end. Tony found himself alone more and more often, listening to the guttural cries of each man flooding the penthouse more and more often to the point he started to avoid it and just shut himself in his lab to work. After coming up for air one day, hoping to catch Steve and get some alone time, Tony saw them together for the first time. It had been about three months into their arrangement and Tony was growing a little tired of being in second place. He had already told himself that he would break it off with Steve a few weeks ago and had tried several times. Problem was every time he tried to talk to Steve, Tony would receive the biggest smile when he walked into the room. Steve would look at Tony as if he missed him more than breathing, and Tony could never find it in himself to make that smile disappear.
When Tony let out a loud gasping mewl and shuddered beneath Steve, he broke their kiss. Raising his body to a kneel, Steve separated their bodies as swiftly as he did their mouths but kept the tight grip he had on Tony’s wrists. Breathing hard with arousal, Tony looked up to Steve who looked completely composed. If not for the large evidence Steve was sporting Tony would have sworn he was completely unaffected by what just happened…
“Cap, what are you doing here? Actually, how are you here… The lab’s still in lockdown… Did I lift the lockdown? I don’t remember lifting the lockdown…” Mind drifting as he scratched his head in confusion, noise still fogging his brain making intelligent deductions hard, he looked up asking, “Jarvis did I lift the lockdown?”
Fuck this, Tony Stark did not get jealous. Thirty minutes later, when Tony was trying to signal their waitress for another drink, Natasha slapped his hand down giving him a hard look. “No more Tony, you’ve had 7 shots in the last 20 minutes. You should let those soak in first, then you can have another.”
He watched as Steve grew red with embarrassment, groaning out, “I can, I… Should of made him come before I did. Please Bucky, just… Uhh let me touch… I’ll try again please…”
would have been angry at Tony’s obvious doubt in their abilities. Steve however would never exude anything but a calm demeanor. “You wouldn’t since no one explains anything about Rare Subs anymore. You’re the only level that gets it,” He smirked asking, “I’m sure you can guess why that is, can’t you Tony?”
Tony’s voice was low as he spoke, his throat sounding dry and scratchy from taking Bucky so far in. “God yes, so ready… Please, I need…”
Bucky didn’t give him any words, just picked the man up and carried him to bed. The next morning Tony awoke to see Steve tied and gagged naked in a chair in front of him, erection strained and dripping, as Bucky was sliding inside him from behind. “God Stevie… He’s always so tight. Too bad you don’t’ get to feel this anymore.” Tony let out a low moan, gaining in volume as Bucky bottomed out inside him. He whined at the feel of Bucky leaving him, feeling empty for a moment. Chuckling Bucky said, “Don’t worry doll, we’re just getting started. Gonna ream into this ass into you can’t walk straight.”
When Steve looked down at him again, expression hesitant, Tony brought a hand up to his cheek caressing it. “Hey, you know you can ask me anything. I love you so it kinda makes me happy to make you happy. Besides,” Tony paused smirking up at Steve, “There is a very small amount of things I haven’t done in bed and even less I didn’t like. The odds are definitely in your favor that what you want I’m totally down for.”
“Thank you, see… Nat agrees with me and she’s not allergic to working out, it’s not just me who thinks you’re weird.”
The problem wasn’t that Steve didn’t enjoy sex with Tony, the problem was that Tony’s sex drive had diminished over the years. He still enjoyed it, especially with Steve since he loved the man, but usually Steve would have to coax Tony in the mood. Being that Tony’s body was getting more sex than it actually needed; Tony hadn’t initiated sex with Steve since that first month they were together. It often made Steve feel that he was pressuring Tony when in actuality Tony felt the exact opposite. He loved that Steve wanted him that much so even if he wasn’t in the mood, he felt desired and loved to the point he wanted to make Steve feel as good as he made Tony feel. If Steve’s moans and cries of ecstasy when inside Tony were anything to go by, Tony had been doing a damn good job of it to.
Shaking his head no, Tony turned to speak to Bucky directly. “Nah, anyone of them is fine. All of them have the basics already stocked but the one across from our has the biggest bathroom if that’s your thing. Just take your pick, Mi casa es su casa and all that.” He gave Steve another smile and kiss before saying, “I’m going to head back down to the lab. Just came up to say hi when Friday let me know you were here. You can both come down whenever you’re ready for me to look at Bucky’s arm; I’m not working on anything I can’t pause.”
The last dry orgasm was almost as painful as it was pleasurable. It ran through Tony as Steve gave his whined agreement at Bucky’s words to him. Tony was nearly vibrating as shockwave after shockwave kept shattering through him, body twitching uncontrollably at Bucky’s continued assault.
Seeing Tony was about to come again, Bucky began to slow his fingers, angling away from Tony’s prostate as he denied Tony another climax. He leaned down to devour the other man’s moans of protest briefly, loving the feeling of Tony’s lips shaking against his own along with the rest of his body. “Mmm, I don’t know sweetheart, love the feel of you shaking against me. But maybe… Maybe if you tell me why you love me inside you so much, why you always come so hard over and over on my cock, I’ll finally let you have it.” Bucky stared down into Tony’s brown eyes as they began to tear up in frustration. “Can you do that for me sugar? You do and I’ll give it to you like you need it, I’ll finally let you come.”
Tony gave him an over the top look of gloom. “I’m talking about how you’ve been sneaking out of here every day to see this ‘Sam’ character. Is it because I’m older? That’s it isn’t it, you’re trading me in for a younger model.”
Tony watched as he walked away, hating the warmth the filled him when Steve confirmed Bucky’s words. Before they went to lunch, he told Steve he needed a moment to talk with Bucky alone. He gave the excuse of wanting to make sure the other man was really okay with the new turn of events. Cornering Bucky in his room, Tony told him to tell the truth about everything. Bucky didn’t even feign ignorance and just told Tony the truth wouldn’t make him happy, but that he’d tell him if he really wanted know it all.
As Bucky leaned down to kiss him Tony knew he’d never been happier. Bucky may be the devil, but Tony knew he loved him more than anything.
Steve smiled back, no doubt with the same thoughts, as his hand trailed against Tony’s cheek. “Good boy,” His smile widened as he felt Tony’s skin ripple beneath his fingers at the praise. “Use it if you need to baby. Other than that, you’re mine for the rest of the night. You’re gonna be my plaything and I’m gonna use you however I want.” Lowering his mouth to kiss and lick the skin of Tony’s jaw beside his ear he continued on saying, “But you feel free to make all the noise you need to while I get acquainted with every inch of my new toy.”
Bucky had been sitting in his room finishing a cup of coffee when Steve walked in asking if he could talk to him for a moment. At Bucky’s nod the man came in to sit cross legged on Bucky’s bed facing him. “What’s up Stevie, everything ok?”
When Tony finished, he wanted to sag in both revulsion and relief. The first because of how much he’d told Steve by the time he was done, the second because Steve was again right. He did feel as if a weight had been lifted off of him for the first time in 16 years. Tony didn’t even register the stray tear that fell until Steve’s hand cupped his face, thumb brushing it away.
Tony looked up at Barnes, feeling somewhat uncertain but hiding it. He’d been feeling uncertain ever since Steve had moved to reveal all of Bucky to Tony. Unconsciously Tony had been avoiding ever looking at Bucky’s body to closely.  So even though he’d walked in on him with Steve multiple times, he’d never actually seen the man’s dick before. Looking at it now, well Tony was never a size queen and Steve at 9 inches was the biggest Tony had ever had. Seeing that Bucky was a lot thicker and at least 4 inches longer had Tony hesitant to continue. Not willing to back down or show he was nervous, Tony as usual used sarcasm to hide his apprehension about the very large cock pressing against his opening. Giving a fake yawn Tony told Bucky, “Go ahead and try your best Rambo, I’ll try not to fall asleep before you’re done.”
Looking amused Steve raised his eyebrows at Tony. “Just because I don’t parade a string of Subs through here for all to see doesn’t me I’m not getting any. I happen to come from a time when being gentlemen also included being discreet. What I do or how I make a sub feel is between me and the sub I’m with.”
Tony stared at Bucky, his own blame for the present circumstances adding fuel to the spark of anger he felt rising up as Steve left. Tony may have whispered his next words, but he spoke with enough aggression that he may as well have been yelling. “Are you out of your mind?” He stood and continued railing into Bucky while the other man just smirked conceitedly back at him. “This is completely your fault and now you want to drag Steve through the grinder to what exactly? You want to prove how much better in bed you are than him? Want to prove you can make me cum harder than he does? None of that matters Bucky, I still love him and I won’t leave him for you. I won’t hurt him just to boost your,
“Thanks, I am pretty beat.” Steve laid his head back looking to Tony. “That ok, Tony? Know you love my hands,” Steve said smiling, “But I’m sure Bucky’s doing a great job.”
It had been two weeks since Steve had walked into his lab before Tony finally snapped. The dominant had been a constant addition to Tony’s environment everywhere he went. Every time he looked up Steve was around, always sitting next to him in meetings and movie nights, never leaving Tony alone in his lab for too long before making his way down as well. Looking over to where he sat on Tony’s sofa, sketching quietly while Tony worked, the Sub threw his hands up in frustration.
Steve’s orgasm surprised him as he gave a squeaked moan that became a long loud grunt, followed by a steady stream of apologies to Tony. As Steve collapsed on the bed beside them Bucky pulled Tony’s mouth off of him as they both looked to Steve. “Sorry Tony, I uh, guess Steve will take care of you later?”
Tony glanced down with hooded eyes at the devil between his thighs, hating the man for being able to play his body like a master musician on his preferred instrument of choice. “I um, like the way he’s teasing me. Touching everywhere but where I really want.” Licking his lips Tony glanced over to Steve saying, “It makes everywhere else he touches that much more, Oh fuck…” Tony’s words trailed off as Bucky’s tongue roamed across his perineum, grazing the root of his cock. He threw his head back shuddering as Bucky gripped both hands on his hip.
So he watched Bucky sit back on his feet between Tony’s legs and his hands traveled Tony’s thighs, he hoped they’d like being together. Steve knew if they didn’t, he was going to lose Tony and his heart ached at the thought.
“All right baby, you asked for it.” Bucky said to Tony smiling down at him arrogantly and with a small amount of awe. He pulled out before thrusting back so hard Tony slid up the bed causing the latter’s eyes to roll back as his back arched from the sensations.
Gripping Tony’s hips to still his moving, Bucky said, “Here, think I can work it loose of I pound in that area, gotta beat myself in there deep as I can.” Bucky then lifted Tony’s ass from his lap beginning to ram his cock into Tony.  “Yeah, knew you needed me to really pump into these muscles. Think I’m really getting all the way in there now, hitting this like you need it. Can feel the knots loosening and coming apart... you feel it coming to right Tony? You feel me hammering in there, forcing that muscle to come apart for me?”
Some of the anger began to fall from Nat’s face while Tony spoke but her expression was still hard as he continued on. “I know what your relationship means to you and Clint, and I hope and believe you know I’d never intentionally disrespect it. I’ve hardly ever felt envious of anyone, but what you and Clint have… Whenever I see you two together, it always made me want something that special to. What you have is… It’s beautiful, and I’m sorry I made you ever think I believed otherwise.”
Leering at Tony he said, “Sugar, it would be my absolute pleasure.” Seeing Steve take another condom out of the box to hand over, Bucky shook his head at him before turning to chuckle arrogantly to Tony. “There’s no way those are going to fit on me Tones, so if you want to take a ride,” Bucky paused stroking his shaft from root to tip, “It’s going to have to be bare.” Rising to his knees, Bucky leaned over to where Tony was laying across the edge of the bed and brought their faces together. Still deftly stroking the length between his thighs, Bucky gazed heatedly into Tony’s eyes as he asked, “Do you want me to take over now sweetheart? It’s entirely up to you, but I can’t think of anything I want more than being inside you right now.”
Tony gave them a smile tinged with sadness as he shrugged. “It’s not all your fault. Everyone I’ve ever been close to never put me in first place. Dad, Mom, even Pepper, they all had something they wanted or loved more than me.”
Feeling Tony’s body unconsciously laying in his arms, Bucky realized the other man had fallen asleep. He laid the man in his bed beneath the covers and climbed in beside him after retrieving the journal where Tony dropped it. Steve getting the message from Fury had been unexpected but Bucky quickly took advantage of it.  Knowing Tony would return the journal to him once he left it, Bucky left his door open and waited for Tony to look in.
Movements unhurried, Bucky made his way to stand in front of Tony. He stopped just short of touching Tony’s body with his own, causing a tremble to glide down the smaller man at the heat coming from Bucky’s nearness. Tony closed his eyes to block Bucky’s form from his view as he ran a hand over his face. Unfortunately, the action did nothing to keep the deep soft spoken tone reaching his ears.
Steve lay with Tony wrapped in his arms, literally fucked into exhaustion, as Bucky settled on the other side draping an arm across them both. His eyelids were heavy as the tiredness from tonight’s exercise seeped into the forefront of his mind. Steve found himself unable to drift away like he wanted as a question kept rolling around in his head, demanding an answer. Lazily opening his eyes to settle on Bucky face behind Tony, he nudged Bucky’s chest with one of the fingers trapped between his and Tony’s bodies.
“You were just complaining your feet hurt. All the work you’ve been putting in my arm, this is the least I could do.”
Bucky had kept his promise to Tony that night, never increasing his tempo and lazily plunging into Tony. He edged Tony the entire time, bringing him to the brink of release before dialing back. Tony was a ball of shivers down overstimulated nerve ending by the time Bucky let him come, morning light shining in the room.
Steve just shrugged his shoulders at them. “Don’t really do much of anything else, when I’m not at SHIELD I’m here, when I’m not here I’m on a mission. Throw in charity events, other Avenger or Captain America appearances I have to make and the occasional bad guy taking over the world… When am I supposed to make time for anything else? Working out relaxes me.”
Steve stripped him slowly, as if he hated to remove every article of clothing but couldn’t wait to unravel the prize beneath once he’d done so. He went to remove the dog tags once he’d finished with Tony’s clothing, but after a moment of indecision while holding them tightly, he decided against it laying them back against Tony’s chest.
Tony’s cheeks colored as he gave a slightly flustered answer back, “Reassurance, structured atmosphere… C-Control and, and…” Tony had to cough as the fourth word seem to lodge itself in his throat, “…And Discipline.”
down there. Able to work a lot better if I’m on top, really pumping into all the spots you need me to hit. Plus, with the way I need to hammer into right now, its going to take a long, long time to manage. You’re definitely gonna want to be comfortable with the way I plan on making you take whatever I give until I’m all done.”
Tony was shocked when Bruce spoke not even lifting his head. “See that it doesn’t.” He hadn’t given any indication he’d been listening and Tony thought he hadn’t been paying attention. He did finally look up, staring over the rim of his glasses to Steve when he said, “I’d hate to let the other guy rip you to pieces after Nat’s had her fun.”
The other man smiled back in gratification once Tony finished. “That’s right, and if you think back on what happened, you’ll realize I gave you all of the first 3. White noise is triggered by a sub’s body not getting what it needs, once you finally get those things your mind stabilizes.”
Tony’s dick went from soft to hard in about 2 seconds. Swallowing down a moan his eyes fluttered shut momentarily as a shiver worked its way down his spine. “Why?”
Tony rose up, sliding what he managed to get of Bucky’s cock back out of him before coming back down and taking a little more. He repeated the action again and again, eyes glazed over as he stared at Bucky. His moans and whimpers getting little louder each time he settled himself back down. “Uh, Bucky… Tony, can we… Can you stop so we can talk first?”
Bucky began rolling his hips down finally beginning to thrust in and out albeit still far to slow. Tony felt stretched impossibly wide as Bucky kept moving, kept going so deep. From this position Tony could now see Bucky’s cock sliding in and out of him. He could see Bucky rolling his hips and testing different angles, categorizing Tony’s reactions again as he’d done before with his hands.
“Why the hell have I never heard of this, I haven’t read about or overheard any other Sub say anything about getting ‘White Noise Syndrome’? There are sub’s everywhere that ignore their instincts all the time but I’ve never seen them get like I do. What gives, are you making this up?” Tony threw back, tone growing more mistrustful with every question.
“Oh Bucky, I never… Never thought about how that would make you feel. I’ve always loved all of you, never thought that maybe there were pieces you didn’t love of yourself.”
Steve had explained to them that he didn’t mind them having sex together in the future, but wanted to try to bring them the same satisfaction they’d found in each other before that happened. Tony was so relaxed he probably would have agreed to give away his company without too much of a fuss so agreeing with Steve’s request came easily. He hadn’t even heard Bucky’s response when he closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep, finally giving in to the drowsiness he felt.
Pinning him with a hard stare Tony asked, “How did you do it? How did you put me to sleep when I’m never able to rest like that? Even Rhodey and Pepper have never been able to help me sleep when I’m that far gone…” Steve finally put his pencil down and focused on Tony, continuing growing more agitated with each word he said. “…And why the hell are you even down here? Just because I let you help once doesn’t mean I’ll submit to you. I’m not your damn Sub so why the fuck are you always around?”
The dark expression on Steve’s face didn’t lighten at Tony’s words like he hoped it would. If anything, Steve’s expression grew more threatening as he gazed into Tony’s eyes. “I see now… Here I am, making plans to take my sub out and show him off. Let everyone see how the most beautiful person in the world chose me to be their dominant. Then I was going to come back here, lay you on my bed and take you in all the ways you’ve been asking for. But you just couldn’t help pushing for it, could you baby? You went to Nat asking her for a way through my control, and now I don’t get to show the world know you’re mine just yet.”
Steve chuckled, causing Tony’s cheeks to burn when he said, “Hm, I’ll try to remember that for the future. For now, stop trying to plead your case and just eat.” He placed another piece to Tony’s lips beckoning for him to open. “If you apologize and tread lightly with Clint for a few days, Nat will get over it.”
Bucky stared across the restaurant at Steve and Tony as he pressed the button on his remote to increase vibrations. Bucky saw the drink in Tony’s hand wobble minutely, the only reaction the man gave besides the slight flush in his face at what was happening. Tony had surprised him asking for the truth, and Bucky had surprised himself by actually giving it to him. He’d done something he’d never done with anyone else and laid all his cards out on the table, absolutely no assurance of the outcome. Tony sat in silence for a few moments after Bucky had finished, leaving him in suspense at what the engineer would do next.
He had started to rut against Bucky’s cock, still wet from Tony’s mouth, and gave a high pitched whine when Bucky stilled his hips. Flipping them over Bucky lay Tony on his back, his head partly off the edge of the bed in front of Steve. Grabbing the lube he quickly spread it over himself before lining up and pushing at Tony’s opening. “Don’t worry sweetheart, I got you. You’ve been so good, gave me everything I wanted.” Tony let out whimpering ‘yes’ as Bucky slowly began to work all the way inside him. “So good baby, always so good for me. Gonna give it to you like you need it now sugar… Fuck yeah sweetheart squeeze me just like that, fuck so good… Gonna make it so good for you.”
“Ah ok, that makes more sense,” Tony said nodding his head before he stopped and began blinking his eyes up at Steve, “Wait no… Actually it really doesn’t, how did you get ahold of Pepper… Why did you get ahold of Pepper? Oh God, the world’s ending isn’t it? Zombies are everywhere outside and trying to get in to eat us aren’t they?”
Bucky lay back against the headboard of the bed as Tony swallowed his cock, watching as Steve fucked the engineer. The only way he was able to stomach the last part of that equation was the knowledge that Tony’s focus was mostly if not completely on him. Bucky knew that this “threesome” idea was the quickest and most efficient way to get what he wanted from everyone involved after he’d decided Tony had suffered long enough. Unfortunately, this also meant he had to watch Steve fucking Tony first, before he could gain the advantage over everyone he needed.
Tony shrugged back saying, “In my defense, knowing how people were back then it was a logical conclusion. You’re definitely not wading through any one night stands since you were defrosted…”
Tony’s eyes fluttered shut as small sparks ignited through him at Steve’s words. He managed to wrestle his arousal under control, but his voice still came out low, slightly trembling. “It doesn’t matter… What I want, what I feel, it never matters. No matter how much I want…” Tony’s voice grew clogged, not allowing him to say
Laughing Steve pulled Tony in close. “I meant every word.” Steve’s expression then sobered as he explained why he came. “Listen, Bucky said he’s been having a hard time for the last month. When I got up last night he was in the living room watching T.V., but he looked exhausted. Said his nightmares are getting worse to the point he can’t sleep sometimes. I wanna help him if I can, but I don’t want to leave you alone at night if I don’t have to.”
Tony felt Bucky’s cock jerking inside him as he came again, groans echoing though out the room. Doing what he normally did when Steve came before him and he was close, Tony began to reach down and stroke his cock. He knew it wouldn’t take long to get there as well, especially with Bucky’s cock still pulsing so deep inside him. Tony only managed to stroke himself twice before Bucky grabbed his hand as well as the other one to hold them above his head. When Tony raised he gaze to meet Bucky’s, their faces only inches apart as Bucky leaned down, the full blown lust he could see in the other man’s gaze cause a shiver to run down Tony’s spine.
Tony was momentarily annoyed with himself for wanting to shout out his agreement before he just shook his head. He was too tired to even try to argue anymore and knew how to pick his battles. Standing slowly, he took the hand Steve offered to him. “Fine, whatever. I could use the nap anyway.”
The End??? Thinking about writing a more risqué epilogue since the focus of this was more relationship dynamic buildup.
Laughing darkly Bucky wrapped his hand around Tony’s neck, leaning him back while he spoke to Steve quickening his pace again. “Stevie, if you haven’t noticed, your boyfriend gets easily caught up in what he’s doing.”
There was the time where needing a razor to shave, Bucky came to the living room in a towel. Steve and Tony had been sitting on the couch, Steve drawing while Tony read, when Bucky came in still dripping from the shower. Steve got up to retrieve one of their razors and Tony, resisting temptation, went back to reading the science journal he had been. Bucky broke his concentration asking Tony what he was reading, looking over Tony saw the man standing right beside him. Tony’s eyes never made it to Bucky’s when his gaze was caught by the skin inches from his face. Bucky’s towel dipped low to reveal a tiny patch of hair where his treasure trail ended. Tony knew just a little further down and he’d get to see what he’d only been imagining. Bucky called his name again breaking Tony’s focus. He attempted to cover the action saying he zoned out thinking of a project and was saved by Steve’s return from any further comments.
“Cap, I think it’s time you come clean with me…” Tony began after he sat down with his plate for dinner with the rest of the team. Steve looked up, expression concerned. “…Are you cheating on me with other friends?” Steve rolled his eyes with a sigh, “I’m serious Steve… This cuts me deep. We never said we had an open relationship, you don’t want to be exclusively with me?”
When Steve nodded his head, Bucky kissed him again before settling back in his place. Giving a sigh of contentment Steve finally shut his eyes, loving thoughts of the two men beside him drifting through his consciousness.
He drew forward even more, bringing his face so close to Tony’s; he could now feel the breath of each word that Steve spoke. “
After a week of watching Steve’s longing gazes and Bucky’s smirk back knowing exactly what Steve wanted when he gave those looks, Tony told Steve he should be with Bucky to. The team thought Tony was doing it for altruistic reasons, but in actuality, Tony’s motivations we purely selfish. He knew at some point Steve would go back to the love of his life, but Tony wanted to keep the super soldier around for as long as possible before that happened. It worked for a while, but as usual it was Tony’s issues that began to drive Steve further and further away from him, that issue being their sex life.
Tony had only been dating Steve for about 5 months when Bucky Barnes decided to show up in their lives. Steve and Sam had been chasing down the soldier for some time with no luck, when he literally showed up on their couch. The couple had just arrived back to the tower from a gala Pepper had forced on them when they received the shock of their lives. Tony couldn’t even remember what they had been talking about on the way up, because as soon as he saw Barnes and saw the look on Steve’s face when he realized who it was, well they didn’t call Tony a genius for nothing. Tony saw the writing on the wall, but that didn’t mean he didn’t want to cling to the corner of happiness he’d found for as long as he could.
As soon as the lab door closed Tony had his pants opening. He was sorry to say it only took two strokes before he came so hard it left him breathless.
Tony watched as a drop a cum gathered at the tip of Bucky’s cock before sliding down. He was so focused on it that he forgot he had even asked a question until Bucky answered him. “I could give you a list of reasons but I won’t waste the time. You already know them all since they’re the same reasons you’ve been avoiding me.” Before Tony could make any denials Bucky gave him a stern look around the arousal in his eyes. “Don’t lie to me Tony, I see the look you’re giving me right now. You want me, you’ve been thinking about me fucking that tight ass of yours since the moment my dick slid out of it for the last time haven’t you?”
It was the night of Steve’s birthday that things took a turn Tony did not see coming. He and Steve had been making out on their bed, grinding into each other while slowly growing more and more heated. Steve was supposed to spend tonight with Bucky, but had wanted to spend some time with Tony before he went to the other man’s room. It had probably been about 3 months since Tony had been without sex because Steve but didn’t want to push him if he didn’t already want it with him, but when Steve kissed him good night saying ‘I love you’, Tony couldn’t help it as he deepened the kiss. Steve had groaned into the other man’s mouth as it happened, settling Tony under him fairly quickly as he responded to Tony’s need.
When the head pressed at Tony’s opening, teasing the skin before sliding past, Tony’s cock pulsed as he gripped Bucky’s arms groaning his name. “God Bucky, please... I need it... Just fuck me, I can’t wait anymore.”
“Jazzywazzy101” - Your idea will show up in ch. 4. I was already done with 3 but really liked it and wanted to add it in anyway.
Bucky laughed as he kissed Tony again before leaving him standing there and got dressed. “Never told you I wasn’t sugar, pity you’re only figuring it out now.” Tony sat down on the bed dejected, realizing for the first time just how much manipulating Bucky truly was. Leaving out of the room, Bucky told him, “Put the vibrator in I just bought for you before you leave. Oh, and no sex with Stevie tonight, but you can blow him if you need to.”
Suffice to say, that fight on the Hellicarrier with Steve had less to do with the man himself and more to do with Tony needing to gain control the only way he knew how, by being an asshole. After the battle when they all their separate ways, he was a little grateful. Fighting beside Steve had been too much of a bonding moment and Tony knew if he got to know him he could actually probably like the guy. Then came Tony nearly dying at the hands of AIM and Thor’s arrival to the newly built Avenger’s Tower, asking for the team to assemble and help him find Loki’s staff.
Tony nodded his head around Bucky’s length in agreement and began giving the best blowjob he’d ever provided to anyone, bar none. He heard Steve’s voice coming in from over the kitchen bar behind him. From where he sat on the floor leaning against the cabinets behind him, Tony knew Steve wouldn’t be able to see anything midway below Bucky’s stomach. Excitement in his voice, Steve said, “Hey Buck look, I finished drawing up the redesign for my bike.”
Steve brought his hand up to cup Tony’s cheek while he stroked his jaw. He looked as if he was trying to figure something out when he hesitantly said, “You seemed to really like what Bucky was doing to you to. I’ve never seen you lose yourself like that before.”
Lifting his hand and sitting up bringing their heads just a few inches apart from where Tony had been leaning down, Bucky said, “Here let me show you.” Gentler than Tony had expected, Bucky ran his fingers across the side of his neck just below his ear before his thumb settled right beside it. The rest of his hand had stopped to cup the back of Tony’s neck, fingers brushing each pressure point as he spoke softly. “There are pressure points here, here, and here, that can stop blood flow to the brain. If you apply pressure to all of them at the same time, your bad guy blacks out in less than a minute. Now it does take a certain amount of force,” Bucky continued, looking right into Tony’s eyes as he incrementally applied pressure causing the engineer’s lips to part slightly with an inaudible gasp, “But I’m sure you can handle it.”
Raising his eyebrows at Steve he answered saying, “It’s be my pleasure to give Tony a hard workout Stevie.” Arching his back, Tony twerked harder down into Bucky’s lap and gave a loud husky moan. “I’ll give him some hard practice any time he wants to use his moves on me.” Tony adjusted to slide fully up and down the dick splitting him open, rolling his hips with the movement so Bucky felt every spot deep inside him. Tony heard Bucky’s breath catch behind him with the change, groaning low. “Mhmm... Damn Tony, still amazes me how good you are, especially with that circling you were doing. Think you were able to get us coming together in places no one else in the world has managed before.” Tony shuddered, body spasms causing him to clench and ripple around Bucky’s thick cock. “You really have some tight muscles here in your lower back, sugar. Steve have you never worked into this area before? I can barely fit myself in there to hit the spots I need to.”
Bucky watched Tony slump down in his chair bringing a hand to his face as the guilt settled in for what he’d done. He smirked at the confirmation that Tony was thinking of him. Placing his hands in his pockets Bucky continued on his way back up to the penthouse. He’d leave his new toy alone for the rest of the day but
Tony gave him a half smile, expression beginning to show even more guilt before he looked to the floor. “Steve… Um, maybe we should talk…”
Once they got there and Steve left to sit at the bar with Sam, the rest of the getting a booth near the window, Tony absolutely did not stalk him with his eyes. Tony only happened to look at Steve often because he was in Tony’s direct line of sight.
Bringing their heads together Steve said, “God Bucky, I didn’t know sweetheart. I’d never have… Didn’t know that’s how he made you feel.”
Tony’s world being flipped upside down didn’t happen immediately. The year and a half the team spent drifting in and out of Tony’s space had been a lot of fun. He’d learned a lot about everyone in that time period, all of them growing closer.
Steve’s eyes bore straight into Tony’s, blazing in confidence and complete self-assurance. “I’m a level 10 Dom Tony, there’s not a Sub on this planet I’m not dominant enough for. What you fail to understand, is even though I’ve left you in peace, that doesn’t mean I can’t put you on your knees for me anytime I please. I’ve seen the parade of one night stands you go through, I’ve watched the Dom’s that hit on you when we’re all out, and I’ve read your file Tony. You’ve never dated or slept with anyone other than a switch or another sub besides Rhodey, and that was years ago. You cut every Dom that comes across your path to pieces before you send them back to where they came from, angry and ashamed with their tail between their legs.”
Bucky finally took pity on him when his leg began to jump instead of twitch and his loud cries became squeals. Most likely knowing it would take a moment for Tony’s legs to work again, Bucky carried him over to the hot tub. Settling Tony on his feet to lean his hip against the top edge of the pool’s structure, Bucky looked into the water before looking to Steve as if just making a realization. “Damnit, can’t believe I forgot…” Shaking his head as he appeared devastated glancing between both Steve and Tony Bucky said, “Can’t believe I forgot to bring them.”
Tony smiled tiredly at him. “It’s ok Steve. I didn’t even know how bad I needed that until Bucky showed me.” Tony leaned back to stretch his arms and was surprised to feel Bucky still hard inside him, not having come yet. He switched his gaze over his shoulder and gave Bucky a flirty smirk. “There’s actually, uh, a couple other areas on my back that could use some of the same treatment.”
Not wanting to give the real reason why he didn’t want Bucky to touch him, Tony just accepted this was happening. If he put up to much of a fight, Steve would ask why. There was no way Tony was going to explain to his boyfriend how he was constantly aroused by his friend. As Bucky began to work the muscles in Tony’s feet, Tony began to ache and did his best to hide what he was feeling.
Tony opened his mouth to apologize and make the effort to turn away, but he was still frozen unable to do anything. His body refused to obey his mind and listen to reason as Tony tried to make himself leave. Bucky squeezed the head of his dick as he looked to Tony stammering his own apologies.
Face still a startling enflamed Tony spoke with obvious embarrassment. “I, um… I think that… Bucky really stretched me earlier… Can’t feel you… Can’t really feel you that much.”
As his eyes settle on Steve’s cock resting between his legs, he felt the stirrings of arousal. It took him a moment to realize it wasn’t just from himself. When Steve began to harden, Tony realized he could feel the sleepy arousal of the man beside him as well. “Mhmmm… If you don’t stop looking at me like that, I’ll be forced to keep you here for the rest of the morning.”
As they both came, Tony with a loud shout that echoed throughout the room, their bond cemented itself in place. Steve continued to fuck Tony slowly, drawing more cries from the smaller Sub throughout the night. For the first time, Tony felt what it was like to be submerged completely in someone else, linked to everything Steve was feeling.
Steve rolled his eyes at Tony’s dramatics from where he set next to him on the common room couch. “Just because I like working out and you’re allergic to it, doesn’t mean no one else sees it like me.”
“God Stevie, I don’t know how you take it,” Bucky started, continuing only once Steve’s hooded eyes fell on him giving Bucky a questioning look. “Fuck, he’s wrapped around me so tight Stevie, sucking me in.” Seeing Steve shudder and grip Tony’s hips with a moan as he sped up his thrusts, Bucky tipped him over the edge when he said, “God, Mmm… It’s like he’s trying to suck out every drop of cum from my balls. It’s like he can’t wait for me to paint my cum all over his pretty face.”
Impulse telling Bucky to reassert his dominance, he thought of the call from Steve that afternoon. Tony had given into him so beautifully. Bucky knew the engineer started to become turned on by the situation, finishing quickly at Bucky fucking his brains out with Steve right there unaware. After the call, Bucky continued to fuck Tony for another hour before bringing them both to another climax. He had remained hard in Tony after their first climax together because of Tony’s participation in deceiving Steve.
Tony came awake the next morning to fingers brushing through his hair. He didn’t have to open his eyes to know they belonged to Steve when the bed dipped slightly as he sat down. Tony moaned softly at being petted. The noise quickly morphed into a groan of pain as he slowly came to full awareness. He gave in to his instincts for once and moved slowly to curl around Steve, laying his head in the Dom’s lap. “God Steve, use whatever Dom super soldier powers you have and make the mariachi band stop drumming so loudly in my head.”
Tony continued to bob up down Bucky as his upper body leaned out of Tony’s view. “Wow Stevie,” Bucky said coming back into Tony’s view. He sucked hard at the shaft when Bucky picked up his coffee sipping it as he glanced down at Tony. Though Bucky’s eyes were aimed at Steve, his hand had come down to caress Tony’s face letting him know his words were for him. “That looks so good. I really like what you’ve done so far.” Tony cock began to throb and he extended a hand down palming it. Bucky began to shake his head as he gripped Tony’s hair saying, “I wouldn’t do that though. That engine looks like it’d explode if you even looked at it wrong. Don’t want to you to do all that work and not get a chance to take it for a ride.”
Bucky growled pushed into Tony twice more before stilling both their movements. When Tony up to Bucky from where his head lay on the man’s shoulder letting out a whine, Bucky leaned down to attack Tony’s mouth with his own. Breaking their kiss, Bucky pushed Tony’s shoulders forward slightly as he grabbed the blanket lying over the back of the couch and draped in around Tony shoulders. Looking back Tony gave Bucky a confused look, getting a smirk in return as hands began to rub Tony’s shoulders telling Friday to turn off the lights. As they were bathed in darkness with only the TV shining light in front of them, the reasons for Bucky’s actions became clear when Steve walked back in to sit down.
Tony came shuddering as his toes curled beside Steve’s head. He reached the breaking point when Steve offered Bucky a book of stretches he had from SHIELD.
Letting the mask he put on every morning slip away, Tony looked up at Natasha. The regret lining his face and words left no doubt the apology he spoke was sincere. “I…” Tony swallowed at the lump forming in his throat as he tried to push the words out he’d been wanting to express, “I… I’m sorry. I know… Even though I swear I didn’t mean it the way it sounded, Steve’s right. I know better, should have thought about what I was saying, and I didn’t.”
The first time he had come eye to eye with Cap, Tony had felt the urge to do something he’d never done in his life for any Dom, lower his eyes. It was a sign of respect from most Subs to any Dom in their presence, but Tony being Tony hated doing what was expected and hated bowing to societal standards even more. So when the urge hit him in the chest so hard it took his breath away, Tony’s fingers dug into his palms to fight the impulse. After jumping that hurdle, he did what he did best, taking his anger at being a slave to genetics out on the person causing it.
Tony let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding as he smiled back at Steve. “Well you were in bed with me so of course it was bound to be awesome.” Steve just laughed at Tony’s words and rolled his eyes. Tony leaned over to kiss him before leaning back and saying more seriously, “But really Steve, I’m glad we were able to make you feel that way.”
as he had originally intended, “…No matter how much I want things, I can’t have them. So in the end, it just… It just doesn’t even matter.”
To Tony’s surprise Bucky only laughed and he looked over to see the man giving Steve a dark look. “Tony was saying he had cramps up his legs through his ass cheeks. I looked it up and found out the best way to work through that is someone pumping their groin against the area. Here,” Bucky began as he twisted Tony around on his dick to face him, nearly bringing their hips to the surface. “I’ll show you how to nail into his ass the way he likes,” Bucky pushed Tony’s legs to the wall of the pool folding them to circle around Tony’s head, feet touching his own hair. Steve held them there in place again at Bucky’s demand as Bucky leaned over Tony, arms to each side of his torso between his legs.  Bucky braced the wall between Steve’s arms pushing them forward, placing Steve’s face directly above Tony’s view. “Keep holding him open for me, just like that Stevie.”
As if feeling Tony’s gaze Bucky’s eyes lifted. He began to slide his hands down Tony’s back as he moved whispering low, “Your ass should be a sin baby. The way it moves,” his hands swiped across Tony’s cheeks before stopping to grope them, plumping the flesh in his hand, “The way it feels, inside and out sweetheart.” Bucky’s head went up slightly, giving Tony a hooded stare as a look of ecstasy encompassed his face, “The way you take my dick baby, looking like it’s the best thing you’ve ever felt,” Tony gave a high pitched groan as Bucky gripped his waist, rising to meant Tony’s last roll down, “You were made for me Tony, knew it the first time I saw you.”
“Just be glad I’m here to take care of it. The skill and equipment I have plowing through Tony right now is about to blast through every trouble area in Tony’s ass. Uhhh, Oh my God, Fuck Stevie he keeps squeezing around me, think they’re almost banged out. But… uhh, fuck he’s so tight… think this will strike the exact spot.” Incoherent wails were cut off when Bucky straightened Tony’s legs and flipped him over to face Bucky, spreading Tony’s legs pushing down raising his ass up. When Tony looked up into Steve’s eyes, he could see Bucky’s ass in the air, straddled over Tony’s folded body covering him completely. As Bucky began hammer down with loud smacks beating Tony’s prostate every thrust, the sparks flying under his skin gathered to explode. Eyes rolling back, Tony’s legs started to spasm and his previous incoherent yells became screams.
Tony wasn’t sure when Bucky slicked his fingers, but one slid inside Tony seconds after he spoke. Once Tony began pushing back he added another finger whispering, “Don’t worry baby, I’ll take care of you. I know exactly what you’re missing.” Scissoring a third finger in he brushed over Tony’s prostate drawing a long low moan him. Tony’s hands were fisting the sheet as Bucky continued on listening to Tony’s pleas for him. Finally pulling out, Bucky rose from where he lay between Tony’s legs. Bringing his feet to the floor Bucky stood raking a heated gaze over Tony while slowly stroking over his cock.
After waking, he made his way down to the communal kitchen. The team looked to be finishing up breakfast, laughing and talking above empty plates. He settled a heavy glare Steve’s way saying, “What the hell did you do to me Rogers.”
Tony was being completely... Overwhelmed. Bucky managed to get a little more of his dick inside Tony those first few thrust in before he felt some resistance. He still had just over 2 inches left he hadn’t managed to get inside. Giving Tony a questioning look Bucky asked, “Is it too much or do you want me to keep going? This is how much I give Steve and no one’s taken more than him without it feeling uncomfortable.”
Tony’s squeaked out, “Yes mam,” was met with Natasha bright smile and Clint’s laughter echoing from the vents. Not wanting to raise Natasha’s wrath again, Tony suppressed the urge to yell at the archer to stay out of his ceiling.
Moaning into the cup as he swallowed half of it down in one go, he finally opened his eyes to blink up at Steve. Blushing brightly he crawled out of the man’s lap and sat next to him. He couldn’t help but be slightly embarrassed about what just happened and what was to come. He hated how blank Steve’s expression was as he watched Tony closely, not giving him any insight into what he was thinking.
Bucky’s fingers slid out and he moved Tony to sit in his lap legs open. Bucky leaned Tony back against him running a hand over his hip, continuing downward over Tony’s hardness before settling just below. Tony heard the fabric of his pants rip as Bucky whispered from beside his ear, “I can make that happen for you baby.” Lifting Tony slightly, Bucky lined his cock up to Tony’s entrance and began gliding inside him from the hole he’d made in Tony’s pants. Tony arched and shivered as he let out a husky moan, the sound lasting the entire time Bucky slowly slid him down. “I can take you apart every time you need it sweetheart,” Bucky rolled Tony’s hips forward sliding out of Tony then pulled him back to fill him again.
“No,” Bucky growled at Steve, reaching to grab his hand before it could touch Tony. “If he showers it’ll undo all the work we just did and we’ll have to start over. Here, we can just do this.” Tony was pulled over to straddle Bucky lying on his chest when he settled to lie on the other side of Tony. Exhausted Tony’s eyes fell closed and begin drifting off as soon as his face hit Bucky’s chest. Darkness creeping in, he scarcely heard, “He can just lay on me. The bed doesn’t get dirty and it’s my cum so I don’t mind it. We can get cleaned up in the morning.”
Bucky growled possessively saying, “If he needs to be moved I’ll do it. I know exactly how Tony’s needs it and where to put him,” as he kneeled sitting below Tony’s ass holding it open with each hand. Sliding inside Tony at a quicker pace though not as hard, Bucky ignited a small fire across his skin. “How does that feel Tony?” Bucky asked as he leaned over Tony’s back, hands going to grip the pool wall as he brought the faces together still bouncing Tony in his lap. “Am I working in there the way need it? Let me and Stevie know I’m hitting it right,” Tony felt Bucky lips lift upward and smile saying, “I know what you look like when you’re getting it good. Stevie’s never seen that on your face has he,” When Tony shook his head no amongst his cries of ecstasy Bucky chuckled, “I didn’t think he had. You’ll have to let him know what you’re feeling when I’m sliding into you the way you love it. That way he knows what your face is supposed to look like when someone’s thrusting into you like you need it.”
He thought of balking at the command, then of why he really shouldn’t, face turning pink as he sat down angrily. He didn’t want to repeat in front of the team what happened when he disobeyed Steve’s wishes in his lab; Clint would never let him live it down. He kicked Clint’s chair in childish aggravation, making Nat giggle as she sat down rolling her eyes at Clint whispering, “The fuck man… Innocent bystander… Thought we agreed you’d be mad at Steve.”
Damn if Barnes wasn’t right. From the moment Bucky began to maneuver Tony up and down, he was pretty much a complete mess. Everything the soldier had learned from his exploration of Tony earlier was used. Bucky’s fingers rubbed across the spot on Tony’s hip that never failed to make him shiver, pinched his nipples just shy of being painful the way Tony loved it, while the other gave a constant pressure against his throat enough to feel but not choke him.
“No problem, Stevie. Let me get dressed and I’ll get out of your hair.” Bucky answered giving both men a smile. “Why don’t you go hop in the shower and take Tony out to lunch.”
Usually he was all for dirty talk in his partners, but it was completely different when it was geared toward the man you love and coming from the man you were jealous of. It wasn’t even as if Bucky was talking the entire time, but the times were close enough together that when Tony would manage to make himself think he was alone with Steve, he’d hear Bucky saying ‘fuck you take it so good Stevie’ or ‘love the way you moan for me baby’.  So yeah, after 30 minutes of trying and failing Tony was ready to end this as quickly as possible. Tony knew after orgasm 3 Steve would be down for the count for at least a couple hours, super soldier refractory period doing only so much. He’d already come hard twice, once with Tony’s mouth while Bucky fingered him open and again after finally getting inside Tony once he’d stretched the smaller man open, Bucky fucking him slowly from behind. Tony did what he could to push Steve along to the third, squeezing around his length moving inside Tony and biting down on his nipples.
Tony left a few moments later saying he had to feel out some paperwork for Pepper. Steve eyes always seem to see right through him. Tony wasn’t for sure if he actually could see what he felt but he wasn’t going to stick around and find out.
It had been 5 days since Bucky had come to their room with his feigned nightmare, and he hadn’t touched Tony since. Tony had woke to a myriad of sensations rippling across his skin, all gathering together and catching fire inside him. Gasping softly his mouth dropped as he felt what could only be Bucky’s huge cock sliding inside him. Tony had looked up to Steve to make sure he was still asleep, then looked over his shoulder to the man assaulting his senses to whisper to him. “Bucky, please… Uhh, need you just like that… Ummm missed you so much.”
This was shot to hell when Bucky interrupted his inner struggle saying, “Or you could just call me for help. I’ve always been good at putting people in the right position, some they never would’ve even thought of. Warning you now though I can be really rough sometimes, left marks all over the last person I helped but they were really glad I stepped in afterwards.” Tony’s breath caught in his throat and his dick, which had already been half hard, sprung up to fullness. He really hoped Bucky didn’t see it and get the wrong idea, or hear the small moan the leaked through Tony’s lips at his next words. “You could even just let me take care of it for you. Works smoother when I’m in charge of everything anyway, and I always hit the right spots.”
Looking perplexed as if wondering what was wrong, Bucky watched as Steve became more undone, hands gripping Bucky’s waist as he continued his grinding slide over Steve’s pulsing shaft arousing him further. When Steve’s eyes became glazed and hooded, legs twitching every few seconds, Bucky stopped. “You know what, it might have been because we were making skin to skin contact.” Without even asking Bucky pulled the sweats down to bare Tony then lifted off Steve to pull his down to the tops of his thigh. Settling right back on Steve’s hard length, Bucky gave a clenching slide as if readjusting his weight to show Steve how much better he’d feel Bucky now.
Tony was trying to wrestle out a Steve’s grip to touch where he was staring but his stupid Dom just chuckled at his tries and held on tighter. Steve was smirking down at him when Tony gave him an aggravated look at being denied. “Sorry baby, I shouldn’t have let it go this far but…” Steve stopped mid-sentence giving Tony a quick possessive kiss that short circuited Tony’s brain for a moment. “Fuck sweetheart, I need to go. If not I’m going to wind up spreading you out and taking you apart inch by inch until I own every piece of you.”
Bucky looked to Steve, probably asking for some type of permission or confirmation, before he continued on. Tony’s ass rose up a little higher as Bucky leaned down changing the angle, hoping to get the last inch inside. He continued with the circular motions again, sliding his shaft completely out as he repeated it again and again, getting a tiny bit more inside each time. Tony had to work even harder to keep his groans at bay as he felt Bucky getting deeper inside of him.
Tony heard Bucky chuckle darkly before he gave a shuddered yell when Bucky thrust in rapidly twice before going back to his pace. “Wanted to show how this position gives me complete control of Tony. I move out of him slowly,” Tony whimpered before he moaned high at Bucky’s forward movement, “Thrust back into him hard.” Steve stared intently at them as though trying to memorize every motion as he nodded, “You can really get him to loosen up around you like this. Just keep rocking myself into him, pumping through these tight muscles until they give.”
Not completely understanding but to turned on to ask any questions, Tony didn’t fight Bucky at all as the man pushed Tony’s face toward his erection. He licked his lips as he stared at what he wanted so close, but couldn’t make himself move to take it. It wasn’t until he heard Barnes say, “Go on baby, show me how much you want it,” that he finally took the head into his mouth with a satisfied moan. “Yeah, that’s it sweetheart take me down. You’re being so good for me.”
Tony turned back to his work telling Jarvis to blast his music louder than normal. He hoped this would get the Dom to retreat, or at the very least piss him off a little. As for Steve’s last words, Tony said he wouldn’t give Steve the satisfaction of giving it anymore thought.
Clint yelled from the vents, “Then I’d hit them with arrows… Wait that’s too hard… ‘Tash’d let me go first, I’d hit you with arrows then.”
“I can’t fight it anymore, Tony. Everyday it’s been harder to keep from touching you.” Tony’s eyes opened and his heart began to race when Bucky’s hands hesitantly touched him. Eyes drawn down, Bucky slipped his hands beneath the hem of shirt and inched upward. “Let me have you baby, I know you’d be so good, giving me everything I need.” Tony’s released a small sound as his lips parted to gasp for air at Bucky’s praise. His hands continued in their slow motioned path, only stopping once Bucky’s fingertips could graze across the skin near Tony’s abdomen.
Bucky looked down at the mess he was making of Tony while driving his fingers slowly in and out of the other man’s body. He had been edging him for the past hour and Tony had responded beautifully to everything he’d done so far. After their talk this afternoon, with Steve alleviating the guilt that had been weighing down Bucky’s mind, he began to really see what was going on between the three of them. Most importantly, he started to realize how to make this work in the best way, giving all of them what they desired.
Tony shuddered at Bucky’s words as he caught Steve’s nod in his peripheral. Steve rose up stretching and giving a yawn, he then motioned with a hand toward his vacated spot on the couch. “You can just lay him down here Buck. You’re right, no way I can hit Tony that hard, can’t even stand the thought.” Steve gave another tired yawn, “I’m tired and need to get some rest, hope you feel better after Baby.” Steve leaned down to kiss Tony who sighed into it as Bucky moved his cock incrementally inside Tony.
Bucky told Tony that was pretty much the case when he said, “It’s ok honey, I’m pretty wrung out to but… Hmm, just love being inside you sugar. Besides,” He paused, pecking Tony on the lips before giving him a smile, “Kinda want Stevie there to see every time I make you come.”
The eye roll Tony got from Steve was fully expected, Natasha rising quickly from her chair came as a complete surprise. Banging her fist on the table, the fury she stood with caused her chair to go toppling over as she spat out angrily, “This is not a fucking joke Tony and I will not let you treat it like one.”
Looking up to the other man’s face, Tony breath caught when he saw Bucky’s eyes focused on him. All of that heat trapped him, and Tony found himself unable to pull away from his gaze. Bucky’s eyes promised things he didn’t even know he wanted, they guaranteed sinful nights full of being taken in every possible way. Tony was only able to break away when Bucky looked at Steve instead, bringing him up for a kiss by the back of the neck.
Originally posted here for ideas to include in ch. 3, but I’m Keeping this open since I’ll definitely revisit this type of fic a few more times. Will probably Tony/Stephen Strange and Thor/Tony while he’s dating Clint, Bruce, or Steve again, same format of no hurt feelings though the endgames may differ.
The day Steve came back from his mission, he called to tell Tony and let him know he was alright. Tony and Bucky had just had lunch when Bucky pulled him into the living room to watch TV with him. Unfortunately for Tony, the man decided he wanted to feel Tony around his cock as they did. Bucky bent Tony over the living room sofa to prep him before sitting him down to stretch around Bucky’s hardness. Bucky settled on a movie for them leaning Tony back against his chest to rest Tony’s head on his shoulder. Tony tried to sit still, even enjoyed just feeling of fullness, but every shift of their bodies caused sparks through his body. Bucky would just swat his thigh when he knew Tony moved to get more stimulation and not just to become more comfortable. Every so often Bucky would push into Tony, telling him how good he felt, before settling them back as they were.
Bucky’s words put Steve right at the edge, but it was Tony’s moaned out words back that pushed Steve over. “Feels so good, so full. Yes, do anything just don’t stop, fuck don’t ever stop. Fuck me all night, I’ll come as much as you want baby just keep fucking me until I can’t take anymore and then fuck me some more.”
With that Bucky began to move again, not stopping when Steve interrupted to say, “Tony can only come once Bucky, so make it good for him.”
… Oh who the hell was Tony kidding, he was hiding from Steve Rogers as if the man was Jason and Tony was slutty cheerleader number 3.
Tony eyebrows rose as he gave Steve a mocking glare attached to a condescending smile. “I’d only obey someone’s orders for two reasons Cap and this doesn’t apply to either. This isn’t the battlefield and you’re definitely not my Dom so fuck off, you can’t tell me what to do. If you’ll kindly see yourself to the door,” Tony said stretching out his hand towards it, “I was in the middle of something.”
Bucky hands resumed their actions. Unable to control it, the thrill of possibly getting caught heated Tony. Hearing Steve, knowing he was completely unaware that Bucky was balls deep sinking into Tony, hurdled him faster to finishing. “Hey Stevie, looks like somethings drilling deep into Tony for him to go ahead and get finished. When will you be back?”
Bucky leaned down to his elbows above Tony, whispering so only they could hear. “God, watching your body shake around me baby, watching every expression of ecstasy on that gorgeous face of yours… Mmm, you look so beautiful crying on my dick,” It wasn’t until Bucky licked the tears slipping from the corner of his eyes that Tony knew he was actually crying real tears along with guttural cries his mouths was making. “You break for me so pretty Tony… God, Uhhh baby, feel so fucking good inside.  No one’s ever been as gorgeous… Ah, fuck yeah, squeeze that ass around me baby… Ah, Damn Tony, seen nobody sexier coming apart under me as you are sweetheart, everything about you was made for me.” Bucky finished as he moved into Tony further to take shallow sipping kisses at lips.
Pulling Tony up to sit in his lap Bucky wrapped Tony’s legs around his waist. He leaned back, sitting on his feet as one hand settled at Tony’s waist and the metal one wrapped around his throat. Tony groaned and tried to lift up and ride the dick that was driving him crazy at the moment but was held in place. Bucky pulled Tony’s face to his own, turning it slightly to give himself access to Tony’s neck and ear. He had placed across both before whispering to Tony, “Now how about we see to you catching up, no more distractions. The only thing you’re gonna be able to think about is how good it feels when I bounce this perfect ass,” Tony gasped when Bucky surprised him with a slap on said appendage, “on my dick.”
