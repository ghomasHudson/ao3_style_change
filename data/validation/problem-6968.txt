“Yes, minus all that,” Steve added, lightly squeezing his hand. Tony’s smirk drew a twitch of a smile to his lips. Even Peter smiled lightly.
Tony sighed heavily and leaned away from Steve. He teased, “If no one could see us, I’d not only hold your hand but also suck your tongue into my mouth and have my way with you!”
Tony paused at Steve’s bedside as he considered taking the chair Bruce had just vacated but he forwent it and climbed into the bed beside Steve.
In Steve’s mind, he saw a glimpse of the future Peter and Wade, standing together, hand-in-hand, gazing at each other with love. Steve never told his son what awaited him in his future, but Steve knew this had to be the beginning of it.
Steve reached over and lightly rubbed his arm. He murmured, “Once he sees that Wade is serious about you too, I doubt he will throw up any more of a fuss. Right now, he’s in his protective father mode because he wants to keep you safe…but he also wants you to be happy.”
And then they were making love. Their bodies writhed and slid against each other in a fever. Tony clutched Steve’s hands and he promised him the world as he was filled with ecstasy. Eventually, his thrusts came to an abrupt stop as he came and Steve soon followed.
When his thumb touched the screen, it lit up with the last image Wade had been looking at: It had been from Valentine’s Day, when Wade had bought a ridiculous amount of roses and chocolate. The picture itself was a selfie Wade took of both of them wearing the rose crowns Wade had made himself. He’d just put them on the both of them so the picture was able to capture Peter laughing with flushed cheeks and tears glistening the corners of his eyes.
Wade leaned over and lightly kissed Peter. It was a tender and sweet kiss which made Peter pray that he was right about his aunt’s opinion. Aunt May did not know about his other life as Spider-Man. She wouldn’t know Wade was Deadpool either. What would she think when she saw him and his scars? What conclusions would she jump to?
Steve bit down on his tongue so tightly that he tasted blood. All his sacrifices he made for that shield and as Captain America came rushing back to him and he growled, "No one touches that shield but me."
“Actually, she found us,” Jarvis retorted dryly and a holo-screen opened above Tony’s workstation. The image displayed Mary standing on the ground floor. She was staring directly into the camera. Somehow she could see one of Jarvis’s near invisible cameras and was staring directly into its line of sight.
Steve chuckled and added, “Bucky, Natasha, and Pepper knew. We didn’t tell anyone else to protect the timeline.”
Tony felt a small jolt of surprise at the words but then he leaned into his fiancé and reminded him, “It was a joint effort, beloved. So, thank you as well.”
How much more would he remember being separated from his master? How much more would Natasha begin to question her masters as well?
Both Steve and Tony had stayed up and Peter had said a quick good night and avoided any unnecessary drama.
Nothing had been said since their kiss after the battle but Tony knew nothing need be said by the intense, promising looks Steve kept shooting him.
“I’m just glad it finally happened,” Steve said with a relieved sigh. He reached out and grasped Peter’s shoulder, staring, “I was so anxious for you…”
May rolled her eyes and bent down to kiss him on the forehead. She whispered, “I will see you later.”
As Peter pulled at the leaves, Bruce immediately knelt beside Steve and watched the toddler’s every move. He too was dressed similarly to Steve but he wore shaded prescription glasses and had his thick, unruly hair tucked away in a beanie. He lift his notepad and asked Peter, “Is there a reason you wanted to look at this particular plant, Spidey? Was it the bugs maybe? Or other spiders perhaps?”
So Steve was fitted for the dress uniform and the day of the fundraiser it was delivered. It was the dark navy blue that was promised and much more comfortable than his old dress uniform. Phil helped him apply the thin, rectangular ribbons. He had a number of medals that he had earned for serving his country but Steve had to shake his head at the medals. The ribbons, above his left breast pocket, stated all that he did in the color coded bars and he did not need to be anymore flashy about it.
Steve turned around and saw Bucky slip into the room with a silent tread. The only clue Natasha gave to noticing him there was her eyes briefly flickering in his direction. She did not turn her head or shift her body in any way nor did she stop coaching Peter. Peter himself was concentrating so hard on his lesson that he had yet to notice his uncle.
Tony turned around with two mugs and handed one to Steve. Steve accepted it and sipped at the dark brew with a happy sigh. Tony leaned against the counter beside Natasha and asked, “Where did you two go for the bear?”
Harry’s mom died a few years after he was born. Harry confided that after she died his father was never the same. He could barely remember her but he missed her all the same.
Tony rubbed his arm and was murmuring comforting words to him. Steve leaned into his side with a sigh. The clicking of cameras broke him out of his reverie and when he opened his eyes he was surprised to see paparazzi taking their picture.
“I know…” Steve whispered. He gently placed Tony on the stretcher and pressed his forehead to Tony’s sweaty one as he reminded him, “It hurt both of you…”
Steve smiled sadly into Tony’s flesh as he remember the extent of their relationship and some of his good feeling disappeared as he whispered, “Yeah…”
It was early, a little before sunrise, and Steve doubted the paparazzi were awake at this hour so he threw on his jogging suit and went out.
Tony leaned in and whispered, “If we did, you’d be discredited. Everyone would think you really did rape her…” Tony sighed and picked up Steve’s head with both of his hands. When their eyes met, he stated, “What you just watched is only the belief of a small percent of the country.
It must’ve shown in his face because Bucky rounded the counter and put the sandwich between them. He ripped it in two like they used to to way back when in Brooklyn, giving Steve the larger half.
He smothered his mouth with a hand to keep himself from laughing anymore but…it was all just so amazingly ridiculous, he couldn’t help but laugh.
Thor had no idea where his hammer was nor did he know that it had woken the man he would one day follow into battle.
handle anymore fakeness right now. Especially, when there were only maybe a few dozen for them to act for. He needed all of his strength for when they went outside.
Steve’s eyes searched for Peter and he found him right where he left him, only this time he had a larger mound of sand in front of him.
Steve was still smiling widely. He knew Tony well enough to know when he was fibbing. He kissed Tony’s cheek again and he rubbed his arm, stating, “Peter will be overjoyed.”
“You’re back!” Steve exclaimed. He ran over to them and embraced Bucky and then Natasha. He asked, “Why didn’t you guys tell us you would be back today?”
The smell of alcohol hit him as soon as he stepped into the room. Jarvis had protocols set up to put everything in the lab on lockdown until Tony was sober. The lab was dark and unusually quiet. Even Dummy’s slight hum sounded loud as it turned its single eye to look to Steve.
The Red Skull crossed his arms over his chest and glared at them. The monster shook his head and tutted, “Always destroying my plans, Captain.”
Sharp blue eyes glared at him and, a voice he’d heard hundreds of times from news reals, reprimanded, “There was no need to fire on him! His weapon was gone!”
During the day, they became the faces of the Avengers and helped in the reconstruction of New York both directly and indirectly. They and the other Avengers helped in the cleanup and moving large hindrances. They were the only two faces of the Avengers who were public before the attack and the only two who were okay with remaining public. The others were too used to the lives of being elusive and did not want to be on camera more than they had to so Steve and Tony became to faces of the Avengers. They mainly helped in obtaining funding by speaking on behalf of New York to the rest of the world in request for aide.
“Forget everything that I just said,” Tony gasped, adverting his eyes. Steve blinked in surprise. As he thought over the last few days several seconds passed. Tony looked horrified and had stepped back to let the elevator close.
Steve uneasily scanned the readings on Tony’s display. First Clint’s family and now this? What was happening?
“If you don’t come over here then I am going to get in my suit and follow you home and we can talk at your place. The choice is yours.”
Thankfully, he hired competent people so she was jogging in the direction of Command as soon as he was done speaking to her.
“Goddamnit,” he repeated a little louder. The news broadcast switched over to the watch on Tony’s house as all waited for the Mandarin to make his move.
They broke apart only to breathe but, even then, their eyes speared into each other’s gazes with such intensity that Tony felt his knees shudder.
He could feel the nanorobots crawling frantically around the skin of his neck, but the metal seemed impervious to their onslaught.
“Job’s not done yet but, by the juries’ reaction…I think I can positively say we are going to win this,” Marcel stated with a smirk.
They stared at each other in the amount of time it took for both of them to inhale a few quick breaths. It look that long for Steve’s hold on Tony to bypass normal.
They were not rambunctious the entire way. The ride back to the American camp took a few hours and the loud voices calmed down to whispers as a few of the scientists fell asleep.
Eddie nodded though looked sad and turned to leaved. Peter felt conflicted from being justly angry with him for what he did but also sad because he knew Venom’s pull. He knew how strong it had been to break free with the support of his loved ones. He couldn’t imagine doing it alone.
Steve silently went up to Tony, placing a holo-counter between them, and whispered, “It was Thor. When I was in the ice, he’s the one who woke me…” Tony’s head snapped up and he stared at Steve with shock. Steve continued, “Or it was the hammer, at least, he’s the reason I’m here. I don’t know if I should thank him or…”
Steve grinned and stated, “I really want to be your boyfriend too.” He kissed Tony as his heart threatened to soar out of his chest and then he added, “And I also was serious. I love you too. Always have…”
They stayed late into the night and left with promises of keeping in touch but also of not mentioning anything to the media.
Pepper’s eyes widened marginally and she gasped, “Peter’s dating?? When did this happen? Who is this Wade? How did he meet him? How long have they been dating? I can tell by the looks you’re giving me it’s been a while…” She sarcastically retorted the last bit and crossed her arms over her chest.
Tony should have been worrying over the space time continuum again…but Steve was smiling at him. Tony’s insides warmed as he smiled back at his super soldier. He leaned into his side and held both of his hands with both of his, where they belonged.
Soldiers marched in step with their jeep. Tony did not recognize any of them. Most were assigned to protect Panzer’s squad but Tony spent so much time with Steve and the others that he didn’t have much time to get to know the mechanics and engineers of the 107
That’s right, according to the files, Bucky didn’t fall. Tony did that...but how’d they both end up on the plane? Why hadn’t Tony stopped them??
“Steve is making risotto tonight and wants you to come over for dinner. Your aunt is welcome too,” Tony added, thinking of May.
Steve embraced him in reply and Tony fell into his hold with a relieved sigh. He let his face shield up so he could press his face into Steve’s neck. His skin was damp with perspiration but Tony did not mind getting Steve’s sweat on him. Hell, he was more than happy to at this point.
As more time passed, Steve grew increasingly on edge. Where was Bucky? Was he unable to follow him? Or was he watching him?
Wade blushed bright red and he looked up to see Peter was just as red. It was so right and personal and Wade probably wouldn’t have been brave enough to post it. Wade smiled at Peter and sing-songed, “You lurv me~!”
“I say twenty minutes,” Clint stated, stepping up to them in a sharp purple suit from the crowd with Natasha at his side.
“Howard-!” She sharply hissed his name but paused to collect herself. Whispering more evenly, she stated, “Don’t you dare ask me to give up both of the most important things in my life. When we married, ‘it was for better or for worse’ and I am not leaving you over a little assassin.”
It really was Steve. He was alive and was back with Tony…Better yet, they no longer had to worry about the future…
He’d slowly been growing used to the idea that everyone knew Tony Stark was his father but the thought of his two lives converging was still surreal to him.
Peter loved his father but he also loved his life. He didn’t want to change it, even if it meant he couldn’t do something as simple as getting an afternoon coffee with his dad.
By feeding Venom was better able to bond with his host. He could access the boy’s memories and intelligence. He used it to move around the city and evade capture.
Wade hadn't realized he'd been holding his breath until he released it when Peter's eyes flickered. He groaned and Wade gathered him into his arms as gently as possible.
- is just so perfect..." Wade dropped his head onto Peter's shoulder and moaned, "And now you can run for the hills after all of that insanity."
“Hey, kid!” Clint called, “There are pool tables in the lounge on the second floor. You and me. Mano y mano after the big event. Winner will be King of the Tower.”
“And there it goes,” Logan sighed. “But seriously, you know who you’re talking about right? Peter is one of the toughest guys I know. He may look like a normal college kid but he’s fought beside the Avengers, fought alone, and…he’s one of the few of us who has lost so many loved ones and
The additional bear was all black and had a tiny knife duct taped to its paw. Natasha he guessed and now he was more intrigued by her story if her bear came with a knife…
When Tony's gaze returned to the board, Steve closed his eyes for a moment and reminded his tightly compressed heart that he may be dead but he was here in the dream world with Tony.
Both he and Steve exhaled heavily in relief. Neither had eyes for the screens around them, depicting their emotional past reunion. They only had eyes for each other. Tony turned around in Steve’s arms and kissed him without anymore prompting needed. Tony’s hands had returned to him and he used them to drag fingers through his husband’s hair, scratching at his scalp to pull him as close as possible.
He heard Steve laugh and grinned mischievously to himself. He walked back to the front of the house, stripping as he did. Eventually he was only in his birthday suit and his cock was already hardening. He opened the front door and leaned on the frame, crossing his arms across his chest. Steve was standing in the warm surf and reaching down to touch the water. It was his first time in a tropical climate and he was only used to the cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Steve did not notice Tony and continued to happily marvel at the warm waters.
“My face is a pizza!” The fifteen-year-old groaned. He buried said face in his hands and hunched over dramatically.
“…Peter’s outside with the others. He has not seen you yet, we thought it best he should see you awake. You have been out a few hours. And it’s technically a new day but it’s still dark out so let’s just say its night. You’ll be happy to know you are no longer bald and have some peach fuzz.” Tony ran his hand over an exposed portion of his head where his hair was already starting to grow.
Peter grinned sheepishly and murmured, “Didn’t sleep in enough. I need to make myself a pot! Does anyone else want some coffee?”
Steve sat up sharply and looked at the digital clock to confirm. It’d been years since he slept in this late! He thought the Army had trained it out of him!
Several people pooled into the room, surrounding him and Pepper. Steve stiffly rose to his feet and glared at the obvious ringleader. The man tapped a gun against his thigh and smiled sardonically at Steve. He continued, “You can’t leave just yet, you’re the fabled ‘Big-One.’ You, America’s most recognized symbol, her golden son, her most glorious creation, you who wear her colors and sport her name. You are more important than her President, you are one of a kind,” he paused for dramatic effect and leaned toward him. He whispered exclusively to Steve, “
“What else changed?” He gasped aloud. He looked between Steve, Bucky, and Jarvis and held Steve tightly as, with a bewildered voice, he repeated, “What else?”
Venom was reacting to the danger and it was clearly no longer protecting Peter but itself. He needed to somehow reassure it that all was well and it should stop.
They climbed in the small space. It was made more for kids and teens and not two grown men, but, they managed.
His uncle began to run his fingers through Peter’s hair repetitively. Peter was instantly soothed by his touch and calmed down.
Tony leaned back onto his arm, sliding it right next to Steve’s and positioned his face inches from the super soldier’s. He replied, “Nah, they’re just fine.”
Bucky gave Steve a strange look as replayed what Steve said to him. It was so incredulous that Bucky found himself grasping for words. How could he have not noticed this about his friend? How could he have been so blind?
Steve had never been brave enough to romantically love another. The men he’d been with were clearly never interested but Tony…Tony was different and his heart knew it. His brain knew it was a bad idea but his heart still foolishly longed for a connection.
Tony dropped his head and garbled, “It-It was me –Pep – I was the one who-who hurt him. I shot him. I-I didn’t mean to but—! He can’t die. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself knowing…”
Their sources eventually came back as being viable. Zola was going to be on a train, trying to escape the country. This may be their only chance to catch him.
Steve sighed heavily and looked down to Tony. He caught Tony looking at him so he took the chance to say, “I’m sorry about earlier. I didn’t mean any of it. I don’t blame you for any of this.”
When Steve woke a second time he was in a warm bed with soft music playing in the background. It was a vast improvement from the frozen plane. His body ached but it was a healing ache. Soon, he would feel better.
Still restless with energy from the surprise attack. Steve walked through the line, checking on the soldiers.
Steve shook his head and quickly said, “No, it-it’s personal and…complicated and I knew it was coming but I just thought…” Steve bit down on his lower lip but it still trembled. He thought and dreaded the fact that he had to eventually end it. But he wasn’t ready to yet. He still loved Tony and was going to try to fall out of love and was failing miserably at it but now…
“I am your soulmate, Tony,” Steve assured the boy. He jokingly added, “Tell your dad I’m just big for my age and I’m always here because I go to bed extra early!”
“Yes, Sir,” Jarvis stated to Tony’s command and the metal doors sealed between Steve and Tony. Jarvis said, “I am sorry, Master Rogers but I cannot go against Sir’s orders. Shall I take you to your floor? Master Parker is on the communal floor and I am sure the others will make sure he will not see you until you are ready.”
Steve went after the thing on Thor’s chest. It electrocuted him and his entire body burned with the charge. He ignored the pain, ripped the device from Thor’s chest, and threw the circular piece like a discus and it went flying across the room.
“The public awaits, my Captain…” Tony said. He gently grasped Steve’s hand and drew him to the door.
Steve laughed at the overt flirtation and behind them Tony must have overheard them because he hissed, “
Tony entered the room with an air of flair, smirking cockily and raising his arms up in triumph. From across the room, Steve laughed and he was smiling just as happily as Tony was, making Tony’s heart do a ridiculous flip in his chest.
“You can’t do this, Steve,” Tony implored, taking a step toward him. He hissed under his breath so only Steve would hear, “You can’t
Coulson reached the counter where Ms. Potts sat and looked down at the visual menagerie of paperwork laid out before him. As usual, it was mostly schematics of the tower and forms that needed Stark’s signature.
“Yeah, yeah,” Bucky mumbled, knocking Steve’s hand off his neck. He teased, “Aren’t I supposed to be the one who does the nagging?”
Steve squeezed one of Tony’s ass cheeks and the man broke their kiss with a hiss. He ran his hands over Steve’s jaws with a moan and groaned, “Hold that thought –!”
Steve’s beautiful blue eyes parted and Tony could literally feel the strength of their bond and love in his gaze. They might not be physically one for long but their love always connected them.
. I'm such a douchebag and I can easily see all my flaws so it's quite understandable that Peter can see them too and not want to be associated with them..." Tony shook his head and murmured, "I care for him and have had a piece of my life missing ever since I gave him up but he wouldn't believe me if I said that..."
Tony greedily accepted her permission and lay his head on her shoulder as he unleashed all his tears. Pepper led him back to his seat and he leaned on her as the others stepped up to the podium to talk about how great Steve was.
Pepper picked herself up and groaned, “Fine, I'm going, but I'm going to send you some statements in a couple of hours that I need you to approve.”
I hope everyone had some happy holidays! I am back and I come with the promise of weekly updates! No more holidays or other fics delaying this one! In other words, we'll find out the fate of the future and these two before you know it! Thanks for reading! :D
“So Peter’s existence is going to get out soon,” Tony voiced what everyone was thinking. “Though they do not seem to know Peter is Steve’s son.”
“He knows now,” Steve reasoned. “And I doubt he’ll tell anyone, we know his big secret too!” Steve turned to Tony and said, “Plus, he seems like a guy you can trust.”
Tony must be being operated on and was given drugs because he was out of it the entire time he was with Steve.
He and Tony were working in tandem again. Tony was fought in the skies and Steve fought and directed the battle on the ground.
Tony turned under him and looked into the drawer. He shuffled some items around and then collapsed with a groan.
“Do you think we have time for a quick fuck? Because, holy shit, my adrenaline is pumping with victory and I want to celebrate,” Tony gasped into Steve’s mouth.
Steve scrambled out of the ring, his legs catching on the cords in his haste, and ran to Bucky’s side. There was a partial half-moon shaped cut on Bucky’s lip where Natasha bit him and blood flowed freely from the wound in a thin line. Bucky stared blankly at nothing and made no move to stop the bleeding or stop it from dripping down onto his shirt.
When he was testing his ability to move, the Red Skull entered his cell flanked by two of his masked agents.
,” Natasha stated, her hold on his hand became crushing. “The Academy would hunt us down to the ends of the Earth.”
The knot in Peter’s chest tightened at the thought of leaving. He took his foot out of the elevator and the knot lessened. Warmth escaped the bounds of the knot and spread throughout his chest.
Tony scoffed and rolled his eyes at the man’s joke. But Howard didn’t drop his nose and he rose his eyebrows in question as if he were wondering when Tony was going to start spewing praises.
He flushed privately to himself and stuffed a large piece of chicken in his mouth to keep from saying anything stupid.
Natasha silently faced the bar and took another sip of her drink. She eventually murmured, “My own soulmate also had a rocky past. I didn’t understand it at first. It scared and angered me. For a long time, it caused upset between us and…I wish now that I hadn’t wasted that time we had with such petty grievances…”
I aspire to be the cool uncle now. Just watch, I’m going to have him cursing like a sailor, totally tattooed, and riding motorcycles by age four!”
As soon as Natasha took over in Steve’s first aide, Bucky leapt up and hugged Steve again. This time they both unabashedly wept into each other’s shoulder.
“I admit I am trying to get him into a more intimate relationship with the V.A.” Sam joked, shooting a knowing smile Steve’s way. The jealous blob in Tony’s stomach bubbled with molten lava and threatened to spew. Why was he smiling at Steve that way? And why did even his smile have to be big and perfect?!
Yet Mary was not interested in reminiscing about the past nor was she interested in talking about her current life.
Steve gave him a slight squeeze and then brushed a light kiss on top of his head. They walked the rest of the way back to the car with Steve’s arm around Tony. Since their relationship had been born in an era where such a thing was outlawed, he automatically felt a small bolt of unease when someone saw them being intimate, but it was quickly followed by a sense of relief and joy for their future. One day that uneasy feeling would be gone and he was excited for the men they would be and the deeper depth of their relationship will become.
Bucky's entire demeanor changed. A determined look flushed over his features and Bucky stated, "That is exactly why I am going. I am going to save her just like you did with Tony."
Images of Uncle Ben and Gwen dying in his arms came to mind and an irrational terror came over him. He couldn’t lose Wade too!
Steve chuckled as he was brought back to the past, when he had shaved Tony and Tony had mentioned the substance.
Once the cloths were soaked and the water hot enough, Steve used one to wash away the excess blood. Tony sat up straighter and gritted his teeth when the cloth touched his wound but he made no noise of complaint. When he was satisfied with it being cleaned enough, Steve pressed the other cloths into the wound and felt Tony’s muscles seize beneath him.
Needless to say, the reporters were literally dancing on their toes and looked like they wanted to jump them. If they hadn’t been assigned spots to question, they probably would have pounced…
Howard pulled back and cupped his face and gasped, “Look at you! How much time has passed on your end?? It must’ve been years! Look at all that grey hair! You’re near old enough to be my father!” Tony chuckled wetly and Howard put his hand over Tony’s heart and asked, “The Palladium poisoning?”
Tony’s mouth was instantly drawn to Steve’s and he kissed him fully, cupping his jaw as he did. Steve inhaled sharply and Tony’s tongue automatically darted out for a quick taste.
Did his father somehow have the pure, Wakandan metal? Did he find another source outside of the secluded African country? Or did he find a way to construct the metal element? If so, how had he done it and made
“How is Tony? Did he contact any of you? When are we going to get him?” Steve asked once he found his voice. Guilt was constricting his throat and he peered shamefully down at his hands.
“Okay, first history lesson about the future. The meaning to the term ‘gay’ has changed a little in my era…”
“Her parents go to the same Country Club as my parents and I see her there sometimes… She’s so pretty, Steve…This is so not fair…”
Tony’s hand gently nudged Steve’s thigh and, as if he was clarifying Steve was really there, he whispered in question, “Steve?”
“How is this possible? We didn’t account for VENOM in any of our notes,” Peter whispered, keeping his voice low enough so their supervisors wouldn’t overhear.
He never paid Spider-Man much mind. He was not a part of the Avengers nor were his powers mechanical so he was not part of Tony’s field of interest.
Steve rubbed his arms one more time and then moved his hand to the small of Tony’s back and maneuvered him toward the bed.
There was a good possibility that someone could be spying on them in one of the surrounding buildings but…
Firstly, they approached it differently. Tony was in high spirits and had spent the night prior talking in the third-person. Saying things like: “Dad is now sitting on the couch” or “Dad is leaving the room.” It drove both Peter and Steve up the wall.
The junior agent stared at the footprints with shock, just noticing them. Like with Coulson, fear began to grow in the young man’s eyes. He gasped, “Right away, sir!” And then ran from the plane.
Steve bit the inside of his cheek and wrapped one arm around Tony and returned the embrace, trying to fill all his gratitude with the touch. With Peter squished between them, Peter grabbed Steve’s dog-tags to pull himself up and placed his tiny hand on the warm glow of Tony’s arc reactor. He peered curiously at the glow and asked, “Wha’s dis?”
Tony peered down at Steve’s serene face with a small smile. There was a slight flush to the younger man’s cheeks and water still dripped from his hair. He was beautiful. He was perfect. And, better yet, he was in Tony’s arms after making him come with a guileless touch.
“Last year, after Natasha told us why she was so angry at us and you especially…I thought that was it. You made no more moves toward her, heck, you did not even talk to her! Have you been harboring these feelings this entire time??”
Bucky stilled against him then lifted his head. Steve was shaking violently and even though his eyes were crushed shut, hot tears were beginning to fall down his face. Steve’s fingers dug into Bucky’s scalp and he gasped, “I’m sorry. Buck, I’m sorry. I can’t…Tony—Tony-. I know he’s gone but…” He blinked open his eyes, his lashes heavy with salty tears. He met Bucky’s shocked gaze and whispered, “I wanted you, Bucky but I-I did not know until he was gone but I
Tony held onto Steve tightly and gasped, “You were the best thing that ever happened to me. I wish we had more time…”
For a moment, he thought she was pulling away from him and his heart seized. He thought his arm had disgusted her and lamented his loss. But then she untucked her shirt from her pants and began to unbutton it.
Steve reached out to Peter and traced the tips of his fingers along Peter’s cheek, where the cut once was. His stomach clenched uneasily. In all the drama that occurred in the wake of Ross’s attack Steve never once paused to think about the healed cut or what it meant for his son.
‘Baby boy you just made my heart do a backflip and land with a split. I am updating my fanfiction accounts at this very moment.’
Tony groaned, “Jarvis please explain to Steve that it is not a big deal.” How many times did he have to say it was only once a year?
Tony’s car was still at the restaurant so the walked back carrying a bag with souvenirs, their prize bears, and the dwindling remains of cotton candy.
But, when he tried to defy the Red Skull he crushed both the Winter Soldier and his mate. The woman eventually escaped his grasp and he placed her on the top of his kill list. But, SHIELD protected her and the Red Skull could not take and action unless he wanted the spy organization to take note of Hydra.
Steve nervously glanced at his lawyers and they all nodded so Steve cleared his throat and huskily replied, “Yes.”
Tony shook his head and reached out to Steve. Steve grasped Tony's hand firmly and Tony assured him, “I will be fine. We’ve seen the future. We know I will make it…”
“Bye,” Peter said, shaking his spoon in a wave. His aunt smiled at him then picked up her bags and keys and left Peter alone.
Natasha rolled her eyes and said, “I don’t know about the rest of you, but I am overdue for a shower.” She went to leave but paused next to Bucky and lightly punched his arm. She murmured, “Like old times, boss.”
“How did you get here?” She gasped. She looked beyond him to the door closed behind him and asked, “Are Rogers or Stark with you?”
Solo looked over his shoulder and saw Steve had followed him. His eyes widened in fear and Solo plunged into another group and grabbed a preteen girl. She screamed as Solo used her as a shield between them.
“That, sir, will give a major clue to your identity,” Jarvis stated. “And I recommend using shorter terminology.”
Wade snorted but he couldn’t help but agree with his wayward thoughts as he was wrapped around Peter’s lithe body.
They both chuckled and Tony angled his head away but Steve gave him one last squeeze and only then did  they separate. Pepper promptly held out his suit jacket and he accepted it from her.
It was a picture of them together. Steve had taken it himself, practicing selfies with his phone. Steve was smiling in the photo and Tony had kissed his cheek in the last second, totally catching him by surprise. Steve had playfully shoved him after and they had laughed before they tried again and Tony had actually posed and smiled in the next photo.
“…I’ve wanted to talk to you abo-,” Steve began but upon the word “talk” Tony inhaled a gulp of liquid and immediately had a coughing fit. Steve stood up and worriedly gasped, “Are you alright?!”
He flushed to himself and wondered what had gotten into him? Peter was not one to jump into a sexual relationship so quickly but he nearly had sex with Wade for the first time
The building had been abandoned and, by the plant growth and decay, it had obviously been years since it last saw any human activity. The halls were dark and dusty and, wherever there was sunlight, there were plants growing out of the floors. The first few rooms he came across were mostly empty with the only signs of life being the paw prints of mostly rodents in the thick dust.
He was beginning to fade in and out of lucidity. The first night of his delirium, he weirdly called out  for “pepper” asking where it was. Bucky had brought him some pepper from the kitchens, thinking it might appease him, but it just made him more upset.
No one noticed that one present remained unopened as the sports lovers began to debate Dodgers vs. Yankees.
“Little?” Peter murmured indignantly, pressing his hips into Wade’s again to remind him how “little” he was.
Howard moaned as he came to and Steve stopped fanning him. He lightly touched Howard’s shoulder and quietly said, “Howard?”
“I'm from Malibu, California,” Tony dryly replied. His father had never bought property out there and only owned homes on the East Coast so it was safe for him to truthfully reply this little tidbit.
Next chapter might take a little longer to get out as I am in the middle of transitioning jobs and I am working both until Friday! In the next chapter, Steve's location will be uncovered and the group will attempt a rescue...hopefully nothing will go awry. Hehehehehe >:D
....and ended up adding 4,000 more words to the story....Sooo I guess the moral of my notes is, when you give me the power to go back and change things I take it WAY out of proportion! XD
“No, but I am big on making my boyfriend happy,” Tony countered. Steve’s grin expanded into its happy smile again and Tony’s heart fluttered happily.
The bang of the gun made Steve flinch but when he felt no pain he cautiously opened his eyes. General Ross was on the ground, blood was beginning to blossom from the center of his back.
happy…because I knew I could finally be true to myself without any fear. Maybe a week later I met your father and he flirted with me. That enigmatic, beautiful man was interested in me and I was in him…so I flirted back. I was still scared. I knew there were some people who still thought like they did back in the 40s and, I, myself, still felt a need to guard the secret because of my upbringing. But here we are now…” Steve chuckled and smiled happily at Peter. “So, sorry for giving you my whole life story but…yes, I knew I was gay from a young age but I couldn’t really embrace it until I met your father and he helped me learn to be a ‘modern’ gay man until we finally came out.”
“Aw Fuck,” Tony cursed as Howard pulled it out, revealing a large crack on its side. Tony grasped his head and repeated, “Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck…” He covered his eyes and gasped, “I’m dead.”
Steve yawned again and lay his head on Tony’s shoulder. He whispered, “I’ll never leave you like that again.”
Despite his intellect, Tony was unable to name some of the items inside. He recognized the old fashioned blade, the lathering brush, and mirror but he'd never used said items when shaving. Hell, he used an
Tony slowly sat up and Steve moved with him, their eyes never breaking. Steve heart began to speedily race in his chest. Whatever Tony had in mind, he wanted it. He wanted it so bad.
Rogers reached into his jacket and pulled out his phone. He tapped the screen and said, “For the last three years, Tony has had the biggest fodder for media publicity and he has yet to even hinted at it.” Rogers held up his phone and on its screen was a picture of Rogers and Stark kissing. Peter’s jaw dropped and he looked to Rogers to see if he was pulling his leg but he looked dead-serious.
He stared at him mostly, categorizing his quirky features that he liked most about him, remembering his expressions when they’d made love or just laughed together, and worrying over the changes that had occurred and marked him as unwell. Since being bedridden, Tony hadn’t shaved and had his beard growing back in. He looked closer to the man he had originally met, stepping out of the Iron Man suit and into Steve’s life, forever changing it.
Just like he expected when coming to see Tony, his heart crumbled, but for a reason he in no way expected. He was a dead man walking…because Tony was right. They had to stop Hydra. The future was bigger than Steve, Bucky, or Tony…
The Soldier never realized he could feel so happy. His memories may be scattered, but as long as Natasha was in his arms, he knew he would feel whole.
Switching languages for secrecy, in Mandarin, he told his AI, “If I die, find a way to take my body to the future whether it’s through the time machine or by just waiting out the decades…I want my friends to know what happened to me.”
The ground was rushing toward him. He closed his eyes and Tony’s visage came back to him. Peggy called out his name, but he did not reply. He concentrated wholly on his memory of Tony until his body was violently thrown forward and his consciousness was cut off as the plane broke apart around him.
The answering silence on the phone made Steve second guess calling Bucky. Maybe he was regretting ever taking Steve to that hotel. Bucky answered slowly, “…Brooklyn Bridge. The usual spot.”
Finally, Steve found himself on top with Tony beneath him. Tony slowly raised his legs wrapped them around Steve’s waist. He dug his heels into Steve’s ass and Steve bit back a moan.
Peter was always grabbing at his dog-tags, they were his safety item. Most children became attached to a toy or blanket but as soon as Peter met him he was obsessed with his dog-tags. Maybe they reminded him of meeting Steve for the first time or maybe he just associated them with Steve in general. Ultimately, his son found comfort in them and he gladly leave a piece behind for him to be consoled by.
!!! Just making conversation! If I don’t talk I moan and I moan like a moose in heat. It ain’t pretty, but you’re pretty,
Uncle Bucky frowned then said, “Your pops wants to make sure it is really her then you can see her.”
Steve turned on his phone and saw he had a few missed calls. He checked his inbox and saw he missed calls from everyone on the team…
“…You two are no longer together?” Coulson questioned, surprised by the new development. He was supposed to know of all the significant changes in the man’s life. He was going to have words with Natasha.
Tony blew him a kiss and Steve caught it and then pressed his hand to his mouth with a private smile just for Tony.
Tony did not notice but Bruce had slipped out to give them some privacy as they lamented together. The only reason they stopped was because Peter’s body could not take it anymore and he fainted.
His heartbeat was slow but it was there. He was alive but barely. She sighed in relief and stated into her communicator, “I have him.”
Steve nodded and hope finally gurgled in his stomach. Tony was correct. Anyone in their right mind would see that woman was unhinged. Maybe they would beat the prosecution in the hearing after all.
, a voice whispered in the back of his mind. A sickening feeling accompanied it and Peter leaned heavily into Wade as nausea washed over him. Why would he think like that? His dad just didn’t understand his relationship with Wade. This dinner was going to help. It had to help…
His being added to the mechanics’ division also went swimmingly. Panzer, the guy in charge of mechanics, took him in with no questions. Once he realized Tony wasn’t half bad with the more technical stuff, he got to help with more interactant machines.
Tony swore as a suit started to materialize around him, starting where his hand was connected to the wall. He looked to Peter and gasped, “What is this??”
Everyone was sitting on the couch and they all called out greetings. Clint raised his arms like a referee, signaling goal, and announced, “The honeymoon faze is complete!”
He quickened his step as he approached the cafeteria and was nearly running by the time he reached the doorway.
He led despite his anxiety. He gave orders and directed the team while fighting off bots and worrying about Peter. They defeated the bots but thanks to the sudden arrival of group of people calling themselves “The Fantastic Four” Doctor Doom got away.
At first, he thought the laughter that echoed down the hall was the same that echoed in his memories.
The hope he once had for returning home was unraveling as quickly as a falling ball of yarn. He was never going to see his friends again. He was never going to say goodbye.
Tony suddenly pushed Steve onto his back and sat on his hips. Steve was reminded of their nude states as Tony slowly pushed down onto Steve’s genitals in a way that was definitely with a purpose.
He was able to down them all in a few seconds and threw the last one through one of the walls. A sort of warehouse was beyond that and he jumped through without a second thought. Alarms started to go off and Steve’s heart was beginning to race from adrenaline.
Unfortunately, the technology of Howard’s era was not advanced enough to keep up with his formulas. He started to sketch out ideas for an arc reactor, but he knew his son would be the one to actually see it built. He did what he could for Tony. He wrote out all of the formulas, sketched out mock ideas on using the reactor to create the element but…in the end, he had to wait for his son to invent it. He removed the pages from the notebook and gave them to Peggy for safekeeping. She swore they’d be safe with her and she would store them in older personal vault at SHIELD until they were needed.
Steve returned to his son’s side and his little boy continued his stretches but quickly threw a number of questions at him.
Peter stared at Tony in shock but a storm of emotions was building up inside of him and was going to break through the stoic veil any second.
He automatically checked the barrel, the ammunition, and the safety switch. All was right. The gun was deadly and she had given it to him without any qualm.
Steve turned his head and lifted it slightly so he was looking up and in the direction of Hydra. He couldn’t see much but foliage. He yelled out, “Status report!”
Jarvis, whom Tony unconsciously listened for, did not reply as it wasn't going to be created in another 40 some years.
Steve’s hands roamed freely over his soulmate’s body, learning the new territory he’d never touched before and also learning what made Tony’s breath hitch just right. His fingers dug deep into the muscles of his thighs but also teased the gentlest of touches just above his groin.
Her eyes narrowed at the flowers then her gaze shot to Bucky. Steve’s friend had still not raised his gaze but he seemed to shrink under her glare like he somehow knew it was there.
Peter made grabby hand motions toward the framed photo with his pumpkin covered fingers. Steve laughed and handed the photo back to Tony and scooped up Peter, murmuring to the boy, “You need to be washed up.”
The smell was much worse than he remembered and no one had clearly been down there in a while. Rats and roaches scurried away from his hurried steps. He was splashing up all kinds of muck that loudly echoed down the tunnels, but they were directionless. Anyone following him would have no idea where he was going.
Peter woke late the next morning and he felt somewhat rejuvenated. His Aunt May let him sleep in to 11:43 a.m. which was amazing in itself. He stretched, relishing the feeling in his well slept body. He was starting another semester at NYU next week and he was going to be getting little to no sleep during that time. He was doing a light course load this semester so he was hoping it will not be too bad. Fingers crossed.
“I think…I think when we went to the future and I used that new suit…the nanobots reacted to the shrapnel as an injury. They removed it – all of it.”
The media might have been wrong about why Richard and Tony fought...It would have been right around the time his mother was pregnant with him and his father might have taken the biological sector out of spite. That is, if Tony Stark’s story was true… Peter was not going to admit it was but… Things did not make sense, like the vital fact that he did not know any of this.
“Oh my God,” he hissed. His hands hovered over the matted blood in Steve’s hair. “Are you okay? What did he do to you?!”
Steve ran. He ran like he never did before. People lunged at him as he ran through the building, but he dodged them and focused on finding an exit over what lies they yelled.
With the first shot, she staggered back, touched, and looked down at her chest in absolute disbelief.
– before involving my father. What’s worse, you knew we had a rocky relationship and – and you forced him upon me! The way he looks at me…his excitement…it hurts because I know it’s not the man he will be with me. I am reliving so much of my miserable childhood and I can’t reveal how much of a bad dad he was because he’s so excited to see the man I’ll become!” The words rushed out of him so fast in the end that he had to gasp for breath. He couldn’t say anything to Howard, but he didn’t keep anything from Steve except…except that fact that he and Bucky were going to die soon.
“Mine too,” she whispered, scooting closer to him. Their noses brushed and their breath intermingled as they stared intently into each other’s eyes.
Tony gritted his teeth and said, “If I exit this suit, I am going to collapse and I don’t have anything to compress with as it is! Where is the chip??”
“I can have a real mattress delivered here within the hour if you don’t want to sleep on this thing,” Tony said, motioning to the tiny hospital bed beneath him. Peter sleepily followed Tony’s hand to the direction of the bed then yawned again. Both Steve and Tony paused in their argument to watch the yawn then traded knowing glances. Tony shifted Peter in his arms so the toddler was leaning back more. Hopefully, he would go to sleep soon. The poor guy must have been exhausted.
Tony stood in the center of the room with holograms, projected from Jarvis’s cameras, in a circle around him. His chest remained bare and his skin was aglow from the light from the holograms. Tony must have undone the top button for his jeans and they hung loosely off his hips, displaying the tops of his red boxers and the tuff of hair that led down to it. Steve did not give himself time to dwell on it. The lustful desire was gone from Tony’s eyes and he stared at the projections with a hard glare.
Little Stepan trotted up next to Natasha and wound his arms around her upper thigh. At five, he looked like a mini version of Bucky with his dark hair and eyes. He came as a surprise after the couple tried to get pregnant for years. Steve clearly remembered the day he was born, Bucky held him with such a large smile. Steve hadn’t seen him wear one like that since before World War II.
He’d been looking for something to do with his updated suit. The Mark 15, which he has lovingly called Sneaky, had flown to the location smoothly. It was his new stealth armor prototype with sonic dampening thrusters and reto-reflective coating which adapted the suit’s tint to the surrounding environment for its stealth capabilities. So far, SHIELD nor any of the European agencies in the area had noted his presence, even when he flew at ranges his other suits were usually detectable.
Wade’s eyes did not follow Peter’s progression but he heard Peter speak to Happy about leaving. The bodyguard must have still been there and, in no time, he heard the slamming of car doors and then the rev of the engine.
“I am a master at Junior Prom dance style but if you want to learn some actual dance moves like the waltz or whatever then we’re going to have to take a class,” Tony stated.
When he finished, he breathed heavily and kept himself hunched over. Natasha let go of his hair but one hand slid down his neck and she lightly caressed his back.
This time however, when the doors sealed behind them, Steve did not release a pent up breath…now he felt sick and feared if he opened his mouth he might vomit.
After another all-nighter, he returned to the dreamworld with a new reactor and a large smile that had been absent from his face for many weeks.
Dum Dum was sitting outside the room. He knew the Commandos had been sitting outside in shifts, waiting for Steve to step out so one of them could take over for him.
“Yes, Master Rogers,” the AI replied and the hologram over Tony’s workstation reappeared. Instead of Mary’s image it played back the grainy image of Venom stopping the mugger.
Peter sat up and walked around his room. Tony had given it to him last year. It was a place for him to call home when he was out late as Spidey or at the Tower. It was nowhere near as lived in as his place at Aunt May’s but it had acquired pieces of his life overtime.
“Think of it as a tip of my hat to you old guys,” Tony said with a grin and snapped his goggles back on. The lens magnified his hazel eyes to a comical size and Steve stifled a smile behind his hand. Tony bent over a piece of his helmet lifting a miniscule pick with a tip that glowed orange and sizzled as he worked on the more sensitive chips in the machine.
“No, well…I don’t know,” Peter groaned. “…Wade seems to think they’ll paint him as this crazy person.”
Frustration and a bitter despair spurned Bucky to turn away and rush over to Howard. The inventor had thrown on a welding mask that covered his entire face and thick gloves. In one hand he held the core and in the other a welding stick.
It short circuited everything in his suit and the suit was too heavy for him to move physically. This was his emergency suit he was supposed to only use with home invasions. He expected to need to defend against firepower like Stane’s Iron Man replica or Vanko’s energy whips. He never thought anyone would be able to calibrate an EMP powerful enough that could take out his suit and not destroy his reactor and kill him.
Peter went to the soft training mats and began to do some stretching as he waited for everyone else. Clint continued to play with his bow.
Steve shivered from the tone of his voice. He recognized it as the same one he had used by the pool. Tony would probably be 100% fine with Steve kissing him right now.
Steve bit down on his lip nervously and nodded. Tony squeezed his arm one last time before pulling away. He really wanted to keep touching him to provide any kind of physical comfort he could but he knew it would probably only distress Steve further.
Steve mumbled something under his breath as Tony’s movements jostled him. Tony melted into Steve and stilled. Steve fell back into his deep sleep and Tony started to lightly run his fingertips over the groves in Steve’s chest muscles.
Steve thought back to the bullet Bucky had shot into the Tower. It was the only other instance Bucky had “communicated” with them…What he was trying to tell them Steve could only…He flushed. God it was so obvious now. He and Tony were making out on the couch they were one step away from tearing the rest of their clothes off each other but Bucky’s shot had deterred them. Bucky said he had been always watching Steve, had he been watching them? Was the shot a way for him to stop them?
He had to be with Bucky. Maybe they were hanging on his balcony. Tony walked up to the base of the stairs and yelled up, “Guys? You there?!” He put one foot on the stair to go up and began to yell, “Can –?”
Cable looked down at the photo with a frown and speculated, “We’re missing something…something is preventing our timelines to sync. Maybe there’s something Stark didn’t do because we interfered?”
Tony felt Steve freeze underneath his touch and he smiled sadly at him and pulled back from Steve’s hand and he apologized for the kiss by whispering, “Sorry…”
Tony lightly squeezed his arm one last time and then turned to the remaining fighters. Peter looked to be struggling with the octopus man and the Goblin had destroyed the units Friday had sent out and was advancing on Wade who was none the wiser, cheerfully kicking a downed Electro.
In the span of that second’s pause, Steve felt a multitude of regret and sorrow and the foremost was not seeing Tony one last time before Steve went to Venom.
Without looking away from his soulmate and, in a small voice, Steve gasped, “Please don’t hurt him. He has nothing to do with us.”
“One day…I’d like to do like my parents did and come out, together…” Peter whispered. “When you’re ready Wade, I’d like to just yell out to the city how much I love you…until then I’ll work tirelessly with you to keep it a secret.”
Before he found Peter, his life had been bleak and filled with unfortunate circumstances. Finding his son, not only gave Steve a family but a reason to live. With Peter had come moving in with the Avengers, dating and marrying Tony, and never-ending joy and love.
Tony did not notice the smile. He looked at the two with a frown and asked, “Is everything alright?”
“Old. So old we cannot properly date it,” the man retorted. “It was degraded and could have been there for days, weeks, even years.”
Within the next dream, Tony was laying down again but was bandaged. The world around them was dark and undefined but it was not the same frightening blackness that had been threatening them earlier.
People were speaking quietly under their breath not too far away. Steve recognized it as Russian and relaxed.
“I found that on the roof late last night. I checked it to see if it could give me any clue as to where you went. I suggest you check it
Tony grinned and slipped his hand behind Steve’s neck and nestled his hand there and one of his fingers reached up and caressed the base of his hair. Steve stiffened for only a second then relaxed. To the lawyers, hopefully it would only look to be a twitch from surprise. Tony smiled warmly at him and Steve leaned into his touch and returned the smile.
Peter’s heart felt like it was going to stop when Eddie sealed the burette. They both leaned down to look at the reaction in the beaker.
Steve was anxious to see Tony – even a Tony who did not know him, as long as he could see that he was alive and well…Steve would feel a million times better. But he knew it was not an option. He would never put Tony’s life in jeopardy like that. Steve swore to Cable, “I will not risk Tony’s life.”
Tony strolled among the troops and was beginning to spot out men he recognized. He grinned and nodded to them as he passed
“Uh, yeah.” Tony stepped back and Steve and Peter came in. Tony cleared his throat and said, “Hem, welcome. Welcome to Casa De La Stark.”
“No thank you, Steve,” Tony replied with a pained expression. He wanted it so much but he did not think he could hold back. He reasoned, “We don’t want to give the paparazzi a full show now, do we?”
Peter yawned deeply and rubbed his eyes. Steve went to Peter’s bedroom, planning on changing him into some pajamas. He sat Peter on his bed and went over the dresser. As Steve opened the top drawer to his dresser, Peter sleepily asked, “Why’s Uncle Bucky sleeping here?”
“Whoa, whoa, baby boy,” Wade gasped as he helped Peter to the ground, kneeling with him. Peter leaned heavily into his boyfriend. He clutched his chest, where the pain still lingered It was the only thing he could feel other than the pressure of Wade's hold. Despite all that was happening to his own body, but he payed more attention to his parents.
He wanted to come as soon as he entered her but held on, strangling the sheets as she picked up tempo. When she finally cried out he let go and they came together in a chorus of voices.
“Ohhh,” Tony groaned comically. “Right below the belt!” He laughed and explained, “You were my first crush and I guess I reverted back to my childhood mentality? You know, as a kid, you’re supposed to be mean to the person you like.”
Wade quickly opened the door when they reached it and Peter jerked him inside. Peter then slammed the door closed by pushing into Wade’s body with his own and slamming his mouth against Wade’s.
Their mouths had been inching toward each other but Tony suddenly brought them together in a searing kiss.
His father had ordered everyone out, including Steve and Bucky, leaving them alone. No one would overhear them but he still felt uneasy talking about it after being silent about it for so long… He hadn’t even talked to Steve about the finer details because even the tiniest of details could’ve changed the future.
Bucky nodded, feeling some tension lessen in his muscles, and stated, “Good. I’ll be the first in line to testify at his war crimes trial. The man deserves to go away for life.”
Tony sighed and drew his arm around Peter’s shoulders. He stated, “With these things, one of the options is to just ignore the media. They’re freaking out right now, but if you don’t cause any scandals or give them anything to work with, they’ll go after the next story.”
Steve smiled and kicked off his shoes and pants too and they climbed into bed together. Steve was asleep within seconds and Tony knew he wasn’t going to be sleeping a wink.
Steve smothered Tony’s mouth before he could finish the statement. He broke away to inhale a sharp breath. His chest felt so tight and constricted, like he was being crushed by the wave of happiness that suddenly surged upon him.
For a moment, Steve pictured Peter sitting on the porch with one of his toys and his stomach clenched. The image did not look wrong, in fact, it looked normal, something he wanted for his son.
Tony did not mind being locked away and simply worked from his workshop. He was not building anything but was constantly on his holograms, looking in his own way for Bucky.
Peter went to the lab again, leaving Steve and Tony alone with clear schedules thanks to their canceled honeymoon and nothing to do… except, well… each other.
“I’m fine,” Tony promised, picking up Steve’s hand from his chest and then kissing it lightly. His kissed his knuckles first and then opened his palm and kissed the center of it thereby distracting Steve from Tony's red skin as Steve’s heart lurched. Steve pressed that same palm to Tony’s cheek and drew him in for another kiss.
As Tony landed, he said, “Sam, would it be weird if I confess I am near drooling at the fluidity of your flight patterns.”
“The time traveling and resulting paradoxes will not stop. You created time travel, Stark. The design is out there and both of your hands will be in it for the rest of eternity,” Cable stated, holding up his glove. Steve never got a good look at it until that moment and as he stared at it, he realized it looked
“What you’re seeing is the base metal, so if you want a different color or a symbol on your shoulder then you let me know, okay? I can make those kind of changes in a matter of minutes so you won’t be armless as long.”
– come willingly or Jarvis will set the sound off. I know it hurts you so come willingly and I promise we will try to find a way to separate both of you safely.
“Mmm,” Steve hummed, closing his eyes again and feeling lulled to sleep again by the feel of Tony’s warm, sleep-heavy limbs weighing him down.
Steve whispered, “There is nothing to forgive. The past is in the past and right now I am just so happy you are alive! When Bucky shot you, I thought – I thought…”
Steve clenched his fists. He wasn’t going to get any answers here and, by the looks of the room, they tried to fool him. These people were not likely going to want to let him go…so he was going to have to let himself out.
“It’s reaching out to me,” Peter replied and more tendrils reached out to touch him from all directions within the cocoon. The tendrils poked at him, exploring the new territory and Peter laughed. He gasped, “It’s curious! I think its sentient!”
Steve had been sitting at the end of the couch, next to Bruce, and had a sketchbook sitting on his lap but it was now on the floor…
The Red Skull laughed and replied, “You are right about one thing. I would never use this on myself. But it has been tested…why do you think your old friend here has been traded around so often? It is not because of his conversation skills. He was originally Zola’s experiment and, with my blood, he was able to create another super soldier.”
“Hi,” he said to everyone but his eyes stayed focused on his son. Peter’s brows knotted upon hearing his voice.
“You think so?” Tony asked breathlessly, staring down at the toddler with awe. He obviously did not believe the evident truth.
Tony misread his emotions and gently grasped his hand. He whispered, “…I would have never gone against your trust. I would not have told the media…”
Tony opened his legs and Steve stepped between them but they only touched by their carded fingers. Steve whispered, “Right now,
Steve noticed and gently tapped Tony’s shoulder and murmured, “Hey, you’re falling asleep before me. Stay awake.”
Finally, Tony latched onto something the deranged man was saying and he poked his head out from behind Steve’s frame and gasped, “Wait – Wait – Wait…Did you say you came to the past?? Like you time traveled??”
“Promised Stevie I’d keep an eye on you,” Bucky smartly retorted. Tony grumbled something more under his breath that didn’t sound pretty but Bucky didn’t catch all of it to make much sense of it.
When the inevitable finally happened, they were in one of the newly constructed larger tents with thick wooden beam supports. They could stand up straight comfortably, compared to their smaller field sleeping tents. It was their HQ per say as it contained a few tables for them to strategize over their maps and orders.
“…I saw the same look on my husband’s face and had to convince him of the same thing,” Steve stated.
! You can claim to be gay and have no attraction whatsoever to women! There’s no record of you dating before the war or after! For all everyone knows, you didn’t date because you were
Wade kept his mouth sealed shut when he was near Stark… or should he call him Mr. Stark? He definitely wouldn’t want Wade to call him “Dad”…
Natasha and Bucky exited the locker room side-by-side, murmuring to each other in Russian. Both of their eyes focused on Peter at nearly the same time and, for a second, he felt like a mouse out in the open just noticed by two feral cats. But then Natasha’s lips twitched into a small smirk and Peter felt that competitive urge grow inside himself again.
Tony scrambled to his feet. Steve only had the shield, he had no armor, and one hit physically or with lightning could hurt or kill him! All of Tony’s anger evaporated and his fear laced his blood with acid as the hammer came down on Steve.
“Get this off of me!” Tony yelped, motioning to the damaged and melting armor. Steve tore into it, ignoring the flesh of his hands cut and burn beneath the metal. He could heal quickly, Tony couldn’t. He grasped Tony’s hand and pulled him out of the remains of his suit.
Wade shrugged and continued to wallow. Peter rolled his eyes but still persisted, “And I think my dad doesn’t hate your guts anymore.”
Clint jumped out of the quinjet before they landed and Natasha was right behind him like she was his shadow. Bruce landed the quinjet with a large jolt and he murmured a sheepish, “Sorry.”
Steve smiled sadly at the movie, remembering Tony tell him about it and quote it all throughout his time in the past. He glanced out the window one last time and then, with a bittersweet smile, touched the play button.
“I plead the fifth,” Peter retorted smartly. He turned to Wade and asked, “When are they going to get here?”
“Put him on speaker phone!” Tony hissed excitedly. Steve waved him away and Tony grumbled indignantly under his breath.
Peter did not lift his head or answer but Bruce thought it best to leave him alone to think about what Bruce said. He hoped it would help, even if it was in a small way.
that R-Richard is my birthfather! Wha—Why are you doing this?!” Peter looked between them angrily with hurt shadowed in his eyes. He continued, “Is this some sick game you guys play on poor kids? Some fucked up Cinderella story?!”
Peter was in the middle of a huge mass of moving spikes and he looked like a giant sea urchin. Wade was still at his side and his hands had held onto him but he was basically immobile due to the number of impalements he had. His blood was sliding down the tendrils and sloping down to Peter, drenching him in his boyfriend’s blood.
“Go to him,” she whispered, patting the back of his head in a comforting way. He pushed back and met her eyes. She grasped him by the shoulders and implored, “Go to him and tell him everything. Tell him you love him and want a relationship. Go be happy, Tony.”
With a racing heart, Steve looked at the mirror and ran his hands over his hair. His hair was just fine since he had already checked it a number of times already. He wore his finest tan slacks and best button down white shirt. His heart was racing from being nervous but he was also eager for what was to happen.
{True, you’re more worried about yourself right now, aren’t you? Don’t lie, we already know the truth.}
“I’m a no-fly zone, per say…but if Stark or any of his people ask, we’re with you,” Cable murmured. “In fact, tell them this one died in the blast,” Cable said, nodding to Steve. “Call him Steven Edwards and leave it at that.”
“We decided it would be best to keep your mother’s identity a secret. We told the press it was to protect her identity and reputation. All they know is that she was a close confidant to the Parkers and trusted you with them.”
“You don’t have to come back here. You can even stay in California! Just get out of that house!” Steve said.
His son, his only child - one of the few people he loved in his life - he was nearly strangled to death by an alien substance Tony had okayed for use in the intern lab.
Tony whispered, “I was ashamed…It was years before you, years, before the Avengers, years before I became sober…I was an alcoholic, party boy, and I liked a challenge. When… W-When I caught the eye of my cousin’s wife I jumped right on it.”
What else was he to expect from a man born in an era where such things were outlawed? And Steve kept asking if he wanted to back out and Tony kept saying no…He probably just wanted Tony to back out so Steve didn’t have to hurt his feelings.
“In the kitchen!” Tony yelled and Steve ran his hands over his hair again before making his way down the hall.
Peter eventually slipped away into his own room at the Tower citing he needed some alone time. With the door sealed, he sat heavily on his bed and dropped his head into his hands. He took several deep, quaking breaths that he had been holding in, and let his entire body shudder after holding it in for so long.
And how many times would he have to wonder if it was it? If it was the end and Tony was finally going to die?
She smirked and said, “I’ll quiz you on it to see if it is the style you remember. I haven’t had the chance to train in Sambo in a long while. It’ll be nice to practice with someone competent enough in the style.”
Peter’s eyes widened and Steve could see a thousand questions blossom behind his sky blue eyes. He knelt and kept his hands on his son as he waited for the first question.
The blue light from the reactor shined through Tony’s shirt and was a familiar security for Steve to take comfort in.
Tony jumped away from the worktable, clutching his mouth and weaving with no direction to escape. He felt like he was going to be sick. Whatever excitement he might have felt over Steve being alive was washed away with the horror that the Red Skull was doing to him.
“Drama queen,” Steve chided, rolling his hips in the way he knew would make Tony’s toes curl. Tony hissed in surprise and grabbed the bedding as if to steady himself.
Wade wrapped his arms around Peter and tightly held him, gasping, “I don't deserve you...but I love you too much to let you go."
Peter joined him and looked down at the people below. It was dark so his eyes were mostly drawn to the busy traffic in the streets as the lights of the cars and street lamps illuminated the movement.
“Hey….” Jake dragged out the greeting, the sound of the word rose in inflection and sounded more like a question than a greeting. Peter pressed his hand against the handprint scanner and a flash of blue light scanned his prints. It quickly chirped in confirmation, giving him the greenlight to go forward.
“I wasn't trying to, J,” Tony sighed and kicked over some pebbles. He murmured, “If this were my timeline and Steve was just another man…” Tony looked to the door Steve had disappeared through and seriously stated, “In another life, nothing would've been an idle flirtation about us…”
They all assumed he had some type of amnesia so they answered all his questions about the modern world without pause. It was a blessing because the world changed vastly since Steve was last awake and he would probably never figure out how to navigate it without help.
Tony felt frustrated. SHIELD was being tight-lipped about Brock so Tony could not really reassure his son he was completely safe.
Peter barely got any sleep and was awake at 4 a.m. when the newspaper was delivered. As soon as he heard the paper slap the cement, he was running outside. He tore open the paper and was finally able to breathe when he saw the headliner was about the Wikileaks scandal. He tore through the rest of the paper but nothing mentioned him, Tony Stark, or the rest of the Avengers.
Friday led him via the communicator. He cut through crowds of people who didn’t give him a second glance.
“…You’ve been out for a few days. The Goblin beat you good. He fractured your skull, broke your arm and a couple of ribs. You’re going to be fine…Peter refuses to leave your side. He’s fine too just extremely malnourished. Once we got some nutrients in him he started doing better quickly. His healing factor has kicked into overdrive so he sleeps a lot. He’s going to be fine once he regains all the weight he lost…” Bruce paused and regarded Tony sadly. He continued slowly, “Mary and I did not find a solution last minute...Steve was the one who freed Peter. Venom still has him. Peter said it takes Venom a few days to bond but we suspect he should be showing up any day now.”
They reached Oscorp Tower in less than thirty seconds. Steve commanded, “You get Peter out of there and I’ll take care of ‘
The image will become immortalized in the decades to come, but, when Steve first saw it, days after the attack, he held no praise for its artistic interpretation. Instead, he felt all the horror and fears from that day come back and he had to clutch his mouth to keep from vomiting.
The only noted difference he saw was in Tony’s plans as his automated suit took form and solidified into something more real and plausible.
A small window was all that connected them to the front of the car. Happy didn’t look away from the road but replied, “Just being cautious, sir.”
Steve’s heart seized as he instantly imagined being charged guilty and Tony’s words of it “being over before you know it” pertained to their relationship and not the trial.
The bouquet was modest, containing three stems and each stem had over two dozen tiny flowers on each end. The flowers were six pointed stars and the points curled inward toward the base of the petals. They were bundled so close together that the stalk of the stem could not be seen beyond the petals.
“But then Steve would be the one sitting here instead of Bucky, right?” Pepper whispered, reminding him of the paradox he dealt with. “There probably would have always been a Winter Soldier, Tony. Hydra was going to make the soldier no matter what. You wouldn’t be able to control it.
Tony lay his hand on the tabletop, open and inviting. Steve looked from Tony’s open hand then to his open smile. With a racing heart, Steve shyly reached out and placed his hand in Tony’s. Tony’s fingers wrapped around his and caressed the side of his hand with his thumb. His hands were rough from the years he spent working with metal and electronics but Steve instantly loved the texture. Both he and Tony leaned forward, separating their legs but drawing their upper halves closer. They came so close that their breath intermingled.
Tony scrambled to his feet as soon as he was able. His eyes were riveted on the figure on the bed. In the pale light, Steve face was soft with sleep and Tony hunched over him, waiting for those beautiful blue eyes to open.
The defrosting was slow. His entire body had to warm up simultaneously otherwise he’d lose his limbs or they’d damage his brain. The Captain floated upright in a hyperbaric cylinder filled with a light blue liquid. Rogers was totally submerged with a breathing mask and several electrical leads attached to his chest and forehead to monitor his life support. A handful of scientists were monitoring him or working elsewhere in the lab.
Tony’s eyes were red and as shiny as newly polished glass. He looked disheveled and his shoulders were slumped low like he carried the weight of the world.
Peter leaned forward following his friend’s point. Steve flushed, thinking he was pointing at Steve and Thor’s photo of both of them making odd faces at the camera.
Peter snorted and finally pushed back to look up at Wade and ask, “And why on Earth would I want to do that?”
“…Let Jarvis finish the hacking and confirm,” Bruce whispered gently. “Steve wouldn’t want you to see that.”
Jarvis opened another file and Tony began to read and the tightness in his chest became even more tighter and he felt like he was going to break.
” touch. Steve’s fingertips dug low onto his hip bone and his thumb pressed deeply into the flesh of lower back. Tony had felt this touch before from numerous past lovers.
“…Nat?” Tony questioned. He felt uneasy seeing her so close to the maniac that had almost killed her. What on Earth was going through her mind? What kind of trauma does one’s soulmate attacking you inflict?
Luckily, Peter began to cry so Steve did not have to answer the troubling question Tony gave him. Tony released his hand and Steve shot him a small smile before shooting to his feet and running over to his son.
“It's not that simple. I am only a Captain in the army. I don't have much sway. I can make a new mechanic appear with some maneuvering but a consultant is much more higher up and noticeable. Unless you want to tell everyone you're from the future, you're an army mechanic.”
Peter sat rigidly beside Tony. His eyes were locked on the podium and tears fell unhindered down his face. His tiny hand latched onto Tony’s as soon as he sat down and held him in a painfully tight grip. On Peter’s other side sat Ben Parker. The older man was also crying but continuously rubbing Peter’s back to offer some semblance of comfort. In Peter’s other hand, he gently held Steve’s sole remaining dog-tag. He had not let it go since his father’s death and had yet to speak since then…
Tony carded his fingers with Steve’s and said, “C’mon, we got to take a selfie at the end of Route 66 sign, walk to the end of the pier, maybe go on the ferris wheel…the day is still young!”
Steve rubbed at Peter’s wet hair, mussing it into odd angles. Peter shook himself out of Steve reach with a small smirk and Steve said, “Go eat, kid. I’ll be out in a moment.”
“Ew, yes,” Pepper replied with a grimace. She lightly touched Tony’s chest and murmured, “I’ve got this, Tony. You’re going to be alright.”
Steve’s earlier words came back to him, hitting him like a freight train. The man probably feared it because of the persecution he might have faced but, he still
“He’s no good for Peter,” Tony argued to the plate in front of him. Steve still stood behind him and Tony dared not turn around to see his expression.
Peter felt like an empty shell. Without Venom there to fight he suddenly had no purpose. He was too weak to do anything but lie next to his healing father and think.
Tony sighed again and leaned heavily into Steve. He looked up to Steve and said, “I am running out of ideas. What did I do to make you fall for me?”
Steve found him down there surrounded by holograms. He was trying to figure out what to get Peter so he had various websites open with things ranging from chemistry to photography.
With his heart racing from his boldness, Steve said, “Can you tell him Peter's asleep but I’m awake and he owes me a movie.”
That day, as Steve worked out, he paused when he heard the boys. The sound of their laughter could be heard echoing throughout the Tower and it brought a smile to Steve’s lips. He did one more rep then wiped the sweat off his forehead and got off the workout machine.
Tony blasted to the motherboard and he heard the fight behind him intensify as the Soldier tried to get to him. He opened the console and tore out one of the chips and slammed the one Hill gave him in.
Such a photo in the wrong hands could spell disaster with the press but Steve found a way to print it either way. Tony bet Natasha helped him.
Steve rolled his eyes and grasped Tony’s face with both hands. He murmured affectionately, “Come here, you maniac.”
“Uhhh, well, apology accepted?” Tony replied uncertainly. He remembered his own words and inwardly winced. He quickly replied, “And I’m sorry too. For everything I said! Also not true! You’re not a relic…you’re-you’re-.” He struggled for a better term and finally gasped, “You’re the genuine hero!”
“You can’t know that,” Tony hissed. “What if we get together and he starts hating all the time I spend in my lab instead of with him or-or what if he breaks it off because I disregard an order during a fight??”
Peter pulled him over to the pool table and said, “To give you the quick catch up, we’ve been dating and he saved me from Venom.”
“Oh, I love when you’re sassy,” Tony flirted. He skipped ahead and stepped in front of Steve, bringing them both to a stop. Tony grasped the lapel of his shirt and pulled him in until their chests bumped together. Tony continued with a coy smile, “I’ve been thinking…you and me get away. Out of New York and somewhere warm, on a beach, maybe a private island with just the two of us and no chance of vultures swooping in.”
When Tony pulled away from him, Steve was reluctant for the moment to end. With slightly puffy lips, Tony smiled happily at him and murmured, “For a first kiss, that one was pretty fantastic. One of the top ten in history even. I bet we did better than Romeo and Juliet.”
They all gathered around Fury and listened to his explanation on how he had survived using a serum developed to calm Bruce down when he Hulked. Coulson was vaguer, mumbling something about Tahiti but he mostly evaded the subject and Steve could see he was uncomfortable talking about it so he did not press.
“But are you?” Tony countered. “In all the years I’ve known you, I have never once seen you in a serious relationship. You’ve hooked up a bunch. I’ve heard the stories on the grapevine. But I’ve never heard you actually try to start something with someone. Why now? And why Peter?”
“Oh, no…There’s a Captain America version,” Steve groaned, pointing out the star-spangled decked out bear on the other side of the Bucky Bear.
In send half of that second, the lightening burned into Steve’s back and, by the damaged arm still holding onto him, Tony tightened his grip and used the last of his fuel reserves in his boots and blasted a few more feet away.
Steve leaned over and pressed a kiss into Tony’s mouth. Both of their moans mingled together and they breathed as one to better keep their mouths connected. Tony didn’t know if he wanted to keep his hands on Steve’s hips or his head. He wanted both points closer and deeper. He wanted to be one with this man every way possible.
He lightly nudged Peter’s head with the side of his face, causing Peter to stir. Peter whined lightly and squeezed his eyes closed tighter.
“I like kids and they like me,” Tony pouted. His playboy stigma never gave him points in the kid department…
“There is an attack at SHIELD HQ. They are requesting the Avengers’ assistance,” Jarvis informed them.
“I know one thing at least,” his dad eventually grumbled as they evacuated the last of the personal from the room.
Short chapter - first half is Natasha foiling the final part and the second half is my introducing the villain to the fifth and final part of the Superfamily series...
Their lips parted but held each other close, looking into one another’s eyes with heightened emotions.
His eyes cut to Peter’s face on the monitor, his guilt growing as he took in the hurts inflicted upon his lover.
He regarded Tony shamefully and whispered, “I’m sorry for everything that's happened. I don't want to lose your friendship but we need to-to sit down and talk about us. I can't lose you too, Tony. Especially over a petty squabble.”
As for the events in Central Park, he spoke mostly the truth. General Ross had attacked them because he believed the rumors that Peter was Bruce’s son. He learned later, from Bruce, that the man hated him and been trying to destroy him since the Hulk was created.
He paused before the front door and lifted his hand to knock but paused again before rapping on the hard wood.
Before either one of them could pull the trigger, someone shot the gun out of Natasha’s hand and another yelled, “Stand down!”
With a broken voice, Steve whispered, “I’ve gone without your hourly reminder that you love me for a few weeks, sweetheart.”
The next night was worse. All of his limbs were tingling. The pins and needles were now painful and he winced with every step.
–!” Bucky clutched his head and then hissed, “Do not call me that!” He held up his hands between them as if to ward off Tony and painfully gasped, “
Natasha and Clint were out of the building on an assignment for SHIELD and Thor was currently in Asgard with Jane. So no one should intrude on them.
Bucky replied by launching himself at Natasha’s torso. His head hit her in the gut and threw her to the ground. Natasha wrapped her arms around his neck then pushed both her legs beneath her and pushed them over so Bucky was the one laying on the ground not her. Natasha drew back her leg as far as she could and forcefully kneed him in the gut again.
Peter hurried over to the station where their supervisors kept the interns' files and pretended he didn’t notice everyone watching his every move. He picked up his files and, as he thumbed through the reports, the whispers started.
Pepper hurriedly flicked some more switches and hit some buttons and alarms started to flair. She yelled up, “It’s ready, Tony, get off the roof!”
“Hey,” Steve softly intoned, grasped one of his hands. He chuckled, “Good morning to you! Is this how you normally wake? I thought you were a grouch and not about to jump out of the bed!”
Steve smiled and draped his arms across Tony’s shoulders and leaned into his back. Pressing his face just behind Tony’s ear, he continued, “I am so proud of you.”
,” Peter gasped, grabbing Wade tightly. Peter swatted at him for the move and Wade happily laughed as he fell back into the bed with his arms folded over his head. He gazed up at Peter loving his stubborn frown. That frown grew into a warm smile and Peter blushed but his gaze did not break away from Wade’s.
“I’m fine,” he assured Steve and himself. He pressed his face against Steve’s chest and felt Steve’s heart beating against his cheek. Tony whispered more to himself, “Everything is fine…”
Steve took in a deep, shuddering breath and he replied, “B-Bucky…Mostly I’ve been dreaming about Bucky’s death.”
What he did not account for, however, was the elevator dinging as it opened in the group’s path and Eddie Brock stepping out…
Steve bumped into the doorframe, nearly toppled over an old piece of discarded clothing, and barely made it to the bed he was so distracted by Tony. They both fell onto the bed heavily, making the air rush out of their lungs.
Peggy was at his side in the next moment and crouched beside him. She turned Tony’s head to the side to see the wound and Tony moaned pitifully. She stated, “You’ll live.”
Peter nodded but the tears still flowed and he buried his face into Wade’s chest. Wade adjusted his hold to accommodate him, but he looked crushed and on the verge of tears himself.
Bucky was so shocked he just dumbly watched Steve’s retreating figure run away for a few seconds. He was freed from his reverie when Jim gasped, “What the fuck was that?”
. Most of the Commandos were silent but would randomly exchange a word or a joke or two with quiet, muffled voices.
, Steve. We’re going to raise him…what if I fuck it up like my dad had with me? What if I’m trying to help him and he hates me for it too?”
Hundreds of miles away, Steve Rogers experienced the moment very differently. A shock burned through him reminiscent to the same burn of the vita-rays that created his superior strength. He woke up gasping for air and felt cold, so c-cold…
He shook his head to knock the thoughts out of his mind. It was clearly a misunderstanding and now it was all cleared up. There was no need to keep thinking on it.
Natasha reached into the folds of her dress and pulled out an ancient looking flask. She unscrewed it and carefully put a single, tiny drop into her martini.
His dad led them to the communal room where they’d hanged out last night, watching Vision fly the symbiote into the sun. The party hadn’t officially started yet but the Avengers were there and as soon as Peter entered the room, they all cheered, “Happy birthday!”
Peter looked a little confused by the move, even one of Wade’s voices was whining about wanting to get to third base.
“I can't begin to imagine what the next person who uses this room will think happened here,” Steve laughed.
And there he was, he had shorter hair and a more carefree expression, but it was her James. It had been the first time she’d seen him in the years since she lost him and she had sobbed her heart out when she saw him. She printed all the ones containing James and locked them away in her burrow. She had considered telling Steve but decided against it. She didn’t want anyone’s pity or more heartbreak.
“Then what is it? Coercion? Brain washing? Steve, you and Tony butt out of our business and don’t you dare put Peter up to anything like this again!” She turned to Peter and snapped, “Run around the gym twenty more times, go through the usual exercises, do ten front flips and ten backflips in proper form then you are done for the day.” Natasha turned to Steve and said, “I suggest you watch him because I have to go threatened your boyfriend then break James’s nose
“Like you did when he bashed your head in? How are you going to handle him when you are unconscious…I don’t want to see you get anymore hurt…”
“It’s already happened in Tony’s timeline, Peggy,” Steve tiredly said. “It may be our only chance to finally stop Hydra…and to save Tony.”
“Jarvis!” Peter said with a smile, his cheer slicing through the tension like a hot knife through butter.
“Can’t,” he gasped, despite his body throbbing with pain that did not want to be ignored. Three shots and shrapnel moving around in one’s chest can really fuck with a person. He explained, “I’m a fugitive and I won’t be detained. Not while Steve is still out there.”
Steve slipped in and snapped the tent door closed when he saw Tony laying half naked in front of him. He tied it off tightly and he gasped, “This is stupid.”
Peter woke in his lover’s arms feeling extremely rejuvenated. He didn't know what Venom had done to him but, ever since Peter started to wear him, he'd been feeling more and more tired as the days went by. With the symbiote gone, Peter felt like a whole new person.
When he finally turned back to them, he wore a lost expression and said, “The ocean in Italy was not as cold…”
Steve cupped the side of Peter’s face and watched in horror and fascination as a cut on his son’s cheek healed itself before his eyes. Steve did not have time to reflect upon his son’s new power because he heard the General step up to them.
“I’m Tony Stark, Howard’s son,” he explained. The robot shell closed itself and stepped back into the corner of the room.
What was Bruce planning? Had he found a solution that was deadly to whoever wielded it? Or, perhaps, since he was the only other person with gamma-radiated blood, maybe the solution was in his body and he was going to sacrifice himself for Peter?
Steve split his legs to accommodate Tony’s body. Tony slid down Steve’s torso and transferred nearly all of his weight to his knees. Steve moaned in frustration, wanting Tony’s weight back, wanting to feel his body against his, and wanting to feel his body heat intermingle at soaring temperatures with Steve’s. But then Tony’s hands ran over Steve’s chest, down the sides of his torso, and then pulled Steve's shirt out of his pants. He reached under Steve’s shirt and ran his hands over Steve’s abdominal muscles.
Steve picked up the bed and threw it at the largest cluster of men and then jumped out of the window.
He turned around to find Bruce sitting in the guest chair behind him. He was sleeping with his head cushioned on his own arm on the arm of the chair.
He shuddered to himself as he remembered the bodies of the other men Zola had experimented on. Bucky was his only surviving victim…
He didn’t just remove his fingers, but slowly traced her lips until he reached the edge of the pinkened flesh. A slight blush tinted her cheeks but her eyes were heated. Neither had breached anything more physical than holding each other until that moment. She bit down on her lips and they disappeared in her mouth for a moment only to reemerge moistened, soft, and inviting.
Their front door exploded open and half the team caught up and barreled into the room. Somebody cursed and they rushed forward. Everyone was worrying over Steve and Wanda’s pink magic encircled him, applying pressure where they couldn’t. Everyone converged on Tony, demanding answers about Steve and what had happened.
“He stole one of the scientists’ lab coasts,” Coulson sighed in explanation. “He’s somewhere in the city. Can you help us in the search?”
The doctor’s face lost its professional parlor for a second and revealed shock from Steve’s statement.
“Maybe I should use pushed by a bike messenger, I haven’t used that one in a while,” Peter mumbled to himself. He dropped his backpack, one of the fingers to his Spider-Man costume was sticking out from between the zippers but he did not notice.
“Yes, it is, and no, Cap. Just sit back and let me work my culinary magic! I will have this ready to go in a jiffy!”
“I thought…I thought they were shrapnel and surgery wounds…” Steve murmured, his eyes trailing over Tony’s torso with an unhappy frown.
“Tony…there’s something on your skin,” Steve whispered, touching the veiny black mark on Tony’s skin meandering away from the reactor.
Pepper stepped in front of him and said, “You are going to kill yourself! For once in your life, stop thinking of others and think of yourself!”
The Soldier spun in his hold and started punching him again. Steve put up little to no resistance. The Soldier was going to freaking kill Steve.
He slammed Steve’s head into the ground and Steve felt a surge of fear slice through his anger. Bucky’s voice was not right. It was dead, without any emotion. What was Bucky saying? Was this the Soldier?
It was the first night they went to bed together…Not that they immediately went to bed. They had a lot of firsts to celebrate after all.
Tony could not help but feel a little thrill from Steve’s shock. It looks like the SHIELD agent’s crush was one-sided. Tony continued, “Is there anyone?”
From there, he continued to lead Steve through the maze of corridors with touches to the small of his back, his arm, his elbow, his hand, and, once even to his ass which made Steve violently jerk and Tony almost laughed aloud. He bit down on his lip to smother the chuckle and Steve shot him an embarrassed glare like he had done it to mess with him on purpose.
“After that hand job you gave me in the pool, all I have been thinking about—,” Tony gasped and Steve froze as his lust spiked from the memory. He pushed himself up and peered down at Tony. Tony’s eyes were dark and filled with promise. Tony continued, “—all I have been thinking about is returning the favor.”
Even with his improved brain function, his fishing game with his host only lasted so long. SHIELD caught on quickly and were crawling all over the sewers in a few hours. In the darkness of night, Venom was able to hide in shadows and attack unsuspecting victims.
Tony nodded and the Iron Man suit in front of Steve mirrored his movements. Steve nodded back and ran back to the transport ship.
They returned to the house and Bucky elected to give Natasha the tour. Tony watched them disappear upstairs with a smirk. He was glad to see Bucky so enamored.
“They totally did! I would have never been given the clearance to the Avengers medical unit unless they did not grant it!” Wade excitedly gasped.
The Soldier accepted the ear pieces gingerly. He pressed one into his ear and the other he pocketed.
how passionate you are about things, but, a lot of times, you will let things get out of hand. I don’t want you to inadvertently hurt yourself…”
“I’m sorry, Ma’am. Sir has instructed me to leave you three locked in there until he or Master Rogers request otherwise,” Jarvis replied.
After Cable removed all the locks, bolts, and the wooden partition, they stepped out into sun. Steve took a moment to absorb some of its rays and then breathed in the fresh air deeply. The scent of sea salt filled his nose and immediately brought back memories of reaching Tony’s house on the sea cliffs. The joyous memory unfortunately was overlaid with a bitter sadness.
Steve had been outfitted with a mouth guard and a machine that covered his head and half his face. He was breathing shallowly, trying to shake his head away, and was pulling at his bonds.
Thor’s gift was a tiny dagger encrusted with Asgardian sigils and jewels. Steve ran his thumb over the blade and silently determined to keep it out of Peter’s reach until he was much older.
But the foundation was still there and their team had grown closer in all of the change and tragedy. Steve had no doubt the Avengers would continue.
Steve sighed heavily and sat down where Howard had been sitting a moment prior. With a hushed voice, he relayed everything Tony told him about the coming days. As his account progressed, Peggy’s face grew paler until he told her about the plane crash and she cupped her mouth with a pained gasp.
Tony only sobbed harder, burying his head onto Steve’s lap while the rest of his body splayed out across the ground.
“Take Peter now!” Steve yelled, tearing Peter off him. His shirt tore but he did not notice as Ross came running toward them. He shoved Peter into Tony’s arms and screamed, “RUN!”
Steve was crying but they were happy tears. Upon Tony’s declaration, the smile he was wearing grew wider and he cupped Tony’s cheek and agreed, “I am home.”
Steve chose that moment to enter the room. Their eyes met and Steve froze like a deer caught in the glare of oncoming headlights. He looked petrified and spun right around, practically fleeing the room.
“It was horrible!” Steve gasped, wide-eyed. He greedily grabbed at Tony’s hands and gasped, “I was miles away and-and they said the most nasty things! They kept throwing insults at me or tried to embarrass me. A-And I could barely breathe, they were so close to me!”
Venom opened its mouth as wide as he could and tried to swallow the Asgardian but the god shoved his hammer into Venom’s mouth, halting the feeding. Venom moaned in frustration.
His phone started to vibrate in his pocket and only because it was probably Tony, did Steve reach for it.
The doors unsealed as the rest of the team ran in. Bruce fell to his knees beside them with a first responders' medical kit but Wade did not react to any of them. He only had eyes for Peter. Peter stared back, his eyes half lidded and clearly exhausted but filled with love for Wade.
Bucky grasped Steve's head with both hands and slammed Steve’s head into the hard cement. His skull cracked as easily as an egg under Bucky’s strength and sounded like a watermelon cracking open. Hot blood flowed from his scalp.
It was midday and, even though Tony was feeling groggy from watching over Steve, he knew he would not get a moment’s rest until he saw the blue of Steve’s eyes again.
Tony twirled his finger around, brushing against his sensitive insides. Steve was mumbling nonsense and thrusting into Tony’s touch. He did not think it could get any better but Tony proved him wrong when he added a second finger.
Stark sighed and said, “Well then…tell Fury I’ve simply been ‘quiet’ because I am busy. The Tower’s reactor is going to connect to the grid in a few months and, since I am an anal perfectionist, I want it to go off without a hitch.”
Tony turned back to Venom. The symbiote was dragging itself across the floor and its body was shaking with the effort to move itself.
two hooked up in the past, didn’t you?” Fury turned squarely to Tony and growled, “And you didn’t think to tell me this even when we were searching for Cap and he was heading straight to you??”
“What? I assume the kid already got the bird and the bees talk? When two guys love each other, they get some lube and –.”
He had his Instagram open and Wade glanced at the page. Peter had millions of followers and even had the official blue check marking him as a genuine celebrity. Peter still loved taking pictures and posted them online all the time. This would be the first time Wade would be making an appearance on the page.
Steve froze and looked to his fiancé. With an exuberant gasp, Tony said, “We can buy him Iron Man and Captain America clothes!!”
Wade chuckled and replied, “It’s okay, baby boy. I was kinda expecting you to bring that up sooner or later. I’ve had the morals lecture from Cap a couple times now so I figured his little boy would have the same kind of morals.”
Peter replied, “Spidey will just start to swing out of the Tower until the press calms down. It isn’t that much of a life changer…though Spidey and Deadpool probably shouldn’t have any more rooftop dates.”
“You have no idea,” Tony sighed heavily. He turned his attention back to Steve and, now that they were alone, asked, “What did Phillips want? Are we moving out?”
“SHIELD could not find a body, they could not find any of the bodies from the experiments,” Tony stated as he expanded the said files on one of the glowing screens in front of him. To Harry, he said, “When the video feed comes up. I need you to point her out.”
Steve angled his head up and kissed the side of Tony’s neck and whispered into his flesh, “I love you too.”
All of his weight fell onto Wade as he gasped shallowly for breath and Wade tightly clutched his arms. Wade exclaimed, “PETER?!”
Steve let himself be led into a massive limo and he, Coulson, and Tony slid inside while Thor shot into the air. The agents scattered to clear traffic. As soon as the door sealed, Tony’s armor folded itself off his body and into a suitcase at his feet. Once he was free of the armor, Tony launched himself at Steve.
“Really?” Steve gazed up at the sky and wondered if someone in Brooklyn right now was looking at the same thing.
. Tony felt his eyes heat up again and his lips tremble, making his smile waiver. He embraced Steve again to remind himself he was really there and to hide his face in order to regain composure as he was overcome with emotion.
“What the fuck!? Get the hell off her!?” Hawkeye tried to pull him off his target but he was no match for the Soldier’s strength.
Tony washed out his mouth in the spray and then joined Steve on the bench. They lazily kissed until their fingertips pruned.
“They’re both related through the gamma-radiation, perhaps?” Tony suggested with a shrug. Steve nodded, it was the most likely conclusion.
“Speaking of Peter…” Steve whispered, “He revealed something pretty big to me today. Bet you’d never guess what?”
Steve leaned forward and nuzzled his face into the crook of Tony’s throat. This time it was Tony who twitched but he too relaxed. He wound his arms around Steve and his hands kneaded into the muscles of Steve’s back.
Steve had been positive he hadn’t seen Tony on his way over. Had the time traveler slipped into his suit during the fight? He saw Iron Man fighting too. Had that been Tony?
Last night’s awful dinner, hovered on the fringes of his mind but, with Wade moving against him like this, it was being pushed back. His mind only focused on the man in his arms and how great of a kisser he was and how wonderful his body felt against Peter’s.
The communal room had transformed overnight. The floor was covered in bright balloons, speakers were set up in all corners of the room promising loud music, the bar was lit up and flashy like a bar at a popular Vegas club, and there was so much food that Peter even doubted the team members with legendary metabolisms could finish it all.
A shadow fell over them and Wade couldn’t help but ironically wonder what additional horror just came up to them. Iron Man couldn’t have possibly caught up to them by now. Was this the shadow of some dastardly villain, wanting to finish them off while they were detained by Venom? At this point, the entire country had to know what was happening with the number of cell phones capturing what was happening. The crazies could run just as fast as the authorities. It’d be Wade’s luck that this would happen…He looked over his shoulder to the shadow caster and all of his apprehension vanished when he saw Vision and Wanda coming to a hovering stop above them.
Steve’s jaw dropped as he looked to the rings and Tony’s nervous expression. Everything made so much sense now that he felt ridiculous for not seeing it sooner. Steve’s hands rose to the level of Tony’s face then cupped his cheeks. Tony had enough time to blink before Steve pulled him into a mouth crushing kiss so hard that the older man fell over. Steve went tumbling down with him and continued to ravish his mouth with kisses when Tony was flat on his back on the tile floor.
To Tony’s absolute horror, Steve’s face crumbled, and his eyes became glassy with unshed tears threatening to break free. Steve put his hand over Tony’s and pulled the hand from his beard in order to kiss his palm.
“Jarvis,” Peter stated when he reached the edge. He looked down the hundreds of stories below him and gulped.
Steve grinned. He actually saw that movie when it was first released in 1937. For once, he understood the reference and he replied, “Shush, Grumpy, and eat some food.”
He continued, “I recently remembered the moment my implant activated. I hadn’t remembered it since yesterday…they took it from me like everything else. Just like they took my name and I know they took
“So I was going to apologize for taking so long, had to – uh – dig my medkit out of storage but it looks like you two didn’t mind…”
.” Steve slammed down the mesh ball in frustration. He bent down to one knee to pick it up but did not get up and rubbed his eyes. With Steve no longer standing, the water from the shower head hit Tony at full force.
Tony inadvertently clutched his chest and gasped, “Listen, it’s Osborne, right? You don’t have to do this. Just give us back the reactor and we’ll return it to the past. I’m sure Fury will take into account your willingness to hand it over when handing you over to the judge.”
Peter shoved his card in his pocket and grabbed the bag off the counter. He quickly stated, “He’s not. I’ll have to take a raincheck on that picture!”
He rubbed his face, trying to dispel the nervous feelings that cropped up. As he moved, his phone shifted in his pocket and all his worries melted away as he remembered what he had planned tonight.
“Your disguise is impeccable,” Steve commented when he was within earshot. Tony grinned and adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose.
Steve and Tony shared breakfast and they spoke of other things that got Tony out of his foul mood. Spending time with Steve just did that for him. The man was naturally soothing to Tony. His smile alone usually lifted Tony's spirits.
He saw Pepper consider it but then the machine shuddered to a stop and Pepper slipped. Steve acted on instinct. He felt Tony surge forward beneath his hands so he threw Tony backwards then threw himself forward.
Bucky clenched his jaw and dropped his eyes. With a tight voice, he stated, “It is required I go to the machine right after I leave the cryostasis chamber. It clears my mind and makes it so I have no distractions for my mission.”
“…No, I need to find a way to protect Spidey’s identity,” Peter sighed, pulling himself out of Steve’s arms.
“…Steve,” Tony whispered. “I sent a message to SHIELD but I haven’t gotten a response. We’re on our own…”
“I am fine,” Steve stated, ignoring his aching wounds. His headache was no longer the monster it was yesterday and was easily ignored so he considered himself a million times better. Steve stated, “I’m willing to sign the form stating I’m leaving against medical advice.” He had already signed it a number of times since working with SHIELD.
Tony pulled up the specs in holograms around him and said, “The official report was that the shield was lost with Captain America in the arctic! So how the hell did a homeless guy in New York get his hands on it?!”
Peter turned to his aunt and she explained, “Your text was vague but you hinted at a fight with Tony so I texted Steve so neither of them would have to worry where you were. If you don’t want him here, I can kick him out.”
“Yes…” Tony replied slowly. He glanced between Steve and Mary then stated, “So am I going to address the elephant in the room?”
Yet, for Steve, it had been only a few days ago when he’d last saw Tony, his chest covered in poisoned, dark veins, delirious with fever, and on the verge of death.
A mad chuckle was already tickling his throat, threatening to break free. Norman withheld it by taking another sip of his cappuccino.
After Venom’s first attack, Bruce had said they thought the symbiote was trying to fuse with Peter. Did-Did it try and succeed this time? Peter felt sick and wanted to rip the symbiote off him like the leech it was at that moment.
He’d never experienced it before, but he’d read up about it. That darkness had felt empty and  eternal and it only appeared if one’s soulmate was awake or…
But apparently, Steve and Tony falling in love was a game changer and they were forced between choosing to stay together or changing the future…a future in which Steve was tortured into a pawn for Hydra.
Everyone froze. Even Wade’s heart froze up in his chest and the cold out spread from there like a fast-moving virus.
He reached out to Tony and he could not help but remember the last time he lay in a hospital bed and reached out to him. Tony had denied him last time. Tony stared at his outstretched hand and stated, “…Steve, I want to say some things, things that you won’t want to hear but I need to do this or I will question this relationship for the rest of my life.” Tony’s gaze stayed fixated on Steve’s hand so he kept it outstretched but his muscles tensed and his fingers threatened to tremble.
He tore wildly at the symbiote’s body, hoping against hope that he could stop it from taking Peter again
Pepper had highlighted everywhere Peter needed to sign or initial and, as he did so, he asked, “How much have we told them? About our history?”
He held his phone to Tony and on its screen he saw a picture of a frightened, dark haired woman with a gun held to her head. He never met her before but it had to be his soulmate, Laura.
When he entered the room, he saw Howard was sitting at Tony’s bedside, gently wetting Tony’s forehead with a cool cloth. Tony’s eyes were closed and he didn’t hear Steve come in. Howard nodded to him in greeting and then silently stepped away from his future son.  He went up to Steve by the open door and whispered in a low voice, “I can sit with him a little longer. You should let yourself grieve, Cap.”
Cap’s command was still ringing in his ear and Wade’s heart was pulling him in the direction of the elevator’s metal doors. Whatever it was the drew Peter away, Wade would be there for him.
Tony smirked and grasped Steve’s chin. He pulled Steve’s face in so they were only centimeters apart and whispered, “Baby, the way I dance, you would’ve never seen it in a reputable dance hall today, nonetheless one in the forties.”
The older man came to a stop a few feet away and raised his gun as he gritted, “Get out of the way, Stark! You too, Captain! I have to kill Banner’s abomination before it matures!”
“They want me to build weapons, I refused,” Tony gasped hoarsely but still managed to smile cheekily at Steve.
“Oh God, I can’t imagine eating anything right now,” Steve replied. He was too engorged in watching Ben enter Oscorp Tower to look in Tony’s direction.
Pleasure from the bite gave way to a trickle of pain. It was the flash of pain that did it. His eyes snapped open and he froze.
Tony wound his arms behind Steve’s neck to deepen the kiss and the super soldier, his heart and life, pressed back into him with a smile.
“They’re not nightmares,” Tony murmured in explanation. “They’re memories…from the wormhole…” And that was all he explained but it was enough.
Steve fell to his knees and instinctually put pressure on the wounds even though it would be no help in the dream.
He easily reasoned it hurt so much because the incidence mirrored how Bucky had died, falling into the darkness just out of Steve’s reach. But he couldn’t reason why reflecting on their second kiss made him want to cry.
Howard glanced at Maria, but she was hunched over Jarvis in his wheelchair as they carried on their own personal conversation.
Peter did not respond to Tony’s outcry, in fact, he didn’t seem conscious at all save for the movement of his arm.
He had no relationship with the man but, such a parental betrayal, felt like a dagger to the heart. That had to be the reason otherwise why did he never reach out to Peter until now? Did he even care about him?
Pepper stepped over to him and hugged him from behind. She buried her face into his back and gasped, “He loves you, Tony. He would have never left you like this if he had the choice!”
Tony loved to play checkers and was impressively very good at it. They were sitting in a old study with a checkerboard carved out of chestnut. Tony had imagined it for them and said it was one his favorite places to be in his home cluing Steve into how wealthy his family must have been. Tony did not seem to notice his wealth and Steve never drew attention to it.
He fled the room but he felt like his body was anchored to Steve and there was a pull on his heart, trying to bring him back to Steve’s side. He hadn’t gone so far from Steve’s side since he came out of surgery but Thor was there and he clearly came there to speak to one of them.
He heard the shower turn on and Tony’s clothes slap the floor. He listened to the water splash as Tony stepped under the spray and, for a few moments, replayed the dozen or so instances he’d seen Tony under the spray. Sometimes he had been in the shower with Tony or sometimes he’d be brushing his teeth and Tony’s figure was just a blur in the background.
and you know it!” Tony yelled, “He doesn’t want to fight for you! Leave him alone! He’s done and lost enough already!”
That was right…This would be the first time his life as ‘ordinary’ Peter Parker and ‘Tony’s son’ Peter Parker would converge. The last couple of birthdays he had, he had hung out with his friends and then hung out with the Avengers separately…but, now he can do it all at once.
With Solo vouching for him, Steve was accepted into the homeless community quickly. They partnered up as Solo showed him the ropes and Steve assisted him. Everyone started to call him ‘Chewie’ which Solo explained was another reference to the movie and Steve’s height. It apparently was the name of a tall, hairy alien who was the companion to the fictional Solo. Steve took it all in stride. He was much taller than Solo though Solo was much more hairier. The new name have Steve a new identity and the excuse not to give out his real name.
Instead, he hissed, “You have got to be kidding me?!” Of course, now he begins to be cordial with him!
“No, Pep,” Tony whispered. He reached over and grasped her hand and gratefully stated, “It’s perfect…I just don’t think I can stomach it right now.”
Steve picked up the pacifier and rinsed it off in the sink while Tony hummed a Led Zeppelin song under his breath. Peter buried his face into Tony’s chest and his sobs became muffled and then puttered off into a quieter cry.
Steve kept busy with Bucky: setting up camp, preparing for Colonel Phillips, and rooting out information on the remaining Hydra agents in the area.
They landed on one of the smaller balconies and Wade instantly recognized it as the same balcony he had shared the brief disaster of a dinner with Peter’s family. Wade nervously peered inside, wondering where his parents were…specifically Stark…
When Tony turned around, Steve had been staring at his ass but he kept his gaze locked into place and lingered on his crotch. Tony twitched in surprise then froze.
At the sound of its voice, Tony finally stirred. Everyone hovered around him worriedly and Howard felt a tinge of relief when Tony opened his eyes. Tony smiled for the first time since Steve’s death and wetly gasped, “J? Is that you, buddy?”
He did not know how he was going to react when Venom finally melted away and all Tony was hitting was Peter’s flesh. And if his son was still alive, Tony probably would kill himself for hurting him.
He could proudly call the man his friend. They had spent the last several days mostly in each other’s presence and developed a close trust. They knew each other’s deepest secrets so they obviously easily shared the rest. It’d be so easy to trust Steve with his fragile heart. He already trusted the man with so much more.
Richard Parker and Tony Stark reportedly had a physical altercation at the labs. After that, they were never seen together in public again.
Tony reached out to him and tightly grasped his hand. He swore to his son, “You’re going to be fine. We all survived and that monster won’t touch you
Tony was going in with literally no backup and a suit that was damaged. He should wait for the Avengers to help or at least tell them where he was going! Steve groaned. He took back every nice thing he thought about the man.
Eventually, over an hour had passed and Steve’s voice dwindled too. The silence fell upon them again but it did not feel as oppressive as before.
“Ever since then Deadpool has been seen around the Tower and helping the Avengers a lot. Additionally, he’s all but stopped his work as a mercenary and those rumors say it is because of you. That, whenever you two are seen at a function together, you’re very
He had to stop interacting with these people as much as he could to right the future, but he was a social creature. He never before felt so very alone and isolated.
Steve clenched his fists and glanced apologetically to Tony. Tony was still too shocked and scared to respond. Steve looked back to Peggy and explained, “Iron Man may be able to help Tony with his chest…they both have similar devices.”
“I figured you would want to read up on it. It’s probably a shock to the system right now and understanding it will probably make it easier for you,” Tony said with a shrug.
Tony thoughts came to an immediate thought when Jarvis continued, “It is Master Rogers, Sir. Dr. Banner believes that Venom would choose him as a host over Master Parker if he were more willing. He believes their DNA is similar enough that Venom could survive off him as well, seeing how the smaller pieces of the symbiote survived off him for that short time period. He told Master Rogers this and Master Rogers expressed willingness to do this. Ultimately, Master Parker would be free from Venom, however, Master Rogers will be trapped.”
He was the first to get out, quickly followed by Tony. His boyfriend was at his side immediately and grasped his hand tightly.
“…I do, I mean I think I do, I mean…yes, the feeling’s mutual,” Steve babbled to the figure miles away. He flushed and said, “I never thought you would want to be with me? I thought you did not want a relationship?”
Steve was amazing. He was sweet, caring, loving, and…and was just a bundle of perfection. He was a great person who did not deserve the fate history had written out for him.
“I came as soon as I heard about Fury,” Tony explained. “When I got here some agents delayed me, then led me down this dark corridor, and then got all cliché and tried to murder me in the shadows.”
Logan punched him lightly in the arm and grumbled, “All this serious and lovey dovey talk coming from you is weird.”
“Yes!” Bucky gasped, stepping into their room. He began to pace and Steve leaned back against the headboard. He could tell it was going to be a long night.
With Eddie no longer seeming interested in the conversation, Tony turned back to the screen and he and the other two heroes began dissecting the
“He was in Mama Bird mode,” Tony stated. “It was very endearing but at the height I had to fly he nearly froze to death.”
Almost divided this chapter in two but thought it’d be more fun to leave off with this angsty cliffhanger
They dragged it out, reluctant to let go and finally end it all. Tony didn’t want to leave Steve. He wanted to stay with him...to care and be cared by him...he wanted to grow old with him. But these were his last moments with Steve and he was trying to make them count. He tried to pour everything into the kiss and it seemed like Steve was matching him in emotion. They would have prolonged it forever if they were given the chance.
“You’re awake,” Tony whispered with relief. He held him tightly and gasped, “I don’t think I will ever be able to sleep again!”
Steve kept his gaze outside, watching the rain, and whispered, “…I didn’t realize I was so readable…”
Peter winced internally at his misstep but quickly stated, “Uh um, I’m not giving out any trade secrets until after the Nobel prize.”
Barton was the only one who wasn't there because he went out for Brock. Once the initial chaos of Venom’s capture was over, Steve took charge of his team and Barton was the first to receive direction. Getting Brock was their number one priority.
Peggy stood with a smirk and chided, “Honestly, all of you would be lost without me.” She clipped a bullet into her magazine and left him with one last nod.
. Steve was smiling at him, trying to get him to join in the conversation, and Peter was laughing at his stepfather without a worry.
“Can we please not start throwing around the F word around again?” Steve asked, flushing slightly from Tony’s comment yet he did not push Tony away as he leaned into his side. He was surprised Peter was not cussing already the amount Clint did it.
All he could hear were his and Tony’s gasping breaths and all he could feel was Tony’s lush lips, Tony’s hot skin beneath his fingertips, Tony’s hands on him, Tony’s hips jutting into his, and Steve’s heart hammering at his ribs, trying to break free.
A hologram opened before Tony of…what looked like two homeless men being pushed out of his building. They both fell roughly and Tony winced. The larger of the two lost his backpack and its top opened revealing…
“So…” Peter asked, “How does…I mean, Tony, how do you think he would feel about… well, about getting to know me?” With the question out there and by the blank look on Roger’s face, Peter quickly reiterated, “Err, or you know…Is he interested? Because if he is not interested then I am not interested. I’m just curious, you know? Who would not be curious? I mean he is my birth father, you know? His video he sent me just got me...thinking. What if he had, had a part in raising me or being in my life as a kid? I'm still pissed that he...I'm upset by this entire situation but I can see now it wasn't just his fault and...I...I want to see if we are alike and not in just in facial features. I mean, he’s a genius and, well, I’m pretty smart too. Who knows we might be on the same wavelength and can talk science or not…because he might not be interested… I just don’t know…What do you think?” Rogers’ eyebrows had risen through his speech and Peter flushed with embarrassment. He mumbled, “Sorry, I babble when I get nervous.”
“But, I’d like everyone to be there: the Avengers, you guys, my friends…” Peter stated, “I want my life to be as whole as it can be on my birthday…minus the fireworks.”
Ever so slowly, he leaned forward and gently nudged his head into her hand. She could feel him shaking so she carded her fingers through his hair like she used to. He relaxed in seconds and leaned more heavily into her touch.
He turned to his friends and held it out, showing them the blessed blue light. Steve laughed wetly and Tony smiled thankfully at Bucky. He carefully crossed the room and handed the reactor to Tony. Tony just as carefully returned the reactor and hissed when it connected to his body. He closed his eyes and settled back onto the table to recuperate.
Tony didn’t put up anymore of a fight with Bucky and went back to work, not feeling as enthused as he did before seeing that image.
“What’s going on Steve? Did Tony get out?” Bruce gasped. He held his own phone in a tight vise and his green eyes stood out in stark contrast to the rest of his face. When Steve stared blankly at him, Bruce gasped, “
His room had turned into a makeshift hospital with various machine sitting around his bed recording his vitals. Wade was dozing at his side with his limbs thrown over Peter in his bed. On Peter’s other side, and on the edge of his bed, his father also slept with his face buried in his arms and his bottom sitting on the edge of Peter’s desk chair.
Tony’s pulse instantly picked up and he let the photos fall carelessly back onto the dresser. Who was this man? Why did Steve invite him in his apartment? Why was he giving him water??
His master pressed the gun to the base of James’ skull. Natasha had been holding back her tears until that moment. She stared into James’ eyes, soaking up every last second they had as her eyes blurred.
“Great, I’ll take care of that after I figure out what the hell just happened!” Tony exclaimed. “Open up! We need to find Steve!”
He dropped the heavy winter coat and then removed the sweater that had been underneath. Beneath it, he wore a plain shirt, leather suspenders with two gun hostlers, and a belt with bullet caddies and knives.
Peter awoke the next morning with the memory of Wade’s lips ghosting a kiss along his mouth. As he sleepily woke up, he smiled to himself and he touched his lips as he remembered last night with Wade.
Bucky sighed and crossed his arms over his chest. He felt useless as he stared at the two men. But what could he do? Originally, he could’ve protected the future by nagging Steve and Tony to death but…he could do nothing against Tony’s illness.
Peter pursed his lips and watched the reaction with a critical eye. He wasn’t celebrating just yet. They had no idea what they created. The reaction settled and the beaker was the same dark as VENOM’s original color, except, no longer as opaque.
“If you love me, you would swear it,” Tony demanded, his fingers digging into Steve’s chest as his grip returned to strangle his shirt. Steve’s gaze constricted and skewed so he only focused on Tony and everything else around them blurred.
She blinked open her eyes to find him openly staring at her. His guarded expression was gone and his eyes were warm. She could easily read the love in his gaze. She smiled tightlipped to hold back her tears and she gasped, “And I only want you to call me Natalia.”
Steve went to see her but she did not remember him. She was an old lady with Alzheimer’s and she…she was very weak. She was not going to survive much longer and what destroyed Steve the most was that Steve couldn’t even properly say goodbye to her.
Peter opened his eyes to find Wade watching him and Peter wished he could see his face. He wished his mask was gone too. He felt separated from Wade with these barriers to protect their identities.
“…You were looking at Stark, weren’t you? I heard over the scanner that he stopped that hostage situation. He’s with Stark, isn’t he?”
The machine was turned on and, when he screamed, it was a mixture of pain, from his mind being torn apart, and horror, as he imagined what the Red Skull had planned for him and Tony.
Bucky looked down and murmured, “I remember you smaller and always sick…” He looked back up and said, “One of the first memories I recalled was of you was you sick…really sick, so sick I thought you were going to die. You lay in a bed, smaller than this one, and all the blankets in the apartment were on you. I was afraid the weight from all of the covers would be too heavy and you would suffocate but I was also scared that they were not enough. I thought you were going to freeze to death…I could hear the fluid in your lungs with every shaky breath you took. Your skin was so hot I thought it would melt but you shivered like you were sitting buck-naked in an ice box.”
All on Tony’s worrying thoughts slammed on their brakes upon Steve’s words. He…He wasn’t imagining anyone? But Tony was a man! Steve couldn’t be this turned on already unless—!
“Seriously, Pete, it’s all conjecture in the end. What you, me, Wade, and everyone else you love knows… that’s what matters, not what the press is gossiping about this week.”
Tony paused and, for a second, his mind sputtered as he searched for a reason for it to be gone. But then he realized what had happened in a matter of seconds.
Hope burned through the cold fear in his chest. Steve would notice his silence. He’d know something was wrong.
Tony laughed and crossed the room to place himself in front of Steve. Just being near the man made Tony’s blood pump with desire.
The repulsors went off before Steve could comment and Tony flew them over to the building where Pepper was imprisoned. Steve jumped from Tony’s hold before they landed and ran straight to the door he knew Pepper to be behind. Tony was right behind him with a singular blast from his repulsors.
Her eyes searched his, looking for him in his gaze. He made sure to stare straight at her and washed away the mask he usually wore. She placed her hand over his, encasing his hand against her face and squeezed hopefully.
Tony may have held onto Steve’s hand a fraction too long. Steve grip was strong, no question there, but his fingertips were still damp from his mouth, and Tony had a little brain fart. Steve wasn’t doing
Peter doubted there were any robotic aliens laying around that could do that. He just smiled and teased, “No special treatment for family.”
He spun around in the direction of the stranger’s call and felt his shoulders droop when he saw a couple of camera crews run over to them from the hastily parked vans.
Steve sighed and lightly touched his friend’s shoulder. He whispered, “Bruce, you should take a nap.”
“And I’ve got Wade,” Steve replied. They separated and ran in opposite directions. Tony was engaged in a struggle with two of the octo arms in a matter of moments, but it took Steve a few more seconds to reach Wade.
Peter sighed heavily and tucked his head into the crook of Uncle Bucky’s neck. He inhaled deeply and smelled his uncle’s sharp sweat, a hint of oil from his metal arm, and a slight residue of purity from his soap. Peter took comfort from the familiar smell and closed his eyes. When he was younger, he used to be able to fall asleep in his uncle’s arms. His warmth, his scent, and the rocking of his pacing reminded Peter of those times and he felt his eyes grow heavy. He would have fallen asleep if he did not have any trepidation about his guardians’ approach.
Norman was still holding the mercenary’s arm and he threw it to the ground with an angry huff. It flopped awkwardly on the floor and happened to land on one of his feet. He went to stomp on the limb but paused as he finally really looked at it. He was looking at the hand to be exact…a hand wearing a device he’d seen worn a few times by that time traveling freak, Cable.
Steve sighed heavily and went to run his hand through his hair but his fingers met bandages instead. He awkwardly pulled back his hand and whispered, “I don’t like hospitals, Tony.”
“I’m not interested in the super soldier part of it,” Tony retorted, rolling his eyes. All everyone wanted to know about Project Rebirth was how to recreate the serum. Maybe he wished he could be Captain America when he was a kid but Tony was an adult
Tony smiled teasingly at him and winked. Steve shook his head and began to step away but he teasingly mumbled under his breath, “You’re going to be the death of me…”
Steve collapsed, his anxiety at confirming his friend had survived was the only thing keeping him on his feet. The elation that washed through him made him fall to his knees and then onto his behind.
Pepper returned to his side with a mug of coffee. He accepted the mug and peered down at the dark liquid. He remembered telling Steve how he wasn’t a morning person because his spirit lingered with him until he drank a cup of coffee…
Tony had installed a reactor into the suit as soon as he was healthy enough to do so but, he hadn’t touched it since. Too many painful memories accompanied the suit.
“…Sir has displayed similar actions in the past,” Jarvis stated, almost carefully and Steve could not help but wonder how human Tony had made his AI. Jarvis seemed to know when to be gentle during tense situations and be almost as sarcastic as Tony during the light hearted ones. Jarvis continued, “When Sir and Mistress Potts annulled their relationship, Sir came here while Mistress Potts remained in the Malibu house. He has a history of running away, Master Rogers.”
He broke free from the murky water and flew back to the tower. His eyes were immediately drawn to the building. It glowed like a beacon in the cluster of opaquely lighted skyscrapers that made up Manhattan. He circled it slowly, taking in her energy-saving splendor.
. Steve was from the 40s. He still thought all of this was still considered “immoral” and they could be arrested.
“You need to help them,” Peter whispered. Uncle Thor looked at Peter with a troubled expression. Peter turned his head to the east and said, “Take me to Oscorp. I can hang with Harry until you guys are done.”
Pepper pretty much did the same but scoured Stark Industries instead to make sure their company wasn’t infested with any Hydra agents. Rhodey did the same with the army. He started first with his own division and moved onto others.
“If Peter were not here I would ravish you for just suggesting that,” Tony murmured flirtatiously. Steve smirked and his eyes trailed down Tony’s throat to where a dark hickey was forming. He licked his lips, wanting to put his mouth back on Tony’s flesh. Instead, he raised Tony’s hand with his and brushed his lips against his flesh there.
“I shouldn’t be alive unless it was for a reason…” He gasped to her with raw certainty. He sat back down at his desk heavily, his mind back in the cave with Yensen and then it inevitably went to the events of the last few days. Obie, his company, the media, and even the Enigma, Steven Edwards...“I’m not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do.” He paused as he took in her glassy eyes and earnestly said, “And I know in my heart…
Tony chuckled, imagining Rhodey sputtering already and then murmured to himself, “Then I’ll have to find another name other than Captain…It’s probably for the best, no one can live up to the great Captain America…”
Tony, almost sounding like his old self, cheerfully stated, “The way I see it, she only has two reasons to be here: she is here to help us or kill us.”
Tony moved as quickly as possible, pulling off his own shirts. He wore one of his old band shirts with a long-sleeved shirt beneath. Steve helped him only until the shirts got tangled in his useless arms (he was never wearing layers again) and then his wicked soulmate started to kiss and lick him. Steve was trailing his mouth down Tony’s body while he madly pulled at his shirt to free his arms.
Steve sat down and held the edge of the comforter. The winds carried the blanket over the edge and it billowed and flapped madly in his grip. He watched the world go by with the red comforter always in the edge of his vision. Vehicles would stop and go at the whim of the traffic lights and the pedestrians were an ever moving mass, indistinguishable from such a height.
Steve had yet to meet the alien Avenger but he read his file and heard humorous stories from the others. Apparently, Thor was back in his home world at the moment.
He gritted his teeth. He should stop referring to the Chameleon as Mary. It was an insult to her memory. The Chameleon had already tarnished it enough by taking her guise.
He had to tell Tony the truth. Steve was dead. That was why he was always there and never awake. That was why he did not age…but…
Their breathing became harsher as they kissed more enthusiastically and Steve began to slowly move against Tony in a hapless, wanton nature.
They continued their “testing” until Eddie threw a paperback book at him. It was small and Peter barely felt it because Eddie tossed it so lightly but it landed with a loud thump beside Peter and their supervisors couldn’t pretend to ignore them anymore. Both men walked over and the more senior demanded, “What on Earth are you two been doing?”
Tony’s heart went out to him. Bucky had been Cap’s right-hand man and had been like a brother to Steve. He had died not long before Steve supposedly had. To Steve, the death was still recent.
If they kept going, Steve knew they would end up having sex and, before kissing Tony, he would have protested doing so on a first date. But now that he knew how great Tony felt all he wanted to know was how much more amazing could he could be.
But Bucky was dead and soon Steve would be too. All the plans they had made once they returned to New York, amounted to nothing.
?? Why wasn’t I informed??” Thor gasped, gripping his hammer tightly. “I told you to keep an eye on Midgard and summon me if they ever needed me!”
Peter laughed and assured Wade he didn’t have to do that. He asked him how his outing with the X-Men went and Wade jumped into his story, making Peter laugh again as he described his antics and the team's exasperation.
Steve ducked his head as he was overcome. He hid his face in the crook of Tony’s neck and breathed evenly to try and control his emotions.
Bucky’s grip relaxed and he smirked sadly at Steve. He said, “I can handle this, Steve. Just be sure to keep your promise to your son. Don’t make me fail my mission, you hear?”
"I mean... we can do it the other way, but its going to be tougher on you, Steve..." Tony stated and his lips paused in their kisses as Tony gave Steve his total attention. He whispered, "I want everything to be perfect tonight. I don't want to hurt you anymore than I have to..."
“Sure,” Steve replied and stepped back. The doors closed before him and Tony’s grin never wavered. Steve found himself smiling too as his anticipation grew with every passing second.
Natasha sat on the end of the counter sipping on some tea and reading the newspaper. She merely glanced up at them before returning to her article.
Tony wasn’t fully convinced and murmured, “Are you sure? Is this like the calm before the storm? Maybe this is like your nirvana stage and you’re going to disappear any second…”
Coulson imagined someone carrying out Cap’s remains and bit down on the inside of his lip hard enough to draw blood.
“May I please steal Peter tomorrow for some tests?” Bruce asked, moving in tandem with Steve as Tony began to drag him away.
When the doors opened, the boys shot out and, by the time Steve and Tony stepped out, the boys had already disappeared into Tony’s lab. They could hear Harry exclaim loudly and Steve knew they had reached Tony’s suit.
He pulled Tony into a rough embrace and, after years of repressing his fears and sorrows, it all became just too much. He finally let himself weep.
“I can’t get you a bunk tonight. You’ll have to be assigned one by your superior and I have yet to inform the head of mechanics he’s got a new guy as he’s asleep.”
Before he lost his mind to his growing lust, Steve gasped, “I just want you to know… I love you and I so badly want to make love with you, Tony.”
“Ok, good, because the mainframe hook up to the brain makes it sound like I am,” Tony replied. “Alright, little guys, let’s make a heat seeking missile.”
Tony had made him swear that he told no one, Bucky included. Tony’s visible reactor would give away whatever deceptions they planned.
The witness nodded with a flush and Marcel glared at him for a few more seconds before stating, “What I find so odd about this dress is the fact that the stain is located on it.”
Steve and Colonel Philips had mapped out where the Commandos were going to look prior to the mission. If all went well, they’d be out there for four hours and be back before dinner time. As the hours passed and Tony grew bored, Steve was beginning to wonder what the cooks were going to make for dinner.
Tony landed in front of the machine and yelled, “Okay! We are stopping this right now! You!” He pointed at a soldier from the attacking force and the man flinched back as if Tony was going to shot him. Tony rolled his eyes but the man did not see as his face was hidden behind his face shield. Tony asked, “Who are you?”
Cable pulled the photo out of his pocket and murmured, “Well I’ll be damned.” He handed it to Steve and said, “You might be onto something…”
Tony turned to Steve and was surprised to see how close he was. When Tony leaned away, Steve must have leaned in, keeping little distance between them. Tony couldn’t help but flush and Steve’s eyes seemed to loom closer.
A few days later, Tony, Steve, and Bucky all gathered together in Steve and Tony’s kitchen to discuss Project Winterwidow Part Three. In the living room, Peter and Harry were playing.
Steve guiltily took his phone and murmured, “Sorry…I forgot about it.” Some mornings he woke with a 1940s mindset and, thanks to what was happening with Bucky, this morning had been one of those mornings. He had not noticed the phone missing at all.
“…We will get him eventually,” the man replied. “…But we have been looking for him for months and this isn’t the first time he’s slipped through our fingers…”
Steve smiled at his son feeling pride at the man he was becoming and joy from the fact that he was back.
Peter kissed him again, his eyes remaining open in tiny slits as he watched Wade and Wade did the same, mesmerized by the look in his lover’s eyes.
He frowned at the number, remembering the shorter but equally emotional conversation he had with the super soldier.
Steve was instantly enraged and hurt. How could Tony be so dense! It wasn’t that simple! Steve lashed back, "
To forestall any awkward silences from growing, Peter stated, “Eddie and I worked with our shield today and got some amazing results!”
Wade had been tempted to madly throw himself into the search, but he didn’t know the man nor did he know where to start. But Peter’s father instantly went to work, searching in his own way with his vast technical network.
“No, he’s just really smart,” Steve gently admonished. He touched Solo’s back to rub it but the man flinched and viciously swatted Steve away.
The jet was made for transporting large vehicles and military personal. Leaving Steve and Tony alone in its large hull.
With no technology to distract him, Peter lay on the couch beside his uncle and waited for his father and uncle’s return.
Tony sat up, the action fueled by fear of the unknown and the need to comfort his fiancé. He grasped Steve’s face with both of his hands and, before asking any of the thousands of questions forming on the tip of his tongue, he stated, “Then here’s my belated hourly reminder that I love you.”
Bruce did not testify, stating his temperament would not be able to handle it, and both the defense and prosecution wisely did not fight him on it.
Bucky stepped forward and demanded, “What happened to Steve?? Why the hell was I wearing his uniform??”
“You’re so amazing,” Peter laughed with him. He kissed Wade as his boyfriend gasped for breath, making their kiss as Wade needed to catch his breath.
Tony let out a huff that was a cross between a chuckle and a sigh. He rubbed the back out his neck and said, “Well Project Winterwidow One was a bust…Don’t worry man, Project Two will do much better!”
Steve grinned and kissed him as his heart soared from joy. Tony grabbed his arms tightly, as if he were afraid he’d float away, and Steve wound his arms around him to anchor himself to him. Steve pressed his hips into Tony and the man’s hands instantly shot to Steve’s rear-end and his fingers were quick to divulge Steve of his underwear and knead the muscle beneath.
’s jeeps to transport Tony. They both raced to location and racing time itself in order to fling Tony deep into its future before…before the unthinkable could happened.
! Steve that’s like the upgraded, flashier version of the time travel devices we used to travel back in time to get the infinity stones!!”
Steve’s huge body blocked most of the water from hitting Tony as he stepped in. He gently grasped Tony by the shoulders, led him backwards, and sat him down on the tiled seat. Steve turned and got the soap and a pink mesh ball from their caddy. Steve rubbed the soap into a lather on the mesh ball.
Tony was so taken aback by her declaration that he jerked back in surprise. His emotions ran wild as he replayed the statement “fake or real,” “100%,” and “heart on the line.” All of which alluded to something more and something amazing.
They needed to investigate this alone just in case this woman was an imposter and she had ulterior motives. But still, if it was his mother…they thought it best they meet in a more controlled environment. Peter’s presence would definitely complicate things…
Steve embraced Tony a little tighter. Tony lay his cheek against Steve chest and stared up at him tenderly. Tony’s hair was mussed from Steve’s attentions and his lips were swollen red from his countless kisses. His face was serene and relaxed like he had never seen before. Even working on his machines, Tony never looked this content. It made Steve feel special.
Peter lifted his arm to look at the dark accessory with surprise and murmured, “Would you look at that…I wonder why this stayed here?”
His communicator had rolled away after he dropped it and he did not hear the reply. Help was coming or they were alone. Either way, he was alone in fighting Schmidt’s words.
Sighing deeply, Tony replied, “Yeah, according to Friday, he's been mostly sleeping. I don't want to wake him. I doubt he slept much last night...”
Tony woke to Steve slipping out of the cot. Tony moaned and reached out to him to come back but, a moment later, Howard stepped into the tent and was probably the reason Steve left him in the first place. He was as glad he did it because there was no way he was getting in that awkward conversation with Howard.
Steve smiled at the other two Avengers. They arrived in the car after them but had been able to squeeze through the press without a problem.
Bucky’s fingers dug into Steve’s flesh and he whispered, “First, we’ll get Zola. Then, we’ll get Schmidt and his tesseract…with that we will get Tony home.”
Venom was a beast now. He could influence it like a trainer would do a lion. Use human victims to lead him where he would do the most damage to SHIELD.
“Look away, but tell me you are alright!” Tony gasped. His hazel eyes were wide with fear. Grime covered his entire body and his skin was dotted with abrasions. But he was otherwise whole.
“Us. I am calling an end to it,” Tony stated. He had to put an end to it. He wouldn’t let Steve stress about it because he would. He’d worry about hurting Tony or double think starting something with Sam. Tony was selfish but he wouldn’t take that from Steve…He deserved the best.
“Is it?” Bucky whispered and the smile fell from Tony’s face. That was right…Bucky was going to remember more than just his past as a Commando…he was going to also remember his time as the Winter Soldier.
Steve felt himself dissolve into Bucky. He tightly wrapped his arms around him and buried his face into Bucky’s shoulder. He began to shake and felt tears beginning to form again.
“B-Bucky?!” Steve gasped. He went to sit up but Bucky placed his hand on Steve’s chest. Steve tensed. Was Bucky here to finish what he started weeks prior?
Tony grasped his hand and said, “Bruce said he wanted to look over you again, once you woke up. You up for that?”
Gabe was an asset to keeping him alive, even the baking soda would help, but there was one more thing Steve could do that was probably going to piss off Tony because it’d change the future, but he had to do it. Every little thing would help at this point and Steve was willing to take any risk.
“Alright, get me a wheelchair, Bruce!” Tony stated. He tossed his laptop on Bruce’s empty chair and threw back his sheets.
The sky was nearly as white as the landscape but he was still able to pinpoint the bright point where the sun’s white glow was almost indiscriminate. From there he trudged on. He kept his head bowed and put all his concentration into walking.
But he did not pull away. He had to stop him but…How many times had he dreamed of Bucky doing this? He kept telling himself he would let it continue for only a few more seconds but after those few seconds he repeated his excuse over and over until it became a useless drone in his head. Steve closed his eyes as Bucky’s lips rose and followed a path along his jawline. Steve pushed him back for the action and cracked open his eyes, meeting Bucky's dark blue gaze.
Upon his communication, a large piece of Venom broke away from Peter and hit the pole of a yield sign across the street. The sign bent at a ninety degree angle from the impact then Venom squirmed around it for a few seconds until the sign fully broke off.
dare blame Wade for all of this,” Steve hissed. Stark’s hands clenched and his mouth twitched as he struggled with a response. Steve turned his hardened gaze to Wade and Wade quickly tightened his anus, preparing to be scared shitless by whatever he was going to say to him. Instead, Steve ordered, “Go inside and talk to Peter. I will speak with Tony and maybe we can salvage this night with our family somewhat intact in the least.”
Steve had never considered looking Tony up online until that moment and it sickened him. When he had first met him, he did not know how to use the internet and he trusted the file SHIELD gave him told him all he needed about his mate…but was there more? Did Tony truly sleep around?...And was he really flirting with others to…to find someone to sleep with?...like a woman?
Bucky. He was in the hologram, Steve. He shouldn’t have been there. The future changed drastically because Bucky survived. I had to make a horrible decision so I could save you from Hydra and fix the future.”
“He knows what he wants,” Steve murmured back. Howard was brash and didn’t let a little thing like army rank stand in his way.
“J! System’s check!” Tony demanded, gasping for air and hunching forward. He clutched his chest instead as the pain began to fade.
Steve clenched his fists and gave into his anger. He hated that everyone knew Tony was alive before him, hated that he was manipulated into guarding the President, hated that Peter was far away from him, hated that Tony was God knows where and was probably risking his life and too stubborn to ask for help, hated that Bucky was in the same room as him and was watching him with heated eyes that made him feel things he wanted to deny feeling, but mostly, he hated himself, the cause of all of this.
The only time she looked at him again was to state, “Steven is not gay. The whole time I worked in the Tower I never saw him nor Mr. Stark interact intimately. It’s obviously all a lie to discredit me. They’re friends so of course Mr. Stark would help him but Steven doesn’t love him. He loves me.”
“You were not listening, Captain,” he stated, like he was chastising a child. “I noted that you were always destroying my plans. I have learned a lot in the years since we last fought.”
It was the same photograph he and Tony had looked at an hour earlier of their future wedding. It was different though. The bottom half of Tony's body had disappeared and, as he watched, the fading slowly encroached up, eating away more of Tony.
“Shoot!” Peter put down the glass and hurriedly said, “I left him in one of the guest rooms to take a nap. I should grab him!”
“I don’ wan’ any,” Peter whispered morosely into Steve’s chest. Steve dropped his gaze to his son and his heart constricted.
Steve and Tony did most of the talking and it was about their lives and experiences. They gave her ample opportunities to jump in but she stubbornly remained silent. It was peculiar but Steve reasoned this was still a lot for her to take in. She had only just learned of Peter’s existence yesterday. She must still be traumatized by that.
Steve looked down at him with a smirk. Tony’s goatee was more grey than brown, and his hair was a lighter color due to all the grey and white hairs that sprinkled it. The lines on his face were deeper as were Steve’s but that was the norm for aging. The same amazing man he had fallen in love with was pouting at him for even hinting they were old.
He placed the gauntlet down and peered down specifically at the few notes his father had left in the wrong file. The papers were from the 1940s and had yellowed with age. Tony had thought it scrap paper when he first saw it but now he touched it with the reverence it deserved.
Steve suddenly inhaled sharply in surprise and Tony followed his gaze to the wall behind them and had to stifle a curse.
Steve mirrored his moan as his naked body pressed into Tony’s. The bare flesh of Tony’s chest rubbed against Steve’s and he frantically tugged at Tony’s pants to feel more of his flesh.
, what happened?” Pepper whispered, her grew face stark with worry and fear as she really looked at him and his bloodshot eyes.
Peter’s trip to the lab was much shorter now that he wasn’t coming all the way from Queens but he still managed to cut it close with how late he slept in.
Still staring at his lap, in Russian, he murmured, “I know it was stupid but I could not help it…I miss you, love. Don’t you miss me?”
Tony's chest ached. How long had it been since he last saw her? He'd seen her the morning he left for France so it had been what...Three weeks? Almost a month?
“Right now, I just wanted to say, without a doubt, you completed me. I never before felt an ease like I did when I was with you, Steve,” Tony whispered.
For a few minutes, Steve leaned into Tony and lazily kissed him. Their lips lightly lapped at one another, tasting each other, sharing in the sensations, and caressing warmth. They ran their hands over each other’s bodies, tracing the routes their muscles created and recalling how the other felt in their close hold. They woke up in each other’s arms just that morning but it felt like a lifetime ago.
As soon as Steve woke, he knew he needed to eat but it was a daunting task. How was he supposed to choose who to eat?
Bucky remained where he stood in the hall with stooped shoulders and a forlorn expression trained on the point where Natasha disappeared. Steve rushed up beside him then pressed the napkin into his bloody nose. Bucky winced but put his hand over Steve’s and applied additional pressure. Steve removed his hand and he was glad to see Bucky keep the napkin up to his nose.
They’d just made love and Tony carded his fingers into Steve’s and pulled his hand toward Tony. He looked at Steve’s hand and then murmured, “What do you mean?”
Feeling secure, he continued to scroll through the movies until he came to a stop at a familiar title.
“On foot?” The cashier reiterated like he was crazy. “You don’t have anyone picking you up or like an Uber or…anything?”
“Hydra kept their deaths a secret. If you have been watching the news lately then you know they had infiltrated SHIELD?” Tony said and Ben and May nodded. Natasha had leaked all of SHIELD and Hydra’s secrets onto the internet and it had been all over the news. She and Steve were blamed for the leak. It was common knowledge now but he had to be sure. Tony continued, “With Hydra’s downfall we have been uncovering a lot of things we did not know…”
Tony pushed himself up with a light moan as his muscles pulled and he stated, “Let’s clean up in the water and maybe we could do other stuff while we are out there.”
“I will protect him,” Bucky grunted with a frown. He stabbed his glare into the ground as everyone looked at him. He stated, “I have never failed a mission and Steve…your father, is mine now.”
Steve’s warm hand centered itself on his back and he whispered, “Or, maybe, he’s going to change because he met this amazing, young man and he wants to go on the straight and narrow, just for him?”
Wade sat beside her and grasped her hand, whispering, “I wish I knew…He’s gone, May…He was t-taken last n-night.” Wade’s last words shuddered and, in a smaller voice, Wade whispered, “I’m sorry…I know I’m supposed to be strong for you but…” Wade leaned into the older woman and she wrapped comforting arms around him even though he could tell she needed just as much comfort by the way her heartbeat rose. She needed to know what happened. He needed to be strong for her and Peter…so he forced himself out of her embrace and made himself sit up.
Tony had been walking around in his Iron Man suit for the last few days in an aloof manner but now he was all wide-eyed and clearly excited. When he was able, he shot Steve random questions about little things he saw like the shoes the soldiers wore or what duties they were performing. He clearly been wondering some things for days and had probably a buildup of questions for him. Steve happily replied when he was able.
He told himself it was for the better because he couldn’t give Steve what he needed. Steve was straight, but, most importantly, he was the kind of man who needed a strong, stable relationship. Tony's relationships were usually short or were merely fuck buddies.
They landed in an array of dazzling lights bright and sparkling as fireworks with glittering images of people and events passing before Tony’s eyes too quickly for  him to focus on.
Steve swam over to him, his muscles flexed with power and unyielding promise. His eyes were focused on him and were determined. His gaze sent a shuddering pulse of desire through Tony.
Tony shook his head and murmured, “I don’t know…I think I’m not in friendly hands…but they’re keeping me alive so that’s something…Let’s go back to kissing!”
The only thing that could have done this was neutron damage from the reactor wall. The palladium metal of the chip couldn’t handle the strength of his reactor and was breaking down under the pressure. It was leaking into his body, poisoning him.
Oddly, Steve reflected, Steve probably looked just like Tony and this expression was what Bucky saw as he fell from the train…His heart wretched at the unfairness of the situation. Once again, just when he thought things were going to be alright, it was all being taken from him.
He could still feel Bucky’s lips on him. Steve absently rubbed the feeling from his mouth then his eyes flickered to Coulson, who was watching them with an impartial eye, then back to Tony. He had to tell Tony what happened, he would never hide this from him, but had to do it in private. Steve did not know how he was going to react but he knew it should not be done in front of Coulson. Steve reassured Tony, “I am totally healed.”
Clint was the last to sit down, taking his usual place beside Natasha. The archer grinned at his best friend, perhaps knowing what was going on then looked to the rest of the table. Thor and Jane sat at the end, the only ones oblivious to what had happened. They had returned the night prior after the break in at the Tower.
Peter twitched and then dropped his gaze down at the beaker. His shield circled closer to his body, partially blocking Peter from Wade’s view.
“Cheetos, got it,” Wade said in quiet voice, still shocked. He shuffled out of the room and Steve chuckled lightly. Peter, meanwhile, looked from his boyfriend’s retreating form and then to Tony, smiling like it was Christmas.
Tony’s other hand reached up and lightly grazed the side of Steve’s neck before settling at its back. His fingers played with Steve’s hair again and Steve tensed automatically at the intimate gesture. He wasn’t used to
