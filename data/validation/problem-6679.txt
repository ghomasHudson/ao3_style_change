“You restored a time machine at age 15. I’m sorry but I’m not buying it.” Steve said. Morgan huffed and look indignant.
“Okay,” He said. “What does this thing really do then?” He asked. She smiled and held her hand out and he placed it into her hand. She pressed a few buttons and moved the parts around and gave it back to him. He looked at the little red dot and the coordinates, along with a country and it moved. “What is it?” He asked.
“Tony Stark blush might I be so bold as to say you have a crush?” She asked. Morgan knew damn well what she was doing. Push them in the right direction. He’d get it.
“It’s okay, you’ll get through it.” She said with a smile. “Besides, I get my life back.” She lied with a large smile on. They all nodded. “Oh one more thing.” She added. “Steve, while the rest of us go to San Francisco by plane,
“That good for nothing secretary of mine... I’m sorry, she told me that-” Steve was interrupted by the doors swinging open, and dozens upon dozens of reporters came flying in. Steve’s plan was working. They shoved him out of the way and ran straight up to the receptionist’s desk, yelling out a million different questions. Steve smirked.
“How many people are inside?” Tony asked. He could deal with one person, but multiple people? He had never seen more than two people before in person. Obie, and this guy Steve. And, of course, the hundreds of people he just walked by, but he never talked to any of them.
“Steve? What is going on here? Who is this?” The girl asked, walking in and closing the door behind her. Steve sighed. He walked over and placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder. Tony looked up at him with terror in eyes. The poor guy was shaking.
“Whatever she did it worked. I’m not even going to question it.” Bruce said, following Natasha. Tony raced Clint to Bruce after he had caught up. Steve looked around before he noticed something strange. It couldn’t be, they had been early. Hydra. He ran towards the group who was at the car now. They looked confused and worried at him as he was running fast.
“Sure you don’t. I mean, I’m only from the future, what do I know?” She replied. She was an ass. She knew she was an ass, but she was an ass that got the job done. Morgan basically implied that he and Steve were together in the future. Based off the look on Tony’s face he got it too.
“Could you make the glass so I can see them but they can’t see me?” She asked. He didn’t say anything for a minute but he did tune the glass up. She smiled. “Thanks JARVIS, you’re the best!”
“What about Natasha?” She hissed, making sure they could hear her over the phone but Tony could not.
Tony walked over to the bathroom and swallowed two pills, it was more than he normally had but JARVIS assured him that he would be okay, and in fact he,
“It’s doable.” She replied. “Okay we can handle this, we just gotta do some stuff here and there. It’s good I can do it. Thanks Peter.”
“Yeah, I asked him to help me. You’re really going to love this.” Tony said, adding a light tone to his voice.
A lot of people treated Morgan better than others after losing Tony. Rhodey, Pepper, Happy, Steve and FRIDAY. They all treated her differently than other people. Well, Pepper was understandable considering she was her mother. But it was strange to her. Morgan assumed it was because she was alike her father in many ways. She was a genius, her hair and eye color were practically the same as his, her personality was similar. She was basically a smaller Tony. (Which was saying something.) She did, however, inherit a few things from her mother, like the ability to stare down an entire room and make grown men afraid of her and she had her Mother's pale skin tone and freckles. Like her aunts and uncles would say, she was the best of both of them.
Tony stood in the lab, creating devices to help them finish the mission. Morgan had saved his life and now it was time to return the favor. Help her get her life back. He heard the glass door open and glanced over to see Steve. He smiled before continuing to finish his device.
“Fine. Do. Not. Get. Caught.” Bruce said. Tony gave him a smile and climb around the ship to where the laundry was. He grabbed a tight shirt and some leggings. Taking a deep breath he slowly let himself turn human. He was already dry from hanging on the ledge of the ship. Slowly, so he wouldn’t fall off Tony put on the clothes.
“Pep, Pepper, listen to me as your friend. I am working on something huge! I and cannot wait to show you. But I need a little more time. It is not complete yet but it will be soon. I am so excited about it. Please give me a little more time and I promise I’ll tell you all about it! It’s going to be great. I swear by it. Can you do that? Give me a little more time?” He asked. She giggled a little bit.
It took about 15 minutes, but Tony looked adorable when it was done. He had a crown of flowers in his short messy hair, except, it wasn’t really a flower crown, more like a bunch of flowers pinned to his head in a crown shape. Everyone loved the way it looked on him. He ended up almost skipping along.
Morgan walked up with her hands out of her pockets and had left her jacket with the Avengers. She made it look like she had nothing to hide. Which honestly, she didn’t. Unless you count her hand but she didn’t. He looked at her as she approached and tensed as she sat down. Morgan noticed his hand go toward his gun. She simply smiled at him.
“It wasn’t on the floor-plans, if someone was really committed, they’d find the floor plans and block every exit.” Tony stated simply. “Where are we going?” Steve sighed.
“It takes two to start a war. It was either of your faults. It was your emotions and your morals. It’s okay though, because I’m going to fix it.” She said distantly. Steve wasn’t sure if she was still talking to him anymore or if she was talking to herself.
“Stay where you are Pepper. I’ll come pick you up. We are going to by his house.” Rhodey told her. She nodded although she knew he could not see her.
’ Bucky nodded. The group turned to see Hydra agents starting towards them. Morgan moved herself in front of Bucky. Tony ran around the car to the trunk trying to get his suit out of its case. She watched the group produced their weapons (or in Steve’s case his shield) and start fighting the agents. Morgan looked back to where Tony was. A Hydra agent had a gun pointed at him.
“Every so often he’ll see something or someone or doing something that reminds him of his past self. He sort of breaks the brainwashing and he starts to remember things. Or just questions Hydra and runs away. So we have to find him first.” She said.
“I took apart my alarm clock. I’ll fix it again later don’t worry, i’m just trying to make something to use for a bit.” She muttered. “But of course I don’t have all the parts and It won’t work without them.”
“Well we're docking in an hour. Where are you from?” Steve asked. Tony sighed, finally getting his balance and leaning back on the rail.
“Aw, Stevie!” Bucky complained, the words were barely out of his mouth before Steve slammed on the gas and sped off, breaking about 18 traffic laws to get to the airport in ten minutes. A drive that should’ve taken at least 25 minutes to get to. The group piled on the jet and Steve told the pilot to speed it up at as fast as he could. Steve had a Doctor to have a word with. Bucky sighed, he would not want to Banner now. Steve was unstoppable when it came to his family. It was go big or go home and Steve was not about to go home now.
“Hospital.” He said. She opened her mouth to say something but he held up his good hand. “I'm fine.”
“Including you? Two.” Tony said. Steve’s mouth fell open and Tony felt his cheeks flush. “W-well I’ve never left my-my tower be-before what’d-what did you ex-expect.” Tony stuttered defensively.
“Agreed.” The group, even Cassie, got piled into one car. A few of them sat in the trunk which was apparently hilarious to Cassie. Bucky and Scott were in the trunk while Steve drove Hank sat next to him and the girls sat in the backseat,
“I talked to her.” Peter said. “I let her know we’ll be okay and we’re here for her as well. That Morgan is alone and needs us.” Steve smiled knowingly.
“Relax, I’m sure he didn’t mean anything by it, Tony.” Steve said, placing a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“Morgan even thinking about, changing the past could be dangerous. It may have consequences that you can’t handle.” Bruce said. She sighed.
we knew something was up when Morgan was covered in paint and we didn’t do anything. We didn’t even ask FRIDAY. We should’ve all done something Steve. It’s not your fault.” He said. “Just like Tony, it isn’t your fault. I swear.” Steve nodded.
“Bye.” the call ended. Tony would be okay, he had to be. Besides, it was only for a little while. He could do this.
No on really reads the notes but I LOVE love love! Reading comments about what you think will happen or what you want to happen or even like what you thought.
“Oh my god.” Tony gasped as he stared down at the man he just knocked out. This man was definitely an intruder, and Tony just knocked him out,
“Well, I’d rather be here but I pissed off my english teacher and she gave me an essay to write over the weekend for ‘extra credit’, that I don’t need, so I better at least start that.” She said. She wasn’t lying, her teacher had actually done that but she had finished it in the car ride to the compound. Instead she took the elevator back down to the lab. She was greeted by the bots crowding around her. “Hey guys, good morning.” She said smiling. “Ready to get back to work?”
“Of course.” Steve said. Tony had seen enough romcoms to know what to do next. He pressed his lips to Steve’s, and everything exploded. He had never felt this kind of warmth before. He loved it.
“My boy! You said you have news, what’s up?” Obie asked, clapping his hands together. Tony nodded and held up his prototype like a child held a toy up.
“Okay, that’s good, so you won’t remember me when I go back. I mean you’ll remember things I tell you but not who told you them. Like say I tell Clint that Tony is planning him a surprise party and then I leave to back home. Clint would know that Tony is planning it but he wouldn’t remember how he knew he would just know.” She explained.
“We love you Tony.” She said. “All of us.” He smiled. She helped him prop himself up  with a bunch of pillows so he could stay sitting up. “I'm going to text the guys to tell them you’re up.”
“Stevie, loosen your grip, you’re going to dent the steering wheel.” Bucky said. “If you haven’t already.” He said, giving it a strange look. Steve sighed and listened to Bucky and let ago a bit.
“Tony, Tony I need you to listen to me. Breath. Slowly. This is the last thing we need right now. What's wrong? What happened?” Tony looked up and met Rhodey's eyes. Steve had never seen Tony look so small. It made Steve want to kill whoever or whatever made him feel this bad.
“How are we going to get past the receptionist?” Steve asked before the doors opened. Tony looked at him as if he was insane.
“That one.”Tony said, before he could stop himself. He surprised everyone when he said that. Even himself. “That school has the best football team.” He tried. Steve pump his fist in the air and whooped.
“Building things for this mission.” Tony replied. “I really want this to work for Morgan. She needs to go home. She’s only a kid.”
“So boring! Mom says I can’t skip a grade no matter what! My teachers hate me and I have like two friends.” She said then her waffles dinged. She instantly brightened. “Ooh! My waffles!
the Stark heir, aren’t I?” Tony asked, standing up straight, looking Obi - Obadiah in the eye. Obadiah’s face hardened and he walked over to Tony. “You lied to me! You told me that people were cruel and hated me, when the truth is they’ve been looking for me for
The first part of the job went well. Steve confronted the man. Everyone was in position and it seemed to be going well. Tony stood among the crowd of people. He was surprised that so many people would be around here at night. And it was his job to get the all to safety. It was a cold January night, so it made sense for Tony to be wearing a ski mask.
“What do you mean it’s me, Morgan.” She said. and opened her eyes to see all the avengers standing over her. But it wasn’t her avengers. She screamed and pushed herself into the wall behind her. “What the hell.” She whispered. She looked at everyone of them. They were all there. Tony… he was there. He was staring at her. He was real. She did everything in her power to not run up to him and hug him. Besides all their weapons were aimed at her. She did not feel like getting shot today.
“Alright, now let me see, what forbidden story about your father do you want this year?” He asked. She sat up to face him, not wanting to miss a word.
“If you ever need me kid, I’ll be there. I promise.” Natasha said. “If I care for you in the future there must be a good reason.” Morgan laughed and smiled but nodded. They pulled away and Morgan wiped her face. “Come on kid, I’ll tuck you in.” She teased but they both knew that she would.
“Uh guys.” Bruce said, staring at something. “I think I found him.” They all went to Bruce and saw him, sitting alone at a table with a cup of what Morgan hoped was water and not vodka. Steve started towards him but Morgan held up her hand.
“Surprise me this year.” Morgan declared. Steve thought for a moment, before sighing. He wanted to tell her and he might not get another chance to.
“I don’t know. I made it awhile ago.” He said. “I have other things going on in my head.” Morgan shrugged and stuck her right ring finger into the desert. Steve looked rather offended, Bruce didn’t notice, neither did Tony, Clint raised an eyebrow and Natasha stifled a laugh.
getting older, while Steve was at the height of human perfection - just look at him. They threw each other into one of the walls, both trying to get a good punch in. Tony inched his way to his room, and tried to get the chains off with the help of the door knob; but ended up just breaking the knob off the door.
“Well let’s go kid.” He said. The two of them left to go down to the lab. It was like Morgan’s dream come true. Going to her dad’s lab with him. It was great.
“Tony, i've been sending you work too. Why aren’t you getting any of it done?” She asked. He could hear the desperation in her voice. He had to think fast to get her to feel better about it. It was almost as if an angel whispered in his ear.
convince Obie to let him go see the fireworks, he would be able to experience it with JARVIS. Tony smiled at the earpiece, It was prefect. All he needed now was a way to find the fireworks. And of course, Obie’s permission, but it looked like that wasn’t happening this year. He would have to wait for next year.
“Yep shipwreck for weeks and definitely has a place to stay.” Tony slapped his hand over his mouth. “S-sorry. I- I just am always sarcastic and I didn't mean for if too sound mean! I'm sorry!” Tony apologized. Steve laughed.
“They shoot repulsor beams, more powerful than a gun.” Tony let his voice trail off. He pressed the button again and they disappeared. He nodded to the girl who shrugged.
“I’ll handle it.” She said with a knowing smile. He raised an eyebrow at her but shook his head and was off. Morgan scrolled through her phone and remember the number from heart, from the stories she heard. Time to freak a grown man out.
"No, no, no. There is no way that I am in Avengers tower in 2013. It's just a dream and cruel inhuman dream. I got knocked out from the van exploding and- and this is my punishment for disobeying mom. It- it has to." She rambled. Bruce put and hand on her shoulder and she jumped, hitting her back onto the wall. "ow… okay not a dream." She muttered.
“Well I’d hope so since you do in the future.” She said. Also the fact that he was her father and if he didn’t like her that would be an issue.
“Thank you so much JARVIS.” She said and started off to the gym. Of course he was in the gym. Her Steve was always trying to get into the gym. Although now on one let him. He was too old. Now he was mostly out, exploring the world a little bit more and staying around for Morgan. She entered the gym and it looked a lot better now than it did in the future. Then again no one used it in the future, expect for Peter when he wanted to test his agility. He watched young Steve punch the bag a few times. She only saw him young a few times. Never under good circumstances. Once when she was like four and had a terrible case of Whooping cough. She was in the hospital for weeks and all of the living Avengers came. That was the first time she met most of them. The second was just after when Steve came to check on her to make sure she was doing better. And the third when the avengers came back to their house to ask Tony about time travel. The last time was the funeral.  She leaned on the door and watched him until the bag was blow off and brust.
“I have nothing to show you. But us, or Hydra and I don’t know if I can let you be taken by them. I know what they did to you and I don’t want you to go through that again.” She said, meeting his eyes. He could tell she wasn’t lying. He knew how to tell if people were, it was something he was trained in. This little girl wasn’t. He looked down before nodding.
The group waited anxiously for the elevator to stop moving. The doors opened and they all rushed out and collectively stopped in awe. The van, the portal to the quantum realm had been repainted and restored but it was broken… not like before but like it was used and wasn't ready.
“Okay.” He said quietly. “If Tony was her that would be a very different answer. But I still don’t want you to do this.” He said.
“Rhodey, what happened? It took me 20 minutes to calm him down. Me.” Pepper said. Tony stayed seated on the hood of Rhodey's car.
“You wouldn’t leave Bucky right? Then why would you leave Tony?” She asked. He didn’t answer and she counted that as a win. She simply smiled and walked over to him. She hit the bag with the back of his hand. “Can I try?” He nodded and stepped away. “Honesty is great.” She said before she started to punch the bag. She used both of her hands a few times making a lot of damage. (Mostly with her metal hand but he didn’t know that. It was still cloaked.) She spent a little time, humouring him before punch the bag as hard as she could with her vibranium hand, sending it flying and broken. She smiled and turned to Steve. “You taught me that.” She said with a smile and walked out of the gym. He didn’t know if she was talking about the honesty or the punching bag. Maybe both.
“Stop fighting it!” Obadiah said. “Or else I swear it, you’ll never see the light of day again!” Tony managed to slip a bit further away, and knocked off his gag.
“I know I couldn’t. When I lost Janet I couldn’t bare the thought of losing Hope too. We’ll come with you.” Hank said.
“Actually it’s not that bad.” She said. “All the people you trusted are good. You wouldn’t be as calm as you were if most of them were Hydra.” Clint looked up at her.
“Is that okay?” Steve asked, he was afraid she might be horrified in him. Having her ‘Uncle’ be in love with her father. Morgan smiled faintly.
“Oh my god I am so inconsiderate. I should just just back into the water shouldn't I? Yeah I'll just go do that.” Tony said turning around to jump back in. Totally and 100% embarrassed. Steve grabbed his arm.
“Show him things, keep him around here for awhile. Besides, to get good seats for the fireworks, we need to go early.” Steve said. Natasha looked up at everybody, getting their attention silently.
Morgan had a hologram projecting from her wrist. The metal one obviously. She was coding her little heart out. She had to finish it for the next day. She shook her head and scraped a page and started over. It wasn’t the ideal way to work especially because she was working with one hand. But it was Morgan
“I-I - They-They wouldn’t!” Tony protested. Obie shrugged and walked off into the crowd, he’d soon have Tony back. He wouldn’t let anything else happen. He’d get Tony back whether he liked it or not.
Tony left a pair of clothes under a rock where he knew Clint would look. He stayed true to his word and met with Clint and Bruce every night after everyone else was asleep, and he was having a great time. Tony and Steve were touring the town and looking for jobs for Tony. He was fascinated by all the jobs around and how different they all were. There were so many different  jobs and so many more then the ones the merpeople had. Steve was very patient and  explained everything to Tony.  Steve really liked Tony as well. He loved the way Tony’s head cocked to the side when he was confused and the way his face lit up when he saw something he liked. Steve wanted that smile to last forever, and he wanted to be the one that kept it there.
“Happy birthday.” They said in sync. Tony jumped, but relaxed a second later and smiled even brighter than before. He seemed to bow his head a little. It was small action that, to most, wouldn’t mean much, but the group recognized that he was saying he was lower than them.
“No! I will never stop fighting you! Damn it! I will never design or build you anything ever again!” Tony yelled back at him. “You have no right to me, or my designs!” Obadiah smiled and pulled on the chains harder.
“They are not ideal, but considering you’ve never spoken to anyone but myself and Mister Stane, I’d say better than most.” Tony’s shoulders drooped. He should try to have a normal conversation at one point with them. He was genius for God’s sake he could figure out how to speak.
“Steve, what’s up I’m glad you could get Hank and his family here to help.” Bruce said. He seemed sort of nervous. Not completely but somewhat.
“To the doctor’s silly. I told you, you have an appointment it was the only one we could get.” She said.
Obadiah looked at the art gallery in front of him. He had been able to track down the only Steve Rogers in New York to this place. Tony was in there, somewhere. Stane knew that Tony would one day find out about his parentage, but he didn’t expect it to all end so quickly, and he was not about let Tony leave so easily. But he had to play his cards right, keep Tony on his side. At least for now. He would rather not resort to drastic measures unless it was absolutely necessary. Reluctantly, he left the gallery. He knew what needed to be done. This was not his first rodeo.
“Sir, is a genius. As a child, he excelled in all of his education. That is another reason why Mister Stane kept sir in the tower. People would not hesitate to use him for their own personal gain.” JARVIS said. Tony absentmindedly smiled at the A.I for saving him.
“It’s Captain America.” She replied. “Anyway, if you don’t believe me, he’ll show up, if not, well what did you lose?”
“My dad is going to kill me.” Tony said with an innocent smile after they pulled apart. Tony kissed him again shorter and sweeter. “I welcome death then.” He said. Steve pulled him closer into a hug. They stay like that until the bell rang. This was good. This was very good.
“The suit I can in wearing is the only thing that can transport me back, I need to wear it and it will transport me back to the portal back home.” She said. “But it only had enough power for one trip, and not a round trip.”
“Yeah she pissed off one of her teachers. Tragic that girl can’t hold her tongue.” Bucky replied with a tisk.
“well, there was this lamp that automatically went on. I just got it the other night and it set fire to itself, then the whole house. My parents are going to file a lawsuit on the company who manufactured it when they get home from their business trip. I freaked out by the way my friend reacted and told me.” Tony said. “Sorry if I overreacted.”
“Okay, here.” Morgan said as she looked down at her tracker. Steve turned off the car. The group had been driving for hours. Morgan had lost track of how long it was but she knew it was at least four hours. They had been tracking Bucky and he had been on the move for awhile. She lost track of what state they were in as well. Everyone got out of the car and looked around.
. This man was huge, he was built like someone who lived in the gym. How was Tony suppose to defend himself against this guy when he woke up?! Tony took a deep breath, he really didn't need to have a heart attack right now. “JARVIS? What should I do?” Tony cried at the ceiling. He probably looked pathetic but he didn’t care.
“There are a lot of things that you don’t think you’d do but end up doing.” She muttered. “But no you are correct. None of you would let me. Not even Tony. But no one knew I was doing it. You were just in the building with me. So was Clint.” Morgan explained.
one. Everyone, save for Pepper who said she’d met them there, piled into two different cars. Tony, however stood on the sidewalk just looking at them with not even a hint of emotion on his face. Steve noticed, and got out of his car and walked up to Tony.
“What’s going on? Morgan? What’s Morgan doing?” Bucky asked walking over. Scott and his family were also paying attention now.
“Yeah, I know the layout inside and out. Besides JARVIS was watching me he wouldn’t let me do anything bad.” She said dismissively.
“What?” Tony asked. In one swift motion, Obie pulled a gun out of his suit jacket and  shot Jarvis in the head. Dead. Tony gasp and everything seemed to go in slow motion as Jarvis fell to floor. Tears burn in Tony’s eyes. Everything was a blur but something he can remember clearly was a short conversation.
“No,” He said, his voice cracking. “I want to go home.” He said, tears filling his eyes. But he didn't want to cry. Not in front of people. Real men didn’t cry, he reminded himself.
“What!? Know! There is no way I'm doing that here. There are people around me!” Tony exclaimed into his phone. His entire table looked up now, paying attention to everything he did.
“Dismal, you’re getting picked up.” She said. Tony frowned. By who and why. He packed up his stuff up and walked to the door. He would have to be careful. This person, whoever was picking him up, could be his killer. Steve and Bucky waved to him. He saw them but wasn’t sure what to do. He was kind of nervous. He guessed it showed on his face because he saw Steve give him a concerned look before the door close and he made the long walk to the front door.
“Would you remind me, dear. I’m afraid I’m over a hundred years old. You’ll have to forgive me if I forget a few things.” He said. She huffed again but Steve saw a small smile crack through her mock frown.
“Hey Happy!” Clint said as he took a mouthful of popcorn and the group went back to watching their movie.
“What are you thinking about?” Natasha asked. Still clearly not trusting her. Morgan smiled sadly. Of course she would ask that.
“You too seaweed brain.” Clint said hugging him back. “Now where are you going that you don’t want dad knowing?”
“Prove that you are from the future.” Tony said finally. She thought for a moment, before her eyes landed on the arc reactor.
“Sure that'll work.” Steve replied with a smile that would have made Tony collapse, but he was sitting. Thank God for that. Tony manage to smile back, he done, to avoid further embarrassment, started to eat his lunch.
“Well you mean the world to me!” Steve yelled. At him. Tony didn't not know what to say. “Well- that’s not- I mean-” Steve stuttered trying to recover from that. Tony grabbed Steve by his shirt, pulled him close and kissed him.
They walked around for a bit, and he always had one of the group members by his side. He felt… safe. Something he’d never felt before, unless he was completely alone. None of the vendor's caught his eye until he saw a one and his face lit up. He tugged on Steve’s arm a pointed to it.
The elevator dinged, and the two of them faced the doors as they parted to reveal Howard and Maria Stark. Steve could see the family resemblance, it was almost uncanny how much Tony looked like them. Almost a perfect combination of the two. Tony smiled nervously, and Maria slowly walked over. She took his face in her hands and looked at him. After a moment, she smiled and laughed with tears in her eyes. The two embraced and Howard soon joined his wife. Steve stood off to the side, smiling. He was so happy for Tony. He was free, and with his family. Maria looked at Steve and smiled. Steve simply nodded, but she pulled him into the hug as well.
The game was nothing special, but it was nice to be included. Bruce and him had a very heated discussion on how weird football was. Steve even made the winning touchdown, or at least that's what he had been told. He didn't really get what was going on. After the game, they went to a small diner just the friend group.
Steve watched Tony’s awestruck expression, and he couldn’t help but smile. The way the fireworks lit up his face was nothing compared to his smile. His eyes were practically shining, showing just how truly happy he was. This was his dream, and he was finally living. Steve had only known Tony for about 24 hours, but he was insanely happy that
“Mine are too big to bring up.” Tony said. “Come down to the workshop later to get them okay?” Steve smiled confused but happy.
“Oh god, I am so sorry. I didn’t mean to worry you guys it’s just. It’s complicated. I- I was- it was- there was this- argh!” Tony said pushing his head into the pillow.
So sorry it's a day late! But here it is! Thank you for read and I really appreciate comments! Please leave one! I take constructive criticism and more so please don't be afraid to comment!! Only one more and I hope to post my new Stony fic on Christmas day! Anyway please keep reading and leaving comments. Love you all!
“So much like your father.” Bruce said. It sounded wet. She smiled and laughed with tears in her eyes.
“Pepper and Rhodey want to see Tony.” Bucky said. “Nice to see you awake.” Tony smiled. “I'll send them in.” Pepper rushed over to Tony and held his face in her hands.
“July 3rd.” He replied. Huh. Close to Steve’s birthday then. She’d have to give him something. Something nice. Her brain came to life with ideas and smiled. She’d have to ask Tony for some materials but she could do it. It would be worth it.
“I can’t tell you that. But since none of you remember seeing yourselves that’s what happened.” She said.
“For you first time outside, sir? I’d say your vitals are taking it well.” The bot replied. Tony sighed.
“You are now part of our team.” The Captain said. Tony could’ve cried. That was it. Obadiah was going to die. Pepper and Rhodey would be safe. “That’s Bruce Banner, code name Hulk.” He said pointing to the brunette. “You’ll be working with him closely. The one you knocked out was Clint Barton, or hawkeye. The metal arm is Bucky Barnes or Winter soldier. The tall blonde is Thor Odinson. The brit is Peggy Carter. This is Natasha Romanoff or Black Widow. I’m Steve Rogers or The Captain.
“Hi. My name is Morgan.” She said. He didn’t reply. He just looked at her. She waited a second before continuing. “I know who you are.” He tensed even more. “But I’m not afraid of you.” He looked confused.
“You can do it Tony. Now get out there and kick high school's ass.” Pepper said. Tony smiled and rolled his eyes but got out of the car anyway. “You'll be fine!” she called us she drove off. Tony took a deep breath and stared at his schedule. Chemistry. He could do that. Room 214. There was his problem. He had no idea where 214 even was. Tony would not ask for help, he would not be the helpless new kid. Tony was a genius he could find a classroom. And he did. It only took him 10 minutes and he was on time. He spoke with the teacher and she told him to sit in the back with Bruce. Bruce was a short brunette with glasses and a forever confused look on his face.
“How’s the mobile system coming, J?” Tony asked, trying to take his mind off of his desolate birthday.
“Excellent, Sir. It should be complete in just another five minutes.” Tony smiled. With the mobile JARVIS, he could have him with him wherever he went. If one day he
“My first word was computer. Granted it was in Italian but it was computer all the same. Then my dad proceeded to shove a phone in my hands, much to my mom’s dismay.” She replied. It was true. Tony had given her a phone and Pepper just sighed and resigned herself to her fate that her daughter would take after Tony one way or another.
“Brucie-bear, you worry too much, I’ll be careful, and if worse comes to worse I’ll just turn human.” Tony shrugged.
“I’m sure. I’ve been here before.” She replied. He shrugged and muttered something that she was too far away to hear. She didn’t really care though. She watched as he sped off and disappeared. Morgan gripped her phone a little tighter before walking into the woods.
“You missed my birthday this year! It was two months ago!” She complained. He laughed again, with more heart this time.
“This is where the tracker says he is. Or at least where his phone is.” Rhodey said as he pulled the car over.
“could you pretty pretty please get us tickets to your friend's next football game?” Bucky and Clint pleated. Thor gave him puppy dog eyes and Steve gave him a small shy smile. He couldn't resist. And they knew that.
“Right.” Bucky muttered. She walked towards the elevator and pressed the button before turning to them.
Tony swam as fast as he could towards the ship. It was a ship! A ship! That meant people. Humans! He couldn't wait. Humans were the most interesting creatures in the whole world. How could his father not like them. The ship was so big. It probably held at least 50 humans.
“Nice to hear from you too, Pepper.” Tony replied, smiling at the familiar banter he missed. Tony was too afraid to talk to Rhodey or Pepper often so they almost never talked.
“Bruce you’re such a tattle-tail!” She called into the phone. “No hello? No how are you? Nothing?” She asked. “I
Waiting for the man to wake up was like torture to Tony. He watched the man’s chest rise and fall, nervously. What on earth was he going to do when he woke up? When the man finally started stir, Tony began to panic, and ran to side, out of sight and hidden in the shadows of the room. As the man woke, he instantly started to struggled, finding he was tied.
“Yeah, everyone is here.” Tony said. “Everyone say hi to Pepper!” Tony called as he held the phone out towards the group.
they alive and happy. I wish it was the same back home, but it's not. Ten years is a long time.” She replied. They looked up at her she was smiling now. “Celebrate the life they had.” She said. Before walking away, towards the road. They followed in shock. Natasha stayed for a minute.
“You may not know me well but I know you pretty well and I like you lot in my time so I figured why not.” She said. He chuckled and ripped it open. He stared questioningly at the device.
“Pepper, I need you to calm down. I know how hard this is but Tony would want you to be calm. Okay?” Rhodey said placing a hand on one of her shoulders. She nodded.
“Yeah, I’ll be okay.” He nodded. She ruffled his hair and he smiled. He was feeling better. She had his back. They all did. He’d be okay. They walked out to the others and waited for instructions.
“He’s always away doing something for our dad or something. He’s never home anyway. But yes, I miss him.” He replied. Steve smiled and saw Bucky smile ever so slightly.
“Is Mister Stane actually training his illegitimate daughter to take up the company?” The reporters, like always, were relentless. The receptionist picked up the phone and dailied one number.
“You sound like my brother.” Tony said and ran off down the hallway to find Steve. He was so close, all he had to do is tell Steve he felt the same. That’s all he had to do. “Steve!” Tony called. Steve’s face lit up and turned towards Tony.
“And when I heard your version of the story I understood. He blamed himself. But it was true.” She said.
I AM SO SORRY FOR THE LATE CHAPTER. I HAD A BUSY WEEK AND I NEVER GOT TO FINISH IT! I AM SO SORRY! THANK YOU FOR STAYING.
Tony’s head was spinning as he woke up. He tried to open his eyes but the light was too much and gave him a huge headache. He didn’t want to move or do or say anything ever again. The memories from the other night came flooding back to him. Obie, how could he have done that. It was almost too much to believe. Tony took slow breaths to calm himself down. He didn't need to have another heart attack. They hurt like hell. He should be happy to be alive. If he was alive. Oh God he was alive right? Tony opened his eyes and finally heard the all too familiar beeping noise from next to him. He was in a hospital room. At least he wasn’t dead. Right? He looked over to his side to see Natasha curled up into a hospital room chair.
The port-a-potty smelled, and was dark and small, and Tony hated it. He could manage, however, it wasn’t that bad. He used the hand sanitizer before leaving, and walked out into the cool air. It was an unusually cool night for late May, but the air was so nice and fresh, so much better than the air… inside… the… tower…
“What if she’s trying to go back?” Bruce asked quietly. “Like it’s a huge explosion where the portal is and she doesn’t want us getting hurt.”
“If you’re sure. Because, I’m serious I can find another place. It wouldn’t be so hard.” Tony said. Steve placed a hand on his shoulder.
“To be honest, neither do I. I just fix what was broken before turning it on. I took a few shortcuts so I guess that’s why you guys can’t bring me back now.” She said.
“Oh before I forget, Tony, if you want, I found so clothes that might fit you from when I was younger. They’re laid out on my bed.” Steve said, nodding to Tony. Tony smiled again and nodded back. He moved to leave.
Tony how unfair it was. Tony made a small noise in the back of his throat and Steve almost pulled away.
Tony’s earliest memory was of the fireworks. He loved the colors; well the ones he could see. It wasn’t easy for him to see them much from his tower. They looked so amazing, and he couldn’t get them out of his mind. Once, he’d even asked if Obie would take him to see them next time they went off, but it ended up with Tony being backhanded, and his room moved so he couldn’t see them again. Ever. He could still faintly hear them, not that he had been able hear them that well from his old room, but he heard them enough to figure out that they went off every year, right on his birthday. Tony wanted more than anything to see them in person. And now, he was going to turn 18, so maybe Obie would let him go this time. Obie wasn’t his real father, that much he knew. But Obie took him in when no one else did, his weak heart didn’t make it easy for him to handle. At least, that’s what Obie said. People weren’t nice and would eat him alive if he ever went outside, so maybe if Obie would take him to see the fireworks, he could be safe. That’s all he wanted, to see the fireworks once - just once - was all he asked.
“He's joining us if we agree to take down his target. And passes the background check.” The Captain said
“Excuse me but your buddy, Tony, over there built a robot when he was 17. We child geniuses can do a lot.” She said. Tony’s jaw dropped.
“He is just not with you.” Morgan said. “Alright enough about that if we go on like this than there will be no future left for me to get back to.” There was a silence.
Tony sat up in the small pull out bed. He wasn’t used to how dark it was, usually he would have something glowing in the corner to see by. He sighed.
to protect him. If he died now, it would be her fault. That was not okay. She ran towards him slipping away from Bucky’s hands and positioned herself between the gun and Tony.
It was getting late and Tony hadn’t slept well the few nights before. He yawned and rubbed his eyes like a child. It was the first time Steve had notice the dark circles under his eyes.
She spent about two hours cleaning everything and then another two hours playing with the tools and learning how they worked. It was 8 o'clock at night before she actually started working on the van. She worked on the thing in back first, fixing what she could, because she couldn't really understand it. She managed to fix and replace all the broken glass and replaced the wires that were frayed or fried and rewired those that needed it. She fixed a few metal bars that had broke. She stepped back and wiped sweat from her forehead and smiled as, at least that part, seemed brand new. She wasn't sure that it would even work because she wasn't sure if she was doing it right. It didn't stop her though. Morgan's phone buzzed and it scared her. DUM-E, who was very happy she was back, helpfully handed it to her. It was her alarm.
“Yeah. Really, don’t believe me I can call future you and ask.” Morgan replied. Clint shook his head and stood up. He seemed better after she assured him that his judgement was good.
“Struggling-” Tony began, his voice shaking and took a deep to steady (Both his voice and himself). “Struggling is pointless.” He tried his best to sound brave, but he had never had the need to do that before. The only person he had ever talked to before was Obie.
“Miss left about 3 this morning. She got into a taxi cab and seemed to have paid with her own cash considering that she didn’t take any of yours.” He replied.
“I don’t think she’s a threat.” Steve said. Young Steve, not old man Steve. She hadn’t seen him seen she was five!
“How exactly do you eat this?” Tony asked after a full minute of staring at it. He saw Clint’s jaw drop.
“Well, he’s dead now and I do not want anyone else to be killed by him.” Tony said. He face showed how serious he was. Widow tapped The Captain’s shoulder.
not telling Pepper.” Steve nodded and crossed his arms, waiting for Bruce. Giving him the Captain America ‘I’m waiting for the truth’ look. “She going to try and change the past.” Bruce said. Steve froze. She was what? Change that past? Could she do that? What would she do? What if she kills herself that way? She’ll cease to exist. Morgan would be gone and for what?
hide the bag. He wasn’t sure how no one noticed, but if anyone did, they sure as hell didn’t say anything. It was dark now, and the fireworks were going to start any minute, and Tony was getting excited and he knew what he had to do. Tony took a breath and handed the bag to Steve.
“Rhodey, Rhodey, Rhodey..” Tony said until rodi turns attention to Tony. “I- I think I'm getting overwhelmed.” everyone saw a Rhodey get scared. He actually picked Tony up and sat on the hood of his car.
reach, especially a Stark. After Howard, I tried my hardest to make it hack proof. It’s not just technical, it’s everything. She’d need to not only get into my company but my house and lab. It’s not going to be easy.” Hank explained.
too many places he couldn’t see. Blind spots. Blind spots were dangerous. But when Natasha sat behind him, her back up against his, Clint on his side, switching between talking to Natasha and Tony, Steve in front of him, and Sam and Bucky arguing on his other side, he felt a kind of safety that he had never felt before. A kind of warmth inside of him that was totally new. It had an addicting feeling, and Tony never wanted to leave it. But, he had to pee. He hadn’t realized that they had been talking for so long, and it was almost dark.
“Aye! A most wonderful day.” Thor exclaimed. The two smiled and sat closer as they were now out in the open. It was nice. These people cared about him and had no idea who he was. This was true friendship. Maybe he shouldn’t lie anymore, tell them who he really is. He figured Natasha already knew on some level. He had built Bucky a new arm to replace the old prosthetic but he didn’t want to give it to him in case. He was dying to do all of it.  He would tell them. Of course not in school.
“first off, I had a heart attack because I was kidnapped. Second it isn't the classes that bug me. It's all of the people! In college if you don't say anything and don't do anything to anyone, people will leave you alone. Isn't it isn't like that in high school.” Tony whined.
Tony walked to the doors of Obadiah’s office. He didn’t want to go in there. But he had to, he’d do it and everything would be alright. Besides, Tony wouldn’t be the one to kill him it would be Steve. Whom Tony loved above all things. After Pepper and Rhodey left, the  two continued their ‘conversation’ and we're now officially dating. Although no one but Bucky (who had walked in while they were kissing) knew. And it took a lot of threats from Steve and blushing from Tony, to convince him not to tell anyone. Tony knocked on the door.
“Good. Now, take your meds and go to sleep.” Obie said. “I’m not trying to be the bad guy . Don’t make me the bad guy. I am just trying to protect you.” Tony nodded, he understood. Tony was irritating and ungrateful, Obie was so kind to him, and he kept asking him for the one thing he said he couldn’t have. He watched Obie leave, his dominating air leaving with him. Tony sighed and wiped his eyes.
“It searches through the internet and anything with the tag, ‘Captain America’ or ‘Steve Rogers’. But I have some blockers on because the internet is a weird place and there are somethings you don’t want to see. You could always unblock, because maybe you do want to see those things. I don’t know. Turn it on.” She said. Steve had slight blush on his ears, but he turned it on anyway. There were a few words that scrolled across the screen. It read ‘Meet me in my room and I’ll explain it to you how it really works.’ He looked up her and smiled.
“Shh, Shh. It’s okay. It’s alright. It’s over now. We’re all safe.” Steve said. Tony looked up and kissed him. Everything was alright.
“Hello.” Tony said bowing to the best of his ability. Steve pulled him back up into a standing pose.
Tony paced back and forth in his apartment, it was almost seven. He was so nervous at how they would react. What if they left? That would suck, Tony didn’t know if he could handle that. God, why was this so difficult. Why did someone have to try and kill him? He could’ve have such an easier life they hadn’t. Everyone showed up slowly and over time. Steve arrived first and the two of them cuddled, which calmed him down a bit, until Natasha and Clint showed up, then Bucky and Bruce who carpooled and Thor who seemed to have walked. He sat down on the couch. He took a deep breath.
What surprised everyone the most, was that Tony knew which utensils use and when. He had perfect table manners and even thanked the staff. Steve let his jaw drop a few times which Bucky had to tell him to close it. All four times. After dinner was the three of them having a nice chat. Tony talked about his brother a bit and a bit about Bruce, but he mostly listened to the two brothers fight with each other. It made him think about how much he missed his own brother. It was nice to be in company nonetheless. But everyone was exhausted and they all headed off to bed. Well almost everyone.
“Of course you’d ask that.” She said. “You guys are doing considerably better than you were doing ten years ago.”
“Yeah, I know how brothers are, I have one back home. I lost my mother as well, shark attack.” Tony said. Steve nodded. They both stood that for a minute.
“Christ.” She muttered smoothing her hair back. She came to a realization. “What year is it?” She asked. Tony frowned at her.
Pepper sighed, but she was happy. Tony was doing alright. He was safe and happy and working. Rhodey was with him which gave her no reason to worry. Then her phone rang.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you before. I understand if you hate me.” Tony said. Steve grabbed his shoulders and kissed Tony. They both pulled away and Steve embraced him.
Also if my Russian is bad I am so sorry! I know very little Russian and I used google translate so I am sorry if it's off!!
“I thought we got rid of that fantasy years ago, boy.” Obie spat at him. His gaze made Tony feel like the garbage he was constantly reminded that he was.
Tony ended up with a fractured wrist, a black eye and the bottle almost made him bleed out. He had come just in time, otherwise he'd have to have a blood transfusion. Pepper and Rhodey wanted him to stay but Tony refused.
“It was a recorded message. From ten years ago.” She replied. She stood up and faced the lake. “I lost two people ten years ago today. I was five.”
Suddenly, the clattering stopped in the next room over. Tony froze, unsure of what the outcome was. Was Steve dead? Had Steve won? He slowly peaked around the corner, to see Steve tying up Obadiah with same cords that Tony had tied Steve up with. He smiled at the thought, and proceeded to fall on his face.
hurt. After getting through the fact that she left, he understood that it was healthy for both of them to break up. She wouldn’t be worried about him dying in battle anymore and he wouldn’t have to worry about her possibly being targeted because of him. He wasn’t even
It Tony about a month to track down the one. The one that would take down Obadiah Stone. His Uncle. His father’s friend. His enemy. Obadiah had to die. Tony spent the month doing research and training himself for what was coming. The Captain would not see just anyone and he knew his claim would never be approved, so he would have to take matters into his own hands. He had stashed all different weapons on his body and wore all black. He placed a mask covering his mouth. If he waltzed right in there with no mask he’d be easily recognised and that was not what he wanted. The Captain’s headquarters was based in Brooklyn, of course Brooklyn. Tony hated going down to Brooklyn because of all the turf wars and muggings but tonight he would not hesitate to get rid of anyone who got in his way. Lucky for Brooklyn, no one bothered him. He waited for right time. When most of The Captain’s inner circle was gone. Of course at least one of them was in there but he waited for some of them to be gone. Then he made his move. The guards at the entrance weren’t much of a chore. Inside was a bit harder but Tony managed. Of course he didn't kill anyone and didn't inflict any lasting damage. Just get them out the way. He was right at the doors to The Captain’s office like area. He burst in and The Captain stood up, surprised. That gave Tony conference that he was stealthy enough that he didn't know he here. Tony rushed up towards him and after a small hand to hand The Captain thought he had Tony. He was wrong. Tony had never felt so calm, even though he had a gun to his head.
“Uh, fine.” Tony stated. “We should be able to access them in about a minute. Why again?” Morgan sucked in a breath.
It took about an hour for the entire inner circle of The Captain to get there. One of them (Barton) was a guy Tony had knocked out and was glaring at him the entire hour, since he was already there. There were six of them. One of the guys, with a metal arm, sized Tony up.
“It’s a surprise.” She said and winked at him. He scoffed. She gave him a dazzling fake smile and went over to talk to Natasha. It was a half hour before they had any news.
His hands started to shake and he stumbled to grab another one of his inventions to see if it matched. He grabbed an old circuit board and tried the same thing. It matched. The same symbol. He wasn’t… he couldn’t possibly… Obie wouldn’t have… No. It had to be true. He was the missing Stark heir. Shocked, Tony stumbled and knocked into a few things.
Pepper looked at the small device curiously. She had no idea what it was or what it could do. She then looked up at Steve.
“So we need to contact her, right? Tell her to find the Particles and then she can come home.” Clint asked.
“The crash wasn’t an accident, you cut the breaks…” Tony let his voice trail off. He was shocked. The man who had been like a father to him was dead on the floor and the man who saved him from his actually father had just murder one of the most important people in his life. Tony didn’t know what to do.
“If you don’t know for sure than you should go for it!” Tony called from behind her. She stifled a laugh.
“I promise you’ll be safe. You’ll be fine.” Steve said. Tony tilted his head to the other side and scrunched up his nose.
“Show them what you can do.” The Captain said. Tony didn't know what at first but then nodded and pressed the button on his neck.
“Bad news.” Peter said. “First is that your suit, only had enough to go there and not back.” She sighed.
“That’s great so I can come home, or is that part of the bad news?” She asked. Tony perked up and smiled at her.
“And the payment.” The girl from before answered. Everyone gave The Captain a look that was a mix between annoyment, shock, and disappointment. The girl snickered and The Captain shot her a look.
he reminded himself, and walked off to take his medicine. He needed that medicine like he needed air; He couldn’t live without it, his heart would most likely stop if he did. Tony looked at himself in the mirror. That blow would most likely leave a bruise but, nothing too bad.
“Would you believe me if I said my Auntie Tasha?” Morgan asked. Natasha raised an eyebrow. “Yeah well, that’s what I was thinking about.” She muttered.
The park was bigger than Tony could have imaged. There were people in booths everywhere. They were all yelling, and it was so loud. It was pure chaos, but Tony couldn’t care less. He didn’t like the fact that there were so many people, but he felt better when Natasha put a hand on his shoulder. Tony smiled. He could do this.
“I- I’m sorry I should’ve asked it’s just- ah I’m sorry I shouldn’t-” Tony cut off Steve’s adorable babbling with another kiss. It was Steve’s turn to make a surprise noise. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist.
“Straight A’s, boring and I know all this stuff.” Morgan replied before sitting up and facing her mom. “Mom, why can’t I just skip a few grades! I know everything and I am so bored in class! I want to learn more!” Pepper chuckled.
“You are okay Sir, but I recommend taking you medicine as soon as possible. But as of right now you are fine.” JARVIS said. Tony nodded.
“Yeah, sure why not?” Tony asked. High school sucked and it probably sucked more if you weren't a genius.
“That would be the pizza.” Steve said getting up, and returning a few minutes later with two large boxes of pizza. He placed them on the coffee table, and everyone grabbed a slice. Tony titled his head to the side. It became a habit he developed from the lab. If something didn’t make sense Tony would tilt his head, and sometimes the different angle would help him see the issue. It sort of carried over into everything he did. He grabbed a slice like everyone else and just held it with a questioning look on his face.
“Oh, that. Right I forgot.” She said. “Hydra and SHIELD are one. Well mostly- 50 percent.” They gaped at her.
“This kid may be incredibly smart, but he couldn't tell you a thing about sports for the life of him.” Rhodey said.
The only thing Tony could think of was how guilty he felt about leaving Jarvis’s body there. He’s mind wasn’t straight he couldn’t think of what to do. If this is what happened now, there was no telling what Obadiah had done in the past few years and what he will do in the future if Tony let him stay there. But he couldn’t have Rhodey and Pepper die too, he couldn’t handle losing everyone he loved. He wouldn’t lose everyone he loved. He would not let Obadiah do that. Even if it meant Obadiah’s death. Better him than them. All he saw was red.
she’d be back there at seven and they’d know she left. If they were going to know, might as well do it in style. Yeah, she really was Tony’s kid. She started off towards the woods.
Steve and the others rushed over to Stane’s tower. They burst through the door, scaring the receptionist.
“Why? You didn’t cause the crash. I never met them anyway.” Tony said. “But it’s safe, right?” Steve nodded.
“Tony, you can’t. You’re injured. There is no way that in a week you will be able to completely heal.” Steve said. Tony shrugged and swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood up with little support. No one could stop him.
“What in the world?” The man muttered. He looked for his bag and camera, but they were nowhere to be seen. He continued to struggle.
“Shut up that was one time.” She heard Tony said. She smiled and rolled her eyes at their antics. But she noticed something, in Steve’s eyes. He seemed different. Not in a bad way but almost… she gasped. Love-struck. He was so in love. How Tony couldn’t see it she would have no idea ever. It was obvious. Was it just her? Did she know him too well, or was everyone an idiot?
“I-I’ll check upstairs, you check the lab.” Pepper stuttered and made her way up the stairs. She walked along the hallway, trying not to cry. If it was ever quiet in Tony’s house, it met he wasn’t around. Why had he lied to her? What was he really doing? Why couldn’t he tell her?
“What’s wrong? What happened with Morgan?” Rhodey asked already rushing up to Pepper, holding her close.
“Steve loves me?!” Tony said, he was ecstatic. Steve loved him. That’s what he wanted. That’s why he came here. Bucky saw the look in Tony’s eyes and hesiated. “I would never do anything to hurt Steve. Not intentionally anyway. I- I love him too. I wouldn’t want him to be hurt. I promise you.” He said. Bucky softened a little.
“When you have the right materials it kinda just flows… I guess.” Tony muttered as he pressed the button again.
“I'm Prince Steve Rogers.” Steve said. Tony’s eyes widened. He was a prince himself and he knew the correct etiquette. Tony shoved away and tried his best to bow.
Wait - hot? Did Tony just think of Steve as hot? Was that even allowed? Tony had seen romcoms, and even a few Hallmark movies around the Christmas season, but not one of them had shown two guys getting together. Tony did his best to shrug it off.
“That would be a good idea but too bad i’m right here.” Someone said. Tony whirled around and saw his brother floating there. Tony hug him.
“Everyone hide!” Clint yelled and dove under the sofa. Natasha and Morgan looked at each other before sitting down behind the bar where they were invisible to the elevator. The doors dinged and opened.
“It was all right. I have what seems to be your friend group, they love your school's team and by default, you.” Tony snickered.
“I know I know!” Tony whined. “It’s just there is this really cute guy, and he’s letting me stay with him and- and I really like him!” Clint sighed. “Maybe- maybe if he likes me back we can create a bond between merpeople and humans. That way we can stop worrying about getting caught!”
“I do not believe you said anything wrong. You simply shared your sleeping habits with them. Also, don't you prefer to be alone?” JARVIS asked. Tony smiled. He liked how JARVIS would sometimes ask questions.
“Ah, Tony. What brings you here.” Obie asked. Jarvis closed the doors behind them. Tony sat down and Jarvis stood behind him. Tony explained what had been on his mind for a few weeks. About, how he was ready to assume control of Stark Industries. It took 30 minutes and Obie’s smile disappeared. Tony got a sinking feeling, but stood his ground. Obie stood up silently and walked over behind Tony and Jarvis who turned around to face him.
“Time for presents!” Clint exclaimed thrusting a poorly wrapped gift into Steve’s hands. The others did the same.
“I’m going back to the water.” Tony muttered and actually turned to leave but Steve grabbed his arm and turned him around. He literally pushed him into the dinning room while Tony tried to walk away but couldn’t. All while he muttered ‘No’ repeatedly.
Morgan made her way into the elevator for her normal ‘let’s see if I can get in trouble’ act everytime she went to the compound. But something caught her eye this time, a button that she could’ve sworn wasn’t there before. Well, she was here to get in trouble so she pressed it. The elevator slowly made its way down to the mystery floor. FRIDAY hadn’t said anything yet and she knew that if what she was doing would hurt her FRIDAY would say so. FRIDAY didn’t really talk anymore. She only spoke when spoken to, and even then she would answer in as few words as possible. It was pretty bad at first. She got a bit better over the years though. She would only talk to Pepper and Morgan in the same way as before, especially Morgan.
“Is it safe?” He asked. “I’ve seen a lot of movies, and half the time the cars are safe but the other half it isn’t.” Tony said.
Tony had a blinding pain in his head when he woke up. Another pain in his lower abdomen. He groaned in pain and looked to his right to see Steve with his head in his hands.
“Three days?!” Most of the group exclaimed. Bruce didn’t, he knew how it was being caught up in your work.
“This is Tony Stark, he has been adrift for a least a week, he will be staying with us for a little while. Could you run him a bath and get him new clothes while I talk with my brother?” Steve asked.
Steve waited, they had moved over to the side a bit, but Tony should still have been able to find them. But, he had been gone awhile now.
“Before my large mental break down,” Tony started calmly which made the British girl snort. “I was able to convince Obadiah to not cancel any of Maria’s or Howard’s I guess. It wasn’t right that just because they were dead that their charities that so many people depend wouldn’t be able to live. It makes no sense. And like I said before, money is not an object.” Tony said as if it was obvious. Which it wasn’t. The group shared a look. Tony started to feel uncomfortable. It was like they were talking to each other.
“I kicked your desk by accident. I’m sorry.” He muttered keeping his gaze low. The blood stain from where Jarvis was killed was still on the floor. Tony wanted to throw up but he stood strong.
“JARVIS, am I okay?” Tony asked, his voice was still slightly shaky. Pepper looked confused and Steve gave her a look telling her that he’d explain later. She nodded and sat down on the couch, and spread out some some papers on the table.
“Neither. You were shot.” Steve said. His voice crackled here and there. Tony didn't like that. The memories from that night came back to him. Tony tried to sit up.
“We need to talk. I understand that you got a call for Morgan this morning.” Steve said. Bruce froze.
What they didn't plan for was that the man would have an entire gang of back up. As soon as Steve approached him all Hell broke loose. At least 20 different 'civilians’ pulled out guns and started to shoot. Tony knew his job and acted immediately. He shoved people towards safety.
“Just pick a time, I have absolutely nothing better to do. And don't take that as a compliment. It is just I'm new here and have no social life.” Tony said. Not that he had much of one before. People couldn't handle him. He didn't blame them. He was a handful.
“No.” She said plainly. “But no one knows what’s in it.” She pulled her finger out and it was a gold color instead of red. “That means something in this will hurt me. Probably strawberries.”
“Hey, Hey. Tony look at me, calm down. It- It’s fine. It’s just Pepper. She’s a friend.” Steve said. Tony nodded, and slowly put his wrench away. He hesitated - he still looked like he was about to cry, but he seemed to be better.
Tony woke up as light streamed into the room. At first, he was confused; he didn’t remember leaving his shades open last night. Then, he realized that he wasn't at home. He was at Steve’s house.
“Shut up that was one time!” Tony pouted before returning to his bomb. The room was dead quiet. The sounds of the machinery Tony was handling was the only noise. It wasn’t fair. Tony looked cute when he pouted. Too cute. His curly hair fell into his face, his cheeks red, flushed from embarrassment. His bottom lip moving ever so slightly more forward than his top.
“Yes, but there are people so close. Whenever I was alone at the tower, people were never close by. I don’t know, this just feels different.” Tony replied with a shrug.
Tony stared at the large, transportation device. He had seen them in the movies and on TV. shows, but he had never actually been this close to one. Let alone actually been
“Three days?!” The small Brunette exclaimed. “How on earth did you build that in three days!?” Tony shrugged still a little nervous.
“Do you know where she is?” He asked. She could get into huge trouble if she was out there alone. She had been seen with the Avengers far too many times. She could be hurt.
“Who were you talking to?” Clint asked, trying to keep it casual. She wiped her face with right hand.
they did go to bed pretty late last night. Also, it was like six in the morning. Tony’s internal clock sucked. He worked fast, as he was used to rushing, it happened often. He usually found himself with a deadline and would have to pull all-nighters just to get things done in time. Taking forever to make coffee would be a waste of precious time. He would hate to see what Obie would do to him if he wasn’t on time and perfect with his prototypes. He smiled at himself, he had always made his coffee in, bulk but it was never for anyone else before. But it was just then that someone opened the door. He spun around on his heels, losing his balance for a minute and leaning against the counter. He faced the door, and a girl with strawberry blonde hair was standing in the doorway. He was not sure what to do for a moment, then he remembered he’d kept the wrench in his pocket, and raised it towards her. His hands were shaking, and he could tell his face showed how terrified he was. This person
“If I let you go, you will take me to see those fireworks. And then, you will take you to back here and I will give you your things back. I won’t press charges.” Tony said. Steven seemed to think for a minute. Tony realized he was most likely trying to come up with an escape plan. “And if you even think about running, I will send the video of you breaking in here to the police, and every officer in New York will be searching for you.” Steven’s eyes widened, this could ruin everything. He only nodded in response.
“I love you 3000.” He said before it retreated back into her hand. She placed her head on her knees and took a shaky breath.
“I love you too.” She replied and hung up. Noting wanting to stay in her new room and her normal room being occupied she went to the common room while everyone else was sleeping.
“Shut up!” Tony said pointing the wrench at him. “Now, I have a proposition for you... Do you want your stuff back?” Tony asked.
“Probably, but it’s too late now, we should trust him.” Steve said, looking around for Tony. Pepper walked up beside them.
“I’m not.” She cut him off. “I’m not going to tell them. I’m going to help them though. I’m going to nudge them and if it doesn’t work then there’s no fixing them it’s fate. It’s just… I’ve been lead into a new light recently and I think I could help.” She said.
It was early morning and Bucky was waiting. If Steve loved this boy he’d need to have a conversation with him. To make sure things were clear. Tony made his way down the hallway looking ever happy. Bucky stood in front of him.
No one said a word. She was crying again but didn’t seem to notice nor care. She just stared out at the lake.
“he also tells me how they are on a winning streak right now. He brags about it all the time. Then I asked him about his classes and then I have to help him with his homework.” Tony said.
“I guess that her point.” Natasha replied. They walked forwards into the woods, they were walking aimlessly considering that they had no clue where to go. They stumbled upon a place where the trees grew thinner and they saw her. On a rock next to a calm lake. Her hand, the mechanical one obviously, was displaying a message, a person, talking. They looked familiar, a man. They were too far away to see who it was and too far away to hear. Even Steve couldn’t hear it. But as they got closer Steve could hear a bit the last few words of the message.
“She found the van.” Steve said. Everyone stood still and at attention. “She managed to fix it up enough for it to work and took the spare suit. She had no idea what it did and she got herself into the past. We have no clue what she did and the van is messed up and we can’t get her back.” Steve said. Hank nodded. “We need your help. We can’t lose Morgan too. Especially not Pepper, we’re not sure she could handle it.” Hank shook his head.
“About a week. They put you into a coma to make sure everything was okay, then let you come out of it on your own. Just to be sure there was no complications. You were taken off the coma about two days ago. The boys missed a football game to see if you would wake up.” She said.
“No, I’m alright. Besides, future me is probably busy.” He said. Morgan scoffed lightly and rolled her eyes. She barely held back muttering ‘very’ as she knew the rest of the Avengers had no clue about his family.
“You guys want to come over today? My apartment is cool. I got video games and movies.” Tony asked, leaning to Steve. The group nodded and murmured different acceptances. “Cool, I’ll see you guys around seven, yeah?” This was it. He was going to tell them. Oh God, he was going to tell them.
“Sorry to leave soon but I gotta go and besides I’m sure you’ll want to spend to some time as a team together.” She said with an easy smile. Natasha smile faintly and nodded to her.
“No, are just so much nicer than me and my brother’s nicknames for each other.” Tony said trying not to laugh.
“Everyone ready in case things get ugly?” Clint hissed into the comms. It was a series of quiet yes's coming in Tony's ear. He could do this. He could totally do this. It wouldn't be that hard. Just like Natasha said.
“Just tell him I went on an expedition with Clint.” Tony said looking exasperated. His father would be proud that he was doing well like his brother and Tony would be happy on land with  Steve and falling in love.
“I know those floor-plans like the back of my hand, how did I miss that?” Steve asked. Tony shrugged.
“If Morgan’s safety is in danger I think we should know. At least Pepper because she is the girl’s mother.” Steve said. Bruce closed his eyes and sighed.
“Don't know, don't care. I'm not going back, not for awhile or anything. That's sort of why I was on the water in the first place.” Tony scoffed. Steve cocked his head.
“Alternate universe interference. Pepper and Rhodey sound different to be too.” She said. It was a complete lie of course but it was the best she could come up with on the spot. “What about Hank and Janet?” She asked, turning the subject back to science in hopes of distracting anyone about to question her logic.
“We were hope, the kids in that period were signs that good can be achieved here, in this time. We rose from the ashes-” she snorted. “Literally.” She muttered. “No one that generation was more than five when it was fixed and a new generation started. Something bad happened. Something worse than New york. Beyond it.” She paused, letting it sink in. “I’m not telling you what happened. I can’t, but from the ashes of that destruction came my generation. The ones born in the heat of the moment and saw people come back who we thought were lost. But when
“That message, was recorded in case he died and he did but in wasn’t vain neither was hers.” She said. Morgan took a breath and wiped her face. She turned to the Avengers. “It hurts. Being here, seeing them,
He hesitated, but remembered that he hadn’t been doing a good enough job with his people skills and nodded. He didn’t bother to stand up, he just crawled over and sat in the same position as before. Whenever Tony was on the floor in the lab, he would always crawl to get around. That was why a lot of his lab pants had holes in the knees. He prefered to walk, but crawling seemed to take less effort. Steve was behind him on the couch, and Tony was suddenly acutely aware that he was in a house full of strangers. They could all easily overpower him, even Bruce, who seemed to be taller than Tony by only a few inches. But all was forgotten when the T.V turned on and F.R.I.E.N.D.S started to play. Tony’s face lit up in excitement, he hadn’t watch this show in forever. He had been so busy working on prototypes for Obie that he almost never got the chance to watch T.V anymore.
“There is no trace of them, not boat and no one has seen anyone that looks like Clint and no one saw Tony. It’s like they were never here.” Steve muttered.
Morgan Stark was not your average child. First of all she was genius just like her father, Tony Stark. And second of all she would pass by her father’s memorial everyday on her walk to school. She still got those ‘i'm sorry’s’ and ‘he was a hero’ which was stupid considering that half of them hated him when he was alive.(It's funny how people appreciate you when you're dead.) It’s been ten goddamn years and yet people didn’t seem to get that she understood, even then, that he wasn’t coming back. Even though the Stark family was nearing the trillions in wealth she still went to a public school, Peter’s school actually. Her mom, Pepper, thought it would be nice for Tony’s daughter to go to the same school as his ‘adoptive son’. Actually it was nice, she would get to be a regular kid. But the bus wouldn’t stop at her house so walking was pretty much her only option until she was 16. One one more year and she’d be able to drive. Luckily her mom and hers apartment wasn't far from the school. She still wished she could drive though. But today wasn’t a school day, today she would spend her day at the avengers compound, with her aunts and uncles. (Mostly uncles, her father surrounded himself with men) She found it kind of funny how she had at least three homes and her own room in each. She never spent a lot of time in the same place, that was just her life. It was like her dad's life. If she was honest with herself she missed her dad, a lot, but she would never tell anyone that. It took her mom forever to get over his death and Morgan was the thing she leaned on the most. It wasn't smart because she was five at the time and didn't realize what he had done. Morgan just remembered that her mother would cry a lot and hug Morgan telling her to keep a smile on her face. Morgan loved her mom and did her best for her.
“I love this show.” He commented with a smile still on his face. That had most of them sending puzzled looks towards him.
“Hello Morgan. It’s been awhile.” He said. She rushed up to him and gave him a gentle hug, knowing that while he was still a super soldier, he was an old and fragile super soldier. He was very close to Morgan when she was younger. She quickly pulled away and crossed her arms, remembering something.
“And the job is still on. We are going to end him on the same date as before. You two are going to pretend to know nothing about it. And the plan will go on.” Tony said.
“I-I’m sorry.” Tony said. “I should’ve listen to you. You were right, I was just too stupid to believe you. You haven’t done anything wrong to me before. I’m just so sorry.” Tony sniffed. Obadiah didn't know if it was guilt, or pity, or something, but he didn’t yell at or hit Tony.
He knew he could build faster than most people, which is why Obie always gave him things to build. But he didn’t like the way these people were talking about him. It seemed like they were trying to praise him, but their tones didn’t sound very much like praise. He shrugged and JARVIS spoke up.
“You said earlier you don’t want to go back, don't you miss your brother?” Steve asked. Tony shrugged again.
“No lasting injuries. I was careful. I didn't want to kill anyone or even hurt them. No lasting injuries. Just needed them out of the way for a little while so I could make my case.” Tony said calmly. Although, now he was starting to panic. He was outnumbered and outgunned. He needed these people to kill Obadiah. They were his only hope. To his surprise, The Captain smiled.
“Tony was in a relationship with this guy, Ty, and he didn't actually like Tony, just using him. It was an abusive relationship. You almost gave Tony a heart attack on more than one occasion. Tony finally stood up to him and left him. They got a restraining order after he wouldn't leave Tony alone. And apparently he's back.” Rhodey said. Tony shrugged.
“No.” She said. “Because I know a few things about the people here that you don’t.” A silence. “Also you’ve admitted that I am smarter than you and agreed to mentor me when I need it while Tony is gone.” That earned a small laugh from some of the group before she went with Tony to her room.
“I’m going to tell you a secret. Something I haven’t told anyone yet.” He nodded, cautious. She held up her left hand a swiped her right hand from the wrist on the back, through her fingers and to the bottom of her palm, revealing her metal hand. “You’re my hero.” She said. He looked at her hand wide eyed.
“He is fine, I think it was him who called the cops, he definitely called Rhodey and I. We're both outside your house now.” She said.
“I don’t care shut up.” Steve said and crashed their mouths together. It was rough, desperate. Steve couldn’t hold back anymore. He needed to
“I know, Steve. I love the kid too. But we have to stay in a calm head-space. For her. She’ll be back. Scott and Hank and Jan and Hope… that’s a lot of names, will fix it and we’ll get her back in no time at all.” Bucky said. He glanced at Bucky and nodded.
“No!” Steve said a bit too loud and fast. He turned a faint shade of pink. “No. It’s fine. Again it’s not like he can do anything to me. I’m his brother after all.” Tony nodded.
“You could be trapped up there, he could reject you or you could be discovered before anyone is ready and it could ruin your plan. Tony are you prepared to do this?” Bruce asked. Tony nodded.
“Now you know that isn't true. My hair is a large mess.” Tony said, lowering his head to hide his blush. Steve walked over and stood behind him and messed with his hair a bit.
“Don’t say that Uncle Steve!” Morgan whined. Steve simply laughed again. She was good at that. Making him laugh that is. She truly was Tony’s daughter.
Obadiah had a bad feeling. He didn’t know why, just that it had something to do with Tony asking to see those fireworks again. If Tony left and saw those things, he would find out he was the son of Howard and Maria Stark. Obadiah would lose his best inventor, his business would go down the drain. His fears only grew when he got an alert that the elevator had stopped at his floor. Tony was going to run. Obadiah was not going to let that happen.
“Hmm, that's nice being able to travel. Do you have a place to stay?” Steve asked. Tony stifled a laugh.
build that. That would be so simple. He had built things ten times more complex in his sleep. Tony cocked his head to the side again. He did that a lot when he was confused, Steve noted. Almost like a child or a dog trying to understand something.
“Prince Rogers.” He said but ended up stumbling over again. And yet again Prince Rogers was there to save him from falling.
“I’ll meet you guys here every night and-” Tony swam down to Clint and pressed his hand to his forehead. “I give you the power to turn human for one day only. It works when your dry and I’ll leave you some clothes under a rock. Alright?” Clint nodded.
“You guys are jerks.” Tony said. “Getting use to walking will take a little bit of time, Clint. You won’t get it right away.” Clint nodded.
“I'll be staying in an apartment for a little while though until the new houses built.” Tony explained. “But, yes, I'm all right.”
“Tony.” Bruce warned. “Are you sure this is a good idea? Remember what happened to last Merperson who got too close to a ship?”
“And even if it did,” Jan started. “We’d have to choose the exact right time to jump and if we’re even a fraction of a second off, whoever goes will not only die but rip a hole in the space time continuum. It’s too risky.” Pepper sighed. She hadn’t said a word all day. It was the tenth anniversary today. Everyone acted like it was a normal day but the energy was tense. It wasn’t good.
“Yeah, about that background check, do I have to take it?” Tony asked. The Captain knew what kind of weapons he had and most likely wouldn't kill him now. Most likely.
“Then it could rip a hole in the ozone layer from gas leakage. But when have my calculations ever been wrong?” Tony said with a cocky laugh.
“You could always come down to my lab if you’d like.” Tony said. Morgan looked up with shock and awe.
Tony let go of Steve's arm as they came to the dining room doors. He took a breath. Steve smiled and opened the door.
He swam to shore and sat behind a rock not willing to look at the beach. He took a deep breath and saw Steve standing on the beach. Was he waiting for Tony? He couldn’t be. Right?
“No I knew that it was just- She finished that in the car ride over here.” Happy said. He was starting to panic just a little bit. The group all stood up.
“Just like your father.” She said. “You know, he went college a fifteen and he made me promise when your were born that we wouldn’t let skip any grades.” Morgan plopped back down and huffed. Pepper smoothed back her daughters hair and kissed her forehead.
“Of course, Sir.” She said grabbing Tony’s arm. “Right this way.” The girl pulled him into a room and off to a side room which was a bathroom and she started to run him a bath. “I’m Natasha if you need anything just call. When you are done in there, there will be clothes waiting for you. There are towels on the hook. I will come for you when dinner is ready.” She said, turning to leave.
“W-well I don’t do it that-that often. I just-just wanted to g-get the prototypes done for today so I could ask-ask if I cou-could go to the fire-fireworks.” Tony stuttered. Steve realized that they probably made him uncomfortable. He nodded at Tony’s reply and dropped the matter. He would take it for now. Steve stood up and stretched.
“But if you’re right, don’t you think he deserves to know?” She said. “You think he’ll be calm if you don’t tell him? If he finds out you’re hiding things from him.” Steve was quiet there was a silence before she spoke again. “Aren’t you and Tony close now?” Steve nodded. “Then isn’t he your best friend in this time?” She asked.
“That's what you think.” Tony muttered, still struggling. Not very hard since his wrist and eye and neck and head all started to hurt. Natasha pulled off his glasses and pulled down his sleeve and his collar. They all gasped and let him go. Natasha simply crossed her arms.
“Excuse me, but may I inform you that as of today, sir is 18 years old, and therefore, not a minor.” JARVIS said. Pepper jumped at the small device in her hand.
’ Obadiah clenched his teeth. Tony would not find out that he was a Stark. He would keep Tony here if it was the last thing he ever did.
“That is so you Tony. Alright, alright. I’ll come by in a week. You have a week! And we can go to lunch and you can show me what is so big.” She said. Tony could tell she was smiling. Which made him smile. She was finally relaxing. She probably hadn’t relaxed in a few years. It made him feel good that she was going to be safe soon. She kept him grounded and alive for all those years, there was no way he was going to let her die. He was doing this for her. For them. “Well alright that’s a-”
“Ow…” He muttered. His towel was just out of arm's reach and Tony ended up awkwardly flopping a few feet to the towel so he could dry himself off and be human again. It’d be nice to not have worry about someone walking in on him. It took awhile, since his hair was wet and he was inside, but he was able to dry off and he had legs again. Wrapping the towel around himself, he walked out into the large bedroom, on the bed, thing, there was a pair of clothes, just as Natasha said. They were fancy and nothing like the clothes he was wearing when climb aboard. They weren’t comfortable, quite the opposite really, but different. He could get use to this. In time of course. He couldn’t wait to tell Bruce what happened. There was a knock on the door. Tony was busy trying to tame his mess of hair. Underwater, hair was always floating and Tony’s hair was a large mess of knots and waves on land. “Come in.” He said distractedly. Steve came into the room.
“Good, just wait he’ll be there.” She said before hanging up. She turned to him and nodded and the two left towards the living room. The group gave them a questioning look. Tony shrugged and sat down on the couch with Natasha and Steve. Morgan barely held back an eye roll. Of course Tony would sit there.
“Aha!” He said pointing at Bucky. “I told you that was the best team! Thank you Tony.” Steve said, leaning back in his seat.
“I don’t believe you are in any position to be asking that Steven.” Tony said, as he stopped untying the cables.
“would tomorrow work for you? Because I have this huge math test and if I fail, I can't play and these idiots will lose without me.” Steve said. Tony nodded.
“You have to meet everyone. They are really excited to meet you.” Bruce said, as he literally dragged Tony to where the table was. “Everyone meet Tony! Tony this is everyone.”
“Here’s my price. We could use a guy like you on our team, join our time and we’ll kill him.” The Captain said. Tony was baffled. It showed.
“It would be a shame to get your little ‘friends’ involved in this though, wouldn’t it? I’d hate to have to… hurt one of them.” Obadiah said. Tony struggled harder.
“We did.” He agreed. They looked over to her parents, Hank and Jan were in the middle of a whispering match. Not angry at each other but angry in general. They looked at each other then walked over.
“Sir, I would suggest leaving this situation. If your heart rate continues to climb, you will require medication.” JARVIS said in a calm voice that filled Tony’s head. He nodded. Without a word, Tony silently ran out of the room and downstairs into the gallery. What was he thinking? He couldn’t do this. Leave and expect things work out find. People were mean. People were evil. People killed his parents. He should’ve stayed home, he couldn't do this. He needed to get home, but he couldn’t do that without Steve and getting to Steve meant go back to where the yelling was, and he couldn’t do that either.
“Tony.” He said. He swear he saw Natasha smile. He almost never let anyone call him Tony anymore, not since the crash. It reminded him of his parents.
“They should.” She replied. “They might listen to you then.” Morgan nodded and decided to leave FRIDAY alone for now. She knelt down to the robots level.
“So? How about? Stay with me until you can get back on your feet?” Steve asked. Tony glanced back down at the water.
“None that we know of, sir.” He replied out loud. Tony jumped forgetting it was on speaker. He pressed a button to turn it off.
“About 7 hours, sir.” JARVIS replied. Everyone was shocked when the aforementioned ‘JARVIS’ replied out loud. No one knew that JARVIS could be used on speaker. It stunned them all into silence. Tony rolled his eyes, seemingly annoyed at the A.I.
“Ooh!” She exclaimed. “Gimme!” She made grabbing hands at the laptop. Bruce smiled softly at her and handed her his computer. She started to type again.
“Well, I guess I am. I didn’t mean to, really. I was just trying to find out what the van did.” She said.
happiness, or her life and happiness. It wasn’t a tough choice to make. Besides, she was already in too deep, now. Tony was about to say something when her phone rang. She held up a finger and answered the phone.
“Are you alright?” She asked after he didn’t say anything else. He pulled his knees up to his chest and shook his head.
“Good news is that they found the killer. You are now officially safe from them. They are in police custody and under high surveillance. They can’t get you. You can now quit high school and come back home with Rhodey and me. If you want. You are completely safe now. Okay?” She said. Tony beamed.
“Must have missed that.” He said. Together they walked outside and into her car where Pepper collapsed into her steering wheel.
“I’m not sure, he’s obviously been through something, but I’m not sure what. His parents were killed, like he said before, and for the entire walk over, he jumped whenever a car honked. He always walked behind me, and never next to me. He doesn’t hate people… he just…” Steve trailed off not really knowing what to say.
“Alright, background check time, take off the mask and give us your full name and Widow you do a background check.” The Captain said walking over to where Tony stood. The Captain was dead in front of him. Widow pulled out a phone like device which Tony was sure wasn't and phone and nodded to Tony. He let out a breath and shrugged. He took off the mask.
“That explains why he wants to see the fireworks so much.” Sam said. The group nodded. The mystery that was Tony just became bigger.
“What?!” Tony exclaimed. “In the middle of nowhere? What the hell is she doing there?” No one replied for a minute.
“You’ll just have to trust me because I don’t know how to explain it.” She said. Steve walked back in with a desert. Morgan didn’t even realize he had left. He set the plate down in front of her. She looked up at him.
“If that happens, Morgan, you may never be born. You could just die.” Bruce said. “You can’t do that, that’s the consequence you can’t handle.” He said.
“So what exactly happened on Friday?” Steve asked as Tony sat down at their lunch table. Tony side of the small smile didn't want to lie to them, but if, on the off-chance they knew who was trying to kill Tony, he couldn't risk it. Pepper had a gun over the cover story was. Pepper and his parents both decided that it would be better for Tony to stay and throw the killer off maybe he'd think Tony was moved somewhere and not come back and try again.
“It was a myth. Antman, in the war. A man as small as an ant and helped the war. Now in the beginnings of SHIELD they tried to not only steal it but replicate it. Hank Pym got mad and tried his hardest to keep it out of SHIELD’s hands. It’s under such high security and so many puzzles with a few different locations that need to be… broken into.” She said.
“There was an explosion -...a-a fire.” She said. Tony covered his mouth in horror, he knew it showed on his face. There was really only one thing on his mind.
“you're 16 without a car and you most definitely do not have a license so I will be driving you where you need to go but you are walking home. I still have college.” She said with a smirk.
“Get into contact with them. They’re probably the only ones that know how to make it work for real. Otherwise I’m stuck here.” She said. They nodded, before Clint grabbed the phone again.
“I’m glad you came to your senses boy.” He said as he stood in front of Tony. He slapped him dead across the face. “Just don’t interrupt me next time. I like to finish my insults.”  Tony managed a nod. That slap reminded him of how many slaps Obadiah had saved him from when his father was still alive. There was silence for a second. Tony didn't really want to get slapped again.
“I do not want a scratch on her when she gets back here!” Steve called from off screen. Although they couldn’t see him they knew that voice and he meant business.
“What I want is for this paper work to make sense! To have this deal be good, not stupid and full of crap.” She muttered. Tony thought for a moment, before walking towards her and taking out JARVIS and handing it to her.
“You guys met Stark at least once each, and even if you didn’t what he did ten years ago is proof enough that she’s bound to do something stupid. She’s Stark’s daughter in mind and body, if we don’t get her back soon, things will happen, probably irreversible things.” Bucky said. Steve hadn’t even thought about that. He was too busy trying to get her back, not realizing that she might be messing with the past. Steve took out his phone.
“Seriously, that kid means the world to all of us.” Rhodey said. “If anything happens to her and we mean anything, as soon as this thing works we are coming over there and kicking your asses. And we can because we’re you but stronger.” Morgan plucked the phone out of Tony’s hands.
“Whoa!” Said a voice and he felt a hand on his wrist. All of the sudden he was being pulled over the edge and onto the ship. “I got you.” He said. Tony immediately blushed. “How did you fall over?” It was the man from before. The hot one.
“Yes, but could I have some water?” He asked. She nodded and got him a glass of water. He sat up with her support and drank the water.
“Tony, when was the last time you slept?” Steve asked shifting his position to face Tony. Tony tilted his head then shrugged.
“Yes, I remember. What do want this time?” Obie said, almost fondly. It made Tony smiled. Obie cared, which is why he kept Tony here, to keep him protected from the people who killed his parents. “New laptop, a new TV, a gaming system?” Obie asked. Tony shook his head.
“I just wan-wanted to- to say that I-” He never got the chance to finish. The door burst open and Clint was standing there. Talk about worst timing ever. He couldn’t have waited a few minutes longer. It couldn’t be that important.
done a lot of stuff for us. She saved Tony’s life. We have to thank her.” Everyone knew that he just wanted to see her one last time. Everyone did. They’d grown attached to her, which was dangerous in their line of work but, hey, they were affectionate people. They simply nodded and everyone went off to their rooms to get ready.
“Im sorry Buck, it’s just… it’s Morgan!” Steve exclaimed. “I was right there. I could’ve stopped her.” He said.
“I know, and I am so happy that you care about me but I want this.” She said. “And besides if this happens you won’t even remember me.” She said hoping for a hint of humor. It didn’t work though.
“I’m not even going to ask why and how you all knew how to do that.” Tony said holding the phone to his ear.
“No.” Tony said. “Let it be a surprise.” Tony and Natasha ended up talking about school of all things and what he missed. Teachers were worried and even a few of the younger students who looked up to Tony because of his smarts were concerned. After about ten minutes they both heard the voices of the boys coming back from wherever they had gone to eat. The door open and all of them stopped and stared in shock at the two.
“Captain Rogers, Sergeant Barnes.” He greeted. Even though he wasn’t Captain America anymore, everyone still called him Captain. “What do you need?” Steve looked down. Clearly not wanting to speak Bucky did for him.
looking a bit angry, and Tony tried to hide behind Steve again, but Natasha stood on his other side and kept him in place. Tony bit his lip.
“Not important. I’m sorry I took it in the first place. I probably should have just asked you.” Tony said. Steve put the bag down and smiled at Tony. He looked like he was about to say something, when a loud boom rang out. A flash of colorful light lit up the park. People cheered. Tony was proud to say that he didn’t even jump when the first one went off.
“Calm down Tony, I don’t think you going to the hospital will put him in a better mood.” She had sitting up and placing a hand on his shoulder.
"Not important." She said, running a hand through her hair. "It’s hard for me to believe that I am in 2013.” Tony and Bruce looked at each other then at her. Tony raised an eyebrow.
It didn't take long for the group to find out, not they were trying to keep it a secret but it was surprising how fast they found out. Luckily, they were all cool with it.
He was staring straight at Tony. Tony felt his blood run cold with fear, and Obie started walking towards him. Tony couldn’t remember how to move. Obie marched right up to him and stood there with a disappointed look on. Somehow, that scared Tony more than his angry face.
The van shook violently and ultimately fell apart. So she didn’t fix it fully and took a few shortcuts. Sue her.
“Then you’ll do a DNA test and prove it to them. They’re gonna love you, Tony.” Steve said. Tony gave him a smile and nodded, but he chewed on his nails while they waited.
“Like yours.” She replied with a bright smile. “Now I have a few friends with me and they just want to help you too. One or two you may recognize from your past. If you don’t want to meet them, that’s okay but I can’t help you without them.” He hesitated as she cloaked her hand again.
Thank you so much for joining me on my first complete serious work. I love you all so much and thank you for the support that you've given me.
for you guys, I just figured that if you went through enough trouble to-to buy a coffee machine, that you guys like coffee. I just kinda assumed, if you guys don’t like it, I-I’ll drink it. I mean It’s-It’s kind of a lot, but I would want to waste it. That wouldn’t be right. I would’ve made one for… Pepper too, but I had no idea she was coming… or that she existed” Tony was babbling. He knew he was babbling, and he
“Come on, I’ll introduce you to everybody. No yelling this time, okay?” Steve said. Tony hesitated; the people upstairs seemed mean, and scary to him.
“Thank you.” He said lying back down. “Damn, I forgot how painfully those things are.”  He said with a small chuckle.
“Damn it.” She muttered. She grabbed her backpack and plate from waffles and rushed to elevator. “Bye guys!” She called to the bots. And rushed back upstairs. She didn't realise how hungry she was until she was in the elevator. She poked her head out and it was dark no one home she guessed and breathed a sigh of relief. She walked into the conjoined kitchen when the lights turned on.
“Well,” Clint said, throwing his arm over Tony shoulder. “Now you have friends! Which gives you a social life by default.” Tony smiled. It would be nice to have more than two friends, that weren't after his money. Even if it was only for a little while.
“Well, I lied to you guys this whole time. I was planning on telling  you guys that night but obviously that didn’t work out.” He said. She snorted.
Obadiah all but ran into his building, and frantically pressed the button for his floor. Tony couldn’t have escaped, he just couldn’t have. He would need at least one other person to lead him around; there was just no way. When the doors opened and the room was empty, Obadiah felt himself start to panic. Then, he saw the chair and cables, and his panic turned into rage. Tony was gone, and someone was with him. He punched the wall of the elevator in his fury, hard enough that he felt something moved beneath his fist. A panel of the wall shifted to the side, Obadiah looked over in confusion and moved the panel aside to find a leather bag. He looked inside to find the tower’s plans, a camera and a sketchbook. He opened the book, and on the inside cover it read ‘
She stepped out of the elevator and into an old dusty room. She blinked and coughed a few times, swiping the air in front of her, trying to get the dust away from her. The door in front of her was older technology, she frowned at it and tried the keypad. It lit up but she had a coating of dust on her finger after. She rolled her eyes and tried a password. It blinked red and she frowned again. Thinking for a minute she quickly entered another passcode and smiled when the door opened. She smirked at the simple password, it was her mother’s birthday. The door slid open with a horrifying squeak and an unholy amount of dust. She coughed before walking into what seemed like a lab. It had to be her fathers. The bright lights flickered on and she couldn’t help but want to build anything and everything. She noticed there were some robots in the corner and she cocked her head to the side.
“I can track her cell phone, she did not tell me to keep it a secret that she left. I do not believe she is hiding.” He said.
“Because,” She said. “My Avengers went the past before.” Everyone’s, save Natasha who looked shocked which she counted as a win, jaw dropped.
Tony was most definitely not okay. He trusted these people with his life, sure. He had gotta very close to them, all of them. He even had the privilege to call Natasha; Nat. Not even Bucky could do that. It was nice to be part of a makeshift family. He enjoyed it. But this was something else. As he was suiting up in the tight leather outfit he was given. It was a little tighter than necessary but that was because it was the only one they could get on such short notice. He had his gauntlets on, it was only a button press away, but he was freaking out. How on earth was he supposed to do this.
“Tony, what's wrong?” Steve asked. Tony reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet. He placed a 50 on the table.
“Yeah, I get cold really easily.” She said. Clint shrugged and went off to finish some more decorating.
“I’m sorry, sir, but Mister Stane won’t be back for three days. He didn’t have any interviews scheduled for this week.” She said. Steve frowned himself, of course there was no interview. This was just an act to keep her distracted for a little while.
“His A.I system.” Steve explained. “You aren’t good with loud noises, are you?” Steve asked, bending down to eye level with Tony, who was still sitting. Tony shook his head.
“Yeah, he was uh, partly bought online and the rest I did myself.” Tony said. Bruce and Tony spent the rest of lunch with Bruce, discussing DUM-E.
“It’s Tony! It’s his parents! It Howard and it’s my best friend! You think he’s going to be calm about it? You think he’s going to believe me?” He asked. Morgan shrugged again.
“Well, yes, but that’s not why I know that. I was there, he had taught me my first swear word that day.” She said. A few of them stifled a laugh. Morgan stood up. “I’m sorry for startling you guys, but I really need to get home. My mom is going to kill me.” Tony smiled faintly at that.
“I don’t think you can. You’re father was looking for you today. If your gone another day, he’ll send out a search party. That won’t do anyone any good.” Bruce said.
“No! Obie takes care of me. My parents were killed and no one would take me. He did though.” Tony said, almost defensively. No one said anything. He had no clue what to do now. He frowned.
Speaking of Pepper she would be worried if Morgan wasn’t in her room. She waved goodbye to the robots promising she would be back and hopped into the elevator and back to her room. She quickly unpacked and flopped down on her bed. She understood why her mom would hide her dad’s lab. She had plenty of good reasons to hide it from her, but Morgan all wanted to do was go back down there and fix the van. There was a knock on her door and before her mom walked in.
