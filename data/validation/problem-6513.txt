Darcy sticks out her tongue at him, and Tony giggles and snuggles between them. And Darcy puts her bear in his lap to hold again, and Steve very carefully smooths one of Tony’s curls with his finger, and Tony feels like he could burst with happiness.
Clint looks at the plane and the home building for a long time. ‘I like them,’ he decides, and Tony beams at him. Clint looks back with a serious face, but after a long moment he offers a careful little smile. ‘Who lives there?’ he asks in a quiet voice.
Steve wriggles his fingertip gently inside Tony’s mouth, brushing against Tony’s lips, and Tony shivers all over. Steve is watching his face intently, and Tony’s face is going hot, hot, hot, like he has a fire burning inside of him. He breathes in quickly, and then Steve’s leaning down to press their foreheads together.
She stares down at the surface of the bench, trying to bring it back into focus, hands gripping too tightly to the edge. Her eyes are blurry and sore, and there's a dull thudding in her ears and a big stinging lump in her throat that she can't swallow down.
in her eyes? No, that’s too strange, no tears. But she turns her face into Steve’s hair, hiding, breathing in the faint clean smell of it.
. Room 17, that’s what the papers said. Room 17, he has to find Room 17, and his teacher’s name is Ms Potts. He sort of likes that. It’s like the teapot in Beauty and the Beast, and Tony imagines Ms Potts as being round and comfortable and kind.
Steve says ‘Knife,’ and offers it for Tony to look at. It’s a good flint, like the ones used by Tony’s tribe, but Tony thinks he could make a better handle grip. He would bind it around with leather straps, so that it would be more comfortable for Steve to use. He really, really wants to do nice things for Steve.
But Steve doesn’t seem to mind, she just holds her closer and whispers, ‘Tony, Tony,’ into her hair, and kisses Tony’s temple and strokes her back soothingly. And everything’s bright and spinning and beautiful, and Tony lets herself believe, just this once, that it’s going to be okay.
Tony untenses, because it sounds like Steve’s going to be okay. She gentles her hold on Steve’s bruised shoulder, though, reaching to find Steve’s right hand and pull it gently forwards so she can see. The knuckles are broken all the way across, but considering the smash in the wall, that’s not a surprise. Tony cradles it tenderly; Steve’s hand is larger than hers, beautifully shaped with a square capable palm and long fingers, and it feels surprisingly soft. Next to it, Tony’s own looks small and wiry and brown, nail-bitten and slightly chapped.
‘I like flowers,’ he confides. ‘Did you know that Steve likes flowers too? Does Darcy like flowers? Does Darcy pick flowers for you?’
But Thor seems to know what he means. 'I will see you around – little curly,' he says, grinning and ruffling Tony’s hair with a gentle hand. Tony
Later, they nestle together – much later, after Tony, still shaking and letting out little panting sobs, has crawled desperately down to put her mouth on Steve; and after Steve has gasped and bucked helplessly for a few moments, and then drawn Tony gently up to kiss her, warm and shaky and sweet, before she’s hardly started.
I’m slightly unsure about this last sex scene, being a little out of my lane – which is why it’s kind of vague. I hope it’s okay! (If anyone wants to write an explicit version, go right ahead.)
Steve tells Mr Karolidis that Tony liked the cupcake, and Mr Karolidis slaps his hands on the counter delightedly. ‘Good,’ he says, ‘that’s good, Steven!’
, Tony thinks) and brings both of his hands to rest warmly on Tony’s back, holding him steady as he gently explores Steve’s chest with his fingers.
against her fingertips, and she’s coming. Coming and coming, shaking all over and making sounds against Steve’s mouth and cheek, sobbing with the overwhelming high of it. Steve holds her through it, kissing her and whispering against her cheek when Tony can’t kiss anymore, telling her she’s perfect, she’s beautiful, she’s so, so good for her, her sweet little baby bird.
‘Tony sandwich,’ she says, pressing closer. ‘See! Steve n’me are bread, an’ you’re licky licky peanut butter!’
Steve snaps his teeth at her. ‘Am not, am NOT, I HATE YOU,’ he says angrily, but Darcy’s already going on.
Oh, and Rhodey! And Pepper! Both coming! And both of them have promised not to bring any work along to the party! Tony’s going to tease Pep
He’s weak and shaky, though, and the bowl tilts and nearly spills before Steve steadies it with a hand. Tony huffs in frustration and struggles into a more upright position, trying to bring the bowl to his mouth at the same time, because he’s hungry, so, so hungry, and the stew smells so good it’s making his head spin.
‘Tony,’ Tony whispers after a moment, pointing his own thumb at his chest. Steve smiles at him and strokes his thumb gently over the back of Tony’s fingers, as though Tony’s hand is something delicate and breakable.
Steve kisses Tony’s forehead, threads her hand under Tony’s shirt to stroke the hot skin there. ‘Of course, darling girl,’ she whispers. ‘Red, green, yellow signals, okay?’ and Tony seems to melt against her in relief, nodding. ‘I love you,’ Steve adds, because she does, so much, and Tony
Ms Potts tells them to get out their Drawing books. Tony stares down at the page until it goes blurry, and then there’s a little splash and a wet blotch right on top of a picture he’d started of his Dad. Then there’s another, and another, and he can’t stop them because he’s never going to sit next to Steve again, now Steve’s got Jane next to him and Jane’s really, really pretty, Steve won’t ever want Tony back there because he’ll have Jane there and Jane won’t take his pencils without asking.
He whimpers softly, curling into a little ball. But the next moment, Steve comes into view, dragging his deer carcase by the back legs, powerful muscles straining and bulging. He lets the legs fall to the ground and comes over to drop down by Tony’s side, brow wrinkled in concern. ‘Shhh,’ he says soothingly, and Tony reaches out to take Steve’s hand in relief, pulling it up to press against his face, closing his eyes.
(And the new fic will have Peggy actually, physically punching Howard for being a neglectful jerk. Just so you all know.)
Steve kisses her cheek softly, smiling. ‘You really are a sweetheart, aren’t you?’ she murmurs. She flicks the shower head with her thumb, and Tony lets out a sharp whimper and bucks her hips, because the spray has gone light and tickly again, and Steve’s other hand is coming round again to gently part Tony’s folds so that the spray can tickle her in all the most secret soft delicate places.
‘This is my Mamá,’ Darcy tells everyone proudly. She’s standing at the front of the class for Show and Tell, and she’s actually got her Mamá right there to show everyone! In her police uniform! It’s so cool, and Tony’s sitting next to Steve at his desk, looking at her in awe.
, a gold pencil! He rolls it a bit closer with his fingers, and Steve hasn’t come back yet, so he picks it up, looks at the end bit where the goldy lead sticks out of the wood. It can’t really be metal, so how come it looks like metal when Steve draws with it?
But. But, Steve still doesn't seem to mind, and Tony notices that Steve's brought one of Tony's tablets and left it angled on the table, just in easy reaching distance – and it's so very soft and warm under the dark blue sheets, and they still smell faintly, comfortingly, like Steve. And hey, Tony's only human. She snuggles gladly back down with a sigh, reaching for the tablet. 'Mm.'
She sucks gently on Tony’s lip, squeezing and caressing her breasts, her sides, her body. Tony kisses back unsteadily, and then Steve slips an arm around her and draws her close against her body, holding her there on the counter with Tony’s curly head tucked under her chin. ‘Arms round my neck, baby,’ she murmurs. Tony obeys, a little clumsy, and Steve smiles against her forehead. ‘That’s my good girl, keep them like that for me.’
‘Ah,’ says Mr Karolidis, but he doesn’t seem to be talking about the milk. He’s still leaning against the countertop, and his face looks very kind all of a sudden, when Steve sneaks an anxious little glance. He doesn’t say anything for a moment after that, but then he flicks the tea towel off his shoulder and folds it with a flourish. ‘Well, cupcakes! Let’s see then,’ and he goes to the pantry to find some ingredients.
And that night, Mom sits on Tony’s bed and smiles at him gently and reads him a story called ‘Scuppers, the Sailor Dog’, which is a really, really great story about a dog who builds and invents and fixes things. And Tony reaches out, and shyly, slowly curls his fingers around her smooth ones; and Mom looks surprised for a moment but then presses his hand gently and holds it, and it’s
, and the voice is just a thread, she can ignore it, and she finds her eyes drifting closed as she rests her head in her hands, propped on the table.
‘Love you,’ she whispers. Her voice is tiny and small against Steve’s skin, but she knows Steve is listening, Steve will hear her. Steve will always listen for her, no matter how small her voice is, or even if she can’t make herself speak at all. Her fingers are still curled around Steve’s smooth warm breast, and she strokes her nipple again. It’s hard, so hard, and Steve makes a shuddery breathy, sound, her whole body shifting as though she can’t help herself.
Mr Karolidis nods, eyes bright. ‘Very nice girl! Lauren, that’s her name. They’re gonna get married, two years, three? I said to Natalia, I’ll walk you down the aisle. Her good-for-nothing father, he won’t do it, but I’m her pappouli. I’ll walk my granddaughter down the aisle. Me and the cats.’
Tony’s head snaps up and she tries ineffectually to wipe the grease off her face, blurting, ‘holy shit, Steve,’ and then, ‘God, I’m a mess, sorry about this, just, I get covered in, covered in this stuff.’
‘It’s okay, I gotta friend who can push us!’ Darcy urges, dragging Tony by the hand. ‘He’s big. C’mon, c’mon, we gotta get there first!’
Then Tasha goes back to her chair by climbing under the desk, and Tony hears Clint say really quietly, ‘Tash, hug for me too?’ and so Tasha gives
, Steve, I’ve got you, it’s okay, I’ve got you,’ she whispers, a long garbled stream of stupid words, and she
There's a full sort of silence; and then Tony feels a knuckle touch her cheek, very gently. 'Are you sure?' Steve says quietly; and then, as Tony blinks at her, uncomprehending, she smiles down at Tony a little lopsidedly, straightening and standing up. 'Do you want to stay in bed a bit longer?'
stupid Pepper Potts, and there’s a dazed look on his face, and he’s forgotten his lunch. It’s lying in his lap, unopened.
‘Yes,’ Ms Potts says firmly. ‘I’m moving Tony to the other side of the room.’ Her eyes run over the kids on the other side, and she gives a little nod. ‘Jane, please can you pack up your things and switch desks with Tony?’
Steve chuckles, letting her touch for a moment before moving further down Tony’s body. ‘Here it comes, sweet thing,’ she says, and then her fingers are right there again, probing and touching.
. I met her.’ He peeks back across the room to where Darcy’s showing her Mamá the things on her desk. ‘Steve,’ he says softly. ‘Steve, can you – can you please come too?’ He looks pleadingly at Steve, clasping his fingers together.
Tony’s hand moves restlessly across the swell of Steve’s breast, skating over the nipple through the T-shirt, her fingers ending up tangled in the soft fabric. Steve rubs her back reassuringly, her hand slipping down to pat Tony’s round, lacy little bottom. This part is always hard.
But then Steve’s hand is sliding back over Tony’s curls until it’s cupping the back of Tony’s neck. Tony goes very still. Steve’s injured hand turns over in Tony’s, Steve’s fingers coaxing at Tony’s own until they’re twined gently together. Tony is – she’s trembling, why, why is she trembling.
Rhodey looks at them both for a long moment, his eyes softening a very little. Then he shakes his head, grinning. ‘Can you just – stop. My God. You’re so sickeningly sweet and adorable that you’re making my teeth ache,’ he tells Tony, and thumps Steve’s arm. ‘Come on, tall and small. Presents.’
Her back aches, her shoulders ache, in fact, her whole body aches, and there’s those stupid sharp muscle cramps that feel like long bodkins poking up through the core of her body. And to make things even better, she’s
,’ and she can’t stop grinning up at Steve, but that’s okay because Steve’s smiling too, with her eyes all crinkled fondly at the edges in that way that makes Tony’s stomach flip and lurch happily.
There’s an outburst of laughter when they finally get to the main area, hand in hand. Clint whoops, tucked happily under Bucky’s arm, and flicks three pieces of popcorn in quick succession to bounce with devastating accuracy off the tip of Tony’s nose. ‘Quit that, you maniac,’ she calls at him, and he sticks his tongue out at her like the twelve-year-old he is.
Then Steve’s hands come up slowly to rest on her bared shoulders, and she says in that quiet, quiet voice, ‘Is this okay?’ And Tony nods, jerkily; and Steve strokes her, palms caressing in gentle circles over the curves of her shoulders, thumbs tracing the edge of her top. Tony’s breath goes uneven, shaky, at the feel of it, at the way Steve’s eyes catch and hold her own.
‘No one says that these day-ay-ay,’ Clint’s voice breaks up into another yawn. ‘Grandpa Barnacle. How’ya gonna make me?’
He glances shyly at Steve through his eyelashes. Steve’s looking at him, too, steady and curious. His eyes are blue, like the sky, and he doesn’t look shy at all. ‘I’m Steve,’ he says. ‘You should sit here.’ Then he goes back to carefully organising his pencils. He has lots of colours.
Steve’s collarbones to her face, Steve smiles a bit. Tony thinks she probably gets stars in her eyes every time Steve smiles at her, and this time – well. Steve’s eyes are blue, blue like, well, the sky – and her eyelashes are still a bit damp, clinging together in the sweetest little spikes, and her mouth is soft and so terribly kissable. Tony takes a deep breath and nibbles her lip. ‘I’m – yeah,’ she stumbles, and God, why? Why can’t she just be smooth and charming with Steve – hell, even just
Steve likes to tease Tony with the tickly shower spray between her legs. It feels so good and so unbearable at the same time, and it makes Tony pant helplessly and wriggle in Steve’s lap, not sure if she wants to get closer or further away. Steve pins her hands safely back so she can’t be naughty and touch, and oh, it’s so safe and so overwhelming that Tony cries a little bit, but in a good way, into Steve’s warm soft neck.
I see,’ and hey, maybe Tony doesn’t have to spell it out after all, so she just sits there for a moment with her eyes squeezed shut, because she’s tired and embarrassed and yeah,
Clint makes the microwave explode because he didn’t notice the tinsel inside. His eyebrows get singed and when Tony can’t stop laughing he swears and rants and threatens to get into the workshop and smash those damn stupid bots.
, making flower crowns, and soon Tony is giggling and trying to wind the little flower stems together like she shows them, and he can’t remember why he was so scared before.
After Maggie goes, Tony doesn’t feel much like talking, so he goes and curls up on a cushion in the reading corner with a really cool book called Bill the Inventor. After a few minutes, Steve marches across with a handful of pencils and his Drawing book, and says, ‘Move over,’ and then wedges himself against Tony, comfortingly close.
This is – this is different. Tony’s eyes widen, laughter falling away, because Steve’s fingertip is between his lips, and Steve’s thumb runs along Tony’s jaw, stroking, and Steve is looking down at him with his soft eyes. ‘Little Tony pup,’ he murmurs.
‘Tony. Tony, love, I can walk,’ Steve says, sounding a bit more like herself, and Tony freezes for a split second, because –
Steve scowls, making a cranky sound. ‘Huh,’ he says grumpily, and hunches over his Numbers book, writing in the wrong answers very fast and pressing very hard and black with his pencil.
She slips a little out of it for a moment to check in. ‘What colour, sweetheart?’ she asks, soft-voiced, and Tony nestles her cheek trustingly against Steve’s collarbone.
Steve brightens. ‘It was Tony’s idea,’ he tells her, proudly. ‘He’s real good at making stuff. An’ Numbers. An’ everything.’
. Tony holds on to her fiercely, as though she can make everything right if she's only strong enough, if she only holds on firmly enough.
’ Tony says suddenly and fiercely, putting his head up and glaring at Steve. It’s so unexpected that Steve’s mouth opens but no sound comes out, and he stares at Tony in surprise. Tony’s face is bright pink and sort of angry, and his eyes are dark black and snapping, and this thing happens to Steve sometimes when Tony looks right at him – this thing where his heart starts thumping hard and fast and his ears go hot and he can’t seem to talk properly. It’s a bit like an asthma attack, but inside his – stomach, or something.
well, but he likes him okay. Clint’s Tasha’s friend, and he’s pretty quiet mostly. He doesn’t always hear stuff. Once he got scared and started crying quietly and hid in a cupboard, and Ms Potts had to call Clint’s Daddy to come and fetch him. Clint’s Daddy dressed a bit like Dad, neat and buttoned into a shirt, but his face was different, tired and gentle.
First it was a pit with sticks and earth hiding its mouth, so that a wary boar might walk across it and be plunged into the trap. Small Tony’s picture had been crudely drawn, but he got better at it, drawing ideas for traps and better tools to help the tribe. His pictures had
believe it, but she’s tipping her face up towards Steve, wonderful perfect Steve, and Steve’s bending down towards her lips.
Tony’s very busy, then, because he finally has something to do, and at last he’s not feeling drowsy all the time. He crawls over to the pile in the corner, where Steve throws the scraps of his skins and bits of wood, and starts sorting through them, humming happily. He needs just the right kind.
Tony weakly rolls her hips, at that, but it turns out that Steve’s idea of getting sorted out is different. She pats them both dry with a towel, holding Tony upright in the crook of her arm, because Tony has wobbly baby deer legs and keeps trying to get Steve’s leg between her thighs and rub. ‘No,’ Steve tells her, laughing a little. ‘Stop that, sweet thing. Let me look after you, okay? I’ve got you.’
Tony drags herself out of the shower at last. When she investigates the pile of things Steve’s left, she finds that it’s Steve’s own clothes, freshly laundered and smelling clean and soapy: soft worn jeans and a blue shirt that swamps Tony’s smaller frame. There’s a little convenience bag, too, all discreet and new and packaged up and with everything she needs in it, and Tony feels her throat nonsensically closing up hot and tight, like she might cry again, because, just, how is Steve even a real person?
Steve takes her to the bathroom and sets the pile down on the vanity, letting go of Tony with a warm caressing slide of her palm on Tony's shoulder, just
'Yes,' Tony says, 'yes, please, Ms Potts, can I go back to my old desk?' He looks pleadingly up at her.
The shower-bath is large and luxurious. Steve sets Tony down on the broad counter, smiling down at her as she turns to turn on the water. Then she reaches out and skims her hands down Tony’s sides. ‘Arms up for me, sweetheart,’ she murmurs, and when Tony obediently does as she’s told, she’s rewarded by a kiss on the nose. ‘That’s my good girl,’ Steve says warmly.
God, I love these two darlings so much. Next chapter: Tony cleans Steve up and wants very much to lick her. ;)
'Thank you,' Tony says stiffly after a moment, or as stiffly as is possible whilst curled up under a warm burrow of bedclothes. It comes out more like a croak. Steve reaches for the coffee in its bright red mug, holds it invitingly, nearly in reach, the scent of it tantalising Tony's nose, and damn, she needs to sit up if she wants coffee.
Tony’s almost floating. Her words aren’t working properly, but she keeps looking at Steve and every time Steve catches her eye her face goes all soft and tender and she squeezes Tony’s hand, encased gently in her own, leading Tony along. It’s so lovely Tony doesn’t know what to do, and she feels like she should be saying something, but for once she can’t get anything out so she just settles on
The classroom environment I’ve written here is heavily influenced by my own experience going to primary school in Australia – and also my experiences with the kids at the school where I now work. Write what you know, yeah. :) I’ve tried to keep the terminology neutral so it doesn’t jar with anyone, but if there’s anything that glaringly stands out to you, please let me know!
Mother had said, and she had shown him how to mix red earth with a little water, to draw patterns and pictures on his skin and the wall of the great cave. It helped him to forget about the hunger for a little while.
‘It’s a CatBearPuppy,’ Tony whispers, awed; and the CatBearPuppy smiles back at him in a friendly sort of way.
‘Hey,’ Steve says. ‘Hey. Shh, it’s okay, let me just…’ She cups Tony’s face with her hand for a moment, thumb brushing gently at her cheek, and Tony realises that she’s still crying, and Steve’s just wiped away a tear. Steve’s got that little worried crinkle in between her brows, eyes soft and searching Tony’s face, and Tony can just
Steve puts the other engine-toilet-roll in place. ‘On my birthday mom made cake n’left a birthday letter with pictures,’ he says, frowning in concentration as he positions it just right. ‘She couldn’t be there until late cause she hasta work heaps. But it ain’t her fault!’ he adds fiercely, glaring briefly up at them. ‘She just hasta.’
Tony’s little pink tongue pokes out and laps it away. She looks delicious, Steve thinks; eyes blown wide and black with need, lips soft and pink and trembling. She leans forward and catches Tony’s lips with hers, swallowing up the little breath of surprise that she makes, sinking her teeth into Tony’s bottom lip in a way that makes Tony’s knees buckle.
Tony traces her fingers languidly down Steve’s face, Steve’s neck, feeling soft and satisfied, the delicious tired tingling of her afterglow between her legs. ‘Mm, they’ll wait,’ she murmurs, and finds Steve’s hand and squeezes it gently.
‘Hey. Tony.’ It’s Steve, but Tony doesn’t – he doesn’t care! He’s going to stay with his head on the desk
But then – then Clint whispers, ‘Yeah,’ and warily edges his finger across the table to hook into Tony’s.
Darcy’s waiting for him, just inside the classroom door. ‘Tony Tony!’ she says, beaming. ‘Did your Mom tell you? Did she? Are you gonna? Please please please please, we gonna have cupcakies an’ picnic and pass parcels and hide’n’seek!’
, what kind of – of horrible insensitive person is Tony to be even thinking about anything like that?
'Captain Rogers appears to have been suffering from a lucid nightmare whilst sleepwalking. She injured her head and her hand before I was able to wake her, and is in considerable emotional distress.'
When it’s dry, he brings back the little mortar of medicine, letting Tony see each movement as he daubs it over the angry swollen cuts. Tony braces himself, waiting for pain, but Steve’s medicine doesn’t hurt. It just feels cool and soothing.
‘Darcy said you three made a plane together last week,’ Maggie says gently, crouching down so she’s at their level. ‘Can I see it?’
Steve hesitates, and Tony sucks in a hopeful sniffly breath, and then Steve’s hand comes to rest carefully on Tony’s back again. ‘It’s – it’s okay,’ Steve says again, and his voice is kind of – soft, and Tony likes it. He cries a little bit more, and Steve starts carefully patting him.
to be ashamed of.’ She drops her forehead to touch against Tony’s, huffing out a little laughing breath. ‘Sorry. Just – I just wanted you to know.’
Steve isn’t paying any attention to Jane. He isn’t drawing either, which is weird, because Steve really, really loves drawing. He’s staring over at Tony and Darcy with his eyebrows drawn together and his mouth in a flat line.
‘Best doctor ever,’ he says firmly. ‘She’s going to be the best. Lives with her girlfriend, nice girl too. They got lots of cats. Five! Five cats!’
But then Steve makes a little huffing sound that’s almost like a laugh, and she says gently, ‘No, that’s. Yeah, we’re friends, of course we’re friends, Tony. Didn’t you –? I mean, if you
‘Tony, hey. What’s wrong?’ Steve says urgently. ‘You weren’t answering the comms, you raced back here… Are you hurt? – God, Tony, if you’re hurt, tell me!’
Clint wanders in and tries to steal the crispy cookies that Steve’s busy piling onto a plate; Tony can’t be bothered to open her eyes, but she hears his aggrieved ‘Ow!’ as Steve silently and efficiently fends him off. Then Steve’s coaxing Tony up again, herding her out to the lounge, and then Tony’s somehow curled up on the sofa with a soft blanket cuddled around her, the chocolate and cookies in easy reaching distance, and Steve sitting
There’s soft, curly white fur – and a round, cuddly stuffed body with a floppy tail, and a bright pink bow, and a little pink nose, and black eyes and the sweetest little face Tony has ever, ever seen, a little bit like a cat and a little bit like a bear and even a little bit like a puppy. And it sits there and looks up at him as though it’s asking to be picked up and cuddled and loved, and Tony draws in a tiny disbelieving breath.
It’s such a relief, sometimes, to just slip away into that warm, soft headspace where Tony can be – just very small and very helpless, but with Steve always there to look after her. Steve is kind and strong and can tell Tony what to do and – and just take charge for a while, and it’s good, so good, and Tony doesn’t know quite how she ever got so lucky as to have Steve, lovely perfect Steve.
Steve reaches out and takes her hand, pulling a little, and Tony comes forward in a rush to sit next to her on the bed. And Steve just leans against her, so Tony leans back a little; and then Steve’s head is resting on her shoulder and their arms are all twined round each other again and it’s actually – it’s
Tony’s got lots of racing cars and aeroplanes and building sets and things, at home, but not very many bears. He just has two. There’s a big special fancy one that’s made out of pure white mohair and cost a lot of money. Everyone says he must make sure he doesn’t get it dirty, so it usually stays in a box at the top of the cupboard.
If Dad comes, maybe – maybe Tony could show him the special thing he’s been working on in his room. It’s a remote control car, with a real circuit board and everything, and Tony’s nearly finished and it’s going to go so good. Maybe Dad will like it so much that he’ll even come and play catch with Tony afterwards. They’d done that once, when Tony was smaller, and it had been just the
, it’s none of his bloody business. Tony bounces and squeezes Steve’s hand and snarks back at the others in a vague sort of way, and it’s
Then Steve turns around and crouches next to Tony; and he feels Steve’s hand on his shoulder, gently shifting him. Steve stretches himself out alongside him, sliding a strong arm around Tony’s waist and pulling him in to fit against his chest.
Shit, that’s not – her kissing Steve isn’t platonic, not at all, even if it’s just Steve’s face, Tony realises belatedly; there’s a second of bright panic, but then Steve makes a soft sound, almost content, resting her forehead against Tony’s cheek. Steve must have not noticed, or not read into it, or something. Tony exhales softly with something that’s a bit like relief, or maybe heartache.
Mr Karolidis is a good teacher. He shows Steve how to measure out the flour and sugar, and break the eggshells with a single tap, not too hard and not too soft. Steve is good with his hands, and he’s done some cooking before, so it’s fun.
it would be to nuzzle into Steve’s neck, breathe in the Steve-scent, lick at Steve’s pulse with the tip of her tongue.
Bill the Inventor by Garth Nix is a real book that I read as a kid. So is the book Ms Potts was reading to the class in the last chapter - The Balloon Tree by Phoebe Gilman. :)
,’ and she’s kissing Tony’s forehead and holding her safe in the curve of one arm, Steve’s firm gentle fingers moving in a steady circling caress that makes Tony choke out wordlessly, her back arching as she chases the frantic lovely feeling of it. And Steve holds her and touches her, moving and moving and
in Steve's face and she's seeing properly again, her face quivering. 'Steve,' Tony says again, and now it sounds like
But then Steve’s arms are around her, hugging her tightly; and Steve’s face is pressed hard into Tony’s hair as though
And then she looks up and there’s Steve, looking at her, and Steve’s face is covered by the mask but her mouth is soft and her eyes are blue and intense behind the eye-slits, and Tony, who’s managed to almost forget the letter in the clean bright focus of battle, reels as remembrance comes sweeping back in a messy tangle of emotion.
He doesn’t say anything else for a while, and Steve turns his head worriedly on the grass. ‘Sorry,’ he says again, and his voice sounds stupid and small and miserable.
'Yeah, save it, it's gross,' Clint says, grinning around a bite of cookie, because he's actually twelve, and Tony's face is going bright and hot and her throat's closed up and there's a tight panicky feeling in her chest because
. She trusts Steve, and Steve’s arm feels so nice around her shoulders, even if Tony knows that it’s just Steve being warm and friendly as she always is. And yes, she feels kind of stupidly happy right now, but she decides that it’s okay if she just doesn't think too hard about anything.
He wants to ask and check, to make completely sure that Darcy meant it, but he doesn’t know what to say in front of Tasha, so he touches Darcy gently on the arm and looks at her pleadingly, hoping she'll understand what he means without him having to say anything out loud. Darcy tips her head around and looks at him upside down, being silly. Her glasses nearly fall off her nose. ‘We should have a friend han’shake,’ she says, coming back up the right way.
Tony eases awake to quiet singing, low and tender. She’s warm and comfortable and content, resting against soft, naked skin, fingers stroking her hair; and she remembers,
‘Oh, sweetheart.’ That’s Maggie’s voice, sounding soft and distressed. And then Tony feels Darcy come squeezing up on his other side, patting his hand and stroking his hair.
Tony goes very still, stopping his toy car where it’s been quietly driving along the edge of the tablecloth. A birthday party? Whose birthday? Darcy’s already had her birthday. Maggie called his Mom! He looks at Mom with wide eyes.
‘Hey, it’s fine,’ Steve says quickly, and that’s when Tony registers the flowers, and what the hell, why didn’t JARVIS warn her about this, this is another one of those tragic moments where she spectacularly messes everything up, and her heart drops down, down, down, and it – it just hurts, after this morning.
Maggie offers him a little folded up pocket thing, toasted on the outside and with melted cheese dolloping deliciously out of the corners. Tony thanks her politely but looks dubiously at the strange piece of food, not sure what it is. But Steve's grabbing one of the pockets eagerly and taking a huge bite, so Tony thinks it must be nice.
Justin only ever does anything when Steve’s over on the other side of the room. Tony’s not sure why, but he thinks it’s because Steve likes fighting. Steve would probably fight Justin Hammer and kick his butt, just because it was a good excuse, even though he’s not specially friends with Tony. That’s just the sort of thing Steve does.
He glances back up at Steve, who’s looking at him curiously, head tilted to one side. And then Steve does something different, because he smiles a little bit at Tony, just a little tweak at the corner of his mouth.
she’s a mess, sweaty and covered in black smudges of grease and wearing an ancient tank top and stained jeans, and God, why had she told JARVIS to let Steve in, that was, that was a shitty decision –
,’ Steve says, his voice exasperated, and he moves around so he’s slotted a little behind Tony’s back, his strong warm arm bracing him. He guides the bowl to Tony’s mouth, tipping it so that warm broth touches Tony’s lips, and Tony slurps at it greedily, draining the liquid from the chunks of meat floating in it. It’s so
‘Oh,’ he says. Then he looks back up to watch Pepper cross the playground, and Steve hasn’t finished his sausage roll but he’s had enough. He scrunches his paper bag viciously, jumping to his feet and pitching the rubbish into the bin with unnecessary force.
‘Obviously not him,’ Steve says drily. ‘I wonder if he’s realised yet that he’s head-over-heels for Clint?’ She presses a little kiss to Tony’s temple.
, Steve’s hand is there at the soft centre between Tony’s legs, fingers dancing through the dark curls for a few unbearable moments before she finds it, the little bundle of nerve endings that makes Tony stiffen and cry out sharply and writhe desperately against the pressure.
She opens the door, and there it is, just a little white envelope, with ‘Tony’ written on the front in Steve’s flowing old-time handwriting; and Tony bites at her fist to hold back a little wounded sound.
This chapter is just purely sex and emotion. You can easily skip it if that’s not your thing, though, and pick up at the next chapter.
Steve looks grumpy every day. He's not talking to Jane at all, because Jane comes over to see Darcy and complains about it. Jane's the kind of person who likes to make friends, but Steve won't talk to her at all, she says.
They play three different games on the grass, and Tony and Darcy and Natasha end up getting the giggles after they do something funny with a beanbag, called Hot Potato. After that, they go on a walk to find flowers to make more crowns with. Maggie even helps Tony find flowers that will be good to take back to Mom, and a jar to put them in, and they sit side by side on the grass near the others to make a pretty arrangement in the jar.
‘Thank you,’ Tony whispers, and reaches for the bottle with his free hand. He’s feeling better, now, with Steve and Darcy with him, but he wants to just stay here for a little bit.
But then there are hands on Tony’s shoulders, warm and firm, gripping them and shaking gently. Steve. Steve’s still there. Steve’s hands are holding onto her, anchoring, and Steve’s saying something, and this time Tony can make sense of it.
She turns into the touch, nestling her cheek against Steve’s hand, and slurs out, ‘S’nice,’ because it is, it is nice, nice,
Ms Potts looks at all of them, at Tony’s trembling lip, Justin’s gleeful smile, Steve’s scowl, and closes her eyes for a moment, in a pained sort of way. ‘Okay,’ she says after a moment, ‘I think I’m going to have to separate you.’
There's a pile of tiny nuts and bolts in front of her, and she shoves them roughly out of the way, but a couple of them fall off the surface and she's too slow and stiff to catch them. They fall to the ground with a little peltering noise, and roll away in different directions as she watches.
big, with long hair that's almost as brightly golden as Steve's. Darcy bounces excited around him. ‘Can-you-push-us-on-the-swings-please-please-please,’ she bursts out, out of breath. Tony thinks that Thor’s going to tell them to go away, but he smiles good-naturedly down at them instead.
He suddenly remembers that he’s only supposed to look, not touch, unless he’s given permission, that’s what Dad and Mom always tell him. He snatches his finger away from the robot picture and quickly glances round, but luckily no-one’s noticed.
Darcy props her elbows on the table and cups her face in her hands to think about it. ‘We can be if you wanna,’ she decides. ‘But you gotta be nice to Tony.’
get in trouble for, you’re better than that,’ she scolds, and Steve blinks and chuckles a bit. Tony slips under her arm, supporting her across to Steve’s cosy little kitchenette.
‘GIVE IT BACK!’ Steve roars. His face is pink and angry and his hands are making aggressive grabby fists at Tony’s side of the table, trying to get his pencil back.
, everywhere, touching, exploring, cupping, kneading gently at the softness of Tony’s breasts, tracing the mass of scarring in between them. Tony squirms ecstatically into the touch, tugging at Steve’s shirt, because she needs Steve’s skin against hers, she
Tony’s so wobbly and wanting that it’s hard, but she tries and Steve helps and soon her arms and legs are in the soft white onesie. It has a long row of snaps all the way up the front, widely spaced, from the crotch to the neck. ‘I’ll button you up,’ Steve soothes, when Tony plucks at them with helpless fumbly fingers; and Steve kneels down in front of her with a smile.
‘Captain Rogers is very concerned, and determined to remain until she has spoken to you and ascertained your welfare for herself,’ JARVIS tells her.
When he struggles his eyes open, the first person he sees is Tony, white faced and looking terrified, hanging on to Steve’s hand despite the teacher’s efforts to guide him away. Tony needs a hug, Steve can see that
The rest of the team are sprawled around the kitchen in various attitudes of laziness. Bruce sees her arrive first, giving her a gentle smile and a soft, 'Hi, Tony.'
kiss, realer than anything, and Tony trembles and kisses back, feeling the lovely softness of Steve’s lips, the gentle way Steve’s arms curve round her waist and hold her close. Then Tony makes a little helpless sound,
Steve stands up straight and squares his shoulders. ‘Don’t worry,’ he says. ‘I’ll look after you, Tony, m’kay?’ He puts his arm around Tony, and Tony sighs happily. Friends are so
The next few minutes are blurry and confused, with pain in his chest and wheezing and gasping for breath. The yard duty teacher’s rummaging for his puffer and someone’s grabbing his hand, and someone else is running for the First Aid lady and then someone’s helping him take puffs of Ventolin and hold them in; and slowly the tight bands around his lungs ease up.
When he feels strong enough, one warm day, Tony crawls out to sit next to Steve in the sunlight, dragging a big soft deerskin with him. Steve looks up, smiling, and says, ‘Tony!’, and for the first time, Tony smiles back, hesitant, a little questioning tweak at the corner of his mouth. Steve’s smile brightens, his eyes crinkling, and Tony shifts closer and curls softly into his side, wanting to be close.
Rhodey comes up behind the two of them when everyone’s distracted with Clint shooting the star off the top of the tree, putting a big warm hand on Tony’s shoulder. ‘So. No need for any more matchmaking?’ he murmurs, and Tony feels like crying, which is really stupid because she’s so happy it hurts, and she turns round and hugs him, hard, pressing her face into his shoulder. Rhodey pats her back and gives her curls an affectionate tweak.
, could she, that would be ridiculous), 'You wished to be alerted in any case of the other occupants of the tower posing a risk to themselves or others. I believe Captain Rogers may currently be in such a situation.'
and makes me very happy! Please go and look at her darling curly-haired Tony and Steve and shower her with praise!
Steve smiles just a little bit, down at the batter. ‘Yeah,’ he says quietly, and Mr Karolidis’s hand comes and rests on his shoulder for moment, warm and reassuring.
Someone’s thumping on the workshop glass with great enthusiasm and determination, damn them. Tony makes a grumbling noise, because Steve stops what she’s doing to listen, and what she was doing was sucking a wonderfully thorough bruise onto Tony’s neck.
When Tony’s thoroughly patted dry, Steve lifts her in her arms and carries her into the bedroom, setting her down on the bed. There’s a fluffy snow-white onesie folded on the bed; Steve shakes it out and smiles down at Tony. ‘Nice and cuddly,’ she says. ‘Can you stand up while I help you on with this?’
, when Tony’s feeling really bad, then he climbs up on his steps and fetches Old-Bear down and hugs him, just for a little bit, really carefully so he doesn’t get hurt.)
‘Okay, yeah, let her in, J,’ she says eagerly, and bounces out from behind the workbench, pushing back the short curls that have stuck to the dampness of her forehead. Something smears beneath her fingers, and Tony suddenly glances down at herself and realises that, shit,
Steve kisses Tony’s collarbone, feather-light, threading their fingers together. ‘Tony?’ she says softly, and brings her other hand up to stroke Tony’s cheek. ‘That letter I left. It was just. Just wanted to – ask you out for dinner. A – a real proper date, you know.’ She pauses, and then says quietly, ‘Seems like you’re always doin’ things for me. Like to do something just for you.’
good, because that way leads to things that hurt, but Tony’s head is too fuzzy to care and she just looks wistfully up at Steve’s face and basks in it.
Steve, even if Steve does look like the most lickable thing in the world right now, warm and soft and delicious, rumpled, watching Tony with that soft, soft look in her eyes. Tony wets her lips and drags her eyes away from the point of Steve’s pulse. ‘O-okay,’ she says, and God, is she stuttering a bit? ‘That’s – I think that’s done, I don’t want to, to cover it up, it’s better if it’s exposed to the air, um. Can I – your hand?’
Tony huddles on the play bench and wraps his arms around himself, feeling sick and horrible and scared. Steve and Darcy are
Mom works late on Thursdays, but she’s got an arrangement with Mr Karolidis in the next apartment, so Steve always goes there and spreads his homework on Mr Karolidis’s battered wood table and gets fed butter biscuits and pie with apricots. Mr Karolidis is old, very old, with thick, peppery grey-white hair and bushy eyebrows above bright brown eyes.
nice, and he doesn’t know why he’s still crying. He blinks at Steve through wet lashes, and Steve is watching him with a sort of worried face.
When they walk over to the picnic blanket, Steve keeps a firm grip on Tony’s hand. Clint and Natasha and Jane are there, munching, and they look up and grin and wave. Even Clint gives a small smile, and Tasha tells Tony, through a mouthful, that his flower crown looks nice. Tony grins back, pleased. ‘I can show you how,’ he offers, and Tasha nods.
And now Steve’s lips are moving, and she’s saying something that Tony can’t hear over the panicked white noise her brain’s making. What, what is Steve saying? Tony’s hands are clenching and unclenching at her sides and she
, because he has a special calendar sticky-taped onto the inside of his closet door in his bedroom, and he’s marking off every day. This year Dad said he might be able to come to Tony’s birthday party, and every time Tony draws through another day with his fat red marker, he squeezes his eyes shut and clasps his hands together and wishes really
That’s… okay. Tony lets out a relieved breath and edges into the seat, unzipping his backpack and pulling out his pile of stuff. Mom had given the list of stuff to Dad’s PA, because she was busy and couldn’t get it herself. But Tony had tipped out the bag she’s brought onto his bedroom floor and written his name on everything. He got the S for Stark right every time now. He used to get mixed up about which way the curl went, but that was ages ago, when he was little. Now he knows it’s the same as the logo on Stark Industries, of course. He knows all his letters now, and numbers up to 100, and he knows lots of other stuff too.
Her mouth closes around Steve’s nipple, warm and wet and suckling, and Steve groans deep in her throat. ‘Tony, baby,’ she gets out, ‘We don’t have to – you – ’ but Tony only sucks her breast in deeper, laving her tongue across Steve’s areola, tasting the perfect, silky, pebbled texture of it before tracing the tip of her tongue around the nub.
‘Tony, it’s the evening,’ Steve says, rather gently, and now her hand is rubbing little circles into Tony’s shoulder, and it feels so good,
‘Just need to get your wet little panties off,’ she says, patting Tony’s rear. ‘Stay still for me, baby.’
Thor trips over the TV – yeah, Tony’s not sure quite how that happens either, she was busy with her head in the microwave. There’s a huge crash and a high-pitched squeal and then an uproar; Tony hears Steve laughing so hard she can barely breathe, and her stomach does a little uncertain excited flip. She wishes she could go and see what’s happening, bask in Steve and the way her eyes crinkle up at the corners and close completely when she laughs.
Steve’s hand rubs once more on her shoulder. ‘Just wait here, hey? Be back in a minute,’ she murmurs, and her hand runs gently through Tony’s short dark hair as she moves away. It sends little tingles down Tony’s back.
She looks at the flowers, focuses on a single blue iris, making herself do the deep breathing and conscious relaxing that they’d taught her, calming techniques to manage her panic attacks. Except it’s not exactly a panic attack, it’s just – Steve. God,
Tony doesn’t want to talk to anyone about it. He presses his nose into the desk and smells the woody pencil-shaving smell, and squeezes his eyes closed around the hot wetness that keeps gathering. It’s
Steve catches her before she falls, suckling Tony’s tongue before slowly pulling her lips away. She rests her cheek against Tony’s forehead, rubbing her back to calm her down. ‘Alright, baby,’ she coaxes. ‘I’m just going to lift you into the water now, okay? Arms round my neck.’ Tony holds onto her, warm and yielding and submissive, and Steve scoops her up and lifts her into the warm water, kneeling next to her.
After the pockets, there’s fairy bread and cupcakes from the hamper and pink fizzy drink, and then Phil pulls out a big cakebox and opens it, and Tony’s eyes get bigger and bigger with wonderment, because it’s a huge big chocolate cake shaped like a
Tony makes a mumbling noise. Now, now would be a really good time to sit up and act like an adult and apologise to Steve for taking her bed, and crawl back to her own room to recover from the embarrassment. Except, when she sneaks a one-eyed look out through a crack in the covers, Steve just looks so normal and – and kind, and the warm calming weight of Steve's hand on her back feels nice. Good. Almost like Steve doesn't mind Tony being there in her bed, and there's a thought, she’s
‘Something my Ma used to sing to me,’ Steve says. ‘It’s an old Irish lullaby. I – well. It reminded me of you.’ She’s blushing a little, Tony notices, that soft pink Steve-flush that creeps across her face and down her neck.
at her, looking into her – into her eyes, and she can’t think of words and for once her mouth isn’t just randomly babbling to fill the void. Her words have just stopped, dried up.
‘No,’ Tony says, jumping up in relief at having something to do, ‘no, here’s good, really good, I’ll just move these –’ and she pushes and rearranges things on the bench so that there’s a space for the box of flowers. ‘There!’
He releases Steve’s hand reluctantly and watches as Steve goes to drag the deer closer. Then Steve looks up and smiles at him, and sits down next to Tony in the skins, close enough that his thigh touches Tony’s cheek – and oh, that’s better, that’s much better. Tony sighs in relief and turns his face to nestle against Steve’s leg, sleepily watching what Steve’s doing until he dozes off again.
‘Yes, Steve,’ she whispers, ‘all yours, just for you, only for you,’ and Steve makes a wild sound against her skin and sucks
Mr Karolidis is telling him about his granddaughter Natalia, who goes to the uni and is learning how to be a doctor. Steve’s heard bits about her before, bits about all of Mr Karolidis’s family, but this time, it’s all about Natalia. Natalia is a good girl, he says enthusiastically, a good girl who works hard! He’s proud of her.
if she hadn’t cracked and let herself be swept up in the moment with Steve, let Steve kiss her and, and,
Tony’s small, he’s always been small, and he’d run and run and run, desperate and hunted, away from his tribe, away from the altar of sacrifice and the stone knife cutting into his chest. And when he had finally fallen into a grassy hollow, sobbing with exhaustion, he’d had nothing to stay his hunger, just his deerskin and his amulet and the round, bleeding wound in his chest, carved deeply in the symbol of a god-gift, a sacrifice.
He seems to want to explain something to Tony, repeating the same few words slowly and carefully, before realising that Tony doesn’t know what they mean. Tony watches Steve anxiously as he rubs a hand over his face and blows out a breath in frustration.
Steve folds his arms sullenly, his jaw sticking out. He doesn’t say anything, so Tony knows he has to be the one to tell. ‘It was me,’ he whispers.
Tony beams at her, feeling too overcome to speak. He nods hard instead, up and down, and Darcy shrieks so loud that Ms Potts calls out, ‘Indoor voices!’ And then Darcy sweeps him into a tight excited hug and then grabs his hand and pulls him along to his desk.
, the way he touches Tony and never harms him, even though he’s so much bigger and Tony’s hurt and useless and not good for anything. He
After a few minutes Maggie goes away and comes back hand in hand with a tall lady with red hair like Ms Potts, except for that it’s straight and short instead of long and curly. She has a nice smile, like Maggie, and when Darcy sees her she jumps up and runs to give her a hug. ‘Mummy!’
Tony quietens as Steve turns back to her, watching, still and trustful, as Steve sets her hands on Tony’s sides, avoiding her breasts. She palms the skin there, enjoying the silky, warm feel of it, the soft layer of cuddliness that covers Tony’s small strong body. Tony makes a small contented sound of happiness at the touch, looking sweetly up into Steve’s face; and Steve crinkles her eyes at her and leans forward to touch their noses together for a moment, a bunny kiss.
Tony likes it very, very much. He likes the way Steve’s hands feel and the way Steve looks at him and the way his whole body feels warm and ready and trembly, as though he wants to press up against Steve and feel Steve’s skin against his own, everywhere. ‘Yes,’ he whispers, ‘yes, yes, Steve, yes,’ so that Steve knows how good it feels; and Steve says ‘Tony, Tony,’ in a voice that cracks in the middle.
And if he does anything wrong, he can just watch and see what Steve does. It’ll be okay. Everything will be okay.
‘Nah,’ Darcy says knowledgably. ‘He’s not angry, silly! He wants you to be sitting next to him, not Jane. But
But then Steve reaches out, very carefully, and squeezes his hand without saying anything. Tony squeezes back gratefully. Steve’s hand is hard and small and safe, and Tony doesn’t know why Steve keeps taking his hand but he likes it
Her free hand is somehow under Steve’s shirt, clutching and caressing her breast almost frantically, her thumb circling and rubbing Steve’s nipple in time with the movement of her fingers between her legs. Steve is gasping, now, herself, and she turns her face against Tony’s cheek and catches her lips again, kissing her deeply, her tongue flickering along the sensitive inside of her lips, so that Tony can’t help whimpering again.
Steve laughs aloud. He puts down his mortar and stone and twists about to face Tony, his face soft and fond. ‘You,’ he says, playful, and cups his hands around Tony’s shoulders, stroking his thumbs over the skin. Tony shivers in pleasure. Then Steve leans forward and touches their noses together, and Tony grins wide and bright and presses back eagerly.
Steve’s smiling a little, now, and looking right at Tony. And it’s like she’s a light and Tony’s a moth or something, because Tony finds she’s moving towards her. It just happens like that. Steve’s warm and bright and Tony wants to get closer to her, and her legs just do a thing without checking with her first.
Then Steve flips them so that she's on her back, pulling Tony onto her chest. And – God, it's incredible, Tony can
And it’s really stupid that there’s a big hard lump thing in Tony’s throat just now, and that her eyes are going all blinky, because there’s no goddamn
Okay, I’m sorry, I lied – no soft kisses just yet, because I felt like giving them some more buildup. However, the next chapter is in the works, and launches with Steve having a nightmare slash panic attack, and Tony comforting her. So we’ll see where that goes…
‘Knife?’ Tony asks Steve. He’s sitting cross-legged in a patch of warm sunshine, basking like lizards do; Steve looks up from the flint he’s chipping at. There’s two piles in front of him, one of waste chips, too small to be used, and the other of good, large, sharp ones, that Steve can use for hunting and skinning and preparing food. Tony reaches forward and points questioningly at the good pile, turning his palm up in a beseeching gesture.
They fight their way through, and Tony dismantles the ingenious crab hive mind in seven minutes while Steve subdues the psychopathic robotics genius behind it. With the hive mind out of the picture, the crabs stop replicating at every blow, but it takes a long time nonetheless to get them all rounded up. When they regroup, it’s late afternoon, they’re all battered and weary, and Tony, for her part, is
‘Bye Mom,’ he says quickly, but she’s already pulling the car away, glossy pale pink fingernails curled delicately around the wheel. It’s okay. Tony knows she’s busy.
Tony sucks in a deep breath. He thinks about Darcy hugging him and Steve fighting anyone who’s mean to him, to make himself braver. And then he gently pushes his curly pinky finger towards Clint, and says, very softly, ‘D’you want to be friends?’
‘It’s good. Hearing you talk,’ Steve says very softly when Tony stops for breath. ‘Never – never want you to shut up, Tony.’ And Tony blinks hard, because are there
Steve hunches his shoulders. And then – then he stiffly sticks out his hand, pinky outstretched, and waits, scowling down at his knees.
, and the worst thing of all is the horrible guilty embarrassed feeling in the pit of his tummy. And the big sore lump in his throat.
Everything is deliciously warm and hazy and content, after that. Steve brushes Tony’s hair away from his face and cradles him gently; he’s laughing softly, happily, and Tony smiles dreamily up at his face. ‘Steve,’ he murmurs, and Steve gives his cheek an affectionate lick, nudging Tony’s face with his nose. Tony nuzzles back.
at that, at the way Steve’s voice goes quiet and melting at the last, and she darts a glance up at Steve through her eyelashes. God, Steve’s so
, but Tony doesn’t have a gold pencil. Steve does. Steve has a very very special set of pencils, metal colours, which he got for his birthday. Gold and silver and bronze and metal red and metal blue and green and purple and orange. Steve’s very proud of them, and keeps them in a special pencil case of their own. They’re
When the week's over, Steve marches up to Ms Potts. 'Can Tony come back now?' he says loudly, getting to the point. Tony can't help hearing him, and he looks up with wide eyes, clasping his hands tightly together.
‘Hurt,’ Steve says softly and clearly, pointing at the gash. Tony slowly raises his eyes to look at Steve’s face, uncertain; and Steve’s eyes smile at him a little, his face and voice gentle. ‘Hurt,’ Steve repeats, still pointing at his hand, and then, holding Tony’s eyes, he slowly brings his pointing finger up towards Tony’s chest wound. ‘Hurt,’ he repeats, and oh, Tony knows what the word means now!
‘C’mon,’ Darcy says encouragingly, and walks the bear into Tony’s lap. And Tony reaches out reverently and curls his arms around the bright fur and oh, it’s so
She steals a sip of Rhodey’s drink. It’s nice; orangey and smooth. Rhodey pulls her in for an affectionate half-hug, and Tony cuddles into him happily, resting her head on his shoulder. ‘Hey, sis,’ Rhodey says, and tugs gently at her hair. ‘Sst. Steve’s watching you,’ he adds very quietly, into her ear, and Tony jumps and stiffens.
And JARVIS is saying something that Tony can't hear, she can't bear listening to JARVIS right now, and she shudders and sniffles again and presses her face pathetically into her arms.
The boy who sits in front of Tony is called Justin Hammer and Tony doesn’t like him even a little bit. He says Tony’s robot pictures are dumb and that he can draw way better robots any day. And he says Tony’s curly hair is girly and once he tried to take one of Tony’s pictures and pretend it was his. Tony had got the picture back, because he turned it over and his name was on it. Justin had let Tony snatch it back so he wouldn’t get into trouble, but he glared at him and said ‘You stink.’ Tony hates him.
‘Merry Christmas, Tony,’ Steve whispers. Her breath is warm and soft on Tony’s temple, and Tony nestles closer because it feels so
even if she’s pretty rubbish at science, and Tony thinks Darcy would be really great with Bruce because Bruce is also awesome and really needs someone to make him laugh, they’d be
(in both good and bad ways) for me over the last six months. Please don’t leave comments about how long I’ve taken; my life is not exactly an easy one and I’ve been doing my best. I’ve been writing this chapter slowly over the entire time, though. Hope you enjoy!
, so much, and even though she knows Steve will give her everything if she waits a little, it’s – it’s just so much.
' Tony says quickly, and then gulps. But Steve looks abashed. 'Sorry,' he says, but then points at Tasha's face. 'But don't!’ he adds, getting the last word before he plumps back into his chair. Natasha pokes her tongue out at his back.
She finds cotton wool in a packet in the kit, dunks some in the bowl, scrounges up a gauze pad to catch the drips. ‘Ready?’ she asks, and Steve looks at her with soft eyes and twists her head so that Tony can reach the wound more easily.
‘Hurt!’ he agrees delightedly, and Steve’s eyes crinkle a bit more, laughing at him a little. Then he turns and reaches behind him, and comes back with a small hollowed stone in his hand, a mortar, filled with a little mound of something.
But Tony puts his head down and presses it into Steve’s side, crying with big choking sobs pressed into Steve’s shirt. Steve looks down at him worriedly, because he doesn’t know quite what to do to comfort him. He reaches out weakly to touch Tony’s silky curls, stroking them with a wobbly hand, and that seems to help, because Tony’s sobbing calms and he presses his head into Steve’s hand.
He’s wonderfully, wonderfully warm and comfortable, and something soft is wrapped around him. His eyelids struggle open and he sees warm red fire-sparks dancing in the darkness – and for a moment, a lovely moment, he thinks he is a child again, wrapped in his mother’s bearskin, safe and close by her fire.
It's evening, and Tony wanders down to the kitchen. She's been in the workshop for hours, fixing the rotator joints on the suit's gauntlets, and she's tired again, but it's the good sort of tired, the sort of tired that comes from working and testing and tinkering with things until they're
Tony writhes comfortably against her once more. She feels so safe and so good, but Steve – Steve needs her, she can feel it, feel the desire in the shake and set of Steve’s warm, warm body. ‘Mm,’ she mumbles. ‘Steve. You too,’ and wriggles herself languidly until her mouth can get easy access to Steve’s nipples, running her wet tongue over her lips.
Steve’s waiting at the landing pad, somehow, her hair mussed from her helmet, her face concerned. Tony stares at her for a second, then sees Thor standing behind her. He must have flown Steve there, and it’s his worried, kind expression that tips Tony over the edge, tears stinging at her eyes behind the impassive faceplate. She pauses the auto-disarming bots, because she
‘Poking bottoms is rude,’ Jane says seriously, nodding. She and Darcy have come up with their arms linked together.
He swallows hard and turns back to the school. It’s very big, but he’s used to big buildings, come on, he’s not
‘Just need to – to,’ she whispers, and shifts awkwardly, and this is stupid, it shouldn’t be embarrassing, and yet – and yet. It’s
Except. Except, Steve is curling closer, and she’s – is she shivering a bit less? And then, just as Tony’s clenching down on her jaw to stop it from opening and doing words again, Steve says, huskily but calmer, ‘Tony. Can you – can you go on talking. Please. Need to – just need to hear.’ Steve trails off, and wow, that’s new, that’s just weird, Steve’s asking her to
Steve draws back just a little, then, looking down with a furrow between his brows, and Tony follows his gaze. Steve is looking at Tony’s hands, taking them gently in his own and turning them over to look at the reddened palms. ‘Poor hands,’ he says softly.
,’ he says, muffled, and then looks up and says it over and over again, ‘thank you, thank you, thank you!’
Pepper Potts is in the year above, and she’s tall and beautiful and has shiny strawberry blonde hair and freckles. She’s
Then Darcy looks up and sees him, and her face spreads into a big smile and she waves and beckons enthusiastically. Her Mamá’s looking over and smiling too, and Tony suddenly feels terribly, awfully shy, his body going all tight and stiff and scared.
There’s a gentle hand in her hair. Steve’s hand. Steve strokes Tony’s short curls behind her ear, and says, ‘Tony. You okay?’
Steve's hands are under Tony's T-shirt again, and that's good, that's so very, very good, and Tony writhes under the touch. She needs – she
There’s a quiet chuckle, the brush of a thumb over Tony’s cheekbone. 'Sleep well,' she hears, and then something that could almost be, '
Steve's got his head down when Tony gets there. He's drawing. Tony puts his stuff back on the desk, very quietly, and slides into his seat.
Tony shudders at the touch, a whole-body shudder, and then her mouth finds Steve’s, warm and open and deep, and oh, this is so much better than anything she could have imagined, Steve’s fingers stroking and exploring her back while Steve’s tongue slides softly across the delicate skin of her lips. Tony’s fingers fumble at Steve’s uniform, God, why is it so much in the way, why are there so many
They both have golden hair, the boy and the lady, very beautiful soft silky golden hair. Tony’s hair is dark and curly, like his dad’s. His mom’s hair is fair and silky, but it’s paler than this, cool and blonde. The boy and the lady have hair like sunshine, Tony decides.
Except. Except that Steve’s looking down at her, now, smiling in a warm pleased sort of way as though Tony’s done something to make her happy; and her arm comes off the sofa back and winds gently round Tony’s shoulder, fitting as though it was made to be there. Tony jumps, skittish, and then lets herself relax, because this is
Everything is hazy and painful and growing darker, darker, and as Tony’s eyes close he sees the Stranger turn towards him, his teeth bared, a great stone axe gripped in his hand.
, she has the softest teddy and mums who make cupcakes with her and take her on picnics. But Darcy is really nice, she deserves nice things. He sighs a little bit, softly, and puts some more tape on the plane’s engine to make sure it doesn’t fall off.
‘Steve,’ the Stranger says, and points his thumb to his own chest. ‘Steve.’ His name. He searches Tony’s eyes, and then points at him with a questioning look.
‘I didn’t mean, I – I don’t, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, here,’ Tony says helplessly, shoving the pencil at Steve. Now Steve’s going to hate him, Steve’s going to gang up with Justin Hammer to be mean to Tony, this is the worst day
unsteady, but he goes slowly, carefully, and manages well enough. Split wooden sticks, to hold the blunt end of the flint; and then three long strips of skin, threaded across and over each other to make a stronger braided strap. Tony fastens the strap tightly around the wooden sticks and the base of the flint, winding it around and through itself so it makes a solid padded grip.
made it? For me?’ His eyes are shining in the most beautiful way, looking right at Steve; and Steve can’t help smiling back, a little.
They’re fighting a kind of army of self-replicating metal crabs, which someone thought was a good idea to unleash on Christmas Day. Steve’s on the comms, steady as ever, calling directions on their plan of attack. Somewhere, locked away inside, a part of Tony is aching and aching, but Iron Woman is in control, not Tony Stark.
And then somehow she’s got her face down on the workbench, arms curled around her head, and big shuddering sobs keep rising up in her chest, hating herself for crying like this, and it’s – it’s just, she’s so bloody lonely, and sometimes it feels like she’s trying so hard and yet – and Steve.
He looks up in delight, because it’s Steve! Steve’s waiting for him outside school, with his hands shoved in his pockets and an intent, earnest sort of look on his face. ‘Hi Steve!’ Tony says happily, and scurries over to him, hauling his schoolbag.
to touch, and this time when her hand trembles downwards, Steve lets her, kisses her hair and ear and temple. ‘It’s okay, sweet thing, go ahead,’ she says, and she sounds breathless too, still moving gently, perfectly inside her; and finally,
Steve laughs and sweeps her up in her arms. ‘Shower first?’ she offers, and Tony kisses her neck in enthusiastic agreement.
And then Tony’s knees buckle and fold beneath him, and he falls to the ground with a little stumbling thud.
She actually brings Tony flowers. A beautiful big bunch of blue irises and red carnations in a box with a gold ribbon, very, very Steve-like. Tony, of course, is down in the workshop, tinkering, and then JARVIS says, ‘Captain Rogers is outside the door requesting access, Sir,’ and Tony’s heart does that big
It’s no surprise that she’s suddenly tearful. Steve knows, too, she always knows what to do when Tony’s tears come; there’s a gentle hand rubbing her back, up and down, and Steve’s voice murmuring reassurances against Tony’s forehead. Tony sobs into Steve’s comforting shoulder, letting herself be rocked and petted and soothed.
, it's one of those hard things that he's never quite sure of because he's never had friends before (except for maybe Rhodey who lives a long way away). But Darcy had said that Tony was her friend, right in front of Tasha, and Darcy knows all about things like that, so – so it must be really truly true.
‘Medicine,’ Steve says, dipping his finger into the substance. It’s a strange green mash of pulverised herbs, and Tony watches curiously as Steve opens his injured hand and spreads it across the wound. ‘Makes it better,’ Steve says, and then he points again at Tony’s chest.
The next time, Tony’s woken by the sound of movement, and Steve’s not holding him anymore. Steve’s not even in the cave, and Tony feels frightened suddenly. Where is Steve? What if he’s gone?
The Irish Gaelic lullaby Steve sings to Tony is called Seoithín Seo Hó (Hush-a-bye Baby), and the lines above translate to:
, Steve should be happy and dorky and so, so warm, not scrunched and broken on the floor. Tony reaches out to touch her arm, and then springs back, because Steve jerks and lashes out blindly, her head wrenching up, her eyes red and frantic and unseeing, a sticky red graze at her temple.
and never get tired of it, but after a bit Steve carefully pats Tony’s back, and they have to go to the classroom soon, so Tony reluctantly lets go, smiling at Steve with pink cheeks and sparkling eyes.
. She doesn’t have striped covers, how awful, really, where have striped covers come from? And hey, what, curtains, her room has blinds, why are there curtains, has someone been renovating while she was asleep, what is this all doing in her room.
Next chapter will contain a Christmas party, and, finally, a first kiss! You can read this first kiss from Steve's POV
Some nerdy stuff: Steve is a Neanderthal (Homo neanderthalensis) in this AU, while Tony is Homo sapiens (modern human). Neanderthals were a highly intelligent species closely related to Homo sapiens, but with their own distinct culture. The two species coexisted in the same geographic regions, and sometimes met and intermarried/interbred. (Apparently, most modern Asians and Europeans have about 2% Neanderthal DNA in their genomes.)
Steve indulges her for a few minutes, petting her back gently as Tony rocks against her. But when Tony starts shuddering and shifting to gain a better angle, her hand wandering shakily downwards, Steve is there to nudge her away from the edge, gentle but firm. ‘Shh,’ she soothes. ‘Easy, sweetheart. Be good for me and don’t touch.’ Her hand comes to press between Tony’s legs again, just cupping and holding so that the pleasure slips away slowly, a soft recession rather than a rough deprival.
