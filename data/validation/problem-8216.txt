“I suppose you are calling to talk to Sergeant Barnes?” He asks then, sounding purposefully innocent. “I apologize, he is not here at the moment.

Maybe it’s the strangeness of it all – or maybe is his tone, the seriousness in it, the dark underlying notes of looming, terrible news hidden beneath short and unassuming words, but they all go quiet despite being relentlessly arguing back and forth for the past who knows how many minutes, and they let him come closer and join their unconscious formation, to close the circle they created across the room, with a sense of

“When you get used to being silent in the barracks,” Steve replies, slowly. “It’s a hard habit to break.”
“No civilians.” Tony says, which is true. Stats first. “No fire, no electrical discharge, but be careful anyway. It sees like the impact isn’t new. It probably… It probably fell when it happened, and no rescue team came ever since.”

Tony hadn’t expected to see him. He though – Well, he didn’t think anything. Maybe that Barton had gone back. Or hidden in one of the rooms. Maybe Natasha’s room. To grieve in silence. Tony would have understood that. Maybe that would be the more reasonable solution, to grieve, and not to… do whatever they are doing here. Not to push, not to volunteer to throw himself back into the fire because he’d prefer to burn than to move on. Tony had assumed, maybe, somewhere in the back of his mind, that Barton had really tapped out. That the farm and the civilian life had finally gotten to him, and he’d refuse to step inside the danger zone again. That he finally had enough. Losing family can do that to a man.

They might even work – the IntelliCrops do work faster and better than most of many agricultural alternatives, genetically modified to stand extremely strenuous conditions, maybe even a mass genocide, Tony isn't sure. Maybe, with the right team of geneticists, Tony could modify to withstand the future conditions. Hell, the right team of geneticist would probably not even need him. God, it would be so much better if he knew where Cho is, if she’s even… if she’s even still around. Tony could sit down and read and learn about it, and do it himself, but he has no

It’s sad, to realize they lost the chance to do this sooner. That he never asked. But then again – Thor had never spoken of this before, either. It’s very sobering to see the consequences of them never truly finding their balance before, the evidence of relationships that never got past that initial layer of intimacy, when the adrenaline of the battlefield had simply tricked them into a sense of camaraderie far more solid than it really was. He hadn’t even noticed.

Pepper opens her mouth to argue, her eyes lit with raging indignation, but before she can speak, Bruce softly interjects:

Then let us discuss a character that encompasses all three, in so many layers of twisted feelings and bad characterization that we will have to literally save him from MCU's clutches, because the only way to make things right is to do so. It won't be easy, and it won't be pleasant. It'll be ugly, and raw, and freaking exhausting. And we're gonna do it anyway, because someone needs to, and it might as well be us.
But this is how Tony works.
Arms raised. Bad aim. Blurry sight.
“He has done it before.” Natasha tells him.
“Is everything okay?” Tony risks asking, because he really can’t decipher the troubled look on Steve’s face.
There is only Tony.

“So you’d know if you still had a chance?” Tony says, in a voice that’s almost an accusation, raw and wounded, with a jagged edge of a plea.
Rocket’s pain, the way it sounds in the rasp of his voice, the… weird, innocent feeling his animal face gives when contorted into sadness, but the clear awareness in his eyes and the force it takes him to even get the words past his sharp teeth; it’s all so recognizable, so
“Tony is only programmed to talk to us. He doesn’t really know Jarvis anymore.”
Nebula brushes a hand on Rocket’s shoulder, a touch so soft it only barely ruffles the fur, and ushers him forward so they both step closer, entering their circle around the gauntlet, all of them staring at it warily.
He doesn’t.

She stands there, with her back turned on him, her arms crossed and stance wide, a pose perfect for a quick attack to the back if she decided to raise her elbow and spin on her heels. Steve makes note of that. Not that he actually believes Natasha will attack him before they start talking; But the fact that she is ready for it if the need arises is not something he can ignore.
Steve can barely manage his own.
Pepper, it's been a pleasure to write your arc. There's so much more I'd like to say but I can't, because I couldn't possibly say them through Tony's eyes - some things, come from Pepper's heart and her heart alone, and no other character would never do them justice. Maybe sometime in the future. And there are
“When Ross’ unit entered the slums, I just ran.” Bruce admits, like it’s shameful. “I ran, and ran, and never looked back. I didn’t even think how it would look. I was just running for my life. And it wasn’t until later that the gunshots started.”
“Well, you know me.”
He thinks about Tony. About the Avengers breaking apart.
Not if he wants to make this right.
Or rather, Rogers keep staring at him, and Tony stares back because Tony doesn’t back down.
“Who are you to talk, Tony?” Clint bellows, and even though Natasha restrains him with a sure grip on his shoulders, it’s not enough to contain the rage that he shoots at Tony with his mere words. “Huh? Who are

No matter how many times it happens. How many times they find themselves in this moment, right here, over and over again; When they realize they’re in a tightrope that neither of them can cross, because they’re both too scared to move to each other’s side, or too stubborn, or too different to see each other’s path. So committed to finding safe ground on their own sides. They hold their hands out but the gap between them is too big, and no matter how hard they reach, even when they brush hands, even when they’re close enough to touch – the instinct to turn around and go back to their safe places is too strong, rooted too deep into both of them to allow them to take the leap.
To this day, Tony dreads it.
It’s hard to see, so hard, because the air is so gray it’s almost black. Dust and dirt fly through the air in visible particles, soot and smoke, a cloud of darkness that floods the senses, a

And what do people care if I pay for everything? I always pay for everything! I pay the Avengers as a group, why are people saying Steve is getting special treatment?”
about this?!”
. “You should ask her.”
“Why are you smiling?” Tony asks, squinting playfully.
The man stares at him with his laser sharp eyes, clearly unbelieving, but he doesn’t contradict Jarvis in any way. He is too playing for the long haul, after all.
Steve feels like he’s balancing on a tightrope, and below him, there is only an abyss. The silence between them has never felt so suffocating.

So Jarvis immediately guesses someone got to those annotations first. And now, he has two problems in his hands.
“I don’t know, Bruce. I don’t know if I have anything else left to give him.”
“No, no, don’t shoot!” He puts his hands in front of the gauntlet, knowing the armor won’t shoot with obstructed sight. “She’s friendly!”
The festivities do not stop when the Captain offers him his hand, and no one halts their drinking or dancing when the man beside them, the man Antonio assumes is the Captain’s right hand, yells to the crowd to announce their leave. The Clan cheers back, raising their cups and stomping loudly on the soil, rattling metal and leather, thunderous joy shaking Antonio to his
What would Steve do, if he did?
Tony pauses. “Yeah.”
Be honest with me for a second: how many people have you seen mention the dust as a major problem in the aftermath of the snap? I've seen people mention the accidents. The food rationing. The riots. The anarchy. But the dust? Not a single person. And that called my attention - because at first, I thought the dust was simply a matter of special effects to make it visually heartbreaking; but then, after they were totally gone, the dust is gone as well, right? Wrong. I went back and rewatched IW just for the sake of this detail, and guess what? The dust doesn't vanish. It seems like it does, because nearly everyone that gets killed by it has their ashes blown by the wind, for dramatic effect.

Tony almost repeats his previous question, when a flash of realization passes through him, instinctive, and he affirms, instead of merely ask: “You recognized his ship. While we were up there.”
He steps closer, and then he realizes that in front of this crowd, talking amongst themselves, are Pepper, Rhodey, Rogers, and two other people. Tony doesn’t get a good look on their faces from where he’s standing, but even before he can try to get a glimpse, he steps close enough to attract attention, and someone in the crowd notices him. And slowly, they all do.
(His shield is in the vault.)

Hunger and lethargy become unimportant immediately. Tony knows they are probably by the lower entrance, one of the only places that are wide enough to accommodate all the people who have come answering Rogers’ call, and it’s no surprise that when the elevator doors open, the sound of many anxious and rapid voices find him in an echo, overwhelming I comparison to the dreadful silence of the previous days, a rush of stimuli Tony was not ready to confront so suddenly after the previous night.

“I don’t know.” Steve admits, solemnly. “But it doesn’t matter. C’mon. We have to find Vision. Bruce said whatever it is, it’s looking for the stone.”
Whenever he thinks about the Raft, Steve’s thoughts immediately go to Wanda. It’s obvious why. The memory of her small frame being swallowed by the straight-jacket, the collar around her neck, like she as an animal; the way her body trembled with fear and exhaustion. Her eyes looked

“I did. Flawed and mad as he was, we could be as odd as day and night, but he was my family, and I will miss him. Every time I thought he was gone, I still missed him as much as I did in the first place. Even with all he has done, his loss always feels like it’s new.” Thor says mournfully, as truthful as Tony expected him to be. “I miss all of them. My mother, my father. Asgard is all the family I have left – and they are still gone… The ones who could escape with Valkyrie when Thanos attacked our ship.”
It exploded in Gulmira. But the seed had already been there.
The world needs the Avengers. But how can the Avengers be, if they can’t stand side by side when the world pushes back at them? If at the slightest pressure, they crumble, falling apart so completely they can’t fit themselves together again?

Pepper leans forward, and lays her head on his shoulder, forehead to his clavicle, and she feels warm, almost unnaturally so, even through the fabric of his shirt. It drags a strong, intense, almost all-consuming emotion from inside him, from beneath the thick layer of grief and sadness that is sinking into his stomach like an anchor, and it comes out of him like an eruption, past his lips in a trembling admittance before he can think twice, before he can control the raw vulnerability in his voice, before anything else.
“If I try to spray water on them I think Rhodey might actually kill me.” Tony admits.
“Then I’ll wait.” Steve declares firmly. “When they’re better, you can give me them. I will read them, when the time comes. But I have read them before, Your Highness, and I don’t think my mind will change no matter how wonderful you make them sound. As long as they won’t let us go home, won’t let us

Pepper watches as he stops there, eyes wide and begging, face surely frantic in its nearly childish desire to avoid this conflict in its entirety – hoping, with all his being, that his reaction will be enough proof to her that he truly means what he’s saying. This is not an elaborate plot to hurt himself, physically or mentally. It’s not. And he’s not doing this recklessly. The very impulse of trying to figure out the Stones before finding Thanos and getting the Gauntlet from him is the very evidence of how much thought he’s putting into this. This is

It’s not fair, to undermine the weight of her decision, to respect her right to ask for distance and to know better what is best for herself – but it’s hard, even for Tony Stark, not to linger in writhing self-pity, just a little, to hurt himself in the deepest way he knows how, because he’s addicted and he’s helpless, because it’s what he always does; and it that makes him ridiculous or pathetic, that’s why he’s here in the first place, isn’t he?

“And he will just let us in the most secure place on Earth, just like that?” Natasha replies, arching her perfectly sculpted brows. “Why did he call?”
It’s the worst part about this. The whole world was screaming at us and we were too busy screaming with each other to find a way out of this mess. And he wasn’t having it, so I thought I might try with you.”

Steve doesn’t have anything to say. He wants to, wants to defend himself and his choice, defend Bucky from their rant, their words that feel so much like an accusation, but his body won’t cooperate. He has no words, no logic, nothing but the dark pit inside his stomach that is growing bigger and deeper with every passing second, a black hole that will trap him forever and he will never escape.

It leaves a bitter taste in his tongue, something sharp and coppery, thick and disgusting between his teeth.

A projection shows up in front of them, from the sensors on the floor next to the bar, where they used to watch the finals when they were all together in the common lounge. Days long gone, now. The blue hue of the screen matches the one in Tony’s chest, bathing the entire room in a soft, candid color, and Nebula gives a step back so she can focus better on the images, standing literally right by Tony’s side as FRIDAY gives the final report.
That’s what he’s hoping for, when he calls Bucky. He doesn’t say it, and he doesn’t ask, but over and over again, its what has happened in the past.

as Tony handed her the 200 dollars tip along with the payment, but how could he not – Steve had been sitting there after eating eight goddamned burgers all by himself, the troglodyte, that’s the least Tony could do for her.
“—But we need to get into a lab, as soon as possible.” He continues after a beat, forcing his voice to be even and louder, to make sure he’s getting the importance of his point across. “If we divide, you can go and start rescuing people right away, and we can start fixing this. We have to do both at the same time.”
“We tried to stop him.” Bruce tells him frantically. “We destroyed the Stone.”

“That he might have put the old Reactor back. Inside his chest.” Steve confesses.

The first week after is marked by an uneasy, almost suffocating silence.

“That is…” Rhodey drags. “Assuming you’re joining us in the fight.”
There’s a huge projection in the far back wall, a blue hologram that FRIDAY projects large enough that it bathes the entire room in its hue, electric and encompassing, brightness sharp and hypnotic before their eyes. It reflects against the light countertops and workstations, the clean, minimalistic design of the almost bare floors and walls, but barely gleaming against the dull metal of the mockup gauntlet that rests on the table; They watch it, transfixed, almost unblinking, as they gather before it like subjects before their deity – in fear and determination, in challenge of its threats, when an image of a familiar glowing cube presents itself right in the middle of the panel, almost like a mockery, the main star presenting itself for the show.

“Want me to take a look at that arm?” Tony easily suggests, the thought not even making itself clear in his head before he’s blurting it out.

And he looks at
“I thought—" He tries, but then stops. He doesn’t know – He doesn’t know what he thought. He thought they could just… That it would be easier. It seemed like it would be. It always did, when there was no immediate threat. Peace always made it look like their concerns were too much, almost baseless. It’s hard, to remember the bad side of things when you have a long, extended period of happiness. He guesses – He guesses they forgot. That they hoped for too much.
“Go on, sit.” Shuri instructs him, gesturing to the bench behind them, made in heavy, dark stone, surrounded by an arch of delicate yellow flowers, vines woven around the tall columns of this gigantic glasshouse. It’s beautiful. The colors are so vibrant they’re almost hypnotizing. “You can wait here. He won’t take long.”
Years and years of longing and impossible dreams of another life, a fantastical, idealistic, maybe even naïve life – those are gone.
Steve can’t imagine what sort of damage he might have caused had he stayed.
“He died because HYDRA was hiding inside our walls and we didn’t know.” Clint sniffs, but there is no sign of tears in his eyes. There is only a fierce, firm conviction, something Steve knows its unbreakable and impossible to change. “So? How do we know we can trust every guy who puts on a mask and a tight suit and calls himself a hero? That’s right, we

He gets up and looks down at himself again, trying to assess his own physical state, what sort of procedure he probably went through and how his recovery is going. He shouldn’t be walking, he knows that much, but since staying here is not an option, he will simply ignore that concern entirely. Other than that, his bandages seem to be in very nice condition, white and clean, and although there is pain, it’s not unbearable. It’s a surprise, considering how ugly the wound was. Far better than he was hoping to feel. They gave him the good stuff, it seems. He has no doubt one of the IV’s he just pulled off his arm contained morphine, even if just a small amount, by the gentle drowsiness enveloping his mind.
In the end—
Always the hardest thing for Steve to do.
Tony’s eyebrows raise almost to his hairline, his face all scrunched in confusion. “And that was all it took?”
“I didn’t mean to hurt him.” Steve reasons.
(Self-righteous.)
“The Tree of Life is what keeps the forces acting together. It’s branches are the paths were the forces flow, and the planets and galaxies are created within them move when they move. When galaxies collide, and when they drift apart – it’s all caused by the Tree’s motions across the universe. Eventually, some of those branches may align, and cause a Convergence, like the one I mentioned this world experienced many years ago. These
It all happens so fast that Tony is still blinking when he realizes Nebula has raised her arms and is
He wonders— He wonders what it is that makes Vision and Wanda so attracted to each other. It doesn’t seem to be physical, so it’s not a matter of clinging to an available partner after the thrill of a fight. If it was, Wanda could’ve been attached to anyone, especially Clint, since he’s the one – the human one, at least – who stays with her the most. Not that it would be right, or that Clint would do anything, but Steve has lived in war and he knows these things happen. Emotions get out of control and people do things they wouldn’t do otherwise. But if it were to happen,
Tony almost feels a little bad with the overwhelming attention that suddenly turns to Thor, all eyes trained on him in the span of a second, watching every move.
He also needs to fix the ship, probably. The Benatar. That thing is not in a very good state. Nebula can probably help, maybe Rocket as well, if he knows the thing well enough. They’ll need it, so they can… go to space. Jesus, the very idea of it makes a shiver run down his spine.
There is something that Steve remembered a while ago.
And he aimed at it.
But bitterness – he learned even younger.

He just had no hard feelings. That’s just how he is, how
Nebula makes that sound again, the one who seems to be a curse, and retreats, exasperated. “Are you always this eager to maim yourself?”
Steve and Natasha give him a look at the same time, and Sam nods to himself.
But no one is arguing. Natasha and Rogers are both adjusting the controls and grabbing the controls, pushing them slowly towards the ground, looking for a place to land that is not completely unstable. They can’t land on any of the roofs, because it seems like there has been an explosion, and the buildings surrounding the plane are all covered in black, sprays of ash and soot across their windows and fronts, a testament to just how strong the explosion caused by the plane must’ve been. One of the nearby buildings has almost an entire chunk of the front missing, probably from something that flew into it from the plane.
Steve had never wanted to hurt Tony. Not on purpose. Not consciously.
“Give them access. Also send up the Mark KO, they might need an extra hand.”
“They aren’t breathing
“Vision figured it out. He said that if we exposed the Stone to something as strong as itself, we could destroy it.” He pauses, heavily. “So he asked Wanda to do it.”
They don’t get it, they don’t understand that getting into the White House and killing – who, the President? The staff? Who – it won’t…
“I can’t control Scott’s decisions.” he immediately replies, uncomfortable with the idea.
like her love and devotion simply can’t be mild and gentle; they are ferocious and vengeful, bitingly loyal, and no one, not Thanos nor herself, will stop her from getting what she wants, getting her sister the justice she deserves; and with Rocket’s hand placed on her arm, Tony finds himself genuinely moved with how strongly it all comes together, the sight of them filling him with the most unexpected awe. “And I hated her and I loved her, and I will never forgive him for what he did.”
And it’s nice, to have someone to ramble at.

“What’s the point of being Hawkeye if I can’t drive in some tough conditions?” Barton smirks, and although it’s stiff and not fully sincere, his eyes are calm and tranquil, almost warm, and Tony suspects this might be something familiar for him in some aspect, something that equals to a relaxing state of mind, or a peaceful memory, or something to find comfort in, in being useful – whatever it is, it’s the most emotion Tony has seen in Barton’s face in days, an emotion that’s not negative, and that, in itself, is reason enough to let him do it.

“Jane helped us create a trap, of sorts, that incapacitated Malekith. She and Erik Selvig helped me in the fight, and when Malekith was dead, the Stone just…” He makes a wavy gesture with his hand. “Escaped from his body. That’s when we gathered a proper place to keep it, a case specifically made to contain powerful objects such as the Aether. And when we secured it, I returned to Asgard, and my friends took the Aether to the Collector, hoping it would be safe.”
He really likes the Academy.
Tony does not blame her for disappearing. He really doesn’t.

Steve turns his head slightly, so he can see Sam from his peripheral vision, hoping to get a glance at his posture. He doesn’t see much. Sam is very consciously trying to transmit a sense of tranquility, a passive neutrality that Steve had never thought that Sam would use with him. It makes him feel awful. How did he reach this point, where he pushed his closest friends away to viciously that they don’t know how to approach him, like he is a frightened animal, who will attack if he feels caged?
Finding balance again in a dynamic who has suffered a massive break is a huge problem. This is an issue I've had not just with Marvel, but with other kinds of media too, the lack of care in showing just how much having trust issues involving

T’Challa frowns deeply, the amusement ebbing away from his posture, giving place to a stilted, careful consideration.

That is all they needed to know.

Maybe she won’t. Not like she has anyone to tell to, anyway. And it’s not like it’s important. Because it’s not. Tony has never told anyone because it’s no big deal. It’s just something he had to do, to make sure the nanotech would work fine, attached to his entire body. It’s not – He’s not in
Rogers stares at him, face neutral, his eyes giving nothing away beyond his needle-sharp focus, patiently waiting as Tony racks his brain for the words. Tony can’t find any. The snapping of seatbelts clicking together never ceases, menial background noise to a moment so tense that it shouldn’t even be able to hold in such a high-pressure situation like this – and they stand there for a moment suspended in time, a tentative moment where neither wants to be the one to break the silence and dare to cause damage their unexpected truce, and Tony feels fearful, cowardly, like he’s on the cusp of surrendering something that he shouldn’t, not to Rogers, not to anyone.

what this ship can do besides fly and shoot stuff, apparently, because he can’t recognize the symbols that make up its main structure, but for now, it is enough. From what he can guess from the graphs on the screen, there is enough fuel – Energy? Not exactly fuel, but not electric force either. Something else, something that lodges itself at the back of his brain for later inspection, even when Tony tells himself he will refuse to think about this day for a very, very long time – to last for a long trip, hopefully long enough until they can reach Earth.
But he heard.
Steve laughs. “Sure thing, Mr. Stark.”

Bruce?
by himself, someone else must have given him the Scepter. Tony had always assumed he had taken it from the Chitauri. But if Thanos had been in control of the Chitauri this entire time,
“Who, Tony?”
(What, Steve?)
No. That's not good. Not if you don't actually kill him. Why? Because there's way too many problems still left unaddressed, problems Tony WILL have to face eventually. He won't die in that spaceship. I know he won't. So giving him too much time to reach that acceptance is too dangerous to consider. If they shove this acceptance down Tony's throat, everything I feared will become true. CW will be ignored. The many instances where Tony has been mistreated will be ignored. There will be no redemption. There will be a fight, a vengeance, and nothing more.
Tony isn’t really thinking anymore. Not for full moments. The nagging pain in his left arm is starting to make itself known, the stress of being alert and deflating, over and over, his heart speeding with adrenaline in so many alternate spikes over such a short span of time a strain too great for his battered body. He digs his fingers into his eyes, wishing he could just wipe away the exhaustion and strain off them, wishing he could go to sleep and let this all be a nightmare.
“He can do that?” Wanda asks, arching her eyebrows.
When did it start being all about dismantling agendas and suspecting everyone? When did this paradox of trust and skepticism nested itself inside of him, and how the hell had he never realized it?
“It’s not a lie.” Steve’s head snaps back in Sam’s direction, his gaze hard and pained. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
“By the time he got to Titan, he had already taken her.” Nebula replies, her ragged, slightly robotic voice even more frazzled by the sheer weight of the grief it carries.
“I know.” Bruce hums. “But maybe, if you’d tone it down a little, people wouldn’t notice it as much.”
He wonders if Thor lost anybody.
(She thinks about a screen going black, and never lighting up again.)
Steve makes a face so dark and stormy that Tony, for a second, thinks he’s going to be punched in the face. He can’t even step back because he’s just so surprised with how
“Pepper, honey.” Tony whispers into her hair, sweet nothings laced with despair, feeling himself shake in her arms so intensely he knows he’s moving her, but her hands go around his torso and settle against his back and they are shaking as well, her nails digging into skin, holding as tight as she can.
Not any more reason he has to believe
(And now—)
(I tried to warn you.)
“Reality.” Rocket remembers. “That’s when we found Thor after his ship sent out a distress call. He said Thanos couldn’t get the other Stones first, and the Reality was closer, so the others went to Knowhere to get it while Thor and we headed to Nidavellir, to get him a weapon.”
“Tony won’t pick it up.” He says through gritted teeth, like the words are being dragged out of him, burning up in his throat like acid.
“Someone is going to burn the White House.”
“Seriously, you need to stop, you make that sound like a threat and I have no idea how you do that. I’m not comfortable with it.”
“Space.” Tony says, and it’s a shitty answer, but he doesn’t think the more accurate one would make any difference. “I was – I was trying to keep the aliens from grabbing what they wanted.”
Maybe she already has.
To the armors, to cars, to wires.
(Remember this.)
“In exchange for the Time Stone.” Tony reminds her.
Steve has thought, over and over again, that Vision might not be able to fully grasp human emotions yet, and he probably believes that his motivation to break the Accords and meet with them has only to do with Scott’s status in the US; but Steve
Tony makes a pause, surprised, both at her tone and at his own lack of worry or discomfort. “Not… right now.”
(Please, don’t do this now.)
when she arrived at the CIA, despite the fact the Black Panther could defend himself very well, it had seemed. “D’you think they would stop the Queen from getting our calls for any reason?”
It’s big. Tony doesn’t half-ass things.  It’s very plain right now, but he thought it would be too creepy if he decorated the rooms in addition of giving them entertainment areas. Rooms are more… personal, or something. And maybe Cap would like to decorate it with his old stuff, whatever he managed to get back from old vaults or museums. Best to let him be.
For all the conflict they had over the years, Tony has never felt so distant from them before.
(Tony believes in heroes.)
“And we should be thinking fast, we’re closing in soon.” Rhodey calls over his shoulder, curt and loud. “We have fifteen minutes. We’re gonna go lower so we can see what’s happening, so hold on, we might have some trouble with the route, we could hit something.”
Isn’t it the perfect eulogy for it all?
Oh, he’s rambling. Rhodey knows something’s up when he rambles.

If he ever did in the first place.
“Sorry if it’s a bit… overwhelming, or something, but I figured it’s better to have a bigger space, you know? You can decorate it, if you want. Barton sure will, he already said so.”
Away from this place — and that is all that matters.
He is wrong.

Everything.
He steps out, eventually. He’s not sure when. He’s not sure knowing will make him feel better. Distantly, like it’s an old echo, one whose owner is long gone and now it’s just empty words sounding against damp walls, there’s a voice. A voice that feels like a knife.
He’s used to feel her pressed against him like this after they’ve had sex. They don’t usually sleep in this position, because Tony got used to laying on his side to be able to sleep, the press of the case of the Reactor too heavy and too constricting for him to fall asleep on his back. To this day, it’s rare that he can sleep in any other position. The exhaustion really did him in, he realizes. She slotted herself against him in the very position she found him in, like she always did – and it’s very telling of how tired he was, that he didn’t turn during the night and he didn’t wake up at all as she settled against him.
“I know. And I care about you too.”
And she does – and the screen lights up with to different projections of the globe, one from days ago, and one rendered from the information she can obtain in real time.
It sounds like a good enough plan, except—
The stares of the others at Tony’s back feel like goddamn lasers, searing hot at his skin.
So let's bring them to the game. And it's all downhill from here.

Steve knows he is being analyzed, but he doesn’t cower under the king’s careful gaze. Steve did not flinch under Queen Ramonda’s silent judgment, he won’t back down for T’Challa either, even if the man is a king. He can think whatever he likes.

“It is a group effort.” Vision says as an explanation, and the words sound like something he heard someone else say and he’s just repeating them, per request. “We unfortunately are lacking evidence to have the Secretary removed from his position at the moment, but with the lack of previous involvement with the Avengers and the combined defense with the Stark Industries legal team, Mr. Lang’s case is quite out of reach for Secretary Ross.”
Clint nods curtly, muttering an affirmative, but then he makes a quick pause and huffs out a hollow laugh, and says “I don’t think that’s not going to be a problem.” And with another look over to the side, a small smirk appears on his face, his eyes gleaming with an exasperated, confused mirth. “He doesn’t seem to be going anywhere soon.”
“That was in…” Rhodey prompts.
His neck hurts like hell and his torso feels like it’s stuffed with cotton balls, full of a weird, swollen sensation, and his eyes feel like they’re almost taped shut with the amount of effort he has to make to open them.
He’s starting to realize he has a lot of those.

“Stark, calm down.” Nebula orders, pushing him back down by his shoulder and hip, trying to stop Tony from rolling over the edge of the bed as he intends to. “You’ll open your stitches. Stop it!”
“What?” He croaks. “What do you mean?”
Tony struggles to process this information, when he realizes how much he’s actually lacking from the previous days. They really didn’t – they didn’t talk at all, did they? Tony has no idea what happened to them, and they have no idea what happened to him. Thor – Thor saw Thanos
“Miss Potts and Colonel Rhodes are alive, Boss.”
The glow on the chest plate, though, is what Tony can’t stop staring at.
“Possibly.” Bruce agrees. “Most metals don’t have stable isotopes that allow them to be useful after being blasted with radiation. Not without safety equipment, at least. Much less to make a weapon to hold with your hands.”
“I – I am.” Bruce stutters, like he’s choking on something. “I am. I’m not – I’m not gonna sit here while you guys risk your lives out there. This is my responsibility as much as it’s yours. We have to do this together.”
It’s that… God. It’s just that it’s…
“I’m sorry.” Nebula mumbles, and Tony can hear the way it
“Yes.” Steve assures him. “T’Challa’s sister, Shuri, was the one taking care of him. They helped him fight off the triggers.”
The workshop door opens, and when Tony turns, Steve is there.
to reply – and that, he swears, is the only reason why he doesn’t completely quit when Thor, in a soft, almost too innocent voice, says:

Tony knows that whatever words he could offer for the guy would probably fall on deaf ears anyway.

“—The sun is not breaching the troposphere as it should. The decrease in sun incidence should affect the remaining vegetation and animal life, as well as—"
His mouth clicks shut so hard it’s a surprise he doesn’t wince, jaw locking up and shoulders squaring up, eyes boring into Steve so intensely it’s almost like they could burn holes through him, like the repulsors in his armor. He’s bare and vulnerable, just in a T-shirt and what looks like dark gray tracksuit pants, eyes sunken in with exhaustion and unkempt appearance, a frenzied, restless look he knows matches their own after so many hours without sleep, but somehow, this is the most guarded Steve has ever seen him. He looks like—

They share the Tower and rarely have accidents or dangerous fights with each other instead of villains, which he feels like it’s definitely a point in their favor. A few things are still complicated here and there. Bruce struggles with sharing quarters, for obvious reasons, Thor spends long stretches of time away, and Natasha and Barton can’t simply shed away years and years of keeping secrets so close to their hearts just like that. Even Rogers, Mr. American Dream, is not as loving and fluffy as his perfect blond hair and blue eyes make him seem. The guy has a mean Disappointment glare, colder than the Alps. And it’s
Dum-E does find his way back to them, and, shockingly, he has also done exactly what Nebula has asked him to do. He brings Tony a water bottle, taken from the mini-bar, and the bottle is still intact except for a tiny indentation from Dum-E’s a little too tight grip. Tony doesn’t know if the same can be said from the mini-bar – but it probably can’t – but he doesn’t mind. He takes the bottle with a slight, faint smile at the corner of his lips, an emotion frail and humble, something bittersweet; and he says
“What’s going on?” Tony insists.
a civilian.” Scott makes a worried sound, something that almost sounds like a whimper. “I was worried they were going to charge me for terrorism, you know? It’s not good. Technically they couldn’t do it, ‘cause I wasn’t a government employee like you guys, so it would be really hard to justify my presence in Germany as a political attack, but who trusts law these days? I sure don’t.”
Steve is around the workshop a lot these days.
How could he not think the worst. How could he not. He had hoped so desperately, so quietly, every hour after the snap of Thanos’ fingers a burning pit of aching pleas and prayers dying inside his body even before they could reach his tongue, a naïve hope for the best that would lead nowhere; And shame seizing his heart in face of Rhodes’ immensurable grief, his visible and tangible agony over the unknown fate of his best friend, of his
“Before we go, does anyone want to grab a bite?” Tony jokingly says, getting up real,
“Hm, for how many months now?”
“The ashes.” Tony sobs. “They have all turned into ash, and the wind blew them away.”
But Tony doesn’t like that. He really doesn’t. It’s sad, to watch Cap – Steve – look around with a lost gaze, like he’s a puppy who is missing their owner. The guy must be… very lonely. Tony can’t even begin to imagine what it must feel like, to wake up in a world that is totally different than the one you knew. He heard Steve had been adapting well to technology – but he must miss some familiarity, right? The guy deserves some comfort.
But Tony hadn’t treated him right. He got the kid into messes he didn’t need to be in, just because Tony couldn’t leave him alone, and he had been aching for an excuse to get in contact with
He tries not to feel awful about it, but he can’t. He can try to tell himself he’s respecting their wishes, but just like with May Parker, he knows it’s a lame excuse. It’s never going to be easy to be faced with the realization they’ve reached their limits on their capacity to help civilians, because the truth is – they are all living in borrowed time. The familiarity of the emergency, the recognizable visual of a crowd that he could so easily default into thinking “

And then, he stops. His horrified internal rant just… stops. Because Tony suddenly notices he still hasn’t asked one question, the question he fears the most, the one he thinks will probably break him one way or another, no matter what answer he might receive.

They need to be together to survive this.
The absolute exasperation in Rhodey’s voice, the same raw, uncontainable fear Tony feels inside himself – the confusing mix between elation and dread, between relief and painful realization, Tony can hear it in Rhodey’s voice and much as he can feel it in himself, and he can’t help but the way it makes him remember of

it, because his body is not big enough to contain it all.
Suddenly, this doesn’t feel like fighting for their survival anymore. It doesn’t feel like he’s in this room to make this better, to find a way out, all the precedent events and discussion irrelevant face to the reality of what he’s doing, what he’s seeing, like he’s doing it on purpose to tear himself apart from the inside out, for a masochistic game. For a moment, Tony forgets what he’s doing here. He forgets, because all he can focus on is the dreadful feeling of watching his own eyes sweep through the dusty ruins of Titan, watches himself fight, unknowing of the horror that will follow, still believing he could win. Watching himself being naïve once more, to believe and to fail once more, to think himself strong and capable of accomplishing something while he
“But you—”
“Tony is a benefactor, not an owner.” Natasha explains, her tone dry, her expression cloudy. “Cap’s shield is government property. So are your wings. And Clint’s bow, and my Bites, and pretty much everything in the Compound. Everything that was once under SHIELD’s ownership, basically.”
“Willingly.” Thor clarifies. “Isn’t that right? Strange gave the Stone away willingly.”
“Did something happen? Between you two?”
(Because it’s
“Yeah. No one suspects a thing.” Tony confides in a whisper, a little too pleased, and to Steve’s immense delight, takes his hand out of his pocket and reaches for Steve’s own, twining their fingers together. “In fact, I think everyone is just
These have been the longest years of Steve Roger’s life.
“More like the trunk.” Barton complains.
But she surprises him. Instead, she comes up with another option.
It takes less than twenty seconds for Tony to get a little helpful not on his HUD to alert him two other people have been connected to his comm lines, and it’s shocking even to himself how much he wants to sigh in relief knowing he can now hear Natasha’s and Clint’s voices.
Natasha’s lips twist in sorrow.
“They’re here.” Tony breathes, softly, and shudders fragilely, to shatter silently from the inside.
How could Tony know?
“You’re describing your own building as less than a ten-star quality place?” Agent Romanov drawls, sarcasm dripping from her voice, and Steve can’t

He stops, looks up, and blinks. Blinks. Blinks.
Not that the other Bucky wouldn’t be helpful – at first, having two of his best friend walking around was weird, but with some time, Steve got used to it, and came to see them as they really are, two distinct people, separated by time and experience, and that’s okay. He learned how to be fine with it because both of them seemed to be fine with it. But he won’t lie –, they are
He won’t stand here and let himself be fooled twice.
“Take battle to Wakanda, and T’Challa tries to end them away from the rest of the world. Clever.” Tony murmurs to himself, thinking out loud.
“Yeah, about that…” Tony says, awkwardly, but then, he can’t follow through. What would he say? What could he possibly say?
Bucky makes a sad sound, a hopeless, quiet little thing. “Steve…”

Rogers shifts beside him, like he’s uneasy, and Tony’s eyes get drawn to him on instinct, attracted by the movement, and Rogers takes the cue to stare at him again, face smoothing out into a sympathetic expression. “Call Pepper. Get a few hours in. We’ll meet down here tomorrow and pick up from where we stopped, alright?”
“Hum.” Doctor Banner shyly hums, when both Agents and Stark turn to look at him with anticipation. “Yeah, sure? SHIELD didn’t really get me a place to stay, I was supposed to be in the Helicarrier while we looked for the cube and then… I’d go back to Calcutta, I guess.”
“Just got home.” Natasha says, but offers no extra explanation. “And Steve is always up by this hour. He went running.”
is the first word that comes to mind when he thinks about Wanda’s feelings. She is strong, probably stronger than Banner if given the chance to prove herself, but the world has taken a toll on her, the same way it would have taken on him if he’d allowed it, when he was small. He feels, deep in inside him, the need to make sure she’ll be on the right path to make herself stronger. Because they need her. In a world like theirs, they all need their strength, but Steve doesn’t know how to build strength from softness, because he never had to.
Jarvis takes a deep breath and repeats, as evenly as he can. “This is Tony Stark. Howard’s son.”
Either way—
“The Reality Stone is able to create illusions.” Thor offers, a little louder, so they all pay attention to what he’s saying. “Visual illusions, yes, but also in a way that distorts reality itself. A being can give itself a larger, stronger form, one can walk a path where there is none, and it – it always looks for a host.”
It doesn’t have gold, because Pepper always preferred silver. It looks like Tony’s old armors, before he made his current one of nanotech, a model closer to the armor Pepper used when the Mandarin attacked, because it was an armor she would recognize better. Also, Tony would never create for her a suit that functions like his, one that demands implants and it might feel too invasive, when, in an ideal world, she would have never even used it. Because she’s thinner, the armor looks slimmer, and she has less bulk than his own, not focusing on the heavy-hitting force, but speed. The shape of the shoulders and the lines of the torso, flank, and legs is more dynamic that his’ or Rhodey’s large, wide top-half of the suits.

“Why would he do that?” Scott frowns confusedly.
Today is the day. I come with hammers and nails, to seal the fate of two people who, in another universe, could have made this work. That is the sad thing of the multiverse - sometimes, the one you're in is not the happy one. This one isn't. Not for these two. Not because I'm evil, or because I have no other option, but because I get it, and I'm doing it anyway. Tough choices, friends. I hope, that if nothing else, I can make justice to both of them, to who they are as individuals and what they believe in, and the reason why that's exactly the thing that's important; and why I feel like it's a mistake to pretend their relationship never happened because the story would have never been the same without her.

Tony can’t promise that.
“Sounds like he’s afraid of something.” Rhodey offers, echoing Tony’s thoughts perfectly.
He will think about Tony later. He had the suit. He had FRIDAY. He would be fine. Steve couldn’t stay, he had to protect Bucky, had to get him away from Tony, he’ll fix this later. He’ll find a way. But first, he has a mission, and he will complete it before anything else – he owes Bucky that.

It’s an unnerving experience, going out on the helipad when the Compound is empty. The Jet, lit up by the lights of the platform, stands menacing and deceptively safe, even though they will be flying mostly blind; And as its turbines begin to spin, the cutting sound of the motors and the sudden rush of the blow of ice-cold air makes Tony’s ears and lungs hurt, his breath leaving out a wisp of white smoke as he exhales, hands and face immediately burning with the unexpected low temperature of the outdoors.

“The Accords.” Steve whispers, the words strangled and harsh between his teeth, the viscous sensation of poison dribbling down his throat making him choke, his hands itching in an uncomfortable way,
it to be a plea. He doesn’t want Tony to hurt, but he desperately wants it to be true that deep down, maybe somewhere in his heart, Tony still has in him the mercy to give Steve one more shot.
The words hit them like a slap in the face – so suddenly that both Bruce and Rhodey jump in their places, and Tony gasps loudly enough that it nearly drowns the soft
“We trust you.” Natasha says, with no deception or hesitation, and her approval is all Barton needs, and his smile turns a little more sincere at the edges, just a tiny bit. Natasha’s approval also mellows Rogers easily, so when he nods, no one else thinks to raise any objections anymore. Because if she’ll approve it, who is going to contest it? No one. Not when it comes to Barton.
He really isn’t used to having a beard at all. It always took him so long to grow it out he would just shave the whole thing off, even if barefaced he would look even younger than he actually is. Steve scratches his cheek absentmindedly, annoyed, wishing the thing would just grow and reach a point where it would

Now, I have a question for you. A friend of mine mentioned she'd like to see my interpretation of Steve in IW, especially about a... certain statement. You know the one. If you're here for the Stony, you know. As of now, this fic is tagged as Possible Spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War, because it's now up to you to decide if you'd like to see that extra scene here. So let me know! It wouldn't really change my initial plans for this fic, it would just expand a little bit further into the character arc Steve will go through in the Part 2 of this series. If you're not planning to read that, it might be interesting for you, because it'll basically conclude Steve's emotional analysis of all canon content until IW without any further plot to build upon. But if you guys rather have this fic focused only in CW, I can always make a separate one shot to expand on my thoughts about the canon IW content and how it would fit into my Fix-It later on. So drop me a line and tell me what you think.

“I don’t know.” Bruce flails a little, erratic. “It’s not the same now. I lost time. After he came out to fight Ultron, I never came back. Like I was sleeping. For all I know, I had been Hulk for two years when Thor found me.”

Steve, infuriatingly, says:
It’s too late now, he realizes, they’ve already left the Compound. The shield is trapped in the vault, Tony can’t even do anything. In the exact same second, he feels himself be swallowed by guilt, ashamed that his stupid holdups about Rogers would stop him from getting the protection he needs, even at the cost of Tony’s so damned fragile image, his… ridiculously confusing feelings on Rogers.

“But if it wasn’t—”

Steve forces himself to step away from her, but it’s not enough. The air is stifling. His knuckles ache. His eyes sting. “It’s not
“O…kay.” Bruce stretches, hesitantly. “So, where do we go from here?”
“Hello, handsome.” A voice calls from behind him, and he reaches for a gun he stole from one of the guards in reflex, aiming for the chest and with his finger on the trigger. “Come here often?”
Shit,
But he can’t run from it. He tried, but he can’t.
“About what killed him.”
Tony exhales in deep relief, and he whispers a grateful reply, his shoulders slumping a little in response to Thor’s careful nod of recognition.
It’s not!
Ross looks him up and down, as if considering if he should press the issue further, and Tony sits ramrod straight in his chair, spine stiff as metal, refusing to cower under the bastard’s calculating gaze. He has no reason to. Stress, pressure, and guilt - they are Tony’s old friends, and Thaddeus Ross’s judgment is not stinging enough to wound his thick skin, not punishing enough to bruise.
“The same sorcerer that crafted the first Wands of Watoomb. Other artifacts infused with magical energy.”
“What was he reading?” Rogers asks, equally distressed.
When it finally gets to a point where Steve is losing sleep over it, he decides to talk to Bucky.
It sounds like a joke now, that word.
Thor doesn’t much care for Tony’s warnings, or so it seems. Thankfully, he marches towards the side of the property, not the front where people are clinging to the bars like starving animals, but to a corner where he can safely approach the steel structure, sort of. If anyone wanted to take a chance on the opportunity to hit the God of Thunder, even if they were crazy enough, they’d have to be able to leave the crowd and run towards the side, to be able to catch him just as he stands there in front of the fence, considering it thoughtfully for a brief moment of what almost looks like innocent curiosity.

(There’s nothing you can do.)
There’s people going over the fence with the help of others, jumping over and scrambling to a run as if they were quick enough, they wouldn’t be seen, and if Rogers had his shield, with one quick swing and the impossible physics of that thing, he could have taken them out in no time – but since Rogers

Tony had been so angry. He had been so angry, so out of his mind, and he wasn’t thinking, he’d wanted to hurt Bucky, he’d wanted to hurt Steve by hurting Bucky, and Steve couldn’t let him, he was innocent, Steve had already done so much to make sure Bucky would be safe, he couldn’t let Tony just—!

is incredibly bad news.
But before he can attach the cable and literally connect himself to an unknown ship, something makes him stop – a question that flickers in his mind, the old, gravelly voice that’s always at the back of Tony’s head, always whispering things to him, and he freezes millimeters away of possibly making another irreparable mistake.
He makes a pause, to make sure he can continue speaking and Sam is still listening. He is. He is listening quietly, as he promised he would, and even if it’s fickle, Steve feels a rush of gratitude for Sam, for his no-nonsense and incredibly loyal character, even though Steve realizes he isn’t as deserving of it as he once thought he would be.
Sam nods in agreement, but then makes a pause.
“How many?” Tony asks, accepting the change in the subject easily.
Suddenly, without prompting, the sound of a rapidly approaching repulsor blast makes them all turn to the door, and in no more than a second, the 1-R armor comes flying quickly towards them, making almost all of them jump back in alert, surprised.
, because when had Steve become this type of man?
“But what if he did—”
And he’d been glad to do so. Despite everything, he has wanted it, to have a home life with Pepper. A somewhat normal life. He had made peace with it.
“You gonna talk or do I have to drag it out of you?” Sam insists, stepping forward to stand right behind Steve, in a way that Steve cannot continue fighting unless he wants to shove his elbow in Sam’s face.
It's finally time. Bucky and Siberia, in full color and sound-surround. Or, you know, in grotesquely long description and purposefully painful language. Same thing.

But then he stops. He turns around, grabs his coffee, and only then realizes it’s gone cold, like Steve had moments before. He had completely forgotten it, Steve realizes. So unlike him.

All of this, all this suffering… It’s caused by the two of them. Not the Accords, not Bucky.

Before Tony can make any sense of what Rocket’s saying, Nebula’s voice, muffled by her distance, comes on, and she says nonchalantly:
“Well, it clearly didn’t work out, did it?” Rhodey snaps, irritable – and Tony can see his nerves fraying at the edges by his posture, by the strong lines of his veins in his forearms, tight as he crosses them over his chest, a gesture that is so obviously an attempt to protect himself that it makes a hot, stinging desperation to

And no one knew. No one was looking. All it all became fucked up and SHIELD broke and— Do you have any idea how many people were compromised because of that?”
“As I said.” Tony gives a light shrug, pressing his lips into a hard line for a brief second. It makes his jaw tighten, and all his gums hurt when he does so, all the way up to the insides of his skull. “Not much I can do. But I can fix that arm.”

is that we’re arguing about things that don’t matter when we should be going over what we have already! We have a lot!”

“How are

“He can.” Howard sighs, impatiently. He has to go back to the contracts, Obie is expecting them by this afternoon, and the meeting can’t be rescheduled. What difference would it make? If it made her happy, might as well put it in the system.
Tony beats himself up for it the entire flight home. Not a second to breathe. It consumes him as soon as he steps out of the White House and he feels the cold wind hit his face with the same blunt impact of a baseball bat, freezing bite against his hot, sweaty skin, air so dry his throat scratches and heaves when he makes the mistake of gasping in too large of a breath; the silence in the Square is not a relief, it’s oppressing, the light drizzle of rain that still falls from the pitch-black sky is needle-thin, with barely any weight to it, almost like a kiss, but the
“So, he’s not?”
Pepper is no longer in bed with him when he wakes up. Her side of the bed is cold. He feels her absence with a pang of bitterness, a bad taste at the bad of his tongue, a terrible sensation together with the dryness of his mouth. He hasn’t rested at all. To wake up alone after Pepper’s whispers in the night before, after feeling the sharp claws of grief maiming him from the inside, threatening to shatter him, he feels like he doesn’t belong in his own body. With the chaos that raged inside him when it was dark – when he wakes up and the cold sunlight seeps in through the glass, silent, almost kind in its softness, it all feels like an illusion. A stranger living in his skin. The ache in his chest throbs in a distant, muffled beat, almost familiar, with the soreness of his muscles, the haze of dread clouding his thoughts, with the taste of salt in his mouth.
That letter was a mistake. Steve
It’s futile, to beg for reassurance. He knows. No one has no idea what’s gonna happen.

He kind of wants to ask what they’re doing here, but at the same time, he’d rather just assume they’re here to continue with their research and just… never talk about the others again. That would be great, he feels like. Probably a mess if anyone else decides to join them at any point – but they probably won’t, Tony reminds himself – but that’s fine. Rhodey is probably the only one who will eventually make his way down to the shop; And it’s

It’s just hard to believe.

. On the field.
And now, they are both in too deep in this to simply step away.
Pepper looks at him with her eyes glossy, a little wet, as if some emotion is bubbling inside her low and constant, verging on overwhelming, threatening to spill over at any time, and she’s keeping it down by sheer will. Her hold on his hand turns soft and caring, but her fingers are cold and clammy. In the crease of her brows, Tony sees the worry and the pain she’s hiding behind the small smile that pulls at the corner of her lips, the familiar strength of masking her sorrow with efficiency and a comforting posture, with the instinct of making herself strong to endure whatever hardship is threatening to push her down.
Scott won’t be going back to the Raft. Scott is— well, he’s not
Steve knows Scott won’t even mention Bucky, not if he can help it, because bringing the Winter Soldier issue to the table would be much worse for all parties involved. Steve doesn’t know Scott all that well, but he knows he is no idiot, and he’s probably aware of the fact that playing the ignorance card is the safest bet he has to get out of a very heavy sentence. He is the one with less understanding of the entire debacle involving Bucky, him and Clint both, and the probability of his sticking a foot up his mouth if he tries to use that information as a bargaining chip is way too high for him to risk it.
And how will they haunt him when they come into the light, casting shadows over his own, drowning him in darkness?
Thor and Tony look at each other for a moment, a stretch of silence that feels oddly… honest, despite no words being said, only the weight of the truth between them more than enough to fill the workshop in a sentiment much warmer than Tony thought himself capable of feeling in this morning, when slowly, the conversation starts to catch up to him past his first initial shock, and he can manage to shake himself out of his stupor long enough to say:

Howard steps aside, going around her to reach for the keyboard, and she watches carefully while the presses a few keys in a quick pace, faster than she could ever type. It’s a password of some sort. The system name disappears in a flicker, and in its place there’s suddenly a textbox, right at the bottom of the screen, and Howards beacons her closer with a gesture of his hand over his shoulder.

“Even Vision knew.” Rogers adds, his gaze lost in the distance. “Even if they weren’t the same.”

Rogers damn nearly startles, stepping back just a fraction, as if he’s surprised by Tony’s reaction. He blinks, once, and almost immediately his whole body goes stiff as marble again, and his voice comes out strained when he says:

, he said.
“Hey.” Tony calls softly, bringing his head closer to hers, because his heart aches when he sees her like this, and he can’t simply sit by and watch as her expression shifts into agony.
So stretchy armor it is! It’s harder than it looks like, actually, to find the perfect ration between hardness and flexibility, and as much money Tony has, he thinks it would be best if he could find a way to make it last longer, even with the constant strain of extending and shrinking of fabric, instead of replacing the damn thing every month. That is gonna take a little while.
“Doesn’t that make it more dangerous?” Barton wonders.
more complicated, wasn’t it?
And tenses again immediately.
(Options.)
They share another look, and Tony starts to feel distinctly out of place in his own workshop.
The world is quiet. Too quiet.

“Mr. Stark allowed me to use an amplifier to search an area much wider than I was originally capable of. It is the same technology used to trace the signature of the Infinity Stones, so only Mr. Stark has the access and the capacity to reproduce it. That’s all. You are still safe.”
“And then?” He presses.
“There’s a few bases we need to cover.” Pepper adds, in a quick and efficient commentary, a swift addition that reminds Tony of the way she handles a boardroom. “Find civilians, organize them in teams, look for survivors in accident sites. Distribution of food. Gather a med team and create a basic rescue plan.”
“We can’t let you—”
Overwhelming.
And Tony hates that he’s upset about it. He hates it, because why the fuck should he care about what Barton thinks?

Steve raises his gaze, feeling vulnerable in a very confusing way, and finds Sam’s eyes locked on him, assessing and careful. Steve suddenly realizes he’s been sitting silently for a while now, acting jittery out of nowhere, and Sam is probably wondering why he’s doing this, because he surely has never seen him like this before.
“No, I didn’t! Better yet, I

“Steve…” She breathes shakily. “Oh my God, Steve.”
“Yeah.” Steve gulps, forcing the memory of Bucky’s broken expression back to the corner of his mind as it surges uninvited. “T’Challa’s sister, princess Shuri, offered him to go back under while she worked on… erasing the HYDRA triggers from his mind.”
A kid that he wouldn’t dare to call his own out loud, but in the most guarded depths of his heart—

Tony finds himself shocked by the question, by the bluntness and complete honesty of it, the eagerness he finds in both Rocket’s and Nebula’s eyes, and for a second, he

this is her fault. It’s not. Sooner or later, they would’ve come up with something to try and slow us down. People just don’t like people who are stronger than them running free. She made an accident in Nigeria and that’s alright, people cause accidents all the time, even people who are trying to help, so the Accords exiting is not her fault.”
“Not enough not to love her.” Tony says, as kindly as he can, gently approaching to lean against the table Rocket sits at, all of them close together in a small, secretive group, an illusion of safety that seems unnecessary, but also so comforting in the wide emptiness of Tony’s clinical and frigid workshop. “I guess?”
But he would, in this situation. He
The air gets stuck in Tony’s lungs, his entire body dead still and stone cold, suspended in time, like the second before a bomb explodes—
“I always flirt with you! You never flirt back!”
I just want to send a quick message to everyone who left a review in the last chapter, and unfortunately didn't get a reply before this chapter was posted: sorry for the delay, but don't worry! I read your comment, for sure, and I deeply appreciate your support! I'll get back to you all as soon as I can - But I am on vacation right now, so forgive me if it takes a little while!
about this, Goddammit.
She wants to talk about Bucky, but Steve will pay her no mind. He knows she is anxious, that the prospect of Scott having a favorable trial is something she is eagerly waiting for, even though she is very good at hiding it; Because if Scott gets away with what happened in Leipzig, chances are they
“New York.” Tony hazily remembers, after a long, long struggle to think over his haze, trying to keep himself focused, to no avail. But New York seems like the right answer, right? New York is home. Pepper is in New York—
(Safeguards. It’s what you wanted, isn’t it?)
What he doesn’t get is this part. He doesn’t get it. How is signing the Accords taking responsibility? He can see why Natasha signed it. He knows her, probably more than he knows anyone else on the team, even Sam, and he can imagine what was her logic when she picked up that pen and put down her name. Natasha is adaptable. She can thrive no matter how terrible her circumstances are. Accords or no Accords, Natasha would have found a way to succeed, as efficiently as possible, with the least damage and maximum speed. She would’ve played the Accords like a child plays with her toys. She would have reaped all the benefits she could, and she would have dodged all restraints and idiotic rules like ballerina, so elegantly and neatly no one would even realize she’d done it. But she’s one of a kind. Nobody else had her skill or her ability, so she couldn’t expect anyone else to follow the same line of thought as she did.
Dear God, Tony had forgotten—
(He understands.)
“It’s disappointing, Rogers, I have to admit.” Natasha throws her hair off her face with a quick gesture of her neck, trying to hide her face from Steve by looking forward again, but Steve can still hear the almost inaudible sniffle she makes anyway. “I don’t like being wrong.”
this would happen someday, even if no one would believe him. He’d always known.
“Shut up, I’m allowed to admit that, aren’t we sharin’ our feelings here? You said you wouldn’t make me do this by myself!” Rocket exclaims, accusatory.
“Do you think you can convince her?” Tony asks Rogers, and despite all the warnings this idea should have triggered in his brain, deep down, he still knows with dead certainty that Steve is probably just as convincing, just as persuasive as Tony can remember, despite whatever might have changed in their time apart.
Bucky wouldn’t want that. So Steve would be back, and as soon as he was, they would go, together, as he promised.
“You have Quill’s ship?!” Rocket exclaims. “Hey, it’s not
Dammit. Tony really is an idiot.
This is his choice.

It’s no surprise Barton is the first one to break and to attack Tony. They never were in the same page, not once, not since Ultron.

Nebula scowls, a little less aggressively than Tony would expect, but it’s still a scowl. “And leave me alone to fly this ship to Terra?”
“My vision became true, Stark. I saw Asgard fall, both in dream and reality, and I was to blame, I saw Vision before he was created, I saw Stones we didn’t even know existed until that day.” Thor says, refusing to be persuaded. “It was more than a nightmare meant to wound. It was a

Tony nods, as the others straighten themselves up immediately in interest. “Vision was made of Vibranium and he stood the use of the Mind Stone for years. We know it’s capable of holding the power of one of them, but it might not be able to hold
But this is Bruce.
“Knowing what kinds of fun toys Thundercat was using, I don’t doubt it.” Tony extends his hand. “Hand it over.”

The idea of whatever Pepper had seen is so terrible that it only compares to his worst nightmares.

“Are you gonna tell me what was that?”
No. No, he won’t do it.
“I didn’t know how to tell you.” Steve admits, and it’s painful to do so. It feels like pulling teeth. Steve doesn’t really know how to be vulnerable; He has spent most of his life making sure no one would ever see him when he is. Exposing himself, putting his feelings on the line for the judgment and scrutiny of others, even of his friends, is something he still hasn’t learned how to do.
“Not sure if this is the best way to keep track of everything, that’s all.” Sam shrugs, picking up the conversation, and Steve realizes he kind of tuned out on him for a second. “It’s not fair to Nat, you know? I feel kind of bad for her, because she’s the one responsible for bringing us intel. I feel like a freeloader and I don’t like it.”
He feels frozen in place. He can’t look away from Natasha. He can’t look away from her the same way he couldn’t look away from the explosion in Lagos, when the dread and the horror made the ground beneath him disappear and all of his thoughts dissolve into smoke. The terror of realizing that he has just destroyed something, something he was trying to protect, and it is his

“But didn’t we just consider that they all might have the same components? Doesn’t that mean the others might have some sentience too?” Bruce counters, hunching his shoulders.
Rhodey hums, totally unimpressed, nodding unconvincingly on the video feed. “She said something about you spending all day with Captain America and not signing the paperwork for weeks.”
Steve doesn’t rise to the bait. Vision seems to get the clue.

“Also a huge amount of energy.” Bruce adds.
“Where is he?” is the very first thing he says when he strides into the cheap apartment, after a sweep over the perimeter of the building that seemed to last forever, finding Clint sitting by the tiny sofa across the room with his eyes lost to a distant point in the horizon.

Bruce stays silent for a long time.
His goatee is a mess, unkept and dirty, with a disgusting shine to it as his face turned more and more greasy as the days went by and he never showered. There’s still a faint tinge of red in his lips and teeth, his left cheek is swollen, and he has dried blood on his temples.

that it locks him still, and Tony can only watch.
Tony can’t do much more than to stare at him, brows pinched in confusion, bracing himself against the worktop, fingers cold.
His chest seizes—
Tony doesn’t react. He just stares at Steve, and Steve stares back, because he’s weak, because he’s a fool, and he’s been reduced to ache for any crumbs of attention Tony Stark might give him, to fruitlessly hope that he somehow will find a chance to make things right again, even though all evidence says otherwise.

He pulls Pepper a little closer just as she takes a step forward of her own, and holds her by the waist and lays his head on her stomach, his grimy forehead against her rumpled white shirt, that’s already ruined by soot and dirt, and he sighs deep and heavy as the warmth of her radiates into his skin gentle and comforting, while the entire world around him feels so
He has loved her so much. He doesn’t deserve her, he never did. She’s incredible, and she’s so… she’s gentle with him, even now. Even still.
They all become speechless.
When they step into the lounge entrance, big glass walls greet him invitingly and spacious, despite the sickly look of the sky outside, the cold light that filters in through the heavy clouds reflecting on the dark floors, and then—

“I just—” He huffs, frustrated. “I want to have one normal afternoon with him! Is that too much to ask?”
He would take Bucky’s place if he could. Steve would’ve taken another seventy years frozen if it meant Bucky didn’t have to be in there.
FRIDAY’s reply is very careful and tentative. “If it is any better, Secretary Ross has been completely silent over the last two days. I have no way of tracking him without your explicit permission, but from public data, he has not been seen by any camera I can access in the last 48 hours.”
