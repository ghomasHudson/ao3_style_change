“Shh,” Steve replied, tone soft. He gripped Tony’s hip with one hand, and used his other to line up the tip of his cock. “You just worry about staying relaxed and open. If I can’t get in, then we’re not doing it at all tonight.”
Tony scoffed. “Yes, I do,” he said, as if it were obvious. He separated Steve’s arms and got close, linked his arms around Steve’s neck. God, Steve was so tall. Tony couldn’t even kiss him like this; he’d need to get on his toes to do it. Steve’s body was a warm brick wall against him, and Tony really wanted his clothes gone, really wanted to get a hand on the blond’s big cock, as he’d wanted for
“I bought it two months ago. Figured this was better for right now,” Steve explained, pulling the door open for him. “Plus, the bike’s pretty loud and it’s late.”
And it was exactly what they did.
A plan. How the hell was he supposed to think of a plan? Every semblance of a plan had just flown out the window. Every goddamn plan in his life seemed to fly away, slip right through his hands,
He let out a little moan, shifted his hips against the mattress. Of course he was hard already, who wouldn’t be? They’d prepped him before Steve shifted, got all the hard work out of the way so they could just get to it. The problem was, Steve got a little distracted like this, a little possessive, spent time having his way with Tony before fucking him, and Tony had no choice but to stay along for the ride, take what was given to him.
“Uh…uh…“
“Even though our Honeymoon has been interrupted about twenty times?” Steve asked, amused. He shuddered a little under Tony’s deft fingers.
He was close, so damn close. Every inch of him felt tensed, anxious for it, ready to jump. Thankfully, Tony was merciful today, didn’t plan on teasing him. He’d done it sometimes, brought him to the edge and stopped, kept him there struggling, aching for it, over and over, until Steve couldn’t take it anymore. Steve had done the same to him too of course, and sometimes they pushed each other, made a competition out of it.
, setting a rough, punishing pace that pummeled Tony’s prostate, had him squirming and moaning uncontrollably in a matter of seconds. Steve wasn’t far behind.
“You and me,” the brunet agreed.
Rhodey squeezed his shoulder. “Tony—“
Tony stared after him a moment, couldn’t believe his luck, and then practically jumped into action, followed Steve out the door.
He could smell his scent halfway down the hall already, beautiful and warm vanilla and whiskey, mouthwatering and comforting like no scent Steve had ever encountered, and that, alongside the words he was hearing, the secret Tony was sharing with none other than
He gently stroked the tufts of hair at the nape of his partner’s neck, and stepped towards the tree. “Just pick as many as you can. I’ll handle the ones higher up.”
“Oh I
Steve asked.
“Hey, you see him, honey? That’s your daddy,” Tony explained softly. “He’s handsome, isn’t he? Your momma knows how to pick them.”
Steve rolled his eyes, let out a little sigh. “Just help me up,” he replied, and Tony did.
Sam nodded in agreement, looking equal parts relieved and despondent. “It’s time to go home.”
. If he leaned back instead of leaning forward, he didn’t doubt he’d be able to feel his mate’s cock in him, pressing against his belly, big enough to
“Have you checked out the tracker yet?” he asked.
, belonged to him, not his shitty father, the man Steve once considered a friend and now considered an unfortunate acquaintance. He thought about ignoring Tony’s wishes, giving Howard a taste of his mean right hook, telling him

Three days later, Tony spent half an hour over the toilet, vomiting until his throat was raw, feeling lightheaded. His neck was burning and body flushed with a feverish ache.
important to me.”
where Steve was concerned, because Tony wanted him, needed him, and the brat in him wasn’t going to take no for an answer.
He grimaced, but nodded. “I do. I do, but…if they got a hold of the flip phone, the line might not be secure anymore. Hell, they might be on the doorstep of the Compound now.”
Steve turned his head, pressed a kiss into Tony’s palm. “And what do you plan on doing with me?” he prodded, a suggestive grin slowly growing on his face.
The false contractions eased off for a while, allowed him a few hours’ worth of rest, but came back with a vengeance, or so he thought. They turned out not to be Braxton Hicks this time at all. He just didn’t know it yet, tried to ignore the pain, watched some dumb movie with Pepper and Rhodey to take his mind off of it, and everything else.
Tony was pouring them drinks when Steve made his appearance, and he smiled softly. “You clean up nice,” he commented, but Steve could hear the little waver in his voice. Was he nervous too, or was he still upset?
Tony wanted to do something personal, a little special today to mark the occasion. He’d been looking forward to it a while, went over his plans again and again to make sure they were perfect. He’d spent hours in the kitchen today preparing their meal, cleared his schedule entirely. He planned on dinner, dessert, and despite the playful suggestions of his teammates, something a little more wholesome than sexual. He’d been a little nervous about it, initially. Every day he still woke up thinking that Steve would have enough of him, would want to call it quits, but that hadn’t happened yet.
“That’s it, that’s it, come on, Tony! Keep going, keep pushing, you’re so close!” she said, and there was excitement in her tone, and he knew she wasn’t just saying it to placate him.
“And?” Rhodey prodded. “Any one sticking out more than the others?”
[Come on, please answer me. Just call me and let’s talk.]
He missed the city. He hadn’t been living there anymore when he left, and he was comfortable in the Compound upstate, but he couldn’t help but reflect on those early days, when he and Tony first built something together, when they truly fell in love. He thought about standing on the penthouse balcony of Stark Tower at night, his arm wrapped around Tony’s shoulder, taking in the view.
He turned his finger towards Tony and Rhodey. “The two of you, keep an eye out for correspondence. I’m sure this isn’t the last we’ll be seeing of each other anytime soon.”
to it, to Tony’s attention, and that was kind of encouraging.
“The three of us are the only ones who agreed to all of this without a fuss. We’ve done everything you’ve asked! I gave you a perfectly good tracking algorithm. If something’s wrong with it, either your team fucked it up, or the others caught on to it and hired a guy to reroute their signal, to make them harder to find. Either way, it’s not my fucking problem! I’ve got a baby coming in two weeks. I haven’t left this Compound in
He probably didn’t wait that long, but it felt like a century.
He moaned into the kiss, and Steve growled a little, pleased with the response.
“Thank God for that,” Steve said. “We should probably get cleaned up though. Think you can find your way to the bathroom in the dark?”
Steve took his hand gratefully, brought his other one up to clasp it in thanks. He shook it. “Friends.”
Tony shook his head under his arm, used it to hide his defiant grin. “No.”
That wasn’t entirely out of the ordinary, but right now it was detrimental to his performance and his sanity. He couldn’t stop thinking about it all. So many of his past mistakes already haunted him, and this week he’d given himself more ghosts. God, couldn’t he do anything
“How many are we taking?” Tony asked, glancing down at the basket in his arms. “Feels like we could feed the whole team with pies if we fill this up.”
Steve wasn’t an idiot. He knew what the question meant, what Tony was asking him. Could Steve lie to him? Could be pretend, for propriety’s sake, that his feelings didn’t exist, that he didn’t see Tony as anything more than a friend? Or could he tell the truth? Could he let himself fall to this, let himself have this like he so desperately wanted, the world be damned? Could he risk it?
“Who lives on a farm these days anyway?” he thought, but he’d apparently muttered it out loud instead, because Steve snorted.
“Yeah?” Rhodey replied cautiously, pouring more syrup on his plate.
Could it be helped? Could he be blamed? They’d lubed up well, because neither knew just how long they could keep this going, because they were both so damn stubborn, and they didn’t want Tony getting hurt or anything. As a result, the brunet was silky and hot around him, and although the pleasure ebbed and flowed enough for Steve to pay attention to his work, it wasn’t without difficulty, especially now, when Tony had apparently had enough of waiting for Steve to lose, and was going to try and
“Last month, I think,” he replied, and couldn’t help but move his hips, try to get a little pressure on his aching cock. He was getting a little desperate. “Too long ago.”
He’d fallen for Steve at first sight, really. What were the odds that the guy he’d been following for almost half an hour in the rain was
“Technically these aren’t green anymore, they’re becoming yellow,” the blond replied, flashing him a smile.
“I woke you up,” Tony protested, and Steve felt more than saw him frown.
Steve normally rode a motorcycle, when visiting. Tony had even fixed it up about a month ago, when Steve had managed to accidentally crush one of the handlebars, bent it completely out of shape. Tony thought it was hilarious, and Steve rolled his eyes when the brunet made fun of him, but didn’t stop him, never seemed to stop him when he teased.
Tony’s mouth was shut in a defiant line. He glared down at the floor, despite his heart beating erratically. He felt like a rabbit caught in a trap, the metal inches from snapping his neck. He refused to give in, though, as long as he could.
The brunette took a small breath, lifted a hand and brushed it through her hair. They’d have plenty of time for
God bless Steve Rogers, and his gorgeous ass, and the hideous, embarrassing suit that brought him to Tony.
Some small part of him felt vindicated at the fact the brunet was having a hard time sleeping; he’d gotten them into this mess. His pride, his stupidity was the reason they were in a goddamn tiny guest bed instead of their massive, familiar king. Some tiny part of him thought it was appropriate that Tony’s body was punishing him. But he knew that wasn’t fair. He knew Tony hadn’t meant for any of this to happen, that he would never want to do anything to hurt the team, or the entire world. He’d just made a mistake, that they all, unfortunately, were forced to contend with now.
work this morning, but he also looked happy, at peace in a way, and that peace washed over the brunet too.
He plopped down on Steve’s couch, spread out at first, but then thought better of it, after tonight’s events, and curled up tight, his legs to his chest and his head leaning on the arm rest. The couch was surprisingly comfortable, or maybe Tony was just getting tired. He studied the scrape on his hand, frowned at it as if he could make it disappear with just his hatred.
“So what?” Tony replied, pulling open his door. He turned to raise a brow at Steve.
People wanted a follow up to it and I was planning on writing one anyway so here we are! Hope you enjoy!
Jesus, that was an insane thought, a crazy fantasy. Sometimes Tony couldn’t believe the kind of stuff he thought up, and often wondered if he was some kind of delinquent. Like honestly, did other people think of such absurd things? He couldn’t have been the only horny bastard in the world. He didn’t really mind the title, though, especially where Steve was involved. What was wrong with being young and in love? Nothing at all, if he had any say about it.
“What happened?” he asked.
“I said stand up, and come here,” Tony repeated, voice a little firmer. He didn’t say anything else.
Bucky nodded in return, pulled him into an embrace. Steve seemed to sink into it, exhausted in a way that Bucky had never seen him, even when he was small and sick. He wished he could do more to help, but at present, anything he could do or say may be more of a hindrance than anything. Steve had to figure this out for himself, just as Bucky had to figure himself out, his place in the world.
Eventually, Tony led him to the sideboard on the back wall opposite of the couch. There was plenty of room there, and when Steve’s eyes fell on what he assumed was his gift, he started to understand.
Tony took his time with it today, bobbing his head, taking Steve down deep and pulling back, licking up and down his shaft, jerking him off slowly. It was slow-building pleasure, deep and smooth, and Steve could feel his face getting flushed and warm, knit his brows together.
Tony had. They really would be the death of Steve.
That’s right. He wasn’t lonely at the moment, and he
Tony set their beach bags and umbrella down, held out his arms. Steve peeled Peter’s arm from around his neck and carefully passed him over to his mate.
Tony pursed his lips. “If we could just…have another…”
Steve turned to look out the window though when the wind picked up. “It’s bad out there,” he remarked as Tony brushed a hand through his bangs.
, but he was obviously comfortable enough to let Tony’s compliments or suggestions slide, so that had to count for something, right? Tony got kind of bold with it pretty quickly, but not intentionally. It just happened that his feelings for Steve were multiplying exponentially as the days passed, and his flirting went from playful, somewhat teasing, to more earnest, even if the others couldn’t tell the difference. Tony could
The smell of whiskey was heavy on his breath, even at 10 in the morning as he loomed over Tony, his grip painful. “Don’t you
A handful of leaves under Steve’s ankle boots crinkled and crunched as he walked around the car to Tony’s side, stuck the keys in the pocket of his brown leather jacket. “Come on. You said you wanted to get away from the lake house, and you didn’t wanna go to the city. This is a change of scenery,” the blond replied.
Steve didn’t want to move him just yet. He’d wait until Tony was actually asleep, so he could take him to bed. He figured it’d be easier on him than making him stay awake now, getting everything sorted out. Plus, he didn’t quite want to let him go. It was a selfish thought, for sure, but Steve couldn’t help it. He had Tony in his arms for the first time (maybe the last time, the wicked little voice in his head said) and he wanted to savor it, wanted to savor the fact that the brunet was calm and safe, and that he wouldn’t shed anymore tears tonight.
Tony calling him daddy always did something to him, always made him lose control a little, fill him with possessiveness, and this time, after all that had happened today, it really did it. Tony was
He was still angry. He would be for a long time yet, he was sure, but it wasn’t a valid excuse anymore, unfortunately. He was still sick, and he wasn’t gaining as much weight as he should, and the pain was becoming harder to endure, in more ways than one. He wanted it over with. He wanted the war to end, wanted everything to be okay again. He wasn’t sure how easy it would be to make that happen, if he could truly bring himself to commit to the truce, but he had to try. He needed Steve, and Steve needed him, and nothing would change that. He had to learn to live with it.
“I love you,” Tony said, voice low and fond, and earnest.
Peter looked miserable. His eyes were fixed on Tony now, and he sniffled, his lower lip wobbling in a way that brought tears to Tony’s own eyes. He held him closer, rubbed his thumb over the back of the baby’s hand gently, tried to swallow down the lump in his throat. It was too late though; the cup had boiled over once more, and Tony couldn’t stop it from doing so.
, and if Steve liked keeping him, if he wanted to keep him in that way. He thought it’d be really nice, and if he weren’t so damn
A few minutes later, Tony and Steve were spread out on opposite sides of a soft blanket, Peter laying between them, a pillow tucked under his head. They’d taken his hat off, and Tony brushed a hand through his honey-brown curls as he lounged on his side, looking around the familiar garden. Steve was sat across from him, a sketchbook and pencil in hand.
thing Tony needed tonight. He couldn’t go home. He just couldn’t.
That was true enough. From what he could tell, Tony wasn’t showing any signs of getting worse so far (at least not any easily discernable signs) but he wasn’t getting better either. He still looked exhausted, sick, and at this point, it was hard to imagine his scent without the taint of the Bond Sickness.
He barely slept. He needed less sleep than the others to begin with, but now, with all of this on his mind, with the sense of urgency, he had half a mind to trek on ahead, to forgo sleep entirely in favor of travelling. He was a super soldier, and Sam and Natasha weren’t though. They just physically couldn’t keep up with him. He tried to keep it in mind, knew he had to, but couldn’t help but pace, irritated, anxious, whenever they stopped to rest.
aroused, had been for the better part of twenty minutes now, and thought it was high time to do something about it.
Steve was feeling pretty amazing too. “Oh,
Steve got kind of lost, washing up their mugs in the sink. There was a window above the sink which let him peer onto the deserted street below, and he found himself unable to tear his eyes away from it. Nobody was out walking, but the streetlights cut interesting shapes into the pattern of the flagstones, still wet from a rain shower earlier. They made him think of the reflection of the city lights in Manhattan on car windows and shop faces. They made him think of home.
Sam looked exhausted, but calm. He nodded. “Something like that.”
“I’m in over my head, more than I ever thought I could be. I mean, fuck. Steve’s gone, and the team is toast, and I’m…I’m having a baby.” He let out a sound that was a cross between a laugh and a sob. “Me. Can you imagine? When you met me at MIT did you ever think I’d be parent material?”
Tony tried to pull it back, to stop his crying. “I-I’m…Corner of Bedford and—and uh—Avenue J,” he sniffled, brushed his sweater sleeve over his wet face, leaning around the phone console to glimpse the street sign a few feet away from the booth.
“Ouch. Blame Fury, not me,” the blond replied, though he couldn’t deny it. He came away a lot cleaner than most missions, and his suit wasn’t even scratched up, but hard work would always be hard work. He cursed himself for
Who had tried to touch him,
Tony lost his train of thought.
Rhodey didn’t have to wonder if this whole thing was stressing him out or not. He swallowed hard. “You can either keep waiting or look for yourself, Tones. It’s up to you.”
Tony’s side. Was there news? Nothing substantial, unfortunately. Certainly nothing that could help them at the moment.
“Wha…what…” was all Tony could manage.
Tony couldn’t have what he wanted, what he truly wanted, and it really hurt, and he wanted to forget about it, tonight.
safe, really. Either way, we’re on our guard. If Ross tries to do something, if he dares to come at you, you know I’ll be there in a heartbeat.”
“Kiss me?” Tony asked softly. He wasn’t sure Steve would indulge him right now but he wanted it, needed it.
“That’s what they’ll be expecting,” Nat replied. She frowned; this situation was dismal. “Surveillance will be dialed up to 11 in the nearby towns. We can’t stay anywhere near here, and we shouldn’t try to use a phone. They’ll be tracing satellite calls for sure.”
. The instinct to love him, to protect him, to
Everything outside of this room, outside of the few feet of space between them, ceased to exist.
Tony was having a hard time formulating a response. His mind was racing a mile a minute, stacking scenarios and worst outcomes quicker than he could keep up with. There were about four seconds of silence before his voice worked again. He ended up letting out a cross between a laugh and a sob, and it was like flipping a light switch.
That did it.
Tony grinned when Steve pulled him into his bedroom, and shut the door behind him, a little louder than necessary. Steve was too mad to care.
“You too, pal. And tell me what the kid looks like. I hope, for the sake of the world that he’s got Stark’s brains instead of yours,” Bucky teased, smiling back himself a little, trying to settle Steve down. He still looked, and smelled, distressed.
He loved how much Steve cared, how protective and kind he was. He was a perfect gentleman most of the time, and a little shit the other part of the time, and it was a mixture of personality that kept Tony’s rapt attention, left him excited and pleasantly surprised even after being together so long. His heart still pounded whenever Steve smiled at him a certain way, or found new words to compliment him. Tony didn’t take well to stagnation, and Steve was anything but stagnating. He could be predictable, like anyone, but never ceased to find ways to amaze Tony.
sure when he would hear from Steve again though, and it was making him more than a little anxious, making his stomach turn. It didn’t help that he was alone at the moment. Rhodey had been away since this morning, taking a personal day, because Tony insisted he deserved it, and Vision was out on another tryst with Wanda and wouldn’t return for another three or so days. Tony insisted he’d be okay by himself for a little bit. He’d felt somewhat decent the last two days, a tiny bit less achy, less irritated. He was hoping that meant things were changing for the better, but now he doubted. Now, fear was seeping into his veins, and he had to find a way to stifle it.
, more specifically. That delighted him more than he’d care to admit, and in other circumstances he’d be pretty proud of that fact. But right now, his memory was coming back to him, and he just sort of felt guilty for all that had happened the night before, for needing Steve to rescue him, for intruding on him.
He really loved Tony, bratty behavior and all, but even Steve was reaching his limits tonight. He could feel irritation bubble up underneath his skin, made his suit feel hot and uncomfortable.
It was hard to believe an entire year had passed since they confessed their feelings, since Steve approached him in the kitchen that night and had given him the ultimate gift. He never could’ve foreseen any of this, any of what they had together, the way they grew to know each other, but he was damn glad to have it. They’d become closer than he ever could have anticipated, when they met that day in Germany. Steve became an integral part of his life, and Tony a part of his.
Steve tried to process that, tried to understand. It was a lot to absorb in a few seconds, after everything that had been happening, and he wasn’t sure if he could. He couldn’t identify a single emotion at the moment, all of it mixed around and so complicated and strong that tears of confusion were swimming in his vision and he couldn’t stop them from falling. “W-what— I thought—“
Wanda stared down at the blanket covering her lap, brushed her fingertips over the frayed edges. “I know how you feel,” she said softly. “Ever since losing Pietro, I’ve…I’ve been trying to find myself. I thought I was starting to, living at the Compound.” She paused. “Vision…he helped me.”
Home. It still seemed surreal. After all this time, after all the struggling and suffering, they were being welcomed home, forgiven for their transgressions, all thanks to Tony, the very man they had left behind,
“Oh jesus,
“I am serious,” Steve replied, hoisting Tony up a little higher. It took little effort of course, and he glanced up at the brunet. “Pick some more apples,” he ordered.
A harsh breeze cut across the empty road, bad enough that even Steve grimaced, and Tony’s already miserable face twisted further into a frown.
Tony looked better than Steve was expecting, given all that had happened the night before, and the late hour he’d gone to sleep. He seemed comfortable now, even a little happy, not nearly as small and sad as he had been when Steve brought him home.
Tony wasn’t a religious guy, but if there really was a god, he had clearly blessed Tony with Steve’s divine presence.
There was silence for a moment. Tony glared down at his empty plate, unsure of what else to say. This wasn’t the first time he’d voiced his frustration over the last few months, but it didn’t seem to make him feel better anymore. It just made him feel more conflicted.
to be with her, and that still really hurt, and probably would for a very long time. But he did feel something for Tony, he was sure, if the way his heart beat a little faster with each compliment, each lingering stare or touch from the scientist’s hands were any indication. He wasn’t sure if anything would come of it though, was a little afraid of making the first move, so he had no choice but to wait for Tony to make one.
“You are,” Steve said, but he didn’t seem annoyed.
The blond’s tongue slipped out, licked against the seam of Tony’s lips. Tony noticed he was drooling a little, panting even, and his claws flexed against the sheets, obviously pleased.
Steve nodded in affirmation. “Okay then. I’ll get you a fresh towel. I can also wash your clothes, if you want…”  His cheeks reddened a little then, and his eyes bounced to the side of the couch and back. Whatever he was thinking was getting him flustered, and Tony could feel his smile growing a little, trying to figure out what the blond was going to say next.
Steve got up on his knees, leaned forward and over Tony, planted his hands on either side of the brunet’s head. “Maybe I like eating you out, tasting your slick,” he replied. He leaned low, mouthed at Tony’s bond mark, inhaled his sweet, deep scent, intensified by his obvious arousal. “You taste so sweet, like sugar.”
“I don’t know how,” Tony replied, and he lifted his arms, swung them over Steve’s shoulders.
God, he wanted to marry Steve. Maybe sometime soon.
It was a voice Tony knew as well as his own, a voice that had calmed him in times of strife, whispered declarations of love, argued with him and broken his heart. It was a voice which nothing could have prepared him for hearing again.
[Don’t talk to me today I’m not in the mood.]
He’d only been gone for two hours this morning, but with the way Tony was turned from him, how small he looked curled up on the balcony chair… It was clear as day that something went wrong in his absence.
At least he could breathe a little easier now. The rain had lightened a little too, the raindrops growing quieter, which was a blessing.
Tony reached for his hand then, grabbed his wrist. “Thank you, Steve. Thanks for everything.”
His expression said that he didn’t think there would be anything useful though. If the UN had already failed to identify something, then how much more could Vision logically see? How much had their friends left behind? Where were they headed? And if Vision’s search was in vain, how would they proceed?
“These are yours,” Steve said against his ear, his free hand coming up to curl around Tony’s, holding the box. His touch was so soft, a gentle caress, his long fingers brushing against Tony’s in a way that made the scientist’s otherwise deft hands
“Thor is a freak of nature,” the blond said. “I’m a perfectly normal height. 6’2” isn’t
Jesus, this was difficult.
Steve let out a light laugh, and his face turned a little redder at the praise. Tony thought it was adorable.
Tony played it cool, readjusted his position in his chair.
She nodded enthusiastically.
[Sweetheart, I said I was sorry. Please, let me make it up to you.]

Well. Steve wasn’t one to step down from a challenge, and quite honestly, he was getting sick of the party anyway.
“Of course I’m not sick of you. God, I could never be sick of you,” Steve replied immediately, sensing his trepidation. “Today is so important to me.
He hoped he’d be lucky enough to marry Steve Rogers, spend the rest of his life with him, maybe even start a family. There was nothing he’d like more. They hadn’t really discussed it yet, at least not in detail, because Tony did have his career ambitions and Steve was pursuing a career too, but he hoped it’d be something to mention down the line.
Tony didn’t say anything else, but also didn’t protest when Steve guided him towards the apartment building.
Tony felt oddly like a tourist, looking out the window during the drive, and he felt like a tourist standing in front of their destination too. The lake house was out of the way too, but still close enough to the city that the occasional high rise building and the other commonplace establishments of a city weren’t out of reach. Here, they were practically nonexistent, replaced by small, original homes, some with small yards, picket fences, and others obscured by acres of trees or wide open fields, barn houses and farms. He got the sense that the pace here was a lot different, a lot slower than downstate.
He’d done it before, for him. It wasn’t something that happened too often, only when Tony was in a certain frame of mind. After years of violence and danger, it may have seemed insane to some that Tony could enjoy something like that, but when it was

A grin grows on Tony's face because he knows that Pepper will most definitely do that. That's what he loves about Pepper – she doesn't take any of his bullshit and she calls him out on just about everything he does, and she
The brunet took a second to take in the view, and another second to snap a picture on his phone, before moving into action. Tony approached the couch, bent down a little and brushed a hand through Steve’s hair, and pressed a kiss to his forehead. It didn’t take long for Steve to start stirring, always attuned to the brunet’s touch, his presence.
Steve didn’t hesitate then. Tony knew his limits, had never put himself in danger when they lain together. If Tony wanted it harder, Steve would give it to him harder. He snapped his hips a little more insistently, fucked in tandem with the dildo. Each thrust had Tony keening, his hands twisting in the bed sheets, his body tensing with the pleasure. Every inch of him felt like a live wire, the electricity running through his limbs. He was sensitive, on edge, felt pulled apart and malleable, stretched like putty in Steve’s arms. He was babbling, he knew, couldn’t keep his mouth shut, said whatever came to mind.
Tony nodded a little, taking his words in. The smile left his face for the moment, as he thought about it all, about the world outside of their little bubble, and the problems he’d have to deal with as soon as he left. The fact that he had to leave at all was disheartening. He’d love nothing more than to stay here in Steve’s little apartment forever, hiding.
“What is it, Oh Captain, My Captain?”
Tony let out little gasps, and locked his ankles around Steve’s back, rolled his hips into it a little. “God, yes, yes—
“I’ll get Rhodey,” Pepper replied, instead of answering his question. “He went to grab some food.”
“I….You’re not mad?”
He barely had time to whimper out a warning before the dam broke, and pleasure rushed through him like lightning, and he started shooting hot, thick cum down Tony’s throat.
“Jesus, my god, how are you so
Tony’s head tipped back then, his eyes just a fraction hazier, more unfocused. He felt his face heating up, his stomach swooping. “Steve…” he whispered, a ripple of arousal rushing through him, going straight to his cock, which went from flaccid to hard absurdly quick.
They’d spent the last week and a half here in Albania, nursing Wanda back to health. Thankfully, her wound avoided infection, and was starting to heal up nicely, and they could move on soon. Natasha was looking for leads to chase again, and part of Steve hoped she wouldn’t find any. Part of him wished they would just be done, or that they’d finally get caught.
Steve let out a little rumble that if Tony didn’t know any better, would say was a laugh.
The air seemed to be sucked out of the room. Steve couldn’t have felt smaller if he tried, and the same was said for his companions.
“A huge part,” Steve replied. He scratched his beard. “It feels like…I don’t know who I am anymore. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.”
Either way, he was getting his reward now, because Steve’s hands slid down his bare thighs, one braced behind his knee and the other curled around his length. Steve’s hand was absurdly warm, and big, and Tony couldn’t help but let out a little groan at the first touch against his hot, aching cock.
He read the words, and smiled.
Steve knew the feeling. “But everything’s okay?” he asked.
He tried not to be upset. He knew a thing or two about being busy, about meetings or missions running longer than they should. He’d been late to plans more times than he could count, but for the most part, they were just on normal days, so it didn’t really matter. Today, though...Today was special. He couldn’t be blamed for the sinking feeling in his stomach, for the way his eyes were starting to get misty.
Rhodey’s irritation was palpable, his scent strong and aggressive, flooding the room. His fists were clenched, and Tony locked a hand around his wrist now, tugged on it a little to remind the Alpha to behave. Tony would’ve preferred letting Rhodey go, letting him have his way with Ross, but that wouldn’t end well for anyone. They couldn’t afford to fuck up.
? Just like this? With Tony in his arms, so close, close enough to kiss?
Well tonight they
“For everything that happened, between us. The Accords, Siberia, all…all that time afterwards. I’m so happy now—and I hope you’re happy too, but sometimes I just…I can’t help but think about it all. It haunts me.”
“We need to find a way to communicate with them,” Rhodey said. “If we could figure out how to do that, all of this would be way easier.”
By the time the words were all out he was feeling breathless and embarrassed. He always rambled when he was taken off guard, or when he felt a certain kind of way, and he hated it. More than one person had told him it was a bad habit, that they couldn’t stand it, and so he couldn’t stand it in himself. It was one of his worst qualities he was sure.  The fact that his mouth started running away from him now made him feel even worse, and he started to take swift steps to get around Steve and down the street, his bags clenched in his fists.
“I want to send you to search for them,” Tony told Vision as they discussed the details.
Tony tried not to even entertain that idea. This was Steve he was talking about. The man had survived being frozen in ice for decades. He could survive whatever situation he was in right now, Tony was sure of it.
There wasn’t going on much on Steve’s end either. His girlfriend Peggy had broken up with him six months before, and he’d made his peace with it, but was hard-pressed to find someone else. He’d only been on a few dates, and nothing had come from them. That all changed that day in the rain.
So. Tony was in
“Just look at him,” Tony said softly, nodded his head towards Peter.
“You’re too good to me,” Tony sighed, shaking his head. His heart felt like it was beating a mile a minute. He was sure his face was red by now too. “Honestly, how are you so fucking perfect, and why do you spend your time on me?”
“Come on, big boy, get to work,” Tony said, and he pulled his legs forward a little, lifted his hips off the bed, tried to get Steve back on track.
This just wasn’t the time for it though. Maybe it could be arranged later, way after all of this, because he was sure he’d be sore by the end of the day. He was already getting sore, actually, and that encouraged him to play dirty, because he wanted Steve to lose, to give in to it all and fuck him, so he could take a shower and pass out on the blond’s big bed until dinnertime.
“I would,” he replied breathlessly, didn’t bother to pretend otherwise. “I’d let you.”
The central screen went blank, followed by every other screen in the room. “Behold, Captain, my gift for you,” Ty’s voice boomed. “May all the world see your
“Stop it,” Steve snarled; he was shaking, Tony could feel it. “Why would you do this?”
In October, Tony nods. He flies Steve there himself, follows him off the jet. Steve goes to climb and Tony goes to follow. Steve stops. Tony stops. It’s enough. Tony takes Steve’s hand and leads him home. Back by the sea, Steve asks. What if. Tony says he doesn’t know. Steve swims, trains, stays ready. Sam comes to stay. They go to the local VA. A hurt, angry man laughs hard at Captain America. Steve doesn’t go back. Sam finds him a kind face to talk to. Steve lies.
The fire dies unnoticed. Outside more snow falls, too light to stick despite the season.
Hopefully Ty wouldn’t realize.
Steve keeps his eyes closed, breathing in Tony’s words, breathing out all the sorrow he’d borne since this day, what feels like a lifetime ago. He hears the lakewater lapping at the shore, feels the solid earth below him. Tony sitting near, steady in the sun.
The meeting moved on, but Steve didn’t hear a further word that was said. Stark was staying on in New York, so he would be on Steve’s team. They would have to work together. Stark would have to speak to him. Why on earth would the other man want that? Steve flicked his glance sideways. The ludicrous sunglasses hid a lot, but in truth, Stark looked awful, like he hadn’t slept at all.
Tony opened his eyes reluctantly to find May had appropriated half his sandwich.
They had talked for hours, after. Ideas, plans, hopes. Stepping up, as he always did, Steve had badgered and commanded every one of them to contribute, despite the shock and disappointment that circled just beyond the campfire, and as he always did, the Captain carried them through the long night. Tony hadn’t said much. It was too hard to think, echoes of laughter in his head. Steve hadn’t pushed. He was the only one Steve hadn’t pushed. Instead, Steve had let Tony stay curled quietly against his side; in exchange he’d listened, and he’d mostly kept up, and even said some things towards the end. Throughout the hours he’d also watched the trees, had studied the way the firelight danced against the restless foliage, tossing and turning as if the air itself was a living thing, wild and free.
“Maybe that’s the problem, then,” Rhodey said, sounding smug.
Relief was a tsunami within him, a barrage of hope almost cruel in its intensity, but as Tony drew Steve’s hand to his own mouth and repeated their word against his skin, it was Steve who bowed his head and wept; this fragile lonely Steve, still trying even now to give Tony everything he asked for, still willing to give and give with everything he had left; so brave and strong; his Steve, always.
When they get back to the Tower, Tony tells Steve to get out of his life, forever.
“The big bad guy who’s coming to Earth, uh, Thanos? Mr Stark told me to watch out for him,” Spider-Man explained, his young voice cheerful. He did a double-take at Stark’s unhappy grimace. “Oh wait, should I not have said his name?”
Steve stared at him, and - oh
, now that he was looking. The man Tony knew, the man he now saw before him, they had always been one and the same. Steve Rogers wasn’t the paragon of pure virtue and easy optimism the world liked to see. No, his essence lay in his fierce hope and reckless heart, but above all, in his constant restless
that sounded.
“I’d like to say it’s because you asked me to,” Tony said dully. “But maybe I just couldn’t face the fight, I don’t know.”
She eyed him, then snorted. “Go find him, Tony.”
“Ah, hey Tony, sorry to miss you again. Uh, so, good news, the kid has officially completed the last training protocol, so May is arranging a small dinner as a celebration kind of thing. I think he’d like it if you could be there. Uh, and she’d invited me too, since… Well, I guess you’d say we’re dating now? I know, big surprise but, uh. It’s been pretty great. Ah, so it’d just be the four of us, for dinner, probably at their place. But, uh, May would really like to sit down with you first, I know things were a bit rough when she first found out about Germany but I guess seeing the kid in action, she’s a bit less…”
“Hey, easy,” Tony said, leaning forward. “Easy, Steve, relax.” He was so much closer now, so much clearer, but still out of reach- “We have a plan, okay? Strange is gonna buy us time to make the serum, so you’re going to be just fine,” Tony continued, but Steve could see the tension twisting his mouth, dragging down its corners. As if Tony was trying to convince himself his words held hope, even more than Steve. Which was… infuriating. Steve could handle bad news. Even the worst.
The amused affection in his voice was a familiar balm applied to a long-neglected ache; Steve hadn’t known it was possible to be homesick for a person. Despite everything else about this awful week, Bucky had been restored to him. He may have lost his job, his team, and damaged -
He knew Peter wouldn’t turn seventeen for another month, but… “Happy birthday, kid,” Tony whispered softly. “Karen, you home?” When Peter’s AI confirmed she had been successfully transferred, Tony pushed himself to his feet and rounded the table, May following close at his side.
They slept.
like Steve-
The faceless man sighed. “To earn the power of the Soul Stone, you must give up the life of someone you love.”
“I hope you know I don’t believe what I said,” Steve said. “I was just so angry at you, and- and sad, and when I lost it, I went way too far. What I said yesterday was cruel and untrue, and you didn’t deserve any of it. ”
“Great, I don’t care,” Tony said, already marching off towards the Quinjet. “Oh, and I’m taking my ship back,” he called over his shoulder.
who had put it there, alone, and on purpose.
There was no other way, the wizard had said, and for the first time Tony understood why he’d sounded so
Tony landed heavily beside him, his helmet disappearing as he scanned Steve anxiously head to toe. “Hey, you okay?” the billionaire asked.
“First, you leave,” Tony said. “The house, the state, preferably the continent.”
Steve waits.
Three hours after the first attack, Thanos appeared in New York.
“-can’t wait,” Strange was saying urgently. “Stark, can you immobilize him?”
But the other man had already seized Tony’s face between his hands and now kissed him to gasping before pulling back again, a tight, serious look on his face. “Last call, Tony. You want this?”
Of course, it couldn’t last.
From a safer distance, Tony was again staring at Steve as he never had before. This time, like he’d never seen anything as pathetic. Steve wished he could sink into the floor and disappear, but he waited for the other man to speak, to annihilate him with righteous contempt.
The Doctor looked down at it and shrugged. “Oh, the Favored Bowl of Caelindiel. At one time it was used for scrying, but now it’s just decorative.”
Tony’s voice softens. There are more white roses than any other color. “Love everlasting,” he says.
Tony stared back, oblivious to the tears descending in a slow hopeless slide down his face. “I don’t… I don’t
. Not if he could help it.
He powered down his gauntlet and looked around. “Steve?” he asked. The other man turned towards him, blond and tall and powerful.
Feeling unreasonably depleted by the short flight, Steve was slow to follow. He emerged into significant heat, blinking against an oppressive noon sun. Wherever they were, it was beautiful. Pristine golden sand stretched to meet a sea of such dazzling blue it made the sky look cheap, and Tony was heading towards a small but impressive house nestled amid a stand of trees. Steve could see no other signs of life along the shore. Tony began stripping off his armor as he walked, Steve noting the other man’s slight limp.
Only when Thor returned in a blast of rainbow glory had the balance finally tipped in Earth’s favor. With help from Mantis and Wanda, Spider-Man and the Hulk had finally managed to wrench the Gauntlet from Thanos’ hand. Faced with certain defeat, the Mad Titan had briefly managed to escape his captivity and order his armies into one massive, futile attack. Hoping to avert a massacre, Thor tracked Thanos down on the battlefield and fought him, one on one, the Asgardian king eventually decapitating the Mad Titan in a single stroke. As their commander fell, the alien armies turned tail and fled.
The phrase echoed shamefully in Steve’s ears. “I should never have said those things to you, Tony,” he said quietly. “I’m really sorry.”
Tony stared at him. “…and?”
Out of nowhere, an idea sparked in Steve’s mind. “Actually, yes,” he said. He explained his idea, a bemused Tony listening in; the Stone laughed at him but she agreed, and Steve sighed, satisfied.
Back in the old days, Tony or Clint would’ve stepped up long before this, cracked a joke, lightened the tension, but the billionaire was frowning at the floor, his mind clearly miles away and traveling at maximum warp, and the archer… Well, Steve hadn’t seen him smile since he’d joined them in Wakanda. Now Clint stood glaring at the door as if Thanos himself was waiting on the other side. Steve glanced at Natasha beside him; she too was studying Clint, her gaze cool with professional detachment. The two of them had volunteered for scout duty, their skills being the best suited to finding Thanos and observing him without detection. Natasha caught Steve looking, gave him a curt nod. On top of locating the target, she would also need to keep Clint’s thirst for vengeance in check, so the archer didn’t kill himself doing something stupid. It was her job within the job. Steve understood.
/ɪnfɪlˈtreɪʃ(ə)n/
Tony looked at her steadily. “I need to see him.”
Yet here, gathered in the familiar neutral space of the mess hall, no one on the team felt much like celebrating. The mission to Vormir had shaken them all deeply; finding out Strange had kept Tony alive only so he could die later had improved no one’s faith in their plan. On top of that, Steve’s chances of successfully wielding the Infinity Stones were much slimmer than Thor’s or Nebula’s; despite the cool confidence the super-soldier was projecting, there was no guarantee that his eventual attempt would result in anything but failure. Since their return to Earth yesterday, Tony had convinced the team that they should install only one Infinity Stone at a time on the Gauntlet while gathering all the data they could; the slower process would give Steve the best possible chance of success.
After a moment, Shuri cleared her throat, then looked up at them. “Just to summarize, when you arrived you had two known Earth infections, five unknown alien ones, nine broken ribs, a fractured wrist, a shattered arm, a cracked pelvis, full-body bruising, and significant damage to most muscles and ligaments. Also when you got impaled, you ruptured five internal organs, any one of which would have killed you except you were held together by nanobots long enough for your body to begin healing around them. But that meant they then had to be individually extracted and the organs hand-repaired before I could even begin the accelerated healing process.”
Now, even if that happened to be true, most likely, Steve just wouldn’t want to go there. He’d never shown much interest in anyone but Barnes, after all. And looking back over the past six months, Tony couldn’t spot any major changes in the super-soldier’s behavior towards him; even amid all the cuddles, Steve had seemed as Steve as ever. The cold shoulder routine was most probably a message that Tony had crossed a line on Vormir that Steve was now trying to re-establish. A message that Tony had been trying to accept and show he understood by respecting his distance.
Shuri looked sad. “This is the herb that gives the Black Panther the power to protect our people. Its cultivation took generations, centuries of care. My brother was the last to consume it, during his battle with the usurper known as Killmonger. And my brother will be the last. Killmonger destroyed the garden, the one place on Earth in which the herb could grow. There will be no more.”
, that Hydra
… And being so
“About what?” Tony asked, frowning as if chattering wasn’t his favorite hobby.
No, Tony wanted to say. I carried that damn phone with me for two years and every moment I wanted to smash it. He killed my
“It’s because I wanted you to know,” he said.
But Steve made no further move. “Actually, Tony, you should know… I was about to ask a different question,” he said, voice brutal in its restraint, because there were
The media tycoon threw back his head and laughed, a grotesque sight on the giant screen. “No, my dear Captain, I’m a
Later, much later, Tony was able to piece together the full time-line. How Thor, Loki and the Valkyrie had arrived on Nowhere to find Thanos had gotten there first. How the Mad Titan had fought them, Power and Reality Stones installed on his Gauntlet. How Loki had betrayed Thor once more, this last time for love, handing over the Space Stone in exchange for Thor’s life. How Thor had been forced to watch, helpless, as Thanos had choked his brother to an agonizing death. Only the timely arrival of the Guardians had saved the Valkyrie from suffering the same end. Their intervention had sent Thanos into retreat, but not before he took Gamora prisoner, insisting she pay homage to his success. There, Tony later theorized, he must have gotten word of his disciples’ failed assaults on New York and Wakanda, and decided to handle Earth himself.
The raccoon peered suspiciously at him. “You sure look like you need my help. But why should I believe you?”
Their mission was to destroy all copies of the footage; only then could Tony end the relationship without repercussions. Stone kept his most valuable files on private servers locked in the basement of his mansion. This archive was the target of the primary team, but the media tycoon was both shrewd and resourceful. They had to assume there were further backups off-site. If they could get Friday in, the AI would hopefully identify the location of any backup servers; the secondary team would then head out and eliminate them. In the meantime, once Friday analyzed the original footage, she should be able to track and delete any copies off any online device, thus preventing Stone from retaliating.
ships.
“The pilot mentioned an injury,” the General said instead. She was staring at the hole in his side, the source of the pain Tony kept losing track of, and which turned out to be bleeding again.
,” Steve said, feeling faint, then stopped, confused. He had grabbed Tony by the shoulders. He hadn’t meant to grab Tony by the shoulders. At any rate, in the suit the other man shrugged him off easily and stood. Looking at him again. Glaring.
“Whatever happened to ‘no work, not today’?” he teased with melodramatic air quotes.
“Hey Pete, can you please take pity on an old man, not to mention dolphins everywhere, and slow the heck down,” Tony said, trying not to sound like a total grouch.
Six blazing pillars of light surrounded them, in six familiar shades. The blue light pulsed once, and the nanobots surrounding Tony and Steve retreated, startling them both. Then the orange light flared and Peggy’s form stepped out, her disapproving glare fixed on the Titan who was now restrained mid-step by blue bands of light.
Of course. Last time Tony had been fighting, the adrenaline taking the edge off his injuries. But now the agony is hitting him fresh, his mind unprepared, and Steve feels his breath hitch when he looks up to meet the eyes of the tall man - Strange? actual doctor, Tony had said - and recognizes the open worry there. Danger, the Captain says, and Steve can only agree.
Not wanting to actually fall sleep, Tony opened his eyes slightly, tilted his head to one side. Steve now sat further towards the canyon’s edge, lost in concentration, his profile lit red by the setting sun. Beauty, Tony thought. At that moment, Steve looked over at him and smiled. Art, Tony thought.
Oh, Tony thought.
Next thing Tiberius had grabbed Tony by the shoulders and shook him, hard enough to make his head snap back.
(See the end of the chapter for
what Ty was and I used him anyway, all of this is
After a beat, Steve clasped his wrist and got to his feet heavily; Tony had to support his weight more than he’d expected until the super-soldier stepped free. “What’s going on?”
, he thought.
“Anthony! Babe!” he called, standing as if to catch his attention.
“No, it was awful,” he admitted. “But the relentless physical misery kinda took my mind off things.”
Tony wasn’t sure he knew how to speak of Titan. It all felt too impossibly cataclysmic to fit into normal words. But he nodded, and the super-soldier opposite him snuggled deeper into his pillow, and somehow, in this sideways version of the world, it was safe to think back.
Hardly daring to believe, Tony looked back at Natasha, and she nodded, fire in her eyes.
“Yet here we are. Four out of six,” Tony said. “Not a bad day’s work.”
Broken, wrong, nothing, gone…
Early in the fourth summer, Tony spends an unavoidable week off-world with Nebula. Steve picks movies to fill the time. Not quiet, not happy. Tony wouldn’t approve, but Steve wants a challenge. War movies, fine. Dystopias, no problem. Then Lord of the Rings. He watches through his fingers. After, he digs up his garden, replants everything in different locations. Same lives, new arrangements. Mixed up. Jumbled. True. Tony comes home, and Steve is okay, and he stays okay for months. He’s doing fine. Sam returns, and they go back to the VA, where Steve listens. Different lives, jumbled, true. He comes home and sketches. He goes back and speaks.
Rocket was creeping closer, his eyes wide in fascination. “Restoring Titan must have compounded the original damage. Looks like it’s damn near about to explode.” Inexplicably, the raccoon giggled. “ All the power in the universe, and he couldn’t even risk picking it up. What a shambles.”
But this time it was Steve’s turn to be interrupted, ambushed, because in one swift move, Tony sat up and kissed him. Sunrise, sunlight.
Then Clint was putting his arms around Tony, hugging him tight. And suddenly they all were, even Bucky attempting a careful pat on the man’s head, and Tony was crying but laughing and Steve thought his heart might burst from the growing hope that everything might be okay after all.
He knew he had a choice to make, but for some ridiculous reason he couldn’t quite grasp what his options were. His thoughts kept colliding, spinning off onto useless half-baked tangents. A random memory surfaced. His mother laughing, the year she’d brought him to the sea. He’d been so sick, but they’d both been so happy, that last summer before the reckoning. Before the coughing, and the distance, and the lies….
have a great one, folks.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Sounds good to me, babe.”
The other man winced visibly, another bad sign of his exhaustion. “Uh, yeah. He left again for the Sanctum, but I could call, get him back here?”
. The Accords would take away his ability to help people, so Steve had left the team. Then he needed to protect Bucky, so he’d gone on the run. To get to Siberia in time, he’d had to fight. Taken altogether, everything was a mess, but step by step, it still felt like he’d done the right thing. Even kissing Sharon had felt necessary, in an awkward farewell-and-thank-you sort of way.
“Say it,” the other man ordered.
“Captain Rogers was invaluable in those first days,” Shuri said, walking towards them. “It was chaos out there; nobody understood what had happened. FRIDAY and I could access any system on the planet, but Rogers was a familiar face, one many people still trusted. He calmed them down, got them focused on relief efforts, emergency plans, supply lines. His actions saved thousands if not millions of lives. But it meant he went days without sleep. His body is strong, but not invincible. The stress caught up to him, so he’s resting now.”
And Tony, but that somehow seemed less urgent than-
. I thought you were gonna help us
She breathed in and out, slow. “Then you should.”
The Ancient One smirks. “This is the true nature of time, Captain Rogers. All things are possible, therefore all things are.”
Bucky. Sitting slouched on the floor, relaxed; then standing, eyes narrowing, concern like a hunger.
enough, to sweep every last one of his doubts away.
11:37, Wednesday 4th July 2018
“He asked me to look after you,” May said eventually.
“I wasn’t alone,” Tony said.
For five months, he’d listened.
The archer stared at him, eyes narrow. “Still. Would’ve been nice to have some assistance back when it started raining aliens.”
“Okay,” Tony said. “Okay.”
,” Tony breathed in a low, husky voice; he felt Steve’s whole body shudder in response, but the other man kept himself together long enough to drop one delicate kiss upon Tony’s lips.
Tony kept chattering as Okoye escorted them through the ubiquitous SHIELD-designed maze of identical corridors. Too much chattering, he knew. Yet after a year of working together, he’d learned to tell whether the Wakandan King’s implacable politeness was masking annoyance or amusement. Luckily today T’Challa seemed amused by his babbling, because today Tony couldn’t have shut up if he tried. This planetary defense system, if successful, would go a long way towards alleviating his daily struggle with existential cosmic terror. After today, he might actually be able to sleep.
“It doesn’t matter,” Pepper said, and gave the world’s saddest smile. “You’re not mine.”
But maybe Tony could help him stay safe. “Strange, could you open a portal to the Compound?” he asked, his voice sounding odd in his own ears. The Doctor raised an eyebrow but complied with a lazy wave. “Friday, unlock 17-A.”
“That part was never up to you,” May snapped, her eyes suddenly ablaze. “If you’d never approached him, Tony, if you and he had never met, it would just mean that Peter would have spent the last two years trying to help people on his own, with no back-up, no support. Picture today but with no fancy suit to protect him. Imagine Peter walking out to meet your asteroid alone. How do you think
Someone took the seat opposite him. “Hi, Steve,” she said. He chewed. Swallowed.
. “I know people can be cruel like that, but I couldn’t accept it. Not from you. It made me think I didn’t know you at all. And that… that’s the part that hurt the most.”
“Are you alive?” Steve asked.
Stark opened his mouth, death and ice in his eyes-
A gentle hand took his. “Steve? It was a joke, I was just trying to… are you okay?”
“…hoped,” Thanos wheezed, his eyes drifting closed. “Hoped it was… done.” The Mad Titan panted, opened his eyes. “Stark… You must know… There was no other way.”
Of course, it didn’t work. “Babe, no way, I couldn’t possibly take you away from your friends,” Tiberius said coolly. He glanced over to where Romanoff and Bruce were busily pretending not to watch them. “You and Banner were kinda close before, right? Maybe you should introduce me.”
. You ever consider that maybe the team won’t take you back?”
, he thought, meaning and sense flooding back to him.
“Hate to spoil the party,” she said, “but if I let you boys waste time fighting, there won’t be any universe left worth speaking about.” She smiled down at a wary Gamora, touched her cheek. “Hi, sweetie,” she murmured, her voice sad.
“I do? Uh, sure, yeah. So Tony, this ship can land wherever you want it, or it can stay in orbit and we can take a shuttle to the Tower if that’s better,” Bruce said.
After a subdued breakfast, Steve’s official permission to leave the Compound - a ridiculous limitation Tony was going to
“Hi, Captain Rogers, it’s Doctor Lewis,” he said brightly. “We haven’t actually met before but I work with Doctor Cho, she sent me down to get just a couple more samples from you. Won’t take a minute, if that’s okay?”
, Tony thought. Then he was back on the chair, Strange ordering him to dismiss the suit and breathe slowly as something warm was wrapped around him.
, Rogers?” he hissed, his repulsors flaring to full defensive readiness. “What the
, Steve thought, stunned.
Despite the shocks and turmoil of the day, despite the bone-deep weariness that just lived now at the back of his skull, Tony was actually enjoying himself as they staggered giggling across the open courtyard and kicked open the doors to the mess hall.
He felt May Parker’s arm wrap across his shoulders. “Tony is staying here,” she said; she sounded pretty sure, so Tony believed her.
The Queen frowned but kept her thoughts to herself, instead looking up at the sky, perhaps noticing the lack of evening gloom. Night fell here like it did near the Equator back home; suddenly, with little ceremony, but the comparison ended there. Oh, sure, with the similar atmosphere the stars above twinkled much the same, but the unfamiliar constellations unnerved him, and Tony still felt a deep resistance snarl within him whenever the second moon rose in the sky; as if it was the one trespassing, not he.
Tony was on his feet and heading towards Rocket and Thor before Steve could blink. “Is it the
“Take us back,” he said, and braced for the onslaught.
“If you ring the bell, you can get me kicked out,” May told him, once the last awful falafel was vanquished.
Somehow, he was there, sitting at Tony’s favorite table.
Tony smirked right back at him. “Yours was fun too.”
“One last thing,” Tony told him.
It was a risky plan, even for Rogers. It might even work.
Roused by the thrilling aromas, the rest of the weary fighters scrambled to grab what they could.
“So, to the lab?” Tony looked over, confused. Steve was smirking at him. Oh. Cute.
If not for the cameras, he could have cried. “Bruce, what the absolute fuck,” Tony snapped instead.
Steve stared at him, blue eyes stunned. “But Tony, that’s just not true.”
White.
“Engage protocol seventeen,” Shuri announced, sweeping into the main lab with two Dora Milaje at her back. The young Queen nodded to the others as she stepped up beside Tony. “
For what seemed an eternity, Tony rocked helplessly back and forth, caught in endless waves of misery, the coming loss seeming to swallow up everything good that ever was, that could ever be, leaving only a berserk desperation for the pain to just
His heart lurched, and Steve realized he’d already made his choice.
Tony sank back on the couch, sagging under his growing exhaustion, because, in truth, he wanted to go. Seeing the kid was always an instant mood boost, and it had been months. Any other time, he would have fought to go. But right now, he couldn’t afford the effort.
He stares at her profile. “Bruce said you warned him-”
But Tony had turned away, was trying to hide his face. “Steve… I-I don’t…”
As Sunday wore on, Steve’s fury didn’t dim, but it did retreat to the back of his mind. Doctor Strange came to join him on the roof for a time, which helped. Steve asked endless questions about magic that were probably really stupid, but the Doctor didn’t seem to mind. He wouldn’t talk about the threats he’d alluded to, but he was refreshingly candid about the basics of magical power, explaining how its mastery was not an innate gift born to a lucky few, but a skill anyone could learn. When the Doctor left him to his watch, Steve stared out over the city, his thoughts aglow with all the mysteries of the universe.
“Excuse me, those are Stark modified so therefore our nanobots, and gee, you know, kinda bleeding out at the time…” Joking around felt good, except Rhodey looked kinda sick. Oops.
And Tony reached back.
Then for a while Tony lost the thread of things, the voices above his head blending into strands of meaningless noise. Later he felt himself lifted, strong bodies on either side helping him stumble forward. And then it was quiet, and he was warm, like he was flying through a summer sky, all of his thoughts drifting apart and away, into the clouds.
But kissing Tony… Steve glanced over at the other man.
There was a sickening crack; the tycoon broke off, gagging.
Thanos frowned in clear confusion. “You? But the Stones are bound to my will. How can you disobey me now?”
Wind over rocks, Tony thought. Empty. Then he shook his head, turned to Steve. “I want to go with her,” he whispered.
Steve pulled away then, leaned away and frowned at Tony’s pants. His tiny pout was so adorable that Tony sat up for more kisses but Steve soon pushed him flat again. “I want to look at you,” the other man murmured, and Tony sank back. The air felt cool on his chest after the warmth of Steve’s skin, felt cooler still when Tony ran out of patience and freed himself of his own pants and underwear, kicking them to the floor. Yet Steve still made no move; instead his gaze traveled slowly up and down Tony’s naked body; the awareness of being seen, like
Steve tried to smile back. “Well, I guess I won’t fight you on that one.”
. “I honestly never imagined it would be you, Steve, but I think it’s about six months too late for anyone to object. And at least, if it’s you, I know he won’t be alone, you’ll be right there fighting beside him-”
“Eh, don’t worry about me.”
She tried to smile, a sleeve chasing her last tears. “I know a hopeless mess when I see one.”
Steve hesitated. “Before I took the serum… Erskine said it would only enhance what was already there. Red Skull was monstrous, and became a monster. Bucky said I just grew an outside thick enough to match my idiot insides. But Bruce… I never asked. Where the rage comes from.”
In truth he was scared to bring it up, terrified to rupture whatever fragile new thing they were growing together. And Tony needed him close. All the pressure of saving the world had been placed on the billionaire’s shoulders, so Steve’s job was to protect him from everything happening outside. By unspoken agreement, the lab crew stayed within their bubble, exploring tenuous ways to neutralize the Gauntlet or the Infinity Stones or do something quantum that sounded a lot like time travel to Steve, although he’d learned not to mention that phrase within their earshot. Steve’s team spent their days reaching out to the world, doing everything they could to save as many as possible, but really they were all just waiting around to be saved like everybody else. For Tony to save them. To be fair, his team tried not to ask too many questions of him or the lab crew, but every passing day etched worrying lines onto Tony’s face.
“I- That’s not-” Steve gasped out, “Tony…
“You okay?” he heard Steve ask.
More often, there’d been bad days. Sometimes she couldn’t remember a Steve Rogers at all, blinking at him with kind indifference. He would cut those visits short, unable to bear the necessary pretense, and walk the long miles home, his mind ringing with silence. Those had been the worst days of all. He wondered how those days had felt for Peggy.
wanted you off the team,” Steve said, thrown by the other man’s sudden aggression.
The others were far less open to the idea, Barton scoffing audibly. “Tony, these are manifestations of cosmic forces,” Bruce said carefully. “Who even knows if they
Bucky flashed a wide, sleepy grin, still so familiar. “Bet I’m sorrier.”
“Steve,” Tony said, sharp hands clutching, ragged panic hanging off his words. “
He could see now how well Tony had used Steve’s ridiculous kiss against him, snaring him in a trap worthy of Zemo’s foul designs. And again, Steve had failed to see the danger until too late. Even if he’d never known Tony to stoop so low as this before, Steve had heard enough stories from before Afghanistan. He’d read the reports, the endless scandals. The man he’d considered a friend had seemed above such petty manipulations. Steve had wanted to believe that Tony had changed, blinded by his own faith in people’s essential goodness.
say?” Tony demanded, his dark eyes glittering with desperation.
“If I’d known, I could have done something, Steve,” he said instead. “At the very least, been less of a dick.”
The android was staring at the Infinity Stones scattered on the floor. They lay just as they had fallen when Thanos’ Gauntlet had finally cracked into useless shards of metal, his final act of sabotage too much for the device to withstand. Nebula looked up when Tony joined her, a furrow of confusion on her brow.
In his peripheral vision, Steve saw Bucky shift into a defensive stance, but despite the warning of his own instincts, Steve couldn’t quite bring himself to do the same. Whatever Tony was about to do, Steve surely deserved worse. He would protect Bucky from Tony’s wrath. But nothing more.
In a flash he understands what today must be. The one anniversary Tony has left, now.
This time, Rhodey stood. “Okay. Just… be prepared. I don’t know how this is gonna go.
“Congratulations,” Bruce said. “Nat told me about the wedding.”
The shattered man before him now… This was a side of Tony that Steve had never imagined. A loss of control that Steve would never have believed
Final plan confirmed, the Asgardians made their farewells for the night, and the Wakanda team drifted together for a quick discussion of duties.
“My fault,” he said, and then he crumbled, and Tony held him tight, kept him safe, whispered denials and absolutions into his hair until the super-soldier was spent and heavy with exhaustion. It took little persuasion for Tony to maneuver him onto the bed; they settled in to rest, Steve’s arms encircling Tony like he was a life preserver on a drowning sea. They fit neatly together, just like they always did, except when they didn’t. His stomach growled. The soup had clearly worn off, but nothing short of another apocalypse could have inspired him to move right now.
“Don’t,” Tony snarled, “don’t you dare think like that-”
Four days later, the strike team left for Titan.
But the other man was staring through him now, dead-eyed and trembling. “But Tony, what if…” Steve squeezed his eyes shut, his expression so pained that Tony embraced his bowed head. “I don’t want to ask,” the other man muttered against his shoulder. “It’s not fair.” And Tony did not like the sound of that at all.
“Okay,” Tony muttered, scrubbing at his face, “okay, yeah, that can work…” and he stood.
“Okay, so the fact the Devastation occurred at the same moment everywhere in the universe kinda defies everything we know of the physics of time,” the billionaire started.
“I’m gonna fix it.”
, he thought right after, the truth glittering cold and precise as starlight.
Then he’d gone to Siberia. Learned the truth. Lost his friend. Proved himself as unworthy as he’d always feared, all in one fell swoop. Steve had needed to shatter the arc reactor to stop him, but Tony’s heart had long since been destroyed.
“Uh, the twist fracture from yesterday? Like I said, it was a bad one, took me three hours just to set the bone.”
Tony’s attempt at humor did nothing to help the tightness in Steve’s chest, the blurring of his vision. He pressed the mask over his face, took a deep breath, but the rush of air only helped clarify his understanding. “I’m sorry,” Steve said, his control crumbling under the weight of his remorse.
His best friend tilted his head, studying them both. “You really need to work on your timing.”
Barnes frowned. “Well, I mean… Times were rough back then, but he sure used to… Does he not anymore?”
The young Queen shot him a grin, then with a casual gesture brought up a scrolling list of statistics.
“Until I saw how badly he was treating you,” Steve countered, all in a rush. “Tony, I know you said those videos were your idea, but-”
How wrong had he become, that this time was
The other man made that awful sound Steve had first heard in Siberia, the sob teetering halfway between laughter and despair. “I’m skipping out on the single greatest battle of our time. I know exactly what that makes me, Steve.”
Nebula had heard their voices and returned. She held out the Gauntlet. “Do you need this?” The Captain considered the offer. The item was designed to hold the Infinity Stones, after all. Yet the way Red Skull had addressed the Soul Stone suggested it had some form of awareness; also he had been holding it in his bare hand when he’d regained consciousness.
“I’m not anything special, Tony,” Steve said, frowning. “I’m just a person, there are plenty of other people who could handle the serum responsibly.”
, Steve. And you knew. And you didn’t tell me. “Not exactly,” he said.
And Steve wouldn’t have time to help him. He couldn’t help anyone now.
, Tony.”
It was a lot to ask of anyone, and Steve felt a slight shame that he hadn’t realized the ramifications earlier. Of course, Stark would rather stay in New York, near the comfort of his home. His fiancé. Working with Steve just happened to be the lesser of two evils. Nothing more.
, thank you, kid, Peter, thank you, holy shit, you are an actual
Another time jump brings another memory of that touch on his wrist, of dark eyes and careless whispers. Steve makes no attempt to resist when the guards surround him, their eyes widening at the sight of Mjolnir in his grasp. He meets the Queen, her eyes sharp with kindness, before this world’s Thor comes charging in, his cheery confusion filling the room. Steve relates what he was told of the Convergence, of London, of the Dark Elves’ awakening.
He shot her a lascivious grin. “I sure do,” Steve said, dropping his voice low. “Wanna hear em?”
Impossible as it should have been, Steve was getting a headache. He just wished he could talk to Peggy. Ask her about Tony. About what a kiss like that could mean. She was brave. She liked answers. Not like Steve, always getting stuck on the questions.
When he was alone, when it was safe, Tony sank to the floor, and he cried. Violent sobs erupted in great heaving gasps, the cries of a child wretched with rage because it wasn’t fair, it wasn’t
Strange would have to meditate deeply upon the process first, but he promised that upon his return, he would know the best way to help save Steve’s life.
Maybe he wouldn’t show up today at all.
On the plane, Shuri was cutting through a forest of scrolling numbers. She looked up as they entered, mouth furious. “I’ve double-checked the data but there is no oversight, no malfunction. Just no sign of a ship until suddenly, boom! There they are. If they have stealth tech, we cannot track it.”
The artist smiles.
; Tony knew he should be having all kinds of feelings about that, but he had no idea what was appropriate anymore.
Wanda gave the billionaire a slow smile, her eyes gleaming with loathing. “Good.” Steve stifled a sigh. Another team issue he might have to address. Luckily, Stark just ignored her.
Seeing the other man felt like… Steve still couldn’t find the words to fit such joy. But Tony had fallen apart at the sight of him, shadows deep as bruises under his eyes, desperation written in the lines etched across his face. Steve had rushed to comfort him, but even wrapped in his arms Tony felt dangerously brittle, as if one wrong move would cause him to shatter completely, crumbling away into dust. Hoping some good news would reassure the other man enough to let him rest, Steve had asked the others for details of the victory; the team had obliged, the deep concern on their faces mirroring Steve’s own desperate worry.
Clearly Tony could too. “I have some phone calls to make,” the other man said, eyes colder than any ice. And with that, he disappeared up a distant flight of stairs.
Their destination was a wide flat area flanked with two huge pillars with mysterious alien symbols carved into the stone. Nothing moved save the wind blowing a few forlorn specks of snow, and it was the loneliest, saddest place Tony had ever seen. Red Skull led them past the massive pillars, Steve and Nebula silently watching their guide with somewhat murderous expressions. Tony stepped almost to the edge where the mountain dropped steeply away and took a quick glance over. He was usually fine with heights, conveniently, but his stomach lurched at the sight of the stone platform far below. Shaken, he gladly retreated to Steve’s side; the super-soldier was still ominously quiet. Enough stalling.
In truth, Steve wouldn’t enjoy being around Stark either. Yet perhaps this could be an opportunity to prove that he really was the leader everyone thought him to be. Their last few encounters had gone… less than well. But this time, Steve vowed, he would conduct himself professionally, showing he could be fair and calm and equal to the task of working with anyone.
“Well, actually, about that,” the Soul Stone said. “We have been forced to serve you thus far, yes, although we nearly destroyed your Gauntlet trying to resist. And yes, you did just place an order for the destruction of half the lives in the universe, but as you can see, I’ve pressed pause on its delivery for now.” She pointed above their heads, and Steve saw a patch of the sky above had cracked in some hideous way, was in fact still ripping itself apart in slow motion, like forked lightning slowed to an excruciating pace. “Thankfully, the situation has been complicated by these boys showing up with a Gauntlet of their own. Not even we can serve two masters at once. Competing claims requires mediation.”
Steve looked troubled but eventually nodded. “Okay.” He took a deep breath. “Tony, there’s just not much left… I don’t know if I can…” He shook his head. “What happens if it’s too late?”
He had to get
In a quiet but resolute voice, Tony announced he would be going to the mansion the next day to confront Stone. As a distraction, he said. Steve knew it meant far more than that, so he didn’t argue, despite Tony peering at him suspiciously. Steve waited until the meeting was over and they were alone, then quietly asked if he could come too.
“Yeah,” Steve said. Then the man said nothing more, instead just licked his lips and waited, eyes smoldering. Beautiful. Wretched.
And the second wave of realization breaks over him, because no, this isn’t home, not yet, and Steve falls to his knees, unable to breathe. He is back, but that doesn’t mean... “Tony,” he gasps, tries to focus on the worried faces around him, picks out the one he needs. “Thor, quick. The BiFrost. I have to get to Titan.”
That shook Tony enough that he retreated a step and looked wide-eyed at Steve, who stepped forward. “You wiped out half of all life in the universe,” the super-soldier said, keeping his voice slow and even. “Tell me why.”
He could already tell that Tony wasn’t going to let it go, that it was only a matter of time now before his genius mind figured it out, and maybe it would be good if Tony knew that Steve could be okay without him. Then Tony wouldn’t feel pressured to stay. Freedom was important. Steve kept his eyes squeezed closed, weary. Duty was the cold place.
There is a bunch of flowers already lying there. Roses, in every possible color. He stares, touches the petals. The thorns.
Tony gave a crooked smile, eyes darting away. “Well, you weren’t exactly wrong.”
“Yeah, I’ll bet,” Tony muttered. He put his head in his hands as if rallying the energy to stand up. Preparing to leave.
Too miserable to wait, Steve moved to kneel beside the distraught man and reached for Tony’s shoulder, desperately searching his mind for a way to apologize. Again, Tony went to push him away, but this time there was no real strength in the gesture, making it one Steve could easily overcome if he tried.
,” the other man snarled.
From what Steve could see, the Doctor was appreciative of the experience, his answering smile slow and soft. But then his cape twitched oddly and he immediately looked in Steve’s direction, an emotion Steve couldn’t read flashing across his face.
“What would you suggest, then?” Rogers asked tightly, not quite looking at him.
Then Tiberius was pulling away, and Tony was getting pushed roughly into the car, scrambling all the way over to the passenger’s side. As his fiancé started the engine with one hand and fumbled at his zipper with the other, Tony had just enough time to take one last victorious look out through the windscreen. Enough time to see, so that by the time Tiberius hit the accelerator and shoved his head down, Tony had already accepted the truth. The window was empty.
Steve found himself deeply irritated by the assumption. Rhodey had been on the team for years now, and although they were never close, Steve considered him a friend. Sure, they’d clashed over the Accords, but Steve wasn’t a monster. Tony should have realized he would have asked about Rhodey’s injuries if he’d known.
“I’m just glad you’re alive to be mad at,” Tony said. He watched Steve relax, breathe, in and out. Huh. His eyelashes were dark blond. “I’m sorry you lost Barnes.”
Rocket took one look at the billionaire and turned to leave. “I’m guessing there’s only one captain for this job,” the raccoon said, stabbing his thumb over his shoulder at Tony and giving Steve a significant glare on his way out. Thor elected to say nothing but clapped Steve on the arm and smirked before he too left the lab.
Wrong, thought Steve, in sudden bone-wrenching exhaustion. There was no help. No oasis. No hope. Nothing.
Wilson and Strange were already there but Tony ignored them both, collapsing to his knees when he landed because it was worse, it was even worse than he’d feared. One entire side of Rogers’ chest was misshapen, nearly caved in, and his every breath brought red froth to his lips. He looked so odd and tiny and fragile, skinny limbs neat under the ballooning fabric, his body now drowning in the uniform that only minutes ago had fit like a second skin. But his
“What?”
bought it.”
That won him a big old Captain’s frown. “Absolutely not,” Steve started, but Tony cut him off.
The Mad Titan closed his eyes and bowed his head, overcome by trembling.
And it was Steve’s turn to lay a comforting hand upon the other man’s shoulder. “I’m sorry, Buck. For the train. And everything since.”
But of course, Steve had come prepared - Cap smirk - and was already holding up a small bottle that Tony recognized as lube.
The confirmation seemed to upset Steve even more. Over the speakers, Ty began bragging again but they both ignored him, Steve staring at Tony with blank eyes, as if at a stranger. Tony closed his eyes, unable to bear the sight, wishing he could disappear under the weight of his thoughtless mistakes, his stupid, selfish choices…
In the sterile void of the isolation room, Steve rested, and Tony spoke.
She nods, watching him. “The power of the Infinity Stones created the universe within which time itself flows. It is possible that all six used together could affect all possible timelines at once.”
I don’t make it. I’m sorry if it’s selfish, but I just… I wanted you to know. That’s how I feel.” He ducked back under the oxygen mask, gasping.
,” she mutters, the word falling like a curse, then turns to face him. “Do you really imagine time to be so fragile, Steve Rogers?”
But May was squeezing his shoulder, a steady strength in her voice. “It’s okay, Tony,” she announced, glaring at the doctors. “He can do that, it’s okay. Right?”
“Steve?” Stark had followed him. “What… Can we talk about what just happened?”
Tony reached out and traced his fingertips along Steve’s face, across his closed eyes. Blond eyelashes. “I’ll mark you yet.”
Yet he was heard.
So he begs. “Just hold on, Tony,” Steve says, “you’re safe now, you’re nearly home. Just hold on a little longer, please.” But Tony falls silent, stays silent even as a chorus of voices around them joins in, keeps murmuring words of support into the silence even after the Wakandan healers take Tony away, someone else carrying Steve away to where he waits and waits and then away again to a quiet place where he can rest, soothing voices and warmth in the dark, arms holding him close until he stops, until he sleeps, until he dreams.
And that was why one minute later, despite the Captain’s unease, Steve was rolling up his sleeve and letting her take his blood. Make it come to something good, he thought, as he watched the red flow through the tube. Make it something beautiful.
It takes months for Tony to sleep through the night, but it finally happens. When he wakes, he is bursting to tell Steve, but it’s not quite waking time yet, he might get in trouble so he waits, quivering, until it’s okay for him to move, until Steve is awake and lets him know it’s okay for him to move. Steve is delighted, his smile like sunshine, and Tony wants to tell him that but he’s not sure if that’s okay so he figures better to wait until Steve says he can. Over breakfast Steve turns serious and asks him if he’s ready to have a brave day and when Tony says yes Steve tells him that they are going to have a visitor today which brings enough bad that Tony has to hide for a while, but Steve is there and so eventually it’s okay, he’s brave. Tony thinks he recognizes the girl who visits but her name isn’t Steve so he isn’t sure but she says that’s okay. She talks slow and sunny and tells him everything she’s going to do before she does it and Steve repeats it so it’s probably okay. She gives him beads to play with, beads that light up in pretty colors when he touches them, and so he doesn’t notice at first that Steve and the girl have walked away but when he looks up Steve is crying and that is
“Dammit,” he muttered, then heard a thump; he looked back to find Tony had shot to his feet.
“Bucky,” he started.
Alive. Then where…
“So what, throwing yourself into an alien river unsupervised was the only possible option?” Tony asked, tone biting.
Steve had sat on a couch moping all day. “You’ve been busy,” he said weakly.
i'd love to hear any thoughts or critique you may have. i write for fun but i post shit in hopes of feedback, so no need to spare my feelings. i promise i will read and reflect on every comment, but i may choose not to reply if i don't trust myself to engage in good grace (still working on that thick writer skin, sorry!).
“No, don’t-” Tony grabbed his arm but the other man brushed him off, instead striding towards a babbling Ty with his shield raised for a killing blow-
Then summer murmured in his ear, and he turned towards its warmth, wishing…
With a cool swish, the masked nurses slid the last sheet into position, Steve’s world now reduced to a tiny plastic cell. He lay flat, numb, his breathing shaky.
“All friends again?” she asked, and Tony squeezed his eyes shut, wishing he could split himself in two, live the life where he broke her heart, but somehow spend the other as the man she deserved.
to get him to use it. Ironically, most of the time I couldn't get him to shut the hell up, but this one little word he kept on refusing to say. It was entertaining, if ultimately pointless. As you can see, I broke him eventually.” He paused. “Truly my finest work.”
Tony blinked. “Name it.”
Steve was floating once more among the stars, lost among their clamor. Their warnings sounded so cold. Empty.
The Captain dismissed the idea. “Not a priority,” he said. Stark looked wounded. A mistake, to alienate an asset; the Captain adjusted his tone. “Perhaps later.” Stark nodded eventually.
The door opened, and a hesitant face peeked in. “You sure?”
“Hello, Anthony,” Ty said, the usual cold smirk on his face. “Enjoying the show?”
, oh my
Heart delirious with sudden joy, Steve reached out.
Tony sighed, weary. “Why do you always do this?” he asked.
The other man let out a quick breath. “Yeah.”
Steve had been watching him, unspeaking, as physically distant as he could get given their joined hands. “Can you stand?”
Panic erupted within him, Tony’s mind seeking refuge in memories of the man he’d always known, endless images of Steve, fighting, laughing, arguing, always effortlessly strong and sure. But to his horror, his memories had
It was her perfume that woke him, gentle, safe. Tony rolled his head to where he knew she’d be, instinct strong as any sunflower. He felt a cool hand touch his face, and he was smiling before he opened his eyes.
“I found Barnes,” he blurts out.
A soft knock behind him shocked him out of his churning thoughts. “Um… Mr Stark?”
Ty scowled, his expression dark as thunder, his shoulders slumped in defeat. “If you have demands, name them.”
“Good morning,” the super-soldier started, then faltered when Tony started to laugh, because that was a really excellent joke. No one else laughed. More glances. Steve’s hand on his shoulder. He was being problematic. Tony stared down at his feet, where the night’s fire was burning out. Ashes, he thought, and shuddered, closing his eyes.
They sit him down. The best they can do. A series of treatments, a gradual purge. It’ll take years. He accepts. They return to the States. Malibu, better. Always warm. Tony asks; the sea. Steve answers; swims. He trains every day, stays ready to fight, just in case. And he sketches, and he reads, and he watches Tony work. He likes watching Tony work, summoning the future. Life and beauty.
In a burst of horror, Tony understood; he fired his repulsors recklessly, enough to melt the concrete’s grip, and he
Much, much later, Steve heard a soft tread on the stairs. A numb sort of exhaustion swept over him, but he shot to his feet anyway, squinting against the sudden glare of lights around him.
He’d used his name. Tony had- “Do what?” Steve said, breathless, trying to ignore the racing beeps from the surrounding machines
He could explain, but in this world, the Avengers are barely more than strangers.
Too late, Steve accepted the bitter reality. His place would never be here, by Tony’s side. The friendship he’d cherished was gone. There was nothing left to believe in, nothing to try or do or explain. It was over. And he was done.
Steve shot him a sharp glance. “Don’t do that. I’m really asking.”
Tony closed his eyes, his heart lurching painfully in relief.
Tony looked helplessly at the doctors. “It’s his decision,” Dr Palmer said quietly, as Dr Lewis stared at the floor. Helen just shook her head.
“Um. Yeah, totally,” Tony tried.
Eventually there came a time when the food was eaten, the tea was drunk, and there was nothing left to do but pass a few hours waiting for the sunset. For some reason, Steve elected to stretch out on the dry, yellowish grass beside the perfectly good and comfortable blanket. Since this type of hobbits-in-nature experience was much more Steve’s arena than his, Tony decided to be adventurous and give the grass a try.
She shook her head, laughed sadly. “I know.”
Steve froze, shoulders tense. “I’m not quitting, so don’t even ask.”
Tony had helped with that, more than most. Maybe more than Steve would ever know. Trying to keep up with his teasing had at first sent Steve into interesting places that often led to useful insight. Steve had assumed this was by coincidence until he’d noticed how closely Tony would watch for Steve’s reaction, his words carefully shaped to provoke but not harm. In the following months of observation, Steve had begun to appreciate the subtleties of the other man’s attention. Tony approached their friendship like he did all of his designs, all off-handed dazzle on the surface but with a steady brilliance underneath. And he never looked at Steve with awe unless Steve actually did something to deserve it.
The other man shook his head. “It’s a mild concussion, Cap. Nothing to write home about.”
“Great, then you’re fired. Bye.” He closed his eyes, determined to ignore her.
Tony blinked, a fresh wave of disappointment turning his stomach. He had flung himself first off a cliff and then face-first onto Steve’s face; if anything, the super-soldier was
Rhodey pressed his lips together. “Nat’s with him. I can ask her…”
And once more, it seemed, the scientist was showing him the way. Steve stepped back, bridging the gap between the two and Natasha on his other side. He nudged Bruce’s elbow to get his attention, then when the scientist opened his eyes, Steve raised his right hand and placed it on his own chest. Bruce cottoned on instantly, quirked a half-grin at Steve and reached out to place his left hand on Steve’s chest. Thor opened his eyes at the motion, also catching on, and poked Tony on his other side; the billionaire was startled but instantly joined in once he saw what they were doing. Steve raised his left hand towards Natasha, let her guide it into place over her heart. There was one long moment - when Clint finally looked around, saw the space kept for him in the circle, stared narrow-eyed at Natasha’s offered hand - where Steve thought the archer was going to refuse the gesture. Please, Steve thought. Please. But eventually, Clint too stepped in, placed his left hand over Tony’s heart, and for a long minute they all stood gently, eyes closed, breathing as one. Inhale and exhale.
Watched him understand.
He’d already factored this into his calculations so Tony just sighed, accepting the blame. It
Across the table, Peter stirred. “Mr Stark is injured, he shouldn’t go.” He stood, shoulders square. “But I will.”
In contrast, the power of the Time Stone was so unthinkably vast that it could instead rewind all branches of time simultaneously, not just for one person, but
“It can,” Steve tells her, his voice cracking. “It
Yet as they emerged into the daylight’s snow-magnified glare, Steve spotted Tony confronting a shadowy figure standing inside the hold of a second, unfamiliar ship parked near the Quinjet. Immediately his instincts rocketed towards full alert, his body preparing for imminent danger.
But the super-soldier was studying him. “Tony, are you sure you’re up to this?” he asked, still gentle yet his doubt so clear.
The Ancient One frowns. “Normally, no. Your past has already happened to you. You may return to it at any point, but upon the moment of your arrival the probabilities of chaos will reset, and that world will split off into something new. No matter what you do, each new timeline will rapidly diverge from what you know. The flow of time cannot be interrupted. Existence will adapt to anything, even its own destruction. However,” she hesitates, and Steve shivers once, there on the rooftop, “there is one exception.”
“They’re not gone forever.” Again, Tony had forgotten to soften the words - even hope could wound - but Steve just nodded.
“How very noble of you,” Tony drawls, but he’s still hilariously distracted by the nano-suit; Steve can practically feel his genius mind fizzing over the possibilities.
By some piteous miracle, Nebula had left certain… events… out of her report. Which was good; it was no one’s business but his and Steve’s. And also bad, because he had no idea what to do or think or feel about any of it, and talking would maybe have helped, but telling people what he'd done might make Steve even angrier at him. Yet his friends wanted to help. Maybe some of the truth would be enough.
. All the rage of the past two years; all the bitterness and disdain; all born -
“Wow,” the other man breathed, as if Steve had said something shocking.
“So maybe we don’t either,” Shuri said. Everyone looked at her. “We had assumed the Infinity Stones were lost to us, so the quantum realm was the only possible alternative. But if they’re still in play…”
“See, man?” Sam protested. “This is exactly the kind of thing I’m talking about. You act like you can’t stand the guy, but you’ve been secretly pining for him instead? Since when?”
“You with us, Tones?” Rhodey is asking.
Hope smashed through the numbness, bringing an agonizing return of feeling. Tony buried his face into the other man’s neck, too terrified to open his eyes in case this was a dream, in case he made a mistake and had to wake up.
Silence stretched in his wake, punctuated by the cold beat of Steve’s pounding heart.
Deep within his chest, the tiniest glimmer of anger stirred. Tony glared up at the central screen, stepping away from Steve.
The soldier let out a sharp exhale, took in Tony’s pleading eyes. Tony was right, he knew. They would end up with a lot more trouble than they could easily handle if he went against Howard, and things might of ended up being
He pulled back, opted to fuck Tony’s mouth instead, and Tony seemed just as eager for it, slid his tongue against Steve’s shaft, tried his best to keep up with the brutal but controlled pace that Steve set. His hands fell up over the edge of the bed, fingers twisting in the fabric of Steve’s pants, lacking the coordination they usually did, but
“Tony!” Steve said, rushing to his side. “Are you okay?”
He didn’t, Steve noticed, take off the one he’d been given temporarily. Steve didn’t ask for his jacket back.
“Hey man,” Sam’s voice rung out behind him.
“I don’t mind, really,” Steve said. “I’d rather have you here with me, like this, than somewhere out there alone.”
Tony…Tony was kind of losing his mind. God, he’d wanted this for so long, wanted Steve, all of him, everything he had to offer, and being in his arms, his big hands brushing against him, exploring him like he was doing now was so damn good, and it left him hot, tense and full of anticipation, and arousal was creeping into his veins, pretty damn fast actually, but suddenly he remembered last night’s misfortune, its discomfort and disgust, and suddenly he thought it’d be better to wait.
He hated seeing Tony like this. He wished he could help somehow, beyond laying here with him. He wished he could take Tony’s pain away, take that burden and plenty of others from him.
Tony could hear his heatbeat in his ears, fought the urge to pull back, to slide off of Steve’s cock. He wanted to be good, wanted to hold out until Steve told him he could stop, until Steve
Tony snorted.
He waited, and waited, all alone, and a little scared, and trying to keep it all together. He thought he might throw up at one point, or collapse, or go into hysterics, but managed to swallow it all down, let out a miserable moan instead, shed more tears.
His companions didn’t have any words to comfort him. Natasha felt just as guilty as Steve was looking, had for a while now, and Sam was still trying to process the whole thing, couldn’t imagine the desperation Tony felt for him to agree to something like this. It was tough to take. Yes, they were no longer wanted, and could come home, but…but what was it all for?
Steve swallowed hard. It felt like his heart was breaking all over again. These words were well deserved, but they hurt, twisted up inside him and cut at his edges like barbed wire. He didn’t want to argue them, didn’t know how. Hearing that tone of voice from Tony never made him feel good, and now, after a week without contact
“I’m so fucking stupid,” he gasped, and sat on the wet pavement, gripping his stinging hand. A few droplets of blood started pooling on his scrapes. “Fucking idiot!”
“Come here, you,” the blond said, adjusting his jacket and walking to Tony’s side. He slipped an arm around Tony’s waist, lifted his chin.
“Shit,” Tony sighed, attempting to catch his breath. His heartbeat was still pulsing in his ears, pleasure rushing up and down his body, even after his orgasm. He supposed fooling around with the person he loved most in the world would do that to a guy.
He tried not to think on it too long, especially when his eyes started burning with unshed tears. He held Steve’s pillow tight, stared at a blank spot on the wall for an hour or two, until hunger drove him to action.
Tony didn’t know quite how to take that. It seemed too good to be true, that someone could truly care about him so much. Everything about Steve was too good to be true, but it
“Got you, I’ve got you—oh,
Firstly, Tony was in his apartment. He rarely let anyone come here, regardless of who it was. It was his sanctuary, his one place to be himself entirely, without peering eyes or judgment. It was a place for him to learn, to figure himself out, to figure out how to carry the burdens of his life, to find reprieve from a world that still felt foreign and strange and lonely.
Steve anticipated it all, of course, pulled back with seconds to spare so Tony’s load spurted all over his tongue. He swallowed the warm, thick liquid, sucked his husband’s softening cock clean, and took a few seconds to regain his breath.
“No one deserves better than you, Tony,” the blond repeated, voice barely above a whisper. “You deserve the world, deserve everything. It was my job to give it to you. I was supposed to give it to you, and I didn’t.”
was. Were the rogues in custody? Was Ross playing the long game, waiting for them to notice or slip up? Was Ross on the move even now, preparing to strike? Or did Steve and his team slip away from their hunters, and where were they now? When would they be heard from again? Rhodey didn’t have the answers, and he couldn’t give them to his friend, though he wished he could.
Tony liked Steve a lot. He liked that Steve was older than him too. He liked it a lot, actually. It made Steve seem wiser, more confident, and he was always so set in his ways, took everything in stride, while Tony asked a thousand questions and went back and forth with internal arguments, felt unsure and entirely sure the next second, and was victim to the never-ending storm of emotion and confliction that came with youth. He liked that Steve was steady, smart, and kind, and of course, that he was so
“Come on,” Rhodey prompted at his side, his hands clasped around Tony’s. “Just a little more.”
Pepper hesitated a little, sat back in the guest chair. “What do you remember?” she asked, crossing her legs.
it was on purpose, knew Tony was doing this to get a rise out of him, to get what he
“You didn’t have to,” Tony replied, though he couldn’t help but smile a little at the gesture, straightened the collar of his sweater, felt a rush of heat flow through him like it always did when he saw Steve standing before him, in all his glory.
“I’m staying right here,” Steve replied, knowing exactly what he was getting at, and he dropped a kiss on his shoulder.
Tony didn’t offer him any sympathy, merely spoke more words, strong and sure despite the waver in his voice, the exhaustion palpable through the phone.
The Alpha didn’t know how to reply to that. He hadn’t anticipated such a response, especially this late at night. “Sam…”
“I think you two look more adorable,” Steve replied. “Best sight in the world.”
There it was.
“That’s why I’m here,” Ross replied, a hand placed on his belt. “We scoured the crash site, and searched in a twenty mile radius, but there was no sight of them. No bodies in the wreckage either. They just disappeared.”
Steve had been expecting it. He knew it was coming. “You are,” Steve replied, dipping his hands beneath Tony’s chest. He pulled Tony up carefully, leaned back a little, and Tony sank down the last few inches of his shaft. Steve let out a low groan, held the brunet still by the hips as they both adjusted. It was damn overwhelming, and so, so
The weather today didn’t exactly help him either. It was rainy today, with the threat of a storm on the horizon, and that
“F—fuck, oh, Tony,
“It’s not your fault, Tony,” Steve reminded him softly, pressed a kiss to his shoulder. “And I sure as hell don’t blame you. I never could.”
“You cum when you want, sweetheart, but I’m not gonna stop until I’m done.”
“I’m serious,” Steve replied, undeterred, and his expression supported his words. “What’s the address?”
Tony wasn’t sure he wanted to find out. He worried it’d be more trouble than it was worth. He worried they could get in trouble, or it could turn into a scandal, or something terrible would happen. The whole situation would leave him mortified, and it would turn into a big mess for both of them, he was sure.
“Nothing,” Steve replied, a little breathlessly. “Nothing. I’m fine.”
His heart had leapt out of his chest, and he crossed the distance immediately after incapacitating the asshole who’d done it—the leader of a small crime ring that had pilfered some Chitauri weaponry from the battle and played around with it. Tony landed next to Steve with a
“Deal.”
The blond let out a sigh of his own, pulled Tony firmer against him. “No jumping out of skin allowed,” he said finally.
Steve pressed a kiss to his shoulder then though, and then another behind his ear. The soldier tightened his grasp around his mate’s midsection a little, nuzzled the crook of his neck, inhaled his familiar scent, his happiness releasing a wave of his own which the brunet gladly breathed deeply. It sent lovely little chills up his spine, and Tony couldn’t help but let out a content little growl at it all, and let his eyes slip closed.
here, just the two of them, and although they were alone together a lot, on afternoon visits or in between dinner parties or events, their isolation was so much more apparent now, more keenly felt, with it being so late and
She was getting a little distracted.
“Thanks,” Steve replied, offering him a smile. He hoped it was enough.
If the handshake lasted a little longer than appropriate, and their fingers separated at the last possible second, that was something they planned on keeping just to themselves, something they didn’t want to share with the world.
Tony held the flowers a little tighter against him, raised his head, slipping back into his confidence. “Despite contrary belief, I’m not entirely helpless at event planning. I did get lessons on etiquette as a kid too, as all spoiled little rich boys do.”
wouldn’t forgive me.”
him, splitting him open, filling him so much, and fuck, it felt so good. His heart beat was thundering in his ears, and every inch of him felt like it was on fire, like he was going to shatter, and Steve didn’t let up. He just kept
when he heard his baby cry.
His smile was earnest, and his eyes were fond, and Tony felt his heart jump in his chest. He tried to play it off. “Just doing God’s work,” he replied with a shrug. “Can’t have Captain America running into battle ill-suited. Can’t stand to see his ass pressed into that blue onesie anymore either.”
“No, Steve,” he replied, shaking his head. “No, it’s fine.”
“Your jacket?” Steve asked, turning to look at him.
The Tony of MIT was young, wild, and far too brave for his own good, shirked responsibility just as quick as he took it on. Rhodey couldn’t have imagined the young Alpha he befriended would grow to be a compassionate, responsible, and self-sacrificing man, let alone a parent. But Tony had transformed over the years, in more ways than one, to an impressive degree.
“He’s right,” the nurse prompted at his other side, running a cool cloth across his overheated forehead. “Just a little more, Tony. It’ll be over before you know it. Come on, momma, don’t you wanna see your baby? Don’t you want to hold him?”
The sub-par audio quality of the phone did nothing to stifle Steve’s tired sigh.
“Gladly,” Tony replied, and dug into his French Toast once more.
“If you hadn’t, I would’ve just had to come up here to get it,” Steve said.
. Sure, he’d been lost in the wilderness before, or cut off from the team, but this was something entirely different. They were in a foreign country in the middle of the woods with the UN on their tail, and Tony was halfway across the world probably already worried sick, a few weeks from delivering their baby, and now Steve couldn’t reach him.
While Steve's out shopping, Howard hurts Tony, leaving an unfortunate reminder of his authority before he leaves for his business trip. Steve does everything he can to comfort Tony, to make him feel good again. Daddy issues are a hell of a thing, but so is having a kind and wonderful boyfriend.
Oops.
“You can’t do that,” Rhodey protested, shaking his head. “That’s a complete invasion of privacy! If Tony doesn’t agree to it, you’re subjecting him and his baby to a media shitstorm that none of us are prepared for. This isn’t exactly a small story—it’s world-breaking news. I won’t let you do that.”
Tony agreed. The lake house was a nice balance of it all. It was out of the way, but close enough to their friends and the city that boredom was never an issue. Where they were was exactly right for them these days. The brunet nodded a little. “You said it, honey.”
“Don’t stop,” Steve muttered, placing a second kiss on Tony’s cheek. “You know I like it.”
He wanted it. He wanted it so bad that there were tears in his eyes, and he didn’t care how loud he was, how much of a whore he sounded like. He needed it, and begged Steve to give it to him. Oh god, he was so close. He was
and he wiped his hands, straightened the cuffs of his jacket.
Steve, all things considered, made it work, but it irked Tony to no end, a lot more than it should, really.
The three of them lay there in the shade, entirely at peace, until Peter eventually had enough of napping, was starting to get a little hungry. He let out a yawn and climbed over Tony to pat Steve’s face insistently, whispering (it wasn’t much of a whisper) “Daddy! Daddy!”
Honestly, he felt kind of like a disaster at the moment. Really he shouldn’t have felt any different than every other night they ate together, but it was the knowledge of their milestone, the knowledge that they’d spent an entire year together as a couple, that took away some of his ease and replaced it with the sensation of butterflies.
“I’m sorry,” Tony found himself saying before he could stop the words from pouring out. “I’m sorry for making you come. I sh…should’ve called the police or something,” he said, realizing that Steve was
Thank you for reading! Please leave your thoughts!
Steve’s hands wrapped around his own then though, warm, kind, and pulled the bucket away and set it down on the floor. “You’re okay,” he said. “It’s okay.”
“Ssshit…f-feels good,” Tony sighed when he had the coherence to, when the blood stopped rushing in his ears and he could focus on the low heat filling his belly.
“That’s up for debate, but thanks sweetheart.”
The soldier leaned forward, pulled Tony into his arms completely and turned them around so it was the brunet laying against the bed once more, his dark curls disheveled and standing in stark contrast to the white blankets. He pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead, another to his lips.
The thought of Steve stopping now, with the hot blunt tip of his dick pressed against Tony’s hole was nightmarish. “You’re a real bastard, you know that?” the brunet said.
job to clean this mess.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve pulled back, grazed his teeth against the flesh of Tony’s ass. “No you’re not,” he said simply. “Because I told you not to. You wouldn’t want to misbehave again, would you?”
It was a loaded question, honestly. Was Steve alright with it? With only moments of happiness, out of the eye of the public? Was he okay with Tony only belonging to him when they were alone, with no one else knowing who had claimed his heart?
He looked….well, homeless, for one, as his whole team did, but sicker too. Of course he was still a walking slab of muscle, with poster-boy features, but his skin was a little paler, sickly, and his hair long and kind of dark, and his beard clearly needed attention. He looked unkempt, a little wild, a little
“Leave it,” Steve replied. “I’ll take care of it later. You’ve done enough today,” he said.
He didn’t know how he agreed to this. To be fair, he didn’t know how he agreed to
“Morning. Sleep well?”
“Blueberry French Toast,” Rhodey elaborated, voice even. He’d been in the kitchen a while now, taking his time to make the food. His mom had made the best French Toast when he was a kid. She had taught him how to make it, and tons of other recipes, always believed in the importance of being able to feed oneself. It was a lesson Tony never quite learned, no matter how many times Rhodey tried to teach him a recipe, but that was okay. He didn’t mind cooking for his friend. French Toast was one of Rhodey’s favorites and it came in tons of flavors, and it wasn’t an accident that Rhodey went with blueberry this morning.
Steve didn’t seem convinced, but didn’t press the subject any further. No need to start an argument about it—He liked Tony’s height as it was, because he fit perfectly in Steve’s arms that way, but Tony had always been a little sensitive about it. Steve couldn’t blame him; before he’d gotten the serum, he was an embarrassing 5’4” so he wasn’t a stranger to short jokes or being looked down on, literally.
“Just admit it,” Tony replied, turned to brush his lips against Steve’s. “Just admit it and you can have me, I’m all yours.” He rolled his hips ever so slowly, as torturous as it was, and tried to ignore the urgency growing in his core in favor of dragging it out so damn slow he thought he was going to die. He needed Steve to break though, didn’t want to give up the game.
, despite their differences, despite their circumstances, and now it was being put into words, at least the suggestion of it, and that was a lot to handle.
The blond let out an angry huff, moved to stand up. He’d had enough of this. It wasn’t the first time Howard had laid his hands on Tony, and probably wouldn’t be the last, unless Steve did something about it. He’d offered, so many times, to at least
Steve didn’t trust himself to speak for a moment, and instead drew back, and brought the palm of his hand against Tony’s ass with an audible
Either way, Steve seemed to love his bike. He always rode it everywhere. Hell, Tony didn’t even know he
old, but that didn’t matter. All he knew was that he liked it, and Steve was way too good at using it.
“Perfect,” Steve had replied. “I’m so lucky, so thankful you’re so good, so wonderful. My perfect baby boy.”
Tony groaned. “I can’t believe you right now. I can’t believe you even sent her off by herself to begin with. What did Nat—“
to look forward to right now, not even the uneaten food sitting in front of him.
Steve exhaled slowly, satisfied, relieved. “It was good,” he agreed, leaning over and brushing a hand over Tony’s damp bangs, settling it on the curve of his cheek. “So good. You’re so perfect, sweetheart. I love you.”
, and he didn’t think it ever could be.
Steve leaned over and pressed a kiss to his cheek as they walked to the entrance. “I know. I’m practically a villain,” he said, deadpan.
“I’m sorry,” he said, his voice pinched. “I’m so sorry, baby. This is all my fault.”
, and maybe he could admit that talking to each other again was doing more good than harm. If all off that progress was suddenly thrown out the window, if there could never be any more, if he really, truly could never see or hear from Steve again…
Thunder could be scary in its own right, but it was something natural, a natural sound, unlike the boom of a cannon or the whistle of a mortar shell. Steve didn’t mind thunder, and he didn’t mind the sound of rain. It’d be perfect, honestly, good weather for relaxing, on a day with no missions and meetings for himself, if he didn’t know how it made Tony feel, how extreme weather took a toll on his body.
Steve’s eyes settled on Tony immediately as he got in the door, and he smiled a little.
a failure.
It was true. He doubted there was anything Tony could do that would truly turn Steve away from him, that would ever be powerful enough to permanently negate his affection. The way Tony made Steve feel was incredible, and sometimes a little overwhelming, and full of trouble, but he wouldn’t trade it for anything. He’d realized that today, when that Maximoff girl gave him his vision.
Tony had always thought a good bed was high on the list of priorities in life, especially after 2008, even if he didn’t always make it to his bed, crashed on the futon in his workshop or lab instead. His bed at home was massive, with a good mattress, and soft sheets, and you could sink into it so easily, let it soothe your aching body. It had plenty of room for him and Steve, and was one of his best purchases. His sleep was hardly ever truly restful, but having a good foundation definitely helped him clock out for at least a few hours every night.
“I love you too,” Steve replied, smiling down at him gently. “I love you so much, Tony.”
“You—you can wear some of mine while you wait for them to wash and dry. Only if you want to, of course.”
Today, it left the brunet feeling drained. Peter hadn’t slept well last night either, which didn’t help the situation. The Alpha already couldn’t wait until bed time, or at least nap time this afternoon.
If Tony had really been assaulted, shouldn’t the authorities have been alerted? Shouldn’t the bastards be arrested? Steve would’ve called them himself, if he had more information to go on. He wasn’t surprised Tony was having a hard time getting the words out. Maybe he was afraid, or ashamed, or just
“My pleasure,” the blond muttered, resting his head against Tony’s, smiling a little. Tony was starting to sound like himself again, more confident, more at ease, and it settled Steve. He was glad he could help, could make Tony feel better again. “You know I’ll always be here for you, right? I’ll always be here,” he said softly, and he meant it.
Steve licked the slick from his lips, drew back a little and grinned. “Not my name, but I appreciate it, sweetheart,” he quipped, more than a little smug.
, with the one person in the world he really wanted, was his reward. It was a damn good one, he thought. It was absolutely worth all the bullshit he’d been through.
Steve rolled his eyes fondly, let his eyes linger on the love(s) of his life for a moment, and headed to the kitchen.
He hated himself. He hated that it had come to this, that he’d screwed up so bad.
“Yeah. It’s not too far from there. Guess they picked up the pieces after we left, built something else.”
myself at you.”
“Yes,” the blond replied, gasping a little, already a little breathless, even though they were just getting started.
you. I understand that things have gotten out of hand lately, and that it’s not entirely your fault.”
He really did? And Tony…Tony had been flirting with him all this time, but never really anticipated anything could come from it, didn’t think he was that lucky, but now Steve had stormed into his lab and
; too wet, and the dizziness was taking center stage. The room felt like it was spinning and his eyes were drooping. It was too hard to focus on anything.
“How many times have you misbehaved tonight?” Steve asked behind him, voice low and commanding.
Tony attempted to track Steve’s flip phone, spent the better part of the evening configuring his own in order to find its companion. He worked fervently, couldn’t help but feel that time was of the essence, because it was, but it was to no avail. The search was unsuccessful. Either Steve’s phone was off or had been destroyed in the crash, making it untraceable. Instinct, the deep sinking feeling in his heart, told him it was the latter. Tony cursed his life for the hundredth time then, shed more angry tears that night than he could count.
There was no way to find the object he’d cherished for months, to rescue the only tether he had left, the only lifeline, the only means of reaching Tony. He had just watched his hopes disappear before his eyes, in a fiery blast, all because he’d been clumsy, because he hadn’t properly secured the fucking phone. He’d been getting ready to call Tony before they were attacked, and wished he’d attempted calling just a few minutes sooner. Steve had hastily shoved the electronic in his pocket when the first rocket sailed past their wing, and they engaged the enemy jets, and now he was suffering the consequences.
“I’ve got you, sweetheart,” Steve replied. He leaned forward a little, placed a slow kiss to Tony’s neck. His lips were warm, and his hands slid down the brunet’s sides, settled on his hips. Tony let out a little moan, adjusted Steve’s hand to sit above the sore spot on his hip. The blond gave him a questioning look.
“I’m glad you were there too,” the soldier replied, tugging Tony a little closer. “I don’t think I could tolerate this day and age without you, honestly. It’s… It’s lonely,” Steve admitted, and his eyes were a little distant, a little sad.
When Steve put a gentle hand on his shoulder, rubbed it comfortingly and said, “You can stay in the car, wait right here for me,” Tony couldn’t disagree.
Jesus, how much time had the brunet really spent on this meal today? Steve imagined him working diligently, focused, determined, working for hours, maybe making a few mistakes along the way like he had a habit of doing in the kitchen, putting it all together and taking care cleaning up, getting dressed, all for Steve. His heart swelled at the thought, at all the effort of it. Not many people were willing to do so much for him.
at his side, and Tony slipped on his prescription sunglasses, adjusted his cardigan, straightened the collar of his sweater. “I can’t believe you convinced me to come out here,” he said, taking in the view.
have a connection. He wasn’t lonely with Steve here, could never feel lonely with the blond at his side, and that was all that really mattered.
It’d been a while since they had time to themselves, and Tony had been plenty frustrated lately, with meetings and paperwork stacking up, the media hounding him for interviews, and his newest inventions keeping him up at night, so Steve wasted no time jumping him this morning, intent on taking him apart
trouble getting off. He had no problem pulling out, finishing himself off instead, but if given the choice, of course he’d choose the wet, hot channel currently gripping his dick. The slide would be incredibly smooth like this, with him so loose, without any of the resistance he usually had, just from Steve’s sheer size. He just worried Tony might be too sensitive for him to keep going now, because this was out of the ordinary after all, but that obviously wasn’t the case.
He looked like a stranger. His suit was practically unrecognizable, in disrepair, missing pieces, torn in several spots. His hair—it was so long, longer than Tony had ever seen it, and he had a
“I just taught them a lesson,” the blond said, shrugging a little. “You didn’t want to call the police, and I couldn’t let them get away with it. I couldn’t let them treat you like that.”
He’d sent Rhodey away a few hours ago to get some rest. Tony was comfortable enough in the medbay, and help was only a button press away. He couldn’t deny it felt lonely, though. It was late, later than he wanted it to be, but he couldn’t seem to sleep. He couldn’t seem to do anything but lie there, staring at the vertical blinds covering the window, the slits of moonlight cutting across the floor between their gaps.
“I doubt we’ll be that lucky,” Tony replied, rubbing his aching back. When was the last time he felt comfortable in any capacity? He wasn’t sure. He heaved a sigh.
Rhodey had never felt more proud. If he shed a tear or two, he couldn’t be blamed. “He’s amazing,” he said, brushing back Tony’s sweaty bangs. His gaze drifted between his best friend, his brother, and his brand new godson. The Alpha laughed softly. “He looks like you, Tones.”
on him. Steve had learned from the best—the best being Tony— and didn’t waste any time getting to work, his plush lips wrapped around the head of the brunet’s cock, teasing it for as long as it took for Tony to let out a low whine, to lose his sense of modesty and to stop suppressing his moans.
“I thought it shouldn’t be collecting dust anymore. I thought her records deserved to be danced to, at least one more time.”
“Hey, you’re alright,” Steve soothed, gently rubbing his back. “You’re alright.”
Tony shuddered a little, tugged at the hems of his sweater sleeves.
Later that night, Tony found himself perched on Steve’s lap, snuggled up on the couch with a fresh slice of warm apple pie and a scoop of ice cream on his plate and an old movie playing on the TV. The pie was
Tony had been so distraught, so consumed by misery, that he hadn’t heard him approach, had somehow missed the familiar, clean-cut and heavy scent, which filled his lungs like fresh air, which made something bloom in his chest which had lain dormant for far too long.
“Don’t be,” Tony replied. “I mean—I was upset but, I’m not. Anymore. I… Jesus, Steve, I don’t know how I convinced you to fall in love with me,” he said, shaking his head in disbelief.
T’challa read the words to them all out loud.
The brunet didn’t feel like he had a choice, really. He wouldn’t be able to rest until he knew. It was really frustrating, actually, because he was relying on Steve all over again, way more readily than he had anticipated. He was concerned, in a way he hadn’t been for months, and that concern only grew. Was Steve ignoring him? Was he simply busy? Or was he in trouble?
Steve kept thrusting and
He knew that heat tended to work better for pain relief for Tony than cold did. It’d soothed him before in the past, so hopefully it would do the same now.
Tony chuckled a little, wiped his face clean. He cleared his throat. “Good to know I’m not slacking in my marital duties,” he said.
“Wakanda….That’s several countries away,” Natasha pointed out, crossing her arms.
“Ah—!”
. If he had just waited, just a little longer. If Steve had gotten here sooner, been able to call sooner…
Tony let out a little sigh at the touch. His eyes searched Steve’s face, for signs of irritation or disappointment or anger like he’d seen at the start of this mess, but they were absent for the moment. He looked tired, but his eyes were watching Tony intently, as if he could will away Tony’s anxiety with just a look. Tony was thankful for it, for the attempt.
to cum soon, regardless of how slow Steve was fucking him. He was taking his time with it, partly because it’d take too much force to really fuck him, and the blond was always careful, never wanted to hurt him, never pushed the boundary of pleasure too far. He knew Tony’s limit, knew every bit of him, every inch of skin and muscle, as well as his own body.
Sam wasn’t convinced that was the best way to go. “Steve, it’ll take at least a week to get there, assuming we won’t get caught. Are you sure you can afford to wait that long to call?
now. He’d lost it, lost this one small, simple item of immeasurable importance, and Tony would hate him for it, if he ever got to speak to him again. God, he hoped he’d be able to speak to him again. Tony would curse his name when he did, probably hate him all over again for all the pain and suffering he’d caused.
Did Steve mean it?
“Well, it’s not
from his suit, and Tony had half a mind to give it to him.
He tried not to think about it now. He was safe for the moment, in a bed, with Steve, and that was all that should matter for a few hours.
The question took Tony off guard, but it was a pleasant one. Of course he’d thought about it. When he came to terms with the fact that he was carrying, that he was truly having a baby, it was something he started thinking about all the time. He started with a pretty big list of names, nothing concrete, which gradually shortened, especially after finding out the baby’s sex.
He was in Steve’s bedroom. He was in Steve’s
the voice in his head told him.
Tony let that sink in. He wasn’t particularly surprised. “Just my luck,” he sighed, shifted a little.
“Come, get in the car,” Steve said softly, guiding Tony by the back towards the vehicle.
God, there was so much of it by now. It was a hell of a mess they’d have to deal with later, wetting the sheets, making everything sticky, but that was evidently just how Steve wanted it. He didn’t have any complaints about it, in fact, was encouraging it, and Tony couldn’t protest.
“Well you’re a little sexy too, if I say so myself,” he said casually, though caressed the soldier’s cheek lovingly, let his eyes show the sincerity of his words. “Sexiest guy in the world.”
“Then what?” Sam replied, his expression pinched with worry. “What are our options then?”
Tony had been expecting it. He knew it was only a matter of time before the Secretary’s team would discover the inconsistency in geo-location between the search algorithm he’d given them and the reality of the unfolding events. The timestamps were clearly different, there was no way around it. Tony had hoped it wouldn’t come to this, had hoped the rogues wouldn’t be spotted, but apparently their luck had run out.
He licked his lips, tried not to let on how shaky his breathing actually was, and got to work on the buttons of his dress shirt. Steve shuffled back on the bed, sat on his haunches to watch. Now, Tony was rarely self conscious where other people were involved, but when Steve was watching him like this, so intensely, it made Tony feel sort of nervous, despite the fact that he had essentially given Steve a show every day since the first time they met. This was just different, and for a second Tony thought of Steve’s strength, of the restrained power in his gorgeous body, and how if Steve were less kind, less caring, Tony would truly be at his mercy.
He’d touch her wherever the hell he wanted to, and she definitely enjoyed doing the same to him, anytime and anywhere. More than once they’d gotten a complaint from someone on the team who had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, but hey, could they be blamed? When every day was potentially filled with danger, with the prospect of death, who could fault them for wanting to love each other as ardently as possible every moment of the day?
Steve listened to his whining a little, licked at the brunet until he was practically dripping with it, his hole fluttering. He loved having his way with Tony, turning him into a shaking mess. He loved him so much, loved playing with him in this form. They didn’t do it all that often, because he could get a little…enthusiastic, sometimes, and so they wanted to make sure their schedules were cleared just in case Tony got a little more exhausted, more sore than they wanted him to be.
if Steve did something.
A few raindrops splattered against the window of their apartment, carried by a gust of wind. It was dark and grey outside, despite it only being around 4pm, but inside it was bright and cozy, so Tony could ignore it. Steve was heavy and warm against him, but never overwhelming despite his size.
“I love you too,” he replied, and it was true.
That sound was all the prompting Tony needed.
“Shut up,” Tony said after a second or two, and his voice was wavering a little. “Shut up, and stand up, and come here.”
“I’m sorry. I’m… It wasn’t supposed to be like this.”
He worried anyway, especially when his feverish symptoms barely withdrew. Rhodey stayed with him while Vision reunited with Wanda. She didn’t have any information to offer either. No one was happy.
God, he hated it. He hated how Howard got to him, how he could drag him down so much every time. Tony knew his father’s words weren’t true. Tony knew he was smart, and useful, and a decent person, even if he was kind of a brat, but whenever Howard laid into him like that, whenever he said such horrible words, it was hard to remember it. It made him feel small, and stupid, like a child again.
Wowie here we are. Why am I unsurprised that this is my Earth 3490 debut?
Tony didn’t have that luck. His sleep was troubled
Here we are, a second fic! Hopefully I've got a few more up my sleeve!
“Can’t get enough of it, can you honey?” Tasha purred, leaning forward a little, watching the blue in Steve’s eyes turn a little darker, a little hazier with the building pleasure, his bangs swept across his forehead. Fuck, he was so gorgeous.
Steve smiled at him so brightly he could have blinded traffic, genuine happiness, affection on his visage. The blond leaned down a fraction then, pressed a kiss to Tony’s cheek, let go of his hand and pulled him into a proper hug. Tony was warm and soft in his arms, felt familiar and wonderful and safe, and Steve never wanted to let go. Hell, now maybe he didn’t
Celene kept talking. “He’s not going anywhere, we’re not gonna take him from you,” she said. Her Beta scent was sweet and calming, and Tony managed to believe her.
That didn’t stop him from frowning to himself as he hit ‘send,’ and waited patiently for a reply. He would just have to get over it.
“Apparently, what we just did,” the soldier replied. “Nice to do once in a while, but I wouldn’t want to rely on it. The city can get crazy, and I’m glad we don’t live
He really
Tony thought he was dying, honestly. Steve was all around him,
Steve thought the same thing. The hand around Tony’s waist curled up his body in response to his sudden discomfort, dragging Tony that much closer with it, until Steve could brush his fingers through the tufts of hair at the nape of the scientist’s neck. That always seemed to help him a little bit.
either. He thought Steve would leave him on the couch where he was. But no, Steve was more of a gentleman than that,
Steve noticed the lack of response.
Tony had leaked so much that he didn’t even need lube, but if he did, Steve could’ve easily stuck a hand down where they were connected and swipe up some that had gathered there. Each thrust was accompanied by a lewd squelch from how damn wet they’d gotten him for this, and that, combined with their huffs and the sound of slapping skin made for a truly undignified soundtrack that somehow made this whole thing that much better, that much hotter.
. There was something about the robot’s appearance that was just supremely unsettling. His movements were
. He was willing to try now, if it meant Tony’s behavior would improve. He arched a brow, lifted his chin. “You wanna bet?”
gone, kissed off of her lips entirely, and she was sure her hair looked a little wild already, knew there’d be a few knots in her curls by the end of the night.
Tony was worried for Steve, in all aspects of course, but he really couldn’t help but fixate on his backside, on the gorgeous swell of his ass that was sticking up in the air for all intents and purposes, as Steve tried to get onto his hands and knees. He set a hand on the small of the soldier’s back, and maybe,
Tony knit his brows, stared down at Steve’s chest, suddenly self-conscious. “I’m sorry. I ramble way too much, I know. I keep trying to stop.”
Part of him wanted to finish, because he knew his next orgasm would be fucking amazing, but he also didn’t want the fun to be over, and didn’t think he could take much more after this one. He had a high libido, and who wouldn’t, with a mate like Steve, but even he had his limits outside of his heat. Still, he wanted it to be good, wanted to give Steve some of the devotion and sweet attention he’d gotten thus far, wanted to make the other Alpha aware who owned
, even if it was a little hard to breathe for a second.
Peter shook his head, linked his arms around Tony’s neck. “No nap,” he protested. “No more sleep!”
!” he whined, almost a sob, and jerked in the soldier’s grasp. “Ugh, I can’t! I can’t, I’m gonna cum, I’m gonna—!”
“Turn around and lay on your back,” he said.
His head swam, and he pulled his arms up to wipe the tears that had formed at the edges of his eyes, but then Steve was tilting his head back again. “Open up,” he said, and Tony did without hesitation, and the whole thing started over again.
Steve had broken another promise, had squandered another chance. He wasn’t sure he’d get a third.
The kiss didn’t last that long, because Tony didn’t really want to keep Steve from sleeping in the first place even if he couldn’t, but it still felt really nice. The last time they’d kissed was at the party, before all of this. It felt good to kiss Steve again, to know that he was still allowed that luxury. Steve had made mistakes in the past too, been on the receiving end of Tony’s ire, but none of that ever mattered when they made up, when they came back together again. The brunet hoped they were at that point now.
Steve was sprawled out on his belly at the moment, groaning a little. His head was reeling from the impact, and his skin was stinging even under his suit. He hoped it had held up.
It took a lot of convincing the blond to let Tony handle everything for their anniversary actually, because Steve insisted he wanted to plan their evening, but Tony eventually won the argument. Thank god he had, because if Steve had been in charge, then there would be
loving Steve. But would it be enough? Could he forgive him for all that had happened, and could he do it
[I love you.]
His cock was hard and throbbing beneath him, rubbing against the wet spot already marking the bed, and the room felt a thousand degrees too hot. His head was swimming, and the tight pleasure building in his core was way too tantalizing, just out of reach,
[Tony?]
Tony’s head fell back against the bed, and he let out a sharp little gasp. Normally he didn’t get worked up this easily, could take a fair bit of teasing and dish out a lot more, but today he couldn’t. Today Steve was disarming him, in every way, and Tony was going to let him. “God, please touch me, I’m so fucking horny.”
The doctor nodded. “He will. Once the sickness withdraws entirely, the symptoms will go away. He’ll be strong and healthy. It’s just a matter of getting to that point.”
Steve groaned at the sound of his voice, the way his walls clenched around him, squeezed him tight. He mumbled something Tony couldn’t quite understand, and then he surged forward, gripped Tony’s hips a little tighter, his cock throbbing as he came, and painted the brunet’s insides with hot cum. Tony shuddered at the sensation, and Steve rode out his orgasm with little thrusts, moaning soft and breathlessly, and he couldn’t seem to stop moving his hips, reluctant to give up the vice around his cock, wet now with his cum, a little looser thanks to Tony’s orgasm. “Fuck…
Tony was right. Steve wanted that, so bad, wanted to just give up the whole thing and really give it to him. He was so damn hard, and it was torture right now, with Tony’s heat squeezing around him. He’d been able to ignore it for a while, but the urge to fuck up into the hole so beautifully spread around him was becoming overwhelming. Steve wanted to give up, wanted to let Tony win. He wanted to take what was being offered to him, wanted to take what was
tight. Steve was a little more sensitive like this, though he never understood quite why(perhaps it had to do with instinct, with his senses. Everything was dialed higher, more visceral, more primal), and each time the head of his cock pressed against Tony’s walls, pleasure rolled through him so good he had to keep himself from shredding the sheets apart.
Around the corner he could spy the entrance to the kitchen, and he assumed the bedroom and bathroom were down the hall. He also spotted an easel tucked away between two shelves, and wondered briefly where Steve kept his art supplies. It was a cute place, clean, but clearly lived in. It was very different than his own home (or homes, plural). It felt intimate and beautiful and secret, like a place to hide, instead of a lavish mausoleum like he was used to.
“Fine, no divorce, honey, just—oh…!”
Steve’s fur was soft against his back, but his massive erection? Blessedly hard. There were plenty of advantages to having a werewolf for a boyfriend, but his huge dick was certainly near the top of the list. Steve was big in human form too, but the fact that he got
Tony could hear the hesitance in Steve’s tone. What
Tony raised a brow, looked up at the tree in question. He didn’t see anything extraordinary about it, but if Steve liked it, that was good enough for him. It was kind of tall though; he wasn’t sure how many he’d be able to pick. The scientist glanced around. Didn’t these types of places usually have ladders standing around? People brought their kids apple picking, and kids were a lot shorter than Tony. He couldn’t see one though.
[Just fuck off honestly this shit isn’t working anyways. The doctors are fucking liars]
That was what Steve had been waiting for this whole time, for Tony to admit his faults, admit that he should do better. This wasn’t the first time they’d been through this, but maybe this time, the lesson would stick. God, he was so stubborn. It took all of this for him to say those few words.
The soldier could agree with that sentiment. Certain people did bring a kind of magic to their food, a kind of love. Tony shouldn’t have excluded himself from that sentiment though. Whenever he cooked, specifically his mom’s old recipes like he was going to this weekend, it also had a kind of magic. He always had to make massive portions, because Steve packed away a lot of food in general, but especially his favorites. Tony never seemed to mind, and despite his insistence on hating being in the kitchen, Steve could see the joy it brought him when someone appreciated his food.
Steve lifted his free hand. He was trembling, hesitant, unsure if he was making a mistake, if he was allowed to do this, but he slowly traced the curve of Tony’s cheek, softly, reverently. He couldn’t believe he was here. He couldn’t believe they were in the same room, let alone so close. He remembered the last time he’d touched Tony, how he hurt him, and vowed never to do so again.
Honestly, the suit was so form fitting that it made his ass look
often, which made moments like this that much better. Tony was grateful for it.
Peter shifted a little, made a noise, and Tony brushed a hand across his forehead, swept back the small, fine curls of his bangs. His eyes were fixed on Steve now, as if he were the most interesting thing in the world, and Tony couldn’t bring himself to fault the kid for it. Steve had that affect on people. He’d had it on Tony too, more times than he could count.
Tony shuddered a little, pulled back so he could look up into Steve’s face. “Am I?” he asked, sniffled a little.
sick. Steve had gotten up a little while ago to resupply him on medicine, brought along a water bottle and a bucket just in case. It wouldn’t be the first time Tony had vomited from the pain. He couldn’t keep his eyes open at this point. Every time he did, even for a few seconds, swirling white stars danced across his vision, and he felt dizzy.
Tony let out an amused exhale, brushed a hand through his hair. “Sorry, I was on a budget. My apology will have to do.”
communicating. He hoped that was soon, but knew it might take a long time. He’d been itching to hear Tony’s voice again, if only for a few moments, but knew better than to try and call. When Tony was ready, he would reach out. Steve just had to trust.
That wouldn’t do.
It didn’t take long for their kiss to intensify, and Steve pulled back to suck a hickey against Tony’s neck.
God, he missed Rhodey.
Tony settled in the passenger seat of the warm car, let his head fall back against the seat. “Ford,” he mused, catching sight of the logo on the steering wheel, and he brushed a hand over his face. “Of course.”
“Anything for you,” he said, and it felt like a declaration, like a promise.
So yes, it was safe to say that Steve Rogers was panicking right now, pacing back and forth in the small clearing they were hiding at for the moment, cursing himself and every god out there for his misfortune, for his fucking never-ending punishment, like he had been for at least fifteen minutes now.
, for money, like he used to believe, like he was told, when he was young and stupid? What’s if that’s all anyone saw him as? What’s if he made this big fancy dinner, got all dressed up just to be disappointed by his life
“I love being with you too,” the brunet replied, his heart swelling at Steve’s words. He squeezed Steve’s hand a little. “I love
He brushed his fingertips across his lips, recalled the sensation of Steve’s on his, and couldn’t help but hope for more.
“This is a joke. This
Steve smiled, brushed a gentle hand through his hair, and stepped back. He moved to the bedroom door and locked it. The click of the locking mechanism made Tony’s heart jump, filled him with anticipation and relief, and his eyes followed Steve across the room, his confident gait, his broad shoulders, the veins running down his arms, visible thanks to his rolled up sleeves. He looked strong, beautiful, safe, and Tony couldn’t believe he had won him over, that Steve was his and his alone.
He’d always been protective of Tony, even though he knew his friend didn’t really
Tony’s breath caught in his throat.
—but there were things he wanted to forget instead now, troubles that outweighed his silly little crush, his pining plight. There were things he hoped the alcohol he’d drunk would dull, would turn fuzzy and faded in the background of his mind. There were things he hoped Steve could help him forget.
okay this fucking MONSTER was not supposed to be 10k!!! I am angry but not surprised. I got a little overzealous with this concept, and it's clear in how damn gratuitous it is. I really just be out here exposing my own fantasies huh. Whatever. It's good material.
He tried to change the subject.
“Still! If they find one of you, it’ll only be a matter of time before they find all of you, or before they make
All of this was Steve’s fault. All of it. He already had so many things he could never repay Tony for, and now here was another. God dammit. God
She was right, and they both knew it. It wasn’t a comforting thought.
The coin dropped into the slot, and Tony lifted the receiver to his ear. The operator picked up. Tony sniffled, gave her the number he wanted. He waited there, alone in the dark, for an answer.
It took Steve all of two seconds to figure out the problem, as he dropped his latest apple in the basket. He did his best to hide how entertaining it was. Tony looked disgruntled, which wasn’t out of the ordinary, but the sight was also endearing.
Steve’s lips brushed against his neck, a series of kisses placed down his throat and ending at his collarbone. His bangs were hanging forward, loose and sweeping instead of slicked back like he kept them these days. They tickled on Tony’s bare skin, and he let out a quiet laugh.
The scientist let out a content little sigh as the song drew to a close, though it was a little sad. He didn’t want to lose the magic of this moment, didn’t want to let it end.
mark up my skin.”
She leaned down, gave him a quick, open-mouthed kiss before drawing back again. “You’ve got it, honey,” she said, and slid off of him, fit herself between his legs, and after a few moments, she was finally,
Tony brushed his wet hair out of his eyes, smiled at the two of them, standing up in the water. “I think it’s an ‘uh huh.’ Let’s head home,” he said.
Steve smiled at him, and took a sip of his own drink. “Is it good?” he asked, though already knew Tony’s answer. He’d seen Tony drink enough coffee to know what he liked, how much sugar he wanted, the kind of creamers he preferred.
“You’ll see him again,” Steve promised her, despite his better judgment. Historically, his promises had a habit of being broken. “We’ll figure out a way.”
eating him out.
His legs, the legs of a super soldier, of a man with the strength of ten, with the power of a hero, shook beneath him, and then Steve was on his knees near the side of the bed, too ashamed to even look Tony in the eyes anymore. His body was slumped, bent towards the floor, his palms bracing the cold tile beneath him for stability.
He could just as easily take pictures from his StarkPhone, and had on occasion, but there was something charming in having physical copies of his pictures. Steve thought so too, was actually the one who’d bought the camera. After all they’d been through, being able to hold reminders of their memories, of the good times, seemed more important than ever.
“You might want to reconsider our original plan,” he added, looking directly at Tony. “If they’re out there with nowhere to turn, we could get this done real quick.”
“This is all your fault,” he said against Steve’s lips, tugging on the collar of his jacket.
Tony handed him his glass, reached up to adjust the blond’s still-drying bangs. “Sit down, before your food gets cold again. I already fixed up your plate.”
Steve stood too though, crossed the short distance between them before Tony could lift his plate from the table. He took one of Tony’s hands into his own.
He also got the sense that boredom must run rampant here, but he kept that thought to himself, tried to focus on the pretty scene this late September day had provided.
had a little time, and were making the most of it.
Steve lowered Tony to a more comfortable height as he dropped the last one in the basket, but didn’t set him down. Instead he kissed him again, deeper than was probably appropriate for being outside, but Tony didn’t seem to mind. Steve’s hands tightened where they grasped his cardigan, as if he didn’t want to let go. He kissed with quiet desperation, with purpose, whether he admitted it or not. Tony slung an arm around his shoulder, cradled the back of his head with the other. He kissed him back sweetly, expertly, let him take his time, drink his fill.
Tony got away with saying a lot, with doing a lot, thanks to Steve, and part of him was sure it was because Steve loved him, truly loved him, and was too shy or scared to say anything about it. Tony was scared to say something too, because what could they do, really? Spend the rest of their lives sneaking around everyone’s backs, stealing moments of happiness, and nothing more? No. It was better, more
“It won’t be too long,” he said, and smiled a little. “If you haven’t noticed already, you’re really fucking hot.”
punishing him, if this whole thing had turned malicious, and suddenly he regretted acting out tonight. The seconds crawled by, and it felt like an eternity. Tony thought he was going to pass out.
, and I know some people are a little more accepting of that these days, but it’s still hush hush, and in my day I’ve seen and heard of more than one story where things ended up badly when word got out, and I’d
Tony presents Steve with an interesting challenge that has plenty of reward. He's never been good at playing games fair, though.
Two days later, the UN tapped cameras and phones all over the African continent, set up around the clock surveillance in a 200 mile radius from the crash site. They didn’t catch sight of the rebels, and didn’t receive any hints or clues either. It was radio silence.
of him, because he decided to come home early after a nice dinner with his family. Naturally, Tony sprung the news on him, his hands shaking a little though he tried to hide it, and Rhodey took him by the hand, led him to the couch.
, more than this unbearable teasing that he’d been enduring, more than Steve was letting him have.
to the nausea.
They were both a little obsessed with each other.
Steve was grunting now, moaning a little in that rough voice, and one of his paws braced Tony’s hips, big and heavy, and his claws just barely left scratches across his tanned skin, and that was it. Tony shot his load all over the bed beneath him, his back arched and brows furrowed, the aftershocks rushing through him so good it made his limbs weak.
Steve’s skin was warm, smooth against his. He still smelled like sunscreen and seawater, his face a little pink from the sunburn he’d gotten because he forgot to reapply coverage earlier. His hands—god they were so big—brushed down Tony’s sides, gentle, but warm, their heat leaving goosebumps in his wake.
“Fuck,” Steve groaned, and he couldn’t stop his hips from thrusting a little quicker, a little harder.
“I’m glad I got the suit done in time,” Tony replied.
“Yeah. See, statistically, their missions last two hours, two hours and forty-five minutes tops. I added two hours buffer time after that before even checking in, but I wasn’t getting anything back, and I kept texting and then I called, and then I called
Tony’s ministrations served to make Steve more empty-headed, let him focus on the here and now, just the two of them. He’d never tire of the intimacy, of the pleasure of just existing together. He knew it was only a few more days of this bliss, and then they’d return to real life, but he intended to make the most of this dream while it lasted.
“What for?” the scientist asked.
, but it really just made him more eager for it.
Now, he wasn’t sure that opportunity was available anymore. He wasn’t sure what was happening at the moment at all.
was mad at him. Some of them made that very clear from the start, and Steve probably would have too if he didn’t know how shaken Tony was. They’d fallen into bed a few hours ago with only a few words exchanged, nothing substantial, and nothing lighthearted like usual.
Steve had rushed here as soon as they landed on the other side of the Compound. There was no time to change, or to make himself more presentable beyond what he could on the flight over. He could think of nothing else but this moment, of apologizing, and hoping with all of his heart that Tony would be merciful. Steve would sign the Accords in the morning, agree to follow their demands, and so would the others, because there was no fighting the inevitable anymore.
Steve missed that. God, what he wouldn’t give to go back to all of that.
Tony made him feel like he belonged, like he was connected to something, not just drifting endlessly in an unfamiliar sea. The brunet was his tether, his anchor. Tony always showed him new things, helped him make new discoveries, and find his footing in a changed world, and he never did anything worse than tease Steve a little if he didn’t get something. He treated Steve like a person, instead of a relic or paragon like many others did, and he was always happy to see him. Tony made Steve feel welcome, like he wasn’t just an intruder in everyone’s lives. He made everything easier.
Luckily, the couch was pretty big, so they didn’t have a problem turning on their sides to cuddle more easily. Thunder was still rumbling overhead, and the power was still out, but neither particularly minded.

He could deal with people being angry with him. He could deal with people hating him too. Plenty of people did. What he couldn’t deal with was
“They asked for access to our satellites, to strengthen their reconnaissance capabilities,” Shuri explained. “We decided against it, and that horrible man, Secretary Ross threw a fit about it. His face got so red he looked like a tomato.”

“Steve,” the blond replied, and smiled back at him. They looked at each other for a moment, and started to laugh at the absurdity of the situation. “Do you often squeeze yourself under other people’s umbrellas?” Steve asked, raising his brow.
Rhodey of course didn’t laugh at him, or think his concerns were stupid. He took a moment to absorb them, and chastised himself at not picking up on any of this sooner. Then again, Tony had always been good at wearing a mask.
Jesus. Steve’s face was warm, and he was sure his skin had gone red by now. Tony was good at reaching for the upper hand, knew just what to say and do, but Steve, every inch as stubborn as the brunet, wouldn’t give it to him. “I told you to shut your mouth, or I’d find something to fill it,” he said, pulling Tony away from him.
His hand slid up Tony’s back, brushed through his hair, the pads of his fingertips ever-so-softly grazing his scalp, and the brunet moaned a little into Steve’s mouth, grasped at the blond’s t-shirt.
“It’ll have to do,” Rhodey added, nodding at the Secretary. “With Tony so close to the due date, he really shouldn’t be working at all. He needs to focus on his health. We’ve already had close calls, in case you’ve forgotten.”
He was lucky that he always had a few quarters in the pockets of his jeans for phone calls, alongside his ID card, or else the night would have been even worse. He’d taken the card out to pay his cab driver(of course he wasn’t going to have Jarvis drive him to a party. He wasn’t a fucking kid anymore) and shoved it in his jacket afterwards, thought nothing of it, and with all the excitement, he’d forgotten all about it until now. That was
Steve must have sensed that it needed as much now, because he pressed a gentle kiss to Tony’s forehead. “Don’t worry about anything right now,” he muttered. “Just rest up.”
He was too concerned, filled with too much worry. Where was Steve at the moment? Was he okay, or was he hurt? Where was he headed? Would they ever speak to each other again, even have the chance to? Or was Tony really on his own now? Had it all come to an end? Would he have to spend the rest of his life without his mate? And furthermore, how would today progress? Would Tony be able to talk his way out of prison, or had he damned himself, and his child?
