“I understand, sir,” Steve said in a hollow voice, then added after a moment’s hesitation, “Perhaps there’s a waitlist in case a model cancels? And, I-- I understand that funds are tight for the Academy; I could accept a reduced rate if there’s any opportunity that opens up.”
“Oh?” Pepper said.  She liked doing that-- making an inquiring noise instead of asking a direct question. That way you’d tell her whatever was most pressing on your mind.  It was one of her active listening techniques, designed to encourage dialogue and not dominate discussion.
Tony shoveled pasta into his mouth, then realized that Rogers might think he’d been screwing around.  “I haven’t forgotten about Bob, though.  I just tinker to clear my head.”
“BAAAAAAAAAA!” Hulk roared and tossed the ball back to Tony. Well, towards Tony. It sailed over his head by about ten feet and he’d have needed more than the gauntlets and chest plate to catch it.
Tony gave Rhodey this helpless look, struggling for words.  Rhodey nodded, expression solemn, and said quietly, “I can’t imagine what that’d be like.”
“That hasn’t changed as much as it should have,” Colbert says after a few moments. “PTSD is still undertreated, particularly for Veterans.”
(Okay, so first layer: a base of poly-plastacine stretch fabric, inlaid with scale mail links-- gold-titanium alloy—which brings us to a weight of . . . .)
Tony drained the rest of his mug and poured some more coffee, then turned to the projection.  (Not with baited breath.  Of course not.)
Tony smiled, warm and relaxed.  (It was good, he was good, they were good . . .) He didn’t usually go to bed so early—and he’d probably wake up in the night—but it had been a long day and, well, there was nothing wrong with having post-scene drowsiness. He let his eyes drift shut.
Steve obeyed, breath hitching a little as his hard cock pressed down against the bed.  He heard Tony open the cap on some sort of bottle, then a wet noise.  Tony’s hands were slick with oil when he touched Steve’s shoulders with a firm pressure.  Tony pressed down where Steve’s shoulders had grown a little stiff.
” Tony gave a mock shudder. “Anyway, I’ve been reaping the rewards ever since: Amir’s food in New York and a very tidy return on the original investment every year.”
“If you say so, Cap,” Tony said with a smile, patting him on the shoulder. “When it comes to the press, sometimes honesty about the details gets in the way of the truth.” Tony shrugged. “They heard the important part. That’s all that really matters.”
“Do it, Pep,” Stark whispered. His voice was pained and so soft Steve couldn’t have heard without the serum. “Do it—has to be you. I can’t—please? Please? Do it for me? I’ll hate you, but I love you, Pep? Please? I can’t—”
“When I met him, he was my mark.  It was . . . different.  When Fury sent me to assess him for the Initiative, I wasn’t supposed intervene unless there was a clear and present danger.  So I watched.  And later . . .”. She paused and glanced away in one of the most explicit shows of regret Clint had seen from her.  “Later it had become habit.”
They walked quietly a few more moments.  Some event must have ended recently; the corridor was crowded with SHIELD Agents dressed in their full gear.  Rogers stood out in his dockers and leather jacket.  And, well, Tony always stood out there.  Especially next to Rogers, who towered at least eight inches taller.  (Not that Tony’d calculated or anything.)
Before Steve could set the freshly poured cup on the counter for him, Tony took it from his hands and gulped it uncouthly. Steve blinked, then grinned.
Jackie shrugged. “I guess I was curious if you’d tell me.” He tossed his head and said a little more casually, “Besides, I like having all the gossip first--you know that.”
Bruce blinked owlishly, looked down, and then back up. He gave a sheepish smile. “Yeah,” Bruce said. “Kinda forgot about that. Okay. I’ll throw something on and meet you on the quinjet.”
Tom watched as Captain America strode from the mess hall. (It’s none of your business.) He hesitated for about forty seconds before following. (He may not have Rhodes’ robust build, but he was swift and silent on his feet.)  But Tom nearly gave himself away when the Captain stopped abruptly in the hallway and doubled back to the cafeteria. At the sight of the Captain striding purposefully towards him, Jerry flinched, but Rogers just picked up his untouched lunch tray and carried it to the bussing racks.
Tony let out a startled little gasp and nodded. Steve pressed kisses to his throat and gathered both Tony’s wrists in one hand, holding them tight, pressed to the wall. Steve lowered his other hand to caress Tony’s cheek.
“-- it’s better than the alternative?” Tony cut in. Tony shook his head and set the tablet aside. “I’m a busy guy. I don’t have time to get in a froth and kill punching bags every time some idiot is an orientationist, sexist, racist douchebag on the internet. I’d never do anything else.” Tony shrugged, then asked, “Why were you even
“Please don’t apologize,” Steve said. The slightest pause, then, “I’m glad Jim’s met someone special.”
“And for some reason he’ll never come down to the workshop,” Rhodey said. He walked into the room and paused. “Everybody else does, but not him. Even when I’m coming down to invite you to lunch with us.”
“Fine, fine,” Tony said, holding his hands up in surrender. He took a long swallow of coffee. He sort of wanted a way to touch Rogers reassuringly, a nudge with his elbow or a playful shove, but couldn’t quite figure out how, so he just took his seat. Looking around the counter, Tony had that feeling again—the ‘not-intruders, they kinda belong here’ feeling. It was all sort of . . .
Tony tried to keep his voice calm and explanatory, but he wasn’t very successful: “I had the situation handled. I had things under control. You rushed in and nearly fucked things up. Don’t pull that shit again, okay? I don’t need
Tony finished up with Dummy, wiped him off, and shooed him across the workshop.  Tony’s own joints creaked as he got up off the floor and he frowned.  (Ugh.  Old.)  He rummaged around in the workshop for a piece of paper.  And, seriously, when was the last time he’d done that?  After a while, in the bottom of a drawer, he found a yellow legal pad and a variety of pens.  The first five he tried were dried out, but he eventually found one that worked and jotted down a quick note:
Tony pulled back the covers and coaxed Steve in to bed, then curled up against his chest.  Steve wrapped his arms around him and let out a deep sigh.  He turned to give Tony a long, lingering kiss.
Steve licked his lips.  Oh God, Tony’s roving hands felt like they were everywhere at once, his chest, his nipples, his stomach, his hips. . .
into Steve’s body.  Steve’s thighs quivered.  He was moaning steadily.  Heat was coiled tight in his stomach, his whole body hot and aching.
to dinner?”  Rogers looked up sharply, brown creased.  “You’ve got to be kidding.  You do know who I am, right?  I could buy half the restaurants in New York tomorrow if I felt like it.”
was why Tony should be in his workshop.  There was nothing to do with his hands here, nowhere to divert his attention, just quiet and--
Rogers was flipping a pancake when his ass started blaring a poor quality recording of reveille. Rogers jumped. He grunted and reached back for his cell phone grumbling, “Didn’t think the damn thing would be so loud.” He glanced at the screen, then answered, “Captain Rogers speaking . . . Yes, sir. . . I see. Where? I see. Yes, sir. We’ll be there right away.”
Just 5mm! It sounded so small! But it was enough you could see its outline under his clothes unless he dressed in layers; enough that it would mark a person’s skin if it pressed down, cutting off circulation. (He’d given the damn thing a rounded rim after napping across Pepper’s lap and leaving a nasty mark where the sharp edge bit into her thigh.…)
Steve let out a happy sigh and felt like he was preening inwardly.  (It’s not like I did something amazing . . .  Why do I feel so absurdly proud?  Because.  Just, because.)  Steve sighed again, letting go of his lingering uncertainty and going more and more languid under Tony’s attentions.  (I made Tony happy.  Doesn’t matter.  Don’t over-think it. . . .)  He was still hard, but not aching; his lingering arousal felt like a vague buzzing in the background.  Steve lost track of time, lulled by Tony’s affectionate touches.
Soon the kitchen was full of bustling as everyone got out plates and drinks and napkins. Tony met the pizza guy—oops, blue-haired girl again—at the elevator and once again assured her that his generous tipping habits weren’t a typo.
you could have done,” Pepper said firmly, refusing to raise her voice. “And, yes, reading about the victims, mourning even for the people you didn’t know—up to a point that’s a healthy sign of respect, but I’m cutting you off.”
“Chill out, Steve,” Tony said, walking over to Pepper, “I’m good. Just toss me that pillow, would ya?”
“I said hold steady!” Steve repeated, actually knocking back one of the SHIELD Agents who had started running towards the Blob.
“No worries.” The timer went off and Bruce bustled over to the oven. “And, if you want some, curry will be done in another hour.”
“And let’s do our best to accelerate the new training planned at the ranch,” Cap added. Everyone nodded—even Bruce, though he looked pretty miserable about it.
Steve wanted to ask a jumble of impossible questions: if Tony had plans for tomorrow with his girl and, if not, if he and his girl were quits or having trouble; if he didn’t celebrate Christmas; if he was really an atheist; if he missed his parents at this time of year--- but Steve had more sense than to pursue any of those topics with Tony and he couldn’t quite figure out what else to say except what he’d said several times already, guilt twisting in his belly: “I was wrong about you on the helicarrier.  I was
(Go on, stupid.  Stop procrastinating with small talk.)  Tony paused, then asked, “So, how was training with Natasha?”
Tony let out a helpless little noise. He parted his lips, wanting Steve’s tongue in his mouth, hot and demanding, wanting Steve’s body curled over his, taking him and—
friend!); envy (of that certain bond between soldiers); surprise (that Rogers could laugh like that); unease (at such visceral proof other people’s lives had gone on in the weeks he’d been comatose, then bedridden).
“Oh, I got those too,” Steve said, looking guilty.  “I’ve been meaning to reply.  We’re supposed to schedule a press conference soon.  And there’s a gala coming up, then another one.”  Steve bit his lip.  “Do you think we should still go?”
Or maybe the whole team would be watching another picture, one of those loud, crazy things Clint and Stark liked, the ones that always moved too fast and cut too often. And they'd be debating what kind of food to order--Thai? Chinese? Mexican?--and maybe Stark'd say "Steve--" (No. Not Steve, not yet.) Stark’d say, "Cap likes pizza." And he'd smile at Steve, amused and kinda smirking, but not mocking--because he remembers and he's actually being kind in his odd way and Steve would say, "Yeah, I do like pizza." And this time, when they all went to watch the film, Stark'd come and sit on the couch instead of hovering at the kitchen counter with a tablet and all those glowing screens, insisting he can see the movie fine from there and has too much work and has seen it too many times to give it more than 15% of his attention. He'd sit on the couch this time. (Next to--? No.) With the team. On the couch.
Tony took a sip of water. He hoped everything was set up at the Ranch as requested. He moved a Castle and mentally ran through the checklist he’d sent the care takers one last time.
“The resemblance really is striking,” Tony said, smoothing out the crumples that Dummy’s tight grip had put into the page. “Nice work. Dummy’ll probably insist I frame it.”
“Kidding, kidding!” Clint said, hands up in surrender. “Anyway, are we shipping out tomorrow? Yeah? So, how about team pizza and movie night before we go. Last chance for proper New York pizza for a while. You two in for some team bonding?”
“Huh?  Yeah, sure,” Tony said, waving a hand in Rogers’ direction.  (Shit.  Yeah, the whole quinjet was too loud.  It was supposed to be fucking silent for fuck’s sake.)  “Whatever,” Tony said absently to the Captain.  “Knock yourself out, Rogers.”
, Steve came back from his run to find that Clint and Natasha had left him a brisk, professional note informing him that SHEILD had sent them on a mission, but if the Avengers needed to assemble they would be able to get to New York from their new (undisclosed) base in roughly four hours.  They left all the necessary information to contact SHEILD and expedite their return in case of an emergency.
“Ladies and gentlemen--submissives, switches and Dominants,” the maestro announced, “happy Valentine’s day to one and all.  Please join us for the first dance.”
“[when untying a submissive] let them move their own body.  Muscles become sore and joints become stiff when they haven’t moved in a while.  If a well meaning dominant ‘helps’ by moving the body part for the submissive, they can cause a strain or similar injury . . .” (146).
Pepper shrugged and shook her head.  “Problems in R&D.  It’s a disaster.”  She pressed her palm to her temple and continued, “Basically, we were already behind schedule to release the next generation Stark Phones—as in, late enough to warrant a skit on SNL and to make Leno’s list—and now there’s a design flaw that’s gone into production and the functions we’re
Stephen Colbert smiles at the camera and says: “Welcome back! And now please welcome our special guest: the one, the only, the original Captain America! Steve Rogers, ladies and gentlemen!”
Later that afternoon, Dummy was tossing a ball against the wall and running his dexterity protocols while Tony tinkered away with the TV playing in the background.
“Are you two doing that thing again?” Tony asked. “Because I seriously love it when you fight over me, but it would be even better if you could wrestle right in front of me. Preferably in skimpy little outfits. Or maybe—“
“—context inappropriate. And without my permission. But,” Tony shrugged, trying to keep it casual, “I just gave you permission and this is a date. It can be like any other consensual form of power exchange.” He leaned a little closer. “Like foreplay.”
“Thanks” Tony said, waving a hand casually.  “So, we’ll get you set up with fingerprinting and a retinal scan.  That way, you can take the private elevator without having me okay it every time.  Oh, and say ‘hi’ to JARVIS.  JARVIS, this is Steven Grant Rogers, the one and only Captain America.”
Well, that turned out to be fucking awkward.  And things had been going so well with Pepper lately!  Not like
Tony cracked a smile and gestured to himself as he added, “I mean, it’s a great little machine, even if it is an older model, but the mileage is getting up there and it’s had some wear and tear.”
you are kidding, but to be disgustingly honest the board nearly peed themselves at the very mention of
“So what’s your word, champ?”  Tony asked with a smile.  “Something you wouldn’t say in bed, okay?  Or as part of a normal sentence.  Er, a normal sentence in bed.”
“Makes sense, though, right?” Clint continued, “Cap’s dealing with the future and now the media frenzy. Probably good to show him we can still, you know, think of him as a person not just some icon.”
Tony opened his mouth, but before he could say anything, Steve just murmured, “It’s okay; I’ve got you,” again. Tony swallowed thickly and laid his head against Steve’s chest. Steve let out a happy little murmur and stroked his neck. Tony curled closer and tried to match his breaths to Steve’s deep, calm breathing: in-out, in-out, in-out. As Steve held him, Tony let his eyes slide shut, suddenly aware of how absurdly tired he was. (He hadn’t realized how worried and tense he’d been all day . . .)
And it was sort of sweet—though ridiculous—that Steve was nervous. Tony’d been worried that Steve had thought—what? He wasn’t even sure what he’d worried about exactly. (That he’d think I’m a slutty dancer? That I’m an irresponsible drunk? That the scarring’s ugly? That arc reactor makes me a freak?) Okay, so he did know what he’d worried about.
“Yes, sir,” JARVIS answered, volume dropping to sixty percent. “It’s currently on Level B-5, in Storage Crate 3, Box 7.”
“Er, unless you’re too busy,” Steve backpedaled.  “I can just bring something down to you if you’re—”
Tony padded over and handed Pepper her favorite, green tea with jasmine.  She let out a little hum a surprised.  “Thank you.”
“Jesus.  Look at you,” Tony said getting up to walk a slow circle around him.  “You’re the pinnacle of masculine beauty.”  Steve wanted to shrug off Tony’s praise.  “You’re like a Michelangelo.  You’d make his David weep.  I mean,
Thank you for reading! My endless thanks to everyone who has stuck with this story and sent me kind words.  Thank you for helping me to keep writing this messy, sprawling thing.
“I could make you feel again,” Tony promised. He raised his hand slowly to cup Steve’s cheek, and stroke his fingers through Steve’s hair, then back behind his ear. It made Steve shiver. (Why was he so sensitive there?) Steve shivered again. (Nobody’d ever touched him there…)
“It’s so nice of you to cook for us like this every Sunday,” Bruce said. “I was thinking I might try taking a day too. Maybe a mid-week breakfast? I mean, nothing this fancy, of course, but—“
Tony had already done all the piecing and pinning on Natasha’s uniform and was about to start stitching.
Tony banked sharply and flew in a little loop. Flying was good for thinking. Or for not thinking. Whatever he needed in the moment, flying was good. Flying was always good.
“Fine,” Tony said, then took a wild guess and added, “Seriously, you know shit in the press doesn’t get to me. You and Cap take it worse than I do.”
“Lawyers, huh?” Steve said, consideringly. “Well, if things go badly, we can keep that in mind.” He shrugged it off, then asked, “But, hey, how did your work go today?”
“Thanks again for the assist,” Steve said with a smile. (A real smile, that reached his bright blue eyes.)
As he walked down the hall, leaving a fuming and blustering Agent Dominick in his wake, Captain America began to whistle.
“Too fucking right,” Tony said. Cap finally took a sip of coffee. They were quiet for a few moments.
Also, I've listened to "Fools Rush In" for YEARS to get in the mood to write this story.  I've had the image in my head Steve leading Tony to that song for SO LONG and it's good to finally get to share it.
, and Howard spent all his time out on that boat looking for the Captain when he should have been spending time with Tony.”
“Tony,” Steve said, affectionate and chiding, “you barely wear your boots in the workshop. Not half as often as you should.”
Steve shrugged and turned to him. “Mom just kinda blinked and then said, ‘I only have white candles for you.’” He smiled, gaze going soft at the memory. “But our friend, Mr. Schultz, brought a beautiful cake, a huge lekach, and he covered it with dark blue candles. He even brought hamentashen for everybody. Not that we needed many; it wasn’t a big party or anything. Just me, mom, Mr. Schultz and . . . Bucky. Father Gabe dropped by too.”
Tony slowly headed for the elevator, but couldn’t shake the feeling he’d still left something unfinished. He paused as the elevator arrived and opened almost silently, then he walked back to the coffee table again. Tony picked up one of Steve’s pencils and his notepad. (He nearly grabbed the sketchbook, but he couldn’t let himself touch it—if he did he’d cave to temptation and look at the whole thing. Whatever the press said, he wasn’t actually a total douchebag.) He flipped to the very back of the small spiral notebook for a blank page and wrote:
Tony reached for his coffee with fumbling hands; it crashed to the floor and the mug shattered. He jumped at the loud noise, heart racing. Dummy beeped sadly and swiveled around his stool, wheels crunching over the broken pottery.
And then he couldn’t hold back—Steve fell on Tony, like he was a magnet drawing steel, sharp and inevitable. Steve pressed his face to Tony’s neck—not quite a kiss, not yet—as he folded Tony in his arms and held him tight. Tony’s body went stiff with surprise as Steve crushed them together.
“Got it.” Tony started a pot of coffee. “I’ve got tons of time! Give me the specs from Malibu, J. And some Iron Maiden.”
Tony kissed him—tongue exploring his mouth, slow and languorous, sucking his bottom lip then nipping at it with his teeth.  Tony kissed him until he was breathless, then pulled away, leaving Steve panting, lips glistening and kiss-swollen.  Tony tipped the glass to give him another sip of port, then pressed their mouths together again, one hand clutching at Steve’s neck, his hair, the other hand roaming across his shoulders, his chest, his side, his hip.  Steve’s clutched at Tony’s sweater, little gasps and moans falling from his mouth.  It was harder and harder to keep still.  Steve wanted so badly to pull Tony’s clothes off, press his aching cock against Tony’s hip, and
"You're smart, kid," Phillips said, then added with a grimace.  "Apart from the disguise attempts, that is."  He took a long sip of wine.  "You're bright.  Determined. Patriotic.  I might be able to give you a chance."
As Steve dragged his cock in and out, Tony kept up a steady litany of praise and filth: “Take me . . . fuck me . . . you feel so good inside me, making me take it . . . Steve, Steve . . .”
Tony dropped to his knees and kissed Steve softly and sweetly on the lips, then unbuckled his belt to release Steve’s wrists.  Tony grabbed a blanket and pulled Steve down onto the cushions next to him.  The blanket was scratchy wool and smelled a little like motor oil, but that didn’t seem like a bad thing.  Steve felt sated and calm and warm.  He let out a deep, contented sigh.
The rug under the couch was rich and plush—the sort of fake fur extravaganza that had been all the rage back in nineteen-ninety-something,  back when a decorator had redone the property in preparation for some wild party Tony’d thrown for a bunch of corporate bigwigs & fuckable friends. (Obie’d suggested that—nope.) It was the kind of rug that screamed ‘for a sexy, naked, kneeling sub!’, but in the end Tony’d never used it.
Tony looked up from his calculations as Dummy whirred over to him excitedly with a piece of paper clutched in his claw.
“Oh God, Steve, you’re killing me. I have a fleet of awesome cars! Usually, I’d send a driver, but obviously, they all have the week off, so I’ll drive you over myself. Parking’s always a mess and I doubt your destination has valet.”
Slow chapter is slow, but extra long!  Infinite thanks to beloved beta, thatwhichyeilds, who patiently let me run through FIVE drafts and rewrites with her.  Also, all the niffty behind the scenes world-building with Katie and Mikie was inspired by her too.  Seriously, somebody get this woman a beer!
Tony threw back his head and laughed. He laughed so hard he wheezed and began to cough. Steve frowned.
“Any other suggestions?” Steve asked. Clint shook his head. Bruce shrugged. “Great! Then I guess we can call it a day.”
“Pfft,” Tony sniffed and waved a hand dismissively. “Clothes. You know I don’t care about that stuff. You decide. Or have Christina figure it out.”
“Thank God, Tony,” her voice sounded pained.  “Don’t scare me like that.  My heart really can’t handle it.”  She exhaled loudly into the phone.  “Now then.  What’s going on?”
Tony wanted to tell the Captain he wasn’t tired, wasn’t going anywhere, and could stay up just as long as a super soldier, but Bruce beat him to the punch saying, “Thank you, Captain. I appreciate it.  Tony?”
“Sure.  We know that.”  Clint shrugged. “And, you know we really don’t give a shit that you’re gay, right?  It’s cool.”  Clint clapped him on the shoulder again and wandered out after Natasha.
And, oh God, he *loved* the way Tony talked to him.  He cheeks were burning.  (Good boy . . .  fuck your mouth . . . hold you down and make you take it. . . .) He grabbed the stylus and took a calming breath.  Did he like it?  Well! :
“Jeeze, you’re really worked up,” Tony murmured softly, more to himself than Steve.  “Baby, I don’t really know where this is coming from and I wanna talk about that in a moment, but first let’s clear something up.”
relationships.  I mean, none of that matters.  I don’t want some stranger telling me how to behave with you and what things mean.  We’re doing this together-- I want
“Nice getting to touch you,” Steve continued in a low voice, still caressing Tony’ back. “I wanted to so badly sometimes when we’d watch
"Very well, Steven," Phillips said.  "I thought this opportunity to serve your country might be of interest, but if this is how you feel, so be it.  I won't trouble you with further details.  I'm sure we'll manage to scrape together an appropriate set of gifts somehow."
Steve took a few steps closer to the creature and said in a clear voice, “My name is Steve Rogers, code name Captain America. This is planet earth. We mean you no harm. Can you understand me?”
. Tony felt a strange sense of shock at the realization; Tyrone was so famous in New York’s business and society scene as something of a timeless lion. His famously blonde-red hair had long since gone white and his posture remained ramrod straight, but his skin was showing the papery thinness of age, lines and creases deep. At Tyrone’s side was a diminutive sub, very attractive, in her mid or late twenties, wearing a modest green sheath dress. (Knee-length, sweetheart neckline.) Even in her heels, she made Tony feel tall. (Huh.)
Steve forced himself to concentrate on the road, trying not to be distracted by the feel of Tony holding him tight, legs straddling the bike, groin pressed up flush with his ass.  Steve’s cheeks heated inside his helmet, imagining Tony in the garage, pushing him down across the handlebars, ripping off his trousers.  (
They opened their menus and Tony was pleased to see a traditional Italian menu: antipasti, primi, secondi, contorni, and dulci. (Maybe the risotto for primo, then--)
Steve pressed soft kisses to Tony’s forehead, his cheeks, his chin, then drew back to give Tony a lazy smile.  Steve pulled Tony close and held him.
“What was it like when you presented?” Tony asked, at once curious and eager to shift attention from himself. “Were you relieved? To be a Dom?”
Tony hadn’t danced with any of his teammates, but he’d seen Nat—and even Clint!—on the dance floor a few times. Bruce had magically disappeared into the crowd (or hidden in the bathroom), but Steve had been on the sidelines all evening, watching the dancers and chatting with anyone who came by. Tony’d seen a string of pretty young subs entreating him to dance, but Steve never set foot on the dance floor.
Steve’s expression went from hopeful to worried in a heartbeat. He immediately backpedalled. “Sorry, sorry. Do you not like--?”
As Tony slid out of the cab, he was struck by a brilliant idea. Something he could do for Steve. (Something he
“Good.” Steve smiled at him. “I—“ He cut himself off to press a kiss to Tony’s lips. Tony propped up on one elbow and grabbed the back of Steve’s neck, pulling him closer, opening the kiss, pressing and teasing with lips and tongue and—
Working on the suit was good. It was always good. Clean and comfortable, a labor of love; part relaxation, part redemption. Meticulous and all consuming. There wasn’t room for anything else.
Steve’s sweet eagerness, the open affection on his face, had soothed even Tony’s most paranoid fears.  And it was a good thing Steve had pounced him when his brain was still off-line—it removed the possibility that Tony would over-think and do something stupid.  And they’d reconnected physically, without any sort of power exchange!  So really, today was a great day to Talk.  Perfect, really.  Better than last night, even if that was when he’d meant to do it.  (Oops.)
With a defiant flick of the wrist, Tony undid the top two buttons of his shirt again and arranged the lapels, leaving his throat exposed. He returned to the table with a swagger and a swish in his step.
Steve started on the buttons and, really, it was silly wasn’t it?  (Tony has seen me naked.  A lot.  He loves my body.
Steve was unwrapping more of the ornaments in the box and handing them out. He gave Bruce a wooden sleigh to hang. Tony paused.
“You're real cute, Cap.”  Tony said with a smirk.  “Just because—”  (--I’m playing with--  No, wait.)  “Just because
Steve stared into the distance for a moment, his face empty; it was the blank expression he used to hide his feelings from the team.  Tony stared helplessly, trying to formulate a response, offer some comfort other than physical affection.  Before he could figure out what to say, Steve shook his head and continued.
Pepper rubbed little circles on his neck with her thumbs, a firm and comforting pressure. “You’re the bravest person I know and I’m so proud of you, Tony.” Pepper’s body was warm and solid against his. Somehow she’d managed to arrange them both so his tubes weren’t pulling and none of his injuries were aggravated. (She was magic like that.)
“My PR rockstars will send you a bunch of open ended questions to get a feel for your comfort levels; it’s some kind of magic—I don’t know how they use them exactly, but the results are genius. Then they’ll be here to do one-on-one conferences and come up with a proposal—then we kick it around with them until we’re all happy.
“Are you ready for your first lesson, baby?”  he asked softly.  “You’re gonna learn to take my cock so I can fuck your face.”  Steve gasped again.  (Fuck!)   Tony kissed him gently on the forehead and whispered, “I’m gonna teach you.  Are you ready?”
Well, there we go!  Got them past that hurdle.  Coming up next more training, more Steve, and going back to New York!
Piaci was much as Tony remembered it--  a pub with bonus pizza rather than an Italian restaurant—but this time, he found himself looking for clues about why Steve had chosen it a second time. In the window, below the shifty-eyed “speak-easy” sign, was a hand written sign that proclaimed in all caps: “cell phones and cameras prohibited.”  The sign looked new.
“That’s good, sweetheart,” Steve said, still stroking his hair. Tony could hear a smile in his voice. “Very good.”
That had humiliated him and he’d vowed not to go back, even when the kind, old professor delicately assured Steve he wasn’t the first model to respond to observation in a physical manner.
“What you did was incredibly brave . . . .” Her words came slowly and Tony could feel himself starting to float ever so slightly. “I know you’ll scoff, Tony, but it was heroic. Truly heroic . . . You saved a lot of people’s lives. I’m proud of you . . . so proud to have you as my friend.”
“Just lemme swing by the kitchen and make a sandwich first,” Tony added with a little glance at Steve.
They stood, side by side, watching as the vibrant red-orange light streaked the clouds and bounced off the snow, then slowly deepened towards purple.
“I know she’s still quite young,” Harry said, “but have you read her work on the geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces? It’s amazing! Took me ages to work my way through it—my graduate studies were a long time ago—but her work is a masterpiece. Honestly, I thought she was passed over last time and her latest work was even stronger. Mark my words: Mirzakhani in 2014.”
And then everything happened at once: a flurry of bullets ricocheted off the creature’s exoskeleton; Cap’s shield went flying, but the creature ducked; the shield bounced off a tree and returned to Rogers like a boomerang; Clint’s exploding arrow (courtesy of one Tony Stark) found its mark and the creature chittered; Natasha was hacking repeatedly at the web with her sharpest knife. Tony launched himself into the air and fired off two repulsor shots—one to burn the web strand (which worked) and one at the creature’s head (effect unclear). It seemed stunned, for a moment—Tony hit it again, while Clint launched another exploding arrow. The creature recovered and charged Widow and the fallen Agent, moving with terrifying speed on all eight legs.
Tony felt his heart twist. “The plan! Agreed. It’s good. I’m not saying we should abandon it, just we could build something that—“
“I like to defy expectations,” Tony said, “sometimes by being punctual.” Tony checked his phone again.  “Later, Harris!”
Tony nodded in satisfaction and called up the Mark VII plans.  He had a few hours to make some progress before his date.
There was already coffee in the coffee pot. Tony poured himself a mug and opened the refrigerator to find it rather bare. (Unsurprisingly, the team had demolished their Thanksgiving provisions.) To his left, Steve set down his coffee and grabbed a pencil, scribbling away.
When the elevator doors parted to reveal Steve carrying their turkey on a giant silver platter, the room burst into applause. (But, no, seriously? Who bought these things?)
“Seriously, Steve, it’s just a rhetorical gesture.”  Tony rolled his eyes and followed Steve.  “It’s a ‘look, I care about my friend and I’ve got his or her back’ kind of thing.  It’s mostly a joke anyway.”
“Yeah.”  Tony swallowed thickly and nodded.  “He is.  And he’s . . . He’s so fucking brave, Rhodey.”  Tony spoke softly, almost surprised to hear the words coming out, but needing Rhodey to understand why he didn’t need to worry, not about Tony.    “Steve came to me.  I’d sort of wondered for a while, with the way he looked at me and sought me out, but I thought I was probably reading it wrong or he didn’t realize—wasn’t aware of the
like Fury did.  He never dropped the full “Mister.”  (Tony’d been half waiting for him to give up on the formality, invitation or no, but he didn’t.  And that . . . that felt curiously like respect.)
“I’m not going to do anything to jeopardize your recovery,” Rogers said solemnly. The atmosphere in Tony’s hospital room changed suddenly. Tony swallowed.
Rogers got under Tony’s skin more than he should.  Sure all the old-fashioned chivalry shit was pretty tedious—and Tony should say something soon—but Rogers seemed to mean well and Tony’d put up with plenty worse.  Rogers took team bonding quite seriously and seemed particularly focused on Tony, but if Tony caught Rogers looking, he’d distribute his attention more evenly and Tony would find himself wondering if it had all been in his head.  So Tony watched Rogers like a hawk—at least until Rogers’ noticed, when Tony’d then pretend he hadn’t been watching Rogers in the least.  Rinse, repeat.
Steve reached out to touch his cheek, turning Tony’s face back towards him, as he gave Tony this unbearably tender look, edged with guilt.  He stayed just like that, gazing into Tony’s eyes for several long, aching moments, then tucked himself down into Tony’s arms again.
The press had been vicious, but the evidence was so ironclad no amount of orientationist bias or victim blaming could save Hanson. Three years in jail and a lifetime restraining order for that asshole.  It was good to be a billionaire genius with in-home security.  And a loyal, omniscient AI as your fairy godmother.
Tony hoped Steve’s research was going better than his was. Ugh. Bruce’s diagrams were all becoming a blur.  (Also, please be sexy research, please be sexy research! Surely that’s what Steve’s rakish smile and husky voice meant, right?)
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
an Avenger in every sense that matters and always have been, even if Fury and SHIELD were slow on the uptake.”
“Mmm?” Tony muttered absently, reaching for one of the meta-transistors and kneeling down to get a better angle.
You’re dreaming if you think that this special sub is a lousy slut like Stark. I wouldn’t blame Cap for banging that bitch, but if you think he’d tell people stark’s his darling special sub, you’re nuts.
Tony frowned at the ridiculous pile of rejected clothes scattered over his bed. He pulled on the black Armani trousers that fit nice and snug, and the red shirt with French cuffs, then ripped off the shirt—the bright red, paired with the tight trousers, made him look a little tawdry for a classy night out.  Burgundy shirt and a conservative blazer.  No, wait—
The TV was on in the common room.  Rogers sat alone in the middle of Tony’s sumptuous leather couch, frowning with concentration (or perhaps disapproval), a small spiral notebook in his left hand, pencil in his right.
“But this isn’t the new normal!” Tony said urgently, already backpedalling and leaning back in his seat. “Still none of that stuff at home, day-in-day-out, and
Originally, I planned to make Christmas one big long chapter, but it was starting to get too unwieldy so I decided to break it down.
“Just, I know you’re Catholic and you’ve never had sex, so I thought maybe you think sex outside of marriage is sinful or something.”
,” Tony whispered.  Steve’s hand tightened, not enough to restrict his air, but enough to be felt--a strong pressure.  “
“And, hey grab me one too, would ya, Steve?” Rhodey asked. “I’m feeling too lazy for the hike to the kitchen.”
Steve nodded and gave Tony a tentative smile.  He took a deep breath, then said, “I’m—I’m gonna go to the bathroom, but then . . . then maybe we could watch
“Well, if God’d bang you, maybe you wouldn’t be an atheist anymore.” Jackie winked. “Keep that in mind the next time somebody has you moaning, ‘
The Captain shook his head. “Only a nasty piece of work like you would treat showing respect for my sub like its something shameful. Tony likes to fight his own battles; I admire that.”
Steve nodded. “Charcoal’s really soft—it’s a very pliant medium—but if you want a drawing to last, you have to treat it. So it was easier to go straight to pencils. I used to go to the Met and do pencil studies of the famous works. Even once we shipped out, I was drawing all the time. Just silly little sketches—you know, of the men or the countryside. Nothing special.”
“May I--?”  Steve swallowed and started again.  “May I have the honor of leading you across the dance floor?”
“Honey, my hands are a mess,” she said, breaking the moment. “Get some ice from the freezer for me, would you?”
The seconds ticked past. Tony stayed on the couch, so far away, just looking at Steve, kneeling on the concrete floor.  Steve fought the urge to squirm.  Naked, kneeling, isolated in the huge expanse of the workshop, with no further instructions on what was expected of him . . . He started to feel almost nervous.  He licked his lips and looked down, breaking eye contact.
.” Pep held up another StarkTablet. “I loaded it with some of your plans for the armor, as well as various relevant interviews and news broadcasts. Ms. Winters would have a fit if she knew you weren’t following the
Steve rose from the couch, picking Tony up with him in a smooth motion, supporting Tony with one arm under his butt, one at the small of his back. (Phew—ok, that was hot… It was like he weighed
“Besides,” Tony said, rejoining the conversation, “we don’t need your technical support. Dr. Banner and I have created a temporary containment unit in case the Hulk has an . . . incident.”
Steve took a deep breath and fetched a glass of water before trying to concentrate on the spreadsheet again.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Tony tuned out the rest of their conversation as he and Bruce watched the readings start to come in. He hooked an extra monitor up to the spectrometer so he could have an extra visual interface with JARVIS.
Steve looked up after a few moments and added, “Pretty sure I’d’ve enjoyed that trip to the Met with you a lot more.”
Steve turned his attention back to Tony.  “No—we didn’t learn any Italian in Home Ec.  I picked it up later on.”
Tony felt off balance again. “You’re welcome?” He hadn’t meant for it to sound like a question. “Seriously, no biggie.”
A small band of Northmen met them on the docks, dressed in full armor and regalia.  They carried standards bearing the emblems of the country and city: the harp and the eagle, and a shield emblazoned with a shining star.  The leader of the party had long brown hair and no left arm.
Steve was giving him that startled look of his: big blue eyes, tight drawn eyebrows. “I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean—“
And Tony should just let her read the damn thing again for a refresher on the rest, but he found himself speaking anyway. Rebecca’s hand was firm and strong, fingers twinning in his hair, and Deetz was still holding his right wrist tightly in one hand.
“What Steve’s trying to say,” Tony cut in deftly, “is that we’ve started dating. We’re letting you know as a courtesy; we’re not asking for your permission or your input. Nothing in our contracts prohibits relationships between teammates and we’re consenting adults. We’re forming our own PR strategy in consultation with Katherine Winters and Michael Nguyen. Again, we’re just informing you as a courtesy.”
them to--   Yes, I realize that . . . Lack of preparedness has cost my team’s scientists valuable data, data that could save lives if the anomaly is hostile.”
“—goose,” Steve finished awkwardly. He paused then said, sounding a little stricken and incredulous, “Chinese food for Christmas dinner?”
“Well, yes,” Bruce said, smiling.  “I have some data sets from the new experiment I ran, but I’m doing the breakdown for the spectrometer data and could use a second set of eyes.”
was their bizarre compromise. There were darts and a pool table in back and Anselm Adams prints in the front, but most importantly the burgers smelled amazing. Clint led the way to a booth in the back near the games. (Tony tried not to be disappointed that he ended up across from Steve instead of next to him.)
Rogers was pounding the punching bag with a ferocity Tony’d never witnessed before. The punches were almost frantic, not the controlled steady blows Tony was used to seeing. The Captain hadn’t broken the reinforced adamantium chain on his boxing bag, but it was looking like a near thing.
“You got me,” Tony said, hand on his heart. “It was a pretext. Besides, why would I learn to cook brunch when I’ve got you?”
Tony watched the team with a steady sense of warmth.  Sometimes it still startled him-- that they’d eventually found a way to fit together like this.
Tony nodded. (Yeah, okay, that was maybe a little manipulative, but whatever. He wasn’t above using all the tools in his box.)
“Have the suit standing by,” Tony called, scrambling down the hall. “But don’t startle him with it! Send it to the floor below.”
.  I want you so bad.  Please, take me.”  Steve was panting into the cushions, words pouring out effortlessly. Tony’s fingers moved in and out, in and out, fucking him and he spiraled higher and higher. . . “Ah!
“You’re pretty close.  It’s the new para-aramid I’m working on.”  Tony took a sip of coffee and kicked his spare wheelie stool.  It rolled its way over to Bruce who looked amused.  “Here—I’ll walk you through it.”
In the late afternoon, Tony went up to the common floor feeling a bit morose and doubly pissy since he knew it was absurd. (Steve’s allowed to have friends. Steve should have friends! And I’m NOT a clingy sub.)
Captain America.”   Rhodey took another sip of his beer.  Tony nodded, conceding the point. They fell into a lingering silence.
Steve let out a long sigh and pressed his hand to his forehead as if he had a headache. He leaned against the column, head tipped back, taking deep breaths. After a few moments, he gave Tony a weak smile.
Tony clenched the pencil, feeling like he should say something more. Something profound. Something . . .
“Come on—I’ll make us coffee,” she said. “And, no, of course I don’t sleep in the armor. I woke up wanting a glass of water. When I went into the hall, I was certain I heard an intruder in the workshop but JARVIS just said, ‘I regret I am unable to answer your question, ma’am.’”
care about PR, okay?” Tony said emphatically, trying not to let his frustration show. Rogers’ hands clenched his coffee cup so tightly Tony wondered if it might shatter in his grip.
Barton nearly did a spit take; laughing and choking in equal measure.  The others looked vaguely disapproving.  And maybe confused.  Rogers looked confused a lot.
Google: “Tony Stark.”  Rogers had started with footage of Iron Man, then Tony's last appearance on The Daily Show and a rant about him by Pat Riley on Fox News.  More footage of Iron Man on youtube and, oh yeah, the CSPAN clip of Tony calling senators ass clowns.
.” The words sounded scornful, a more bitter noise than Tony could remember hearing from Steve.  “Since I couldn’t be a real man, I’d never get a gal; so, I’d better like other men, better like being pushed around, on my knees, tied up.”  Steve’s hand clenched in a fist.  He took a long, deep breath, then said, his voice calm and quiet: “Tony, it was . . .
(Fresh air would clear his head. Right?) Tony tapped absently at the arc reactor. (Fuck it. Who cares
“Mazel tov,” Bruce said, still grinning.  Then he added, looking at Tony over his glasses, “And Tony, please remember in future, *I’m always right.*”
“Okay, brat, you’re on,” Clint said with a grin.  “Where did we leave off last time?  Getting out of a Thompson Hold?”
and writing in his little notebook and I was terrified if I said the wrong thing SHIELD would lock me up instead of letting me go to active duty, when the chance to serve my country again was all I had to keeping me going!”
Tony swallowed. He thought of that photo. It was still in his wallet, not that Steve needed to know that, and Tony found himself picturing Steve back then: five feet tall, thin and fragile looking, standing alone at the edge of the dance floor, watching all the happy couples twirl by.
Tony headed for the workshop. (A pale imitation of his other workshops, but good enough for tinkering.)
“So,” Steve said, looking at Tony with some concern. “Can you tell me what happened at Stark Industries?  I never got a very clear picture from the little, ah, Pepper told me in passing.  Something about ‘R and D’ and cell phones and legal contracts?”
“Reading things into people’s safewords.  It’s like those fake science studies of what your sleeping position means to your relationship, or how your favorite foods predict romantic compatibility or bullshit like that.”  Tony shook his head.  “My safeword is ‘safeword.’ ”
“There he is,” Clint said with a nod at Tony.  (Mmmm.  Chili smells amazing.  Oh yeah, never had lunch…)
(Shit.  You’re supposed to be getting information, not making accusations.  What is it Pepper says?  Open ended questions?)
“So beautiful,” Steve murmured, easing his fingers free oh-so-gently from the hot clutch of Tony’s body. “So gorgeous.”
“Of course,” Steve agreed hastily, hoping he hadn’t given offense.  “I just thought—”  Steve bit the words off.  (-- thought you were spending Christmas with your sweetheart, that you’d gone off to Paris with Ms Potts or something. . . ) “I just hadn’t seen you in a while.”
“What,” Barton asked, still chuckling, “you don’t eat like this for every meal, man? All fancy and shit with your silver spoon?”
Infinite thanks to my beloved long-distance beta, thatwhichyields.  If you like this story and are happy to think it's gonna be a long one, you have her to thank! :-)
—we’re really drunk. Water. You need to water. More. Here. I’m—I’m gonna . . . gonna get you some water.”
“Remember, Rhodey’s mom can’t eat spicy food! Gives her an upset stomach,” Tony reminded Bruce for the fifth time.
“Is that so?” Steve asked with a pleased little smile. He held up a second beer inquiringly and Tony nodded. Steve brought their drinks over to the coffee table and took his seat; Tony immediately curled up on his lap.
The coffee was still steaming, resting on one of those cheesy little keep-warm devices for individual mugs. The coffee smelled a little burnt, but rich and strong.
, but still. . .) There was a certain playfulness to the look Rogers shot him. Tony grinned back. (No, yeah, cool. Definitely teasing.)
“Hey, don’t,” Tony said, waving it away.  “I was happy enough.  Pretty psyched about it, really.  I mean, hey, I was a teenager! I got laid! Seriously, no big deal. But, ah, anyway,” Tony struggled forward, reaching for his wine again.  “Ask Pepper sometime.  She can tell you all about the way that the obsession with virginity is the direct product of a patriarchal society’s obsession with paternity and property.”
He heard her shuffling papers in her lap, the scratch of a pen, but one hand stayed on him at all times, soothing and kind.  Tony felt more rested by this than his ten-hour nap.  He lost track of time.
Tony hadn’t looked Myra Goldstein—let alone her venerable mother—in the face since.  He’d had no right to drag the other gala attendees into his scene like that.  (It wasn’t a play party, for fucks sake!)  He could have been arrested for indecent exposure, not to mention the drugs. Sometimes Tony was sorry Myra hadn’t called the cops, if it could have cut things short.  Maybe there wouldn’t have been so many photos.  Or videos.  (Taken on the revolutionary first generation StarkPhones, of course!)
Jake was pulling a pint at the bar.  He nodded to Steve, then gestured to their table with his chin. Another smaller sign at the bar proclaimed, “Cell phones are a privilege, not a right.”  Tony suppressed a chuckle behind his menu.  When Jake approached the table he automatically brought over breadsticks and a beer—big and blond— for Steve.  He nodded politely.
Banner looked a little overwhelmed, but gave him a nervous smile.  “Uh, that's quite an offer.  And, honestly, I wish I knew what I'm doing here.  But, they said millions of lives were at stake, so--” he shrugged and gave a helpless little smile.  “But, whatever it is, it's a pleasure to meet you too, Dr. Stark.”
Steve generated an insane amount of body heat and the texture of his ridiculous khakis was surprisingly smooth under Tony’s cheek. Steve’s hand settled in his hair, carding his fingers through it gently. Tony tried to relax.
Tony thanked him and bade him goodnight. (Harry Silverstein was totally confused about the proofs of nonlinear Landau damping, but a sweet guy nonetheless.) Tony bit his lip pensively. (Maybe Harry’d like to be a trustee for the mathematics branch of Stark Scholars Fund?)
Tony sighed and put the soldering iron back down, then ran his dirty fingers through his dirty hair.
“I’ve been meaning to ask. After SHEILD found you, did you . . . talk to anyone? I mean, a professional? A therapist?”
Tony stared at them.  Bruce was looking guilty and embarrassed (as he should!), but Rogers was entirely unapologetic.
His mind flipped between memories of their happy panting--full of laughter, fumbling their way to climax--and this afternoon’s disaster.
Really, though! The contract Tony’d sent Steve offered him virtually free reign—pretty much everything was on the menu except scat, sounding, messing with the arc reactor, and trying to put him in sub space.
"I didn't know declining was an option," Bruce had grumbled as he set out with the others, leaving Steve in the living room. Alone.
“Someone asked me earlier if my feelings for you were ‘love at first sight’,” Steve continued quietly, keeping a generous space between them and the other dancers. “I realize now they weren’t.  I mean, it felt like it back when we met; I was so smitten. But my, uh, therapist is right. I didn’t love you then--I didn’t even know you. I loved the idea of you. But now--now I
Rogers shrugged. “Didn’t always look like this,” he said mildly. “Besides, I’d expect you to know better than to judge by appearances.”
He could, but he wasn’t going to. He was going to go in there and work out and maybe have a little chat with the Captain.
Tony just shook his head and smiled at Steve over the rim of his mug. He took several long gulps and sighed, grateful that Steve made his joe like a man who remembered and
Tony yawned; he’d slept in. He really shouldn’t be surprised—he’d been on the phone with Pepper until nearly 5 am.   11 am meant he’d missed brunch with the team—Steve always made them brunch on Sundays—but perhaps it was just as well. What would he have said?
Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s ass and gave him a little nip, then bit and sucked.  Tony added another finger, and Steve let out a long, deep moan at the stretch.  Tony bit down harder and Steve’s cock jerked and a jolt of pleasure ran through his body.  Tony spread his fingers wide, pulling him open, then pressed in and out, in and out.  He touched
“Well, if you throw a small army of total strangers at him, I know how it will go and it won’t be a training exercise anymore.  Have you even read your own research, let alone ours?  The goal is trust.”
“Fair enough, Dr. Banner,” Dominick said with a shrug, still looking only at Bruce.  “What have you and Stark come up with?”
God, Tony hated SHIELD: hated the macho posturing; hated the smell of industrial disinfectant; hated the bad lighting that made him look old and sad; hated Agents 004-099 who stared at his ass. (It was a great ass, but still.)
“Yeah, well.  I’ve got a reputation.”  Tony shrugged.  “And I’m older-- I’ve *lived more,* gotten more experience, all of that.”   Tony started past Steve, heading for his garage dock.  Steve reached out to catch Tony’s hand.
Steve was still frowning, but it looked at more pensive than pained. He’d stopped trying to pull away.
The team wordlessly sprang into action, acting in perfect concert: Bruce stopped the movie; Clint fetched two beers from the fridge; and Natasha grabbed two more bowls for popcorn.
They stared at each other. The silence stretched on for a few long moments while Steve fumbled for something to say, trying not to be unnerved by her expression.
Tony winced inwardly and made a mental note to talk about that with Cap later. (Seriously, ew.  ‘Inverted’ went out around the same time as ‘negro.’) But now wasn’t the time.
I meant that literally, babe.  I’m totally hard.  (And remember, since the dawn of time, cock jokes, etc…)  You’re quite distracting.  And your notes are hot.  So—dirty talk?  What’s vague?  Help make it not vague for me, sweetheart.
“All ready?” Steve asked, smiling as Tony approached.  (Damn, he looked good!)  Steve was wearing a fitted blue dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and Tony had never been more grateful that he’d introduced Steve to his tailor—I mean, *nobody* is built like Captain America, so it’s not like ready-to-wear clothes fit him at all.
Tony’d been so certain that he was going to bed alone—and telling himself firmly that it was fine—it took a moment for his brain to catch up with Steve’s words. Steve was already filling Tony’s surprised silence with his backpedalling: “But if not, that’s fine.  I won’t be offended if you’d rath—“
He hadn’t expected to skim with Steve last night. Even if they’d had sex he’d have been surprised to skim the top of subspace like he had. (It was the closest he got to subspace since—) Tony took a deep breath. (No.)
The line was silent for a moment, then Rhodey said expansively, “Soooo what’s this I hear about Christmas celebrations in Stark Tower? Courtesy of one Tony Stark, atheist?”
“Mr. Nguyen’s Catholic too.” A pause, then Steve said, “Did you know over thirty-five percent of Vietnamese-Americans are Catholic? I didn’t know that.” He admitted a little sheepishly, “I’d assumed he was Buddhist.”
Steve bobbed his head, sliding his mouth up and down Tony’s dick, loving the feel and taste of it in his mouth, against his tongue.
And so, while Tony ate a truly outstanding breakfast, he explained some of the potentialities of the Bob data and how he’d been playing with it. From there, Rogers asked about Stark Industries, Tony’s inventions, and, of all things, how cell phones actually worked.
“That’s the plan,” Clint said.  He grabbed two more slices and headed over to the gigantic expanse of patent leather.
Tony took a deep breath and steeled himself. There would be people there he knew and disliked, and people he didn’t know yet, but would dislike, but there were still a few he knew and liked—so perhaps there would be some he didn’t know and would like? And, with a little more luck, Tony might get lucky and not leave with the rest of the group . . .
It had felt like lying, earlier.  (It was.)  It had felt like shame.  Like he was ashamed of Tony, of himself.  Of
it was, but decided it didn’t really matter anyway. Whatever the answer, he felt pretty sure it was time to get out of the workshop for a bit. (See? Pep? Bruce? Life-work balance, right here!)
Tony let out a squawk of indignation and a torrent of invectives. Bruce joined in and they were off and running.
happy to see him, but it felt so hideously awkward. But not just awkward—gross, like he was some disgusting parasite, swooping in to use their tragedies and hardships to make himself feel like a good man, not just another rich asshole. Like he was showing up to collect his due of gratitude and groveling. To force himself on their consciousness and remind them just who paid for what, and whose house that was, just by being there, no matter what he actually said or did.
“Why do you ask? Everything’s fine! Great. Sorry I never answered.” Tony’s hand tightened on the bottle. “I’m just gonna go—uh, check on him.”
“Yeah.” He stroked Steve’s hand and added, “You know it’s okay to be nervous? Most people are. And, well, if somebody
Steve shrugged. “You’re fine. We’re not on a deadline or anything. Here! Come see what Nat and I got at the Christmas market.”
“Hey, Tony?  Do you know if--  Oh!”  Steve was standing in the doorway that connected to the house, frozen with surprise.
(7:30?  How the hell did it get so late?  I can’t have nodded off for more than twenty minutes or so…)
Steve’s aching cock pressed against Tony’s stomach and Tony’s whole body was hot and solid against him as Steve held him tight. Steve breathed in deep, taking greedy lungfuls of Tony, who melted slowly in his arms, the tension leaving his muscles.
“That’s true,” Nat said calmly.  “But we’re talking about Tony.  He wasn’t an employee and we weren’t--” She paused.  “We weren’t a team yet.”
“Delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Silverstein,” Sasha said, dropping his eyes and glancing up through his lashes.
“What?” Steve’s head snapped back over to Tony, frowning and unamused. “Fence? Babies? What are you talking about?”
Of course, she wouldn’t have such glowing things to say about Tony. His heart was already starting to speed up with nerves, knowing he wouldn’t like whatever she’d worked up for the Stark Terror and knowing even more definitely that he had to keep his cool.
,” Tony said.  “I’ve just been waiting for you to be cleared for active duty to smack you around again.  Wouldn’t have wanted to start an unfair fight.”
It only took Tony four hours to get to Malibu in the suit. Initially he was just out for a fly to clear his head, but the thought struck him after about twenty minutes looping around the Statue of Liberty that he hadn’t checked on the LA office in a long time. And Pepper would probably appreciate a friend after what sounded like a challenging Christmas. And he’d left some projects in the Malibu workshop. And the weather would be fantastic; no snow or ice in Malibu.
"What?  No," Tony said, urgently and a little too loud, "no, thank you.  For telling me about him.  Don't--"  Tony reached out and grabbed Steve's hand; he startled at the touch, but when Tony squeezed, he squeezed back.  "Don't be sorry. I'm glad you told me."
Steve’s hesitation about going out seemed a bit more understandable, but now it seemed all the more important. Tony hurried into his winter things and grabbed an extra scarf before taking the elevator to Steve’s floor.
“You mean late.”  Tony sauntered into the kitchen.  He went straight for the coffee machine and poured himself a cup.  “I went to the workshop after Rhodey left.  Haven’t made it to bed yet.”
“Nice work, team!” Steve said, beaming at them.  The bastard wasn’t even sweating, despite their grueling training session.
Tony’d seen the pictures, read about the suicides: 67%. Howard had been a bit of a shit, but surely he hadn’t actually been that evil. Right?
EDITED TO ADD: June 21--Well, so much for speedy updates!  Turns out moving across the country for a new job is lots of work and having visitors makes it hard to write.  All the usual--story not abandoned, your kind words VASTLY APPRECIATED, etc--and I hope to have more soon(ish).  More blather about my life (and my cat!!!) available here:  http://ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com/post/162160625556/rl-update-pp-delays-big-suprise.  Thanks so much for your love and your patience!
“Tony!” Pepper cried in alarm when he set down at the landing pad later that evening. “What’s wrong?”
Then he pulled Tony to his feet by the ropes at his wrists, spun and pushed Tony onto the bed. With a speed and strength that left Tony rather breathless, Steve hauled him into position, tied his wrist leads to the headboard, then pulled him down the bed until he was fully stretched out, arms high above him. Steve had never manhandled him like that before.
Added July 5th:  There was some concern earlier that the story is now over.  Don't worry!  The story is definitely NOT over--far from it!  They have to date.  And figure things out.  And I promised you kinky sex, remember?  And there's more Avengers plot.  So, yeah, far from over.  Unless, you know, y'all have lost interest...  (Okay, I said that like a joke, but I've kinda worried that everybody would be 'over it' once they kiss.  So yeah.)  But THERE'S LOTS MORE!!!!
This section of Sexology is lifted VERBATIM from the actual book of the same title.  In addition to having tons of insane, absurd, and offensive views of sex and gender, one of the book's main goals was to prevent marital rape and educate young turn-of-the-century men about consent. It's a fascinating and (at at times) infuriating read!
“That really says more about you than me, handsome,” Tony said.  “Most of the Dom’s I’ve dated got a fancy watch they could sell for a few thousand after the break-up.”
“Definitely!” Tony hesitated a moment before suggesting an obvious solution—he wasn’t sure what they’d thought of it in the 1930s. But he had to say: “If you want, though, I’d be very happy to hire you a top notch personal trainer who could—“
It seemed like she was watching the film, but her eyes kept flicking away to check the windows. And the door. (Her seat had the best view of all points of entry, and that wasn’t seeming coincidental.) And when her eyes weren’t glancing from the screen to the entries, she was casting little glances at the others. Watching them as Tony had been. Mostly Clint, but Cap and Bruce as well. And Tony too, he guessed, though he never caught her at it.
Mrs. Rhodes reached up to touch Tony’s cheek through the faceplate and said seriously, “You look after James out there, you hear?”
Tony nodded and took a deep breath, trying to expel the disjointed dream. He took stock of himself. He was fine, though a little sweaty, with crick in his neck from slumping over at his desk. (He really should try to make it to the couch if he’s gonna—Oh right.)
“Hey,” Tony said gently. “That’s no reason you have to put up with whatever shit they’re throwing your way though. What’s going on, babe?”
The modifications on Natasha’s Bite had been going well—just a little more work on the plans and he could start safely putting together the prototype.  Probably.
Tony was pretty sure that Fury chose the farthest conference room on purpose, though whether as an intimidation tactic (making them trail after him as long as possible, damn it) or to give Bruce time to calm down (sensibly enough), Tony wasn’t sure.
(Shivering, curled in a little ball, muttering, “so stupid . . . I’m sorry, I’m sorry . . . stupid, stupid, stupid.”  “Sir?  Sir!?  SIR!?”)
“And you!  I watched your Colbert interview.  Powerful stuff. You did a lot of good for people by speaking out like that.”
Then Steve poured a glass of water from the pitcher on the dresser and took a long drink. Tony watched his Dominant’s notch bob.
Tony stood in the middle of the common room like a maestro, surrounded by the glowing screens of his videoconference call: Linda Preston and Jonathan Chen from legal on the left, Katherine Winters and Michael Nguyen from PR on the right.
They waited in companionable silence for the kettle to boil.  Then once the tea was steeping, Bruce asked, “Would you like my advice?”
Steve felt a little unsteady as he walked to Tony’s bedroom in the penthouse.  (Coward.  You couldn’t even hold his hand.  Even though you wanted to.  Pathetic.)  Steve took off his shoes and socks and, after a moment’s consideration, left them tucked off to the side of Tony’s sleek black dresser.  (It was just a kiss.  Nobody was even looking.  Coward.)  He unbuttoned his shirt.  (No, it’s okay.  Tony said it was okay.)  He folded his shirt and left it on top of the dresser.  (It’s early.  It will get easier.  “
Steve bit his earlobe then sucked on it, still stroking Tony’s sensitive nub with light fingers. Tony whined.
As Tony stepped onto the common floor that evening, he could hear Natasha saying, “I thought you were pulling my leg.”
“Wasn’t sure the armor’d fit after all those potatoes,” Rhodey joked, but his voice was tight and nobody laughed.
“Hey hey,” Tony said. “Just down in the workshop and was suddenly thinking maybe you’d like to come down and draw? If you’re not busy. Or, actually, I’m at a stopping place, so maybe we could do something? Go out?”
Breakfast passed in pleasant, casual chatter: mostly Steve and Bruce, mostly on the subject of food, with occasional additions from Tony and Natasha. Tony’d expected Clint to begin ribbing them immediately and to keep up a merciless string of teasing; he was surprised to find Clint serious, distracted with the newspaper, eating his frittata quietly.
Tony approached the alien on the ground. It solidified its resemblance to Steve—this time it had a line for a mouth—and when Tony got into position it put one tentacle around him. Up this close, Tony could see that its entire body was covered in teeny-tiny suckers, like the bottom of an octopus’ arm.
Once he’d recovered, Tony shook his head.  “Just surprised me a little there.  But to answer your question,”  Tony gave an indifferent shrug, “Just depends on how you define sex, I guess.”
Tony felt no shame ogling his Dom’s fantastic ass while he made another omelette and wondered how the fuck he’d gotten so lucky.
“I didn’t stop to wonder until years later, if maybe that ‘punched in the gut’ look on his face wasn’t just shock when he saw the blue candles.”
“Nice.”  Harris kept chuckling and shook his head. “Meetings I don’t mind; it’s the paperwork that kills me.”
UPDATE: June 24th    I've been trying to post every 10 days or so, but it looks like chapter 26 is going to be a bit behind schedule.  Life has been pretty busy--mostly my job--and I need to make sure that I draft or outline at least four or five chapters ahead before posting 26 so I don't accidentally write myself into a corner.  Sorry for the delay!  Never fear--I'm not on the verge of hiatus or anything.  See you soon!
“Oh.”  Tony frowned.  (“Manners won’t kill you, Tony,” Pepper’s voice admonished.) “Sorry I woke you.”
He lingered a moment before turning and walking up the stairs to the penthouse. He didn’t have to look back to know that Natasha waited in the stairwell until he was all the way to the top.
Still, Steve got a jolt when he stripped off the plain brown paper to find the picture of a penis on the box. (
For a moment it looked like Dominick was going to follow Steve or try to get into it with the lingering Avengers, but Johnny gestured pointedly at his watch and announced, “We’re sorry we can’t linger.  Agent Dominick and I have another meeting in a few minutes.  Best of luck with your training, Avengers.”
Nobody moved. Nobody spoke. Tony’s blood thundered in his veins. The creature remained entirely still in the haunting light of the portal still crackling and spitting above them. Tony glanced up at it nervously.
interesting.  I’ve done a bit of reading.  And if you don’t mind going slowly, sometimes I think I could get at least part of it.”
, and maybeClint said he was a bit of a nag and a mother hen, and okay fine, so he-- (wants to get fucked long and hard...)-- none of that, it didn't . . . didn't make him a woman. Er, widow. Not that those things are
Little by little, Tony worked his way down Steve’s body, caressing his chest, his ribs, his stomach.  He paused, hovering over Steve’s cock, before lavishing attention on Steve’s hipbones, nipping and sucking first one then the other.  Steve tried to hold still, but his body shuddered and jerked eagerly under Tony’s attentions.  His movement pulled at the restraints—Steve moaned.
“You can’t just kneel to get out of talking to me,” Steve said, low and vehement.  “When we fight, we fight.  We talk--like this.  Equals.”
“Come here,” Tony said and guided Steve to the couch next to him.  Steve glanced down at the carpet by Tony’s feet, a quick darting look, before turning to Tony with a little smile and obediently sitting where he’d indicated.
“The patron saint of the lost? I guess that makes sense,” Colbert says kindly. “After all a miraculous survival and seventy years on ice--it’s a lot to take in. What has been the hardest thing for you adjusting to the future? I mean apparently we have aliens falling from the sky now. And Jersey Shore and the Kardashians.”
“You don’t really seem fine,” Tony said hesitantly. “What’s the matter? Maybe I could . . . help?” (Ugh. Didn’t mean for it to sound so uncertain.)
“Good,” she said with satisfaction. “Would you be free for a meeting sometime soon? Tomorrow perhaps?”
“What did I say?” Clint called as he strode across the garage to rejoin them.  “Was I right or what? Also, I want a hot dog.”
“No! No need. I’m here,” Tony protested. “I was in the groove and, well, I’ve gotten kinda good at ignoring JARVIS sometimes without really knowing I’m doing it. I just—see, the top thread kept breaking and it was driving me crazy, and then the bobbin was getting tangled all the time!”
for me to talk about that, but I’m glad I did.  I feel better and I’m glad you know.  About the way I felt.  Before.” Steve leaned closer, eyes wide and such a bright blue, “I don’t want there to be any secrets between us.  Ever.”  He dropped his head and looked up at Tony from under long lashes, his smile a little sheepish.  “And I promise to read the books you give me.  I—”  he squeezed Tony’s hand.  “I never want to worry you again.”
Tony took a deep breath and held Steve a little tighter, resting his head against Steve’s chest as Steve gathered him in his arms. Steve pressed his cheek to the top of Tony’s head and just held him quietly for a few minutes. Tony could hear his heartbeat.
My new job is about to explode with extreme crazy, but hopefully I'll still find time to write.  Do please PLEASE cheer me on if you can by telling me if there's stuff you especially liked in this chapter.  Musings, curiosity, and predictions about future chapters also welcome.  Basically anything to tell me that helps remind me to live in this world from time to time is a huge help.
Tony shook his head. “Look, people already know I fund the Safehouse, and that’s as close as I want it. I’m not gonna use them to polish my image.”
Tony snorted—the sound echoed loudly from under the spectrometer.  “Uh, yeah. No,” Tony said, tightening the A-34 nut with a satisfying pull. “It’s not exactly a ‘flip that lever’ or ‘push a big red button’ situation.  I’ll do it myself.” Tony double-checked the alignment on the B-33s and C-8s.  Good.
of course—it was a subsidiary endowment that Howard had set up), SHIELD hadn’t bothered to inform him yet.  Not that it mattered—Tony had seen plenty by hacking into their database and, okay, some traffic cameras and security footage.  (Hey, if they cared about their privacy, they’d have better encryption.  Besides, the traffic cameras were in
“Steve kept me calm,” Bruce said at last. He swallowed thickly. “He reminded me that you might come back through and need me sane to ‘help with the science’” Bruce sounded gently amused at that, but as his voice went serious as he continued: “or to act as a doctor. Turned out it was a bit of both.”
Romanov.  Natasha.  She was . . . acceptable.  She’d clearly taken Tony’s words to heart.  She gave him a lot of personal space, more than anyone else, and never snuck up on him—though she seemed to delight in startling her fellow Doms. Tony hadn’t forgiven her and he certainly didn’t trust her, but it was getting easier to be around her and not have double vision.  Natalie had been someone Tony liked, someone he thought he might want to be friends with or at least mentor; he was still sorting out how much of that was an act for her mark, and how much was actually Natasha.  Nat?  He’d figure it out eventually.
(Huh.) Apparently, Captain America also used his phone as a way to avoid eye-contact and deflect attention; as he lingered outside Gym B, Rogers fiddled with his phone, frowning with concentration, and the junior agents who began to approach (with wide eyed veneration) lost their nerve and filtered down the hall.
Tony had started to take short, fast little breaths as his thoughts spun round and round.  He closed his eyes and focused on the warmth of Steve’s body against his, tried to take deep even breaths, synchronizing his breathing with Steve’s.  (He’s right here.)
Tony tensed, arched, and came shooting pulse after pulse of hot cum into Steve’s wet mouth.  (Oh, oh!  He’s swallowing, he’s--!)  Something hot spattered against Tony’s thigh and it was hard to breathe and everything was white and blinding with pleasure.
“Steve--” Tony's voice sounded wrecked. (Oh fuck. Fuck.) “I--” Steve looked down at him, expression soft, but there was something sad lingering there at the edges of his gentleness. “About earlier--”
“Look, I’ve worked a lot with chemical compounds and, okay, I’ll admit that this one won’t actually knock him out, but it might just slow him down, so all we need is to rig an administrating device that--”
“Excuse me? Mr. Stark?” Big, Tall and Handsome said turning down his smile a few watts to be within the realm of normal. His teeth were perfectly straight and very white. Tony looked at him impassively. “I can’t believe we’ve never met before,” the man continued. “If I may?” Big, Tall and Handsome extended his hand and introduced himself: “Thomas Belford, CFO of Prima Corp LLC.”
Morning chit chat had never been Tony’s strong suit, so he leaned over and gave Steve a long, lingering kiss.
“We skipped dessert at Piaci, so I thought I’d serve it here.”  Tony took a little sip from the elegant blown glass, closed his eyes for a moment to savor it, then brought the cup to Steve’s lips.
Even knowing how ridiculous it was, Tony still couldn’t quite make eye contact. He cleared his throat and added, “So, yeah, not liking the cold. I get it.”
“Holy shit!” he repeated closing in on the fellow scientist who was sitting nervously at the conference table in an appalling paisley shirt.
“Mmmm?” Steve murmured.  (And was that just a vocalized sigh or was he trying to say something?  ‘cause it’s totally unclear.)  Steve reached out to pull Tony’s arm around him-- Steve wanted to be little spoon.
“Oh sure! Of course,” Steve said with a nod, “I mean, it doesn’t have to be right this minute. Maybe a little later?”
“Sure, whenever. And, let me know when you decide what you want to order. I’ll help you figure out ordering online and stuff.”
“Attention!” Cap called into the comm. “The spiders can jump. Repeat, the spiders can jump—twenty feet in the air at least. Three spiders leapt the perimeter and are headed for midtown. Repeat, headed for midtown.”
“Yeah, no.  I’ll just build one. It’ll be way faster than waiting for them to argue about it and then deal with paperwork.” (Oh shit.) Bruce looked pretty damn impressed and it made Tony’s heart race just a little more.  (Fuck, don’t blush. Too soon for that.  Shit.)  “JARVIS? Reach out to Pepper—tell her I’m gonna need some of the materials from Hangar 27 stat.”
Tony frowned and inched forward to peer at Steve’s papers. They were reports on the Battle of October 1
, glorious and gorgeous in his suit, but under the surface Tony could see the scrawny guy in that black and white picture: the guy who didn’t have a fella, couldn’t get a dance. It was so achingly obvious that
Steve frowned down at his bowl, then sighed and started cutting the chicken into bites at the counter.
Pepper was always tall; in the Leboutins she loved, though, she positively towered. Somehow, Tony found that reassuring. He took a little side step closer.
“I saved you some bacon. Because I’m nice like that,” Clint said, looking up from the paper. Bruce snorted into his tea and Clint added, “Bruce and Nat were gonna eat it all!” Steve let out an exasperated huff.
Not sure I got this chapter to do exactly what I was aiming for, but I doubt obsessing over it will actually lead to further improvement at this point.  So here it is.  AT LAST!!!
Up in his suite he hastily changed into his workout clothes and then perched on the edge of the bed, tablet balanced across his knees.
“Hey, Cap?” Tony said, voice a little hoarse. He cleared his throat and held out one of the glass balls. “Trade you?”
He definitely needed a shower. His hair was a mess and his eyes still looked a smidge bloodshot. His tank top was gross and sweaty and—
to just sit around while you train. Pepper could use the help, I could use the change of scene, and you can tell me when I’m out of the doghouse.”
Tony forced a smile and made his way down the hall towards the sunroom.  He almost slowed his usual pace, but knew that would just annoy Rhodey, so instead he called, “Come on, honeybadger.  Keep up!”
Tony’s coverage ranged from neutral to glowing, along with the others, but Captain America was their golden boy, their beautiful darling and the bulk of the coverage was devoted to him.
“Creepy Bob?” Tony said after a moment to recover.  “Bobby C? Not bad.”  He caved to temptation and grabbed Bruce’s coffee too.  Rogers made no protest.  “Not bad,” Tony repeated. He drained the last of the coffee, tossed the cups, and turned back towards the adjustor.
“Yeah.”  Tony’s voice was a little rough.  He toyed with his empty glass and he should probably stop talking, but the words were spilling out anyway.  “I mean, it’s still hard on him, you know?  He’s okay in the Tower—it feels safe, I guess.  But in public it’s still . . . tough.  And he hates that, I can tell—he beats himself up for it every time he’s shy, but he’s trying and he’s so good to me.  And just—”  Tony waved his hand for emphasis. “--
“Good,” Fury said.  “Working with a team, getting really comfortable with them, will be crucial to that endeavor.  That means lots of training exercises as well as personal proximity.  It will be hard to forge that kind of bond as a unit if you’re commuting from another location.  We’d like you all to live together on base.”
Tony cracked the beer first, vaguely surprised Rogers had brought him one, and raised it with a little salute.
JARVIS killed the zombies and Tony touched down with Rogers still under his arm.  The faceplate flipped up automatically on landing, so Tony heard with his own ears Rogers’ breathless, “That was
Tony opened the refrigerator and pulled out roast beef and cheddar. He put two slices of sourdough in the toaster, then thought better of it and added two more. Tony started slicing a tomato.
Tony nodded with satisfaction. (Okay. The problem was balancing processing speed and energy expenditures. If he wanted a single charge to last twelve hours then—)
Tony stalked his prey quietly, wanting the element of surprise.  He realized as he drew near, though, that Rogers was speaking into his comm.
“Justin K in Baltimore asks: ‘“With Valentine’s Day right around the corner, I’m wondering if there’s there a special submissive in your life?”
Pepper took a deep breath and continued: “When Samia told me, she said I was basically the godmother to dozens of babies by now, or should be since these reforms have helped so many people start their families.” Pepper was talking faster and faster, the way she did when she was upset. “And then Aunt Maggie called and then Jeremy texted me and I—“
On day four, Steve was reading near the coffee again when he heard voices approaching from the elevator; he tried to focus on his book. (Act normal.)
“I’ve gotta . . .go,” Tony said with a vague gesture, not looking at Clint or Natasha before retreating to his workshop once more.
Rogers sank to the floor, knees pressed to his chest. And it was strange—he looked smaller like that somehow, huddled in on himself. Not Captain America, just
Tony didn’t tell Steve that these drawings of his—‘nothing special’—were on display in the Smithsonian.
Sorry there was so little Steve!  And no date and no sexy times.  But, you know, Tony has other friends and does other stuff and has a life and so on . . . . so yeah.  And he needed some time to make plans.  More world-building about international and historical kink to come!  (And some racism-rebuttal!)  And, you know, also a second date.  Anyway, hope you liked this . . .
Tony bit his lip and frowned at the schematics. He couldn’t get the capacitive touch screen and the ink display’s negative charge particles to function in such close proximity. Maybe if--
,” Tony told them distractedly. He was watching Steve. He could tell, even with Steve’s back to them, the way his shoulders had drawn tight.
to Steve.) Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist and couldn’t resist rolling his hips a little, getting some much-desired friction.
“It’s Warren Buffet, isn’t it? I’ll destroy Berkshire-Hathaway!”  Tony paused dramaticaly, then asked, “Or is it the genius part? ‘cause Stephen Hawking isn’t as smart as people think he is! Neither’s Selvig!”
The pressure was building, tighter and hotter, in Tony’s gut as he twisted in his bonds, gasping a helpless litany of “Steve . . . Steve. . . Steve . . .”.
“Damn,” Tony mumbled into his glass.  “You know what I’m doing and why even when I don’t  know what I’m doing or why.  That’s more than a little terrifying, you know, Ms. Potts.”
Sometimes, though, he’d glance up to find Steve already looking at him with that soft, affectionate little smile.
“No, no! I’m honored,” Harry said hastily. “It’s just unexpected. I’d love to be involved. Perhaps,” he hesitated, “we could talk about it more over dinner tomorrow night?”
—but it was injured and didn’t get far. Widow dodged its remaining legs as they shot out at her and left a throwing knife in its eye; Clint pin-cushioned it with arrows, managing to pierce the exoskeleton at point blank range; and Cap bludgeoned it with his shield, finally smashing its head, then decapitating it. Its legs spasmed and Tony struggled free.
“No! It’s fine! I can feel it: I’m on the edge of a breakthrough. But now, I’ve gotta, yeah—just gotta take care of something.”
“Nope!” Tony answered, popping the ‘p’. “Not busy in the least, O light of my life! O Pepper of my soul! Oh Mistress of the Universe! So, uh, what’s new?”
“Why’s it all or nothing with you?!” Steve asked with frustration, running his fingers through his hair and shaking his head, clearly agitated.
Tony wasn’t sure if he felt relieved or disappointed. On the one hand, it looked like they were nine minutes shy of a full reading, but on the other hand they weren’t battling aliens and probably wouldn’t be for at least a little while. So that part was good.
“What? No!  Tony, you can’t wear the Iron Man helmet instead of a proper motorcycle helmet.  Absolutely not!”
With a sharp little turn, Tony kept Steve from bumping into the Dom who’d just strode towards them with purpose. He was a big, broad, muscle-clad mass; like a brunet version of Steve. (But nothing like Steve.) Gorgeous and he knew it. He tapped Steve on the shoulder and Tony brought them to a halt, letting the other couples glide past them.
“Steve? Before I open that, I have a confession,” Tony blurted out, almost sloshing his coffee over the rim of his mug and then clutching it to himself defensively. “I didn’t know what to get you. But I tried! Hey JARVIS? Give me the shopping tabs!”
“So,” Tony said after a long moment, “you’re saying I should wear steel-toed boots in ballrooms as well as the workshop.”
Tony backed away from the sight, suddenly uncomfortable with a horrid jumble of emotions: possessiveness (Rhodey’s
“I’ll try not to, thanks,” Bruce said with a wry smile.  He waved at the schematics.  “So, what’s all that? Looks like you’ve been testing tensile strengths.”
“Answer me,” Steve insisted in a soft voice, squeezing down on Tony’s wrists. Tony nodded emphatically.
Steve smiled and shifted up for a kiss.  “I’m really lucky too,” Steve told him, looking into his eyes and willing Tony to see, to understand how deeply he was loved.
Just the feeling of opening his mouth wide for Tony’s cock was amazing.    (Oh, fuck, yes.)  Steve mouthed at the head caressing it with his lips for a moment.  Tony’s precum tasted bitter and a little salty. Steve moved forward eagerly. He tried to go slowly but on his first attempt he gagged and jerked back, then pressed forward again, determined.  He gagged again.
Tony was still gasping and heaving as Steve lifted his head, a dazed expression on his face and Tony’s cum leaking from the corner of his mouth.
