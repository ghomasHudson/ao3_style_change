“You’re a good boy, aren’t you, Dummy? Yes, you are,” she cooed at it, the bot beeping in what could only be described as delight.
It took a moment, but Steve was able to decipher the loops and swirls before him into sense, and he realised that they were personal notes about somebody’s life. Flicking through the book, it was more of the same. All the way until the final filled in page, still many from the last within the book, that spoke of the hope the ships’ crew had that they’d find a home at the end of their trip. The trip that none of them would survive.
Thor grinned widely at his arrival from where he’d set up a beach chair on the ramp, complete with a yellow parasol to keep the light of the two suns’ from burning his skin.
Still, old and small as a Skiff was, it was more than a match for The Avenger if they caught up to them.
He heard Natasha curse over the comm line.
Jarvis reached out and clasped Tony’s shoulder firmly, a serious look on his face.
“He’s amazing, Tony,” Steve said in awe, and Tony felt his cheeks warm.
Tony shrugged off her hands and took a step backwards, uncomfortable with the weight of feelings now filling the room. There was something in her eyes that made his skin crawl, and the urge to bolt from the room was only suppressed by years of practice.
“Right, let’s get ready then.” Steve pushed himself to his feet as the others followed suit, Thor pausing to give Jane a quick kiss.
“Poor you,” Darcy was unsympathetic to his plight.
“Wha’s hap’n?” he asked groggily, pushing himself half upright on his forearms.
Tony finally tells Steve the truth of who he is, and the next adventure begins. Also, a chicken.
The intergalactic war had been hard on many planets and their people. The government had fed everyone a steady diet of misinformation that, until it had been too late, Steve had blindly followed. He’d believed so much in the honour and justice of the government, that he’d signed up to fight those that were resisting. He had risen in the ranks, right up to the command of Captain, without questioning anything.
“N-no,” she giggled. “You looked like an idiot. I bet Rhodey agrees with me.”
“Apparently, it’s brooding,” Jane said, eyes firmly locked on the scientific journal on the table before her, but Tony knew the woman was smiling.
“The time is almost six in the evening. Young Miss Darcy is requesting your presence for dinner soon, Sir.”
Tony felt his heart swell at those words. He’d never had a best friend before. In fact, he’d never really had a friend. Sure, there was Jarvis, but while the man always made time to speak with him and was happy to listen about his newest projects, he was also there to do a job and had many chores and things to oversee on a daily basis. There were the kids at his school, as well, but they were always more interested in the fact that he was a Stark.
“You figured it out, though,” Tony said confidently, knowing there was no other way she could find it amusing than if she’d figured it out fairly quickly.
There was a tense moment of silence, before the coms system crackled to life.
“When did you have time to get a shrink’s assessment of you?” Darcy asked with a snort.
– motherfucker
“Yes, Sir. I took the liberty of ordering some coffee to be delivered to the workshop floor while you were sleeping.”
“I’d expect nothing less,” a sudden grin broke out on her face.
Looking out over the huge insects that were currently chewing on various objects in the street, from a car to a lamppost, Tony spared a brief moment to wonder how, exactly, this was his life.
Although, maybe it was time for him to visit Japan or something? He was sure Pepper would have some menial task on another continent that he could do.
Brought out of his dark musings about failed relationships, Tony looked up to see Steve setting down a coffee cup in front of him. Reaching for it immediately, he breathed in the familiar scent of coffee beans and boiled water, with just a hint of milk and sugar, before taking a sip and enjoying the burn as it slid down his throat.
Finally, Natasha appeared from the never-ending stream of people passing by, the darkening sky not deterring the tourists in the least.
Natasha wasted no time in smacking him on the back of the head, muttering about manners as Tony sniggered into his own fried shrimp beside Steve.
“Handling the press.”
“Pleasure to meet you, Jane,” Steve said.
Tony was momentarily disorientated when his vision suddenly went dark; his body tensed to lash out, only to recognize the now familiar warmth at his back and the rich smell of Steve’s cologne. It took him a further second to realise Steve had covered his eyes with one large hand, and Tony tried hard not to think about that hand touching other areas of his body.
He was pulled from his thoughts by the sound of heels on metal, and smiled up at the beautiful woman as she descended the catwalk stairs into the cargo hold. Natasha was wearing a cream coloured sarong dress, delicate stitching covered her bodice and a finely spun scarf was draped around her shoulders.
The last thing he wanted to be thinking about tonight was Tony in danger and getting hurt.
Looking over the catwalk down into the cargo hold, he didn’t see the familiar mop of dark hair. Steve moved on to the engine room, the closer he got causing the worry in his gut to grow. Tony seemed to always be talking, never shutting up even when everyone was telling him to. As a result, it was common to hear him well before he was seen by the rest of the crew.
“Okay then; I’m hungry.” Clint said, evidently moving on from the weird and focusing on the more important, namely his stomach.
Allowing himself to relax slightly with no chance of his crew poking their heads into the space, Steve sat down heavily on his bed and ran a hand over his face. Leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, he gave himself a moment to let his mind drift. It was only a small respite from his growing headache, but it was enough.
It didn’t take much for Tony to end up on his back, wrists pinned to the ground by Obie’s hands as the larger man effectively sat on him to keep him still.
“This is definitely one a the more interestin’ planets I’ve found myself on,” he offered, distracted.
“Come on, sweetheart, let’s get to bed.” Steve said quietly, reaching down and scooping up the other man, enjoying how sleepily affectionate in the afterglow Tony was, wrapping one arm up and around Steve’s neck while the other slipped around his back. Holding the love of his life in his arms like a new bride, Steve couldn’t help placing a gentle kiss on messy black hair.
Steve felt sick.
“No, your sister wasn’t in the car. She’s still at school and has yet to be informed.”
Steve shifted where he stood on the rocky ground, his practiced eyes trained on the shadowed surroundings as his crew slowly lugged the cargo they had been entrusted with closer to their ship.
Steve was no saint, he’d killed people before in the line of duty. But, those people had been armed with weapons like his own, they’d been set on creating bombs to hurt innocent people in cities that weren’t even directly involved with the conflict. They were generally bad people who would see innocents hurt to achieve their goals… weren’t they?
Tony let out another soft
It was the sight of Tony Stark, genius, billionaire, standing at the kitchen sink muttering away to himself, a pile of waiting dishes keeping him company, that stunned everyone.
“Hey, Coulson,” Darcy offered the agent a small wave before taking another sip of her own flute.
“Jane’s a scientist by trade,” Darcy continued.
It also didn’t help that Tony had tuned out partway through, mind wandering to what kind of dog Steve would be if he was hit with some super villain ray-gun that turned people into their most alike canine breed. The drifting hadn’t been so much a problem, as Steve realising he wasn’t paying him any attention.
Tony blinked at her for a moment in surprise at her observation before pulling a face.
Tony tensed, ready for whatever kind of attack the man was going to throw his way, but nothing seemed to be happening. He was just about to open his mouth and taunt the man for his lack of ability, when a funny, coldly familiar sensation suddenly started at his feet. Looking down instinctively, he could see nothing wrong with his feet encased in armour, but the feeling was rising, moving up his shin and to his knee. Frantically scanning the armour, he felt terror grip him as the screen before him showed his armour was quickly filling up with water.
“Good.”
Steve had made a point to have Clint land the ship a distance from their meeting location, just in case it went bad – a more common occurrence than he would like to admit.
He led the trio through the crowds towards an unmarked sushi place that had been selected as the meeting spot via the wave.
“M’ tired,” Tony muttered.
Fuelled with a burst of angry adrenaline, Tony pushed off form the chaise lounge and lunged for Obie, hoping to gain the upper hand with nothing more than the element of surprise. All that he succeeded in doing was knocking them both to the ground, the whiskey went flying and further stained Tony’s shirt, while Obie’s hands clawed at him as they bumped into the now fallen over chair.
“Not exactly the word I was thinking of,” Tony mumbled before taking a sip of his coffee.
When they’d gotten back to the ship Clint hadn’t even needed to be told that they needed to get off planet as fast as possible without arousing suspicion. The pilot soon had them away from Planeta Stark and Steve had remained with Tony in the Infirmary as much as possible.
“Ready, Captain?” Natasha’s voice was soothing, similar to that of a person trying to calm a child, as she appeared beside him, Clint slipping past and heading immediately down the stairs.
Steve slapped his hand onto the PA system button above his head.
“Oh, some backlash from shareholders, uncertainty from the board, you to pull some brilliant idea out of that head of yours,” she shrugged, a small, self-deprecating smile on her face. “Seems I overestimated you.”
Fourthly, Darcy was undoubtedly going to be sending him ginger-based cakes and cookies for the foreseeable future as some type of punishment for him not saying anything to her.
“It’s not real,” he muttered to himself, voice pitched a few octaves higher than usual, the water beginning to drip down his arms.
Steve had just enough time to grab hold of the control panel as Clint shoved the lever forwards and the whole ship jerked before they were flying through the darkness.
“Hey, thanks for the help,” he grinned at them, teeth white.
“Sir,” Jarvis trailed off, and Tony just knew from his tone that he was frowning at him, but he refused to be swayed.
The man’s already dangerously red face turned an almost puce colour and Steve resolved himself to loosing Tony. This idiot was going to hold him up for a while, and a quick glance at the door to the tavern showed that Tony had already slipped through and disappeared.
“Enjoy yourselves, then,” he said, gesturing to the airlock as he disabled it, and the ramp lowered to the ground.
Tony blinked in surprise. Their father’s favourite topic of conversation was always the World War II hero, Tony didn’t know how Darcy had never heard of him.
“Captain?” Natasha asked quietly.
“Come on, Tony,” Obie leaned closer to him, voice lowered. “Our contracts with the military are insisting on us aiding them with finding this monster. It’s an issue of national security. Now… imagine what it would happen if the monster turned up at your sisters’ school. There would be no way of knowing beforehand and it would be very likely that she’d be hurt, killed even.”
Thinking he’d lost him, Steve had to pull up short when he rushed down an empty side street and stepped out into a quiet courtyard between buildings. Quickly moving back into the shadows of the alleyway, he peered around the corner once more and listened carefully, noting with annoyance how often he found himself in this kind of situation with Tony.
with them.”
“Thought I’d come see you before I cleaned up the room,” the moan wasn’t entirely hidden in Tony’s voice as he dropped his head to the side to offer up more skin for Steve to bite and suck at, a possessive pleasure spiking down his spine at the thought of everyone seeing the marks on Tony’s throat.
Steve blinked in surprise as the man rolled over twice before he came to a stop on his back, a small cloud of dirt stirred up around him. The stranger groaned loudly as he raised a hand encased in leather fingerless gloves to his face and pushed back his dark hair.
“That’s not very nice of you, Stark. All I want is to understand,” Traveller frowned at him for a moment before a small smile lifted the corner of his mouth. “Perhaps you just need a stronger incentive?” he offered, like he was suggesting Tony have an extra piece of candy in the hopes it would make him a better-behaved child.
Tony could still remember that. He’d never seen the Englishman’s face go quite so red. Jarvis had taken away all of Tony’s tools and ordered him to spend the whole day cleaning the mansion, going from room to room with inspections after each one. It hadn’t helped that Darcy had followed after him, her forgotten toys an indicator of which rooms they’d been in.
“Might as well,” Tony would’ve shrugged if he could, voice strained as he pushed the suit for all it was worth, the nuke heavy on his back.
“Tony!” Darcy’s frantic voice suddenly filled his ears.
Steve blinked before he began to chuckle, the nervousness fading from his face.
Tucking away what he had heard for later, Tony stared at the screens before him, his attention immediately being captured by a glowing cube. Reaching for it, he twisted it one-way and then another, curiosity quipped.
Steve laughed.
Steve was seated in Thor’s chair on the ramp when his crew began to trickle back. By the time he’d made it back, the ships front glass had already been replace, the speed and efficiency being one of the major reasons he’d been grateful to be so close to the planet known for such things. He’d relieved Bruce of watching after the ship, receiving an odd look from the good doctor before he’d departed, Steve knew that the man would be asking questions later.
Steve felt nausea sweep through him as he quickly shut the book, staring at the dead person’s property and wondering why on Earth-that-was Tony had felt the need to take it and bury it on such an out of the way planet like Timbetpal?
“What’s the last thing you remember?” Steve moved closer to him, coming to stand beside his bed and resting a hand on the cushioned surface beside Tony’s shoulder.
He took a sip, and Steve grinned when he immediately winced.
“Go find some poor soul who’ll take you on for those credits I know you’re still missing!” he called at her retreating back with a real smile on his face.
“We’ll figure out what we have here for now, then box them back up and deal with them later,” he said, eyes once more dragging back to Tony who was still going through the first box.
“I suppose, given your circle of
Clint nodded, slowly pressing a lever upwards as The Avenger approached the ship.
But sitting here on a comfy couch, warm thanks to the live furnace beside him, and senses dulled by the drone of the television and the occasional murmur or ripple of laughter. Tony felt… safe.
If Clint had of been there he would have been threatening Tony to try and get him to shut up, while Thor would probably be laughing by this stage. The rest of the crew, however, weren’t there, it was just the two of them as they walked along, the others having found other things to amuse themselves with while they stopped off just before they went into the Rim for a while.
“My sister,” Tony glanced back at the doctor. “Darcy. She’s a huge fan of yours. She even decided to go to Culver because you were a professor there before, well, everything. She was pretty disappointed when she missed out on your return,” he snorted with laughter. “But, I suppose, she got to meet Thor instead, so she couldn’t complain too much,” he once again glanced over to Bruce, slightly amused by the odd look on Bruce’s face, before offering him a reassuring smile.
Her eyes suddenly narrowed at him.
“So, you got a name?” Steve finally asked, when it became clear the man was content to walk in silence.
“He’s perfect,” she whispered.
“How dare you come into me bar and say such filth!” The drunkards’ piggy little eyes were wide with rage, the whites completely visible around brown pupils.
“Good morning.” Pepper greeted them, glancing up with a small smile before her attention went back to the tablet.
“You’re okay, everyone is. You have a concussion and some cracked ribs, but otherwise you’re mostly fine.” Steve reported, his hands coming up to rest on the chair beside the mechanic.
Tony nodded, reluctant, but he did love Jarvis’ Super Secret Ingredient Chocolate Cake. Besides, as the butler had said, Darcy would still be there when he was finished.
Tony raised an eyebrow.
“I always do.”
“Work? Or sightseein'?” Tony crinkled his nose. “Actually, it was work, wasn’t it? I can’t really see you as a tourist type of guy.”
Having someone his own age, or close enough to it, would be… amazing.
Clearly known when she was beaten, Pepper stepped forward and up the ramp, her head held high as she ignored Steve when the two women passed him.
Tony counted his breath, tense, waiting to see how much more of their family’s past his sister was going to talk about. He would never try to restrict what Darcy was comfortable telling people about their childhood, but he knew that any mention of their parents had to be handled delicately. Darcy wasn’t, after all, always known for her tact.
“So, you’ve decided?” Steve asked, fairly confident he knew what Tony was going to say.
“Of course, Sir.”
“Drifting?” Bruce asked.
– Right now
Tony almost skipped breakfast.
Swinging his legs back to the floor, the sound of his boots thwacking on the metal caught Tony’s attention, and he turned his head to face him, eyes slow to focus.
Once Pepper had realised that Tony must have been captured, things had progressed quickly with no time for explanations. Steve was proud of his crew for jumping into action, especially when they’d had to rely on Pepper’s information and guesses as to what had happened.
“Coffee is sacred,” Tony tried for joking, but he was pretty sure it came off as a question rather than a statement of fact.
,” Nick snapped, clearly done with his dose of outlaw justice for now. “You should think of getting out of Aquamarine before Stone realises something is wrong and has his men searching for you.”
“Brace for impact!”
Steve couldn’t help but agree, Tony clearly knew a great deal about the organisation. At least, he spoke of it as fact rather than the usual speculative rumour.
Obie didn’t move.
Tony frowned, unhappy with the way in which Obie was so neatly playing him.
Tony fast-talked around Pepper, quietly pleased that she hadn’t lost her touch in the months he’d been… gone.
“See,” she looked ridiculously smug in the flickering light of the TV. “You should watch movies with me more often.”
Heir Apparent Anthony Edward Stark Takes Up Billion Platinum Mantel
“Apparently, I’m volatile, narrowly focused and don’t play well with others.”
Slowly opening his eyes and turning around awkwardly as his body refused to stop leaning against the counter - so really, it was more of a roll, then a turn - Tony belatedly realised he wasn’t quite as alone as he’d thought.
No one answered, but Tony finally came to a stop.
While Tony could almost count the number of hours he had spent with his parents collectively, it had been Jarvis who had raised him. Jarvis was the one to tend to skinned knees and broken hearts. It was the family butler Tony ran to when he aced his tests and won award after award. Even when Tony was sent away to boarding school, it was Jarvis who he rang to vent to about how the older kids didn’t like him because he was too smart, too young, too strange.
He didn’t want to believe it, but the way Obie had been acting, how he’d gotten him all but kicked out by the board of directors. The subtle differences between how the man acted now as opposed to how he’d been prior to Tony’s kidnapping. There was something definitely fishy going on with Obie, and Tony was sure whatever it was would be on that computer.
Tony had managed to spend the majority of the night dancing with his sister at the charity ball in their mother’s name, only to be pulled away from her when she was struggling to keep her eyes open and he left her to put a few chairs together at their table and stretch out atop them for a nap before they would leave. Obie had then totted him from person to person, shaking hands over proposed deals about weapons contracts and meaningless words over potentially revisiting the benched Super Soldier Program.
It was better than anything he could have guessed.
It might be true that Tony had maybe confessed some things to the slightly older man when he was particularly drunk and missing Darcy and Jarvis and the home that those two people inspired in him. He may have confessed to the loneliness he still acutely recalled from his younger days, before he had a little ball of energy and green eyes looking up at him with love and adoration. How he still felt completely alone when he was at the parties his father insisted upon him attending, despite the fact he wasn’t even old enough to get into many of the places they were held at.
“Attention USC cruiser, this is Steve Rogers, Captain of The Avenger,” Steve spoke clearly, mouth hard as he stared through the glass at the government ship.
“That doesn’t explain his sudden domesticity?” Natasha said blandly.
“Clint Barton was released from SHIELD duties into the Avengers Initiative. As the leader of the Initiative, I would like to be informed if you’re taking someone from my team for a mission.”
“I’m a genius, nothing I say is stupid,” he reiterated the old argument.
“Personal reasons,” was the lacklustre reply.
A large, fat man suddenly sat down in the seat before Steve, momentarily blocking his view of Tony and causing him to curse quietly. The man gave him an unimpressed look and grunted as though asking if Steve wanted to make something of it, but the Captain moved himself before he drew any more attention. Instead, he leaned against one of the screens placed around the room, creating a sense of privacy for those who wanted to conduct a bit of business with their drink.
“Isn’t that what
“This is amazing, Darcy. Did you do it all by yourself?” he asked, her face breaking out into an even larger grin, something he hadn’t thought possible.
“Enjoy your surprise, Tony,” Steve said with a small, shy smile as the doors once again closed, leaving the Stark siblings alone.
For the briefest moment, he was sure he was staring at USC soldiers, holding the fucking murder weapon up for everyone to see.
“That’s You and Butterfingers, they’re a bit shyer than Dummy,” Tony supplied, content for the moment to watch his bots interact with the new human in their domain.
“Okay, great. So, you just do your thing and I’ll keep working on the new model for the StarkPhone. Pepper will kill me if I don’t get it finished this week,” he muttered the last bit to himself, mind already returning to the safety of the circuitry before him as he reached up and pulled his magnified glasses back down over his eyes.
For a moment, the two just stood staring at each other, before Jane pulled back a hand and slapped Thor across the face.
However, Steve was surprised to see that she wasn’t alone.
“So, you do actually take on passengers?” Tony asked as they followed her, arm linking with Steve’s so that it brushed against Steve’s side with every step they took.
“I hate cleaning up other people’s messes,” Tony sighed from where he was sitting in one of the seats in his armour, helmet resting on his lap. Usually he would have flown ahead to take stock of the situation, but Steve had argued that they’d present a stronger force by arriving together. Tony had argued back, but then Steve had given him one of those sad-eyed looks and said that he’d just wanted Tony to be safe and, well, Tony really needed to sit down and have a strongly worded talk with Steve about emotional manipulation of one’s boyfriend and how bad it was that he was doing it… Eventually.
Rhodey stared at him silently for a moment, appearing to be trying to verify if he was telling the truth or just bullshitting him.
Tony nodded, mind looking for a distraction when his eyes landed once more on Darcy's paper.
– Idiots. All of you.
” Tony murmured suddenly after a few minutes of silence, his hand casually reaching behind him to brush against the small of his back where he’d concealed his gun before they’d left the ship. Given they’d been travelling together for a while now, Steve had relinquished the laser gun back to Tony, figuring that it was unlikely that the man would turn it on the rest of the crew at this stage.
“We have arrived, Sir,” the driver looked back at him in the review mirror as the car rolled to a stop before the large manor.
“Not from around here, are you?” She raised an eyebrow at them. “Come on, I can show you to the med tent and they can put somethin' on it,” she offered, head tilting away from the bonfire.
However, when it really came down to it, he’d known what his answer was going to be from the moment Tony had asked.
Tony, for his part, remained where he was standing in his lounge for a moment, eyes unfocussed and a small frown upon his face. He wasn’t sure he liked the look that had been in Pepper’s eyes. Shaking it off, he clapped his hands together and roused himself towards the elevator to await its return.
As soon as they’d landed and he was able, Tony had been down the ramp and disappearing into the small town. Steve, in an effort to keep his crew safe, and suffering from a burning sense of curiosity, had quickly followed at a discrete distance. Natasha and Clint had followed him, mostly out of nosiness, while Bruce had shaken his head and said something about privacy. Thor, frankly, was no use at covert operations as he didn’t believe in hiding when he could just charge in full force.
“Shut up. Don’t jinx me,” he sighed loudly, shoulders slumping.
Steve sincerely doubted that, but didn’t bother to argue with the injured man.
everything is now. How I should embrace all the consumerist crap that you all submerge yourselves in - constantly! I hate having blinking lights everywhere I look, and the constant need for stimulation is oppressive and exhausting. I don’t understand why you need so many machines in every room of the house. I don’t care if you say they make your life easier, it just makes you lazier! You don’t need a toothbrush that does the job for you, you don’t need music shoved in your ears every second of every day, and I don’t know who in God’s name thought it was a good idea to put a machine in a toilet - but it’s ridiculous!” His face was screwed up into a mix of horrified and disgusted, an angry flush staining his cheeks.
“They get away okay?” he asked, falling into step with the agent as they headed for the bridge.
“Hmm,” was all Steve offered, eyes still unwaveringly focused. Tony had to dig his nails into the palm of the hand that was mostly hidden from everyone’s view in order to stop himself from reaching up to tap against the arc. He
“No, no that never happened,” Tony shook his head. What the hell was Steve talking about? He’d never been in a car accident, unless you counted that time the hum-vees were attacked in Afghanistan.
“Hi, Tony,” she said, a small, amused smile pulling up her lips.
“I’ll be in a tiny town no one’s ever heard of, spending my nights staring up at the stars,” she couldn’t hold in the smile.
“Well go and find her,” he snapped dismissively, before he turned back to brooding before the flames.
Tony spent the rest of the elevator ride spluttering and trying to get his tongue to work properly in order to tell his delusional sister that she didn’t know shit, and that if she ever told anyone he’d had a Captain America poster on the wall of his room until he was nineteen, he’d hack her Facebook account and post all the embarrassing pictures of her he could find - and with Jarvis as his accomplice, that would be a
“Captain, shall I take the far side?” he gestured to where a few lone stairs were will attached to what had been the floor.
“He’s a potential liability,” Natasha countered from her usual devil’s advocate position.
“Rhodey, I’m touched, really, I am. I think I’m tearing up even, completely chocked up,” Tony dramatically clutched at his chest with his free hand, because if he didn’t joke about this, if he admitted that in the three weeks since his father and Jarvis had passed that he hadn’t been coping well, that he didn’t know what he was doing, that the funeral had been nothing more than a circus act gone
“This here is Captain Steve Rogers, and his mechanic, Tony. Jane, Captain Rogers said he’s got room in his ships passenger cabins for us. We’re finally goin’ to be gettin’ off this rock,” Darcy said cheerfully.
“I’m well. Uni is… different. I like that it’s a lot more focused on what I’m actually interested in rather them dumbing down the whole spectrum of basic education to try and teach me,” he twirled the wrench in his free hand, lazily swinging the chair from left to right with a single foot on the floor.
“Things are going to change, Darc,” he began slowing, choosing his words. “There will be a hell of a lot of people unhappy and looking for me to fail. Maybe, if you want, maybe you should stay in Virginia for a while?”
"Is everything ready?" Steve asked, glancing up the ramp at where he could make out a few new supply crates sitting in the cargo bay.
“Fury may be a
“Fifteen credit, hurry, hurry,” he held out his ring heavy hand, fingers curling and uncurling impatiently.
“Tony, I’ll take the left half. Think you can handle the ones to the right?” Steve interrupted.
“I’m sorry, but I won’t stop,” Tony’s voice was equally as soft, staring at his semi-destroyed workshop rather than his sister.
“The investigative detective had been silenced, and my safe looted and the house burned to the ground. Tony disappeared from my life and I was left with whatever I could scrounge up as compensation,” Rumiko stood and brushed down the front of her skirt.
“I am sick and tired of all of you going on and on about how
“I got turned around on one of my runs, went down a street too early, and found this place. I’ve been here a couple of times, but apart from some shock the first time, they basically leave me to my own devices,” Steve said with a small smile. Tony nodded, understanding that being as famous as they were, sometimes just having a place they could go, where no one asked you for an autograph, or a picture, or to regale them with stories of what you’d done in recent battles, it was a life line. It was the only way they could pretend that they were just ordinary people, doing something extraordinary. Something that Tony knew Steve valued greatly.
“Pepper’s invited us out for dinner tonight,” Natasha said, switching tracks when it was clear she wasn’t going to get more of an answer out of her friend.
“Good, good,” he nodded, eyes trailing across the rest of his crew, taking note of the amused looks on their faces, now all assembled and accounted for.
Steve’s cheeks flushed both with self-conscious embarrassment at his childish behaviour, and pleasure at Tony’s obvious amusement.
Natalie Rushman was secret agent spy Natasha Romanov. Of-
“You’re supposed to be the adult here,” she snorted.
, Tony,” Steve glared at him, daring him to say anything more.
Giving his sister a one-armed hug, he sighed.
“Ow,” Tony let out a pitiful noise as he pushed himself up, Clint snorted loudly in amusement. Steve turned back to Natasha, the man clearly hadn’t really hurt himself and Steve was intent on getting them all off this cursed ship as fast as possible.
“I told her to delete those!”
“Captain, I believe I have found something,” Thor said.
That, and perhaps a nice night out with just the two of them, no crew or near death emergencies to get in the way of their conversation.
The man barely looked any older than the last time Tony had seen him, smiling and suggesting Tony head to the party before him, to escort their
“What do you think he wants, a picnic?” Clint snorted, but Steve ignored him.
“Tony, Tony, Tony. This really isn’t something that you should be too worried about. We’ll find out who has her, see what they want, then get the police on the trail to get her back. This will be all over before you know it,” Obie said, voice completely confident in a positive outcome.
Slipping out of the vehicle, Tony made sure that his present was securely concealed, before moving quickly to the front door, unable to hide his grin as it was promptly opened by Jarvis, a small smile of welcome on the butlers' face.
Tony happily didn’t pay him any mind, far more interested in bending and twisting Clint’s wrist to see how he needed to lengthen a small strap here and make the clasp smaller so it wouldn’t ding into the archers’ palm when he bent his wrist at an 81’ angle. He was idly contemplating the idea of doing a series of braces in increasingly ridiculous colours for a laugh, when a voice that wasn’t one of the Avengers broke through his thoughts.
“Eww,” she stuck her tongue out and pulled a face, nose scrunched up.
“Tell Doctor Traveller how you feel,” the man urged, voice gentle in a way Tony had secretly longed to have directed at him.
It seemed that Tony’s apparent willingness to tease back with Clint had opened the floodgates of the archers’ innuendoes. The man even went out of his way to stick around until Tony had finished his cleaning just to hear what rebuff the genius came up with. What Clint didn’t know, was that it was only Tony’s continual rebuffs that were standing in the way of Steve punching him.
Tony let out a small, bitter laugh.
Tony made his way out of his room and towards the elevator, mind already turning around the various prototypes he had left open in his workshop. He attempted to ignore Pepper’s curious questions about what he’d been up to recently as she dogged his steps.
The familiar, exasperated sigh that Rhodey seemed to have developed just for Tony when he was being ridiculous, made the grin on Tony’s face gain some realism.
Tony hadn’t had people in the rooms near his own before. Any time his parents had guests staying with them, Tony was only to see them in the main rooms before Howard sent him off to the West wing of the manor to keep him out of the way. Howard had told Tony that people only came over for important business reasons, and he didn’t need Tony acting as a distraction to them. Jarvis’s rooms were closest to him in the middle of the house for optimal efficiency, so having someone now staying right next to him would be a completely new experience for Tony.
“No, I mean,” Steve looked at the workshop as a whole once more. “This whole place is… really something, Tony,” he finally turned to look at the genius and Tony felt the pride in his chest grow.
“What’s my father doing to get Darcy back?” he demanded, steady heart or not, this was still his little sister that was missing.
Unable to resist, Steve reached out with the same finger as before and traced the edge where the skin was stretched around Tony’s finger. Pushing slowly, the tight, warm skin slowly stretched to encompass the tip of Steve’s now dry finger, Tony making a loud moaning sound the whole while. Glancing up, Steve smirked at the sight of Tony’s head once more thrown back, neck now stained red with bite marks and slightly shiny with a combination of sweat and spit.
bot. I can say what I like to him.”
Also, are they singing "Hero of Canton" at the bar? Yes, yes they are. (Lyrics are not mine)
“I know.”
The snort that escaped Clint was more pointed than Steve was comfortable with.
“Come on, we’d better get back home, before anything else decided to attack us tonight.” Steve said, hand moving to rest on the hilt of his own iron sword that hung around his waist.
As Steve began to talk about what the Avengers where, their purpose, how upstanding they were, blah, blah, blah; Tony kept his eyes on the reporters, taking note of who appeared to be liking what they were hearing, and who would probably become a problem for them in the near future.
“Here I was, thinking you’d appreciate a call from your loving brother, and all I get is complaints,” he sat himself down in one of the humvee’s, amused at his sisters’ drama as she hung her head, a personality trait that Pepper claimed she had mimicked from Tony himself. Tony was adamant that she’s adopted it from Rhodey.
“I distinctly remember one morning we discovered that you’d cannibalized the toaster for parts during the night. I’d never heard Jarvis yell so loudly when he found out you’d taken his precious tea kettle too,” laughter filled the room and even Tony felt nostalgic amusement flicker beneath the anxiety.
“Do you like it?” Darcy asked, dragging his attention away from where he had been happily running a hand over You’s camera box, as Dummy contentedly held onto the hem of his tank top. Looking over, he saw Darcy had gained her own affectionate bot; Butterfinger’s was nudging into her hand like a particularly insisted cat demanding pets.
“I can’t be bothered to deal with this right now,” Rhodey turned and moved off into the heat of the Afghani desert.
thing. But I’m okay – we’re all okay. So, don’t panic!” Darcy blurted out as soon as the call was answered.
“Don’t think I haven’t noticed you’ve given me the side with less monsters to kill.” Normally, Tony would put up a huge fuss about that, but the cracks in his sword worried him more than he was willing to admit.
God, Steve really must have done something good in another life to deserve this. Not wasting another moment, Steve climbed onto the couch between Tony’s legs, unscrewing the cap of the lube as he did so. Squeezing out a generous amount onto his fingers, he placed the tube on Tony’s sternum, amused despite himself at the action, before delivering another quick, hard kiss to Tony’s panting mouth.
It wasn’t exactly uncommon for them for see Pepper Potts in the tower, she was Stark Industries CEO after all and was often after Tony about one project or another, or a meeting, or a gala, or whatever it was this week. But she was quietly sitting at the breakfast table with a cup of coffee and a tablet, seemingly content for the moment as her fingers flew across the screen, micromanaging one of the largest companies in the world like a pro.
“Oh, Tony,” she sighed, fond exasperation in her tone. “You’re the biggest idiot I know.”
“Not at all,” Darcy’s voice was chocked as she moved towards him, carefully taking his free hand in a tight squeeze, willing to wait until they were somewhere more private where she could hug him and not have to let go of him for a long time.
Turning quickly, he rushed after the surprisingly light-footed mechanic and managed to catch up to him on the catwalk in the cargo hold.
They’d managed to get Tony out of that place and back to the ship, Pepper providing a descent distraction by pretending to have stumbled upon Stane when delivering some paperwork after hours – a common occurrence in a multi-galactic business.
Tony was still laying where Steve had left him, left leg bent and leaning against the back of the couch, right pulled up to his chest and held with a slightly trembling hand. His left hand was between his legs, wrist pressed alongside his cock and precome smeared across his forearm and stomach. He had one finger shoved up inside himself, as still as it could be with his breathing forcing his arm to shift and his finger to ever so slightly thrust in and out of his hole with each breath. From the way Steve had positioned him, Tony was on display to any who walked past, from his flushed and leaking cock, to his greedy little hole that begged for something to fuck up into it – hard.
“Knock yourself out,” Darcy nodded, Clint snagging one before she could change her mind.
“Steve?” the word slipped from his mouth without conscious thought, eyes trained on the man as his sense of confusion grew. He felt a wave of dizziness wash over him.
“I’ll try.”
Tony hated those things. He had seen one up close when wandering around the Helicarrier once, apparently, it had been appropriated after a battle with the Fantastic Four at some point. It was poorly made and clearly worked off of a hive mind. Seriously, Tony could have made something better than that in his sleep.
“Tony?” Darcy asked quietly, pulling Tony’s attention back to her now lowered eyes.
It took Tony a couple of long, slow blinks at the empty coffee machine before this news finally managed to seep into his brain. Looking around the Tower workshop, with its new glossy table tops and smudge free glass, he felt a little out of place. The Tower workshop was still very new, only completed three weeks ago, and it had only been ‘in use’ for the last two weeks. The repair work to the Tower was finally finished; it had been ridiculous that the damage of one short battle that lasted just under two hours, had taken almost two months to repair. Well, the Tower was repaired, some parts of New York were still boarded up, waiting for people to come and fix them thanks to the very generous donations by the Maria Stark Foundation. Why else was Tony the founding member of a charity if not to spend money cleaning up after an attempted extra-terrestrial invasion?
It was certainly more than they did for Howard’s birthday, a day usually devoted to very carefully avoiding any mention or reminder of the man.
When we was sure it was nice and wet, he pulled it from his mouth and guided Tony’s hand down and between his legs where Steve pushed the wet finger into the slightly loosened hole.
“She didn’t even scream when I suddenly appeared through the vegetation, just lowered her sunglasses and asked me if I wanted to join her. It wasn’t long before I began travellin' with her, she was doin' mostly promotional work for the Fujikawa expansion, and I was already planet hoppin', so we traveled together. We were together like that for about six months before we parted ways,” he finished.
” An official voice sounded out through the bridge, repeating itself in Chinese.
Yet, there was almost something artistic about the way in which they’d been displayed, that the killers had been careful to put the most mutilated of the bodies on the outside for show.
“What?” she asked, looking a little swept away. Tony could forgive her for that, he was impressed she’d been able to keep up for as long as she had.
What exactly is going on?
“What’re we going to do with all of this?” Natasha asked.
“Hey, any chance I can get my StarkPlayer back?” Darcy questioned.
“Well, if they’re so bad, let’s just go in, wipe them out quickly, and then we can be back home in time for dinner,” Steve said, pulling on his cowl and adjusting his grip on the shield. Tony sent him a grin.
Steve bemusedly took the husk of corn when Tony passed it to him.
“It’s been different,” she said, shrugging her shoulders.
“Yes, so be on standby for any survivors we find. The scan didn’t show us anythin’ much, but it can be wrong if the signs are little or few in number,” Steve said, adjusting the suit as a muffled thud came from the airlock, signally that Clint had established a connection with the other ship.
Something about phones seemed to make Darcy ridiculously excited.
“Jarvis, save all that, would you?” he asked, moving away towards the elevator with his blond shadow.
“What?”
– thank you very much
Steve couldn’t help but let out a small chuckle himself, relief mixing with disbelief that they’d managed to get away.
When the doctor was putting the last of the sticky gauze over the tenderly reattached edges of the wound, he paused, a hand lightly resting atop it.
“You have a flat ass, accept your limitations,” Tony couldn’t keep the smirk off his face.
“Well, yes. But,” he hurried to add. “You lot are too, if everythin’ I’ve seen is anythin’ to go by.”
“I’ll be back soon,” Steve said, clearing his throat and feeling slightly awkward.
Steve had sworn in that moment, breathless and squinting in the fading light at the shape of his unmoving brother on the cold, hard ground; he’d never forgive the USC for what they’d done. Steve would spend the rest of his life as far away from them as possible, making his own way with his small ship, living the free life he and Bucky had dreamed of as children.
“Is there anything in the paper other than talk about the clean up?” Bruce asked, glancing over from the stovetop and frowning when he eyed Clint’s bowl. “I’m making pancakes, you know.”
“If I’d wanted a cheap knock-off, I’d have bought one of them instead of making a state-of-the-art, highly advanced technological canine.”
“With flying colours,” Jarvis spoke up, not allowing Tony to try and deny it.
“Lies. What’d you want, anyway? Much as I enjoy talking to you, I have an assignment I was working on and you totally killed the roll I was on. I was in the zone and everything,” she brought the conversation back on track.
“Okay.”
Steve seemed to be over their disagreement, at least.
Recovering slightly, he steeled himself to look back.
Strong arms encircled him and a now familiar warmth surrounded him. Steve was still speaking, but his voice was muffled and Tony honestly didn’t have the energy to try and concentrate on the words coming out of the mans’ mouth. He had a brief moment where the world felt like it was tilting, as though up was down and sideways was up, before his brain finally decided it’d had enough and everything went dark.
“Natasha!”
“Such a tale of romantic woe,” Thor broke the tension with a loud sniff, and Steve wondered for a moment if the large man was going to gather Tony up into a manly hug to sob it out.
“It’s good to meet you, Doctor Banner. Your work on anti-electronic collisions is unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage-monster,” he turned slightly to where Phil was standing off to the side and grinned. “Darc is going to be so jealous,” he laughed as the doctor awkwardly thanked him.
Tony was so busy playfully pushing away the happily beeping bot, Darcy’s laughter back in full force as it filled the workshop, that he completely missed the entrance of his newest employee.
“No,” she shook her head. “This is you feeling guilty and jumping on the plan which results in the most immediate action. You just about gave Pepper a heart attack when she came in before, and now she’s upstairs ranting to Jarvis about the bullet holes,” her eyes narrowed on the pieces of armour she could see about the room. Tony winced, remembering Pepper’s look of shock when she’d seen them when he’d first arrived back from taking out that syndicate in Afghanistan.
“If you didn’t want him to lecture you, then you should have just gone to the debriefing,” Pepper said, eyes not leaving whatever she was reading on her screen.
get his arms to relax enough to let her go. And if Tony spent the rest of the night holding Darcy in his arms, back in her own bed at the mansion, phone pressed to his ear as he
Thankfully, as though reading his mind, she merely smirked at him, before turning to Clint and bluntly telling him not to try and cheat, to take his shot like a real pilot and be a baby about it.
“Dummy!” Darcy said loudly, all the seriousness a child could hold in her voice, one finger pointed at the bot sternly.
Steve didn’t bother to mention that they didn’t exactly have a destination in mind for where to head to next. They didn’t have any current jobs, and were off towards the Rim in the hopes that they’d pick up something to do along the way. It wasn’t exactly a time sensitive plan, but Natasha had never been one to wait around for anyone else when there was no immediate benefit for her.
“You know that’s never going to happen, don’t you?” he said softly, worried.
“Aye,” Thor agreed, a look of recognition on his face. “Or when I encountered the wet floor?”
The cargo hold was the largest room in the ship, two stories high and able to store everything they’d ever tried to smuggle or legally transport. Currently, it held a few of the standard issue plastic crates with nutritious protein packs and miscellaneous supplies. Steve led Tony up the stairs of the catwalk that overlooked the cargo hold, then through the dining room and back hall to the engine room.
“Don’t tell me you have an insect phobia,” Clint groaned loudly over the comm unit in Tony’s ear.
All four looked over and Steve was surprised to see the mystery bar fight man coming forward, an easy smile on his face and eyes focused on the compression core that they were currently haggling over. The bruise on his jaw was indeed beginning to darken, and he had a sack hanging from a rope slung over one shoulder.
The man behind him had a black turtle neck shirt done up so high that it obscured most of his face, only the bridge of his nose, eyes and bald head visible. On the left of his skull a metal plate protruded from the skin, shinning in the electric lights of the room. Small, green eyes stared at him emotionlessly, as if the man had absolutely no feelings about what was happening one way or another.
“A greatly appreciated thought, Young Miss,” Jarvis piped up, causing a tendril of suspicion to grow within Tony.
He wasn’t quite sure how, but Tony had managed to get a fair amount of dishwater over both the front and back of his black singlet, making the material cling to his back muscles in a way that was frankly delicious. His dark denim jeans were as tight as ever, streaked with black oil stains from when Tony had been down in the workshop before, half a handprint visible on his right ass cheek. That half a handprint was definitely a key factor in why Steve felt so warm all over, his own right hand twitching slightly with the desire to cover the half done stain with his own hand, feel the tight flesh underneath the material and squeeze it.
“Didn’t you ever want to see the recreated Statue of Liberty? Or the rebuilt Empire State Buildin'?” Toby looked thoughtful as he lent his head in the palm of his hand, elbow perched upon the table.
Glancing at Coulson and noting the unusual degree of tension that seemed to radiate from the man, Tony flicked his fingers outward, trusting Jarvis to bring the files various key points on the holoscreens before him. Originally, he’d designed this area so that he could get some sunlight while working, Pepper and Darcy had both been after him about being a nocturnal hermit for months now, and this was his way of appeasing them.
“Five days ago, my lead scientist, Doctor Helen Cho, disappeared from our laboratories in the middle of the night. She is extremely loyal to our company, and was working on some highly classified technological developments into biomechanics, at the time. Understandably, we are both worried for her health and the possibility of the information she has getting found out by the wrong people.
That was why Tony needed to do something about the car battery he had to carry around. Not to mention the
“Well, let’s keep going and try for that new record,” Tony snipped back, getting to his feet and heading for the elevator.
“Why Pepper, that’s a bit forward of you,” he couldn’t help quipping. She didn’t even bother to acknowledge the comment.
“You ever found yourself on this hunk of rock before?”
Darcy had sat next to him throughout, wearing a dark blue dress that was covered in sparkles. Her hair had begun the night up in some fancy formation neither Stark sibling had bothered to learn to pronounce, but by the time the dancing began, it was mostly hanging down around her shoulders in waves.
It was only Steve, standing by the elevator doors when they opened, that prevented such a thing from happening. Steve may or may not have been the only acceptable reason to be awake that early after only two hours of sleep.
“I’m afraid I don’t know to what you are referring, Sir,” the AI’s voice was unusually innocent sounding.
Yet, as Tony had spoken of Yinsen, had lost himself momentarily in memory, his words had sharpened and he wouldn’t have been out of place at a fancy party in the Core planets.
What wasn’t usual, was Jane sitting on Darcy’s other side, apparently having been dragged out from the lab space Tony had set up for her a few floors above Bruce’s own work area. They had only just gotten to the scene involving The Snuggly Duckling when Thor began edging into the area like the most unsubtle, mountainous claiming land mass. The god had quickly claimed a seat on the floor before Jane, her leg pressed up tight against his shoulder. Natasha had appeared soon afterwards, seemingly between one scene and the next, only to claim the solitary armchair to herself. Clint had appeared with Bruce, the duo coming into the room as Maximus appropriated a sword. The archer joined Thor on the floor, stealing a pillow from Natasha’s chair, while Bruce seated himself on the other couch. Steve was the last to appear, coming in and sitting down beside Bruce when Rupunzel and Flynn were setting out onto the river to see the lights.
It made Steve slightly nervous.
“I am not sulking!” Tony grouched, frown now firmly on his face.
“Ay, that he does,” Thor said, voice loud in the dining room.
Suddenly, Clint was pulled away and Tony blinked up to see that Steve was holding the archer with one hand, an eyebrow raised.
“Stop stirrin’ her up, you know she won’t be half easy to be around if you put her in a bad mood,” Steve sighed at his pilot.
It wasn’t too often that the entire crew was able to leave the ship at one time. Usually, someone needed to stay behind just in case some no good scoundrel decided they fancied themselves a ship Captain and tried to commandeer the vessel. But, Core planets were – for the most part – fairly scrupulous about their dock security. It made it difficult to get out any smuggled or stolen goods, but it provided the crew with a much-needed land break.
“I just said you were a fan,” Tony shrugged.
Steve elected to ignore such ridiculous comments and kept his eyes on his plate while his thoughts drifted.
“Credits ain’t really an issue for us. We are, however, lookin’ to leave soon,” she said.
“You could have been seriously hurt, Tony.”
“Ay! The Gods statue! Such a place is perfect for such noble comrades as you both.”
God, what Steve wouldn’t do to be able to bite and lick that strip of skin.
If he ever got the chance to stick it to the USC… well, Steve was only human.
There was no way that betraying bastard could still be alive. Tony had essentially killed the man himself.
“I haven’t been up for that long.”
“Sure do, I checked it out and the Political Sciences program there is pretty sweet looking,” she grinned, victorious.
“He won’t be pleased when he sees how you’ve treated me, Captain,” Pepper snapped.
– oh, my god
It had been a busy few days once Tony had recovered enough to stay awake and aware for more than short periods of time and Bruce had allowed him to return to his room rather than stay in the Infirmary for monitoring (or, at least, Tony had needled the doctor until he'd given in). Steve had filled the mechanic in on more details of the rescue mission the crew had launched with Pepper's help. How they'd smuggled him back out of the mansion and Pepper had stayed behind to cover their tracks.
Pepper and Rhodey, well, they didn’t really mind Tony’s quirk. There were a hell of a lot of other things, bad things, very bad things, that Tony could do to help him clear his mind and work out problems.
“That’s what you get when you overindulge with ale. If it wasn’t for our dear mechanic bringing you back to the ship in a timely manner, I’ve no doubt that you’d be trying to convince him to go sightseeing still.”
They stared at one another for a moment before Tony groaned and banged his head upon the table top in defeat, being sure to miss the plate, lest he get pancake all over his face.
“I’m Tony, the mechanic of his ship,” Tony said, nodding his head towards him as he did so.
Through the other people milling about their daily – or was it nightly? – lives, he could make out the Yurma police officers gesturing and pointing towards them.
it was sad that his mother had died. He knew he should have been crying, and possibly hiding away in his room. But, his mother had never been a particularly large presence in his life. It felt more like a family friend of his parents had passed away, someone who was occasionally over for dinners and would absentmindedly congratulate him on his latest accomplishments.
“Right, let’s go.” Steve said before the two took off towards the monsters at a dead run.
“Well,” Darcy broke off as Jane suddenly slapped Thor once more, looking a little surprised at her own action.
“What the hell?” he gasped, staring at the rising water level in disbelief, it was almost at his hips now.
While he had some bumps and bruises, being thrown through a wall would do that to someone, it was mostly an emotional exhaustion and complete humiliation that drained him. He knew his team had all heard him, in a moment of absolute weakness, admitting insecurities that he had never, ever, spoken aloud.
While Jane looked like she was struggling between being annoyed at his interruption, and embarrassed by the attention they’d gained, Thor just nodded.
“Your engine is a beautiful piece of work, absolutely wonderful. I kinda wanna marry it.”
Seeing this woman and Tony together, they looked… intimate.
Everything looked real, he could even smell the cleaning detergent and antiseptic scents that all hospital employees carried with them, coming off of Steve. Steve was definitely real and solid before him.
Steve was slightly relieved that she didn’t sound particularly put off by Tony’s blunt question.
“He’ll get over it,” Steve shrugged, taking his final bite of cake, studiously avoiding everyone’s eyes.
The seating arrangements for their movie nights was the same as last time, with Thor and Jane once again claiming the double couch, and Natasha contorting into what Tony was positive was a highly uncomfortable position on the single chair. Bruce calmly took the floor, while Clint bitched and moaned that it wasn’t fair that he never got a seat. The rest of the room ignored his complaints, and Darcy, Steve and Tony sat on the three-seater couch. Only this time, Darcy claimed Tony’s usual corner, leaving him with no choice but to sit in-between his sister and the man who seemed determined to invade his personal space.
Tony blinked again.
“Stay safe,” he called softly as he watched her feet disappear up the stairs, leaving him in his workshop.
Gripping his sword tight, Tony set off at a fast pace, eyes alert for any sign of movement and ears staining to pick up any of the familiar sounds of monsters. He managed to weave around trees and not trip over the uneven land for a few minutes; till he was halfway home and his good luck ran out.
“Okay, here goes. I need you to push this button on the keyboard for me,” Tony rolled the stool over slightly, so that she could reach out and with a single, small stab of a button, the machine before them initiated a series of beeps and an odd whirling noise. The duo sat in silence as slowly, of its own volition, the helper bot raised its claw-like head and they could hear the loud zoom feature from the camera. The machine turned its head until it was focused on them, the zoom feature seeming to go crazy as it assessed them.
Phil just offered him a bland smile before pointing off to the side where he was going while Tony continued straight onto the raised platform with a large circular table that the others had congregated around.
“Obie?” he called out, voice quiet but firm as the older man quickly wrapped up his phone call.
"Hey, I was thinkin'," Tony began, a slight pinking of his cheeks successfully capturing Steve's entire attention. "There's a dwarf planet called Eris not too far from here, and they've got a harvest festival approachin'. If you'd like, we could stop over for the celebrations?"
“Are you well, Sir?”
“Captain, we’re being waved down by a USC ship.”
“We need a plan of attack,” Steve’s ‘Captain’ voice put an end to any further conversation between the two, and Tony couldn’t stop the reflexive roll his eyes.
to governments and police enforcement agencies all over the ‘verse.”
Thinking back to the blue, glowing disc of light embedded into the very flesh of Tony’s chest, Steve had to wonder what else those monsters had done to him. There was no way Tony had acquired such a disfigurement anywhere reputable. But, what was the purpose of it? What could a light in one’s chest achieve? Bruce said it was possibly some kind of cardiac infuser, but Steve wasn’t so sure.
“You know of Tony Stark?” Thor asked, unsubtly gravitating back to Jane while he spoke to Darcy, stilling only when he was at her side once more.
Nodding, just grateful for someone to be telling him what to do when he didn’t have a clue how to handle this, Tony moved to the couch and sat. Darcy curled up in his lap until her knees were pressed against his left side and her arms tucked between them, hands gripping his shirt as she had always done when upset.
The man was blinking up at the ceiling of the room, a look of groggy confusion on his face.
This time, Bruce was the one who looked amused.
“Hey, Cupcake,” he warmly returned the hug with one arm, making sure to keep his present safe with his free hand.
There would be only one option.
It was something Tony was dreading having to talk to the man about, because Darcy would break one of those guys’ noses before she thought about dating them. Especially at the suggestion of her pseudo-godfather.
"He's always like that, you'll barely notice a difference."
“Like, coffee, coffee, or
“You promised, Tony,” she whispered.
But, Tony was already mostly dozing as they walked, and it was only their first date.
“It’s all down to Tony, now,” Steve muttered, hoping that his leap of faith was going to pay off.
“That’s what everyone says, Captain. Prepare for boarding in five minutes,” the voice said sarcastically, before the connection cut off.
Tony’s sudden movement caught his attention, and Steve stood to move beside him as he slowly opened his eyes.
“But, what if, I mean…” He took a deep breath before looking at her directly. “What if he doesn’t feel the same?” He asked quietly.
That… that had been
“Hush, Darcy. I want to hear about the cellist. Is that still a thing?” Pepper shushed her.
“I’ll make sure to remind her to do so,” Darcy grinned at him, relaxing minutely, her stirring slowing slightly.
They stood for a moment, seemingly just looking at one another, before the woman sighed and threw her arms around him, hugging him close.
“Well this was fun, let’s do it again sometime. I’ve got important things to do down in the workshop so I’ll see you all later,” he was backing away as he spoke, eager to escape.
“Attention USC Skiff ship, this is the Captain of The Avenger speakin'. We ain't done nothin' to warrant a boardin' of government sanctioned soldiers. We’ll just be on our way,” Steve said and released the button, ignoring the soft snort of laughter from Natasha.
“Maybe,” Tony allowed, fighting the small smile trying to break over his face as Steve gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze.
Steve knocked Tony out of his slightly homicidal thoughts with a tight hug, sword carefully pushed out of the way.
Numerous projects filled the screen, overcrowding it as Pepper looked at them all with wide eyes.
The sooner they got away from this vessel, the better.
“I’m Darcy,” the woman who had been standing quietly watching their exchange suddenly broke in, hand held out to a surprised looking Clint.
She took the robotic dog from him, holding it as gently and carefully to her chest as if it were a real puppy and not a puppy sized metal robot. The robotic dog reacted to her touch and its ears moved forward like a dog who perked its ears, tail starting to wag from side to side with the accompanied sound of the machine parts moving.
brave.
Tony had laughed and opened the tin, finding half a dozen cupcakes with bright, electric blue icing, tiny multi-coloured sprinkles decorating them inside. He may have eaten them all in one sitting, but there was no one who could verify that.
“Fantastic,” Pepper’s voice came as Tony turned back to the screens.
Steve moved quickly through the ship, glancing into every room as he passed, making sure there was nothing there and that it wasn’t what he was searching for.
She gave him an exasperated roll of her own.
“Concentrate, Tony. They’ll notice us soon and we’ll loose the element of surprise.”
“-And that’s it. God, I think I’ve finally done it. The first one I’ve managed to pull off. Now I just need to close this up and turn you on and - I can’t believe I’ve finally done it,” Tony muttered to himself, carefully putting the wired insides back into the metal framework before reaching for the cover plate to give what would hopefully be his new workshop helper a clean finish on its metal framework body.
“It’s a popular place to visit on Aquamarine, not just for tourists, but the locals hold all their celebrations around the base of it every year,” Steve rubbed the back of his neck nervously for a moment, before forcefully removing his hand and letting it hang casually at his side.
“Tony, how could you think that we would want you to leave the team? You’re the one who feeds us and makes sure we’re happy and healthy,” Bruce said softly.
“Focus, everyone. We have a job to do,” Steve said, voice not quite the tone of Captain America just yet, a little bit too much amusement filling it.
Listening to the pretentious dick talking about his upcoming news spread with a journalist who was clearly more interested in talking to new CEO Pepper Potts, was somewhat amusing, at least. But, Pepper leaving him alone allowed his mind to wander and, eyes catching sight of the television on which they could watch the car race, an idea occurred to him.
“Yes, and I will see them when I leave here,” Yinsen looked at him, voice calm as ever. “And you, Stark?”
“You’re going to a tiny town in New Mexico. It’s hardly the other side of the globe,” Tony teased her gently.
But, Steve and his crew had jumped in without a second thought.
Tony and plants were not a great combination. There was a reason all of Tony’s creations were self-sufficient and didn’t require actual feeding and looking after.
"Ay, everyone has returned and supplies have been acquired," Thor said, standing and beginning to pack up his chair.
“Steve. I promise, I rarely ask for favours, and it’s bad timin’ that I need to now as we’ve not known one another for long. But, I need to get to Timbetpal. I
Seriously, how did this man function in the twenty-first century sometimes?
Tony was surprised. He hadn’t thought that people would really want to spend time in his workshop. He knew Darcy was down there all the time, but he’d figured that was more because she’d grown up spending time with Tony in various workshops and she loved being with the bots. Pepper occasionally stopped by the workshop as well, but that was always due to necessity, she never stayed longer than she needed to, and she was always either telling him off for not sleeping or for not working on what he was meant to be working on. Rhodey, similarly, was hardly ever in the workshop, only coming down when it came to shoptalk or if he couldn’t find Tony anywhere else in the house.
He didn’t stop until they had reached his own bedroom and he was able to put a shut door between them and the world, the only real measure of safety in such a home. He paused for a moment, listening and holding his breath, but there was silence from the hallway. Their father had decided against teaching them a lesson this time. No doubt, Howard would spend the rest of the night holed up with the remainder of the brandy bottle as he ranted and raved to an empty room about the irresponsible and disrespectful of youth of today.
“Hi, Tony! I miss you - lots and lots. I’ve been helping Jarvis in the kitchen,” she explained and he could just picture her almost vibrating with excitement, the phone no doubt being held by both of her hands up to her ear as if that made it easier to be heard.
“If it’s Obie, tell him to wait a minute and I’ll be right up,” he squinted at the screen before him, mind turning over the streams of coded numbers, letters and symbols.
“I haven’t done anything to your sister, Tony. You need to calm down. Perhaps, a more familiar face will help you,” Traveller trailed off slightly, a thoughtful look on his face.
Steve didn’t even attempt to lie.
. I saw the way your Captain looked at you, and you at him,” her tone was upset.
She huffed, cheeks pink, but nodded her head and allowed him to turn and lead the way to The Avenger.
Mugs safely returned, they slowly walked towards the ship. The bonfire was still burning, but there were noticeably less people about. Some of the locals were working on cleaning up already, getting a head start before tomorrow morning.
That was alarming.
On the other hand, the idea of standing before a group of tenacious people who were all out for the best story, irrespective of if it was true, fictitious, or even logical, was terrifying. Tony had been doing press conferences since his father had passed, Stane eager to push him into the spotlight and gain sympathy from the general public for Stark Industries. He had only been able to prevent Darcy from suffering the same fate through a lot of promised favours and dealings with the man. The fact that Darcy went by ‘Lewis’ for the most part, also helped.
“Oh please, don’t try and pretend you weren’t thinking about it. You’ve been practically drooling after Tony for the last few weeks, especially when he’s cleaning and doing all that bending and stretching,” she smirked and Steve felt his cheeks redden at her words.
Medical supplies, he supposed, had been smuggled onto the planet, only for the culprits to have been caught before they could move them on to their real destination. Hence, Steve and his crew found themselves picking up the pieces and taking on cargo of unknown origin. Steve would charge extra for that when they reached their destination.
It took a little over a minute to reach the spacious front sitting room, the sunlight streaming in through the huge glass windows showing off the tastefully maintained garden. An African-American man stood before the windows, staring out at the garden, only to turn at the sound of their approaching footsteps.
“Yeah, sure, you let me know how that goes,” Tony offered a short, two-fingered salute before shooting up into the sky.
, one of his hands caressing it like it was a particularly good dog.
“Kitchen?” he said slowly, the gears in his mind trying to switch tracks from upgrades for the iron man suit, to the location of the kitchen within the Tower.
“Lets,” he said, reaching out and taking the mechanics hand in his, feeling excitement push out the nerves in his chest as Tony immediately laced their fingers together.
“Oh,” Tony said softly, a small wicked smile quirking the corner of his mouth, brown eyes alight with humour. “Oh, I like you. If I give you a pay rise will you let me call you Pepper? I swear, it’s not me making fun of you or anything. I just really liked your pepper spray ninja trick, is all. I even got the security footage of it, if you’d like a copy to immortalise the moment?” he offered.
"I think somethin' can be arranged. The 'verse is big, surely there must be a job or two in that direction," he said softly, eyes darting down to Tony's lips before flickering back to his eyes.
Steve turned back to the controls, Tony would just have to wait, and peered down at the beacon monitor that showed the USC ship as a blinking green dot right beside them. Clint was right, however, there was another, larger dot speeding towards them from behind the USC cruiser.
“Besides, Pepper Potts has a much better ring to it, don’t you agree?”
“Pilot, we are good to go, push the damn lever!” Tony suddenly yelled over the intercom.
“When we haven’t had a job in a while, we usually play passenger convoy for a small group as a oneway ticket to somewhere,” Steve explained.
“Don’t leave me!” he could hear the tears starting up again in her voice, another wave of sobs coming on fast.
“I know, we’re at your door,” Steve said, amused.
“You were drooling on the sheets,” she said dryly.
Even if Tony did decide to snitch on them, Steve was confident that he could have his crew and ship out of the port quick enough to prevent them from being captured.
“Natasha is busy. We’re the only ones up here,” Tony finished, more dramatically then he’d intended, but willing to roll with it.
“Jarvis brought him up to my room after, well,” she pursed her lips, the unpleasant memories apparently still something she remembered.
“Steve, please… baby, please.” Tony rambled, looking like he didn’t even know what he was saying anymore.
“So, thank you, big brother. For making my life amazing. Thank you, Tony, for being the incredible person that you are. We don’t say it enough, but you are so loved by me, and Pepper, and Rhodey. And now you have a new family, one that loves you and accepts you and any faults you think you have, unconditionally,” Darcy said softly.
“Young Miss Darcy and I are not to conspire upon anything relating to the health and wellbeing of you, Sir,” Jarvis promptly responded. “Seeing as this was done for the goodness of my own health, I do not believe we have broken the rule.”
“Move out, Tony,” his voice was one of command, but Tony rarely listened to it without some resistance.
“Okay, everyone, stay calm,” he said.
“This was real nice, Steve,” Tony said.
Tony just rolled his eyes and gave up arguing with her as a bad job. He was feeling a little bit tense now that Steve was in the room. They’d only had their
“Planeta Stark ain't worth stoppin’ on,
“Tony,” Steve murmured, unable to stop himself from pressing a kiss to the mechanics hair as the arm around his waist tightened briefly.
“We’ve got a lot to discuss with you, but that’ll have to wait. I hope you ain’t made those reservations already?”
It was rough, and not particularly attractive, but Tony was incredibly proud of himself for such an accomplishment. Darcy may not properly understand computers and mathematics like he did, but he was sure she would appreciate the way the robotic dog reacted to outside stimuli - that code had taken him almost a week to perfect, without any bugs leaving the poor thing with its jaw hanging open.
Thanks for everyone whose stuck with me throughout the year-long posting of this monster. I can't believe what started out as just an idea of Darcy and Tony being related turned into 60k+ words. Overall I really love this story and, perhaps at a later date, I'll explore more of what happens next.
“Yeah, okay. Hey, Jarvis? Pull up the media response to our little tête-à-tête on the main television. Let’s see how the vultures liked their meal.”
He hoped, for all their sakes - Steve’s most of all - that the man would take his advice and actually start trying to interact with the future beyond the occasional TV session where he sat tense in a chair, frowning more at the clear graphics and colour saturation of the screen than actually watching the movie.
Steve sat with one leg bent, an arm resting on it with his mug of cider held carefully so it wouldn’t spill. Tony sat beside him, body angled mostly towards him and a knee brushing against his hip every time either of them shifted.
His thoughts on Tony would have to wait.
As they settled down together, Steve pressing close and relaxing with Tony safely in his arms, Tony mumbled incoherently.
“No hard feelings, Point Break. You’ve got a mean swing. Just as impressive as I’ve heard,” he casually tapped the man’s bicep as he passed.
“Twenty-five credits is theft.
“Will she…” his voice was soft, almost a whisper as he licked his lips before forcing the words out. “Will she want to play with me?”
“What kind of cake is it?” Thor asked, reminding Tony that there were others in the room. Natasha and Steve were pulling out small plates and forks, while Clint slid the vanilla bean cake off the cooling rack so that they could cut it. Thor had sat himself down at the table to wait for his own piece of cake and Bruce was boiling the kettle, a selection of mugs before him.
“Sure,” Tony said.
“Fan-fucking-tastic.” Tony groaned, staring down at the stump of a sword.
Darcy wasn’t screaming or crying at him. She didn’t even look upset. Instead, she had a small smile on her face, something gentle in her soft, green eyes.
“And here I thought you just fancied yourself a midnight stroll with a touch of monster slaying.” Tony grinned, hand reaching out for Steve’s’ for a brief, affectionate squeeze. An amused huff and an affectionate tightening of fingers was all the response he got before they let go and returned to the situation at hand.
“Of course, Sir,” Jarvis said quietly, English accent thick in his voice.
The two made their way to the elevator and down to the ground level of the Tower in silence. Walking up the street amid the hustle and bustle of New York, as if they were any other duo about to have what could potentially be the first of many dates. Tony had half expected Steve to head towards the nearest Starbucks, so he was pleasantly surprised when he was gently guided down a quieter side street, that broad palm once more upon the small of his back.
“Bye, Darcy,” he smiled slightly as she cut the connection before swivelling around on his stool to face Pepper again.
The weather was already beginning to chill as September approached and Tony found himself in the unusual situation of sitting in a hard-backed chair in the drawing room of Stark manor. A textbook sat open on his lap as he silently read while his father stood before the open fireplace, a glass of brandy reflecting in the flames. The only sounds in the room came from the cracking of the fire, the clink of ice against glass and the steady tick-tick-tick from the ornate clock on the mantle.
While they weren’t exactly lacking in time, he was still acutely aware of the arguments he’d had with Tony about the man not wanting to come to the planet in the first place. Not that he seemed to care much now, not yet having returned to the ship despite the various signs around the port flickering to life.
“I hate job hunting,” Pepper added, a smile flickering to life despite the tears.
“I just think that you should slow it down a bit. One problem at a time. First, work out who tried to hurt you. Then, once we’ve taken care of them, we’ll see about hunting down the weapons.”
He only had the briefest warning of the hud screen before him flashing red in the corner of his eye, before he was suddenly bowled off his feet and through a wall.
Secondly, he would go to his grave with the knowledge that Aldrich was exactly what he could have become, if he hadn’t of had Darcy. Yes, the money was certainly a factor in there somewhere, but he was positive that without Darcy, his life would have been a lot closer to supervillain than superhero.
“I like aliens,” she said simply, before offering him a large, toothy grin, cheeks still wet but the look on her face as if nothing had ever happened. Tony was startled into laughter.
Tony didn’t even appear to have heard the others entre, he was still at the sink, the continuous muttering accompanied by the repetitive wash, rinse, stack in the dry-rack routine.
“Yes. It’s still in my chest. Medicine ain’t yet advanced enough to remove it without loss of life.”
That had been a few hours ago.
“Good. I’ll be back again soon, I’m sure.”
Replacing the Captain America box, he pulled open the robots one and selected one of the larger band aids. Dropping the box back in the open draw, he carefully peeled off the backing and stuck it over her scrapped knee, making sure that the white spongy bit covered the scrap like Jarvis had taught him.
Rumiko had moved to sit on a small, flat bench on the side of the dock. He couldn’t help acknowledging that she looked rather pretty there in her rich clothes in the watery light of night. The clip that held back her dark hair was in her hands and the long strands spilled over her right shoulder.
Anthony Stark – What Ever Happened to the Famously Missing Heir?
“My mistake,” Bruce agreed easily.
“Tony,” her voice was full of wonder and amazement as she stared down at her new ‘pet’.
“I’m goin’ to check the storage holds, keep everyone on task. I ain't wanna linger here,” Steve said, ignoring the tightening of her jaw when he didn’t share his thoughts with her.
“What do you think this Doctor Traveller aims to accomplish there?” Steve asked.
Steve followed them up and into the cargo hold, moving towards the catwalk where the rest of the crew were curiously gathered.
He wasn’t sure if he was imagining it, but Tony looked as though he was about to say something before he made a frustrated sound in the back of his throat and threw up his hands.
There was no way in hell Tony would leave Darcy to face the world alone. He knew he wasn’t the prefect role model or brother, but he would always be there for her, whether she needed him or not. When he got out of here - and it had to be when because he couldn’t bear the thought of her having to bury another family member, Jarvis and their parents had been enough - he was going to change for the better.
“I’m in DC tomorrow,” she continued. “I’m working on the zoning-”
“Dummy! No, just, no. Get out of my face, you menace, you're the reason behind most of the mess in this place,” Tony gently pushed the bot out of his face as he fought a grin, fingers automatically running up and down the bots’ support strut in a familiar and comforting motion.
“Sure, no problem. Just don’t let me see it up on MySpace or anything,” the soldier shuffled across the space between them and posed.
“I’ll miss you. I promise to post lots of pictures on Facebook and give me a ring when Pepper tries to fire you for being a flaky head of R and D,” she said cheekily before slipping away from him to the door.
“Seriously? But, there’s so much stuff here,” Tony gestured with one hand, the other still holding the handle of the cart.
Steve merely stared him down.
“Well,” he began, seeing Steve’s body tense as if expecting a verbal blow. “Do you feel better now?”
“Don’t you dare touch Sir Lucksalot the Third, or I’ll take your precious engine for a service it won’t recover from.”
“There, now you don’t have to have it in your face,” he said.
Clint and Natasha murmured together as Steve looked through the front glass once more, relief sweeping through him.
“It looks like they were out to settle a new colony. They have everythin’ a new ecosystem would need to survive; medicine, food, families of people,” Steve looked around critically. The whole situation wasn’t sitting well with him. He just couldn’t work out where the people had disappeared to.
“I’m just Tony, now,” the brunet finally spoke again.
“Spill, Tony,” she said seriously, and Tony let out a quiet sigh before he explained the whole situation.
“Mr Stark, you need to calm down,” Traveller said, voice still maddeningly calm and patient, as if Tony was nothing more than a child misbehaving.
“Don’t mind him, he’s a little hungover,” Tony turned the phone back so that he could see his sister properly.
Glancing at the mechanic, Steve raised an eyebrow at the amused look on Tony's face as he stared at where Clint was fiddling with one of the crates near the catwalk stairs.
Tony put down his fork and sighed, he crossed his arms over his chest and lent away from the table, eyes raising to the ceiling for a long moment as he clearly gathered his thoughts.
,” she muttered as she walked down the ramp, an expensive looking carriage waiting for her already.
It was three weeks after Clint’s first comment that Steve found himself sitting at the kitchen table with Natasha, the newspaper open before him even though he hadn’t actually paid it any attention since first opening it. Tony was once again in one of his moods, this time continually reaching up and pulling out plates to wipe down with a damp cloth to remove any dust.
He took a second to be thankful that the rest of the crew weren’t around to mock him as he embarrassed himself.
“I know. Once you get an idea in your head, you’re like a dog with a bone,” she sighed, her jeans were slightly singed and dirt smeared her top, Dummy’s head in her lap and restless fingers ran up and down his support strut, a familiar action to them both after years of repetition.
Steve had been politer about it, stopping by on his motorcycle and interrupting Tony as he was on his way to the workshop. After one awkward conversation that had consisted primarily of uncomfortable silences and stilted sentences, Tony had given up and told the soldier he was welcome to stay, ask JARVIS where his floor was, he’d see him later. It hadn’t been one of his braver moments; Tony had to admit.
He had made it a point to leave each of the Avengers to their own space once he’d finished putting in the final decorations and pictures. He didn’t want to make it seem as if he was hovering, that they were staying in a space that he owned and influenced. Well, he did own it, but he’d given them each their own areas and he’d hoped that they’d make them their own.
Steve jerked around to see Clint lurking around the corner, peering at where Steve stood in the back hall between the dining room and the bridge.
“Yeah, I mean, sure. If you want to come down here and sketch that’s not going to bother me,” he shrugged, aiming for casual but he was pretty sure he hit awkward instead.
Everything came to a head when he felt the water creep up his neck, touching his mouth, causing him to breathe in sharply and choke on the water entering his lungs. With no other thought besides getting away from the water trying to drown him, Tony choked out the release code for his armour, the titanium gold alloy falling to the ground with loud clangs and leaving him in the jeans and black shirt he’d shoved on before leaving the Tower only an hour ago.
“Well, I was just going to make normal ones, but,” Bruce glanced at Tony and his lips twitched, a sure sign he was trying not to laugh. “I remembered that Darcy said anything with blueberries in it was sure to draw out mad scientists from their lairs, so,” he shrugged and Tony tried and failed to frown at him.
“Charmed, I’m sure,” Tony nodded awkwardly, the compression core getting in the way.
There were some things Steve didn’t need to force himself to watch.
“With pleasure,” he said, putting on the helmet and focusing on the hud screen before him.
“Just because you made him doesn’t make him yours,” she folded her arms over her chest, pout now firmly in place. The bot, realising they were talking about him, rolled over to Tony and proceeded to shove his camera claw into his face.
“You gotta stop doing this to me, Tones,” Darcy’s voice was soft. They were once more on the old couch in the workshop, the familiar hum of machines around them and the only light was the soft blue glow of the holoscreens nearby.
He won their argument, the perks of being everyone bar Darcy’s boss, and found himself finishing off the first of his cheeseburgers with the cemented feeling that this was it, he was really home.
Steve stared at him for a moment, slightly surprised by how serious Tony was.
Steve smiled and reached out to brush the hair back from Tony’s forehead, mindful of his bandage.
“A giant fly swat. Can of bug spray?” he offered, only half serious.
“Are you okay, Captain?” Natasha asked, the crease above her eyes deepening as she stared at him.
They loved him.
“I’m fine.”
“The ship’s secure, and we all know to meet back here before sunrise tomorrow,” she said, voice sounding perfectly at ease.
The mechanic gave a bland smile before pushing himself to his feet.
“Tony?” her voice was small; childlike in a way he hadn’t heard it in over a decade.
“That’s a lot easier said than done, Captain,” Clint huffed, sidestepping a hunched over man who was shuffling down the dirt compressed road at an impressively slow pace.
“Thought you might find it interestin’,” Clint said. “No signs of any official USC tagging on the debris, so it might yet have been scavenged.”
,” Steve swore, taking the stairs up the catwalk at a run.
Sitting on the kitchen counter, he poked and prodded at his StarkPad, for once not in the mood to really do anything. When Steve had returned from the debrief, he’d wasted no time in tracking down Tony and chewing his ear off. Something about being part of a team meant Tony had to sit through boring-ass breakdowns of fights he had been directly involved in.
“Captain Fury informs me that you and your crew are extremely efficient, Captain Rogers. However,” her eyes finally drifted to Tony and stayed there, Steve’s spine straightening automatically at the perceived threat. “I was not informed about certain members of your crew that will cause something of a… problem.”
“All good?” Tony asked suddenly, having walked up to him with Darcy when Thor and Jane had departed.
“What else?” she asked, wonder in her voice.
“What the hell?” Tony snapped, he really was saying that a lot today…
To his surprise, Tony’s cheeks grew pink, and the man turned away bashfully, looking rather pleased. Steve took that as agreement on Tony’s behalf to revisit the conversation later on, before he turned back to their current job.
Like Steve would.
Darcy’s method of coping with the stress of everything had been to bake her worries away. Needless to say, after the seventh batch of cupcakes and the third tray of cookies, Tony had been sick of sugar and waited until she was asleep before he packed them in containers and sent it all to the local Youth Centre. He was pretty sure after their fifth delivery in as many days, even the workers, who had originally been enthusiastically thankful for the tasty donation, were starting to get strained smiles. His mind ticked over what else he could send them to break up the sweets, possibly a few fruit baskets and some premium steaks.
“Sorry Pep, you’ll have to wait a moment,” Tony grinned unrepentantly as he twitched his fingers through a holoscreen like he’d pressed an invisible button to accept the call.
Resolving that a night out was the best course of action, Steve raised a hand in greeting to Clint and Thor as they emerged from the crowds.
“I want you to do something you enjoy and-”
“You told him stuff about me?” she gasped; rounding on Tony like she was a kid again and Tony had offered to tell her crush of the week that she liked them.
It would make sense, certainly more than his current life did anyway. Tony knew he was a selfish man, and his father had been a drunk. Tony tried not to indulge too often, but what was too much these days? He could very well be a functioning alcoholic and not even realise it. He was reckless and careless too, cashing his car into a tree sounded like something he would do. Not to mention, becoming Iron Man had been like finding salvation, that was three years ago, when the accident had happened. It had seemed like too perfect of a way to make up for all the horrible things that he had done. What if it was all just a dream, something his mind had conjured up to alleviate some of the guilt he felt. He was a terrible enough person that his mind would be twisted enough to pull such a thing off.
“Clint, connect me to them,” he finally said.
The various growls and spitting from the zombie and spiders filled the air, accompanied by the ‘thwak, thwak’ of arrows from animated skeletons. Tony waved his sword around at the enemy like a madman, feeling a sharp sting and warm rush of liquid when one of the arrows went by his cheek too close for comfort. As he fought, Tony spared a glance at Steve, relieved to find him in the process of killing that stupid spider jockey.
“He took the StarkPlayer, Tony! My StarkPlayer! Is nothing sacred to those government agent swindlers?”
Many thanks so the wonderful MxGryffindorOtaku for excellent beta work! Any further mistakes are all on me.
Tony waited until he was sure she had passed into an exhausted slumber before looking up at Obie who had been quietly on the phone in the corner of the room since Tony had sat on the couch.
“It’s a good surprise, I think,” Steve said, voice full of reassurance, if slightly tinged with nerves.
“Oh, my god,” Darcy whistled lowly, eyes going from screen to screen. “Hey, it’s big green!” she pointed her Champagne flute towards where footage of the Hulk could be seen attacking Ross’s men with the sonic cannon from a few years ago.
“It’s a plant,” Tony said stupidly, staring at the leafy bush in confusion.
“It’s stupid o’clock, Tones, why’re you ringing me?” Darcy asked, appearing to be fairly awake despite her complaint. Tony grinned down at the small screen, as the familiar swell of happiness he got every time they spoke filled his chest.
Moving around the space without taking his eyes off the other man, Steve sat down on a chair at a semi-clear worktop and began to sketch.
Steve stiffened where he stood eavesdropping.
“Um,” he cast his mind about in a panic, desperately trying to think of other things he’d wished their mother had done, how he’d wished she'd been. “Alice in Wonderland. It’s a book, it was her favourite. She always used to read and re-read it. I was - that is - I thought you might like it if I read it to you this Summer.”
A small frown dipped between Pepper’s eyebrows and she suddenly stood straighter.
“So,” Tony mumbled again, this time vaguely audible.
“Tony has been travellin’ with us for a while now, of his own free will. You know him, judgin’ by your friendliness with him earlier today.”
“But, if it’s what you really want, do it,” she shrugged, looking at him directly.
“What kind of scientist?” Tony lent forward slightly with interest.
mates?
“I met a man there, he was acting as a medic of sorts. Back on his planet, he’d been one of the finest doctors, but,” Tony let out a small, humourless huff. “He saved my life at one point and soon we got to talking. Before I knew it, we had a plan to escape. Between my innate knowhow of the workings of the ship, the freedom privileges he was allowed due to his medical knowledge, and a lot of luck. We managed to get away in one of the escape pods during a landing.”
“Come on, come on,” she grinned. If Tony hadn’t been so rudely awoken, he’d have been more amused by her excitement then mourning his sleep.
“It would appear that Doctor Traveller was able to get into your mind and use his mutant psychic powers along with the pendent amplifier, to trick you into thinking you were suffering from brain damage and being kept at the Ravencroft Institute for treatment,” Natasha answered when the others looked away, bodies shifting uncomfortably.
When they finally arrived at the drop point, Steve immediately felt himself tense, eyes scanning the rocky, sandy area before them. There was something distinctly cage-like about where they had been informed to meet, and Steve wasn’t about to be cheated out of his money after going to all the trouble of smuggling the supplies halfway across two galaxies.
“What’re you doin' there?” Steve asked, taking a step closer.
“She moved back to Portland,” Phil said mildly, clearly ignoring Darcy’s question.
“Attention unauthorised ship. You will halt all forward motion generators and wait to be boarded. You are under suspicion of illegal trading on a quarantined planet. Don’t do anything
Finally, I don't know where the chicken came from guys, it just appeared and now Clint is a proud pet owner. The world moves in mysterious ways, I guess.
“Oh, wonderful. I can do whatever I like in the mansion now that I don’t need to worry about my sister being in the kitchen at midnight when I’m half awake and seeking coffee in the nude,” Tony said cheerfully, suppressing his own remembered awkwardness when that had happened, the pitch of Darcy’s shriek should be bottled and used to take out enemy foes. Tony had claimed to be half deaf for the next week, much to Pepper’s annoyance and Darcy’s continued embarrassment.
“Hey, baby.” Steve whispered.
The grin that spread across Steve’s face, however, was like he’d just told the man he had an all you can eat buffet lined up for all the orphan kids in New York City.
So... still here. Just, don't look at how long it's taken me to write and put up with chapter. This wasn't quite as dramatic as I wanted it to be, but for some reason I had a lot of trouble getting into Tony's head and not focusing on the things that I had already written about.
“The ship? But, I was to engage in barter with the city folk,” Thor complained, but Steve ignored him, knowing that he would do as asked despite the complaints
“Look,” Tony let out a loud breath through his nose. “I really don’t think we need to sugar coat this, okay?” he dug his fingers into his thighs. “Just tell me flat out that you want me off the team. I can go back to solo work.”
"Yeah, yeah. Tell your pilot to engage the forward motion thrusts on my count. We’re gonna leave that USC ship in our space dust.” Tony sounded positively gleeful, and Steve had a moment to wonder again just who, exactly, he had on his ship.
Tony knew she was eyeing the various metal bits and pieces around the room, her curiosity peaked. It had been a rare thing for her to be in the workshop in the manor, their father having forbidden both his children from ever entering it. Tony had simply pushed all of his father’s work to one side and set up his own computer and workstation equipment to work from.
“Looks like Stark Galactic property,” he continued.
Steve was going to have to made a decision, and fast.
Right, his housemates… or was it
“We’ve no business now,” Steve suddenly said, thinking about the various sights that New, New York advertised as THE place to visit.
As Tony managed to kill off the last of the spiders that had been on his side of the battlefield, he felt the give in his sword and it made a loud cracking sound as it snapped, the iron blade breaking off within the spiders’ body.
Tony had been at a collage party the day he received the call from Obie, telling him in subdued tones that his father had been involved in a fatal car accident, that Jarvis had been behind the wheel and that the other motorist had run a red light; Tony’s first thought was to wonder why bad news always reached him via phone. He then had a near panic attack about Darcy’s whereabouts.
Tony’s mouth actually fell open at that, his eyes now fully dilated with lust and his hands tightening where their had found a home for the moment by clasping Steve’s biceps. Pulling his now soaking finger from the open mouth, Steve wasted no time in reaching down and easily slipping it behind Tony’s cock and balls, running it lightly up the space behind his balls before circling his hole.
He felt guilty; he felt relieved.
The doctor appeared at the top of the catwalk, no doubt having been up in the control room with Clint while the two had waited for the rest of the crew to return.
Pepper looked as put-together as always and, in a single look, observed the situation before her and took control.
“Calm down, Tones, he’s only into interesting stories and me going to uni is hardly interesting. I’m not completely stupid,” she rolled her eyes.
Reaching the central control area, Tony allowed his mouth to keep talking, keeping everyone’s attention there as he casually slipped a small chip onto the side of one of the glass screens, giving Jarvis a point to start hacking his way into SHIELD’s system. Tony wasn’t going to be kept in the dark about what the hell Fury was up to, that’s for sure. He was tired of all this ‘need to know’ crap.
Clint didn’t even bother with his normal banter routine, his hands flying over the controls and doing as he was told. The ship gave a sudden jerk backwards, making Steve and Tony stumble once more. The engine was cut just as quickly and the overhead lights flickered out before the dull blue emergency lights came on.
“No,” Tony groaned, bloody fingers slipped around Steve’s wrist as he tried to pull him away from his shirt.
“Well, let’s go up to watch this movie then. I’m pretty sure that Darcy was about to make some popcorn when I left, she might even have some of that caramel popcorn that you like so much,” the sly tone of Steve’s voice only caused the blush on Tony’s cheeks to intensify, and he all but hightailed it to the elevators in an effort to give himself a few precious seconds to try and get himself under control.
“You laughed at me every time you saw me for the next week,” she said dryly, an unimpressed look on her face.
“I’ve been working on important things, Pep,” Tony pushed himself out of bed, absentmindedly noting his pillow on the floor.
Tony didn’t completely believe what they were all saying, but he didn’t completely not believe it, either.
Usually, Steve was happy to let Tony go down to the workshop and fix his problems with the newfound solution, but that half finished hand print just wouldn’t leave him alone and without another thought, Steve was up and out of his chair, grabbing his sketchbook and pencil before chasing after the genius.
Tony proved to be more difficult to follow than Steve had anticipated. He was slippery, taking advantage of other people as distractions, and was generally well practiced in the art of stealth. It made Steve even more curious about what the story behind his potentially new mechanic might be.
“Tony!” Steve’s voice was like a balm to his raw nerves and Tony felt something in his chest loosen at the sound.
“So, you know, now,” he said.
“How is Darcy?” Tony asked, sitting forward with both feet planted firmly on the ground, his whole attention focusing on Jarvis’s voice, listening closely for any change in tone or inflection.
It was nice to know that he was just as excited about this.
Originally, he had hoped to have it ready by her seventh birthday, but, with all his university commitments, he hadn’t been able to finish it in time. Still, it was only a little bit late and he just knew that she’d love it. Well, he hoped she’d love it, anyway.
“It was, but someone’s crew can’t seem to keep themselves out of trouble for a single night,” Tony teased him.
“Jarvis, you traitor,” Tony groaned.
“Yes, Jarvis,” Tony said dutifully. He didn’t really want to see her all that much, but he knew that Jarvis wanted him to want to. Ever since the announcement had occurred, the butler had been very excited about the newest edition to the Stark family. Tony didn’t really understand what the big deal was. It was just another person he would rarely see in the huge mansion he lived in.
“So, I’m going to head to bed,” he stood up and began edging towards the elevators.
“I wouldn’t have so many people to look out for,” Natasha said softly, Russian accent unusually thick in her voice.
Turning away from where the white lights had been glaring down at him for the past four hours, he frowned slightly at the now familiar sight of his sister standing at the bottom of the stairs, her hair messy from sleep and still in her sleep shirt and pants, both sporting cartoon drawings of green Martians and cliché, disk shaped spaceships. They may or may not have been specially made for her as she’d refused the ones offered to her with the word ‘princess’ scrawled all over it along with pink, sparkly tiaras.
No one was particular impressed with his announcement, with words like PTSD and mental stability already being whispered behind his back. Tony didn’t really care what anyone else thought. He knew what he was doing was for the best, as long as he had his people in his corner, it was okay. Obie would come around, once he saw the ideas Tony had for the future of SI. They were going to scrap the weapons entirely and move into more commercial markets like phones and tablets. He was going to bring in the big money through new ideas in green technology; saving the planet was a worthy cause, surely.
“Please keep us updated on the progress of finding a replacement, Director,” Steve politely requested.
“Thor, it was your turn to empty the dishwasher last night,” Darcy complained, shooting the god an annoyed look, somewhat offset by the old MIT shirt she was wearing and the short sleeping shorts, her sleeping attire topped off with pink and yellow polka dot slippers on her feet.
“Miss Potts had a hunch.”
“Oh, wow.” he grinned at her, looking from the paper to her big, waiting, green eyes.
Fury disconnected the call without another word.
“You know you shouldn’t stay up so late.”
“Work on those StarkPhone designs. I want them by the start of next week so I can present them to the board. I’ll put Jarvis on your case if you don’t,” she threatened, making Tony roll his eyes out of reflex alone.
“Yeah, no, that’s a problem, Captain,” Tony’s voice had taken on a tension Steve hadn’t heard before and he tore his eyes away from the Skiff ship to look at the man beside him.
“What’re they sayin’?” he demanded as soon as he entered the bridge.
“Captain, hate to interrupt your interrogation, but we’ve collected a USC tail from Tadamori.”
“God, you’re so hot like this.” Steve moved back slightly so that he could see the expression on Tony’s face as he repeated the movement with his finger, the warmth in his gut almost exploding into a fire down to his toes at the expression of bliss on the other mans face.
“Tony?” Darcy whispered from where she was curled up into a small ball against the front of one of the seats.
“Those were the days,” Darcy sighed happily.
“Hey, you weren’t the only one scarred from that,” he protested, hiding the smirk trying to break free on his face.
“I’m not interested in the customs developed on planets by various settlements. I’m looking at the biochemical make up of humans and how that’s developed after being exposed to various foreign stimuli.”
“It doesn’t,” Pepper said, deadpan.
It was, for the most part, an unspoken and precarious agreement between the two.
However, when the doors opened, he found himself not in his workshop, but on the communal floor of the Tower. He had a moment of surprise, before panic hit him and he opened his mouth to tell Jarvis to close the doors, to take him away. Steve, however, was faster, and before Tony could do more than utter a noise of protest, the man had grabbed him and pulled him from the elevator.
“Tony, would you like to get coffee with me, sometime, maybe?”
That got everyone’s attention, even Tony forced himself into a sitting position, gulping down the rest of his coffee as he listened intently.
Frankly, Tony thought the one-eyed pirate should have been grateful he’d gone at all.
Steve frowned immediately at the name. The Ten Rings was an organisation that had no moral code. They were famed for their ability to snatch people off the streets of even the most fortified of planets. The people that fell victim to them were never heard from again, but rumours of the torture and heavy experimentation that they suffered at the Ten Rings hands were enough to turn even the most iron clad of stomachs. Steve, himself, had only ever heard the rumours, though more than a few passing travellers in various bars and taverns on planets both near and far knew someone who was related to one of the alleged victims.
“The thing that no one can seem to figure out it what, exactly, it’s doin’ there.”
people, were killed as long as he was pocketing the money for it.
“Is everyone okay?” Bruce’s voice came from the entrance to the bridge.
Darcy grinned the widest yet before blowing him a kiss.
“For what? For giving me an image of a loving, caring mother who wanted me? For providing me with a way to take comfort from a woman I had never really met? Tony, you gave me the most incredible gift anyone has ever given me. You gave me memories of a woman who loved me, and would have been proud of me. The only thing I’ve been more grateful for in my life is having you as my brother,” she moved so that she was right before him, their eyes locked, her gentle green on his confused brown.
"You know you're part of my crew, right?"
A sudden loud growl came from his left, causing him to swing around, sword at the ready. Unfortunately he also managed to catch his foot on a small mound of dirt, falling over into a dip in the ground at the same time. Crashing into unforgiving dirt and stone, Tony had a moment to wince at the pain radiating from his calf, no doubt bruised if not scraped by the impact. Then, looking up, he saw a Zombie approaching him in the moonlight, sickly green arms outstretched and ratty clothing stained with dark liquids.
“Shiny,” Tony said, a grin breaking out over his face, only serving to make him look both younger and more attractive.
Working with Bruce was, simply put, fun. Tony rarely had the opportunity to work with people who were on par with his own intelligence. It wasn’t him being obnoxious or conceited; Tony was simply a genius with the intellect to match the title. While he knew, he was probably ahead of the other man in terms of electro-physics and engineering, on gamma radiation the doctor held the largest quantity of knowledge and Tony was content to keep up with him via the papers he’d read and information he’d sourced.
– Jesus
A humanoid creature that was once recognisable, who went mad from staring into the darkness of space, and violent from exposure to primitive engine’s radioactive generators. They were said to slice up their own skin, shove bits of metal into it to disfigure it further, then cannibalise their fellow man. They would hunt in packs on their ships, trapping victims before raping them to death, eating their flesh and then sewing their skin into their clothing. If the victim was lucky, they’d even do it in that order.
“Tony, I’m going to take the jet to DC tonight,” Pepper suddenly said, pulling Tony from the images before him. Looking over, he could see she’d set her flute down on a table, her eyes flickering between the holoscreens continually.
He felt broken open, that the people before him were staring into the very yolk of his soul and his normal barriers and self-censoring were completely wrung dry and not kicking in.
Tony was still leaning over the luggage where he’d tripped before, body oddly tense and Steve’s already whirling mind immediately jumped to all manner of conclusions before he forced himself to calm down and think rationally.
“No,” he said, eyes unwavering. Then, despite his words, he continued. “You’re very good at that.”
“So, what did you call us here for?” Steve got straight to business. There was no point in pleasantries when both parties were tense around the other.
Clint sent him a salute which was mostly sarcastic, but Steve knew the man would do as he’d asked, before walking up the ramp himself, Tony on his heels.
“His first name is ‘Agent’,” Tony followed after Pepper as she approached the agent.
“You did good, Tony,” he said, hand reaching out and clasping Tony’s arm for a moment through the open window.
“Are you sure this is what you want to do?” Darcy asked quietly, looking down at him from where his head was resting on her lap, the rest of his sore body stretched out on the couch in the main lounge room of the Malibu mansion.
“Darcy,” Tony sighed, looking down for a moment before he looked back up at her.
“I can’t say it’s a pleasant surprise, however, Tony.”
How annoying.
“Fine, go to Planeta Stark, you are the
“Said, you’re bet’r ‘n cleanin’.” Tony murmured, sighing happily.
“Tony?” a small voice drew his attention.
Tony snorted, ignoring the twinge of pain that caused, as the two lapsed once more into silence. He reached up and tapped lightly on the arc reactor, his mind turning over how he was going to improve it now that he had access to the best equipment money could buy - and some of it that only a genius could create. There was no way in hell he was keeping such an outdated piece of tech in his body for longer than he already had.
The companion profession was extremely difficult to get into, and brought with it a sense of respectability that a lawless ship like theirs desperately needed when dealing with the USC. While some might class companion’s as nothing more than godless whores, those with educated backgrounds and social sense knew that with a companion on your arm, you could get into almost any social event.
“I’m okay, Thor’s with me and fine too. Nothing more than bruises,” Bruce’s calm voice came over the system and Steve felt something in his stomach unclench.
“I’m thinking about making Pepper CEO of SI, unless you have any objections?”
“This is urgent,” Phil ignored the sibling byplay.
“Tony, come on. Think rationally about this. Doesn’t the world you’ve created in your head not make any sense? How could you be a superhero named Iron Man, saving the world every other week? Your delusions have cost you your sister and most of your friends. We just want to help you before you lose everything,” Steve’s voice was gentle, but Tony felt his heart seize.
“F’r science.” Was all Tony said before he started to softly snore.
“I-I’m sowwy!”
Then, in a freak mission where the resistance had been able to force back the governments’ troops, an order had come via wave into the bridge.
Steve didn’t know if he appreciated her bluntness, or if the slight feeling of unease at the back of his neck was too big of a warning to do so.
Steve waited until they were set on an orbit of the planet before motioning Clint and Natasha to follow him from the bridge.
“Ready?” Steve looked to Thor who was securing his bubbled helmet in place, a large grin stretched across his face as he raised a hand, thumb upwards.
Oh. That was different.
“Uh, nice to meet you too?” Bruce offered, sending Tony a bemused look.
There was a beat before Tony suddenly stuck his head back into the den, nose scrunched up and a teasing glint in his eyes.
– Why are these jobs never easy?
“You know,” he huffed, laughter in his voice. “I’m almost tempted to keep you alive. All the things you surely saw on the Ten Rings’ Station? Some of the most cutting edge technologies available to us today.” He leaned closer to Tony’s face, their eyes locked and the sour smell of the Tabaco that Obie liked to say he received as a gift, but Tony knew was actually harvested from the poor on the small planet of Penthesilea, filled his lungs. He had always hated the smell of it.
“Tony, I’m hungry,” Darcy’s voice was just this side of a whine, but quiet enough that Rhodey wouldn’t have been able to easily make out her words. She may still be young enough yet to get away with inappropriate conversation topics and demands, but she had been quick to learn from their father that if no one else heard it, it had never happened.
“This is a brilliant idea, Darc,” Tony said, serious.
“We’ve been making sweets. Jarvis says I’m real good at it. We made gingerbread men and women as well as a dog, yesterday!”
“Look at this here. He’s going to be my new helper bot for the workshop. I’ve just finished wiring him and writing all his code out. You want to help me activate him?” he offered, a small nod all he needed for confirmation.
“I aim to please, Sir.”
company’s, logo on the side of those bombs and rockets in enemy hands.
“Come on, we can always do with a little bit of extra luck on our side. A bountiful year sounds pretty good to me,” he grinned.
“What’s a pinky pwomise?” she stared at his hand in confusion.
Tony’s insisted clenched and bile burned the back of his throat. When it had become clear that Darcy didn’t possess the staggering intellect both Tony and Howard did, their father had become even colder towards her then before. Tony had always known that even if Darcy was a child prodigy, Howard’s staunch disregard for the idea of a Stark woman holding a place in his company would hinder her later in life. The fact that she was smart, but not genius level smart, meant Howard had all but struck her from any kind of importance in his life. Tony had nightmares about the day Howard stopped thinking of Darcy as a mere inconvenience and decided she was more trouble than the public relations scandal of marrying her off to be someone else’s problem.
“Come on, a pay rise and the allowance to call you Pepper. I’m sorry, but I honestly cannot go around calling you
“There’s someone here to see you,” she blurted out before she’d even reached the last step, her breathing audible from where Tony was sitting.
Then there was the Avengers. A superhero groups that included Tony? Who the hell was he trying to kid? There was no way in hell that such a group - even if it could actually exist - would include Tony Stark. Not after the kind of life he had led.
They rounded the corner and Tony could see that the voice had belonged to Doctor Bruce Banner.
Eyes still squinting slightly, Steve looked around to find Tony, heart jumping slightly when he spotted him turning into a narrow space between buildings, off the main pathway.
“Yes, is it working?” Steve asked, not even bothering to lie and seeming to be genuinely interested in how successful his guilt tripping abilities were.
“Hello, still in the room with you,” Darcy’s voice was loud and cut through the moment, causing Tony to groan and bury his face in Steve’s chest as the blond chuckled.
The peace of the room was broken by the sudden opening of the door, a sniffling sound reached Tony’s ears as he turned to see his sisters’ small form step inside. Her long brown hair tumbled down her shoulders in a mess, a clear sign that she had been recently playing, her pale blue dress was noticeably creased and her big green eyes were glassy with tears.
Tony stared at the dark screen for a moment before snorting as he shoved his phone back into his pocket.
“No one would instruct me on how to best procure my delicious pop tart delicacies.”
“I’m not going to dignify that with an answer,” he said around another bite of toast, eyes wandering to examine the elevator’s interior rather than looking at her.
“Yeah?” a smile formed on her own.
It did the trick and Tony tilted his head slightly, looking at Steve with a tired expression. Something about Tony’s whole demeanour appeared exhausted and in the back of his mind, Steve wondered if Tony had been getting enough sleep.
“Jasmine,” he found himself saying, looking slightly over Darcy’s head, unable to lie to her face but unwilling to stop his tongue when it started. “She smelled like jasmine, I think it was something to do with her perfume?” A lie. Maria Stark had favoured whatever was most popular at the time. Tony could distinctly remember the orange coconut fragrance of that year and, whenever a woman passed him by smelling of Escada, he had to double check it wasn’t her. “And she, she smiled a lot. A nice smile, like the ones you see moms on TV give their kids,” he glanced at Darcy, slightly taken aback at her undivided attention, little hands clutching excitedly at the armrest of the chair.
“Okay, we’ve filled your quota for stupid, can we find that compression core and get of this hunk of rock now?” Clint bitched.
Tony lent back in his own chair with an innocent looking smile, but his brown eyes sparked with mischief and Steve immediately realised the trap he’d walked right into. The alcohol made him more amused then annoyed at being played quite so blatantly, at least that’s what he told himself anyway. Steve had the disturbing suspicion that it would take a long stay in the deepest pits of the Dark of the ‘verse to get him mad enough to stay angry at Tony.
Curious, Steve crouched beside the bag and pulled out one of the sparkling items, only to almost drop it in surprise a moment later.
Calling the man a ‘Capsicle' was rude, even if it did hold the ring of truth and amuse him.
Her red painted lips parted on a laugh.
“She’ll be thrilled,” Tony snorted. The weird back and forth thing with the StarkPlayer that Darcy and Phil did was a mysterious game that Tony didn’t even pretend to understand. “Now, what’s this I hear about a cellist?” Tony couldn’t keep the grin off his face this time, pleased when the smallest amount of surprise flickered across the agents face.
“Any ships nearby?” he asked.
“Ow!” he hissed, pulling his leg away from her.
Blinking rapidly, Tony took note of Clint standing near the actual door to the room - as opposed to the large hole in the wall where Traveller was positioned - an arrow straining to be let loose on the wannabe sorcerer. Natasha stood to the right of the archer, gun raised and ready to be used at a moment's notice. Both were fully decked out in their Avengers uniforms and Traveller himself was once more in his ridiculous get-up.
“Welcome back, Master Anthony.”
Steve stood staring stupidly at Tony’s door for a long minute, just grinning at nothing, before he shook himself and turned, heading for his own quarters.
It didn’t stop them, however, from manoeuvring it so that Steve ended up seated next to Tony. It also didn’t prevent Steve, when his leg accidentally knocked against Tony’s under the table, from resting it there firmly.
“It is good for the public image of Fujikawa Industries. It shows a healthy competition to our buyers and a trustworthiness,” she said, voice still patiently polite.
“It’s still got another thirty minutes or so, Tones. Why don’t you go bother someone else in the meantime?” she poked him with her warm mittens once she’d closed the door again, a smile curving her lips.
“Ah,” a voice from the kitchen entrance pulled Steve’s attention away from the sight before him, his eyes automatically narrowing into a glare at the sight of Clint.
: my poor baby.”
It was a stupid, foolhardy idea that was bound to get him yelled at later on. Pepper would be furious with him, and the public would once again be gossiping about what a reckless playboy he could be. If Darcy saw it she’d probably just sigh.
“Come on, let’s go,” Steve just grinned, ignoring the comment as he stepped back and gestured to the elevator.
“Hey, I like that. Tony, when I decide to have a career change, remind me to put that on the sign of my cupcake business as the slogan,” she said, grinning at him.
“It’s movin’ faster than the standard Skiff ship,” Steve muttered, peering at it in confusion.
Darcy made an odd squealing noise, normally associated with teenyboppers in the presence of hot young male celebrities, and pulled on his arm as, apparently, his sedate pace wasn’t to her liking.
“Yes, just like you told me to,” she sounded pleased with herself.
Across the table from them, Clint and Thor hung off one another’s’ shoulders, Bruce having been dragged under Thor’s other arm, and their voices cresting in the end of their song.
“This is a ridiculous reason to base your education on,” he griped, determined not to give in to the big green eyes that once more filled the screen.
“Hey, Darcy,” he grinned, unable to help laughing slightly at the excited exclamation of his name in response.
“It’s a notebook, from the Skow ship,” he explained, voice tinged with confusion as to what the hell Tony was up to.
Steve frowned as he realised what their only potential option was.
, after all,” he yelled before he turned on his heel and stomped off to the engine room.
“Yeah,” Tony said quietly, pulling up a small smile. “Her first name was Maria, like your middle name, which made her name Maria Stark.” Darcy nodded slightly, looking down for a moment before she seemed to gather herself and look back up at him with determination.
“This might be serious. Coulson doesn’t look so good,” Darcy said quietly from her place at his side.
"Don't kill him, we need him to steer the ship," Tony called up after him, laughter in his voice.
“I’m not in,” he said immediately. “I’m actually out.”
Steve couldn’t help the snort that escaped him.
“Yeah, I think we need to start working on Natasha’s Widows’ Bite, that looked like it was taking ages to do recharge.” Tony allowed himself to get lost in thoughts of schematics and power voltages as he approached the Tower.
“Phil! Come in,” Pepper turned to him with a welcoming smile. “Have some Champagne.”
“Not Jarvis, our lovable AI overlord. I mean our butler as kids, Edwin Jarvis,” Darcy slowed what she was doing, her voice softening for a moment, before she seemed to pull herself together and projected enthusiasm into her voice.
“Steve, please, I was good, please, fuck me, please, Stevie.” Tony begged, voice sounding wrecked.
“Here,” Steve said with a flourish of his free hand in the direction of a small, potted plant sitting on the previously empty corner of the kitchen, beside the cabinet containing pots and pans.
“Bruce said he’s never seen somethin’ like it before.”
“Really? I’m positive he got stuck last week on that ridiculous glider suit he was playing around with. I know he doesn’t clean up after himself so he must have left a pile of cleaning supplies somewhere around here.” She trailed off thoughtfully, her eyes actually looking around the area as if there would be said supplies still lying on the ground.
Steve obliged, pushing his finger against Tony’s hole, having to hold back a groan at how easily it gave way to him, as if the body below him knew who he was and welcomed him back. Tony was always so hot, to tight and soft inside; it was enough to drive Steve insane. Then there were the noises Tony made, involuntary little hitches of breath and mewls of pleasure as Steve pushed his finger in to the knuckle.
“Yeah, but you can’t see what’s happening up-to-date on that thing. The Internet lets you see the news as it’s happening, anywhere in the world,” Tony said, carelessly as he selected a red frosted cupcake and replaced the dome. He turned around just in time to see Steve’s whole body tense defensively, the paper now bunched between his fingers on the table top, his blond head bowed to hide his expression.
But, Tony then smiled softly at him, the smile Steve was quickly beginning to crave seeing on a daily basis, and squeezed his hand.
Justin Hammer.
Steve trailed after the mechanic as he suddenly made a beeline for one of the stalls, bits of metal catching the light beneath a tattered looking tarp. By the time Steve reached Tony's side once more, the man was already rapidly speaking to the vendor, dexterous fingers flittering out to touch and poke at various pieces of machinery.
“I thought, since you’ve decided to move to New York on a semi-permanent basis, that you might need a bit of extra help in the workshop. You know, so you don’t drive Jarvis up the wall with your menial demands,” Darcy smirked.
Pulling his thumb from his mouth, he peered at it for a moment before sighing.
“Just get me home, Happy,” he said softly, feeling wrung out and exhausted.
He brought his mug to his mouth and finished it off, placing the clay mug off to the side in the grass.
Thor and Natasha were already heading back to the Avenger, tired but cheerful after another successful job.
“Here,” Darcy said, passing Steve one of the bowls of popcorn she and Bruce and brought in from the kitchen, Tony immediately perked up upon finding that he had the caramel covered popcorn next to him.
“So, where are you from, Tony?” Bruce finally spoke up, looking slightly amused at the man’s antics.
Happily, he extended an invitation for the man to come back to Stark Tower, something he knew they’d both enjoy, as there was nothing better than working on genius level stuff with cutting edge equipment.
“Okay, Jarvis, my main man, let the good Captain in and let’s see what he wants.”
In fact, Steve wasn’t actually sure why Tony had been waiting in the cargo hold for them in the first place. Why the man had seemingly pulled that gun from nowhere again and had begun firing away with an unusual degree of accuracy for someone who claimed to be a traveller and sometimes mechanic.
“Right, let’s get going, Point Break,” Tony said, engaging the thrusters and shooting into the sky to the top floor of the building. Entering via the fire escape, Tony lost sight of Thor fairly quickly amongst the chaos within. There were papers and random objects scattered all over the floor, some of the patients were cowering in fear on the floor - those Tony ignored, if they hadn’t started acting violent yet, it was unlikely that they would start now if left alone.
It was getting to a point that Tony was actually surprised if Steve
The motion caused the man’s black singlet to pull up each time he reached upwards, exposing a frankly tantalising sliver of tan skin at his hips.
Pepper gave a little nod to Tony before turning and leaving with the click-click of her heels.
“What a coincidence, I happen to know a mechanic with the same name. Might I enquire as to his family name?” she asked, voice still light and polite, but her eyes were sharp.
“Wrist brace,” Tony held up the invention innocently. “Much better than whatever crap SHIELD has had you currently using. I’m almost finished it, I just need to make the final adjustments based on fit. So, gimme,” he reached out once more for Clint’s wrist and the man hesitantly allowed him to attach the brace.
Reaching into one of the pockets of his space suit, Steve pulled out a small, rectangular piece of metal that had set him back a few hundred credits on the black market. Attaching it to the lock, he pushed the small button on the side of it and took a hurried few steps back. Nothing seemed to happen for a moment, before a buzzing of electricity and a cracking sound filled the silence around them. Finally, the satisfying sound of a clicking lock was heard.
“Finally, someone who speaks English,” he walked over to the man, silently admitting that he could now weigh in on Darcy’s rants about how amazing and handsome the good doctor was.
Steve felt his cheeks flush pink as he realised Tony hadn’t even glanced over to where he’d pointed. The idea that Tony was happy to go wherever Steve suggested, merely because it was Steve that had suggested it, sent a thrill of happiness up his spine.
Tony still wasn’t convinced. Going on a systematic witch hunt for a misguided fool who had played around with gamma radiation and the super soldier serum just left him feeling… uncomfortable.
“You looked like an idiot.”
Steve.
Steve couldn’t help the way his nose crinkled up as he regarded the man before him. The homophobic moron must be three sheets to the wind to think Steve would even look twice at him, no matter how many drinks he’d had.
“Not you guys,” Darcy waved a hand dismissively. She looked at him dead on with a huge smile on her face before speaking.
Steve privately thought that the last bit was a little uncalled for, they hadn’t actually done anything stupid – yet.
“Huh… people,” Tony said, before occupying his mouth with taking another sip of coffee, this time reigning in the sounds and words that built up in the back of his throat at the warm taste of the nectar of the gods. Seriously, how Thor lived without the stuff until his brief stint on Earth in New Mexico, Tony had no idea.
“But, custom on this planet is that if your next year is destined to be extremely bright and prosperous, the fire eats the corn husk so quickly that it burns your hand, cautionin’ you to be thankful for the gifts you’re about to receive.”
sent vibrations throughout the vessel, so strong that they felt as if they were rattling through Steve’s very body. Tony stumbled during the impact, and Steve grabbed for him, hauling him into the space between his chest and where he was holding onto the metal lip of the control station.
At least his homework wouldn’t take him very long, and it was lunch time soon so he was guaranteed a break from the tedious work. After lunch, he might even be able to convince Jarvis to let him have the rest of the day off and finish his Summer schoolwork tomorrow. Tony knew he wouldn’t be able to bargain for building anything, the man wouldn’t be that easily swayed, but he could probably get Darcy from her half-day lessons and together they could go outside and play in the large area just off the back of the conservatory. Darcy loved her imaginary games, and Tony had specifically read Alice in Wonderland five times over the school term to be sure that he had it memorised. He just knew she would adore the characters and even he couldn’t sit through another 'Adventure with Captain America' or princess tea party with all the stuffed toys in the house.
Darcy deserved that much, at least.
So even if they occasionally came across a half polished table leg, the polish container sitting on the floor with the rag still in it, completely discarded, they just put it away for the moment as they knew the next time Tony needed something to clean, they’d point him in the right direction.
Hearing his sister had been kidnapped, Tony had immediately attempted to contact his father to find out what was being done to get her back.
“No.”
If Tony was a spy for the USC, one of those filthy people who rose in the ranks through turning in people who tried to flee and escape, who just wanted freedom without hurting anyone…
