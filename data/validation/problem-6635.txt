“Yeah, right?” Tony agreed. “We’re supposed to be in this together. Like the fellowship or something. We’re a team.” Even without the pack, they were still the Avengers. Sure, when he worked with Bruce in the lab, they avoided talking about the team, but it was still a team. Or was it just a pack now? In the background the pack bristled and Tony cringed at the feedback. “The Avengers, you know?”
Inside the world trembles but Tony’s able to nod in agreement. He lets Steve place him just so. The back of the lounger is toward the glass doors, and the sunbeam strikes Tony partially over his face but mainly in his chest. One arm is on the back of the lounger. Steve has him look slightly away so that the sun isn’t in his eyes. His legs are stretched out on the lounger with one leg bent.
Pepper huffs at him but it isn’t annoyance. He can tell by the pitch. “Why you call it Dummy, I’ll never know. It’s the only one with an embedded AI system.” She hands him to the folded rod.
Eating does not sound like an activity he wants to partake in at this moment. His headache pounds and his stomach flops over. He flinches at the smell of the food.
“And they destroyed all of that,” Tony said. His eyes were bloodshot and his hair was a mess. “I would burn them to the ground and it still wouldn’t be enough.”
Secretions. Tony’s saliva with the healing factor to close up the wound on his chest. Steve hadn’t showered. He didn’t have the time. He’d washed up. That was all. He offered a curt nod and then exited the office.
It becomes fairly clear as they head toward the main living rooms of the complex that Ultron depends entirely on Steve’s memories of the new compound in Upstate New York. Some of the structure of the corridors aren’t complete, signifying that Ultron’s access to his mind and memories teeters on superficial. Steve knows this part of the compound is complete; Tony ensured that the living quarters came first in the building. Ultron’s lack of knowledge might be the key to Steve’s escape.
Tony attempts to see over the bastard's shoulder and the monster grabs hold of him to drag him away from Steve. "Let go of me you god damn monster."
Steve smirked. He had been so out of touch with everything, he hadn’t even known she was gone. Over the last few weeks since he finally woke up and walked out of the medical lab in Wakanda, he’d cocooned himself in his little apartment. It wasn’t that he didn’t care what was happening in the outside world. He wasn’t that he didn’t want to know what was happening. It was that he didn’t know if the outside world would consume what was left of him before he managed to piece himself back together.
“Yep. And I promise you won’t die. It was one of my first tests to see if I could live like this. If I could still engineer and fix things. Took me years to finish, but I did it and it proved a lot to me.”
Obviously, the biometric scans are useless after a few days’ separation of the vampire. That was useful information. Steve filed it away for another day and then watched as Clint expertly piloted the helicopter through the rain clouds. Lightning sliced the sky, but Clint showed no fear as he dove the copter into the chop of the storm. It bumped and rolled but Clint kept it under control.
Yet, Steve couldn’t touch Tony without cringing and racing away. That happens to be the cherry on top when Tony thinks about it. The bizarre middle distance stare, the feeling as if Steve’s walking between his past and present. Maybe Tony isn’t all that Steve had hoped, maybe he’s looking for a way to go back to Logan. Tony throws down the last of his work. If this is going to work, then Steve needs to be honest with him. Starting with lunch today, Tony vows to figure out what the hell is going on.
The high pitches whine of an AI in distress wakes him. He feels movement, quick and decisive next to him. It takes him a while to shake off the depths of slumber to realize that what he’s hearing isn’t normal, to realize the screech of Jo-Jo and Penny is nothing short of a death howl. He jolts to wakefulness but it doesn’t matter because a brutal fist slams into his face and he crashes back against the headboard and then topples to the bed. He tries to shield his head as someone grasps his hair and wrenches him from the bed.
“It just occurred to me. Every time I think about it, I feel something different, something deeper.” He sees it over and again in his head, the moment Steve dropped down to the floor. It will always be a memory seared into his head, but it’s different now. The memory is changing. Maybe Tony’s ill, maybe it’s early signs of dementia. That’s not it, and Tony knows it. It’s something different, something worse.
“Is that why your muscles are trembling?” Tony grits back. “I know a shock rod injury when I see one.”
It is Tony’s voice once again that arouses him. “I want you to know that I’m not taking away your consent. I don’t want you to think that this is the Middle Ages, and I would do that to you.” As Steve peers through half lidded eyes, Tony faces away from him. “I had a lot of time to think about it. To let the anger ease off. I can’t say I’m completely over it, the idea of my mom being alive-.” His voice falters. “That she was alive, that dad was alive after the crash. My mom was calling out for help, and he killed her. That – it’s not something I can get over so easily, you know?”
He could do it himself, but the fact remains they have a new blacksmith in town who will be good use for hitches, metal working, locks, even some issues with guns and rifles. Plus he needs to know if Stark can do the job, can respect the importance of a horse in the sagebrush. He needs to figure out if Stark is any good or if he’s only a rich boy hanging out and pretending he’s some kind of cowpuncher.
Steve claws his way toward Tony, scraping through the icy daggers until he’s able to crawl the last few meters to his side. Tony’s lying prone in the snow and Steve throws down his own bag in order to maneuver him onto his back. The new armor presents a problem since Steve doesn’t know where the emergency release switch is.
She removed her arm from his back and then reached for his hand again, holding it tightly. “Did you feel violated?”
“Thanks,” he says and tips his hat as he heads toward the Stark residence. He doesn’t even think anything of it until he’s at the door, quilt in hand, and knocking. He hadn’t intended to give in to his whims, but he isn’t, is he? He’s only delivering a quilt and picking up the boy.
“Well, since you declared you’re Iron Man and nearly died of palladium poisoning I got used to strange and mysterious things with Tony Stark,” Rhodey replied. “Tell me.”
“You have your family.” Clint tapped Steve’s wrist with the bottom of his own water bottle. “You’d do anything to protect it, right?”
“Lord, what are you a teenager?” Tony grimaced. “It’s a saying. Nothing to it. At all.” Lies, lies, lies. He kissed Steve and Steve kissed him. The first was a messy kiss – the kind where his teeth hit Steve’s – but at the same time it set fire to all his nerves and he thought the hair on the back of his neck stood up. The second had been rushed and bashful, but so sweet like a kiss delivering a promise of something better. All he could think of was getting his hands on Steve again. He wiped at his eyes and shook his head. God, when was the last time he slept? How long had he been down in the workshop since London? He forced himself to concentrate on the here and now. “You should be ashamed of yourself.”
“I know, I know. The tunnel to the garage. Let’s get there.” Steve gripped Tony’s wrist. Letting adrenalin energize him, Steve rushed out of the room and down the hallway with Tony in tow.
Finding Steve on the riverbank shocked Tony as he flew low over the scene. The deep-seated tug inside of him Tony ignored at that moment. He pretended it was nothing but instinct, but now he realized it must have been something more. He’d picked Steve up, ruined and beaten, flying him to the nearest hospital. JARVIS guided him. Even as he left the suit at the entrance to the emergency room, holding onto Steve as nurses and doctors surrounded them, Tony’s heart hurt. He couldn’t describe it in any other way. The pain spread and when he touched Steve’s hand as the nurses begged him to leave as Steve was placed on the gurney Tony felt something shocking and pure in his chest. In a daze, Steve awoke, focused on Tony for one pristine second, and spoke one word, just the one.
Steve took it at face value and repeated, “I’m going to be in town tomorrow to see Bruce, and I thought it would be nice to get together. Maybe have dinner?”
With that completed, Tony had nothing to do but wait and find out if his mate was still alive. He flashed through the news updates only to find report on a woman who may have seen Captain America and ‘another guy’ stealing an old truck from a repair shop. It seemed an inconsequential detail at the time, but when Tony hacked into the city cameras to find that, yes, it was Steve, he cursed. He spent the next few hours cleaning the information of Steve’s whereabouts out of the city’s database. It took nearly nothing since there was no real security, not against his technology. After that it was a wait and see game. Word came that Natasha received his call and would answer it. Tony didn’t know whether to be happy or to be concerned.
“It’s fine. I can barely feel it,” Steve says. He knows that’s because of the vibranium, making it light and comfortable. “It’s vibranium.” He shouldn’t say it, but it feels all too familiar to stop.
Steve grabbed the pencil again and tapped it against the edge of the table. His nerves ratcheted up when he thought about talking to Tony. “I could try.”
“Yes, you did, or maybe it’s what you haven’t done.” She leaves that bait dangling out there and disappears.
“Shit!” Tony yells and launches the suit into the air. It’s barely functioning, the HUD display fogs out more than once. “JARVIS how much does a full grown lion weigh?”
“Do you ever,” she had said but hadn’t looked at him. Her gaze sighted the tree line. “Do you ever wonder if there’s a god?”
“A few things. He lost a lot during the war.” Steve points out an early panel. “He sold weapons as a weapons dealer. Then he found out how the weapons were being used and he nearly died in an explosion of his own weapon, giving him an artificial heart he designed and it powers the suit of armor.”
“Yeah, I kind of like it. Makes me feel cozy. But then again, I don’t like it to be cold,” Steve replies and touches Tony’s hand with the hoodie. “You’re favorite MIT one.”
The man’s brows knit together and his full lips form a grimace. He doesn’t have on a shirt, only a pair of loose pants that are slung low on his hips. “Then we start with you undressing and getting to your knees, omega. And you will not speak unless I allow it.”
“It will be, Captain, I assure you,” Tony says but when Steve turns to meet his gaze, he’s scanning the mountainside again. “Now, when do you think you might bring me on those rides to the countryside?”
“I don’t want you to be my plus one. Steve is my plus one.” That sounds cruel even to his ears. He grasps her hand and squeezes it. “It’s not that I don’t love you. You know that I do. But I really – I want that connection with him.”
While he recovers from his near fatal confrontation with the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, and as he discovers that the metal suit he fashioned in the desert is something that haunts him, he tries to ignore the echoes of Steve in his brain. He hadn’t even known the man for that long, why does it even matter? When he asks Pepper to help him with the arc reactor – replacing it – he can’t stop but talk to her about Steve.
Steve chewed at his lip before bobbing his head silently agreeing with Tony. Who knew something like that would work. In the next seconds as Steve confessed, Tony only wanted to go back on his idea of using a more civilized plan. “The girl and her brother.”
“As I will ever be.” Steve follows suit and unbuckles his belt and follows Tony toward the back of  the Quin Jet. The guards already situate themselves around Tony and Steve. It’s always a little alarming to him, but he’s slowly getting used to it.
“Yes, everything I knew. I didn’t think it was fair, after so long, to keep the truth from him.” She stands up but he stays where he is, worried that his bulk might frighten her off. “He’s plagued by nightmares, images, things he cannot place. I figured it might help for him to know that way the nightmares that might be memories – well, they would start making some sense.”
“Please I want to know.” He should want to deny it all, not listen to the tales of the demons. But the thing is – they don’t seem like demons at all. They’re just like him. They live in this cozy warm little cottage. There’s soup boiling in the hearth. He can smell it and his stomach grumbles in protest. “Please.”
Then he stepped back. Steve put his hands on his chips, looking cheeky. "Close your eyes or no surprise. And no peeking.  Also...no super high expectations. It's just something little."
"...I need to go to a few stores," Steve said. "Get me within a few miles of the hotel and I'll sort it out myself."
"...this woman, she... she pushed on an omega behind the ears and he went all dopey," said Tony, not wanting to mention it was Steve.
He was.  His hands were like ice.  Pepper rubbed his hand between hers,trying to warm him up.  "I'll get you another blanket," she said, rising. Tony was already under two comforters but he was shivering noticeably.  He'd been acting weird (well, weird
"Just remember, Steve. It's not your fault," Tiberius said, trying and failing to meet the other omega's eyes before standing up. There was a strange weight in Ty's chest; he felt an odd sense of sadness for them, but there was also nothing he could do about it. He hovered by the door a moment, his fingers curled around the edge of it. And then he slipped back out, closing the door softly behind him.
"Wanna just sleep some more?" He asked with a yawn, stretching out his legs as the sound escaped from his lips.
The soldier finished his task and let go of Steve, dropping him to the floor to pass the samples through the door; the scientist took them gratefully, along with the remains of the syringes Steve had smashed.  The Bucky from before had vanished again, replaced by the soldier.
Tony grinned helplessly.  "Yeah and I can demagnetize credit cards, too," he said helpfully.  "That's how come I don't put anything in my breast pocket. Anything too close to it gets zapped."
Tony wondered when-- if-- he'd be able to bite down on the back of Steve's neck again while they were mating.  And if it would feel different in his mouth, if it would taste different.
?! -into it. Steve kicked his jaw and knocked him out, finally lifting his gun to shoot the other remaining agent in the chest when-
"We'll get a test run done after the Expo," Steve assured him. "We'll still have a few days between that and your test. Normally they do the cardio the day before-"
"Come for me, omega," he murmured as he pounded Steve into the sheets.  "Show me what a good bitch you are... come for me, come for your Alpha..."  He nuzzled the back of Steve's neck encouragingly. He didn't feel the need to add that he was a couple of thrusts away from finishing, himself; he was sure Steve could feel it in the tightness of his muscles, the throbbing of his member.
"A nap sounds tempting," Steve hummed, thinking it would be nice to have some peace and quiet for a bit. "I wouldn't go and face them in a collar. I think they'd go a little mental-- but if I'm outside of the conference I figure I technically don't have to wear it. I suppose we can face the crowd later, maybe. We don't have to do it now."
"Not on the arc reactor, sorry," said Tony, not sounding very sorry.  "It's fine, c'mon." He clanked across the roof toward a ventilation shaft.  Sam winced, following him.
"Yeah, isn't it great?" asked Tony, beaming at it as if he wasn't currently surrounded by a hundred other plants.
Tony washed his hands for good measure before coming back out.  What Steve didn't know wouldn't hurt him; Tony wanted him to have believable deniability if SHIELD caught him snooping.  Besides, if he was going to surprise Steve with something wonderful, he had to contact Barton on the down-low.
Tony managed to choke down half of the main course and rewarded himself with another martini.  He was aching for the whole mess to be over.  Steve was on edge and it was putting
!  Well, how was I supposed to know it was top secret, I don't have clearance to look at the files yet!"
"Good morning, my star-spangled honeybear," he said to Steve, smirking at him.  Occasionally Tony liked to try to embarrass him, which wasn't hard, actually.
Tony snapped awake in an instant and for a split second felt confused, defensive, on edge.  Then he realized where he was.  A five-star hotel room.  Not a cave.  He relaxed with a sigh, dragging his fingers through his messy hair.  “Okay.  Okay, okay, I’m awake.  So help me Tesla, that better be an espresso and not an Americano, Sparky… oh.”  He blinked, eyeing Steve.  He was in a blue waistcoat Tony hadn’t seen before, one that brought out his eyes magnificently.  His mouth was watering.  “Stan.  I need you to do me a favor.  Put out your hand,” commanded Tony.
Now more people were listening. They were probably expecting some romantic and heartfelt story. Steve wasn't sure if lying was better or being honest was. So he paraphrased:
Tony stared at him, not able to formulate words yet.  His overwhelming emotion was still one of rage.  But there was embarrassment, too.  He hadn't needed an omega's help.  He was confident he could have settled the fight himself.
"...it's fine.  It's just hard. Brings back bad memories or something.  I don't know," said Tony to the ceiling, staring up into the dark, quiet room.  "I don't like it," he added, firmly. "What separates us from them, anyway? I like to think we're different but at the end of the day, the blood looks the same.  That's the thing I remember most from Afghanistan. The blood." Tony lapsed into silence, then said, gruffly, "We should've put the hand on ice."
The butler was suddenly there with them, looking thoroughly uncomfortable.  "...clothes for you, Captain?" he offered, holding up a dry cleaning bag on a hanger.  "These should fit.  I'm... sorry to interrupt..."
"Yes, those suits are marvelous," contributed Fred. Steve couldn't imagine what it was like to have a threesome with another omega your Alpha had
"I could go to their little omega corner thing. Maybe. I don't want to get them in trouble though; this is so tricky." Steve sighed and leaned his head on Tony's shoulder. "Least we know why Malick hates me so much," he mumbled bemusedly.  "You may as well go to some of the stuff. It's really important that we can do interviews about this afterwards and talk about our experiences; the same goes for you Tony," Steve said softly. "This doesn't just hurt omegas. This perpetuates a type of Alpha lifestyle which prevents them from having legitimate relationships and just feeds into anxieties."
"Let this be a warning to you, Captain," said Phil, holding the dart gun in his hand.  "SHIELD has developed tranqs for you. ...just in case."
He played with Steve's zipper temptingly, and found himself thinking, inexplicably, about how much better their second heat would be, now that they actually knew what the fuck they were doing.  Sort of. He wondered if he could get Steve to wear the collar. Definitely, if he asked Steve in heat. But he should probably ask beforehand. Steve couldn't be expected to say anything meaningful in heat, any more than he could when Tony pressed his scent glands.
Bucky had always handled snipers. It wasn't as ingrained into Steve's instincts as it should have been. And he had been out of the game for a year now.  "Thank you," he said to Joey.
Steve quickly finished his breakfast and they moved over to the couch so Gleason could inspect his neck. He didn't comment on the fact that both marks had stayed. "It's healed wonderfully. Really, I don't know how you do it... well, I know
Bucky checked his reflection in a window pane on the way out.  His skin did have an unhealthy waxiness to it, to be honest.
"I was prepared to fight for HYDRA. So I guess I didn't feel in danger...but they sent these kids. I like them. They're not HYDRA. I wasn't prepared to fight them. I should have known they'd send them but I didn't think. I think I just wanted a fight. And I didn't get one," Steve breathed. "I was in a pretty self-destructive mood, I guess. But I imagine that's pretty normal when you've sort of died once already."
It occurred to him that, between Pepper and Steve, he clearly had a thing for dominating personalities.
"Or Sam could..." Steve mused. "But his neck might make things... complicated. Rhodey it is. We should call him straight away." Steve was already doing the speeches for him. So he guessed he had a favour to cash in.
Most of the staff from the school had been arraigned; the little camp was half-volunteers and half-ex-students.  When they saw Steve arrive, the reaction was a mix. Half rushed over to him, eagerly, and half stalked away warily.  It was obvious that the younger children were more interested, perhaps because they had been less brainwashed. The older students, the ones with implanted hackles (and perhaps, grotesquely, implanted knots, and other modifications) shied away from him and clearly seemed to think he was a bad influence.  A couple seemed doubtful that he was even the "real" Captain America.
He knew they were avoiding the topic of Bucky.  But he preferred it that way.  He couldn't handle that right now.
"I thought you said it was better to have regrets than not," challenged Tony, grinning triumphantly at Steve.  "Oh, c'mon, please, Stan, I gotta go back now, I haven't even said hi to Rhodey yet... they want Iron Man, c'mon, I won't drink anymore, I promise, it's my birthday, Stan... I won't do anything stupid, come on, my IQ is over two hundred, I don't even know the
Tony felt weird, being the responsible one, lecturing Steve.  The truth was, neither of them was especially responsible. Sure, Steve worked out and ate healthy and stuff... but he also was more likely than Tony to get into brawls.  Steve was a soldier and he often reacted physically without thinking. Without Pepper or Aria, both of them were, in their own way, loose cannons.
Just as Steve reached for him the Winter Soldier lunged around and caught his arm. Steve had already grabbed at his hair with one hand; with the other, he slammed the heel of his palm up into his chin and made him reel enough so Fury could get out of his grip.
He got into the car and started her up whilst Tony settled himself in. "Kinda wish I could drunk right about now," he admitted, affected by Tony's own nervousness. "But I don't wanna know how much alcohol that would even take..."
"Make it an even dozen," said the scientist with the bag, adjusting the shoulder strap.  "Better safe than sorry."
Steve stared sideways at Tony. Then back at the 'adult' omega in front of him. He should probably go back upstairs and get dressed but the pancakes smelled really good...
"Oh please.  As if you don't have a thing for Banksy.  Everyone has a thing for Banksy. Even Pepper.  PEPPER!"
When Pepper spotted Steve she turned to kiss his cheek, too. Steve felt closer to Pepper than he did to Tony, admittedly. She was more open towards him. She was a cool and collected beta, and he admired her.  "We did okay," Steve murmured to her, and she knew that meant that Tony hadn’t drunk too much. But that he'd still drunk something. She was worried about his drinking habits, understandably so.
In the living room, Steve, Happy, Phil, and Tiberius were still chatting.  He doubted he could agree to join an organization like Status Alliance (SHIELD would throw a fit, to say nothing of Aria), but Tiberius’s suggestion of a commercial sounded simple enough.
. I promise I'm safe. But please don't come here. If you come here, you'll get in trouble...and I don't want you to get in trouble. Buck, okay?" He tried to speak to him in a soothing voice, one he sincerely hoped the other would listen to.
ever shoot us, not really.  He and Tricky were always fighting, all the time, and he made all sorts of threats.  I think he was just a little drunk and trying to scare Trickshot into behaving-- also, Tricky got so mad whenever he drank.  Tricky's father wasn't an omega, but he and his brother were, and his father used to drink and hit them and I think that's why Tricky was so messed up in the first place.  His father once hit his brother so hard he made him go deaf, that's why he knew sign language. Anyways, Tricky just laughed and said, 'Oh, really? You're gonna shoot me? You think it's worth going to jail for a spade like me?  Do it. I dare you. Shoot me.' And Alpha..."
"Come on, Donnie," said George, putting an arm around him.  "Let's get some rest... tomorrow we need to go shopping and get you some clothes..."
"Hi, Captain Rogers," she said, extending a hand to Steve.  She shut the door to her office and gestured for Steve to have a seat.  They had spoken before, part of routine evaluations, but nothing quite this personal.  As far as Steve's omega status and his relationship with Bucky, their previous conversation on the topic had taken mere seconds; she'd given her condolences regarding Bucky's death and moved on.
He groaned weakly and got up to shower and shave, leaving the breakfast offering where it was.  He threw on a pair of boxers and a t-shirt before heading downstairs; Aria and Steve were chatting, and Tony caught the last bit of their conversation.
"Jesus Christ.  Don't tell Steve or he'll go on one of his legendary Captain America guilt trips.  ...you wanna talk to him?"
"Awesome," Steve said, though he felt like he sensed worse and more awkward questions on the horizon. Why would an Alpha magazine want to interview
Natasha paused, staring out the window of the jet, and added, "Next time, call me or Clint to talk to you, Steve.  You can't keep doing this. ...seriously." Her tone was more concerned than scolding.
Steve went to get changed himself. Steve wanted to look a little smarter, ideally. He swapped out the t-shirt for a button-up, and then grabbed his phone, firing off a text as Tony stepped out of there bathroom. He smiled at the sight of dark hair plastered over Tony's forehead. "Much better."
Pepper frowned.  "Well, no, but that's not what I'm asking.  Aria needs to know where you want to--"
He kind of hated her in that moment. That was new for Donner. He didn't usually hate people. And his cheek hurt.
. Yes, Steve was cold and shaky but he almost felt...happy about it? How confusing. It didn't make sense.
"Hey." Steve reached out to Tony's free hand. "None of that," he said, voice gentle. "You're stronger than a man like Malick could ever hope to be. He's a joke. And if he's been in your situation, he never would have made it out of that cave alive."  With his other hand Steve reached up to push back the head of the onesie so he could run his fingers through Tony's hair. "I don't care what these people think of you, or me, or
Steve moaned quietly as Tony filled him up, his whole body shaking as he was filled up. Tony's spent was hot inside of him, a hot searing claim which made Steve feel so
After devouring two double burgers and getting a strangely impressed look from Christine, they moved over to play pool; Steve took his baskets of fries with him, balancing them on his arm with ease. The kids were post-grad students at UCL. One of them did history and was obviously very eager to talk to Steve.
"What?!  No! Oh, no!  You're going to get up, drink some water, put on a big, fake grin, and go support your omega!  Right now!" snapped Pepper, reaching down to tug Tony up by the back of his jacket.
"Steve can handle him. He's not in an induced heat now, remember," Natasha assured him coolly over the phone. "He might know what he's doing. But least he stopped Bucky from coming to the hotel. He really would have killed you, Tony."
He looked out the window, thinking. A week ago had been Monaco.  Was Steve telling him that he'd been around Natasha for months without cycling but had gone into heat for Tony?  Maybe he was lying again.  Then again, you couldn't fake a heat.  Tony remembered the desperate noises of want that Steve had made.  Steve may have lied about who he was and why he was there, but there was no denying that that had been real.  Even if Steve didn't like Tony on a personal level, his body clearly wanted him.
But they had all the time in the world, didn't they?  Tony was only half-watching, more focused on Steve's warmth and Steve's scent, the fingers that brushed through his hair, the thought of what tomorrow would be like, the thought of standing before a crowd and presenting his omega, announcing that, yes, he'd done it, he'd bonded, he'd really done it, Steve Rogers, America's darling, all his...
Her thoughts turned to Tony, the way he'd eyeballed Jeanette, and she sighed.  Tony was a lot of things but she'd learned
It was the perfect metaphor.  Even since he and Steve had reunited, they'd be distant; Steve had been cold.  He'd consulted Bucky as an equal, as a soldier.  He never mentioned their bond.  Bucky couldn't feel him and he didn't know why.  Steve was so close, so very close, but he couldn't close the gap, and Steve was begging him, and Bucky wanted to say something, wanted to call him Stevie or Omega or anything, anything to close the gap between them; he wanted his last words to mean something, and he was opening his mouth to apologize for being such a rotten, lousy Alpha but the words never came out because he'd already lost his grip and was falling, weightless, into the dark, cold abyss...
Steve stood back up as the medics carefully lead the omegas away. He pulled out his phone and sighed when he saw it was dead. "Goddammit," he muttered softly and turned to Tony. "Can I borrow your--"
Aria was already aboard the plane, waiting for them, when Steve and Tony came on, and she was grinning ear-to-ear.  Even Tony's partially clothed and disheveled state didn't make her grin waver.  "Well, look what the cat dragged in.
Steve had been in jeans way too long and practically sighed in relief when he stripped them off. He toed off his shoes and fell into bed, still in boxers, tee and socks. He'd missed their bed. It still smelt of them.
"We have like two hours until we have to leave," Steve said. "What are we gonna do? I'm kind of hyper.  I can't run.  I already showered."
He hung up and turned to speak to his soldier, only discover he was missing.  He looked around, confused. "--Maximoff! Where are the boys?" he demanded, shading his eyes against the sun.
Steve's breath hitched and he opened his eyes properly when there was suddenly a Tony on top of him, tugging at his jeans. Ever since Tony had pressed at the back of his neck in the omega pen, his mind had half been on this. He'd known Tony had wanted it in that moment, he could
"All Alphas in the room who don't give a shit if the omegas drink," said Tony suddenly, and threw his hand up in the air.  Rhodey and Sam both followed suit.
"No dog!" Tony almost shouted.  His head and shoulders had disappeared into the interior of the suit; he pulled it out, even more grease on his face.  "Gimme that shield. Okay, this is great, watch this!" He plucked the shield from Steve, nearly dropping it, and then ran across the room.
He rinsed himself off and stepped out, giving himself a shake.  He paused in front of the mirror.  Tony's bathroom was enormous; the marble counter had a massive mirror over it, which was currently completely fogged up.  Tony scribbled a heart and wrote inside it:
Steve sighed and leaned back into Tony's touch. He let his eyes slip shut briefly, just savouring the touch. Tony had been hidden away in the lab for far too long, he felt. He turned around in his arms and ran his hands down Tony's shoulders and arms. Steve leaned his head against Tony's forehead and sighed yet again. "I know. I know I don't need your approval, but I want it Tony, okay? Because it means something to me," he murmured.  "But please. Go sleep." Steve kissed his forehead, thumbs brushing against Tony's collarbone. "I want you at your best.  It will take me about six hours to sort through everything SHIELD's sent me," he said quietly and stepped back, his shoulders already less tense now him and Tony were finally agreeing. It was a relief. He hated to go into a fight in a bad mood. "I'll wake you up with waffles and coffee when I'm done, okay?"
Tony drove north, eyes blank.  The radio was still on but he couldn't hear it.  He was on autopilot.  He barely registered anything the entire drive, parking in the circular driveway, locking the car automatically, walking into his home with a steady stride.
"...Mr. Bennett, I think.  I think he talked to Mr. Bennett."  DeSoto dared to glance up, almost hopefully.  "...could
!" hissed Tony suddenly, his head snapping around.  There it was.  He hadn't imagined it.  "...do you smell that?"
There had been a sudden shift in the atmosphere.  Once jovial, it had turned hostile. Half of the Alphas there were grinning wolfishly at Tony's trick and the other half looked thoroughly offended on Malick's behalf.  Everyone's hackles were up and the tension in the air was palpable.
"You'd have to actually go vote," said Pepper; Tony never voted.  He shot a look over to Steve; being outed as a non-voter in front of Captain America was kind of awkward.
was stretch. Steve panted against Tony's cheek, giving his body a few minutes to adjust to it. And then he began to fuck himself in abandon on Tony's cock. Steve rose and fell at a thorough and steady pace, taking Tony's knot every time just to prove he
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and pulled him over to him; Steve curled into his chest, his body too large to really easily hold.
"...stop undressing me with your eyes, Rogers.  ...come on, put my mental clothes back on.  We're friends.  Look, let's... let's look at this logically, right?  You're an independent, modern omega and you don't want an Alpha, and I'm a modern, independent Alpha who doesn't want an omega.  We'd regret it if--"  Tony stopped, mouth watering.
"I kinda want to punch that middle guy," Steve admitted in a mumble. It probably would have annoyed him even more if he hadn't heard all of this a hundred times already. He moved his hand to push Tony's hair back from his forehead. "And, for the record..." He breathed softly. "I don't want any other Alphas either."
"Well I mention it 'cause I didn't even finish high school until last year," snapped George, a bit defensively.  He turned to Tony. "My Alpha got involved in an embezzlement scandal and was sent to some white-collar, resort-style prison.  Leaving
He and Banksy kept mixing cocktails until Steve and Sam finally came back.  Donner wanted to know if George or Banksy had kids; George had two, one about to go off to college and another who was an sophomore in high school.  Banksy had one adult step-son, Ryan, who he was only two years older than, which made Tony's skin crawl a little.
Tony's skin crawled, not just from Vixen's vapid smile, but from the memory of him calling Steve "Sparky."
Wanda waved a hand and the television turned off.  Bucky hit the power button on the remote; Pietro took the remote away, and Wanda turned the television off again.
The touch at his neck felt natural now. It didn't repulse Steve like before. Before it had just made him feel cripplingly guilty and
They pushed him into a room and just like that, Steve's impression of the frantic activity all around him was over.  He was not sure how long he'd been there.  A minute?  An hour?
With quite a bit of stumbling and getting tangled up in towels they ended up in their bedroom, falling into bed with each other, still naked. Steve curled against Tony, contently, a smile on his lips as his eyes slipped shut. He was still so terribly sore, but a little less after the bath now ,and it felt good to have Tony so close and warm (and not quite so sticky and sweaty.) The bed would no doubt get nested and ruined tomorrow, but that was tomorrow and it didn't matter right now.
As they drove away, they passed a police car going the opposite direction.  It was marked with the number 17.
"Hey," he said finally, his gaze focusing on Tony's face as he became of his surroundings once again.  "Please don't use that to stop me talking," Steve said, voice quiet and almost hurt as he looked away, gaze downcast onto the floor as a frown found its way onto his features.
"I read your files.  And his.  He's in SHIELD's archive, y'know.  He did a lot for this organization, back in the day."
Tony turned back.  "We gotta evacuate.  Now.  Right now."  He grabbed Steve.  Could Steve walk?  He wasn't going to wait to find out.  He tossed Steve over his shoulder like he weighed no more than a sack of flour.  "Rhodey, grab Pepper. Happy, move, now. Clear the Expo, it's not safe. Vanko wouldn't give up this easily- can you hear me?"
. That kind of praise made Steve feel hot all over and squirm in Tony's lap, whimpering as those fingers still inside of him teased at his sensitive insides in consequence. He was panting as he came down, his chest rising and falling a little quickly with each breath as if he was still catching up from those two minutes stretched around Tony's knot.
For years he'd passed off his reluctance to shake hands or take things from people as just another eccentricity of an over-confident billionaire, but that wasn't it.  He didn't like people touching his hands.  He and Steve held hands often and it was fine, but this was different.  They were having sex and Steve was pinning him like he was an omega, and it felt... wrong.
He didn't know what to say to make it better. It also didn't help that Steve was slipping past tipsy and into something else.
"I think I'm gonna go for a jog. It's a nice day outside. I won't be more than an hour," Steve assured him. The sun was pooling into the house enticingly through the huge walled windows. He was never usually this cooped up indoors for this amount of time. He just hoped nobody was going to harass him out in the real world. He just wanted to jog and that was really it.  "Okay?" he checked and took the other's hand, squeezing his fingers lightly before he tilted his head down to kiss his temple.
He had to get Tony to dance with him more often, even if it was only in pajamas in their living room.
Steve had, of course, packed the collar. He knew Tony would have wanted him to. He felt weird about it, still, but Tony got so turned on by it that once they were down and dirty it was no longer a problem. Steve had heard people used handcuffs in sex now; it couldn't be all that different to that. He'd packed in a small discreet black box.
"Bucky!" Steve woke with a start and cried out as his forehead slammed into something above him. Something hard. He groaned and slumped back. His vision was spinning and his head throbbing. It took him a moment to open his eyes again. He was wearing his uniform, but this time it wasn't crusted up with ice. And still no shield.
But Steve didn't really feel like looking through right now. Compared to the very real issues they were facing, the photo shoot seemed almost silly.
He felt better seeing Tony in a giant suit of armour. Steve was pretty sure he couldn't punch through this if he tried, it was really nothing like Vanko's. It looked impenetrable.
"Oh.  Okay," said Bucky, not looking away.  He had a gooey look on his face, the kind of look Tony occasionally gave to cheesecakes and bottles of scotch and circuit boards.
When Tony tugged on the collar it tightened around Steve's neck and he felt a tremor up his spine as his Alpha moved him to where he wanted him to be. The position came naturally. This was how it was supposed to be; with Steve on his hands and knees for him, ready and waiting. Then he felt Tony's warm and presence behind him and--
"I'm always okay," said Tony dismissively, kissing the top of Steve's head again.  "They call the suits
If Bucky was dead, wouldn't that be the end of the bond?  Would Steve smell normal then? Would the scar finally go away?  Or at least, would Steve's body allow Tony to "fix" it?
He moved to stand and wobbled briefly before resting on both feet, more weight on his right side. The heat helped dull the pain, at least.
they can't physically stop you. They have guards, yes, but they can't hurt you. And if they do, we'll sue. But you have to do this together, or not at all. Omegas have to support each other. You won't be nearly as vulnerable as a team. All the omegas here, they oppress each other. You've got to better than them. Or else twenty more of you will just turn up next year and the same thing will happen again and nothing will ever change or ever get better."
s the best one.  Their lead guitarist played left-handed 'cause he lost two of his fingers on the right hand.  They basically invented modern metal."
"Oh? No, not at all. We're just here to piss off Gideon Malick," Steve said. "He sent us the tickets as a joke." DeSoto couldn't help but listen and was clearly interested in what he was hearing. "He bought us a very nice suite. Must have cost him a fortune. Did you know he bought his omega because he
The two of them smiled at him politely.  Dr. Brennan, an Alpha, could no doubt smell sex on Steve even after the shower, but was too polite and professional to say anything about it.
"No," said Tony, sharper than he meant to.  "...no," he repeated, quieter. "If I take this thing off, even for a second, it'll totally undermine what we're trying to communicate.  ...it's fine. Really. It's just rubbing my hackles. It's not so bad, if I keep them down." Tony hoped he sounded convincing. He had no control over his hackles, not really.
Teeth gritted, Tony wrapped his arm around the cable, watching sparks fly, listening to the metallic grinding as his suit failed him.  He took a staggering step forward, the cable twisting over his shoulder, the electricity scrambling the suit's circuits, burning him out.
"...what is it?" asked Tony, nodding toward the bag without moving.  He felt wary but also tired. Too tired to really be angry or anything.  Not for the first time, he wished he had been in that car with his parents.  Tony had never told anyone, but he'd thought about it often. Tony loved himself for practical reasons: he was hot, smart, funny, rich, innovative... he was awesome.  But he also hated himself. Because ever since Afghanistan he'd had to come to terms with the fact that he was a mass murderer. And ever since bonding with Steve, he'd had to come to terms all over again with the fact that he was a weak Alpha.
Steve ducked away from the first swipe then on the second he simply reached out and caught the stun baton itself. The agent looked a little phased, not quite knowing how to react. "Tingles a little. Kinda like it," Steve murmured and then tugged him closer, slamming the butt of the gun into his temple. The man reeled and let go of the baton, which Steve then tossed across the floor.  Agent Thirteen and Fury had ducked behind a counter. Bullets were flying, but not in Steve's direction. Interesting.  Was that because Steve was not considered a threat?  Or because they wanted to take him alive?  Or because he wasn't the primary target at all, and it was Fury they were after, and Steve was just in the wrong place at the wrong time?
Piper suddenly looked afraid, like she'd down something wrong. "I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't be here. He'll get annoyed. I should go. I'm supposed to be getting him a drink."
Malick was clearly trying to repress his smile; he had hit them on purpose with the worst possible news and he seemed to know it.  Tony could almost hear Malick's thoughts:
Tony barely glanced down at it  "I hit a building.  It's fine, the suit took most of the impact.  I need Pepper; she's got all the contact info for my legal team-"
"We want as much information as possible from the lab itself but we have to prioritize anything on the Winter Soldier and anything on their enhancement work."
The thought of going to bed every night with his omega, curling up into Steve's warm body... it should have been cloying, but instead, it was comforting.  Tony had never felt that sleeping alone was lonely but now he wasn't sure how he'd ever done it.
"I think they have something in the works-" Steve's head fell back and his lips parted as Tony pushed inside. He shivered at the stretch, his Alpha's words rolling over him slowly as his body thrummed with arousal. It felt a little different with the condom on. But it was better than dealing with the risk of pregnancy.
"Knock 'em dead, Steve.  I love you," said Tony quietly, looking smug.  He reached up and touched the pin consciously, clearly proud of himself for doing at least one thing right today.
The back of Steve's neck didn't resemble his bonding mark, nor any bonding mark Tony had ever seen.  It was currently just a giant red swollen mess. Tony had already prepared himself for the worst and he couldn't say he blamed Steve at all for what had happened.  It almost seemed inevitable, with the way Tony was.
Rhodes shook his head, smiling.  He hadn't bonded, himself, and didn't really expect to because of his career.  But if he'd ever been asked, he would have thought that he would bond before Tony would.  Tony had always said bonding was stupid and out-dated and for weak-minded fools.  Maybe he was just quoting Obadiah, who said the same thing.  But he'd never shown the slightest bit of interest in even hanging out around omegas, and now, he seemed laser-focused on Steve.  It was cute in a very slightly unsettling way.
The armor fell to the ground; Tony dropped to his knees, clutching his hand.  The thumb was definitely broken and possibly two of the fingers. He allowed himself a few moments of heavy breathing before he got up, grabbed a pair of keys off of the pegboard, and got into the Audi to drive himself to the nearest Urgent Care clinic.
He'd leaped onto a car, then down, the shimmied up a fire escape using a dumpster as leverage.  He tore across the rooftop, trying to find the van, trying to follow Karpov.  He knew that for a while now, they had been talking about eliminating him.  But it never occurred to him that he might get Karpov eliminated, too.  Karpov was the one responsible for him.  Karpov was there when he was punished, when he was rewarded, when he gave mission reports, when he was given orders, everything.  Karpov was the one who occasionally brushed his hair from his eyes or told him his work was acceptable.  And now, because of him, they had grabbed him, shoved him into a van, and driven off with him.
Steve blushed as Tony murmured sweet nothings him. A lot of it being things Steve wouldn't dare repeat out loud. He cleared his throat.
"Hey, I won't tell," said Sam with a smile.  "Come on.  When you're ready we can go see him.  Nat took him to the cafeteria."
One of the consequences of Tony's manic drive was piles of materials strewn all over the place, including on his jet.  One corner, once used as a board room, had been rededicated as an ad-hoc workshop.  It was messy to a degree that an uneducated person might have mistaken the room as a trash heap maintained by a hoarder.  Sheets of metal, hinges, plastic tubing, wires, tools... everything was everywhere and Tony refused to let anyone touch it because he knew exactly where things were and hated when they went missing.
Tony re-read the "love, Pepper" line several times, then picked up the bracelets and turned them over in his hands.  "...huh," he said thoughtfully. Tony liked alternative medicine regardless of whether or not it worked, and he definitely liked magnets.  Not a bad gift.
"So I'm supposed to believe you brought some some homeless omega out of the goodness of your heart?  Give me a break, Tony, I was sixteen once, too," scoffed Howard.  "And I thought I told you to
"...we can go to the lodge next year," Tony reassured him.  "C'mon, let's take a nap and... well... I guess we'll start a new tradition."  Tony was disappointed too, supremely disappointed. But it didn't look like SHIELD was messing around and as much as Tony loathed rules, he also didn't want to get Steve in trouble.  Steve was in a delicate place, emotionally, what with him being in post-heat and all.
Louis laughed awkwardly. "It's quite alright. We've done this a few times now with a few different omegas. It's usually pretty... intense, when we do this stuff. We're used to it now. Most people actually make us sign confidentially stuff. A lot of people say things they don't mean to."
Tony rolled his eyes. "I was just kidding.  And no one gets left out.  If you do it right."  He squeezed Steve's hand, scanning the room.  "...you wanna go to any of the little workshops?  I could learn to, um, discipline you."  Tony gave another small roll of his eyes.  "Fuck, this whole thing is creepy... hey, maybe you ought to try to talk to the omegas here, away from their Alphas. Maybe. I don't want to get any of them in trouble. Did you see how Malick dragged Donner around?"
"A lot of people did a lot of things. It was the forties. I was new and shiny," Steve said quietly, his gaze flitting up to Tony's face. It hurt to tell him. His memories of his father were fractured enough. He didn't want to taint them even further. But Tony asked and Steve was done with lying. He exhaled slowly. "...I didn't really think anything bad of it at the time. I didn't know any better."
"You won't take it off," he repeated.  "...brat.  Fine.  C'mere, then."  He jerked his head to the couch and finally sat up, patting the seat behind him.
Steve frowned a little and stepped up to Aria. "Is Pepper mad at me? Did I do something to upset her?" He knew he two were close. If he'd done something Aria would know about it.
"Not now, Steve!  I'm on the verge of a breakthrough!  I'm telling you, I got this!" said Tony, trembling with excitement.  "...just think, just imagine, if I could summon a suit like Sailor Moon-style, have that shit clamp right onto me, get it at any time."  He paused suddenly, mood shifting abruptly. "If he ever comes back for you, I'll be able to kill him."
The very night after the funeral Steve had ended up at Banksy's house.  Tony had gone home, though he'd taken Steve by a fancy liquor store and told him to bring Banksy wine.  Although Steve wasn't a fan of Tony's drinking, bringing over Banksy's favorite bottle of red wine turned out to be the right move.  They sat up in his bed drinking it from coffee mugs late into the night, talking quietly.
Steve shot Tony a grin and walked over to the board beside him. "They're exactly what you think they are," he told him, sounding almost proud.  "So red, blue and yellow represent the three main companies that run the majority of the camps. And then green is for the odd independent one.  The biggest company, the Trinity Trust, owns and runs over thirty of them. They're in red. And also they're the company that Gideon Malick supports."
Steve looked miserable; Natasha looked... sympathetic?  Sad?  Actually, both of them had weird expressions and Tony couldn't really interpret them.  He wasn't sure why they were behaving like this, because it all made sense to Tony.  Steve felt guilt that a guy had died under his command, a guy he was close to, a guy named Bucky who fell to his death, who looked Steve in the eye right as he fell.  A guy whose photo Steve kept on his fridge, a constant reminder.  God, it was so tragic.  Tony untangled their hands and placed a hand on the back of Steve's neck to draw the omega to him, wanting to soothe him.
It wasn't easy hearing a doctor say that Tony was hurting himself, but Steve was in no place to criticism him. He was equally reckless; he'd literally been throwing himself against a mechanized military war machine a day before, in
he was interested in. He blushed a little but fortunately Pepper was polite enough to already be leaving. This was probably nothing she hadn't seen before of Tony, Steve was aware of that. But he wasn't sure if he was ready for her to see him like...this just yet. Or ever, ideally.
"This is great lead," said Brent, still writing notes on a legal pad.  "Lake Sycamore is one of Trinity's... looks like they're also going conversions under the table."
She laughed. "Easy?  You're joking," Pepper said and patted his arm before pulling away. "Night Steve."
Tony liked the head of the WORC, a female omega with a commanding presence.  Steve would love her too, he was sure.
Steve woke up suddenly in the middle of the night feeling distantly aroused. Tony was dead asleep next to him, the sedatives having done their job. He would no doubt be out for another hour or two. He rubbed a hand over his face, and then he heard it.  The voice was distant, like an echo--
Tony's amusement at the fake leather chairs evaporated the moment the doctors suggested a second trial.
The crowd in the inner lobby had noticed them and was watching with undisguised interest.  It was hard to say which they found more fascinating: Steve in a collar, or Tony in a collar.  Some looked offended; others were sniggering.
for you Tony. What more can I do to prove it to you?" Steve stared down at his milky tea in his lap. "Avengers or not-- I mean it. I protected your designs from SHIELD; I like to think
"Steve?  Have you... thought at all about the possibility that this new bond may be permanent?"  A pause, then Dr. Brennan corrected herself: "...
He gave a little kick and went to the edge of the pool, hauling himself out to get a bottle of liquor.  Steve was under again.
"...we missed Valentine's Day," Tony added, nodding toward a vase of roses next to the bed.  "I'm... I'm not great at that romance stuff... anyway..." He trailed off, then looked down at his hands.
With Steve, he felt better, a million times better.  But the wounds were still fresh and painful.  Another Alpha.  Ugh.
Tony looked thoroughly unconcerned, and the truth was, he wasn't.  Omega rights wasn't an issue on his radar.  He was more worried about Vanko.  He didn't want to add that issue onto Steve's plate, too, so he was worrying out it on his own.  The guy was probably operating alone, right?  So he probably didn't have a lot of resources... what was the worst he could do?  Tony was in America, Vanko was last seen in France.  Nonetheless, their brief phone conversation had scared the hell out of Tony.  Was he missing something?  No... no, he couldn't be, he was a genius.
getting a dog.  Dogs are gross.  If I wanted someone to slobber all over my crotch I'd go to any club in America and yell,
Fury was standing there glaring at them, car keys in one hand.  "Don't make me turn a hose on you," he warned.
Tony shrugged.  "More for me," he said, unconcerned.  Personally, he thought the idea of being force-fed alcohol sounded like a glorious existence, but based on the expression of Steve's and Wendy's faces, he decided to let it drop.  He didn't want to ruin the evening by getting into a debate about food, of all things. Tony ate pretty much whatever he wanted and didn't think very much about where it came from.
Tony didn't care.  Nothing short of a nuclear blast could have stopped him.  Steve's smell enveloped him; Tony was biting his neck and the taste was incredible; Steve was so juicy, so impossibly wet and squishy and tight and every thrust of Tony's hips made him see stars.  Steve was so wet and pliant that Tony was able to move the knot in and out and the sensation was incredible; it came out with a wet pop and the feeling of Steve's entrance tightening over it again and again was almost unbearable in its intensity.
is your typical mating position, what the kids call doggy style-- this couple looks pretty happy, don't they?-- and this actually has the
"Steve, sweetheart, I've got a liver the size of a basketball.  I'm not gonna get sick," said Tony, who was definitely drunk. He gave Steve a grin.  At some point he'd let someone pop a party hat on him; he was looking quite a bit more festive than before.  "You've got one hell of a voice, Stevie. I love it. I love
Of course he wanted him to put it on.  But seeing that heavy Victorian collar in the museum had bothered him deeply.
Tony slipped in front of Steve and caught his eye.  "Steve. I love you," he said, earnestly. "Really. I mean it.  I'm trying to be better for you. And, you know, considering you had that girl sitting on your lap and pulling your shirt open, maybe we should just call it even, huh?  ...let's start over, let's get drunk and take each other home." His voice softened. "C'mon. You're my omega, Steve."
Banksy reached over to shake their hands, then feigned shock that he couldn't because they were holding hands, and instead rose to give each of them a kiss on the cheek, prompting audience laughter.
Tony realized what she was after.  The shield was one of the few things his repulsors couldn't penetrate.  She was trying to protect herself. Why? So then she could take Steve? So Tony would be unable to defend his omega against her?
(Logically, Tony knew that he was being ridiculous, but instinct was a powerful thing, especially during this particular period, immediately following their bonding; it wasn't worth the effort and discomfort it would take to go against it.  There was no rule that Steve had to kneel and be circled before mating, but it felt great to do it and Tony was nothing if not a hedonist.)
" he asked, putting an arm around Steve's shoulders, keeping his face straight.  He loved how easily Steve blushed when he said things like that.
. Don't you get? You've lost. Maybe that won't sink in today, but some day maybe. Because we're out here changing the world whilst you're still trying to convince the world we can't. You don't get to speak in my house. You don't get to speak to my cousin. And you're gonna leave him the fuck alone. Because you're a sad, pathetic excuse of an Alpha who doesn't even know how to love properly. I don't even think you're capable of it. You're weak. The only way you can even try to get what you want is through blackmail. Which, by the way, is laughable. I would rather fucking die, for the record. And you're full of shit. And I want you to get out of my fucking home, because you have no right to be here. You have
Tony and Steve stayed up late, watching television, not speaking.  There was nothing much to say and both of them were too tired, anyway.  Their body language spoke for itself.  Steve lay with his head on Tony's lap and Tony stroked him; Tony's fingers felt nice in his hair. Steve sighed. He didn't know if it was the right time to mention that the chance of Bucky ever being woken up from cryo was like one in a million. He didn't want Tony to think he was upset by that. He was trying not to be.
They landed a solid two miles away from the base, in a clearing in the woods.  It was still dark out; there was only the faintest hint of grey-blue on the eastern horizon to indicate dawn was approaching.
"Steve, can you get Tony a cup of coffee, we need to leave in--"  Pepper checked her own watch. "--two minutes. ...you haven't gotten a tree yet?"
Tony swallowed eagerly, gulping, drinking.  Maybe if Steve weren't in heat he would have been more embarrassed but he'd forgotten everything except for his immediate desire to please his omega.
"My neck hurts," Steve said instantly. "Ankle is minimal to how it felt before." Considering he hadn't been standing and walking on it, it felt much better. The serum was doing its magic and within a week Steve was sure he'd have no pain in his foot at all.
Tony got shrugged off again and he got up just in time to see the omega's hand shove into the guy's chest and rip out his heart.
"Not really.  The bond is too strong.  Omegas' bodies will just keep rehealing with the mark of whichever Alpha they chose.  But it gets easier."
"Stevie.  Lemme see your neck," Bucky murmured gently, reaching over to tilt Steve's head.  The unfamiliar mark there still revolted him but it was fine. Steve was his; he'd fix it, as promised, and the war was nearly over and then they could go home to Brooklyn, and all would be well.
To any other person, the marks were indistinguishable; they were simply bites.  But to Tony, the difference between which was his and which wasn't was obvious, as obvious as telling apart two different people's handwriting.
on me.  I mean, before Iron Man, I'd have maybe like, three or four bodyguards, but that was because Obadiah made me. And, I mean, yeah, I've always had a PA, but..."  He trailed off and sipped his beer again, thoughtfully.  The longest stretch Tony had ever gone without a couple of aides tailing him was Afghanistan, and even then, he'd at least had Yinsen.  He had honestly never thought of himself as "spoiled" but now that he was talking about it outloud, he sounded pretty dependent on others.
"--how to tie a bowtie?" demanded Charlie, striding forward to help him.  "And why do you assume I know?"
A pause.  "I can handle it, Steve, I can handle anything.  I'll Avenge so hard, it'll make your head spin."  Tony drew back, examining Steve's hair with the sort of critical look he normally used for engines, making sure he'd gotten all the suds out.  He smiled.  Yes.  Perfect.
Tony felt like Steve was shoving him away.  Omegas couldn't distance themselves from bonds.  Only Alphas could. But Steve's emotions made it clear that he didn't want to be bothered.  There was no longing there.  Just cold anger.
"Show him the badge!" said Tony, swaying.  He jabbed a finger at Paul. "And I told you, Paul, you should respect women!"
"Support for what?" he asked, raising a brow. "Like... for Alphas who have to deal with... this?" It made sense. Steve knew that Tony was trying to put on a brave face. "That sounds like a good idea," Steve hummed and moved to brush his fingers against Tony's hand in a silent apology that'd rejected the touch to his neck.
He gave Steve a quick kiss and then jogged down the steps to the garage, closing the door behind him.
"Excellent.  ...is that going to be enough?" he asked, nodding into the cell, where the soldier still had Steve pinned and was drawing his ninth tube of blood.
The man it had been talking to did not respond to it providing its name, or what it thought its name might be.  The man was an omega but the asset had no real interest in him.  The asset was used to enemies trying to use women or omegas to win it over, but that didn't work.  It had no use for sex. It had once heard Karpov brag, proudly, about removing such a primal instinct.  "It does not desire, it does not fear. It only obeys. Find me a better soldier than that!" he'd said. And then his hand had lightly touched the small of the soldier's back and it had known that Karpov was proud of it.
Steve almost smiled; he had forgotten how cheesy his Captain suit was to someone who had never seen it before. "So... er, guessing you don't have any clothes either? Grab that sheet and we'll get you out of there. I just got to open the other doors."
"Steve, I'd like to apologize again about my very abrupt departure yesterday.  That was unfair. I'd like to pick up where we left off. ...yesterday, you seemed to mostly be concerned with others, but I'd like to talk about
Coulson led them down a corridor of doors, all of them unmarked and locked with what appeared to be a retina scanner.  Tony was disappointed he didn't get to see a scanner in action; the door to the boardroom that Coulson led them into was not protected.
His attention slid back over to the range, where Tony was walking the sergeant through some of the features of the gun he was holding.
"Got it," Steve hummed, still determined to function.  They'd been gone about twelve hours, that was all, but it felt like longer. He was relieved as soon as they stepped inside the house. Steve instantly felt safer. "Don't be too long," he told him and kissed Tony's (well, the suit's) forehead before he pulled away into the kitchen, where he could hear Gleason and Pepper talking.
It was a picture of them at dinner, probably taken less than half an hour ago. The angle it was taken at clearly showed that, though they had a bottle of wine and Tony's glass was filled, Steve's was untouched.
"Lead the way," Steve whispered and squeezed his hand lightly.  Tony threw on boxers and a wifebeater before they headed downstairs to find Pepper and the doctor chatting in the breakfast nook on stools, as if they started every day like this. Pepper had coffee and half eaten waffles in front of her. The doctor had just a coffee and he honestly looked a little awkward, a suitcase by his feet.
"It didn't matter how strong I am. He was always going to one-up me in that thing.  At least now I know not to fight a weaponized robot suit in my jeans," he joked gently and then exhaled.  "I'm just...I'm glad you're okay," Steve murmured. "I was so scared."
Although being bonded meant they were sensitive to each other's bad moods... it also meant that they were sensitive to other emotions, like arousal.  They were feeding into each other's sense of excitement and anticipation and the build-up was amazing. Tony had never had this with another partner; with Steve, Tony was capable of getting right to the brink of orgasm without ever even touching himself or being touched.  No one had ever mentioned to him that being bonded meant amazing sex. If they had, he might have considered it sooner.
Around noon, Steve woke briefly; Tony had turned off the television. Steve didn't even really open his eyes. He was vaguely aware of covers being pulled up around them and resting his head against Tony's chest, his position being carefully maneuvered so the ridges of the arc reactor didn't press into his cheek. Steve mumbled something along the lines of Tony's name but nothing truly coherent came out. It was like his body had been completely drained and was now on a massive recharge.
"I'll use the master. We'll see how it goes," Steve murmured, running a hand over his face as he dragged himself back to the present. He didn't want to be distant from Tony. He was unsure about sharing a bed, definitely iffy on sex, but he didn't know how he would feel about distancing himself from Tony even further. He'd felt so lonely the past few months and he was sure the other had too.
Now, they couldn't stop staring.  It was like Steve had been invisible before, as an omega; now that he had identified himself as Captain America, it was like there was a spotlight trained on him.
The legal team paraded back into the house to tackle the paperwork.  Tony went back to his cake, finishing it off before dumping the using plate on the pool deck and wandering inside to find Steve and let him know the situation was being taken care of.  Steve had been accosted by Aria earlier in the morning and was currently up to his neck in media dealings.
"I don't know how the soldier works," said Mackenzie with a smile, "but heats typically average, what, three, five days?  No more than six or seven. So yeah, I'm guessing he's probably over the worst of it."
He moved to tug his tie off. "Thanks," Steve said to Brooke, his shoulders visibly relaxing as they walked into the cool night air.  His eyes popped at the sight of the skyline before them. "It was getting hard to breathe in there."
, Rogers?  Are you serious?  ...what'd you write?"  He strained to see what was on the pad of paper in Steve's lap.
Pepper switched tactics.  "Tony.  You can't just bail on your omega.  That's not how a good Alpha operates."
"You know, every year, people write in Captain America in elections," said Aria without a trace of humor.  "In fact, I think you were elected mayor to a couple of towns in the seventies, Steve."
A female Alpha stepped forward and shook Steve's hand warmly before turning to offer her hand to Tony's. "It's a pleasure to meet you."
, squirming a little at the touch as his breath hitched. He moaned quietly and it was a longing, almost sweet sound.
"Oh, I'm sure you'll find a way to keep yourself entertained," said Fury, rising.  "Mackenzie, with me. Brazinski, Sitwell, you stay here. Wilson, Coulson... up to you if you want to stay, too."
Steve looked down at Tony dazedly, eventually figuring out that the wetness on his leg was Tony's own release. He was admittedly a little surprised by that.  But then, when he gave Tony head, he usually got off on it, too.
Steve moved to stand shakily, not letting Bucky help him with his bad ankle. He did not want pity. He did not want charity.
, Steve." A pause, then he added, somewhat deviously, "And I've been brushing up on my Russian so that you and Dark Angel can't talk behind my back anymore.  возьми это, омега! ...but don't tell Natasha, I want to call her out on it next time she says something mean about me in Russian. I wanna see the look on her face!"
There was a large crack down it.  Tony didn't remember hearing it crack but they were definitely going to have to foot the bill for that.
The first therapy session was not good. The man was old, hitting his sixties, and talked to Steve like he was a child who didn't understand what end a gun fired out of. It was clearly about Steve's status, but he didn't say it. Steve remained polite through out the entire thing and took a number to set up a second appointment he had no real intention of making.
"You guys might need me.  I can shoot lasers out of my hands.  That's come in handy at least once," said Tony, rubbing the heel of his hand into his eye.  "You already know I don't read anything longer than two pages, though. So can you just give me the quick version of whatever the all the intelligence reports said?  Where are we going? How many people am I going to have to hand-laser, potentially?"
"Induced heats are a lot rougher than natural ones," said Dr. Gleason, gently wiping the dried blood from Steve's skin.  He frowned a little. "It probably didn't help that you crammed five days' worth of hormones into the space of a few hours.  How are you feeling? Aside from exhausted."
Tony brought himself to cruising altitude; within minutes he was at 12,000 feet, his ears had popped four times, and he was making his way east.  He was on autopilot and was relaxing in the suit, letting it do the work for him, skimming over the cloud tops and occasionally getting odd looks from the triangle of cranes that was flying above him.  He wasn't sure where they were going.  He wasn't, for that matter, sure where he was going.  Just that he was going east.
It was another thirty seconds before Steve's lungs were beginning to tug in chest in protest. He licked at the swell of Tony's knot one last time before pulling off with a gasp, eyes left watering a little.
Tony shook his head.  "You take the bed, Steve.  You heard the doc, you need your beauty sleep."  He stifled a yawn, then said, glibly, "if we're both so terrible then I guess we're a good match, huh?"  He gave Steve a hesitant smile.
It was 1944 all over again, he and Bucky screaming at each other in France while the rest of the Howlies took smoke breaks; after Azzano, Bucky had come back different, moody, and their bond had been broken, and they'd called each other "Barnes" and "Rogers" as if they'd never been bonded at all.
Tony pushed his up sunglasses a little, trying not to look embarrassed.  Part of him wanted to correct Happy. Bonding was more than just being in love; it was about having a connection.  But Happy couldn't get that; he was a beta.
Most of the missions were solo runs but a few times Steve got to meet other agents. May was his favourite. She was stoic and bossy but incredibly brave. The beta had taught him a thing or two about how to kick right and she never treated him like anything special, just a normal person. It turned out she had some pretty good stories about Phil when he was younger too, but when Steve asked if they were friends she didn't seem to want to answer the question. Most of the time Fury was just asking for a memory card or a disc. Once he literally just asked Steve to sneak up a hotel building and record a conversation; it had all been about project INSIGHT. And wasn't that a SHIELD initiative? Shouldn't Fury already know all about that, as the head of SHIELD?  Steve didn't question what Nick asked for but that didn't mean he found it any less confusing.  Maybe it was just good old-fashioned paranoia on Fury's part; he didn't seem to trust anyone fully, not even within his own agency.
a virgin before you," Steve insisted in a whisper, words muffled against the floor. "He never touched me, he
The soldier took it, baffled, and sat up on the edge of his cot.  Was he supposed to deliver this package to someone? He waited for orders.
Tony clung to Steve throughout the ride home.  Despite his size, Steve curled up like a typical omega, letting Tony shelter him.  Tony couldn't stop stroking his skin, nuzzling his hair, kissing his face and neck,  He stayed away from the back of Steve's neck, focusing on his throat instead, not sure what the protocol was for that area anymore.
When Steve had thought of simple he had thought of a strip of leather, not anything gem stones in it, let alone opals and sapphires... God, Steve was so out of his depth.
"You know, you're still drunk," Steve replied, squeezing Tony's shoulder. He wasn't slurring, at least. With enough persuasion he would admittedly give in. It was the new year. They were on a technically sort of public beach… it was exciting, Steve had to admit that. And it felt good to be sharing this with Tony. Really good.
seen Fury mad?  Not like this.  We both came back with frostbite, half-starved, and Clint's bite infected... I thought they were going to put us both out in front of a firing squad.  Ever heard an omega growl?  Barton and Fury were about ready to rip each other's heads off when he dragged me back home."  She put a hand over her mouth to hide her smile; after composing herself, she looked at Steve.  "You're welcome, by the way.  Barton and I pretty much guaranteed bonding is a protected institution.  At least within SHIELD, anyway.  After they pardoned us, your and Stark's bond was pretty much a cake walk."
.  My favourite food is pizza- that deep dish thing you do now is awful, though. Back in the forties it was a real treat. Anything that tasted of anything was a treat, honestly. I like it thin and crispy and with bacon and mushroom on it.  My favourite drink when there was a point in me drinking was actually red wine. Used to get me silly drunk- I was such a light weight..." Steve smiled ruefully. "Other fun facts... uh... I love working out to cheesy pop music and dancing to when no one's watching and singing along too. I actually love dancing, but it doesn't really go with the whole serious Captain America vibe.  Clint had to teach me how to use a credit card.  Twenty-first century sex toys are a total miracle. Seriously. Though don't ever quote me on that. New underwear is so much better too, way more comfortable. Sorry, I'm getting off track..."
He was most vulnerable during heat.  That much was obvious. Wanda and Pietro were lying on the beach, wearing sunglasses they'd stolen from a sidewalk vendor, their heads touching.  In moments like these, out of his heats, he liked to pretend he was beta like his sister.
Tony shrugged and closed his eyes again, reaching a hand out for Steve.  He felt tired, tired beyond all reason. But it was a good, satisfied kind of tired.  They'd done what they needed to do and now they could go home.
"...coke doesn't affect memory, Steve," said Tony patiently.  He looked down at the tracker on his ankle. "I can't wait to get this thing off.  I feel like I'm an endangered panda or something. ...you know pandas are endangered now, right?  Like, super-endangered. Anyways, yeah, Sweden is okay. I was thinking England. You could see some of your old pals that are still..."  Tony trailed off. Steve didn't have many of his old war friends left.
"Everyone's more dominant than Mr. Stark," said Donner.  There was a hint of challenge in his voice.
"I wish I hadn't gone to Yemen," Steve whispered. That was, after all, the chain of events that had sort of started all this. Or maybe it was the simulation, which had called out to Bucky in the first place.
Maybe he could tell him without telling him, somehow.  It was certainly enticing, and Bucky was already so close to Steve, caressing him, nosing his neck, just behind his ears, where the scent glands were...
"You wanna bring it?" Natasha asked when she noticed Tony peering at the thing in question. He didn't answer right away so Steve took that as a yes and went to grab it, being careful as he set it down in the elevator along with everything else.
Steve moved on instinct and this time he didn't hate himself for it. He savoured the delicious tremble down his spine as he moved to kneel on the floor before Tony, hands grasped behind his soldier straight back in a perfect posture as he bowed his head down in the ultimate submissive gesture. It was as simple as breathing.
"You could slow down.  There's no timeline on this.  You'll figure it out eventually; the answers are in your head.  You won't find 'em if you keep getting knocked around by big pieces of metal."
"Who, Sammy?  No, she's just drunk. She did this last year, too.  Stark parties are always open bar," said Tony, who seemed unconcerned with the number of unmoving bodies strewn around on the broken, dirty couches.
It was an omega thing. People often tried to protect your feelings. Steve and Clint had ranted about it in more than one sparring sensation before.
Some weird motherly instinct kicked in and he wanted to crawl over Nate and protect him from the world. In a grim sense, it occurred to Steve that they'd done the operation 'well.' He didn't smell awful like Tiberius did. He wasn't repulsive but there was a sense of... loss, emptiness. And it tugged at Steve's chest.
."  (The arvicolina; the prostate; the foreskin.)  (Tony lacked a bonding gland, had no idea where his own prostate was, and was circumcised.)
Despite Tony's reassurances, Steve could tell he was feeling anxious.  And he knew why, too.  The six civilian deaths that had occurred at the Expo weighed on him.  Tony was constantly bragging about all the good Iron Man did, about the people he'd saved and the threats he'd neutralized.  But that wasn't what Tony dreamed about.  Steve knew he was haunted by the ones that fell through the cracks, the inevitable casualties.  Never mind that they'd managed to minimize damage and save thousands.  No.  Leo Rothstein cast a long shadow, and Tony's cheerful insistence that they would "get off scot-free" was clearly a defense mechanism.
"Look someone can hurt you and still mean a lot to you. Someone can hurt you and still try and their best," pointed out Steve.
?”  Rhodey shook his head in disgust, then repeated, “I think Steve’s friend, that Wilson guy, just hit on me.”  Rhodey was usually unflappable but right now he almost looked… unsure of himself. "What do I do?"
When Tony's fingers began exploring Steve shivered. He didn't pull away from the touch, not afraid of it feeling again with just Tony here in their own hotel room. The concept as a whole still worried him out though. Did Natasha use it on her opponents? Was the kind of thing a SHIELD agent learned?
“You haven’t slept in 24 hours Tony. I think you need to sleep on this beforehand.” This all seems too fast to Steve. Way too fast.
“There won’t be anymore data. I’m going to take the glasses and the implant and revert it back to the last version. It’s the only way to get through the gala.” Tony throws himself back onto the bed. “I’m going to spend the new few days being poked and prodded by Strange. Pepper’s going to mother hen me to death, and I don’t even want to think about what Rhodey is going to do to me.”
Rumlow gives him a shifting look and then questions, “You part of the crew? We need entrance. Station Secretary Pierce wants to sweep the place for any incendiaries.”
“This is new.” Tony stands there with the towel in his hands, nervous like it’s his first date ever. He rubs the towel in his hands, trying to stop the sweating. “Fuck.” It’s not like Steve asked him to fuck. It’s a simple drawing, but what if it’s the Titanic type with nakedness and sensuality. He’s truly fucked.
“He’s your creation, Tony. He knows,” Steve says and part of him crumples. Not outside, Steve never permits anyone to see how crippling the battle can be. As Captain America, it’s his job to maintain a certain stoic and positive outlook. The thing is – it’s a façade that’s getting harder and harder to preserve, especially in Tony’s presence.
“Bucky, stop,” Natasha says and yanks on him. He spins around, releasing Steve to confront Natasha. She reaches out to him and he snaps at first but then she seizes his arm as if to flip him over her shoulder.
He cringes. He needs a distraction. He’s up and pacing back and forth in the room, tearing a little at his hair. His phone buzzes in his pocket and he yanks it out, set to throw it across the room. He stops mid-toss when he realizes it’s Barnes. He presses the connect.
Tony uses the hanky, only cleaning off the tears and drying his eyes. He can feel the tatting on the sides of the hanky, the delicate stitching on the fabric. “Your mother made this.”
Tony suppressed a smile.  He couldn’t deny that the idea that Steve might be proud of him made him feel good, and maybe a little smug. A slight rebuke popped through the bond and Tony glanced over to Steve who only arched a brow at him.
As Steve poured the egg mixture into the sizzling frying pan, he glanced at Thor. “So, you feel differently about that. How about other things? Like being here and not at home?” Maybe it was a bit selfish to be asking Thor such a leading question, but Steve needed to know how he dealt with being so out of place much of the time.
Steve leans down and scopes up some snow. He gently tugs Tony’s hand away from his face and then places the snow into his palm, guiding it back to his face. “It doesn’t matter if it’s just here. It still hurts like hell.”
“Ultron could want to do that.” The pitiful light from the lantern flickers and casts Tony is bluish relief against the windscreen of the cockpit. “If he’s delaying us, then there’s a reason for that delay. He mustn’t have all the defenses he needs.”
Steve stands stock still next to Tony for a full minute before he shifts slightly away from Tony, putting his balance on his foot farthest away from him. “I’m sorry? I’m not sure what you mean?”
“I have some. I’ve been self-experimenting before you think otherwise.” He digs in the drawer of his bureau. “Natasha told me I should start to explore my interests.”
Tony slides it out of the broken pocket and opens the printed ad. From the quality of the print, Tony figures an older printer – dot matrix - and a crappy ink cartridge. “It says mathematically inclined and Stats a plus.” He shoves the paper over to Steve.
“Freshen up the wound,” Ross said. The remaining two V-Corps agents went to Steve. One of them pulled out a knife and before Tony could act (even if it was useless), sliced open Steve’s chest. Blood streamed down his body and Steve jerked. His head came up and his eyes flashed open. He raged, thrashing against the chains. “Hurt him.”
“Oh no.” Pierce ambled in and then directed several of the V-Corp agents out of the cell. They scrambled to follow their superior’s direction. “I already saw how you liked to watch the different vampires fuck him. That’s more than enough perversion for me. I just wanted to check on our experiment. That’s what’s important.”
“Bucky?” he asks, they already have one of May’s quilts on the cot up in the little room above the jailhouse.
“We gotta find a way out of this. We’ve been stuck trying to make sense of this for ages, it feels like.” Tony leaned into him, placed his head on Steve’s shoulder.
“It’s okay, it’s okay,” Bucky says and wishes to hell and back that Steve understood the words, that he recognized that his friend was speaking to him. How far and how deep under the torture could Steve be? He’s a Jedi – or at least an apprentice learning to be a Jedi.
“But I think he probably did that before your accident,” Steve said. He leaned over Tony’s shoulder. “You have this bit of code backwards. I can transfer it to you.”
“Stop it, just stop it. You know my name is Tony,” he replies and wants the whole damned world to just fucking make sense. “You know my name is Tony and I know who you are, I really do. Don’t fuck with me.”
He shivers and then he feels a thick jacket over his shoulders only to see Steven slipping his own coat over Tony. Since the day Tony punished Steven, things changed. Tony still felt the sting of shame for having punished Steven so severely due to a minor transgression. There were levels of punishment and Tony knew he went too far. He’d wanted to apologize but that night – well, Steven ended up on the rack again, whimpering for relief. Tony gave it to him, allowed him to come and when he spilled over Tony’s hand he collapsed in his bindings with his eyes closed and his body limp.
“You know when I was a kid we had a waffle maker in the shape of a Captain America shield. It was pretty neat.” Tony smiles as he leans his cheek against his hand, watching Steve. “Hmm, I don’t think you’re going to be able to spar. Where did you put all of that?” Tony asks. Steve’s figure is the epitome of human perfection.
Once they finally get to the lounge, Steve relaxes, though Happy does not. He steps into the lounge first as if some Kree super agent is about to leap out at them to attack Steve. When they walk into the room, melodious piano music fills the room. Steve stops and gapes at Tony sitting at the piano, a tumbler of amber liquid on the piano as he plays.
“What? You’re getting yourself comfortable?” Tony said as he curled his arms around his chest trying to stay warm. He still hadn’t moved from the center of the cabin. “I am not going to stand this.”
“Drink anyhow. It might give you the illusion,” Tony says. “Drink, sleep, do whatever. But don’t assume.”
That was something omegas never spoke of – it was their truth. Steve hadn’t spoken of it then, not at all. Tony didn’t need to know. He didn’t need to realize that Steve’s gland reacted and bonded – or ached to bond with Tony. It selected for Steve. Maybe it was their chemistry, maybe it was something more profound, but they were bound to one another like soul mates together.
Steve hits the kick stand and balances the bike as he presses it into drive. Inertia almost whips Tony off the bike as they lurch forward and speed out of the garage. He grabs onto Steve and leans into him.
He rolled his shoulders and asked, “The tracker in my suit… How long has it been there, and do they know about the safe houses?” Steve was certain he’d never worn the suit to the safe houses.  There had been no need for rural Pennsylvania or New York or Quebec to know that Captain America was hanging about the place.
“Great, let’s go. The access road goes right down to the service docks on the other side of the island.”
Luke laughs and shakes Tony’s shoulder -which startles him and the guards, but their tense reaction means nothing to the big man at all. “You are going to be a great customer. I have a backroom you might be interested in.”
Fury must have gestured or waved or telepathically done something, because the doors swept open wide and Doctor Strange waltzed in. He really was the last guy that Steve wanted to guide him on this hilariously ridiculousness of soul packs and bonding. He threw a look of disgust at Fury over his shoulder.
“We’ll figure it out,” Steve whispered as Tony nestled against Steve’s chest and listened to his heart, the steady thrumming a lullaby to him.
Blu glances over his shoulder, mutters a growl as if he’s irritated with Tony’s reaction, and then continues to walk away.
With a shrug Steve answered, “From what I understand recovery from that kind of trauma isn’t overnight. So, it will take a while. It’s a process.”
“You don’t, you don’t have to,” Steven says and he looks up at Tony. There are unshed tears in his eyes.
The V-Corps called it culling, and Steve knew it to be much more serious that Natasha let on, but he held his tongue.
“Not as a soldier, as some kind of special government envoy,” Steve says. “Just another name for -.”
His armor – that he left in the corner of the hospital entrance as nurses and doctors helped to take Steve away. He needed his armor.His armor had been his cocoon. Pepper had accused him of using it as a distraction to the wider problems he refused to face.  If there was any time in his whole damned life that he longed for the cocoon of the armor, the shelter and solitude of it, then now was it. But the fact that they could invade his privacy even in the armor did not escape him.
Midgard? That term rings a bell and then it hits Steve – this is an Asgardian, but not just any Asgardian – this is King Odin of Asgard. Steve’s talked to Thor enough, shared many memories and vids with him enough to recognize his father.
There’s a large sigh. “Tony?” He opens the door. He is in only his undershorts and looks aggrieved. “Where have you been? I’ve been-.” He stops and puts his hand to his mouth as if he should not share.
A murderer. Maybe Kennedy’s real assassin. Maybe a serial killer of young girls. A pedophile. Tony might want these things so some of the guilt and pain would be lifted from his shoulders, but the bleakness in Pepper’s expression told him more than he wanted to know – revealed the truths that he would have to wrestle with for the rest of his life.
Steve sneaks a peek and sees Stane standing next to a workbench that’s been cleared of it’s contents. Tony goes over to it and starts to pick up all the tools and instruments. It riles Steve that the prince (the prince!) kneels in front of Stane and cleans up
“I’m surprised you don’t know it, Rogers,” Natasha says and she’s sitting on the other side. Her smile has lines it in, like someone’s crossed it out. “It’s a fairy tale. There’s one Prime Alpha and one Omega – sometimes they call the Omega a prime too. Don’t know what that is. But they are destined for one another. Through the ages.”
Under Steve’s hands, Tony no longer needs the armor to fly. He takes flight and his mind scatters as Steve massages him, strokes him, sucks him. He fingers Tony in the lightest way – a tease once again and Tony shudders in anticipation. He drags his tongue along Tony’s erection and there’s nothing for it now. A bit of pre-come splashes out. He inhales in gasps Steve’s laps it up. His tongue is so talented that Tony longs for it.
“No, sit, I can do this.” He goes back to the bags and searches for the matches. He finds them easily and thankfully they are dry. He stacks the wood and kindling in the fireplace as Tony stares dully at the stones.
“I might not exactly understand that reference, but I understand that reference,” Steve said and chuckled as Tony screwed up at his face.
“A damned pervert,” Tony said. The moments after rescuing Steve today came back to mind. After everything that happened – the call blasting through his nerves like a spike to the heart, the crash, the rescue, the girl and her brother, everything. The beauty of Steve using the soul projection to try and locate Bucky. Tony longed to ask him how he did it, what it meant, could they all do something like that, but then his brain circled back to the same thing time and time again. After all of it, Tony could only focus on the fact that Steve thought of him as a pervert. It wouldn’t be the first time someone threw that insult his way, but it would be the only time that someone who named him Beloved happened to say it.
“Don’t do this,” Natasha had said. She stared at him, her vampire eyes deeper in color, crystalline and faceted unlike a natural human. Like Tony’s he could never really pin down the color of her eyes. Were they emerald green, sapphire blue, or deep violet?
. Steve had been angry, pissed to the gills that during a worldwide crisis where an artificial intelligence of Tony’s design was literally holding the world hostage throwing the financial markets into turmoil, jets dropping out of the sky, not to mention the satellites wreaking havoc all over world he wanted to watch a movie.
“No, I want a blue raspberry,” Steve says, just to be contrary. He’s actually not fond of the blue raspberry flavor.
Tony flinches and Steve backs off. He hates the idea of intimidating anyone (well, not honest to goodness villains); he’s not a bully. He drops Tony’s wrist and exhales heavily and audibly. “Please tell me why the outer rim looks just like Barton’s farm.”
“You are not, sir,” JARVIS says. “Unless it happens to be a juvenile dragon, sir. I would imagine a dragon would be much larger in size.”
“It’s not like what you’ve seen in the movies. You can’t change your past,” Bruce says. “When Tony in the future invented some way to ‘erase’ what happened, what he did was create another reality, not erase the past.”
“Oh no you don’t.” Tony caresses Steve’s side and then presses his hips against his leg. He can feel Tony’s hard cock through the fabric of his pantleg. “Do you want another finger, Steve? Do you want a fourth one?”
Steve gathers up his supplies and climbs the stairs. He must like the view from his balcony. Tony sits at the island, staring at the cold fries. No one likes cold fries and it’s really not possible to warm them up and get the same satisfaction. He peers over his shoulder at the stairs and then back at the fries. Sighing, he collects the dishes, scraping the plates and tossing the trash. He puts the dishes in the sink and debates on putting them in the dishwasher. Steve doesn’t use the dishwasher so it means they will stay there not cleaned. He should just wash them.
“Nope, this calls for the big guns. I know big guns, way more than you do. I need to talk to Reed before I talk to Steve. Get all the background done, you know, my due diligence. All that good stuff.” Grilling Bruce further would yield little results – that much is clear to Tony. He itches to get Richards on the phone and starts to turn away from Bruce to call on JARVIS to do just that, but his AI interrupts him.
“It means that the interface might get leaky. And then for sure the bastard will be able to infiltrate our minds, not to read them, but to damage them.” Tony states the last part slowly and with purpose, eying Steve as if he wants to make sure that another phase out of the virtual world isn’t imminent.
“I don’t know. I’m not his doctor,” Cho said and hurried to stand beside Steve. A nurse came into the room, her demeanor fierce but not unnervingly so.
Tony resigns himself to the fact he’s going to have to eat to get Steve to join him in the lab, so he sidles onto a stool and says, “The works. I’d like Italian dressing, skip the onions, and add pickles.”
“Oh,” he murmurs. “Not shield, but SHIELD.” He screws up his face as he mulls it over. “What does that even mean? An acronym, SHIELD?”  The last word hits him like an electric shock. Division.
The small town on the edge of a plateau near the river’s bed is a lure to anyone trying to disappear from their former life. Steve should know, he’s one of the many hiding out in Avenge trying to forget the last years of the war and the intervening hell he went through because of it. He rotates his shoulders again, trying to forget what he and Bucky went through, but it’s always a shadow.
Drying off, Steve tugs the shirt on, not welcoming the scrutiny Tony’s gives his damaged back anymore. To keep the questions, the always inevitable questions from coming, Steve cuts him off at the pass. “Yes, the scars are from the prison, and yes I was whipped, on several occasions. Believe it or not, most of the damage wasn’t by the guards but by the Raiders. First, because they wanted me to join their gang of bullies and I refused. Then again, when they decided they didn’t fancy me joining up with the Regulators to stop their insidious terrorization of the prison camp.”
“I don’t know how she got to be in charge, but it’s a bunch of crap. I’m not going to be told I can’t be loyal and faithful and in
“Steve: I left your bag with the glasses and computer with all of the data with Pepper and Rhodes. If it wouldn’t be too much trouble, could you please have my stuff sent to my address in Brooklyn?”
Steve blinks a few times, Tony doesn’t react. Strange continues with the exam. “How are the headaches?”
Tony frowns. Dealing with the dead and their ghosts is one thing, handling the ancient living devils is quite a different story.
“Still Tony, this is so thoughtful!” Steve grabbed Tony in his arms and hugs him, but then remembered himself and quickly stepped away. “I’m so- Thank you. Really, thank you.”
He stood up and shuffled to the bathroom. Turning on the faucets he bent over the sink and threw the cool water on his face, ran it through his air, and then gripped the counter. His eyes landed on the scarring along his arm. He never really looked at it anymore. Not the band that marked him first as leader, and not the many brands that scarred his whole arm, with Tony’s traveling up to his chest. He shrugged off the suit jacket and the shirt and tie. He tossed his undershirt to the floor and stared at the markings – soul scars – over his arm and on his torso and chest. He hadn’t admitted it to himself or to anyone, but the one on his chest – Tony’s mark – grew and flourished every time he had one of those potent dreams. Across his whole chest and down his torso the markings stretched. Complex geometric figures and patterns. He wondered if Tony had the same markings and if so how far they went.
“Silence,” Steve ordered and listened as both Thor and Hulk finished the work of the team. “Natasha up and at ‘em. Lullaby time.”
“I couldn’t exist without you, not with the whole of humanity around me. I couldn’t pick death because it felt like a cop-out. Like I was trying to escape my fate. Now,” Steve whispers and closes his eyes as he leans against Tony. “Now all I can do to stand being apart from you – all I can do -.” He can’t finish his sentence because there’s no end to it, there’s no way to escape his need to be this close to Tony. Touching always.
“Something like that,” Clint said. “Nat called me at home. Got here as soon as I could. Not soon enough.”
Before Steve can answer, Pepper pipes in and brings Rhodes over to a corner for a private conversation. Steve glances at Happy and mutters, “Why do I feel like I’m getting sacked?” He wants to plead that Tony’s seizure isn’t his fault, but he doesn’t think his arguments will be taken into account. As Tony’s assistant maybe he is responsible, maybe it was up to him to stop Tony from the upgrade.
As he went to sit at the laboratory bench, his hands tremored and he cradled his head in his folded arms. He had everything. He was a wealthy man with the world at his disposal. He’d figured this all out with that kid Harley and he blew up his suits and got rid of the arc reactor. Why did Natasha have to come and render him bare? Why did his core, his heart, his chest, everything – why did it ache?
“Enough substance for us to figure out what the whole rim is about,” Steve says and then cringes. “Ultron really does like playing with his food.”
Tony grasps Steve’s wrist. “They’re lovely. Beautiful, really. Is this.” He picks up the drawing from today. The way the light catches the lines in his face doesn’t make him look old but happy and wise at the same time. “Is this how you really see me?”
“What the?” He started to rise but one of the attending medical staff placed a firm but gentle hand on his shoulder.
“Anything?” Blu purrs and rubs up against him as if he’s a house cat marking his human, only this time Tony falls flat on his ass.  He’d almost forgotten about his injuries. “Whoa there, big guy. Careful with the merchandise.” He pets Blu along the ridge of his ear and get a long low clucking noise in response. “I suppose you like that.”
He scoffs but Pep literally stamps her high heeled foot. “Okay, okay.” He turns to the wall that holds the interface. The black screen gives no indication it is on. “Purpose to fall deeply and devotedly in love with a warrior omega, get bonded, and then rule the universe.”
It slams into Tony’s chest, reverberates and saturates his senses. The air from his lungs escapes in tiny pants, and his heart races too fast against his ribs. He can smell Blu’s breath, feel the spittle of the lion on his face. Tony collapses to the ground and Blu finally stops.
Steve readies himself and picks up the largest of the blades. It glints in the light and he considers it. He doesn’t have a shirt on so it should be easy to slice through the skin near his collarbone. Bringing the knife to his throat, he watches himself in the mirror. He doesn’t look at his eyes; he might stop if he does. He takes it on like a military mission, something that has to be done. Holding his breath for a moment, he places the knife near his shoulder and then releases his breath. As he does he pushes in. A small bubble of blood oozes out and he goes deeper, hissing as the pain spears through the nerve. He knows how this feels. It was done to him time and again as a form of torture. He can do this.
Steve clenches his teeth and with one last colossal heave makes the rise of the hill. The stones and mud slosh beneath them, but they succeeded. Steve turns his attention to the landscape beyond the entrance and gasps.
By the time they arrive in Greenwich village and get out of the car in front of 177A Bleecker Street, it is nearly 11. Tony’s appointment is at 11, so Steve waves goodbye to Happy and navigates Tony into the large building that looks a little like a wizard’s hideout. During the past week, Tony fitted Steve with an earbud that looks similar to something someone talking on the phone would have. It makes it easier for Steve to speak to Tony and give him directions without directly guiding him. It also makes it look like Steve is perpetually on the phone.
“I feel spectacular, Captain,” Tony says and claps his hands, then spreads them out as he spans the view behind the house. “Look at this, how gorgeous this is.”
Bucky swallowed hard and said, “It’s me. Steve, you gotta understand. I’m not the same person. Not anymore. I’m never going to be. You have to know that.”
“Yep, I got you there. I don’t think so. I think that Ultron likes to play with his food, as I said. He wouldn’t do that. He wants us to struggle.”
“Well, Captain, intercourse with a vampire is necrophilia, now, isn’t it? Vampires are considered dead.” Steve frowned as Pierce continued. The Secretary noticed and remarked. “Dead, undead. It’s still a disease that brings with it a clear and present danger to the human population. I understand that you see things differently since vampires came out of from their hiding places and helped saved the world against Nazis and the like.”
When Tony examined Natasha’s and Sam’s faces, he discovered the same dismay and discomfort there that holed up in his own soul.
“Well then, if I’m here to defile you, I might as well get a good peek at that broad chest of yours,” Tony says and begins to unbutton Steve’s semen stained shirt. He doesn’t fight against it, he allows it, welcomes it.
“Meant to be?” Tony offers. It sounds silly. There’s no such thing as soul mates or destiny or fate, but somehow or another they are two parts to a whole.
He slips and falls to the side, hitting his head on the tiled wall. As he slides down the wall, Steve notices the letter still gripped in his hand. He brings it to his chest, holding it tight. His eyelids flicker and get heavier. If he could rest for a bit, everything would be better. He drops to the floor. The warm blood embraces him. He closes his eyes but he hears the sound of something in the distance. It reminds him of an alarm, but it’s foreign and strange.
“Ten years. We bonded when I was fifteen,” Natalie said and sipped her coffee. The Council had taken a break for lunch and Natalie had sought him out to discuss the water rights and the Lanes. “He has a sharp eye and always keeps me prepped for every little thing. He’s a good man.”
“I’m not even sure what that means. We need to get the majority of nations to ask for our help. So, we need to start extending our hand. Lay out on the line what we stand for – a list.” Steve’s consumed all the chicken on his plate and starts on the rolls. Previously Tony poured a nice Riesling for their dinner. He downs the glass in between his bites.
Now it’s a challenge. “We’ll see about that.” Why the hell is he fighting about this? Does he have to fight about everything? He’s so fucking stubborn. “Sorry, Nat. I appreciate it.”
The next thing he knows the alpha seizes his hair and drags him to the rack. “I told you not to come. I told you not to close your eyes.”
Well, that didn’t tell Tony anything new, except his mother had the wrong Sea and he had a picture. Proof of a lion in Norway. Maybe it fell off a cargo ship bound for America? Zoos routinely captured wild lions and brought them to the Western hemisphere, but it was far off track if that were the case. Maybe the ship headed toward Norway and it just wasn’t off track at all. Tony had a lot of researching to do. He spent the better part of the day rummaging through the card catalogue, picking out books, looking through old microfiche to locate any references to the blue-eyed lion. He found a dozen. He checked out what he could and asked the librarian to send to another library to get the article. By the time the afternoon burned away, Tony sat at home with a glass of milk and some cookies, along with his lion and a stack of books.
“Don’t have to tell me twice, Captain,” he replies. He knots the ropes onto the freshly made grappling hook. Once done he hands the entire ensemble over to Steve. “You’ll need to climb up first. I need to close up the armor. I can’t climb in it.”
“No.” He looks up into the coming dusk of night. “There was a coldness to it. Like the deepness of space in your bones. The darkness wrapped around the Red Skull and whisked him away as he howled. I got to the pilot seat and forced the plane down. But it was too late the tendrils of the tesseract had me. Even though it had fallen into the ocean, I felt the chill, the coldness seep into me. It was not like a cube at all, but it had facets upon facets that captured me. Folded me in.” He sighs. “I don’t know how to explain it.”
He coughs and waves to the chair in front of the desk. “Please, Steve sit. Thank you for coming in today. I know it must have been an inconvenience.”
“There’s some. We detected a spike about three hours ago. One of the doctors thought it might be a dream like state, but then it disappeared again.”
Some power courses through Tony and his hands feels like lightning and he yells out against the vision. He turns into the cosmos as well, his human shape vanishing. Yet he’s not gone, he’s never gone. He exists in all time and all space within this cube, within all the higher dimensions. He feels a presence, strong, brave, and familiar.
“Oh no, I’m not sir here.” Jarvis looks over at Tony. There’s a kindness in his demeanor and Tony knows, from long ago experience, that his eyes are soft and tender as if he looked upon his own child in pride.
Ultron may understand the construction of civilization, probably had millions of facts and figures at his disposal, but he never lived and breathed life. He’d only experienced it second hand – maybe that was why he longed to make a living body. Being human means living the vulgarities of life from the pesky insects buzzing around your head in the summer to the song of crickets during the long summer days. The artificial brilliance of Ultron’s mind limits his scope of the real human existence.
“I don’t think I can ask people that,” Steve said. “It’s worked so far, the way I’ve dealt with it.” A sad excuse, that’s what Steve thought, but didn’t voice.
“I should get to Clint” He needed to focus on the critical issues. Steve knew he wasn’t that confused and scrambled from the event. His head might burst but he could follow simple information.
Thor pushed the plate of eggs away. “You must come now. Our good Healer, Bruce, believes he is not stable. He needs your influence as both his friend and his pack leader.”
“Some say you were a coward during the war, sir,” he adds the sir at the end because he realizes he’s just insulted his host.
Tony puts down the tubing. “No. Tell me really. You say the same thing to everyone who asks you. I’ve heard that answer a thousand times on talk shows and news interviews. What’s the real answer?”
“Of course,” Steve says and then deflates – like the anger burnt out and he’s left with not even an ember. He turns away from Tony, head hanging. “Thanks. For everything. I mean. Thanks.”
“Got it,” she says and throws the rest of the shrapnel in the pan. She looks a little too triumphant as she smiles at him.
Over the years Steve fooled around with some of his friends. He liked it. Bucky wasn’t really into guys, but they did have the occasional friends with benefits relationship. It was always relaxing and freeing in a way – just some moments of pleasure in an otherwise grueling life.
After he finishes serving the food, Steve tucks into the meal and eats with a flourish that Tony envies. Ever since he was a child and his father would admonish his mother for the slightest deviance from her diet, Tony always had an issue with food. Filling himself harkened back to those times.
“Don’t you have a mate? A human?” Tony said, and he knew the answer. He didn’t know why he asked. Bruce tugged at his hair a few times and he rocked in his seat. “Hey, you’re not going to go all crazy now are you?” Where the fuck was Natasha when he needed her?
There’s a clean towel by the side of the basin and Steve washes off the dust from the road and the stink of the horses. In the small room there’s also a tub that’s large enough for a man. The water from the well is cold and Steve wonders if Stark bathes in the frigid mountain waters that supply the underground aquifers for their in town wells and irrigation system.
“Yeah,” Clint said. “Nat’s been through a lot of this shit before. So has Thor – I doubt they’ll let this affect anyone under their safety net.”
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked,” Steve says and goes into the bathroom. He closes the door, and, leaning against it, sinks onto the floor. He bends his knees up and folds his arms onto them. He cradles his head there and closes his eyes. His heat dissipates. He’s done. He cannot even hide in the rising tide of desire from his own fears and loss. At least with his presentation he had something to focus on. Now there’s nothing.
“You might have to,” Natasha said. “This isn’t just about you anymore, Stark. It involves all of us.”
He feels like a shit, like he’s just murdered a puppy. He only waves the awkwardness, the pain of shame, away. Steve steps away from him and goes to the small bathroom. When he opens the door, it hits the toilet. He has to step over the toilet to shut the door, which he does. In seconds, Tony hears the water in the shower and weighs whether or not he should leave. He scrubs his hands through his hair and imagines Steve washing away the filth of another man or woman touching him. He wonders who it might be; how many others. Then his mind judders to the red head across the hall.
“What’s wrong about wanting to be with someone?” Tony asked. “We’re two adults. What’s wrong with it?”
“Sorry, sorry.” Steve sounds abashed enough that he spends the next half hour ushering Tony around the large office. It takes a few tries, but Steve is amazingly perceptive and gets the hang of it with ease.
The kiss grows and while Steve has never told him kissing was off limits, he’d never welcomed it until now. Steve cups Tony’s head and they tumble over to the bed. But it isn’t Steve who takes command in the bed as he has in the past. Usually, he asks what Tony wants and gives what Tony needs. This time, it is Tony exploring and tasting and causing the shivering gasps. This time it is hot and sweet and lovely as Tony sucks Steve off as he feels the rise and shudder of Steve beneath him. This time Tony follows his heart’s desires.
Tony feels the rush of blood to his cheeks. He lowers his focus. He’s never bashful, but Steve makes him feel like a middle schooler.
Steve nods. He’d thought they would bring him to a military base and charge him. The Pentagon brings a whole new layer of complexity to the ordeal. Their location doesn’t surprise Tony and that indicates that he knew Steve’s interrogation would occur within the famous building. Steve keeps his face frozen, though the streaks of his tears have to be obvious and his nose is still stuffed up from his emotional outburst. Tony might have manipulated him into reacting, to appear weak so that he would seem more repentant to Ross than he actually is – or will ever be. Ross is a prick and Tony knows it. Steve side glances at Tony and there the faintest touch of a smile on his lips. The fact that Tony is in control and may have worked his magic on Steve should disturb him, but it doesn’t. It relaxes him, settles his furious thoughts.
“Errand? What? Are you going to see someone else? I signed an exclusive-.” Tony’s eyes are wild with fear.
“It’s warm,” Steve says and he wants to explore further, he wants to touch flesh against flesh and he swallows down his needs, pushing them further away.
Tony tugged off his shirt, revealing the arc reactor scar, and then simply nodded to Steve, who did the same. “Now touch me.”
Of course. Tony designed and planned out a place for the team, the pack, and never informed him of anything. Though they’d only been bonded for a few weeks and he doubted that Tony had done all of this in the intervening weeks, Steve would have liked to have been informed. Then he thought about the information on Bucky, how he had waited until he verified everything before approaching Tony. He understood a little of Tony’s argument, though he still stood by his own decision to get all of his ducks in a row before going to Tony with the truth. He pressed his lips together in a tight line. “I didn’t know that Tony had done that. Not really.”
Sam only shook his head and peered out the window as if looking to see if anyone caught sight of them. “Get in.”
“Feel my finger slowly circling, easing your hole. Let yourself relax all those muscles. Breathe in, two, three, four. Hold it, breathe out. One two three four.” He watches as Tony’s entrance opens, a pink pucker. “I’m going to push in now. One finger. Breathe.”
Peeling the label from the beer bottle, Tony says, “Well, retirement never sticks with me.” He hasn’t confessed to anyone that he and Pepper have finally called it quits. She can’t stand him always going back to Iron Man. Ultron ended it for her. She couldn’t get over it and told him. He’s on a march toward death and she wasn’t going to sit around and watch him. She was moving on. “Pepper left me.” He doesn’t mean to say it out loud, but it comes as naturally as the wind in a hurricane, a force of nature to destroy.
“What are you not saying?” Tony said and rounded the island. Steve stopped his endless pacing. “You know there’s more. That’s the feedback loop I’ve been getting.”
Bucky licks his lips and shakes his head back and forth as he reclines against the wall, the thin pillow not enough to cushion him. “No, I have to, have to.”
“So, what’s Ross really want?” Tony asked again. He knew Steve was hiding the real intent of Ross’ visit.
Over the next days, the revelation of the truth hits Steve in little ways. The years he spent lost and wandering in the woods to the years he spent as the henchman for the Soul Keeper. He wakes many times a night sweating and shivering with images scarred into his soul of all the horror he’s witnessed and done on behalf of the wretched Soul Keeper.
Steve misses nothing, laving and licking at his nipples until Tony’s blanking with the sensation, cold and hot together mixing into a breaking wave, and then cresting for more. He pays special attention to curve of Tony’s waist and when he giggles a little at Steve’s ministrations and tries to bat him away, Steve catches his hand and blows delicately on Tony’s wrist. His cock throbs and jumps in response.
Steve struggles back to his feet, forces himself to round the desk and go to the small narrow window with the broken glass. “Yeah, but what or who is he hiding from and when they come to get him, what’s going to happen to us?”
Tony waves at him. “I’m going to try and talk you off the edge again later, Obie. But for now, let’s enjoy the company and the meal.”
When Natasha called him with an urgent alert, he promised to catch up with Sam. He thought it would be like any other mission, like any other day.  It was. Later, he saw Sam one afternoon at the VA. Sam asked him pointed questions, yet Steve didn’t see it as a grilling, but a natural stream of questions. They spent the better part of the night talking and joking. Sam was a good, solid guy. Steve promised to call him soon when he left Sam’s apartment, but then the whole world fell down around him and the pieces of his future that he built transformed into something ugly, a profound and horrible evil. He found himself with Natasha taking refuge in Sam’s apartment, after Fury’s assassination, after nearly being blown to bits in New Jersey. Steve stood with a folder in his hand and Natasha by his side. The folder detailed something called FALCON and Steve discovered that Sam was not a pilot at all but something fantastical.
“Okay, you want a job, you want to do something. Get us a town doctor, or at least someone to shoe our horses,” Steve says. “Do that, and I can deputize you.”
He strips down and goes to his ensuite bathroom. JARVIS already has the water running from the multiple showerheads. Steam fills the marble tiled room. He steps into the large walk in shower, the cascade of water hits him, and he stands in the middle of it. The water pelts him from different angles, and he closes his eyes. For long minutes, his mind goes blank and he washes away the last day. Like nothing ever happened.
“Steve! Fuck,” Tony said and bent down on one knee in front of Steve as he cracked his eyes open. “Can you walk? God, you’re so pale.”
He checks his belt along the back for his grenades. They’re all tucked in and in place. The Guard might not have a lot of supplies but he’s been able to scare up some nice grenades, assault blasters, and some stingers for good measure. They won’t get a signal from Clint saying whether or not he’s gotten away and to the rendezvous point; they are on radio silence.
Clint nudged the bottle toward Steve’s mouth. It had a straw that Clint snapped into place so that Steve could drink. Gently, Clint placed the straw at Steve’s lips as he spoke in low tones. “I’m so sorry. I had to. My wife, my kids.”
“No.” He chuckles. A lot of these people find him amusing and Steve’s not sure if he should be insulted. The big man adds, “No. My name. They call me Happy. You’ll get to know me a lot around here. I do all the boss’ security.”
“I don’t think I failed, Nat. I think I did exactly what I intended to do. Tony was wrong for trying to kill Bucky and I am never going to apologize for stopping him,” Steve says.
Steve cringes. He’s been more than vocal to Natasha over the last month regarding the hours, bedding, and even spoke out for Wanda when a certain client had been abusive. He’d still do it today, because he knows Natasha wants her workers to be forthcoming.
“Then you will cease,” Frigga says, and the white light turns to a beautiful yellow light and consumes everything in the realm. The power of the Soul Stone realized.
They are lying in bed, spent and happy against the morning light. Tony has never known someone as strong and as forward in what he wants in bed as Steve. When Tony woke up this morning, Steve had been sitting watching him. He scooped him up and planted him on his lap, together they found their way to fruition. After then, Steve took Tony slower, preparing him, scissoring his fingers and then dragging them in and out until Tony nearly cried with need. Tears had prickled his eyes as he begged for release. Steve gave him more but made him wait. When he’d come a second time that morning it fragmented every part of his soul into shards that glittered in the morning light. Steve kissed him back to reality.
Natasha was looking down at the desk, avoiding Steve’s gaze. She hated him already. The future hated him. “But Barton might-,” he started.
“Now, sir, you know who does the experiments. They’ve been doing them for years now. They even had you to their labs when you were younger as I heard.” Rumlow smacked his lips – like he was fucking devouring every ounce of horror throbbing from Tony. It must have been a feast for the asshole.
When his mind turned to Tony and his heart fluttered in response, he needed to grab the side of the shower and hold himself steady or else he would collapse. What the hell was he going to do? How was he going to handle Bucky
Steve wants to answer but silences his reply. He waits for at least another half hour before he’s sure that Tony’s breathing has evened out and slowed. He calls Tony’s name a few times just to be sure, and then he slips off the bed and hits the enter key. He only hesitates a second before he does it. He can’t not do it. But the fear is real. What if something happens? They’re on an isolated island far from any medical help. He needs to believe in Tony and not his fears born out of years of his sickness or his mother’s. The computer softly beeps when he hits the start. He watches the screen for a minute, but there’s nothing really to see, just the progress. Tony keyed in all the steps. Steve has nothing to do but wait. He has at least another hour before he can sleep as well.
“The only question is,” Natasha said. “Are we going in to neutralize the Hydra base or are we going in to get out pack mates?”
His intentions were true. He honestly believed he would keep all lines open, that he would use the soul bonds, his pack, as his foundation, his anchor. Yet the same time Steve actively worked to keep it at a distance. Maybe he fooled himself, he refused to think about it. But as he stood facing off with Bucky something changed – his core vibrated with such agony the only thing he could do in order to finish the job was to shut it all down. He focused on one thing, the Helicarriers and getting them down. The man before him – he closed off and only thought of as the Winter Soldier. Saving him would be second, and it pained Steve down to his core, to his marrow to admit that, to battle with the automaton with his friend’s face.  Echoes from the soul pack reverberated again and again like a constant knocking on the door, but he ignored it. He shunned his pack and forged onward, fighting his friend as if it was the last thing he would do.
“You have to do this,” Steve said. “Just like I have to do this. Don’t think that your suffering is any less than mine. Do it. Do it quick.”
He’s listening still, following Steven’s lead. It’s strange how it feels so natural, so right to stand beside Steven – almost as equals. Every dictate and rule of society tells him differently. Steven is not his equal. Something has changed within him. He knows that now. Maybe it was the bonding, though he’d heard stories of alphas falling desperately in love with their omegas it was generally frowned upon in polite society. Omega were security, status symbols, confidants, but not a beloved. Tony has to admit over the last days he’s come to admire Steven and even desire him more than just as an omega. He finds he likes Steven, truly likes him. He thinks that’s allowed, but he doesn’t remember. The exhaustion from the day eats at him.
Steve doesn’t know where to look, knows he shouldn’t gaze into Tony’s eyes, that the path to ruin surely starts there. “You should listen to them.”
There are truths in this world. Truths that Steve knows. The truths about himself are clear but mainly only known to himself. Ultron batters his consciousness, trying to shred it. Steve holds onto what he knows is true.
“A lab technician with great technical drafting skills. I think he’s exactly what I need,” he says and then hisses as the pain increases in his head. It’s spreading now, as it always does. It’s the strain on his optical nerve and the feedback from the implant. He might not feel pain in the nerve but the stress always causes headaches and spasms. He powers through it, as he always does. “How fast can we finish the security and background checks?”
“This one – I love this one the most,” Jane says and places it on the drafting table. It’s one of Tony’s eyes. “I love how the one eye is just an eye but the other one – it’s like you used cubism to get a look into his soul. The different images on the cubes-.”
The wind along the causeway prickles his bare skin and he wishes he’d worn something heavier than the jacket. He grimaces as he follows Pep into the building. He hates this building. It feels more like a rat maze then a housing structure. In many ways it is akin to a rat maze – this is where they keep all feral or damaged omegas.
“I am a sub, my lord,” Steven said and then took Tony’s entire length into his mouth and down his throat. His tongue felt deliciously perverse against Tony’s cock and the swell of his knot.
The words Estane espoused even today still echo in Tony’s head. He remembers them from when he was a child, though now they are laced with more malice. Today Estane lectured about how the omega warrior was a thing of the past and that alphas needed to go back to the Medieval practice of Stalls, whole stables of omegas at their bidding. Ready to be fucked or die. Tony had been shaken, the memories of his childhood and teenaged years rattling through him. Estane went on to say that every alpha should have an army of omegas, bonded and fucked into submission. No special class. Just warrior drones as he called them.
Tony turns around, not willing to face the truth, not willing to look Pepper in the eye. “I know what I said, I know. But I also know what I know, okay? He’s not dead. I have to get to him and, if the army and those military asshats won’t go and save one of their own, I’m going to.”
“If you chose to think of it that way, then yes. But you could think of it as a get out of jail free card. You stay with me. We could start over, Steve.” Tony’s voice had been so earnest and hopeful. Yet the memory of Tony with his arms shielding his face blocked out everything else. Their fight an indelible scar on Steve’s brain. Tony would never trust Steve again.  Steve shook his head and said nothing in return.
He nods. Sometimes, Wanda’s older than her years. “I won’t Wanda, I promise.” He disconnects and tells himself he told the truth to his friend. As he pushes those doubts aside, Steve taps his implant comm and rings through to Natasha. It takes a few tries before she answers.
Pepper put her finger to her lips to tell him to stay quiet. He went to join her on the ratty couch. Natasha sat in the only recliner but stayed on the edge staring at the television as if she might do it harm with just her gaze. Thor hung close to the newel post of the railing to the staircase. He and Natasha were still at odds over Loki’s containment. Over near the corner of the living room, at the boarded up windows, Bruce stood. His eyes flitted around the room.
“Meditation is good, but I think we need to set up a couple of exercises where we need to get in contact with one another, work through the bond at some distance.” Steve forked a meatball. “Combat exercises would help us hone the pack bond.”
As Steve works, he doesn’t look up at Tony, but he does address him. “Seems to me that the last 10 years might be a little about avoiding the truth and not facing it.”
Steve gagged as he finished the bottle and Clint staggered away. “It’s done.” Clint handed the empty bottle to one of the other agents in the room. He rubbed at his eyes and stared at Steve. “I’m done. I want my family. I’m done.”
After a long pause, Steve says, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked. It’s not my business. Would you like assistance to the table?”
“I saved Aria, and after I deposited her back with the Elders of Shield, I left in hopes I could right many wrongs against the Carbonelli family. I ended up in stasis, though I had tried to end it since I failed in my mission.” Steven’s voice is tight and controlled.
“Well, fuck them,” Tony says and zooms closer to his target. It only takes a little under an hour to get back to the area of his discontent.
Tony doesn’t ask what that means. He doesn’t want to know. He eats the oats while watching the lion. It lays on its side in the shadows of the room. “I think it’s supposed to intimidate us.”
“I’m sorry I have to leave you right off,” Steve says and pours his guest some coffee. “You still like it strong then?”
Clint grumbled, “That was as clear as mud. We’re supposed to believe him? I knew about soul mates and crap but everyone knows it just fairy tales.”
Ignoring her, Tony pulls out his phone again and scrolls through his news feed. It’s all about the attack on Manhattan and how well the new Avengers did with stopping it before it spread. They’re highlighting the newest members, Falcon, the White Wolf (aka Winter Soldier), Black Panther, etc. There are interviews of scared citizens thanking the Avengers. The whole of it smears in Tony’s view because he cannot stop from crying. He clicks off the news and then stares at his phone – slowly, his thumb hits the Stark browser.
“Seems you might be a lot like your grandfather. He wanted to do the right thing, help people, save the world from the Nazis.”
That strikes deep and true. Tony recoils. “God, I thought you were better than them. I thought you were -.”
It shocks him how much the stress of so many years strips Pepper bare of her usual happy and confident façade. He’d never guessed.  He rails against the ableist society while pretending to be one of them. Pepper, Rhodey, Jarvis – all of them – have worked to shore up his image and ensure no one would know the truth. He never wanted to be a burden; he tried his damnedest not to be. But in fact, what he’s done is the opposite.
Sam brought light to his darkest days. It had been Sam who had led Steve out of the shadow of the prison camp. Mentally, Steve had been in a particularly bad place, they called it spells. He'd fall into long stupors of memories, like terrors that plagued him and the sorrow of the nights and days spent at the prison camp during the war overwhelmed him. Sometimes, even the days before the prison camp plagued him. How his small troop of soldiers, the Howling Commandoes, assisted the 16th regiment in their attack on Antietam – the most horrific day of his life. He could still smell the blood and septic stench of wounds. Those days came back to him as did the months in the prison.  The doctors had wanted to diagnose him with acute mania or irregularities of his mental processes. They’d wanted to commit him to a hospital for the insane in New York City, but the military brass held back. How could they put him away when he’d been a decorated, celebrated war hero?
“Not Steve?” Tony said and pushed Natasha and Clint aside so he could face Bucky directly. He ignored the rambling, ranting man scarfing down food at the table. “What do you mean that’s not Steve.”
He pushes a hand through his hair and feels the tight grip on his chest, not unlike the feeling of his asthma attacks. Guilt, plain and simple grips him, constricting and squeezing the air out of his lungs. “Damn it.”
“Steve happened. I wasn’t quite ready for it. I will be next time.” Bruce’s shoulders slumped as he eased back in the chair. “I need tea.”
Buck only smiles, it’s weak and broken and reminds Steve of when he’d rescued Bucky – half out of his mind with pain from the torture some lunatic holed up in the middle of nowhere inflicted on him. “Be all right, you’ll see. Better than you.” His gaze drifts and his sights fall on Stark. A sadness comes over him. “Don’t get yourself in trouble, Stevie. When I go, don’t get yourself in trouble.”
“No,” Natasha said, but her stare was icy cold. Either she didn’t like that he submitted to the tests or she hated the idea that it hurt him – or Bruce. Whichever, it ended up with both Natasha and Fury pissed at him. “You shouldn’t let people hurt you to prove a point. Believe me, that never ends well.” She rolled her eyes and headed toward the door.
For some inexplicable reason, Tony needs to know. He needs to understand how Steven sees him so that he can confirm, deny, or rectify it. “So, what do you see? What do you know about us?”
Tony brushes his thumb over the angular jut of Steve’s knee cap. “You’re so big I forget how slim you are, too.” His hand travels down Steve’s calf. “Sometimes without the visual keys I don’t really have an image in my mind of how you look. I kind of link you to sound or a fragrance. Like Pepper – she’s always strawberries to me, even though she’s deathly allergic to them. She wears this perfume that has an undercurrent of strawberries to it. She doesn’t smell it. I do.”
“You forget, I’m  valuable commodity. I’m a rich man and many want to be in my presence, not all of them for the right reasons, Captain.  Plus, he’s my kind of doctor. He was kicked out of high society,” Tony says with a shrug. “Seems he has a bit of a temper and it didn’t go well with his intended’s father – some colonel. Tore up a whole army base or some shit. He would have ended up at the short end of a hangman’s rope if it wasn’t for Betsy – his intended- stepping in.”
Natasha scrutinized each of them before replying, “Well that’s going to be a little difficult considering he hasn’t even met two of the pack members – not really. And we’d have to get them here.”
Steve had stood there, shocked, mortified. He couldn’t explain anything to Tony. He didn’t want to explain anything to him.
Settling his conflicted emotions, Steve shook his head. “And if I bond to you and I still want to go to SHIELD?” Steve asked with his arms crossed over his chest.
Steve hadn’t known what it was. “Okay.” As a sub he longed to learn everything, experience all that Tony had to offer.
“Inside the thing-.” Steve says and sees Tony shake violently against the cold. They are both going to die of exposure if Steve doesn’t get his act together. He checks out the device, sees a small metal panel on the front. He twists the tiny knob and the metal door opens to reveal the inner housing. It looks like the inside of a clock, except it’s sputtering and popping instead of ticking away. He has no idea what it does. All he knows is that it keeps Tony’s heart functioning and Tony alive.
