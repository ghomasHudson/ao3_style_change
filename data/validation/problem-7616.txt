Steve doesn’t have a crush on Tony, because to have a crush on Tony he’d have to be gay, and he just doesn’t think that’s the case. It’s not that he thinks there’d be any problem if he was, but he knows with absolute certainty the way he’d felt about Peggy, the way he’d loved her with more than just the virtuousness of Captain America.
someone gay.”
“Fine,” he sighs. “We’ll start fresh in the morning.”
“You can take it out on me.” Tony sounds quietly desperate, but he can’t bring himself to mind. “Please. Anything.”
“I mean it,” Steve continued, and it was clear he was on one of his unstoppable social justice rants. Tony just stepped back to enjoy the view. “You never know when you’re talking to a member of the LGBT community. And you shouldn’t make assumptions.”
“I’m allowed to want things,” Steve replies.
Steve, dazed, forgets to correct Tony on how many people he's kissed and says instead: “I like your beard.”
“I’m not the only one with super-hearing in this house, you know,” he says. “Wouldn’t want to disturb the neighbors.”
Tony thinks he might, a little. For him, his life orients itself around the dividing line the Ten Rings had provided. After his captivity, he’d become Iron Man and he’d refused to make space for anything else. He’d given his company to Pepper and thrown himself into trying to single-handedly save the world, for better or worse. Right now, he’s pretty sure it’s coming out ‘worse’.
Tony wheezed out a laugh. “Sorry about him, I think he learned about gay rights from greeting cards.” He paused. “And sorry about the whole—spectacle. We’ll go somewhere more private.”
Steve sighed, bringing a large hand up to wrap around Tony’s bicep. His gaze was searing. “I know how much you like to blame yourself, Tony. You made a bad call, based on limited information—we all did. The important thing is that we fixed our mistake.”
“No, I’m trying to come out,” Steve said.
When he finally flicks his eyes open, Steve is smiling down at him, something at once sad and happy in his eyes.
“I’m getting to it!” Tony shouts back, eyes never leaving Steve’s face. Quieter, he says, “Am I allowed to get to it?”
“No, no,” Tony says. He touches his mouth wonderingly, keeping his eyes closed. “Both are fine. You didn’t—yeah. You should take whatever you want.”
In the end, it’s Rhodey who brings it up, and Steve just happens to be there.
“Dear god, you actually meant it when you said you never Googled me,” Tony said.
“I’m still mad with you,” Steve reminds him.
“It takes more than a painful memory to put me out of commission, Stark,” Nat says. Her voice isn’t unkind, but it’s distant. She’s not looking for conversation, but she’s the only one Tony doesn’t feel guilty talking to. “And anyway, I know where the safehouse is.”
“Funny things are,” Tony replies instantly, eyes crinkling at the corners. And then there’s really nothing for Steve to do except cast his book aside, kneel down on the floor in front of Tony, and kiss him.
“I’m not going to kill you in your sleep,” Steve says.
“That’s right, pal.”
The man is just about recognizable, now that Tony’s looking at his face instead of just his gorgeous metal arm. His hair’s tied back into a bun, and his clothes are modern (tank top and jeans), but he’s still—
Steve was smiling at him, relaxed and easy in a way Tony hadn’t seen since—well, it had been a while.
Art for the last chapter.
Steve’s arms went around his body as he guided Tony on using the telescope mounted to the parapet. Taking turns to peer inside, they admired the bright orange star at the base of what looked like a kite, which marked out the
“I’m sorry,” Tony choked out, between sobs. “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what came over me. I wasn’t myself. I was alone and he came and he said those things. I told him to stop. But he wouldn’t let go. And I wanted it to be you, Steve. I wanted it to be you.”
“Do you remember what you said?” Steve asked. “Right before you closed your eyes?”
“Okay,” Tony said, reasonably.
Spots of pink appeared on Peter’s green cheeks. “In my defence, you already had it memorised,” Peter argued.
“Yes," Steve told him. " You know, I was going to wait till it was completely ready but this feels like a good moment.”
He was about to order a scotch for himself and a vodka martini (with olives, lots of olives, like at least three olives) for Pepper when a tall, blond (and vaguely familiar-looking) man walked into his line of sight.
“Tahiti. Magical place. Heaven,” he said, swooning.
“We think he’s working for the Mandarin.”
Steve, however, had no time for small talk. “Whatever Loki is trying to do, he made it personal. He hit us all right where we live. Why?”
Happy and warm in his nest, their nest, it dawned on Tony that Steve’s embrace, while close and tight, wasn’t a cage, but a perch for him to find his footing and spread his wings. Before taking off for the sky. And on that perch, Tony felt like he could fly.
Having heard Steve, Pietro left his sister’s side and walked over. “It’s a token of our gratitude,” the young prince explained. “We would have offered it to you sooner, but there was work that had to be done.”
“He found the heartstone, glowing bright purple, just floating in the air, and he had almost closed his fist around it when a strong force knocked him out of the way and into a tree.”
“Tony,” Steve groaned. “I can’t. Not when you’re like this.”
Within the crucible, the flames danced merrily, and Steve gazed at them with the same focus he gave his birthday candles, on which he invariably wished for the same things – peace for the kingdom, justice for Valoria’s enemies, and under his breath, when he was sure no one could hear, he always made one for himself.
“Tell me the story again?” Tony asked, as he settled down in a nice spot between the tree’s roots.
“Can I have it? I’m working on a little project.”
He couldn’t contain the smile spreading across his face, as he read the comic about two married engineers,
Rhodey’s voice was on the comms again, confirming that he and Nat had neutralised the threats, curing some and killing others, which they reacted to with little whoops of victory.
“Not all,” Tony countered, and looked thoughtful. “They have their dragons.”
“I do,” he said, well aware of King Howard’s mixed feelings regarding the alliance. He’d heard stories about how protective the king was, how Prince Anthony rarely left the castle and if he did, was never without his banner of trusted knights.
Two days later, Howard and Maria died in a car accident.
“No,” Steve said, so vehemently, that it startled him because this wasn’t just being on a different page, it felt like they were reading a different book.
“We don’t decide for others – no. But Bruce,” he said, his voice pleading now. “This is my choice. Tony is the chosen one and I’m just – me.”
stay awake over it.
Tony was the brightest thing he’d ever seen, the warmest thing he’d ever touched. And the sparks had flown between them. Loving someone like Tony meant getting burnt, but Steve didn’t care. All he wanted was to be smothered in the heat, to feel his pink lips melting into his own, and to drown in those pools of liquid gold which blazed with passion and desire -
“What were you thinking?” Tony asked when he paused to observe the new skin forming over the cuts – a sight that left Steve wide eyed and slack jawed.
“They were outside your room, sitting in a row, like children in a schoolroom. Howard said they didn’t work, complained that you spent too much time on them. But they worked, didn’t they? They all did. No one knew. Because you said the cooking machine cleaned and the cleaning machine cooked. It
“Hey!” Clint started to protest, but Nat placed her hand over his and looked pointedly at his wedding band, reminding him of his own responsibilities to his wife and children.
“It’s you,” Steve said. He was wearing a brave face, but Tony could see his hands shaking.
Steve had heard about it even though he’d forgotten some of the details, and there was that statue of the dragon in the great hall of the Sanctum Sanctorum.
“You okay?” Steve yelled, but his eyes were still fixed on the dragons battling above them.
Sorry this took so long! It was initially a 10,000-word chapter that took me forever to edit. I've decided to split it up now. The second part is almost done so I hope to post it soon-ish. I'm really sorry for how long this is taking. I really am trying my best but it's just super hard to write. Thank you so much for being so patient! <3
They had to change their plan of attack, so Tony tossed the solution at Steve. Steve read his mind, the chemistry between them negating the need for a bond.
The couple on the patio were enjoying their 7 o’ clock sherry when they heard the sound of tyres running over the pebbled driveway. They stood up, staring in disbelief, as Tony came bounding towards their residence on the estate.
It was nice, just spending time together, listening to the leaves rustling softly in the trees, with no talk of strategies and plans or swords and armour. Well, there was
Ahhh I'm feeling emotional. Excuse me while I go to a corner and cry. Thank you so much for joining me on this journey! I love you 3000! <3
Riding into the courtyard, it was even more apparent how confident the Sorcerer Supreme was in his magical powers, as he left his domain completely unguarded, relying purely on spells to shield the temple, its inhabitants and the magical relics it housed.
Steve shot him a funny look. “I don’t know,” he mumbled. “End up with Bucky, probably,” he added, shrugging.
But I'm sorry this took so long!
“You have a family?”
Hi! This is the next chapter! Sorry it took so long!
He tried to stay calm, contemplating the epitaph on his tombstone:
Steve was about to say something, to ask questions, but Queen Maria had beaten him to it.
With a heavy sigh, Tony followed.
“You did great, Pete," Tony said and Peter beamed at the praise. "But you're going to keep going for a while more. I haven't told Steve,” he explained.
Tony’s face melted into a relieved smile. “Oh good, that’s great. Because, you see, the dragon, he’s - I - he’s - STRANGE!” Tony shouted, and his eyes widened while he stared over Steve’s shoulder.
Steve eyed the dragon cautiously. “When you say food, what exactly do you mean?” he asked.
“Here we are,” Obie said, with an amused smile.
Bucky caught up soon enough, and swung his sword at the riders as his horse drew close. “Three, four, five,” he grunted, counting the berserkers that fell by his sword.
“Smash.”
And he was gone.
It had begun as a hobby, with Tony forging small pieces of furniture to offer himself some comfort, but one thing led to another and before he knew it, Tony had built himself an iron fortress atop the highest mountain in the range, which provided him with the most magnificent of views.
“One.”
Tony paused, then opened his mouth again, saying the words as carefully as he could. “Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky.” He paused to swallow the huge lump in his throat. “He killed my mom.”
“He does now,” Strange muttered. “You are growing well,” he added, and nodded approvingly as his beady eyes went over Tony’s shoulders and arms, before he gave the prince an infuriating pat on his back.
On his other side, Tony was showing Bruce the best way to swing his new mace, one he’d made with cutting-edge anti-dragon technology, the lot of which he’d presented to Steve like some sort of dowry.
What made it harder was his inability to put into words the qualities he was looking for. Things like “mutual interest” and “reciprocal candour” often came to mind, but until he was physically interacting with the other person, there was no way of knowing if sparks would fly.
The blood drained from the Steve's face and he looked like he was about to throw up. “I’m so sorry,” he whispered. “I was told you wanted this. I - I didn’t know.”
“I'm terrified. Of holding you back. Or ruining your life. It's not going to be easy being my husband. It's never going to be easy. And this wasn't what you wanted. At least not in the beginning."
. His husband had even highlighted important concepts and written notes by the side on the points he wanted to discuss with Tony.
Resting his chin on Peter’s shoulder, Tony’s gaze returned to Steve. “I mean he loves me, you know? Told me so himself,” he added quietly, still looking at him.
Their names evoked something in Tony’s memory. He was certain he’d never met them before. Yet, there was something familiar about them.
A physical assessment detected multiple contusions and broken ribs. But that wasn’t all they broke. Attempting to unplug the medical equipment hooked up to him, he found a series of cables connected to his chest. Not his chest, but something in it.
“He’s sailing back on the
“These gems will someday shine again,” he promised. “It might take a hundred years, or even a thousand. I can wait. But one day, the homo draconi will rise and drive out these dimwits, and the homo sapiens will be no more.”
“Just like that?” he asked.
Killian shook his head, clucking his tongue. “Selfish of him to keep you to himself if he’s not going to treat you right.”
“I think you look great,” Peter said, snuggling into his chest. “I missed you.”
Inside the suit, Tony groaned.
Tony forced his eyes open. The wooden box was on the floor and a small top was spinning on top of it. It was small, about the size and shape of an acorn, but slightly wider in the middle, similar to the seed of the heartewoode tree.
“I run an independent think-tank called A.I.M. We were working with the late Mr Stark to replicate the super-soldier serum formula that Dr Erskine made.”
Tony recalled the time he fought his way out of the cave. He’d felt invincible. And if he played it right, he could be invisible too. No one had to know. Especially not Steve. Not in his current state. He needed to keep him safe.
“You go first. I’ll catch up,” Steve insisted, trying to sit up despite Tony holding him firmly by the shoulders.
He was going to bed. Breakfast would be at eight the next morning and he didn’t want to be late. Besides, Tony was exhausted. He would close his eyes and drift off into a deep, restful slumber, fall fast asleep so he didn’t have to think of Steve.
There were none.
Steve spoke first, his voice cutting through the silence of the night. “God, Tony. All that red and gold. You have no idea what it’s doing to me. I can see why you don’t want to give up the suit. Quite frankly, I don’t want you to ever take it off either. What are we going to fight about now?”
His arrival at the tower was greeted by an eerie silence. Rhodey hadn’t been exaggerating about how quiet it was. He soon realised how much of the tower's activity had previously revolved around SHIELD, not till they'd moved out into their own headquarters at Washington D.C., leaving the first thirty floors of the building vacant. Not finding Steve in their apartment, he headed to the workshop, but he didn’t find him there either.
“Heal them?” Tony scoffed, glowering at Killian. “He turned them into living, breathing balls of fire. Father was right to condemn him. It was a shame he escaped.”
It was straightforward plan and Tony had no questions, so he was surprised when Steve didn’t leave when he was done. Instead, the king hung around, opening and closing his mouth, hemming and hawing, as if he had something to ask.
Then, Killian, drunk on his power, drew up and glowed, breathing fire into the sky like a dragon. Tony forced himself to wait, shooting at Killian in a desperate bid to keep him away from Steve and to buy themselves time.
“Who else am I going to have them with?” Steve asked, bemused.
Thank you to
Tony roared loudly in a lively rejoinder and sent a jet of fire toward the sky, and it caused the spectators to erupt in boisterous cheers.
sword to keep
“Yeah. Hey- Where are you going?” Tony asked, when Steve turned to leave.
Steve flinched and turned away sharply. “Yeah,” he muttered, in a voice Tony could have sworn sounded strained.
The end of a tyrant, and a new era begins.
Tony looked hesitantly at Steve. “I don’t know. Should I?” he asked.
“Steve!” he tried again, more insistently this time.
Bonding was just one of the things Steve wasn’t interested in and Tony would have to deal with that.
“I – Wait. How do you know my name? And how do you know about that? The potion?” Steve asked, eyes narrowing in suspicion.
“I know,” Tony said, a little too quickly.
“Fuck,” Steve replied, dropping the hand like it was burning coal.
“Are you going to be okay?”
Following that little display, they peeled off their photostatic veils, tickets to the most exciting box seats in the century, revealing their real identities to those present.
He never needed one anyway. Just a word, a name – Pepper, and he’d dropped all commitments to be there. She was laughing at his War Machine joke (that no one else found funny), so he took it as a cue to leave them alone.
Tony felt his heart race then slow down as Steve closed the gap, shyly placing his soft lips against his own. He savoured the aftertaste of vanilla ice cream, deeply inhaling the scent that was distinctly Steve’s own.
It was a great plan, a solid plan. In fact, until about an hour ago, Tony had been planning to do the same. “But what will you do? Because if you’re turning 25, just like me, then time is running out.”
The medallion wasn’t a family heirloom, but a token of love. It was beautiful and magical and everything that the dragon was and Steve wasn’t. It made his head and heart hurt, but it belonged to Tony, so Steve couldn’t bear to put it down, even taking it with him when he fled the temple.
“You know what? We’re done,” Steve said, decisively, switching to his captain’s voice. “I was hoping you were going to be reasonable. But it doesn’t matter.”
“Does it still hurt?” his mom asked, pausing to look at him closely.
“J, create flight plan. Gulmira.”
The inevitable confrontation.
From his position, right in front of their billowing flags, Steve could see the king and queen exiting the royal carriage. They were waving at the crowd, but Steve recognised the grim expressions they wore. It was the same look on every parent’s face as they sent a child to the camps, where young children were baptised in the fire of combat, learning that death on the battlefield was the greatest glory. One would return from the camps Valorian.
“Looking good, Tony,” Killian said, sweeping his disgusting hands over his clothed body. “It’s not very useful as a disguise though. I sniffed you out the moment you entered my building. And now, like the first mouse, you’ve walked right into my trap.” Killian kicked the trolley out of the elevator, dragging Tony behind him.
Apart from the spirit of a legendary dragon, they had the whole island to themselves, which meant that there was nothing standing in the way of making their marriage real.
“If he’s this far gone, I should be the one to bring him in. I’m the one least likely to die trying,” Steve argued, staying on his course.
. While they opposed each other in play, Tony knew that when it really mattered, they would always fight on the same side. If Bucky had been Steve’s companion, then Rhodey was his.
his jacket in case it got chilly, but lately, he was running hot.
Tony found himself swept away in a wave of young couples rushing to the department stores, where several new collections were being launched. The war was over, which meant that manufacturers no longer had to work within the constraints of austere rationing policies. With the surge in luxury goods now flooding the market, Tony sometimes found himself longing for a special someone to dote on and shower with gifts.
Tony cursed himself for leaving it out. They were having a moment, and now it was going to be ruined. “Uh - It’s a replica,” he said, casually. “Looks just like the real thing, huh?”
So, Tony directed his efforts toward locating Steve and Nat. He found them speeding down the freeway towards Fury’s crash. Tony’s hand flew over his mouth when the same masked man, who attached Fury, landed on the roof of their car, shooting through the roof directly at Nat.
, one of their recently-launched successes.  There were a couple of texts from Pepper about the MIT commencement speech, which he promptly replied (to avoid being harangued). And a few texts from Rhodey asking why the tower was so quiet and where everyone was, which he promptly ignored.
“Not really, considering they’re selecting a life partner.”
“Mr Stark,” he said, friendly smile on his face. "We met two years ago. At a party. Just like this one.”
“Fury tried to delay
Hi! Sorry for the long delay. Here is the last chapter! I hope you like it! :D
Steve smiled at him. “There are hundreds of islands like this one. They will see our boat, and move on,” Steve said, explaining the unspoken code of conduct amongst honeymooning couples about the isles.
the dishonest one here?”
Tony felt his horns retreating into his head, his wings retracting inside his body. Scales softened into skin as his body returned to his birth form to conserve his energy.
, he thought, as his heart felt like it was about to braek.
Because Tony was a mechanic. And fixing things was what he did.
“You really think I’d need them?” Fury said, his voice strained. “Wife kicked me out.”
(tumblr) for the wonderful work on the ring art. :D
“Nooooo!” Tony gasped, eyes as wide as saucers. “Tell me everything.”
Obie had scaled the corporate beanstalk, double-dealing with the enemy to line his pockets. But he wasn’t content with the bag of gold coins. He had his eye on the golden weapons company and the golden goose. And when the goose tried to escape his clutches, he decided to have it slaughtered for all the eggs he could at once. He never thought it would bite, severing the beanstalk and sending him hurtling towards death.
“Oh, right,” Tony said, with a roll of his eyes. “Explains why you were looking a little tied up.”
A loud thump overhead announced Thor’s arrival.
Steve turned away quickly, as if to hide his face and Tony wondered how much more pain he was concealing behind his smile.
“What? No,” Tony protested. We will need a do-over, because this – this is not a date. Now, we’re probably too late for the coffeehouse, but there’s a wonton joint just two blocks from here.” He paused. “I don’t know what wontons are, but I wanna try ‘em.”
“Why? You coming?”
“Bucky..."
“We’re clear,” Clint said. “Nat’s here. Pretty sure we’ve got this covered.”
Electroshock batons for the Black Widow. Specialised arrowheads for Hawkeye. Would Dr Banner be interested in a metal containment shell to minimise the Hulk’s damage for when he went on a rampage? An upgrade of their communications system?
The walls were intact, and the flooring too. But their mementos, books, paintings, having failed to express just how much Tony meant to him, lay uselessly in heaps of ash. The wooden gift box peeked out from underneath a rug. Of course, Tony had chosen the medallion over it.
Steve was left to fill in the blanks.
The big one, with rough scales and spikes covering his body, spoke first. “Tony,” he boomed, stretching his bat-like wings outward in greeting.
“Yes,” Steve mumbled, without looking up.
Tony gasped at the painful intrusion. In those moments, with his eyes watering and head feeling like it might explode, he wondered if he would survive it at all. It would have been easier to let her in, so she could find whatever she wanted, and leave.
This time, her hand lingered on his cheek, so he took her hand and kissed the back of it.
Bucky eyed him coldly, flicking the dagger in his hand as he walked toward the messenger. “You tried to kill Natalia. That’s the last thing you’ll ever do, pal.” Swiftly, he hauled him to his feet, keeping a firm grasp on his shoulders, even as he looked toward Steve, who gave the knight a small nod.
“For Valoria,” Sarah echoed quietly and allowed Steve to kiss her cheek and straighten the sleeve of her gossamer gown. He took her arm and led her to the shade of a birch tree, where she could wait more comfortably.
It didn’t even matter that the universe at stake, because to Steve, Tony was the sun, the moon and all of the stars.
Steve and Tony arrive at Shieldberg and Tony learns more about Steve and his new country. They receive a message from Emperor Thanos.
“Someday,” Tony promised, “I will.”
He took her hand, dragging her towards the communal kitchen, hoping a good talk was all it would take for her to discard the burned-up boosters holding her back.
“What it needs is meat,” Strange said.
“I can’t believe it,” Tony said, still laughing. “My knight in shining armour is a dragon in gleaming scales. Why didn’t you tell me?” he added, a tinge of hurt in his voice.
Thankfully, Killian loved to talk. A lot.
Tony stiffened. He knew that war was on their shores, but he hadn’t quite realised how close it was.
“Tony.”
Strange landed in front of them and held his hands in front of him. “Those attacking on a whim, will face the Shield of Seraphim,” the sorcerer said, before he erected a red filigree shield, which sent the enemy rider and horse flying backward into the charging troops.
“There it is,” Nat said.
Holding the top of Steve’s armoured headpiece, Thanos stared down at the struggling king with keen interest, and studied his movements like one would some sort of exotic insect.
“got a bad feeling about this-”
“How do we know which ones are on our side?”
“Yes,” Steve whispered.
A quick analysis of the drink Killian had offered confirmed Steve’s suspicions. There were traces of drugs, of the variety to artificially bring on an omega’s heat. Meant to increase a couple’s chances of conception, it had been employed in a much more sinister way in his case.
“I have a plan!” he shouted. "Get down!"
“In the face!” Tony echoed, quite gleefully, which caused the sparrows nearby to take off.
“I'm sorry. I'm don't - " Tony puffed, frowning at Steve as he tried to make sense of the words coming out of his mouth, wondering if Steve had indeed been struck by a rock.
The lady named Wanda frowned at this act of defiance and clenched her fingers into a fist, using her magic to force the reluctant king to his knees.
Dark wings sprouted from Obie’s back as his talons lengthened into swords. His skin thickened to scales, even though blood continued to ooze from the deeper cuts. While looking considerably weaker than when he first started, Obie was still a dragon and had every advantage over Tony.
A N T H Y R A K S T O N
Tony’s plan for his first day as a married man was to stay in his room as long as he possibly could, delaying the inevitable meeting with his husband. But his treasonous mind wouldn’t stop thinking of the pop-tarts he’d seen in the larder. And his traitorous stomach convinced him that raiding said larder was necessary to his survival.
If only he hadn’t been looking so intently at his beloved, or if his eyes hadn’t been so wet with tears, he might have noticed tiny red petals, in the shape of hearts, budding on a couple of the higher branches of the heartewoode tree.
“Seeing. Still working on rescuing,” Sam said, as he sent Redwing toward the burning barge.
“Kraken no dragon,” Hulk shouted.
“Sorry.” The young man smiled sheepishly as he gestured vaguely to the controls. “I was just looking for the flying feature. I thought it’d be ready by now, because you said a few short years, and it’s been three long ones.”
“I’ll take you to the beach. We’ll watch a game. And then we go to the fair.” It sounded so nice. He wanted to make it, if only for that one day with him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Assuming the arc reactor works.”
All night, every night, he’d traced the metal blades with his arm, closing his eyes as the red star burnt in his mind. That was how he slept, kept impossibly warm by a man who spent far too much time being cold.
The man ducks his head. “It’s James, now. Has been for a while.”
“Sorry, sorry, I really thought you knew. I mean, if you’d ever read a tabloid in your life, you’d know,” he said. “And anyway, I used to flirt with you something awful. I guess I thought you were just being nice about it. Letting me down easy.”
“James Buchanan Barnes,” Tony breathes. “In the flesh. Wow. Unless you’re, like, his secret lovechild? Seriously, I’m gonna need a helluva explanation for this. Steve is, too, once he starts breathing again. Oh, man, I gotta introduce you to my pal Rhodey, he
“Well,” Steve responds, the tiniest bit defensive, “I didn’t know this was an option five minutes ago, so I haven’t thought it through all the way. But – yeah.”
Clint claims the couch straight away, saying he’ll feel better if he can watch the door. Thor gets the single room, and Bruce takes the air mattress. Which leaves Tony and Steve.
“That’s a lie.”
Tony responds instinctively: “Sounds like something someone who was planning to kill me in my sleep would say.”
He hadn’t, Steve realizes. He’d heard what the news anchor had said and just…assumed. “I don’t have Twitter,” he says, which feels inadequate. “But I – should have. Read it. I’m sorry.”
Somewhere, distantly, someone wolf-whistled.
“Sure, yeah,” says Rhodey, and the three of them trail out. All the while, Tony’s eyes don’t leave Steve’s face. It’s unusual: Tony doesn’t like eye contact, really, and a lot of his conversations are conducted with him looking at a screen instead of at his conversational partner. This is another thing that had annoyed Steve at first, and then rapidly grown on him.
“I don’t,” Tony says.
“You aren’t, though,” Steve says quietly.
Tony blinks. “You only just realized—”
His body feels like it’s breaking out into starbursts of sensation, all of him crying out for Steve to touch him again. He can’t remember a kiss ever making him feel like this before. His chest rises and falls unsteadily.
Doreen wolf-whistled for the second time. Tony flipped her off, but he knew the effect was mitigated by the fact that he couldn’t figure out how to stop smiling.
By mid-afternoon on Saturday, Rhodey and Tony are sat cross-legged on the floor in front of the tower’s biggest TV. Clint and Nat are perched on each of the arms of the sofa behind them, watching, and Steve is on the armchair in the corner with a book open on his lap, pretending not to watch.
, I’m just saying it’s not
“Pretty sure I’ve been out of the closet since you were still in the ice, big guy,” Tony pointed out, and got the satisfaction of watching Steve’s mouth form a perfect ‘O’ of shock.
“We do that,” Tony replied automatically. Then his brain caught up with Steve’s words. “You’re kidding.”
Steve makes a disgruntled noise. “Can I not be
During the lull where the results of the race flash up onscreen, Rhodey reaches out, puts a hand on Tony’s knee and says: “Hey, I’m proud of you, man.”
Tony snorts his own laugh into Steve’s collarbone.
It was one of the grooms who broke the sudden silence.
sometimes.”
“Ultron doesn’t need to sleep,” Tony points out. “Being as how he’s a robot.”
“Be serious.”
“Please,” Tony says dismissively. “I just never got ‘round to it while I was dating Pepper, that’s all.”
“It’s been too long since we’ve had something like this,” Tony commented, glancing around at the congregated heroes. “Something to bring us all together that isn’t imminent world destruction, I mean.”
James’ smile is bashful. “Three years now. She proposed after your—thing in New York.”
James and Nat’s room is right beside theirs. Tony grins.
It’s not something he thinks he’s going to say until he’s saying it. Tony’s mouth drops open.
Tony grimaced, preferring not to think of what a failure the entire thing with the Cotati had been. Sure, he’d managed to redeem himself towards the end, but he couldn’t forget how blind he’d been, how it had been his arrogance that had gotten them into the entire mess.
Well, Steve can’t.
“Oh,” Steve said, a sound like the air had been punched out of him. “You…
“I don’t think you’re supposed to call them that,” Steve chided.
there was something I’d forgotten to do,” and hurries out of the room.
“Sorry,” Steve says. “I didn’t mean to call you a thing. Or to kiss you without asking. I just—”
“What?” Tony asks.
“Why’re you so goddamn tense, then?”
Steve makes another noise. Tony thinks it might be a sob, but when he chances a look Steve’s eyes aren’t wet.
He insinuated himself into Steve’s space, pulling his already loose bowtie out from under his collar and undoing another of his shirt’s buttons.
“No,” Tony mumbles, lips finding the exposed skin just beyond the neckline of Steve’s shirt. “Can’t all be supersoldiers. Tell me.”
The news program cuts back to the anchor, who seems to be talking to someone off-camera.
“James…” Steve says, like he’s learning the shape of it in his mouth.
“Seriously,” Steve says. “I’m mad with you. I don’t hate you. You never been in an argument before?”
They touch down in a field, so ‘middle-of-nowhere’ that Tony feels it in his bones, and Nat leads them all to a small stone cottage with ivy creeping up its walls. There are neatly kept rose bushes to either side of the front door, which is painted pale yellow. It’s like a house out of a fairy tale: creepy as hell.
“Congratulations again,” he said to the happy couple as he pulled Steve towards the nearest door. “Young love, always so beautiful. And such a wonderful ceremony.”
“I didn’t know,” Steve chokes out stupidly.
“It wasn’t your fault,” Steve said, as though reading his thoughts. He was always able to do that, getting under Tony’s skin without even trying.
“Seriously, stop apologizing,” Tony says. “In the list of shitty things straight people have said to me this past week, you’re not even in the top thousand. Don’t worry about it.”
“What if I don’t want to pretend you didn’t say anything?” Steve asked.
“Oh, I wouldn’t say I minded,” Teddy smirked.
Tony isn’t optimistic about his chances of getting to sleep, not with Ultron and the witch still out there. He starts to say so, but James cuts him off.
“No, I’m not saying it’s not
Tony shuts his eyes: automatic, defensive. “I don’t know,” he says. “Why don’t you tell
She doesn’t say anything, doesn’t bring him back around to her theory about how he feels about Tony. She just sits and strokes his shoulder, and eventually Steve’s hands stop shaking.
Steve rested his cheek on his hand, looking thoughtfully at Thor. “So, depending on whom you ask, it’s either Tony or Tyranaksthon,” he mused.
“Yeah. I’m fine,” Tony assured him, but his voice sounded hollow to his own ears.
He snapped the lid shut, carefully tucking the box in one of his drawers. That was all in the past. He had new jewellery for his new life now.
And where were Steve and Nat? Agent Hill said she’d sent them to assist Fury but they’d gone dark, making it impossible for her to confirm their involvement in a second shootout along the freeway. Had they been shot too?
“I wouldn’t have agreed, had this arrangement been to another monarch. But everyone agrees that this is a good match. And Anthony – this is what he wants.”
A masked man in the way of his speeding vehicle fired a disc grenade, which exploded, flipping Fury’s car. The car careened in the direction of the mysterious stranger, who calmly stepped aside at the last second, and then, it crashed onto the highway. The assassin made his way to the wreck, ripping the door in an impressive display of strength.
Tony heard a whizzing sound on his left, then his right. Ivan’s tail was sparking up and coming down upon him. Tony froze, rooted to the ground, but Steve kept moving, in a medley of forward rolls and dives, till he was in front of him, shield in hand to take the impact of the lash.
It had been at least ten years since the last time it glowed. Apparently, shielding him from Thanos’ attack had depleted the stone of its magic, but just as the Sorcerer Supreme had explained, the stone had slowly absorbed magic from its surroundings, and had begun glowing again recently as it regained its magical properties.
, Tony was locked and loaded and ready to blow.
Thankfully, he caught up with the quinjet just before they entered German airspace, quietly trailing behind. He was going as backup, happy to fade into the background if
“You know what?” he asked as he looked appraisingly at Obie with just the right amount of scorn “Scratch that. This is not a good plan”
He could still see the vivid images in his mind. The metal arm and the man who wore it, tragically beautiful and beautifully tragic.
Steve looked at him as though he’d lost his head. “Normally, I’d agree,” Steve said as he gripped his hand tightly. “But we’ve seen the damage these beasts can cause. There’s no other way out.”
“Yes,” he whispered, mouth dry. “How could you tell?”
my weakness,” Tony snapped, and struggled to his leaden feet. “But someone like you would never understand.”
Tony glared at the discs lined up on his table. They were either too heavy to throw easily or too light to cause any damage. The worst of all was how they vibrated when caught. He was taking his frustrations out on the twentieth prototype when he recalled Howard’s exciting discovery of an unknown metal during a trip to Africa. Tony hurried to his father’s office to acquire the coveted material, in a vial, still untouched, begging to be experimented on.
When he looked up, he noticed Steve staring at his cheek. “Hey - " he asked softly. "What happened to your face?”
“Please tell me you’re not talking about last night," Steve sighed, disbelieving. "You were drugged. I didn’t want our first time to be like that.”
The answer arrived in the form of a magpie tapping her beak against their window. Sam opened it to let her through, so it could deliver her message in a series of excited warbles.
“If that is what the Sorcerer says, then it must be.” For Steve had never known the man to be wrong.
“Last night,” Tony said. “Why? Am I the only one who did the reading?”
The stranger waved a hand weakly in front of him. “No. No hospital. I can’t.”
“In polite society, one normally telephones ahead before trespassing,” Jarvis said, with an amused but fond expression on his face.
“It’s for you,” Rhodey said, presenting him with a large box wrapped in paper. “Merry Christmas to my best boy.”
“I'll catch you,” he offered.
After Peter finally released him, whining and pouting the whole time, Rhodey brought Tony up to speed on recent developments, while being careful to avoid any mention of Tony’s subject of interest, all the way on the other side.
“No, she didn’t,” Steve choked. “What did you tell her?” he demanded when Tony laughed, cheering up at the sight of the king's embarrassment.
Shuffling about on his large feet, Tony soon found their little hut, where they'd once kept their fishing equipment and hunting gear. With it as a point of reference, he began to explore the surroundings, all the while keeping his eyes peeled for the will-o-the-wisps, or those little balls of glowing blue light that had beckoned him deep into the woods that fateful night.
Sorry this took so incredibly long! I don't know why but this chapter was soooooo hard to write! And even right now, I'm not 100% satisfied with it but I really don't know how to make it better. If you have any suggestions, please let me know! I'll be really interested to learn!
“Yes,
A satisfied smirk sat on Obie’s lips. “After all these years, you still haven’t found a way to embrace your full potential,” Obie gloated. “How disappointing. I was looking forward to a fair fight. Laugh all you want at my dragon name, but at least I’ve got one.”
with that stunning view, would be a good moment.
A match is made!
Steve laughed. “Surely, you must mean
“Steve!”
Tony shook his head ruefully. He didn’t remember sleeping at all.
It didn’t happen overnight. But little by little, some semblance of normalcy returned to their lives. The nightmares became less frequent and Tony felt like could almost breathe again.
“I’d like to - I'd like to - get to know you," Steve said. "I’m aware we didn’t get married under the most ideal circumstances.”
“Yeah, I know. I’m sorry. I just – needed to get some air,” Steve mumbled. “And time just slipped away.”
Steve and his friends try (nearly) everything they can to revive Tony.
But gold-titanium alloy had magnetic properties, so if could find a way to get his gauntlet to attach magnetically to the bracelets, and the other bits to attach to the gauntlet, it could make suiting up a breeze, or a hurricane, because he needed it to be very, very fast.
Steve and Nat were going after Loki on their own?
“Nobody knows how to be a parent, Tony. Your dad and I pieced it together as we went along. But you will figure it out because you are incredible. And also a genius.”
The young man ran a hand through his hair to smooth it into a more presentable state as spots of pink appeared on his cheeks. “Thank you.”
Tony looked surprised. “Am I now?” he asked.
At the sound of a throat being cleared, he looked up to find Prince Anthony staring down at him. There was a bright smile on his face, but the wet lashes and the hastily-brushed tear tracks on his cheeks did not go unnoticed. “Greetings, your majesty. For years, I've longed to meet you in person. I've heard so much about you - The Super Warrior, Living Legend, Symbol to the Kingdom, Hero to the World,” Tony recited, pausing to take a quick breath. “Forever may you reign.”
“I mean- what else was on my profile?”
Tony nodded, eyes still on the bracelets circling his wrists, a thank-you-for-not-dying-because-I-really-love-my-job gift from Pepper.
“Disabling the encryption is an executive order. It takes two alpha-level members,” he reminded them with a smug smile.
Strange was saying something else to him but Steve’s head was already spinning with the empty words that were swirling around him, none of which made any sense.
With more time on his hands, Steve had finally finished his little project, which he now kept in a nondescript wooden box. As far as gifts were concerned, it was unremarkable, very modest compared to the wondrous gifts the crown prince must have received over the years, but there was more to it than met the eye. It had taken years of trial and error, but art and science had come together and enabled him to create the perfect gift for a perfect husband. He would have presented it to him too, if not for the fact that Tony was hardly home.
“Um,” Steve responds, “well. We were poor.”
Tony’s cheeks heated. “Sure,” he managed to get out. Steve just kept
“You died.” Steve’s words shake their way out. Tony wonders whether it’s more rude to stay or leave.
Tony’s mouth, which had only just managed to fully close, stutters open again.
“I can’t believe my wedding was so flaming that it turned Captain America gay,” said Billy Kaplan.
“You don’t get what I’m saying at all, do you?”
Steve kisses him again, half-smiling as he does. Tony manages to contribute, this time, to get their mouths open and Steve’s breath mingling with his. He tucks a hand underneath Steve’s sleepshirt, shamelessly angling for more.
Steve kisses him again, because as much as he likes hearing Tony talk, he thinks he might like this even better.
Finally, they were alone.
Clint had to agree. “We
“They’ve cracked,” Jarvis observed, frowning at the liquid oozing out of the cracks. “Must have been rotten,” he hypothesised.
“Yes,” Steve said, as he took his hand and laced his fingers through his.
After all the progress they'd made, Tony couldn’t help but feel disappointed when Steve wished him good night and left him outside his bedroom door. So, as he watched his husband retreating to his bedroom, he called.
Above them, the crows circled and cawed, but Tony could make out the distinct croaking of a raven, one which landed on the back of Sam’s hand. There was a moment of silence when Sam and the bird shared a look. Then, just as swiftly as it came, it was off and soaring for the skies.
It was particularly hard to watch his mother's final moments. He couldn't breathe as he watched her terrifying struggle with the flesh hand around her neck, squeezing. He’d had his doubts then, seeing the purple marks on her powdered neck.
Tony had had enough darkness for a lifetime. He went in pursuit of the light, not the sun, not even the moon or the stars. He'd be grateful for just a lamp to light his way.
Steve felt his face getting warm. “I’ll put it on the list,” he mumbled.
The war was over, and while that was something to celebrate, the dwindling demand for arms meant that the Starks had to find ways to boost their economy. If they could get a farming community thriving in the midlands, they could also build a new castle to support it, and that would create new jobs for their people.
“It’s not like they put letters by the sides of these things, you know?” Rhodey fired back before disappearing to assist Thor.
“Leave. Him. Alone,” Steve growled, as he struck the emperor a total of three times, all the while looking ferocious, as his blue eyes burned with murderous rage.
“Tony?” he heard a voice calling from him outside the door.
“Yeah, sure,” Tony answered mechanically, applying his skill of smiling-while-not-giving-a-fuck as Steve rattled off movie choices for their outing the next day.
“A list?” Tony asked, as his eyes grew wide. “Of all the things you like about me?”
Steve gave him a long look. “Are you really?” he asked.
He loved him. Of course, he did. In the midst of hurt and disappointment, there had been love. And pride. Oh God. He’d loved him. And Tony, blinded by all his insecurities, had never seen it. Till it was too late.
“And also, not my type at all,” he quickly added, attuned to the signs of jealous alpha. “Honestly it would be so weird, you know? I - only go for big, blond and beautiful,” he reassured, focusing fully on Steve, with the weapon safely out of reach of inquisitive alphas.
Tony forced himself to tear his eyes away from the mesmerising sight of Steve leaping off platforms and grappling bars in an impressive display of gymnastics. He had a job to do. He really needed to impress Steve.
“I will miss you, Tony,” Steve agreed, and tightened his grip on Tony’s hand at the sight of Strange beckoning Tony over.
Thanos shrugged. “As they have tried to end me.”
The stones glowed brightly before bursting into fire, and their rainbow beams flashed across the ceiling like auroras against the evening sky.
“All right,” Tony agreed, somewhat chilled by the icy greeting but nonetheless relieved to have something to talk about, as Steve sat down beside him, facing the creek.
“Right. Hay,” he chuckled. “Great plan, but a little on the dishonest side.”
It went in.
“Are we going home?”
So, he did.
? Because if it’s all the same to you, I’d rather have the truth.”
And then Steve’s laughing, shoulders shaking with it.
“Oh,” Tony laughs quietly, “I am. I want to invent time travel so I can go back to my fourteen-year-old self and tell him to be careful what he wishes for.”
“You,” he says. “Jesus, Steve, what the hell are you doing to me?”
Tony clears his throat. “You’ve got plenty of time to figure it out.”
There are a few responses Tony considers to that. Some of them he dismisses as too revealing, others as too crude.
“I guess they’ve changed quite a bit anyway,” Tony says, shrugging. “Hey, it’ll be easier if I just take this one apart a little and show you.”
“HYDRA,” she says.
“Seems like the sort of fella I’d get on with,” he says.
Tony mouths at Steve. Steve shrugs.
“It’s fine,” Tony says. “I guess you didn’t read the tweet.”
“Did we forget to teach him about bisexuality?” Tony asks the room at large, setting down his controller. “Okay, fine, that’s on us. Um. Steve. I can probably get you a pamphlet?”
“Oh, it was just,” Tony says, “something like, ‘calling me a womanizer fails to take into account that I was just in a committed relationship for two years, and that I also like men’.”
“We need a longshot,” Tony points out. “It’s not like we’ve got anything else in our corner.”
Tony laughed carelessly. “I don’t think I need the straightest man on Earth to call me out on homophobia, Cap.”
When Steve pulls away, Tony begins to regain the ability to think clearly.
“Bucky,” Steve says, voice choked.
“Oh.” It feels obvious, now, but Steve had just thought that there were only two ways to be, and that depending on who you ended up with you were one or the other. He’s gotten a lot of things wrong since waking up from the ice, but he’s never felt quite so naïve. “Sorry.”
He holds out his left hand for James to shake. The man looks at him quizzically for a few seconds more, and then Tony’s shaking the metal hand and he’s in heaven, basically. James lets him hang on for about twice the length of a regular handshake before he gently extricates himself and turns to Steve, wariness written clear on his face.
Tony nodded slowly. “Promise that you won’t be mad,” he said in a small voice.
“I could say the same about yours,” Tony pointed out.
Over the years, the stonemasons of Anguisia had employed arcane arts and sorcery to liquefy vast quantities of blackstone in construction of the castle, which stood proudly on top of an active volcano. Inside the volcano, liquid fire bubbled around secret stairs and shafts that led to the mountain’s heart, where it was said that only a real dragon could pass unscathed.
“About a minute, thereabouts. It'll take longer for you to regain your strength. But you also are a super-soldier, so I’d give it ten minutes, tops.”
An exhausted Steve was swaying from side to side and Tony rushed to catch him right before he fell off the stack. Steve landed on Tony's back and placed his arms around Tony as Tony glided down towards the beach, finally landing beside the entrance of Tyrant’s Cave.
“They were,” Jarvis admitted, turning the stove off.
Tony pushed a plate towards Steve. “Hi,” he said. “How are we feeling?”
He lost track of time, and his ears rang with animated chatter and joyful laughter, so much that he barely noticed when one by one, his guests began trickling out of the bedroom, leaving just Tony and him behind.
“You look amazing,” Steve offered generously, in an attempt to ease his nerves. “Ready to go?”
All he seemed to do after his body betrayed him was to disappoint his dad. Tony let out a sigh, resigned to his fate. If he couldn’t be the son Howard desired, he was at least giving him a son-in-law to be proud of.
So, the last chapter ended with a lot of screaming and panicking! I just wanted to assure everyone that all will be okay even though it may take a bit more time (there are only two more chapters to go so it can't take much more time).
Steve laughed at that. “People are obliged to love their king.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now, now, Tony,” Obie cut in. "Ten years is a long time to bear a grudge. You know he was just trying to heal those poor kids.”
“Marry me,” he shouted after Nat who was already riding away, spear in hand.
“Yes. Because you’re a mechanic, Tony. I know who you are," Steve said, yawning, as he turned on his side to go back to sleep.
Tony panicked, instantly reaching out for it. “Don’t. Okay. Yes, it is his gauntlet. Don’t. Don’t hit that. Steve. Give it to me. Please,” he pleaded, trying to snatch it back from the taller man, who held it just out of reach.
“Just Mr. Stark. I’d like to keep it that way. I’ve got family. Need to keep them safe,” he answered, impressed with his ability to keep a secret without needing to lie. The suit had a great poker face.
“He’s old-fashioned," Tony explained. "Said he wanted to take things slow.”
“To take you to our basement. You’re not the only one with secrets, he said, showing Tony the key in his hand.
“Steve, we don’t have to do it right now. If you need more time – ”
Pietro moved fast, but Steve was closer, so it was Steve who came between Thanos and Wanda, as Thanos raised his arms.
And more than occasionally, he got Tony little gifts that showed how much he listened and cared.
Tony paused, sitting back on his heels. “Would it have made a difference?” he asked, “if I had told you?”
“You were saying?” Tony asked, shouting over the noise of the spinning rotors.
Over eggs and toast, Jarvis listened patiently as Tony, back to his characteristic hyperverbal self, launched into a ten-minute tirade about Steve, his outdated beliefs, illogical arguments and hypocritical ways.
Happy was taking him back to the tower, mid-morning, to pick up some things. He hadn’t thought of packing them, in his hurry to leave Steve and his pain behind. But, they were important and indispensable. And he needed them as soon as possible.
It was time for Tony to run his.
When Thanos retreated to Dragonrocke in Onyx Bay, the ancestral castle of the Eisenhardts, his horde of dragons had followed, and it left Symkaria and Attilan largely undefended, which gave Kings Stephan and Black Bolt the opportunity to drive out the invaders.
“Marry me,” Tony said, and the words were out of his mouth before he could take them back.
“They’re not ours,” Tony roared, getting a bad feeling about this.
Steve looked fragile, like he was about to break. Or maybe he was already broken, his sharp edges showing. Whatever it was, he needed to be handled with care.
He opened a folder named
“Thanks, Hawk. What else have we got?”
“Hulk no kissy you,” he snorted.
“It will be better,” Thanos said.
“Iron Man, you got a lot of strings sticking to your tail,” came Hawkeye’s voice in his ear. “Find a tight corner,” he instructed.
He traced the scars forming on his chest and the one at the side of his neck, his head and heart heavy with the thought of Steve, miles away. Each time he reached out through the bond, it was flooded with waves of love and longing and increasing levels of distress. So much distress on Steve’s side of the bond.
Thank you for reading my story! I'm hoping to update every 5-7 days. Let me know what you think!
“Dad and Mom, mostly. I'm supposed to do other things - cooking, cleaning sorts of things.”
Tony reached for the claws, and tried desperately to prise them off. The world spun around him as his throat and lungs burned. Hot tears welled up in his eyes as the edges of his vision went black, and all he could hear was the emperor’s voice.
“Your majesty,” he told her, his voice full of sympathy. “At this stage, only Tony has the power to save himself.”
Bruce made a soft, scoffing sound. “Thought you and Tony were still staring at each other’s eyes,” he teased.
Tony suited up with a quick tap, hurrying to Steve’s side. They switched around, alternating attack and defence as they teamed up on Killian. But regardless of what they did, Killian just wouldn’t die. Or quit.
Before Nat could respond, sirens began blaring. The helicarrier had been hit.
As the transformation was underway, Tony felt for the blade in his pocket, never taking his eyes off his target as he waited for the right moment. When it came, Tony pulled it out and stabbed the skin under Obie’s neck, shredding it.
“Your majesty,” he said cordially, trying his best not to panic when he discovered himself alone in his hour of need, now that his traitorous friends having deserted him in a hurry.
“It’s true. You saw me. Some random man pays me a little attention and I let him have his wicked way with me.”
“Steve,” he shouted, and the Winter Soldier froze at the sound of the name. Tony took advantage of his hesitation to drag Steve towards relative safety.
“Shut up,” he cried, punching the same eye again.
“Thank you,” Steve said, going for that tiny grey area between confidence and modesty. “You must know that the accounts of battles are often embellished.”
The members of the World Security Council looked uneasily, at each other, then at Pierce. While Steve’s speech drew loyal agents to their cause, it also alerted the enemy of their plans.
had it under control.
So, when Ana remarked that the grass always looked greener on the other side, he argued that it was greenest where it’s been watered, weeded and allowed to thrive. From the looks of approval sent his way, he knew then that he’d read the signs and read them right.
He needed to tell Steve. Not about Iron Man, no, not that, of course. But that he loved him.
But Rhodes already had his arms around Tony. And Peter too.
Tony reached for his arm and Steve flinched, pulling away. “Steve,” he said, his eyes filling with hurt. “I’m sorry. I wanted to tell you. But one thing just led to the next.”
“It was very brave – what you’ve done,” Steve said, truly impressed by their accomplishments over the last few days.
“It’s too hard, Ana,” he sighed, feeling helpless and sorry for himself. “It’s a stalemate. And I’ve got no more moves.”
In the comfort of his own bed, Steve pieced together the fragmented memories from the previous night: Tony’s warm arms around him, and the tearful exchange of words. There could have been a kiss, but he wasn’t sure. Then, there was the soft bed beneath him and the embrace of thick, wool blankets.
. He was on a roll that day. He really had a talent for ruining things with the things he said. Or didn't.
Sam sat down beside him. “The potion amplifies everything that is inside. Good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. Even without the potion, you’d still be somewhere between – amazing and incredible.”
They found themselves standing in a circle, way out of their league, watching the alien invasion descend in waves.
“Wow. I think you should lead with that next time,” Rhodey commented.
Steve looked as though he was about to insult the emperor, so Tony beat him to it. “We’ve seen the gods,” Tony said, and thought of the venerable Thor and his spectacular storms. “And Chinny McChinface is nothing like them.”
“That's an awful lot of work to find a mate,” Steve remarked, breaking the silence.
“Yes,” Steve said, offering the dragon a small smile. “It’s me. I’m just here with tea,” he explained, holding up the picnic basket.
She frowned. “How? How will it be better,” she demanded, “when
“Hold on, hold on. That’s enough,” Tony warned, and took the inhaler back from the other man, who released his grip on the apparutus as he leaned back in his seat.
“How’s she doing?” Steve asked, once they’d landed on the beach.
"I’m a visionary. But I'm nice. I’ll show you what you came for. Real generous of our friends at SHIELD to let us keep him, even if it’s only for a few days,” he said as he rolled three metallic balls on the ground between them.
“You know, if you ask Kirsten out from Statistics, she’d say yes,” Tony remarked.
Steve paused for a moment to catch his breath. “Sword shall be broken, shield shall be splintered. It will be the hardest fight of our lives. For some, our very last. Freedom comes at the price of blood, one I am willing to pay – and I know I can’t be the only one.”
“Any idea how this all ends?” he asked, still worried about Steve.
“Who else knows about your wife?”
“Careful there, my king. Don’t start something you can’t finish.”
,” Banner informed them, and Tony had to stop himself from squealing at the change in Bruce's voice.
“It had your picture, information about your favourite films, music, food…”
“He’s not alone,” Sam corrected, as they watched Tony climbing onto Redwing’s back.
The dread in the pit of Tony’s stomach spread to his limbs, leaving him paralysed. Tears of frustration filled his eyes as he regretted leaving the relative safety of the ballroom for the rooftop.
“For years, your people have forged our freedom in the fires of war. Armestria will no longer watch from the shadows. Together, we will rise and face the monster that shrouds us in darkness. You have our weaponry. You have our cavalry. And, soon, you’ll have the best of us. Anthony, he’s...”
“One who means to battle a basilisk may use reflective surfaces to avoid petrification,” Tony added, drawing his sword. “Which include the blade of a sword, the back of a shield, or even a puddle of water.”
Sniffing the air, Tony followed the trail of fresh air to find his way out. It was no mean feat, but good luck and an excellent nose put him on the right series of paths. Tony could see brief flashes of lightning from the threatening skies, so he knew he was getting close.
Obie roared as drops of blood scattered on the ground, almost causing him to slip as he chased Tony into the cave, only to find himself getting stuck again when his half-shrunk wings got caught at a narrow point.
Then, he freed Steve from his bonds and helped him to an empty spot on the ground.
. He picked up a tape measure and some clamps from
Perhaps, a different poem was written in draconic. The Anguisians would tell of a dragon who lived in peace before the men arrived, clad in cool metal, with cold eyes and colder blades, to pilfer their gems and gold and magic.
. They were making good process on the whole, although once in a while, some members, the semi-stable seventy-five-year-old ones, tended to regress.
For a few moments, they just gazed at each other, reluctant to shatter the blessed silence. Then, Tony took his hand and led Steve to bed, ignoring his protests as he lay Steve down and pulled the covers over his exhausted body.
Tony turned to the horses. “Why the long face? Don’t want to pull the carriage?” The horse he was talking to let out a soft whinny, to which Tony responded, “Neigh? Right, I’ll tell the king.” He turned to Steve. “Did you hear that? Nay. Straight from the horse’s mouth.”
The visible parts of Steve’s face were pleasantly pink, Tony noticed. It made him want to—well.
“You seriously just came out to me to win an argument.” He shook his head, grinning. “You’re just so
He wants to say something, to congratulate Tony in some way, but every time he thinks he’s figured out what he wants to say he ends up backing down at the last moment and asking Tony to explain how refrigerators work instead.
“Her name’s Alpine,” James says. “She doesn’t normally like strangers.”
“Okay,” he says, and hopes that his face at least looks normal.
Tony raises an eyebrow. “I thought they had refrigerators in the 40s,” he says.
something true so we can balance the scales?”
“So how are you expecting to be able to disable him remotely?” Steve asks. “I may not know much about tech, ‘specially not the kind of tech you’re used to, but that seems like a longshot to me.”
Nat casts a glance back at him. Her brow is a little pinched, but otherwise she’s as unflappable as ever. The jet is disconcertingly quiet: Bruce is huddled in the corner, sweat beaded across his brow; Steve is staring down at his shield, expression shuttered; Tony, for his part, can’t seem to stop tracing the scarring from where the reactor used to be.
