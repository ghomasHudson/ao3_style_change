Shit! You're sucking my cock like a champ.
“Good idea,” Steve agreed from the front of Quinjet. “I'll try to talk to her before we even get to the Compound.”
she thought with a smile. Clint was like a brother. Annoying most of the time, but she loved him too much.
Tony nodded. “Yes.”
Tony swallowed. Of course, it had been his idea. He knew Steve didn’t like big events, especially when he was the reason. Even if the big event in question was his funeral. Tony knew what Steve would have preferred; what Steve would have liked. Also, and that was something Tony would never admit out loud, Tony wanted to say goodbye to Steve
“Sam doesn’t know how to play,” Natasha shrugged. “And the three kids there prefer video game. So yes. It's just the four of us.”
"You look tired, darling," Tony remarked. Steve had his eyes downcast and two dark circles were beginning to emerge beneath them.
busy right now, okay? Tell him I'll talk to him later.”
Rogers," the Chief emphasized Steve's title wryly. The Chief looked quickly at Tony. "And I see that you took my advice to bring a lawyer," Steve saw that Tony had smiled a petulant smile and held his own urge to laugh. "And not just any lawyer. The
Tony couldn’t say no to the Captain when he asked for something. Then, knowing that this would be his biggest mistake, Tony stopped and thought that his heart was already too bruised, too numb, and that one more blow would make no difference. So, he waited.
wanted to. It never crossed my mind that some magic ingredient could be part of this equation, and that in the end, you’d get intoxicated by a magical flower.” Steve didn't look Tony in the eye. His gaze was fixed on the hands resting on his lap.
, Tony?” Steve’s gaze was all over Tony, enveloping him, trapping Tony much more efficiently than his hands. It was hypnotic and Tony suspected that that look had some kind of supernatural power over him, because Tony started to feel things that he hadn’t felt for a long, long time. Things he thought he couldn’t even feel anymore. But apparently the evidence that they still existed was still around.
"Even if someone,
"You're great in a lot of things.”
“Thank you, Stevie-pie. You know how to make my day better.”
Steve smiled back at him. “You, and you only.”
Tony couldn't help the smile that spread across his face. "Sure, Steve."
"Have a good trip, Stark," Thor said with a wave.
Tony chuckled.
“God, I was thinking for about...”
“You like this way?” Steve asked in Tony's ear when he turned his fist and rubbed both heads together at the same time.
“I just wanted to let you know that I was going to reach you,” Steve continued, speaking into the night. If someone passed by there, they could find two things from that scene: Steve was crazy or he was Romeo swearing to Juliet by the moon. Tony tried to laugh at his own ridiculous joke, but only managed to sob. Steve was going to try to talk to him. He was. Tony tried to blink to get the tears out of his eyes. He wanted to see Steve, in addition to just hearing him. “But, you know, Tony, everything has been so crazy since I … well, since I
Tony shrugged. "Any hotel with a good bed that is close to here will be fine."
"No delay, sir." Pierre nodded.
having
But Tony always knew that he should have been there.
“Once. And it was enough for me not to want to repeat the experience.”
“Okay, Mr. Obvious. Let's get down,” Sam grabbed Clint from under his arms and disappeared into the hoistway.
“So what’s the result?” Steve asked.
. So we lived as long and best as we could, and we tried to do everything so that Peter was supported when she was gone."
"If you don't mind," Steve broke the silence. "I'm going outside to finish cleaning that awful thing and then I'm going to take a shower. It must be enough time for the ratatouille to be ready for lunch."
As soon as Tony got out of the elevator, the smell of pizza took over all his senses and his stomach growled.
didn’t know that.” Steve looked Tony in the eye and raised an eyebrow. You didn’t have to be an out-of-memory billionaire genius to understand what that meant. Tony’s heart raced.
“It's a hydra.”
Steve took a step and only a handful of air separated them. He bowed possessively and rested his hands on either side of Tony's head on the elevator wall. Tony's fingers came alive and hooked into the elastic of Steve's shorts, which inspired sharply.
"Don't tell me you're the same Steve Rogers who signed the print that is hanging in my office in my apartment, back in New York!" Steve shrugged. "Okay, I won't say it."
" Liz said bitterly and with anger. “And they're
“No need to ask twice,” the engineer approached the weapon's control panel and his fingers instinctively flew across the keyboard, searching for loopholes in the system.
Tony punched the marble from the kitchen island and stood up, rubbing his face, frustrated, irritated, hurt by the injustice that was all that. He walked in circles and ended up facing Steve again, with open arms, gesticulating like a crazy man. “All I have are second-hand memories and second-hand feelings from the most important moment in our lives to date. It doesn’t seem fair that I have a hole where painful memories should be,” Tony found himself shouting, but he didn’t care. He had been holding on since he got in that apartment. “I should learn lessons from these memories, it was all a mistake,
"Let's start with things friendly, huh?" Tony remarked.
Tony composed himself enough to smile crookedly. "Our names look great together."
“And why not?”
“Steve?” He called, running his fingers through the soldier's hair.
"Take a cold shower before the pizza arrives," Tony shouted over his shoulder, not turning around.
"Did it simply materialize out of nowhere?" Natasha asked.
“Who says that?” Peter asked.
Everyone moved.
"Aw, Nat, you know me
Steve covered his face with his hand, trying to ignore Wanda's amused look beneath him.
He watched Steve closely and saw the soldier frown.
“Really?” Steve leaned over the island towards Tony and he had a curious expression on his face.
"Once again, Captain," the demigod shook Steve's hand. "My apologies for the chaos my uncle caused. I hope to find you in friendlier situations.”
"Good night, Tony," Steve walked away and headed for the kitchen entrance, where he stopped and turned around. "Have good dreams.”
Forcing his legs to move, Tony turned towards the bed behind them, with Steve still in his arms, and guided him there. One, two, three steps and they stopped. Tony disengaged himself from Steve’s arms and mouth enough to push him toward the mattress. Steve fell on his back, offering no resistance, and crawled on his elbows until he reached the head of the bed, where he leaned, laughing.
“For sure.” Steve smiled, squeezing Tony’s hand.
"But it's Independence Day." She frowned, not understanding.
"Peter is not a child, Steve," Tony commented. "He's probably heard worse.”
“Come on, Steve. We don’t have anything else to do here.”
if you say so.” He untangled himself from Steve, got to his knees with difficulty, and staggered until he reached the table where the box was. Stretching all over, he took the box in his hands. He put it by his side and took a final look at Steve, just to be sure he wasn't hallucinating this time. Steve nodded. Taking a deep breath, Tony opened the box, and took the flower in his hands. He turned back to Steve and put the red lily on the floor between them.
“I wanted to know if the team has been going right for you.”
The flush heats up Steve’s cheeks. “Uh, sorry to interrupt. Were you on a call with your family?”
Steve’s eyes stung when he huffed. “I’m stubborn, and old-fashioned,” Steve quoted back at her. “It’s my way or the highway, and nothing gets through my head if I don’t want it to.”
He couldn’t handle this after all, he thought in a distant panic. It'd been a long time since he'd wished to be put back into the ice, but the idea of never getting the chance to yell at Tony for scaring him so much was enough.
There wasn't any reason to fault him for it. This Steve Rogers was young. There will be so many people for him in his future – Sharon will mean something more, much more than his initial half-delusional fumbling soon, and Rachel, and Bernie, and Connie (
“Ma,” Steve said, and his voice broke. He glanced down, blinking hard, breathing heavily by now. She shushed him.
“Would you commit to that?” Steve asked. His heart was racing, but deep down, a part of him knew. There was a calmness within him, that feeling that never wavered, whether it was standing up to Thanos, or Galactus, or Kang, or even more importantly, making a leap he should have done years ago. “Making sure everyone else loses to me?”
“Really now,” Tony said finally, and his thumb rubbed against the rim of Steve’s ear, his other hand on Steve’s chest. “You're so clingy today. Are you sure you can’t get drunk?”
They both jumped back like springs. From the panic in Steve's expression, it was due time to mutually agree on pretending that never happened.
dazed by time travel.
The rest of them watched him in silence. Once, Steve would have scowled at the attention or snapped, but he found little in him to care about the scrutiny.
Tony took a step back, turning. The daylight shining through the mansion's kitchen windows illuminated Steve's profile, making him glow. Tony had lived like this for years, but there was still times like this when Tony could watch Steve safely, wiping at a spill in their shared kitchen with loose-fitting clothes and mussed hair. It was these moments that'd catch Tony off-guard.
“Fine, fine!”
Steve was watching him, and Tony decided to hum in approval. The noise made Steve blush, a grin working at the side of his mouth.
Rogers was smiling shyly at him, like he was proud of Steve. How could Steve tell him he shouldn't be? How could he explain the rift that'd grown between him and Tony? It would take years for his counterpart to understand. Steve didn't know if he wanted him to understand. Back then, any disagreement was quickly smoothed over, and Steve had clung to that memory so many times.
He reaches Tony’s bedroom and carefully removes his shoes before tucking Tony in. Steve lets the rattle in his throat out for once, and the breathy rasp is too loud in the darkness. He jerks out of his trance and stands up.
Then the impossible happened. Rogers was aiming the stunner in the downed Hydra's directions, and the next he doubled over, clutching his shoulder. It was the same shoulder Steve had shot earlier, except this time he'd been hit with an actual bullet.
“Don't kiss your opponent, Tony,” Steve finally said.
“Would you look at that? I guess it's not just for paintings after all.” Tony took a step back, straightening his shirt and smoothing out the creases. His lips tingled, oversensitive.
He’d been here dozens of times before, memorized every framed photo and most of the ones in the photo albums. But again, it was like he was a stranger in here, as Gail tutted around, preparing coffee. Steve didn’t have the heart to tell her that not even months of being married to Tony Stark had made the taste any more palatable.
“Well, I’m glad we’re both finally back in one piece, in one place. God knows we both need some semblance of stability if we’re going to keep kicking alien ass.”
“It’s fine, Steve. We’re Avengers. Making fun of our near-death experiences is part of the job description.”
The door slammed shut before Steve and Tony had a chance to respond.
“Okay!” Tony rolls back his shoulders. “FRIDAY, open the garage up and get our engine started.”
After a moment, Tony licked his lips before offering a smile in return. He lifted his elbow up, and Steve curled his fingers further around his arm.
“You two have been through a lot.
A bright light lit up the entire street, even in the daylight, and the back of Steve's neck burned at the heat of the beam. When the rumbling was gone, the wailing was even louder. Steve shot up, looking at the collapsed building.
Rogers didn't turn his head, acknowledging Steve with a small nod. Then he bound off and jump-kicked a Hydra agent in the face.
The arc reactor in the palm of Steve’s hand might be heavier than the weight on his shoulders after failing the universe. It’s a cruel comparison, but there’s a wall erected in his mind, circling around the facts of the matter. Thanos won, Thanos used the Stones, and half of the universe was snapped out of existence. Steve hasn’t even scaled the mental barrier of waking up in the future yet. He doesn’t know how long it’ll take to accept this.
Steve finally tore himself from the man's eyes, looked down, and found himself facing a familiar large, white star inset in red and blue circular stripes.
“Superheroes,” she said. “Right? It's a dangerous job. But it's only because of it that you were able to come here to...our world.”
Steve blinked, tilting his head, assessing, before nodding slowly.
“There's a few of us. A representative, from the most powerful countries or groups.”
“This little change isn’t natural. You'll…meet your fair share of villains,” Steve finally offered in explanation, which didn't seem to placate Rogers. “Speaking of which, stunts like what you just pulled would get you killed. You should already know you'll never get away with any hesitation in a fight, no matter what they look like.”
“Steve?” she said. By now, most of the onlookers had lost interest as the light turned green. She didn't follow them walking over to them slowly. “Steven Rogers, is that you?”
Gail looked at him then, and her face softened. “I’m so sorry, Steve. To have that sprung on you, after just getting married—”
They fell into the kiss, two, three, and Steve lost count as he ran a hand through Tony's hair, slid his fingers across his neck and over his shoulders. They parted for half-breaths, and Steve's lust cooled from an uncontrollable blaze to its coals, an endless source that could burn, untouched, forever. Tony made soft noises into the kiss, and he went when Steve pushed and rolled them over, not breaking their kiss. He pressed down against Tony, and felt Tony hard against him, and it was being buried in high tide, the heat that ran over every inch of him.
“We didn’t make vows—”
“Redwing’s my
There was an uneasy flutter in her stomach when she rested her mouth on her fist. She liked to think that she was one of the few people Steve and Tony could confide in. But they'd made it clear that whatever was going on, they didn't want to talk. And okay, Carol could understand that urge, the desire to be left alone and be free from other people's sympathy or worse, pity, but it stung a bit being on the other end of that.
He didn't even try to deny what he'd been doing, too scared of the possibility of angering Captain America more than he wanted that fat paycheck.
“There's a reason I'm support nowadays,” Steve said, clipping an agent in the head. “I'm not meant for ground combat like this. And neither are you.
So far, Tony had an admittedly awkward peck on the cheek with Sam and a chaste kiss from Maria, although he prided in being humored by her.
“Sorry, I didn't...know there'd be so much,” Steve mumbled. He wiped his chin, where come was still dribbling. Jesus, he'd marked Steve Rogers like that.
“Tony.” Steve’s head dropped down, and he took hold of Tony’s hand, letting it droop between his fingers.
“I've been thinking,” Steve said, as they both watched them. “And, well, after talking it over with Sue. It's because of you.”
“You’d rather live alone, then?”
It’s late when Steve comes into the conference room now and closes the door quietly behind him.
“Hey,” Tony said, and Steve looked up from his files.
Steve could have brushed it off just like Tony, and no one would be none the wiser. Except Tony, who was astutely avoiding Steve’s eyes.
“Thanks, Cap. You really saved me there.” At the call of his name, Steve snapped his eyes up. He wondered if Tony was mocking him, but it wasn’t him who should be embarrassed. It was Tony, wasn’t it, caught vomiting and in a rat hole in his penthouse worth millions.
“He's done it before,” Steve blurted. “He looks out for me.”
“Be proper, they're holiday parties now. And why not? You live here now, why not break the place in a bit?” Tony waved his hand at Steve's office, which hadn't changed from the initial floor plan, months after the Avengers had moved into the complex upstate.
Every kiss, every second. Tony let him do it, and what a privilege, for Tony Stark to deem you worthy of his attention. With Tony, every moment was the present. It was an idea Steve could get used to.
“I’m returning the stones,” Steve finally says. His voice is quieter than Tony’s used to. “Just like Bruce said we had to after undoing the Snap.”
“When did that start?” Rhodey continued, and the more he spoke, the further his smile drooped. “
“You wouldn’t do that,” Steve says. “You’ve done so much for us already, you can do something for yourself.”
Tony inhaled sharply, and then Steve saw them.
He followed Steve's eyes to an older woman waiting for the crosswalk. She was in her fifties or a graceful sixty, with her blonde hair greying at the temples. She paused to look over at them, gaze alert and curious. Tony could have sworn he'd seen her somewhere, or someone very close to her. She had eyes that stuck with you.
Steve glanced at the clock, and the minute hand hadn't moved since the last time he checked. He huffed, jiggling his leg. He was lounging around the living room, which had increasingly become his evening leisure activity. Tony had a state of the art entertainment system, but Steve had rebuffed suggestions to watch his television in the theater, or watch shows in the privacy of his room. It had nothing to do with the clear line of sight of the elevator.
And. I. Don’t. Remember.” Tony covered his face with his hands and tried to take a deep breath, but the air just didn’t find the right way for his lungs. He felt his hands heat up and get wet.
Steve laughed through his nose, but tried to hide it. “I saw your footprints in the snow.”
Tony snorted, but said nothing more.
"Falcon, Spider-Man, have civilians been evacuated?" Steve asked.
Tony opened his eyes, but he had to blink a few times to make sure he was really wide-eyed because there was no light around. He moved and immediately smiled when he felt his body awake and realized that his legs were curled into other legs, that he was protected inside strong arms and that the heat he felt came from no blanket because he was completely naked, but of the other body to which he was glued. Steve's body, sleeping soundly beside him.
"You could at least take it seriously."
“Good idea.”
"Eleven in the morning, boss.”
Tony’s brain was in trouble. Almost a total collapse. He, the self-proclaimed futurist, the one who was always prepared for any situation, the one who foresaw the Registration Act, who foresaw the Civil War, was now a man stuck in what he once was, wishing to have memories of the past, instead of continuing yearning for the future. How did that happen? When did Steve become the person who thinks about today, who is optimistic about the future, instead of mourning what he might have had if he still lived in the 1940s? When had
“Take what you want,” Steve said, holding the hem of his shirt. “It’s all yours.”
“Yeah, something has changed, yes,” Tony said, his voice distracted, as he watched his fingers fade and appear through the golden strands of Steve’s hair.
busy, but not with what Steve or anyone else up there could think of. Tony's mind was filled with the conversation he had heard.
Steve shrugged. “You’re the one to blame here, babe. It was you who brought me back to the bed and held me here.”
Steve took a deep breath. “I can't do what you asked me because it'd be wrong. You were poisoned by that thing and now you're obsessed with the idea that we need to ...
Tony pulled away as best he could to not wake Steve, propped himself up on his elbow and stood there, just admiring the calm Steve slept with, his eyes still, indicating that he wasn’t dreaming - or, worse, having nightmares - his golden hair spiky on all sides, messed up in a way that people out there would never see (and that made Tony feel a sense of possession that he had never felt before towards anyone), his mouth half open on one side, deep, relaxed breathing. He was beautiful. And he said he loved Tony. They had made love the night before. Steve had taken him in his arms with adoration and made Tony float. And Steve said he would take care of Tony, that he would make Tony understand why he thought Tony deserved to be happy. Tony laughed through his nose. Only Steve to be so optimistic and believe that Tony was someone worth fighting for.
The elevator doors opened and Tony went straight to his room.
A few minutes later, there was Tony Stark perched behind the chimney on the top of the building in front of Steve’s apartment, hidden in the shadows, waiting. He was fully aware that it was disturbing, but he was unable to return home. He had to see Steve again. Tony needed to see for himself that Steve was fine, that he didn’t need anything. He needed to be sure that Steve had someone watching over him,
” Clint said, going to the quinjet.
“I know.” Stark's gasp sounded metallic behind his helmet. “It's just that I hate surprises.”
A small voice asked in the back of Tony's mind.
“You could’ve warned us.”
Tony smiled.
"How did they know the DNA was his?"
"I think he's had his freeze time for about three lives, Tony." She held up her hands, defending herself when Tony wanted to interrupt her. "But I understand you, okay? Just get ready for the party and make him happy.”
"Don't worry, Nat. The lawyer is here."
Tony facepalmed himself. Steve sucked at the art of acting. Maybe Tony should’ve asked Natasha for coming, after all. She did know how to pretend like no one else. And no one was able to deceive her. She always knew everything, like when Steve and Tony brought the whole team together the day after Strange's visit and after their first night of wild sex post sex-pollen (but that detail they omitted, of course. Soundproof rooms are made exactly to keep that kind of information secret), and Natasha simply said “it was about time.” Enerving, for sure.
They stood a little less than thirty-two feet away. The East River breeze was blowing around them.
“I was in an induced coma for a while. And Pepper helped me to come back by following the instructions I had left in case all this happened. Apparently, it worked. When I came back, I had zero sense of everything that was going on, nor why I wasn’t at my house, or why I didn’t have my friends calling or being there with me. When I mentioned calling you and Pepper stopped me, I knew there was something very wrong. I remembered talking to you,
Steve cleared his throat, suddenly uncomfortable. Tony saw that he was red and felt his heart heat up. So, he still had the power to make Steve Rogers blush. Well, that was certainly a victory. “You said Osborn had other intentions ...” Steve said, drinking his own coffee.
“Pickles? What pickles?” Clint started to walk away, heading toward the quinjet. “You know what he's talking about, Thor?”
"What do you need me to do?" Tony asked standing next to Steve.
"Is the girl a gas tank?" Clint said, breaking any seriousness.
Steve came into the lab carrying the tray with what Tony thought it was supposed to be his dinner. Steve’s expression was serious with a frown of concern. He scanned the lab with his eyes until they found Tony on the floor.
“Really?”
Except for the memory
"Thanks, but we both knew it wasn't a question of
"Of course, whatever you want."
They were in the lab and Tony couldn’t remember the last time Peter had woken up so early on his own. That was really important to the boy, being a hero and fighting with the Avengers had become an essential part of who he was, but after Thanos, Tony felt even more responsible for him. So Tony took on the task of supervising Peter's studies and making sure that no aspect of life outside the Avengers was neglected. Besides, Tony had given his word to May that she could trust him.
Clint almost screamed.
“So you left with the incursion already happening?”
“You bet.”
“Hold your breath, love, I'm gonna make you reconsider that in a moment.”
Strange's eyes widened, but it lasted a fraction of a second, and Tony was extremely happy to have managed to see the panic in them. “No, that's all.” He stopped and swallowed. Tony could see the Sorcerer's Adam's apple rising and falling with difficulty. “Thank you, Stark.”
“Didn’t you know?” Steve looked as shocked as Tony.
“What are you planning, Tony?”
“Just you and me,” Steve agreed and refocused on his task of getting rid of Tony’s pants, unzipping the button and zipper and carefully pulling the pants down. He wanted Steve.
“What do we have?”
"What?" Tony saw Steve asking, with a doubt line between his eyes. Tony didn't care and continued to sing.
"Nine-fifteen on Saturday morning, boss.”
always felt inadequate around me.”
“Very well. Time to win a bet.”
"I think it's a great idea," Steve said, still stroking Tony's leg under the table. “Nat, be the dealer?”
"Fine," Tony grimaced. "My day just got less good. Let's go home. Every minute lost here is a minute not spent doing something fun until the Fury arrives.”
Without loosening his mouth, Tony came down, slowly swallowing all Steve's length, until he felt it touch the back of his throat. Steve moaned loudly. Tony came back to the beginning and, with the help of his hand, began to suck Steve as if the world were about to end and that was his only salvation.
He straddled Steve, kissed him, and looked him in the eye. “Are we going to need a condom, soldier? Or can we go bareback?”
Tony really wasn’t expecting that.
The girl had no expression, but Tony had the impression that he knew her...
“It wasn’t worth it,” they both said at the same time. Steve smiled a little, like when you share a secret. A second-hand memory flashed in Tony’s head. A footage.
"It's not on my priority list for the day.”
“But something has changed,” Steve said, still with his eyes closed.
“Never. The A.I.M. never surrenders.”
All the while, Steve watched the show Tony was putting on only for him, mesmerized and in a state of horniness that he had never thought possible in his life. Seeing Tony in that position, completely exposed, opening himself, was a vision he’d never been able to color in his dreams, because it was too distant even for his most insane delusions. Tony looked so fucking gorgeous with his hole staring at Steve and his cock totally hard, with Tony's hand around it, going up and down, pulling out the best sounds from him.
“Are you sure?” Steve laughed.
P.S.: Trigger Warning: the first part has a description of a panic attack. So, if this is sensitive content for you, feel free to start reading from "'Are you alright?' Tony asked quietly beside him."
"How nice," Tony returned the smile, his words dripping with irony.
“Let me get in there.” Steve touched Tony’s forehead with his finger.
Steve smiled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So we’re back to Rogers, huh?” Steve raised an eyebrow.
What was he talking about? How come you weren’t ready for me? Curiosity won in the end, and Tony turned to face Steve. Their eyes met and Tony saw that Steve’s eyes lit up when Tony turned.
"The boy. Do you think he's guilty or not?"
Steve thought.
“I love you, Shellhead.” Steve used his free hand to hold Tony's neck and lean in to kiss him deeply and slowly, until they were both breathless.
Tony laughed.
“You’re not speaking for yourself, Tony.” Steve’s eyes were pained. “It’s the flower that’s making you act and speak like this.”
Tony sighed. That War would never have come this far if they hadn’t taken sides. If both had moved away, perhaps things would have worked out differently. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.
Tony felt Steve's hand slide more easily with the precome that started leaking from him and that only made him get harder.
Tony was startled and looked up. Steve was right there, in front of him, sitting on his heels, hands folded on his lap.
Of how they were answered by you”
And Tony Stark was at his side.
"Okay," Peter said in the world's most disappointed and sad voice.
Fury raised his hands in front of his body.
"Washing with soap and sponge helps me think.”
No one said anything during a time that seemed infinite, but then Clint made his usual mistake: he tried to help.
And it destroyed everything I thought I had built with you since that first meeting. You hated me, but the betrayal I saw in your eyes tore my heart in half. I’d
Our dear ones traveled to enjoy Tony's birthday gift for Steve, and if I can say it before we start, they've had a lot of fun.
"There with the hydra are the Three Furies," Thor pointed to the east portal. "They judge and punish mortals for their crimes."
The meaning of my existence is
See you soon <3
"Patience is a virtue, boy," Tony said solemnly, but he read the paper in his hand again.
"To his misfortune," Steve said, walking toward the Greek god. "Neither do us.”
- he opened his mouth, giving Steve free access.
“Pepper, she called me to help you,” Steve said.
"And let the others know we're leaving," Steve said.
Tony blinked and realized that Steve was looking at him.
“I saw it, okay?” Natasha sighed heavily. "The others are still completely oblivious, but I'm not.”
You are the reason why I survived, even when I thought I had lost you, because I knew I’d find you somewhere. You are why and wherefore I exist. You are the one I will take care of, no matter the difficulties.
, where they found him. As if they closed a cycle. Arriving in the Arctic that day, Tony felt himself the most selfish of men, but he just didn’t care. He wanted Steve all to himself, if only for a second, before he never saw his friend again. He wanted to be able to say what he hadn’t achieved during the funeral open to the public. He wanted to say what he had never said to Steve, but he should have. But even there he couldn’t.
"Oh... I'm sorry, Cap.”
“Come here.” Steve Rogers, who would say, had the softest embrace in the world. No one could imagine that the all-powerful Captain America could be so delicate and capable of so much tenderness. Tony allowed himself to melt in Steve's arms for only a few seconds before sniffing and wiping away his tears.
Steve smirked. “Glad you liked it.”
Tony tightened his arms around Steve and grabbed his hair between his fingers, pulling them back to make Steve look at him. “Still, you took a great risk here, Rogers. Why did you do that? You
“Look,” he said, looking at her. “I’ve been thinking that, just maybe, my version of the other Earth, your father, hasn’t considered all the effects of having several versions in various dimensions. Maybe he didn’t have time to dig deeper, maybe he didn’t consider that part so relevant.” He looked at Steve, who nodded encouragingly. “What I'm trying to say is that maybe there are really links that unite our different versions, such as an umbilical cord, and by which we unconsciously exchange information about our lives in those other dimensions. How else would you explain our sudden love for you, our need to protect you, Steve knowing the affectionate nickname that his version of your Earth gave you, and more than that: how did you come to stop
Steve let go of the kiss and, with the tip of his tongue, ran down Tony’s jawline until he reached the neck, when he exchanged his tongue for wet kisses that took out a soft moan from the engineer.
convening a press conference to announce to the whole world that I have the most incredible boyfriend anyone could have," Tony smiled absent-minded.
Tony tried to take a deep breath and think again, but his mind was taken over again by an avalanche of Steve, and Steve taking Tony in his strong arms and kissing him deeply, cupping his face and not letting Tony go anywhere, because Tony was his now.
Steve stood up, propping himself up on his elbows, and smiled. “You’re impossible.” With one foot, Steve slowly climbed up Tony's leg, still covered by the undersuit until he reached his crotch. Slowly and with a patience he didn't really have, Steve began to stroke that big bulge in Tony's pants that was begging to be released. Tony threw his head back, hissing loudly and following the movements of Steve's foot with his hips, looking for any friction he could find. “Tony, babe, please, let me suck you now.”
"Now, now, I thought I wouldn't hear from you for a while. You used to be better, Stark."
"No, I wasn't always an artist. I was an Army Captain."
Tony shrugged. "Who knows? But we need to respect his time, Steve. When he wants, he'll come looking for you and go back to being what he always was."
Tony looked into Steve’s eyes, and he looked right back at Tony. Both of them were obviously savoring the sensation.
Tony sighed. He never realized that he really had a masochistic side, but apparently Steve had the power to awaken all of the dark and unexplored sides that Tony had. For the good and for the bad.
"There's someone in the fountain," Natasha whispered softly.
“Take your time,” Steve said from the roof. “I’m going to go in and have something hot. When you decide, the door will be open and there will be a cup waiting for you inside,” he turned and went back into the apartment, but Tony’s sensors indicated that the door really was unlocked.
Completely exhausted, Steve forced himself to accompany Tony. He had said it all. He didn’t have a convincing, scientific, or even plausible explanation for the fact that he and Tony wanted to
“Steve!” Tony shouted, catching the Captain's attention, which only had time to lift his shield above his head before Tony held him at the last moment. With the impact of hydra’s foot on the ground, they were thrown to the intersection of the 5th with the 23rd and fell in the middle of the traffic, forcing the vehicles to turn aside abruptly.
Tony smiled. It was the first time Steve had called him "my love." He approached for another kiss, but stopped halfway with the sound of the Tower's alarm.
“What do you mean?”
“Come on, I don’t want to be here when Fury arrives. Bureaucracies drain my beauty.”
of you - and even that you thought that if you had told me about everything, I wouldn’t believe you,” he leaned forward, propped up on his elbows, and looked at Tony. “You know, you could’ve tried. I could’ve listened to you; I could’ve helped you find a solution. We could’ve avoided all of this together.”
"What do you already have?" Tony asked taking a sip of the coffee that room service had brought him. “Let's start with the general parts and then let's focus on the details, okay?”
Rhodes drank some more of his coffee. "You said you didn't pay attention to where you were coming. Does that mean you came in a hurry?"
“What happened then?” Steve asked quietly, his voice troubled, any trace of disappointment from before, at the news of Tony’s corruption, gone. Who knew Tony was a good storyteller, even with memories that weren’t even his own anymore?
"Our turn." He turned to Wanda and Thor.
"Well, that explains why you didn't remember that I work in the city," Rhodes said.
Tony rubbed his eyes and stretched.
“I kept thinking about everything we’ve ever lived through, you know,” Steve said. “So many battles won and lost together, so many sleepless nights thinking about strategies or just talking, movie and game nights with our friends, and I couldn’t understand when we had lost each other.” Tony watched Steve run his fingers through his hair in frustration. “But there came a time when I knew we needed to talk, that I thought I had all the answers to our problems. I was very arrogant, I know, to think I knew everything. But then, you suggested a truce to talk and that was all I needed. And I went. But I didn’t think about what I was doing, because when I arrived at the mansion that day, when I saw you, without armor, just being you, open, vulnerable, I forgot everything because I wasn’t ready
They landed two blocks away from Ares. Steve saw him smile.
"As much as I hate to spoil the moment, I think our food has cooled.”
Slowly Tony slid his foot back and straightened in his chair.
“NO!” Tony sat up abruptly and felt the world go round. He held his head in his hands. “
"I'm not leaving here."
you,” Tony said, smirking, and bending down towards the curve of Steve's neck, sucking hard enough to leave a mark that, hopefully, it would last long enough for the rest of the team to see. He kissed his way down the valley between his pecs, then kissed and sucked each nipple.
Tony coughed a few more times to save time. He wasn’t expecting to see Steve today, at least not at this time, with his beautifully messy hair, wearing a Stark Industries T-shirt at least a smaller number than ideal, bare feet and sweatpants, revealing his v-line. Tony swallowed hard and forced himself to look into Steve's eyes.
“What do you suggest?”
"Yes, you do." Steve smiled sheepishly.
He took a handbag, folded the clothes, took the shoes Friday had chosen, put it all in, and froze at the closet door.
needed him. No, that would be very selfish. Steve came back because this is simply where he fits in.
the last one to blink."
Still pretending to pay attention, he lifted his arms, stretching himself and slid into the chair, resting his neck on the backrest and leaving his butt on the edge of the seat.
"You're back, finally."
"Peggy knew."
“Right now?” Steve looked at Tony and the engineer was surprised by the intensity of the blue. "Nothing special.”
“With me alone.”
Still, Tony remained silent.
to the position of Director of SHIELD.” Tony emphasized each word, making quotes in the air. “The government fell for Osborn and accepted the proposal. Thus, I was deposed from the position of Director of SHIELD. But we know that Norman Osborn can’t be trusted because his plans have plans. Nothing is ever what it seems. And this time wasn’t different. He didn’t want to be Director of the largest spy agency in the world simply because the goodness bug stung him and he decided he’d be nice. He had other plans.”
Tony thought mischievously.
"Cap, don’t worry," Peter said. "I don’t care.”
"It seems like everyone knew about me and Steve except, well,
Natasha nodded and typed again on the keyboard.
"I know how to do more than build armors and win poker games, you know.”
“What's going on, Doctor?” Steve asked, his voice denouncing all the concern that he was surely holding.
Tony bent down, resting his hands on his knees, trying to catch his breath and compose himself. He cleared his throat. “No worries, Strange. We'll take care of your box and keep it safe.”
"Friday, tell Natasha we're leaving," Tony said in a squeaky voice. He cleared his throat. "Tell her we're going to be these days without any kind of communication and that's her who’s going to take care of everything around here.”
"To this," Tony waved his hand between them. "Me, you, breakfast in bed, change the day into the night because losing ourselves into one another is a far more interesting alternative than controlling the clock..."
"So you mean Tony Stark still has some secrets?" He laid his forehead against Tony's and they both began to breathe the same air.
think it would have made a difference if I told you what was in the box or not? Do you
” Tony turned his face away and cringed, hugging his knees, even though the position was extremely uncomfortable.
"Here's the access card to your room," the man said, handing him a magnetic card. "Your bags are already in the room. We prepared the presidential suite for your stay and the meeting room for tomorrow at five in the afternoon, as requested.”
He threw the lube tube away and put the undersuit back on. Tony had no idea how long it had been since he started trying to get rid of that damn pollen, but he was exhausted. His arms were aching, his cock was extremely sensitive and Tony still felt like he was going to explode.
“I’m sorry, Tony. I was going to stay;
Fury narrowed his eyes, but started talking again about the pasture with cows. Tony pulled his chair close to the table and, leaning on one of his feet, used the other to find Steve's leg, which only God knows how he managed to disguise the fright with a cough. The soldier looked surprised at Tony, who smirked and continued to explore Steve's leg with his foot. He reached the knee and slipped his foot down Steve's thigh, all the while staring at each other, completely oblivious to what was going on around them, trapped in their own bubble.
“Now what?” Steve asked.
"Shit." Fifteen minutes didn’t do much good.
How Tony could not have Steve's warm body glued to his, to have his soft mouth in his, to feel the eagerness of his tongue exploring and longing for Tony like he'd never before thought he could be wanted? How could he live without that with Steve so close?
Steve closed his eyes and let out a heavy sigh.
"And it's not even noon," Tony commented.
Tony’s brain was no longer functioning. He hadn’t heard anything. It was probably another one of those beautiful and inspiring speeches that only Steve knew how to give, because Tony only managed to pay attention to one part and no other.
“Stark!” He heard Fury calling his name.
They sat on the couch for some more time than any of them counted, listening to the sound of the sea outside, with Tony caressing Steve's leg and Steve lightly tapping his fingers on Tony's arm with no pattern.
"Come on, let's take a shower and rest. Tomorrow I want to enjoy the beach with you.”
"Well, Steve, Peter's arrest was the last step in a chain of events of an investigation that has been going on for some time. Look, earlier this year, a boy who was studying at the same school as Peter was killed, but no one could find the murderer. The case was covered up so that the panic wouldn't spread among the community and among the students. To this day, everyone thinks the boy has been transferred to another school because his parents have moved from the city, fearing the murderer will return and also the pain of not knowing who he or she is. But even after all these months the investigations haven't stopped. With each new lead, there was a new suspect. Until last week."
Of course he could pretend he misunderstood, but everyone there knew that Steve's memory was perfect, in any dimension. He let out a heavy sigh.
Wanda and Vision were traveling the world in a well-deserved sabbatical; Bucky remained in Wakanda with T'Challa; Rhodes was assisting the UN in a new Bureau of Intergalactic Threats, and S.H.I.E.L.D. had been restored under the direction of Nick Fury, who only agreed to return if the Sokovia Accords were repealed, which the President accepted immediately, to despair of Secretary Ross. The Guardians and Captain Marvel returned to monitor the space, but they always sent news and everything was fine.
"Do you really think I know why an infernal dog is staring at me?"
"I love my aunt, but I also love staying here," he started to walk away toward the elevator. “I'm already going to my room.”
Steve blew out the air.
“And why do you need us?” Steve asked.
“For the lies, for not being more reasonable, for not talking to you before ... for not saving you.” Thinking that he could have done something to avoid the shots still deeply troubled Tony. He had secretly created counter-attack plans in possible sniper scenarios, such as the day of Steve’s death. It would never happen again.
"Tell me what I need to know."
Tony kneeled in front of the box and instinctively leaned towards it. The box was a mermaid, singing a sweet, hypnotic melody, convincing Tony that whatever he was looking for was in there.
"First: the boy
“I told you: do with me whatever you want, darling.”
"He tried." Natasha smirked.
"You're back," Steve still stared at Tony as if he was not really there.
“All right.”
The moment of dread was gone as quickly as it had surged when Tony looked up from his legs to scan the rest of the body to which those other strong, shapely legs belonged; the athletic torso, with perfectly shaped muscles, a map that Tony had begun to unravel; flawless chest, with nipples that Tony knew to be sensitive and that, if stimulated in the right way, could elicit groans and delicious sighs to hear; powerful arms that wrapped and protected Tony, holding him around the waist; and the most beautiful, adorable face, and that was synonymous with love for Tony.
“I love you too.”
“Hey! That was mean, Strange!” Tony shouted at where the portal was. He grunted. “This was all very bizarre.”
And there, Tony had no more doubts.
Tony opened his mouth to reply, but closed it as soon as he began to consider the implications of that offer. Having the Sorcerer Supreme of the Multiverse owing you a favor was a big thing, really, Tony couldn't deny it. It was an asset he surely didn't have every day. Strange’s smug widened. That bastard knew the power of his bargain.
“I’m sorry,” Tony said quietly, looking at Steve.
She snorted.
Tony smiled without showing his teeth as he remembered that day, a memory as clear as if it had happened hours earlier. “Because that’s still the best day of my life,” he looked at Steve. “We had no pretensions at all that day, nothing extraordinary should happen and, suddenly, we found that frozen man who, in the end, ended up being the hero of my childhood and youth,” the two exchanged smiles. “I’ll never stop feeling a secret pride for being the first person you spoke to when you woke up,” Tony fell silent as soon as he realized what he had said.
Tony’s brain was no longer functioning. He hadn’t heard anything. It was probably another one of those beautiful and inspiring speeches that only Steve knew how to give, because Tony only managed to pay attention to one part and no other.
“Come on, Tony, show up,” Steve straightened up, but his face was still calm, his features even and without a trace of anger. And his voice was neutral, without a tone of bitterness or urgency.
"Finally, our night off!" Clint hopped around them, humming 'night off’ over and over.
“Are you going to fight me and kick me out again if I say no?” Steve shrugged. “Honestly, I always thought it was a myth.”
“I can’t, Steve. I ...
"That excuse is horrible."
"Great. With Peter out of jail, we're going to prepare the next step in our defense," Tony smiled again, leaning back, satisfied with his reasoning.
Tony was taken out of his daydreams by an alert message flashing on his display, warning of someone approaching. When he looked to see who it was, his heart filled and Tony found himself smiling. Steve was on the roof again, like the night before, still looking calm, peaceful, but something about him didn’t feel right. Tony zoomed over Steve’s face and felt his chest tighten. Steve had a melancholic look in his eyes, which he rarely allowed himself to have, after all, the great and powerful leader of the Avengers can’t show weaknesses. But there, alone on the roof of his apartment, on a cold and empty night, Steve allowed himself to let all those repressed feelings arise and Tony fought the urge to go there and hug him until nothing worse was left. Steve walked to the outside wall of the apartment on the roof, spread a blanket on the snow-covered floor, sat down and leaned his head against the brick wall behind him to look at the misty sky, with the overcast moon, appearing here and there. Tony saw him sigh.
“Tony?” Steve called and Tony faced Steve's warning expression: tight jaw, serious eyes, raised eyebrow and lower lip slightly pointed forward. That was the first strike. Then the lecture would come. Tony usually managed to stop on the second strike, because he felt like the worst of people when he got the third strike: the look of “I'm not mad at you, I'm just disappointed.”
“You look impatient, Tony.” Steve laughed, and his laugh did things to Tony's heart.
"Get ready for the landing," Pierre said over the loudspeakers. Soon after, the whole plane shook with the impact of the wheels touching the ground. A short time later, the aircraft was finally stopped and the door opened, releasing the ladder. Pierre put his head back out of the cabin. "Have a good time. Your car is waiting for you out there, Mr. Stark.”
Tony growled, pulling Steve up and kissing him.
“Who’d say Captain America knew some dirty talk?” Tony looked amazing gleaming under a layer of hot sweat, staring at Steve like a dreamer. “Your cock feels like paradise,” Tony said in a dreamy voice. “Fuck me hard, Steve. C’mon, make me feel you for the rest of the week, everytime I sit, everytime I walk, I wanna remember
Tony watched the choices and let out a murmur of approval.
“I know! I'm looking at her too, okay? But the numbers don’t match.
“What kind of crimes?” Wanda asked.
“Aye!” The god of thunder and Tony grabbed each of the sides of the structure and pulled it off the ground.
"And what does that mean exactly?" Steve leaned towards Tony instinctively, unaware of what his body was doing. It was a soft force, almost imperceptible, but one he didn't even think about resisting.
Tony looked back at Strange. “I’ll let you know when it’s time to return the favor.” And because Tony was Tony, he winked at the Sorcerer Supreme.
Also this chapter is the start of Steve and Tony's relationship, in all the possible senses.
Tony still couldn’t get out of the entrance to the room. He was mesmerized. Steve was there, closer than he had been in the past few hours, in the past few months, moving, breathing.
Tony laughed.
“Well, we’re about to find out. Where’s Steve?”
“It couldn’t be different with the family I have.” She stopped and her smile died. “With the family I
"I'll be back in time for your birthday party," Tony teased.
Apparently, Tony was able to denounce himself even when he tried to stay with his own thoughts. He was a damn open book for Steve. He sighed. “I know I should feel guilty and ashamed, and the worst of assholes now. Look at everything I told you. I
“You'll understand when you arrive,” she said, and hung up.
Steve laughed through his nose. “Because we are both too stubborn to give up an argument. And then we fought,” Steve sighed. “We started with a truce, we dropped our weapons, you even came out of the armor. We even managed to laugh a little, but ended up punching ourselves because, apparently, that was all we knew how to do because we were too blind trying to prove which side was right.”
"I’m not sure if I'll ever be so evolved. But one thing you can be sure of: you will
the part you’re going to pay attention to?” Steve held Tony’s face with one of his hands. “I was
"And may I ask why?" Tony watched Steve play with his fingers and couldn’t stop smiling.
“Hey.” He pulled away a little and cupped her face in his hands. Their eyes met and Tony wished he could give away everything he had to remove that sadness from her eyes. “Never forget one thing.” She stopped sobbing for a moment, paying attention.
Tony watched from the top and realized that the soldier had turned his back on the hydra's left leg while talking to Peter.
Tony smiled. “Yeah, together.”
of good things, when, in fact, you are the best of all things, Tony.”
He looked back at Steve who was staring at him intensely behind his long eyelashes. Tony's body shuddered.
, Rogers. For years now. But I never allowed myself more than just dreaming, after all, how someone like you could want someone like me?”
Steve laughed.
"When you least expect it, Steve, dear, Nick Fury and his eye patch will be knocking on our door, and then, goodbye, quiet time."
Tony opened and closed his mouth several times, unable to articulate what he was feeling. He had to say something wise at that moment, right? Perhaps to say that Steve did the right thing in realizing the obvious, that it was clear as the sunniest day he belonged to that time, to
“You’re not that person, Tony,” Steve said with a frown.
“What?” Tony didn’t think he heard it right.
“Yesterday afternoon.”
“Those who are affected by the pollen have their greatest passions and desires increased at the peak of the peaks. Especially those we try
“Tell me,” Natasha said. “Please.”
didn’t we talk?”
"We just met, Tony," Steve sighed, embarrassed. "You are the lawyer who came to defend my son. You shouldn't have seen any of this, nor should you have been through any of this. It's not your job to help me during a panic attack," Steve hid his face at the wheel again.
Natasha shrugged.
Tony knew how much damage the Registration Act and the Civil War had left behind. Steve’s death, his memory loss and Norman Osborn taking control of SHIELD were the prime examples of all that. Tony wasn’t an idiot. Losing his recent memory didn’t make him a stupid. He was still a genius who knew all that was at stake with that weird-haired lunatic in power, but he just couldn’t think of any of that.
“What do you think?” Tony asked Steve and Natasha.
Together, as it should have always been, we saved the entire universe. We found and held those stones together, shared the power, hurt each other, but we did what was necessary to save each other. We managed to undo mistakes that should never have been made, such as never having the courage to admit what we really felt for each other, since that very first meeting.
Tony froze in place. Panicking, he looked at his hands and then checked the status of the armor on the display. Everything was in order; he was practically invisible. Still, very slowly, he turned back toward Steve’s building and there he was, looking in the direction Tony was in, missing by a few inches. Tony turned up the volume of the external sounds to accurately capture everything Steve said, but left his own speaker on mute. He still wasn’t sure what was going on there.
"Hulk, you don’t have to follow me," Clint said. "I don’t have pickles hidden in my room.”
"You already cooked for me today." Steve leaned over and kissed Tony's face. "Let me cook for you now. Only your company is enough for me.”
Steve came over and covered them both with his arms. He kissed the top of Liz's head and he and Tony exchanged a quick kiss amid their smiles.
“Hulk, a passage through the ceiling, please,” Tony asked and with a roar, Hulk flew past him toward the ceiling, making his way to the base exit.
would I ruin everything?”
Tony thought with his eyes getting warm.
“All right, Vision, you can drop her n...” Natasha never finished that sentence. When her eyes finally met the girl’s, all the questions she thought about to ask herself were useless, because the answers were already right there in front of her.
" Tony spoke softly and in a low tone, punctuating his sentences slowly, declaring them emotionless and practically, being, Steve realized, surprisingly for the first time since he had seen Tony for the first time, a real lawyer. "I know that he is your son and we know that he is innocent, and we will get him out of this situation. But know that in situations like this, even if we manage to get him out of here today or tomorrow, his case doesn't end so easily. Your son will only be acquitted if another piece of evidence comes up showing that he has nothing to do with the murder or if the real killer shows up and confesses," Tony released Steve and looked away. Steve was shaking. "You need to remember what it was like five years ago," Tony said suddenly.
Steve frowned. "Why would I complain?"
"And what do you need to think so much about?"
Steve was wide-eyed.
"Yes, a DNA sample. Which is compatible ... which is compatible with Peter's DNA."
“The equipment is yours.” Natasha shrugged. “You put what you want in it.”
Steve laughed softly. “Come on, tell me what happened.”
Tony heaved the air heavily. He was busy.
While Peter kneaded the mixture, Steve began to wash the broccoli and chop onion. It was a meticulous work and the two worked quietly for some time.
“Depending on the day, their intensity changed. If we had spent the day together, in my dreams I would take you to the bedroom and sometimes we would just kiss, other times we would make love. But if some fight had taken place that day, the dream was always more intense.”
That was a bad time for a trip like that. At least four days just now that a super soldier had declared himself to him. Life was so unfair.
With the room completely in the dark, Tony let his eyes close and with thoughts of "Steve will be happy to know that I slept so much in the last hours," he actually fell asleep.
Steve ran close to the dog, who, even lying down, was still extremely tall, and smiled at Wanda.
"Talk to me, my love," Tony rose as high as he could, still jerking Steve's cock.
Steve frowned at the sudden change of subject, but nodded. “Yes. I don’t know how many times, but I know there were many. Enough to analyze it from the most different angles. Why?”
"Steve, face the facts: you're a famous artist. The best new artist in the last decade, according to, well, according to a lot of art magazines and according to Pepper, who understands a lot about the subject and is the one who curates my private collection," Tony let out a low breath. "Everyone who knows art wants one of your drawings, and everyone who has never heard of art knows who you are. That is: everyone has known you since you appeared in the art world. And even if you weren't famous for drawing, you are a former US Army Captain. This is big. Huge. The son of an Army Captain being accused of murder? It's a full plate for those vultures."
“Who are you?” The girl, Liz, asked in a strangled voice.
Natasha thought.
Natasha was taken from her reverie by a cry of pain coming from the opposite edge of the fountain. Thor had managed to hit the girl with one of his lightening, but it was not the shock that made her scream, but the impact against the stone. Natasha saw the girl's left ear dyeing with the blood dripping from a not-so-beautiful wound that had opened on her forehead. Momentarily disoriented, the girl was finally vulnerable and at a disadvantage, letting the path clear to Vision to increase his density, grab her by the neck and raise her to a few inches of the ground. The girl coughed and tried to break free, but Natasha knew it was a futile effort. Once Vision increased his density, only Wanda could face him. And counting on the help of the Scarlet Witch was not an option at the time.
"Good. Keep this with you when the lawyer gets there. You will need faith to get through this."

The afterwards scared him more than turning on the armor and leaving the hiding place. What would he say? Would he start by saying something or would Steve speak first? What would Steve say? Would Tony get hurt, no matter what? Was he prepared to take more pain?
"You don't need sake to have the courage to sing, Tony."
"But it's Independence Day. More Captain America than that, it’s impossible.”
Steve laughed through his nose. “Because we are both too stubborn to give up an argument. And then we fought,” Steve sighed. “We started with a truce, we dropped our weapons, you even came out of the armor. We even managed to laugh a little, but ended up punching ourselves because, apparently, that was all we knew how to do because we were too blind trying to prove which side was right.”
Tony felt his own eyes weigh and didn’t fight.
Steve shrugged.
Tony moaned. Of all the things Steve could’ve said, of all the things he could’ve remembered to quote, did it have to be that?
Steve followed Tony's movement and nodded.
"Why again did you sir ask to receive these grades by the mail?" Peter asked, wringing his fingers nervously.
“Hell, Thor, I thought we were friends!” Clint ran into the quinjet with Hulk behind him and Thor following them laughing out loud.
“Come for me, babe,” Steve said, meeting each of Tony’s thrusts, pounding inside him, finding his prostate, making Tony scream louder than before. “Let it out, Tony.”
Tony opened his mouth, but no words came out.
Steve's blood froze in his veins. "Yes, he is my son. What happened?"
“I don’t understand,” Steve ended up saying.
Tony got up and held Steve by the hands, leading them back toward the hydra.
“This what?” Tony frowned, not understanding.
"You loved me," Tony said to Steve's lips as he stroked his golden hair. "And you loved me so much and for so long that the universe could not remain indifferent to such a beautiful and enduring feeling.”
“Jarvis?”
“I love you,” Steve said in a whisper.
“Really? I'm here trying to talk about Hydra's plans for building their new headquarters and that's what you have to add?”
"Okay, okay," Tony said, getting up from the seat where he was sitting. "And the verdict is..." he stared at Peter seriously. “You've scored all your finals, which leaves you more than ok to stay here and remain an Avenger. Congratulations, kiddo.”
Natasha punched Tony's arm, which cringed.
"You're in good hands, then. I'll talk to you later, dear. Be well. I love you."
, before we explode.”
Tony's brain suddenly cleared.
“It is. It's what we are, yes," he gripped Tony's face with his free hand and stroked it with his thumb. "Is it still my birthday and I don’t know?”
Thirty seconds later, Tony and Steve were in the car, with Happy driving to Tony's private hangar.
“Hmmm?”
“I was just kidding, silly.” Steve kissed the top of Tony's head. “Yes, I promised you a shower, and we’re going to take that shower, don’t worry. But can we finish our coffees first?” Steve pouted.
"Hi," Steve heard back. "I'm here. Do you know where it is?" Steve blinked.
“Yes, we are.” Steve clasped his hands on Tony’s waist, restating his words.
He had always loved Steve. Even when he thought he didn’t, even when he thought he had gotten over it, even when he thought he hated Steve, even when he was with other people trying to deceive himself. All that time he loved Steve more than anything. All that time he wanted Steve by his side and he wanted to be by Steve’s side. During all those moments when he told himself that feeling was a lie, all he wanted most was to be where he was now, in Steve’s arms, opening his heart, being loved back, no longer needing to hide, being able to be himself. He can be powerful with Steve, he can be whatever he wanted, because Steve would always be there to support him, to be the voice of reason when Tony exaggerated; to go with Tony, even when it was dangerous, because that’s what Steve did: he was always with Tony, side by side.
"Not any party. A birthday party
"A little."
"I'm in position." Sam's voice sounded in Natasha's ear.
“Is that the weapon there?” Sam asked.
“Which one?”
“Sure, sure,
- sitting across the table.
"Pretty good, thank you." Before he let go of Tony's hand, Bucky pulled him close so that only Tony could hear. "Take good care of my friend, okay?”
properties, in high concentrations. There are other substances present, but none of them are known to man.”
“Yeah.”
"Do not worry, Thor," Vision said, dangerously approaching from the rear of the ship. "Besides, I already have a look at the whole situation.”
"Of course," Ross looked as if he had been shocked because he started to move, rummaging through the piles of papers and files on his desk, until he found a specific one, not too thick, and handed it to Tony. "Here it is. It's a copy. You can take it with you," Ross smiled without showing his teeth. "Courtesy of the house."
“Well, according to Urich, he didn’t need to publish that information to ruin me because I would ruin myself, after all, apparently, this was what happened to people like me,” Tony said, remembering the conversation he watched between him and Ben Urich, recorded by his office security system. Tony laughed through his nose, but the sound was like a sad moan. “Thinking about it now, I wonder if that wasn’t a dark prophecy.”
"How lucky I am to have the whole country partying for me, right?" Steve said acidly as he set the glasses in the sink.
"Maybe face it isn’t the best word," Steve sighed. "I've been staring at it every day for years.”
Tony shrugged.
Tony opened and closed his mouth a few times and felt like a goldfish. He was completely unresponsive. What the hell had just happened there?
"I thought it might be a pertinent observation. Don’t be so upset, Old MacDonald.”
“There are several versions of us and Earth scattered in different dimensions. My father explained to me that each dimension is as if it were a single universe, closed in on itself, and does not necessarily know the existence of the other versions." She shrugged. "We knew, but I guess you didn’t, right?”
“We need to get this thing out of here,” Steve said, his light stance fading. “Tony, if the gun is taken out of the ground, will it detonate?”
is my home.”
Tony blinked a few times, repeating the phrase mentally, afraid he might have heard it wrong. “What did you say?”
Steve smiled the brightest of smiles and kissed Tony with all his passion and with all the happiness that those words had multiplied within him. Tony was the love of his life, his reason, his root in this crazy world since Steve had left that block of ice. Apparently confusing love with hate was quite easy when nobody says anything, when neither side takes the initiative to take the first step. It took the two of them to get lost in order to finally have the courage to seek and find each other.
On Earth, everything had gone back being what it had always been, with the usual villains, with their plans to dominate the world or to destroy New York or simply to destroy the Avengers and then make their way for the rest. It was good to be back to the routine.
“Okay, I'm sorry. But if you need to, just call me. You know I have the means to help you even being away.”
"I've had a beard almost as long as Thor's waiting for you," Clint complained. "What were you whispering there?"
Natasha walked slowly around the fountain, glancing briefly toward Clint to see him sitting with Sam bandaging his shoulder.
"Can I ask you a question?"
“I’m fine.” Tony said, or he thought he did, because Steve asked again, “Tony, are you listening to me?”
Tony and Thor raised the monster from the ground and Hulk gave the impulse that was needed to send the hydra back to the Greek world from where it had come and with a powerful lightening, Thor hit the portal, closing it.
Tony narrowed his eyes.
“Yes, sir?” the AI responded promptly.
Tony blew out a breath and leaned across the table, crossing his fingers. "Two days ago she called me saying that the Boston police were investigating the murder of a boy and that this investigation had been going on for a few weeks, without any advance. The news is that she had heard conversations that the investigation was about to change and be solved. When I asked how it would happen, she was unable to tell me, but asked me to stay on standby if she called again," Tony stopped to check the surroundings again. Too much care? Never. "A few hours later she really called me again and told me that the case had gotten an important clue, the DNA of a suspect, in good condition, directly at the crime scene. When I asked her why she cared about it, she told me that the owner of the DNA sample found was her godson and that he wasn’t the one to blame and she was absolutely sure of that. I tried to argue that she had an intimate relationship with the boy and everything we can use as a counterpart argument, but she was convinced: it hadn’t been the boy, and then my biggest shock came: she asked me for a favor, a very big and old favor. The only bargaining chip she still had with me. Then I had two certainties, Rhodes."
As if they had taken one of Thor's strikes, Wanda and Bruce rushed out of the room to prepare the other Quinjet, heading for Queens.
It was everything he wanted the most. Steve invited him, without anger, without harsh words, just an invitation. And Tony couldn’t do it. He stared at where Steve had been, the marks of his arms where he leaned against the rail, still visible in the snow.
"Two in the morning, sir.”
Still kneeling, Steve lifted one of Tony’s legs, holding by the ankle and kissed each exposed piece of skin, going up the calf, passing through the knee, up to the upper thigh, until he went down inside and made Tony’s eyes turn inside the globes. He stopped a few inches from Tony’s underwear and looked at him.
“I was never infected, Tony.” Steve explained.
“What do you mean with ‘but not’?” Clint asked.
“Hey!” Tony protested. “Maybe,
"Anything that doesn’t have the Fourth of July theme."
“I love you,” Tony said on tiptoe.
"Oh, Tony," Steve whispered.
“What are you planning, Tony?”
“This is ridiculous. Won’t happen.”
Nat leaned back in his chair. "Smart answer." She turned to Bruce. "Come on, it's our turn to sing."
Tony woke with a jolt. His stomach was in his throat, and he needed a second to remember himself where he was.
"That's what we'll see," Thor said with a laugh.
Tony blinked and felt his face heat up. He looked at his own cup and sipped his coffee. It was delicious. “I’m sorry. It’s just that I still haven’t gotten used to the idea of ...” Tony risked looking at Steve, who was looking back at him, waiting. Tony looked back at his coffee. “I still haven’t gotten used to the idea of having you back.”
- put the cup down and looked at Steve.
Tony cleared his throat and Steve was adorably red, but he took his hand from Tony's leg and placed it cross-lacedly on the table politely. "Great." Natasha smiled, and then looked at Tony. "You, big blind.”
"A son, huh?" She asked with a small smile.
to do for you in my semi-conscious state?"
“Why do they get the cool thanks?” Tony pretended to be offended.
"You should," Steve said. "I mean, no! You should not care. You're still a child. You should not be involved in this kind of conversation.”
"Zeus and the other Olympians are under the power of Hades now. And
“Did you hear anything else that I sang? The part about
erase my memory in one last attempt to ... I don’t know.” Tony struggled to find the right word, but nothing in the right sense occurred to him.
“Tell me this was you deactivating the bomb,” Clint said.

He doesn’t know their names, but he traces his hands over the darkly inked lines of their faces: the woman with hair like fire, the man clad in a cape clutching a hammer, the archer peering intently down from a perch high in a warehouse-like building, the demure curly-haired man who cringes away from his own shadow.
, he is more isolated than ever before. Even the bullies who used to beat on him are gone, and Steve knows rationally that most of them – even Bucky – won’t be coming back alive.

He tries to move on. He sweeps Mr Miller’s shop every day and takes home his wage in an envelope, stopping to buy some bread if he can afford to splurge on a freshly-baked loaf.

There were worlds where they weren't superheroes, and worlds where they weren't even human. But a world without the Avengers felt the most impossible.
“What do
Tony shook his head, slumping back onto Steve's lap and closing his eyes.
“Ah. Is that your squad name?”
more effective from an aerial angle.”
Steve wonders if he has to live the rest of his life like this. If there’s a breaking point, for his body, or for his heart. He lives like someone managing their symptoms, waiting for things to take a turn for the worse.
“I’m sorry,” he says.
“It's not nearly the strangest thing the Avengers have ever dealt with. At least no one is actively trying to kill us here.”
“Should gay chicken count?” Carol asked.
“Yeah, few things worth turning down an orgasm for.” And there, a way to angle into asking if they could do this again, multiple times, even. “I'm pretty sure Rhodey thought we were fuckbuddies earlier.”
“Well, force isn't going to work here. I'm sure these young ladies have such killer business instincts that they'd never leave without making their target goal of getting every single one of these boxes sold.”
“Your call,” Tony says, offering him another out, as he raises his time GPS, eyes fixed on Steve. He’s giving him an out, but Steve doesn’t want those anymore, not when it comes to them.
“I didn't think he was doing it with
“I suppose the government must have some superheroes,” Sarah said. “Obviously civilians aren't privy to all the details. There's the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, as well.”
“I'm old, not senile,” and before anyone could argue that point, “anyway, I'm calling the alert off. I'm fi –safe.” That won him a sharp look from Rogers, but it's not like Steve wasn't telling the truth there. “Fill me in,” Steve added,
Steve opened his mouth to retort, that she was wrong. Tony knew exactly how to be private and close himself off; getting him to talk about something he didn’t want to talk about was an impossible task.
Tony has been part of his life for so long. The idea of that changing made something twist in Steve's chest.
“Did you know what would have happened if you followed after her?” Sam huffed.
But that was always a possibility, wasn't it? One that he thought was worth the risk. At some point, Steve had grown more relieved at Tony's safety than angry at his recklessness. Maybe his old age really was getting to him.
“You know, Tony. Your fellow founding Avenger best buddy.”
“No meddling in the time stream, we know, we heard!” answered Kamala.
Tony giggled, dropping his mouth down and rubbing his cheek against Steve’s clothed thigh. “Fuck, I will make you feel so good, Steve. Fuck the Ultimates, you can be my new bed slave, how’s that sound?”
“He closed the rift,” Steve concluded. “Except he needed a power source, and—” Steve's hands were trembling. “He used the easiest option.”
Those threats, of Sentinels to keep the superheroes in line, anything to assuage politicians' need to serve their people, they're all laughable. The American people are no longer angry at superheroes.
“There's something in the water?” Kamala asked.
“I don’t have any plan to, but if you need the place to yourself.” Steve gritted his teeth. “I’m sure Richard would appreciate my absence.”
Steve watched Tony, who was looking at where Rogers had been with a wistful smile on his face.
They made it to the bedroom in record time, leaving behind the sounds of chatter and laughter. It was a shame about the military training, because after Tony let Steve go to work on freeing his own pants, he looked up and Steve was fully naked and tossing a shirt to the corner.
Steve nodded. He put his face in his hands, and nodded again, feeling the tears spread across his palms and fall between his fingers.
There’s a small snort from Tony. “Well, I’d never want to let the team down.” Tony shuffles in place, and the rare moment of shyness sends a surge of affection through Steve. There’s a part of him that he knows places Tony on a pedestal, but seeing him like this affirms what he already knows: whatever Tony has done, he’s done through conscious choices, decisions, always moving forward. It’s something to admire. Steve wishes there was a world where they didn’t have to make choices like this, but Tony has this ability to make them and own them. He’s amazing.
“Of me? Who'd bother cloning me, when you live here, too?
“Such a strategist, Cap.”
“This is the best present,” Tony said, and Steve tilted his head, before dropping his chin down and chuckling. His fingers closed around Tony's cock, and cutting off Tony's next words. He stroked the length a few times, and Tony tilted his hips into it encouragingly. Steve's hand was warm and rough around Tony, but also frustratingly loose.
Steve’s on the deck of—oh, that’s Tony’s house.
“Oh, believe me, they didn’t need my help. I’ve had over a dozen requests for interviews, and even more in congratulations. A lot of friends and family are pissed at me now, turning away all the flowers and gifts in the past twenty-four hours.”
Steve raises an eyebrow. “You’re getting nostalgic for your PB&J?”
It takes a moment to recalibrate and get his systems back online. The world’s bathed in orange, like an oversaturated sunset. There’s a lake in front of him. He can’t see where it ends. He’s not certain it does.
it. There had to be something behind it—the Avengers, or a team, or any other excuse that Steve didn’t have anymore.
What was there to say to that? Gail had always been kind, and beautiful, but this wasn’t like the Gail he knew to be so mature. Before this point, Steve hadn't given thought to whether the changes in her were for the better. He should have known they always were.
“It gets better,” Steve offered, and the words sounded weak to his own ears.
“Hi?” Carol said, feeling like she'd been left out of a conversation.
Steve bounded quickly, so that when the ogre could track him with his eyes, he already had it in a headlock. It roared, scrabbling at him with thick, jagged nails. Steve squeezed tighter, sending kick after kick into its spine. After a roar, something smacked against the side of his head, sending him reeling. He whipped his head around before he was grabbed by the scruff of the neck, swung around so the ogre could look down at him with its nauseating breath. Steve grit his teeth and blinked the sun out of his eyes. But no, the sun
“That was a crazy stunt you pulled. Made all our comms go out, there,” Sam said.
Tony's cheeks were covered in blood, and Steve jerked back before he realized the blood came from his own fingertips. His fingernails had been ripped off.
Jan jumped when the table jumped. Steve curled the fist he’d slammed into the surface, lowering his head. He was utterly exhausted.
Steve bites his lip. His face is turning red. Someone else might call him an ugly crier, but Tony just brushes his fingers across Steve’s cheek again. “I don’t know. I’m not sure what’s left for me anymore.”
Maybe if Steve waited this out long enough, it'd turn out that he'd never had this conversation. It was all in his imagination, was what his mind had concluded. If he kept silent, then the world would arrange itself to match.
“Tony, answer me! Is this...one of the Earths we're facing? That we're in the middle of an incursion with?”
,” Sam muttered.
“You should relax,” Tony said, kissing down his bare stomach, and Steve was the opposite of relaxed, his body tensing at every brush of Tony’s lips. When it’d been Gail, or Jan, they had giggled when Steve had ran his fingers down their torsos, kissing their breasts and hips. When Tony did it, all it did was ramp up his lust to impossible levels, and he thrust his hips up in small little motions, gasping at Tony's searing heat everywhere he touched his fingers, his lips, to.
“You're not with them,” Rogers concluded with no room for argument.
“Definitely not the last time. Now, a few last times ago, I slept with someone who put a gun to my head. It wasn’t the first time it happened, either.”
“I won’t need them.”
“I'm not...I'll get over it.”
“You're done now?” Steve asked him.
Tony woke slowly. Maybe it was because he was warm and comfortable, wrapped in blankets on the floor, like he'd been waking up to in the lab the past week. This was the part he couldn't bring himself to tell Steve. Ghosts didn't do this. Who would care about Tony's well-being enough? All he could think of was himself, and even that was a barely. If Tony was doing things without knowing about them, if he was missing bits of his memory...whatever the reason, he was a danger. He couldn't be an Avenger anymore. And Steve would have been furious to know Tony was hiding this from him.
They were holed up in some counselor's office at the high school. Tony was in the nurse's office, still sleeping. Sam had come to check in on him but had made a quick exit when faced with the prospect of staying around Steve. Steve didn't think he wanted to be in the same room as himself, either. Lucky for him.
Tony stared at him, and when Steve brought the glass up to Tony’s lips, he swatted his hand away, making a grab for it.
“I—” and for how stubborn he was, it didn't take long for him to give in.
“You're not exactly subtle about it.”
The screen did a pan over her body, and Steve turned an assessing eye on it. She was beautiful, but after Tony, it was increasingly difficult to see other people’s bodies as little more than utilitarian.
“Yes, yes,” he said some minutes later. “I've heard of a Hank Pym and a Janet Van Dyne. I believe that they did take up the Giant-Man and Wasp mantle for a bit, but have long retired to civilian lives. As for Thor, we've had some encounters with the Asgardians, but not so often they could be considered for any superhero team. The Avengers, you called yourselves?”
“You all remember these incidents
He reached out, and it was like the wall receded before his touch. It filled in the tear between universes, and Steve was panicking, pressing his palm flat to the wall, banging with his other hand.
“Oh.” Tony couldn't tamp down on the disappointment. He shouldn't be like that, if it was bad enough for Steve to be skipping out on his daily routine. “Nightmares? Do you want to talk about it?”
“It's okay, Steve. I'm not afraid of you.”
Rogers glanced at him, growing sober. “Sorry,” he said. “I didn't realize.”
Credit where credit was due for the decorations, but whoever had done the mistletoe placement was getting moved back in the priority queue for gear upgrades. That fateful piece of mistletoe had been hung right near the entrance way, and Tony hadn't spotted any others hanging around.
Tony gives his sixth eulogy in a month. He pays out death gratuities and survivor benefit plans like they're bonuses. There's paperwork with his signature out there, with his tear and blood stains hurriedly wiped off.
“I’m not pissed,” Steve told him, and Tony snorted. Okay, maybe he was a little. But not in the way Tony had taken it. “You said, once, that your home was open to any of the Ultimates.”
“Then why do you keep doing it?”
“Don’t be so difficult. Steve! Tony!” Jan leaned in. “When did this happen? Wait, doesn’t that mean Steve should have drank last round?”
“Well, that was a good one, Carol!” Tony said, clapping his hands together. His voice was unnaturally high. “You got everyone to drink, well, except me. Because….well. So we have our winners for the night!” He drained the rest of his glass. “Anyway, I’m out for the night. I want to make some headway on the Iron Man propulsion system tomorrow. Jarvis has the night off, but you’re all adults. You can clean up after yourselves, right?”
“If that’s what made him feel better,” Steve laughs.
Natasha keeps Scott outside, talking about their next step of the plan, when Steve scrambles for the bag in the passenger seat, coughing up petals like he hasn’t in years.
In short, he looked like shit. Tony’s expression shifted to surprise, then to anger, then embarrassment, before settling on amusement.
Steve doesn’t know the last time someone’s shown concern for him like this. After Thanos, they’d been so numb and caught up in their own worlds. It should have been him, to check on others, but he’d been so caught up in his own failures. His own heartbreak.
“No, not that I've ever heard of. I assume it's not a good thing?”
Fact of the matter was, him and Sam weren't exactly on friendly speaking terms at the moment. Neither were him and Tony. Once, bantering on private comms would have been par the course for Steve with those two, though it seemed they were having enough fun on their own.
No one was there to greet Steve at the entrance to the penthouse. Not that he minded; it gave him more time to swallow his pride.
Tony frowned at him, and they needed to work on him telegraphic his moves. His arm shot out, aiming for Steve's chin. Steve had planned to parry it, but changed his mind at the last instant and ducked to the side. It was a close one, and from the expression on Tony's face, he knew it.
Steve resolutely ignored Rogers’s increasingly put-off expression. Steve jerked his chin at him, and Rogers scowled back. “They're a friendly, but I don't recommend exposing them to everything that's changed off the bat.”
“Captain.”
Wasn't that how Steve viewed the future in the first place? And there was his mother, and an entire team that was out there, waiting for him to recruit and lead them.
“I have to tell you something,” Tony said, his tongue like lead. “About our world. If we had any sense of self-preservation”—which they didn't, not in their line of work—“we wouldn't go back. There's a …situation waiting for us. It's not an easy one.”
“A few days, huh?” Pepper asks. The wonder in her voice, and there must be a part of her wondering what it’s like, to be able to extricate the feelings that smother everything. For the yawning expanse of grief to end. Steve senses that she’s a practical enough woman to see the benefits of it. She blinks quickly, wiping at a corner of her eye while smiling a private smile with herself.
After even she grew tired of talking, she pushed his water at him. Steve picked it up and drank it in one gulp. It was the most delicious water he’d ever tasted. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d had anything to drink. Maybe when a nurse had offered him some in a paper cup. Jan pushed her water toward him afterward.
“Is Iron Man going to be okay?” Rogers asked, voice trailing off.
“That's all you've got to say?” Steve said, plopping down on his high-backed chair.
Steve and Tony looked at each other.
He put his ear to the wall, pressing his palm against it, and closed his eyes.
“Tony.” Steve's voice was stern. Usually his admonishment was thinly-veiled amusement, but Tony's insistence had left his face flushed.
No, Steve didn't want normal. He just wanted Tony back, and the Avengers back. It had always felt the most right with the two of them.
He meant it to comfort, but he heard the resentment in his own voice, and Gail hadn’t missed it. That they’d still been able to be together for so long. More than twice his own lifetime, with someone they loved. The thought of him and Tony being so lucky was a distant dream.
Rogers was glancing between the two of them, brows furrowed. Steve only noticed because he couldn't bear to look at Tony. He couldn't imagine what his own face must have looked like.
“No,” Tony said, and he wanted to cry. There was a weight, heavy in his pocket. “It's not.”
to watch one of Tony's armors gliding toward them, holding a repulsor gauntlet out.
“He’s dying,” Steve said suddenly. Gail’s fingers squeezed his, and her gaze was struck by pity. From anyone else, it’d spark anger and shame, but not from her. Never from her.
he says, and his chest aches in a way that’s not physical.
Right now, Carol wasn't even capable of that. There was a scramble, and a chair fell over, but there was no missing what she'd just witnessed.
The Audi slows down near him. Steve’s heart is pounding, but he doesn’t feel ready to fight. He feels like he’s looking over the edge of a cliff as the window rolls down.
“Indoor capacity would indicate the high school foremost, and then the community center closeby. The gymnasium at the school is currently closed due to renovations.”
“Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.”
Well, that was—he'd thought about this intently, his ideal scenario. If Steve ever managed to perfect his Ma's stew, then he'd make it and they'd have a lovely candlelit dinner on the roof of the Tower. There was no way his intentions would be misconstrued there. Then they would hold hands and cuddle, and okay, there'd be more than a little necking involved, until Tony took his hand to lead him downstairs.
“But what was it?” Miles asked, crouching down and rubbing at his cowl, like he didn't want anything more than to remove it.
He hadn't been lying, but the thought of following through with his feelings when he didn't know how Tony would react felt overwhelming.
“Whatever you want, Tony.”
To her surprise, Steve was already sitting at the table. Somehow, Carol hadn't already caught him in the gym during
An unamused Johnny Storm was waiting for them by the elevator.
Steve didn't reckon that would work in this case. People had described in detail about how his Cap look and his Cap voice worked (“patent it,” Johnny Storm had suggested), but from the markedly displeased, half-demanding looks Rogers aimed at him, Steve didn't feel anything other than bone-tired.
It was impossible. Sarah Rogers would be twice the age of this woman even if she had lived to the modern era in this universe.
“You said it already, no one's leaving before midnight. Everyone's split off into their own little groups, no one'll notice. Or we can wait a few hours.”
“It’s—the last time you slept with someone, they tried to kill you.”
“No interest? Natasha will be disappointed, after she tried to set you up with so many people.” Tony considered their current situation. “So many women, I mean.”
“Is that what this is?” Steve asked slowly.
“Did you...frame a poster of yourself? For me?”
Not that he would need the shield here—his opponent couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. The agent doubled over Steve's fist and crumbled unceremoniously to the street, next to a campaign sign for Pleasant Hill mayoral candidate.
“Knowing our luck, a supervillain is going to take out the Tower and we'll lose all these.”
Sam didn't respond to the disapproval. “And the work spouse,” he muttered instead, loud enough that Steve could pick it up even without any enhanced hearing. Steve raised his fingers to the earpiece.
He was still smiling. Tony should break all the news to him when he was drunk, this was much better than assessing looks and careful questioning.
But the secret identity had been important to Tony, at least back then, so Steve spoke up. “You don't have to—”
The scream that ripped through the comm stopped the world in its tracks.
“It's our team. Perhaps they're called something else in this world?” Steve asked.
Because life’s just like that, Tony’s outside with his daughter—Morgan—when they pull up into the driveway. Tony doesn’t look happy, and his daughter reflects his expression. God, she’s the spitting image of her father.
“You’ll be home soon.”
The most recent photograph was Steve Rogers in an Army uniform with a fellow soldier. The soldier was beaming at the camera, but Steve had eyes for nothing but his friend, a small, tender smile on his face. It was too intimate for someone like Tony to gaze upon. He felt like a terrible person.
“Tony!”
“Funding is important, but it's not the main thing. What you need, is someone to believe in heroes and the good they can do.” Steve was smiling at him. “Someone who believes in the future.”
“You think it’s the time for those?” Steve said flatly.
“You’re—Tony, I’m sorry.”
“Ah.” His counterpart was doing an admirable job of keeping an unaffected face, but Steve knew what to look for.
Hank shrugged. “Join the club.”
“Tony,” Steve gasped, and then came all over Tony's hand. Tony caught the come, spreading it over Steve's cock as he pumped him through the aftershocks.
“Goodbye, Peggy.”
“I won’t need them,” Steve said. “Save them for Tony, for being stupid enough to pull that maneuver yesterday.”
He’s spent so much time wanting to know what could get under Steve’s unflappable surface. Was Steve just good at tamping down his emotions, or was he better at not letting them affect him? Steve’s expression crumples, and Tony realizes he desperately doesn’t want to know what can break Steve.
The shield clipped her boot, and she shot a blast after it. No time for checking if it'd hit its mark, now that Steve was defenseless. Steve braced himself, ready to dodge in either direction, but Carol was anything but predictable.
“I’ve seen how much you can pack away.”
Natasha finds out when Steve comes back to the compound, six months after he first left. He’s not planning to stay. He’s made use of his phone for the first time in months, calling in favors he used to be too proud for, to get a place in DC. Regardless, she’s the one person who’s willing to stay put, and he thinks it’s for the team. For a place to come home to, if they wish. So he owes it to her to visit, once in a while.
"It never crossed my mind."
“This flower has enough spores to contaminate entire groups for a few hours and individuals can spend up to four days under the effect of pollen, if they are not treated.” Strange shrugged.
"The signature is the same in both." Vision moved one hand, indicating the young woman leaning over the fountain, and the ship. "But what intrigues me is how that is possible.”
“Ha-ha, very funny, Nat.”
“Damn diplomatic immunity,” Stark cursed. “I’d give anything to invade Latveria's systems and discover that lunatic's new plan.”
“Mr. Parker is still in his room, as you told him to do, boss. There are three hundred and eighty unread emails on your server and the construction of the stabilizer you were working on has ended.”
"Do you want me to come up?" Steve asked hoarsely.
"Our intelligence has information that the bomb you destroyed in Alaska wasn’t the only one they had. In fact...”
Tony blinked and looked at him. “But I didn’t say anything.”
Steve shrugged and started stroking Tony's arm with no pattern at all.
"Let's get this over with," Steve said, nausea threatening to take over. With a push, he opened the car door and let the cold Boston afternoon air hit him, and clear his mind enough that he could put one foot in front of the other to get where he needed to be: next to Peter. He walked around the back of the car and joined Tony, who looked extremely comfortable, totally in his element, with his sunglasses shining in the pale sun, his hair letting in the light breeze, without making him unkempt, or looking messed up in any way, but making him look like the owner of the scene.
"I bet I knock my leg down first," Hulk said, punching the left leg.
Tony finished his own slice and got up to get one more. On his way, he realized that Thor, Peter and Hulk
“Is this a trick?” She asked, her eyes moving frantically from one to the other.
Steve smiled beautifully and held Tony by the waist, pulling him close, sticking him to his body and they began to dance, not caring much for the rhythm. Tony laughed.
A distant part of Tony was aware of Steve’s hand gripping the hem of Tony’s shirt, pulling him closer and closer, gluing them together as if they were one. Steve’s tongue slid long and slowly over Tony’s and an appreciative sound vibrated deep in his throat, startling Tony and reverberating directly into his groin when Steve groaned with him.
“Let’s agree to disagree.” Tony shrugged.
Tony felt himself making a face. “I don’t really know where to start.”
"Now go, before Happy comes to get you in here."
"Because it's your son in there," Tony said without changing his tone.
“Thanks, kiddo. And sorry again.”
“Of course. I'd never lie in front of Captain America.” Tony walked over to Strange and reached for the box, but Strange dodged. “I thought you wanted me to keep this in my vault.” Tony frowned.
“I came here to ask for a favor.”
Tony. He swallowed, trying to swallow the anxiety together.
And he wanted to be all that for Steve.
“Where are you going?” Steve asked, far away.
Steve swallowed. He didn’t expect that reaction from Tony. “What’s it, then?”
"I'm already investigating everything that can be investigated about that Jared's family. I heard they are no longer living here."
Hope you like it!
"You should tell."
“Consider it done. I'll send you the details by email.”
Tony made his best expression of innocence.
“Well, even if the reality is incredible and everything, I hope we can repeat these dreams more often. Your fertile imagination is very inviting.”
How could I?”
“Tell him I'm busy.”
Steve opened the envelope carefully and Tony was heart pounding.
Tony wrapped his legs tightly around Steve and arched his back in a desperate attempt to get him deeper, to get him to hit that wonderful spot again and again and again. Tony was out of control and Steve wasn’t much different. His pace became more frantic and his breathing more labored. Then, his hand was wrapped around Tony’s cock, trapped between the glued bodies, and with just a few strokes, Tony screamed and arched his back, giving himself entirely to Steve, coming like never before, leaving Steve’s hand covered with his cum, which Steve licked with no second thoughts, and that vision was almost enough to turn Tony on again.
“Wow indeed. That's why it's so important for you to go.”
definitely not
“Damn it, Banner.” Barton looked darkly at Bruce, adjusted the volume of his hearing aids, and his face became a little calmer.
It was nice, comfortable, domestic, and it warmed Tony up in much more efficient ways than anything he had ever experienced. He couldn’t help thinking that he wanted to keep having it, having Steve waking up next to him, waking up next to Steve, every day. Tony just knew he needed it, needed to know that Steve would come home with him, that they’d both tell about their stressful days, that they’d help each other, that they’d ask for food, that they’d watch stupid comedies together, that they’d try to have sex on the couch , but they’d end up sleeping because the life of world’s saviors was not a wonder, but, when sex happened, wow, it’d be the best of all. Tony wanted that. Needed.
"I wouldn’t miss this party for nothing. I had a lot of work to win it," Tony smirked.
“And what path is that?”
"Come on, let's go inside and I'll tell you," Tony reached out and Steve took it, entwining their fingers.
“I kept thinking about everything we’ve ever lived through, you know,” Steve said. “So many battles won and lost together, so many sleepless nights thinking about strategies or just talking, movie and game nights with our friends, and I couldn’t understand when we had lost each other.” Tony watched Steve run his fingers through his hair in frustration. “But there came a time when I knew we needed to talk, that I thought I had all the answers to our problems. I was very arrogant, I know, to think I knew everything. But then, you suggested a truce to talk and that was all I needed. And I went. But I didn’t think about what I was doing, because when I arrived at the mansion that day, when I saw you, without armor, just being you, open, vulnerable, I forgot everything because I wasn’t ready
“Okay, I'm sorry. Stupid question,” she looked at him. “What do we do?”
We managed to convince ourselves to make a truce, to become friends and to trust each other. You then invited all of us, invited
They were facing each other, with only a fraction of air separating them, once again oblivious to the noise and the people around. With his free hand, Tony reached for Steve's hand on the bar counter and, without looking away, twined his fingers around Steve's.
“Do you want to know how I was born?”
"Oh, come on, aren’t you going to tell me about the dream that made you wake up?"
“So, what I was told is true?” Steve asked, his eyes shining in a new way that Tony had never seen before.
“Oh, my God, that’s why no one can win an argument with you. Look at that beautiful face. How do you do it?”
"I want to know about you," Tony looked at him and Steve moved in his chair, suddenly feeling uncomfortable with the intensity of those extremely curious eyes that seemed to see inside him.
Steve smiled. “First, I’m stopping pretending that I don’t want you, that I don’t desire you, that I don’t want to start my life over with and for you. You only need to say yes, that we start.”
Steve got up and stood beside him, hugging him by the waist, over his armor.
"But I didn't do anything!" Peter shouted. "Dad," he looked at Steve desperately. "Dad,
"Why going so fast, Mr. Stark?" Steve smirked, clutching Tony's waist, gluing him to his naked body.
"At first I thought so, but things aren’t always so easy.”
“Did the rumors have any basis, Tony?” Steve’s expression was unreadable.
Tony’s heart squeezed and expanded, all at the same time with butterflies that found some opening in the armor and reached his stomach.
"Dad, it
Natasha approached and they stopped the heated conversation they were having.
But maybe that wasn’t the right question. And Tony realized he had to admit it to himself.
“...it doesn’t matter. What matters is to be in my best shape for Steve's party.”
Steve nodded in agreement.
"Do not forget, the energy signature is coming straight from the fountain in the middle of the Lincoln Center," Natasha reminded them.
Tony was spiraling, feeling like he was about to jump off a cliff,
"We'll see." The spy narrowed her eyes.
“I’m going to show you,” Steve stroked Tony’s hair. “Every day, until the end, I will prove to you how much I love you and how much you deserve all the happiness.”
Tony turned to Steve.
“That was our deal.”
"No, I'm just a good observer," Tony shrugged.
Tony snorted in disdain.
“I did.”
“Keep going,” Tony heard Steve say in a dreamy voice, followed by a delicate touch of a lube-covered finger, caressing his shaft. “It’s beautiful, Tony.” Tony groaned. Steve increased the pressure, surrounding Tony’s entrance with his finger, while Tony kept stroking himself, until, without warning, Steve broke the barrier and slowly put the whole finger inside.
"Cap, for the ninetieth time, relax." Tony smiled. "They can handle it."
The drive back home from the police station was tense and silent, and Tony didn’t try to cheer the mood up. He knew that a lawyer goes through tests. A good lawyer goes through some of them virtually unscathed. A great lawyer doesn't even feel like he's undergoing tests. But one thing all lawyers knew: you don't fail the first test, whatever it is. The circumstances of each process determine what your first task, your first battle, will be. If you win, you show everyone your shiny and competent armor. If you fail, your armor shows its breaches and failures. And Tony had failed his first test. He had failed Peter and Steve.
"That's what you are, isn’t it?" Friday said. “Or was I mistaken?”
The man in front of him smiled back and took Tony's outstretched hand.
for myself what I always felt, and that, in a way, made things easier.”
“Are you there, Tony?”
"I'm a forewarned man," Steve said only.
Tony nodded, his heart pounding in his chest.
“Jarvis, open the vault. All access restriction codes override.”
Tony shook his head. He didn’t know how he would react to Steve so close after all this time, even if only a few weeks had passed for him and not more than an entire year.
Tony laughed, drank some of his coffee, and looked at Steve through the reflection in the window. “I need a shower.” He tilted his neck back to try to see Steve's face, who was looking down at him with a sly smile. “Actually, we need a shower. You promised me one when we woke up. Well, we’re awake.”
He could only think of that man on the roof of the building in front, who was thoughtful, looking at the stars, his face placid, his eyes shining, his golden hair almost white in the moonlight, and his lower lip accentuated forward. Steve looked so innocent there, but so lonely. Someone who had just been resurrected, after more than a year dead, must have been celebrating with many friends. But there he was, alone, lit by the moon, like a spotlight exclusive to him, accentuating the trait of Steve’s life that always hurt Tony the most: his inability to really fit. He never really looked happy, and Tony knew that because he was able to recognize Steve’s different types of humor. And genuinely happy was the rarest and most beautiful of them all.
The orb shot out, knocking into Steve's chest. It was glowing white now, and it dropped back onto the floor, and the light turned blinding.
When he’s done, he shucks the damned burning leather jacket and wipes his forehead with the back of his head. Second chances, huh? Steve knows, that whatever and however many chances he’s had with Tony, they’re all wasted now.
“I think he used his energy source in—in his chest.” Even Thor had lost his speech pattern, as he flew in, picking the girl up in his arms.
“He insisted on getting the treats ready,” she told him as he glanced around for Steve. “He...no, not him.” She gestured at the photograph Tony had been looking at. “My son was killed in action. Over a decade ago, in Afghanistan.” She walked by Tony, picking up the frame. “He jumped on a grenade to save the rest of his squad. Received a Medal of Honor for it. I remember the day the officer came to the building entrance downstairs. I nearly didn't let him come up.”
Steve thinks back to Avengers PR, and Iron Man having a knack for showing up at children’s hospitals. Of course Tony loves children, when Steve’s never felt entirely comfortable around them and their idolatry. But to Tony, they’re the future he’s working so hard for. Steve loves Tony so much in this moment, he’s momentarily stunned by it.
It hadn’t hurt when the Avengers had been a team. It hadn’t hurt in the two years after Siberia, when they were a empty husk mostly driven by hope that one day they’d be whole again. Steve wonders why it’s only now, after so much death and destruction, that his body decides that the heartbreak is too much to handle after all, and succumbs to disease.
To his credit, Steve didn't laugh at him. “What makes you think that?” he said carefully.
That won him a smile, even if Steve tried to hide it by dipping his head.
Tony made a look of disgust. “Why the hell would I do that?”
“Not many people know of the incursions, do they?” Reed asked.
“You should really consider making plans, for her sake. No better boy to impress the folks with, right?”
“You know, Tony would have done anything to help you.”
“That’s my childhood home, there. Oh, the countless memories of Greg and dear old Dad. Mm, there’s a reason I beat it the moment I could.”
Someone slammed a newspaper onto the bedside stand.
The Avengers return from their mission, but there’s no home left for them.
There’s so many words to say, but Steve only has to speak enough not to call his bluff. But, he thinks, it’s enough to say what he wants.
It’s quiet after the snap.
Steve raised his gun and began blasting before the Hydra agents could orient themselves. It did its part to fan the chaos, but the others eventually realized that amongst the blinding greens, the flag-sporting crew and red-and-gold robot were the threats at hand.
“Back to basics, Iron Man,” Steve told him. “You can't bring your armor to every fight.”
Tony’s voice was deceptively breezy, like they were discussing the weather. Hadn’t he nearly been murdered himself, by his fianc
“Forget the armor!” Steve snapped, and Tony clasped his hand over his chest, offended. Steve reached out and laid a hand on his shoulder, “are you hurt?”
Steve knew Tony didn’t care whether he sounded like an ass or not.
Steve wanted to say something back, to try to deny it, but what was the point of denial? His energy had been sapped from him. He looked down at his fingers. What had he done now, to bring wrath like this? He wanted the numbness back, the fugue he’d gone through, when waking up from the future, and from last night, waiting by Tony’s bedside.
“You’re right. I’ve been blessed with him, no matter what brought us together,” Gail said, and Steve thought that was the first time she even alluded to the end of the war. “But he’s been my partner for so long, I’m not sure what I’ll do when he’s gone. I've had to live with the idea, but that doesn’t mean I’m ready. But when you allow someone into your life like that, it’s a choice you make knowing that what your life together will be worth it, soldier or civilian.”
The universe is telling him, that he made a mistake somewhere, choosing to sacrifice the perfect love. She had believed in him before he believed in himself. The moment he downed the airplane, he had lost his chance for an idyllic life. He had never been meant to fall in love again, and his sickness is proof of that.
“I’m sorry!”
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand tighter. She was watching him, he knew, with his red eyes and unshaven face she had always complained about.
“What makes you ask that?”
Steve was tired of logic and practicality. He wanted to believe in a world where teammates meant a bond forged in blood and Ultimates fought more than themselves. He wanted to believe in the same future Tony saw.
“You left something.” She holds out his handkerchief in her fist. Steve reaches inside his pocket, but it really was gone.
Steve hopes they were good ones, but Morgan’s face betrays nothing but child-like curiosity as she stares up at him.
Tony sat down in front of Steve, thoughtful. “Okay, okay. Is this a boundaries thing? Was it that I didn’t ask beforehand? I figured the place is big enough and my room is sound-proofed enough that I don’t have to phone you when I bring someone back, like back at the dear old academy.”
But Natasha’s wrong. After five years, and after a glimmer of hope, Steve’s finally accepted what he should have years ago. This isn’t living. This is running away. Even if it hurts, he wants to see Tony, because with Tony he feels like himself. He feels alive. He doesn’t care anymore if he gets punished for wanting to live. He wants to see Tony.
“Do you accept American Express?” Tony asks sternly.
He jumped on the orb, curling over it with his armor, stifling its light.
Tony deposited Steve neatly on the roof. Steve dropped down as Tony whirled around, the sound of bullets ricocheting off the armor.
Tony could tell the force that he struck the wall with, the cracks he must be making in the lab on the other side, even though he could feel none of it through this side.
“So, the Iron Man I know is...Tony Stark,” Rogers said, testing it out.
What might have been even stranger was Tony's reaction, standing statue-still as Steve moved past him. He made eye contact with Carol, and apparently her incredulity didn't register with him as he headed for coffee.
“Tony...where's your shirt?”
The edges of Tony's lips quirked up before he drifted out of consciousness, and Steve couldn’t resist the urge to run the back of his fingers across his cheeks.
The monster was gigantic, a cross between a snake for a head with a tree for its body. When it walked, painstakingly slow, thick roots spread across the street, toppling light poles and turning over cars.
“Ugh, that’s foul.” Tony sighed, putting a hand to the floor and attempting to stand. Steve was there in an instant, lifting him up from beneath his shoulder. Tony swayed a bit, and feeling his slightly feverish skin press against his own, Steve was suddenly aware that Tony was wearing nothing more than a robe and his underwear.
Before someone cleared their throat, and Tony looked up, and held up his hands.
“Does that mean they're someone we know? An Avenger?” At least Kamala was excited.
“I’m not planning to leave,” Steve told him.
“I have no interest in keeping up a lie.”
“I know what you’re doing,” Tony said. “You broke up with Jan, you miss that sort of connection of living with someone intimately. But I never tolerated that bullshit. You can’t sit here and tell me what to do. Even if we were fucking, you couldn’t do that to me.”
“Why the
He can keep this. He can keep this against his chest, and it can mean something to him.
“Oh, my favorite.” He lifted the mug to his face, and sighed in contentment. It
“It was worth it,” Steve said.
Tony can't say why he does it. Maybe he needs reassurance, because for so long he's only had his own arrogance to fuel him. He doesn't know if it's strong enough to fuel an entire paramilitary force, to destroy his friends. Maybe he seeks penance. Maybe he wants something to finally see him for what he is, and to judge him on the truth, and nothing less.
Natasha chose to do this. They’d all chosen to do this, knowing what it could mean. And the only reason was because they damn well thought the payoff would be worth it.
“Look, Cap. No,
A long yawn greeted the two of them. “Good morning,” Tony called out as he shuffled in. From the corner of Carol's eye, she saw Steve freeze. She hummed a greeting to Tony as she turned to observe the other Captain more closely. Steve was carefully staring down at the countertop, before he let go of his freshly acquired new mug like it burned.
surprise her? Steve never had a handle on what Gail or Bucky thought about the Ultimates. They were quick to shush the grandchildren when they asked Steve about kicking the Hulk in the balls, or whether Thor really did shoot lightning from his hammer. He twisted his fingers around each other, strangely nervous, as he asked.
“Good morning.”
Natasha tends to say things like that, and Steve doesn’t get it. The way Natasha talks about the two of them gazing into each other’s eyes, or having deep, soulful conversations, it’s not
Rogers was tugging at the end of the school tassel hung on the wall. He hadn't said much since they’d brought Tony into the school.
“Not like that. Oh, Steve. I meant how surely you believed in love and what it could do, and how much you wanted it. You didn't let it embarrass you, no matter how badly you wanted to be part of the man’s club. That’s what drew me to you, back then. So, no, it doesn’t surprise me that your idealistic, romantic heart won out over everything else. Logic, practicality, whatever you want to call it.”
Tony kisses and wants to memorize it all, every little touch that makes Steve gasp into his mouth, every caress that creates full-body shudders. Steve kisses like he needs everything in their moment to last him an entire lifetime.
Because yes, Steve wanted to be on the same team as Tony again. He wanted things to go back to normal, and it's been so long that he didn't know what
Here, the light blinded his eyes, and his ears pricked high and alert as he scoped the room in search of what he came looking for.
“Good,” Steve said, grabbing a glass from beside the sink and filling it with water.
his home.
Steve's grip on Tony's wrist above them tightened, keeping it suspended, and Tony thought he'd swoon.
It did. Even here. If Bucky hadn't been at this place, at this time, then an entire town would have been kidnapped. Steve imagined a five-year old dropped in the middle of a Hydra base and fought an involuntary shudder. If Bucky hadn't been the Winter Soldier with all the experiences that had given him, would he have been able to prevent that? Steve averted his eyes.
“Is that, oh fuck, that’s Thor, isn’t it?” the man said, and Steve’s eyes remained fixed on the television screen.
Jan said. “When did that happen?”
“Do you realize how much it takes to charge the armor?” Steve demanded of Rogers.
And there they had it. Tony was getting all good and sentimental in his retiree life. And to think, he wanted to throw the holiday party here to raise everyone else's spirits.
The first time Tony woke up, truly woke up, Steve only knew because he’d memorized every pattern of Tony’s. Tony shifted, and his breathing became more regular, and Steve stilled, waiting for him to open his eyes. A few moments later, Tony slipped back to sleep, and for the first time in what seemed like ages, Steve could take a full breath.
"How about that incredible pasta you made the other day, Cap?" Peter suggested, pulling back his uniform of nano particles.
Even behind the armor, Steve knew the engineer was staring at him and his neck burned.
daughter.”
Steve’s hands came to life and hugged Tony around the waist, but soon they went through everything they managed to reach, until he reached the hem of his own shirt that Tony was wearing and pulled it up, leaving Tony gloriously naked, but now under a completely new and hypnotic light. Steve slowed his own movements and Tony imitated him, until they were with their heads resting on each other, breathing hard, unable to look away from each other.
do that, dad, please believe me," Steve felt Peter's tears wet his shirt, but he couldn't be more relieved. His son was in his arms. And he knew Steve was there for him. They were going to get out of that situation.
She shrugged.
Tony looked at him abruptly.
Wiping the sweat off his face, Tony opened the latch on the box and there it was. The flower. The red lily with its petals incredibly red as rubies.
He saw Tony nodding.
“Say yes.”
“What?” Tony was truly confused.
Tony couldn’t say no to the Captain when he asked for something. Then, knowing that this would be his biggest mistake, Tony stopped and thought that his heart was already too bruised, too numb, and that one more blow would make no difference. So, he waited.
He wanted to be the one that Steve would return to, the one that Steve would spend the day thinking about returning to, because Tony would be the one who’d make all the weight go off his back and make him smile when he arrived. Tony wanted to be everything Steve needed and he wanted to be the one Steve could always count on, to be the safe haven Steve had always been for him. Tony could be all that, right? Even without memory, even if he was full of flaws, even though he knew he’d never reach Steve’s perfection, he could still be there for Steve, right?
"Tony."
They both laughed and it was good. The sound of the two laughs mixed and Tony was transported to lighter and happier times, when the Avengers shared the Mansion that Tony had donated to the team to serve as their HQ. Those were times that seemed so far away now. So unattainable. So unreal. Tony was afraid that sometimes he was just imagining all those memories, that he had much more than just a part of his memory erased. What if he was imagining those happy times? No. He could never just imagine the laughter and game nights at the Mansion with Steve and the others. That was too precious.
“What is it?” Steve asked, turning to face him.
Steve should tell Tony how much he hated him.
"I don’t know if I want to know the details," Clint said with a nervous laugh.
"Oh, yes, thank you," Tony was still dizzy with the exhausting flight and the eight-hour time zone, but he still managed to smile at the man in front of him.
Tony heard Thor walk past him, laughing and landing near the Hulk.
“Done. May the best win.”
“I'll meet you in the common area in thirty minutes.”
And he wanted to be all that for Steve.
“Did you always smell that good?” Tony got close to Steve and, without any shyness, hid his face in his neck and took a deep breath, letting that smell dominate all his senses.
But was it possible? Tony snorted mentally at the absurdity. No, it wasn’t. Someone certainly should’ve already told Steve what had happened to Tony after his death, right? He knew about the funeral; he even knew it had been Tony’s idea. How could he not know about the memory loss? But there was only one way to confirm whether Steve knew or not.
“As you wish, sir.”
Rhodes shook his head hard. "No, uh-uh, Tony. I'm not going to be in trouble for you."
"Hey, beware of the excitement," Tony said, but he hugged Peter back with his free arm.
Tony laughed.
“Tony!” Steve screamed, in horror.
"I'm just thinking it's a shame I won’t be able to finish that trail," Steve said.
"I'm working on it, too."
"I wouldn’t even dream of it."
All this took no more than two seconds in Tony's overactive mind, that was approaching from the left side of the weapon, while Clint and Natasha followed on the right side, cornering the Scientist Supreme.
“Jarvis, scan the anthers of the flower.”
“I had just come back from the dead.” Steve frowned. “And one day I got a call from Bucky, telling me that I had to go find Pepper, that it was urgent and that it had to do with bringing you back from the dead. That you needed me. Thor went there too.”
The drum beats out of time--
“Tony, why did you accept my invitation to come in? Why did you come to spy on me?” Steve’s gaze was gentle, but he held Tony’s gaze firmly, turning Tony into a statue about to break with the vibration of his own heart. “Tony, what are you afraid of?” Steve inclined his head. They were looking at each other at the same height now.
Steve gave a sad little smile, as if he expected something else. “Me too,” he took a sip of coffee and composed himself. “And what happened to
"Thank you, Cap." Peter's smile was huge.
“Let's get out of here,” Sam called. “They might need us up there.”
"Less than before, but yes, I still drink," he replied.
"I what, my dear?" Tony was extremely curious now that Steve had suddenly stopped.
And Tony Stark tore the New York sky, invisible to anyone who looked.
With Pepper, it was like that, years of coexistence until he had the courage to admit that there was a feeling. It is a pity that the feeling itself was of pure brotherly love than romantic love. It’d never have worked out anyway. Thankfully, they both realized that in time to keep the friendship alive and strong enough for Pepper to continue in Tony's life and in the leadership of Stark Industries. The two worked much better that way.
"Yesterday," Tony smiled.
"I'm adorable," Tony answered for Steve, and took off, heading West.
“Liz,” Tony said and Steve saw the girl gasp listening at her name being said loud and clear by Tony. “Give us a chance to show that we can be good substitute parents.”
“Eighteen.” Her voice was strong, but also with a very characteristic softness and Tony found himself thinking he could listen to that girl talk for hours.
Before Bruce could respond, Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, and Thor came in discussing something that seemed important. The three side by side were an incredible view, which made it impossible to look away for a second. Tony already had his Iron Man armor covering his whole body, except for the head, Steve was carrying Captain America's shield on his back, but he was already wearing his helmet, and Thor was carrying his huge ax as if it had not any weight, with his cape fluttering behind him.
Tony agreed. “There was a funeral for you.”
Tony set his water bottle aside, stretched out his legs and hugged Steve with them. The soldier's eyes darkened.
Encouraged by the sounds of Steve, Tony finally hold the soldier's cock and, without waiting for a confirmation, he licked all that length.
“Did you find anything interesting that I should know?” Steve asked after a few minutes. His voice was amused.
, Chief Ross had said,
Tony nodded in agreement. "I just didn't know how to say it."
The alarm that sounded in the laboratory was deafening.
"Would we need any protection?" Tony had to be sure. "'Cause I assure you I'm all clean, sweetheart."
“Yes, I do” she said softly. “Now I see that you are the family my parents chose for me.”
“We can ask Natasha to try to investigate,” Wanda suggested. “She's great at it.”
Not bothering to reply the obvious, Tony kept working on the final additions of the ship. That was the only salvation of that incursion that already consumed half of the planet. No second could be lost with meaningless conversations. A few minutes later, Tony stepped out from under the ship, wiping his hands on his jeans. He stared at the man in front of him. Even after all those years Tony's heart still lost a beat whenever his eyes met his husband's: two blue oceans, which the engineer knew very well how to sail.
“Ask the question you want to ask,” Steve said in a low but steady voice.
How did they neglect that for so long? How they didn’t realize that they were perfect for each other before? How they didn’t realize that their lips were shaped to fit together like pieces of the same puzzle, Steve's hand fit perfectly into the curve of Tony's spine to put him at the right angle for Tony to reach the soft hair of the soldier?
Natasha smiled.
Tony took a sip of coffee and continued looking outside without really seeing. He found himself thinking about what Steve had said about that being a new start for both of them. What were the chances, after all, of both of them having gone through near-death experiences and returning to live, with all the reasons why such experiences were linked to them having almost succeeded in killing each other because they were too stupid to admit that they never hated each other, but actually that they have always loved each other? Tony laughed through his nose and took another sip of his coffee.
“You’re my best friend,” Tony said in a shaky voice. It wasn’t a lie. But it wasn’t the complete truth. But he couldn’t tell the whole truth. He couldn’t reveal that last untouched piece of information, that little piece that was still his alone. As much as it hurt, as much as Tony’s entire body screamed for him to speak the truth, he couldn’t.
He knew he was making a mistake by thinking that just showing up would solve everything. That a simple smile of relief and gratitude and…
Tony smiled and licked until reaching Steve’s earlobe, that Tony bit, making Steve shiver, and then whispered, “This is
"I expect you to teach him good manners," Clint told Steve.
the most. And only the aim of your desires can help you take the pollen out.” Tony slid his hands up to Steve's neck and left them there, his fingers caressing Steve's scalp.
“Just a few more minutes,” Tony shouted back, his head tucked beneath a large, oval metal frame with a transparent top. A ship.
"I'm down here," said Happy on the other side of the line.
"And you want us to go there to check it out," Clint said without emotion.
"I need some encouragement to get out of the air conditioning, my love. May it be to admire the beauty of my boyfriend taking a dip in the sea.” Tony smiled crookedly.
Here's the new chapter! I hope you like it as much as I like writing it (spoiler: my favorite part is Tony and Nat's talk. You'll see 😉
He didn’t realize where he was, not even that they had moved or that Steve had turned him the other way, until his knees hit the edge of the bed. So, he let his body take over control, since the rational part had apparently already short-circuited. His hands slid from Steve’s neck and hair to his strong chest, feeling every curve, every muscle, feeling his heart make his body vibrate, until his fingers gripped tightly at the hem of the t-shirt that Steve wore and, with dexterity, began to slide the fabric upwards, revealing the immaculate skin it hid. Without shame, Tony allowed himself to touch every bit of Steve he was revealing, delighting to feel the skin prickle under his fingers.
Steve thought.
Tony frowned. “I think you are the genius now, because nothing here is obvious to me.”
“Do you think you can take this away from the mainland?”
"The guest list," she said, and then a sequence of names appeared in the corner of the screen. Authorities, some friends, scientists, Nick Fury, Maria Hill and Phil Coulson with the new tactical team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and all the Avengers scattered around the world totaling two hundred people.
“What?” Steve asked, his arms hanging at his sides, his expression confused.
“Where did they go?”
"What do they think you do?"
Tony grabbed Steve's hair tightly and held him in place. “Please,
Forcing his legs to move, Tony turned towards the bed behind them, with Steve still in his arms, and guided him there. One, two, three steps and they stopped. Tony disengaged himself from Steve’s arms and mouth enough to push him toward the mattress. Steve fell on his back, offering no resistance, and crawled on his elbows until he reached the head of the bed, where he leaned, laughing.
“Hey, Tony.”
"The pasta I left for you." Steve pointed to the empty plate on the counter. "You ate it.”
“After the list, what else?”
Tony considered that statement. “I don't want your pity, Rogers.”
to remember Tony?
“Oh, my gosh, Tony, how can you joke right now?” Steve groaned and managed to let out a strangled laugh.
"For everything you have said and because I was watching the boy. He's kind and very intelligent. But not evil-genius intelligent. He's the hero-type kind of genius, who wants to help people. I talked to him."
"Oh, Fury, but I'm taking. I'm taking more than you realize.”
"This is so unfair," Peter said. "I've almost killed myself studying. I was stuck inside this Tower for days!”
"I don't know how much he knows. He was in the Army, but that doesn't mean he knows all the secrets. And if he doesn't, I'm not going to tell him."
“Well, then I ran as far as I could, but there’s a limit. I ran out of resources. He cornered me. I was without armors, with no money available, nothing but my last alternative that didn’t involve killing myself.” A shiver ran through Tony’s spine. “And, look, I’m a futurist. I prepare myself for the most different scenarios. I figured that one day I would need to do something like that, so I kept a backup of my own mind, but for reasons I don’t know, it was only updated to a week before Stamford. But it would have to do.”
"Why don’t you do the honors and help me?" Tony asked with a mischievous smile.
They left the kitchen and returned to the living room, sitting on the floor on the soft rug, around the coffee table, Tony next to Clint, Steve next to Natasha.
"Knock knock," Steve blinked, coming back to reality, and found Tony with his face free of the armor, looking at him with an amused smile. "Is my Steve in there?"
Three minutes later, all eleven Avengers were gathered around the unconscious but alive body of Ares.
"You and Falcon go to the other side and help Widow and Hawkeye. We need to stop this thing.”
Tony smiled.
“And who are your parents?” Natasha continued.
It had been a year since Thanos had come up with his plan to decimate half of the universe with the excuse of "balance." The Avengers, alongside the Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange and Captain Marvel, were able to defeat the Mad Titan and restore the life as if it was before his arrival - with a little help from the Infinity Gauntlet. That was why the Avengers had now returned to the Avengers Tower, but they had remained with all the memories, even the painful ones, and some modifications had been made in the team.
“I never wanted to be a martyr,” Steve said quietly.
It had gone too far. Tony needed to get out of there.
Fury pulled away and Tony stared at the popsicle. He shrugged.
“Guys?” Peter called. “That’s alright. I don’t mind, because I've really heard all sort of things out there. And I'm not a child anymore!”
On the underside Clint, Natasha and Steve were no better. Natasha's widow bites didn’t even tickle the hydra's legs, the ropes Clint threw trying to catch them weren’t enough and Steve could do no more than irritate the monster by hitting his shield at pivot points.
Tony found himself thinking. Steve was ...
Steve finally turned to look at him.
Steve sighed. “Before you go, I wanted to say one more thing.”
Tony's mind began to work frantically.
“You heard. Move it!”
After a short time, Steve pulled away and smiled.
"Besides, we deserve some time away from all that stress." Bruce said.
"Got it."
Tony tried to think of a funny answer, but he couldn’t. The normalcy and calm of that scene left him breathless. It was something he could get used to. It was something he
“A great friend of my parents offered to raise the egg,” the girl said.
"Then please, go get dressed."
"I can get so used to it, you know that?" Tony handed the other coffee mug to Steve.
"You saying you love me? It could be a sign in space, my love, I'll notice it.”
Tony smiled and hooked his fingers in the Captain's belt, pulling him close, ending any air between them.
"Five years ago."
,” she corrected herself.
Surrendering to curiosity, he opened his eyes and looked around. He was still in the Tower, but the light that woke him was not from inside the penthouse, but it was the sunlight. It was day already in New York, and sunlight streamed into the room, outlining the mess: scattered cups, napkins thrown over the floor, trays of food scattered about the coffee table, and several Avengers sleeping around the penthouse, lying on the couches, or leaning against them. Tony blinked a few times to get used to the sudden glare and looked where he was and smiled.
Until someone took it for me.
Tony leaned his head on the doorframe behind him and sighed.
“Stop with what?” Tony asked, out of breath.
"Not more than four." Tony shrugged trying to sound unconcerned, but desperately wanting the man in front of him. How could Steve be so cute and sexy at the same time? "Pepper needs me to sign a major deal."
A delicious shiver, which had nothing to do with Steve's touch, took over Tony's body.
“Oh, and
to him?" Rhodes's disbelieving tone hurt Tony.
“Excuse me?” Steve asked.
Tony stopped.
“Are you alright?”
Steve cleared his throat and swallowed. “What reason was that?”
Who was Tony trying to deceive? He was in front of the person who knew him best, perhaps more than Tony himself. Steve was fluent in the Tony Stark language. It was impossible to hide things from him for a long time.
“Yes, like that.
“Talking to you was like waking up in a dream,” Steve said. “You were still wearing the armor, that old one.”
"Would you be very angry if you had a party?"
She needed confirmation. She needed to know it was true, even though she knew there was only one way that girl could have endured a fight against Thor and Vision for so long.
Tony has never felt anything like that in his life. Of course, others had already passed through his life. Playboy fame hadn’t come out of the blue. But it had never happened before with that level of commitment, intimacy, passion, trust and, most importantly, love. It was as if in a minute Tony was on the edge of a precipice and, in the next minute, he was flying through the void in a million pieces.
Tony couldn’t help a weary sigh.
"The energy that emanates from the young woman is exponentially stronger than that of the ship, which leads me to conclude that, in a somewhat unrealistic way, the young woman is, in a way, the ship's fuel source.”
"Right away," she looked at her group. "Come on, everyone inside.”
"So it wasn't under your supervision," Tony said in a distant voice, lost in thought.
"Oh, come on, Nat.”
Tony's hands came alive, flew to the hem of Steve’s T-shirt, and pulled it up, revealing the soldier's glorious chest. Tony ran his fingers along the contours of Steve's muscles, making him shiver and return thirsty to Tony’s mouth.
“Yeah, there was that,” Tony agreed. “He also dismantled SHIELD and created HAMMER.” Tony chuckled. “The metaphor still makes me laugh. It was there, in everyone’s face, what he intended to exchange the protective shield we had for an offensive and dangerous hammer. But nobody seemed to care. Your death left a very big vacuum in terms of morality and common sense.” Tony looked deep into Steve’s eyes. “You were our compass. Without you, everything has lost its connection.”
But how to control Tony's effects on him? There was no antidote for Tony Stark. There was only one option: to get more and more numb.
“How much greater?” Thor asked.
"You're still going to have an attack on how much coffee you drink," Natasha observed.
"No problem," he smiled. "We still have plenty of time.”
"Natasha's been like this ever since she looked at the unknown girl," Thor said.
“You agreed to stay here,” Steve continued. “And we're very happy about that. I know what it’s like to wake up in a world that is not yours. But, like me, you have met extraordinary people who will do anything to help you.”
“Well, what changed was that you and I had a fight, I forgot everything, I almost died, and then I found out that you had died,” Tony said without stopping stroking Steve’s hair, but Steve opened his eyes, focusing on Tony’s. “At that moment, when I heard the news, I lost all hope, Steve. Outside I was impassive, telling everyone that I didn’t regret anything, that I would do it all over again if needed, but as soon as I came home at the end of the day, I would curl up in bed and cry myself to sleep, thinking that I would never see you again.”
“Thank you.”
Steve smiled. “I never knew who was who.”
Steve looked up and Tony lost his breath by how intense those blue eyes were. “I have. Many, many times.”
The Quinjet landed silently behind the David Geffen Hall, and as the rear ramp came down, Vision and Natasha followed from the right, while Sam took flight, and Thor and Clint went to the left, skirting the building from behind, heading toward the stairs. The plan was to surround the source and whatever was issuing that strange and potent energy signature, causing as little collateral damage as possible.
“The point is,” Tony was startled by the interruption of Steve's voice on the communicator. “What does this weapon do?”
Steve frowned. “What? How so?”
“I don’t know if we have a few minutes.” The voice was above Tony now, but still worried.
"Good morning, Mr. Stark," a middle-aged man poked his head out of the cabin and smiled. "Are you ready to take off?"
“Look, Tony,” Steve continued. “I just want you to know that you can
Tony thought.
“Take your time,” Steve said from the roof. “I’m going to go in and have something hot. When you decide, the door will be open and there will be a cup waiting for you inside,” he turned and went back into the apartment, but Tony’s sensors indicated that the door really was unlocked.
P.S.: this chapter has explicit content. ( ͡° ͜ ʖ ͡° ) You've been warned! :D
Tony suddenly had the best of ideas.
"Knocked out and well-done, I would say.”
We first met in circumstances that weren't exactly friendly, we didn't like each other at all in the beginning. At least, that's what all of our mutual friends say.
“Please, open the A.I.M. file. Let's start with it.”
Steve smiled beautifully back.
.. / .-.. / ..- / ..---
everything. What he was experiencing now wasn’t feeling. It was a cold, emotionless loan.
Peter smiled slightly.
. But I had made up my mind that I’d do everything possible to make up for that horrible first impression you have had of me. I wanted to be close to you, to love you, even if, for that, I had to pretend that I felt nothing but friendship. If that was the price to pay to have you around, I would pay.
"Sorry." He cleared his throat and straightened his back, but he didn’t shrug his legs. "I distracted myself.”
Tony knew how much damage the Registration Act and the Civil War had left behind. Steve’s death, his memory loss and Norman Osborn taking control of SHIELD were the prime examples of all that. Tony wasn’t an idiot. Losing his recent memory didn’t make him a stupid. He was still a genius who knew all that was at stake with that weird-haired lunatic in power, but he just couldn’t think of any of that.
“We...”
Tony took a deep breath, trying to organize his thoughts. The great and eloquent Tony Stark, fumbled with his words. Who’d say. "What I meant was that I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable with my comment, that's all," Tony blew out a breath. He felt drained.
"Don’t abuse, Stark." Clint passed him and went into the kitchen to eat a slice of pizza.
“Me too. You can’t imagine how much I wanted to get back early.”
"Okay," Tony nodded in agreement. And then he realized a detail. "Are we going to have to
“You’re a great storyteller.” Steve shrugged, trying to sound casual.
By the reflection of the window glass, he saw Steve smiling, holding the coffee mug Tony had brought for him. “I’m sorry.”
"The Chief is going to see us in a little while."
"You should eat something," Steve said from his place at the end of the counter.
Who knew I’d think of it as
“It was my idea, yes. I-I thought about what you would’ve preferred.” Tony Stark, stuttering, ladies and gentlemen. Enjoy the moment, it doesn’t happen often. Only Steve Rogers has that power.
Strange showed up the box he held. “I need this box to be safe until I get back.”
Tony felt his eyes widen. “What do you mean?”
were sitting a little further away playing video games and Sam was sitting on the couch behind Natasha.
"Isn’t it amazing that reality is better than a dream?" Tony snuggled back into the crook of Steve's arm.
“Maybe,” he thought better and completed. “Perhaps the link that bound her to our versions of the other dimension was so strong that it overcame that barrier and came down to us somehow. Maybe, instinctively, we already knew her, but not in person. Can you understand?” He made a lovely grimace.
Silence on the line. "What happened?"
"I'm trying to do that right now," Tony said. He made a face. "Well,
“Sure.”
“Hopefully a day of rest and good ideas in the lab.”
Tony sighed and managed to sit up, despite the nausea.. “I wonder if the concept of compatible applies to just one of the two people involved in such a sexual act…” Tony wondered aloud. “Besides, why not say
Natasha was typing quickly on the keyboard in front of her and Tony imagined what the spy's system of organization would look like.
She shook her head.
“I missed you.”
Tony opened his mouth to keep the argument, but closed it. He decided to make amends. “Probably not. I probably would’ve opened it anyway.” Tony shrugged.
"Hey, kid. You look awful," Tony hugged Peter by the shoulder and held him there. If he’d learned something from the recent conflicts it was that losing people is an extremely painful process. Tony had already lost Steve and that was like having his heart ripped out, but when Peter simply turned dust into his arms, Tony found himself without his ground, with nothing. That boy had become much more than Tony had hoped for, sort of an anchor, and then...
Tony didn’t know what to think. His brain flew, millions of thoughts at the same time, trying to fit into coherent reasoning. Steve was talking about what? Was he talking about the Civil War? Or was he talking about something else that Tony wasn’t told and that he should know?
“The force of the explosion sent us away. It just took a little while to get back,” Tony said.
Tony snorted. “I never got your message.”
“Aye. I will be back with you soon, my friends." Thor nodded and looked up. "Heimdall, portal!” A large interdimensional tunnel colored with the colors of the rainbow appeared from the sky and sucked Thor into space, disappearing soon after.
“I felt you
of the War to get richer, and in the end, people still saw me as the good guy. I let you die with people believing you were a bad person. I chased our friends. I created the clone of a god. I haven’t done a single good thing since Stamford, at least people can tell me, but I can only feel
The silence that followed was so intense that it would be possible to touch it. As they all absorbed the girl's –  Liz – words and related them to all other similarities more than clear, Natasha smiled. It was obvious that the Steve and Tony she knew didn’t have a daughter, so that girl right in front of her confirmed what were only theories and fantasies: that other dimensions, with other versions of us, in fact, exist.
“When I was still alive, still during the Civil War,” Steve said, without changing his voice, without approaching. “I told myself that I hated you.”
“Thanks for asking me in, by the way,” Tony said, lifting his coffee cup.
Tony turned and saw Steve approaching, his hand on his ear.
Tony held his outstretched hand and stood up, too.
Tony brought Steve closer, sticking their bodies together, and pressed his waist in Steve's, rubbing the two erections that were no longer concealed beneath the fabrics.
Steve nodded, because he didn't trust his own voice to say how much he believed what that stranger, who he wanted to know better, was telling him. Tony squeezed Steve's shoulder, calming him. "Come on, get yourself together.
Tony made his best innocent face.
“Hurry up!” Steve said urgently.
“Dubai, on behalf of Stark Industries.”
"Are you going to cook with me?"
Tony heard fingers typing furiously on a keyboard on the other end of the line. "I'm already working on it. Stay on the line."
"Were you
Steve changed on the spot. A smile broke across his face, his expression softened and he raised an eyebrow. “
“Where's Ares?”
"Good morning, Pepper, my reason for waking up at seven thirty in the morning. What can I
"A man who is not in my database and what looks like a three-headed dog," Friday replied.
“Thor!” Ares's voice echoed down 44th Street, which, thanks to all that was sacred, was empty. People were smarter after Thanos. “I was really waiting for you.”
Tony really wanted to be able to know if he was still welcome to get Steve’s real smiles out, but his heart sank when he thought about everything they had not so long ago, everything they said Tony said to Steve and everything Steve said to Tony. It wasn’t pretty. They didn’t end it as friends. Not even as colleagues. They ended that War as enemies who hated each other, who managed to get the worst out of each other.
"We could’ve passed this to him without a face-to-face meeting," Natasha said.
Steve smirked and squeezed Tony's ass one more time, tearing out a soft moan from him.
Tony grunted.
Steve was already outside the kitchen when Tony's body came to life.
Tony narrowed his eyes. “You’re a menace, did you know that?”
"Yeah. Me, Clint, Peter and Hulk stayed to monitor things around here.”
"Yeah, I know." Tony started to walk toward the door, but Steve took his hand.
"Really?"
“So we don’t have time to lose,” Steve said. “You heard Tony. Let's end this.”
Half an hour later Friday warned that the pizzas had arrived and that Natasha had already prepared the cards on the center table in the living room of the penthouse.
"This is a new A.I.M. base we have recently discovered," Fury said, pointing to the screen behind him. "As you can see on the map you have there, this base is on Rwanda's border with Congo at the foot of Mount Bisoke, a volcano.”
Steve stopped with his mug in the air, halfway to his mouth, and looked at Tony through the reflection in the window glass. “Can you really?”
"We can work it out if you want."
“You are beautiful,” Steve said after what seemed like eternity.
“Sir, unfortunately, your limbic system is invisible to my sensors, but making a correlation with other symptoms and hormonal changes, this combination can lead to an array of problems.” Jarvis started. “Such as increased sensitivity of the sense of smell and pheromone-processing, interference with memories that are strengthened by emotions, impaired ability to focus, increase in body temperature, mental confusion, impaired body movements, and these changes are certainly altering your libido, as well.”
“Not bad.”
Tony still didn’t feel worthy of that love. Steve Rogers loving Tony? It seemed too good to be true, but Tony could believe Steve. Steve would never lie to him, not after they agreed that it wasn’t worth hiding things from each other. In addition, they have always worked better together. Imagine if they were really together? All Tony’s dreams coming true? Too good to be true, but apparently it was.
With his hands still wrapped around Steve's neck, Tony brought him close and kissed him, feeling the softness of Steve's lips that he had always dreamed of, his short breath, and the delicious sigh he released when Tony outlined Steve's lips with his tongue, demanding passage beyond the softness. Tony wanted
"Vision, are you still there?" Steve called.
is my home.”
“I can’t believe it was like that.” Tony shook his head, punching himself mentally for that stupidity.
"We're coming to you." Natasha's voice appeared on the comms.
Tony didn’t know if Steve was simply referring to his wardrobe. It seemed to be much more than just “you can borrow my clothes whenever you want”. It seemed deeper and more meaningful.
With the coffee ready, Tony poured the boiling liquid into two mugs that he found in the cupboard over the sink, and went back to the bedroom, where Steve was still sleeping. Tony left Steve’s mug on the nightstand beside him, and went to the front of the huge window, admiring New York, already frantic. In fact, he had no idea what time it was, or whether anyone had looked for him, and to be honest with himself, Tony didn’t care. All that mattered was that bubble in which he was with Steve.
“And can I know why?”
Tony rolled his eyes, but he smiled.
With a painfully heavy sigh, Steve turned and ran toward the door. Trying not to think too much about what was about to happen, Tony looked out the window of the laboratory, to the literal hell the Earth had become. The sky was completely dark, but with no moon (God knows what had happened to it), buildings coming down, the ground cracking and exposing the boiling subsoil of lava, desperate cries, flying heroes still trying to save what was already doomed and all wrapped in a nauseating smell of sulfur and burnt skin. Shaking his head and refusing to look at the clock, Tony turned his back to the scene just in time to see Steve walking back into the lab and, to Tony's relief, accompanied.
“Boyfriend?” Steve's neck was turning red. How lovely he was.
"First of all, we need to get there safely." She allowed herself to look at girl at the back of Quinjet.
, esteeming him as if he was something of great value that deserved all the care, Tony finally felt something that he thought wasn't possible. He felt free.
“The Hydra?” Sam asked, shocked. "Since when did they have giant snakes in their arsenal?"
At the first ring of the deafening alarm, the three Avengers prepared themselves. Whoever had managed to get so close, by surprise, couldn't want anything friendly.
Tony’s brain was short-circuited. “Excuse me? How come you weren’t
The dreams made him wake up smiling, which was as unusual as Tony's sleep.
With those words, Tony gently slid his cock in Steve and they both groaned loudly when Tony was fully inside Steve.
“Please, do-
“You're beautiful.”
To Tony's luck, the next twelve hours passed quickly, and at exactly eight o'clock in the morning he was signing the two-hundred-million-dollar contract for renewable energy projects for Stark Industries and half an hour later, he was already taking off to New York with his heart leaping.
"Don’t be." He smiled. "Sometimes it's better this way, to admire from a distance.” Steve shrugged. "But what about you? You didn’t start this conversation for nothing.”
Peter smiled.
"He was away for many days," Steve tried to justify himself.
"With the anger I am for have been interrupted, I'm able to wipe out all those monsters and still punch Ares's face alone.”
“Was true.” Steve smiled and tightened his arms around Tony, bringing him closer to him, to kiss the tip of his nose. “That I wanted you? Yes. That I want you? You can be damn sure I do. And that I love you too? Yes, I love you too so much, Shellhead. And not because of a goddamn flower.”
"...I know, but it was the best idea I could have until poker came along.”
"Yes, I'm sorry. I know you didn't expect to see me yesterday at the police station and I didn't expect to see you there either, especially as the detective in charge of my case," Tony was interrupted by the arrival of the waitress, who brought a cappuccino to Rhodes and the double espresso for him. After she left, Tony took a sip of his coffee -
“Thanks.”
Tony smiled back and it was glorious to see how genuine that smile was, reaching his eyes, making them shine and wrinkle at the sides. Steve’s heart was filled with affection and a need above all others to defend Tony from anything that could harm him and get that smile off his face. He was even more beautiful when he smiled like that. And Steve decided that he would make Tony smile like that every day, because that was what Tony deserved. Steve would make him happy and loved.
"Everyone who can fly or reach the top of the buildings, climb up and look for any sign of destruction, smoke, debris, screaming people, sirens, anything. The others will search for land.
“Near the bar, talking with King T’Challa and Queen Ororo.”
Tony blinked with a sigh and looked at the flower again. “Exactly. That's right, J. I
” Tony was afraid his words wouldn’t come out loud enough, but he knew Steve would listen to them. Blessed be the improved hearing. “I’m sorry.” Tony turned and found himself at the entrance to the room he had entered in ... a lifetime ago. He slowed down enough to take a last look around, the room all framed by the intense moonlight that came in through the huge window just in front of him, he saw the door leading to the roof, where the armor was waiting, and the practical part of his brain put the puzzle together.
Vision did not respond immediately and this turned on a warning light on Natasha's head. It was not usual the android to hesitate, much less look from side to side, clearly unsure of what response to give.
Steve almost ran out of breath, but then Tony started slowing down, and they went back to more of a steady speed. Tony bent and leaned on Steve's thighs, letting his cock bounce free in Steve’s face. He ran his ass in kind of a circular motion, clenching his hole all the while, and Steve could feel his dick exploring his insides. “
Tony's mouth watered. Steve was an excellent chef.
"Well, so that's it," Steve shifted, looking suddenly uncomfortable, and headed for the door, stopping under the doorframe. "I'm going upstairs, take a shower, try to clear up."
“Oh, my gosh,” Tony said out loud. “This makes everything so much easier, Steve.”
Steve felt his face getting hot. "Only when I really want something." They were both silent, watching the Boston landscape pass through the car windows.
"Why do you think we're friends?"
“Aren’t you going to sleep?”
“Stabilizes, Tin Man. I'm good, but you need to do your part.”
"It won’t be easy, I'll admit. But,” he leaned over Steve. “I count on
“No,” the girl replied quietly. “I was the only survivor. My father's intention was to build a ship large enough to save our entire family, but the incursion arrived much before his calculations had predicted” she stopped and laughed. “It was the first and only time I saw my father miss a calculation. So he modified the ship enough that at least I could be saved. It was a very quick discussion and I guess I've never seen my parents agree so fast on anything.”
"But why did this thing end here?" Clint asked, wiping a sticky patch of hydra blood from his arm.
“Why didn't you ask Reed?” Natasha asked. “He has a lot more equipment that could protect your box and he handles these weird things a lot more than we do.”
He stared at Steve's back, which was still like a statue. He could hardly tell if the soldier was breathing. That could only be a joke on Natasha, right? He didn’t have a daughter. He didn’t have a daughter with Steve! What was happening?
of the War. Maybe
The afterwards scared him more than turning on the armor and leaving the hiding place. What would he say? Would he start by saying something or would Steve speak first? What would Steve say? Would Tony get hurt, no matter what? Was he prepared to take more pain?
” Calmly Tony fucked himself on Steve. “Just gimme some time to get used to it, ok? It’s gonna get amazing in a moment. I’ll fulfill my promise just like you’re fulfilling me right now.”
has been
“Thanks.”
See you soon <3
Tony went over to Steve and took his hand. Being close to each other was already natural to them. Touching, hugging, kissing, random caresses around the Tower, during training breaks, during meals, on movie nights ... No matter where Steve was, if Tony was around, they’d soon attract each other to the other like magnets and wouldn’t let go. It was as if they had been together for years. And, in a way, they always have. What was missing was being able to touch as they always wanted.
“It's a flower,
Tony was so frustrated. He wanted to go back in time and still have his memories. He wanted to go back and find a way to fight to keep them, to remember everything, to
"So now you and the other person are ok?" Steve could hear the smile in Peter's voice.
Steve shook his head.
something. But in the end, Steve just smiled tiredly and said, "See you in the morning, Tony, in the meeting with Fury.”
Tony adjusted the GPS on his cell phone to take him to the judge's office that Pepper had managed to sign for Peter's release, and after getting the long-awaited paper, he headed for the police station, not far from there. As soon as Tony entered the police station, Tony ran into James Rhodes, the detective responsible for Peter's case.
Smiling, Tony sat on the back on the lab floor, facing Steve. “Wait.” He spread his legs, and put some lube in his hands. After rubbing each hand on the other to warm the gel, unceremoniously, Tony circled his pucked hole with two lube-covered fingers and groaned. While he repeated the circular movements, with the other hand he jerked himself. Without waiting much longer, Tony stuck both fingers inside his hole at once. He threw his head back and closed his eyes, letting out a “Ah, yes!” and after that, he started fucking himself with his own fingers, adding a finger at a time, until reaching four.
Tony leaned back and propped himself up on his elbows, giving Steve a privileged view of his body and smirked. “Do you see anything you like, Steve, darling?”
"Alright," Steve grinned.
“Strange?” Natasha smirked.
“We don’t have any more time,” he said, pulling away and looking at Steve. And Tony was sure that the expression of pain on the other's face was a mirror of his own.
“And what did you do?” Tony asked, his strength draining. He felt like a spectator of his own life.
"Why is he staring at you?" Wanda asked softly.
If they had started under the blessings of the moon, waking up bathed in the warmth of the morning sun was like receiving the seal that made it all real.
not being able to tell. Mainly because I know that Steve, more than anyone else, would understand."
Wanda threw a bolt of energy into Cerberus's exposed right flank, which snarled and turned to face the source of the attack. Without giving the monster a chance to get close to Wanda, Steve threw his shield into one of the animal's front legs, which roared with three heads.
“How about that?” Steve released Tony’s back and, while one of his hands jerked off their cocks, with the other he massaged Tony's balls, down to the perineum and back.
“I love you, Steve Rogers,” Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair again. “It’ll be wonderful to share my path from here to infinity with you.”
difficult to focus himself on his task to talk to a seemingly drunk and horny Tony Stark. It was extremely… tempting. He was only human after all, right? “Strange was very specific about that.” Steve searched for Tony's eyes and they looked at each other. “What did that thing do to you?”
“And where is ‘there’?” Steve asked, looking away from the window.
“And what was it?”
“Where was your conscience, then?”
Tony approached the table and sat in one of the available chairs. Steve pulled the other one closer to where Peter was forced to stay because of the handcuffs and continued to hug his son. He would enjoy being around Peter for as long as he could. And Peter didn't seem to mind, because he was accommodating to the curve of Steve's embrace, taking over the space that had always been his.
Tony understood the hint, but he had no love for his own life. "He told me that you guys met during a mission."
Steve smirked. “Glad you liked it.”
Tony swallowed and took a sip of coffee. Maybe it was the caffeine finally working, but he could not say exactly what was going on there.
“Perfect.”
Tony looked away, hugged his knees - while still sitting on Steve’s lap - and went silent.
“You do not have to say it twice, Captain.”
As soon as he got in the Stark Tower at the end of another workday at Stark Resilient, a day that passed by him without him even remembering what he had done, and that he allowed himself to take a shower, his feet didn’t take him to bed or to the kitchen. He found himself walking straight to the lab and wearing the stealth armor once again.
Tony punched the marble from the kitchen island and stood up, rubbing his face, frustrated, irritated, hurt by the injustice that was all that. He walked in circles and ended up facing Steve again, with open arms, gesticulating like a crazy man. “All I have are second-hand memories and second-hand feelings from the most important moment in our lives to date. It doesn’t seem fair that I have a hole where painful memories should be,” Tony found himself shouting, but he didn’t care. He had been holding on since he got in that apartment. “I should learn lessons from these memories, it was all a mistake,
"This is not the best place for it. Come with us, Liz. We can help you find out where you are now.”
“Natasha...” Steve started.
"Of course," Tony said softly.
"No."
feel, I need to remember to know why I’m ashamed, why I’m feeling guilty, why I’m afraid to be here.”
"I need to tell Steve!" Tony said on the way to the bathroom, to brush his teeth and take a quick shower. After changing, with a clean suit, combed hair and a neatly knotted tie, Tony left the room excited, eager to tell Steve the news. But when Tony reached the kitchen, he came across a note from Steve, telling him that he had gone for a run, but that he shouldn't be long. Run, huh? Well, Tony had to admit that that whole shape shouldn't be coming from nowhere, and that running should help, but what a horrible time for Steve not to be home. Tony went to the coffee maker and poured himself some coffee. It was at the ideal temperature and Tony was delighted with the bitter taste of coffee. And, God bless caffeine, his brilliant brain had an idea.
we met during a mission, but he had his own agenda and I had mine. But we needed to help each other in order to finish what had to be done. He never knew what I was doing there and I never knew what he was doing there. I could’ve known, but I never wanted to."
Blinking a few times to adjust his vision, Tony tried to move and found himself with his legs stuck. For an instant of panic, his fighting side had already imagined that he was trapped by enemies and that plans would be needed for an escape. As he looked down, despair threatening to come up, Tony saw his legs intertwined with two others and then the memories of the previous night hit him like a cosmic punch (believe it, it is an extraordinary force). How good it was to be able to have memories to remember, even more memories as beautiful as those.
Still, Tony didn’t know all those details because he watched the news broadcasting everything live, including his former friend being shot. No. He knows all the details because he watched the recordings of that day, from all the cameras available to him, from all angles, for several hours and days, exhaustively. Tony knew how to recite by heart the seconds in which each action had taken place. From everything he lost when his memory was erased, to prevent Norman Osborn from putting his disgusting hands on the records of the infamous Registration Act, which were, ironically, all in Tony’s brain, from every detail, of all the details, this piece, Steve's death because of that stupid fight, was what he made a point of re-recording.

"Thinking about it now, it's not a bad idea," Tony finished his coffee. "We can take part in the holiday celebrations
"What do you think I am?"
“Nice. I thought I was going to be the only one.”
A chill ran through Tony's body. Steve's smiles, those sincere ones, always too fast, elusive and extremely rare, were the ones Tony liked the most, but he'd never admit it out loud.
"I do." He smiled. "But why now?"
“Of course.”
, when we trust each other. See what happened when we hid things from each other,” Steve waved his hand between them and raised an eyebrow.
Tony felt his chest ache when he saw the shield against the door, strategically positioned. The last time he had seen that shiny disk had been a lifetime ago, a life that no longer belonged to him, when he visited Steve’s dead body.
Tony felt his presence even before his sensors identified Steve approaching on his right side. They had been fighting together for years now and nothing seemed able to weaken the relationship they had built. Not even the divergence of ideas that divided the Avengers and made Tony and Steve stay two whole years without talking.

Tony looked deep into Steve’s eyes and he felt his eyes wide with panic. “You’re right. My goodness, you’re right. I’m the man stuck in the past. I ...” Steve raised his eyebrows and waited. “I became you,” Tony said in a choked whisper.
"I know that," Tony could hear the smile in her voice. "But why exactly?"
Steve laughed. "That's right," he turned and bent down to get a mold from the bottom cupboard, and Tony almost choked when he was hit by the glorious sight of Steve's ass turned to him. Tony could get used to that sight.
"You must understand that this isn’t
For a long time, Tony simply lay there, just feeling Steve’s body against his, his warmth, listening to his heartbeat, his steady breathing, indicating that he had fallen asleep.
