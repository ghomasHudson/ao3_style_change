“That would be because nobody knows about him at Xavier’s.” Daken told them. He paused and took a deep breath as he felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked over at Bucky who just gave him a small nod before Daken turned and left with his son.

Chapter 7- Rescue
Happy New Year! Hope you enjoy this new chapter.
“You were just complaining the other night that Tommy completely changed the formula you wrote and that Kielar altered a machine you were working on, and both turned out better.” Steve cut off. “Let’s go, bed now.”
“I’ll tell you later. It’s a great story.” Dakota smiled. Kielar and Steve walked in a moment later and the younger boy sat down in his spot next to Tommy again. “So, with Mara already having said yes earlier, that means we are all going?”
“Cute ain’t they. Both single too.” Desiree said before sipping her drink , a small smile playing at her lips. He looked at her with a slight glare, which only made her smile more. “Just sayin’, y’ could use a love life, it's pretty non existent.”
For a few moments it was quiet. Everyone just taking in what information they had heard, which really wasn’t a lot. A few of them were calming down from being a bit riled up to begin with. Tommy sat back with his arms crossed as Dakota leaned over and whispered something in his ear to make him roll his eyes, but he also seemed to relax a bit more.
It had been the time he had an identity crisis. That was something he didn’t want to remember. It was horrific, and the only good thing that came out of that time in his life was becoming friends with Kielar. He was lucky that he wasn’t bullied in school because of his name, if he had been anyone else, nothing he had done would have redeemed him. Tommy had not gotten away scot free though, there were people at their school that hated him. His name had benefits and downsides. He got away with a lot more than he should have been able to, but everyone knew it was him every time.
“Worthington?” Johnny asked before pausing. “Wait, Kielar and Tommy are dating?”
Dakota rubbed her eyes as she leaned back in her chair, still staring at the computer in front of her. She had finally received a brief message from one set of the West coast avengers, who had been in different locations at the time of the raid of their compound. They were holed up in a friend's home, a friend who had a sister working with a member of their covert team. It was one less trip that they would have to make and that helped Dakota a lot. The video of Tommy versus the protestors helped pinpoint the area they were in. She had been able to pinpoint a location they could hide out in. Dakota had been relieved to find out that Clint Barton had an apartment in the area. Now the hard part came in getting the two groups back to Canada discreetly.
“Hey,” Tommy said, sprinting toward the other boy. “Look, you are speaking a million miles a minute and I can’t understand you. I need you to slow down.” Kielar grabbed his head, still moving at a super speed as he dashed around the room. “Jarvis.” Tommy spoke to the AI. “Call Dad and Pops in here please, something is going on with Kie.
“Yes.” he said simply. “Do you need help?”
While Stark Tower was home to several members of the Avengers, it remained a mystery to others. Mara sat at the desk in the room Tony had given her three years ago when she had first come to visit. The tower still had many places she had not explored, but tonight wasn’t going to be a time for that. She was staying the night because James and Natasha were as well, but there had already been plans set with Francis. Natasha had known, and suggested she give in a little extra time before they would meet up. Mara had simply agreed knowing her friend would probably be spending a little time with his father after the meeting they had just had.
Blaine was a completely different story. He was at times very quiet and very reserved. He kept to himself a lot but when he was excited about something, everyone had to know about it. The first person he would go to was
(See the end of the chapter for
Laura walked out of the cabin on the defense as she heard sounds coming toward them. Aislin was at her side while she had Kestrel and Jayson stay with Charmaine. Her claws came out of her hands as she crouched down. Aislin brought out her own claws and moved to a similar position. It only took a moment before Laura stood up rolling her eyes. “It's only Akihiro and his boy toys.”
"Aww, Pizza," Clint whined, followed by a yelp from Natasha elbowing him.
"I figured a buildable one would be better so I could modify it, but Bruce had a certain model in stock," Tony explained, "Technically, I should still modify it, but it'll do."
Steve ran a hand through his hair at the sight, turning to look at Tony, exasperated.
"Just wish I knew which mail person it was. I bet you it was Stan. He's pretty up there in age and could've gotten mixed up." He murmured finishing up his plate.
Tony kept it in, slowly getting up and melting into Steve's arms, tucking his head into his neck. He bit back his sobs, body shaking as he gripped to Steve.
Tony grinned, marking more things on the side of the paper.
The blond leaned into the touch gently, turning slightly to kiss at Tony's fingers.
"I certainly don't regret making you a sap." Steve whispered, kissing lightly at the pad of Tony's thumb as it ran over his lips. "If it means you plan out amazing things like this. It'll be hard to beat for our actual anniversary."
Tony grinned at the voice, but his face dropped at Clint's expression.
"You can pick your after school stuff too, pipsqueak. Papa and I can find a bunch of stuff for you to do," Tony hummed, rubbing Peter's back.
Steve watched carefully, really tempted to reach out and grab the feet again if it got Tony to laugh like that. It was infectious.
"Mhmmm. Really weird," Tony hummed, grabbing the tiny bucket to scoop up water, "Close your eyes, honey."
Peter nodded weakly, slowly sitting up and looking at Tony.
Peter snuggled up to his penguin, blinking at Steve sleepily.
Steve followed suit, looking to Tony and taking his hands in his.
"You like that baby? Like when I play with your tits?" Tony teased.
"Rest. Right."
"Sorry, cold," he laughed, crawling back into the bed.
"Oh Steven, you say the damnedest things," he crowed, grinning as he fully climbed onto Steve to lay down, "I never said I didn't have
. I love you." He whispered grinding his hips down against Tony's gently.
He continued until he got to the end, seeing that Peter had drifted off to sleep.
He whimpered softly until the pain lessened completely, giving Steve the go-ahead by nipping at his jaw.
"Always good for ya', baby," Steve hummed with his accent coming through. "Always good..." He yawned sleepily, shutting his eyes and snuggling close to Tony and falling instantly asleep.
Tony raised an eyebrow, but didn't comment, beckoning to his son.
"You're okay, shh," he soothed, gently rubbing the boy's back.
"Oh, Tony..." Steve said carefully, holding him tighter and rocking him gently.
Steve nodded frantically, looking a bit bashful.
He smirked, tugging on Steve's shirt so he'd come down for a kiss. Steve kissed him back happily, cupping Tony's face and stroking his cheeks with his thumbs.
"Prob'ly. Don' wanna move, though," Tony mumbled, immediately snuggling up to Steve's side, "Too tired f'that. Too well fucked."
"We got that for you because you've been good, munchkin. You earned it. And you still deserve it." He explained. "You aren't in any trouble, baby. You were trying to do something nice."
"Yeah, thanks, Pep," Tony murmured leaning in to kiss her cheek, "You're the best."
"Ooo, you wore the black ones. Those are always my favorite on you." Steve grinned, pushing lightly at Tony's hips. "Over the desk, baby.".
"Evening, sleepy gills. Get you a power nap?" He asked quietly, Steve nodding in response. "Good, you looked pooped after we got you from the beach. You hungry?"
Tony bent himself over the desk again, whining at Steve. "Please Sir," he begged, practically bucking against the desk for friction, "Don't need much prep, just need you--"
Steve settled along in with Tony with a hum, playing footsie softly with him. "Of course you can ask me something. What is it?"
well."
"We were just happy because we'd like another baby to take care of along with you. But..." Steve paused, swallowing heavy. "We won't have another if you really don't want us to, Peter." He said softly.
"Yes sir, love it," Tony panted, eagerly putting his hips up in the air, "Love your hands on m'ass, feels so good--"
"I still have to make good on that promise," he murmured, kissing the edge of Steve's lips.
"Alright lil peep, lemme put this in the laundry room and then we'll go take a shower, okay?"
"Hey, Dummy," Tony murmured, petting the bot's claw before sitting down at his table, flicking up some new designs to keep him busy.
"Yeah. Yeah, lemme just-- here--" Steve leaned up with a soft grunt, scooping Tony up as he stood and settling him down carefully on the bed and under the blankets.
"It's a-- well, good question," Tony laughed, carefully putting Peter's clothes in the sink, "It's a steady stream of water that cleans you off."
Steve didn't hesitate to get up and start heading up to Peter's room. "Oh man, that doesn't sound good at all. Hope he's okay!"
Basically sex since I accidentally lost a half a chapter, so have fun until I can get the next part up!
"Almost done," He soothed, lifting the boy up onto his step stool, "Can you brush your teeth for me?"
you, and you think you're this fuckin' terrible father?"
"Noted." Steve sighed, running hands along Tony's back soothingly. "What all did you do? I felt something earlier, but I just figured you burnt your fingers or something."
Tony curled up, hearing Steve's thoughts filter non-stop through his brain. He gave Steve an eskimo kiss, sucking in a breath as he started to relax.
"Okay, okay." Tony chuckled, sitting with Peter on the couch. "This is the story of how your genius father met your hunk of a Pops..."
He flushed faintly, smiling lovingly up at Steve. Steve grinned over at Tony slowly, a truly thankful look in his eyes. They started to become wet at the corner before he nuzzled at Tony's side.
Peter hopped a bit happily at the thought, reaching up for Tony to hold him.
Not at all surprised at how hard he was, Tony slipped on a condom and lubed himself up, slowly lining himself up before pushing into Steve. Steve moaned as Tony pushed in, or slid in really. It was in just one smooth motion, the other just getting right down to it and thrusting slowly.
gets t'schtay up wate,
"Uh huh. Those is nice clotheses." He hummed nonchalantly.
"Everything okay?" Tony murmured, petting his hair.
"You infected me with sappiness," Tony murmured, shifting Peter so he rested on his chest, "Totally blame you for that one."
not to be like that around him. He must've got it through osmosis," Tony snorted, "And you throw tantrums too, don't try to put that one on me-- well..."
"This isn't the place to talk about that," he said quietly.
"Okay, pumpkin. We'll have to change your band-aids, too," Tony murmured, setting the boy on his feet before turning the tap on.
"There's a reason I'm in a hoodie with sunglasses in May," He pointed out, "I don't want to do anything public you're uncomfortable with, babe."
He had to go meet him. The warlock who lived in the outskirts of their sector. It was his only way.
"Yeah, I'm ready. That's why I'm over here now. You look good, Tony." He grinned, messing with his keys. "So, I was thinking we could take the bike tonight, if you don't mind those."
"A hundred degrees is
"Must be. Had a long day of science-ing, hm?" Steve chuckled, smooching the boy's head. "The house was quiet with you guys gone."
"Papa, m'sleepy," he mumbled, "m'head hurts."
"If all goes well, we'll be shopping for baby stuff."
"Dis way," Peter announced, dragging Steve toward the shark exhibit.
"Don't look so sad, lil 'un, I'll get you an ice cream after lunch," Tony chuckled softly, ruffling the boy's hair.
"That was so mean to him, Tony. Horrible." He laughed, smooching his husband's face.
"Dude, what's the matter?".
Tony and Steve get their house, and Steve meets the 'assassin friends.'
"...n-no. No, no, no--don't say that, Tony please--" Steve said, voice faltering on him a bit.
good stuff. I need to make you a Sex on the Rocks--"
"Go set it up, love," Tony smooched Steve's cheek, standing up from the bed.
"I'll be with you guys in a minute," Tony called to them, heading up the stairs.
"He said I was dumb f'having two daddies. Dat's what he really likes to pick on me for," Peter's lip wobbled slightly, "He said havin' two daddies wuz w
"Well no shit," Clint rolled his eyes, "We should put you back in the hospital for this shit, Tones."
Tony chuckled, kissing Steve's cheek and settling back down.
Tony laughed softly and sat on the edge of the bed, letting Peter crawl in his lap.
Tony went quiet again, eyes closing as he thought. "I'm gonna call around tomorrow," he eventually said, "And find a therapist. Take a couple months off, and see if I can get it together. I'll make this work for you, Steve. I'm going to try."
," he whispered.
"Peter, you know the tickle monster is my weakness. I just can't fight him off by myself." Steve said over-dramatically, falling over on the bed.
"I thought you were younger. You looked like you were, but you can never really be sure. Okay, your turn.".
He hummed while he thought as he let Steve check over the body, eyes glued to the arm.
"Everyone has them. Nothing wrong with it. Hell, I have a reoccurring one. It really hits me hard in winter." He explained softly.
better--" He paused. "We can talk about it if you want."
Tony could only whimper in response, eventually crying himself to sleep in Steve's arms. His snores were louder than usual, accompanied by the occasional whine. Steve tried to fall asleep with Tony, just feeling the man exhausted in his arms. He nuzzled the other's cheeks gently, wiping away the leftover tears before finally being able to drift off.
"Mhmmm. We still got--" Tony looked over at the clock, "An hour and a half and some. We're good.”
"M'head hurts," he mumbled, "M'all stuffy. Too much crying."
"Just make sure you always let Daddy know how good he is at being a daddy for me, okay?" Steve requested quietly. "He likes to think that he isn't good enough. Can you do that for me?"
"Mmm, poor baby." Steve soothed, hugging Tony close. "I know the feeling. I used to have so many bad allergies. Not so many anymore, but they are still there."
"Steve, I can feel your nervousness from over here," Tony looked over from the passenger side, reaching over to put a gentle hand on his arm, "It's gonna be fine, baby. Whatever happens, happens. It's gonna be okay."
He squeezed Steve's hand, rubbing his thumb comfortingly over it.
"Ooo, then we could have us a hayday, couldn't we?" Steve smirked. "Of course, I do recall that you said you were saving to do something on our wedding night, now that I remember. Care to enlighten me?"
"Shhh, let’s not talk about it," Tony murmured, smooching Steve's chest, "Don't let it bother you, love. Besides, you already got the best soulmate
"All right then. We're gonna have you brush your teeth and then getcha in the bathtub." He explained, scooping Peter up and booping his nose. "Had a long day, gotta get clean." He grinned.
He paused.
"Hey, don't talk like that. You're good at a lot of things," Tony replied, raising an eyebrow at Steve, "I'm the only self-deprecating one in these parts."
"Good? Just
Peter nodded softly, following Tony to the seats and settling on his lap as Steve headed inside the delivery room. The time seemed to go by so slow in the waiting, but eventually the waiting paid off as Steve came out of the room with a crick in his hand and a smile on his face.
“Flaaaare~!” U cooed back, purring from the pet of her trainer and warming from the touch. Her tail moved and wagged happily, a flash of something brown and light tan peeking behind it. That certainly caught Tony’s attention.
"All right, all right. Yes, Peter has earned it. Extra cookie
Tony pushed Steve to turn him around, putting his head in the blond's chest.
"C'mon slowpoke," Tony called, wallet in his pocket as he raced down the driveway.
"Of course, Doctor," Tony replied, grabbing his pipe before settling in his recliner.
Tony placed kisses all over the crown of Sammy's head, happily pulling the baby to his chest.
"Hmmmm yourself," Tony chuckled, reaching up to pet Steve's hair, "We slept a long time, baby. You'd be upset if I let you sleep longer."
He stared at the swirls of blues, reds, and greens all over in their living room.
"Nope, not threatening. Promising," Tony amended, pushing his plate aside, "Since you like to backtalk me."
"Apparently, Peter's teacher before we started homeschooling him had said soulmates are gone. The last ones known were born in the 90s." Steve murmured. "He was so amazed by the fact of us being soulmates."
"I was laughing so hard in the store, Steve, you have no idea," Tony cracked up, eagerly kissing Steve back, "For the not-so-virgin Virgin? Good God."
The little click of the door unlocking was a bit of a surprise, but he gave Peter the chance to get away from the door, stepping in and closing the door behind him. Tony crossed his arms, rubbing a hand over his face.
when expressing his love. Next to my room. With his door open."
"He's doing much better, and he's down to 99.0," She informed them, smiling as Tony signed the discharge papers, "He needs some sleep, and he should be better by the morning."
"You can ask him in the car," Tony pointed out, leaning down to smooch the boy's head, "Be safe, and listen to your Aunt and Uncles, okay?"
, Tony thought, stiffening slightly in Steve's arms.
After about half an hour, Steve was a little suspicious. Peter was quiet. He cleaned his paints up and headed toward Peter's room, not finding the boy.
Tony hummed in agreement, jaw grinding as he actually started to pay attention; Steve's warmth made him melt, keeping his anxiety at bay. Steve held onto Tony's hand as they watched, flinching slightly at a few of the jump scares in the movie. Not scared, just surprised as the movie went on. Tony clenched and unclenched the hand not held by Steve, eyes flashing at predictable jump scares. He burrowed more into Steve, more than happy to just sit with him.
"Oh." He said simply. "Yeah, that may be a while yet, but that's a nice idea..."
"You're okay, sweetie," Tony soothed, grabbing Peter's favorite pajamas before heading to the bathroom, "It was just a little misunderstanding and you're not in trouble."
Steve huffed a small laugh, petting Tony's hair.
"Thank God." Steve breathed, leaning down and kissing at Tony's face as he tried to calm a little. "I do think we are soulmates. Our marks are so specific. And I felt it. When we first made physical contact, just the brush of our hands. The connection, I felt it." He whispered softly into Tony's hair.
"The only tantrum I can really remember is when we got up late, and you were gonna go into work," Tony grinned, "I went
"M'not
Steve grinned widely hearing Tony laugh, continuing the raspberry to keep hearing it. He only stopped when the man had a harder time breathing.
"I hope you like it," Tony mumbled, hand on the back of his neck, "I wasn't really sure what to get." He tugged at the pajamas he'd changed into, a shy blush on his face.
"I think he's more upset that he thought you were pregnant," Tony chuckled, standing up, "He's got my complex, that's for sure. Doesn't like being wrong."
She shrugged, a smile on her lips.
"Sounds good to me. I'll see you and Pete soon and we'll get comfy."
Peter just looked up at Tony innocently, wiggling further into the warmth. "What?"
"Hey," He started, "when you found me the first time, did you happen to see a piece of armor that looked like a face lying around?"
"Right. Nowhere to go but up. As long as you do it all to feel better, that’s all I could want for you." He hummed gently, giving one last kiss before going to get dressed.
awkward when I ask you to put your cock in me--"
"We got collars because I feel like a dog?" Steve looked up, a quizzical grin on his lips.
"I don't doubt it, Stark. Not at all." Steve hummed to himself straightening the paper as he thought. "Seven letter word for a creature with a piercing and horrible screech."
"Horrible. You're horrible," Tony grumbled, pouting when he took his ticket, "You're gonna pay for that later."
The comic 'n da superheroes is our special thing..." Peter pouted, eyes a little wet. "Besides, Sammy is too little ta be a superhero. He can't even talks yet..."
"I have a bad-- everything. Upper respiratory. I broke my-- whatchamacallit," he waved at his chest, "Breastbone, that's it. Broke it when I was twelve-ish, had to have major surgery. Didn't know this would be the effect," He laughed, kissing at Steve's knuckles
"If you could do it with just him, I think it'd make his day," Tony murmured, smooching Steve's cheek, "I'll keep dinner going, you go play with baby bear, okay?"
," Tony grinned, kissing up Steve's neck, "Been such a naughty boy lately--" He left bites down Steve's jaw, drawing him in for a lazy kiss.
"I weigh less, so yes, technically," Tony murmured, running algorithms in his head, "I mean-- was that an invitation?"
"I know, love, I know," Tony murmured, finally grabbing the lube, "Patience."
"You'se gonna make Papa weally Capt'n 'merica, too?!" Peter said even more excitedly, hopping in place. "Den you'se both would be like real supahewoes!"
"It'll be okay, Peter. Papa's got ya. We'll get you cleaned up and taken care of, all right? It'll be okay."
"Well, I mean, little kids can't bathe by themselves, Steve. Not safe." Tony rested his head on Steve's shoulder, hand on Steve's abdomen. "I love this place," he murmured.
"Hmm... Daddy?" Peter asked sleepily, Steve hushing him gently.
The blond thought for a moment, his stomach deciding to answer instead with a loud growl. Steve gave a bashful grin, placing a hand over his stomach.
Tony was quiet for a moment, unable to believe he so easily just admitted that all to Steve. Maybe because Steve had no judgement towards him like everyone else. It made him easier to talk with.
"Hey, Tony?" He asked out quietly, flipping through a few more pages of the same subject drawn "Are we together or anything? Like a...like a couple?".
With each bandage, he left a small kiss on top sweetly. "There. All done, Daddy." He proclaimed, snuggling into Tony.
Steve shivered slightly as Tony's fingers trailed down, hips twitching back a bit at the touch."Always will be good for you. To you. Always good." He hummed.
Peter made grabby hands up at Tony, who sighed and shifted Sammy to one hip, picking up Peter and setting him on the other.
"Papa's silly," Peter whispered up to Tony, giving Steve a wary look, "Or he's weally tired. Does Papa need nap time?"
Steve leaned back in his chair, a warm smile on his face.
"How come you look so nervous?" Steve asked curiously, watching Tony work. "You're doing perfect, Tony."
“I hate you both.” Steve huffed, resigning to the laughs of all the brunets in the room.
"You make me feel safe and at home, like you're a best friend I've had since preschool. You make me happy just being you and make me smile when I think of you." He explained gently. "You're one of the best things to happen to me. And I know I sound like a sap, but what do ya do?"
"Should I go talk to him?" Steve asked. "I really wasn't meaning anything by it all. I don't want him upset."
"G'morning." Steve hummed happily, nuzzling Tony's cheek sweetly. "Sleep alright? Are you sore? 'Cause, I'll go get you some aspirin if you need it?"
"Hey, this is off topic, but I thought about it earlier." He started. "I figured that since we have our own place now, maybe we could invite just your mother for a few days? That way you can enjoy time with her and I can meet her without Howard causing trouble with the meeting, y'know?"
He blinked his doe eyes up at Steve, jutting out his bottom lip.
Tony rolled his eyes with a smile, reaching behind with one hand to unlace it. He took a deep breath, laughing softly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"And possibly marriage counseling," he continued quietly, "So someone else can help me--us--do this. So I don't feel so alone."
Steve turned and smiled at the scene when he heard the two come upstairs.
"King Baby?" Tony joked, laughing, "Oh my god, Steve. I love that picture so much."
"Yes I am," Tony grinned, "Proud I am, too."
Steve panted softly, wincing a bit as he lowered down. "Jus' cuz muscle weighs a lot..." He murmured, sighing in the water. "Y'comin' in with me?" He asked softly.
Tony laughed and followed them upstairs, letting Steve get comfy with Pete before crawling into bed. He slowly stroked his fingers through Peter's hair, resting up on his elbow.
"Oh my god," Tony grinned, "You managed to sneak a party past me. Kudos to you, Rogers." He hugged everyone, laughing at Bucky's glare. "Ohh, Buck, don't be upset I gave your number to a hot chick," he giggled.
"Get him that bunk bed he's been asking for," Tony whispered, "Give him a desk underneath it?"
"He is probably just happy it’s a different taste than formula." Steve laughed.
"Make sure to clean the trash can," Tony called, "I'll clean up in here. Love you."
Peter was still open-mouthed from his place on his bed, taking a millisecond to absorb it all before leaping onto the hammock, cheering as he swung, gasping loudly as he noticed more things around the room.
He moved to carefully unbuckle Peter, scooping the boy up carefully and grabbing a few bags to carry inside as well. Steve sat the bags down and started to carry Peter up to his room.
"Considering we have our first words permanently plastered on our bodies, I'd say it’s a pretty good sign we love each other," Tony drawled, lifting his hips up.
He smooched Steve's chin, happy to tangle their legs together.
"Please," Tony whined, "Need you--"
He gave Peter his plate and sat back down, looking to Tony. "I can't wait to get to do all that. I'll get to sing him to sleep."
Tony grinned and held the boy down until his face turned red from laughter. He leaned down to smooch the boy's nose before pulling back, watching Pete gulp down air while he giggled. Steve watched with a smile when things calmed down, using that to drive away the last of his nightmares.
He nodded, kicking his feet again.
He set Pete down to dry him off, quickly ruffling his hair before helping him into his clothes.
"All right. But it’s not my fault if he starts crying. He's really attached to Peter." Steve admitted, reaching to pick the baby up.
"I could be asking you the same, Stark.".
"Okay." Peter leaned against Steve until he was put down in the kitchen, eagerly running over to try and pull the griddle out by himself.
"We're hoping these will settle his tummy, Daddy." Steve explained, letting Peter sit on his lap as he ate his crackers and drank a little juice. "He threw up, but he did it in the trash can, so he did good."
"I want to know for your punishment." He stated softly, running his hand up Tony's back. "Need to know how many times I have to spank you, Tony."
"Dunno," Peter replied as they walked down the aisles, "Nothin' girly."
"And he will find out later.
"Okay." Steve sighed deeply, as if he was about to say something difficult for him to voice.
"Or I'll tell my friend Peggy you use such words, and she'll kick your ass." Steve chuckled. "Besides, you'd enjoy too much if I spanked you." He grinned back.
He grabbed Steve's hand, lovingly smoothing his thumb over Steve's wedding band.
Tony didn't scoot over when Steve opened the door, unflinchingly staring at the Doctor's backside as he crawled over him to sit in his spot. He shut the door and whistled at the driver, still thinking as the carriage lurched toward Baker Street. Humming, Tony put his arm up around Steve, staring out his window in thought.
Tony moaned, loud and unashamed as he rocked back onto Steve's fingers, cock throbbing from the arousal pounding through him.
"Ready." Steve answered back, taking Tony's hand in his. "We'll be back, Peter. Be good until then." He said, giving the boy a smooch as they headed into the garage to the car.
'Tony?' The brunet heard, snapping him out of his thoughts and causing him to turn towards the blond quickly.
"Peter? I need you to listen to Papa and I," Tony started, "He and I need to explain stuff to you. First off, we are not getting divorced, nor are we
"Nothing, dear. Nothing at all." Steve chuckled with a grin.
"You're fine, Buck." Steve chuckled as he fixed Peter up. "He fell as he was running to us."
do this?"
Steve looked at Tony with confusion.
Tony groaned softly, rolling his hips back to meet Steve's fingers.
Tony gently closed the door behind them, smiling fondly at Steve.
"Y'silly, Papa," Peter giggled, hopping off Steve's lap so he could stand.
"Looks like I won't be wearing this as often, anymore." Steve sighed, tossing the uniform away and crawling in behind Tony.
"Cute and manly," Tony offered, sighing happily, "Toootally manly. So manly. Like motor oil. And cars. Yep." He grinned, turning to nuzzle his face into Steve's abdomen. "Damn son," came his muffled face, "You got, like, an eighteen pack?"
"Okay. Okay..." Steve repeated, looking down at the blade and back up at Tony. "You just want me to put it somewhere? Not just...get rid of it all together?"
"Yeah, mhmm." Tony rolled his eyes again, tapping at Steve's chest.
"Where's yer mommy and daddy, papa?" He asked softly, reaching out to tug on Steve's shirt.
"Hey, bud." He yawned. "How... How'd you get out of the bed?"
"Y-yeah." Tony stuttered back, because how was this really his life right now? He was starting to get jerked off by a former merman who was looking at his dick like it was the greatest thing he had ever seen.
Steve joined them at the table with a smirk, biting into his food. "Glad to hear you had fun, though. What did you do, Bruce?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know you've been through so many bad things and can remember them, and I wish I could take it all away." Steve pleaded, holding both Peter and Tony close. "But maybe when those memories try to resurface, you could think of the good memories you have with us? That's what is happening now. What happened then can't be changed, no matter what. And ending everything is definitely gonna make it worse for you, baby. You'd regret so much and never have peace that way."
"Bye Ms. Sharon!" Pete called as he was pulled from the room, waving until Tony scooped him up.
"It's elementary my dear Rogers," Tony hummed, tipping his chin up, "Only the most complicated puzzles are the ones worth solving."
"I may not remember if I truly did have a crush on you before, but I have a strong feeling that I did. Because I can still feel it. And it feels about the same as you describe it." He stated warmly, chuckling gently. "And I think I'll remember. Doesn't amnesia just make you forget before and not what happens after?".
"Yeah, yeah," Peter frowned, "I wanna go see deh penguins."
Steve.
"I'm sorry. I always seem to manage to make things sound different than I mean for them to..."
Tony waved his hand at the ceiling, not taking his eyes off his work.
Steve pulled Tony into a hug, nuzzling into the crook of his neck. He kissed along it lovingly in an understood thanks. Tony gently wrapped his arms around Steve, slowly massaging his thumbs into the dimples of his back while kissing Steve's collar, sucking on the bones to leave red marks dotting his skin.
Steve gave him a kiss back, reaching up and playing with Tony's hair.
Steve had another quick couple of sneezes before deciding to carefully try and venture out of the tub and grab a towel to dry off. When Tony was done making the bed and covering it in piles of blankets, he popped his head back into the bathroom, smiling at Steve in his pajamas.
"Get your rest, kid..." He whispered, kissing the top of Tony's head before settling in and following the man in sleep.
"Mmm--" Tony mewled into the bed, softly rocking back against Steve. "Need you, babe," he breathed, rolling his hips eagerly.
have and never would, baby. Please don't-- If--If I lost you, I--I couldn't-- I don't even want to think about it."
"Yeah, yep, totally," Bucky nodded, smoothing his hair down.
"Peter, baby--"
“So here, basically." Steve joked. "But that would be fun. As long as we could go out and sight see a few days out of it. I'd like to see the location we're spending money to have sex at." He snorted into tan skin.
"I think that'd be a good alternative to my--yeah," he motioned to his leg, "I mean, it would work. I can tell you that much."
"If he does it again, then he'll be in trouble, but it’s already been done." Steve sighed. "I mean, he's teaching his five-month-old brother to
At the boy's nod, he petted his hair, giving his forehead a kiss.
The boy nodded softly, looking to both the men.
"That's all you need to do to start. Just step and sway in tempo, and you're on your way.".
, birdbrain," Tony tsked, laughing when Natasha smacked him upside the head.
"It's all planned, but I
"What do you want me to do, babe?"
"Good luck. The guy is a stone-cold Nazi, I swear." Steve explained, searching for a clean uniform and swiftly putting it on. He had to be sure everything was put on straight, putting on deodorant and some cologne to cover up the sex smell a bit.
"I'm gonna go work," he said over his shoulder as he escaped the room, deciding to hide in his work.
with me.".
"Honestly, that does sound like something he'd do." Steve murmured, looking to Tony carefully.
"Guess
"Do humans have names?"
"What's your major, by the way?" He asked, as he went to sip his tea.
"Yeah... For good," Tony hummed, secretly wiping his misty eyes.
"Tony? Wha-- Why'd ya stop? Whats the matter?" The blond asked, clearly a bit breathless.
"This place honestly has more than I thought a place could have." Steve hummed thoughtfully, sticking close to Tony. "It’s overwhelming for someone who isn't used to all of this."
The blonde shook his head in denial. There was just no way... Was there?
"Y'minute starts....now," he prompted, tapping on his alarm clock.
He kissed the boy's temple, sighing softly.
He leaned back into the couch slowly. "Whenever you decide you want or need to talk to us, just give us a shout eventually."
Steve leaned over and smooched Tony's cheek. "I've got it all sorted out, don't you worry." He hummed confidently. "Who's to say I don't already have a cake made for you at home?"
"Clint, man, I've missed you, dude. You and mama spider," Tony laughed, "Which reminds me-- Clint, Steve Rogers. My soulmate. Yeah, that's right, that hot mess is
"We'll be back in a few hours. Three tops, if we don't fall asleep," He hummed, lacing their fingers together, "You have our numbers--"
"Can you carry me?" Tony mumbled, "I don't-- God, everything aches like hell."
"So, what sort of appointment do you have today?" Steve asked curiously, drying his hair before wrapping his towel. "Usually you only can go by yourself, so I was just wondering."
"Scared the heck out of me, too. That’s like the one thing I am still allergic to." Steve admitted, turning back to Peter.
Oddly enough though, he felt okay about it. With Steve, this felt right. What they were doing should be fast by normal standards, but it didn't feel rushed at all. They only had the summer for certain, at least with Steve as a human. If and when Steve had to go back to the ocean, would the other still want to see him?
"I don't think you will have to worry about that. He's probably thinking the same thing you are. If that's the case, you have to test the waters. Or if you wanna be bolder, trying acknowledging it by placing it in conversation.".
"You're already hard for me babe," Tony purred, gently stroking his hands up Steve's inner thighs.
"I am." Tony stated, a smirk growing on his face.
The next few weeks flew by; the lab was completely covered in grease and sweat, hard work and frustration thrown into upgrades for Dummy, new projects, and tinkerings for his AI system. Another 2 AM binge had Tony awake and covered in oil, blinking rapidly at the clock next to his computer. "Just another hour, then bed," he muttered to himself, eyeing the birthday messages already filtering onto his phone.
"Mmm, both," Tony chuckled, "Also, different place. But you felt that."
In Steve's opinion, A human is a human no matter what they are made of (or how heavy). He struggles to pull the body up to the surface, but manages to drag it up to the nearest beach. Steve sets the body in the sand, on its back and as gently as he possibly could. He examined the human, its body was red and gold (which Steve found strange for what he had heard about humans) and there was a blue light shining bright from its chest. That is what mystified Steve the most. He had never saw anything like it before.
Steve just continued by kissing along the back of Tony's neck and his back, leaving them all soft and sweet with a grin on his lips.
"Now, let’s go to the bathroom so I can see your burn, Tony."
"Ooo, they have apples and cinnamon." Steve pointed out, grabbing a box and putting it in the cart. "We are trying these just because I find these ridiculous." He said with a chuckle.
"I figured that'd spark your interests." Steve grinned as they settled on the sofa, cuddling up under the quilt.
"Yes I am, if you want to learn?" Steve said with a smile, joining the others on the floor. "We can start with something you would like to learn to draw."
He gasped breathlessly, body responding eagerly to the stimulation.
"Well good think I'm tall, huh. I'll help you out." Steve assure with a grin, setting the boy down once they reached Peter's room.
"Alright. Count me in.".
"That's good. But calm down, Tony. You got him here. You did good, baby." Steve whispered, giving Tony a kiss for comfort. "We didn't know and sadly one of the only ways to find out allergies is to be exposed to it."
Tony rubbed his arm reassuringly, leaning up to kiss his forehead.
"Because we aren't ladies and can't produce milk, Peter." Steve said simply, bringing the formula over to Sharon.
sore, now..."
"Mhm," Tony hummed, grabbing the washcloth to start gently scrubbing the boy down, "Lemme know if anything hurts, okay?"
"Good thing I'm not walkin' much tomorrow," Tony murmured, gently kissing at the bite mark on Steve's neck, "Sorry about that, I really didn't know how else to silence myself."
"It'll happen when I have a work day at home, with eighty tons of paperwork," Tony snorted, "It's a good relaxer."
Peter waited a beat to let his Papa settle before running out of his hiding spot, roaring as he jumped onto Steve's chest.
"Papa?" He slurred.
"Now I
"No, Sammy. That's daddy." Peter giggled, at the baby. "Daddy.".
"Yessir," Tony slurred, gently pushing his hips up into Steve's hand, "Can't help it when you touch me, Sir."
at it, I know it."
He grinned, winking at Steve.
"Thank you," he mumbled, curling up and falling asleep on his pillow.
He smiled softly, immediately threading his hand into Steve's hair.
"You have? So he's real?" Tony asked hopefully. "Where did you see him?"
Tony sighed softly, holding back his giggle. "Alright, alright. I'll be good," he mumbled, kissing him back. He quickly changed into his day clothes, grabbing his tablet up from the table. "Wanna go upstairs and paint?"
Tony turned doe eyes up to Steve, sticking his bottom lip out ever so slightly.
"Hey kiddo, you're startin' to repeat stuff, hm?" Tony smiled, brushing the boy's fine hairs aside, "You understand things?"
"Squishin' me--" Tony laughed, leaning up to kiss Steve. "Yeah. Once he's better, we'll sit down and talk. Too much change might be too much for him."
Steve still wasn't buying it.
Steve looked up over at Peter from the touch, reaching up and placing his hand on Peter's. "I love you, Pete. Very much."
"That's why he thought we always argued." Steve said with a chuckle himself. "I explained the whole soulmate situation to him so he would worry about thinking we'd separate." He hummed, a question striking him.
"Fuck, fellatio? Really?" He wheezed, shaking as he continued to laugh, "Any word, and you picked
"Oh god," Tony snorted, "Yeah, yeah. I usually keep it around in case I get curious again. It's in the closet." He nodded, taking Steve down aisles and aisles of dildos.
"I get to have my own drawing stuff? And then we gonna watch a movie togetha? Is Sammy gonna watch too?"
Steve looked to him softly, giving a small sigh. "Tony, I didn't mean that." He said softly. "Honestly, there isn't anything that I hate about you. At all. I don't like that you aren't able to see your good qualities, but I know that isn't really your fault."
Stevee hummed into the touches, leaning into Tony's hands.
"You're welcome, munchkin. But don't talk with your mouth full, please." Steve answered, mixing up formula for Sammy to eat.
," Peter whined.
." Peter stated simply. "An' it looks funny sometimes. Like youse tryna eat 'chother's faces. Looks slobb'ry."
“Well, you can sleep over tonight with us if all goes well, if you want. Get paid back on that heat, ‘cause furry Cap is like a huge furnace.” Tony offered up, grinning wider at the second groan coming from the blond.
has a sweet tooth," he teased.
Steve nodded to him softly, leaning to give him a quick kiss good morning.
the mixer," Tony retorted, putting his flour-covered hands on his hips, "You said you could!"
That is until Steve managed to cuddle up further into his side.
"I was going to come over anyway," Tony replied with a raised eyebrow, plucking the paper from Peter's hands, "You and I need to have a talk, young man."
'Ms. Potts? Is she a friend of yours?' Steve asked curiously, turning towards the door as the sound of heels clacking against the floor drew louder until a woman with strawberry-blonde hair arrived in the doorway.
"Where are you going? We were getting comfy. And you were warm." He pointed out. He was still nude at the present time.
"What was your brother like?" Steve asked curiously. "Was he ever involved in a negative crowd? Have any enemies?"
"Mmm." Tony braced himself anyway, biting at the sheet to keep from yelling.
"You're gonna be okay, baby," Tony added, smoothing Peter's hair back, "You don't need to worry."
--" He mewled "Right there please, Tony,
"I love you." Steve breathed happily, continually caressing Tony's skin. "You are absolutely precious, babe. Gorgeous." He moved down to suck softly along Tony's collarbone with a deep hum.
Steve let out a soft breath as Tony roam his body, shivering slightly as the kisses came to his bottom lip.
"I've had enough of this," Tony grunted, reaching around Steve's head to unbuckle the gag. He tossed it aside, greedily capturing Steve's mouth. "Better," he mumbled.
"I am
He grinned, happily reaching up to pet Steve's hair.
"I assumed that it was because you're my friend. Is that not why?" he asked a bit unsure.
"He already thinks he's a superstar," Natasha sighed, gracefully hopping up onto a kitchen stool, "World's Best Marksman."
"Peter? Munchkin, can I come in?"
"It always counts," Tony pouted, "Mistletoe doesn't change."
"I'm excited for what you have planned," Tony mused, "I have an idea or two, as well."
"You have a HUGE crush on that Tony guy.".
"Which 'last night' are we talking about--before or after we went to bed the first time?"
“Yes, because Tony was the one who saw something was wrong and took me to Bruce to check out what was wrong.” Steve clarified, a bit of warning to his tone. “Who knew beforehand is not the point. The point was to try to keep the team safe and to keep you all from worrying.”
"Yeah! And den you 'n Papa can read me his comic book." The boy said happily, hugging around Tony's neck as the man held him. "I wanna learn 'bout Spidahman."
He hummed to himself, eyes rolling up as he thought about it. Steve hummed back in an interested manner, leaning at the kiss.
"Much better," He murmured, leaning up to set his raw ass on the cool of the desk, "Sir, if I could, I'd suck you off and let you fuck me over your desk to earn my extra credit."
"I know, daddy!" Peter said with an eyeroll. "I'll be sure ta tell 'em just case dey don't know."
Bruce handed the brunette his screwdriver, looking closer at Tony's expression.
"I don't think we do," Tony replied with a smile, squeezing Steve's hand, "Thank you, Sharon. For everything."
"Yes, dear." Steve chuckled, soothingly petting Tony's hair. "Since you are laying on me, I'm sure you'll know when I know anyway."
"For some reason that doesn't seem normal." Steve chuckled, moving to nuzzle Tony. "Remind me to never go to the guest house at all, by the way if that's the case. I honestly never thought of Bucky as that kind of guy. Who knew?"
"Oh, Tony," Clint murmured, eyebrows creased in worry.
He turned to shut the door, sending Tony his thoughts.
"Um," he started, "I'll need to talk with Tony about it before we decide. So we'll do that and call you all back, okay? Sound good?"
"Not bad, just embarrassing at the moment, you dork." Steve huffed playfully before Tony started to move downward.
"Dere bio... bio...." Pete got stuck for a second, while trying to remember the word.
"Sammy wants to give kissies too." Steve laughed playfully. "Just give in to the kissies, Spider-Man!"
"Papa send ya over?" He asked grumpily, reading over the paper instead of looking at Tony.
Steve groaned as Tony pushed back against him and moved against his still clothed erection. He moved back in order to work off his own pants, slicking himself up before slotting himself back behind the other. He ground his hips up against Tony's a few times before lining up and working his way in painstakingly slow.
He crawled onto the bed, slipping under the warm sheets with a happy sigh."
"Well I mean-- I'll be good in a few minutes." Steve sighed softly, nuzzling at Tony's hair sweetly. "So how is it going to go down this next round, huh? Seemed you have a plan."
Peggy smiled at the nickname, eyes sad as she petted Peter's hair.
"You will not always be able to hide behind your father, Anthony. You will find that I am not a man easily shaken." Schmidt made clear, glancing over to Steve. "I believe you have a job to be doing, Steven. And it is not to be standing there and gawking like an oaf, correct?" He spat.
Tony stared at the three before sheepishly ducking around them, getting warm pajamas before going to take a shower.
"Pray tell what always has you so very, very distracted?" Steve asked, crossing his legs slowly. "Because if you keep being distracted, you could go on the verge of failing my class."
Peter squealed even louder at the raspberries in laughter, noise coming through the baby monitor from Sammy in response.
Steve watched Tony leave with a pang in his chest, taking a breath and heading to Pete's room. He knocked on the door gently. "Peter? May I come in?"
"Not too much sugar, munchkin." He said, eating his half and standing. "I'll set up the play blanket."
"There we go! Good as new!" Steve grinned, blowing a raspberry on Sammy's tummy before scooping him up.
"Oooh, peanut butter, don't mind if I do," Clint grinned, wiggling his fingers before grabbing a cookie.
"I made you bleed," he whimpered, "I hate seeing blood on my partner 'cause I caused it. I-- I'm usually careful, or people will tell me when to stop. I'm sorry." Tony nuzzled into his palm, the pitiful look still stamped on his face.
"Its hard work, playing." Steve grinned, nuzzling the boy gently as he slept. "But he enjoyed himself, so that's great. He'll enjoy his surprise present too, I think. It all looks great." He praised, leaning and kissing his husband.
"Well when you work, I have to work as well. I
, and I don't wanna hear you two banging all night," Clint drawled, flicking his eyes over to Steve, "
"Good. It’s been a long day. Tomorrow will seem longer." Steve sighed, bumping their noses together before working on grabbing up some of the boy's gifts. "He's getting a great Christmas this year."
"I dunno about an army, but two or three is plenty. I mean, what if the surrogate had twins or something?" He said carefully. "Can that happen statistically?"
"Daddyyyy," Peter whined, "Y'sposed t'be on
Tony heard him and immediately slowed his smacks, lovingly rubbing the marks on Steve's backside.
Steve smiled back to him, glancing at the mural.
"I've been thinking, and-- I kinda wanna get another," he mumbled, "Like, a surrogate? From that age. I'm sure Pete would love a little brother or sister."
"Yeah, pipsqueak. You can play down in the workshop while I fix your Uncle Buck up," Tony hummed, patting Peter's back, "We all splittin' till dinner?"
He threw open the door, immediately latching onto Pepper's white pantsuit leg.
"Well, I'll hold off. You did say you wanted to snuggle today," Tony hummed, smooching Steve's cheek before settling on his chest, picking at a loose string on his shirt, "I love you, y'know."
"I... I haven't even told you why I am here." Steve said carefully, keeping eyes locked on the other.
They followed regardless to where they were keeping the baby, smiling softly at the little wiggle worm in the blue blanket.
Natasha gave Tony a soft look as she said her piece.
"Steve?"
"Constant use of the mouth keeps the lips and throat sufficiently lubricated," Tony purred, nosing at Steve's cheek, "Otherwise they both dry up."
“Love you, too." Steve hummed, back arching at the touches and kisses. He ran his hands up and down along Tony's upper back sweetly, keeping them held close together.
"I was the kid's only friend growing up. He caught me stealing food from a banquet for Nat and me, and thought it was pretty cool," Clint laughed, placing chairs around the table, "He helped me and her get on our feet, got us jobs, and in return I got him out from under his asshole father."
"Tony! Hey Tony wait up!".
"If I don't get presents, you don't get presents." He shot back playfully, making kissy noises at Tony as he finished the bacon and eggs. "And I know you don't want that. Especially later--"
"I... I can feel how mixed up the things you're feeling are." He murmured, feeling tension and shame prodding at his mind. "I am so sorry you're feeling like this, Tony. Goodness..."
"Shh. Not your fault, babe." Tony lovingly kissed Steve's forehead, rubbing his arm. "We needed to talk about it eventually. It was best without Pete around."
"You turned me into a sap, cheeseball. I was happily unemotional before I met you," Tony laughed, rubbing at his eyes, "Oh my god, mixing post-orgasm raw emotions with this was not a good idea, oh god--"
"I guess you're right. And it sort of gives him mentally his age to play with." He laughed, turning away from the welding. "At least until you guys have another little squirt running around. How's that working out, by the way?"
He thought to himself, shaking his head with a scoff as he headed off to the living room.
"Oh my God, I thought she still had another week." Steve said a bit dumbfounded until what Tony had said clicked. "Right! Baby bag! Just gotta add a few more things to it and its ready to go." He stated, running around like a chicken with its head cut off.
"I think it'd be okay," he finally said, rolling his eyes at Peter's whoop, "Just keep the volume down, and only a little bit of the movie. Not too much violence for you, young man."
"'Kay, Daddy..." He hummed, looking up at Tony before wiggling carefully out of Tony's lap to head over and wash up. He stumbled a bit, still a little groggy, but got up okay.
He shut off the lights and headed to his own bedroom, laying down next to Tony in bed with a hum.
"Uh, only this time because I had a source of oxygen. The first time I was really drowning." Tony admitted, rubbing the back of his head. "I was wanting to replicate drowning to see if I could find my 'hero' again. And here you are. I just didn't think you were a mythical creature. A fairy tale."
"You sound so pleased with yourself." He answered, light pink creeping up his cheeks. "That'll change. Anymore you'd like to own up to, Anthony?"
He shooed Steve away, still hobbling slightly as he went back to gather everyone up to get dressed and go over to the kitchen.
"Here we go." He said with a hum, grabbing the soup. "Open wide for me?"
"Then let me help you cope, Tony. That’s one of the reasons I'm here." Steve said quietly, moving to pull Tony in his arms and rocking him softly.
. "Can we do that?"
"You're such a nerd," Tony laughed, penciling in the last of Steve's outline, "Alright, you're done."
"Okay. We gotta make sure we've got enough for you, Daddy, and I." Steve hummed as he worked to pack things up. "Need to make up some formula for Sammy too.".
Tony stopped and blinked back at the blond, shaking his head after a moment.
"He's just curious, Petey," Tony laughed.
Steve smiled at him sweetly, holding his genius close as they swayed together. He kissed lightly at the crook of Tony's neck, feeling the vibrations of the man's voice as he hummed with the music. Before long, Tony spun back out and came back into the position they began, leaning up to kiss Steve's lips softly with a smile.
"We haven't had talks like this in too long," he murmured, "It's.... hard. God, I really don't wanna get sappy and upset on you on our vacation, but--"
"I wanted to see Ouija, I'm a big fan of horror films," Tony grinned, "If not, we can always watch a kid's movie. Freak out the kindergartners."
"Tony and I's personalities are completely different. There is just no way.".
. Got that, soldier?"
"Someone seems to like the idea." He hummed, helping wiggle out of his boxers and holding on to Tony's hips gently.
"Shhh, you're okay buddy, I forgive you," Tony murmured, gently rubbing the boy's back, "No need to cry, sweetie, everything's okay."
"I know, honey. You're gonna be sore for a couple of days." Tony smiled apologetically, sitting down carefully as not to jostle Steve. "I'll get you more pain meds if you need them, but you'll have to get up eventually," he laughed.
"Hey there." Steve grinned back as Sammy tried to play with the book pages. "Munchkin get all tuckered out?"
Tony parked in a parking garage nearby their destination, places with different stylist and designers that he knew were quality. They were mostly all located on this strip, leading up to a boardwalk filled with locally owned shops. Hitting there would definitely happen after the shopping.
Steve grinned back at the man, raising an eyebrow for a moment. "I might just take you up on that offer sometime. Especially if you aren't opposed--" he hummed.
Steve’s eyebrows twitched upwards, staring Tony square in the eyes then looking at his glasses. He nodded softly in return, moving around on the bed and doing as he was told.
Tony blinked and immediately stood, cupping Steve's face before gently leading him away.
"Yeah, but not if it’s by accident. It should be controlled if I'm a little rough." He murmured softly.
"I don't think you're too old for silly." Steve pointed out. "I still use the word silly for things other than when I talk to you. Daddy does, too. Does that make you older than us if it’s too old for you?" He asked with a curious tone.
The baby made a small whine in return as he was handed back to Sharon, the woman shushing him softly.
Steve's eyes went wide. Tony seemed to surprise him far too often.
He knew he was probably bruising Steve's hips from how tight he was holding him, but Tony used the leverage to slam himself against Steve's sweet spot over and over again.
"We can go check. I think Papa calmed him down," Tony murmured, smiling at the affection, "C'mon, let's go see."
The boy grinned a toothy smile, reaching up to streak paint across Steve's cheek.
"Daddy gots burned, an’ a helper wuz 'ospit'lized," Peter explained, ignoring Tony's motions to stop talking, "Daddy wouldn' even go t'the
He reached a hand up to stroke at Steve's cheek, running the pad of his thumb over the merman's bottom lip gently.
"You see, Mister Stark, it
"I think you just want me to stay here to keep you warm and comfy." Steve threw out, quirking a brow up at the man before shivering at the fingers brushing his skin.
Peter gasped, looking up at Tony in horror.
"Okay, okay," Tony laughed, letting the boy drag him back to the steps up the slide.
"Yeah. M'all wet, doe," Peter sighed, letting Steve scrub him up.
"Well, one memory would have to be when I completed DUM-E.".
Natasha nodded and started to head up the stairs.
"Y'so good, Stevie, so good," Tony panted, tucking his head into Steve's neck, "I love you, love you so much--"
He rubbed at his eyes, eventually allowing himself to relax in Steve's embrace.
"Did yous take a nap, too?" He asked, giggling at Steve. "Cuz Papa still looks asweep."
"Hey, if you like it, you get to eat it, so I don't see the problem," He teased, spreading the shirt to get his hands on Steve's bare chest, “There's whipped cream in the fridge, if you want me to get it."
"Nothing. All the boxes and furniture's in. We'll have to go shopping for our new bed, though," Tony replied cheekily, smearing grease on Steve's cheek, "Thank you again, guys. You're always welcome to stay at che Stark. Guest house is empty, feel free to stay when you're not missioning."
"You really are the Grinch, Stark," Bucky hummed, grabbing another cookie.
Tony hummed softly, yawning before settling down into Steve. He gave the blond on last kiss before closing his eyes, easily falling asleep. Steve closed his eyes to rest them, taking in all of the man that was in his arms. He soon fell asleep, feeling that everything now would end up all right.
"Papaaa," he croaked before throwing up again, spitting the foul taste into the trash.
Tony snorted in laughter, leaning over to kiss Steve passionately in front of everyone, earning more groans. "I love you, thank you," he murmured, pinching Steve's behind.
He laughed softly, pulling away to lace their fingers together. "I love you."
"I know it doesn't. Things like that seem like they just happened a week or days ago when it’s been much longer." He sighed, thinking of his own mother. "But life just keeps going on. And we fall back in suit with it."
"Oh, can it?" Steve smirked, pulling Tony to lay on top of him.  "And what will it wait on, hm?"
"Yeah," Tony breathed, bouncing Peter on his knee, "And we can work on the nursery, and maybe get--"
"Hey! I'm back, like I said!" He called. "Red? Blondie?"
"He's a growing boy, Tony." Steve replied. "He eats well and a little snack won't hurt, I don't think. He did eat all of his food."
"No, you resemble that," Tony shot back, smooching Peter's forehead before turning to the man, "How's your bow doing? Holding up?"
"I've always wanted to be a bartender. I'd have been good at it. I guess you'll just have to guinea pig my drinks. You and anyone else who wants one,” Tony joked.
Peter laid on his bed quietly, still somewhat pouty with his face in his pillow.
The next two weeks flew by in a whirlwind of doctor's appointments, arrangements, yelling (Clint), shovel threats (Bucky), and a hell of a lot of congratulation cards. With the way things had been before, Tony wasn't sure he'd ever
"Tony, hey, shh. Relax..." Steve soothed, petting his hair gently then lifting Tony's face up to his, stroking the tears away softly from his cheeks, "You want to talk about it? Do you need a minute?"
"Okay..." Peter said, crossing his arms as he climbed into his chair.
He smirked over at the blond as he slipped on his toms, tugging the hood over his fluffy hair.
"We'll have to get me a passport. I've never been out of state let alone anywhere I'd need a passport." Steve admitted softly. "So where would we be going since you know?" He asked with a grin back, laying his head on Tony's chest and looking up.
up the stairs to the art studio, grabbing him roughly to drag him down for a kiss, hands cupped around Steve's cheeks.
"Okay. Okay." Steve said softly, kissing Tony back. "It'll all go good. It’s gotta, right?" He sighed, easing in his seat gently.
A night off, jealousy baby boys and comics come to life
Peggy wrapped her arms around her favorite American's neck, smooching his cheek in greeting.
"What are you searching for? I can help with whatever you thought up." He announced, watching Tony dig.
need the reminder. To be wanted and stuff. God, I didn't even expect you to say
"Before you ask, Peter wanted to play Tattoo Parlor and give me tattoos." Steve explained with a grin as Peter drew a heart with an arrow through it on his forearm.
"Maybe awkward isn't quite the word to describe how I feel, I guess. I still just blush." He hummed, tilting his neck slightly. "We should probably hide these presents, huh?"
"Good, baby, I want you close," Tony murmured, swiping precome off Steve's cock, "Want you so hot and heavy, baby."
"Mmm, like a baby. You?" He said happily, softly kissing Tony's cheek. "Sorry I woke you. The light was hitting you just right. I was admiring." he hummed.
." He purred back.
Once things were cleaned up a bit in the kitchen, Steve headed into the living room with the others. He smiled softly at the sight of his fellas cuddled on the couch.
Steve just grinned and shrugged.
"Wait, so you like me back? Then why have you been avoiding me like the plague for the past week and a half?".
"And bingo was his name-o," Tony replied, shifting Peter to his other hip, "Speaking of arm, I need to give you that tune-up I promised. Your bicep's looking a little worse for wear."
"Yes, sweetie, it will," Tony hummed, pushing reassurance through their bond, "Just concentrate on driving."
The blond couldn't answer back. He was lost in the pleasure of it all and was brought so close...
"No, no Peter. You'll have special kisses, I promise." Steve assured, helping wipe the tears away. "He doesn't know better yet, plus he's your brother so those kisses aren't like Daddy and I's."
Rhodey’s expression tightens. “I didn’t.”, he says.
See? It’s simple. It’s just what it sounds like.
“And you backed out.” Steve points out accusingly. “So it was not a great decision, was it?”
“It’s okay.” Tony assures, lowly. “I know you’re stressed. We all are.”
His very first instinct is to shut down. Is to close his mouth and grit his teeth, pretend he doesn’t have to do this, pretend like it does hurt and so it shouldn’t affect anyone else around him; So there would be no need to tell them. Steve could stay quiet and wait, wait for all of this to blow over, and maybe someday – someday, when he is face to face with Tony again, he can sort this out.
And just for now, he forgets what’s beyond those doors – not the sky, not the dust. But the sound of fading footsteps, and the feeling that the room is, even for a brief second, even emptier than it seems.
He wonders if it would even make a difference. Probably not. The metal Tony carries in his veins is completely artificial, residues of procedures and purposefully injected nanoparticles to keep the suit properly attached, tricks he developed to steel himself for things stronger than him, to make him feel a little less useless than he truly is. Nebula though – Nebula is all metal, inside and out. Spine, veins and body, mind and

“We have to scare them off.” Rogers growls through gritted teeth, unbuckling his belts and straps so quickly that no one can even move to stop him, stepping heavily through the cabin, ignoring their stares. “Get the Jet down, away from the crowd. Try to put out the fires where you can, be careful not to let it spread. Thor, with me.”
“What kind of things?”
(My heart can’t take shocks.)
(Huh?)
“Tony sold the tower.”
“Put a pin on that too.” Tony says, agitated. “Next. We blow them up, get the cube, and Thor takes it back to Asgard.”
under his breath, looking mussed and tired, barefoot and in old clothes, and it’s a jarring contrast to the last time Steve saw him, in a suit and expensive cologne and watch, untouchable by the world.
A pause. A shaky breath. “…Yeah.”
any indication of favoritism! It’s not!)
Tony rubs his eyes with a hand roughly, so roughly that it actually is not relaxing at all, just painful, a sting of hot sharp static burning at the back of his head. God, this is exhausting.
It’s Rhodey. Rhodey is coming. Rhodey is, without any doubt, his team.
“If we get a Gauntlet, the next step is to figure out what to do about Thanos and the Stones.” Tony proposes, logically. “We have to find him, to immobilize him, get the Stones, and snap. Considering we don’t know where he is yet, we have to focus on the next part: stopping him, and stealing his Gauntlet.”
but he’s too unsettled to reach out and actually fill it for himself.
And the agreement – the sensation of accomplishment, of a small, minuscule victory in the middle of his mess, the tentative step forward in the right direction, it’s the only thing that keeps Tony from shattering where he stands. He’s exhausted. He’s so, so tired. His mind feels like it’s overheating, trying to run in too many directions at once, flooding with plans and to-do lists and pressing concerns, one trampling the other, never standing still.

“To be able to use all six Infinity Stones at once, Thanos has proven himself more powerful than every one of you combined.” Wong says, with no mercy at all, and it stings a little, despite everything. “To bring people back is harder than to dust them away. A single life is composed of many parts, some of them incomprehensible to the rational mind, and if those parts scatter, to bring them back together takes more effort than it takes to destroy them.”
They pull and tug. They bend. Sometimes it gets stronger…

Here comes the nerdiness. Again, not a scientist, but definitely a very big enthusiast of science and, particularly, in this case, chemistry and physics. Unfortunately, I lack the technical knowledge to make sure this plot is going to be 100% accurate, so do forgive me, and science is weird anyway, so might as well have some fun. I'm not going to give you a lecture, but this is going to get very... theoretical, shall I say. I will push the realism as far as it can go - and maybe, when I'm done, you're gonna wish that I hadn't skahdakjsfkh
And it’s not like Tony can argue against having some rest, in the state he’s in.
“No.” Steve replies. “It was Ross’. Not mine. Not Tony’s.”
“What? What!” Sam loudly protests. “Don’t start with private conversations now, c’mon—”
It’s like watching butterflies through a thick layer of glass, like the exhibit he once saw when he visited museums in California. He never liked those things, even with the frames full of colorful patterns and delicate structure. The cruelty of having such a fragile being pinned by its’ wings, the attempt of transforming death into beauty, hiding selfishness under a pretty casing. It makes him uneasy. He doesn’t feel like he’s a part of it. It’s the very same feeling he had when he first woke up in this century, when he stopped by the coffee shop and sketched for hours, and all the buildings he drew looked

, and look what happened!
“Then how did he escape?”
And he tried not to think too hard if she still hated him beneath all that or not. He didn’t think so, but what would he know. But probably not. They had somehow settled into a distant but professional relationship, and that had been okay for them.
“Why are you in a hospital if you’re not hurt!?”
It’s a bit difficult, given his size; But he tries. Steve is very good at body language, despite what people seem to think of his social skills – or lack of –, because he relied on body language almost his entire life. He was small, and everything he did was to make himself look bigger and taller. He knows how to make himself look imposing. And now he is so big, doing the opposite and attempting to make himself look smaller is almost like a challenge, not only physical but mental, a position he feels so uncomfortable in, but he had to learn how to do it, out of necessity.
And though he can’t help but be mortified by Rogers listening in to the absolute disaster that has just happened here, he will not mention it with Rogers. He won’t.
“I was worried…”
“It’s not what you think.” Tony says, and he knows it only makes him sound more guilty, but he’s fairly sure he’s panicking a little so he has nothing better to offer.
(There it is.)
“Must be nice.” He deliriously mutters, head lolling back, hitting the wall behind him with a dull sound that somehow vibrates all the way inside of his temples. “Not feeling cold.”
Rhodey gives him a very pointed look, and Tony hands his head and nods, chastised, and only then, Rhodey’s posture relaxes a fraction.

He wonders if Scott will sign the Accords. He wonders if it will make any difference, if he does. Scott has already been very clear in his stance about being a hero, and he had no shame in admitting he would gladly give it up if that meant he would see his daughter again.

“We don’t know yet.” Tony admits. “FRIDAY is tracking her.”
Natasha had been there, right beside him, and so had Sam. They had all agreed to it. It had been a necessary evil, it had to be done, or else HYDRA would’ve won, but what have they done to help those who they failed when they leaked those files, all the agents out there that had been compromised, all the people they accidentally

Stone.” Rocket drawls sarcastically. “It packed one hell of a punch. It reacted to anything organic. The bigger the target, the bigger the surge.”
He makes floors for every one of them. He figures it would be best. He likes having his privacy, he would bet all his money Natasha and Barton also really, really need to have their own place for them to feel safe and make as many bird nests or hide as many knives as they’d like, and Bruce will definitely appreciate having some nice and quiet and a huge and top of the line lab Tony made just for him. Tony will not let his science bro go bored, no way. So individual floors it is!
“I’m always here for you, Cap.” Sam reassures. “Just remember: Next time you pull some shit like that? I’ll kick your ass.”
He doesn’t know how, because he’s doing exactly the same.
“Ok, Mrs. Stark.” He says, quietly. “I’ll talk to him. Just for a bit.”
I hope you do. It's a very heated argument, that one. I can't wait to talk about it ;)

. And the Stone clearly left something behind, because Vision seemed to be at least a little aware that some of Ultron was still left in him when he woke up.”
“What about the Accords?” Clint presses. “Will they make him sign?”
“Yeah, I know you would.”
Rogers stops in front of him at a sort of respectable distance, close enough to cause Tony an extreme discomfort and self-consciousness, but not close enough to disguise the blatant, unspoken gap between them, and just stands there.

He’s wearing something dark, that looks like a uniform. Jarvis recognizes the SHIELD insignia in his breast pocket.

He offers his nape like a condemned offers theirs to execution. Just waiting for the blade to come down and cut them off from life.
Like his nanite compartment. Maybe, if Tony tries a little harder, if he pushes himself a little further, he can find a way out of this, the same way he found a way out of that cave ten years ago.
Steve makes an odd pause. “Are you going to tell anyone about this?”
“When they are better.” Steve mutters. “You can give them to me.”
Breathy T. Long O. Small N. Soft Y.
“I would.” Tony hastily says, nevermind if it’s actually true or not. He’d make it true. He could. He’s a genius, he’ll figure a way to keep himself busy. There are other ways to be useful to the next generation of heroes without actually going out to fight. Tony is getting old anyway. Retirement is not a bad idea. He would do it – for her. He’d do it. “We settle down, in a farm, somewhere, away from everything. Just me and you. No one else. No suits.”
, because he’s trying to be civil, here. He’s done this before, this fight that always fall into deaf ears, because people seem determined to make it so much complicated than it actually is. To him, it’s very black and white. It’s very straight forward.

Sam grabs his shoulder and shakes him,

on them until there was nothing left. The building across the street, the one that’s still miraculously standing up – how did they run? Did they get any help on time? How many of them in there vanished, before the wing sliced through the walls? There might still be people in there. Under that wing. There might be even more bodies to count.
“I hope it is.” Tony says, and the honesty tastes sour in his tongue. “We’re doing all we can. It’s our best bet—”
He makes mistakes. And he admits it, that’s what he means by taking responsibility.
For some reason, Tony doesn’t warn her to that fact. His mouth opens, gaping like a fish, but no sound actually comes out.
Of course.
Steve nods, feeling thankful, but not relieved. Feeling better, but not happy.

The relationship Tony has with other characters in the MCU is fundamentally different than that of the comics. Of course, the comics have had more than enough time to construct long-lasting friendships and romantic relationships for the characters over the years (even if they occasionally take one step forward, two steps backward, depending on what run you're reading), but my point is that if I want to describe the relationship between Tony and any other character in the comics, nearly every single time I will be able to come up with more material, from all kind of sources, than I would be able to do with the MCU. And that's a little difficult, because when the subject is Tony, a lot of things you learn about him don't come from the actions he takes for the sake of his own benefit or motivation, but the things he does for others and their comfort or safety. If MCU Steve is a creature that needs isolation and stagnation to feel pressured, Tony works in the exact opposite way - because while Steve will hold himself steady and not move, Tony will bend until he snaps his spine if that means someone he cares about won't get hurt.
If Tony can’t trust him—

him – but he can’t imagine, for the life of him, why flying around on a Quinjet in the dark across an empty city and a sky full of ash would somehow be better than heading back to the Compound and locking himself up in his room, but Tony has never claimed to understand Barton any better than he understands, I don’t know, Lang. He and Barton were never properly close. And like the others, any knowledge Tony might have had, or suspected he had, of Barton before now amounts to practically nothing, standing on uneven and unsure ground, not nearly enough that he’d dare to make a guess on why Barton would willingly offer himself to do this, to step away from all of them, even Natasha.

And Steve feels like a failure, deep inside, never being able to protect his best friend, even now. Even after everything he’s done. Everything he’s sacrificed.

“I wouldn’t ask you to help me with this.” Steve replies, decidedly.
It’s cold. It makes Tony shiver.

In the end, the inescapable truth is this: they are, for the first time in years, after one of the worst fights Tony has ever fought, together again.
He created Ultron mindlessly, because he was scared of his nightmares about the Chitauri, and once he realized what he’d done, he helped them destroying it.

The crowd doesn’t care. Some of them stop, maybe only now noticing there’s someone already on the other side of the fence, but they are the minority – the rest of them keep shouting, snarling at Rogers’ face, rabid dogs ready to attack.
Well, as we did with AoU, we are not pretending none of this happened. You can't really write an in-depth emotional arc for Tony without considering the people he holds dearest to him, can you? So let's talk about it! If this were an Avengers movie, Pepper and Rhodey would probably fade into the background and provide only some mild support and maybe an epic one-liner, not much else. But I've got time, and I've got a bone to pick, so let's make sure Rhodey and Pepper get their fair amount of analysis, as they should in Tony's POV.

She lets him go with a nod, steps around him and leaves, her low heels making muted sounds against the floor, slowly getting farther and farther away until Steve can’t hear her anymore. And it takes a long time. She leaves the rooftop and goes down the stairs, at least two levels down, and even so, Steve can’t bring himself to move.
The rest of the journey is silent, again. Somehow, it feels worse than before.

For all of Steve’s initial resistance, Stark Tower is actually a really nice place.

He needs to know if she’s okay.
“I’m gonna help you.” Tony argues anyway, but his voice is weak.
How many other things have passed him by and he didn’t notice? How many other secrets were buried between them, a graveyard of unspoken words, laid before them as a proof of their fragile bonds? He didn’t even know. So many graves filled with the confessions his teammates never felt the need to share with him, hiding under layers of dirt and grief to keep themselves disguised, trying not to stir too much so they won’t be seen. Hiding in plain sight, under watery eyes and choked up jokes. Steve has been digging graves for his own secrets for so long, so effectively, that he completely lost the notion of how

Steve takes this as permission to sit down next to her, in a chair nearby. He doesn’t pull his chair closer, but he does recline forward, placing his elbows on his knees, so eager, so determined to look her in the eye as he says his next words, because if he doesn’t do this, it will all be for nothing. He’s already aching and hurt. He’s already cracked at the corners. Natasha threw all of her emotions and vulnerabilities at him, using them as weapons, and it’s only fair he does the same, that he should expose his heart to her as a price to getting her trust back.

that looks remotely like a one-night-stand hanging from Tony’s arm, much less loudly and unashamedly, as he’d come to expect from his reputation.
“An hour and a half. And counting.” Clint makes a resigned expression – the kind of expression an aggravated father would make over his child –, turning around and going back to his chair. “I’m not sure what’s going on there, I’m trying not to think about it too hard or else I feel like I might regret it. Not sure why, but I feel like I would.”

And he completely loses track of time.
But she allows the search anyway. It’s illogic, and stupidly sentimental, but she also doesn’t think Steve deserves to have his body lost in the ocean for eternity. If Howard finds him, she tells herself, at least she will have that tiny peace of mind.

You see, there's way too many things that bother me about CW for me to keep quiet. And once I started writing Wanda, this chapter just wrote itself, really. It might sound odd to you, the fact that I got a bit sidetracked writing about Wanda when this is supposed to be a chapter about Bucky, but I hope I can show you how important the analysis of Wanda's story is to my interpretation of Steve's character. As I've previously mentioned in the comments (once again, if you haven't read them yet, I encourage you to do it, because there's a lot going on in there as well. You're gonna have fun, I promise.), Wanda and Bucky share a very similar story - and so, Steve reacts to them in a very similar manner. The thing is: Steve has a longer history with Bucky, and being so, he is much more protective of him. Making Steve realize how his decisions impact Bucky's life and perception of self in a quick fashion would take a very extreme and very specific set of circumstances, which I'm not willing to create here, as this is a Canon Compliant work - and when I say extreme, I mean extreme. Something that simply doesn't fit the narrative created by the MCU canon. It's a shortcut that comes at a very high price, the price of cutting almost all character development in favor of one single problem, which is an inefficient and unsatisfying solution. So we're not gonna do that.
But he’s trying. He really is. Steve has never talked to Sam about it, but he knew Sam was in the VA when they first met, and Steve had done some research about it. It’s not like they had something similar in the forties— a place where soldiers could be vulnerable without fear, without feeling shame, openly and sincerely, not only behind closed doors and in hushed tones –, and learning about it had been interesting. Learning about

Steve rubs his hands in his face, wishing he could just brush off the sheer exhaustion he feels so deep in his bones with just a mere shrug, but he can’t anymore. He’s so tired of this. So tired of fighting. He wishes Natasha would stop. That everything would stop. He wishes he could rewind back time and fix Sokovia, fix everything before it happened, so they wouldn’t have been left with
He was not fully in control – but he was the one who brought the bottle to his own lips. Just like Bruce is not in control of the Hulk – but he was the one who created him anyway.
We still have to deal with one little issue concerning Natasha as well. I meant it when I said her friendship with Steve is very strange; Or rather, in comparison to some of Steve's other relationships, this one in particular seems to come from a place that is a little off. So let's talk about it some more. I'm certainly always very eager to dismantle the details of their relationships for fun.
Cap purses his lips like he wants to say something, but won’t let the words fall out of his mouth. Instead, he pauses, for some reason he also looks Tony up and down, like he’s assessing his physical state, and, out of the blue, asks:
“Be gentle!” Tony screams, very emphatically. “We want to scare them, not fry them!”
But Jarvis is a sentimental fool. He knows he is. And his weakness will always be the surrogate son he lost, the same weakness of the woman that considered him a part of their family.

all the same, and for a second he is glad Vision is directing his gaze at Clint, not at him.
Pepper’s hands grasp his arms anxiously, her voice calling his name in half-reprimand, half-desperation, but for the first time, Tony ignores her protest. He will not back down on this. He will not be left behind while they go on and risk their lives also being countless hours with no sleep and no sustenance. Tony knows he’s injured, but he doesn’t
“Yeah.” Clint lies back, with a smile on his face. “Much less SHIELD. And you were

“You must be hungry.” Shuri says, completely ignoring Bucky’s comment. “Come, we prepared a guest room for you. We can all meet at the dining room later, but you can get ready first.” She then gestures to the right with her hand, suggesting Bucky should go in front of her, and Bucky shoots Steve an inquiring look.
“Are you guys okay?” Bruce suddenly asks, confusing Tony. At his expression, Bruce sneaks a glance behind him, even if they have already turned a corner and the kitchen can no longer be seen. “You and Pepper. I thought…?”
(That is always her fear.)

Maybe if he tries, he can still salvage this.
“She was the one to cut me from her life – and for good reason, I admit. I wouldn’t admit it before, but I see no reason why not to, now.” Thor confesses; And that’s the right word, confesses, because the way he says it… Tony doesn’t think Thor has ever talked about this before. Not this openly. Not this… truthfully. “Not when I’ve lost everything. My home, my best friend, my brother, my father. My sister, who I didn’t even have the chance to truly meet. Granted, she was the worst, I certainly didn’t miss much in that regard, but—”
he missed something.
“None that I can measure, Doctor.” FRIDAY replies.
“I know.” Sam agrees. “But can you blame the guy for reacting badly? They were his parents, man. I don’t know what I would have done in his place.”
Tony feels the impulse to apologize, but the words won’t make it out of his mouth. He’s not sure he should say them. He’s not sure how to react.

“He hasn’t been staying here for a few weeks now.” She informs him, as she walks him outside, with two of the Dora following them a few meters behind, relaxed, but observing. “I though he would like some space for himself, so he’s staying in a village a few miles away. But no one else has permission to go there, so we sent the General to bring him here. You can wait by the garden if you’d like. He says he finds it relaxing.”
He doesn’t. As he feels like he’s out of his depth, all the talent to dazzle and convince and enchant gone with the years away from the unpleasant fake niceties of the high society, and his natural penchant to read people and analyze them I completely wasted on a person like Wong, who seems to have trained all his life to be the perfect imitation of a statue. That’s the kind of stoicism Tony would expect of trained spies, like Natasha and Barton, not a guy wearing eastern-looking robes in the middle of a secret magical society in the middle of New York.

That might work. Maybe the way is not brute force – but a trap, a sleight of hand of sorts. Maybe that’s what they need. They can’t win if they go toe-to-toe with the guy, Tony knows that much; especially because they don’t have the power to match him. No one does. It’s just reckless to assume otherwise. So they have to be smarter, get him in his own game, before he even realizes there’s something going on.

“I once told Jane,” Thor points out, calmly. “That my understanding of the universe and yours is not that far apart. We might have a better grasp on how to use the forces of the universe in Asgard, but many of the things we use without a thought are the things you study every day.”

You probably haven't given this movie any thought in years. I wouldn't blame you for it, I'm not the biggest fan of it either; It's very early in the MCU and not nearly as strong as the other solo movies from the time, it heavily features Ross, which... yikes, most of us prefer Ruffalo's iteration to Norton's and so on. But I have one very particular issue with this movie, that has nothing to do with the content, and everything to do with some of its settings - and the implications of such setting. So, as much as I prefer to pretend the solo Hulk movie doesn't exist, it does, and I will acknowledge it for one reason: the opportunity it gives me, on a personal level.
“Both have their benefits, I think.” Steve sways his head from side to side, trying to be placating. “Well. I’ve made them. You can have some if you like, but if you want to leave, I won’t stop you.”

“It’s not a fight.” Pepper sadly replies. “It’s a rescue. We have to rescue the people out there, Tony. All of us.”
(Same old song and dance.)
“It’s fine, I won’t start a fight. I have no right to. I just want to know.” He assures, looking at them almost coyly, smiling lightly and keeping himself in a relaxed position, elbow atop the counter and feet crossed while he supports them on the legs of the stool, a position that would not allow any kind of surprise attack if he were to do so. He doesn’t raise his voice. He doesn’t stare at them. He just spares them a glance, barely a second for each one, hoping he is coming across as non-threatening by making himself sound gentle and keeping his frame small.

It doesn’t feel familiar, not really. Maybe Tony is too tired, or too scarred, or too anything, really, to truly feel at ease, but he’ll take this small dose of comfort if he can, if it’s not too selfish, because he needs this to remind himself that this isn’t pointless. That he has to go on because he still has a job to do. That these people are counting on him, and he cannot disappoint them again.

When he hears Nebula approaching him again, he has calmed down enough that the sweat on his skin feels cold again, not infernally hot as it did before. He can feel the air reaching his lungs again, even if the smell is still stifling. He raises his head slowly, because it feels like it weighs a ton and he can’t move it right with his achy neck; And Nebula stares back at him with sad, mournful eyes, her whole face pinched in sorrow.

“Do you have a plan?” Tony asks.

“Ever since I moved in.”
But isn’t that what landed him in this situation in the first place?
He wonders if he should be offended – if not on his own behalf, at least, in behalf of the
And something in Steve’s words, or maybe in Steve’s tone, makes Bucky fall really, really quiet.
There’s too many of them. The Jet’s cramped, they are ill-equipped – though they need all the help they can get, he doesn’t know how the crowd can possibly react to them, let alone Nebula and Rocket, should they need to push the civilians back. They have never dealt with a situation like this before, where the people they’re trying to protect are also the hostile force. Tony knows he has no experience in that. Every other time they’ve interacted with the civilians was when they were trying to lead them to safety, when they were
“I have.” Tony interrupts, because he really doesn’t want to hear it, even if he’s aware that what he’s seen does not compare to two entire days living in this post-apocalyptic hell.

Christ, he started this. Scott hadn’t even known what he was getting into when he agreed to fight beside them. Steve was the one calling the shots, he was the first to throw the Accords away, he was the one who decided the issue with Zemo had to take priority over the UN. The issue with Bucky, and the other Winter Soldiers. He made that call, and— fuck, it’s so confusing, because he doesn’t

“Howard, we’ve talked about bringing SHIELD affairs home.” She chastises, but it’s hollow and weak sounding. “You can’t bring this war into our house again. It has already cost us too much. Who knows what will happen next if you don’t stop.”
Tony used to feel about him. A weird situation to be in, being the father to your caregiver’s replica, but he never thought twice about it. All he’d been thinking about when he made JARVIS was how much he missed the old Jarvis. He’d been young, and bright, and lonely, maybe in need of a gentler father figure to give him what Obie couldn’t, even at that time, but then, watching JARVIS

“But that’s a problem.” Lang points out. “He knows we’ll be coming. So there goes the element of surprise.”
“How?”, Rhodey presses, almost aggressively.
“I understand.” He says, completely emotionless, keeping the bitterness and the sharp tang of frustration hidden under so many layers of masks that he can almost believe he doesn’t actually hates this. But he does. “Thank you for taking care of him, princess.”
“You think you wouldn’t.” Shuri replies, disbelieving. “But we all try to please people we respect. He will do the same. And to be very honest, pleasing you is not a priority right now. He needs to be himself before he is anything else. Even to you.”
“It’s a little weird.” Steve agrees, kindly.
“Do we?” He asks, desolately, fearfully wishing his worst fears are just that – fears, and not actually what is happing. That he might be getting too ahead of himself, that it could be

“Not for Tony, you aren’t.”
But when there’s a mission to complete, he has to be a soldier. He barely has time to be anything else.
The mansion is being closed. Many belongings will be sold at auctions. The wills of Mr. and Mrs. Stark are read, and all their clauses and details refined and acted on accordingly: Most of what’s Howard’s goes to Stark Industries, or SHIELD, or private institutions of higher education and research; Most of what’s Maria’s goes to philanthropic institutes, charitable entities, and very few distant relatives. After all of that is given away, it’s terrifying, in a somber kind of way, to see how little of them is left.
“Huh? Yeah.” Tony blinks confusedly. “It was just – Don’t worry, I was just thinking out loud.”
“Son of a bitch.” Tony mutters, feeling like the ground beneath him is trembling in an earthquake only he can feel, his knees trembling with the pulse of something that threatens to bring him down, muscles weak and bones frail, a rush of cold adrenaline pumping through his veins like his blood is being frozen as it runs through his body.

Pepper stops, and looks at him for a moment. Her eyes are not judging, but in her pause, Tony sees the rush of something flick through her gaze, an emotion Tony fears to identify. “No, it wouldn’t.”, she says, and it’s surprisingly gentle.

(You need to be stopped, Cap. How else would they do it?)
Stop. It’s too much to hear it inside his head, and now he is about to hear it out loud. He’s not sure if he can. Steve is staggering over the edge of madness, between anger so deep it seems to burn him from the inside out, and sadness so heavy it weights like a million tons, like the water around him when he crashed the Valkyrie in the Atlantic. He’s getting defensive, so defensive, he can feel himself shutting down all rational thought in favor of guarding himself for a fight and he

“…And can you call 13-K?”
(Wasn’t it?)

But Steve doesn’t want to sacrifice anything anymore.

"Oh my god," he whispered, still giggling, "I-- oh god, Steve, we've
"Yeah, yeah that sounds good."
"Soulmates? Dere's no'ting left of dem," Peter gasped, looking up at Steve with wide eyes, "M'teacha used t'say dat all deh soulmates were
"Did you
"Yes, yes, God, I'm not angry anymore, just want you in me Steve," Tony begged, hopelessly rutting against the desk, "Need you, babe, need you--"
"Yeah!" Peter yelled, squirming in Tony's grasp.
"I love you," Tony breathed, once he forced himself to take his lips off of Steve's, "I love you too goddamned much to let my fucking stupid bitch ass to get in the way of loving you."
He grinned cheekily, sticking his tongue out before continuing down the aisle.
The way the last one ended sort of made Tony smile, Steve signing it at the end like it was some official letter...
"You're already starting to rub off on him, Peter. But Daddy's right. You can't take care of those things by yourself completely just yet. One of us have to be around to help."
? Okay, we're on our way, should we bring--? Okay, we will. Thank you so much. Mhm. Bye."
"Well then, I guess we should let you do taxes and pay bills, oh and you'll need to get a job--"
Steve's eyebrows quirked up softly, smirking back to him. "You are correct, they don't." He hummed back, moving up the stairs carefully to their room.
He hummed and kissed Steve's cheek, reaching up to play with his hair.
"I wouldn't mind if you said it a billion more times, to be honest." Steve said slightly breathless, but continuing to kiss Tony's face as he carried them onto the couch. "You happen to be my favorite, as well. What a coincidence." He chuckled warmly and petted at Tony's hair.
He slicked himself up before setting himself at Steve's hole, ever so gently pushing in.
"Wait up for me?" Tony joked, putting his cup down with a shaky hand before going to grab pajamas, "Come with me while I shower. I might fall over."
"But Clint... He's a guy."
"I figured in the next volume, I could include the others if they wanted, but the beginning is specifically for us." The blond explained. "The publishing company wants to make samples to sell. To see how well it does before deciding to expand it and sell more in larger areas."
, Peter Benjamin Stark-Rogers."
Rolling his eyes at his father, Peter slipped the gloves on and got to work. He was nearly done when the front door opened, causing a chill to go down his spine; he stripped the gloves off and bolted for his room, locking the door and diving under the bed.
"Well, you didn't really have too much stuff with you when you moved in." the brunet said with a shrug as he looked around. "Had your shield, some clothes, a motorcycle, and a sketchbook. That's about it.". An idea hit him then, turning to the soldier almost excitedly.
Their vacation came and went at a reasonable pace, getting in as much needed 'alone time' and relaxation. Most of the time was spent going at it like rabbits, but hey, it was relaxing to them.
He let Steve adjust before slipping in a second one, leaning down to kiss his neck and scissor him open.
"Alright, alright, everyone upstairs for Peter's last gift," Tony laughed, gingerly taking the novel from Peter's hands before the boy ran off, "Look for the bow, sweetie."
Tony petted Peter's hair and smooched his forehead, humming.
stuff like that."
to know," Tony feigned, "especially about the safeties of kiss pregnancies--"
Tony clicked his tongue and rolled his eyes, going over to retrieve the stroller and buckle Sammy in before turning back to them.
"Owieee," he cried, hands clasping over his nose.
"This is the first I've seen you without sleeves in a long time." He hummed happily. "I like it--".
"Almost. But I didn't. We crawled into bed instead," Tony replied quietly, "I didn't have a plan, I was more venting than anything else."
Steve flushed lightly at Tony's action, grinning cheekily in his response.
like is that you could be getting a poor grade in this class." Steve said softly.  "You're a brilliant student. All your other teachers say so. They say you ace their classes without hardly so much as a thought. Yet it’s my class you seem to be having trouble with."
Tony nodded, sighing into Steve's shirt.
Steve loved hearing Tony's noises, loved hearing that he could do that to the man. He gave another low moan to send vibrations up through Tony's body, trying to bring him close to the edge.
"Hey there, sleepy face." Steve chuckled at their sleepy son. "You want a couple cookies before you go to bed?"
Steve looked at the boy softly, shushing him gently.
"Okay, okay, we have to buckle you into your car seat," Tony laughed, scooping the child up.
off the ground right now," Tony growled, slipping in a second finger, "And you're so pretty all begging for it and all."
Tony nodded, curling up into Steve's warmth.
"Oh, Honey," Raavi said seriously, "We are gonna make this happen.". And with that, he ran to the back of his salon to prepare some things.
Tony finished cleaning up Peter, taking the stopper out of the tub before standing to get a towel, wrapping it around Peter and lifting him out.
He stood on shaky feet to grab a duffle bag from under the bed, hastily packing a few changes of clothes, a small bath kit, and as a last thought, the secondary razor he kept behind his hair gel.
"Whatever you guys wanna do, I've got no itinerary," Tony chuckled, standing back up on creaky knees, "Wanna doodle some, Pete?"
"That's the sand guardian, guardian of the sand. Not a shark," Tony replied with a raised eyebrow, sticking a cookie in Steve's mouth, "Now hush and put him down before he throws up all over you."
He winked, stepping out of the shower.
Steve grinned at that, ruffling Peter's hair. "We believe you, buddy. You'll be well behaved, huh?"
speak Russian, right? He looks it."
"You have such a big heart, and you've only had it grow over these years. It makes me so proud to see that. And you deserve it all."
"That's the thing, I'm NOT okay, Steve. Talking with my dad brought thoughts up that I didn't want to admit to before, and now I don't know what to do. I mean, I haven't gotten any decent sleep all week, I've got things and feelings I'm trying SO freakin' hard to ignore, and my plan is going to shit. There are so many things I want to tell you about but I'm not even sure of what it all is that I CAN say--".
"Uh-huh," Peter nodded, shifting, "I can't--"
"You've got a thing for touch, don't you?" Tony kept his hand in Steve's hair, gently massaging his scalp.
"Well, we have our itinerary. Let’s get started." Steve grinned, smooching the boy's hair as they headed towards the room.
The room looked like it was taken out of a snapshot in his mind, the area looking just like The Stork Club that he had visited many a time decades ago. All that was missing was the inevitable decay that was on the actual Stork Club, if it was still standing at all, and the people.
"Are you sure about that?" Howard muttered. "That would mean you wouldn't get to see your 'friend'.".
"Steve! Come on in, man.".
Whining, Tony slumped down on the couch, holding back a sniffle.
"You know what I meant." Steve said with a small grin, gently smacking Tony's arm as he left for the desk again. "How're the papers going, by the way?"
"I love it when you swear, good god," he murmured, fitting himself on top of Steve's chest, "I love

?" Tony turned his head to look at the boy, huffing softly.
He sniffled again, tugging his sheets up to his chin.
Tony sat down on the couch next to them, wincing slightly as he did so, but not mentioning it.
"I never put the tantrums on you. You only do that when you are upset with work." Steve laughed along, kissing Tony's cheek. "But I know you try not to. You do well, Tony. You're a great daddy."
"It is a big deal when you get self-conscious, considering you jump into almost everything with renewed eagerness," Tony pointed out, sitting down next to Steve on the shower bench.
"You get to deal with yelling children this early in the morning," he complained, grumpily pulling the sheets over his head.
"Please no merry making in front of the child," Pepper sighed.
"What are the things you think about that are more interesting than my history lectures?" He asked gently. "Is the way I teach too boring?"
"So, are you suggesting that our murderer is following in the footsteps of Jack the Ripper?" He queried.
"Mm," Tony hummed back, peeking open his eyes, "Love you too, dork. Pete? Honey, cookies are done."
Tony replied with a grunt as he sucked down the liquid, not surprised to hear Steve's laughter from the kitchen.
"Okay." He let himself be led by Steve, grabbing his keys and putting on slippers before heading over to the other apartment.
The next few days were brutal. Finances had to be put in order, the funeral had to be attended to, emotions had to be put in order, and by the end of the week, Tony was just happy that he could relax with Dummy and Steve, sort of back to their regular routine, now that all the guests had left.
Dodger looked to Steve in response, giving his trainer the best Baby Doll Eyes he could muster, earning a laugh from Steve.
"It's dumb and won't get discussed for a couple years," Tony complained, stretching his words out, "Don't look at me like that, sap."
"Two--Three,
much. Besides, he's in second grade. I hope you know your colors," Tony teased, "It won't be hard. I'll take a week off to help you guys get started, and see if I can convince Pep to let me work from home more often."
"'M fine. Jus' tired." He mumbled, snuggling against Tony's chest.
"Take all the time you need sweetie," Tony purred, reaching down to slowly pump Steve, "It is our wedding night, after all."
"Hungry," the boy announced, reaching his arms up, "Come feed me?"
"Mmhm."
"I will agree with you on that. Kind of hurts..." He whispered, kissing Tony's forehead.
"We are going to let the hurt go away for a couple of minutes. Then you are going to lay down on the bed for me. Still on your stomach."
“Yup, sounds like the old days,” Bucky pointed out “He was always a cuddler, but it was always in a way to get extra body heat. His iron deficiency made him cold constantly, so as soon as your head would hit the pillow, Steve’s cuddled up against you in a ball to contain every bit of warmth he can.”
"You all done, bud? Good job on cleaning your plate. Proud of you." He praised, kissing the top of Peter's head happily.
"Naw. I can waits," Peter replied, snuggling up to Steve's chin, "Go 'head, Auntie Peppah."
"I don't know, just go with it," Tony whispered back, wrapping his arms around Steve's waist, "And you're not hurting my legs. You've straddled them many,
"Sorry. I totally forgot about the cuffs." Steve admitted sheepishly. "Sorry about that. But yeah, it’s okay to let others do for you sometimes. Take the reins a little bit. "I'm still working on that, myself. But I've been getting better about it."
"Omelets." He said with a smile at the pet name. "Ham and cheese. Or just ham, if you don't like both together. And I'll make some toast, too."
They both slept throughout the night soundly, Steve waking quietly just before sun up. He peered down over at his husband lovingly, small streaks of the rising sun landing gently on Tony's sleeping face.
Tony bit his lip, casting a shameful gaze downward.
"I was so angry. So fucking
"Take your time, pipsqueak, don't get a tummy ache," Tony called, shuffling into the kitchen.
He smooched Steve's cheek, resting his hands on the blond's hips.
"We're definitely getting you white ones," Tony breathed, nosing at Steve's cock, "And black. Fuck, you look so hot, Stevie."
on school property." He smacked Steve's ass once, amused at the tiny jump.

Tony rolled his eyes, wrapping his arms around Steve and kissing his neck. "Of course, I've got the best stuff planned for you," he hummed, "I mean, unless you
Tony looked up at Steve, standing on tiptoes to kiss his cheek.
Tony hummed deep in his throat, lazily sucking him down. He pulled back for a breath, eyes half-lidded, spit connecting his mouth to Steve's cock.
"Cheeseball," he muttered, a bashful smile on his lips.
"I hope Peter does keep an eye on Little Bit. Help the others with certain things." Steve sighed nervously, picking Sammy up.
"Steve," he whimpered, rolling his hips, "Please, need you--"
Steve moaned quietly, speeding up his thrusts and watching Tony with lust blown eyes.
"Tell me if it hurts, and I'll wait to let you adjust," He murmured.
"That's not why I'm blushing, though."
"Otay."
"Love you too, Tony." He whispered back sweetly as their lips parted, running his hands along Tony's cheat.
Tony snored on for an hour and some, waking up happily rested. "Mornin beautiful," he mumbled into Steve's skin.
"You're such a sap," Tony laughed, brushing his bangs back, "Love you too, oaf."
Steve rolled his hips back carefully and let out a groan. He grabbed a hold of Tony's body carefully, moving them around gently.
"It's not a waste of time, baby, you know it’s not," He replied quietly, "Don't do that to yourself."
"Ya vampire." Steve snorted back, slipping on his boxers. He grabbed up the panties Tony had on last night and managed to scoop Tony up to carry inside, burrito'ed up in his blanket.
"Still need convincin'." He breathed. "Wanna know it’s not just for my body, Mr. Stark.".
Tony giggled softly, nuzzling at Steve's cheek.
"--lots of videos of me having drunk sex," he continued blandly, voice catching at a non-censored video.
"Can we go t'deh store aftah?" He asked.
"Papaaaa!" Peter screamed, trying to wiggle out from under Tony, "Daddy's ticklin' me
Walking into the lobby, Tony didn't let go of Steve's hand as he walked up to reception, only taking a seat once the receptionist ushered him away.
Tony bit down on Steve's shoulder, burying his groans in the other's skin; he gasped roughly, coming hard between their chests.
"He'll get there, but I'm not imposing early sexual topics on my child, end of discussion," Tony snapped, "You two
Peter rolled his eyes and made grabby hands at Sammy, at which Tony shifted so he could hold both boys in his lap. Sammy blinked up at Peter before leaning up, kissing him on the lips.
Steve looked backed to him, trying to feel more assured. He gave Tony a quick peck on the lips.
Steve finished untying it, running his hands over the corset once he spotted it.
Steve laughed with him, laying them down in the bed and kissing Tony's face. "Hon, I've seen you
"You're such a good boy," He murmured, capturing Steve's lips so he could taste himself.
Oh well.

"You are absolutely pathetic." Steve growled out.
"Who is this guy?" She said flatly.
"Want you t'take care of me,
"That tickles," Tony laughed quietly, teasingly pushing Steve away, "You're such a protective thing, y'know? Maybe it's the bond."
Steve ran his hands along Tony's back, breathing gently. "That's why I told him they were booboos. He thought they were funny lines. He wanted to get a marker for you to help them match before that." Steve explained softly, kissing Tony back. "You should rest. You're exhausted..."
"He's gotta have the ducky pajamas, Daddy." Steve grinned back at the man. "They're his favorites."
"Understood." Steve said with a nod before being OK'ed to leave. With a strong flick of his tail, he swam out of the chamber.
"And daddy doesn' wan'
"Now, what gave you that idea?" Steve teased, handing Tony his plate and making the man a glass of orange juice. "Eat your food, darling." He said in a joking tone.
"You can come, baby, come on, come f'me," He breathed.
"I'd hope so," Tony laughed, ruffling Peter's hair, "You ready-- whatcha got there, baby?"
They tucked Peter into the middle of their bed snuggly, kissing his forehead before going to change for bed.Steve was the first in beside Peter, snuggling up to the boy protectively under the covers.
Steve made a surprised gasp as he was lifted up in the other's arms, but was too tired to complain about being manhandled. He let Tony carry him to the room he has been occupying, sighing contently as he was settled on that comfy bed he was really starting to love. He heard a quiet goodnight from Tony and a hand pet softly through his hair before he drifted asleep, a warmth and comfort enveloping him as he fell and awaited what would happen in the days to come...
"Fine," he sighed.
"I don't mind that. Rest is always good." Steve added, laying back in the bed as he continued to pet Tony's hair. "You could use it since you're used to working late."
“So, you’re not going to like this” he started “But I know you know who would be the person most likely to have actual information on werewolves, right? Not that Bruce and you aren’t trying your damnedest, but--”
Tony struggled for a second, whimpering into the bed.
"S'not gonna be too long, is it?" He asked softly.
"You better not," Tony grunted, wrapping his arms around Steve, "Clint would kill you. And then me, for being paranoid."
"Okay, okay, calm down," Tony laughed, setting Peter on his feet, "Go get your boots, and we'll start."
"You know what
"Yeah, good idea," Tony managed, scraping down Steve's back, "B-babe, m'so close--"
Tony wore a small smile.
"You next, Stevie."
"Keep talking, buddy," he warned lightly, a smirk on his lips, "See what happens, yeah?"
"Hey squirt," Tony said softly, sitting on the floor in front of Peter, "You okay?"
Tony grunted back, sighing happily as he settled down onto Steve's chest.
They relaxed back into comfortable silence, nothing but Tony's breaths filling the air. He soon drifted off, quietly snoring against Steve's shoulder. Steve grinned softly at his snoozing husband, curling up beneath him carefully to keep himself warm in his naked state. Once he found a comfortable position, he easily drifted into slumber alongside Tony.
"If...if you're really sure about this." Steve said nervously. Hell, he couldn't even bring himself to spank Peter, and now Tony was wanting it. He had to shake his head, driving the thoughts away and starting up on the swats.
"All acquired skills, Rogers," Tony replied with a hum.
Hope you enjoy this chapter!!!
Steve looked back at the two of them with a smile. The picture of them together was adorable. "I will agree that he is cute, but he can't use that forever. It’s just like giving up diapers. It’s a part of growing up."
"Thank you." He whispered gently. "I love you. I'm glad you put up with an old fart like me." He chuckled.
Tony had wanted him to do what the younger had done before they moved.
"Hey!" Peter complained, sticking his little lip out.
"Well, I'm not exactly the kind of guy to just share my feelings with people I barely know.".
moping!" Peter yelled, whipping around to glare at Tony.
"There you--are those
"If you's talkin' 'bouts yellin, I already know 'bout that," Peter scoffed. He paused and his face flushed, wishing he could suck the words back into his mouth.
"Really? God, you were allergic to everything," Tony mumbled, adjusting Sammy in his lap, "I'm sorry you went through that, though. I'm sure you gave Sarah and Bucky the biggest scares of their lives."
"You inadvertently called me handsome. I'm counting it. You think I'm handsome." Tony teased, chuckling as Steve's face got a bit more red on his pale skin.
Steve had gotten everything cleaned and Peter's room all set up for the boy. A glass of water on his nightstand, a clean trash pail beside his bed, pillows fluffed, and teddy bear set on the bed for cuddling.
"Can I come in and talk with you? Just a few minutes, please?" He asked softly.
"Yes, yes. You get kisses too, Mister." The blond grinned, smooching the baby's cheeks as well. "Does Daddy want kisses, too?"
Steve stood there blinking for a minute after the door shut, fingers brushing over his lips as he tried to process what had just happened. He snapped out of his thoughts when he heard his watch beep. Shit, he was going to be late!
"Mmm, I can see that," Tony chuckled, taking his time to undress himself.
"Ready?" He asked Steve.
He whined at the kiss, heat flaring up his cheeks again.
Steve's eyebrows quirked up at the strength Tony had used, nodding and doing as he was told. He stripped slowly, just to tease Tony a little, and tossed his clothes onto the floor. He faced the wall and waited patiently on the bed.
Steve sat on his bed that night sketching out ideas for his next piece. He must have been doing something funny because he heard Clint chuckle from the other side of the room. Steve looked at him confused.
"Don't get into something you're not gonna finish, Rogers," he murmured, "Because I will take you up on that so hard you will use a belt, I swear to god."
Sammy giggled softly at Peter's antics, reaching out his chubby arm for his brother.
He wrapped his arms around Peter, gently stroking the boy's back.

"Yeah!" The boy cheered, running off in the direction of the TV.
He set the boy on his hip, waiting for Steve to return with the seat.
"Alright, I know you're excited for presents," Pepper laughed, pushing Tony gently toward the kitchen, "You're a bit excited, sweetie."
"And sugary," Tony hummed, licking his fingers, "S'good. Thank you."
He whined softly, pushing his hips up.
He took an angry breath, grabbing Steve's hand before straightening his back, fury and rage dancing in his eyes. "Fuck you," he hissed, "Fuck you and your goddamned establishment. Have fun getting funding from the government."
"I'm fine," Tony replied, involuntarily wincing away from Steve's touch.
"How do you feel about topping?"
“Do you mind if I stay here for a while?” Bucky had asked out softly. No one was sure if he was asking Natasha since she and the others were leaving or Bruce because it was his lab, but the question was there. “I could look up information on a tablet while I’m up here, but I kind of want to spend some time with Steve for a bit.”
don't know about yet. And I think you'd both love it. At least, I hope you will."
"Right. Captain Innocent here," Tony laughed, kissing Steve's cheek, "All the more for me, then. I've got a few other things we can try, but I don't know how you'll take to them."
Steve was surprised at the response. Tony rarely ever admitted he was scared, no matter what it was.
, Steve, good Lord," Tony breathed, leaning down to capture his lips.
He chewed on his fingernails nervously, glancing up at Steve.
He stuck out his bottom lip again, wiping away his tears.
Steve blinked again, watching Tony carefully as he clipped on the collar. "I'm supposing the talk of pets reminded you?" He asked softly.
," Peter complained, pouting at Steve, "I's a big boy."
need to accidentally stumble onto."
"Hey there." Steve smiled, looking to Tony softly.
Tony tried not to squirm under the pleasure in his spine, blinking away the buildup of tears in his eyes. He waited for Steve to pull him off his lap before laying down on the bed, barely able to resist grinding into the bed.
"I agree with little bit. Too much PDA around here." Clint answered with a smirk.
"I know, one last thing," Tony soothed, rummaging through his medical cabinet to grab a band-aid, "Then we'll go sleepies, I promise."
"See? No harm done, bubba. Don't cry. It'll be okay." He assured. "How about we get you dried off and you can have your cookies before bed, hm?"
"I loved it. I want more dates. Movie dates inside," Tony mumbled, yawning till he drifted off to sleep.
Tony swallowed him down again, humming deeply until Steve came down his throat. Steve let out a broken off moan, hand in Tony's hair and tightening gently at the locks as he came. He took deep breaths to relax, letting the water run on him.
"Right... Right," Tony mumbled, forcing himself to relax again.
He slumped slightly, sniffling as he leaned against Steve.
Tony visibly looked relieved in that, taking a second to hug to redhead before stepping back to Steve.
"Ow! Hey, I need that hand. Or else you won't get any waffles," Steve said with a chuckle, swatting Clint's hand away as he worked.
"God, I love you. You're brilliant--".
"I'm not a subtle person," Tony snickered, "C'mon, you. We're in your bed, so we gotta go nice and slow anyway, right?"
Peter yelped as Tony tackled him to the bed, holding him down.
"I can teach you to waltz. Here, you go forward with your right foot first--"
"Well--" Tony bit his lip. "I wanted to buy the right house. With my soulmate. Didn't want to get it, and then have them hate it." He chuckled softly, a sigh on his lips, "It has three fireplaces. One in the living room, one in the master bedroom and one in one of the spare rooms. A gorgeous backyard, enough room for a garden, or swing set, and we can get a dog and fence it up--"
"Sorry," he mumbled, crossing his arms.
He flicked one for effect, smiling at Steve's groan.
"Yeah, Peter. You didn't even get to really eat your lunch. You've gotta be hungry, bubba." Steve said softly, heading towards the kitchen. "I'll warm up some macaroni for us, all right?"
"JARVIS let me in. He called for me to help, said that your vitals were changing to the way they do when you have an attack.".
"Biggest cheeseball," he choked, letting Steve slip the ring onto his finger, "I--Steve, this is-- wow, my ring's nothing to this, I--I literally have nothing to say."
"Can I touch it? What material is it made of?" Tony asked, carefully reaching out towards the 'tail'. He was only met with quick recoil.
"It'd be a pleasure, Mister Stark-Rogers."
"Mhmmm, it sure is," Tony replied sleepily, cuddling another arm around Peter, "Cold. Steve? Fireplace?"
He grinned, going over to his liquor cabinet to pull down an old bottle of whiskey, setting shots up on the table. Everyone made a noise of approval as they migrated towards the table and grabbing a shot glass as they were poured.
"Well that's real humble of him," Tony replied, taking one of Peter's hands to clean under his nails, "The people must be very grateful to have such a squishy ride back to shore."
"Yessir. Sorry, sir..." He murmured back softly. "Sorry..."
He hummed softly, happily keeping his fingers in Steve's hair.
"Unca Clint! Ladies first! Dat's da rules!" Peter scolded, crossing his arms. "Auntie Tasha goes next, mister!"
gift tonight? Or later?"
"Ewwww!" Peter squeak, Sammy making a similar noise after. "No kissies in front of Sammy. He's too inn'cent for youses kissies." Peter protested.
"Well, I've had years of practice with you." He murmured back, kissing Tony's lips after he took a sip of coffee. "Make you taste good, for sure." He grinned.
"You ready to go, pipsqueak?" He asked, smiling fondly at the boy's cheers.
"Right," Tony mumbled, palming the steering wheel as he turned into office complex.
Tony trotted down the corridors in a fury on his way to his father's office. Not once had Howard even bothered to talk to him all semester long, so why did he want to see Tony now? No doubt to tell him how much of a screw up he is. That's all he ever seemed to talk to Tony about when he ACTUALLY paid attention to him.
The blond breathed a content sigh, leaning against the desk. "Glad you like it. Really, I should be doing that for you. You are the birthday boy, after all." He pointed out softly, petting Tony's hair.
The AI announced, Tony's expression dropping slightly. How would he explain Steve?
"Papaaaa, come dwa'h," He patted the floor.
"N-No... Venom... Coursing through my veins! Aaaaaaaaand I'm dead." He announced, flopping on the ground 'dead'.
"Oh, I completely forgot." Steve groaned. "We'll have to have that meeting. And then I guess let the teacher know we'll be homeschooling him." He sighed, cuddling Tony.
Steve blinked over at Tony softly, nose making a small sniffle as he slowly went about cleaning himself.
He swooped Sammy up into his arms, singing under his breath as he danced the baby back up to the art room, not surprised to see Peter doodling on Steve's arms with marker.
The TV flickered to life, the familiar Who song filtering into the living room.
"Uh huh, sure," Tony rolled his eyes, leaning up to rub his beard against Steve's chin, "I just have a Van Dyke, that's all."
"Tony, if you're done, come out here please." Steve said softly, looking over to the bathroom door. "I'm honestly confused about all of this...?"
Johann grinned, sharp teeth reflecting blue light as the warlock pulled out a cube-shaped artifact.
"Yes dear." Steve rolled his eyes fondly, going to start up the fireplace before joining his family in a cuddle pile on the bed.
"Mmhm," Bucky just nodded, trying not to smirk when Clint got whapped again.
"They pretty much are. That's a separate culture that I never got too deep into." Tony frowned, but his eyes lit up as he got closer to the crops.
Tony really wished stop lights didn't exist. He had one hand on the wheel and the other on Peter's, gently shushing him as he sped off to the hospital.
"We need to get you something to eat and laid down to rest. You'll need it." Steve cooed softly, rocking Tony gently. "I'll get Sammy tonight so you can rest, okay? Get you feeling better, sweetheart."
"Ramsey? More like Bobby Flay. Or Ina Garten can sit on him," Tony deadpanned.
"Now I want you to count aloud each swat for me." He instructed. "You have to learn somehow, Tony."
"I'm not here," Tony replied, putting his hands on his face, "If I can't see you, you can't see me."
"Nuh uh. I got sweep," Peter mumbled from Tony's shoulder, peeping an eye open, "M'just restin'."
"Tell me your names, Sirs, and have a seat, you must be weary from the walk over."
Steve thought about it for a minute before it finally clicked.
"I'm the older one. I should be threatening to put toys away,” He lightly pressed a kiss on Tony's head, nuzzling his hair, "I won't do it again. Promise."
TW: none
"Markers aren't for chewing, sweetie. That is a mess and possible doctor visit waiting to happen." Steve explained, offering a finger from his clean hand. "We seriously need a teether for you, bud."
"We need to make a baby bag," He announced, "The little one's--"
"Is that it? Just some signing, and the hospital will keep us updated?" He asked.
Tony laughed, skipping over to Steve to press a kiss to his cheek and gently rest a hand on his lower back.
"Put your sneaks on, kiddo, brush your hair and comb your teeth before coming down for breakfast," he teased, ruffling Pete's hair.
"I understand, though. If a visual of intimacy makes you uncomfortable, I'll cover the mirror next time," he murmured.
"I guess I'm too gweedy," he mumbled, "I just want 'tentions dat I didn' gets in deh or-orph'n'ge."
"I think bandaids would be good, baby. We'll get him some cool looking ones on our home, okay?" He smiled.
I couldn't see you again yet. But it wasn't your time. Not then. But now you can rest. Now you can come with me."
"Papa and I wents t'da 'quarium an' we saw fishies an' sharks an' deh
"My singing that bad?" Tony replied in a daze, giggling softly, "I'll do my duty for my country."
Tony swallowed his laughter, biting on his knuckles.
He winked at Steve, pinching his skin lightly.
"Jay? Grinch, if you would, half volume."
Tony ruffled Peter's hair and helped him down the stairs, giving him his suitcase while they waited for Steve to come down the stairs. Steve came traipsing down the stairs not long after in a t-shirt and a pair of sweats, stopping in front of the brunets. He didn't bother with jeans considering the clothes were no doubt coming off by the time he got home.
, I want this. More than I probably should, but I do." Tony replied, tugging Steve closer. "There is so much I want to show you, Steve. So much I want to be your first of and so much I want to make you feel. Its selfish, really. But I do want to take the time with you; help you discover what you want and what you like."
Peter turned his Daddy for help, making a little "eeh" noise at him.
"If you want, I can show you, and tell you what's real and not," Tony offered.
"Well, I'm a futurist, so my reasons will sound dumb," Tony chuckled, moving onto the next paper, "But I am excited."
"No ma’am, you're not old, you're not a day over nineteen," Tony laughed, licking the icing off his nose, "Alright, alright. Not old. Cut my cake so I can stuff it in."
"It’s okay, baby. I'm not upset with you about it." Steve answered quietly, smoothing his hair. "This is why we wanted to wait to ask you. We thought you'd might feel upset about it..."
"Wanna finish the mural?" Tony suggested, kissing his cheek, "Or did you have something else in mind?"
And don't ask about the mascot. Bearcats just sounded like a cool mascot name lolol
"Strip. All fours, face the wall," Tony ordered, eyes flickering over their new toys.
"That looks really good, squirt, good job," he hummed, "You wanna hang it up on the fridge?"
"Of course." Steve grinned softly. "Made quite a mess, didn't ya?" He chuckled, brushing Tony's hair back. "Glad you're not sore, though."
"This is the waiver, disclaimer, big official packet that you need to sign. There's a few initialing spots at the end, and a final signature on the last page," She explained, motioning to the sticky note tabs, "Once you sign, the papers will be shipped tonight, and should be approved within the week. You'll receive the confirmation from the federal government via snail mail, and the process will begin."
"Mmhm." Steve hummed, eyes following Tony as the man left the room before turning back to Peter. "Whoa there kid. I know you're excited but slow 'er down a bit. You'll end up choking."
cried watching Steve take the baby, such a small thing in his husband's strong arms. Quietly, Tony thanked the nurse and took the small bag from her, making last confirmations before heading back to the elevator.
Peter hummed awake, giving a big yawn and rubbing at his eyes sleepily.
“Cap. Are you implying what I think you are implying?” Clint asked, all joking completely gone from his tone.
He smirked and sped out of the driveway, one hand on the wheel as they made it home in no time flat.
"He's going to come to you for the fun stuff, because I'm not going to let him do anything remotely dangerous," Tony scoffed, "He's gonna ask you if he can go places, if he can have friends over, stuff like that. You'll be the cool dad once he has the girlfriend, and I refuse to let them stay home alone."
Steve followed suit and grabbed up the rest of the bags, following to the inside of the cabin where he nearly dropped said bags at the sight.
"Daddy taught me how to feed 'im," Peter whispered back.
"Don't worry, Peter. We'll make it quick, okay? Then we'll get you in your duckie pajamas." Steve hummed, heading upstairs.
"I'm right over here, hun." Steve hummed sweetly, setting his sketchbook down and walking towards the bed with a slight hobble still. "Hey there, sleeping beauty."
"She...what?" Steve asked, a bit surprised. He knew that soul mates were getting far and few behind, but he didn't think they were just gone. "Why'd she say that, baby?"
"I'll go start the coffee early," Tony laughed weakly, smooching Steve's cheek, "Keep his toothbrush out, and-- oh my god, I betcha I have one of Pep's hairbands around here, we can put his hair back."
should know I feel about that."
"That sounds good to me." Steve chuckled sweetly. "But it probably will be a few years before that, though. Let us get used to completely living together before we add another little person in the mix."
