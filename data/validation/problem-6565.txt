Instead of the surge of panic he thought he’d feel, all that came was the overwhelming sense of relief.
Steve felt comfortable in Tony’s space, never felt like he was intruding where he wasn’t needed. It was probably the reason why Tony’s lab had become one of his most frequented spots to spend time, sometimes reading, mostly drawing in one of his many sketchbooks.
The weeks blurred by, full of dinners and movies, lunches, coffees, museums and walks through the park. When Steve took the time to look back on it, he felt incredibly thick that he hadn’t noticed that what they were doing was considered dating. Or at least that must have been what it looked like on the outside, and almost definitely what it looked like to Sharon.
Alone. Tony was going out there alone and Steve needed to—he jerked his head to the side and then back to Iron Man. He wouldn’t let his emotions get the best of him, he trusted Tony. “Right.”
Tony sounded harassed “Look, Thor’s right and I’m right. We need to end this now, we needed to end this ten minutes ago. I tried it your way and now I’m going to try it my way.”
It sounded like a good plan, it sounded like the perfect plan. Which meant something was wrong. “The risks?”
Steve’s body let go, sagging with the complete and utter relief that washed over him. He let his head fall down to rest on Tony’s chest, breathing in as deeply as his body could take. Admittedly, Tony smelled a lot like salt water and sweat, but under that, under it Steve could still smell the cologne lingering on his suit from earlier that evening, could almost swear he smelt the mechanical smell of oil.
In all likelihood, it was probably the only kiss Steve would ever get from Tony, and no matter how bad he would feel later, how much it would hurt, damn it, Steve was going to enjoy it now. He could enjoy it now.
Tony didn’t get it, or he didn’t want to get it. “You could have gotten that patched up in the amount of time it took to find me.”
Steve is always a little bit awed by the view from the roof. Up here, high in the sky, Steve can almost make out stars above him while below him the lights continue to shine just as brightly as they always do.
Steve barely opened his eyes until he was gently pushed down into a seat, trusting Tony to get him wherever it was he wanted him to be.
He didn’t think he’d ever been more grateful for the end of a movie as he was that night. As everyone began to leave, Steve slowly extracted himself from under Tony and helped Sharon up. He walked her to her car and he knew she would stay if he just asked. He knew she wanted him to ask, that she’d prefer to stay the night. He couldn’t do that though and it made him feel all the worse when he sent her off alone back to her own place.
Tony’s mouth curved up as he ran his hands appreciatively down Steve’s chest, his brown eyes gleaming wickedly, invitingly, up at Steve, “That should do it, get our coats and I’ll meet you by the door.”
, the one who would string her along more than he already inadvertently had. It would just end in disappointment and hurt feelings and Steve wanted Sharon to be happy, even though he couldn’t be the one to give her that happiness.
His breath leaves him in one go and he feels it then, the ice water in his throat. The burn on his skin. He gags on it, he tries to pull in the air but there is no air. He's drowning all over again. He's alive when he should be dead and he's still drowning. He doesn't know if he'll ever stop drowning.
“—so I’ll be there for possibly a few days, I’ll have the suit, though, I hope I won’t have to use it. This company really looked like it was going places.”
Steve nodded, dropped his hand away from his eyes, no longer caring that the flow of silent tears hadn’t stopped, one or two still finding their way out despite his will to appear stronger.
When things got too heavy they changed the subject to lighter topics like the Avengers and SHIELD. They talked about missions they’d been on and the people they met along the way. Before Steve noticed, it was dark out and when he’d gone home that night, it was with a smile firmly on his face.
Tony went still, a single brow raised as he assessed Steve. It was only the slight twitch of his upper lip that threw off the façade that he was trying to get the rest of his face to go along with, “why Steven, I thought you’d never ask.” Then he was really smiling, eyes bright and grin toothy as it stretched across his face, “I just lost my Jag to Rhodey by the way. He said, and I quote, ‘leave it up to you two morons to get together while the other lies in a hospital bed.’, I had more faith in us, Steve! I really did, but here you go, lying in a hospital bed. Really, it’s your fault, I—”
Steve nodded at him to let him know he was fine. Tony grinned and addressed JARVIS “put on something Capsicle would like
Steve bit out his next words, “No Iron Man. The risk is too high, stick to your position. That’s an order.”
Steve smiled wide up at Tony as he reached out to still his hand. He squeezed it gently before twinning their fingers together, “We should go out soon. Right when I get out of her, I want to take you on a date.”
Steve forced himself to move, one foot in front of the other and walked to the door to grab their coats. He took the time to breath, to file everything away until they weren’t in danger. He couldn’t afford to lose focus now. Not when he still had Tony to get home safely.
Steve’s eyebrows knit together and he turned the page quickly. His eyes widened at the images that greeted him on each page. “
He didn’t have to wait too long, Iron Man landing in front of him not five minutes later. Cool metal gripped him around his waist, careful not to jar his shoulder, and then they were airborne, headed towards the largest group of SHIELD agents who were busy collecting and cleaning up the mess that had been made.
“Good, great. Okay. Good.” He tapped his foot and checked his watch “Happy should be here by now, I’m just going to-“ he gestured at his phone.
Tony nods before getting distracted by something on his phone again. Steve isn't sure what to say, about to open his mouth and go with whatever comes out first when he notices a blanket covering him. He frowns "I didn't have this"
Steve breathed, focused all his attention on pushing the images away from him. He pushed and pushed until even that grating whine was gone. When it was over, Steve nodded his head.
Luckily he didn’t have to search for an answer for too long as Tony jumped in before Steve had made it through scenario two playing out in his head. He threw his hand back till it tapped Steve’s chest twice, “You know how it is, never likes for me to travel alone, such a worrier,” He leaned forward towards Mattias conspiratorially, “If you ask me, I think he just misses me when I’m gone.”
Tony mistook his frown for worry because the next moment, Steve felt a kiss on his cheek, close to his ear, “The armors only a call away, I’ll be fine. Go now.”
He clasped Tony’s hands warmly in his own, “Mr. Stark! What a pleasure to have you here with us,” his eyes filled with confusion when they landed on Steve, “and, Mr. Rogers? Well this is an unexpected pleasure.” He held out his hand to shake Steve’s, grip firm, mouth tipped up, but gaze practically brimming with the unasked question.
Tony let out a little puff of air before his hand was on Steve’s, clasping it. “I’m sorry too. I shouldn’t have gotten angry; I should have stayed calm and talked it out.” Tony squeezed his palm firmly, eyes boring into Steve’s with so much focus that Steve felt like the room had tipped. “I can’t promise that something won’t happen, just like you can’t promise me that something won’t happen to you. But I will promise to only take a risk if it’s absolutely necessary, okay?”
Steve wasn't sure how long he had zoned out but when he looked up again the room was silent, all eye's on him. He coughed once and smiled sheepishly "Uh, sorry. What's going on?"
If Tony noticed, he didn’t let on. He nudged Steve’s side with his elbow and grinned, “Well, it is Steve.”
Steve cut him off with a laughed as he tugged Tony’s hand until the other man was sitting next to him on the bed, tucked warm and solid against his side, “remind me to explain it to him, later.”
With that last line Steve stopped completely and closed his book. He tucked it away in back to its place.
That was good, that was what Steve should have been doing. It sure would have saved his confusion when he caught the tail end of Tony’s sentence.
He never asked Tony why it was that they broke up, it hadn’t been his place and he didn’t like the way Tony stiffened whenever Pepper’s name was mentioned.
Steve shook his head fondly and walked forwards towards them all. Tony quickly patted the spot next to him and Steve sat down, pizza box almost immediately shoved into his lap. Tony nudged his shoulder and raised his brow.
Sharon’s grip got tighter and Steve didn’t know which question he wanted answered more, why Sharon was behaving so oddly or what Tony meant when he said ‘well it is Steve’.
It was self destructive, a chemical reaction building up before it eventually exploded. Steve knew that it would all come bursting out and breaking down eventually. He knew that he was just prolonging the inevitable.
When Steve got to the Tower, it was empty as far as he could tell. He walked to his room for the sole purpose of changing his clothes and then hurried back out to head to the gym. He needed to release all the tension he’d managed to build up within himself.
That meant no pats on the back, no arms thrown casually over the shoulder, and for the love of America, no lingering. Steve never realized just how much physical contact he and Tony shared until he had to forcibly stop himself from reaching out towards the other man. It was far more challenging of a task than one might think and Steve could admit that he had failed to enforce the rule on several separate occasions.
Steve didn’t move, even when he wanted to twist his hands until their fingers intertwined. It would be so easy to do too, but, no, this was enough for Steve, far more than he ever tried to claim himself.
Tony doesn't so much as glance at it before waving his hand. "I had Dum-E bring it up, you looked cold. I know I was"
He did what he said he was going to do, loading the lizards into the back of a large van swarmed with the agents. It hadn't taken much time before they were all accounted for and then he'd immediately caught a ride on shaky at best reasoning back to SHIELD headquarters.
They would have celebrated the end of the war together and then they would have gotten married. He would have bought her a house on a hill side where they would have stayed and raised a family together. It was the life he would have wanted, the life he still wanted.
Steve felt his face flushing, pleased despite knowing that Tony didn’t mean it, not the way Steve wanted him to.
He relaxed back into his bed, looking out the glass that made up one of his walls. The sky was dark, covered in troubling looking storm clouds, and the rain hit the window in every which way, following the quick changing wind in whatever direction it chose. Lighting split the clouds with jagged lines, momentarily lighting up the sky. Steve thought it looked eerily beautiful.
There it was. What he had tried to ignore, what had crept up anyways. He was in love with Tony Stark.
She nodded and he saw it then. The slight family resemblance. His mind flashed with images of red lips smiling at him, the sound of a cracked voice from the radio of the plane. He shook his head, trying to get his voice to work. “Yeah, that’s…Peggy was, she was amazing. I don’t-“
Tony shook his head “You know, if you didn’t just say that I might have built you a flying car, I was going to build you a flying car. These street drivers are too slow for you. You blew it though.” He held up a hand “For a completely unrelated topic, what’s your favorite color?”
Steve keeps his eye for a moment before turning his gaze back to the city. He expects that to be it. For Tony to turn away again and for them to continue in their silence but that’s not the case. He can feel Tony's eyes on him for far longer than can be considered normal. Steve turns back to him and opens his mouth to speak when Tony cuts in with a soft smile that Steve can guarantee he has never been the recipient of. He's not exactly sure what he did to deserve it but he'd like to find out. "Couldn't sleep?"
Steve grips the sheets in his hands and forces his lungs to work. He can do this, he's Captain America for goodness sake.
The vote came down to Steve, who had no preference for either movie over the other. He caught Natasha roll her eyes followed by Sharon’s pleased smile and covert high five with Clint. They thought he would side with Sharon, and why wouldn’t he?
This story had been edited. Thanks to my procrastination for school work I've actually managed another chapter that will be posted asap. I've also got some artwork I'm drawing that I'd like to add pretty soon. If this is your first time reading, I hope you enjoy and if you've read this before, I hope you enjoy the changes.
“I just wanted to say that I don’t think any less of you, just because we didn’t see eye to eye. I don’t respect you less when we disagree, is all.”
On the other hand, it would really have been nice for people to stop trying to reciprocate, or look at him with pity just because they didn’t get to touch him.
Tony Stark is holding keys in his hands. He’s holding keys in his hands and looking at Steve with a kind of frail, fragile expectancy that says that what Steve does with them will matter very, very much to him.
But there’s something in the gentleness when she lays her hand on his hand, the way her gaze softens when it must see how those words twist in Tony’s gut, that makes him stop. There must be some other meaning there.
Early on in his deployment, before the Invaders had formed and Bucky was just an annoying kid in his barracks, he had seen Penny Serenade on his own. He had dreams about Cary Grant for weeks. Irene Dunne was beautiful too, and seeing them together was something else, but he couldn’t get Grant’s face out of his mind. His strong chin, his sharp nose, his cheekbones, his beautiful eyes.
“But I’ll never regret loving him. I’ll regret fighting him, pushing him, or not taking care of him.” He feels Tony stir in his hands, hears his breath and sees the blinking of his eyes, but his thoughts have not caught up yet.
“I… the reason why - well, one of the reasons why that other-me is so frustrating is that I could see him use you, manipulate you, and all I could think was,
Tony can’t bring himself to ask the question he really wants - what did you mean? - but Sharon must understand.
It’s strange how the gesture doesn’t make him fall apart like a hug would. The Hydra Supreme had made them hug and kiss. He had watched them until they were casually intimate, until holding a hand to Sharon’s cheek was a habit etched in Tony’s body.
, handsome, elegant, incredible Tony with a vibrator up his ass doing strange things to Steve’s insides. When he looks back, Tony is still looking at him, a strangely dazed grin on his face.
Tony closes his eyes and then the gap between them, places his lips delicately on Steve’s, and stays there for a moment. His lips are chapped and warm, but it’s not unpleasant.
Sharon doesn’t comment or react, but Tony can see recognition in her eyes. Somehow that helps; she must have had a similar reaction when Steve bought them.
“I don’t want to build weapons, especially not if they’re going to be used in forever wars that get civilians killed.” Tony’s voice sounds bitter and hotly unbidden, as if he has been having this argument a lot recently.
Tony’s mortification was clear on his face. Steve was sure shock was written across his own. He looked behind him to Robbie and Jen, who mirrored his expression.
He starts with the vibrator - he looked up what they looked like the night that Tony told his story - and Tony’s hand, then the tight ring of muscle of Tony’s asshole, then his cheeks and the cuff of Tony’s fancy suit. By the time evening has come and he needs to stop for dinner, Steve has even managed to capture what he imagines Tony’s face must look like: eyes clenched with pleasure, mouth hung slack, hair fallen haphazardly over his forehead.
Steve finds he kind of likes it when Tony growls, but at this moment it’s more upsetting than pleasant. Jerking back to reality, Steve stands up from the table. “Why don’t I meet you back at the mansion. Give you some time to figure out what you want to say to me without losing your cool.”
“I… this might be too personal, I don’t want to put you on the spot - I mean, the man is your boss -“
Close fitting slate-grey slacks hug the line of his legs, cup his ass closely, and demand to be looked at. The crisp white shirt, cuffs pre-rolled to the elbow, opens at his neck. The vest, easily his favorite part of the ensemble, is a lovely silver blue, embroidered with stars at the hems. He’s a little concerned at the price this must cost, but Janet waves a dismissive hand.
Tony did this to her. He can remember every time the Hydra Supreme made them - made them fuck, every touch between her and Tony an apology, every look begging forgiveness.
Gifts may be given, mercies may be wrought, and charity may be tithed. But in a world that says “you are nothing without the money to back it up,” none of that matters.
“I was - I um, I was serious. But if it made you uncomfortable I can stop, it’s fine, I totally understand -“
“I need to eat a lot,” Steve admits, “but I have a bad habit of squirreling away food.” The words are coming out of his mouth, guilt and stutter free, and he can’t even bring himself to care. Being overfull shuts off his brain’s inhibitions, it seems.
Steve did his best to smile, though he knew it probably fell a little flat. “That means the world to me, Tony. You know I want you to be happy too, right?”
The pink that floods Tony’s cheeks must be a blush, and Steve feels an intense satisfaction at the sight. He grins at Tony, rakes his gaze hungrily down the line of the man’s rumpled suit. Tony’s color deepens.
“I…” Steve began, but he didn’t know how to pull his thoughts from where they jumbled in his mind. So afraid to fuck this up.
Steve nods, gratefully. Iron Man understands. It’s a rush of relief through his body, heady, intoxicating. He doesn’t have to explain. He doesn’t have to see confusion and fear and, worst of all, pity.
Steve chuckles gently. “Don’t try to speak yet, Tony. I’m sure it’s torture for you, but you’ve gotta be patient, okay? I’ll take care of you.”
The Universe coughs politely, and Tony looks like he’s going to mouth off to her, or maybe flip her off, but she’s smiling at them.
“I love your laugh so much,” Tony said, voice full of… something. Wonder that he could say this? Joy? “You look so beautiful and unguarded. Sometimes, back when I wasn’t afraid of pissing you off, I would play pranks on the other Avengers during team meetings in the hope that I could make you laugh. I recorded it once, somehow, and I sometimes play it when I feel like I can’t do anything, because it helps me hope that one day I’ll get to make you laugh like that again.”
Steve’s never seen Mr. Stark look anything but well groomed and elegant. Watching him put his hands through his hair, seeing the patches of warm skin peeking through burned holes in the arms of his shirt, it shouldn’t be attractive. There is no reason for it to be attractive.
“He killed you. He lied to you. He tore out your memories.” She says it not as an accusation, but as flat statements of fact.
“Thank you for showing me something happy and beautiful.” She looks sheepishly at Tony. “I am sorry for attempting to kill you, Anthony Stark. It was wrong of me to blame you. I hope you will forgive me.”
Tony grabs his hand while he’s looking away and guides it to Tony’s cock, wrapping Steve’s fingers around it. Steve wasn’t expecting it to be so warm, or so smooth. Not quite smooth, soft? But Tony’s dick is rock hard. Steve sits still for a moment, caught up in the sensation of Tony -
“When you’re as bright as Tony is, sometimes it can be hard to see what is happening right next to you.” His fingers stroke over Tony’s hands, not sure who he’s trying to comfort: Tony or himself
“I’m not afraid of losing him,” Steve says, hearing the certainty of his words. “We built it - us - together, with our hands. We’ll always come back to each other. I’m afraid of…” What is he afraid of?
Tony’s eyes are so, so wide, so wide that Steve is a little worried that Tony’s sudden resuscitation might signal a heart attack, but before his thoughts come back around from the sun and reach his brain, Tony is grabbing Steve’s collar and surging up to kiss him.
Tony sighs, pushing himself up from the couch, sweat dripping down his forehead. “That’s really - really not how I’d hoped that would go.”
“But you gave me - I didn’t - I don’t - please don’t - please don’t say you aren’t happy. Did I do something? Was it me?” Tony asks, not waiting for - or even expecting - an answer. “I don’t want to fuck this up Steve. I care about you so much.”
Steve knows objectively that he is considered attractive. He stole moments with men and women during the war, when he could, and they had never complained. But Tony Stark was something different. He would never want a man like Steve, even if he was attracted to men.
Captain Universe doesn’t interrupt, and he’s grateful. Was this part of her plan for him? Is she waiting for the right moment to strike? Are these the words she wants to hear?
“No. Come on, Cap, you know me. I’m not gonna be uncomfortable because you’re drawing him, I just want to know what’s up. You can trust me.” Iron Man’s voice is gentle, almost kind, and Steve sighs and leans back into the chair.
“Yes. Yes, I have.” His voice is faraway, even through the modulator. Steve wonders what, or who, he lost to sound like this.
The others are gasping and holding their sides while Steve has to turn away from Tony’s gaze, the thought of
And it’s - Steve had imagined that Tony would speak when they - during the act, as it were, but it’s one thing to imagine and another to hear the effects of his hand palming Tony’s cock, knowing that it’s
Iron Man makes a sound in his mask, something between a cough and a whimper. “What?” His voice is almost a falsetto of his normal register.
want to keep going out with you?” Tony asks, his voice low and rumbly and vibrating through Steve down to his toes.
“Okay. Good. Do you want to maybe try sparring some? I haven’t gotten the chance to talk to you in a week, I’ve been missing my favorite shellhead.”
Steve thinks about the lunch - just a lunch, not a date - constantly, over the next couple of days. He thinks about all the things Tony said, the way his face looked in the midday light, the beautifully cut lines of his suit, and the way Tony laughed.
Tony catches him later that evening, as Steve is heading to the library to do more sketching. “Hey, Steve! Just wondering if you wanted to go grab dinner? I’m starving.” He looks hesitant, almost nervous, and Steve hopes it isn’t because they got a little het up in their last conversation.
Not that he is Captain America tonight. Tonight he’s just Steve, here with just Tony, having a friendly dinner.
“I mean, even if I did, I would have enjoyed just about anywhere we went if I got to have dinner with you.” Steve flushes when he hears the words on his lips, internally cursing how good food loosens his tongue. Thankfully, Tony doesn’t seem to notice.
“Was it good? Did you enjoy yourself?” He has the warm indulgent smile that Steve loves to see on his face.
“I like it,” Steve finds himself saying, feeling heat creep into his cheeks. “I like it, when you - I like it.”
“Okay. So I just… flirt. With him.” Steve’s not really sure how to do that, but he’s also not sure that Jan is going to be much help either. “I’ll get out of your hair. Thanks again, you’ve been a huge help.”
“That’s - huh, that, that sort of makes sense.” If Tony had initiated, then he won’t mind if Steve plays into it. At least, Steve hopes so.
Steve nods and Tony shrugs. “Suit yourself, I guess, not like we can really stop you,” Tony says, casually.
“Okay. I’m glad to hear it.” Steve smiles at Tony, wanting to show how grateful he is, and Tony blinks a couple of times. Even his blinks are gorgeous, long lashes dabbing his cheeks. Steve is glad for the dim lighting - Tony would probably call it
He misses Tony more than Tamara, but he would never admit it to himself. In the space between his thoughts, though, he can feel it. The ache in his chest. Tony’s shoulders in his hands, his blood on the floor.
When he looks down at the paper, reads it once, and then twice, and comprehension dawning only on the third, he gasps aloud.
The food is familiar, though not in a bad way. Steve has never preferred French cooking to other food, but the establishment Tony took them to is clearly
Tony whimpers and clenches his eyes shut as his body shudders through the tail end of his orgasm, looking debauched and degraded. Steve feels his body tense, his stomach clench so tightly he has no choice but to hunch over, and he’s shooting off. In his pants. Without being touched.
It wasn’t like he wasn’t good at getting himself off. By the time he found himself working with the Invaders, he was the king of pounding fist. He knew exactly how to hold himself, how to thrust his hips, how to twist and grind, so that he felt every spark of pleasure. He loved that he could get off with his mouth around someone, or his tongue inside someone. He loved feeling like he could give someone something so hot and warm.
Steve feels the weight of Tony’s arm on his shoulder, and wonders if that’s really true. If that were true, why didn’t Tony look at him with desire?
“Yeah, the water helped thin out the food. A head of cabbage can last a whole week as cabbage soup.”
“Uncomplicate it,” Iron Man says, a laugh in his voice, but it doesn’t have his usual confidence. He sounds hesitant. Probably worried you’ll break, Steve says to himself, and it doesn’t seem incorrect, as judgments go.
After what feels like an eternity, he stops spasming and manages to open his eyes and oh god, he ejaculated all over Tony’s face. “Oh, oh my gosh, I’m so sorry Tony. I should have, I should have said something.”
Iron Man does the little raising of his arms, difficult with a book in his hands, that indicates a shrug. Steve feels immediately guilty. He should be able to confide in Iron Man, he trusts Iron Man implicitly. But this feels too tender, too vulnerable, even for his best friend.
Steve grit his teeth and kneeled down next to Tony, the rough asphalt under his knee a helpful pain to ground him. He grabbed the small medical kit from Tony’s armor, the one he’s used to patch Tony up what feels like a hundred times.
He misses Tamara, he thinks dimly, like his thoughts are traveling at light speed from the sun. That comparison is probably more what Tony would be making right now. Eight minutes per leg of the journey, he’d read in one of the sci fi books Tony used to love lending him.
Steve pulled gratefully on the hand Tony gave him, thinking about the feel of Tony’s skin on his. How long was it since they last touched like this, easy and carefree?
The Universe smiles shakily, the thin arm of her lip lifting ruefully up her face. “I see what you meant, Steven Rogers. He is stubborn, and unyielding, and desperately caring. He wants to save everyone, but only knows how to sacrifice himself. And you love him.”
Steve’s face brightens - “He did?” - before he forces it back to a neutral expression. “Right, uh, probably wants more updates on how I’m doing. Sure, tell him I’m free all day.” His only plans tomorrow were to lay around drawing Tony anyway.
If you’d have asked him what he would have done with them, he couldn’t have told you. Kiss them, maybe. Go to dinner with them, perhaps. But mostly his fantasies were nameless, formless things. The idea of Jimmy Stewart and his handsome face was more important to Steve than any specific interaction he could have with the man.
Tony looks confused. “It’s not a big deal, Steve. I know you loved your old motorcycle, during the war, I just wanted to give you something like it. It’s been six months - I thought, maybe, I could give you something…”
They’re already sitting at the table, chatting animatedly. Tony doesn’t notice him immediately, and it gives Steve the chance to look at his profile. Tony is almost painfully gorgeous like this, wearing simple grease-stained clothes and smiling wide. Steve swallows around the lump in his throat and smiles at Tony when the man looks at him.
Mr. Stark would want someone intelligent, able to push him and challenge him. Mr. Stark would want someone subtle and deft, able to keep up with his formidable wit. Mr. Stark would want someone coy and alluring.
Tony is wearing studs in his shirt instead of buttons, tiny black pearls dotting the line down to his - and cufflinks too, matching the studs. The black pearl shines in the workshop light, looking like an inky diamond. Steve itches to draw this, to commit this image to paper, but Tony adjusts his pants and Steve’s gaze is drawn lower.
Tony grins, lifting a hand to press against the cheek Steve kissed, before closing the door and leaving Steve to jog off to the library.
“Hey, hey, no,” Iron Man says quickly, reassuringly. “Not gonna judge. Cary Grant is a stud, I can’t blame you. I’m more of a Paul Newman guy myself.”
“Well, I saw your,” Tony gestures at the sketchpad. “Which, you left that out by the way, you should - should be more careful.” He’s still panting, his dress slacks around his ankles, his head laying against the back of the couch. Steve wants so very badly to kiss the skin of his neck on full display like this.
Tony’s ability to multitask is honestly incredible. He’s sucking at Steve's mouth and pulling Steve’s dick out and Steve can feel the cool air of the workshop contrasting with the heat of him.
“Bigger guns, better bombs: that’s not something that is going to make these people safer. And the military isn’t there to protect them - statistically they’re just as likely to be killed by American guns as by terrorist ones. They need infrastructure, education, medical care; stuff that guns and soldiers can’t provide them.”
“It’s not - I feel good. I feel really good. I just - you’re, um, ‘out of my league’? I think is what Rick calls it, anyway. It’s not - I mean, not that you have to be - but, I know you could have much more experienced people, if you wanted. Smarter, too. Who wouldn’t,” he gestures down at his pants.
“Lord, I’m so gone on you,” Steve says to himself in a whisper, and Tony must hear because he laughs, throws his head back and shakes his whole body with it.
“Steve wants many things,” Sharon says, her voice full of bitterness. “This isn’t one that he’s going to get.”
Tony understands her loud and clear. In a way, Sharon is keeping them both alive by doing this, but the cost seems astronomical to Tony. Unbearable.
“Yeah. We’re going to take it slow, right? We’re going to figure it out together,” Steve said reassuringly. “And then I’m going to suck your brain out through your dick like I’ve been thinking about for the last ten years.” His face burned again and he felt so grateful that Jen and Robbie weren’t here to hear this.
“I eat them,” Steve said, trying not to sound too defensive. “Sometimes I’ll eat some in between meals. Or after a workout.”
Sharon touches Tony’s shoulder with a finger and his world snaps back into focus. He’s slid off the couch. His cheeks are wet. His mouth is dry. Sharon is sitting in front of him, not looking at him.
He can hear footsteps now. The conversation is getting closer, close enough that Tony can make out words.
Is Iron Man jealous? Is that why his reaction is so outsized? Steve hopes not - his relationship with Iron Man is comfortably platonic, and losing their connection if he and Iron Man ever dated and broke up would be far more devastating than never seeing Tony again.
Tony takes him to a fancy French restaurant. He speaks easily with the waiter - from Bordeaux, though Steve spent less than a day there during the war - in languid French. Tony eyes him strangely, but Steve has no idea how to read it.
“No, no, hey, did I do something wrong? Did I say something wrong? You should feel good, you should feel amazing, what’s - what did I do,” Tony finishes pathetically, his hand on Steve’s shoulder, trying to push Steve up.
Steve brings a tray of food from Jarvis down to Tony’s workshop. Three days of easy smiles, lingering hugs, and soft kisses has made Steve feel tender in a way he’s not familiar with. He’s kind of hoping they’ll move into more… physical territory, but Tony is taking it achingly slow.
There are fat, hot tears running down Steve’s face, now, he realizes distantly. Tony’s saying his name, now. His hands are bunching in Tony’s shirt, now.
No one told him this, of course. The boys in his platoon would talk about getting blowies from girls in the cities they liberated, but they all talked about it like it was some kind of gift from god. When an anonymous private kneeled down in front of Steve in an alley in Paris, all he could feel was disappointment.
When he wakes next, it’s to voices. Steve, he would recognize anywhere. A woman, older, cold and distant. Tony tries to sit up, needs a sitrep, needs to move his fingers, needs to do anything but be trapped on a bed.
He may have wanted Steve for most of his life, since before he even met the guy - may even want Steve now, despite
Handjobs were easier, but still a challenge. None of the people - men or women - that he liaised with were much good with his dick. Their grip was too loose, their strokes too shallow. After a while, he gave up on coming from another’s hand altogether.
Iron Man keeps his promise. He - Mr. Stark that is to say - has a massive collection of films in the mansion, and they slowly work through the decades between Steve’s past and present. Iron Man is just as observant as Bucky and Toro were.
“Because that’s just what he’d say,” Steve says, word by word, waiting for his thoughts to catch up to his body. “He’d say that I’m life and he’s death and that’s why he doesn’t deserve me.”
It doesn’t stop his stomach from dropping when he sees the bill. “Oh my god, Tony, that - that can’t be right,” he says, voice awed at the ability to spend so much on one meal, but Tony laughs it off.
“I…” Tony began. “I want to do anything with you too. So much. So much I don’t know how to say it. Or show it.”
Oh. Oh wow. Steve can barely think, his mind unraveling as Tony jacks him off. He’d never felt this much before, not unless he was alone with his hand.
“You’re an idiot,” Tony said with a small laugh. “I’m an idiot. We’re both idiots. I’m afraid that after everything I’ve said today because of this stupid truth shit, that this is too much. That I’ll have pushed you away. I feel giddy because this - you feeling… the way you feel about me - is probably the one fantasy I never thought could come true. And now you probably don’t want to look at me, and why would you? Dating me is like dating a car battery that could explode at any point. Why subject yourself to that. Even if I want you too very badly.”
Steve pushes Tony’s cheeks apart and gently, ever so gently, eases the toy out of his ass. With each pull Tony writhes against the leather of the couch, gasping Steve’s name like a plea.
Tony was leaving the mansion to him. Tony was leaving - Tony was leaving him a sum of money that was greater than Steve had ever imagined owning.
For all that he was Captain America, brave team leader of the Avengers, Steve had his money bet on Tony figuring it out on his own.
All that was left was the timing, which, Steve admittedly hadn’t had much luck with throughout the whole ordeal. He, at a certain point, had concluded that the best course of action was to enjoy every moment he could before the final proverbial shoe dropped. When that happened, well, it wouldn’t be up to Steve anymore.
Steve didn’t waste too much time staring dazedly up at the carnage, instead pulling himself, suddenly exhausted, to his feet. All around him there laid unconscious guards just waiting to be taken into custody.
He was nearly there when he caught sight of something from the corner of his eye. He stopped in the dining room and stared.
The living room was empty except for Tony slumped over on the couch. Steve didn’t know how he’d let himself behave so foolishly, how he’d allowed this to happen. He’d had the signs, he had
Tony jumped up then, bouncing on his heals once “great! Come on, come on.” He ushered Steve along, pushing at his shoulders to get him to move faster.
He poked at it a few times, before shoving it at Steve until he held it loosely in his hand. “You need to take that, plug it into the servers, any port. I can access it wirelessly from there.”
Tony’s lips twitched minutely, “well, if I’m looking out for you, and you’re looking out for me, we just might make it out of here unscathed.”
That morning Steve decided to allow himself to actually sit and enjoy spending time with Tony, like he always had before. Tomorrow, he promised himself, tomorrow he would try again.
Mattias smiled good naturedly, clarity washing over his features, “well we’re honored you could join us for our tour; big things in the works, if you’ll follow me this way.”
Steve laughed, short but real, “We know about the dog. Thor feeds him slices when he wonders out of your room, he really likes pineapple.”
They ended up in a lively joint with far too many people who seemed to be laughing, eating, and dancing their worries away.
“It went well. Better than expected I guess. Sharon really—“ he stopped talking abruptly “I actually don’t want to talk about this”
Tony wasted no time pulling Steve along until they reached the dance floor that Tony had spent the last half hour on already.
When they arrived Steve was taken aback by the sight that greeted them. His team, all lounging casually around, surrounded by pizza boxes, chips, sodas, beers, brownies and tubs of ice cream.
Steve jerked his hand away and took a step back. His eyes shot up away from Tony only to meet Natasha’s cool gaze, “I—“
Steve turned his attention to getting to the servers, knowing that the faster he did that, the faster he could get out there the faster this would all be over.
He tensed as a beautiful dame with midnight black hair and fiery red lips tapped Tony on the shoulder, leaned in close to his side and requested a dance.
Steve’s jaw ticked, straining to make out the words being said but coming up with nothing but a stray word here and there.
Except he couldn’t. He couldn’t put the incident behind him. Tony had fallen, Steve had watched him fall, had felt himself unraveling as each hopeless minutes ticked by with a missing Tony. It wasn’t the type of thing that just went away.
Tony opened his mouth, then closed it, looked away and then back at Steve, barely veiled concern easily discernible on his face, “are you okay?”
There was no reply so Steve let all of his attention fall to the book, cracking it open to the first page. The further he got, the more the pages seemed to taunt him. The sheer amount of pictures he had of Tony left him dazed and completely confused.
Tony rolled his eyes and leaned back on the balls of his feet to look up at Steve, “That’s just like you, Captain America, best of us all.” He started gathering up the supplies spread around him, placing them back in the kit he’d taken them out of.
He thought about calling a couple times, just to hear his voice and each time he managed to convince himself that it was a bad idea. He didn’t call when one of the new recruits he was working with did something extraordinarily absurd, like managing to tase them self and everyone around them on accident, and he didn’t call when he couldn’t figure out something technical on his tablet. He didn’t even call when he woke up from a nightmare filled with water and ice and the one thing he wanted as much as he’d wanted to just
Steve sighed, paid the bill, and left wishing he could disappear into the crowd as effectively as she had.
Sharon looked down briefly, then up again. There was determination written all over her face, just like Peggy’s had sometimes looked and it was inevitable that he would start comparing her to Peggy. “Look, I know you want to leave and get some rest, I respect that, but do you want to get a coffee and talk sometime?”
Tony rolled his eyes, impatient, “Thinks, Steve; this is evidence. We have viable roles and now we have to play our parts.”
Tony pushed Steve away playfully then drew him back in with an arm around his shoulder. “Not fast enough Cap. Heavy engines don’t lift themselves out of beautiful classic cars you know. They require muscley men.” Tony pinched Steve’s bicep and frowned “Even though yours are downright obnoxious. You’ll have to do.”
Steve was exhausted. His bones ached, his eyes burned with the strain to keep them open, and he was sure that he looked as bad as he felt. He didn’t think he had ever been happier to return from a recon mission as he was in that moment. Well, it had started as a simple recon, just him and Natasha, up until somewhere around the third day when they lost all communication with SHIELD. Then it had turned into more of a ‘run for your life in the non-stop rain and try not to get shot’ mission.
And wasn’t that just something, Tony criticizing him and his carelessness when he was the one who so nearly recklessly sacrificed himself. “I wouldn’t have had to find you if you had followed orders”
“aye aye Captain” Steve was dropped to the ground, landing in a quick barrel roll that brought him to his feet right in the thick of things. He had just enough time to watch Tony pierce the sky before he was otherwise occupied helping civilians make their way off the bridge and towards safety.
. Of course it worked, that’s all Tony thought mattered. As long as the mission was a success something as meaningless as Tony’s own life couldn’t be important. He didn’t know that it
Steve heard yelling then, loud and insistent. It was his name, over and over again. He tried to concentrate on it, focused only on that until he was able to open his eyes. He saw them then, Clint and Natasha’s worried faces hovering in front of him.
He's just about ready to turn tail and leave when Tony sighs quietly and turns back to the city beneath them. He speaks quietly but loud enough that Steve can pick it up "You might as well join me"
Tony pulled away enough to look up at Steve curiously and Steve’s ears went hot when he realized what he’d said, “he thinks we’re together?”
It wasn’t one of his halfhearted ‘maybe’s’ either, the ones that were always tainted with a dash of disbelief, that he got when he let his want distort itself into fantastical fantasies of happily ever afters.
Today, he needed to watch this or that movie with him and today he couldn’t ignore Tony because Tony had given him this lopsided smile and Steve just didn’t want to leave when he was being smiled at like that.
Steve decided then and there it was best not to comment on that. Tony moved on, still absorbed in his explanation,  “so, this signal, its associated with droid technology and more than likely the two originate from the same place, which helped just barely. Turns out it’s a lot harder to track than I originally thought it might be, JARVIS had satellites scanning and re-scanning nonstop for a week before we managed to pin something down. I was able to weed out all the extraneous variables and isolate some activity to a few smaller corporations who were using smaller, more discrete variations of the original signal, all owned in one way or another by Bohlen Inc.” Tony collapsed back into his seat and pushed the images away from him.
Steve nodded without hesitation and made his way to the ring, “Don’t go easy on me this time, give me all you got.”
Tony tried to move, get his hands on Steve’s thigh where the bullet had gone through. Steve batted his hands away “I know, it went through clean. Stop moving and let me finish—”
Steve’s eyes snapped to the sky, eyes ceaseless until they found their target. The suit flashed gleaming red and gold as it ascended higher and higher still. “Iron Man, what is your status?”
Tony's hands still on his phone and he turns to look at Steve with slight concern "Did I wake you up?"
His eyelids fluttered shut just thinking about it and his head kept falling back and forth, completely out of his control.
Tony gave Steve a side eye, “I’m thinking that it would be better to put any suspicions to rest before they can rightfully form.” He threw his arm over the back of Steve’s seat, ran his fingers distractingly over the nape of Steve neck. Tony played dirty without even realizing it, “It’s just dinner, by the time my information comes in we’ll be long gone.”
To Steve’s amazement he managed to keep his posture all the way up until he was back inside the Quinjet. There, he allowed his shoulders to fall, for his eyes to shutter.
“How do you know!” Steve roared, words tearing out of him. “You didn’t give any of us a chance to think of another option. It was your way or no way.” Steve stepped closer; he just needed Tony to understand, to get what Steve was trying to say. “What if they had gotten the suit, what then? Do you think we could have taken them and you too? Did that even cross your mind?”
It had been an unspoken agreement between the rest of the team to act like nothing had happened and more importantly not to mention Peppers name in fear that Tony would fall back into the shadows again.
. Angry at Tony, angry at the situation, angry at himself mostly, “I wish he didn’t care. He cares too much, with everything he’s got and it only makes the loss hit him all the more. He’ll lock himself away and he can’t
Tony released his lip and took a seat at Steve’s right hand side. Steve opened his mouth to repeat himself but Tony made a silencing motion with his hand. Steve grimaced and kept quiet as Tony took out his phone and made a call.
Steve nodded and tried for a smile, something to prove that everything was okay. It wasn’t though, everything was not okay.
Steve took the burgers, his mouth watered from the smell alone. He unwrapped the burger as quickly as possible and took a huge bite. He said “sure Tony” though it came out sort of jumbled due to the food stuffed in his mouth.
More often though, Steve only saw a blank face, empty eyes looking everywhere but at Steve as they tried to map out a way to get anywhere, anywhere at all, that was away from him. He saw himself reaching forward, heard himself trying to reassure Tony that he would get over it, even though he wouldn’t, and that it didn’t have to change anything, when he knew it already had. He’d ask Tony to please stay, ask him not to leave him standing there, ask Tony above all to just
They had managed to narrow it down to Inception, backed by Clint and Sharon, and Sherlock Holmes, backed by Thor and Natasha. Bruce maintained that it was best if he didn’t participate in the voting process, instead acting as mediator when one side got too excited, and everyone agreed that that was probably for the best.
Tony pushed the image aside and brought up a map in its place. “Remember how I told you about how the droids had this unique signature? It comes from a manufactured hive mind that allowed them to communicate between themselves efficiently while blocking out all foreign signals that try to break in. It was difficult to muck through, lines of empty code and diverting sequences, but it would have taken longer if I didn’t recognize—“ he pulled up another image, a stream of code so long and complicated that Steve barely spared it a glance. “this. This is the signal that blocked SHIELD from getting through to you and Natasha on your mission awhile back. Lucky that happened or California could have been a lot worse.”
The tour of Bohlen Inc. seemed to stretch on continuously with no end in sight. All around employees tried their damnedest to impress Tony, especially under the watchful eyes of their CEO Mr. Bohlen. Steve made note to give Tony props later for managing to complete his task without being caught, seeing as there was hardly a single moment where someone wasn’t around showing off the latest and greatest breakthroughs that were being made.
Before they were friends, it never bothered Steve beyond his slight annoyance over the possible security issues that could arise from having random people trooping in and out.
She laughed lightly “Oh кролик” she gripped his shoulder briefly “you are a bit ambitious. Tony Stark” she patted his cheek “удачи”
Tony flicked him off and the table descended into controlled chaos. It was almost a relief. He felt lighter and less lonely and he felt that maybe he had gone about this the wrong way.
Thor didn’t move his eyes away from the screen. "Loki as a woman had looked nothing like Lady Danielle. He had much fairer skin."
Each night he thought about throwing the book out and each night he instead tucked it soundly back in his drawer with a promise that tomorrow he wouldn’t take it out and look.
When Steve's eyes open again he's a bit surprised to find that the sky is just that much lighter than it had been and to his head pressed against Tony's shoulder. He pulls away slowly, confused and a little embarrassed "uh, I fell asleep."
Tony beamed at him, eyes crinkling at the corners when he caught Steve openly starring and Steve ducked his head abruptly flustered at having been caught out. He heard Tony huff and laugh under his breath.
Steve didn’t realize that most of the small talk had stopped, not until he managed to pull his gaze away from the way Tony’s hands moved along a lovely blonde as he swung her around to the music, head tipped back with laughter when she tried to spin him.
Everything in Steve stopped, his stomach dropping “Oh. Uh, yeah. You’re-“ He coughed “You’re Peggy’s niece?”
Tony didn’t answer; too busy dissecting a hologram in front of his face with one hand, the other gripping the sandwich near his mouth.
Steve knew he was fighting a losing battle with exhaustion, if the debrief didn’t start within the next few minutes he would be drooling on the conference table.
There was a murmur of assent, a few nodding heads and Steve’s com was crackling to life “Avenger’s Assemble”.
So, yes, Steve knew he was attractive. He was attractive and maybe down in the lab he had wanted to touch him, to run his hands over his cheek, and just smile at the other man, but that didn't have to mean anything. It didn't mean anything that every single drawing of Tony left him both terrified and incredibly fond, two dueling sensations squeezing at his heart.
They sat in silence, each bringing their breathing back to normal levels. Steve cracked open his eyes and looked at Natasha, “I’m pretty sure you already know.”
Most times, Steve made sure he and Sharon kept their distance from the tower. They spent time going out, and if ever they were inclined to spend the night together, it was always at Sharon’s apartment. But Sharon had been bringing up the tower more and more often and Steve finally let his constant, and slightly exhausting, guard down enough to invite her over for impromptu movie night.
Fury pointedly took a slice of pizza, ignoring Tony’s affronted ‘hey!’. He took a bite, eye narrowed at Tony. “Now that that’s decided, what do you say we get this party started? Stark, you can leave at any time.”
Steve’s mind scrambled. Tony wasn’t supposed to be there. He blurted, “I thought you were in Malibu.”
He couldn’t though, he couldn’t see past the mangled bodies on the field. He watched the ones who were too far gone to save but not far enough that they didn’t realize what’s happening to them. He watched the pain and fear dance in their eyes only to be reflected ten times over in the eyes of the friends who stayed by their side till the end.
He opened his mouth to give his vote just as he registered movement from the corner of his eye. Tony shuffled into the room, still scrubbing residual oil from his temple.
Tony motioned at Fury “Anytime now, some super soldiers have been waiting on you for long enough.” He poked Steve’s arm “keep eating”
Steve was happy to say that it was almost as if their friendship had finally reverted back to its former glory. He was still attracted to Tony, he was able to accept that fact despite his initial hang-ups, and he still thought about him at the most inopportune times, that didn’t seem likely to stop, but things like that were now just added on to the friendship they had already forged. Admittedly there were awkward moments where Steve had to catch himself; like the times where he caught himself staring at the way Tony’s lips were moving and had to jerk his eyes up and actually take in the words he was saying before Tony noticed.
Hours passed before the conversation wound down, plates long since taken away, the men and women at the table relaxing back with their drinks as Bohlen Inc.’s head mechanical engineer, Kris or Cam or Kellum, recalled the story of his last vacation in Italy that Steve found himself only half listening to. The other half of him was occupied with finding an appropriate moment to excuse both himself and Tony, when he caught movement from the corner of his eye.
It was the most important rule of them all because sometimes he struggled with one and two. Sometimes Steve threw his arm over Tony’s shoulder on instinct while watching a movie and Tony would lean his head down on Steve’s chest and there was no way he could bring himself to shake him off and scoot away. Instead he just sat there, placed his arm more firmly around Tony and enjoyed the moment.
Tony didn’t do it all that often, bring people home with him for the night, definitely not as much as Steve had been led to believe he had in the past. When Steve first met Tony, he had been in a committed, loving relationship with Pepper so the only woman around Tony had been Ms. Potts.
Steve laughed loudly and turned off the stove. He filled the bowl he had intended for himself and then thrust it at Tony. "Here, try this. I promise it won’t give you gas."
Other times Steve just didn’t feel very friendly at all; like the time Clint made Tony spill his coffee all over his shirt. Tony had swore and the next thing Steve knew Tony’s shirt was held clumped in his hand and all Steve could see was lean tanned muscle. It wasn’t the first time he had seen Tony shirtless, but it was the first time he had seen Tony shirtless and the only thing he could think about doing was reaching out and tracing the lines from Tony’s pectorals down to the dips on his hips. Steve tried to stifle the thoughts in his head but it was useless. He ended up making an excuse a few minutes later and raced to his room to change and then the gym to work out all the sudden tension in a way that wasn’t touching himself. Steve was pretty sure that masturbating to images of your friend couldn’t be considered friendly in any way shape or form.
He leaned down and picked Tony up carefully into his arms, cradling him to his chest and started walking him to his room.
It wouldn’t look good to have the Avengers leader sulking in a corner, picking at his collar, the entire night. So, Steve walked around, made small talk in three minute intervals with everyone who stopped him and tried to make it look like he wasn’t searching for one his team mates to latch on to
Tony’s arms went around his neck, face moving close, too close for Steve’s brain to work an active thought around. “They’ll look away, allow us to leave with no question, won’t suspect anything until it’s too late.”
He’d been right in the middle of a particularly satisfying dream, one that had him scrambling off of his mattress when the alarm has sounded, hot under his collar and straining in sweatpants that left little to the imagination. The still fresh memory of the dream didn’t help him concentrate any more, not when every time Steve tried he ended up with an eyeful of the jut of Tony’s hip bone, just visible from where his shirt was rucked up.
It was cowardly, sure, but it was what worked for him. When he wasn’t directly in Tony’s presence and as long as nobody mentioned him for too long, Steve found that he was able to go long periods of time without thinking of the other man.
Tony glowers at Steve, though it’s much more playful than that of his previous glare, “Sorry, whom the fuck?”
Tony remains frozen, eyes wide, but he can feel himself breaking down, can feel his breath stutter in his chest, can feel everything come crashing down, because dammit, he knew, he knew what she could do, and he should have kept his attention on her, but now- she knows. More importantly- she feels it, she understands it. He’d been trying to keep everything under wraps- HAD been keeping everything under wraps- and he was fine, he was doing fine, and then she had to go and touch him, feel his emotions- his PAIN- and oh, no. Oh, no, it’s all falling apart, he’s falling apart, he’s- he’s falling, and he’s on the ground, and he can hear Steve telling Mantis to go, go take care of herself, he can help Tony.
Tony hums into his coffee as little Peter rambles about his day, hands flailing to better explain his words. Steve watches amusedly, draping an arm on the back of Tony’s chair as their son enacted playing on the swings during recess. Smiling contentedly when Tony shifts closer into Steve’s side, Steve zones out, letting Peter’s voice fade into white noise- that is, until Tony stiffens by his side. Snapping back to
Peter sits in silence for hours, waiting for a response. The sun is beginning to set when he finally moves again, standing slowly. He wipes his tears away, sniffing loudly. Stepping forward and brushing his fingers over the tombstone lightly, he opens his mouth to speak- but he knows, knows that whatever he says still won’t be enough. So, Peter smiles shakily, taps the tombstone lightly, steps back.
With a soft sigh, Steve shifts so he can stand, stepping out to grab a towel and wrap it around his waist, turning back to help Tony out of the tub. He handed the shorter man a towel before draining the water in the bath. Turning back to Tony, he jumps slightly. Tony stared up at Steve, gaze unwavering, determined.
Tony turned to face him before shooting Clint a smug grin, "I hate to cut this short, Birdbrain, but I'm afraid I must talk to our very lingible Captain- privately."
Sorry I haven't posted in awhile, stuff's been going on. It should be noted, however, that I never planned to have a set schedule- but I didn't mean to wait this long. Please give prompts or suggestions or corrections, everything is welcome.
There will be another chapter today, that may or may not have to do with Steve getting nightmares ;)
After they wake up, many, many hours later, Steve makes Tony clean up the kitchen. He grumbles the whole time, but he’s secretly just glad that Steve is home.
When there was no response, Steve’s brow furrowed. Spotting what Steve had previously thought was a supply closet, he stepped towards it in hopes his boyfriend was in there, as he was nowhere else in sight. Poking his head inside, he realized that not only was Tony inside, but it was not a supply closet. Rather, it was a storage closet, the walls lined in boxes labeled “Howard S” and “Maria S” and “MIT” and simply “Old Things,” all written in Tony’s neat, tall writing. Steve’s attention snapped back to Tony, who was drinking scotch straight from the bottle in front of a projector, oblivious to Steve’s presence. The projector was running a film of a man standing in front of a model city. With a jolt, the Captain recognized the man as Howard, Tony’s father.
Tony simply nodded against Steve’s chest as JARVIS shut off the lights. As soon as Tony’s breath evened out, Steve closed his eyes. The last thing he remembered before slipping into a dreamless sleep was cursing Howard to the deepest depths of Hell.
He doesn’t know how long it takes, but Tony finally quiets to congested sniffles and hiccups. Steve shifts to look at Tony properly, lifting a hand to cup his jawline gently. “Hey, baby,” Steve hesitates, voice softening. “You feeling any better?”
“It was never me. I-I tried, and I tried, and- and it was never me.” Sinking to the floor, Tony hiccups softly. “You were the worst- the worst father ever- I- I hated you. I hate you. Wherever the fuck you are- I hope- I hope you know that Mom and I- we fucking hated you- Not that she was any better. She- she never stopped-“ He takes a shaky breath, “She never stopped you. But you- you deserved it. You deserved to die.”
Tony crosses his arms across Steve’s lower back and pouts, “I never said I wasn’t.” Then, “Where are we going?”
Steve laughs at the pout in Tony’s voice before he slips back under the covers. Tony immediately snuggles up again, sighing in content when they both relax.
Tony curls closer, pressing his face against Steve’s neck in attempts to stave off consciousness. Steve laughs quietly, pulling his boyfriend closer.
Angsty, and it kinda gets better?? Not as happy an ending as I would have liked, but it didn’t get worse so 0-0
Steve inhales sharply, freezing when Tony whipped around to face him. Tony struggled up onto his feet, swaying dangerously. He stumbled forward, and Steve stepped forward to catch him, holding the smaller man tight against his chest. Tony’s voice was muffled against Steve’s pec.
I read awhile ago a prompt where Mantis touches Tony and feels all his pain- so here’s that! :) Because we love to torture Tony, the poor man. Luckily, Steve is a very good boyfriend and he’s there when Tony falls apart. Enjoy!
Tony shakes his head. The trembling in his hands is getting worse. Steve speaks up again, “Tony- please. Just come up to bed.”
Steve runs into battle without backup and gets hurt. Tony patches him up and maybe yells a little bit. This ended up being a little angsty BUT it ends happily!! :)
The blond simply smiles up at the ceiling, trailing his fingers up and down Tony’s arm. Who was he to refuse his favorite genius? Besides, he knows Tony will be up and running at full power soon, so it’s best to savor the bliss while it lasts. As if reading his mind, Tony shifts a little, moving away to stretch languidly- Steve is briefly reminded of a cat. When the genius relaxes back into the mattress, blinking brown eyes blearily, Steve props himself up onto an elbow.
“LIAR- YOU TWO-FACED, DRUNKEN ASSHOLE-“ By now, Tony was screaming at where the projection once was, fists clenched, body tense. Steve blinked in shock, wishing he could reach out to Tony, but he was scared to.
At Tony’s failure to react to Steve’s attempt at an innuendo- or to react at all- Steve frowns and kneels in front of Tony, looking up to meet Tony’s glassy, unfocused eyes.
It could be Tony is alive and Steve is dead, and Tony is giving his heart away to the one man he felt deserved his real heart
Steve bites his lip, “You’re not him, either, you know.” When Tony glanced up, Steve continued. “Howard. You’re not him.”
He settled himself behind Tony, pulling the other against him, between his legs so that Tony’s back was pressed against Steve’s chest. Pressing a kiss to his boyfriend’s ear, Steve begins washing Tony, using slow, gentle strokes across his body. They were silent for long minutes, the only sounds came from Steve’s arm moving through the water and the soft puffs of breath through Tony’s nose. The silence didn’t last, however, because as soon as Steve finished washing Tony, he spoke.
So focused on Steve’s words and the sight of his hand shaking, Tony doesn’t notice Mantis sneaking up on him until her hand is already on his shoulder. He jerks away, moves to throw her hand off- but it’s too late. She’s already flinched away, making a choked noise. Belatedly, Tony realizes it’s a sob. Tears are brimming in her eyes, and everyone freezes. Mantis speaks shakily, “H-how do you l-live like this?”
“I came down to check on you. You’ve been down here for two days, is- is this what you’ve been doing this entire time?” At Tony’s silence, Steve scooped him up easily, carrying him away from the storage room, away from the memories of Howard, from the shattered glass that so painfully signified Tony’s broken past. He carried him to the elevator, up to their floor, into their bedroom, into their bathroom, sitting him down on the counter. Steve moved to start a bath before returning to Tony, looking him over for any glass stuck anywhere. Satisfied with his examination, he begins undressing Tony as the tub filled up. Anthony remained silent the entire time, slipping off the counter to undress his lower half as Steve began undressing himself, pulling off his shirt and dropping it to the floor in one fluid movement. Once both men were naked, Steve led Tony to the bathtub, reaching over to turn off the water before helping the brunet into the water, stepping in shortly after.
Howard swept an arm towards the city model, glancing back at the camera before bringing his arm back to his side, leaning against said model. “
He briefly considers arguing. Briefly. Instead, Tony sighs and curls up, pressing against Steve, who smiles faintly and pulls him that much closer. Together, they drift into comfortable unconsciousness.
Steve wakes up violently, and has a little trouble calming down. Tony eventually soothes him and happy endings all around! :)
He doesn’t know how long he’s cried for when the tears begin to slow, and he doesn’t particularly care. The aching in his chest is still there, and he figures it’ll be there for awhile more. When he can finally catch enough air to speak, he’s stuttering, wet and broken.
Hey!! We've all seen that post, what would happen if Peter snapped instead of Tony- so I decided to write it! This will be multiple parts, and hopefully I'll get the next part out soon. Questions, requests, and suggestions are always open! Thank you!
Tony flinches when he feels a hand settle gently on his shoulder, and it’s not until he looks up at Steve that he realizes that he can’t actually see, that tears are clouding his vision. He blinks, and they slip silently down his cheeks, and Steve reaches a hand up to gently wipe them away with his thumb.
At the sound of Howard’s voice, Tony glared at the projection, swaying slightly on his feet. Steve took a moment to make sure Tony wasn’t going to collapse, and his attention returned to Howard once he spoke again.
Steve opens his arms for Tony, and Tony obliges, settling against Steve silently. The good captain sinks his hand into Tony’s curls, stroking softly. Tony’s head is on Steve’s right pec, and his right hand is resting directly over Steve’s heart. He’s counting the beats in his head, giving himself something to focus on. It’s only a few minutes before Steve speaks gently, “You still with me, Shellhead?” Tony nods minutely, and Steve raises his free hand to rest over Tony’s- the one over his heart. “Get some sleep, sweetheart. I’ll be here when you wake up.” Tony offers no resistance, simply closes his eyes. Once Steve is sure that Tony is asleep, he closes his eyes, holds Tony a little closer, and drifts off.
He pauses habitually, waiting for a response. He can almost imagine he can feel Tony draping an arm around his shoulders, can almost smell his cologne. Peter’s breath catches in his throat, and he can feel the now-familiar pricking of tears behind his eyes. He forces a choked laugh,
He’s been working for far too long, he knows- He can see it in the trembling of his hands, can hear it in his unsteady breathing, can feel it in the numbness around his heart. It’s suffocating him, grabbing his heart and squeezing, expanding to fill his chest. But he keeps working, because he needs to fix this clusterfuck that has become life, needs to right the wrongs, needs to bring them back- Tony looks up when he hears the door to his lab open, scowling. That scowl deepens when he sees it’s the ever-great Captain America and that Mantis lady. Jerking his chin at them, “I can guess why you’re here, Cap, but what’s up with her?”
Tony nods weakly, so Steve stands, cradling Tony to his chest as he makes his way out of the lab and into the elevator, where it immediately begins moving to their floor. Both of them are silent the whole way up, and stay silent was Steve carries Tony into their bedroom. Steve sets Tony down on bed carefully before moving to their dresser, pulling out a pair of pj bottoms and one of his own T-shirts, closing the drawer with his hip and returning to Tony, who hadn’t moved a muscle. He was staring blankly at the carpet, and Steve feels a pang shoot through his heart again.
Tony was full on shaking now, what was left of the liquid in his bottle was sloshing against the glass walls holding it in.
He moves with Pepper, who's holding a bouquet in her arms, looking at him worriedly. He simply smiles faintly at her, taking the bouquet gently when they reach the lake they were holding the event at.
Tony laughs, and they fall into a comfortable silence that only lasts a few minutes until Tony breaks it with a whisper.
Outside, only friends are present. He smiles a little. This was heartwarming, to see so many loving people around. It made him feel better, made him happy for the fallen.
Tony tipped his head at the others and Steve before he was up and out of his seat, leading the women out to the dance floor, a hand already making its way to her lower back.
He walked in on Clint and Thor playing what looked to be a violent video game both on and off screen and Natasha and Bruce cooking something that smelled like beef and spices. Tony was nowhere to be seen and Steve didn’t want to admit he was relieved.
Luckily for him, they all must have been able to see that that was all he was willing to give up for now.
“Don’t be such a good citizen. None of them have been stuck without good food for a week. They’re fine”
They kept sparring until every muscle in Steve’s body ached in the best way. He collapsed back onto the floor and starred at the ceiling, breathing deeply.
Clint’s tears flowed freely, even as he smirked, “I wouldn’t have pictured that, you just seem—so wholesome.”
Tony laughed and took a bite of pizza. He made a show out of licking the slice before putting it in his mouth. “Everything deserves to be seduced Cap.”
Steve sucked in a breath, “no—“ but it wasn’t Bucky anymore, it was Peggy, aging so rapidly before his eyes, ‘you left me behind.’ He hadn’t meant to. He hadn’t tried to leave her behind but he had and now she was out of his reach too as he clung to not the train but this allusion that he was a part of this new world. He wasn’t. He knew that. He left her behind and all he wished now was that he’d just left.
Steve checked quick for any signs of Tony stirring and then walked around the couch towards Natasha, just in case. “I didn’t mean to.”
, “I’ve been in love just twice in my life. There was Natasha, for awhile, and I love her still. Maybe not in the same way, but I love her. And then there was Bobbi, and we could have been happy together, lived a nice, simple life, as simple as being badass SHIELD agents together can be. But I wanted something bigger, I wanted to be a hero and the price was that life. We’d have been so fucking happy though, I know it.”
If he hadn’t then, then he surely must have the second that Tony’s breath puffed out at his ear. Tony let out another long breath before he actually spoke, “They found an irregularity in their systems, nothing unusual enough for alarms, but their poking at it as we speak. The scans came in, 100% match to the droids. They’re stored at a base in Voxholm.” Tony paused, tapped his fingers at Steve’s waist, sounding preoccupied, “spin me.”
Tony’s face broke out into a triumphant grin and he pulled his hand away to high five Natasha. Steve felt it then, lightness all over, happiness spreading out in all directions at the sight of Tony’s grin. It came to a screeching halt when Clint groaned and complained about unfair speeches and plays on friendships.
Steve threw the book to the corner, where it left a nick in the wall, and fell back on the bed with a groan.
He realized he was staring at the entrance way where Tony had just disappeared when he was startled by Thor's outraged call of, "What is this? Such trickery from such a fair maiden! It is reminiscent of Loki!"
When Tony was done recounting their heroic rescue, one he made sure to let Steve know was 80 percent due to his own daring and intellect, 18 percent due to the others and, begrudgingly, 2 percent to magic, he hovered, hands restless as they rearranged the items on Steve’s bedside table.
It never got any easier with Tony. Just more and more complicated to the point where Steve wondered if he’d ever be able to get it in order again.
Something was there, now that Steve was really looking, was letting himself see and believe. Something sat between them, warm and simmering beneath the surface.
Steve shook his head, ran his hand over his hair “I do, I did. It was just a flook. It’s been a lot better.”
He was saved again, this time by Clint who threw a chip at Tony that managed to hit him right on the nose. "This is about as touching as a hallmark card, but can we move on? My blood sugar is probably through the roof just from watching you two."
Steve still hadn’t found a way to convey those feelings without giving away more than he was comfortable with. So, he left it alone even as it ate away at him. He let Tony keep to himself and told himself that when Tony did come around, he would figure it all out then.
Steve scoffed, took another bite “At least I don’t lick everything before putting it in my mouth” Steve didn’t actually have a problem with that, he often found himself distracted by the way Tony’s tongue would flick out right before it met the food.
The team made its way quickly to the stationed Quinjet where their suits and weapons were stored. Everyone changed as fast as possible, Iron Man already scanning the area for information.
When he had the batter poured into the waffle iron, he let his hands fall to his sides and stood there staring down at the counter. His hands curled into themselves, nails biting his palms. He needed to calm down. Tony was allowed to bring home whoever he wanted, whenever he wanted. Steve shouldn’t care.
Steve watched him, a shake of his head. That wasn’t what he meant. “No, I—“ He stopped when Tony stood, walking back toward the first aid compartment.
She wrinkled her nose and gave him a searching look for a moment. She sighed, “Right. You’re being genuine. Look, Steve, whatever you’re going through…maybe we just need to talk about it. I can help you—“
Steve felt himself tense, made sure to block out the images trying to come back. He tasted bile in his throat and swallowed to wash it down.
Steve doesn’t think of Mr. Stark, can’t think of Mr. Stark, will not think of Mr. Stark. “Yeah,” he chokes out, hands clenched in his lap.
He closes the notepad and brings it with him to the kitchen, hearing the voices of his teammates as he gets closer.
“Oh.” Tony’s eyes are wide, his voice barely a whisper, and he licks his lips unthinkingly. Steve darts his gaze down to catch the movement, the line of Tony’s tongue across his bottom lip, and opens his mouth. He doesn’t know what to say, if he even should say anything, so he lets out a small breath instead.
When he goes to the kitchen, after his morning jog, it is with intense trepidation that he sees Tony there, waiting for him.
Tony’s hands have wandered to Steve’s chest, down to his stomach, down to his - oh. He holds Tony’s face away from his own with his hands and stutters, “I - uh - oh god, Tony. It’s okay, you don’t have to -”
But then Tony moans, makes a tiny thrust with his hips into Steve’s hand, dragging that soft-smooth-warm skin along his fingers, and gasps wetly. Steve tightens his grip reflexively, though he’s not sure exactly how to make it feel good for Tony. Tony’s dick looks like Arnie’s, though Steve only ever caught glimpses of it in the showers at their school; a section of lighter skin towards the end, tapering up to the underside of the cockhead. No foreskin at all, so Steve isn’t sure if the strategies he uses on himself will work.
This is stupid, these feelings. Tony is so, so much, and Steve is barely anything at all. This is a futile attempt at grasping for something he doesn’t deserve. Tony would burn him up if he tried to get too close. Better to be happy with the longing, not daring to think this could be something more.
Steve looks up from Tony’s thigh, sits up so he can meet Tony’s gaze, and he sees no guile there. Tony seems, if anything, hopeful. His smile is small, not quite reaching his eyes, and he’s wrenching his hands together.
Tony grunts, whimpers, and pants softly. Steve’s gaze jerks back up to Tony’s hand and his groin, lingering on the small patch of dampness visible at the peak of the tent in his pants.
Tony wonders if this is what the Hydra Supreme had wanted. To break him so thoroughly that there is no fixing him.
Tony wants to die. He feels it more certainly now than he has in months, since… since they got out. Since he watched someone cuff the Hydra Supreme and lock him away.
“You’ll be a good dad, Tony,” Sharon says sadly. “I’ll have a friend leave them with you. I don’t care if you let him meet them, just…” She turns away again.
Or at least, that’s the effect it has on Steve. He has to carefully control himself when he talks to Mr. Stark, to keep a dopey smile off his face. Bucky used to tease him about the way he used to look at movie posters. He can only imagine how much worse it must be now.
“Iron Man - shellhead. That would mean the world to me, but I want to be able to explain this to Tony. I don’t want to - I - I’m not sure what I want. But I know I want Tony to know that I care about him, that he matters to me, and I don’t know how to do that besides with my own hands.”
“I’m not breaking up with you,” Steve says, sighing, trying not to let himself shout or explode or fall apart on the ground in front of Tony.
But when Tony sees him and wraps his arms around Steve, pulls him close and all but vibrates in his embrace, Steve has a hard time feeling guilty.
He dismisses the first out of hand; she probably meant that he loves Tony like she does - as respect, as gratitude, as comradeship.
Tony laughs and his cock bounces and Steve is completely mesmerized by the sight. He wants - he has no idea what he wants. He wants Tony, all of Tony, whatever Tony wants.
Steve stood, suddenly, and walked over to the stinger of the doombot that punctured Tony’s armor. He didn’t know what he was doing, or maybe he did, when he brought it back and kneeled in front of Tony. He took a finger and pricked it on the stinger, feeling the same falling of walls and doors in his mind that Tony must have.
Steve places a hand gently on Tony’s sternum, preventing him from leaning forward and stealing a kiss and thirty minutes of Steve’s time. “I haven’t seen Iron Man much around the mansion lately. Is he okay?”
Steve, might think of him in that way; that Sharon is, in some way, forgiving him; or that maybe Tony doesn’t need to be forgiven in the first place.
Steve hadn’t been circumcised before the serum, but a healthy dose of catholic guilt and no one very interested in a sickly stick of a boy added up to very little action. But after the serum, his body had decided it had had enough. Steve was going to get laid one way or another.
Jan grabs Ant-Man by the arm and drags him up from his seat. Steve is endlessly grateful for her ability to read the room, especially when Ant-Man is so inept at it. “We’ll go set up a movie, take your time,” she says, a little rushed, and Steve nods at her. He doesn’t move his eyes off of Tony, though.
“I think he might just be fucking with me,” Steve admits. The thought of Tony Stark genuinely desiring him is all but incomprehensible. It just doesn’t add up.
“I want to kiss you. Right now, but also all the time. I hate that I can’t stop myself from saying this, I hate that I kind of don’t want to, I hate that I’m losing control in front of you and I hate being weak.”
And then they must be close enough for Steve to notice that Tony is awake, because there is the sound of movement and then a hand on Tony’s forehead. It’s cool, which would normally feel nice on fevered skin, but it’s unbearable on Tony’s. His eyes flicker open for a moment and the sight of Steve smiling down at him hurts almost as much as the hand on his forehead.
They sit across from each other on couches that Steve no doubt bought. They have a similar look to the ones in Hydra Supreme’s facility. Tony’s stomach flips in fear when he sees them, when he remembers all the things Hydra Supreme did to him and Sharon on couches just like these.
“So you’re not - you don’t mind?” Steve tries to keep his voice neutral, even though his chest is swelling with hope.
Mr. Stark uncomfortable. He’s sure that they would be - Iron Man has never talked to Steve about people he is interested in, and Steve doesn’t exactly have anything to offer Mr. Stark.
He looks up to Tony, whose eyes are soft in the way that they only ever are when they’re looking at Steve. “Tony… I don’t… I don’t understand.”
“And maybe that something else will have someone as beautiful as Tony. Maybe that something else will have someone who will strive to treat him right. Maybe they’ll have something we never did.”
The next thing to draw his eyes is the shirt, crisp white and starched - did Tony do that for his sake? Most people don’t seem to starch their shirts anymore, at least not at the fancy events Steve saw Tony attending on TV. It’s smooth, too, not the kind of pleated look that most fancy shirts have. The wing tips carefully fall over Tony’s bowtie, glossy black silk that Steve wants to pull taught with his hands. It’s clearly hand-tied, but so well done that it might as well be one of those pre-tied things Steve has seen.
“Yeah, it was,” Steve scratches the back of his neck, embarrassed. “I just… no one really knew how to handle…”
He knows Mr. Stark probably doesn’t even notice, probably doesn’t have eyes for someone like Steve, but he can’t help himself from overthinking everything.
“Yeah. Does that feel good? I bet you usually take it slow, wait until you slick yourself up with your precum, but I’m not very patient. Want to suck you off. Want to feel you in my mouth.”
“That’s not true Tony, but it’s okay if you don’t believe me. I’m going to take care of you now though, okay? You’ve got a cut on your arm and I want to make sure it isn’t serious.” They should really get the Wakandan medics for this, but Steve knew that would be even worse for Tony right now, no matter what he said.
His brain doesn’t have the room to try to parse through the face Tony is making, besides that it’s as beautiful as all of the faces Tony makes.
“Please, Steve,” she says placatingly, almost servile, “you’re endangering him. He needs more time in the pod -“
Steve sits down hard on the cot, ruefully thankful for its presence. “Sorry I was so fast… I haven’t, uh. That was my first…”
“Not your fault,” Tony says, staring up at the ceiling, his bowtie askew from where it was pressed into the arm of the couch. Steve doesn’t even try to stop himself, just reaches over and straightens it with both hands.
Even if he weren’t the most attractive man on the planet - and Steve is certain he is - he’s so beautiful in this moment.
“Maybe I want to,” Tony said, voice low and fierce. Steve feels a yearning that that might mean something.
“Steve.” Tony looks horrified. “You’ve never gotten a blowjob before? You poor thing. Don’t worry, I’ll fellate you whenever you want.”
Steve can wait, though. It’s still hard to believe that Tony wants him at all. Sometimes Steve wonders if it’s just pity or obligation. Tony could do so much better than Steve; maybe he’s only staying so that he doesn’t hurt Steve’s feelings.
“Soup?” Tony quirks an eyebrow - god he looks so handsome when he does that, his brows so elegantly framing his face - and he looks genuinely interested.
Tony’s not half-bad himself. He’s not as well put together as he was on their first lunch, but he looks softer. His suit jacket is a little wrinkled, probably in meetings all morning, and his tie hangs loose around his neck.
“I mean that’s very flattering - for him, I’m sure that would be very flattering if he saw it, but, why are you drawing Tony Stark?” Iron Man shifts almost imperceptibly at his shoulder. Discomfort? Steve hopes not.
“I know that you don’t - that you aren’t comfortable with extravagant things. It doesn’t mean I don’t want to give them to you!” Tony says, interrupting whatever Steve had opened his mouth to interject with. “I want to give you the world. But, I know it makes you feel uncomfortable. Like you’re in my debt.”
Steve was none of that. Steve wasn’t an idiot, but he couldn’t hold a candle to Mr. Stark’s genius. He was too loud, too blunt, and too stupidly earnest. He would never be anything that Mr. Stark could want.
Tony feels like Sharon doesn’t understand what she’s doing to him. If telling him wasn’t supposed to be a punishment, he has no idea what this is.
Tony starts to drop down, kissing down Steve’s collarbones and chest, and Steve feels a lurch in the pit of his stomach. “Really Tony,” he says, “it’s okay. You don’t have to…”
Steve couldn’t bring his gaze from the bandage on Tony’s arm, couldn’t move his neck to look up, couldn’t move a single muscle in his body.
Steve has to be tactful here; if he out and out says he thinks Tony’s been softballing him, then Tony might get defensive. “It’s okay if you did think that - I know the, uh, mantle of Captain America has outsized weight for some people.” He tries to keep his voice as neutral and judgment free as possible. “I just - when it’s you and me, I don’t want you to, to get all caught up on that. I’m just Steve Rogers right now, talking to my friend Tony, you know?”
Tony moans again, slightly louder, and his voice sounds strained when he says, “a little help, here?”
If he opens himself up to hope instead of focusing on the things he can build, piece by piece, his hands in the loam, then he opens himself up to sheer and utter destruction.
“He made me want to live. He made me think that living might be worth it, when death was so inviting.”
Of course, Steve doesn’t actually have to do anything at all for his life to turn upside down. Mr. Stark sees to that.
When she says it to him, when he hears the words on Tamara’s lips, he laughs. They’re sitting in her diner, Tony unconscious in his arms, but somehow Steve isn’t afraid.
He holds the tray with one hand and gently opens the door, hoping not to interrupt Tony’s work. When he steps through the doorway, however, Tony isn’t at his bench at all.
There is a long pause before she speaks again. “It was an honor knowing you, Steven Rogers. Please take care, in our final days.”
Tony pulls away slowly, fluttering his eyes open, and looks at Steve carefully, cautiously. Steve’s breathing is heavier than it has any right to be after the serum. Tony is watching Steve intently and Steve knows he should reassure Tony, should say something, but the words are caught up in his head.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve says, knocking on the workshop doorframe. Tony smiles easily at the familiar intrusion, wiping a rag across his forehead and walking forward to meet Steve.
“Uh huh,” Steve says, looking down, looking anywhere that isn’t the curve of Mr. Stark’s lips, the bright shine of his eyes, the sweet line of his waist.
“It’s not uncomfortable,” Steve says with a small frown. “I just want to know if you’re serious or not.”
Iron Man nods, when Steve looks up at him. “I know what that’s like,” he says, his voice dark and distant like a storm cloud, like the shadow of a bomber overhead. “To have… to have… to have things taken away from you. Until it’s just you and your hands and the things you can do with them. Until you have no choice but to build your way out or die.”
He sees him in a ratty long sleeved shirt one night, coming up from the basement workshop. Asking where Jarvis is. Steve splutters for a few seconds, trips over his own words, before lamely saying he hasn’t seen him.
Steve smiles softly. Her eyes are dense with emotion, like neutron stars, and he wants so very badly to give her a hug, as if that might reassure her.
After a week of furious masturbation after every group dinner, Steve has decided he needs to do something about this. He decides to ask for advice.
grateful Iron Man is never there to call him on it. It’s a softer grin, just one corner of his mouth pulled back, and he’s looking at Steve intently. No guile on his face, just interest.
He shakes his head, trying to focus on the book in his hands. Iron Man is next to him, reading his own book, but he takes notice of Steve’s movement.
Steve’s hands are back, pushing him down, spreading across his chest. “Shhh,” Steve says, “rest.” He sounds fond; Tony hasn’t heard him use that tone of voice in years. Not with Tony, anyway.
Steve is so overwhelmed by thoughts of Tony that he doesn’t even notice Iron Man looking over his shoulder at his sketchpad. The atmosphere of the library is unusually quiet, cut through with mid-afternoon light.
He can’t spend too long looking through the sketchbook without getting a little too warm, a little too big in his clothes, so he quickly focuses on a new drawing. Thinks about what part of Tony he’ll draw this time.
When he wakes, it’s to large hands on his shoulders. Hands he’s dreamed about countless times. Tony wonders if he’s dreaming now.
“Yeah, and before it. We didn’t have a lot back then, so we had to make everything we did have last.” He laughs. “Lots of soup.”
They sit in companionable silence for a minute. Steve almost forgets that he’s sitting across from the most wildly attractive person he has ever seen. Tony’s got some kimchi juice on the side of his mouth, and Steve wants to say something - wants to lick it off, if he’s being honest with himself - but it’s so endearing. Seeing Tony Stark like this, warm and comfortable, makes Steve’s heart sing.
Tony can’t help how his body shrinks up on itself at the words. “Wasn’t yours either,” he whispers, not looking at her or the couches, eyes carefully affixed to the floor.
The Universe sits down where she’s standing, in the booth in front of Steve, harder than he’d expected. She looks tired, if that’s possible for a Universe to feel. Her hands go to her eyes and gently rub at the galaxies there, slowly try to push the stars back into alignment.
Soldiers propositioning him was exciting, in its own way. He knew they were interested in his body, not anything else about him, but for someone with little experience and plenty of desire, he would take what he could get.
“I don’t - oh. I mean, when I told you last week, you didn’t really seem to happy," Steve says, a little chagrined.
“That‘s the problem with being so bright. You can’t see yourself as you truly are; the light overwhelms you. And it was like that for me too; I would look at him and I couldn’t know what I saw. I was afraid that he was becoming something strange, something that couldn’t love me like I loved him.”
“Here, how about this: why don’t you flirt back?” Steve stares at her in stunned silence. “If he’s messing with you, maybe you have to mess with him too. And if he’s being genuine, then he’ll reciprocate! Win-win, in my book.”
“Hey there, handsome,” Steve says, and this can’t be real. It can’t. It hurts too much to be a dream, unless Tony’s brain has developed new and strange ways to torture him, but it can’t be real. “You were hurt pretty bad, but we’re taking care of you now.”
You can only cherish that which cannot be taken away from you. Only the things that you work for, strive for, yourself can be trusted. There is no gilt lily on this earth sweeter than the knowledge that you are free.
“And I wanted to take you somewhere nice. I have the money, and I wanted to show you what fine dining can be like in the future. It was an educational opportunity.”
“I’ve faced death so many times,” he laughs, his voice lighter than he feels like it should be. “But death never stopped me. It sure as hell never stopped Tony. I think death is a transformation, not a stopping point. Even when we all will cease to be, something else will replace us, if we let it.
He moves forward, rubbing a soft hand on Steve’s shoulder, and Steve is glad that this, at least, isn’t a mercy to him. He and Tony had built this - what they had - together, with their own hands.
They stand there for a long time like that, clinging to each other like they’ll collapse if they let go.
In the workshop is the motorcycle that Tony got for Steve, but broken up into all of its component pieces and scattered over Tony’s basement workshop floor.
He walks Steve down to the lobby of the mansion, chatting aimlessly as they go, and Steve’s having a hard time focusing on the words he’s saying. Steve nods where appropriate, moving only on instinct, because Mr. Stark is right there, hand on his back, so close he can smell his cologne.
She shakes her head, slow and wide like she doesn’t have to hide it. Like she’s intentionally changing the movement from - from how she did it then. “Not your fault,” she says again.
Tony looks down at himself, his cock pressing against his cummerbund, residual drops of pre-come wetting the fabric. “Well,” Tony says, “I had no idea the tux would do it for you like this, or I’d wear nothing else.”
“But it’s never been too much with Tony. Even when I was mad at him, it was never too much. I never stopped wanting him, wanting to be with him. Wanting him to know how wonderful he is.
If Jen and Robbie noticed their hands clasped together when they walked back to the New York portal to Avengers Mountain, they didn’t say anything. Steve looked up at Tony and smiled. Tony smiled back at Steve, and he felt like the sun had washed over him as they stepped through.
“No, no, I’ve had plenty of sex," Steve demurs. "I’ve just never had anyone… do that kind of stuff. To my…”
He didn’t tell Bucky or Toro, but his favorite movie he saw during the war was Arsenic and Old Lace. The younger Invaders thought it was weird and gross, but Steve felt an affinity for the bizarre and dark humor. He thought that if he had seen it while he was younger, and sicker, he might have wanted to be a writer like Mortimer.
“He does love you,” Sharon says, and Tony doesn’t have to ask who she means. “I don’t begrudge either of you that.”
“I said it because I meant it. You kept me alive. You got me out of there. It doesn’t have to be like - like what
Iron Man makes a choking sound. “Ah, fuck. I’m sorry. It was a lot to process at first, and then I got busy - we had a bunch of disturbances at our factories.”
Logically, he knew that it shouldn’t matter whether it was a man or woman that he found attractive. If there was anyone out there who knew that it was what was on the inside that counted, it was Steve. So, he knew all the logistics and he did truly believe that people should be allowed to love who they loved without persecution.  It was just, it always hit harder when it was happening to oneself.
Mattias shook both of their hands and wished them a good night, with a well placed wink to Tony when he thought Steve wasn’t looking, before he turned and disappeared into the crowd.
He ran his fingertips over the angles of Tony’s face and sighed to himself. He’d have to deal with it later. In that moment, he needed to get Tony up and into bed. He shook him lightly. “Hey, Tony? Wake up.”
Sharon Carter was great. She was funny and smart and once Steve looked past the Peggy factor in it all they really clicked.
Growing up, he’d had crushes on plenty of girls, even when they hadn’t necessarily liked him back. And during the war, he’d found Peggy and he’d loved her. He liked to think that if he hadn’t gone down in that plane he would have had the chance to have a life with her. He would have courted her and taken her dancing at the Stork club.
The elevator only takes a few moments before he's deposited on the very top of Stark tower, now mostly called Avengers Tower due to the huge 'A' lit up on the side and the fact that the Avengers reside here.
It—didn’t help Steve clear his head any. Not with Sharon right there, resting her head against his other shoulder, fingers intertwined with his.
Today Tony needed to be pulled away from his lab so that he could eat because Steve found out that the entire time he had been trying to keep his distance, Tony had been lacking in nutrition and that was just no good for a member of his team.
The trip to the hotel to pick up their things, along with the trip to Voxholm, was silent, wrought with an underlining tension that crept in the minute they stepped foot into the car outside of the restaurant. Steve couldn’t shake it no matter how hard he tried, not that he could really claim he tried very hard.
Tony just smiled back, mouthed ‘good morning’ to him, and then compelled Nicole to follow him out of the room with his eyes alone.
Tony gave Steve a short, thoughtful look, “that could work.” He stood, slapped his hands loudly onto the table, startling Clint from his sleep, probably on purpose, “now that that’s all settled out, you can all go back to bed—not you Steve, you need to start prepping, we leave in five hours.”
Steve shook his head to clear it. There was a tangled mess taking form inside him, only kept at bay by a shard that grew dimmer and dimmer by the minute, a minute belief that Tony was somehow okay. Surely he’d feel it if he were gone, he’d know somehow.
For the first few minutes everything went well. The droids were bursting in the air, some knocked down so that they were just close enough for Steve’s shield to take them out, and the bridge was steadily being cleared in an almost orderly fashion give or take a few hysteric people.
Steve rolled his eyes and handed it over, watched as he took a big bite out of it before turning and walking over to the couch Tony kept down there. He gave Dum-E and U pats as he passed them by and smiled when they both chirped at him in return. "Make sure you chew this time."
Steve felt the heat flood his face, opened his mouth to respond and all that came out was, “I want to suck you off so badly right now.” He snapped his jaw shut, eyes as wide as Tony’s were.
Now he can be around her without looking, without watching, and it feels like relief. Like stretching his legs after sitting down for a long time.
After an hour of trying to draw the Iron Man armor and failing, he gives in and opens to a blank page. He sketches in fits, anxiously watching the door in case anyone came in and caught him. Not that they would be able to see, but somehow that thought didn’t reassure Steve much.
Sometimes it’s through his whole body, starting from his belly and rolling up through his shoulders and his face and ringing out clear. Those are Steve’s favorite laughs. Each one feels like a triumph.
“I made it myself. You’ll definitely impress them, wearing a Van Dyne piece, and it’s free advertisement for me.” Steve doesn’t really feel like it evens out, but he’s kind of afraid of Jan when she’s talking about clothes, more so than when she’s flying through the air and shooting bio-blasts at the bad guys.
I promise I want to try,” Tony said, smiling softly at Steve. “I love seeing you on your knees in front of me.”
“We decided we’d try to spice up the evening,” Tony says, going low and husky on the last. “She brought two vibrators - you know what a vibrator is, right Cap?”
Tony is numb. Usually he feels everything too much, too intensely, but somehow his brain must be broken, because he’s sitting here on the floor and he’s certain he might never feel again.
Tony steps out of the elevator and strides over to Steve, grinning. “Jan said she was getting you some duds, but it looks like she really hit it out of the park!” Tony says, throwing an arm around Steve’s shoulders and steering them outside.
Tony laughed and laughed, let the tension in his body roll out of him from his belly to his mouth, his free hand clasped over his chest. Steve couldn’t help laughing with him.
Jarvis is spreading food on the table before either of them can think of what to say to continue the conversation.
It’s vibrating to his touch, and Steve suddenly realizes exactly how this situation must have arisen. He can see Tony putting on his fancy duds in his mind, easing the vibrator against his hole, before putting it in and filling himself up. Was this - was this for Steve? Because of the drawing?
“I will leave you two to your devices, but I must keep Ms. Devoux for a while longer. There are things I need to do still, while I have time.”
Mr. Stark laughs. “No problem. Most restaurants won’t be too concerned about what you wear as long as you have a shirt and shoes.”
“But a weapon being used against civilians isn’t the fault of the weapon, just the fault of the user,” Steve counters. “It’s not the weapon’s fault that a soldier uses it for terrible ends.”
Tony is quite the kisser. His tongue is slow, gently probing, squirming in Steve’s mouth but not pushing. It feels nice. He thinks idly to himself that he’d like to do this with Tony for a long, long time.
“When I moved myself off of teams with you, it was because I was afraid of what I would do if I saw you. I didn’t deserve to be on a team with you. I wasn’t good enough. You should have had people who would treat you better.”
Tony’s look of relief is stunning; almost blindingly gorgeous on his face. The anxiety melting away, his wide, easy smile, and the soft fondness of his eyes are almost enough to make Steve want to look away.
But no, Iron Man sounded more surprised than jealous. He just needs time to adjust to the idea that Steve might have feelings for his employer. He needs time and space. That’s fine, it’s not as if the feelings - or Steve and Tony - are really going anywhere.
Before he had Bucky and Toro to confide in, he took to drawing the stars he fell for. He had pages and pages of Katherine Hepburn, Vivienne Leigh, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart.
Steve allows himself to look at Tony, uninterrupted by fear or shame. He is gorgeous, somehow even better in the whole than the parts that compose him. He is a blur of motion settled into skin and Steve never wants to stop trying to capture Tony with his eyes.
Tony meets his gaze for a moment and Steve smiles before looking away. He has to be normal - if he looks away too quickly, Tony will know something is up. It takes all his self control, though, feeling an electric current through his body when Tony looks at him.
In a moment, the Universe is gone. The windows are as whole as they were when Steve and Tony stepped into the diner earlier that evening, and Tony’s body is repaired. Tony’s still straddling Steve’s thighs, a little bit dazed and a little bit annoyed.
“What kind of food do you want?” They’re walking out the front door of the mansion, down to the 5th Avenue gate where Mr. St - where
Their noses bump and their teeth clack together and it’s awkward and a little desperate, but once Tony has his knees under him and isn’t clinging on to him for dear life, he smiles at Steve. And Steve smiles back.
The facility they’re in isn’t as dark, isn’t as cold, isn’t as cramped as the caves, but it feels like a prison all the same. The thing, whatever it is, has tried to add personal touches. A picture of Tony and Steve. A picture of Steve and Sharon. A picture of all three of them that it took, where Sharon and Tony both look into the camera with smiles on their faces and dead eyes, like they’ve been taxidermied.
Tony makes a shocked little noise, and Steve can’t open his eyes to see Tony’s face even if he wanted to. His whole body jerks, shakes, and hitches to the rhythm of his orgasm.
“Are you -“ Tony begins to ask, but Steve puts his hands on Tony’s shoulders, rubbing them gently. Tony jerks his head down to look at Steve’s hand, then slowly raises his head until he’s looking at Steve again.
“I can… I can explain to him…” Iron Man says, still sounding as if he is speaking to Steve from Jupiter.
“I’m 23,” Tony says. “And you could be a supermodel if you wanted to. Hell, you are probably the hottest man on earth by any attempt at an objective standard. But I don’t really care about that. I just, really like you.” Tony sounds almost shy as he says it. “You care. You argue with me when you think I’m wrong. You’re really smart about people, and funny, and sweet. You don’t mind that I’m a workaholic or that I have more money than any human being should own. I just, really like you.”
But he can’t get carried away with fantasies right now. Tony’s whimpers may be hot, but he needs Steve’s help.
“I was afraid, so I hurt him.” He says it matter of factly, as if he didn’t feel crippled with guilt for what he’d done. “I’ve never been much good at trusting people, even when I should have trusted Tony.
When Tony slides the paper over to Steve, he tries to read the face Tony gives him, the face he lets Steve see.
Having Sharon there is almost a comfort, when the thing in Steve’s skin makes them tell it they love it. Tony can look at her sidelong when he says, “I’ve loved you for years, since the first time I met you,” and know that it’s true, even if it’s not for this Steve. He can look at her as she says, “I love you so much I’ve died for you before. I’d die for you again. I felt like I was dying when I lost your child.”
But instead of going down on him immediately, Tony just lets his hand glide back up. He takes more long, slow pumps, kissing Steve’s inner thigh and massaging Steve’s ass, and it feels amazing. He didn’t know it could feel like this.
Iron Man is right. Paul Newman isn’t his type, but the man is handsome. He can’t stop looking at Elizabeth Taylor, though, and Iron Man catches on quick.
“No, no, no, hey, look at me?” Tony says, gently stroking Steve’s cheekbone with his thumb. Steve turns back to look at Tony reluctantly, keeping his face as guarded as he can. “That was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen. I don’t - that was me, making you feel that way? Extremely humbling. I wish I could show you how beautiful you look right now, honestly it’s making me wish my ass weren’t so sore because I want you to fuck me so badly.”
feeling like I don’t have a say in my life. But I might hate seeing you look sad even more than that.”
Tony immediately grinds his hips into the couch and groans. Steve thinks he might come in his pants if he so much as breathes too suddenly, his whole body shot through with arousal at the sight of Tony so thoroughly taken apart.
“Okay, Cap. Suit yourself,” Tony says, shrugging. Steve loves the way his suit hangs on his shoulders, the way his shoulders move as he shrugs, the way Steve’s gaze gets to linger on Tony’s face when he’s not looking at Steve. He wants to follow Tony back to the office, wants to stay with Tony wherever he goes, but he really, really can’t do that.
Tony sputtered and gasped. “Right. We’re leaving. I’m going to get FRIDAY to schedule something, for both of us, with the best therapists I can afford. Or maybe T’Challa has therapists on call? That seems like something Wakanda would have fixed by now, but who knows.”
“Oh! Have you ever had Korean food?” Tony says, but keeps talking before Steve has the chance to say anything. “There’s a lovely little Korean Barbecue place I’d like to show you. I think you’ll enjoy it.” He smiles at Steve and winks, and Steve can feel all of the blood in his body rush to his face and his dick.
“I do feel safe. But you’re right, I shouldn’t be acting like we could run out of food at any moment.” He ducks his head. “Sorry.”
“Well, you just did, so I’d say mission success. I’d laugh until my jaw fell off if it made you happy.”
Tony sighed, leaning down into the touch, pressing his cheek to Steve’s temple. “I missed you too, winghead. I missed you too.”
Tony’s face twisted with something Steve couldn’t identify. Grief? Disgust? He wouldn’t blame Tony if that was what he felt.
But Tony doesn’t get what he wants. Tony doesn’t get what he wants, no matter how badly he wants it. He especially doesn’t get Steve.
It’s something else. It’s more than he can handle. His balls have been tight under his dick since Tony started this, but now they feel like they’re going to come off. His whole body tenses, jerks, and he’s coming on Tony’s mouth.
Just on his lips, and his well groomed mustache. Just on his teeth and his tongue. Just on his eyes, his beautiful eyes. When he first meets Mr. Stark, they remind Steve, for a terrible moment, of the Atlantic Ocean. But the color means something more to him now, something better, now that it’s Mr. Stark’s eyes. That deep grey-blue is so, so pretty.
, Steve thinks. Why would Tony Stark do this himself? Surely he can get updates from Iron Man, and Steve asks Iron Man a
Steve’s not sure Tony will ever understand. Even after their conversation, Steve isn’t very convinced.
And they did last. When Steve went down in the Atlantic, he had no regrets about that. Sure, he didn’t want Bucky there, but this is just about how he would picture it to go. He’d die fighting, and maybe if he was good enough, he would get to see his mother again.
After another long, long silence, Tony says, “I meant it too. What I said. For… for similar reasons.”
“It’s not -“ Tony laughs, “it’s not nearly that simple. The pentagon’s budget is massive. They’re a big part of the reason that Stark Industries has been profitable enough to be able to fund the Avengers in the first place. Part of what I’m trying to do is convince the board that we have enough avenues of funding to be able to work on infrastructure projects. Any kind of move away from contracts with the military means losing money and stability.”
He nods at her and it feels like a question. She nods back and it’s the worst answer Tony can imagine.
Steve’s fists were clenched on his thighs, shaking slightly with the effort it took to keep himself from punching something. The ground. The busted plates of Tony’s armor. Mostly himself.
Some indeterminate time later, Iron Man stands up from his seat, jerking Steve out of his concentrated scribbling.
Steve hates gifts more than anything. Giving them is frightening, the knowledge that your efforts - more importantly, your money - could be wasted on disappointment. Receiving them… receiving them is a hell not worth contemplating.
“Well, I’m sorry that my ass is out of commission, but I can still, I mean, if you want, we could -“
He might allow himself to believe “Tony can take care of me,” or “Tony loves me,” or “Tony will never leave me.”
They keep speaking, but it’s easier for Steve than before. Knowing that Tony won’t avoid hard topics for Steve’s comfort makes it easier to trust him when he talks about less contentious things.
He remembers what Jan said. He’s fought nazis and Namor - surely a little flirting can’t be so bad. “I missed you,” he says simply, and has to fight his wince. It sounds pathetic to his ears, but Tony just blinks.
He can’t remember pain like this since he took off his helmet in the red zone. The pain then curled around every muscle in his body and pulsed in rhythm. Tony feels like it’s a little gauche, but he was almost impressed with the hurt. If he was a masochist, he thinks that’s the sort of pain he’d like.
Tony’s voice was barely a whisper. “I thought so many times about ending it. In my worst fantasies, the ones I tried not to let myself imagine, you would come to the funeral. You would cry. You would finally… you would finally…” he breathed for a long, slow moment. “You would finally feel something like what I felt for you. I only survived because Carol was there and she was too stubborn to let me die. I would have done it, I wanted to. I didn’t - not by my own hand, I didn’t want you to think less of me. But in battle, protecting someone. I thought,
But Tony is grinning, sperm in his mustache, and shakes his head. “That was amazing. I got you off just from that? You must be the horniest man alive.” He pulls Steve over to the cot Steve has been chiding him about in the corner of the workshop and uses the blanket to wipe off his face and Steve’s still weeping dick.
Steve chances a peek at Mr. Stark’s face, trying to understand what is going on. He’s grinning, but not his full on all out grin he does for cameras - Steve watches all of his press appearances religiously, and is
“It’s a toy, for stimulation. You turn it on and rub it on yourself and it feels real nice.” Jan says, as if that is a perfectly normal thing to talk about.
“Yes,” Steve says immediately, unable to take his eyes off of Tony’s lips. He’s not entirely sure what Tony is offering, but he feels certain that he wants whatever Tony is willing to give him.
that’s happened - but he can’t help the little bit of him that hates Steve for asking that, for even thinking it. The little bit of Tony that imagines Steve being jealous of the Hydra Supreme can’t stop from hating Steve for it.
And his smile. His eyes thin and his lips spread and it feels like all of the warmth in the world is in your chest and your face. He would grin and you would think “I would do anything to make you look at me like that.”
“I l - I care about him so much. So much it hurts, sometimes. But I can’t - I don’t want to delude myself into thinking everything can last forever. And I don’t want to kindle something false in myself, like the idea that charity is more than pity, or that a gift can ever last.”
Tony interrupts his thoughts with a grin and a shake of the head. “Stop overthinking this, Steve. If we’re lucky, it’ll never come up and we can live out our retirement here together, you still under my roof.”
“Little did she know,” Tony continues, “I have a good deal more stamina than she. She held out, I’ll give her that, but with the drinks in our system, she was out after half an hour of dancing. Passed out right on the dance floor. Slept like a truck in the limo back.”
“Hey, Cap, good to see you! Sorry I wasn’t around today, I had a ton of work at the office.” Tony sounds earnest in a way that leaves no room for doubt in Steve’s mind that he could be lying.
“I can’t be around when he looks at them,” Sharon says, hand going to her stomach, “and sees us. I… I can’t.”
“Aww, thanks Tony, but it’s really no big deal. I’m sure you must know a bunch of languages, genius like yourself.”
Tony sighs deeply. “I’m not sure that I can explain to you the way the scale of war has changed, Cap. We’re not talking about soldiers with guns killing a civilian on accident. We’re talking about unmanned drones blowing up schools and hospitals because the military thinks a high value target is inside. We’re talking about landmines left in place for decades waiting to blow up whatever hapless child steps over them. It’s not trenches in fields anymore, it’s fighting in the midst of people’s lives.”
Best of all, Tony eats dinner with them, something Steve has never seen him willingly do. Iron Man always says that Tony has work, so it’s gratifying to see Tony sitting down next to Steve, smiling at him, eating the same food as the rest of them.
Tony blinks twice, uncertain for a moment. “Oh, uh, well, you know, doing much better now that I’m having lunch with my favorite Avenger.”
“I promise, he really isn’t. I’ve seen Tony mess with people before, trust me I have, and that is not the way he treats you.”
“I’m a coward sometimes, especially about you. I don’t want you to get hurt, but more than that I don’t want to jeopardize everything we had, even if I should have, to keep you safe. I’m sorry that I failed you, Tony, you deserve a better man than me.”
He’s so preoccupied with thoughts of his sketchpad and the drawing that he almost doesn’t notice the soft moaning from the couch tucked against the workshop wall.
“But once you’re away from the light, a little less blinded by it, you can see him with clear eyes. Tony was changing, but I wasn’t losing him. Change is natural. Change isn’t the end. I wish I could have seen that sooner.” He sounds so tired, in his own ears.
But Steve loves Tony so much it fills his chest and limbs and makes them feel like they could burst, or float, or maybe something of both. He is so afraid of losing the one thing in the future that feels right, the one thing that has made him think, “maybe surviving the war wasn’t a mistake.”
“If I want something to last, I have to build it with my own hands. Do you see? I have to make it mine, or it will forever be something someone can take away. I don’t want to forget and,” his breath catches in his throat. “I don’t want to forget and be hurt again,” he finishes, quietly.
“I know. I know, and I care about you too Tony. You’re the - you’re very important to me. I am happy with you. I don’t need this,” he gestures at the motorcycle behind Tony, and Tony winces. “I don’t need you to prove anything.”
“I wish I could. I know it’s fucked up to want that, because you’re your own man, I hate,” Tony gasped deeply, like he was drowning, “I
Tony wants to die. He considers it every day: trying to escape so it will end; finding something sharp; finding something poisonous; or even just asking Sharon to do it.
“When your eyes are looking so far ahead and so far away, you get lost in the place that you haven’t reached yet.” Steve is surprised at his own words. Is this him speaking, or Captain Universe pulling these thoughts out of him?
Steve knows he shouldn’t want it - but he thinks so intently in that moment of leaning over and kissing Tony. What would Tony feel like under his lips? Would he open his mouth and taste like curry? Would he lean into it or let Steve lead? Would he touch Steve?
After the pause in their conversation from the food arriving, Steve takes the opportunity to clear the air. “I know we, uh, disagreed a bit when we last had lunch.”
Tony had been courteous, when he found out Steve had bought a small condo with his back pay from the army. Now Steve knows that Tony was hurt. He thought Steve was snubbing the mansion.
Tony nods dumbly along as it speaks, but Sharon catches his eye. She looks at him fiercely, raises her chin, and says, “I do love you,” to Tony.
Tony opens and closes his mouth - the urge to kiss him then comes unbidden to Steve and he has to clamp down on it - and then nods sullenly. “If?” he asks, looking down at his plate.
“I don’t… I can’t… Tony, this is too much,” Steve chokes out, unable to say the words echoing in his head.
When he’s done, stomach full to bursting and brain barely functioning, Tony leans forward toward him. “Enjoy yourself?” He asks, grinning.
“This is somehow worse than that time that Wanda magicked me drunk and made me almost kill the Latverian ambassador. At least then I could try to convince myself that it wasn’t my fault, even if I wasn’t very good at it. God, I’m reminiscing about mind control to stop myself from saying anything else and making you even more mad at me. I hate when you get mad at me, except I also like it a little bit because at least then you pay attention to me instead of shuffling me off to a different Avengers team because you can’t look at me anymore. I wish I could get rid of myself so easily, I would have done it ages ago,” he said. Steve could tell he was trying to make a joke, but it just sounded pained in his voice.
He doesn’t see Tony all day. Steve decides that the best way to work off his nervous energy is to draw, but the only thing he can think of is the image of Tony, vibrator rubbing his tender hole, fucking into him.
Tony pulls back Steve’s foreskin and then holds his hand there, no longer pumping. Steve’s hips pitch involuntarily, trying to pull away so he can keep going, keep feeling that intense pleasure. Tony’s other hand holds his ass in place.
Tears fall from her face, droplets of dark matter and interstellar gas, and supernova on the floor of the diner.
Iron Man turns to look at him as he rises out of the chair, the swift flick of his chin and the tilt of his head indicating a question.
