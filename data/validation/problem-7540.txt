“I’m fine.”
“Hmm, excuse you,” Tony said. The guard passively looked at them, both bored and slightly less impressed than he should be. “This is Avengers’ business.” He held up the shield a little to show the soldier.
As he watches her intensity, he cannot help but tease her a bit. “Now pull it out, gently, and just make sure you don't touch the s-.”  The monitor to the side he’s hooked up to his chest to capture his vitals buzzes. He yelps and says, “Sides-.”
“I’m sorry. You startled me. I usually don’t have to worry about sighted people in my space. It’s uncomfortable for me,” Tony says. He yanks off the gloves. “I know that sounds weird, especially since I hired you to help me with my work. I planned on having you work on the other side of the lab, not here. This is my space.”
Tony smirks. Hint acknowledged; hint ignored. “No, we’re going to call Richards.”
“Not in our reality, no. But in the reality you lived in – yes.”
Steve realizes he’s standing there with his mouth open and quickly shuts it.
“Maybe after the Council meeting, we could come back here. Forget about everything else, everyone else. Just us,” Steve said. His large hand never left Tony’s cheek as he gazed into Tony’s eyes, not shying away from his alienness. “I want to be with you, Tony.”
Tony puts a slight pressure inside of him, as if he’s opening his fist just slightly. It catches Steve’s breath, emptying his lungs of air. He gulps and jerks. “Please.” Full tears stream across his face and he knows now he’s always starved for this moment – this moment that fills him and torments him all at the same time.
Steve hates it, loathes having to do this to Bucky, because he knows what Bucky has endured at the hands of a mad man who didn’t even have the blessings of the Confederacy for his actions.  Bucky hisses at him, deranged and out of his mind as they yank his mouth open and pour the tincture of liquid down his throat. He coughs and gags but isn’t able to spit it up despite trying. With Steve holding his jaw shut and Bruce pinching his nostrils closed he has no other choice.
Logan throws a few crude remarks his way but Steve only shakes his head and continues. He cannot believe how much his palms sweat.  It seems to take forever to ascend to the second floor of the saloon. Peering over the railing to the downstairs, Steve meets Natasha’s gaze and she winks at him, shooing him with her hands. Taking a deep breath, Steve turns to the doors to the rooms. He knows that the first room to the left is the largest, nicest room with a good view of the mountains and a large bed, a good lock on the door. It’s been a nice place to house some of the better visitors in town when the Parlor Inn is all booked up.
“Well that’s a pleasant thought,” Tony says.
“You have to understand,” Clint said. His voice hushed in the dim light. “I had no other choice. They have my family.”
Nevertheless, he successfully escapes and gets to his suite of rooms, which have always been ridiculously huge. He stows his duffle in the closet in the bedroom and places the portfolio on the desk. He slumps down on the bed. He handled that with all the grace of a clown. He’s going to blame it on the horrendous headache lingering from the night’s revelries. Going to the ensuite bath, he downs a few aspirin when someone knocks on his door.
What cleared everything up was Bruce.  He happened to touch Steve’s wrist, the heated band of welted flesh and Steve hissed. Not from the touch, not from any pain on his wrist, but from something inside. Something horrible and beautiful. An ache so true and pure that he shuddered in its wake. He clutched the edge of the table with his other hand, hearing the wood crack and splinter even as he watched Bruce fall away and groan. The scientist grabbed his own wrist and wilted to his knees.
The cut of pain and sorrow in Steve’s voice when he beseeched her still troubles Tony today.  He’d demanded an explanation, but never truly received one. What their visitor had told him had been more than cryptic, it had been downright confusing as hell.
“So you’re sick,” Tony says. “I have money, I could get the best doctors in the world.”
“I don’t think you need to worry about the scars,” Steve said even as he rubbed the side of his neck. Maybe the bruises were still there. Maybe his body just hadn’t healed anything after they’d taken so much of his blood. Maybe that was the change seeded deep inside of him. Maybe what happened deprived him of his life with the serum.
The Hub.
The one that Tony assumes in the local leader inches out of his doorway. He’s wearing a scarf on his head and long robes, but Tony can spot military boots under the hem of his robe. The man’s eyes are squinting, and wrinkles mark his face, though Tony thinks he’s younger than he looks, probably around Tony’s age or a little older. He’s had a hard life.
They both startle at the sound of Nat’s voice and Steve’s legs give out. She rushes to his side and takes his other arm to put it over her shoulder.
By the time he enters the kitchen the chef – an older woman with a look of a Pekingese dog that Tony never remembers exactly her name– has served an amply pile of blueberry waffles (not pancakes), alongside a bowl of fresh fruit, and a carafe of coffee. Next to his plate there is an empty plate waiting for an order. Tony asks, Mrs. Merry (well that’s what he’s going with right now and she doesn’t correct him) to load his husband’s plate up with eggs, bacon, and some waffles. Merry nods and toddles off to prepare the meal.
He turns back to Tony to find him looking away into the trees of the park where there are dark shadows. Steve wonders what he sees.
Fuck, that was the least of the guards’ worries. “I’m calling in the authorities,” Tony said. He tugged out his phone and still Rumlow did nothing. He stood there, stock still and smirked at Tony. This was so much worse than Tony realized. He considered Rumlow and his stone expression. Right now, Tony needed to focus so he went to Pepper, leaving the guard to his own devices as he punched in the call to the Air Force. No signal. The call failed.
Steve grasped them. “Yeah. Exactly.”
“Getting there,” Steve says and cannot deny he’s happy that Tony is at least speaking now, forming sentences. His brain seems to be taking into account everything that’s going on around him.
Bruce folded his hands in his lap. “You know, before this I was in India. Minding my own business.”
“Take off the gag. I’m sure the Captain won’t bite his own agent,” Ross said. Pierce stepped to the side of the Secretary. His eyes narrowed as he silently observed.
"Like what?"
“Oh nothing, just going into cardiac arrest, because you-.”
“That’s not Steve,” Bucky said under his breath. He hung back in the crowd, but Tony heard it in his head. He peered over to Bucky. The man grimaced and shook his head slowly.
“Keys?” Steve asks.
“You were in a pack before?” Tony narrowed his eyes as if he could read the truth of it on the fine lines of her face.
Tony leaned down and kissed Steve. It was more clinical than passionate. His mind still juddered along, analyzing and evaluating. Steve read him too well. He flipped Tony over and pulled back.
“Talk about what?” Tony opens up a container, can’t tell what it is, and then puts it back. “Do you like tuna? I know how to make a tuna sandwich.”
“Maybe you should be honest with me,” Steve says.
Tony considered it; it all seemed reasonable enough. Yet something niggled at the back of his brain. “But what about you? Tell me that way back when you never considered being with – well – a guy?”
“Oh.”
The anger dissipates and Steven drops to his knees. “What would you have me do?”
Injured? What the fuck was happening? When did it happen that he wasn’t in the loop? He couldn’t hold anyone accountable. Tony decided his path when a madman blew up his house and his girlfriend almost burned to death. He’d made the right choice. “Injured?” He found himself saying.
“Will do.”
“Are you sure? You looked positively delightful.” He goes to the kitchen. “All you have are bananas.”
“The Fae?”
Bucky only twisted his mouth in muted glee at Sam’s turn of phrase. Tony rolled his eyes and assured, “Yes. We’ve come to an understanding.” He tried to step around Sam, but a hand on his arm stopped him.
With a prod, Steve shifts around and looks at Tony. His eyes are bright and clear, his features twisted with pain.
“Hey Buck. Been missing you. I left Brooklyn over three months ago. The cruiser I took was fucked or something, but I made it. I do not like spaceflight. Prime Station is a great place, lots of advancements and nothing in short supply. I can actually bathe! I got a pretty good deal going here. I work with Natasha Romanoff.” He stops and then erases everything. “Fuck.” He finds tears in his eyes. “Why do I feel like I’m disappointing everyone?”
Steve nods, then remembers himself. “Okay. I’ll be in the main cabin if you need anything.”
Tony’s eyes go wide with shock and horror.  The passageway gets smaller, confined, and the pounding of Steve’s heart mirrors the ache from his chest wound. He shakes his head at Tony, still unable to formulate decent words to explain.
Tony only frowns but concedes. Grasping his hand, Steve tows him to the bedroom while he tells JARVIS to dim the lights Tony interrupts him, “Not all the way. I want to see you when you come inside of me.”
She ignored his protests. “Clint can’t keep the doors closed forever.” She bent down and brought Steve to his feet. Steve’s legs nearly collapsed under him. His lips were colorless, his eyes sunken. “Help me save him.”
As Tony stares at Bruce, listening to the words, the sunlight illuminating the workshop flickers. Clouds outside the wall of windows obscure the sky, block the sun. It feels colder in the room, though it shouldn’t. The room is climate controlled. JARVIS knows exactly the temperature Tony’s likes it at – but then why is it freezing all the sudden?
Steve threw his arms over his head, closed his eyes, and sighed. "We're not dating, darling. Don't go there."
“Jesus, how long have they had you here? What the hell is going on?” Tony says and he catches sight of the chains, the thick ugly manacles, around Steve’s wrists and his ankles. There’s something draped over him, a scaffold to hold him down. Tony isn’t sure, he can’t discern the details in the low lighting.
“Who?” Tony grips Steve’s hand. “Who the hell are you?”
“I can do that.” He glances around the room. There’s the obligatory eye chart, a number of instruments that Steve can’t identify as well as a number of posters detailing the anatomy of the eye and the brain. He has a pretty tough resolve, but he never liked looking at anatomically correct drawings that have the organs dissected open.
“Shit. Friday, unblock Steve’s number. Send text: you are still under the non-disclosure agreement. Breach of the NDA will lead to prosecution.”
The direction surprises Steve, but he follows the group through the door and sees that it is an interrogation room. It’s not morose or morbid, but a simple room with a table in the middle and chairs. It reminds Steve of a police interrogation room, not something the military might use.
Was Steve running? Hiding from them? Was that the cause of the coma?
So why was it decades later he asked for the fool to bond with him? It had nothing to do with his childish hero worship and everything to do with fucking Natasha’s profile on Tony as Iron Man. It haunted him, that profile. Nearly kept him off the Avengers, but Fury eventually broke down and called Tony in because Iron Man could do the job no one else could. Hell, he didn’t even need the rest of the Avengers. They were superfluous anyway. Who needs someone with a hammer? A carpenter, that’s who. Oh, and a guy with a bow? That’s useful in a gun (laser and bomb) fight. Let’s not even talk about an unarmed guy with a shield or a chick with killer thighs. Useless. The only one of the team that might be functional was Hulk, and he was a dimwit. It’s like Bruce ate all the brain power and left Hulk with toddler brain syndrome. What a useless pack of nobodies.
When Tony rose from his rest, Steve wasn’t at his side in bed anymore. After a quick shower, Tony queried JARVIS on Steve’s whereabouts.
The solid chains securing him to the ceiling and the floor shifted. Steve looked up but the single bulb blinded him from seeing what the nanotech was doing. The nanite bonds began to move, splaying out his arms and legs.
“Mer Stane is not included in that circle?” he asks.
“Yes, that’s awful kind of you,” Steve replies.
“You’re showing your age, Strange in front of the kid.” Tony digs his phone out of his pocket, presses the home button, and says, “Friday display new implant schematics.”
“Well, he did. But the fact remains that most of the physicians and nurses on call wouldn’t have a lot to do most of the time, so he employs only physician scientists and research nurses. That way they do a ton of research interrupted by actual medical duties when needed,” she said. They walked past multiple laboratories. Steve couldn’t identify half of the equipment in the rooms or on the lab benches. Along the way she pointed out state of the art medical instruments from heart monitors to MRI. “An open MRI – much easier to stand.”
“Not sure I want a hot dog.” Tony waits, his left hand outstretched. This is a test. Whether Ultron’s constructs will back down. If Ultron follows the rules of his own game, then Clint should act as he would in the real world. Ultron knows enough about Clint. He knows what Tony had in those dossiers – whatever that might be.
“Tony -- tried --- tried to re-establish the bond,” Steve says and his head aches and the words are like mud in his mouth. He’s getting weaker now; he’s been lucky that fate or whatever has allowed him to speak and interact. He doesn’t know if he can build up enough strength (or is it courage) to continue.
“You always want to fix things.”
“Like you said it sucks,” Tony says and wants to wrap his arms around his chest. He can’t. He’s beholden to Steve for his safety.
“Everything you need is in the pod.” With that she leads him out of his private room back up to the main level of the brothel to the working pods.
Blu opens his mouth and makes a small mewling sound.
"Yes sir?"
Steve clears his throat and nods. “I know what you mean, Colonel. When I was deployed, I had to learn to trust my team. I had to know that I couldn’t micromanage every situation. If I did get caught in the weeds, someone would get hurt because I was too busy worried about an infinitely small detail instead of the bigger picture.”
“Does it matter?”
“Tell Bucky, it’s okay. It’s not like I’m carrying a torch for Tony. I was just drunk.”
“What are you doing?” Steve says.
This time Steve smiles in front of Tony. He can’t help it. Tony purposeful use of references Steve gets touches him. He forces himself to concentrate. “So, no flying with a passenger.”
Someone is rushing around outside of the cradle. In the distance he hears the buzzers and beeps of monitors. Something warm flows into his veins and he settles again until the memories capture him and he’s at their mercy.
Steve closes his eyes and says, “He needs to work out a lot of aggression. He’s got some issues. He pays a lot. I need it for the doctors.”
“That child is going to try and make me celibate.”
“Say my name.”
"Would you like to go back downstairs and have that drink, Captain?" Tony asks and he lowers his gaze until it bores into Steve.
A pitched cry shuddered through the bond, but Tony couldn’t discern its origin. Even as he heard the click of the rifle the sky around them flashed with lightning and thunder roared. A blast of red fire hit the Hydra goons and Bucky was momentarily caught off guard. The twins circled one another both taking out the guards and keeping Tony at bay. The leak of the memories assaulted Tony again, and he stumbled back, getting in front of Bucky. The memories of all the deaths, the looks of fear, the intensity of murder. It bled through the bonds as if Barnes gushed from wounds deep and deadly.
There’s that Cap again and the ball drops further in his gut. There was a time when Ultron first attacked and they had to find their way to Clint’s farm as safe refuge, that they almost ended up sharing rooms. Tony had stared at Steve, frozen as Laura announced that they had one guest bedroom, the kids would double up, but that meant someone had to sleep on the couch and the others had to double up. Steve thought for sure that Banner and Natasha would bunk together. That left Thor, Tony, and Steve. Thor was too massive to share a bed, so it only seemed logical that he take the wide sectional in the den while Steve and Tony shared the small full sized bed. That’s not what happened.
Turning, he bumps into Fury standing behind him. “Do you have an explanation?”
He rushes at the omega, tossing the food cart against the wall as his vision flashes with the red of urgency and fugue. He bats the weakened man onto the bed, struggling to get to the gland. Steven attempts to dislodge him, but his debilitated state hinders him. Tony takes the stunner and presses it against Steven’s side, striking him with a jolt. The omega goes rigid under him, his back arching and the veins and tendons in his neck sticking out. As the shock runs its course the red need of urgency flows through Tony. He turns off the current and the omega nearly sags in his arms, but his head is turned away toward the wall banishing any thought of Tony. Yet, that’s when Tony sees it, the pulsing gland. It seeps bonding hormone. It’s red, inflamed with want. Clearly the omega teeters on the edge of bonding – Tony can smell the difference in the pheromones released from it. The gland aches with obvious need. So delicious and aromatic in its fragrance that Tony cannot stop his primal urge.
Natasha reaches out but she’s too far away to touch Sam. “Sam, let’s not.”
“More,” he murmurs. “More.”
Their voices follow him through his sleep – haunting him, hunting him like a swarm of locust from the Bible to levy justice on his head.
He feels like a fraud.
Heat.
They were doomed.
“Tony, you have to tell me if your heart, if you are feeling poorly.”
Even as he suits up, even as JARVIS reviews the limitations of the new armor, Tony parses his feelings trying to categorize why this is so very important. Is it just about a little toy? From his childhood? Is it something more? The captured lion stayed relatively isolated and separated from him. Sure, he spoke to it during his captivity, but there was no unending bond. But he recalls the look of the lion as Yinsen lay dying in Tony’s arms. Maybe he anthropomorphized what he glimpsed, but he swears to this day that the beast ached for the lost, even mourned. Then it turned around and attacked their pursuers. He tells himself he owes that lion. He owes Blu and, for a second, Tony’s not sure which Blu he’s talking about at all.
“Please let me,” he begs. “Please let me finish.”
She half smiled at his attempt at humor. “Don’t be so hard on yourself. Steve, other than your love story with Peggy, were there any others? If not, why not? And don’t blame it on being skinny and small. Just consider what the universe and your astral projection are trying to tell you.”
Natasha.
“Yes, he does.”
Steve wraps Tony in a hug and says, “I’ll get what we need. Hang on.” He’s only gone for a few minutes but standing by the bike, in the middle of nowhere, and in the dark both literally and physically freaks him out. He listens to the clunking of the gas pump, the whiz of cars going by on the road, the buzz of the overhead fluorescent lamps with the occasional ping of bugs hitting it. He stands there, he could be standing anywhere – on the moon. He has no idea where he is or which way the store is. He’s fairly certain which way the road is by the sounds of the infrequent car, but other than that, he’s alone. He shudders in isolation.
“I never wanted you to be hurting. I wrote you a letter,” Steve replies. “And whether or not you think that letter was worthy, or you thought it was shit, it came from the heart.”
“God, that’s complicated. And confusing.” Steve pulls out a nice pair of slacks, a polo shirt and clean boxers. He exits the closet with his clothes for the day and his packed bag. “Strange said I can stay at the clinic with Tony. You won’t need to stay. It’ll be about a week or so. You can have the time off.”
Jesus Christ.
The prince’s expression softens. “I know. I’ll talk to you in the morning.”
“Asshole, there’s a word.”
So he had a Beloved or a soul mate or whatever the hell it was and this soul mate found him repugnant. Let’s not even talk about the fact his soul mate brought into the pack a bunch of villains. How did that work exactly? The whole thing was giving him a headache. He drank the last of his tumbler of Bourbon with a quick cringe.
“Oh,” Bucky replied. “Coulda fooled me.”
Tony snickers. “If you’d known, if you’d known. I wonder what you knew then that caused you to not wait on a man with perfectly good money?”
“No, I’m fine.”
“Let them try,” Steve says and spits out blood.
“Yeah.” Her statement is laced with sadness and he wants to know why but she drifts away and soon he hears the door to the cottage open and close.
What does he know?
He thinks he’s broken and will always be broken, but he thinks she already knows that – after all Natasha seems to know everything. The cold is outside, not inside and he can function again. “Yeah. I will be.”
“Shock,” Tony stutters out. It sounds more like shhhh-Ock.
“Are you sure, sir? I may be able to help.”
“You have Hope.”
Hanging by his wrists, cuffed and beaten, smelling the putrid stench of the men around him, sick, infected, dying. They hung him up, whipped him with a scourge because he tried, he helped one of the sick men the other prisoners wanted to ravage, to rifle through his belongings when he finally succumbed to death. The sharp lash of the whip had been nothing compared to the smell as he hung for hours after the beating, as the blood and sweat smeared down his back through the rivulets of flayed skin.
A decade of darkness. Throughout the years, Tony yearned for moments in the sun. He’d stolen them, much to the chagrin of his coven mistress and his human mate. Every now and again, Tony would peek out during the day, gazing at the light and the world that lived around him from which he was forever excluded. It sapped him of his energy, sent spears of pain through his head, and tapped into something long lost in his stone heart. When he called Steve his sunshine, he wasn’t lying, for being with Steve offered him a glimpse of the outside, the alien world forever forbidden to him. It hurt. To steal those moments, it hurt. His eyes ached afterwards, and he suffered from an almost paralyzing weakness. He only knew not to stay in the sun. It would drain away his energy. He never knew what else might happen.
“Sure, no problem,” Bruce said, though he stayed a good few meters away as if he feared too intimate a touch might set off the other guy.
Strange cleared his throat and considered Wong. Neither of them spoke and Steve wondered if they were communicating through some type of magic – if that’s what they called it these days. Back in the old days, Steve called it being a snake oil salesman.
Steve winks at him and continues to eat like yesterday never happened and like he thinks of Tony as a conspiring friend. “So, what do you think? Sledding? But maybe we should try to get into town and help with the clean-up. I’m sure I can find a shovel here somewhere. In the garage?”
“No,” Tony says. His captor punches him in the gut, robbing him of breath.
“Now, Tones, call the poor man a Commander,” Tiberius says and appears at the same door. He’s wearing only a towel as well. He’s not as well-proportioned as Steve and sports a bit of a paunch. He places a hand on each of Tony’s shoulders as he stands behind him. His obvious gesture of possession sickens Steve and only with determined willpower does he not turn away.
“Well, I can tell you one thing. This is not going to be us cuddling in the single bed to stay warm. That’s for sure. I’m getting us out of here,” Tony said and marched to the door. He flung it open to a gust of wind that blasted both cold air and snow into the tiny cabin. “Shit!” He slammed the door closed. “What the fuck does he expect us to do?”
“What is it with you today?”
“To Steve. He’s yours, he’s always been yours.” Natasha says and she leans against the edge of Steve’s bed, not looking at him. “Why do you think he’s alone? He could have anyone he wants. But he buries himself in his work and lives a solitary life. He calls a compound home. He’s waiting right now, but he’s always been waiting.”
Steve picked up the papers of the file on Bucky again as he sat forward. He tossed them across the table. “And what about that? I’m ready to start putting it together, but Bucky’s part of the pack and what do I tell Stark? Does Tony really need to know that someone in our soul pack killed his parents?”
CHAPTER 3
“Really? That’s funny because I thought you already had-.”
“I didn’t think of the consequences. I have to-.”
Steve kissed Tony’s hair. “I don’t know. It was a defense, maybe? Give you a nightmare and try and get away?”
Pierce raised his arm and placed it against the glass. “Careful, Captain, or there may be questions about your loyalty.”
Steve bites at his lips, inhales, exhales and says, “I can’t play the saxophone.”
“Maybe you should think of taking a little time off,” Bruce says. “I can sit with him.”
Tony smiles his quirky curve of the lips. “Stop it. You’re mocking me now.”
The lion flicks his gaze to Tony.
“I don’t think it, I know it. Coulson has done the calculations. If we don’t save Tony Stark, the world falls, completely and utterly. It’s up to you, Steven. Are you up for the challenge?”
Something amorphous shuddered through Steve. Not a chill or a pain, but a sense of incongruity. Like his dream where the clouds were fire and it didn’t hurt him but ran through his nerves, shaking through him. A personal earthquake meant to change him. For a long second, he only stared at her. She stood there, waiting for him, but her eyes – her eyes weren’t staring at him, but at something beyond him. Some state of life (or death) that only she could see. For the first time, he comprehended her power – she not only stepped through to other dimensions, but she saw them around her constantly. Right now, she watched something happening like ghosts playing games around him.
Tony bites his lips. He doesn’t want to scream – get to the god damned point because I think I might be going a little nuts myself.
Consent must be a huge issue to Bucky. Steve waited, and Bucky kept his face hidden by staring down at the mark on his wrist. “Hey why don’t we sit?” Steve gestured to the bed.
“Is Prince Anthony in his sleeping quarters?”
“I convinced T’Challa to give me some, for a price. He knows why I wanted it,” Tony says and then delicately pats the back of Steve’s neck. “This will work Steve. You’ll see.”
“He’s Captain America!” Tony says and throws up his hands. “He’s supposed to know what to do.”
The guy regards Tony with inquisitive eyes, eyes that see too much. “Let’s just say we all went through a war.”
“You had an Air Force Colonel to help and about a billion dollars in armor support,” Natasha came back. She thumbed it back to Pepper. “Plus from what I heard you had hot Pepper here, too.”
“They played that up in the movies, you know,” Tony had said as he placed a plate of steak, rare, in front of Steve. They were holed up in one of Tony’s safe houses outside of Baltimore. It was one of his smaller houses, but the people he paid to maintain it did a good job. They not only managed the grounds but lived there as well. They were in the main house and Tony took the guess house. A small two story house with all the luxury and none of the focus on the property.
“How come he gets cof-.” Jarvis’ stare stops Tony’s protests. “Fine, where is the good doctor, out foraging for more roots and bark to treat me with?”
“You’re old fashioned, too.” Tony easily walks back to the stool and settles on it. He douses the fruit with a heaping topping of the whip cream and then proceeds to spray it directly into his mouth. He slams the spray can onto the countertop and smirks at Steve. “Want some?”
He smiles with pride. “You would.” He hops from the stool, not finishing his generous portion of fries. Tony barely touched his own. “I think I’d like to work on drawing now. I see you in a bit?”
Tony grunts out something completely unintelligible, but his grip on their cocks tightens and he strokes with a purpose and intent. His eyes never leave Steve’s and he’s hot over Steve like a furnace, like the flames of hell itself and Steve’s doesn’t care. He wants only to feel this, to burn with it and he’s thrusting into Tony’s hand stroke for stroke. Somehow Tony brings his other hand around and cups Steve’s sac and he nearly explodes right then.
The dumping of wood onto the fireplace bricks interrupts him. “You’re thinking too much. I’m not going to try and flank you, Tony.” Steve tugs off his gloves. He doesn’t have his boots on but he’s wearing his coat and gloves. Tony wonders if he went outside without shoes of any kind. “I have to answer emails, do some small administration stuff.”
“The place where all the fucking happens.”
“That’s good. Great.” Tony’s stuck on
“Okay, but I’ll get things ready to go.”
Thor slaps him on the back and Steve coughs because of it. “Great! My friend, great.”
“Where would you like to go?” Steve asks as he stands in the doorway of the kitchen.
Thor glances over Tony’s shoulder to where Steven is standing. A look of recognition crosses Thor’s face and he smiles. “It cannot be. Steven of the Carbonelli clan? We were great friends of the day. I missed you these many years. I had understood that you perished along with all of the Carbonelli family.”
“Don’t tell me you didn’t find that a tad bit strange,” Steve asks.
He doesn't have a minute to spare as the door bursts open and a contingent of six men fall into the room. Luck is with him though because half of them are officers in dress uniforms and without a side arm. He shoots them without remorse. The other three are a different story. One gets a shot off that explodes on his metal shoulder causing a jolt of electricity to crackle up and now the gears. The motors whine in protest but he barrels at the guy toppling him over and then kicking out with both legs as he flies to the floor. He trips one of the remaining troopers and kicks the other in the face. He goes down but the other jumps to the defense of the one Bucky wrestles.
“How they treating you, kid?” Logan asks as he dumps two large paper bags on the service tray table. One of the bags has a stain of grease on it.
Steven studies the bottle. He cocks at eyebrow at Tony. “Don’t assume?”
The clock stops.
Later when he crawled into bed, Tony didn’t pitch his soul outward to touch Steve. He left him alone for now. Tony needed to find his way and to recognize what he wanted from Steve before he bothered him again. His strategy would have worked, if he hadn’t woken up only hours later with a gut-wrenching agony of loss in his belly and the pain eating away his own grip on the world and sanity. He sat straight up in bed, wide awake. With his hand on his chest, he asked, “JARVIS, what’s going on?”
Steve nods. “Yes, Tony. Yes, oh God, yes.” He’s about to nuzzle into the crown of Tony’s head again but the distinct stench of burning milk fills the air. “Oh shit!” Steve rushes to the stovetop to turn off the pot. He sniffles. “It’s ruined.”
“Bucky, you need-.”
Tony comes to his side, helps him get back to a comfortable position on the bed and tugs up some sheets. “Stay here for a minute, I want to catch her.”
“Higher brain function? Tony asked. “What about it? Any change there?”
He shouldn’t care. Any time in the past when he cared he always ended up burned – either by himself or someone he thought he loved He didn’t even really know Steve as well as he knew someone like Pepper. He’d been in a relationship on and off with Pepper for years, and yet maybe he never really knew her. They weren’t cut from the same cloth. Pepper liked organized and safe activities. She hated Iron Man, not Tony, but she hated the idea of it. It scared her. Steve – well, Steve had to be the ultimate reckless hero. He consented to an unproven treatment to change him into a super soldier. He rushed in when others raced to safety. In some ways, Steve and Tony
“Yeah, I know.” He bites at his cuticle.
“JARVIS updated me,” Tony said. “Some of it is still encrypted though. It will take ages to go through it all.”
“Sheriff, this is my assistant, Miss Virginia Potts,” Stark says. “She’s a lifesaver.”
“No, no!” Steve said but didn’t have a chance to hit the comm to relay his message. He had to hope the soul bonds clearly showed his intentions, and that Clint relayed his intention to Hill. “I can handle this.”
“Stay.” Tony uses his most authoritative tone. “I want a Personal Assistant that is more than a simple gal Friday. Do you know what that is?”
“Burgers?” Steve asked and fumbled his way to one of the white couches even though he looked supremely uncomfortable with his straight back and his rigid posture.
“No, I won’t,” Steve said. “I’ll still be me. The same guy kicking himself for wasting so much time with you. The same guy wondering about everything that goes on in that head of yours. The same guy madly in love and kind of embarrassed about how much of my brain power is consumed thinking about you.”
Ushering them toward the corridor, Rumlow answered, “Yeah I guess that’s what you call it.”
“Just because I stitch up wounds from bar brawls does not make me a doctor, Cap.” She waits for Bucky.
Steve smiles. “You were all very persistent. And thank you for that.”
Steve squinted at her and Tony chuckled. “Don’t worry, Steve. It just means we’re not evil undead in the end anyhow.” Tony considered Shuri. “It’s interesting that you accept that I left my body and then came back to it.”
“Sure thing.” Steve finishes up the subs and puts a bowl of fresh blueberries for snacking next to Tony’s right hand. “Here you go. Just as you ordered, sir.” He sits next to Tony and takes a huge bit out of his sandwich. As he chews he realizes he forgot to get anything to drink. Swallowing quickly – enough that it hurts – he says, “Can I get you some water?”
Tony pushes past current affairs which Steve’s quietly grateful. Dwelling on Bucky’s status gets him nowhere. “So, the park? I know they have a waterfall-.”
“Not far. Not with this armor. It’s not complete and doesn’t have all the instructions it needs. I haven’t finished the coding. The basics-.” He stops as a gust steals his breath. Once it dies down, he continues, “The nanotechnology I based this on, I was able to do all the math so I could conjure it. I don’t have all the abilities interfaced or calculated. Nanotech is a horse of a different color than routine fabrication.”
Steve goes through a long description of the seizures he’s been having. He explains how the seizures aren’t convulsions at all, but episodes where he lives an entirely different life. He details how the seizures first started and how each and every one became more in depth like he first saw a trailer to a movie, then saw a sneak peek, then saw the movie, and then finally read the book. Each seizure offered more information, turning visions into a new reality.
“You’ll wake me up first,” Tony instructs and grimaces at Steve. “It might just be a nightmare or something.”
“Considering they own the vast majority of water rights in the Inner Belts and run the lanes to the outer rims, I would say probably not.”
Tony shrugs. “Yeah. Yeah, but you’ve been out of it, so the rules of the world come into play. I would think. Or maybe you have a tilted perception that you heal faster than you really do. I wouldn’t be surprised. You do have a tendency to come out of battles beat up and limping and telling everyone that you’re fine when you obviously are anything but.”
“You shifted how you were sitting on the bed,” Tony says. “When I can see again, will you share it with me, Steve?”
“It’s more complicated than that. The soul mark, the whole thing, it opened my eyes to what I was denying-.” Steve said and suddenly he was standing, clothed in his Captain America uniform except his helmet was gone, his shield not there, and they were in the Helicarrier all over again. His face swelled with the beating he’d taken, and he felt the ache of the bullet wounds to his belly. “Bucky, please.”
“My personal take on any idea of a Captain America would be the best of what America stands for and that’s written in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. And I’ll leave it at that.” He starts to stand up.
When Clint approached him, Steve wanted to condemn him. Yet, the wrecked look in his eyes, the way his mouth turned down, and the sallowness of his face wiped away Steve’s conviction. With a soft voice, Clint whispered to Steve, “I’m sorry.”
He shivers and then he feels a thick jacket over his shoulders only to see Steven slipping his own coat over Tony. Since the day Tony punished Steven, things changed. Tony still felt the sting of shame for having punished Steven so severely due to a minor transgression. There were levels of punishment and Tony knew he went too far. He’d wanted to apologize but that night – well, Steven ended up on the rack again, whimpering for relief. Tony gave it to him, allowed him to come and when he spilled over Tony’s hand he collapsed in his bindings with his eyes closed and his body limp.
There’s no words he can say to convince Tony otherwise. He climbs up and holds Tony in his arms and whispers in his ears, “I believe in you, Tony. I’m here for you. Let’s promise to believe one another.”
“No, no I’m not,” Steve says and the thought of escaping, wrestling free of his desk and duties suddenly becomes a very real option. Why would he shove it aside without considering it? “Okay, I’ll think about it. Just think about it.”
“See, I told you we would take care of him,” Rumlow snickered. “Ross has big plans for your boy.” He tightened the cuffs. “Don’t worry, he has big plans for you too.” He jerked Steve to his feet. “Oh yeah. He did ask me to do this, just to make sure you got the message.” He forced Steve to turn around, and then pushed him up against the car. Without pause, he punched Steve in the jaw, snapping his head around. Steve choked on the blood in his mouth but then spat it out. Not a surprise at all. So he gathered all of his strength against the growing weakness in his body and stood up to glare at Rumlow.
“Yes, what will the Captain say,” Pepper says and he’s not certain she isn’t mocking him.
“I got a better idea,” Tony says. He needs his tablet for it, but as he climbs the stairs, he realizes he left it in Steve’s room. “I just need to wash up a bit. I’ll be right down.” He skips up the stairs. He does go to his own room first to clean up a bit, and then heads back down the hall to Steve’s room.
"Yes, tell me where will we venture out to when you take me on these rides? The mountains? The rivers, the long plateaus?"
“I don’t,” Steve starts but he falters and closes his eyes. “I’m sorry, Tony. This isn’t the way it’s supposed to be. We have to get you out of here, now.”
“Of course, I am. He’s requested my services for the rest of the week. He desperate to learn more about humanity. His creator was human, did you know that?” Wanda says.
Steve bows his head and blinks rapidly trying to clean away the pain, the sorrow, the agonizing frustration. “And me?” He doesn’t look up at Tony.
As the Silver Knight, he had no fear of his duty. He’s made a vow to protect the souls of the Realm with his life.
“Shit, Steve. You’re not deranged. To love someone is never to be deranged.”
Strange licked his lips and then cleared his throat. “Mister Wilson isn’t wrong. You’ve done something similar before, Doctor Banner. You just need to do it on a wider, more intricate scale.”
Suddenly self-conscious, Steve touches the tunic and wonders if he should go back to the bathroom and retrieve the robe.
“Tell me what you think? Tell me how I should picture you?” Tony asks and then lets his hands drift down to Steve’s shoulders, to his biceps.
Steve wiped his hands and leaned against the counter, fully facing Tony. “I might have. Still could. It’s hard. It’s not -.” Steve screwed up his features and then flared his nostrils and he breathed out again. “I was going to say not natural, but that’s the wrong word. It’s just not easy to drop decades of understanding for a new one.”
As Steve climbs the ladder, he scans the bay inside the Avengers. It speaks to the size of the starship. The ship bay docks dozens of fighters and at least three shuttles that Steve can count. It’s massive in scope. He’s awed and a little cowed by it.
“What we know is that he’s inventing our future leaving little time for anything else. Even his Personal Assistant, former Army Captain Steven Rogers confesses that his feelings go unrequited.” The camera pans out to show she’s standing across the street from Stark Tower. “So much of our future depends on Stark Industries, can we afford not to know more about Tony Stark?”
“There are trees in the Penthouse?” Pepper asks and he can no longer hear her clack of heels. That means she’s confused or angry. He hisses. “What does that mean? Are the trees talking to you? Should I call Reed Richards? Or do you need a doctor?”
“Oh, that reassures me,” Steve murmurs but does collapse into the chair. He shouldn’t, he needs to go and check on Bucky – he’s been at Stark’s residence all day. He loathes to leave, because he knows once he steps out of the threshold, he’ll have to face what he’s done and himself.
Tony digs into his fruit, ignoring the egg sandwich. “Jarvis wants me to come out to the world. No, thank you. I already saw what happened when I came out as gay to the world. My stocks dropped and a bunch of companies stopped buying my merchandise. Which – yeah go fuck yourself – but that was a hard hit to take.”
It takes a moment and Steve sees the flush of anger flare over Tony’s face, but he holds back the reaction and says, “Make me. Make me understand this thing. Make me understand why I shouldn’t want your friend gone or dead or in prison. Make me understand why you protect him like you’re his omega. Are you? Are you his?”
Hovering over him, Tony stands in the washroom and his eyes darken. “I hope you aren’t taking to heart what Obie said.”
Steve placed his hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Don’t do that. Don’t tear it down. It’s wonderful and it’s helping me understand even more how this whole soul pack works.”
It was a sacred oath . Though, most considered Steven an outlaw for his part in the Uprising, a growing number of more enlightened alphas thought of the Carbonelli story as a warning. Carbonelli saw the uprising as a signal for reform. They tried to find a way to reconciliation but ended up caught up in a revolt. Steven’s role is nebulous and few understood it. Most thought of Steven as part of the reason the Carbonellis died. To have him invoke the sacred oath of any omega warrior demonstrated fealty.
“Just let us review your best options?” Pep says and she gestures to the man to hurry things along.
The dog failed at that, and Tony doesn’t like to think about what happened to old Rusty. Now, as he stares at the ghost lion, he thinks of Rusty. How he would lie with his head between his paws and stare up at Tony with this mournful look in his eyes. There had been a silent conversation between the two of them. Both of them knew their bonding would never last, but both of them hoped they would be able to fight the forces that would tear them apart. Tony wasn’t strong enough then.
“Oh, there must be something to tell. You look like that old war hero my dad used to go on about. Captain America. And come to think of it, wasn’t his name something like Rogers or Bucky or something.”
Tony snickers because he can’t stop himself. The man is positively a challenge and a smart ass to boot. “Let’s say it’s a good thing.” Tony proceeds across the grand vestibule and up the main staircase to the upper rooms. Steven follows him. “Let’s say we can talk a little more. You know, break free from the formalities of protocols.”
Steve startles and finds an older gentleman, dressed impeccably and formally, standing next to him. “Excuse me?”
“Always. But mainly about how he sold weapons to just about everyone. He had no moral compass. He didn’t care. He just wanted the credits. All he cared about was the wealth. He built up this empire and now Obie wants me to claim it.”
“I can’t stop him.”
“Tony,” Pepper said, and it jogged him out of his reverie. “There’s data – over thirty years of data on 18704.”
“Sure,” Sam said. “He must really like you.”
“Here? Now?” Tony spun around in the little bathroom even though he hit his elbows on the door frame and nearly fell into the toilet.
“You didn’t let him? Did he force you?”
“Kiminsky?” The light dawns. Tony shakes his head. “No, no. Kiminsky was not talking about entanglement. He was talking about -.”
“That’s unlikely, right? He has the ring on his wrist that designates him as a leader. He will eventually find a pack,” Bruce said.
“So if it’s always been around, why haven’t we heard about it before?” Natasha asked. She eyed Hawkeye as she spoke as if he might hold some unspoken truths to be shared. He stayed back, away from the crowd and hunched in on himself.
“We could call in help for an opposing team,” Natasha added. “I could call in Hill, maybe Sharon. I don’t think war games will work with the soul pack. We can really shut off communication through the pack or direct it as precisely as we need to except for in special cases.” She pointedly stared at Steve and Tony as they clasped hands.
Steve’s always been ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, but he hates the thought of his team saddled with the guilt of that decision.
Obviously, the biometric scans are useless after a few days’ separation of the vampire. That was useful information. Steve filed it away for another day and then watched as Clint expertly piloted the helicopter through the rain clouds. Lightning sliced the sky, but Clint showed no fear as he dove the copter into the chop of the storm. It bumped and rolled but Clint kept it under control.
"Falcon, I’m clear. Coming through?"
“I’ll send you the code. Good luck. I have to go.”
“I’m sorry, sir, but Master Jamison has finished the task,” Jarwin says.
“Nope. I bet I’m not. Maybe it’s your commitment to 40s music. Like you never listen to anything else.”
Tony felt it; the doors closing, the windows shuttering within Steve. “No, you don’t do that. Peggy said you weren’t alone and you’re not. You stay with us, you understand? We can’t lose you, too.” Tony realized as he spoke his own tears broke free. He glanced at Natasha and tears also stained her face. “She was strong for us. You have to stay with us. Steve, please.”
Steve smiled. “I don’t know if I can. Tony, you don’t want me like that.”
“Is dead and I am in charge. I am the Prince. Not you.”
“Family,” he uttered and the bond snapped into place. She nearly lost hold of him as she stumbled, but it wouldn’t have mattered anyhow. Metal arms encompassed him, tearing him away from the red flames, and then an army of iron men walled him off from her. With barely enough energy to keep his eyes open, Steve murmured, “Clint.”
The shock on Tony’s face cut through Steve hard, faster than any knife or weapon. Steve wanted to cross the distance, he wanted to take Tony into his arms, but the courage, the bravery he had always been heralded for – that reservoir he could always count on – just wasn’t there. He curled up and hugged his arms around himself as he watched Tony deflate with his words.
The man smiles. “Can we get one cookie?” The little girl frowns at the number. “Two cookies and milk? Do you have milk?”
“What?”
Steve smirked. "Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?"
Raising an eyebrow, Obie replies, "Just don't let that great piece of ass distract you too much. You need to be out in Malibu next week for the Directors’ meeting.  They want to see you, the wonder boy, not me."
“Yeah. I asked them not to do that. I’ll talk to them again.” Tony yawns. “I’m going to try and sleep.” He lays the book aside and closes his eyes. “No worries about the lights. I’m okay.”
“Red like a demons?” Steve gulps back the pain in his voice. There are no demons, just lies.
“Behind it you’ll find the common kitchen and an observation deck. We have a killer view of the nebula and some of the port.” He keeps walking and then they end up at an elevator. “This lift takes you to your room. That’s your private room, not for clients. No clients allowed. Once you check in with the Widow, I can show you to your room and the working pods.”
“We got this one Cap. There’s a safe house-.”
That’s when JARVIS decided to chime in. “Now you know why I had Doctor Banner wake you, sir.”
Sam studied him for a moment but then nodded.  “You know we were all worried about you. You cut us off. You tried to go it alone. You promised us to use all the lines and then you didn’t. I’m new to this stuff but I know how a team works,” Sam said.
“Hmm?” Steve says almost in a dreamy whisper.
“It’s okay,” Tony quietly urged. “Watch.” He reached over with his other hand, and turned Steve’s head back to facing him. The command was more of a request, but Steve still followed it. He arched his back as he watched Tony stroke up and down. His breathes quaked. “Help me.”
“I’m so sorry, Steve,” Tony whispered and gently, almost tentatively held Steve to his chest. “I’m so sorry.”
The room buzzes with noises from the multiple monitors set around Steve’s bed like a wall built to protect him. Most of the monitors are squealing with different warnings. The heart monitor reads accelerated rates with increased indications of dire consequences, the pulmonary monitor cautions of lower oxygen intake while the in time biochemistry monitor sampling Steve’s blood shows a flight or fight response in action.
“Yeah, me and JARVIS, right my man?”
"You have to understand, Captain, the Southern sympathizers weren't only in the South," Tony says. "I only regret I wasn't able to provide the information to stop Lincoln's assassination."
Years ago there had been an attack on an embassy in Bogota. The political ramifications echoed through the administration as the tensions over the kidnapping of high level government officials grew. How it ended had always been a question. The administration at the time thanked Canada for its assistance in rescuing and delivering the hostages to safety. The government of Bogota cried foul, saying there had been an attack on their soil and even petitioned the UN to investigate. It was quietly swept under the carpet but not before a name floated to the top of the news. A Nicolas Fury sanctioned an attack on foreign soil. The whole thing could have exploded but the Nick Fury they were looking for had died in a mysterious plane crash weeks before the hostage situation ever took place. It should have knocked Tony onto a different investigative path. Yet it niggled at him like a brain worm, like he kept hearing
He listens to directions because he’s at a loss of what else to do. He slams open the doors and finds the bathroom on the second try. It’s small but not cramped and tiny like Steve’s. Going to the medicine cabinet, he searches to find row upon row of medicine bottles. “What’s it called?” He’s not a pharmacist and he doesn’t have his phone out to query JARVIS right now.
He glances over at the lion who is still awake, still watching him. “Help the helpless. You know, you don’t look too helpless, but you are. You let them hurt you and beat you, for what?” Tony closes his eyes and thinks of the abuse he accepted from his father for unfathomable reasons. “I know how it is.” He doesn’t open his eyes as he speaks. “I know how it is to just accept things, accept that you’re worthless and that you have to work to get their approval. I get it, Blu. I understand.”
Tony waits for Steve’s footsteps to dissipate, fade away before he collapses back on the couch into the cushions. Laying his head back, Tony remembers what Steve looks like, but his memories integrate the sensory experience from touch. Once he thought of Steve as a Greek god, but now – now something else. Something different happened. His fingertips feel electrified with the memory of the rough skin of his jaw, the perfect curve of his cheekbones, the brush of his long lashes. Under his touch, Steve is beauty personified.
“Take solace in your coven, Anthony. It will be the one thing that will be with you for all of your days,” Thor said and grasped his shoulder before departing and leaving Tony to his thoughts. One of the things Thor had not said was that Steve would be with him for all of his days. Steve wasn’t aging, at least not at a normal human rate. Tony assumed that meant he was as immortal as a vampire, but he never considered the fact that Steve was infinitely more fragile in many more ways.
“God, you read my mind.”  The man picks up the cup and blows on it. He sips it and a small bit of foam stains his lips. “Delightful.” He peers at him. “Steve?”
“No, no,” Steve said and then he recalled the ghost of Peggy speaking to him, or maybe it was just a half-remembered feeling of her. “Yes, like that.”
Bucky.
His hands are treasures as they stroke and massage the length of Steve’s wings. Tony hums a little as he caress the breadth of Steve’s wingspan. “You can’t even tell they were burnt, now.”
He jumps and from behind him he hears a groan. Steve smacks the same control icon again.
“Let’s take a walk,” Steve had said. He needed the time to summon his courage. When he thinks back on it, it embarrasses him. A super soldier, Captain America, feared the worst.
Bruce stopped sweeping as JARVIS began.
“Lessons have been offered. Wong has done his best to teach the pack but the whole lot of you tend to be loose cannons. What other pack would be so dispersed for so long!” Strange’s cloak bristled at his words.
Natasha knocked him with an elbow, winked, and as she ran to catch the lift with Bruce said, “Steve’s coming around.”
“So, you want me to call you SR001?” His exasperation mounts.
“But it’s not,” Steve says and hungers for more. He decides he should catch some sleep before dealing with Bucky’s disappointment regarding the Rails. He ignores the insistent icon on his pad, he’ll deal with Bucky tomorrow. He needs to sleep; he strips down and finds his way to his bedroom. He never decorated it; there had been a time he would draw for hours in the cockpit of the Howling Commando.
Tony’s not sure what to believe but he shrugs on his jacket and heads out the hospital room door. “Where is he now?”
“You’re not going anywhere.” Sam presses a hand on his chest. “You need to get back in bed. Cho-.”
“Vegetable and beef stew. Or so I think it might be beef. I don’t know.” He looks at the green brown meat. “It’s seen better days.”
She yanks up the voluminous sleeve to reveal a small tube of blue liquid. “Come on, Rogers, wake up.”
“Yes.”
“Now,” Tony says and walks around him. “The dildo in your ass will fuck you as you blow me. Are you ready?”
“Excuse me, sir.”
“Blacksmith, first, Shield needs new shoes,” he mumbles.
Tony puts up his hand. “Don’t be impressed until you see it.” He opens his hand, seeking. “Are you game?”
Nodding, the demon says, “This realm isn’t real Steve. We’ve been trapped here for a long time, so have you. We can’t get out – not like you would think, but we can make it better.”
Barely able to focus, he orders, “Thrust and swell level 4.”
Tony gazes down at Steve as he slips onto his lap. “That’s the point, Steve. You don’t have to take it seriously all the time. Relationships, love, let’s you be silly, let’s you ask ridiculous questions, let’s you be you.”
The rational part of his brain attempted to alleviate the shame and the revulsion, but his body responded to the injection from her feeding gland. It shouldn’t be this way. It could only mean she had been feeding for a long time. A quiet sip, a long drink wouldn’t elicit this kind of reaction from a human’s body. She’d drank and then purposefully injected the arousal agent.
“You’re wound is infected. You might have said something earlier.”
Bruce shakes his head. “I don’t know.” Tony agrees. He has no idea.
Tony nods, accepting Steve’s word without further explanation. Steve appreciates it and he gestures for Tony to join him. They walk toward the Inn; in the time Steve rested, the town’s come to life. Several of the citizens tip their hats to Steve and he stops multiple times to discuss any concerns or worries. He spends some time at the General Store going over a probable burglary with the proprietor, Phil Coulson.
“Oh, I don’t think that, at all Sheriff,” Stark says with a smile far removed from innocent. “You came here for something else.”
“Steven, these are magnificent drawings. Has your boss seen them?” Thor asks as he pages through the sketches.
“Bohemian? Seriously, what are they teaching you out there in the sticks?” Tony brushes a hand down Steve’s square shoulders.
Beloved.”
“Captain Rogers, if you command the armor to open using your compound access code it will open.”
“I’m used to it. I know what I’m doing,” Steve lies.
“I didn’t exactly agree, I didn’t volunteer.”
Before he could recapture the words, before he could explain them, Steve gazed at Tony and his whole image in the dreamscape flickered then pixelated until it vanished into the red ocean around them. Steve dissipated – his soul gone.
The din of the crowd dissipates as Steve only focuses on Strange and Wong. They stand there like a pair of crows considering whether to pick his bones bare. Nothing intimidates him when he demands answers. The doctor who cared for his mother tried to dissuade him from the truth. It never works out. Not for Steve Rogers.
In seconds he enters Tony’s open doorway to find Wanda, Vision, and Pietro waiting in the lounge area of the master suite. Both Vision and Wanda avoid looking at him. He’s thankful for that, lord only knows Steve thinks the flush to his cheeks will spread to the tips of his ears especially since – like a teenager – he just showered to jerk off because of what he saw. He curses inwardly but frames his expression to be neutral. Mercifully, Tony’s not in the lounge area at all.
“Yes, Duchess.”
He settled in and examined the lead. It brought him here to 1437 Elmhurst Drive. A Clara Fury resides at the house next to a Jacob Beach. Tony walks up the flowered lined sidewalk to the small rowhouse in Baltimore. He knocks on the door clutching the paper work in his hand. The door opens and an older woman with kind eyes but a sharp gleam in them looks him over.
He leaves Tony under the tree of life and walks back to the cottage. The scenery changes around him, transforms into a garden path that’s overground and thick with wildflowers. It reminds him of those stories of Sleeping Beauty. Before he gets to the cottage though, a hand grasps his shoulder and turns him around – it’s Tony, of course.
“Whatever you say.” Steve squirms down farther into the pile of blankets. “Cold. Go away.”
“Many things are possible, Tony, humans just ignore the best ones,” Steve says and the burning sensation he felt fades.
Tony winks at him and follows what he’s told. His cock bounces as it’s released from the constricting pants. Fine dribble of semen smears the head. Steve licks his lips but he knows he has to use a condom. Taking one out, he waits until Tony settles on the bench. Steve kneels. It’s a tight space but Steve’s small, he can handle it easily. He unrolls the condom onto Tony’s erection, gliding his hands along the bare shaft before he opens his mouth and accepts the cock. It sits on his tongue, warm and heavy.
It was then he recognized him – Bucky Barnes – weeping for Tony’s loss. Stunned, Tony sat up with his hand to his chest. For long minutes, he was glad that Barnes hadn’t been in the room when Tony found out the truth. He shivered. For the rest of the day, the horror and sorrow streaming through the bond from a distant Brother plagued him, a phantom lingering in the distance waiting to ruin him.
“He is. Didn’t you see him today? He was brilliant the way he guided that meeting-.”
Steve inhales once as he goes to the gates to be allowed entrance.
Steve jumps, startled, and places his hand on his chest. The prince appears from the corner of the workshop carrying a heavy structural piece that looks like an arm. He dumps it on the table and leans against the bench, crossing his arms.
“Is he okay?” Clint asks. He looks like someone socked him in the mouth. He’s got a bag of frozen peas against his face.
“I get it, I get it,” Tony says with his hands held up. “I’m doing it. I swear.”
He wants to say he survived a simple excision of his gland before. This isn’t a big deal. Why does it feel like one? Yet, he cannot remember feeling this weak. His hands are too heavy to move but he likes the feel of Tony holding him. All he can say is simple and complete. “Tony.”
Steve closes his eyes and Tony is there, edged and uncomfortable with Steve’s hands on him, shifting away, but allowing Steve to touch him. “He tried to remember, he did.”
“Will it? Will it turn to civil war or will it finally unite the human hegemony.”
“This all sounds fun and all, but I would feel more comfortable if the Howling Commando had her Captain back.” She accept a drink from the man tending bar and strolls over to the check in kiosks. She dumps her plate, utensils, napkin, and drink into his arms and turns back to the console to start registration. “Do you know what group we’ll be escorting to the Lemurian Star?”
Eyes – deep and powerful. Looking. Searching. Words. Not understood. Words filled with anguish. What are they? Who are they?
As he speaks the fog begins to lift and he points at the far away cliff. “That is where you want to go, dear Captain. I’m not stupid. I know what your ultimate goal is.” Loki circles around Steve and as he does the ground around them, the concrete shifts and changes like bricks from a child’s building set. Walls and tunnels are built. The grinding of rock and stone against one another dins the sounds of anything else. Once it is done only dust and grit fill the air. Steve coughs. He closes his eyes for a few seconds trying to settle the pixelated aspect of the world around him.
“P.E.?” Steve asked.
It had been coming. They both knew it would eventually. Living a dual life threatened them at all times. Steve refused to keep his mouth shut about the V-Corps and vampires’ rights, while Tony scurried about and followed the rules of living as a vampire after the Treaty.
“Stark?”
Not cowed, because hell, Steve Rogers is never cowed by anyone – regardless of size or position.  He jumps to his feet. “What I was doing was my job. My job as his escort and
“Steve, please. I need. I need.”
“Good boy. He’ll love you in that,” Natasha says. “Listen, I have to go. Keep me updated and Steve keep your feet on the ground, okay?”
“I think I can,” Steve says but he’s not looking forward to facing the room again.
“They’re going to transport you in a few hours,” Tony says. “I got here just in time. I’m going to come with you. This isn’t sanctioned, of course. But I’m not letting you out of my sight. Not again.”
“Like particles entangled. That means-.” Tony starts but Natasha finishes, “You’ll be able to find him in the Keep.”
When Steve gets to his feet, and holds onto the chair in the room to stand, Tony nods with satisfaction. “Listen, I can pay another local for their silence to help you out, now. You don’t really need me. The ocean, the water seems to be miraculous as far as curing you.”
Tony shook his head and then bowed it. “Nothing, I keep trying. But nothing.”
“I’m not, but I think we all saw your reaction of him. Right now, like I said, we’re in the situation where he’s the kind of guy you stop,” Sam said. “Are you ready for that?”
“Sir, Mer Stane is reaching out to coordinate efforts for the meetings tomorrow.”
Desires.
Until one day a doctor in a suit and not a white coat comes by his room as he's about to watch a glut of news programming. He can sit for hours watching and seeing the same nightmares over and again without any resolution. The people in the world around him only talk, they never find a solution. When the man enters his room with a light knock to the door, he doesn't turn his face away from the news reports of an explosion at a government facility in the Southwest.
THE END
“On duty then? Not dressed for it.” He walked around the bar and headed toward the conversation pit. Raising his glass he said, “The joys of being retired.”
“There are other ways.” Natasha takes a step toward him and, for a moment, he wants to flee. It isn’t as if he hasn’t considered calling Natasha in to act as his alpha, to satisfy the needs of his sub-omega nature.
“No. They wouldn’t understand, either.” He scoffs. “Who would?” He stands up and flings his hands outward. “You know what, JARVIS, you want to know what’s up? Okay! I’ll tell you. I’m sick in the head. I’m in love with a fucking delusion.”
Clint rages behind him. Tony pivots and shoots again over Steve’s head and dead center in Clint’s chest. The doppelganger topples but doesn’t stop his ascent. Tony skids his way down the hill, hooking his hand into the collar of Steve’s uniform.
He recalled how Thor told him that Loki would spend his centuries in stasis. When Tony asked what it had meant, Thor only flinched and mournfully said, “As a wraith. Do everything you can not to be condemned to the life as a wraith. Once there, you may never return.”
“It’s marvelous. The upgrade. Dear God, Steve.” He stops and looks directly at Steve. It might be his imagination, but it damn well appears as if Tony’s eyes do see him. “God damn it, Steve, I – it’s amazing. Before the resolution sucked, the processors had to digitally recreate missing pixels and it gave a grainy and often cartoony feel to what I saw. Now,” he gasps. “Now, it’s so different.”
“Kids? Really?” Steve said, and his heart ratcheted up. “I don’t understand. What?”
“We have to step through at the same time.” Tony puts his hand out and captures Steve’s. “Let’s go.”
“Actually, that would be nice. I’d like some company, especially now.” The conversation he’d just finished with Sam rang in Steve’s head, and he smiled. The thought that maybe he was discovering something about himself, something new about himself in this new age, seemed appropriate in some odd way. “Do you want to go out to get something to eat?” That sounded suspiciously like he was asking Tony out on a date, so he rushed ahead and said, “Because I need to clean up first.”
“He’s not ready and you shouldn’t push it.” A voice from the other side of the cottage interrupts them. A woman with deep auburn red hair and full lips steps into the light. “It’s going to take a while Tony. How long did it take you to wake up?”
“Fury’s not a fool.”
“Look at you, just put your thumbs in your belt and you would be the perfect model of Captain America again,” Tony says. “I thought you grew old and forgot about that kind of thing.”
“Christine. Always a pleasure.” He smiles that disarming smile; the press is always fooled by it. Steve never is; its plastic, pasted on. “It’s not about accepting being blind or not. It’s about accepting who I am. And do you know who I am, dear Christine? Right here, before you, I’m standing here the man who gave the world the arc reactor for clean energy. We launch our new smart street technology next week. And talking about launching, with the arc reactor we’re working with NASA to leapfrog the new space program milestones ahead of where it is now. On top of that, the Pym and Stark collaboration will change the face of medicine as we know it. So, Christine, it is about who I am. I am Tony Stark.” He raises his hand and the crowd around her cheers.
“Read it.” His heart pounds heavy in his ears. Tony can’t expect anything. Not now, but he can’t get his heart to understand the facts.
“Maybe it’s the headache or the hangover from your night on the town,” Tony remarks as Jarvis begins to serve.
T’Challa interrupted his sister. “Shuri!”
“Steve: I left your bag with the glasses and computer with all of the data with Pepper and Rhodes. If it wouldn’t be too much trouble, could you please have my stuff sent to my address in Brooklyn?”
Steve strokes his hands down Tony’s side, holding him right at the small of his waist where he’s most sensitive. Hiking up his t-shirt, Steve leans down and kisses a small line down, following Tony’s Adonis’ belt. Tony squirms a bit and then Steve’s peeling away his jeans and suckling at his skin below his navel, teasing his erection.
Tony seizes the cash and throws it to the floor. “I want to talk, I want to know you, I don’t want to fuck. I want to-.”
Bruce searches for something, but then Pepper has his bag and shoves it in his hands. Pepper and Bruce follow him out with a call from Jarvis to take care of Tony. It’s a strange household to be sure.
Rhodey paused before he answered. “Yeah. I can swing it. I’m here as a trainer, anyhow. Let me get out of my next class of the conference.”
“No, we have a plan. We’re going to stick with it.” Tony’s voice shatters. His hands in the massive metal gauntlets feel numb, his breath cold even in the heated armor. “We have a plan.”
“I have no problem traveling. I’m not married and don’t have any kids. So, I’m free. Exactly what does the position entail?” He perks up a little, sitting forward in the chair.
“God, I know,” Tony said as he slid his hand up to cup Steve’s cheek. Blood tears glistened in those strangely alien eyes. “I know. I just want to be with you. I want to hold you. I want those bastards to never have touched you.”
“Yes,” Steve says. “If anyone knows what Tony’s up to it will be Pepper.”
She leaves without a word. Tony pulls off his glasses and tosses them on the table as he faces Steven. “You have nothing to fear with me.”
“A gala?” Rhodey says.
She relieves him of the six pack. “I haven’t seen you before?”
Steve’s right by his side suddenly, holding his hand over the one Tony inadvertently put on his own chest. “I’m grateful every day that you had the arc reactor, that it saved you, that you were eventually able to take it out. The scars show me that you are still here with me. Tony, they’re beautiful. You’re beautiful.”
“And now,” Bruce said and sighed. “Now, I’m back. He’s back. And I have to deal with it.”
He tries and tries. The water pelts him and he mourns the days he walked around blind to the truths in the world, when he couldn’t see while he partied and played. Everything was easier then when he didn’t
“More cataclysmic than a Collapsing Event?” Tony asks and he walks over to the open doors to the patio. Steve exhales.
It’s small only a couple of meters wide and the same in length. The stench burns his nostrils and makes his eyes tear. Huddled in the corner, he glimpses a figure – collapsed and broken. He can’t make out any details because the faint blue light in the room is too dim. Redwing tweets in his ear and he hops down. He supposes that the blue light is some kind of surveillance or camera. It’s not going to stop him.
Jamison stops him. “He was brilliant the way he guided it and made sure everyone thought what he wanted them to think. He’s good. He’s very good, Tony. Beware the expert strategist.” With that, Jamison leaves and Tony’s stands there weighing his options. He’s sick and tired of all the dancing around. He retrieves Steven.
“Hmm that’s not a ringing endorsement of my as of yet unspoken proposal, but I will proceed.” Tony beams at him. “This upcoming event that Pepper’s planned at the Maria Stark Foundation. She’s convinced it has to be more than a gala. If it’s a gala it’s only a few hours long and my nemesis the reporter-.”
“Steve, Steve!” Tony grabbed for him, holding Steve’s head in place as he pushed further down his throat.  In response, Steve swallowed around the thick head of Tony’s cock feeling his throat try and lock up around it. Tony quaked as Steve swallowed again and again.
“I don’t want this to come to blows,” Rhodes says and drops his hand. “But Stark Industries is officially your employer, not Tony. Ms. Potts is the CEO; she is within her rights to dismiss you.”
Once in a while he is presented with a person sporting a vagina. When that happens most of the time, they want to peg him, and he’s down with that. Other times they want to dress him up in feminine clothes and then have him give them cunnilingus. It’s not exactly his cup of tea but he ends up with good tips and quite a clientele.
Tony only hums his assent.
“I can carry him,” Steve replies.
“Why? It’s at the bottom of the ocean,” Steve says.
“Yes, thrilling. It’s stirring my soul to poetic heights.”
“Stop moving. Steve is supposed to be here in 15 minutes and we still don’t have you ready. I have to pull out all the non-disclosure forms and the additional documents for the contract yet.” Pepper efficiently whips the knot into shape. She tugs down his collar and smooths out his jacket. Pressing her hands on his shoulders, she announces, “There that looks good.”
“Penny for your thoughts?” Tony stands to the side of the wild garden.
“Whatever,” Frigga says and continues, “He needs to see the truth of who the Soul Keeper is. Once he does, then we can free the realm of the Soul Keeper’s presence and all the souls trapped here.”
Steve tried. He stared at the middle distance. He listened to the voice of his mother, telling him to never let up, never stay down. He felt the soft and tender touch of Tony, taking care of him that first time – after they mated, and Steve only wanted to die. Steve clung to his memories, to the strength in them, but even he could not fight off the strength and power of his own biology. His stomach convulsed, and he choked and clamped his mouth shut but it didn’t matter. Blood flooded out of his nostrils, out of his mouth, he seized as it covered him in blood and bile. Tears stung his eyes, flowed down his cheeks to mix with the blood. He couldn’t breathe. Snot and blood stained his lips and chin. He hung onto the chains and wept.
“You’re doing fine, of course, sir.”
Tony grips his hand as Vision leads them. “Come on. To bed.”
Tony looks adequately subdued and Steve feels instantly ashamed. Verbal bullying is still bullying.  Before he can say anything, Tony responds, “Sorry, I shouldn’t have brought it up. You’re just so -.” He stops, stumbles over his words which Steve thinks is a new one for Tony, if he’s reading the man right.
Tony bit down, breaking open the wound and the flood of salt and iron filled his mouth. His eyes shuttered closed and his body rejoiced. He felt Steve go rigid against him, and then again, he went slack and hungry for Tony as the seconds passed. Tony swallowed the thick and delicious life fluid as he pulled back to see Steve concentrating on him. His pupils wide and the blue of his eyes nearly non-existent. Steve didn’t need to say a thing, nothing at all. Tony pushed him to lay flat on his back and then fully and completely encompassed Steve’s erection. They never needed to prepare or to use lube – not when Tony took in Steve. It wasn’t necessary. Tony transformed, his body answered the needs of his mate and his body accepted Steve. It was the way of mating and pairing with a human. The vampire’s biology was no longer defined by science. Tony felt his body give way, felt his own cock stiffen and throb as if a beating heart drove it. The dim lights around them sparkled and glittered in Tony’s vision. His body acted and reacted and Steve cried out with need.
“Back in the day, when I was a lot younger. A lot younger. I had a trainer back after they moved me from the children’s wing of the KGB to the adult wing. I was there for a while and they got me a trainer because I excelled. I never saw his face – you have to understand Steve. He was never allowed to unmask, not completely.”
“I am not a witch doctor.” The doctor steps into Tony’s line of vision.
THE END.
“Come on Tony, stay with me here.”
“I thought it was the universe that picked. I was kind of a vessel or something?”
“No, I don’t,” Steve says. He knows she’s furious, everyone in the room can read her. He won’t lie, but he will be brutally honest with her. “No, I won’t leave Bucky, or the town. Right now, whoever did this, whether it’s Loki-.” Thor starts to protest but Steve raises his hand to stop him. “Whether it’s Loki, or Schmidt got his hands on some of this concoction, then the town and everyone,
“Are you feeling all right, you never voluntarily eat.”
No one ever thought it would be a good idea to try it on someone who might need it as a way to escape health issues. Most of the government fell into the trap that Schmidt had – use it on strong men and make them even stronger. It just didn’t work that way.  Bruce had used it as a cure, but the serum didn’t cure that way – at all. Steve couldn’t say he understood how it made him better, but he knew that there were certain parts of his mind and his brain that were untouched and he had hoped would be cured by the serum that weren’t. Instead, as he became Captain America he simply shoved those failings into a compartment in his brain, closed it, locked it, and threw away the key. Lingering on his weaknesses during a world war helped no one.
“What am I?” Steve whispered and the fear welled up until it flooded him, drowning him with the truth. Whatever gathered inside of him, whatever supernatural power or demon – it was there. Steve knew it. Maybe the serum fought it, maybe that was why he felt so weak and debilitated. He wanted to ignore everything, even as his body shook with shock.
“Steve, Bucky was my trainer. He was in the Red Room with me. We bonded then. It was never a sexual bond, but it was a soul mate bond. No pack, just the two of us trying to get through the grueling training.”
“Nothing, nothing.” Tony examines the thermoses. “Which one has coffee?”
“That is all a little disturbing,” Steve says as he watches the gate close and latch again automatically. He’s not sure if it locks.
“Pepper and I-.” Tony muffles a curse. “Pepper and I co-parented yes. We married yes. Yes, we loved one another, but not the way- not how-.” He stops and tears stream down his face. “Not how I love you. Never. We are opposite sides of the same coin.” He violently wipes away the tears as if they are acid burning him. “Pepper knew, you know. She knew I loved you. We loved one another, yes, but it was never a romantic kind of love. We were friends and it worked. But we-.” He points between Steve’s chest and his own. “We had a chance.”
Tony unbuckles his seatbelt. “Well, now you know.” He stands. “Are you ready?”
Clint moved then. He walked over to Tony and placed a hand on his shoulder. “I’m sorry. I’ll do what I can.”
He knows that's the code. The words to tell him they can't withstand the attack. It's now or never. He glances up at Redwing who sits on the barred window of the cell door. The bird whistles long and low. Steve responds in a pathetic mewl.  Crawling over to the Jedi's side and wiping away the grime and dirt from his sunken chest, Bucky waves to Redwing. He hits the ear bud and says, "Coming out with feathers on our tail."  Another string of code to indicate they are being pursued. He doesn't know it yet, but he has to believe Red Skull set the whole thing up. He's waiting, willing to lose his prize Jedi for something more valuable. The new location of their Scholars’ base.
“You already got through the maze?” Steve asks. He’d thought Ultron told him that Tony was stuck somewhere at the end of the maze, that Steve had to rescue him. “How did you get free?” Maybe he’d been making assumptions based on what Ultron said. He ranks his brain. No. Ultron did not say Tony had the means to free himself. “You had the armor all this time?”
He allowed the feelings to tide over him like a ritual, a rite of passage, as he said goodbye to his last love. He murmured the reply, “Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer a lot of people are gonna die. Peggy, this is my choice.” It was his choice, but it had never been his choice
Bucky deposits him in the chair behind the desk and Steve releases a pent up breath. Doctor Banner, Clint, and another man – who stands off to the side in the darker corner of the front office – join them. There’s a moment of long silence and awkward surveillance where each of them are checking out the others.
Bruce shook his head. “Don’t go there, Tony. You don’t know what Steve’s been through. Hell, I don’t know what he’s been through. You can’t expect him to answer your cosmic questions right now.”
Tony almost didn’t read it, but it wasn’t Steve Rogers fault that Howard was a jerk.  With Blu on his lap, Tony sat on his bed and opened the book. It was a biography of Steve Rogers starting with his birth in 1918 on the 4th of July. Tony snickered at that little fact. He looked down at Blu.
Steve went to the box in the kitchen that had nothing in it at all. “I’m packing. I’m moving to DC at the end of the week.”
“Like those p and d electron orbitals you talked about,” Steve said and smiled.
“Guess that means, I’m a cat person.” He laughs a little to himself, but Blu pays him no mind.
“Fuck, no I’m not.” Tony grumbles and then adds, “Stop it. I’m taking you out to dinner.”
“Oh no.” Pierce ambled in and then directed several of the V-Corp agents out of the cell. They scrambled to follow their superior’s direction. “I already saw how you liked to watch the different vampires fuck him. That’s more than enough perversion for me. I just wanted to check on our experiment. That’s what’s important.”
He allows the horse to have her head and work her way down the rocky pathway; it takes too long and by the time they get halfway, sweat dips down Steve’s temples. Anxiety during a ride is never fun. He stretches and glances back at Tony, who is concentrating too hard on the ground, but moving with the horse like he was born to it.
“Want to taste you,” Tony says.
The milk bottle – empty, glass, an instrument of torture. Such a simple object.
“I didn’t do anything of the sort, Steve, and you know it.” Tony taps the little toy on its head. “He’s yours.”
“Don’t be, he was an ass,” Tony says and, for some reason, Steve doesn’t believe him.
Tony sees the moment that Steven understands that Tony might listen to his words, his questions about nature verses nurture, but he hasn’t imbibed them and made them his own. Steven recognizes it.
Tony buries his head against Steve’s shoulder near his neck. He knows he doesn’t deserve this piece of serenity, this tiny bit of his dream. But he closes his eyes and holds on, embraces Steve and hopes he’ll be able to go back to what they were just moments ago. Yet, Steve holds him, doesn’t refuse him, doesn’t push him away. In turn, he lightly touches his lips to the crown of Tony’s head – as if to kiss him to offer him some solace.
“Doctor? God,” Steve says and rubs his head. “How the hell long have I been out?”
“No, I didn’t need to,” Steve replied and he wanted to ask why he would have acted on it because the transfer of pain and confusion was more of a seeking than something that was an affliction. “I think the Hulk was confused but didn’t know how to communicate it.”
Turning, Steve frowns. “Is there something else?”
“Yes. We were a team. He was the greatest soldier. I’ve been remiss, son, I haven’t told you enough about Steve Rogers. That was his name, Cap’s name. I’ll get you a book to read. You’ll like it, better than that childish lion you’re hiding in your lap.” Howard hardened his gaze. “It would do you well to learn a little about a real man.”
“I don’t think I’m interested,” Steve replies. He glances between them.
Tony stops. “What?”
“Tony, I-.”
“Didn’t know this building had big apartments.”
“He is grown and willful.” Thor slams his mug down on the table upsetting some of the coffee pot but not enough to tip it over before Steve steadies it.
Sam edged closer. “You don’t have to worry about that.”
“No, together.” He cannot leave Steve, he’s already caused so much death, so much misery. He cannot leave Steve. “No, together, together.”
“Lucky they’ve got our eyes in the sky,” Sam said.
He can still remember his father telling him about the Uprising. It was an ugly thing. The Uprising ended any equality for the castes. Omega would always be the lowest rank. After the Uprising omegas were further segmented into the warrior class and the drone class. The warriors would bond with alphas while the drones would be selected for work in the Mating blocks. Under the tutelage of his father, Tony understood the necessity. As an alpha and a prime, he had been afforded the best of everything. His father both reveled in it and secretly hated it. While his father ended up with more power due to Tony’s birth and the ability to keep the Council seat of the Stark Family, he also deeply and consistently envied Tony’s biology and status. Having the finances to be part of the government was one thing. Having the biology to demand a right to the chair – that was something that eluded his father. Going to the Council of Worlds and making a good show of it and terrifying the other alphas with claims to the chair means that he needs the best omega warrior there is.
He’s not taking no for an answer. Steve follows, but with bare feet it’s nearly impossible; they double back and get the armor’s boots. Tony adjusts the size and has Steve step into them. He’s hesitant at first but Tony grumbles enough that he listens. With those equipped at least he can walk comfortably. The rest of the armor’s been picked for parts, worse than vultures on a carcass.
They eat in silence for a while. Every now and again, Steve instructs Tony where something is on the counter or reaches over and places it near him hand so he can find it easily. He still can’t determine how he would deal with this when they have to go out to a dinner. How is Tony going to force the host or hostess to include his PA at the table?
He’s not ready to concede, but he still needs information. He raises his hands and says, “No. He knows nothing about it.”
“Don’t you dare get Fury to send anyone. Don’t want to have to deal with Pierce.”
The touch must startle because Steve only shivers in response, but then the bird ducks under Steve’s hand so that it rests on his little head. A strange noise, cracked and pathetic, comes out of Steve and Bucky thinks it might be some sound of surprise.  Steve rests his hand lightly on Redwing and Bucky can only hope it’s a sign that Steve understands who is here now, that they are going home.
“Do you think everyone else is asleep or whatever constructs do when it’s night?” Steve asks.
Soon though, he happens upon the prince’s quarters and JARVIS permits him access almost immediately upon identification. Steve exhales as he enters and frowns.
“Aren’t you hot in the helmet?” Steve asks. “I can help you get it off.”
He arranges a short trip to DC and keeps Obie off his tail by promising to meet with some higher ups at the Pentagon. Nothing goes well there. But he gets flack for his lack of progress on the Jericho. He takes it all in his usual careless fashion all the while sneaking peeks at this phone. He has a short window to visit Aunt Peggy. He needs to be back to New York by nine tonight. He bought the whole night again with Steve.
“No sleeping pants?”
“Oh.” She looks at Tony then at the men hovering over his shoulder. “Okay.” She draws out the last word. “If you say so.”
“No bother,” Tony says and hops to his feet. He hauls Steve up as well. “Good thing we were interrupted, I still want to feed you dessert.”
Tony stopped dead. His breath came in heavy pants; any air he brought into his lungs seared him. The bond between them felt like a living thing. It throbbed and pulsed with crackling energy. It spoke out and everything else faded away. He heard it, the truth of it through the bond. Steve’s sorrow. His horror. His absolute faith that it was
“Sending a message to Phil now. He might be able to help, but it’ll get messy.”
“You’re going to go straight to Steve and ask him?” Bruce looks hopeful, as if Tony might actually take it as a hint.
Bucky peels open his eyes, grimaces, before saying, “No, Clint went with them-.” His words are halting and laced with pain. “You have to get him. He went with the Skull gang, joined up because of me.”
It took no time at all to get to the penthouse. It felt like forever. The doors opened, and Tony staggered out like he suffered from the side effects of the paralytic that Stane once injected him with. His skin felt clammy. His hands shook. He stumbled across the floor, trying to get to the bedroom. His body rebelled, and he pitched over falling into the conversation area near the fireplace. Grabbing hold of the white couch that he’d picked out with Pepper over a year ago, Tony managed to climb up onto the couch. His body went limp. He tried to call out to JARVIS, to say something, but his words muffled in his throat. JARVIS didn’t query him. He stared up at the far away ceiling and realized Steve was so far away, too far. He shouldn’t have left, he should be at his Beloved’s side. Maybe Steve was dying, and this was what it felt like when the bond wilted and died along with him.
When Tony walks back into the room with a tray laden with food and a steaming mug, Steve’s sitting on the side of the bed, staring down at his bare feet.
He resolved to try and be a different alpha – at least give some freedom to his omega. Let him grow and thrive. Estane had always schooled him with the idea that omegas needed to be put in their place, taught a lesson or two – otherwise the Worlds would go to ruin. Look what happened when betas ruled everything.
“Better.” Her features reminded Steve of a fox asked to guard the hen house. Why did he feel like he was about to be devoured? She pulled up her sleeve and showed her wrist to Fury. “We bonded.”
He studied the cage below and then he saw it, what had stricken Pepper mute. Fuck. It was like The Man in the Iron Mask by Alexander Dumas. A metal alloy covered the man’s upper face and shaved head– obscuring his eyes from sight. His mouth and the bottom of his nose was free from the mask but not from restraint. His mouth had something protruding from it that seemed bolted -
“Yes, everything I knew. I didn’t think it was fair, after so long, to keep the truth from him.” She stands up but he stays where he is, worried that his bulk might frighten her off. “He’s plagued by nightmares, images, things he cannot place. I figured it might help for him to know that way the nightmares that might be memories – well, they would start making some sense.”
Clint tilted his head in acceptance of Steve gripe. “I get that. Let’s just go together, shall we?”
Jarvis plates the wraps and adds French Fries which are obviously not Moroccan but Tony loves fries and eats them whenever he can.  Jarvis has a tendency to give in to some of Tony’s lesser bad habits. “And now, sir, I will retire for bit. Ana needs to go to a doctor’s appointment, and I would like to take her.”
Steve swallows down the hurt, the truth spears him harder and harsher than any knife. He doesn’t think he’s ever heard Logan speak so much in his entire life.
Steve employs JARVIS with every move of the schedule. By the time he’s nearly done, he’s spent over an hour freeing up at least one hour during the middle of each day for some down time for the prince. While he can’t move any of the planned conference, there are a lot of people clamoring for time with the prince of the Stark Systems.
“What’s going on?” Steve stands at the top of the stairs with sleeping pants on and the most adorable dopey look on his face.
Looking down at Steven, Tony tries to quell the alpha rage that boils at the surface. Sometimes these days, he feels like he is of two minds when it comes to Steven – he wants so much to know about, to be close to his omega, but at the same time he understands the decorum of the day. It isn’t about romantic love but a strategic requirement. His tutor and mentor Estane drilled the idea of the caste system into his head. Why does this omega make him question everything?
“And he is dead, but not here. Why is that?” Heimdall asks and then points to them. “And who are these waifs. I have told you I cannot take them with me. I cannot even take you, my queen. You are beings of a different substance than I.” Heimdall sizes them up and then points his sword at Steve’s chest. “He’s a new one of your lost puppies.”
“T’Challa said they have a respectable one, one that serves the palace dignitaries. He arranged a pass for it. I can go there and there shouldn’t be any issues.” He’s not looking forward to it, but he doesn’t really have a choice. If he doesn’t go to the mating blocks he thinks he might end up a little less sane. Right now, his sanity edges toward oblivion with Tony shores away and Bucky frozen and gone from him. Both untouchable.
Tony laces his fingers through Steve’s. “No one does when they first come here.”
EPILOGUE: FIVE YEARS LATER
Later, Clint, Steve, and Tony managed to put together a traveling plan after everyone else had cleared out of the common kitchen. Clint told them of a private farm they could use as a good training area. Clint rolled out a map of the residence and showed them an area of fallow ground. “This area here near the woods and the stream is open and not being farmed at the moment. It’s far enough away from the pasture land that the war games won’t really interfere or cause trouble with the grazing animals.”
He looks up at himself in the wide mirror plastered to the wall. He feels like he’s about to walk into another recruiting station and lie about his health as well as his residency. It’s been a long road from there to where he is now. He would never have dreamed any of it. He thought he would end up with Peggy or some other alpha. He wishes sometimes that it had been Peggy. He would have fathered her children, she would have loved him and they would have founded SHIELD together. Then he thinks of the parasite that grew within SHIELD and how it infected everyone and everything that he loved. The dream of that is gone now, along with all the ashes of his life.
“Yeah, yeah. I was going to go-.”
“I don’t think you need fixing,” Tony answered but the words were low in his throat. “I think you need to let go a little, stop being Captain America.”
He shouldn’t have involved Tony. Bucky, the Skull gang, Schmidt, they are all Steve’s problem – not Tony’s. When the storm clears, there’s only one thing to do – send Tony back to the town and face the Skulls alone.
“Coming in,” Natasha said, and Steve heard the clear zip through the air of a stinger being thrown. It hit Bucky’s arm but did little to stop him. He only held on through the electrical shock as it was carried to the armor. Tony screamed out, but the suit flared with a whirl of energy. Before Steve could tell her to stop, Natasha hurtled another stinger and it hit Tony square on the chest.
“Okay,” Steve mumbles and cannot help it that he’s hauled to Tony’s bedroom again, that his clothes come off far too easily, that he’s on his knees, between Tony’s legs, mouthing his cock.
with my mate. And I especially am not going to stand for her implicating Steve in betraying us. He would never do such a thing. Ever. For Christ’s sakes, he’s Captain America!”
“Every day, and Jarvis too. It’s been a long time since I had anyone to share my memories of them with, you know. Obie? Well, Obie was there and sees things a little differently than I do.”
“Let me help,” Steve said and lent a hand and shoulder for Tony to lean on.
“You don’t want me to. You don’t want me,” Tony says. The man wanted to die. When Tony first took him, he wanted to die, hoped to die. The man loved another.
The prince sweeps Steve away. Even though he’s terrified of stepping on Tony’s shoes, he never lands. Tony’s classically trained in dance, it’s evident from every move and twist, every touch and step. He treats Steve as if he’s a precious partner, gracing him with tender touches, moving him like an expert. Steve falls into the dance so easily, it is hard to believe he’s never truly danced before in his life. No one ever wanted him. Even as an escort at the station, Steve’s not been chosen to accompany any of his clients for a formal dance. He’s not that kind of escort, he’s not that kind of person. People don’t pick him for the dance, only for things that happen in the shadows.
After a moment’s silence, Bruce begins, “Tony would like to see you.”
“Neither have I,” Tony says. But he doesn’t need to do the math – at least not right away. He has the proof in the Jacuzzi tub. He looks at his phone. Well, probably not in the tub anymore. It’s been hours. “JARVIS, where is Steve?”
“Tony, we’ve spent the better part of a month together, night and day. We’ve eaten together, I’ve helped you pick out clothes, I tied your tie. I take care of you during your migraines. I’ve tried to be a good Personal Assistant, but also, a friend. I thought. That’s on me, I always end up blurring professional and personal relationships, that’s my fault. Not yours. I’m sorry.” The splurge of dialogue ends and Steve gulps in two quick breaths before releasing them in a low exhale. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have said any of that.”
“Yeah, good thing, right? I was a sickly kid,” Steve says. “She always had to take care of me. My one friend, he hung out a lot at my bedside, reading and -.” He stops. “I’d do that for him now, if he’d let me.”
He listens to none of it as Tony brings his hand to cradle the back of Steve’s head and guide him forward. The first touch graces his lips like a dance of wind, it is light, and airy, and stolen. Yet, Steve falls into it as if it drags him downward, an undertow daring to draw him under the waves. He welcomes it. His lips are dry and he fumbles but Tony shows him, with a stroke of a tongue soft and surprising, glancing over his lips and urging him to open.
Getting up, Steve leans over him and kisses his nose and then sasses, “Ah another kink.” He winks at Tony and then settles down between his legs. “I want you to relax for me, sweet one. I want you to close your eyes and just feel.” All the while, Steve opens the lube and dollops some of it on his fingers, warming it before he circles around Tony’s entrance. The surprise touch causes Tony to jerk. “Settle. Settle.”
"You can't." Steve's eyes turned flat, cold, but also defeated. "You need to leave and not come back."
“Sounds nice,” Steve says. “Is it okay to go for a hike? No one will see us?”
Tony went through the cupboard again. “I think I saw something. Ah, here they are.” He pulled out two dented tin cups from the shelf behind the table. “I guess these will do.” He brought them over to the fire.
“Steve?” Sam called out.
Tony adjusted his position so he looked at Steve. “Really? You think about me.”
Tony bites back his laughter. “Here you want some syrup on the waffles.” He coats the stack with a river of syrup. “You’ll like it. Nice and sweet.”
“Trust no one,” Fury says as if it’s a dismissal. He stares after Fury as the man weaves his way through the busy station.
“Time to wash up.”
“He wants the Hulk to eat us,” Steve says and turns inland.

“Sometimes you have to give up a valuable piece to win the game,” Steve sneers and then the world drops away around him. A whirling wind of pixels and particles hurtle around him, slamming into him like sleet and ice cold hail.  He squints his eyes and cannot make out his adversary. “You’re not going to win. You can’t win.”
The lion rumbles louder but sounds like the old men Tony used to see at the park when he was a child. They’d sit there playing chess, complaining about the noise, the current politicians, and very often the children at play around them.
Pietro wakes him up for his watch and Steve thanks him. He notes that Tony’s moved and doesn’t look at peaceful anymore. “How has he been?”
Tony stretched back to Steve and grasped his hand. “No. Don’t worry. It’s just uncomfortable for me to think about.”
Tony rubs at his eyes and then releases a heavy breath. “Jesus. I just don’t know. This is like fighting myself.”
Steve ushers them in the correct direction, leading Tony down the wide hallway to the main bedroom suite. While there are 5 bedrooms with baths, the master suite is the largest. They walk into a vestibule area with a closet on the left-hand side with a small alcove on the right for hanging coats and jackets.
He’s entranced by the little automated cart that’s hooked up to some copper wires to a control in Peter’s hands. The boy sees Steve and jumps up to run to him. “Sheriff, did you see it? Did you see what Tony made?”
“It’s okay. It’s okay.” Tony cries, tears of pain he’s been holding in stain his face, and Steve holds him. “I’m here. I’m here.”
Grabbing his shield, Steve ran over the uneven terrain trying to avoid the down branches and slippery mud. “Sam, get to Nat.”
“Shit!” Tony yells and launches the suit into the air. It’s barely functioning, the HUD display fogs out more than once. “JARVIS how much does a full grown lion weigh?”
“That’s just it, Tony. I don’t want to wait anymore. I’m tired of waiting, of denying myself. Of always being practical and never opening myself up for something I want, something I need.” His large hands tighten around the small of Tony’s waist. “I want this. I want to be a little selfish.”
“Doctor Cho said you might have some issues with vision and auditory artifacts. The serum didn’t play well with the interface.” Sam crosses his arms over his chest – a stance Steve always paired with him readying for battle. “You’re going to be okay, Steve. You know that, right?”
T’Challa studied Steve with an eye like a scientist investigating a new species of insect. “We all have our labels that say much about who we want to be and who people think we are. With your mate you both are a gift to this world, to your nation. You only have to use it and use it well to find a new peace.” He sat back and studied Steve again. “You know how to do this, Captain. You just have to find your way.”
