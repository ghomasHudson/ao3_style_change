He spends the next thirty minutes going from calm deep breathing and trying to hack his way into the system, to banging loudly on the door, first asking Jarvis politely to let him in, to yelling at Tony or anybody to open the door.
“Seriously, what’s up with the omelette?” Nat asked, nodding at the plate as they all watched Tony as he almost comically chewed the bite in his mouth and visibly tried not to gag when he swallowed it. “Is this like the time you made Pep—”
But, he had signed the amended Accords. Mostly for Bucky, because he’d known that Bucky was itching to come home, and to start working for the right side, the side that he chose, after decades of being under someone else’s control. Steve knew that the guilt still gnawed at him and would continue to do so. That the nightmares wouldn’t stop their brutal forthcomings until Bucky could finally write off his conscience.
Tony ran a trembling hand through his hair, his eyes going wild as he came to the only conclusion that presented itself. He turned to Steve, who looked as frazzled as he was as they both stood there barely noticing the cool air that was emanating from the open refrigerator in waves.
“I don’t know how to describe it. It wasn’t exactly one thing, it was more of a….feeling. And I knew right then, that she was the one for me.”
“Cut the chatter, Avengers,” Steve cuts in with one hand to his comm. The bots have stopped emerging from the portal, but the ones in the city are far from defeated. They’ve collectively taken out perhaps a fifth of the horde that had entered the city earlier that night. “Anyone got a read on Thor? We’ve got to shut this thing down and now would be great.”
Steve slowly circled the cabin, keeping an eye out for anything that seemed abnormal, both about the cabin or in the clearing surrounding it. Everything was exactly the same as it had been fifteen minutes ago when they’d landed at the edge of the clearing, except for the light snow that had begun to fall.
Steve and Tony were going to check out the forest and surrounding area to see if they could recover members of either of the two SHIELD teams that they’d lost contact with and see if there were any samples they could recover that would point them to the source of the anomalies that SHIELD had registered. Bruce was going to remain at the jet and conduct sweeps with their radar to see if they could get a hold of any tech that still might be out there, human or otherwise. They’d decided on a signal for if the Hulk was ever going to be required, but Steve was sincerely hoping that it wouldn’t come to that. Clint was to stay with Bruce for back-up since he was technically still retired according to the SHIELD roster.
Steve got up first, placing The Hobbit onto the low coffee table and picking up their empty mugs of coffee. By their usual routine, Tony would get up as well, shuffling to the bathroom to take his turn with the shower and to brush his teeth before bidding Steve goodnight and head inside to the bedroom.
Much later, when he’s changed into his uniform and studying a hologram in the cockpit of a SHIELD Helicarrier, Steve can’t help but wonder once again, if he’s doing the right thing for his son.
“Captain, here. Where do you need me, Widow?” He asks when the Widow is within earshot. She turns to him, black mask exposing only her beady, blue eyes.
When the elevator doors had slid shut, Natasha emerged from the darkness of her room, her features set in a frown from the persistent blare of the alarm.
They’d gotten in and out smoothly, secured the tech as well as the SHIELD hostages and taken in the low-level goons who hadn’t quite managed to make the grand escape that they’d clearly been planning to. The SHIELD agents had been new recruits, two young men who had looked equally starstruck and sheepish at having the Avengers come to salvage their failed mission. All in all, it had been quick and easy, definitely not a task the Avengers had been required for. Steve had seen it for what it was. A simple mission that could have easily been taken over if Steve and Tony hadn’t been able to work past their personal issues for the sake of the job.
They watch the pair leave in silence, before Tony shrugs and flops back onto the couch, telling JARVIS to resume the movie from the last pause. Thor resumes chewing his mouthful of popcorn, and Bruce just sits back with a long-suffering sigh. Steve untangles himself from Tony, and shuffles off into the kitchen.
“So are you,” he said because it was true. Nat rarely showed if she was scared. Tony knew that it probably had to do with years of torture in the name of training back when she was in the Red Room, but it had turned into an unhealthy way to cope with what she had to do even now. This time was different. Tony could tell that she was terrified.
“Guess you’re right,” Stark nearly purrs. “Maybe if you’re lucky, Captain, you’ll find out just how I got away from those goons.”
Natasha makes a beeline for Clint’s desk as soon as they arrive at his room, starting to rummage through the piles of numerous papers, empty coffee cups, and magazines that are scattered across the surface. Clint stands back a few paces, watching from a safe distance as Natasha’s rage is taken out on every piece of paper that comes in her way.
But Tony hadn’t let go of him. He’d held him close for the entire five minutes it had taken for them to get from the jet to the hideout where they’d gotten word of the sceptre being kept.
This was good. They were getting out of here. He could open the front door and leave like anyone else.
“Saw it comin’, Cap,” she retorts breathlessly as the bot weaves in and out of the buildings in the heart of Manhattan, steadily making its way towards the gaping portal in the middle of Times Square.
He’d failed them all. Steve. The team. The SHIELD agents who’d gone missing before them. He was a fucking failure.
“Exactly. But it’s covered in a layer of dust that I definitely remember wiping down this morning and the morning before.” Steve said, pointing to the aforementioned coating of grime that made the toaster look like it had been pulled out of someone’s dead grandmother’s attic.
“No answering the door by yourself, Pete, unless we’re expecting anybody, remember?” Steve chastises as he and Peter reach the door together. He pulls it open, expecting more mail, only to reveal Bucky on the other side.
“Hey there, pal. You missed me?” Tony asked him as he walked further into the room, machines and holo-screens coming alive as he walked past them. He unbuttoned his cuffs and pushed his sleeves down his arms, ooh-ing and mhm-ing at Dum-E’s elaborative chirps and buzzes as the bot followed closely at his heels.
“I’m sure you are, Steve,” Dr. Fieldstone replies, interrupting Tony’s train of maudlin thoughts. “Wouldn’t it help to talk about it though? From what Peter has told me, I think there’s a cloud of emotion that you’re refusing to address. Your son is really worried about you, Steve.”
The lights have been dimmed to almost complete darkness, so not in the sexy way. The sheets are rumpled on the bed, again not in the sexy way. The only sexy thing about the whole situation is the vaguely supersoldier shaped lump softly snoring away underneath the rumpled bed sheets, and Tony isn’t so sure he wants to be one of those creepy somnophiacs so he stops that thought before it comes to being.
When Steve made his way into the kitchen, the note folded into a tiny square and pressed tightly to the inside of his fist, there were two plates of extremely lopsided pancakes on the island and Tony already seated on one of the stools.
Iron Man raises one gauntlet to his helmet, as if to remove it, but then shifts away again, his arm dropping back down to rest by his side. He turns to face Steve, and the eerie expression of the Iron Man helmet which Steve had once found unsettling renders him with an odd sense of relief, amongst another feeling Steve cannot quite pinpoint.
Thoughts of Steve soon gave way to his fears about tomorrow. His mind flashed back to the video clips they’d been shown, the eyes on the screen. Xixi. Kielan. Evan. Rachel. Eleanor. Dulquer. The screams and the cut to black screens. What had they seen that Tony hadn’t been able to? What was out there?
“Do you think you could ever love someone else as much as you loved your wife?” Doctor Martha asks, prodding Steve to offer an interesting response.
Steve had been a tough nut to crack, and that statement was rather an understatement, but after the multiple run-ins at ungodly hours of the night in the team common room that had eventually become actual dates during the day, they’d shared the sort of trauma that was both typical baggage that came with being alive as well as the not so usual trauma that they eventually learned to shoulder together. When they’d said to find someone with shared life experiences, the two of them had gone above and beyond that.
Climbing out of bed, he grabs a robe hanging off the back of a chair and slips it around himself. Tony heads out of his bedroom, deciding that since he was already up, he might as well get some work done. He makes himself some coffee and while he waits for the machine to finish brewing his drink, Tony casts a wary glance around his bleak penthouse. It’s perfectly spotless with curtainless windows with a view of the beautiful Manhattan skyline. The untouched cushions are arranged on his sofa in an aesthetically pleasing manner, with their orange and blue asymmetrical triangle patterns daring anyone to sit on them. Framed artwork covers every inch of the walls, all purchased by Pepper of course. Tony couldn’t name a single piece if he was held at gunpoint.
The comm line falls silent except for the sound of metal clanging as the Avengers work together to neutralize the threat. Widow activates the EMP which doesn’t seem to have an effect on the suit’s tech.
The car had finally arrived and Tony stepped off the curb, leaving Steve standing there watching after him. He felt like absolute shit as he got in the car without even giving him a second glance, but it hurt too much to. The tinted glass of his window thankfully hid Steve’s dejected face from his view as he sped out of there.
Steve sighs in exasperation, though he can’t help but think fondly of his ridiculous teammates. “Alright, guys. Thor, can we shut this thing down please? I would very much like to cap this and go home.”
Tony thinks about this. “When’s 3 o’clock?” he asks, feeling like it was awful late. What did Jarvis and Ana and Mom and Dad do for all that time?
They threw a stupid party on day 69 because Tony figured he owed it to the team to uphold his title as the biggest man-child of the Avengers and Steve was a huge troll. The only attendees had been the two of them, donning dusty party hats that Steve had scrounged up out of a box in the linen closet and looked hilariously tiny sitting precariously on top of Steve’s head, and the tiny helper bot that Tony had built to help them solve the floor puzzle which they had acquired no more success on than the day they had discovered it.
An urgent mechanical beeping sound fills the kitchen, startling Steve out of his reverie. He glances down at his Stark Industries manufactured Avengers Identicard, which alerts him of another situation in Manhattan. He quickly shoves it back into his pocket, away from Bucky’s suspicious eyes.
“Yeah, you better hope so,” Steve murmurs, still half in shock at the possibility that quite literally the entire country could have heard his sob story. He finishes safely transporting the turkey into the freezer when the doorbell rings three times in quick succession. Before Peter can scramble off his stool to get the door, Steve is already striding towards it.
“I went through the encrypted files on his computer like you told me to,” Pepper says, and when she finally looks at him, her gaze has softened with sympathy that Tony hates on sight. “I found invoices dated just after your press announcement to shut down weapons manufacturing at Stark Industries. They’re legitimate, Tony.”
The host returns, letting the listeners know what number to call to share their thoughts about the man, who they have dubbed “Sleepless in Seattle.” Annoyed at the show and himself, Tony switches off the radio, nearly missing his exit in the process.
“J, buddy, hit the lights for me,” he called out with a grin as he walked down into his workshop. Dum-E whirred to life at his arrival, chirping happily and rolling towards him as fast as his wheels could carry him. Tony chuckled and ran a gentle hand down the familiar strut of Dum-E’s back, smiling when the bot rolled forward to headbutt his knee.
“Well, don’t let me keep you. There doesn’t seem to be much happening tonight, but it’s probably just less visible to us since we’re in the city.” Bruce offers, carefully adjusting the mount on the telescope so that it could pan to another section of sky.
Suddenly, a flashing tiny red light from a corner of the room catches his attention. With a small grin of triumph, Thor slowly edges closer towards the general location of the mysterious object.
“Yeah, exactly. Thor said the reality stone can warp reality—well, duh,” Tony rolled his eyes, smiling hesitantly when Steve chuckled. “Maybe this cabin isn’t even real.”
“I know you are, Steve,” Bucky reassured him, pulling Steve into a hug that he fell into gratefully. He wrapped his arms around Bucky’s very solid, very alive presence and buried his face in his shoulder. Suddenly, he was seventeen again, his Ma in the TB ward with her ‘kerchief dotted with blood and Bucky sitting next to him at home with a steadying hand on his shoulder. The instant relief he had felt then and now was like stepping out after being saturated with the Vita Rays and being able to take his first lungful of unobstructed oxygen.
There it was again. Moving on. Steve didn’t know why he had so much trouble with it when everyone else seemed to manage just fine. Maybe it was a good thing, that he never moved on. If he had moved on after they’d pulled him from the ice, he wouldn’t have Bucky.
“The radio, sir. Your most listened to station in the last two weeks, by my records.” Comes JARVIS’ reply. Tony grimaces to himself, thinking back to the last few times he’d been down in the workshop to get some work done. Apparently, he’d been subconsciously tuning into late night radio for loners, and he couldn’t tell if that was worse or better than actively tuning in.
Steve rolls his eyes, but the corners of his lips are tugged up against his will into a small smile. He nods at the stack of letters again. “How many people listened to that anyway?”
Tony winces bodily, setting a placating hand on top of the stack. “I’ll do them now, Pep. I swear. I just, I got caught up in the workshop, you know how it gets. I’ll stay late if I have to, but I will get them done.”
They didn’t end up returning to the floor puzzle for days, preoccupied with each other or the various things they found around the little cabin. Tony came to discover that he didn’t care.
It wouldn’t budge. Steve pulled as hard as he could, alarmed when not even the doorknob gave way from his strength. Tony stepped forward and lifted up his arm, the repulsor whining before blasting the door. Through the smoke that immediately unfurled from the strike, Steve could make out the door, standing perfectly solid and as untouched as it had been when they had entered the cabin.
Tony had known when he’d sat down at the kitchen island that first evening, claiming it for his makeshift workspace, that he wouldn’t be able to build their escape out of this hellhole. He’d tried anyway, because the thought of sitting idly while they waited for the team to find them — if they were even still alive — rankled.
“Whoever abducted him must not have realized that he was the Avengers’ benefactor, and so they forgot to get rid of his Identicard. We can track him using that.”
The week after that was hopeful, with Tony and Steve working on the puzzle with renewed effort, Buster loyally assisting them whenever he was required. They worked in shifts, one wordlessly getting up to make them lunch or coffee. Most often it was Steve who got up first, turning on the wireless radio to the classic rock station that Tony had managed to reach, and chopping up fruit to make one smoothie or another. Usually kale, because he knew it was Tony’s favourite.
Tony swoops down low over the city, catching sight of pink lights strung up above restaurant tables and obnoxious heart shaped….things appearing wherever he looked. There were heart shaped candies, heart shaped balloons, a giant heart shaped flower arrangement over at Central Park that promised a spectacular tacky proposal fail, and a tiny dog wearing a sweater with tiny, red, smiling hearts all over it. God, Tony hated Valentine’s Day. As if they needed another excuse to further instill capitalism in the name of happiness and love.
Much later, they’d been allowed to disband and retire to their rooms for the night after thorough physical examinations and therapy had been repeatedly recommended to them both.
He drives off the ramp, finding himself unable to get rid of the strange feeling in his stomach about the oddly familiar voice of “Sleepless in Seattle” and his son.
“As you wish, sir,” comes the AI’s polite reply. The armour flies him in a circuit above the city, the thousands of twinkling lights down below making Tony feel a slight sense of vertigo as he looks down.
“Avengers, this is a Clearance Level 8 situation, meaning some of your clearance levels have been updated for this purpose alone. Other than the people gathered in this room, there is very few personnel who have access to this information.” Fury began, as ominous as ever. Tony did notice that he looked tenser than usual, but he wasn’t sure if that was the normal amount of tense that Fury perpetually carried with him, causing his trademark hybrid bat and pirate-like appearance, or if it was the kind of tense that he should be more concerned about.
Steve turns back to the groceries, this time taking out a box of Froot Loops and a family size box of Lucky Charms. Shaking his head, he places them on the very top shelf of the pantry.
His dad had made it all better though. All of that was almost two whole birthdays ago, if he recalls correctly. Peter is almost seven now. He’ll be going to a new school after the summer was over, and his dad had promised him that he’d make a ton of friends and that he was going to love their new home. His dad was making them a new life, kind of like when he was painting but it didn’t turn out the way he wanted, so his dad would rip the paper very carefully off the easel and smooth his hand down the crisp white surface of a blank sheet so he could start again.
“I know it was an accident. I’m just messing around with you. Also, gently reminding you to not poison me. Maybe.” Tony placated, glancing up at U with a quirk in his lips before returning to oiling Dum-E’s joints.
“Yes,” Tony blurts out into the silence of his car, immediately clapping one hand over his mouth as soon as the word escapes his mouth. That’s what you got for listening to crappy late night interviews with self-acclaimed “love experts”; you start losing your damn mind.
The boy who might be named Stella has a bright blue crayon in his fist that he scribbles onto the page their teacher had given them a little while ago to draw on. Tony can’t tell what he’s drawing from his spot, but the boy seems like he knows exactly what he wants on the page. Tony wishes he could be that sure about anything.
“You know it,” Steve muttered, already on his knees and lifting up the part of the duvet that was hanging over the side of the bed so he could peer underneath it.
Steve nodded, his teeth clenched against the wall of ice that threatened to have his mind buried inside of it. Tony nodded as well, slowly stepping away from him and directing Steve to one of the barstools at the island. He pushed Steve down onto it and then crossed the room to pull the open window shut.
It seems inconspicuous enough. It’s a small silver….machine, by the looks of it, not unlike the multitude of others that Thor has been introduced to during his time at Midgard. Except this one is beeping rather insistently, and he wants it to stop.
The cabin itself was small, as he’d noticed when they’d first flown in. Steve estimated that it couldn’t have been more than five-hundred square feet. It was a rectangular log cabin, the slanted trapezoidal roof dusted with a light layer of snow. There were three wooden steps leading up to the front door, which was painted a bright red colour that wasn’t in accordance with the faded outer appearance of the rest of the cabin. On the same outer wall of stacked logs as the door was a single, covered window.
Tony was the first to notice his arrival, his scowl transforming into a hesitant smile as he turned to wave at Steve.
Steve huffed out a laugh, shaking his head as he gently nudged the tray back in and sat back on his haunches, fiddling with the TV remote in his hold.
Tony kept working, despite knowing that nothing would come of it. He suspected that Steve also knew that, but he humoured Tony anyway, either because he knew that Tony would literally go insane if he did nothing or because he still hoped that Tony would figure it out somehow. He’d gotten out of a cave in the middle of the Afghan desert with only a box of scraps after all. Unfortunately, Tony knew better than anyone else that a bunch of terrorists with boxes of his own tech was definitely not the same as an extraterrestrial anomaly that had shoved them into this time trap seemingly without any intent to harm them physically.
“Also, the frequency and strength of energy that’s being emitted isn’t like any source that we’ve seen on Earth, my tech included,” Tony added with a smirk. “This right here, that’s alien tech. But we already knew that. Sort of.”
“I resent that. I’ll have you know that my taste in men is very refined.” Tony scoffed, scooting back into the cushions and pulling the Afghan blanket hanging over the back of the couch onto his lap.
Bruce feels the tell-tale pain in his joints, before his line of thought starts going haywire, and the Avengers alarm begins to blare.
“Don’t do that, bud,” Steve pleads, brushing brown locks out of Peter’s face. “Remember when I said I got two jobs so that we can live here and eat lots of pizza and maybe, possibly, get a dog? Well, I’m going to have to go to one of those jobs if you still want all that, Pete.”
“Nat? You okay?” Tony asked, already stepping into his awaiting suit as Steve got ahold of his shield again. “If no one says anything, Cap and I are gonna haul our asses to you.”
That’s what they were doing. They were starting again on a fresh piece of paper, except the paper was Seattle and they lived in a really small house, Peter thought.
It’s a few minutes before the Hulk sits down heavily wearing a truly magnificent pout, the green slowly fading out as Bruce returns to them. Natasha hurries over with a blanket that she had procured out of nowhere, wrapping it around his bare shoulders.
Steve hurries forward, swinging his shield onto his back as his feet bring him closer to Stark. The others have dispersed, making sure the kidnappers have been thoroughly neutralized and further assessing the situation to see if there were any more lingering around. Steve realizes he doesn’t have the key to unlock the cuffs when he gets to Stark’s side.
The other days, he would sit cross-legged next to Steve on the floor, writing down failed combination after failed combination or turning the dials himself while Steve had the list.
“You never gave me any reports! All we’re gonna find in my room is you looking sheepish because you didn’t give them to me,” Clint says as he walks (or more accurately, jogs) in order to keep up with Natasha’s too-long strides.
The recording had begun to experience some sort of interference, a slight crackling that had very quickly drowned out the urgent voices of the agents, and abruptly cut off as someone started to scream. Just like the previous two video clips that they had watched.
The two espionage and combat specialists had been the ones to venture into the town, stating their names as Dulquer and Rachel to identify themselves at the beginning of the recording. They had dated it to almost two and a half weeks ago. They’d begun by visiting what they perceived to be the hubs of the town: a popular diner and a string of small businesses that seemed to form the town square. The streets had been barren, sidewalks empty and roads clear of any vehicles, personal or commercial. They had noticed that despite the apparent desertion, there had been cars lined up along the side of the sidewalk, but no signs of abandonment. No car doors haphazardly flung open as the people within tried to flee- whatever had caused them to disappear so abruptly. No signs of looted stores or vehicles forming the tableau of a brutal crash that would’ve suggested any struggle.
Steve let out a sound that was somewhere between a self-deprecating chuckle and oh-God-please-don’t-remind-me groan. Being on the run from the government had not been one of Steve’s career goals, he’d mostly been trying to make it through the next errant coughing fit and attempting to not get evicted, but he figured that people have ended up in weirder places.
“What do you mean, gone? How could he have just left?” He finally responds, ignoring the concerned glances from everyone in the Helicarrier.
“Hulk, you’re going to cover our perimeter, make sure the bots don’t step out of it, and Widow, you’re with me on the ground. We’ll notify everyone when Thor arrives.” The Hulk takes off with great bounding leaps that leave the ground shaking underneath them, and Widow positions herself on the other side of the portal with her back against Steve’s.
That was worrisome on its own, considering the limited breadth of information that they had been given for this mission that was operating on another scale entirely. Steve had worked missions for SHIELD with far less information in the past, but they usually hadn’t been as perturbing as this one was turning out to be. He knew that Tony and Bruce had probably stayed up long after the rest of them had gone to bed last night, trying to decipher as much as they can from the very little scientific data that SHIELD had gotten ahold of before they’d lost contact with both teams of agents, but he wasn’t sure how much they would’ve been able to get out of the very tiny fraction of information that they had out of the much larger picture they hadn’t even managed to grasp.
They hadn’t all been called in to work a mission together for months. Definitely not since the Accords, and even before, Tony thought it might’ve been their little sceptre raid parties when it had just been the six of them, that they’d all been called in at the same time.
reaction to seeing Steve, he frowned to himself as an errant thought out of the hundreds firing synapses inside his brain stuck around for more than the usual millisecond. It was strange that Steve, and by the looks of it, Natasha as well, had been invited this time. They had only gotten back from Wakanda four months ago, barely cleared for missions with the newly established SHIELD at this point. They weren’t exactly popular with the particular species of human that made up the gala crowd at the moment.
Except, it wouldn’t be like that this time around. Steve would doodle on his own, his seat far enough away from Tony that he wouldn’t even be able to see him out of the corner of his eye. Tony was— surprisingly fine with this, he realized in a very silent “huh” moment.
“What’s the situation?” He asks no one in particular, making eye contact with the Scarlet Witch, who thrusts her hands at him and then above, red tendrils of magic propelling him up.
Steve’s heart turns to ice when he hears the words, not really comprehending them until someone calls his name.
“Cross my heart,” Tony swore to him, trying not to drop his watermelon as they reached the large barn doors that were nearly vibrating with the force of the music behind them.
Peter sniffs and buries his face into the soft fur of his toy dog. He nudges his head into Steve’s hand, and Steve nearly breathes out in relief.
When he’s finally situated in his office for his well-deserved lunch break, Tony munches on the cheddar bacon sandwich one of the interns had gotten him, pretending to be working on the large pile of paperwork with a bright pink sticky note on top labelled, “THESE BETTER BE SIGNED, TONY” with five exclamation points.
In his defence, Tony hadn’t exactly planned on being stuck behind Basic Brittany with her pin-straight blonde hair and dressed in Lulus that Tony had thought were strictly a soccer mom outfit staple until this very moment. She had her phone pulled out, reciting her very complicated coffee order to the poor girl behind the counter who looked like she was about five seconds away from putting in her two weeks’ notice. It seemed that Basic Brittany had veered very off course from her usual Starbucks this evening.
Iron Man flies over hesitantly to where the suit has collapsed onto the ground, its metallic limbs trembling with aftershocks from the lightning. He reaches out with one gauntlet, reaching behind the giant armour’s head and triggering what must be an emergency release. The helmet shifts back to reveal a man’s face, one that Steve doesn’t recognize, but Iron Man clearly does. He reels back as if in shock, falling back to the ground with a painful metallic clang.
“Technically, SHIELD was never after Steve,” Sam pointed out with a frown. “First, it was Hydra parading as SHIELD and then it was-- the U.S. government.” He finished haltingly.
The drawing is quickly forgotten by the both of them, but Tony remembers to tell Steve to bring it home to his Ma when the bell rings at the end of the day.
His dad grins at him and the grumpy expression that has made itself at home on Peter’s face before crouching down until he’s at Peter’s level. The pile of books teeters dramatically to one side, but his dad hurriedly repositions his arms so that he’s cradling them more securely. Peter watches in mild awe as the books just right themselves in his father’s grasp once again. He has yet to see his dad fail to make things better for them, even the worst things.
Steve frowned, his fork stalling midway to his mouth. “But you said there could be hundreds of thousands of combinations. It could take us months to figure it out.”
“Let’s get you two home. We’ll explain on the way,” Sam said, reaching forward to clasp Steve’s shoulder. Steve stood stock still for a moment too long before he followed, his hand locked onto Tony’s elbow pulling him along.
Tony may have been desperate but he definitely wasn’t dumb. He knew his car wasn’t going to arrive in time to aid him in his frantic departure. So when he heard the footsteps behind him, he didn’t bother turning around. And yet, he continued to longingly search for his very late car, even as he felt Steve approach him from behind.
Steve ventured into the clearing, wading through the snow cautiously, almost as if he was expecting a mine to go off from under his feet as soon as he stepped away from the forest of conifers. The clearing itself had a diameter of about two hundred feet, the cabin sitting at the very centre of it. The thicket of trees formed an almost perfect circle around the cabin, the perimeter line separating it from the trees far too crisp to be a product of nature.
Peter runs down the walkway and finds an empty seat beside another kid sitting with her mom. He settles in, and when he can’t figure out how to buckle his seatbelt, the mom reaches over to help him. Peter decides travelling by himself is quite fun. He watches the free movies on the little TV attached to the seat in front of him, all the while keeping one hand firmly inside of his pocket where Tony’s letter rested.
“Hell yeah,” Tony breathes, shifting more comfortably against him so that their bodies were practically slotted together. He goes quiet, his thumb softly stroking the back of Steve’s hand as his breath starts evening out.
“This is so not going according to plan. There is no plan anymore. We are very much plan-less,” Tony muttered, as the missiles exploded against the glass of the windows, their impact seemingly muffled by the glass, and doing nothing except shattering into pieces of shrapnel on the floor.
Fuck it. Tony triggers the armour’s release, waiting for the metal plates to slide open before he steps out onto the ground in front of him. He takes in a breath, his gaze locked on Steve’s wide eyes as he also puts the pieces together.
Half of them are asleep by this point, or well on their way there. Natasha’s got one silk pyjama covered leg slung over a snoring Clint’s thighs on the loveseat, Bruce is sprawled across the recliner his eyes half shut, and Thor seems to have given up entirely. His open mouth is full of popcorn threatening to make an escape with each rumbling snore. Tony and Steve are the only ones who are actually watching the movie, though Tony’s constant running commentary and ill-timed nudges seem to be the only things that are keeping Steve’s eyes from completely giving up on him.
The stores had been locked, providing some insight for the lack of lootings, but they’d all been certain that the locked storefronts did little to guarantee that the residents of this town had left voluntarily. Everything within the stores and businesses seemed to remain as they would have been regularly, minus the eerie lack of customers and workers inside. The lights were off in every building, and everything within, from furniture in a coffee shop to the drugs within a pharmacy, had all been left completely untouched.
It had been a few months since the sabbatical and Steve was back to running missions with the team on behalf of the newly reformed SHIELD. The Avengers were sprawled out all over the country now and definitely expanded past the six of them that had taken down Loki what felt like an eternity ago. For a guy who had technically been alive for almost ten decades, an eternity should not have felt like such a goddamn long time.
Tony watched idly (he kind of overshot to panicked instead of the idle he’d been going for) as Natasha leant in close to Steve, turning her body away from the crowd to presumably tell him something before leaving his side, making her way over to the table where Pepper was sitting with the SI donors. Shit. If they’d located Pepper it wouldn’t be long before Tony himself got made.
Tony Stark has never been someone Steve has had frequent interactions with after he joined the Avengers. He had always been an intimidating enigma who Steve had somewhat disliked but still appreciated from afar, his gratitude towards the man extending to him being the benefactor of the team. Growing up in extreme poverty for much of his life had rendered him to be very cautious regarding the very rich, very famous, and very important, three categories which Stark would seamlessly fit into. Although, their earlier exchange had felt eerily similar to flirtation, and Steve wasn’t sure how he felt about that, still having reservations regarding letting someone new into his life.
He checks on Jeff the puppy that he and Nat had found during one of their nightly walks through the city and had gone to great lengths to hide from the rest of the team. Tony had a Rule about pets, but Thor hadn’t been able to help himself. Besides, he himself thought that Tony would be much less inclined to create such misguided Rules if he got himself a small companion such as Jeff.
He froze, feeling sick to his stomach. Bile settled at the base of his throat as something tightened around his chest, constricting him like a boa preparing its next meal. His heart began to race, his palms grew clammy and his vision began to darken at the edges. Steve couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t breathe….he was driving the aircraft into the ice, nose-diving, all he could see was white, blinding, then it was cold, so cold it turned the air in his lungs to ice—
“Maybe if we talk about it, your son would feel better about this. He seems very worried about you, Steve.” The doctor is saying when Tony starts paying attention again. He rolls his eyes, imagining what exactly would happen to this “doctor” if the man decided to do something about the insane violation of his privacy that this was.
and is named Ty fucking Stone thinks of him, when the music changed, hoots of delight going up from the couples of the middle-aged variety on the dance floor as the tempo picked up.
After that, the both of them had only been on two other missions together, but Steve still saw Tony at debriefs and tactical meetings every so often. Every time he saw him, Tony always had his guard up, his back ramrod straight and eyes blank and unexpressive in a way that was so unfamiliar to Steve that he almost couldn’t recognize him. That was also fine, Steve told himself. As long as he got to see Tony at all, it was fine.
Tony turned so quickly, he felt a twinge in the side of his neck. “You’re shitting me. No, you’re not. Oh my God, Steve Rogers gets senior discounts! What the fuck?” Tony guffawed, peering at Steve’s twitching lips that betrayed his own grin.
Peter sits on the bed even though his dad had told him not to repeatedly, because they hadn’t gotten around to unpacking the mattress yet and so the bed was just a metal frame right now. Peter doesn’t think he minds very much. The only thing is all the hard places are poking up into his bum which doesn’t feel very nice, but if he complains about it now, his dad will probably turn around from the boxes he’s crouched in front of just to say “I told you so,” and Peter doesn’t want another half-hearted lecture.
When he opens his eyes, they fall on a stained piece of lined paper with a pen hanging around conveniently. Tony groans quietly, rubbing his eyes against the heel of his palm as he fights through his impulse and the exhaustion fueling it. It doesn’t take very much for him to think fuck it and straighten up to grab the offending piece of paper, draining the rest of his now cold coffee before putting pen to paper.
Tony should’ve found a way out by now. He’d gotten out of a cave in the middle of the Afghan desert with a box of scraps and a car battery hooked up to his heart, but somehow he couldn’t solve a fucking puzzle in order to get him and Steve out of this cabin.
“I ate already.” Steve retorted weakly, knowing that they’d sniff out the lie as soon as it had left his mouth.
“No worries, I will head out myself,” Thor starts to say, although he is interrupted by Tony and Steve both putting a stop to that thought, the memory of Thor returning with a small grocery bag full of Pop Tarts leading them all into a false sense of security before a fucking truck full of the things showed up an hour later, still too fresh in their minds.
Tony didn’t really know how to respond to that, frowning at the way Ty spoke of the dancers that suggested he viewed them as tools that he used to further his business. Tony thought that they looked to be the only people in the room who seemed to be truly alive.
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Yeah, we kinda got that from the whole mopey Steve situation you’ve got going on here,” he said, gesturing to the general vicinity of Steve’s apartment. “I’m gonna assume you tried to talk to him? Did he say anything?”
Stark watches them with a smug grin, self-satisfaction oozing out of his gaze. He uncrosses his legs and holds out his handcuffed wrist. “Is anyone going to help me out here? Hand’s getting a little sore, here.”
So Thor, being the ever considerate Asgardian that he was, had decided to spare them the effort and started sending people his most favoured moments of everyday, before he went to bed. Jane seemed to think it amusing, though curiously, Thor had stopped hearing from many others after he had started doing this.
Peter jumps up, grinning widely and makes his way around to his dad, shoving the piece of paper in his face. “You’ve gotta read this, Dad. It’s from someone named Tony and he talks about the Dodgers, which means he’s probably real cool and you’d like him,” Peter insists, shaking the letter impatiently until his father wipes off his hands on a towel and takes the paper from him. He watches as his dad’s eyes scan the letter, even chuckling at some parts.
He got up a little too abruptly, swaying in place as the blood rushed from his head. Steve rushed to help with a steady hand to his elbow. Tony smiled at him in thanks, an easy gesture that he didn’t even have to think about. He didn’t realize what it might’ve looked like to the team until he caught the look Natasha and Sam shared - worried and more than a little confused.
“How many of those do you think we got?” He asks, taking a glance at Peter, who seems to have discarded the letter and has moved onto another one.
Steve leans forward until their foreheads are pressed up against each other. “I love you, Tony. I go where you go, right?”
“JARVIS, turn on the radio for me?” Tony requests the AI, settling onto his stool and pulling up a holoscreen displaying an old schematic he’d been working on.
“You are a menace,” Tony told Dum-E, his wide grin betraying his true feelings towards the squirming bot completely. Dum-E withdrew from him as soon as he finished, rolling around Tony’s swivelly chair with absolutely no grace but with all of the excitement.
There was a small, rectangular island with two barstools precariously made of wood. The legs were thick, polished sticks that had been bound together in the traditional four-legged form with smaller pieces of wood running between the legs for additional support and what usually ended up being used as footrests from Steve’s experience. The seat looked to be a thin slab of lighter wood that had been attached on top.
Steve knew he deserved it. He was merely repenting for his wrongdoings by reliving the worst moment of his entire existence.
Clint watches her go with a smirk, crossing the room to flop down onto his bed as she turns the corner.
Tony’s mind races as he tries to piece everything together. The Captain taking off abruptly after someone called about his kid, the letter, and the meeting place. The kid lets go of his father’s hand, taking a step closer to Tony when he doesn’t respond.
Iron Man flinches outwardly, before catching Steve’s look of confusion aimed at him. “It physically pains me to see the destruction of good tech,” he says.
Bruce reaches out to enter his code into the holographic number pad that appears in front of the door’s handle. The keys emit a soft  aesthetically pleasing beep with every touch. He enters the last number, and waits for the tell-tale click, signalling that the door is unlocked.
“You trying to get this party started without me, Cap? I’m offended.” Tony quipped as he clomped up the steps himself. He muttered a command to JARVIS under his breath and the armour unfolded to let him step out of it. “Sentry mode,” he instructed, and Steve watched as the armour knitted itself back into one piece, its metal arms outstretched with the familiar blue of the glowing repulsors, as it slowly ran surveillance from one side to the other.
“Well, it’s my Dad, actually,” the kid says, his voice hesitant but oddly determined. “I think he needs a new wife.”
“Perhaps you need someone in your life just as much as Peter does,” the doctor suggests softly when Steve doesn’t offer any more of his own thoughts.
Pepper immediately turns to him with raised eyebrows and Tony flushes under her gaze. “How did you know that’s what they called him?”
“He’s with me,” Bucky supplied, wrapping an arm around Tony and pulling him closer to the group. Steve Rogers finally looked over at him, his golden hair sticking to his forehead and somehow not making him look like a drowned rat, his blue eyes guarded.
Thor arrives with his hammer blazing light into the skies, his vibrant red cape fluttering fiercely as he lands on both feet with Loki following close behind him. He grins widely at Steve, who gives him a hurried salute in greeting before he is forced to put up his shield once again to prevent himself from getting shot in the face with a laser beam.
“Don’t need one,” Steve mutters, gripping the ends of the cuffs with both hands and prying the metal apart. It falls away from Stark’s wrist easily, and Steve drops it to the ground. He looks up to find Stark looking up at him with his eyes blown dark.
So, twenty minutes later, Peter finds himself in Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, cradling MJ’s large pink piggy bank with change that he used to pay the cab driver and wearing an old Dora backpack with a bottle of water. He feels more than a little overwhelmed staring up at the tall, arching ceilings and the people walking fast to get wherever they need to go.
It took them a while to get used to the idea of what living the same day over and over again would entail. Every morning, the fridge would be restocked, regardless of what they’d consumed the day before. The cabin itself would undergo a daily reset. The coating of dust that every surface seemed to adorn when they’d first arrive would settle onto the counters, the little kitchen island, the TV, the toaster.
Steve places his hands on his hips and turns to face his son, who is perched contently on one of the bar stools at the kitchen island and sorting through a large stack of mail that the mailman had dropped off at their house earlier that morning with a curious look. Peter has a pair of scissors on the island in front of him to assist in breaking into the sealed envelopes, and he’s completely oblivious to Steve’s struggle as he sits with his socked feet kicking out every now and then.
Everyone issues a collective sigh at his remark, not even bothering to come up with a response. Thor pushes a heavily chained Loki in front of the portal, and Steve finds himself wincing to himself as he recalls their last explosive battle that had taken place as a result of Loki’s manic meddling. As such, he had been sentenced to life in exile from Asgard, although Thor had brought him back to take care of the portal, because he technically still owed them for the mess he had made earlier.
Ty grinned as he pulled Tony in closer to him, a too-large hand flimsily placed on Tony’s waist as he took the lead in a very butchered rendering of a mambo. Tony grimaced, looking around to see if he could make desperate eye contact with his mother and somehow pull off an escape.
Tony hears Steve sigh again, obviously reluctant to remain discussing his life story to this quack and to half the world listening in.
Tony would never admit it, but he’d fucking missed Steve. All that time he’d been on the run after the fight at the airport in Berlin, Tony hadn’t been able to stop worrying about him. He’d made damn sure that Ross wouldn’t get a hold of them despite knowing well enough that with Nat and Sam on Steve’s side, there wasn’t much else for Tony’s assistance to accomplish.
“Hello? Delphine, what’s going on? Is everything alright?” Steve asks, his thoughts from earlier completely pushed aside as worry plagues his mind instead.
Despite their careful planning involving the whole team, something that Steve didn’t recall them doing since their sceptre raids before everything with Ultron happened, he still worried. He knew that they had an advantage that the other teams hadn’t, in fact, they had multiple advantages, including an alien god who was probably more familiar with intergalactic activity than any of them, a genius in a metal suit with an entire arsenal of weaponry built into it, two supersoldiers, a Hulk, and three highly trained special op agents, one of whom also had a suit that allowed for flight.
“Hello, Peter. What seems to be the problem on this very late night for a young boy such as yourself,” comes the voice of Dr. Fieldstone.
Steve kind of tuned them out at some point, letting them figure out the logistics of his years on the run while he turned his focus to Dodger. He fed him some more pepperoni, but immediately felt guilty because he knew that he probably shouldn’t be feeding him pepperoni. So instead, he got up and grabbed Dodger’s food, the one with probiotics that Nat had gotten for him with the face of a giant wolf on the front of the package, proclaiming that it would satisfy the inner wolf of every dog. Steve thought that was a little weird, but grandiose proclamations of animal ancestry aside, Dodger loved the stuff so he figured it wasn’t too bad.
“Capiche,” Steve accepted weakly, recognizing that Tony had a point, despite the undercurrent of urgency that was making his leg bounce restlessly and his hands tremble where they were fisted on top of the kitchen island. They needed to take stock of their situation. If the shield and all of the tech Tony had in his suit hadn’t worked, then they were going to have to figure out another escape route. The team might not be in trouble at all. Nat had told them not to come, from what Steve was able to decipher in the short burst of her voice he was able to make out through the static.
“Asgardian gods aside,” she replied, her mouth quirked in that familiar smile of hers. She let go of the wrapper and covered Tony’s hand with her own, making him look up from the lettuce that he had now shredded into even tinier pieces. “We’re gonna be fine, Tony.”
Tony’s eyes were glued to the image of the young Asian woman. Xixi, according to the stats that ran underneath her picture. She was thirty years old, it said, lived in Manhattan and was an expert pilot and field medic. He looked at the image of a man next to hers, Kielan. Couldn’t be more than thirty-five, forty years old. Espionage agent.
“We have Hawkeye and the Wasp heading to the scene for backup, but I think you’re going to want to be the one to take these guys out,” Widow explains, her mouth setting in a grim line. “It seems to be an anti-super group. Probably figured it’d be too much trouble trying to abduct an actual superhero, so they took the next best thing.”
“Dad, it’s for you,” he says faintly, the phone too far away to pick up his voice clearly. “His name is Steve,” Peter whispers one last time to the viewers before the the phone is handed to his father.
The comms cut out entirely, not even leaving a stream of static for them to listen to. The window next to the fireplace suddenly flung open, the curtains billowing inward with the howling wind and a sheet of snow that pushed its way inside. The cold snaked down the neck of Steve’s suit, curling around his warm skin.
When he headed back to the cabin later that night, Tony laughed giddily to himself, feeling something big in his chest as he looked up at the moon and stars and remembered what it had felt like to be dancing with Steve, in his arms.
It was far from the first time he’d seen Steve after the whole definitely-not-fun debacle that had gone down in Siberia.
“Be good, Pete. I’m so sorry about this, you know I am, but I swear I’ll be back tonight for dinner.” Dad promises as he shuffles Peter into his new friend, MJ’s house. His card thing had started beeping at him again and his father had gotten a call from someone super secret and super important soon after. And now, Peter was being shipped off to MJ’s house until his dad finished with work, which he wasn’t entirely unhappy about. Maybe he could tell her about the letter from Tony.
Steve shrugged, clutching the bag of dog food closer to his chest defensively. “He still has it.” Bucky and Sam both turned to look at him incredulously.
“Did we ever replace the some more Pop Tarts, Captain?” Thor asks as he wanders into the kitchen, his big hands gently setting aside packages of Cheez-Its and cereal boxes with way too much sugar and not enough cereal that Tony and Natasha have an unhealthy affection for.
They dispersed after that, Sam going up to the helm to update Nat and Clint on what they’d just talked about, and Thor and Bruce hunkering down to work on some of the snacks from the decent-sized stash they’d managed to accumulate from missions over the years. Bucky came over after a while to sit next to Steve.
As Steve stood underneath the frigid stream of his shower, he felt the tight grip of familiar restless energy working through him as the urge to climb into that awaiting Quinjet and get the mission done and over with became harder to ignore. Instead, he scrubbed himself clean of the sweat and grime that had built up in a filthy layer over his skin during his time in the gym. When he stepped out of the shower, JARVIS asked him if he’d like to partake in the team breakfast that was in the makings in the team kitchen on the communal floor that they often gathered on. Steve knew that JARVIS always asked as a formality, but the team breakfasts had become a part of their collective pre-mission routine in the months after the Avengers who hadn’t previously signed the Accords, had returned.
Steve nodded slowly, looking away from Tony. His fork hung limply in his fingers, as he frowned at the front door which remained as stubbornly shut as it had been on day one.
His dad looks up from the bowl of cookie batter he’s been mixing, his brows creased in a confused frown. “What is it, Peter? You okay?”
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” Tony mumbled, embarrassed, barely managing to catch the woman’s absent smile before he was pulled into Ty’s fumbling grasp once again. Tony let himself be maneuvered in the not-quite fox-trot that they’re barely managing, Ty’s severely misplaced confidence almost funny as he tried to impress Tony by telling him that he’s going to Cornell for
As Tony had expected, the contents within the fridge were untouched. Including the carton of orange juice that he’d drank straight from behind Steve’s back when he’d begun to crave coffee the day before and the only thing closest to it that wasn’t water was the orange juice. Peering closely at it now, squinting his eyes until he could barely see, he noticed that the bright blue seal around the Sunny D was coiled around the lid, unbroken as it had been when they’d first arrived.
When Peter is finally alone with MJ, she brings out her deck of cards with 3-D pictures of spiders on the back that Peter really loves. They decide on “Go Fish” and while MJ is dealing out their cards, Peter fidgets with the folded piece of paper in the pocket of his sweater - the letter from Tony.
“You had my six when you literally told the government and like, the United fuckin’ Nations to suck your dick, so you better believe I’ve got your back right now.” Bucky insisted, shooting Steve an errant grin. “We told Fury to fuck himself, by the way. One less thing you gotta worry about.”
As the sun started dipping below the horizon and the bedroom turned dark, Steve would turn on the lamp on Tony’s nightstand, pause at the doorway, and then head into the kitchen where he would make dinner for two. He would come back with Tony’s plate which would be left untouched as the coffee but thankfully removed before Steve went to bed.
“Hey, you eat anything? They forgot to feed us,” Tony said, pushing his chair back and getting up from the table, running his hands through Steve’s hair out of habit as he goes. Steve went stiff underneath him and Tony jerked his hand away like he’d touched a flame. Steve’s head shot up, his bleary eyes tinged with a hint of desperation as he turned to look at Tony.
Tony looked up with a start when his stomach growled lowly. He’d forgotten to eat dinner at the gala amidst all the Steve drama. He pointed to U who was watching them curiously. “Wanna make me something good? Make sure it’s not bleach. Or motor oil. Even though I confiscated both from you last week. I feel like you’d find a way to poison me. Somehow.”
When Tony had looked up at Steve halfway through their meal and caught his questioning gaze, he unfortunately became very certain of one fact despite the overall uncertainty of their rather unfortunate situation.
Steve’s chest was pressed up against Tony’s back, his resting body a solid line of pure warmth behind him. He turned around, carefully repositioning himself in Steve’s arms so that he wouldn’t wake him. Tony’s breath caught in his chest at the sight of Steve’s pink lips, parted in sleep and with his breath passing through them in quiet huffs. His hair looked darker like this, in the barely there light of the early hours. It didn’t look ethereal or shine golden or frame his face like a fucking Botticelli. The ends which had been damp from the lengthy shower they’d shared the night before had dried sometime during the night to flop over Steve’s forehead.
“What if you went by yourself? And then your dad has to come looking for you, right? So, you could get to the Empire State and your dad will come find you and he’ll meet Tony,” MJ suggests tentatively.
Stark seems to shake himself, his face relaxing into an easy grin once again. “Nothing, Cap. Just, took you long enough to get here.”
Tony nods his head so hard he thinks it might actually fall off like Jarvis says it would if it wasn’t screwed onto his head. “I know so! It looks better than the stuff they have there.”
He’s only unpacked ten boxes so far, and he’d promised Steve that he’d find out where they’d put their dishes before he got back from the pizza place. Tony lifts open the flaps to the eleventh box stacked on top of several other similar boxes all over the living room floor.
And so, Tony worried and Steve grumbled and stomped throughout the cabin as he tried (and failed) to find a trap door exit or a latch on the windows that they’d missed the first two hundred and fifty times.
The closing of the portal itself is fairly anticlimactic in comparison with the rest of the battle. Loki raises some sort of scepter and begins to chant and the edges of the glowing portal start to shrink. The mass of Doombots start to power down and collapse to the debris-covered ground, and Steve seriously feels bad for the people who would be in charge of cleaning up their mess.
Ty pushed him back, making his feet trip over one another as his shoulder went careening into the back of the little old woman he’d seen earlier, sending her stumbling into the elderly man who Tony presumed was her husband.
Making dinner together became a thing for them after day twenty-two, and Tony found himself enjoying making dinner with Steve more than the eating part, which had both surprised and alarmed him. Steve also started making him breakfast because he somehow couldn’t break the habit of waking up at ungodly hours of the morning even though he was stuck in a time loop and time itself was a concept that was very quickly eluding Tony’s grasp.
It was on the 134th day 134, exactly one day more than the number of days Tony had spent in the cave before he’d gotten out, when everything started to go wrong.
He watches curiously as people continue to cross the street, passing in front of their car. There’s a very large group of girls wearing the same outfit, dark grey sweaters with a yellow knight embroidered on the chest, and then a really old lady follows with her hands braced against the handles of her walker as she pushes it across the street, and finally, a small family, the mom pushing a stroller that his dad tells him has a baby inside of it, the dad holding on tightly to a little kid’s hand and the long blue leash of a panting cocker spaniel wrapped around his free wrist.
Everything else faded away until it was just him and all the thoughts in his mind that never quite managed to cease in their intensity. Even when he was doing other, not tech or strings of equations related things. He vaguely registered the sounds of his bots doing their own thing and living their life, sometimes peering over his shoulder curiously when a particularly alarming crash sounded, but most times the sound of them rolling around beeping at each other fading into comforting background noise. JARVIS would murmur his input when Tony asked and sometimes when Tony didn’t ask. It was bliss. Tony never wanted it to stop.
“Cut those in halves, please,” he instructed, before turning back to his steak. Tony spent the next twenty minutes very carefully slicing the tomatoes in half, trying not to slice his own finger open in the process.
“Steve,” Tony called, softly. Steve looked up at him, catching the uncertainty and the concern that was written all over Tony’s face as clear as day just for a moment. “We’re going to get out of here. I promise.”
“So, I have some thoughts about the….thingy in the floor,” Tony said around a mouthful of mashed potatoes later that evening as they sat together at the half-cleared kitchen island, his hand that wasn’t currently maneuvering a fork gesticulating wildly in the air.
“I’m sorry, could we go back to the part where you said it took you a week to locate us?” Tony interrupted, his brain nearly short-circuiting at the team’s identical bewildered expressions.
Peter makes a face at the suggestion, clutching the letter to his chest. “Yuck, no, Dad! But we should go. What if Tony is the one,” he breathes, excited at the mere possibility.
He often finds himself thinking back to a conversation he had had with Captain America, after their fight with Obie had ended. Tony never really knew Obadiah at all, did he? The betrayal stung more than he’d have liked, and Tony hadn’t had a solid night’s sleep in a week.
Tony resumed his staring contest with the wall, both unfettered fear and rage waging a war against each other that resulted in the ceasefire of synapses in his brain. The feelings were so much — so much that Tony found himself feeling numb at the end of it all.
“Iron Man? Doing some late night surveillance?” Captain America asks, the kid at his side falling silent as he stares up at Tony inside of the armour in shock.
“Copy that,” Steve mutters, taking the rest of the cord from Widow and trying to find a foothold on the suit to get another EMP further up on the metallic limbs.
Steve sighs into the phone and Tony winces in his car, almost feeling the other man’s discomfort from the other side of the country.
“Alright, can we lay off my omelette, please? It’s not even terrible.” Tony interrupted, wincing when he merely succeeded in having several extremely dubious expressions swivelling his way. He slowly cut off a piece of it and placed it delicately into his mouth, his face completely blank as he swallowed.
Steve wished him goodnight with a tired smile and left the room as well, leaving Tony alone and still in his seat. He watched Steve go, feeling that familiar ache settle under his second rib, but not enough for him to get all maudlin about it. The urge to follow Steve into his room, the one with the light blue walls that Steve had painted himself and the white curtains that would gently billow into the room with the breeze when they had it open, surprisingly failed to interrupt his musings.
“Take this. SHIELD escort will take you to where Stark’s Identicard has been tracked. I’ll be instructing you through the comm, so you better not lose it, Captain.” She tells him, handing him a small, flesh-coloured device Steve would have to stick in his ear to keep contact with HQ.
Unfortunately, his frantically beating heart seems to have very different feelings about being trapped on top of a very tall building in the middle of New York City for the entire night.
“I won’t. I’m sorry,” Tony whispered back, bringing his arms up around Steve’s back and holding him close. The blanket slipped off his shoulders as they both crumbled to the ground, unwilling to let go of the other.
Tony didn’t want to give him that satisfaction. He still didn’t know why Steve hadn’t told him about his parents. Steve’s betrayal still stung like hell and the inevitable but brutal ripping apart of their relationship that had been a work in progress had made it that much harder to process.
Steve read The Hobbit to him on the evening of day 197. Tony’s eyes weighed heavy with exhaustion, but he still watched Steve as he did each hobbit’s voice differently and chuckled to himself when something particularly funny happened.
He really hadn’t meant to send that letter. He’d been very sleep-deprived and running solely on copious amounts of caffeine, and although that was often the formula to some of his best creations being made, this time it had produced very unwanted results in the form of a fan letter to a man he had heard on the goddamn radio. By the time he had been clear-headed enough to realize what he’d done, it wasn’t as if he could hack his way out of it. For some god awful reason, Tired Tony had decided to write a letter of all things, despite being the CEO of one of the nation’s leading tech companies. And so, there he was. Confronted with the fact that he had asked a complete stranger to meet him at the top of the Empire State Building on Valentine’s Day.
“I know. And we will,” Tony replied, his voice not betraying any of the fear that Steve knew he was really feeling. “We can’t get out of here. We are also panicking. Let’s get our asses in order, have some tea, etcetera. And then we’ll bust out of this hellhole. Capiche?”
Tony shook his head in the negative. “Just miles of trees, it looks like. I got JARVIS to run some scans as well, and nada,” he shrugged, shivering slightly as a sharp gust of wind accompanied the thickening snowfall.
Steve tried his comm once again, but to no avail. He slumped in the stool, burying his head in his hands, his exhausted mind rapidly filing through all the options they had, what could have gone so terribly wrong, how they could get in contact with the others. He barely noticed as Tonys strode back toward him, bustling past to flick on the light and then opening up cabinets and drawers.
“He had it on him last night. Saw him holding it when he was waiting for his drink at the bar,.” Steve said, thinking back to the immediate shock paired with the accompanying warmth that he’d felt when he’d realized that Tony had brought the stupid burner phone with him to the charity gala.
“You better not go squealin’ to Daddy about this, man,” Bucky warned him, even as he led Tony up the steep path to the house.
Steve had quickly become one of his best friends even before they had started dating, and during the course of their relationship, they’d always been friends first. Tony had never felt more comfortable with another person that he was also in love with. He’d learned that Steve was so much more than what the history books and Howard and taught him. Steve had the most nihilistic sense of humour that Tony assumed came with living through the Depression and cried during Disney movies and waved his fist angrily during baseball games when Tony had no clue what was going on and was horny to a fault. They laughed more often than fought, despite what everyone else including various sources of distrustful media saw.
Clint is looking more and more afraid by the second. He has his hands up at shoulder height in the universal ‘please don’t kill me’ gesture, although Steve isn’t sure how effective that would prove to be against the unforgiving force that was Angry Nat.
“You’re doing your best, man,” Bucky continued, and Steve knew that he was trying not to let the pity bleed into his voice, but he heard it anyway and despised that he was hearing it. “Stop blaming yourself for everything going to shit. You made the right call.”
“Uncle Bucky!” Peter shouts with glee, bounding past Steve to be lifted into a bear hug by Bucky. Smiling his own greeting, Steve pulls open the door wider to let his friend pass by.
“There’s nothing here, Cap. I’ve run multiple scans. No living or otherwise non-Earthly being is in here.” Tony told him from the doorway, stepping out of his suit. “J, sentry mode, please.” The armour accordingly complied, joints whirring as it strode toward the front door and stood facing it.
Obadiah’s betrayal had been one that Tony had not expected. After Pepper had warned him about Obadiah’s secret weapons dealings, Tony had looked into them and tried to stop him. When all else had failed, Tony had flown to the ravaged town of Gulmira where his own weapons were being used to kill thousands of innocent civilians. None of whom had ever asked to be in such a position. Tony had destroyed all of his weapons before he returned to the States, and Obadiah had evidently not been pleased with the turn of events.
They’d watched Wall-E on day 311 because neither of them had seen it before but Steve had put it on their watchlist right before the Accords had happened. Steve cried, which was entirely unsurprising. If Tony found himself to be a little misty-eyed over the animated movie, he was blaming Pixar and their insurmountable ability to evoke emotion.
Whatever this was, if their collective dramatics was being required, it wasn’t going to be a cakewalk. Naturally, Tony’s mind had immediately glommed onto the worst-case scenario: an extraterrestrial threat, and one they weren’t prepared to be able to handle this time around. Logically, he knew that if that was the case, then at the very least, Thor probably would’ve gotten a raven or something and Tony’s own complex intergalactic monitoring system would have caught on to it if the threat level was that high. Since neither of those things had happened, it was unlikely that he’d have to keep an eye on the sky for a potential spaceship landing in Times Square.
“It was a lot more familiar to us when we dug a little deeper,” Bruce continued, his troubled eyes behind his glasses turning to Steve and Thor almost apologetically. “The only time we’ve seen an energy source like this was- well, with the Tesseract.”
“Not,” Tony curtly replied, waiting for that scowl or for him to roll his eyes. “Are you wasting my time for a reason, Rogers?”
Steve spun him one last time, and Tony heard applause and cheers go up around the crowd as the song came to an end. When Tony managed to get his feet underneath him again, he opened his eyes to find that Steve was gone. He squashed the disappointment that rose within him and joined in on the cheering, absently feeling someone pat him on the back as he looked around, telling himself that he didn’t care where Steve had gone.
“Yes, Jane. Anyway, that’s one of them, but there’s more. If there’s lots of energy that’s kind of floating around there, it could be another infinity stone, you know,” Thor finished, looking at each of them expectantly.
They passed the 365 day mark, though neither of them acknowledged it verbally. They spent the day lounging in bed after Steve had generously woken Tony up with his mouth around his cock.
Huffing more loudly that he probably has to, Tony settles back onto his side of the bed (which was a lie because he always ended up in Steve’s side anyway). “Whoever taught you that wants to watch the world burn,” he mumbles petulantly as he turns exaggeratedly so his back is to Steve’s face, and smirks in satisfaction when he feels Steve roll over, arms slipping over Tony’s waist.
Dodger yipped, happy to be on the receiving end of all the attention as Steve took his face between his hands and gave him a good cuddle. Steve straightened again, sticking his hand through the loop of Dodger’s leash and wrapping it around his wrist a couple of times. He made a quick stop at the kitchen on his floor to grab the bottle of water he kept in the fridge for his runs and missions and stepped into the waiting elevator.
Steve dropped the bowl containing the remnants of the pancake batter onto the floor when Tony walked in, tugging his blanket over his shoulders as he peered into the frying pan curiously.
“Hey pal….yeah, hi,” Steve murmured, crouching down to get Dodger clipped onto his leash and smoothing his hand through the soft part of Dodger’s head, between his perked up ears. “I’m gonna be away for a bit, just like we talked about. Try not to shit on Jack for me,” Steve paused and frowned a little as he tried to figure out if Jack was indeed the name of the intern who had agreed (stood at parade rest the entire time Steve was talking to him and actually saluted him when he left) to take care of Dodger until Steve returned.
Peter rips open another envelope and according to the tally chart he’s made, this is the thirty-seventh letter of today. He’s expecting another one of the “I can make you happy, I can be the mother/father your child needs, yada yada” ones that Peter is quickly getting tired of. He saves the really good ones to show his dad later, but there aren’t a lot of them that stand out to him….in a good way.
“Thor, you may be onto something,” Tony said, his eyes transfixed to the additional screens that had floated up around him when Steve hadn’t been paying attention. “This source is clearly not from Earth. And if you’ve encountered two of these—infinity stones or whatever, then there could be more. We don’t know much, but this seems like our best bet.”
Bucky’s face was barely visible past the three, green oblong objects he was juggling in his arms, objects which Tony soon realized were watermelons. Bucky smiled when he saw him, but his brows quickly followed as he looked behind Tony’s shoulder at a faded sign that he’d passed by on his way.
“Widow, what’s your status?” Steve muttered through pants, watching as Tony aimed two of his shoulder missiles at the windows. “Widow, do you copy? Falcon? Buck? Is anyone there?”
Steve was not happy about having to work under SHIELD again. Half the reason behind why he’d stuck with them before they’d become aware that HYDRA had taken control was because Peggy had founded SHIELD, and Steve had believed that if she’d thought there was a cause for SHIELD’s existence, then he would continue to fight for that cause. After HYDRA’s takeover, however, Steve was even less sure of who to trust, let alone believe that the information he was receiving wasn’t only half the information that was known by officials, each with their own agenda.
As Iron Man began to propel forward in earnest, the body of the armour flattening out to become streamlined, Steve twisted in Tony’s grasp so that he was being held parallel to the armour. Steve felt the little footholds slide out from the armour and slotted his boots into them. In this position, Steve’s view consisted of the wide backdrop of the grey sky featuring the hardened face of Iron Man. He kept his eyes fixed where his gloved hand grasped Tony's shoulder, painfully aware of the fact that Tony could see his every move up close.
“Hey, baby, I’m back,” he murmurs into Steve’s neck, pressing close so Steve’s muscled back was right up against his chest.
That too, was apparently in vain. His father pays him no attention, or more likely, has heard Peter and is opting not to indulge in his antics. Peter pouts at the solid line of his dad’s back when he stands up with a hefty stack of books in both arms and makes his way over to where Peter is sitting.
“You got a hot date with the Captain or something?” Bruce asks tentatively, not wanting to set Tony off on a rant about things that Bruce did not need to be privy to.
It was almost overwhelming, to see all of that laid so bare for Tony to see. To see Steve be so vulnerable with him after months of boasting an emotional buffer between them.
“This was the movie you and Bruce decided to write a paper on the night after we got back from seeing it in the theatre, right?” Steve asked him, holding the DVD case up so Tony could see when he looked up from the wireless radio that he was in the process of reworking so they could receive signals.
“Jesus, are we on air? Peter, why--you’re supposed to be in bed, for God’s sake,” the man scolds, just barely in the phone’s reception.
Steve’s first mission when he’d gotten back was with Natasha and Tony. They’d all known that Nat was only there for purposes of the babysitting variety. Steve had honestly been grateful that she was there, because the tension between himself and Tony had been more than palpable throughout. There hadn’t been any intel to secure, or any recon. It had been a simple retrieval mission. SHIELD officers had been compromised during a routine recon mission investigating a former SI weapons warehouse where there had been signs of alien tech reported, and it was their job to get them back safely and determine whether the reports had been legit.
Tony took his seat in the chair next to Natasha, who moved her foot which had been propped up on it so he could sit. His eyes made the cursory pass over everyone in the room: Wilson, Bruce, who was grinning at something Thor was muttering to him, Nat, Clint, still looking upset about the donuts, Barnes, who looked half-asleep, and finally, Steve, who had his yellow legal pad out in front of him and a pen gripped tightly in his hand. Tony knew he wasn’t actually taking notes. Or, he would try to but it wouldn’t be long before the drivel turned into a funky little doodle of Natasha with a donut for a head, or something equally ridiculous for the sole purpose of making Tony laugh.
When U whirred indignantly, Tony grinned and put his hands up defensively. “Hey, I’m kidding! Not really though, because you have put motor oil into my smoothies on more than one occasion, bud.”
However, none of his attempts at communicating with anyone outside of the cabin managed to work. He’d tried to pair his tech with the wireless and the antennae of the TV to see if he could reach one of SI’s satellites as a last resort which had ended in a grand failure as well.
“We don’t know exactly,” Fury revealed, obviously reluctant to share how they’d probably severely underestimated this for what it was. “Geometric data was off, satellites shutting down, no contact from anybody in nearby towns for weeks that went unreported. Kind of clued us off that something was going on.”
Bucky stops him by putting up a hand. “I’m just saying. You’re the one who said so yourself that you’re lonely,” he points out unhelpfully. “It’s been two years, Steve. Maybe you should think of moving on.”
Tony found himself wishing he had declined the stupid, gold-fringed invite that he had placed on his coffee table and forgotten about for a month after it had gotten buried under piles of cute works of art featuring Iron Man and his small adoring fans, before Pepper had rolled her eyes at him over lunch two days ago and asked him what he was planning on wearing. Tony had found himself replying with “obviously my new checked Tom Ford Prince of Wales” before he had paused to consider where he was going donned in his new checked Tom Ford Prince of Wales.
“If by refined you mean senior citizens, then yes, your taste in men is indeed very refined,” Steve said with a wide grin, finally managing to press play and lifting up to join Tony on the couch. Tony obediently lifted one corner of the blanket so Steve could slide inside, his eyes fixed on the screen as the main menu popped up with the familiar opening of Hans Zimmer’s extraordinary soundtrack.
He does one final loop around the city, this time heading towards the dreaded building he had been avoiding all night, telling himself that if no one is up there then he will head right back home, no waiting around, although he’s sure he’d probably end up breaking that promise to himself before the night is up.
Steve turned his head so that he was facing Tony while still slumped over the table. “Try finding out that your future self used a fucking Infinity Stone to get you back with your ex to save his life by trapping you both in a time-warping illusion.”
He felt like him and his parents and the elderly couple he’d bumped into and Mr. Stone, they were all like the undead. Kind of moaning and groaning around the streets with their grey and blistering arms stretched out in front of them. The dancers though—they looked like people. They looked like every prince that Tony had dreamed about marrying from his books and the princesses they’d dance with at the spectacular balls, where no one else mattered. Tony desperately wanted to be like that. He wanted to live like that.
“Jane Foster?” Bruce asked, his voice gaining pitch at the end as his face scrunched up in confusion.
Their answer lay underneath the nightstand, which Steve had upturned after apparently having a similar thought. The bottom of it had deep grooves carved into the wood, perfectly allowing the dials to slot within them.
“It feels weird, right?” Thor asked Steve, the rumble of his accented voice almost too low for Steve to catch amidst the deep hum of the jet’s engines.
Bruce sighs and slides down the door, having resigned himself to spending the night up on the roof. Hey, maybe he can actually catch sight of the meteor shower.
Tony held out his hand, palm facing the ceiling and Steve’s grew wide in realization. He didn’t hesitate in moving forward and placing his hand in Tony’s, pulling him up and off the couch. Steve didn’t let go of his hand as they made it into the bedroom, only letting him go to slip underneath the covers and into bed in the empty space next to Tony’s side.
Steve had foregone his usual early morning run for a quick workout down in the gym, falling into the familiar rhythm of his pre-mission routine. He’d spent a little while with the bags and then he had moved on to working with the weights for the remainder of the hour that he’d allocated for himself before going back up to get ready. The thought of their upcoming mission weighed heavily on Steve’s mind throughout his routine. Despite Tony having thoroughly….looked into SHIELD’s classified servers that none of them would normally have clearance to access, the intel that Fury had provided them seemed to be all that SHIELD had on the operation.
Tony also knew that the plan was less for Steve’s own personal wellbeing and more to reassure him about the wellbeing of the people he cared about, every single one of whom would be on this mission. It was one of those things that Tony was initially messed up about when they’d first started dating and Steve would walk into a mission with a singular goal in mind and everything else made up on a whim. When he was partnered with Tony, he would always have a plan of action going in, but he would never be overbearing on the field, which was something that Tony had always appreciated and tried his best to reciprocate on.
Just as he’s given up all hope and accepted his fate of driving to the enthusiastic renditions of “tell me whatchu want, whatchu really really want,” he lands on a late night interview. He has high hopes for it, because the interviews that are on at two in the morning are usually the ones meant for truckers or insomniacs, and he finds out that he’s partially right when it’s revealed they are listening to an interview with relationship therapist, Dr. Fieldstone something-he-can’t-quite-catch.
Peter rolls his eyes. “I’m not trying to cheat, I’m not stupid, MJ. But I have to tell you something.”
There was a small wooden nightstand on either side of the bed, identical in shape and size. They looked to be made of the same polished wood as the other furniture they had encountered. They also each had an identical lamp sitting atop their surface. Each wall to the left and right of the bed had windows, Steve noticed belatedly. The room was so dark because the windows had been covered with thicker curtains that the ones used to cover the two smaller windows in the other room. Pushed up against the wall where the door was, a large wardrobe sat, this one made of a darker wood than the other furniture.
It was built into the floor, ten rotating dials with different letters of the alphabet on their faces. Another series of dials formed a second row just underneath the first, identical except instead of letters, they had numbers from zero to nine on each face. There were five rows in total, the dials of each alternating between letters and numbers and completely hidden from view by the bulk of the nightstand.
Steve rushes forward, leaving behind the other Avengers who have occupied themselves with rescuing any remaining civilians who might have been caught in the crossfire. He kneels down carefully next to Iron Man, who remains seated on the ground, his armoured face revealing nothing.
He practically skips into the room, his mouth open and ready with a dirty quip, when he abruptly comes to a stop halfway in, his forehead creased with the beginnings of a frown.
Tony squinted at the cover, his eyes widening at the sight of Matthew McConaughey ensconced in a white spacesuit with the backdrop of a purple-ish galaxy.
“Sweetheart, you have got to know that this isn’t your fault, okay? If that man cannot appreciate what’s right in front of him, then why do you gotta worry? You’ve got your whole life ahead of you, and you cannot let this man decide what’s to come of that,” is Dr. Fieldstone’s very vague but enthusiastic response to the woman’s lament.
“Look, I’m sorry but I never got any reports, I swear,” Clint insists, turning his fearful gaze helplessly towards Tony who shrugs, sporting a grin Steve knows he isn’t even trying to conceal.
“Alright, that’s enough. This is making me sad, man,” Sam ripped the blanket off of Steve, leaving him cold and pouting up at him. “Oh wow, look at that. Is Captain America gonna throw a tantrum?”
All of it was proof enough that someone had prepared for the two of them specifically to be trapped in here. During one of his more delirious existential dread ignoring tinkering sessions where he’d relegated the bed to Steve for the night, Tony had found himself giggling at the thought of some alien playing matchmaker as the thought of Steve sleeping in the room with the condoms and lube popped into his mind unprompted.
“MIT,” Tony answered, watching the shift in Ty’s expression with a sort of self-satisfaction that he’d been thriving off of every time one of his parents’ friends asked him where he was going next year. Ty’s face smoothed out again, that slick smile taking familiar residence on his face as he probably figured that Tony was majoring in something like
Steve’s shield is a little ways off, leaning nicely up against the wall beside the TV and always in his line of sight, no matter how many times Tony shifts them from his spot snuggled up into Steve’s side. Clint has his bow slung over the back of the couch and his portable arrows safely inside of the little pouch Tony had made to go with them. There had been fanny pack jokes for weeks after Tony had first given Clint the portable explosive arrows in the small bag that strapped around his waist, but after they’d gotten ambushed by those tiny bots in Central Park and Clint was the only one who had had a weapon on him, the jokes had abruptly come to a stop.
He would usually spend the rest of the night hunched over the toilet afterwards, heaving every time the unwelcome image of Tony’s bloody look of horror as he flinched away from Steve viciously bringing the shield down, entered his mind.
He had found himself desperately missing those missions where the six of them would be off doing their own thing, but amidst the harsh pants and the background sounds of battle would be an abundance of commentary thrown around between them, never failing to lift his spirits or give him that extra ounce of motivation to fling his shield at someone’s neck. But Steve would take curt and professional if it meant that he’d get to work with Tony again.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest and watched him. “Maybe something was in here, sure. But no surprises, Cap. Trust me, there’s nothing in here that J wouldn’t have caught.”
Pepper places her hand over his, weaving their fingers together in a gesture of comfort. “I know you will.”
“Be careful, Tony. Don’t fly out too far, we don’t know what’s out there,” Steve reminded him, finishing up his own perimeter check of the west side of the clearing. He was expecting a snarky retort about how Tony hadn’t signed up to be mothered, but the only reply he got was a curt affirmative acknowledging his warning.
“Clearly, Stark Industries has the superior tech. Doom’s tech could never compete, of course, but still, it’s good tech gone to waste,” Iron Man replies with a deeply put upon sigh.
Bruce can’t help the fond smile as he once again bends down to peer through the eyepiece of his own telescope, turning the knob of the focuser only slightly so that the image of the night skies projected to him are a bit more sharp. By now, he’s gotten so used to Tony’s presence that his antics have become more amusing and sometimes even endearing rather than annoying.
“What? Why are you looking at the orange juice like that?” Steve questioned a little frantically, holding the fridge door open so that it wouldn’t close on Tony.
Sam grinned and rolled his eyes, flipping open the lid of one of the boxes that Bucky and Steve had already begun to demolish and ripping apart his own slice of cheese pizza. “Oh, now he asks. It was just your everyday beat up the bogeyman and get back the goods, except the bogeyman was a middle-aged John Smith whose best bud had bought his law firm from him.”
“So what are you saying? It’s a trick of some sort?” Steve asked, his forehead crinkling in that way it did whenever he was confused about something and was annoyed about it. Tony swallowed and looked down at his food to avoid reaching over the table and smoothing out the wrinkled skin.
Tony chuckles wetly, watching the way Steve’s very blue eyes caught the shine of the Christmas lights they’d strung up as soon as they’d arrived in the morning even though it was the middle of July, because they could. This was their home now.
Hey everyone! I hope you're enjoying this so far! I will be updating fairly consistently, every Monday, although I have my two finals coming up in the next few weeks, but I will try my very best to keep updating. Also, a gentle reminder that if you're enjoying this story, I would really appreciate if you left kudos and comments, mostly because I crave validation but also because they genuinely motivate me to keep writing!
He stared down at his half-finished fries and then glanced across the table where Clint was making eyes at them. Tony pushed his fries over, rolling his eyes fondly when Clint got his grubby paws all over them, barely pausing for breath as he inhaled the now sad and soggy fries. Natasha looked on with her eyebrows raised and Tony shrugged, before she opened her mouth in a wide yawn, proving that even scary spider assassin people got tired sometimes.
“Sorry,” he muttered, voice muffled by Tony’s shirt. Tony’s hand which had been buried in his damp hair, softly rubbing the back of his head, immediately stilled at the apology.
Steve jerks awake with a groan, and Tony is so afraid for the guy who decided to debut his criminal lifestyle during Captain America’s after hours, because those hands really are gonna start flying and very soon.
“The whole thing’s been blowing up all morning. People are writing to him, can you believe that?” She gesticulates, throwing her hands up in the air. Pepper waits for a response from him, but Tony keeps his gaze resolutely fixed on the polished mahogany of his desk.
“Uh, my brain kind of just shuts down when you do that so I don’t really have a response for your right now,” Tony mumbles a little breathily, tilting his head back to give Steve more access.
They all meet on their way to the roof, which is where the alert had originated according to a very amused JARVIS. Natasha’s still wearing her kitten pajamas, but has two pistols in each hand, and has somehow managed to strap on a holster onto her bare arm, her knives safely tucked into it. Steve looks alarmingly similar to a grumpy old guy who has just been awoken from his afternoon nap. Clint is smirking, although no one wants to know why, Thor is looking murderous, and Tony is truly feeling the dread as he aims his repulsors at the door leading up to the roof.
“Always,” Steve replied with a smile of his own, the familiar words rolling over his tongue like a soothing salve.
Tony wishes he could also do whatever he wants to do when he’s a grown-up. He wants to be a butler like Jarvis and help people do things in their homes, but he doesn’t think his Dad would like that very much.
Buster ventured too close to the fireplace the next day, and he wasn’t replaced the day after during the cabin’s daily reset.
This kitchen didn’t have a proper island and everything was made of metal. Tony wondered why he’d liked the gleaming steel and pristine marble countertops so much. It was all so blinding.
He smiles down at him, wrapping his arms around Tony’s middle. “I thought we were going to take this party upstairs,” Steve murmurs, nosing down Tony’s jaw.
Day 22 was nice because that was when Steve had relented and allowed them access to all the food that was available to them after having painstakingly gone through every item on its own. That night, Steve left Tony to tinker at the kitchen island and cooked them dinner. Tony had stopped halfway through rewiring his helmet and watched with an ache in his heart as Steve carefully toasted the garlic bread, thawed and marinated the steak, and prepared the ingredients for a salad. He was humming a song that Tony had heard him sing to himself hundreds of times when he’d shower after coming home from his morning run and kissing Tony good morning or when he was sitting on the worn couch they’d dragged down to Tony’s workshop, sketching in the leather-bound sketchbook Tony had got him for his birthday.
“You got it,” Tony nods as Bruce makes his way out of the kitchen. “I’ve got some unfinished business with this one though, so--”
Bucky scoffs, shaking his head before reaching past Steve to place a package of macaroni into the pantry. “How do I know? The question you should be asking is who doesn’t know, Steve,” he says, casting a quick glance at Peter. “At least, everyone in this town knows it’s you. And I could recognize your voice anywhere, Steve, who do you take me for?”
The boy’s mouth twists up as he also thinks about this. He shrugs. “I dunno,” he says, not looking bothered by the fact that he’s going to be at school for so many hours. “Hey, wanna go play Legos after?”
After the fight with Obadiah and his poorly engineered suit, Tony had been harassed with the recurring nightmare of his longtime mentor forcibly removing the one thing that Tony needed in order to survive right in front of him. Of course, this wasn’t how he had actually acquired the reactor. Obadiah had merely broken into Tony’s lab and found one of the earlier versions of his reactor that he had used in his own suit with poor results.
“Hey, kiddo. What’ve you been up to?” Bucky asks, following Peter into the kitchen as he starts chattering about all the mail they’ve got and how he’s been helping Steve sort them out.
“I know him,” is all Iron Man says, his voice cracking on the last syllable. “Guess I didn’t really.”
“I dunno,” the boy says, squinting his eyes at the clock like he was making it tell him what time it was. “My Ma said the bell rings at 3 o’clock and then all the parents come and get us.”
“So, how long has it been since your wife died, Steve?” Dr. Fieldstone asks, her voice laced with an exaggerated sense of gentile that was a common quality of all therapists it seemed.
To their left was the kitchenette, with again, more surprisingly modern appliances. The cabinets were made of a similar dark, polished wood as the kitchen island, with the same material used for the countertops. There was a sleek, metallic oven, not unlike the ones that they had back at the Tower, and a similar refrigerator that was slightly smaller than the one Steve had in his own kitchen on his floor. Cabinets had also been attached to the upper walls, some of them with a window on their doors displaying the plates and dishes that were apparently sitting inside. There was a thick layer of dust on every surface in the room.
One day, he’d come back to the Tower which didn’t feel like home anymore, after several meetings and a predictably frustrating and terse phone call with Ross, and he had completely forgotten that Steve was gone. Tony had collapsed under the grief and feeling of loss for the one source of constant happiness in his life that he should’ve done more to protect, and it had taken a very long Skype call with an ever so patient Pepper to abate the pain for a while.
“Can’t see shit in here,” Tony said in explanation as Steve flushed with embarrassment and sheepishly turned back around to face the inside of the bedroom. “Guess nobody’s home.”
“I’m worried about him and he’s worried about me and my uncle’s worried about the both of us,” the kid replies, and Tony has to laugh again at his response. “I bike to school and my dad follows me in his car like I don’t know he’s there. And now, he’s started a new job and everything and you know what happens--”
On the third day, Tony beckoned Steve over to the kitchen island and gave him a small task to do. It was just prying apart various plates on his armour that he hadn’t quite managed to do with his tiny screwdriver, but the grateful look Steve had sent him as he’d sat down across from him had been everything. And also nothing at all, because Tony was more than aware of the towering pile of issues with a capital ‘I’ that they were both sitting on.
Tony bounds out of the elevator before the doors fully slide open, toeing off his shoes and running his fingers through his hair as he makes his way through the penthouse suite in search of his bedroom. His mind is rapidly gathering with filthy, filthy thoughts, all of which include a very naked Steve Rogers in his very big bed.
“It’s just a timeframe, yeah, yeah,” Tony interrupts, hand coming down to adjust the mount of his own telescope without his eyes leaving the eyepiece.
Tony finds himself feeling entirely entranced by the man’s words, and is shaken when the doctor interrupts them with an announcement of wrapping up the show for the night.
“Yes. Okay? This is my stress omelette. Are you happy now, Nat? It sucks. I’m gonna end up feeding it to Steve’s dog. Can we just, shut up about it please?” Tony said, all in one breath, looking around the table defiantly despite the giggles that everyone was trying really hard to suppress for his ego's benefit.
“Steve,” Bucky called out, and that’s when Steve noticed that the room had gone silent while he had been preoccupied with moping all over Dodger, who didn’t really seem to give a shit anyway. He looked up at Bucky and Sam’s twin expressions of pity and tore his gaze away. It was like rubbing salt in his gaping, sore wound that had stuck around for months while everyone else had managed to heal somehow. He seemed to be the one who was always left behind.
But then he thinks about how sad his dad looks all the time and he tells himself that the solution lies just one plane ride away. If he can do this, his dad could be happy again. So Peter walks up to a security guard and pokes at his elbow.
“People start calling crackpot doctors on the radio?” Tony wonders out loud, nearly missing the kid’s response.
The clock was slowly inching on its way to two o’clock, and Tony quietly giggled half to himself when he recalled Fury’s earlier statement about getting enough rest. Yeah, that wasn’t happening.
“Yes, but it could also take us days. Minutes, if I can come up with a suitable algorithm, or even less if we end up figuring it out by chance,” Tony explained. “Point is, it’s a game of luck. Also math and statistics. It just doesn’t seem in character with whatever fuck is keeping us here.”
There had been the question of whether the information given to them was accurate or if there was more that SHIELD wasn’t giving them, but Tony had quickly put those worries to rest by hacking into SHIELD’s most classified servers. The data that they’d been given was everything SHIELD had complied and received from the two teams that had been sent to investigate the source of the anomalies.
“You too?” Tony asked, pulling out the chair next to him and waving Steve over. Steve shuffled over and slumped down into the chair as soon as he reached it. He leant forward and buried his face into his arms on the table.
Steve tears his gaze from Stark’s, his heart still beating frantically away underneath the uniform and his hands sweating in his leather gloves. The Wasp looks at them from the doorway they had blasted open just minutes earlier, a knowing glint in her eyes as she gestures outside.
Tony still kind of felt like he was living in his 10-year-old self’s dream sometimes. But then Steve would stop by his dorm room with takeout from their favourite Thai restaurant at the end of a long day or Tony would catch him talking to DUM-E softly when he thought Tony was still asleep, and he doesn’t think that even his 10-year-old self could come up with a dream so perfect.
Tony knew that the Avengers were usually invited to these things, and although Tony was mostly the one elected out of the group to attend, some of the others joined him from time to time. Of course, before everything had happened, it had been him and Steve attending together. Before Steve, Tony would be flanked by a ragged group of superheroes that cleaned up surprisingly well, and before all of that, he had gone alone.
“It reminds me of when I lost my Ma,” Steve said, an errant muscle in his jaw jumping as he turned back to look at Tony. “I lost her for the first time when she passed and the second time when I forgot what she looked like. I got this family when I woke up in the future and— I can’t lose them too.”
Steve nodded, looking away from Tony as if he was embarrassed. “It wasn’t really like that with Bucky. When I went into the ice, I’d only lost him the day before. And when I woke up here….there were photographs and those reels from the war. Then we found him so soon.”
“Yes, Tony, it took us three hours to find our way out of the town and then we went back to the Tower after seeing no signs of you or Steve,” Bruce explained, looking them over with a critical eye. “We were planning on contacting Strange or Richards but—” He trailed off and looked to the side, apparently noticing the dirty dishes in the sink for the first time. “You two have been here for way longer than a week.”
Upon later investigation of said gold-fringed invite buried under works of art from small people (“Pep, you don’t understand, these should seriously be put up in a gallery or something!”) was a charity benefit for the children’s hospital. Tony knew he would have felt like dog shit, and been the equivalent of actual dog shit if he had declined the invite, but he was beginning to feel a certain kinship to dog shit anyway.
He left Dodger with the intern (who was indeed named Jack) and made his way back up the private elevator that led to the Avengers’ common floor, where the others were probably just beginning to trickle in. To his surprise, Steve ended up walking into a scene straight out of the McCallister’s household just before leaving for their Christmas vacation (and consequently abandoning their youngest child).
Thor’s frown deepened as he regarded them. “Like, the infinity stones? Thanos is after them, yada yada, big, purple guy in the chair?”
A holographic screen popped up behind him, the focal point of the image briefly obstructed by Fury as he made a second pass on his attempt to pace through the carpeted floor of the conference room. When he finally moved away, Tony was able to make out six profiles; three men and three women, all of whom looked to be SHIELD agents. Tony’s speculation was confirmed by Natasha’s quiet intake of breath that suggested she knew someone up on that screen.
Tony lands on top of the observation deck of the Empire State Building not stepping out of his armour, but giving it a cursory glance before powering up his repulsors to set off once again.
“Mechanical engineering. I’m gonna take over my dad’s company one day,” Tony told him, before he immediately wants to shove the words back into his mouth. Ty’s smirk gets wider at that, somehow managing to look down on Tony despite being several inches shorter than him.
The blue light from Tony’s repulsors illuminated the room they were standing in, revealing a kitchenette leading into a seating area with surprisingly modern furnishings, from what limited knowledge Steve had in his arsenal about interior design in the twenty-first century.
Steve starts running to the portal, although he’s at least seven blocks away. Thor was supposed to have come back with Loki by now, with a solution to their little problem, but there is no sign of the god’s imminent arrival. He hears a familiar whine of repulsors and two successive blasts behind him.
On day 229, Tony woke up before Steve. The bedroom was still dark, the bright blue of the sky right outside of the window the only sign of the fast approaching dawn.
Bruce waved at the screen with his pen. “Tony and I traced the energy to this cabin, which wasn’t there before SHIELD started registering the anomalies.”
“Widow? What’s your status?” Steve queried, looking up to share a worried glance with Tony when all they got in response was the sound of static.
Curious, Tony began to make his way up the hill that led away from their cabin, when he saw Bucky Barnes, the boy who’d helped them bring their luggage up when they had first driven into the resort in the morning.
“All due respect sir, no. We’re in position waiting for Widow’s call. Returning now would be futile,” Steve explains, his voice a murmur as he signals to Hawkeye who is crouched up on the roof of the two-storey building behind him.
“I would’ve done it too,” Steve spoke into the silence that followed. “If I—if I ever lost you, I wouldn’t know what to do with myself. I feel sorry for him.”
This flight wasn’t anything like that first one. Steve didn’t think for a second that Tony would drop him or anything, he felt just as secure as ever held within the firm grasp of Iron Man. But nothing else felt the same. Despite there being very little physical space between them, Steve felt very removed from Tony in a way that he hadn't felt in a long time.
Tony purses his lips, a trembling hand settling over the dim blue glow of the arc reactor set into the hold carved that had been carved into his chest. “I have to stop him.”
“The air is a bit off. It actually reminds me of one time when I was younger, and my brother transformed himself into a little bat, because he knows how much I love bats, and as I went to admire it, he transformed back into himself and stabbed me,” Thor explained, earning an incredulous look from Tony and a “Seriously, again?” from an equally incredulous looking Bruce.
“Oh, well when you say it like that, what choice do I have but to believe you,” Tony countered with a huff, smirking when Nat rolled her eyes at him.
He climbed up the steps, hearing the wood creak underneath his weight. Steve heard the soft whine of Tony’s repulsors as he presumably returned into the clearing.
Tony swallowed past the lump that had quickly formed in his throat. Once, twice, and then once again when his chin began to tremble. He shuffled toward Steve, his eyes never leaving Tony’s, and lifted his head to rest it on Steve’s chest, just like he’d done so many nights before. Tony felt more than heard Steve’s breath hitch as he went stiff under him. It was only a moment though, before Steve so very gently brought his arm up around Tony, holding him close.
Tony returns to the screen, fingers poking and prodding at the rotating digital blueprint as he looks for things he can make better. When he tunes out again, he hears the soft, familiar voice of Dr. Crackpot through the speakers. He frowns and returns his attention to his AI.
want to deal with this. He whirled around to place the glass back atop the counter that had been digging into his back and shoved a fifty into the fancy tip mason jar before curtailing it out of there.
Steve rolls his eyes, but pulls out Tony’s blue mug with a faded image of his shield on the side before starting up the coffee machine. Steve waits for the coffee to finish brewing, leaning against the counter and listening to the quiet gurgles from the pot.
“I’m here. You’re okay. We’re gonna be okay,” Tony murmured softly, hugging Steve closer to his chest. Steve’s vision slowly began to clear, his gasping breaths easing out and leaving him behind with a feeling of being unwell, tremors running their course through his body even as he returned to himself. He realized that Tony was holding him. Blinking away the prick in his eyes, Steve buried his face into Tony’s soft shoulder.
“I’m going to check this room out a little more,” Steve said, already making his way inside. “Make sure we really are the only ones in here.”
“Who’s that?” Tony found himself asking, his eyes glued to the way the man drew the woman into his chest with a simple spin, before pushing her out, arms tucked in close to her body and red skirt flaring out like an eruption of fleeting flames arching into the sky.
“But why do you have to go anyway,” Peter whines plaintively from the pile of blankets he’s surrounded himself in. He clutches the copy of “The Sorcerer’s Stone” that Bucky had bought for him for his birthday to his chest, and pouts up at Steve as he stands at the foot of Peter’s bed wearing what he hopes is a stern frown on his face.
Widow gets to her feet, the Widow Bites on her wrist crackling with electricity as she eyes the chaos around them. “He should be here any minute now. We can’t do anything about the portal until they get here. Until then, we’ve got to keep the bots here, away from the city.”
“You know what? Fine. I’ll go have a look at my desk. But you’re going to be swallowing your words, Barton,” she sighs, and drops the pile of candy wrappers she had been picking out of some files.
Further down was an arrangement of plush, brown armchairs set so they were facing each other from opposing sides of the faded, rectangular Oriental rug. With its back facing the door, a similar plush loveseat sat facing a charred, stone fireplace. Further down, Steve was able to just make out a door that was ajar, a dark sliver the only thing from inside the room that was visible.
Today, Tony stayed. He watched Steve rinse and dry their mugs, turn off the kitchen lights. Steve walked back to the couch with a confused frown to see Tony still sitting on the couch where he’d left him.
“It’s still a threat,” Tony said, nodding at Bruce. “If this Thanos guy is really after it, who’s to say he’s not on our tail right now? It could be a plant to get us there.”
“I’m a pretty lucky guy, Stark,” Steve murmurs. He’s not even sure whether they’re still talking about Stark’s unexpected escape from the anti-super gang, but he decides he’s okay with that. More than okay with it, actually.
“Yes,” comes the reply. Peter seems to be very focused on reading a particularly long letter, no doubt addressed to Steve after the ill-advised exchange he’d had on a radio show.
“We’re still going to try. I don’t care if it’s some sick extraterrestrial joke or if it’ll lead us somewhere worse than this, but we need to try,” Steve said, his jaw set stubbornly as he stared at the door. He looked at Tony then, that familiar steadfast determination carried in his eyes that Tony himself relied on so often.
By some miracle upon miracle, Tony endured an evening of being shoved into a trick box by a red-faced “magician” who sawed him in “half” to the gasps and thrilled applause of the people gathered for games. He managed to smile weakly when Mr. Stone showed up again to tell him how much of a “good sport” he was, and just barely escaped his father’s call for him to join the game of poker that Howard and some of his friends were starting.
Steve bids the team goodbye and heads towards the code-encrypted elevators that would lead him to his quarters. He was desperately in need of a shower before he could finally head back home to his son.
“Would it be too much for me to ask for some help with the groceries?” Steve asks, already knowing what the answer’s going to be.
Thor slips off the bed and pads barefoot into the empty living space on his floor. The eerie sound gets louder the further he travels into the room, and Thor grips the handle of Mjolnir tightly in anticipation.
Tony winces, feeling his heart break for the kid. He knows all too well what it was like to deal with losing parents, and though he hadn’t been quite so young when his own had died, he recalls quite clearly the effect it had had on majority of his adult life. And being left a multi-billion dollar company to run during that whole mess hadn’t exactly been an easy ride.
Bucky sighed, sharing a look with Sam. Steve put his head back down, closing his eyes for just a second. They had a Look now. Steve knew that SHIELD had finally agreed to let Bucky work missions, after his extensive psychological reprogramming in Wakanda courtesy of Shuri, and the stint with the BARF tech that Tony had let them use. While Steve had been on a SHIELD ordered sabbatical of sorts, the others had been running missions for the whole month after they’d been allowed back on American soil. While Steve had spent his month off mostly moping and spending time with the dog Natasha had got him “for the depression,” Bucky and Sam had been running missions together week after week. Steve wasn’t entirely convinced that they couldn’t somehow read each other's minds. For two people who could barely stand each other less than a year ago, they worked better together on the field than any other pair Steve had seen.
It was nearly three in the morning and Tony found himself in the kitchen, staring at the stainless steel refrigerator with a sort of disappointment. It wasn’t their fridge.
The number pad glows red, and a string of words run past on the narrow screen, telling Bruce that he has been denied access. He re-enters his code, figuring he must’ve made a mistake in his tired haste. The holographic pad glows red once again.
He arrived at the Tower fifteen minutes later, twenty-five minutes late to the meeting. However, he had most definitely made the right call re: donuts, because as he walked into a roomful of pissed off Avengers, the sight of donuts instantly turned a good eighty percent of those frowns completely upside down. Wilson stretched out his arms as soon as Tony stepped into the room, his hand making grabby motions that Tony had only previously encountered in tiny, fat toddlers and himself at the sight of freshly brewed coffee after a bender in the workshop.
Tony grabs his drink and steps into the awaiting elevator, keying in his code that would allow him entrance into his workshop at the basement of the building. He lifts his mug up to his lips, swallowing the burning coffee even as it bruises his esophagus painfully as it goes down.
He looked more alert than everyone else in the room combined, his focus on the pan in front of him as he flipped over the edge of what looked to be an omelette. Steve cringed as the charred backside of the egg was revealed, causing Tony to scowl at his pan as if it had personally wronged him. He was also in his black flight suit, covered in the armour from his waist down with his left hand ensconced within the gauntlet. Steve tore his gaze away from the curve of Tony’s back that was unnecessarily accentuated as the flight suit bled into the red and gold metallic plates of the Iron Man armour.
“What if something left us a not so nice housewarming surprise from space and then left?” Steve suggested, standing up and walking towards the wardrobe.
Their bodies also seemed to reset every morning like clockwork. Steve had accidentally cut his finger on day eleven when he’d been slicing cheese for his sandwich. Tony had insisted that he wrap it up despite Steve’s dismissal that the serum would take care of it. It had vanished the next morning, which they’d both been expecting, but not even a sliver of a scar had remained to show that it had healed. It was when Tony slipped in the bathroom, spraining his ankle, and the next morning with it having healed completely with no sign that he’d injured it at all, that they’d realized the daily reset also applied to them.
The whiteness of the snow was so immensely bright that Steve had to squint until his eyes began to adjust to the piercing light that was almost painful to look at. In the distance, the dense thicket of coniferous trees that they’d seen in the SHIELD agents’ video recordings could be seen, starting off sparse and growing nearly impenetrable farther within.
Sam raised a hand. “Can’t believe I’m saying this, but I agree with the man. Why weren’t we called in sooner?”
Steve looked up at him, his brows furrowed in a frown that was more confused than exasperated. “It looks like we haven’t touched this since we arrived.”
He’d tried to talk to Tony a few times after he’d returned, but to no avail. Sam had suggested that he give Tony some space, that he’ll come to Steve when he’s ready to talk. Somehow, Steve doubted that. He didn’t think Tony would forgive him for hiding the truth about his parents and Steve didn’t really blame him, because he was having trouble forgiving himself.
She goes through his drawers, and even manages to find the secret compartment that Clint had found in one of them when he’d first moved in. Natasha doesn’t bat an eyelid as her hand comes into contact with a moldy grilled cheese sandwich that probably shouldn’t be oozing like that, merely tossing it into the trash can next to Clint’s feet.
“I don’t know if I’m ready, Buck,” Steve admits quietly, staring down at his hands and feeling a little lost. He turns when he feels his friend’s large hand on his shoulder in support.
Steve’s hard look was ruined by the way the corner of his lips quirked up at Tony’s internal angst. His hesitant smile blew out into a wide grin as he noticed Tony’s feet tapping to the beat without his permission. Steve made a beckoning motion with his finger, pulling Tony into the middle of the dance floor.
It was a sight that was almost frightening. The sheer density of the forest with trees taller than any that Steve had ever encountered was nearly overwhelming, sending shivers that had nothing to do with the cold crawling down his spine.
He realized he was still cradling a watermelon in his arms like an idiot and hastily made to follow Bucky across the room, murmuring apologies and “pardon me’s” as he squeezed past. Tony quickly shifted the watermelon into the waiting arms of Bucky once he had safely made it to him, shaking out his arms to relieve some of the ache from holding onto it for so long.
I bet you get a lot of these. This is probably guaranteed a one-way ticket to your trash can, but maybe I’m doing this more for my benefit than yours. Look, I’m not the type to be listening to late-night radio shows, especially not ones run by Dr. Crackpot. I think I’ve started to lose my mind, ever since I heard you and your son. I want to meet you on top of the Empire State Building on Valentine’s Day. Which is in two days, my AI tells me…..
He brought a gloved hand up to his ear. “Ready, Avengers?” He received a series of affirmative answers. “Meet back here in two hours. Good luck.” Steve felt Tony’s gauntleted fingers lift him under his arms as Iron Man took off and began to rise up above the ground. He caught a glimpse of Nat, Bucky, Sam and Thor taking off on the snowmobiles from the jet, speeding off in the direction of the town. The jet’s door slowly arched upward as Bruce and Clint made their way back inside to keep an eye on the surroundings, as Bruce ran through their data and anything the jet’s sensors would pick up.
Tony shrugs, putting on his facade of nonchalance while his fingers drum on the table top. “Yeah, sounds pretty crazy. You know how it is though. It’ll probably blow over in a few days.”
It was day 160 and the coffee that Steve had made him rested untouched on the nightstand near Tony’s side of the bed.
“Are you Tony Stark?” Peter asks, his voice as quiet as a mouse. He eyes the armour with guarded excitement, half of him probably shocked at seeing Iron Man and the other half perhaps wondering whether this is the same man who had written his father.
“Yeah, what the fuck. Lesson to you, Steve. You trying to play matchmaker equals very bad,” Tony said, laying his own head down on his arm resting on top of the table so that he was at eye level with Steve. He resumed carding his fingers through Steve’s hair.
“You didn’t ask,” Thor shrugged simply, returning to the very last Pop-Tart sitting innocuously on his plate, which he looked at with absolute joy on his face that Steve generally associated with defeating an army of aliens in the middle of New York with five nuts you met two hours ago.
“So are you gonna tell us about last night, or are we supposed to be satisfied with Nat’s very concise, literal debrief of events?” Sam asked him, the concern evident in his voice, but the curiosity was written plainly across both their faces. Steve knew that Nat must have given them more than that, but he was grateful that they were nice enough to ask him about it anyway even if they did know the outcome of the evening before.
Steve sets his jaw, fists clenching by his sides as he takes in the new information. The thought of Stark going through God knew what, alone and defenseless, made Steve’s stomach lurch uncomfortably.
16 years later, Tony’s ready to collapse on the air mattress that their friends had blown up for them before they’d left his and Steve’s apartment for the night.
Day 170, Steve’s right wrist was tightly bandaged as he came round to drop off Tony's breakfast in the morning.
As soon as the words pushed their way out of his mouth like a torrential storm, Tony immediately wanted to launch himself into the lake where the crocodiles or piranhas, or whatever carnivorous animal that lived there, could devour him peacefully.
Bucky shrugged, following his gaze to the dance floor. “I dunno. Kids are doing it in their basements these days,” he said, his voice a little distracted as he looked out into the crowd, evidently searching for someone. He suddenly began to grin, waving wildly at whoever he’d been looking for.
The rest of them filed into the jet not long after him, and they lifted off from the Tower’s landing pad not long after that. Nat and Clint were at the helm, while the rest of them went over the plan again, making sure everyone had their roles in mind. Bucky, Sam, Nat and Thor were going to head into town and split off when they got there. They’d figured that two of them would check out the commercial area of the town, as the original team had done, while the other two ventured into the neighbourhood to see if the residents had somehow been sequestered to their homes by some unseeing force.
Fortunately, his legendary pride didn’t let him fold that easily. Tony weaved through the crowds with ease, fingers scrambling to pull out his phone from the pocket of his jacket to key up JARVIS so he would have an easier getaway.
“Steve, dude, you need to go talk to that man,” Sam said, placing a firm hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Other than being hounded by Ross and his pruney white-assed cronies every other day, Stark is fine. He is not using that phone for its intended purpose, Steve.”
Okay, so maybe he was feeling a little left out. It didn’t matter much. At least Bucky was happy and himself again. That was more than enough for Steve.
Tony’s mind was reeling so fast he wasn’t sure there was any fish to catch. A part of him wanted to yell at them to stop, to leave him and Steve alone. As soon as the thought entered his mind, Tony started to walk a little faster, scared to think about what that might’ve meant.
Tony noticed that Steve was getting increasingly agitated as the days went on and nothing came of Tony’s efforts. Steve hated being useless when they were thrown in the midst of fucked up situations as they so often were, and while he usually was the most useful person around, from the obvious superhuman strength to the critically acclaimed tactical genius that Tony himself had benefited from on many an occasion, this situation required either of Steve’s widely practiced talents.
“I’m Steve,” he says, letting go of Tony’s hand and turning back to his drawing. He pauses and then looks at Tony again. “Wanna see my drawing? Ma says I’m real good.”
Peter realizes abruptly that his dad doesn’t really have anyone to make him feel better, and Peter himself can’t possibly count because he’s only seven.
“If Thor doesn’t get here soon, we’re pretty much toast, Cap,” Hawkeye comments, panting into the comm link. “And I mean that literally.”
“Peter,” he mutters under his breath, heaving a deep sigh before accepting his hazelnut chocolate spread filled fate and somehow managing to shove the two new bottles of Nutella in with their kin. He turns to the three large brown paper bags on the kitchen counter, two filled to the brim with actual food and one dedicated to Peter’s various sugary cereals, snacks, and Lunchables.
They split up, Steve going around the left side of the cabin and Tony taking the right. Steve unhooked his shield from his back and swung it around so it was positioned in front of him. He moved forward slowly, grateful for the soft snow under his feet to cover any sound that his steps might have made.
If only he knew how to go about getting a new mom, Peter could be one step closer to making his dad happy again. Maybe he’d ask his Uncle Bucky when he saw him next.
“I know I haven’t been the most swell guy to be around lately,” Steve murmured, crouching down next to Dodger, who was far too busy giving his lunch all of his attention to bother with Steve. “I’m going to try to do better, pal, I swear.” He waited a moment for Dodger to finish before spilling more food into his bowl, because he figured he could do that even though it did little to ease his guilt.
“Bold of you to assume I will be at the debrief, Cap,” Iron Man says, dropping Steve gently on his feet as they arrive at the portal.
As he took in the scene around them, Steve couldn’t help but gape a little bit. Bucky let out a low whistle next to him and he found himself agreeing wholeheartedly.
“And you didn’t think the team with a literal god from outer space and the guys with like, seventeen Ph.D.’s between them should be contacted before the shit hit the fan?” Tony asked incredulously, throwing his hands up. “And by shit hitting the fan, I mean eight potential casualties, oh, and also, not to mention a whole goddamn town of people who are just not there anymore?”
“With the evidence that we had at the time, we did not think the threat was so high as to require the Avengers to be called in. The activity was not Asgardian in nature and we have the resources to handle it,” Fury said, although his argument was lacking to everyone in the room. “Our job at SHIELD is dealing with anomalies, Stark. Our agents are trained to deal with situations exactly like this one. They were doing exactly what they signed up to do.”
“Uh, actually, Dodger’s with Jack,” Steve supplied, probably unhelpfully based on the withering look that Tony sent his way. “Also, that wouldn’t be great for him. He’s got stomach problems.”
The cabin was located in the middle of a clearing, where the trees seemed to part for its placement. Upon closer inspection, Steve noticed that the ground surrounding the cabin that made up the clearing was absent of any stumps or debris that might’ve suggested that the trees had been cut down to create space for it. It was almost as if the trees had just—not grown there at all.
“I don’t think so, buddy. Someone forgot to get our groceries yesterday.” Tony says pointedly, shuffling into the kitchen to grab his steaming cup of coffee.
“Widow, incoming on your six,” Steve murmurs into the comm link as he viciously swings his shield into the neck of a giant flying Doombot. He leaps off the pile of smoldering cars he had climbed on top of earlier to gain more leverage and lands on both feet, just in time to see the Black Widow flip off the side of the thirty-storey building she had been scaling to grab onto the back of a flying bot.
“Hey, Tony, yeah?” Bucky asked him, barreling on before Tony had a chance to even nod. “What’re you doin’ up here?”
Steve wraps his arms around him, nudging his nose against the top of Tony’s head. “Maybe once or twice. It wouldn’t hurt if you said it again, though.”
He then turned on his phone to thirty-two text messages and exactly seven phone calls, five from Pepper and two from Rhodey, wondering where his ass had gotten to and then another message to let him know that he’d gotten pizza delivered to the Tower for Tony’s post-bender meal.
Sam frowned at him dubiously, looking at the vast array of food on the table apart from the highly popular pancakes. “There’s also eggs,” he grimaced at the burnt egg that Tony had barely touched. “That are not black.”
The suit weaves around Rockefeller Center, and Tony waves his fingers at a group of people out on the observation deck who point up at him excitedly. He flies past Times Square, doing another loop around the city, very pointedly ignoring the Empire State Building.
“Dude, even Fury’s worried about you,” Sam said, his tone betraying the weirdness of it all. To be fair, Fury being worried about Steve’s mental wellbeing was a bit of a shocker, considering the whole, “Here, Cap, so there are aliens, like actual aliens, not the punching through your stomach animatronic kind, and also gods whose vernacular is scarily Shakespeare-like, hope you can deal with that. Hope the cultural shock doesn’t give you depression, and if it does we’ll give you this useless therapy session where the psychiatrist will give you the okay even if you are the definite opposite of okay!” mere months after Steve had been found in the ice.
“Fuck,” he cursed, striding over to the fridge and yanking the door open. He only faintly registered Steve trailing behind him anxiously, knowing better than to question him when he got like this.
“I’ve got to run. There’s a situation at work,” Steve offers as explanation. “Mind watching Peter for a few hours?” He asks Bucky, silently pleading with him not to ask questions that Steve wouldn’t be able to answer.
A very large, childish part of Tony wanted to run away. Hide under a table or behind Pepper’s skirt like a toddler. He was a baby, he could be excused. Another part of him that sounded suspiciously like Howard told him to cut it out.
The ride over was unusually quiet. All eight of the main Avengers on duty were rarely sent on missions at the same time, but even when there were two or more of them, the Quinjet ride over to their location was usually more lively than this. Tony was murmuring quietly to JARVIS in one corner as he checked over his armour, and Bucky was helping Sam suit up in another. Bruce had an array of holo-screens floating in front of him as he studied them with a frown.
“Hey, babe, they didn’t have any Hawaiian ‘cause they were about to close, but I got pepperoni with pineapple, because I know how much of a heathen you are,” Steve says as he makes his way closer. “What’s that?” he asks, catching sight of all the stuff Tony’s pulled out of the box.
The security guard leads him to the gate and explains to the flight attendants waiting for people to show them their tickets that Peter got lost. They coo at him and let him in, and Peter smiles wide and thanks all three of them, just like his dad taught him to do.
“Not really how I imagined I would spend my evening, but I can’t say that I’m not enjoying this,” Iron Man says, barely dodging past an ill-aimed laser strike. Steve nods in agreement before realizing that Iron Man can’t see him.
Tony’s faceplate shifted up, revealing his amused expression underneath. “Gonna check under the bed for monsters, Cap?”
“That’s what she said,” Iron Man mutters in response, and Steve thinks its Hawkeye he hears bark out a hoarse laugh at the sad attempt at a joke.
Even when they’d been together, Steve had actively despised any circumstance where he couldn’t do anything to help. Tony knew that it was because of Steve’s childhood that had been largely spent watching his mother take back to back shifts at the TB ward to keep him alive and then watching helplessly as she’d succumbed to the belligerent illness herself, all while Steve had still been unable to make a living for himself.
Now it was Tony’s turn to be confused. “Wait, what? We’ve been using that thing for like ninety percent of our meals because you said we shouldn’t trust any of the food in the fridge.”
Tony turns to him, ready to tell him off for getting him all weepy over a 4-year-old’s depiction of the Big Apple.
The room was drenched in silence as the video started up again, on mute this time. Fury stopped his pacing, apparently having exhausted his arsenal of dramatics. He turned to face them, hand clasped behind his back as another screen popped up behind him, this one playing another video clip. It offered a bird’s eye view of what seemed to be the scene from the previous video, although much more visible, probably filmed from a jet from up above.
Even when Peter’s mom had gotten really sick and she slept at the hospital for what seemed like ages in Peter’s perception of time, and they hadn’t known what was wrong with her. Even when the doctors had come and told them they’d have to go back home without her, and his dad had just held out his hand for Peter to take and they’d gone to his Uncle Bucky’s and Peter had gotten to eat ice cream for dinner.
“Well, he was not a huge fan of the letter I sent him,” Steve replied dryly, belatedly realizing he was still standing by Dodger’s food bowl with a bag of dog food in his hands. He didn’t make any move to put it away and take a seat despite this realization. In absence of shield, make use of fancy dog food instead.
“I’ve been practicing,” he said with that stupid crooked smile of his that Tony wanted to punch right off his stupid, lying face. “Five seconds is my newest record, believe it or not.”
“JARVIS, place an order for two boxes of s’more flavoured Pop Tarts for Thor. And as my personal supersoldier, you should be back in there on the couch with me.” Tony says, turning to slide his arms around Steve’s middle. Thor thankfully slinks away, bidding them both a very boisterous goodnight.
“Apparently there was this man on the radio last night, kind of a crazy love therapist type show, the kind you’d probably hate,” Pepper adds with a playful smirk. “His son called in to ask about finding the father a new wife, but the man himself had caught on and started talking with the doctor. The girls practically swooned when they talked about him, even Matt was in on it, can you believe it, Tony?” Pepper remarks with mild shock, referring to her own very stoic personal assistant.
“Yeah, Tony, I think that was kind of implied,” Bruce interrupts over his shoulder, probably picking up his pace to the elevator.
“I’ll stick to the pancakes,” Steve replied dryly, finally moving towards the table where Natasha had already pulled out the chair next to hers for him. He sat down as Sam pushed a plate already filled with various breakfast items towards him. Bucky waved the now empty coffee pot at him apologetically.
“Dad! You have to read this one,” Peter cries out, scrambling down from the couch and hurrying over to his dad, waving the letter in the air.
Tony breaks out into a wide grin when he finds the frame made of very colourful macaroni with a hand-drawn picture of Steve and a stick figure which Tony thinks is supposed to be Sarah with the words “I LOVE YOU MA” scribbled underneath the drawing in large, lopsided letters.
Thor looked at him with a doubtful frown. “No, the bacon was good, actually. Almost as good as those popping tarts. Delicious things. Not quite as good as an Asgardian roast though, of course.”
Tony wanted someone to tell him what the fuck was going on, but the events quickly drained him. He ended up falling asleep on Steve’s shoulder as the QuinJet took off, awakening to Steve’s fingers carding through his hair as he softly murmured that they were home.
“You say that now, but wait ‘till we close that portal and we’re back at SHIELD for the godawful debrief.” Not to mention the clean-up and the following onslaught of press that most of them will have to encounter. Steve hadn’t really put much thought any of the stuff that came after the explosions and all the punching when he’d signed up for the job, but he’s come to regret it immensely.
The faint sound of music that he’d heard when he’d first left the main house began to get louder and louder as he started up a small stone path off to the side, farther away from the main house but somewhat close to the large cabin he was staying at with his parents for the three weeks they were to be at the Stone House. There was a large house there, up over a small hill and far enough away that he couldn’t really make it out from where he was. Through the branches that were in the way, Tony could make out a tune that was vaguely familiar and windows that were flashing red.
Tony hated himself just a little bit for this, but he reached over and pulled the hidden drawer despite the mild self-loathing. The burner phone sat there in all its brick-like, appalling flip-y glory, taunting him. It was a goddamn flip phone. He hadn’t seen one in fucking decades, but it was the most Steve thing Steve could have given him. He hated it and he hated himself for keeping it even after all these months. He pulled it out despite the warring voices in his head. Flipped it open.
Tony’s fingers find something very soft and he pulls out one single, tiny mitten, his mind dragging him back to one day after school when he’d been allowed to spend a couple of hours at Steve’s house. They’d walked home together slowly wading through the knee-high snow that had covered the sidewalk. Tony had lost his expensive mittens and hadn’t wanted to tell his parents so he’d stubbornly stuck his little hands into his pockets and tried to ignore how they were starting to go numb in the cold. Steve had noticed (of course he had) and had tried to give him both of his own mittens. Tony had protested and they’d eventually come to a compromise of each having one mitten and then lacing their bare hands together to keep warm.
The man eventually agrees reluctantly and Tony scoffs, and though he’s completely aware of the fact that he can merely turn it off and move on with his life, he feels too invested in the story to leave it behind so abruptly.
Steve looks around them where the five men who were clearly the ones behind Stark’s kidnapping are now being transported back to the Helicarrier that he can hear waiting outside.
“Sleep. Or I’ll sic Steve on you,” she threatened, pushing her chair back and somehow managing to avoid the ungodly scraping noise that it inevitably made only in the middle of the night when everyone else was fast asleep.
“Yeah, you definitely had this covered,” he nods emphatically, an amused smile tugging at his lips. “How’d you manage that anyway?” Steve asks, his curiosity finally getting the better of him as he fails at trying to figure out how Stark might’ve gotten out.
Steve activated the comm that he’d shoved into his ear moments ago, muttering a quick test into it to make sure that everyone had their own devices turned on and active. After he'd received confirmation, he led the team outside at a jog, turning back to briefly marvel at the shimmering panels of the Quinjet reflecting its surroundings as it went into stealth mode.
“Yeah, you’d think they were together, wouldn’t you?” Bucky mused, catching Steve’s eye once again and waving him over.
“Yeah, I’m thinking it was the bacon,” Steve quipped, his eyes fixed on the way Tony’s hands flipped through the screens that Bruce was pointing to, his eyes deeply curious as they read the graphs and numbers projected in front of him. Tony was frowning, flicking one of the screens back and gesturing in that way he did when he’d figured something out and was explaining why he was right. Bruce was dutifully taking down what Tony was saying, even as Tony walked away  a little as his thoughts evidently gained momentum.
“Oh, I thought that was your specialty,” Steve retorts, his heart starting to race although he’s sure the adrenaline from the expected battle had already passed. Stark’s eyebrows shoot up as he stands, drawing himself up to his full height.
“Maybe he’s caught up in something dangerous again,” Steve suggested with a shrug. That had been his immediate thought when he had seen Tony with the phone. It had been followed with that familiar churning anxiety that usually accompanied the potential thought of Tony being in some sort of danger. “And he didn’t want to be traced by using his actual phone.” That thought had quickly been extinguished when Steve had caught Tony standing by the curb, anxiously checking his actual phone to call his car to him so he could get away from Steve.
MJ grins at him, her smile almost wicked. “I’ve run away from home tons of times. I can tell you what to do.”
Steve lifted his head up from the arm of the couch he had staked out as his Spot. The soft blanket he had draped over his shoulders slipped off as he sat up with a frown.
“And I’m telling you that I did,” Natasha replies with her I-refuse-to-deal-with-your-bullshit voice, and hey, that’s not fair--
Bruce sighs once again, lifting his head from where he’d been peering through the eyepiece of one of the telescopes. “It should’ve started about twenty minutes ago, but you can’t always predict the exact time meteor showers occur, Tony--”
“I’m not moping,” he still insisted, albeit very weakly. He cast a glance towards Dodger, who was obediently sitting at his feet because he loved Steve and would never judge him about pining just a little bit. Definitely not because he was vying for a piece of pepperoni that might miraculously fly off the table. “I’ve just been thinking.”
“Look, Doctor Fieldstone, I admit we did have a tough time of it at first, but I think we’re getting the hang of this, Peter and I. And I like to think I’m doing an okay job being a dad despite it all,” Steve says heartfully, causing Tony to feel immensely sympathetic for the man. If only his own father had been half the man this Steve clearly was, maybe he’d be doing a lot better for himself today.
“Go see your meteors, Tony. I’ll see you in bed.” Steve says, and walks back out into the common area to clean up after the mess they had left. He hears a faint whimper as he leaves the kitchen, and smirks in satisfaction to himself as he picks up the empty bowl of popcorn.
Tony dropped his fork onto the plate with a loud clatter, sitting back in his chair and glaring at Nat. Steve remembered this story, vaguely recalling Tony having told it to him as the reason behind his indefinite ban from using a stove, helpfully instated by JARVIS.
Steve’s eyes start drooping somewhere around the beginning of The Last Jedi, his hand falling limp at his side from where it had been gently stroking Tony’s hair. With a huff, Tony reaches up to grab Steve’s hand and places it back atop his unruly hair, arching up into his hand in prompting. Steve smiles softly before resuming his petting, the image of a particularly clingy cat flitting into his tired mind. If the cat was a very warm and cuddly genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, that is.
“‘But all night he dreamt of his own house and wandered in his sleep into all his different rooms looking for something that he could not find nor remember what it looked like.’”
“Y’all are fucking nuts,” Sam said, rolling his eyes and sliding off the barstool and carrying his plate over to the sink. “He carries around that damn thing? And you’re here moping? Dude, why are we here again,” he asked, directing the last question at an equally exasperated Bucky.
“He’s not fine, you’ve ruined him,” Bucky said with a frown, pointing to where Dodger was lying parallel to Steve on the couch. “He’s depressed, Steve. You gave the dog depression.”
“It is fucking terrifying, Steve. I’m scared like I’ve never been before. But what can we do?” Tony said, the desperation that he’d been trying to avoid for Steve’s sake bleeding out into his voice. “We can sit here and work on that fucking puzzle. That’s all we can do.”
It hits him like the pain of stepping on a billion pieces of Legos all at once. Peter realizes exactly what his dad needs to feel better again, and he can’t help feeling a little stupid for not having seen it before.
Steve wasn’t even looking for him and he had found him in mere minutes. Not that Tony was counting or anything. Steve’s face went through a series of emotions Tony can’t quite place (surprise, confusion, abject sadness) and he seemed to be fighting with himself over whether he should come over. Knowing Steve as well as he did, Tony didn’t doubt for a second that Steve wouldn’t come over.
Steve frowns for a second as he tries to figure out what exactly Thor just said. “Do you mean s’mores?”
Peter pouts up at him, but nods anyway, slinking between his father’s legs to grab a bite at the cookie dough instead. He realizes he’s going to have to come up with a stronger argument if he’s going to actually convince his dad to meet Tony on top of the Empire State building tomorrow.
The inside of the cabin was dark, the only light being diluted by the curtains covering the small window that Steve had seen earlier. The walls were awash in the grey-blue light, a similar stream of light coming from the opposite wall revealing another window that had been covered, this one slightly bigger. Steve stepped further inside of the cabin, aware of Tony coming up beside him, his arms outstretched and repulsors charged.
“Thanks for the very belated note, Theodore,” he muttered, stalking over to the dishwasher to stuff his plate inside.
They flew for a very long time. Neither of them spoke for the duration of the flight, which seemed to drag on for much longer than it probably really was. When they’d done this the first time, just weeks after their successful defeat of Loki and the Chitauri army, Steve had been absolutely terrified. His mind had tormented him with memories of hanging onto the side of a moving train for dear life as he helplessly watched Bucky fall. Peggy’s voice cutting out and then the expanse of nothing as he brought the Valkyrie down on his own. Tony’s limp body ensconced in the Iron Man armour, plunging from a portal-free sky.
Steve furrowed his brows, shutting the doors of the wardrobe closed and stepping back towards the bed to rifle through the nightstands. “Seems pretty real to me.”
The wireless was useless before Tony had taken apart, only receiving two FM stations, one of them playing a continuous stream of Christmas music, and he’d caught three seconds of sports commentary on the other station before Tony had turned it off with a huff. The TV posed a similarly frustrating dilemma, displaying a sea of static that had made Tony’s teeth grind. When they’d connected it to the DVD player, however, it had worked just fine, the familiar 20th Century Fox logo showing up on the screen with the fanfare procession in the background.
“Hey, Pep, I was just working on these,” Tony waffles, grabbing for a pen and ending up grabbing a decorative twig instead (why??). “By the way, have I mentioned you look stunning today? Because you do. Of course you do, you always look stunning. Also, are those new Jimmy Choos, because I’ve never seen them before and you could definitely kill a man with those heels if you wanted to,” Tony says, leaning back in his office chair as far as he could go as Pepper nears his desk and doesn’t show any sign of slowing down.
“Oh, them,” Ty said, his brows furrowed in a frown as he evidently failed to manage to keep Tony’s attention. “They’re the dance people. They’re here to keep the guests happy. They shouldn’t be showing off like that,” he nodded at the crowd who had ceased in their dancing completely to gape at the dancers. “That’s not gonna sell lessons.”
