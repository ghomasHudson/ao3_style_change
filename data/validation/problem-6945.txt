From the corner of his eyes, Tony saw how Rhodey and Pepper send each other a look, which secretly made Tony swallow; God, how he hated being forced to deal with situations like this, never once in his life did Tony think that 'Talking about ghosts and haunted houses' will be one of the situations he will be forced into. "Tony, Pepper, and I were wondering if you would like to move with us, you know back to New York. Howard and Maria moved to Malibu a month ago so-" Tony cut Rhodey by raising his hand, which made his friend press his lips tightly, making Tony feel a little guilty at that.
"But Howard, what if some unsavory Alpha tried to do something? At least with a powerful Alpha, Tony can be protected!"
"My king, what irks you on this fine morning? You seem really mad about something; I can be of help if you want." Tyber, finally noticing that Jamti and Anton stopped talking, came between them, causing Anton and Jamti to let out a grumble and move their horses away from the Beta.
Tony gazed at Steve with a flushed face, he couldn't take his eyes off of the Alpha, the blond man took him and Peter out again, this time they were walking through Brooklyn streets, with the Alpha telling him funny stories of his youth pointing to a place or two giving telling Tony how they were in his time, to be true the Omega was vibrating in his place with happiness, it had been a week since the Alpha presented him with the amazing gift of all (For Tony that is) a week since he held the screwdriver in his hand, assembling and disassembling anything and everything his hands fell on, teaching himself the new discoveries in the past six years and the science he missed while also teaching his baby, who was fascinated with everything Tony does, the Omega already know that his little baby was going to be an amazing engineer.
Hung over everyone's mind, it made them furrow their brows in confusion and wonder; they didn't know if they should worry or let it be.
"Oh, Steve, you are here…" Bruce smiled as he noticed Steve walking toward him; his smile fell as he saw Steve's grim face. "Steve…?" Bruce asked softly making Steve sit on the chair and put his head in his hands. Ever since Bruce tripped over his shoes and landed on Steve Rogers (Don't ask him how, even he doesn't know the answer) the two of them became good friends (Other than the few times Steve thought of him as another type of doctor) it was honestly surprising to see Steve come into his office with such a grim and pale face, it made him concern. "What happened, Steve?" Bruce asked as he closed his files and took his glasses off, taking the role of a therapist, as much as Bruce didn't want to, he knows Steve won't tell anyone anything unless it was him.
"Steve…" Tony hissed, sending his husband a warning look, which made the man pout before letting out a sigh, sending the shark a nasty glare as if he was blaming it for being too ugly that Tony refused his gift. A few more grumbles, Steve turned around fast before he throw the shark as far as he can… which was so far that Tony was sure the shark will not survive the three miles throw that Steve just did. "Really? Couldn't you put it gently in the water? You had to throw it like that?" Tony huffed, lowering his sunglasses once more, a smile twitching on his lips when his husband continued to pout.
Tony could only gasp, his legs were shaking as he tried to stay still and not slide down the grey tiles; if Tony didn't know Howard's true intention, he would have agreed to go back home with the man, he would have agreed to be married to the highest bidder and live his life in misery if it meant his baby was going to be safe. Tony thought, he wasn't going to subject his daughter to live in fear, he wasn't going to let her be the sacrificing lamb who would get hurt every time Tony did something stupid or wrong. "Fuck. You!" Tony snapped, letting go of the window behind him as he slides down the tiles faster than he thought he would, crying out when he fell from the eaves into the bushes down below.
?' wondering why Bucky went out of his way to do that. Pressing his lips tightly, Steve pulled the sheets away, wondering if he needs to have a long talk with Bucky about his habits of living. What Steve saw behind the sheets, made him froze and for all the clothes in his hands to fall on the floor after his hands went lax.
"How did he die?" Tony whispered, already expecting the same answer that he was told for years and years now, the Omega didn't know why he was even trying when he knows that he will hear nothing new about the story.
A shriek came out from the TV. causing everyone to blink their eyes as they took in the crazy person, who was kicking and shrieking, talking about demons and assassins and ripped dicks?! His upper and lower body was drenched in blood and his chest had a tattoo of a skull that cried tears of blood.
"Steve… just call me Steve, Tony." The Alpha said making the Omega give a shaky nod at that. "I know Tony… I know everything and it's OK, I am honored that you decided to choose me to be the pup's father." Steve said making the Omega let out an 'Oh' at that tears start gathering in his eyes, he looked at the pup that was nuzzling Steve's neck, purring happily and gave a smile sniffing a little. "Hey, little one, you still hasn't told me your name, my name is Steve." The Alpha said running his hand through the pup's soft hair, that made the Pup blink and grins a toothy grin.
What nearly made Tony scramble out and run for it, was when he saw that Steve had taken him to the cemetery, which was a no-no zoon that Tony never entered since that terrifying night fourteen years ago when he nearly died on the spot when he witnessed what should have not happened. "Steve, let's go back home… please!" Tony squeaked and latched tightly into Steve's arm when a crow flew past him and gave a deafening in his ear.
"Greeting, lady Frigga, my name is Steven Rogers, I am sure you already know about that." Steven's words got a smile from Frigga as she nodded her head at his words, waving for the team urging them to follow her, as she starts walking, away, which made everyone rush to follow her last they lost her, and Thor wasn't with them, having been kicked out by Steven who couldn't handle his childish whining (Even if there was a good cause for it).
It doesn't matter that much anymore really, because it seems that Tony got used to living with an Addams; crazy one at that, but still an Addams. Unfortunately, no one decided to tell his teammates about his heroic deed, he was sure that if someone did, his team wouldn't plan on killing him on the spot every time their eyes fell on him. All in all, Tony's life sucks, and he hates that he was prey for a crazy Addams, who somehow start warming his creepy self in Tony's terrified heart; something that he will pay his therapist double so that she will find him the cure, because hell no!
They walk around Nat's car, getting in while still chatting, Tony talking a mile a minute, but no one said a thing; everyone had a big smile on their faces as they listen to his happy chat. "Look what we brought!" Pepper called out with a happy smile, giving Tony a case that made him give a strangled sound before pulling the case to him and open it with a grin, nearly squealing when he saw it was the same laptop he gave to Rhodey and Pepper for safekeeping, and Tony wondered if his A.I. was still on.
And Steve, Steve couldn't handle the madness he lived in the middle of, he couldn't handle seeing Peggy and Howard become ghosts of their past selves, he couldn't handle seeing Howard's Omega mate, swallow another anti-depressed med, he couldn't handle Angie always excusing him of being the reason that
"Steve, are we finished here?" Bucky asked as he returned from the ice cream aisle with a few boxes of ice cream, the sight of Bucky made Steve snap from his confusing state and give the Alpha a small smile; this was probably just a big misunderstanding, the man was probably delusional, he probably had a son or someone he knew with the name Steven and he confused Steve with them.
The day Antonette died, was the day Thor son of Odin was born the heir of Asgard and the nine realms, that day all the stars were looking at Asgard, waiting with patience to hear the heir's wails, that day every star in the universe turned to Asgard with happiness, only Steven, his eyes never strayed from Midgard as he saw his beloved body hit the ground and for her neck to break, but what made a shiver shake him in his astral and real form was something different completely, because on the plan Titan one of Saturn moons, he hears a child's wail, as his mother was about to kill him but was stopped by her husband…
Steve heard the voice getting fainter, so Steve kneel and took the glove off his right hand and touch along the ground until he felt a gust of wind, it made him gasp and take his Shield from his back, he raised his Shield high and give a hard hit, after a hit, after a hit, until he broke the wooden floor under him… the scent he smelled made him gag…
If Steven thought the others had a presence, then he knew absolutely nothing. This man's presence was so overpowering he silenced the entire room in a way that if a needle fell, Steven would be able to hear it hitting the ground. His expression was solemn, unconcerned, and his dark brown eyes scanned the occupants in the room in such a thorough way that Steven felt himself shiver in fear. His hair was dark that was painted red, from blood maybe; his hair was shorter than the red hair but longer than the blond, and with fewer braids, which allowed it to fall freely against his red and golden armored shoulders with a grace nobody would expect from a Viking. He had a full beard, differently from his other male companions whose beards were thinner. There was a strange symbol in the middle of his chest armor, which was clearly the work of a highly-skilled smith if the intricate details in the metal were any indication. It looked sturdy, almost… impenetrable, and Steven couldn't help but to be impressed because it reminds him of his home and a vow that was long forgotten.
Steve didn't know why, but one day he had asked Peggy how she had known that Angie was her fated mate… he asked her what was the phenomena that were called 'Fated Mates' that everyone seemed to talk about… he remembered Peggy pausing a little bit at that then smiled… she explains to him what fated mate was, how they are the person that will stay by your side no matter what, how fate chooses them for people, how you will know them when you see them… she explained that you can know if you have a fated mate, that it's different from one person to another, that some can communicate with their mate by writing on their skin, how some dreams of them, how some can just see them in the mirrors, different ways to find them, but not once did she mentioned any kind related to that hunted singing…
The rain continues to fall, pattering softly through the trees and disturbing the usually still surface of the lake as they walk down to the house in a few short steps. Tony can see how Rhodey and Pepper cast a brief glance around the front yard, the fire pit that is slowly filling with ashy water, and the private beach leading down to the lake. The water lapping at the shore is churned up and muddy, and there are deep gouges in the dirt that wasn't there earlier. Tony pointedly ignores the trampled, mud-streaked grass; climbing the steps to the porch, sheltering from the rain while his friends followed.
Peggy had told him when he asked, from that day; Peggy took it as her mission to teach him everything about her universe, about the Alphas, Betas, and Omegas, about werewolves, about humans, about the events that happened and the differences that took a place in the major events.
"I can't handle it, Tony…" Steve finally whispered in Tony's neck where he laid his head, breathing wetly like he was trying to hold back his tears, which made Tony swallow and kiss the Omega's forehead. "He was so hopeful… it was the first time I saw his eyes sparkle like that… in pure joy… the last time that happened, it was on his sixth birthday when I showed him the only picture I have of you… he waited for you until it was dark, crying when you didn't show up, I can't handle his heart breaking like that again, not like that…" Steve sniffed as he clutches Tony's shirt tightly in his hands, not knowing if he wanted to pull the Alpha and break down crying, or push him away and curse him to death for destroying Steve's already fractured life.
"She is a mean lady…" James muttered, which made Steven give a shaky smile despite his want to scream at the words he heard from that woman, and Steven took a shaky breath as he turned around the place wondering where to go now since the woman has left them alone. "When are we going to see Margaret, Mama?" The boy asked which made the Omega give a small smile, trying to hide his shakiness and confusion.
Steve looked at the door and flinches when the door was knocked and the voice of the landlady calling for Steve, looking at the apartment for one last time, Steve took his stuff and left the apartment; with tears in his eyes and the feeling of leaving something important behind him, Steve may be too young to understand some things, but he understands love perfectly, and he understands how many types of it there was, and knowing Anthony, he knew the Alpha was not like his father, Anthony was far from being that cruel man, and Steve was sure the Alpha will prove that to him...
Steve let out a yawn, standing up from his set, and took measured step after step as he followed the rest of the Avengers to the tower's living space. Shuffling to the nearest couch, Steve let out a content sigh as he throws himself face-first into the couch, letting out a pained noise as he snuggles into the couch, leaving a little space for Tony and Peter to sit.
As quickly as Edith said those words, the workshop went into a lockdown making everyone's eyes widen and gaze at the electrical barriers that enveloped every exit. "J override!" Tony yelled, searching around the place, not believing that Edith just locked them inside of his workshops and condiment Steven's life to hell by declining to cooperate.
"Yes, after you came home drunk and fought with your brother!" Steve finally snapped, which made Tony raise his eyebrow, looking at Steve like he sported five other heads. "How could you do this to me, Tony? Why did you break your promise?" Steve's voice cracked, tears start clouding his eyes, which caused the Alpha jump in surprise and rush to him.
It was after finishing dinner that he heard it, the squeak followed by the sound of breaking glass, making Tony freeze for a second before rushing out of the kitchen to see what was going on, hoping that Peter and Harley were OK and that nothing bad happened. Reaching the living room, Tony relax when he saw that the kids were fine, but what made him tense once more was the way Harley holding himself; shaking in his place on the verge of tears, looking down, Tony discovered the reason to be the glass of water that was smashed not a that far away from Harley.
The noise of the cage door opening caused Steven to twist his head with a sinister frown to the man who dared to capture him, only for his eyes to widen for a fraction when he met Zola, in flesh and blood walking inside the room, with… with Bucky! Bucky who was muzzled with his mask, a rope attached to a choker that was clasp tightly on his neck, the end of the rope was in Zola's hand, Bucky who was nude from head to toe, quivering and shuddering, but staring at his feet obediently. That sight made Steven's blood pulse like magma in his body; anger darkened his eyes, specifically when he saw Zola sending him a polite smile.
"Is that all?" Thanos asked, and Nebula tried desperately to think of a way that will save her; because now the smile on her father's face informed her that Thanos knew all of this from the start and that her information was useless to him. If she didn't act fast and tell him any good information, it will mean her death.
"I can't… I can't…" Steve whimpered feeling Tony wiping the tears that fell from his eyes. "I can't make promises I can't keep…" Steve's breath hitches making Tony swipe his hair away from his forehead, usually, Steve kept his slightly long hair slicked back, a look he dons after the snap, but know, his hair was all over the place, making him look like a mess.
There was not much that he remembered from his birth/creation, the only thing he remembered was the feeling of his atoms being pulled and then squeezed tightly together followed by a huge exploding, as a cloud of dust from various colors surrounded him, the first time he opened his eyes… or well what equalize as his eyes because he was a… soul, spirit whatever the hell he was… anyway, the first time he opens his eyes, he ends up gasping at what he saw, because in front of him was the most beautiful sight… the universe… later that day (He learned later it was a year in his time) he met another star, she, he knows she was a she, he knows that just like he knows he was a… well, he… that star looked at him and then took him under her wing/cloud/rings? But she cared for him and taught him many things, about his origin and how once he was a soul that roamed the realms until his death and rebirth as a star, and what a star she said 'A star that can create passages between the universe.' he was special she always reminds him of that even if he wasn't a normal star like her and like the rest, she also goes by the name Saraious, but he always gets tired by trying to say the name right, so in the end, he started calling her by 'Sara' he doesn't know from where that name came from, it was a short version of her name sure, but he knows that for him it was special, and he can't think of anyone deserving that name other than her, which made Sara proud and except being called by that name, by him only.
"I had the choice, and I decided to get better, for me first, and for them secondly, after all, Captain America is more than just propaganda, he was Steve Rogers first." Steve said which made Tony bite the inside of his cheek and return his gaze toward Peter, who was moving his head like he was humming with a song only he knew it.
Shield Real Estate is easy enough to find, with the town being small and all. Tony parks and removes his gloves, leaving them on the passenger's seat while he brushes his hands through his hair and tries to look slightly presentable. He glances at his reflection in the review mirror and stops trying. His right eye is red and puffy, pushing his eye shut. His hands don't look much better. He lets out a sigh, and hopes for the best, hoping to still have some leftover from the luck that made him able to run away without being caught to help him here, too.
The less said about the Bucky doll was the best; Bruce was sure that Bucky was planning to turn into Chucky, only his prey in all of this was Tony, who seemed to be the love of Steve's crazy life. It wasn't that Bruce was a little annoyed about not being able to catch Steve's eyes, he just knows that his life matters more than chasing after Steve who will stab him in the back as the Addams' idea for fun.
To think that he will never be able to see his baby grow up, or even hold him in his arms, was a heart retching though, but it was the reality, his baby died, he screamed, and cried, and was so in pain until he died, and it was his fault, it was! If only he searched for his baby earlier, if only he got a grip of himself and refused to believe his father, then he would have found his baby, then his baby would be alive today, here with him, but in the end, Tony was a coward, he was a coward and preferred to hide behind alcohol, he hide behind alcohol and killed his baby…
The Omega snarled at that and let out a threatening hiss, which stopped the Alpha in his place because the man already knows how a pregnant Omega from his people can be dangerous. "A hypocrite brut that is what you are!" The Omega screamed making the Alpha back away a little at that. "If you have not realized yet, your enemy's child and husband already living under your roof, you arrogant king!" The Omega words made the king pause in his place, already knowing what the Omega was implying and as much as the Alpha hates it, the Omega's words held truth in them. "If you come near my children, any of them, I promise you I will make your end as painful as it can be…" The Omega hissed, which made the king scowl, but he didn't dare to come near the furious Omega, who left the king standing in his place.
“Never, ever dare to insult my Alpha, ever again!” Tony hissed, causing Sarah’s eyes to narrow in his direction, a growl nearly leaving her lips at the insulting and disobeying tone, Tony used against her. “I don’t know what you have against me, Mrs. Rogers, and I don’t care if you hate me, but never insult Steve for something that wasn’t his fault, whatever Miss Peggy did, it is not justified that you turn all domineer and control Steve’s life just because of one failed relationship!” Tony growled, he can see how wide Sarah’s eyes became at the mention of that name.
?" Steve purred as his arms encircled Tony, pulling him tightly to the muscled chest as he started kissing Tony's neck making the genius let out a purr of his own. Steve and Tony finally left the after-party, going to the hotel they reserved before taking their flight to Hawaii tomorrow (The only reason they choose Hawaii and not the amazon jungle where they would be eaten alive, was because Pepper gave them the tickets and paid for the honeymoon while crying, saying something about how happy she was for them); Tony was sure that by the end of this night, this hotel would end up haunted and destroyed by his husband, and that thought made a giggle leave him.
A month, a month had passed since the supermarket terrorist attack (That's what the media took to calling it) a month passed with Steve being jumpy, scared, and suffering from survivor's guilt (Or so Bucky and later his therapist liked to say) a month of Tony refusing to leave Steve's side, staying beside Steve and refuse to let Steve out of his side for a second.
"Well, hello, I guess? Please come in, cold weathers are bad for the baby." Steve said after shaking the man's hand, feeling his baby shiver against him, his apartment was shitty that was sure, but at least it had a decent heating system if you didn't go out in the hallways that it, the lawyer blink and nod his head at that entering the apartment and closing the door behind him looking around the place as he did. "Sit here sir; do you want water, tea?" Steve asked getting a headshake from the man who looked around the place.
"I am sorry I fell sick before Christmas…" Peter murmured, shifting in Steve's embrace and hold tightly into him; his baby's words causing Steve's lips to twitch down. "I wasn't awake when Daddy came home so he probably left…" Steve's breath hitched at the sad undertone his baby tried to hide from him; a long time ago Steve probably wouldn't have heard the whisper his baby spoke because of his bad hearing, but thanks to the serum he can hear everything loud and clear, he can even hear his baby's heartbeat if he strained his ears enough.
Steve still worries constantly, but one look at Tony, and Peter is usually enough to calm him. He knows Tony worries too but stayed strong and stable for them, and that gives Steve the strength to push his own fears away. He also knows that Tony will be an amazing parent to their little babe just like he was to Peter, and Steve knows that he himself will strive to be the best he can to match that.
His lover, just saying this word made Steve's heart pound in his chest uncontrollably. It was over three months since the gala, three months after their night together, three monthw of the two of them decide that they will take the future one day at a time and enjoy being in each other's presence as lovers. Steve knew that this was foolish of him; to finally give in to the burning desire to be with Tony, his Anton, was only going to lead to pain and heartbreak. Pain and heartbreak that was not only from the thought of losing his lover but also from losing the little boy he started to consider as a son and the people he considered his friends and family. Unfortunately, Steve can't help himself, he can't stop himself from wanting Tony, and he decided that tasting what it meant to have a lover and family is way better than wishing and fantasying about them for the rest of eternity. The only thing that Steve hoped for was him being reborn as a mortal in his next life, a mortal who would have the chance to finally have the life he wanted with his Anton and their family.
After the ceremony ended, it was time for the reception, and Tony had to be honest with himself, meeting the rest of Steve's family was… interesting. He met Wednesday again, and Tony had to say she look as terrifying as she did the first time he met her, and surprise of all surprises, she was a BFF with Serpentine and learned everything from her aunt and mother. Wednesday's brothers were kinda interesting on their own… but their hero-worship and crush on Steve is kinda concerning, but sweet at the same time. As for Gomez and Morticia… Tony can say he could only give a dreamy sigh at how in love the two of them were, even being creepy and all of that, they were so sweet and loyal and should be the role model of every healthy relationship! Looking closely, Tony now knew from where Steve got his charms and romantic side from, and the genius hoped that he and his husband would look like those two when they get older. The rest of Steve's family were fascinated and scary at the same time, Tony was so sure one of two of his guests had run away from the wedding while screaming bloody murder.
War. There was a war coming, a war against a mad titan who wanted Steve to be his bride; a war against a crazy person who will rip Steve's heart to live forever. There was a war that will destroy many lives, the war was coming and they need to prepare for it, not only to save the universe but to save Steve…
But Tony knew that Steve was busy the Alpha after all was the vice-commander of Shield and he had a lot of work lining on him, but the Alpha always, almost all the time, found the time for Tony and Peter even if he was busy, something that the Omega was always grateful for.
"I love you." Steve whispered that night when Peter was fast asleep in his self-claimed room, and finally after months, Steve and Tony have the time to themselves without someone interrupting them.
"Tony! I'm home!" Peter called out happily as he entered the house, which made the Omega's heart nearly stop at that but he steeled himself and stood up from his place on the couch, walking toward where the pup was standing putting his back bag and jacket in the closet.
Thankfully, Steven always sleeps at day and stay awake at night, so that meant Tony doesn't see much of the man unless he went for his midnight snack. Ever since Peter, Tony knew how important it was to keep a good sleeping schedule if he wanted to keep up with his baby who had the energy of a puppy that drank a whole box of energy drinks; but sometimes Tony can't sleep, his mind won't allow him to, and that's when his workshops come into being, it helped him keep his mind off unpleasant things, like how his lucky star hates his guts.
The ride was silent, but Steve was fuming on the inside after reading the letter from Howard Stark, the fucker really thought that he can come and take his baby away from him; the fucker even had the guts to call Child Services on him! Steve will make sure that the fucker will wish that he didn't cross his road ever again.
In the end, Tony just gave Howard a soft smile and opened the door for him. "No, you came just in time, please come inside, I want you to meet Steve." Tony said, happiness bubbling inside of him and he has to try hard to stop himself from crying, Tony took his Dad's hand in his and gave it a little squeeze, reassuring him that everything was alright…
By the time Steve reached the hospital he was in so much pain, he wondered why he didn't feel it before now, they end up doing a C-section because Steve starts bleeding heavily, Steve was dazed half of the times and deep down he wondered if the child was going to die.
"We are coming to visit in four months from now, I'm sure you will need two capable fellas to help you prepare for the baby's arrival… and remember Tony, you are dead if I'm not the godmother." Pepper cooed while patting his cheek, which caused Tony to shiver and laugh nervously, Rhodey, the traitor, did nothing but back away, sweat sliding down his face.
That's why you will find Rhodey and Tony arguing back and forth about where they should put Jarvis. Rhodey was more into putting it into the attic (Implying that if Tony wanted a lab it should be up there) while Tony insists on putting Jarvis in his room or the room downstairs (Which made Pepper get involve and start scolding Tony about where was he going to sleep or where will his guests sleep). All in all, it was agreed by his friends (Minus Tony) that his workshop and Jarvis was going to be in the attic until further notice (And no, Tony wasn't pouting at the thought that Morgan's playroom was turned into his shop, nope)
"Why… why are you here?" Steven asked tiredness trying to pull him back under but Steven pushed back refusing to fall into slumber with the king being near him. Part of the Omega wondered how he managed to fall asleep with the king a few feet away, a fate that never once happened to Steven before he came to his homeland, or as close as his homeland can be when its nothing but burned woods and ashes, not a three days walk around the mountain.
When a few seconds passed in silence and the king refused to speak, Steven let out a low hiss before he turned away, planning on leaving and admonish himself for wasting his precious time for someone who wasn't worth it. "I apologize!" The king said, causing Steven to stop in his place and turn to the king, raising his eyebrow as he tilted his head, ordering the king to continue or he would leave; the king seemed to get the message because he shuffled a bit in his place before gazing at the queen with a raised head. "I am deeply sorry for what I said earlier, I should not have let my anger control me and unleash it on you just because I was having a bad day; I promise I this would not happen again." The king said, causing Steven to frown and gaze at the man, trying to see the deception in his tone; when he saw the honestly instead of deception, Steven pressed his lips into a tight line wondering what to do.
But Steve wasn't thinking about that at all, not at all, because today was a really important day for him! Today he was having an appointment with Dr. Cho, the obstetrician that Bruce recommended to him. Steve can admit that he was excited, for there was the possibility of him doing an ultrasound and seeing his baby! Just thinking about seeing his little pup was making Steve gooey on the inside.
The voice drawled in a heavy voice before switching to a heavy accented tone (Russian or German, Steve only know that it was harsh and cold) and Steve felt a shiver going down his spine at the dark undertone, what Steve hated the most was that the voice kept changing, kept wavering, like the person on the end of the line was either putting a piece of clothes on his mouth or was doing something that changed his voice.
"I summoned a demon." Rogers said with a happy smile, looking at Tony like he was a puppy waiting for praise, which is wrong to think of Rogers like that especially when he was a psycho. "Don't worry, he didn't run this time, I locked it in my room and next time it will go after Bucky." The happy smile widens even more, making Tony scream.
The hour he spent in that room, was the sadist and happiest one he went through, it remind him of how happy and joyful he was when he moved into this house, how he spent the days and months talking to his baby and waiting for him to be born into this world. By the end of his visit, a decision made itself known, and all the doubts left Tony as went to his husband to tell him about his answer.
"Do not worry, love, we shall enjoy every scream of pain tonight, we shall bath in our enemy's blood as we rip his heart out!" Steve grinned, being too cheerful for someone who was going to be Satan and torture some poor souls on this fine evening. Tony couldn't help but pity Stane, even with the man being a dick, no one deserves to be a target of the Addams family.
!" A Beta woman with brown hair and red lips ran to them, pulling the small pup away and hid him behind her back as she gave Fury a dark glare hiding the fear in her eyes as she tried to protect the boy. "
"Be careful of the sugar rush, the little pup turns into the Hulk every time he is near sugar." Steve said as he opened the car, putting the pup in the backseats while buckling his seatbelt, looking at him with a pointed look as the pup tried to loosen the belt, that made the pup pout, but he left the belt alone, so Steve took it as a win and closed the door, opening the passenger seat's door for Tony, causing the Omega to fan himself with his hand.
Tony hummed happily to himself as he closed the front door, locking it twice to make sure that everything was going to be fine when he will go to his bedroom and enjoy a good night of uninterrupted sleep, that was unless his bladder decided to act first. But first thing first, Tony was going to the kitchen and search for some food; his little Morgan is always hungry this time of the night. Tony was sure that if he searched a little he will find some of Angie's cook in the fridge.
The only thing that Steve remembered was him waving goodbye to May who was going to the hospital, he remembered Peter in his embrace, and him humming happily to the child as the two went into the house, the next thing, Steve remembers is something hard-hitting him on the face, that he lost his balance, and maybe he lost his consciousness too because the next time Steve opened his eyes he was on the floor of his room, his hands bound behind his back, his baby was whimpering as he tried to wake him up, letting out sobs now and then.
"Easy for you to say that you are not the one who fell into this nastiness, Brother Steven!" Thor snapped as he tried to stand up only to slip and fall face-first into the vomit which made him scream on top of his lungs as he throws himself away from the puddle on the ground. "Curse you, Brother Clint! Curse you!" Thor's screams made Steven press his lips tightly, especially when he heard Tony snickers beside him, and Clint start laughing while groaning in pain.
Howard took a seat in the chair that Tony occupied not a long time ago, gazing at Steve in the eyes. "You know, a long time ago I met someone just like you. Said the same honeyed words as you did years ago and just like my foolish I was an idiot enough to fall in love with him." Howard stated in a bored voice like he had so many important things to talk about than this, Howard then put his hand in his suit jacket's inner pocket to get something that Steve didn't pay that much attention to. "Here is the plot twist though, my dear old father was a smart and a cunning man, he saw something I didn't notice in the Omega, and guess what? He offered him the money in exchange for the Omega leaving me alone." Howard gave an empty smile as he gazes at Steve, and the Omega could see the cold anger burning under the emotionless façade that Howard was using. "Needless to say, the Omega ended up taking the money with the biggest smile on his ugly face; turned out he was more interested in the dollars I have than me, that's what he said on his deathbed anyway." Howard shrugged, opening the metal cast in his hands, getting out a huge syringe that was filled with a deep blue liquid.
"Yes, baby, it is him, but Harley is a little tired right now so he is going to take a nap," Tony replied, smiling when he saw Peter pout at the thought of having to wait before being able to play with Harley to his heart content; it was such an innocent and cute sight, it nearly made Tony coo at how precious Peter was.
Steve hummed as he gazed out the window seeing Tony being droved off to work. Steve on the other hand was a freelance artist and a good one at that, even if Howard always sneers at his work, so he knew that if he really put his mind to it he will be busy the whole day. However, he couldn't shake the nervousness of Tony's brother coming here to stay with him for however long the man needed to get on his feet.
"Bambino, nothing that causes you to cry is stupid, what happened?" Tony questioned gently drawing the boy in a hug when he saw the boy's lips quiver at the question, which made Tony struggle to shush him getting a few sniffles before the young boy finally calmed down.
“I will kill him!” Steve snarled as he stalked around the tower’s halls trying to search for Tony, the Alpha has disappeared as fast as he can after he told Steve for the tenth time that day, that no, he can’t go out of the tower, and it doesn’t matter if it was May’s appointment with the doctor, he was staying because his mate and best friend are hell bend on making him spent the rest of his life with Peter in this ugly tower.
The sight made a smile tug on the corners of the king's lips, and Anton couldn't help being thankful for the queen's babe for getting his boy out of his shell. A few months ago… no a year ago, his boy would have followed Anton without a word of what he wanted, working with Anton in his workshop just to hide the fact that he didn't have a friend and that the people around the village bully him. No matter how hard Anton tried to make the place more acceptant of his child and the few people who came to them seeking protection, Anton never seemed to manage that; not when the Stone family and some of the elders were sitting on following the old ways.
That more than ever made the creature's interest and curiosity rise, for this was the first time he was near a human that didn't wake up and scream at him. the creature looked around the place, making sure that no one arrived to his land without him noticing; when he saw that no one was near, the creature gave a chirp swimming to the other side of the boat and rise himself until he was on the boat, making sure not to rock the piece of wood violently last it flip over sending both the creature and the sleeping boy into the cold water. The water was freezing this time of the year, even the creature couldn't stand it sometimes, and knowing how weak the sleeping boy was, the creature was careful in getting on the boat.
"I didn't want to date someone fake… I am already surrounded by fake people all my life; I don't need someone to fake themselves just to be with me." Tony mumbled, returning back to his ice cream and ignoring the 'Aweee!' he heard above him, too busy stuffing his face and stumping on the porcelain doll that targeted his legs with its small knife. God, Tony really needed to make Steve stop bringing these demon-possessed dolls to the mansion, they reproduce like rats, every time Tony thought he finished them, double the number will come back the next day. "Is this your version of the shovel talk?" Tony asked, gazing at the ghost who was taking him in with amusement, her bloody lips stretch wide in a smile.
"Oh, I know! He said he was born on the 10th of January!" Peter grin hugging the bear tightly at the thought of giving it to his friend, ignoring the fact that his word froze Tony for a second, but the Omega just shook his head, he doesn't need to overthink things to add an additional heartbreak to the list, he doesn't need to jump into conclusions that will only break his heart.
"Isn't there a way? I am sure you have a therapy for this kind of things, I am not saying that we should let Tony start a relationship with Rogers, God knows what Tony will do if he saw us trying to actively separate them, but we can post pointed it as much as we can if we have an excuse until we find Bucky, then Tony can't say a thing." Steven said hating himself for conspiring with Peggy to separate Tony from someone he loves, but what can he do? Tony himself told him that when he was twenty he gained nothing but heartbreak and pain because he believed that people actually cared and because of that his decisions were always rushed, and Steven wanted to spare Tony that pain if he can, even if it meant doing a despicable thing like that. Steven pulled the woman with him to sit on one of the sofas in the library, hoping that she will be able to think straight with the change of scenery
"Please, tell me something…" Jarvis said once they entered the staff room, the staff by this point knew the two of them, as they always volunteered here, and in the clinic on the other side of the hospital.
13-Stolið minjar eða ekki, allir sem klæðast þessu eru undir vernd minni, þú snertir þá, ég mun ekki hika við að drepa þig. -A stolen relic or not, everyone who wears this is under my protection, you touch them, I will not hesitate to kill you.
"I… I will… I will go and call Mr. Clint…" Harley said as he looked between the two adults before starting to run, leaving Tony sighing as he turned once again to Peggy, who look even murderous than she was a few seconds ago, which informed Tony that Harley's interruption put a wrench in whatever plan she had in mind.
16-Herra minn, við höfum fundið þá, fimmtán alls. -My lord, we have found them, fifteen one in total.
Steve sighed and looked at the sky with a scowl before clearing his throat, his eyes returning to the ball. "It's me, Steve… Steven Rogers, Serpentine's son." Steve offered, hoping that grandma Addams will either tell him where to find his mother or that his mother is with her, either way, Steve really needs to find his mother; sitting in his pet cemetery probably wasn't the best place to make a connection with the other world, he probably should have gone to one of the Addams cemeteries in Brooklyn, maybe then he would have had luck in finding his mother.
Steve swallowed at the painful images of Peter and Tony getting hurt… Steve knew… he knew that if anything happened to Tony and Peter, he wouldn't survive this time, that his heart would completely break and all of his magic and shine was going to leave him for the rest of infinity. "Where are you planning on taking me?" Steve finally dared to ask, already steeling himself for what to come; Steve needed to ensure that his family, his lover, and the little boy he thought of as his son was going to survive.
"Oh, don't be shy, tell me what kind of inventions you made, little bambino." Tony cooed at the pup which made the pup look at him a little leaving his father's side to stand near Tony, and then the pup start talking about some of his ideas, which were actually impressive, especially for a pup this young, so Tony nodded at every idea the pup said, with a huge smile on his face as the pup start moving his hands in an animated way. "You are so smart! You know Steve I may steal the pup away so be careful." Tony said as he cooed to the pup which caused the small boy to giggle and smile.
The person on the other side was silent, not answering Steve's question, and Steve would have thought that the person hung up if it wasn't for the panting on the other side; gazing at Tony, Steve saw the calculated look on his husband's face, it made Steve wondered what would happen. Before Steve snapped something at whoever was calling him a sigh was heard from the other side of the phone.
"Please..." He begged brokenly making Steve hummed non-committal and dragged his other hand over the tense muscles in Tony's back until he relaxed again. "I'm ready." The Omega moaned and pulled their fingers away. Steve lubed his cock with Tony's slick and then held himself steady with one hand while the Omega sank down.
It took time before Tony and Steve managed to get the story out of Harley's mouth, and when they heard what Harley went through; the two of them barely managed to stop themselves from searching for Harley's previously foster home and destroy them for that they did to their son. Needless to say, the days after Harley's breakdown was spent reassuring the boy that they won't abandon him and that a new baby won't change that. Tony and Steve doubted that Harley believe them, especially with how attached he became, refusing to leave Tony or Steve alone unless it was to school; even Peter was having a hard time managing to get through Harley, not being able to move Harley from their sides even with the promise of going to their corner in the workshop.
When Steve raises his head, his heart nearly stopped when he saw Bucky standing over him, gazing at him with a cold and calculating gaze, leaving Steve shivering in both fear and pain. Bucky though smiled a little as he crutched down, his left hand coming to caress Steve's bloody cheek, which only made the tears run down Steve's face faster and faster. "If you have accepted my offer, none of zis vould have happened, sveethearrrt." Bucky cooed leaving Steve shaking in his place when he saw the needle in Bucky's other hand; before Steve's vision turned black, the hair on his body stand on its end when he heard the familiar sound that torments him from the start…
"We agreed on Morgan, I like that name." Tony finally said leaning on Steve after a while, a big smile on his face as he looked at his family laughing and cheering, his mother taking his daughter carefully as everyone went close to look at the new addition to the Stark family, happiness fluttering inside of Tony at the sight, maybe Steve was right in the end…
"P-Papa you are embarrassing me!" Peter whine with teary eyes and puffed cheeks which made Tony coo at that and kneel until he was leveled with the pup, which caused the pup to blush and hide his face in his father's legs.
"Are you excited to be back home?" Steve asked, pulling Tony in his arms, holding him tightly, until Tony let out a huff at how tight the Alpha's hold was, but it didn't matter to Tony, for the Omega just snuggled into his Alpha's chest, nuzzling his neck and letting out a happy sigh.
"Mr. Stark." A voice behind Tony said which caused Tony to suppress his sigh and let go of the dessert plate, turning his sight to Sarah who was looking so uncomfortable that Tony felt bad for her but not as bad as to not defend himself if she started something on his and Steve's engagement party.
"Aunt May…" The pup laughed nervously as he backed away from Tony, which made Tony stand up and look behind him at the scowling Beta who was glaring at the pup who was trying to look away from the woman.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, sadness, a little bit of violence (?), feelings, mention of past abuse, mention of rape, panic attacks (?), therapy, fluff; And Tony finally gets his shit together after screaming his head off about something… And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
“I wished to… inform you of something.” Tony responded with a hesitant smile, fretting when the woman's intense blue eyes landed on him, but Tony regain himself and give the woman a joyful grin. “Steve asked me to marry him, and I-“ Tony couldn’t even complete his speech, he was cut by the sound of breaking china, which caused him tense, when his gaze shifted to Sarah to see her eyes so wide and the teacup is broken on the floor.
"Fuck you, Rogers! Not everything is about you, asshole!" Tony snapped pushing Steve out of his way as he stumped his way toward his room inside of the palace, leaving Rogers looking at his back, feeling a little dumbfounded at the Omega, that wasn't the response he expected. Steve though, only grunt at that and return his gaze to the view he was seeing before trying to ignore the pain in his chest.
Steve was so pale; his mate was so pale that Tony feared that his mate was already dead if it wasn't for the harsh intake of breath coming from Steve and the heart monitor peeping with every intake and exhale. Shaking was the only thing that Tony could do as he took the seat beside the hospital bed, taking Steve's hand in his and squeeze, being careful of the tubes attached to Steve's thin arm. His mate never looked as small as he does now; even on his bad days, Steve always looked larger than life, always strong, always happy, always smiling, and full of life. His Steve never used to look like this even on his bad days, and Tony, looking at Steve now, he was afraid.
Before Tony opened his trembling lips to quiet his baby, the Captain entered the room with a happy smile and a shopping bag in hand. "Hello there, little one, are you well?" The Captain asked making the pup jump in his place in Tony's lap while nodding his head happily. "May I?" The Alpha asked when he reached the bed, making Tony shake a little at that, but a whine from his baby made him swallow and nod his head letting go of his baby who crawled toward the Alpha.
"There you are." Steve breathed as he pulled his Omega to his chest, causing Tony to lean on him before turning in his arms and hide his face in the Alpha's chest, taking in a big breath only to calm down when Steve start scenting him as much as Tony hated being thought of as a stereotypical Omega who could only calm himself at the presence of his Alpha, these past few days were hell on him, and the only person who was able to calm him down enough was the blond Alpha, who was supportive and loving this whole time, and Tony was so grateful for him because he didn't even know what he would do if he didn't have Steve beside him.
Gone the grey roof and tiles, and in its place were blue tiles, a calm color that made her smile, the creamy walls of the house were painted white while the door was a dark shade of brown that almost looked black, the house also seemed…. Bigger, like the person living there decided to extend it and add more rooms to it until it reached the deck. The gardens, the once barren garden that was foul with only grass, was now filled with roses, flowers, vegetables, and fruit trees of all kinds, making the her tired blue eyes sparkle. The woman wondered about the person who turned the once deserted place into a lovely home; causing tears to cloud her eyes as she looked around the place.
"Natasha why don't you come and say 'Hi' or are you too shy." Peter heard his Papa, said and he turns to the woman that was standing near the door, she had strange hair-like Pep, even stranger, like the color he saw in the papers his Mama had, it was red if he remembered the name right.
"This is… what you wanted me to be…." Tony fires back, but his voice was too wobbly, he wanted to hold Steve, he wanted the Omega to hold him tightly and never let him go, he wanted the Omega to run his hand through Tony's hair as he used to when the Alpha was too stressed by everything around him, he wanted his Omega back…
"You are wrong." Anton snapped, turning his back to the queen, trying to calm his racing heart, his mind still repeating the image of the nude Omega, causing Anton to flush even more in embarrassment, not knowing how to act in such an embarrassing situation. "Considering this lake is secluded, I decided to take a swim here; if I knew that this place was the gathering place for annoying Omegas I would have tried to find another one." Anton huffed feeling his cheeks flush at the snort the Omega gave, wondering if he was turning red all over his body… for all of his long life, Anton was never once put in such a situation before; he wasn't a floundering virgin or afraid of seeing a nude body (He bathed beside Nattalegg and Magna for Odin's sake!) It's just… it's different when it comes to Omegas. (3)
"It started sixteen years ago… a few months after I started living with Peggy and Bucky." Natasha finally spoke after a while of silence, her face darkens as she remembered the past. "Back then, the town did not accept people living in it easily, only those who had nowhere to go or were running away from their personal hell were allowed in this town, that is after they were told about Rogers and the rules they should follow to the T if they were planning on staying here for the rest of their life." Natasha started, her words causing Tony to bite the inside of his cheek as he glared at the lake.
"Everything will turn out alright, sweetheart." Steve whispered as he kissed the Omega's tear-stained cheek, lowering himself to hold the Omega bridal style which only made Tony hold into Steve tightly, wishing that the Alpha would take him away from here. It was only a few seconds later that tiredness washed over the Omega's body and he couldn't keep his eyes open anymore…
It was after Peggy was able to calm Steven down that everyone took a seat in the living room, with Pepper and Steven sitting on different sides of the room, but everyone knows that if Steven really wanted he could stab the woman without anyone being able to stop him. "I am sure it was all a misunderstanding, right Steven?" Peggy asked, pinching Steven on his right side when the man didn't answer them but kept his mouth shut.
The slow smile that took over James's faces made a shiver run down his spine, especially the smugness that dripped from it. "I think that Steve will prefer a killer over someone who ignores their own child and mate, don't you think?" James answered sweetly as he pointed to the envelope in Tony's hands causing the Alpha's eyes to widen.
"Your father is a smart man, Pete." Tony said as he turns to prepare their lunch. "So tell me little bambino, why aren't you in school today, skipping your classes already?" Tony asked as he cut the chicken to small cubes, holding his smirk in when the pup squeaked at that like he was offended by Tony's words.
"Is he bothering you again?" The blond Alpha, which Tony told him named 'Steve', came into the kitchen, a big gentle smile on his face as he took in the sight of Tony and the small boy attached to him. they made a happy picture, a picture that Howard had a long time ago but waste it away because he listens to the delusion of a mad man. "Good morning, Tony." That was a murmured breath between the Alpha and his son; the Alpha stood near Tony and the small boy, a whispered of something shared between them before the Alpha kissed Tony the cheek causing his son to chuckle happily.
Steve felt like he was on the edge of another panic attack, Edith was telling him about his worst nightmare, a world where Thanos was still out there, planning, waiting, and where the Avengers are nothing but weak who still refused to fight like teammates, refused to trust in each other. This was just a recipe for a huge disaster.
The person was sitting near one of the rivers staring at the sky, with a pen in his hand and stacks of papers in the other writing something in them every few minutes, and he wondered to himself what the man was gazing at, so he floats toward the man and looked down on him hoping to see what he was writing, and he was answered by that when the man raised his head saying.
"I didn't mean that he gave me the formula to create the serum; he gave me the serum and told me to hide it before he disappears, God's know where." Howard rolled his eyes, giving an annoying sigh as he starts looking at his nails. "Think of it that way; now the Omega has a chance to survive the poison. Even if his chances are slim; if the Omega survived, not only will he be healthy and never suffer from any disease again, but you could even make a cure for your son, using his blood that holds the serum." Howard stated, making Tony swallow and hold back his sob from bubbling up.
"Wait, what? What do you mean reject? Stark! What did you do?" Bucky screamed as he took a threatening step toward Tony, planning to kill the man and hide his body in the cemetery that Steve created in the backyard, how dare that man try and seduce his Stevie?
"Yes? Your point is?" Tony snapped as he walked toward the fridge, grumbling when he got a frozen yogurt out. He needed to do a bit of grocery shopping, but then that meant risking to leave his lab, and Tony wasn't a fool to order his food like he used to, especially when he heard all of his teammates were planning his death after that night Rogers asked him out. And eating poisoned food was the worst way to go, even if it wasn't the first time that Tony had eaten poisoned food, still it was the principle of the thing!
He remembered days sitting near the fireplace, both of them choosing the names they loved the most for their children, both of them planning where they are going to live, the places they will visit. Days exchanging kisses and promises and their hope for the future that betrayed the two of them in the end; Steve wanted to say that he was sorry, he wanted to go inside and plea with Tony to stop, he wanted to plead with him and tell him to always look up for the future, because if he didn't, then who would? Steve can never look far away, fear always holding back, but Tony can, he can and he will even if Steve had to drill it in his thick head.
The Alpha only scowl darkly at Steven and walked up the stairs glancing darkly at the Omega ordering him to follow the man. "This is your room…" The Alpha said when they reached the end of the stairs and the Omega pursed his lips at the bare space in front of him having nothing but a few furs in the farthest corner of the room as a substitute of a bed Steven bite the inside of his cheek and raise his eyebrow at the mocking and knowing look in the king's eyes and he went to the window near the fur and opening it to see that he was in the attic of the house… a big house indeed to have three stories in it. "You can change your mind, you can go back on your deal and return home no one will think less of you if you did, we both can forget about this, I will even escort you to your family… just say the word…" Starkad said with a gentle voice hoping that the Omega will regain his mind and stop this foolishness right here, right now, without humiliating himself more than he already did.
" Like a guitar string plucked, the words reverberate down the line of their bond, settling deep in Tony and wrapping him with contentment. Knowing Steve will be there when he wakes up; Tony settled against his husband and slept.
"What? You have?" His mother squeaked at that and Tony had to hide his snort, he hides his smirk with the juice cup, his father was looking at him with narrow eyes but taking a sip out of his wine, and Angie was awing making Aunt Peggy throw a glare at her to be quite.
Waking up, Tony wiped his eyes as he tried to wipe the trace of sleep and tears from his eyes, frowning when he noticed that he was sleeping on something soft; that made Tony snap his eyes open and sit so fast that he became dizzy, it took a few minutes before everything was clear and the dizziness left Tony, who looked around the place with wide eyes, taking in the strange bedroom he was sleeping in. "What…?" Tony whispered, fear lacing in his voice as he sat slowly, making sure not to justly his baby who was sleeping contently beside him, looking around the room he was in, Tony frowned at the different but similar room. Tony froze in his place, his voice leaving him when his eyes fell on a rocking chair beside the bed… a rocking chair that has Steven Grant Rogers sitting in it with what looked like a sketchbook in his lap.
The next thing the Omega did was going to that room, that disgusting room that fueled on Tony's nightmares and hopes. Tony held back the loud snarl when his eyes took the room with wild eyes, growling as he took in the toys and crib and other necessities to every baby's room that were there. As fast as he could Tony went to the kitchen, taking trash bags and then returned to the room, shoving all the toys inside the trash bags, followed by baby clothes and other things that he could fit in the trash bags.
"But we are fated, mates… that means the two of us going to mate in the end." Tony said, a little self-conscious when he saw Dr. Ross frown at his words, she put her notebook and pen down looking at Tony in the eyes.
Steven could hear a sob or two at the news, a lot of them were smiling happily at each other with tears in their eyes, and it made Steven happy to see his friends happy.
At first, the other shareholders didn't agree with Steve, they even threatened to lock him out of the company. Things became rough after Obadiah Stane decided to 'return' back to SI and try to 'save' the company of his 'late' friend from Steve's delusional visions. Steve was grateful for Pepper Potts, the PA that Peggy and Howard hire for him to help him in his quest, and Steve knows that without the strawberry hair Beta, he would have been doomed…
"You will see." Steve said with a grin as he wore the mask and Tony had to stop himself from squealing loudly as his eyes widened not believing what he was seeing. As soon as Steve wore the mask, his face changed, instead of the clean-shaved face he saw a few second ago, a bearded man was standing in front of him, his facial hair was dark brown and he had a sky blue eyes, not the sapphire blue Steve had a second ago, his hair also changed color, instead of the blond it was, now a dark brown hair greeted him. Steve looked so different! There were some similarities, but if Tony didn't know any better he would have thought the man was stranger.
For more than two thousand years, ever since he was created, not once did he choose a name, and why would he when he has all the time in the world? Sara chooses her name Saraious after three thousand years of her creation, and then she changes it because he always loved calling her by Sara, simple and short. But Antonette just gave him a name, a name that will be a reminder to him when she was going to leave him alone in this world when she passed, and it will hurt when he will hold into that name, it will break him day after day for all eternity, but for Antonette, for his beautiful darling, he would, he would carry the name and be Steven even if it hurt, as long as his beautiful beloved will smile.
"Then I suggest that you get your shit together, I tried to explain to Steve what happened but that punk refuses to hear the whole story, though I did tell him enough that he will be intrigued and let you explain." Bucky said as he put his phone in his pocket, which made Tony swallow as hope to start blooming in his chest.
After Antonette came Tova from Russia, a loving father of three, he loved his children so much, Tova died saving his youngest from falling into an iced lake, he died frozen to death… after Tova came Tonja from India, and it was kind of a funny thing because in that life Anton was born as a tiger, Tonja was one of the Maharajah's favorite pets, Steven had to stop himself from growling in disgust and pain every time he remembered how they killed Tonja to get his bones for witchcraft, so much for being favorite… after Tonja came Antonio from Italy, the man owned a beaker and was proud of his food, he was happily running the place with his sister who was expecting a son on the way… After Antonio there was Anthony from Britain who was never happy because he was forced to hide who he was, forced to hide that he was in love with his stable boy, and was never in love with his fiancé… after that, there was Andon from France, who was able to live with his male lover peacefully in the countryside… and then there were so many others that Steven lost count, but he knew their names and stories by heart.
And Tony thinks that he liked that kind of love, no, he knows that he liked it, the warmth that seeped into his bones calming his fried nerves down and making him feel home, making him feel special. Because if there was something that Tony learned, the fire will always fad away after a while, leaving the painful remains in its place, making the edges sharper, and the pain more real, not like the warmth that will remind with you every time you breathe, every time you return home and be greeted with a rush of warmth that will protect you from the freezing coldness of the harsh world outside.
The next month turned out to be more peaceful than Tony imagined; which he was thankful for. The earth was still spinning, Tony still has his baby that he was trying to take care of, the town is peaceful and quiet with many friendly faces who won't hesitate to lend a helping hand, and Tony was becoming fatter every day; other than the important issue of him getting fat, everything is good, more than good, it was fantastic, and Tony was finally getting the sleep he deserves.
"A village that is three days' journey from here, after crossing the mountain in the north follow the river in the forest and you will reach it… though it was destroyed six years ago by the Hydra King." The Alpha said which got him a nod from the Omega, but nothing more, which made the dark-haired man concern and he turned his gaze to the Omega who has an emotionless face, now and then until they reached their destination. "This is what you seek my queen, the house is where your people are." The Alpha said just as a woman rushed out of the house running toward the queen with teary eyes.
Harley narrowed his eyes when he saw the woman finally knocking on the door of their home, making Harley furrow his eyebrows when he saw the woman nearly entered their house when Mr. Tony opened the door to her. Harley saw how Tony frowned harshly as he closed the door behind him causing Harley to clinch his hands when he saw the woman trying to cage Mr. Tony.
Howard stayed silent, his scowl deepens as his gaze turned to Tony once more, seeing his son's eyes becoming duller and duller as minutes passed and his mate become unresponsive to his plea. "I never claimed I was a good man, Jarvis, and you know that, everyone knows that; probably why you all left in the end." Howard said in a monotone voice, his eyes widen for a fraction when he saw Maria walking as fast as she can to the room that housed Tony and his mate. at the sight of his mother, Tony starts crying once more, pain and hurt and agony clear in every sob he let out, causing Maria to choke and rush toward her son.
Howard and Sarah still didn't see eye to eye; Sarah because she was still doubtful of the new Alpha she hasn't seen a hide or hair from in the past few years since she has known Tony. And Howard because he doesn't trust Sarah around Tony; that and maybe because Howard did some spying and God knows what and discovered how Sarah oppose the wedding at first, which mean stopping Tony's happiness, which meant that Sarah was on Howard's enemy list until proven wrong. Tony hoped that the two of them had figured things out and were at least soft of friends that they won't kill each other now.
But the thing is, Natasha knew she had competition, and her biggest threat yet, was Barnes. After all, the man was Rogers' best friend since childhood, and if she wanted to have Rogers to herself, then she needed to get rid of Barnes… or maybe she needed to lay a spell on Rogers so that he will fall in love with her, after all, she did hear the man say that he admires Enchantress for trying to trap Thor in her sexual spell the other day… maybe she will get in contact with one of her old buddies from her dark days…
At that time, he met a lot of stars, interesting ones too, how they always fly in the sky in their Astral Forms, which Sara taught him how to do, which was fun, to be honest. So with that, he spent the first five hundred years of his life with Sarah and the other stars, playing and flying in their Astral Forms enjoying themselves and looks at what happened in the nine realms, writing its history down, steering away from Muspelheim most of the times, and gazing at the beauty that was their world, though, Sara made sure that he never let his eyes steer to Midgard, something about that realm causing nothing but pain and heartache, he never asked Sara about that, and she never told him why, so he let it drop.
With one last glance in Harley's direction, Tony left the room quietly closing the door behind him as he went down, going to the laundry room, and putting Harley's clothes in the washing machine before heading to the kitchen. Tony's lips couldn't help but twitch up when he started hearing Steve and Peter's voices as he went inside the kitchen, no doubt the two of them arguing about Peter's need to wake Harley so the two of them will go and play.
' at the Alpha's face. "The amulet protected me, and for that, I am grateful to you." The harsh frown caused the man to flinch once more, especially when Steven continued to glare at him without stopping. "I am truly sorry, I truly am; that is why I wanted to give you this as my token for an apology." The king said before he nearly run into his workshop, hoping for safety no doubt from Steven who decided that breaking the king's empty head is better than going back to his people's hut. "Here, please, do not kill me; I had enough facing a bear as it is." The king stated, thrusting a Shield in Steven's way causing the man to glare at the Alpha when he stumbled a few steps back.
Serpentine gave a sharp and shocked gasp as she gazed at Tony, and Tony would have thought the woman was exaggerating if it wasn't for the truly shocked and horrified look in her eyes, even the dolls that crawled in the kitchen, they dropped everything in their tiny arms and turned their head toward Tony, gazing at him with what could have been shocked as tiny chokes like gasps left them… OK… what's going on? "Y-you think that an Addams… abuses their
"First of all, that's an insult to all invalid people out there so watch it." Clint said as he winked at Tony, causing the teen to roll his eyes. "Secondly, even after three months, a city boy like you won't understand the finer details of small-town life. We look out for each other… actually, we stick our noses in other people's business." Clint wiggled his eyebrows at that making Tony snort and shakes his head but the smile took over his face.
"A ghost?" Pepper perked up, holding up her cup for a refill. "You have ghosts?" She asked once more, only for Angie to pause in her place for a second too long, Tony tensed in his place waiting for what's going to happen, only for Angie to start laughing out loud while shaking her head and waving the jug toward Tony.
"Calm down! Goddammit, Tony!" Tony heard a familiar voice snapping at him, which caused Tony to stop in his place before throwing the book in his hand; calming down a little, Tony shake in his place when he saw the shadows that were standing in front of him not a few seconds ago melt away, and in their places stood Bucky and Peggy, both of them looked worried and a little shocked, Peggy more than Bucky as her eyes darted around the place looking at the playroom in shock and confusion. "Are you calm now?" Bucky asked and Tony couldn't help it, he finally snapped.
"I see, if you excuse us ladies, my fiancé and I had an urgent matter to discuss." Tony stated ignoring the shrieks the women let out when they heard the word 'fiancé'. Steve on the other hand just smiled widely and accept being led by Tony, who wanted to be as far away as he can from the party and everyone in it; it was only when Tony and Steve went into the balcony that Tony finally let Steve go, hate and anger war inside of him as he remembered how Ty dared to show his face after years and years of absence. "You wanted his name, right?" Tony asked turning to Steve who tilted his head in confusion. "The person who raised his hand at me?" Tony clarified, and Steve's face became blank as a statue before nodding his head. "What will you do if I tell you his name?" Tony asked, wanting to know what Steve's answer will be, Tony
Another part of Tony told him that the two of them were obviously acting once more, it wasn't strange that the two of them would, it wasn't the first time nor would it be the last time with those two lying to him like that. Tony though, shook his head at that thought, even if they were acting, their eyes would have exposed them, their eyes would probably dart around the place, wondering what happened and from where that blood was, wondering if Tony was killed or he had killed someone. Their eyes were too calm for people who can see the destruction in his house.
The phone's ringing made Steve look at the screen and smile after seeing that it was Cassie. "Hey, Cassie… Cassie! calm down, what's going on?" Steve called out trying to make the woman that was crying hysterically on the other line calm down. What Steve heard made his heart stop, he didn't realize that everything he bought was now lying on the floor, that he let it go from the shock, it was a few seconds later that Steve starts running in top speed, hoping to reach the hospital before it's too late…
They drove to Angie's diner, Tony smiling happily when he saw the awe on his friends' faces as they took the small town, more amazing and beautiful than even New York that Tony used to take a pride in before his father tainted that place. When they reached Angie's diner, it couldn't be any more amazing timing, considering that Tony was starving; it's a cheerful little place, with a beige brick frontage and large windows, the area around the door densely plastered with posters and adverts for local events and fundraisers. Inside the walls are painted pale blues and white, a blackboard along one side where the day's specials are scrawled. There are a few people tucked in the booths having a late lunch, eating, and chatting quietly.
"Tony… do you think that your father and Mrs. Carter are like Stane?" The Beta asked which made the Omega shake his head 'No' and wiped his glassy eyes hoping that no tear was going to fall. "Then tell me, will your family allow you to go near any Alpha that will wish you harm, even if it was their close friend?" That also got a head shake which made the woman smile. "Another question, do you believe that Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, one of the active figures that always fights for Omegas' rights, who spent his life fighting bullies, will ever hurt an Omega, and an Omega that is close to him?" Tony paused at her question and start thinking about the answer; he then looked at her and shook his head which made her give a small smile. "It's OK to be afraid; Tony… it's nothing to be ashamed of. No one is forcing you to be with someone who you don't like, you are the one who chooses what's going to happen in your life… sometimes, it's better to take a step back and observe…" Dr. Ross's words made Tony bite his lip in deep thoughts.
Tony's eyes were wide as he took in Stane's words; his breath was erected as he tried to make sense of what Stane just spit at him. It can't be, it just can't, it can't! Ty was just a ghost from his imagination, he wasn't real, he wasn't! If Ty was real then Angie, Natasha, Clint, Bucky, Peggy, or any Goddammit one in the town would have pointed that to him; they would have looked at him and told him Ty was real. "There is no one in the town by the name Ty, so you are probably wrong." Tony stated, feeling a little pride when his voice didn't break and show Stane how affected he was, unlike his brain that nearly stopped working.
"Are you a fool?" Jamti snapped, his words causing Anton to wince and look away from his angry friend, Anton already knows that he was foolish and an idiot, no need to remind him of that. "Not only you shoved yourself in a matter that does not concern you, but you also insulted the queen who did nothing but try to show you goodwill! Why?" Jamti huffed, his hands running through his head before returning to glare at Anton, his eyes promising him a painful hunting trip and a visit from Magna later. "Why did you say such a thing?! You are not the queen's guardian, nor are you
"It was found in the treasure room, hidden in a secret room." Steven's breath hitched at that, years of trying to search for his Shield and his weapon was under his nose all along, how humiliating… though, Steven couldn't help but swallow, wondering in the back of his mind about the price the Alpha in front of him wanted for the Shield. "I want nothing in exchange for this gift, only the hope of starting once again." The Alpha said, causing Steven to press his lips tightly as he swallowed, his eyes misting as he continued to gaze at the Shield.
"OK, enough!" Steven's booming voice made everyone freeze in their place, especially the disappointing tone in his voice. "Clint stop fucking laughing and stand up, why the hell will you eat when you know that we will be traveling to space? Thor gets yourself together and go take a shower and change into clean clothes, and for God's sake stop screaming!" Steven's commanding voice made everyone shut up, Clint stood with the help of Natasha, trying not to look at Steven who was glaring at everyone, Thor grumbled and hissed at Clint before using his hammer to sail into the sky and head toward the palace to change his clothes, that left everyone shuffling on their feet looking at Steven who turns his face toward the small rounded stage in the middle, only to see the gatekeeper looking at them with a blank face.
"Mr. Carbonell, it's so good to see you again!" Dr. Cho called out making Tony look up from his magazine with a happy smile. The older Beta never felt as happy as she did when she saw the young Omega again, he was glowing, that made her smile happily.
Tony looked at his mail than at the pair, biting his lower lip before taking a deep breath and going toward the pair. "Is everything OK?" Tony asked as soon as he reached the pair, smiling when Peter squealed his name and run toward him to hug him, which made the Omega give a little chuckle at that. "Hello to you too, bambino, how are you?" Tony cooed which made the pup chirp out a 'Fine!' that made the Omega look at the Alpha trying to contain his wince at the dark circles surrounding the Alpha's eyes, he looked like a raccoon. "Steve, what's going on, you don't look fine?" Tony asked the Alpha gently when the pup skipped to one of the bushed in Sarah's front yard and start playing with his toy near it.
"B-but I swear I'm n-not lying, it happened!" Tony's voice cracked at the end, he tried to stop the scream of frustration from getting out. "If… if it wasn't true then why everyone is crowding outside, and what was written on the wall?" Tony asked, his voice take note of desperation in it, hoping that they will believe him.
"Mr. Stark… I didn't expect I will see you here." Said a voice behind Tony which made the Omega look behind him to see Steve Rogers looking at him with a soft look causing the Omega to smile amusingly at that and shake his head a little at that.
"I'm coming Ma! Jesus! Can't someone have a cold drink of water in peace?" Tony lean to the side to see the owner of the new voice as he walked out of the house with a scowl on his face, Tony blink a little in surprise as he saw a person who looked a little like George walk out of the house with a long sleeve shirt and a glove on his left hand.
"Brat, that's what you are…" Steve said as he starts tickling his son, which got him a squeal from the boy as giggles and laughter fell out of Peter's lips, Peter was desperately trying to get free from Steve's clutch that he wiggled like a fish out of water. "Think of it like this…" Steve stated after he let go of Peter, deciding to take a new approach to the matter, considering that his son thinks that it's within his right to marry Tony, something if the Omega heard about, no doubt he will find cute. "If I married Tony, making him my mate, and your Mama, he will belong to us." Steve explained, hoping that this approach will be better than the one before, if it doesn't work then that meant he will have to go to Tony for help, which the Omega won't let him live it down.
"Safe? Safe? You sure as hell have a strange definition for the word safe!" Tony screamed his breath coming out in harsh pants as he glared at Bucky and Peggy. "What is safe when I am constantly being haunted by your
Raising her head the Omega let out a breath she didn't know she was holding when she saw that the front door was opened, did the Omega really gave her an invitation to his domain even when she didn't deserve it? Maria thought to herself watching the open door for five minutes straight before finally gaining the courage and got out of the car and walking toward the door, every step she took made her heart pound in her chest like a crazy, she was about to meet her son's mate and child.
It was some hours before dawn, the light of a waning moon filtering through the curtains-covered windows, painting the house in shades of black and grey. Something scrapes across the underside of the floorboards under the bed, sharp nails dragging along the hardwood. And Tony could only press his face to the pillow, trying to muffle any sound that might slip out of his mouth, and keeps still, tracking the sound as it moves across the floor, shaking as he waited for what will happen next.
Tony nodded his head after a few minutes of him thinking hard. "Thank you… for understanding…" Hearing that made Steven smile a little then he turned his head to Tony.
Tony let out a sigh as he stood in the sidewalk waiting for the lights to turn red. A year pass since he last talked to his father, not from the leak of trying on his father side, since he left him at the hospital and went to search for his son that was out there ignoring his father's calls, his father pulled through in the end, Tony knew he would, his father was strong after all, but that didn't mean Tony forgave him, on the contrary, his father had lost him that day, no matter what his father did after that, no matter how much he followed Tony and begged for him to hear him out, no matter how much he called and left messages and plea with the Omega, Tony didn't pay his father that much attention, as much as he wanted to quit from his job at SI he couldn't, if the child services were going to bring him his child then he need to prove to them that he had a stable job and home, and his job at SI was the only way for that, even if it meant he had to endure his father always barging in his lab to plead with him to talk things out.
"You are late…" Steve stated as he shifted from foot to foot, causing Tony's face to fall, but Steve didn't care about that, not when Tony already ruined this special day for them, not when he refused to even come with him since the start of the pregnancy; Tony has to hear what Steve was going to say, even when it hurt to think about it. "You said you took a vacation and that the two of us will spend more time together… you lied Tony, you lied to me… you know I was excited about today, God knows that even Bucky get bored of hearing me harp about this day for weeks; the last thing you could have done was dropping me here if you didn't want to show up, not leaving me alone wondering when are you coming home…" Steve whispered, being grateful that Bucky moved away from the two to give them a little bit of privacy.
"Say, Steve… can I do something without you ripping my balls?" Tony asked just to be on the safe side, and his words got a confused noise from the Omega, but the man already raised and twisted himself, so that he was facing the Omega, before pulling the Omega into a kiss not wanting the courage to leave him and Tony shuddering to the core as he tasted those pink lips after all these years. When Tony pulled back he can see the shock on Steve's face, and he wondered if it was too fast, if he already destroyed whatever chance he had by making this rash decision.
It was two years since Tony was back, his heart breaking to millions of pieces as he took in his tired mother, who looked more worn out and stressed as the days passed. His mother looked like she went through hell, but at least she got out of it with strength that she didn't possess back then, with confidence in her steps that Tony never saw before. Tony could only cry as he had held his mother, letting her comfort him as he told her what happened ever since he left home, he told her about the strange town, and its strange people, and the strange monster in the lake that saved and protected Tony and Morgan many, many times over the past two years since Tony was away.
"Baby, Mama really need to go, I promise I will be back in a little while, Papa will be with you all the time, he won't let anything bad happen." Tony whispered gently which made the pup sniffle at that and whimper. "Please baby, can you be a little hero and stay strong for me?" Tony said as he leans back to look at Peter's face, the pup was sniffing and tearing up, but he nodded his head clutching his toy tightly when Tony gave it to the pup. "That's my strong baby." Tony whispered after wiping the tears away causing Peter to sniff at that. Tony stood up then and raised his son in his arms, entering the room that has toys scattered on the floor, drawings pinned to the walls, and small chairs and rounded desks around the place, it made Tony hold his pup a little bit tighter as he reached Steve who instructs all the pups to sit down, so they will start drawing and coloring. "Rogers." Tony said which made the Alpha turn to Tony who was glaring at him. "Take care of Peter, and if anything happens to him it's your head." The Omega hissed in the Alpha's ear, after putting the pup down which made Steve nod his head and gently steer Peter to introduce him to the other children.
"That I am Officer Natalia Rushman." Tony said coldly after he read her badge, which made the woman look at him strangely than at the pup who refused to let go of Tony, as for the Omega, he was tense, waiting for any minute now, any second now for the woman to snap and take the child away from him.
"What are you thinking of, sweetheart?" Steve's voice snapped Tony out of his daze, causing the Omega to blink his eyes and turn to the Alpha with a smile when he saw Steve coming with their breakfast. It was a few more seconds before Steve was sitting with him on the bed, the tray loaded with their delicious breakfast balance carefully on his lab, as he started feeding Tony, making the Omega purr and lean on his Alpha's side.
When Steve finished the tests he left the room only to see Howard waiting for him, which made Steve swallow and stood in front of Howard, waiting for what the older man was going to do. Howard looked at Steve with cold and empty eyes, it made the other Alpha tense, ready to receive the hits his friend was going to lay on him, but the other man just sighed from his nose and turn toward Steve. "The day I found Tony's journal, I was in his room, I couldn't believe that my beautiful and smart son was lost forever, I just couldn't." Howard swallowed at that, trying to collect his thought. "I read the whole journal in one day… there was a map in his journal, he talked about the possible location that 'Captain America' may be buried in… there was only one dot on the map, with the words 'He is trapped in a mountain of ice' I never knew what it meant, but his seventeenth birthday was coming, so I did what Tony wrote, I went toward that dot and searched for that mountain he talked about, and behold, there you were." That made Steve fidgets, looking at the floor in shame, not knowing what to do. "He wrote at the end of his journal about the voice he continued to hear, never know what it was until you talked about it today…. I will only say this one time Rogers, if you hurt my son or his pup, I will bury you under the same ice I found you in, understood?" Howard's voice cracked, in the end, making Steve look at his friend with determent eyes.
Tony pouted, trying to ignore the sting of humiliation, pain, and rejection, which was not a first since Tony had to get used to it for nearly half of his life. Tony raised a hammer and start hammering his armor, and he was 2034% sure that he was trying to destroy the armor and not fix a thing about it; not that Tony cared, he was still salty about what took a place not a few hours ago.
The sound of children screaming and something crashing inside of the house, made both Tony and Steve jump and the two of them rushed inside with hearts pounding loudly in their chests as fear took a grip of them, when they reached the room that the crashing sound came from, the only room that Tony never let Steve nor Peter go inside or come near, Steve can see how Tony's face pale and how he froze in his place before walking on wobbly legs toward the door and push it open.
"Beautiful…" Tony said under his breath which made the woman turn to look at him, making the small teen smile. "Nothing…" Tony said with a head shake, already making a mental list of the things that he needed to buy, his baby's room, his room, maybe turning one of the bedrooms into an office, or a lab? He wondered if the boathouse has a normal rowing boat or a speeding boat, thinking of all the possibility he has right now, planning to send a 'Thank You' basket to that man Philips who gave him directions to this town, a small town away from everyone, a town that probably everyone in it knows the other, and will know of any outsider coming in… a small town perfect for raising his baby... and most importantly it wasn't mentioned on any map…
"Coming!" A cheerful voice called out, making the woman tense as she waited for the unenviable, wondering if she made a mistake coming here, but not having it in her to back away; the door opened slowly, and the woman stood straight, accepting what is to come with a brave look on her face. "Oh… hello, can I help you, Ma'am?" The young man who opened the door asked, and the woman's eyes could only get wider at the familiar face she was seeing if only she can put a time or a place to the youth that was looking at her with concern.
Tony closed his eyes as he took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down, especially when he felt Rogers' arms around him as he nuzzled into Tony's cheek and talked about how he wanted to make the brunette proud and how much he loved him… again. "Actually I'm very, very, very disappointed with you…" Tony said through gritted teeth which seemed to freeze the man in his place, and Tony doesn't even need to turn around to see the shocked and confused face. "In fact, I'm so disappointed that I don't want to see your face ever again, and if I do I will call Hydra's personal phone number personally and give you back to them." Tony took the bottle of the holy water from his pocket and opened it, throwing the content of it at Rogers who was latching into him, drenching himself and the man with the liquid, causing the said man to let go and jump away from him like he was burned, and Tony rolled his eyes at the teary wide eyes that were looking at him with so much betrayal and hurt. "Your last warning Rogers, you do something else, and it will be more than holy water next." Tony hissed at the man like an angry cat, ready to fight, already preparing himself for what to come.
"Too early? Nothing is too early when it comes to the Carbonell family! We are born geniuses you know?" Tony joked, causing the woman's lips to twitch up at that, score! Tony wanted to cheers; he just needed to talk Maria up for a few more minutes to gain her trust before going on his quest of finding what he needed.
"S-sir?" He questioned opening his eyes a little. "R-run!" Jarvis tried to say but a harsh cough cut him.
"My, my, look who finally decided to show up! And with a cutie pie too!" The Omega cooed as she said that, which made the pup shiver and hide behind Tony's legs which made the Omega mouth 'Sorry' for his friend, causing her to give him a small smile of concern. "So what do I own this pleasurable visit?" Darcy said as she saw a huge Alpha lowering himself down and pull the shivering pup in his embrace whispering in his ear, making the pup hide his face in the Alpha's neck.
"But that Mister was sad! He was all alone crying I couldn't leave him alone!" Peter said as he pulled on his father's fingers to steer him toward Tony, the Omega wondered if he could hightail it fast without the Alpha catching him, it would be bad if that Alpha thought he was going to steal his pup.
"How are you doing, Peter?" Steve asked after he took their plates and put them in the sink which made Peter smile and chirps out '
Tony sat in the hard plastic chair thinking, as soon as he got the life-changing news from those sticks, he made sure to make an appointment with the Omegas' clinic near him, mainly in hope that the sticks are wrong and he was baby-free, but if he was… Tony swallows at that and clenches his shaking hands into fists. For a week now, Tony had been thinking about his options, about the baby, and about what he was going to do.
Tony gasp for his breaths sending a glare toward Steve who didn't even have a hair out of its place and was looking at him with a smile, which made the Omega glared at the Alpha hard. A month had passed since Tony's first therapy session, a month since he asked Steve to teach him how to fight, and he hated that he spent half of that time on his back! It was just impossible to one-up the Alpha, though Steve always praises him, saying that Tony was the first person who could go against him and not lose in the first five minutes, which Tony know that this was a bullshit cause he saw Steve and Natasha fight one day and his jaw nearly fell on the floor from how fast the two of them were fighting, if the Omega didn't know any better he would have thought that the two of them were dancing their own dance, and as much as Tony hated to admit it, it made him a little jealous seeing them like that.
Awkward silence took over the place, and Tony swallowed, holding Peter tightly in his arms before he stood up, his mind already made up. "Come on Steve, let's get you to a room; you look like you are going to drop dead." Tony started herding Steve when he stood up, planning on giving Steve one of the rooms beside his and Peter's.
"That still does not explain why you are beside my bed, foolish king," Steven stated dryly, not even reacting when all he got from the king was an eye roll as the king put the scroll away, probably in the attempt to protect it if this friendly chat turned into a fight, which it would, all of Steven and the king's interactions ended up that way. Steven though was too tired to start their normal insults that will spark the fire of their fight.
Tony waved his hand jokingly as he said that cursed name, he tried to pretend that he wasn't breaking on the inside that his heart wasn't bleeding, that he could make do with it if Steve came back, he will be whatever Steve wanted him to be…
Married… Tony was married to Pepper… how? How was that even possible? Were Bucky and Peggy really telling the truth? Was Steve really married to Bucky all along and his life with Tony was nothing but a distant dream? It felt so real though… so real that Steve was having a hard time believing that Bucky was the right one all along.
Steve's hands were shaking; they didn't stop shaking ever since all this madness took a place. Steve wondered in the back of his mind, he wondered what would have happened to him if he overslept or if he wasn't fast enough to hide in the bathroom. The answers Steve kept getting did nothing but made his heart stop for a few seconds in terror before the dark fate of his baby came to mind. Steve was lucky this time, but who said he would be the next time something like this happened once more?
Steve paused when he was putting the cups and turned to Jarvis with a tired look on his face, Steve never felt like eighty years old as he did now. "He had a pup…" Steve said, making Jarvis sit on the chair or he was going to lose his footing. "But he is sick Jarvis… I don't think he would make it, I don't know if it was TB, but he is so sick he smelled of death… he is so small, too small, and he… he called me Cap as if he knew me… and I…" Steve's voice broke and he could hear Jarvis' stuttering breath and sniffs as the Beta tried to calm himself.
The sound of the doorbell made Steve smile at Winnie who was making dinner and went to the door to see who was it, Steve thought it was probably May because it had been such a long time since he last saw her and Ben so he made sure to invited both of them to have dinner with him and the Barnes family.
"He is alive?" Tony starts sobbing when Steve nods his head at that. "They are all a-alive." Tony calmed himself down, wiping his tears away. "W-what about s-Stane?" Tony stuttered, and Steve bit the inside of his cheek as he heard the fear in the Omega's voice.
"That is the thing, Tony! You are not fine, you need help!" Steve said which made the Omega hiss at him like an angry cat making Steve sigh at that. "The panic attacks, the mistrust, the fear of any Alpha that cross the halls, Tony, this is not only hurting you, but it also hurt Peter, the pup couldn't be introduced to someone without him screaming and crying, this is not healthy, you are hurting yourself." Steve pleas trying to make the Omega see reason
"Do we have to? Why don't we stay in bed today?" Tony asked as he looked at the blond Alpha through his lashes, hoping to convince the Alpha to forget about work today and spent the time in bed with him, which gained him nothing but a chuckle from the Alpha and a kiss on the forehead as the Alpha detangled himself from Tony's arms and stood up, giving Tony a cheeky smile before going to the bathroom causing the Omega to huff but the happy smile never left his face…
It was like a dream; if Tony kept his eyes shut and just breathe the content and happy scent that has no pain and hurt linger in it. It almost seemed like an impossible dream; a dream he yearns for, a dream he spent years wishing for; it almost made Tony refuse to open his eyes. He just wants to stay in this warm and happy place, with Steve's content and healthy scent.
Tony didn't know if he wanted to cry in joy at the thought of someone believing him or whine in pain and fear at the idea of war knocking down on earth's door. "Wait, so you are telling me, that everything Tony just told us was true and not a nightmare, because of the witch's attack last week?" Clint asked slowly, looking divided between worried at the thought of Tony having a meltdown and terrified at the news of Thanos coming to earth.
"If you don't shut that trap of yours I will rip your tongue and feed it to you!" Steve snarled causing the raccoon to yelp in fear and click his mouth shut, looking at Steve with eyes that informed Steve about his succession in installing fear in the small rodent… Steve guessed he had to thank the stars' reputation of being the most violent bunch in the universe when crossed. A false adverting, but one that the stars enjoyed and craved because it gave them peace from many who dared to do something to them; stars by nature, are peaceful beings who loved helping, loved lightening the way for those who travel their domain, loved writing history and learning, they don't fight unless they had to.
“Of course I will take you there Steve, don’t worry, where is Tony though? I thought he was going to take you and Peter to the hospital.” Bucky tried to start a conversation as he followed Steve who rushed to Peter’s room, hoping that his baby did what he ordered him and change into his shoes.
They kiss each other over and over again, both humming into it. "Tony… Alpha… please…" Steve begged in between kisses, and Tony's body agrees with the urgency in his voice. He moved to pull away from Steve's sleeping pants, pulling all of the layers off without much finesse, and then Tony shrugged his own shirt and pants off.
"Oh, I'm fine thank you, the only thing that is bothering me is the cravings, I never ate this much fruits in my life," Tony said making the doctor give a small chuckle at that. In the past months, Tony had developed a crazy healthy diet because of the baby. He used to love burgers and sweets and everything in between, but it seems the baby had other thoughts. If he felt Tony coming near a burger or anything that contains fat, let's just say that he and the toilet seat became best friends over the last few months. The baby though adores cherry pie and red raspberry leaf tea, I mean what the hell? The kid practically flutters at the sight of fruits, fruits! Tony never thought he would have to eat this much of healthy food since he was ten and Jarvis was still alive.
It had been a few days since the heart to heart with the queen; a few days since Anton knew the reason for the hate between them and how justified it was. A few days since he knew about the oath breather that turned not only the queen's life upside down, but his as well; a few days of Anton nearly snarling at everyone and anyone who as much as looked in his direction, scaring them away and making them flee if they caught his shadow moving toward them. It had been a few days but to Anton, it felt like years and years; years that made Anton unbalanced, wondering what is he to do to gain the forgiveness he doesn't deserve but needed because it turned out that he was deceived by the person his village wanted him to wed.
"We are finished." Margaret said after taking a deep breath, to help calming herself down, and to stop her laughter at the queen's dark look while he was wearing the dress. The queen by no mean was a small Omega like the rest of the Omegas in the palace, unlike any Omega out there, the queen has the figure of a warrior, a look that stayed with him even after years, a look that made the king rage, especially when the queen was taller and muscular than the king himself, it always ended up with the king raging and raising his hand at the queen, but the queen was a warrior, if the king hit, he will hit back, never standstill… that was until the younger prince was brought up.
"And why would I do that?" Stane hissed at Steve, he throws himself at the soldier trying to attack him, only for the agents to restrain him. "Let me go! Don't you know who I am?" Stane snapped making Steve pause and waved to the agents to let him go, which made the agents look at one another and let the Alpha go.
' over and over again, trying to guide him even when Steve felt like he was about to collapse because of the nightmare in front of him. Thanos held Tony's injured head in his hand, he was preparing to kill Tony… what would Steve do?
The small boy Fury just saw the small boy was the Omega's babe; the Omega who attack Tyber with no care for his wellbeing, the Omega that was strong enough that it needed four grown Alphas to be able to hold him back from strangling Tyber to death. The Omega with blond hair and familiar build to a friend long since died; the Omega that caused Tyber to pale and shake in his place as if Queen Hela stood in front of him ready to take him to Hel and torture him for eternity.
