“Can people get on top of this?”, he asked with renewed interest, glad that being outside the States practically made them unrecognisable, even though Tony had a huge worldwide fame.
Steve scoffed at him as he stood up, following Tony quietly, having to bend his legs to fit through the door. He was excited, the prospect of turning back to human made his tail waggle in joy. That didn’t go unnoticed by Tony who just giggled to himself on their way to the lab.
Tony that we…knew. He came through a portal, he must belong in a different dimension, but I don’t know why he appeared here from all places.”, Reed explained, shiftily looking behind him, at another door.
Tony carried on watching, his eyes not leaving the stage at all, taking in all the jokes and sayings that got his attention, trying to memorize them for future reference. He didn't want to leave when the play was over and the actors left the stage, and it felt strange. He hadn’t thought he would enjoy himself so much. Then again, Steve's company also seemed to help.
“Yeah. Exciting, isn’t it?”
“Perhaps your mother is giving you a permission to carry on and do what you want,” Tony said with an encouraging smile. “Not being limited to having just friends in your life."
“More?” Steve asked. “No, Tony you just found a different part that was within you.
“Is that so?" Tony smiled.
Tony narrowed his eyes; being ordered around by someone else, especially when it came to a newcomer, wasn’t something he was looking forward to. “Did Nick tell you to say that too?”, he asked between his teeth.
“How?” Steve asked, moving closer to Tony, looking down at him with his light blue eyes filled with emotion.
Steve pursed his lips, “Just, while he’s gone, right? And I don’t want you to keep this recorded or anything, it’s between you and Me.”
Steve smiled. “Well.. we’re not done yet… we’ve made some progress but I had to come back, at least for a bit. See what I’ve missed.”
Steve turned around, smiling brightly as Bucky approached him, his missing arm replaced by a metallic one, a red haired woman holding his hand happily
Tony sighed contentedly as his fingers moved up to Steve’s hair, running through it as Steve carried on with the soft kisses. “If you liked it, we can do it again.”
“I’m glad this one is here..”, Steve muttered, kneeling down and pulling a wooden box out of the bottom of the closet, blowing to get rid of the dust and sitting on the floor, holding it close to him.
That was until Steve decided that he had to leave for a while; the Captain and Natasha were still affected by the fall of SHIELD and the Winter Soldier’s sudden reappearance. They didn’t talk much, but Tony knew that Steve was planning to leave, going after Bucky and trying to get him to remember who he was. Of course he offered to tag along, but Steve was right; he couldn’t leave the base of operations, and with the two of them being the co-leaders of the Avengers, at least one of them needed to stay in charge while the other was away.
Tony looked at the temple overlooking them and nodded. “I understand. You don’t have anywhere else to stay?” he asked. “Amongst friends or anything similar?”
Steve nodded, almost boyishly, his arms reaching up and holding Tony to his chest lightly. “I would like that,” he said, “and you can teach me your people's ways.”
The Captain nodded quite vaguely, pulling up the zipper of the coat completely and waiting for Tony to lead the way. He still felt lost, and the fact that he had no idea what to do made him really passive, almost like he was not caring about anything, which was probably the case by now.
“And with the wit of your words, once more I am quaking,” Steve replied, sarcasm echoing in his tone as he kept a firm grip of his shield, extremely protective over anything that was given to him. He wasn’t given a lot as his mother made sure he wasn’t spoiled, so when he was given gifts he clung to them with all of his heart. “Are you trying to steal my weapon, Spartan? Pillaging again?”
Steve nodded firmly, taking in a couple of sharp breaths as he tried to stop his body shaking. “Can we..?” he asked meekly.
“Well.. We are motored, this a job, remember? I was sent here because there was a tooth to collect. I can’t just ignore my task and go whenever I want...”
The looks they were giving to each other were nothing but hateful, the tension being at it’s peak as soon as they started circling each other.
“I know what PTSD stands for, I know you keep thinking about them and how you.. that you’re not going to see them again”, he carried on, softening his voice.
It was so strange and Tony could have sworn that the moment that his bright blue eyes under his helmet met the soldier’s frozen, beautiful face, he knew that this man was going to mean a lot more to him that he ever thought he would. When he woke up and was talked through everything that had happened during his ‘sleep’, after his initial fight with the Avengers, Tony sat by him and explained even more, even inviting him to Tony Stark’s jet to ‘show him the wonders of the modern world’. Spending just a day with Steve Rogers, not just Captain America made him realise years later, when he was standing next to Carol Danvers in his close friend’s funeral, his wet from the rain hair covering his eyes, that, the day he met Steve, that was the best day of his entire life.
“I'm not letting you die, dammit!”, Steve snapped, breathing out heavily. “You don’t get it, you don’t get this at all! If you die, everyone else dies with you!”
Much to his annoyance, Steve could read Tony like an open book. Tony noted how Steve seemed to fold his arms and watch him carefully, which caused him to move into his seat, feeling like Steve could see right through him. And he was right, Steve knew exactly how messed up, fragile and broken Tony was, which annoyed the young genius so much, that much that he locked the Captain away, refusing to let him in for days. He hated that, he despised it when people saw past his disguise, even if he let out desperate calls for someone to do that. With Steve though it was well.. different. The Captain seemed to respect Tony’s wishes after a while, not imposing himself and giving Tony all the space he wanted, which always ended up with Tony coming back for more of the soldier’s comfort.
“Well.. Steve..”
Steve graced his reply with a smirk, and he was sure that Tony picked up on that.
“What, me and Pepper?”, Tony blinked. “No, no, she’s engaged, actually. Her and Happy seem to be doing great, I’m really glad they’ve got each other”, he smiled. “Oh yes, Happy Hogan is actually my um.. chauffeur and part time bodyguard. He’s a close friend, he’s the guy who told me how to throw some good punches, helped with self defence and all, former boxer”
“I respect her wishes, and have seen men crumble, even wage war over love. I would much rather... not,” Steve lied. Of course he wanted to fall in love; his heart was lonely and he hated just standing there and watching while others found their loves, found someone to spend the rest of their lives with. But no one could ever touch him, so he was sentenced to a life of solitude.
Their voices were raising, this was getting nowhere, it was just another argument that none of them could win, but Tony was right in Steve’s mind, even though he would hate to admit that. Maybe in a sick twisted way, saving this Tony would make up for being responsible for every other Tony’s death. Not, it wasn't right, saving one soul while sacrificing many shouldn't be a solution, that was exactly what he preached to Tony and the Illuminati, and right now, he was becoming just like them, proving them right.
Tony was well known for being charming, so perhaps this was part of his game, but part of Steve wanted to believe that it was real, that he was liked and that he had made a friend. It somehow made the world feel smaller, less lonely. Even if this was a ploy, a clever stunt, he could live in ignorance for a while and imagine that someone actually liked him and appreciated his company. Because, in truth, that was all he'd ever wanted.
The Captain slowly pulled his hand away after a couple of moments, saluting at the grave and turning towards the exit. “Stark..? Tony? Thank you”, he said, not facing the other man. He was thanking him for everything, for the flowers, for bringing him here, for holding his hand, but he couldn’t bring himself to name the reasons why he was so thankful. Maybe he needed that human contact, to be reassured that he could carry on, for someone to push him, and so far, Tony was the one to offer all of those to him.
“What did I miss?”
“It’s a good look, this one on you”, he smiled, softer than he ever did before. “Kind of..makes things easier for me, you know.”
Tony smiled widely to him, looking down for a bit. “And to whom shall I express my gratitude, then? For meeting you?”
Tony was finishing preparing their meal when he noticed Steve, and he shook his head at him. “Good morning, I hope you’re hungry," he said as he passed him the meat and cut a piece of bread from their supplies, handing it to Steve. He bit on the hare's leg himself, used to doing those sorts of things; during his army training he had to look after his fellow soldiers and cooking for them was just a simple way to fulfil that duty.
Steve walked through the city, covering miles quickly, relying on his resources to keep him fit. This was where his training had finally come into play, and his constant trips up and down the mountains meant that his strong legs could endure such strain.
“Wait, when did he do all this?”, Steve gasped; he found it impossible for all this to have been prepared for him in the space of just a few hours.
Back in the Helicarrier, Loki was put under custody, but much  to everyone’s annoyance, he didn’t seem to be worried about this at all. Thinking like the soldier he was, Steve tried to gather as much information he could, especially from Thor to plan their next move, and it was then that Tony Stark walked inside the bridge, acting like he owned the god damn place. Steve threw him a couple of sharp looks as he demonstrated his excessive knowledge in a flashy way, immediately hitting it off with Bruce Banner, as they were going to work together. There was something however, that bugged Steve. This man had no intention to actually act like one of the rest; he wanted to be in charge. The way he paraded around, showing off, not respecting any of them and acting like he was best than the rest just annoyed him.
“Lab. Now. Bring Cap.”
What was more scary and frightening for Tony though, was how Steve was able to leave the room when they were arguing, how he did that with such an ease, only to come back hours later, always ending up with Tony apologising to him. No, it didn’t feel right. Tony wouldn’t tell that to anyone else, but he hated how low he seemed to drop just to get Steve’s attention and affection back. He was addicted to that soft pat on the head or the short hug that Steve gave him when they made up, and he knew that it was wrong. Tony was strong enough to shove everyone else away from his life, but Steve remained there, no matter what. When Steve came back into the room, his eyes dark, still affected by their fights (that Tony seemed to start every god damn time), Tony seemed that he lost control of his own body and emotions, begging for forgiveness. But what if that fucked up their relationship? What if one day, Tony’s apologies would mean nothing to Steve, what if the Captain would be ready to move on, realise how he was hurting himself and Tony, and decide that keeping his distance would do them both good?
Tony’s heart suddenly felt heavy. He stood up, leaving Steve at the spot as he moved inside, taking off his suit and sitting down, an empty stare painted on his face.
“That was Kang the Conqueror. Do you know him?”
“It was.. something.. but I’d rather hear you talking”, Steve said as he pushed back his hair and crossed his arms, unsure on how to act but keeping his calm nevertheless.
The blonde tried to hold his hand steady, tongue coming out as he focused, getting the piece between the two ends, letting out a content huff, only to lose his focus and drop it down to the floor, rushing to clean everything up.
“Of course I have a name!”, the fairy replied all offended and Steve noticed that his wings fluttered faster; oh no, his pouting was actually kind of cute. “I’m Tony”
Sitting on his bed that night after he he start feeling like himself again, he smiled as he held the small tooth wrapped in the napkin.
It was impressive, Steve had to hold himself back from whistling as he looked around at the paintings and furniture.
“Some..names, mainly”, Steve said, not sure if he was able to talk about that, but at that very moment, the only person he spent enough time with to build some level of ‘trust’ was oddly this man sitting opposite him. “Friends.. I want to see if any of them are..alive”, he said, straightening his back.
“Is that a better confession?”, he asked the soldier, not wanting to rub his lips, still able to taste Steve on them.
Steve turned to Tony, wanting to hear his answer. It was a common fact that Howard Stark was supplying the army with weapons and tech against the Germans, but according to what he gathered so far, Tony was focusing on renewable energy now, something completely different and not violent in the slightest.
Steve kept his head turned. He hated that if he spoke up then he would probably be corrected again, and he was very stubborn in his ways. He shook his head instead of dignifying Tony with an answer, keeping his nose held high in the air out of pure pride.
“And as son of a goddess, the son of Athena, do you refuse to help when others ask for your assistance? When you say that you will help them no matter what?” he finally said, not wanting to say those things out loud even as he spoke them. “You know, maybe you are right. Maybe I should go back to abusing my power and be feared. If the Gods can’t save me, nobody can, and I’m all right with that.”
Tony nodded and stood up, legs shaking, taking another look at the corpse on the table. It was so surreal; the man had his ebony hair and beard styled differently, and they did share some differences when it came to their facial structure, but that was him, he was sure of it.
The child of another god. It made sense to him for them to stick together, and that kiss surprised even himself; he never really liked anyone else in that way before.
“I would like to believe that you helped a lot with that," Tony said with another smile as he looked down, enjoying how peaceful it was up there, and how private they could be if they wished to.
“And it takes skill to wield it, and knowledge,” Steve said, smacking away the spear with all of his strength before grabbing Tony by the golden chain that kept his medallion on his neck, tugging it forward. Tony let out a cry and quickly punched Steve away when he got a hold of his medallion, pulling back and holding on it tightly, before gritting his teeth and making a move on Steve yet again, this time holding his sword.
Tony’s hope was renewed when the man smiled to him, even if his next words made him shake his head in disagreement. The man came all the way here to preach that people could change, and the moment that Tony decided to say the truth to him, that people cannot change, it seemed that all his hope was taken away from him. Tony blamed himself for that. But what was he doing? He was doing the blonde a favour; he had stopped giving him false hopes. But that felt too cruel.
Steve nodded. “I prefer being Steve, rather than the inquisitive man, the warrior,” he said, reaching over and cupping the side of Tony’s face to give him a friendly pat on the cheek. “I enjoyed watching the play too, and the market. And this.”
“The guys back at the training camp, it stuck, only my girl calls me James nowadays. She’s dropping by later, you should meet her.”
“I’m not sure.. we’ll have to wait and see”, Tony said, even though he didn’t dare to mention that Steve was going to be the centre of the conversation, most likely.
“Don’t die,” Steve said, kissing Tony softly to hide how much he wished his next words would be true. “I need you to save my people.”
, the first man said, taking a swing from his drink.
“Tony, Captain America might not be here now but.. I hope that Steve Rogers is good enough for you..”, he said softly.
“But you have now,” Tony insisted as he examined a spear nearby. “You showing up at Sparta wasn’t pointless. You already taught me a couple of things.”
Tony finished his broth and sat back.
“Like I said, too perfect”, Tony added.
They both fell into the swimming pool, confused as to why that happened.
“Shut your mouth!”, Steve yelled, feeling his fingernails digging into his skin, clenching his fists so hard, even through the red, thick gloves.
Tony couldn’t help but smile and place a soft kiss on the blonde’s cheek. “We don’t need this to make it happen”, he whispered gently, snapping a photo of the padlock with his phone. That particular side of Steve, the innocent, careless one, always amazed him, and he grew so fond of it, glad to be privileged enough to see it ever so often.
Steve raised his head and looked at Tony, biting his lip. “Tony, this is, It’s...” He said at a loss for words.
“So, who is this mysterious man that I need to meet?”, Tony asked him as soon as he stepped inside the kitchen; it was so strange, he was working on modifying his Tower to accommodate the Avengers if he had to, and to see that this was really the case in this universe, really urged him to put his plan in motion.
Without saying anything more, Steve jolted over the air, getting higher and higher while he flew around the terrace, ending up hovering just above the swimming pool. Tony had no idea what urged him to get closer, mesmerised by the way the blond’s hair was moving against the wind, how brightly his azure eyes were glowing, how red his cherry lips were or how firm his grip on him was, but he moved towards those lips, and he could have sworn that for a split moment, Steve did the same-
Steve took a couple of deep breaths and placed the key in the hole, before turning it around and opening the door slightly, before pushing it completely open.
Steve narrowed his eyes as he leaned closer, the presentation on the screen showing different blueprints, switching to different figures of people who were missing limbs with prosthetics attached to them. They didn’t look like simple prosthetics tho, they looked almost..robotic, equipped with weapons and all kinds of functions that could help them in the field.
“Right,” Tony said. “Either way, I apologize.”
Steve didn’t reply, but something told him that this was quite the touchy subject. He coughed. “I don’t like this, he gave up way too easily”, he noticed, pointing at Loki with a shake of his head.
Then there was Sparta, one of the most feared cities, ruled by Ares, god of war, keen to exert its power through its infamous army. However, its structures rivalled that of Athens, possessing its own unique buildings that were often larger, and projected dominance in the way that they were composed. Whilst Athens was proud of its scenery and natural beauty, Spartans were filled with determination to compete, and thus saw it as their own duty to make their city more superior than any other in Greece.
There was no turning back now, or rather, if there was a possibility of staying out of this, he wouldn’t take it. He was confident, sure of his choice, and a huge part of him was internally screaming, eager to walk again after so many months of depending on that wheelchair to move himself around. He would be able to look at others straight in the eyes once again, his spirit was going to be repaired.
Tony walked a little closer, hesitantly hugging Steve’s waist to resting his head on his chest. “I like this very much, I don’t want it to change.”
Next thing they knew, they could all hear the thunder and someone that could only be Thor rushed in the jet and flew outside with their prisoner.
“Did they say who they are?”, Steve asked. He didn’t normally have visitors, besides the usual officials, but since he kept declining their offers, they stopped coming over.
Steve’s eyes narrowed. “I’ll be on my way.”, he replied, hanging up on him. Of course he couldn't trust the Illuminati, but Reed’s words sure worried him. The fact that he called him before anyone else also raised an alarm; it really was an important matter that he needed to deal with.
The way the man pronounced his name sent a shiver down Steve’s back, rubbing the back of his head as he walked down to his desk again. That night could be quite eventful the way he saw it.
, he thought,
“We were together, yes, in your chambers,” Steve continued, looking so young in his shyness, as much as he was trying to hide it.
“It does get hard but I don’t give up so easily, despite my last failed attempt talking to you,” Steve answered, placing the vase down and picking up his things to move on.
“I’m surprised you know of it,” he said, walking down the many staircases, the amphitheatre already crowded. Many of the locals took the good seats at the front; royalty tended to sit near the back for a better view.
“I was never as smart as my mother intended,” Steve answered. “I was smart in my own ways; mathematics and such were never my strong suit.”
“Sometimes people like to exaggerate for the sake of reputation,” Tony answered mechanically. “Besides, you haven’t really met Spartan women, have you? If you had, you wouldn’t say those things to me”
Steve smiled. It felt good to be complemented; being surrounded by amazing artists meant that Steve’s work often slipped into the background. “Thank you, Tony,” he said modestly, placing his hand on Tony’s shoulder.
Steve continued to move his shield around in silence, not seeming interested to ask why Tony was still there, causing him to cough and get his attention, and slowly turning to him.
“Now we’re even. And I know that this suits you, but you might want to take it off now..”
Tony’s eyes widened, looking at Steve.
“My shield?” Steve said, laughing at Tony's enthusiasm. “Well it is practically a part of me now, I’m very attached.”
“I don’t know and I don’t care”, Tony gritted his teeth. “We’re not using the serum for this company’s profit. Haven’t you heard what happened to the last scientist that tried to replicate the formula? Trust me, you don’t want to know”
Steve had to draw in a deep breath, exhaling smoothly to calm himself as his body trembled mildly. He wanted to appear as calm as he could though his mind was plagued with anxiousness, and Tony’s touch to his front made the heat rise to his cheeks. As he attempted to become accustomed to it, he focused more on the kisses as he gazed through his long eyelashes at Tony, and his every movement.
Tony could have sworn that he saw the other man smirking faintly, and he didn’t know if that annoyed him or intrigued him. Yes, he would go with both. Whoever this mysterious sheriff turned out to be, things would end up being quite interesting.
Tony smiled to him as set down his cup, crossing his arms to focus on Steve’s every reaction. “I think I’m going to sleep," he muttered.
Stane looked at them both, shaking his head. “You’re missing out.. so much, both of you. You don’t see it now, do you? Super soldier suppliers, kings of the market! But no, your morality gets in the way. Tell me, Tony, since when have you been like that? Last time I checked you weren’t afraid to get your hands dirty and build missiles in order. In bulk. But now? Why this?”
Tony’s suits always knew best with their advanced calculations and whatnot. Steve began to think that Tony probably had an under suit planned for him, which of course would involve him taking off his clothes for a start. He looked around the room, gazing from side to side to ensure no one was there and that the door was tightly shut before letting out a huff and reaching for the bottom of his t-shirt and slowly lifting it up, placing it so it was draping over the top of Tony’s chair.
“You seem too balled up for this early in the morning”, he said with a casual laugh.
With another loud shriek, he felt a painful jolt of electricity running from his head to his legs; he couldn’t move them anymore, their functions were disabled, and he knew that he could so easily take that controller away from Zola’s hands and restore the power. That was if he was able to walk there. He used the power he had in his hands to try and get closer, but an armed man came close and kicked him back on the ground.
With his shield strapped on his back and wearing his uniform, he showed Reed that he was there for business; he wanted to get straight to the point and get out of there as soon as possible.
Steve was forced to attend a rigorous training course as part of his induction as a demigod, having to train in the art of war as well as formal education such as maths and arts, to improve and widen his knowledge as a soldier, and to make him multifaceted and to make him a wise leader that many would look up to. As part of his final training, Steven also received a shield and spear, though the shield was his pride and joy. He would spend countless nights looking after it, and even created a strap which looked odd at the time to others, and kept the shield on his back; he was opposed to keeping his arms occupied. It was one of his own creations, and despite the strange looks he received, he was proud of the shield his mother had given him. The shield had a large shape, representing Orion, the hunter, to provide him with the strength and bravery he needed to lead the Athenian army, as was his duty.
“And what did you hear about me then, Athenian?”
“Don’t let him catch his breath, keep on hitting! His shield is down, aim for the armour! Get rid of the gun!”
He didn't know why he was so sure of what he was saying, or why he was even still talking, he just… knew that he was right.
“I thought that you could understand me,” he replied softly, lowering his gaze even though he didn’t want Steve to go, not when he was holding onto him like that. “Clearly I was wrong all along. Go back to Athens if you want to, I’ll not bother you again.”
By the time that they've reached the graveyard, Tony was starting to figure out where Steve was taking him. Somehow, the thought of seeing his own grave seemed scarier than seeing the body of someone who looked so identical to him. He shrugged in his seat and looked outside the window, really making Steve rethink his decision to take Tony with him. This had to be done, he had to see it with his own eyes.
He sure didn't sound a lot like Tony either. That was unsettling.
“Where are they?”
After a while, he found himself picking his pace up and running back, his hair hiding his eyes as they filled with tears. He was hurt, his constant faith in humanity often let him down, and he just didn’t want to see any more of his friends suffer and die in battle. Being gifted with eternal youth was often a curse; he had seen so many of his friends die before his eyes that he begged the gods to protect them when going into battle, but still  they wouldn’t return. He was sick, tired of such pointless violence, and now his entire home was under threat yet again from one of the most feared armies known to man.
He looked over at Tony. “Is this unusual for you? Bathing in private quarters?”
“I want us to do those things,” Tony said, rubbing the back of his head. “Can we?”
“Just tell me if you want me to stop, all right?” he asked again.
“I’m already scanning them for anything I can get my hands on. He won’t tell me how he got here or what was the last thing he remembers. I surely don’t like his attitude, he’s even more annoying than-“, Reed stopped as soon as he saw the way Steve was looking at him. “Sorry.”
“Okay, try again!”
Steve tried to hold himself up, thought he moment Tony pressed himself inside he made another sharp gasp, his mouth opening this time, unable to restrain himself as he let out a whimper. He tried to focus ahead, but his long hair fell forward, covering his eyes with the sudden movement as he jerked at the second attempt. This time, he gritted his teeth tightly, trying to accommodate Tony by being more relaxed, but it was hard to do.
“Don’t worry about me, get the controller, make those work again!”
The room was in silence now, the argument focusing between those two, nobody daring to say anything.
Steve listened to him, although Athenian training was tough, it was nothing like Spartans. They had a reputation for being trained at such young ages. He gave Tony a pensive look and then continued with the caressing of his muscles again.
“I’m going to see eventually, right?” Tony said, following Steve closely with one last look at everything in the armoury. “I mean, if I stick around for a while."
“Sir, the Captain’s vital signs have been off the charts for the last couple of minutes!”
“You missed the point of the recitation,” he muttered, huddling the scrolls closer to his chest.
“Why wouldn’t others stand up to you?” Steve asked, tilting his head again. “Because you enjoy watching them fear you?”
Tony noticed Steve’s nod and carried on anyway, wanting to make sure that Steve really was ready for him, for what was going to come afterwards. “Just hold on to me," he said as he pulled his fingers out, giving Steve another reassuring kiss before repositioning himself, helping Steve up so he could use his palms as extra support, himself getting a grip of his hips. “It’s all right. All is all right. I promise," he said, before bringing his length close to Steve’s entrance.
Taking a last look at himself in the mirror, he opened the door. It was strange to think that this would most likely be the last time that he would look at himself from that viewpoint, that he wouldn’t need to wheel himself outside anymore.
Taking one last good look at his tensed back, Tony headed outside the room and walked back to his own bedroom, taking his tie off and sitting on the large bed. Steve Rogers, Captain America, his childhood hero was on the same floor, in his building, alive and seeking his help. Maybe the last part wasn’t true, maybe Tony was offering his help too willingly, as he couldn’t stand seeing him like that. In a way, he felt responsible, he was the one who found him in the ice, and had to guide him around, make him feel comfortable and make sure that the man wouldn’t act on impulse and do anything that would put him in grave danger. However, his plan to reveal the presence of the Captain to the world, lift everyone’s spirits, especially when they seem to need a hero more than anything; Tony sure knew that he did. There were things he never really told to anyone, about his childhood, the few memories that he held dear from it, or the ones that haunted him to that day. Steve of course didn’t know, but Captain America meant so much to Tony, he was the one who Tony counted on when the loud voice of his father would echo the hall coming towards his room, little Tony holding the super soldier’s action figure tightly in his hands. His little toy shield was one of his favorite toys amongst his knights, and with Jarvis’ help, he would turn himself into a knight, holding the star shield proudly on his hand as he was defeating his foes. Those were the memories he chose to treasure, and Steve was in a way, part of them. He couldn’t thank him for that, not so soon when the man had to go through a lot more in his head.
“Steve?”, Tony asked, as soon as Steve seemed to calm down. “I think it’s time to talk about this”, he said calmly, facing Steve.
He placed his lips on the man’s soft cheek to press a light kiss there. And then he pulled back quickly, watching Steve’s reaction with his heart racing.
They kept on walking, descending, passing through narrow paths and always having each other’s backs. They worked together, made quite the team, actually.
“Let me show you”, Tony said as he moved closer and helped Steve position his fingers correctly. “You keep that side stable.. there you go.. and you use the other one to do the grabbing. Here, try that piece”, he said, pointing at the piece next to the salmon that Tony just ate it.
Taking a deep breath, he tried to leave everything just like he found them, heading outside and quickly into his bedroom, dropping on the bed and muttering something, his brain still trying to process everything, but seemed impossible, especially after his emotional visit to that mysterious tribute room dedicated entirely to him.
Steve tilted his head, not insisting. He knew that the best way to deal with whatever was going through Tony’s head was to give him all the space he needed.
Steve was waiting for Tony the next day bright and early; this was something that he wanted to do for a while, but didn't have the heart to do. Maybe he was scared of doing it alone, but opening up to this Tony did help him a lot. In a strange way, it felt like communicating with his Tony, and the visit that he was about to make was so important, especially after their talk the previous day.
“ACCESS GRANTED. PLEASE PROCEED.”
“I’m sure she was as beautiful as the photo makes her”, Tony said softly, in a way making sure that Steve was staying with him in reality, not to be lost in his memories again. Sure, he understood how overwhelming it felt, but he needed to a grip, just in case. It almost shocked him that the soldier didn’t break down, not even when they stood in front of Peggy’s grave, so he was being careful.
“That was the most amazing thing I’ve seen in ages!”
“So when you kiss, it’s to show gratitude?” Steve asked, curiously.
Well, too bad, Steve has been away for months, presumably to Russia, anywhere but the heart of New York where Tony was situated. They would talk sometimes, but he didn’t blame Steve for being so invested in his mission; he wasn’t trying to save just anyone, they were talking about his best friend being brainwashed. Tony tried to help, he would send Steve and Sam any intellect he could get his hands on, but besides that, there wasn’t enough time for chit chatting.
“Say ‘I’, it’s easy, give it a try”, Tony encouraged him, looking into the large blonde wolf’s eyes which didn’t seem to have been affected by the transformation.
“Unless there is a particular function, I am sure,” he said, looking out at the stage, placing the scrolls by his feet and folding his arms around himself.
Steve stood to face him, narrowing his eyes a little. “I come to spread the ways of my people,” he said. “Manners are a sign of sophistication and evolution, and it is what separates us humans from titans. Or is it that Spartans consider themselves less evolved than the rest of Greece? Are you titans rather than sons of your god, Spartan? Such a statement would not surprise me in the slightest.”
“Initiate electro shock to look for a pulse”, he ordered, keeping his eyes both on the screens and the man lying on the metal bed”
He nodded. “I see. I think I understand now. Thank you, Tony,” Steve said, pressing his lips briefly to Tony's, “for explaining that.”
“Did you ever doubt my skills?” Tony asked, raising his eyebrow as he ate from his own portion of food.
Steve stared, mesmerised and magnetised by the man who stood there. He had never felt his heart beat this way and he tried to convince himself that he was only there for the benefit of Athens, to protect his people, even though he wasn’t doing much to ensure their safety.
Steve looked up at Tony. “Together... I promise...” he said, “I’ll wait for you...” His grip was loose over Tony’s hand and still he tried gently to stroke it, to feel Tony's warmth again.
Steve nodded as he gathered his things. “Come, let’s make haste,” He said, walking up to Tony to kiss him lightly on the cheek.
“He’s the one who owns the Gauntlet, it has to be here, Steve!”
Tony didn’t expect to be so star struck by the size and glory of the temple, staring at it with an open mouth. He had never seen such a beautiful and well-tended temple before in his life.
Tony was busy, flicking through his notebook, looking at differents notes and sketches. To a different person, they hardly made any sense, but to Tony, they were everything. Scribbles, drawings, everything there was extremely valuable, and even if Steve went through it, he couldn’t really know what to believe when he saw them.
His words were cut short as Steve delivered a hard punch across his jaw.
Steve saw no harm in continuing with the loving motions, as long as he refused to admit that his heart was warming to the Spartan that was destined to kill him. And he refused to admit, too, that he saw more than a killer; he saw a man who needed to be taught and needed to have company.
“I know it must be shocking for you-”
“We’ll see, we need the surgeons to come in first, they will start working on you, then the engineers come in. I’ll be there looking after the whole procedure from start to finish. Of course you’ll be knocked out, we can’t do this with you being awake. However, we’ll need your full cooperation when we wake you up to make sure that all is working perfectly. Like they probably said to you, this is considered to be smart technology. Your new legs will respond to your thoughts, so don’t be surprised if you...find a patch of hair missing in the back of your head, at least for a few weeks.”
“Oh," Tony said as he stayed in place. “So you’re saying that... I shouldn’t tag along? You know, the Sphinx is gone, no need to take her place. Just answer me this, do you want me along?”
Captain America, his bets friend and teammate actually wanted to be with him in a relationship.
Steve could feel the tip as it pushed against a spot that was generating so much pleasure; it made his back arch, pushing his chest toward the suit, eager to feel as much of it against his sweaty skin as possible. He felt the jitter of the metal as his hands tried to reach around the large, broad shoulders, trying to grip at the jagged plates for security. “Iron Man-” He repeated over and over, his cries becoming louder.
“Precisely. Your new legs, in your situation, will be connected to your brain and respond to you, you will have absolute control. Do you want us to incorporate jets in them? You can have that. Anything that you wish can be possible thanks to Mr. Stark’s involvement in this project.”
A few hours later, he was left in the main entrance of a big apartment block. The driver, Stark’s employee was a happy looking man who loved to talk, he seemed to be interested in Steve’s military life.
Steve expected to see the same deteriorated, old factory from outside on the inside too, but he was greeted by a busy lab, equipped with the latest tech possible. Everyone seemed to be busy, some people with labcoats didn’t even turn to see the newcomers, but others stopped what they were doing, muttering inaudible things to each other, but Steve knew that they were all talking about him. He wondered if Zola and Tarleton informed everyone of his arrival, which was probably the case. The building looked and felt cold, and it sure made Steve feel uncomfortable; he disliked hospitals, too many unpleasant memories took part in them, and this facility reeked of that. This was meant to be a new beginning for him, he had to stop worrying about everything and remind himself of the benefits of the experiment. He wanted to go back to the battlefield, get his legs back, to feel useful. In the end, that was what he was craving, to be able to give back to his country, and he knew that without his legs, he couldn’t reach the peak of his abilities. However, this “future” didn’t look too trustworthy to him.
“What do you mean? Don’t give me that ‘chose one’ clichéd talks now, I'm not buying it.”, Tony replied, backing away from Steve.
“If it’s okay with you, I would like to visit a couple of places today”, Steve said calmly, eyes fixed on the black screen in front of him.
Steve leaned closer to him, kissing him again. It was still soft, hesitant, and Steve didn't know if he should try anything else. But he liked being gentle, and he wanted to show how grateful he was to Tony.
“Perhaps we both need each other in order to be better people,” Tony nodded, rubbing Steve’s hands. “It feels right to do this, to be with you, nothing else.”
“Enough! What’s going on, Kang? Why is this happening?!”, Steve snapped.
“It’s easy to make copies in our day, you know.. and I located your apartment before we planned to come here, got someone to make those keys, I doubted that you had a pair on your own or that you would want to kick your door down..”, Tony replied.
“Just a reminder, I’m not the one wearing a skin tight spangled outfit here, Captain”, Tony noted, leading to Steve leaving the room with a huff.
He bit back a moan as the second finger entered his body, his loins aching with ecstasy, getting more excited by the suit, the beautifully crafted suit. His head rested on the table, his chest heaving as the fingers were feeling around him. So this was what it was like to be in Tony’s position, no wonder he moaned so much. The soft pulse of the fingers was driving him to his limits, hearing the clicking of the suit as it moved. His eyes opened to stare at it, its gold faceplate, its crimson red body and glowing chest. Steve found himself giving in to a suit, a non-living entity but he couldn’t stop seeing it as the man that had saved him countless times in battle, the thing that had displayed such heroism.
Tony rolled his eyes. “What proof do you want to see in my actions, Athenian, to open your eyes? Name it, and I’ll give it to you.”
“Hey boss! Tony! Be careful there!”, Rhodey called as he approached with some of the other men.
“Uh...ta-da?”, Tony attempted to say, waving his hands in a show-offish manner. “Surprise, it’s me? And it has been me all along, not a bodyguard, I guess.. Kind of a silly cover up, if you ask me..”
“You funded them! You helped them do this!”
“Not going through a loop hole, that’s for sure. And I have nothing else to say until you let me go.”
“You mean the Skrulls?”, Steve asked, turning his attention back to him.
A sharp gasp, followed by a murmur. He had never once felt anything inside him like that before. He could feel his cheeks burning up, scalding, eyes fluttering shut.
Tony could have sworn that his heart started to beat faster when he felt Steve’s strong grip on him, having to hold himself back from exasperating when he pulled away. “This means a lot to me Steve.. so thank you..”, he said with a half smile. It really did, Steve, well, Captain America, was someone he always looked up to, and to hear him right now telling him that he was a good man, when the world tried to tell him otherwise was a big deal to him. That was it, this was the reassurance and recognition that he was looking for, and Steve of all people was the one to give it to him. “I’ll stop now before we get all mushy and all”, he laughed nervously and Steve joined him, standing up.
It would be like seeing a wax figure, only that this was the real deal. No, he wasn’t making this sound any better, wax figures were creepy too anyway.
“Your comfort encourages guests to follow by example, another Athenian teaching.”
“Come on,” he said, “this will help. It’s going to relax you a lot.” He didn't really pay much attention to himself – it was nothing new to him, or any of his fellow citizens, to reveal his body when he wasn't alone.
“Wait for it…”
The ride outside the centre of Buenos Aires was mostly quiet and uneventful, they were mostly chatting and admiring the scenery until they reached a point which made it clear that they had to carry on moving on foot.
“If you defeat me, you’ll never see him again!”, Kang chuckled maniacally.
“Clever boy”, the older man said as he gave Tony’s cheek a pat. “I need the secret to the super soldier serum, simple as that. If the Captain is willing to cooperate, we’ll take his samples and let you both go. If he refuses.. maybe I need to be more persuasive.. how do you think that he would react if he saw his precious Tony being tortured right before his eyes? So helpless..”
“Fine. Just until the project ends.”
The other man didn’t crack a smile; instead he turned around, looking at the various bottles across the bar.
Steve looked at him and then at their apparent enemies, sighing and lowering his guns. He was hired to protect Tony, even if that meant not engaging in a fight that would cost them way too much. He only hoped that this mysterious woman liked Tony enough to let him live.
“Did you honestly think that I’m invincible? Come on now, Tony, I’m just a man”, Steve said softly, attempting to get closer. This time, Tony didn’t pull away. “Let’s get you back to bed…”
thinking about him after all, imagining that he did the same when Tony was away for mission, those times that they would lock themselves in their rooms, frustrated that they couldn’t spend the night together. It only helped to boost up his confidence and desire to touch Steve with his own hands, but he had yet to use the primary function of the suit. He felt slightly bad to pull out the fingers from Steve’s behind, but he pulled him towards him, his knees bent as he seated him on his lap.
When they finally reached the city walls, Tony was amazed by the marbled structures and columns, walking through the different places in the Agora, already hearing so much. Even the way the people talked was slightly different to the way he was used to. Nobody seemed to really pay attention to them, as they were busy themselves, and he found himself wandering around with Steve having to pull him close in order to not get lost.
“Your Steve better takes good care of you now… or else I'm hopping over to have a word with him.”
“I can’t leave my guest here alone,” Tony said as he took another bite of his apple, watching Steve carefully.
“Leave him be!” Falcon yelled back, trying to be the guardian that he was meant to be, his large red wax wings, similar to those of Icarus’, shielding Steve as he ushered him out of the building quickly, Steve hiding his face in shame.
“Come on..”, he said between gritted teeth, managing to pull out a pointy, silver part. Upon further inspection, it wasn’t hard to figure out what it really was. He would spent hours reading about the Second World War, the weapons that were used, the tanks, planes.. that’s how he was introduced to the family business in first place. “This is a WW2 era German airplane..”, he muttered, mostly to himself, walking carefully around the iceberg, realising in horror that the rest of the plane, at least the cockpit, was stuck inside it.
Tony nodded in return, lightly pushing Steve back on the bed, taking his moment to appreciate the man’s beauty. His face was so full of emotions; fear, agony, even adoration, but all for him. He rubbed Steve's cheek once again before moving his hand lower, to his chest, and then he placed his lips over Steve’s neck to press soft kisses against the warm flesh.
“And you have never seen another person naked before?” Tony asked with a soft laugh.
“You said that you don’t know who Kang the Conqueror is, correct?”, Steve asked him, rubbing his back up and down to calm him down, taking his hand away as soon as he realised that he was probably invading Tony’s personal space, especially since their last meeting involved them screaming in each other’s faces.
Everyone knew who he was. Steve Rogers, a good soldier, a good man. He had that unique leadership trait that rallied up the rest of the troops in his squad, he was affectionately called “Captain” by a lot. Some even joked and called him the Captain of America, but Steve dismissed that nickname, he felt that he didn’t deserve it. When the incident took place, it didn’t just shake him, it shook everyone who knew him. They all came to see him, but nobody knew exactly what to say to him. They would offer their condolences, say that it didn’t matter that he couldn’t be in the battlefield anymore, that he could get a good paying office job in the Ministry of Defence. Steve put his stoic face on and nodded to every comment, to every General that came in and offered him a job, but so far he turned everything down. He spent a few weeks in that hospital, struggling to find a purpose in life.
“Not the actual um, experiment. No, experiment doesn’t have the right ring to it, how do we call it? Project, yeah. No, we will run some tests first, see how compatible you are, how your brain responds to the machines.”
“Come on!”
“You know, Spartan,” Steve said, placing his hand under Tony’s chin, “I am grateful for you letting me stay here, for showing me this.”
Steve walked in, nodding with approval. “Thank you,” he said, kneeling down and slipping off his sandals.
“Ready for the big day?”
Steve let out a gentle sigh, staring at the magnificent sapphire eyes that stared at him, beseeching him.
Tony started to feel warmer and the way Steve was treating him, in such a gentle, delicate way, did help. He didn’t know exactly what his feelings were, or what he even meant to Steve, but they'd already moved past the boundaries people usually set between them.
Tony smiled at the compliment, moving around a little until he could sit in the water. “Why thank you, Athenian. That’s the nicest thing that anyone ever said to me,” he teased. “I was joking by the way”
“Yes, of course,” Steve said, brushing back his blonde hair to look over at his scrolls.
Tony turned around to face him, not saying a word, just holding his hand as long as Steve wanted him to do it. He wasn’t the best when it came to comforting people, but that need to take care of Steve was so strong and he needed to console him, make him feel a bit better.
Tony bit on his lower lip and huffed as he could feel Steve's discomfort, rubbing Steve's hips to soothe him, leaning forward as he pushed himself deeper inside. “Talk to me. I’m right here let me hear you," he said softly, wanting to reassure him, wanting to know that Steve felt better as time passed. He couldn't imagine how hard it must be for Steve.
“A date? You’re asking me if I’m asking a tooth fairy out? A fairy that broke into my bedroom late at night because he wanted to meet me? If it weren’t you, I would certainly arrest you, I wouldn’t consider going out on a date with you... do you hide those when you’re out of duty?”, he asked, pointing at the wings.
“Yes,” Steve answered. “But it’s because I enjoy your company now. I don’t know you enough and I want to get to know you.”
The building stood tall, if people were walking around, he would be convinced that some residents were in fact, still inside. It looked dirty, and the old newspapers thrown around still had quite recent dates written on them.
“Uh.. it’s not exactly nice”, the Captain laughed as he saw the shield hitting a good number of enemies, falling back.
The car stopped by the massive building, and they both stepped outside while Happy was rushing to meet Pepper waiting for them in the lobby.
“Nah..not really..”, he shook his head. “Not now, at least. Had it tougher when I first had to come up with a replacement for it.. the prototype didn’t really do the job, I had to use my own tech and make this piece of beauty. If this can keep me alive, I’m sure that I can power up entire cities using the same schematics and with much more energy”
“What just happened?”, Steve asked in confusion.
Tony watched the way that Steve knelt down for a moment before he was doing the same, taking off his sandals. He wet his lips, unsure of what to do. Whatever he decided, he certainly didn’t want to leave.
Tony watched him turn, gently slipping the rest of his tunic off before reaching around Steve to place his hands on Steve’s stomach and help him up to his knees. He held onto Steve's body lovingly, unable to resist admiring his muscular build on full display. Tony took his time to trail his lips on Steve's bare back, still holding firmly onto him to feel him shivering and trembling slightly under him.
Steve coughed and regained his posture.
It was Steve’s turn to blush faintly, rubbing the back of his head. He didn’t expect to get a confirmation straight away, but the fact that Tony seemed to be feeling the same way was simply astonishing. “I.. uh.. I really..”, he stuttered as he leaned closer to the older man, keeping his eyes fixed on him.
“More times than you think - did you call anybody else?”
Steve’s chest felt heavy as he mentally went through different names, not knowing where to start from. The part of him that hoped that all of this was just a nightmare was urging him to ask about Bucky, but the memory of the teen holding on the plane and Steve falling down, watching it explode on the sky was far too painful for him to relive.  Now that he was thinking about it, he didn’t know if he actually wanted to know about the whereabouts or what happened to his friends. Bracing himself, he decided to only ask one question, for now.
Tony spent his days as expected, often in discussion with his father to then bring the matters to the group of elders, who thought highly of him. Still, much was expected from the child of Ares, a man close to the age of thirty. He was nearing the age of marriage, being pressured into finding a suitable wife and to raise children worthy of his own name. However, Tony was focused on leading the people of Sparta, giving his advice to the King; he was leader of the Army, training future warriors and teaching them about the use of the new weapons that he started producing following his work with Hephaestus. The war was upon them, and despite the Athenians trying to resolve the situation and send in people to negotiate, Tony was harsh, preaching that his father’s will was for Sparta to go to war and teach a lesson to the Athenians who dared to even think of stealing their glory.
Tony hissed at Steve’s words, not having any intentions of turning around and not watching his beautiful face like he had never seen him before, in such a defenceless and helpless state, even though he was trying to regain that sense of pride of his now that he knew that Tony was there.
“I thought you came here to teach your ways, yet you decide to leave when others show interest. And am I supposed to listen to you, son of Athena? Look at me when you’re talking, don’t turn your back on me!”
Tony smiled. “I’m really on good terms with that, if that means that I’m getting you as well," he nodded, placing a kiss on Steve’s jaw before pulling back to look at him.
Locking Kang out of their universe and timeline seemed to be the perfect solution to their problems at that very moment, and Steve didn’t hesitate to give direct orders to the rest of the Avengers to push Kang to his limits.
And just like that, the man in the star spangled uniform turned around, reacting so fast when he felt an armoured hand on his shoulder, slapping it away with disgust.
Steve rolled his eyes, not being able to form any thankful sentences but only followed the older man obediently. Before he knew it, they were seated in the fancy restaurant, Paris in their feet as the enjoyed a course of tasty dishes, completed with a dessert that Steve took some convincing to eat after the waiter burned the sugar on top of the cream in front of them.
The figure dressed in purple and green was now facing them, having appeared through what it seemed a portal, holding a large gun at his hand, a wide spread grin all across his face.
“This isn’t just for the show, you know”, Tony replied as he pointed at his reactor. “It’s filled with energy, which is exactly what we need right now”. He took one of the wires and fidgeted with his back turned against Steve for a moment, the projected starting to produce a noise. “Aha! I knew it would work!”, he exclaimed, taking the film reel and carefully putting it inside the machine, the cloth opposite them starting to show blurry images in black and white. “Come on..”, he muttered as he adjusted himself, finally able to see what was on the cloth; Captain America standing on top of the barracks, giving an inspiration speech to his troops.
Steve shut his eyes and brushed his nose against Tony’s cheek. “I’m not supposed to do anything that could hurt my heart, but friendship isn’t supposed to hurt me,” he said. “But it has.  I’ve lost my friends. What I’m trying to say is that, I want you as my friend, Tony.”
“Just the men,” Tony replied as he focused on watching Steve's every action. “The women don’t bathe along with us.” And he watched Steve, admiring the other man's beauty as he moved deeper into the water himself. “So am I the first one you've share a bath with?”
“So what, you can call me Winghead or something?”, Steve laughed. “If that’s the case, I’ll have to call you Shellhead in return.”
Tony couldn’t keep his eyes away from Steve’s beaming face, rubbing his chin softly as he held tightly on the man’s hand. “You know, that’s how I feel as well.”
“It means that I won’t be responsible for the potential death of a human being because someone decided to use my blood as a basis for the super soldier formula. I’m not signing up to be subject of experiments again”
“I made you proud?” Steve asked. “How?” He rubbed his hand down Tony’s chest to his stomach, appreciating the definition of the muscles there.
“Might as well”, Tony muttered, as he grabbed the missile in the last moment, redirecting it towards the portal.
Stane looked at them, and it was clear that he was holding back insults to spit out to them, especially at Steve. It was so clear that he hated the man’s guts, and hated Tony for allowing that kind of behaviour. Without a word, he straightened his suit and headed towards the elevator. Just when it seemed that he was going to leave without a come back, he turned at them smirking as the doors closed.
Steve stretched his legs; he did feel more powerful, it made him wonder how faster he could run with those legs, maybe he would go for a run the next morning, early on and check.
Steve nodded against Tony’s skin, keeping their cheeks placed together. “Yes,” he said. “I am happy too.”
“So.. is that what love should feel like? Softening each other’s harsh lives? What if I can make it all better for you?”, Steve said after a long pause.
“You want people to drop on their knees and pray, you want them to kiss your feet, how is that not abusing your power? Because I’m not going to give you that pleasure,” Tony replied as he shook his head. Steve was right, his pride was something that he valued too much to let go that easily.
“What happened to our talk from earlier?” he asked. “I thought that I would see the proud day that I could march into Athens as a friend, but to you, the only way I can reach your city is bound in chains, a prisoner of war. I know very well what you preach to be, Athenian, and I seek far more than simple education from you. I want to learn the ways of the humans, I want to embrace the human side of me, maybe even find love, just as you said. I want to be respected, not feared, and you seem to know the way.”
“Are you saying I am an equal because of my parent? Or because I have earned it?” Steve asked. “And if you were to come to Athens with good intentions, those good intentions would be welcomed.”
“Everything bar shields apparently,” he said, raising his eyebrow.
“Don’t hurt him! He’s not in the state of mind to- I said, don’t hurt him!”, Tony yelled as he stood up, rubbing his neck and following them outside.
And the nightmares stopped after a while, but when Steve started to have them, Tony was worried. Steve was strong and could handle almost everything with ease, which sometimes made Tony forget that he wasn’t only supposed to deal with Captain America, his partner was above all Steve Rogers, even though he tried to lock that weaker and needy part of him away.
The billionaire sighed, knowing that it would be pointless to either protest or trying to see what Steve was up to. A pat on his shoulder made him turn around, facing Steve with a happy smile on his face, showing off the now painted padlock on his palm. Steve had painted his shield and Tony’s arc reactor next to it, joint together, the letters “S” and “T” written across them.
The blonde arched his eyebrow sharply.  “Does that make you proud, Spartan? That you can walk in weather that most would much rather remain indoors within, and prevent illness?”
The bodies of the two demigods lay in the battlefield together as their souls rose together to Mount Olympus, hand in hand, staring down at the cities that they once sought to protect battle for supremacy.
“Oh? Do you want to carry on foot, then?” Tony asked with one eyebrow raised.
“You were going to be with me anyway,” Tony said, reaching out to push Steve's hair back out of his face. “I think you meant more time alone. Right?”
“Why did we stop?”, he asked the driver, who simply pointed in the distance, where the helicopter above them turned its lights to.
! Just let me go!”, Tony yelled, slapping Steve’s hand away.
“And what’s the sudden interest in my comfort?” Tony asked, setting his finished apple down by his side as he stood to fetch a bowl of broth.
The driver was outside and waiting for them, handing them the keys and wishing them a good journey. Tony had to remind himself to slip in a few extra notes to his payment, since the car would certainly not be in the best position when they were done.
“I understand that your city means much to you, and I see no need for a violent assault as long as we find a middle ground. Well, not us, our kings,” he pointed out.
He watched Tony's curious eyes, gazing around wherever Steve took him, and Tony seemed at ease. Of course, Steve spotted women looking their way, mainly looking at Tony, but such was to be expected, especially due to Tony’s dark looks. His olive skin and dark hair, along with his rugged beard and sharp eyes that were framed delicately by long eyelashes, were a novelty in Athens. How could someone considered to be a demon be so beautiful? Now Steve could see the human in him, and much to his concern, he was falling for him.
“I would have never known that about you, you don’t seem the philosophical type...”
Tony only pulled back from the kiss to lick his lips, enjoying the feeling of Steve’s hands in his hair, nodding a little as a signal for Steve to keep his hands where they were while he leaned forward once again. He moved his hand, finger trailing down Steve's neck before he followed his finger with his tongue, slowly and carefully, waiting for Steve.
Steve turned at the elevator again and shook his head, still not sure what to believe. “I’ll have your word on that”, he simply said as he walked across the room. “Do you mind if I go back to my room..?”
“Steve, please, think straight, I would never do this if I knew!”
“Well I prefer art, over many things,” Steve answered, looking back at Tony.
“Captain Rogers, if you may, place yourself next to me”, he said as he pointed at the spot on the table. “It’s a standard procedure, nothing to worry about”
He couldn’t stay behind; the prophecies spoke clearly when they said that Steve would die because of him, and Tony had to be there to ensure that the Athenian would survive the attack at least. It was his time to wear his armour, red and gold, in the colours of his city, his eyes filled with emptiness as the feeling of rage overtook him.
“No, it wasn’t,” Tony said, smiling a little as he stroked Steve's cheek with his thumb. “That’s why I kept asking you to stay; I need some time to come to my senses.”
“If it's answers that you seek of go ahead, you shall receive them, if I deem it appropriate,” Tony replied. “But know this well, if you ask to cease this war, I wouldn’t waste my spit in your face, and the answer is still no. And saying that you can’t foresee fate, when you imply that you’re the son of a goddess, doesn’t really sit with me well, Athenian. I can ask the fates themselves and learn everything that I want to know, and I’m sure that they will predict your demise,” narrowing his eyes as Steve didn’t seem to react to his movements.
Despite all, when they were left alone, Tony found the need to go after Steve, have a small talk with him and give him something that belonged to him. The Captain seemed calm, even though Tony could tell that this wasn’t the case. He was biting the inside of his mouth and the genius could see it so clearly.
Tony smiled widely; Steve came here, he came all the way back to save him, just like he would expect from a super hero like himself. The panic and annoyance in Stane’s voice and expression really satisfied Tony; the star spangled man seemed to have came with a plan indeed, and judging by the way the older man was shouting orders, it wouldn’t take long for his hero to appear right before them.
When Tony opened his eyes, he noticed that all the windows were open. Huge pet peeve, he hated to wake up when the sun was bright outside; it made him feel like he wasted all his day doing nothing while- his eyes widened even further. He was back. Yes, that was his own bedroom, his own paintings on the walls, his own expensive, linen bed sheets, his own Steve sitting on the chair opposite him flicking through a sketchbook. His Steve…?
“And style is all you care about, right?”, Steve replied with the same style.
Steve let out a small, contented sigh. “Well now you shall expand your horizons.”
Tony’s research gave more results, and his team of scientists and engineers were able to harness the energy coming from his bigger in scale arc reactors. Steve listened to him with a bright smile as he rambled, saying how their city would have more trustworthy and clean energy than it ever did before. Criminals were brought in justice by Steve every day, and Steve was enjoying what he did once again; using his abilities to ensure that his beloved country was safe once more. Everything seemed to have been fixed, all but one thing that needed to be taken care of.
“Fine. You can have this. Spoiler alert, if you’re looking for its immense power or whatever.. I’m sorry to disappoint you, but this Gauntlet is useless. Doesn’t do a thing”, Tony finally replied as he walked close to her, handing her the Gauntlet which was actually heavier than it looked like.
“Where have you been? It doesn’t matter now, I had to keep Stane busy because he’s fuming up there”, Pepper replied, holding documents close to his chest. “Tony, be careful in there, will you?”, she said before Tony rushed into the elevator, Steve following him without really thinking.
Steve clenched his jaw, ignoring the comments as he saw past Tony, fixing some papers in front of him. “I was called because you specifically requested someone to..?” he said, pointing at Tony to answer is question.
“They have names now? I don’t know, but whatever anyone is paying you to keep me here, I'm going to pay you double to let me go. I go back to New York and promise not to go all Iron Man on you for doing this to me. I've been kidnapped before, I'm not doing this again, it’s boring and repetitive.”
“Makes it easier to know that I had a soft spot for the same person all along. Tony Stark and Iron Man..Tony Stark, the Iron Man..”
“Oh, I am. But I’m not military.”
“Don’t worry, that won’t be a problem. They’re many means for you to entertain yourself back in my Tower, there’s a gym, lounge.. well, you’ll find something to keep yourself busy”, Tony rushed to reply, standing up and wearing his huge parka again, wrapping himself up and offering Steve one. “You’ll need to, trust me, it’s freezing out there, in case you didn’t notice already”, he said as he noticed Steve’s hesitation.
“…We have received more information from Stark’s close friend Colonel James Rhodes, claiming that Obadiah Stane, partner and investor of Stark Industries is involved to the incident, but he’s not yet located to make any comments”
He didn't want to keep on talking, he didn't want to admit that he spent days, weeks dreaming that this was yet another one of his nightmares, that Tony, in reality, was alive and well, that he never betrayed him. He would really give up so much to go back to when things were simpler between the two of them.
“Jarvis is an AI I developed, he runs the building's security, especially this floor’s. Artificial Intelligence loyal to me alone”, Tony explained. “Trustworthy and intelligent, even though sometimes he can be a pain in the ass with his jokes and commentary. Makes me wonder why I built him like that”
Tony Stark knew that the truth would come out. It was inevitable, from day one. The web of lies that the Illuminati threaded was starting to break down. That’s what was happening. The beginning of the end. And at that very moment, Steve staring at him, not sure how to even confront him, made his chest feel heavy. He knew that he lied to him, that he betrayed him, that he lost every single right in the world to call him his friend. The right that he earned back after the war. Having Steve as a friend was an honour, and right now, after so long, after realising that what he did was wrong, that it would only make things even worse, it hurt. Hell, he would rather have another round with his greatest foes rather than sit there with Steve looking at him like that.
“That’s impossible.”
Steve smiled pleasantly.
“I lost my focus.. good thing we were just above the pool”, Steve muttered, pushing back Tony’s hair from his eyes for him.
“You’ve already done enough, son of Ares. You will lead the Gods to a war amongst themselves if you carry on courting the son of Athena, and that is not advisable.”
Steve rubbed the warm water over his skin and over the well sculpted muscles, much bigger than a normal Athenian's. It was partly why he took it upon himself to hide his body with his large tunic. “Let’s hope not,” he said.
“Where am I?”, he asked in a scruffy voice, which was normal considering that the man didn’t speak a word for so many years.
He hadn’t felt this way before, ever, not even with the woman he admired from afar. This time he had experienced touch, and savoured it. He didn’t understand what he felt; it felt like a yearning, a want for this bond that they had formed instantly, but he wanted more than that, praying that it wasn’t greed or lust that was settling in his mind.
By the time he got home, his eyes were red with tears, running straight to the temple of his mother, his shield clattering on the floor, as he dropped everything to collapse by the statue of Athena, clinging to it with desperation. “I do not wish for more lives to be lost!” he pleaded, crying out loudly as he held himself to his mother’s statue, resting his head by her large stone feet. “I’ve lost my friends, mother! I don’t want to lose any more!” He shut his eyes and tried to pull himself together, the faint crackling of the fire his only company.
Steve nodded, swallowing down. Without thinking about it, he tried to convince himself to move his legs, having taught himself to forget about the use of legs for those past few months. He held his breath as his right leg moved on the side of the bed, letting out a gasp and looking at Tony straight away.
“No”, Steve shook his head. “You said he won’t stop at hurting you and you need a bodyguard, I don’t see anyone else able to protect you right now. Now, let’s go see what he wants”, he said firmly.
“And I’m sure that we’ll be able to revert this soon enough. You’ll be furless soon, don’t worry, even though I might feel a bit colder at night”, he joked.
Tony stood still; he would recognise that voice anywhere. When he eventually turned around, she was standing there, a pistol aimed at his face; why was it always the face?!
Tony was speechless as he held on to Steve, still in shock. “What just happened..?”, he said after a while, sitting up properly, but still not letting go of the Captain.
Tony chuckled at his comment. “Why are you so sure of that? I’ve seen how women look at you; clearly they value you a lot. And elegant is one of the countless compliments that you receive, I’m sure.”
“God, I need a drink…”, Tony huffed, rubbing his forehead tiredly.
That’s when the other call came.
As he grew older, he looked after his people, gifted with tactical knowledge and a sense of justice that earned respect from them. As a proud asset, he was provided with the gift of youth, from the goddess Hebe, sibling to Ares. Hebe had given this drop of youth to Athena to ask for forgiveness for Ares’ actions though, once Ares had discovered this, he was furious, and felt betrayed by his own sibling. They resolved their own dispute in time amongst themselves. However, now that Athena had this gift, she bestowed it upon her son and though he aged in mind, his body would never deteriorate or age and thus he would forever appear youthful, as though he were in his twenties. He was also gifted a violet coloured tunic, to signify his demigod status amongst his people.
“Can I examine it later? Just from the point of a view of a weapons creator, it really is one of a kind. A gift from the Gods, perhaps?” he asked.
“No… not really, until the next time he figures out how to get here… Tony… you’re… fading away…”, Steve gasped, trying to hold on the man’s arms.
Tony rubbed the back of his head. He always told people that Hephaestus gave the medallion to him because of his services, and that was partly true. In reality, Ares requested it to save Tony from mortal wounds. “It keeps my heart beating. If I take it off, I’m...” He stopped. “You get the picture; tragic old injury, near death experience, godly construction keeping me alive. I can’t take it off," he finally said.
That particular day, he informed Steve that he was going to be away, coming back late at night, and made sure to venture in his workshop, the finished suit in the centre of the room, before sending a message to Steve, telling him that he forgot to mention that the suit was ready, in the workshop waiting for it to get tested. Feeling proud of his plan, he proceeded to wear the suit, donning Tony’s trademark colours, much like his usual ones. Staying still could be quite the challenge for such a restless person, but he had to be patient; the turnout could be quite promising.
“This is Happy Hogan. Happy, this is Steve Rogers”, he said, the man taking off his hat and offering his strong hand for Steve to shake.
Shutting his eyes, he leaned back on the comfortable pillows, who felt like bricks to him at that moment. What if bringing Steve back to life was a bad call in first place? What if he would cause him more emotional trauma and scar him even more by bringing him into a world when he wasn’t any more appreciated and the old fashioned values he probably treasured meant nothing to the people? He had to eventually show Steve around, but he was dreading for his reaction, especially after he saw the way he was looking at the buildings, the city, everything. The next day would probably be eventful and overwhelming for Steve, and the least he could hope was that the man got to rest.
“Why do you have faith in me, Spartan? What have I done to deserve it?” Steve asked.
Tony’s first instinct was to try and shove Steve away, but for whatever reason took over him, he didn't do it. Maybe it was the fact that he yearned at least some human contact after being confined for so long, and that scared him. Having another human body against him felt so warm, so reassuring, even in the strange mess that he found himself into at that moment.
“Back off!”, Steve said angrily, shoving Tony’s hand from his shoulder as soon as he felt his touch, not wanting anything to do with him.
“Steve! Steve, open your eyes! You’re flying!”
“What were those tests again?”
“Are you sure…?” Steve asked, and Tony’s eyes said it all. With a nod, he got himself comfortable, sitting on the edge of the bed, focusing on Tony again.
“What is he talking about…”, Steve asked out loud.
“You credit me for more than I’ve done,” Steve said.
“Devoting your life to your mother, huh?” Tony asked in a lower tone, the smile from earlier disappearing. No matter how hard he tried to understand how Steve’s mind seemed to work, he couldn't.  “Can I ask you something?”
“If I said that I do, that I do need you here to help, will you consider that another one of my lies?” Tony said, clenching his fists as he watched Steve walk away. “Because there, I've said it. I mean it. Whenever you want to believe me or not, that’s entirely up to you.”
He was laying on the sofa, squeezing a small ball and staring at the ceiling, trying to think if he would go back to Tony in the Tower, maybe have some more time to think about his decision, when the song was interrupted, the radio host sounding distressed as she started talking.
“And if you ever bring down those barriers?” Tony asked. “What happens then? Is there any chance of saving me?”
“Don’t leave before I wake up?" Tony asked, closing his own eyes.
He yawned and stretched, rubbing his eyes as he stepped over to the selection of suits in glass cases, staring at each one of them and trying to remember where he’d seen them and what they did, there were a couple of course that he’d never seen in action at all, but he was sure one day he would.
Tony didn’t exactly protest; Steve supporting him and looking menacing when facing someone as shady as Stane was a plus, not to mention that it made him feel good that the soldier felt protective over him, even in the slightest. He nodded as they waited patiently until the elevator doors opened, getting inside the same room that they were the day before, the door leading to Tony’s private office opening, a man stepping out with his arms crossed, not looking pleased at all.
It didn't matter any more, he was going heading towards the figure, and just like that, he knew that it belonged to only one person.
Tony watched the man as he left and sighed; it was always the same. He always questioned why the Athenians kept coming when they knew his reply; still, Steve’s words made him doubt himself and the teaching he grew up with for a couple of moments. Returning to his private chambers, he did not allow anyone to bother him, not even Rhodey. He needed to collect his thoughts, but it only made him doubt all that he had been taught.
“The way you quite rapidly change my title should have me concerned, is this some sort of trap?” Steve asked as he took a seat by the table, pouring himself some wine.
Tony nodded and pulled away, getting out of the bath to covering himself with the tunic from earlier before turning around to give Steve the sense of privacy he needed.
“Deep breathes, you are barely making any sense...”, Steve stopped him before leading him to the main living room area and sitting him down on the couch. “Start from the beginning, what’s going on...?”
“Do you love him?”, Tony asked him, head tilted.
Tony chuckled. “He will, I'm sure of it. You… be careful, all right? You’re a good guy, Steve. You really do deserve happiness in the end. And you’ll get it.”
“If you wish,” Steve said, even though he was quite comfortable with the way they were.
Steve's muscles coiled and moved at each small movement and he leaned his head back, shutting his eyes though the lashes fluttered as Tony moved on.
“I am the son of Cupid,” he growled, “and this isn’t my fault, I was doing as I was told.”
Steve examined his legs once more before trying not to feel too silly by thinking about flying. His eyes were closed, his thoughts disrupted when he heard Tony’s voice again.
“I would have never guessed that he-”
Tony smiled in return, making sure to keep Steve warm as he rubbed his nose against the man’s cheek, enjoying the feeling of their bodies against each other, protection from the cold.
Tony smiled at him, but Steve’s last words surprised him. “What do you mean by that?” he said. “You saw me in your sleep? I hope it wasn’t a nasty game played upon us by Morpheus...”
“Uh.. Can you find the whereabouts of some people? I don’t know if they changed names or where they are..”
Steve ran up to the window but Tony was gone. Placing his hand on his cheek, he stared outside for a bit before he decided that it really was time to get some sleep.
“I’m sorry I’m dragging you to business, Steve”, he said as they got inside the car. This wasn’t the way he wanted that emotional moment to end, and it sure wasn’t ideal for Steve either.
The rest of the Avengers launched forward for an attack; Thor swung his hammer, Carol flew towards, his fists already lit up, the Hulk ran towards Kang and jumped on him.
“How often do you look at yourself in the mirror? You’re a fine specimen, if you didn’t notice”
“I was wrong before; friends don’t do what we’re doing right now. Or what we did last night" Tony said with a shake of his head, holding on to Steve’s hand, not wanting him to draw it back. “But lovers do”
“Perhaps you ought to build one then,” Steve suggested, huddling the scrolls close to his chest again.
Tony thought carefully, trying to look around for inspiration. “We’ll get somewhere when they can see us, and shout,” he said with a nod. “They are bound to at least listen."
“We’re talking about experimental technology here, Rogers. You’re a perfect subject for this-”
“Clothes will only be an inconvenience at this stage, sir.” Tony said, biting on his lip; he knew that Steve was always suspicious, but the fact that he thought that he wasn’t being watched would maybe cause him to relax a bit more. “It’s advisable to remove the clothes in order to avoid any malfunctions”
“More than anyone else. You mean a lot more to me than you’ll ever understand, Steve..”, the billionaire replied as he rubbed the man’s back softly.
“He had those in his jacket”, Fury said, tossing a couple of bloody trading cards towards Steve. “I guess he never got them signed”
Steve's eyes slowly fluttered open as he watched Tony hovering by his hips, chest heaving enough to make his lips turn dry. “W-what’s next..?” he asked faintly.
Steve’s nod was all Tony could ask for, and with another slow movement, he tilted his chin forward, lips against Steve’s as he closed his eyes. Then he pulled back slightly, watching Steve. It wasn’t a passionate kiss, barely even a kiss at all. It had just been brief - he didn’t want to scare Steve off - but he wanted to show Steve affection in a more innocent way. Just like Steve was himself.
“I uh.. I wanted to tell you something, Tony..”
“I know you must be going through a lot and if you just want company or someone to hang out..”, he offered.
“And who exactly needs saving here?” Tony said, giving him another look, the side of him that Steve had tamed coming to the surface again. “Who are you, even, showing up in my private chambers like that? If you know who you’re talking to, you know who my father is."
“Give me 10 minutes and I’ll be dandy.” Steve huffed, contently nestling into Tony’s arms, hearing the soft hum of his reactor that he could quite easily fall asleep to.
“I never felt anything for any of them before, and I just wanted the company,” Tony said with a shrug. “And marrying one of them just so I’m not alone. It just didn’t seem right to me. So, whenever they would agree, I would let them sleep by my side, be less lonely.”
“Isn’t that what you do? Why else would you be here? Do you have a name or should I call you fairy boy?”
He didn’t falter, not once, even as he stood so close, his hand reaching for the chin that was close to his and lifting it to stare directly into Tony’s eyes. Tony heard his words as he kept his eyes narrowed, always tired when Athenians would bring up the same argument, always considering Spartans to be less civilized than themselves, always thinking that they wanted help.
“Fools!”, Kang cried out, protecting himself with a force field, with the Hulk frantically smashing it. “Soon all of you shall be erased! One by one, I’ll get rid of you!”
“It was... amazing,” Steve said eagerly, kissing down Tony’s neck to his chest, nuzzling the medallion softly.
Their casual, friendly conversation carried on until a woman walked in with a bag in her hand, and Tony looked excited to bring it over to the small table, kneeling in front of it and taking out the packages. It was such a nice distraction for Steve, spending time with Tony and learning about all kinds of new things proved to be quite therapeutic.
Steve woke up to the feeling of Tony’s hair brushing against his cheek, slowly raising his head as he rubbed his eyes. Everything was blurry at first but cleared up as he looked around, the rays of sunshine streaming through the windows.
After watching him for so long and being by his side, not to mention the little moments the two of them shared, he couldn’t help but think that he was falling for the man. The way the sunlight painted his dark hair was such a beautiful sight. And then he did it, he turned around and faced the Captain; his eyes were shining, their bright blue colour that he adored.
Steve bristled and walked away but Tony didn't stop, following him to stand in front of him, blocking the doorway. “You show up and promise something, then at the first fight you decide to leave. You got me interested in your teachings and you just want to take that away and leave yet again. What do you want from me?”
“Oh? Am I surprising you? What do you think I am? I have a high interest in some things.”
Tony Stark himself, dressed in a sharp, black suit, complete with a blue tie, hair slicked back, his dark blue eyes visible as no designer sunglasses were covering them as usual. The man looked...better than he thought that he would do. Of course, he needed to see if his personality was just as bad as he expected it to be; he immediately scolded himself, being wary was one thing, but he had to give the guy a chance to present himself.
The blond sighed and stood up again, leaning his head against the cold window. He was still on Bucky’s trail, and right now, Tony was gone too. They might not have been in the closest terms, but they parted ways as friends, as allies. And that meant that he wasn't going to leave a fellow soldier behind, no matter what, not after he witnessed how far he could get, risking his life for the greatest good, just like he did with that plane decades ago.
“Cap, I won’t give up until I make you see exactly why I’m right and you’re-”
“We can have this little secret between us,” Tony said with a nod. “What do you say? Just let happen naturally. No rules, no customs.”
Steve nodded and took a deep breath, ready to fall asleep any second now.
Tony smiled in gratitude as he picked up some of his gadgets, tying them together carefully before looking around the room. “I think I’m ready to go.”
“You want what, Steve?" Tony asked him, trying to make sure.
The Avengers were assembling again, but this time around, they would do things their way. Him and Steve would co-lead the team, and something told him that he was going to enjoy this new partnership.
“No offence, Stark, but I’d rather stand on my own two feet and live somewhere that I will feel more comfortable. Preferably, alone”, Steve replied.
“Stark, wait. We need an attack plain, we can’t just rush in”, the Captain tried to say, but it seemed like he was completely ignored.
“Being the son of the goddess of wisdom does have benefits,” Steve replied continuing with the gentle strokes.
He even stepped down to the workshop, inspecting all the suits that were left idle; he was scared to tinker with him out of respect, but Steve prompted him to go ahead and try them out. After all, he had to be ready to use them if Kang set an attack on them.
Tony couldn’t help but smirk, getting behind Steve and grabbing the handles of his wheelchair.
The silence was slightly awkward, and it was Steve who decided to break it.
Before realising, the bearded man lifted Steve’s chin, their lips locking for a split moment. His heart was beating so fast, his eyes shut after being widened for a shocking moment, pouring himself into that chaste kiss, so soft and pure. It was nothing like a quick, sloppy, lustful kiss, no, Tony knew how to make this special, how to make his heart flutter. He could feel the heat rising up to his cheeks as they both pulled away, not really saying anything for a few moments.
“If I were you, Captain, I would keep my eyes on Stark”
“I have in the past. A woman with dark hair had caught my eyes, and I had to stand and watch her in the arms of another. I watched her age and I was there when she died,” Steve said, keeping a strong face.
Tony chuckled softly, giving him a brief kiss. “Well, what do you think of it?” Tony asked, raising one eyebrow. “Could it be a sign? If you want to see all this in real life, you only need ask."
“You were right, you know,” Tony replied with a shake of his head. “This is a lost battle; I should stop hoping that there’s any saving me or my people. Nothing changed for so long; I doubt anything will do now. We’re sticking with our ways, and you with yours, and we will fight, just like it’s bound to happen.” He moved back, away from Steve.
Steve looked up at him curiously, resting his arms along the edge of the bath. “Why do you say that?”
The Avengers just finished putting away the Wrecking Crew for yet another time; some criminals just never learnt their lesson, Spider-Man was so kind to remind them.
“Perhaps my journey here was not so fruitless after all,” Steve said with a smile, touched by Tony's words, with genuine hope starting to glimmer within him once more.
“From what I’ve gathered, you’re close friends too, you don’t simply have a professional relationship”, Steve raised an eyebrow.
“I understand nobody deserves to be alone or have what they most care about taken from them,” Tony said. “And I make a promise on this day, Athenian. I, Son of Ares, will do everything in my power to save your people and stop this madness from happening.”
“No, actually I came in to greet our guest”, she said with a calm smile. “And to remind you of certain meetings that you need to attend before the end of the week. Also, I’ll need your signature and to approve some of the recent transactions overseas”
“Told you I would give you killer legs”, Tony winked playfully.
“So, did these guys put you in the loop? I can give you a tour of the facilities and then we can start getting ready.”
Under normal circumstances he wouldn’t have stayed at all, but Tony was the son of a god, and that created a sense of leniency that Steve hadn’t expected in himself.
They were outnumbered, there was no question about that, and even if Steve was the best shot, there was still no way they could come out of there without getting shot.
Once he had secured the other, they slowly moved down, placing Steve on the ground and testing the rope for ascension. Hard, but feasible.
“So, you never had a bath with other people around?” he asked.
Steve tried to take deep breaths in through his nose, to exhale them through his mouth, but he let out shaky breaths each time he did. He felt dizzy, resting his forehead against the bed, but he kept his lower body raised, trying to relax his muscles as much as he could, feeling every movement of Tony's fingers.
His tunic indicated some sort of power even though his looks didn’t remind him of a normal Athenian. He seemed to in contrast with Tony’s olive skin and dark hair with his paler body and straight, blonde hair, though they both had the same, bright blue spark in their eyes.
The large wolf wrapped his tail around Tony as they slowly drifted to sleep, slowly but steadily being replaced by strong, built and hairless arms. The cold that Tony felt was soon repressed by the warm chest of his now furless boyfriend.
Steve folded his arms over himself again, letting out a small huff as he was splashed, keeping quiet.
“Hm? How so?” Steve asked, looking at Tony.
“I.. meant every single thing I said, I swear..“ Steve replied, attempting to approach the man on the floor.
Steve shook his head, but Tony was able to spot a smile as he walked past him and into the elevator. Tony kept complaining when they got stuck in the traffic, going on about how faster it would be if he could fly them both in their destinations, but Steve was pleased that the trip was slow, as he could look at everything around them, tall old building, golden decorations and statues, things he only saw in books before. He jumped on his seat as the drove past Moulin Rouge, fascinated by the red windmills as he kept repeating how he always wanted to see them in real life.
Steve let out a sigh, knowing that he had to take this decision. Suddenly the guilt from their previous argument on board filled him in. Tony was proving him wrong, right here, right now, and he couldn’t even apologise to him.
“No, look," Tony huffed, “I need to break it down slowly to them, you don’t understand. You keep saying how Athenians are more civilized, and none of them wanted to hear that. I had to make it stop, or things would end up badly. If you can show me what you mean, away from them, maybe I can show it to them as well without upsetting anyone.”
“Of course they are waterproof, do you think that I would make them into jet boots but let water destroy them?”, Tony shook his head as he got out as well, shivering lightly. “Let’s go change, it’s getting darker and colder. I bet you’re starving too”
“Mass murder and blood-lust are characteristics of demons,” he said, fixing his sandals and sitting up properly, brushing out his tunic.
“Do you trust me?”, he repeated himself.
“I’m fine, Tony..”, he said, giving him one of his strong nods.
Steve shifted a bit in his seat. “I think it’s going to be a while until I’ll be able to get some proper sleep, if I’m being honest here”
Steve ran ahead, clearing the way for Tony, looking behind his back to make sure that he was following closeby - what was he doing?!
Steve turned around as soon as he heard his name being called, to see a blonde nurse approaching him.
His fists were clenched up, his expression nothing but dead serious. He was furious, Tony could tell that he was piecing everything together; the nightmares that he had been having for months, Tony’s shady behaviour, the rest of the Illuminati avoiding him. It was making sense to him, and the engineer just knew it; Steve wouldn't forgive him, he was the one who made the final call, who gave Strange the order to do it, just because they knew, everyone knew that him and Steve were the closest. The worlds were colliding again, and at that very moment, it seemed that those lies, those deaths, everything was for nothing. Their world was threatened again and to think that the choices they've made didn't save them at all made him sick. It was a repeat from when he was in Paris a few years back, he felt like throwing up, but he had to appear recollected in front of Steve.
“Why would you stay with a woman if not to, be with them?” Steve said, choosing his words carefully.
“You could do that”, Tony nodded. “Jarvis, Rogers here wants to ask you a couple of things, be nice”
It was so amazing, how a simple embrace, a common hug, could be so unique and so soul touching. That was just the beginning. Tony’s nightmares didn’t exactly stop; but it didn’t matter, Steve was sleeping by his side, waking up when he would feel Tony even switching sides in his sleep, making sure that he knew that his guardian, his soldier, was there to protect him, to comfort him if he needed to. It worked both ways; Tony would do anything to ensure that Steve was feeling well, that he knew that he was doing what was best and encouraged him to try and find his lost friend. They were each other’s pillars, more than ever, and nothing would have happened if Tony didn’t finally let down those walls and let Steve in. They were together now, and nothing else mattered. They were unstoppable, they could anything. All that because they were finally together.
“I can’t hate you, Tony. I love you, and I will forever. You’re stuck with me for a lifetime”, Steve replied softly, whispering in Tony’s ear.
Tony gave them another sharp look, but they insisted on keeping him safe, which did make sense when he considered that the soldier grabbed him and threw him on the ground just moments earlier.
“I’m coming, don’t worry, your bacon won’t get over crispy this time around”, Tony chuckled as he fixed the photograph and gave it one last look before yelping as Steve nudged his shoulder.
“It is your culture,” Steve answered, “So, no, there is no need to excuse yourself.”
“What about space? He could be there, right?”, Clint asked.
The next morning, none of them seemed to recall another nightmare attack. Steve confirmed it, and so he did the next night. He could get used to this, sleeping next to Tony, drifting away peacefully, the reactor’s light keeping the dark away from them.
“Not really... they looked like...doctors of some sort.”
Steve looked at Tony’s hand for a moment and then shook it firmly, feeling a small spark as they touched, his eyes darting up to Tony’s eyes to see if he felt the same.
“Then not really, I mean, I have an inquisitive mind,” Steve said, “Especially with modern cultures and customs.”
“Can’t say I do. You didn't seem happy to see him though. Well, this has been great, but I really need to get going now.”
“Negative”, the billionaire replied from inside the suit, still seated on the table, arms at side. “Those functions are exclusive to the Captain”, he said again, giving Steve some time to process what he said. “They are not defensive or offensive, they are part of Mr. Stark’s entertainment scheme”, he added.
“Hey, I have a lot of questions..?”
Despite this not being the first time Steve had said it to him, it did sent a shiver down Tony’s spine, pulling the super soldier down for a long, passionate and slow kiss, before pulling back again to look at his lover. There was something special about that particular night, something special that he only seemed to witness when he was around Steve, something that hopelessly romantic people would describe as “true love”. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t. Truth is, Tony was starting to understand those people, he was becoming one of them without his approval. The man next to him was the blame for that, but he was absolutely fine with it. Pepper was right, the end of the world was near. Tony Stark was in love.
Steve smiled at the kiss, giving him a lazy smile instead, quite visibly tired. “Loved,” he was relieved to admit, reaching for Tony’s hand to hold.
“Just you then, but still teaching in Sparta nonetheless,” Steve said, “I’m excited. To teach, that is.”
“Like what? Having your heart break to pieces with every single one of our fights? Almost killing each other then softening it up with some sweet words and forget everything? Feeling like we.. we need each other so desperate to feel complete, to feel ourselves again?”, Steve replied calmly, his own heart aching as he admitted how he really felt.
Tony looked at him and just nodded, buttoning up his own shirt and getting hid blazer. “I understand that you need some extra time but.. you can’t just stay here. There’s nothing for you here, or even around you. Nobody lives here anymore, Steve, I told you that everyone moved into the main part of the city, and with good reason..”, he explained.
“How does it feel, Captain? To know that you’re the cause of all this? I would love to take credit for myself, but I have to share it with you… He could have been alive, you know. I've seen it happening. But no, the two of you had to have this in a different way… I’m not complaining.”
Those were their first words to each other, and Steve tried to approach him a bit friendlier inside the jet, while Loki being held hostage was eyeing them.
“I’m not doing this to get anything out of it other than the chance to inspire others. I don’t want anything else out of it.”
“What..?”
“If I were you, Athenian, I would watch the way I talk,” Tony answered. You speak of manners but yours seem to be the worst, coming into my home and insulting my people where I could have you killed on spot for your words. We are Spartans; we do not follow or answer to anyone. What makes you think that we want to adopt your ill-fated ways? You’re losing this war as far as I know, and nothing can change that."
Steve shook his head. “You should be filled with pride, Spartan. Count your blessings,” he said, picking up his things and getting to his feet. “Regardless, I will lead my people and we will fight until the last man stands.”
Tony chuckled sadly, his palm over Steve’s hand. “I’ll remember that promise.. Don’t let me down, I will do my best to not let you down either”, he nodded, shutting his eyes, letting Steve pull him closer for a hug, both of them sitting on the bedroom floor, by the bed they shared for so long now.
“I’m sure that you’re underestimating your skills, Athenian,” Tony replied with an honest nod. “You are probably as good as any of them.
Tony opened his mouth to reply, but he stopped, trying to consider his answer. What did he want, really? Whatever it was that he wanted needed to be shared with Steve, but he didn’t want to force Steve to do anything, or even be here against his will. “Do you? I’m not saying that I don’t, but you need to be clear with me, Athenian. Why do you keep doing this? Why are you touching me, kissing him in such intimate ways?”
“Is that the custom in Sparta?” he asked. “Is it rude for me not to reciprocate?” He wanted to know. He was curious, always curious, especially when it came to learning new things.
Steve was speechless, looking at the void down under.
“What about me?!”
“You’re a good man, Tony. You say that people get the wrong impression but.. if they bothered to actually get to know you, they would understand”, Steve said confidently, reaching out and giving Tony’s shoulder a light squeeze.
“Your father and my mother are one and the same,” he said. “They both like to ensure we follow their plan. They give us gifts, but we have debts to pay.”
“I don’t want to be alone either," Tony agreed, thinking for a couple of moments. “Do you want me to come with you? Do you trust me enough to let me inside your city walls?”
He had what many would call a crash landing, falling on the nearby road and getting himself together; he was going to do it, he was going to make them pay. As he walked towards the door and kicked it open, he felt a sharp pain on his legs, falling down and screaming as the pain moved on the back of his pain.
“What do you think? I invited you in my bedroom in the middle of the night to banter with you.”
Steve looked at the sticks and tried to hold them on the same way Tony did. “How..?”
The first boy was named Stephanos (Steven – the modernized term), a frail young boy doomed to die from ailments at a young age, born in the centre of Athens. Athena saw the child and took him under her wing, claiming him as her son to care for him, nurturing him until he was a tall, gallant man who took pride in his knowledge of law and justice for his people.
Steve frowned. “You may scorn the dead all you wish. Feel free,” he said, backing even further away and starting to turn away from Tony to walk back to one of the pathways.
Steve swallowed the knot in his throat, trying to breathe past the nervousness that had gathered up in his chest. “Y-yes....” he said with a nod, trying to reassure Tony as much as he was soothed by Tony's touch.
Tony shrugged, even if Steve wouldn’t know, not knowing that he was actually there. He was sure that Steve understood what he was suggesting, and he tried to shake off the annoying thought that Steve would rather give himself to the suit than to him in reality.
Tony looked at him, trying to hide a smile, but this shy, reserved side of Steve was something he found himself enjoying. “Uh, I wanted to show you that I like you,” he said in a lower voice. “And I don’t know if they do, I never really had many friends to begin with. It felt sort of, right?”
He wasn't sure he wanted to tell Steve all of this, but Steve was a fellow demigod. He'd allowed Tony to see him like this; it only seemed fair that Tony should give him something in return.
He did indeed stay awake for the majority of the night; by the time that he received the call from Happy and heard the doorbell, faint dark circles appeared under his eyes. His hair was neatly parted on the side, wearing more comfortable clothes instead of his uniform like he did the day before.
Steve stood with his spear in his hand, shield strapped on his arm, prepared for an ambush just in case. It never hurt to be too prepared, so he was taught.
“You seemed adamant to shut me down earlier,” Steve said, raising one eyebrow. “Why the change of heart?”
“My God..this can’t be...”, a voice was heard behind him.
“And you want to change that?” Tony finally whispered, his heart feeling heavy.
“That too, not that people didn’t try to link those things together, the press loves making the stories up and I do love coming up with plans to fool them - but I guess that my teammates should know.. Or at least, you should know.”
“All of my clothes?” Steve clarified, speaking slowly as he looked to the suit for approval, his eyes caught by its bright, glowing cyan eyes.
“Do you trust me?”, he heard Steve’s voice saying to him.
Stane chuckled and eyed Steve. “Aren’t you going to introduce us, Tony?”
“They are not insults, Spartan; I pose but questions to you. Have you not noticed my inflections? Am I not clear with the way I speak? As for my people, I do not see that we are losing as of yet. We have risen victorious from many plights before; what is written in the tapestry of the fates that says that we are doomed to lose? Nothing,” he said without flinching, watching Tony’s movements with his sharp eyes. “You do not control fate, Spartan, nor can you foresee it.”
This was ridiculous; his death shouldn’t affect him that much. And then Fury carried on talking.
Tony picked up his pace, encouraged by Steve’s moans and soft groans, focused on pleasuring Steve. He gritted his teeth at every thrust, unable to form any other sentences than Steve’s name, and he felt Steve push himself aback against him, enjoying this more now that he was used to it. “Do this for me," Tony said as he leaned forward, whispering against Steve’s ear.
Tony was hardly able to sit still with Steve making the first move, raising his rear in the air before moving to sit on the metal length, enjoying how he seemed to take it in, not hesitating or complaining at the feeling, just like he argued with him before. The same feeling of jealousy that he felt before overtook him, especially when Steve didn’t call him by his real name like he did moments ago.
“Guys, hold on, we have a bigger problem here”, Tony called, flying towards the water. “Nuclear missile, I have an idea of where to put it. Keep that portal open”, he said, trying hard to match the missile’s speed.
“Y-yeah.. Roger that.”, the blond nodded, arms wrapping around Tony’s back.
His first reply would have been ‘to be with you’, but Tony decided the second reason was safer, for now. “So that you can teach me more about your people, experience everything first hand.”
“Steve. We’re not on duty, Tony”, Steve corrected him. “Listen, I was meant to say... That I take back what I said about you that day. I was wrong, when you flew up there, ready to die... You are a true hero, Tony Stark. You were right, you are nothing like your father... you are a better man. Just don’t be that.. reckless sometimes and I know you’ll go far”, he said with a faint smile.
“You may do as you please; a man is his own,” Steve said. He was still trying to flick his hair out of his face, but the wind constantly blew it back.
The big, marbled tombstone had his name on it:
The nightmares happened way earlier in the night than other times. Tony sat up quickly, looking over Steve, who was shaking more visibly than any other time. Drops of sweat were rolling down his forehead, his light gray shirt already stained. He was holding tightly on the bed sheets, his teeth gritting together. What scared Tony the most though, were the screams. They occurred so often, and it felt like Steve was actually calling for help.
Steve’s heart filled with rage and sorrow the moment that the image of his burning city was placed into his mind, his natural protective instincts suddenly bursting out from under the seams. He clenched his jaw tightly.
“She has more lives than a cat, she’ll be fine. Besides, we left their ladder unattached.”
Oh well, he should have known it, the Irish weren’t meant to be trusted or expected to obey American habits and traditions. They stayed together and formed their communities, and Tony wasn’t fond of any Irish fella he has the honour of meeting so far. Tony wasn’t a man of patience, he hated to wait and even more to be disrespected.
“Password..”, he muttered, looking around for any clues as to what this could be, but came up with nothing. He didn’t know Tony, so he knew nothing about him and what his password could be. The only thing he did know was his father, since the two of them shared a connection due to Howard Stark’s relation to the project that birthed Steve. Still, it wasn’t enough, he needed more info on the man if he was to use his technology to try and find out more about this century. Yes, he was offered help, but he would rather not share some things with a complete stranger.
Tony breathed into him, Steve's lips against his own all he wanted to feel before his last breath left him, Steve's last words echoing in his ears. “It’s been an honour fighting...by your side.." he said as he reached for Steve’s hand, placing his own on top of it as his eyes closed, the loud noise of the battle around them barely audible any more.
“You know best,” Steve said nervously, wondering if what he was saying was right. “I’m unsure, perhaps I should turn.”
“What is it, Tony?”, he asked him worryingly; he could see that the colour disappeared from his face, a bad sign of course.
It all started with that pair of piercing blue eyes that stared at him through those golden slits; at first, Steve Rogers thought that they looked menacing, terrifying even, belonging to someone who posed a serious threat. And indeed, due to the initial shock, Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers did have to explain themselves and take a confused and out of time man back to the Mansion.
“If you were alive, what stories would you tell?”, Tony asked the body, arms crossed as he leaned a bit closer, the man’s eyelashes resting peacefully.
Steve was clenching up his fists up to his face to prevent himself from showing any further signs of emotion, eyes widening in shock as soon as he heard the words that came out of Reed’s mouth. Tony was alive. A different Tony, maybe, but he was alive.
“Sure, sure, Steve”, Tony laughed as he let his back rest against the couch, eating and just enjoying himself with Steve.
“We are friends; at least I want us to be,” Tony replied quickly. “If you want that too."
“Yes?” Steve asked, reaching out to caress Tony’s jawline.
Tony found it hard to look at Steve’s eyes with the way he was looking back to him, especially after hearing his words. “You know, I really need someone like you to teach me how to keep him out. It took a while to get him out of his shell,” Tony said as he tilted his head to the side, feeling Steve’s wet fingers against his skin.
His breath hitched for a moment, eyes opening and drifting over to the suit in all its polished, shimmering glory, trying to listen to the automated words as his own palms were placed against the table he was on, trying to hold himself in place, the light foreign weight on his lower body making him quiver.
“I didn’t mean to scare you," he said after a while, knowing that his appearance was strange to Steve and that it, combined with his loud voice, was probably the reason the blonde had pulled back.
“I thought that I’ve lost everyone, I truly did.. but it seems that I’ve found someone here that changed this.. that came to mean so much to me.. that’s you”, Steve said softly.
The constant reminder of his own and his father’s failure to save the whole of their home lead Tony to search for more ways to develop all kinds of new technology and find new means of energy that they could use efficiently, before the current sources ran out. Nuclear energy and  hydropower were what he focused on, and small expeditions were carried out by men of his company, trying to use the best of their resources and give the people what they were after. Much to his subordinates’ annoyance, Tony often wanted to be involved in everything, including putting on a less fancier parka and walk through the snow far outside New York, his comfort zone, looking over the operations. What he didn’t know, was that, not too far away into the future, those trips of his own would lead him to something much greater.
Steve watched Tony and then tilted his head up, looking up at the stars too. “I wonder if I have changed the tapestry of fate, by telling you what I knew.”
“It’s..strange..”, Steve concluded, pulling the bowl of bean sprouts closer to him instead.
“Oh come on, Obi, I know that you were probably snoring the night away by the time I got back in New York”, Tony said, and Steve was surprised to see that he was using the same tone to face Stane off. Maybe he knew exactly what he was doing and Steve wasn’t giving him enough credit of knowing how to take care of himself.
“Are you blind? Turn on the light, I’m not an intruder, I’m doing my job!”
“Why would meeting the women change my perception of you?” Steve asked. “Do they plead for you?”
He wasn't gone after all.
“I’ll pass on that, mister. I’m not the type of fella who gets all roistered up”, Rogers replied, looking around for a bit.
The sky was falling down. Dark clouds were surrounding him, he felt the burn of a thousand suns scorching his skin, even through the heavy suit of armour that always protected him; hiding in his suit, that’s what he always did, but this was about to change. It had to change.
“Pleasure”, Steve simply said as he firmly shook his hands and stepped inside the car, not really having the time to admire the interior and the fine leather sits they were sitting on. Tony’s voice was heard in a distance as he was left alone with his thoughts yet again, the car starting to drive through the loud city. He didn’t pay much attention, but the sights made him even sicker in the stomach; everything looked strange and different, it was nothing like the city he once lived in and knew exactly how to navigate. It felt like this was a strange new place he didn’t belong in, and every time they passed a shop, a new house, the large screens advertising all kind of things reassured him that this was true.
The first thing that Steve noticed was the strange smell and the way the air actually felt heavier to breathe in this environment. He pulled his coat further up to cover his nose as he reluctantly followed Tony, who seemed to relaxed and comfortable, clearly in his environment again.
Falcon folded his arms, shaking his head and letting out a swift sigh. “You have much faith for men who are considered to be stubborn and pig-headed, and they are children of Ares, Steve.”
Steve’s hands didn’t move from his knees, He kept touching the cold metal, moving his feet slowly, just making sure that they were working absolutely fine and that this wasn’t a dream. Of course that didn’t escape Tony’s watchful eyes.
Steve drew the shield back and looked at Tony, staring straight into his sapphire blue eyes, “Why didn’t you... Why were you so ashamed, after I gave myself to you?” he said.
“You’re loyal to your cause and beliefs, Athenian, and whether you believe it or not, we Spartans do appreciate loyalty very much. You can’t change the way people think, especially if they are following the words of the Gods. However, you might suggest what you initially had in mind about your way of ‘helping’ us," Tony finally said. He could see how uncomfortable the man seemed to feel, especially after their short brawl. “You can have your weapons and we can discuss this in private if you wish," he suggested.
“Mhm.. I should have done so sooner.. if I knew that you would react like that..”, Steve said softly, looking up after a while and caressing the man’s soft cheeks.
Tony was there, they were both in a separate room with dim lighting. He looked exhausted, but didn’t speak right away.
He admired everything, having heard about Phidias’ work, but he'd never had the chance to see it up close before.
Steve panted, “That was a... Dirty trick.” He panted, his head rested just by Tony’s shoulder, watching him and how pleased with himself he seemed to be, the sticky liquid covering his upper leg and hip.
“You say that but I’m sure you’re flattering me,” Steve said, moving to rest his head in the grass, still staring up at the sky.
A proud smile appeared on his face as he trailed the star on its centre, turning around quickly when more lights went on, revealing more of that strange room to Steve. There were banners, posters, even comic books and figures, anything that a ten year old kid during Cap’s glory days would dream of. At first, he didn’t question why Tony had all those things in that room, he just walked around, taking in everything. Yes, he believed that for now, he couldn’t wear that uniform and grab that shield again, and this collection only proved his point. Looking at his reflection earlier, the dark circles forming around his once bright azure eyes, he could tell that he was nothing like the sentinel of liberty who saluted by the star spangled banner or punched Hitler right across the face. If the world was going to have such high expectations from him, he couldn’t disappoint them showing up like a mediocre Captain America wannabe; they wanted the real deal, and Steve right now was nothing but a shell of the former Captain. The thought devastated him; once being the hero everyone was inspired from was all he had, a poor art student’s dream, and right now, he didn’t know where to stand, and if he could even stand on his own two feet without a little push from people who he didn’t know if they were even alive anymore.
Tony looked at him for a couple of moments, thinking about his answer. He wanted Steve there, more than anything. He wanted to be Steve's friend, but he wanted to keep doing what they had done together, to feel Steve's lips against his own, Steve's arms around his chest. “Yes we can," he nodded. Who knew? Maybe they could be like this and share their bond, and Tony would be all right. “I want us to be like this”
“Steve, believe me, I had nothing to do with this, I’m just as angry as you are-”
“Tony, if that’s how most of your people are, I’m not surprised why you need a bodyguard”, Steve huffed. “That man seemed deranged”
“I promise I will, just.. let me do it, Tony. Don’t be afraid, trust me, I’m as scared as you are..”, Steve replied more softly, hesitantly raising his arm to touch Tony’s cheek, sighing in relief when the man didn’t push him away. “I promise.. everything I promised, everything I told you about our future.. I swear it, Tony, we’ll make it work, I’m not leaving you alone in Hell, heck I would follow you there blindly if I had to”, he said, gritting his teeth.
Despite it all, he found himself perplexingly forming an amicable relationship with both the man who gave him a home and a new purpose in life, as well as his employee, a man who served as a teammate during the various Avengers missions, that he shared a life out in the battlefield and got into the toughest situations with, coming out on top with his help. It got even more confusing when during one of those training lessons, he ended up on the gym floor, with Tony Stark himself on top of him, proud smirks across both their faces.
“Of course your arrogance precedes you,” he said, stepping forward quickly and using his shield to shove Tony back.
There was a certain, subtle tone of sadness in his voice, and it made Tony’s chest feel heavy, feeling sorry for him. He was thinking too much of his own well being and how the Captain’s presence would affect him, that he kept forgetting that the one with the most issues was in fact, Steve. Seventy years passed from the moment that Steve was lost in the sea, and Tony didn’t want to bring his hopes down, telling him that most likely those friends wouldn’t be alive. He nodded though, offering his help was the least he could do.
It clicked in his head; this robot was meant to entertain him in what Steve would deem as their own private activities. He looked around, yet again, his sense of paranoia at its peak given he’d very rarely ever been completely alone in the mansion asides from when he was in his room or at the gym. He swallowed hard, “How long is Tony going to be away for?” He asked instead. He cursed himself internally, was he actually considering giving his consent dependant on how long he’d be alone? Well he had urges too, especially being a super soldier with his increased stamina and youthful internal functions.
Steve smiled. “I’ve said this a million times before, but I love being in your company,” he said, “so much so that the Gods blessed me with visions of you in my rest last night.”
“What…?”, Steve muttered as he turned to Reed for answers.
“And I will look after you as much as you require, in return,” Steve said, resting his cheek against Tony’s. “I owe you a debt for promising to save my people. And for being a friend to me.”
When Steve spread his legs, Tony bit on his lip, seeing how he was more open to him, giving himself so willingly, just like he did every night, fulfilling every deepest and darkest desire of Steve’s. Now it was his turn to have that privilege, and with another swift movement, he pushed inside a second finger, his eyes narrowing as he pushed Steve to moan more, even louder.
Steve leaned into Tony’s touch, nodding with that uncontrollable faint blush.
As soon as he set foot on Peloponnese, he realized how different mainland Greece was to this land and, passing by the close temples, he noticed how they didn’t seem to be as majestic as the ones back in his own city. People there lived much simpler life, consumed by their desire to be strong when it came to their military and economic power. However, he was determined that they could have a change of heart and listen to him and what he had to say, and he marched on, breathing on an air of determination. He stayed close to water, taking it when he needed refreshment, eventually arriving at the large structures that indicated the entrance to Sparta, gazing up at the guards. He couldn’t say that he wasn’t nervous, but he had a duty, and he trusted his mother to protect him, no matter how troublesome that journey may be.
The walls were full with drawings that seemed to have been there for centuries, the most common theme among them being a large figure with what seemed to be a crown on its head.
“It does. That was a requirement during my training, and I can assure you, the cold is not my weakness,” Tony replied steadily. “You can hide inside but I’ll be outside, braving it.”
The blonde eyed him from head to toe, probably thinking of the possible escape routes and how to bring down the possible threat that was unraveled. However, this Stark guy was right, he couldn’t trust him but he didn’t have any other choice. Walking around in those clothes, in the middle of a snow storm with no proper idea of where he was or what even was the situation would have been a foolish move. Asserting his choices, he let out a heavy huff and got Tony’s hand, standing up and fixing his half torn suit, with as much dignity as he could.
Steve’s body tightened as the suit pulled back, instead wrapping the red powerful gauntlets around his body and hoisting him to sit on its lap. He leaned forward for a while, trying to catch his breath from the sudden movement. His hair flopped forward; already beads of sweat trickled down his temples as his face remained tainted a rosy red. His eyes darted down as he saw the new extension, biting on his lower lip. He wanted to feel that slick cold metal inside him again; he needed to feel pleasured somehow, especially when his own body ached with lust. He had an idea as to what he should do but it was just a case of plucking up the courage and doing it. His hands sliding down the tri-beam plate down to the waist pleats, etching every detail of the suit into his mind. The twitch of the long fingers around his back made his muscles shift, “Do I--” He stuttered, looking into the glowing eyes of the suit for approval.
It all started a couple of months ago.
Taking a deep breath, he started changing into the star spangled outfit, putting on the bright red gloves and boots, looking at his reflection on the dusty mirror before pulling up his cowl, covering part of his face.
Steve looked at him carefully and then focused on the circle of light; in a strange way, the light felt inviting, comforting even. “It has the power to give you alive..”, he said as he scooted a bit closer to examine it. “I think that it’s beautiful, makes you one of a kind..”, he blurted out.
He didn’t wait for Tony to say anything, instead he flew towards him, grabbing him from the shoulders while they headed towards the back rooms. Tony’s gun was fully charged again, blasting soldiers away and clearing the path. The heat from the back of Steve’s boots seemed to have burnt some other soldiers who tried to snatch him as he flew past them. Moments later, they had corned Zola in his lab, his back turned as he was talking to Tarleton, planning their escape.
“So, what do you suggest?” Tony asked, tilting his head at Steve’s observation.
“You’re here, I think that’s good enough”, Tony purred, standing up, still close to Steve.
Steve shook his head, “Everything I do, I do for my people.” he said firmly, “We are demigods; we need to look after them.”
Steve stood by the door, arms over his chest, pouting at Tony with a bright red blush over his face. “I...” he stuttered. “Is that what friends do? None of my friends in the past had ever...”
“But you were ready to walk away," Tony pointed out as he moved a bit closer.
“Let’s go find it, then.”
Tony shook his head. “Because, in reality, who really wants to get on the bad side of the gods?” he said. “And anyway, you might call fear, but it’s different. It’s like watching everyone that ever doubted you just stopping, letting you do your work, without mocking or questioning your authority.”
“So, you’re still alive, huh? And here I was getting excited that you were gone”, a familiar voice was heard in the distance.
Steve watched carefully looking around them for any traps, but couldn’t spot any.
“Hey”, Tony said, and Steve turned to him, his palms on his legs. “It will be all right, trust me.. and if not, I’m here to help”, he said with that reassuring smile on his face. He wanted to do more, maybe hold his hand, but that was enough for now.
’ The words from Falcon echoed in Steve's ears with a haunting drone as he brushed his hand through his hair, pushing it back and out of his face. In truth he had come to try and talk Tony out of fighting, out of war but it seemed that the Spartans took so much pleasure in it, more pleasure than he would’ve ever thought. To him, death was death, floating souls in the river Styx. Having to suffer the same fate his soul had been nearing was something he could never wish on anyone else.
“So, how long have you been out here for?”, Steve asked, having to shout to be heard through the storm and the loud noises of both the helicopters and the people trying to get everything in order.
Now, both of them were competitive and perfectionists by nature, so more elaborate recipes and builds were attempted, and it was when Steve argued that there shouldn’t be so many different ways to make a decent cup of hot chocolate. Tony of course teased him, asking if he quit and Steve huffed, keeping a grumpy face the entire next day until Tony came in with a new cup, this time with an edible chocolate spoon.
“The results aren’t too bad so far. In fact, they seem to be perfect. Too perfect. Which of course is good, it will speed up the procedure and lower the chance of any unwanted side effects happening.”
The children used to shout names, obviously getting told off afterwards by their parents, but still, that didn’t stop them. So he was afraid of being yelled at, of being bullied.
Tony rubbed the back of his head and avoided to look straight at him. “I can’t say for sure what happened to your little apartment, pal. Or the state you would find it in to. But I’ll find a way to get you there if that’s what you really want”
The walls seemed that they were shining, covered in large screens, a surely expensive rug on the centre of the room, the large, comfy, futurist chairs surrounding and the small table in the middle.
A faint pink blush painted Steve’s cheeks. He just got complimented by an attractive man who just happened to be a fairy as well. A real fairy. Well, that was a memory he would be unable to forget even if he wanted to.
“Hey, it takes some time, don’t worry, it will work now, I’m sure”, Tony tried to reassure him, petting the soft fur in a consoling manner.
“I mean, you and Iron Man are never in the same place..kind of weird for an employee to never meet his employer, right?”, Steve pointed out, still unable to take his eyes off him.
Tony didn’t waste any further time; the second that Steve opened his mouth, he pushed his tongue inside, hungrily sucking on his tongue, trying to thrust in deeper with every single one of Steve’s pushes. The sounds Steve made were music to Tony's ears. “More," he groaned in pleasure.
Steve fell asleep and throughout the night they moved around until they were finally lying next to one another, with Steve curled up with his arms tightly wrapped around Tony, nuzzling up to him contently as he slept.
“I left it back in the temple,” Steve said. “I saw no reason to carry it with me. I would usually, but after previous occurrences... I thought otherwise, as punishment.”
“If I didn’t know any better, you would marry that girl in a heartbeat”, Steve smiled.
He was lost in his thoughts for so long, that he almost didn’t hear the snarls and growls of the wolves that circled him, and he stood up to defend himself with his spear, launching forward for attacks. The rest of the pack ran away when he finished one of them and Tony growled right back.
“So, think about it really hard and it will work. Like wishing on a star when you were a kid?”
“Athenian, having a heart is always a disadvantage,” he replied as he shook his head. “You can’t stop war, if that’s what you’re trying to do. Humans will keep on fighting. Look at our parents; they are gods but they still argue and swear revenge upon each other. You can’t stop this. But you need to come out on top every time, don't you? To be stronger than the person next you. You think strength is what that matters, do you think that we just enjoy pointless brawls? We fight to survive, as you should.”
“But not everything you do has an impact on them,” Tony said, rubbing his temples. “This should be exclusive to you, to me, Steve. All we do, what we share between us, that’s just for us, not for anyone else. That’s how I want to see things, Steve. If you wish to carry on, I want it to be because you feel it, you really feel it. It’s not part of a deal, or obligation.”
Steve didn’t exactly talk to Tony about his past, but he occasionally dropped a couple of things. Tony was a smart guy, he figured out how to piece the information together, did his research, read the files. He knew about Peggy, Bucky, even his father and everyone else that fought alongside Steve during the war.
“I’m sure that we’re all very thrilled about this, but Rogers here might need some rest. I suggest that we send him home and start the tests tomorrow”, Tony had to shout to be heard over the loud noises and people who were trying to get another closer look at Steve’s legs.
“Uh...” Steve rubbed the back of his head nervously. “My skills are sub par.”
“That’s a great turn of events, isn’t it? You really have a way of making an impression on people, Rogers”
“Uh..Captain..Nobody leaves in Brooklyn anymore”, Tony said slowly. “The government has gone bankrupt a while back, and even though we’re doing way better now.. the pollution level in those areas are still high, so they avoided to rebuild and fix everything there.. Your house is still there, I’m sure, but I don’t know if you can actually go there anymore.. I doubt it..”
He looked at Tony. “You threaten my people, son of Ares. You could have prevented all of this by listening rather than being quick to persecute, if you had been humble. Bury your pride for once!” he said, trying to hide a sad glint in his eyes at resorting to violence.
Steve nodded. “Took me a while to get the idea, I started off thinking about how much we love smores, then I wondered how possible it would be to seal off a cup with a giant marshmallow..turns out that is more effective than I thought”, he replied proudly.
Steve nodded innocently, his eyes fixed on Tony; he could feel Tony's breath on his skin and swallowed hard. Though he’d never really had a friend before, he liked receiving those kisses, and giving them, and now Tony was closer than any other man had ever been to him before.
“I’m done, don’t worry”, Tony chuckled, seeming way more comfortable than Steve did, even though when he spotted the soldier turning again, his eyes focusing on the device on his chest, which he quickly tried to cover up.
“Is that what you want? To be on the ground again?”
“And do you say that you didn’t do the same? That you wouldn’t defend your city with your life at all costs? I don’t kill for fun, Athenian, and neither do my people."
“No, I have nothing to teach you,” he said.
“What’s your actual name?”
“Then by foot,” Steve said, leading the way out until he reached the doors of the large palace, letting Tony lead whilst they were in the public eye.
“So, are you happy with them?”
much.
“Are you sure about that? Is that how your mother Athena taught you? Meddling with the son of her hated brother?” Tony asked as he started circling him once again.
Tony felt his heart racing. All he knew was that Steve was pushing himself away, away from everything he had wished for. He actually cared for Steve, yes, he actually loved him, and he hadn't realised until it was asked out loud. And yet, he couldn’t bring himself to say it, especially when everyone seemed to disapprove.
Reed walked outside the makeshift morgue, and Steve stopped holding his breath as soon as the door was shut behind them.
When Tony first announced that he was needed for an emergency meeting in Paris, he didn’t think that Steve would want to tag along. Well, Steve was indeed a curious person, and even though his memories in Europe weren’t exactly pleasant, he still wanted to visit all the different parts of the world and get to see what Tony had to deal with. Tony rolled his eyes in amazement as the taller man gave him a huge bear hug and ran to their shared by now bedroom to fix his suitcase, as he didn’t seem to realise that the trip wasn’t until next week.
. It felt so surreal, so scary, it made Tony to almost want to run away from the sight of it.
“Captain? Are you following?”
“What was that?” Steve asked, taken aback. “H-how is that proof of any sort?”
“Are you ready..?”, Tony’s voice was heard next to him, to which Steve replied with a simple nod and took the keys Tony handed him.
“Are you hurt? Did he do anything to you?”, he asked with visible concern, sighing in relief when Tony shook his head.
He got ready, slipping on his gun holsters over his dark blue shirt and brown trousers, taking one of the bags with him. Steve soon joined him with the heavier things and guns, all concealed for now, looking like a proper tourist in his hat.
That last moan really did it for him and with one last, deep thrust, he pulled his mouth away from Steve, letting out a loud cry along with Steve’s name as he climaxed inside him, dropping his forehead against Steve's back, panting heavily, cheeks all flushed.
“Sorry to keep you waiting, dear”
Steve tilted his head. “Are we done with the experimentation for tonight then?” he asked. “You look about ready to fall asleep.”
Tony was truly amazed by Steve’s ability to switch from the light bites to the deep, longing kisses, enjoying every moment of them as he pushed his head closer. “Steve. Can we..?” he asked with a soft gasp.
“An appointment, is Mr. Stark expecting you?
“You need to come in terms with this… he didn't die because of you, Steve… he took responsibility of his actions-“
“See you tomorrow, Tony. And thank you. For everything”, he added with a thankful bow of his head, stepping outside. He knew that Happy and Tony stalled so they could make sure that he could walk into the building just fine, and Steve didn’t disappoint them; he felt proud, relieved that he could do such a simple thing on his own.
When they ended up back at the hotel, the night had fallen already, and even though they both had a few drinks, Tony had a bit more, and Steve had to carry him once they got in the elevator. The Captain didn’t approve of Tony’s drinking, but tonight was an exception since they were together on holidays and he just wanted to have fun, with Steve being there to look after him. He wasn’t drunk, just heavily tipsy and exhausted from the meeting and trip, while Steve was still wide awake and functional. The tall man placed him on the bed, Tony rolling over and covering himself with the sheets with a silent groan. Steve let out a soft chuckle, his fingers brushing through the black mess, slick as always, his eyes focused on the calm, sleepy face of the billionaire, who always seemed to be so sure about himself, his ego which seemed unbreakable when they first met all gone now as his face muscles relaxed, letting out soft moans. Just like that, Steve fell asleep next to him, only to wake up a few hours later, probably midnight judging by a quick look at his watch that Tony got him, despite telling him off for not having the numbers displayed on it. Tony groaned again, stretching his arms as he sat up drowsily, rubbing his eyes.
“I like you too, Spartan,” Steve said, smiling contently as Tony held him. It wasn’t often people touched his waist and it was sensitive. It made him tense for a moment, but he was relaxing into the touch soon enough.
The son of Zeus stepped up to Tony, giving him a passing warning glare, always one to uphold the rules. And then he was leaving with the son of Cupid alongside him, practically being dragged out by the demigod with a hammer.
“They’re clean towels on the closet, you’ll find clothes there too”, he called as he rushed down the hallway.
Tony wanted to say that he wasn’t so sure about that, but he remained silent, gesturing at a different area than the one the Captain was kept on, a nice desk and cosy chairs for him to sit on. However, the soldier seemed firm, crossing his arms and looking at Tony who was already sitting, expecting a full explanation.
“You can’t keep me here against my will, Tony, it has to be.. mutual”
“Do you feel ready..?”, Tony said after a small pause, seeing that Steve nodded steadily to him. “Then I’ll take you there”, he confirmed. He could only imagine how Steve would feel, overwhelmed, disappointed even, but he would do his best to be there for him and offer him his support in any way he could. “You may want to rest tonight then.. at least try to”, he pointed out, knowing for well that Steve still had great difficulty sleeping. He could still hear him sometimes, pacing down the hall, watching TV to pass time, listening to music that Tony suggested to him..even dressing up and heading to the lower floor to use the gym equipment. Tony saw him punching those bags before, admired his strength and got intimidated at the same time. To him, it felt somewhat strange at first, getting to know someone he only knew as a costumed hero, his hero. He thought he would never have the chance to talk and meet him, but right now, he wasn’t talking to Captain America, no, he was talking to the man behind the mask, Steve Rogers, and the truth was, he actually really liked the guy. At first, he feared that he would be disappointed, that the man wouldn’t meet his expectations, but it turned out that he enjoyed his company and the time they spent together more than anything he could ever imagine.
That particular night seemed different. They went to bed at the same time, something that was almost rare amongst them, Tony always stayed up late working on everything he could think of, and Steve was retiring to the bedroom, bored and hoping that Tony would get the hint. Eventually, Tony would sneak in after a quick shower, and take his side of the bed, careful not to wake Steve up, even though they both knew he was wide awake.
