“That depends on your answers.” Sam stated. Bruce grinned but decided to not engage into the discussion.
Natasha gave him a more or less soft blow on the head. “You’re not funny, Barton. Not in the slightest.” She smiled back to the three men on the couch. “Sam that idiot is Clint, Clint that’s Sam who brought down SHIELD with us, and I hope you remember Captain America and Iron Man.”
Pepper rolled his eyes. “Come on, Rhodey, let’s grab a coffee and our Captain here can meet Tony, without us bugging them.” Rhodey grinned with a bright smile, before disappearing with his friend.
“You’re okay?” Steve asked because the sad expression was not leaving Tony’s face, in fact he believed Tony was on the verge of tears. “I just thought about my funeral.” Tony admitted without taking the look away from the yellow roses that looked half death. Steve swallowed. He would not talk with a twenty-year-old about death, would he?
“Everybody wants their parents around if they are sick…” Bucky murmured. “And even if Tony is acting like the king of the world, he’s twenty. He’s a kid.”
“Yeah, I’ll do it right away. Rest a little, someone will be there at all times. And I’ll come back, promise.” She stroked over his forehead and kissed his cheek before getting up to leave the room.
He shivered only by the thought of it. Absently, he could hear and feel how his heartrate was rising and his blood pressure with it. He wouldn’t have a panic attack right now and right here? Next to this utterly beautiful human being. No, that was not going to happen.
He could not let him go, not like this. “Tony.” He said softly, trying to smile a little. “Thank you.” Stark raised an eyebrow, totally not understanding what Steve wanted from him. “You came without hesitation, even if you knew it would probably destroy your relationship. You tried to help, you did. You saved us with Hill, and she told me it was your plan. You decoded most of HYDRA’s data. Thanks to you we know at least some of the faces.” He paused a moment and squeezed his shoulder.
Steve woke in the hospital. He was surprised to be alive but also surprised that he actually felt pain. His headache was killing him. He saw Sam sitting next to him. He smiled, but there was also a little sadness inside of him, Tony must know about his state, wouldn’t he be here?
When Steve came back, he met the others just outside Tony’s room. Nat had been the last to come out of the room. She had just closed the door behind her.
And seeing Tony like this, after a week of hospital food, enjoying what he prepared, smiling and giggling… That was something he wouldn’t destroy even for peace upon the world, because this right here must be heaven. It was Steve personal heaven.
He was too slow to catch him, and he fell onto the ground. Steve gasped forward, but the harm was already down. “Hey, man! Wake up!” He said, while feeling his pulse and trying to make out if the man was still breathing. “Fuck, fuck. These things only happen to me.” He murmured while he opened the buttons of his sleeve. He saw a group of students just starring at them and he nearly jumped.
“It’s worse than you told us… I mean we knew, Tones… Because that’s just the way it is with you… but this… Did you hear what he said? Your birthday is in six months.” Pepper raised her voice first.
Tony shook his head. “No, come on. I just think it’s his business attitude. And the company would be fucking nothing without my Dad or at least me, it carries our name.”
“Tony.” Steve tried to get him to understand without spelling the problem. But Tony just stared back to him like a five-year-old trying to understand how babies were made. “You sure you’re a genius? Cause right now, I’m doubting it. Seriously, you don’t see a problem with that?”
“You know, what?” Steve murmured after only having read the first five pages of Tony’s work, since the genius asked him to reread it for grammatical mistakes. “I always thought, I wasn’t dumb. I even would have said I’m a little over the majority of the society, but reading this?” He laughed, when Tony grinned proudly into his direction. “I think learning Mandarin is way easier than ever understanding this, I mean, how do you want me to look for grammatical mistakes or vocabulary, when I can’t even spell half of the words. I am dumb.”
“No, you don’t have to stay, Dad. There’s nothing you could do.” He heard Tony’s voice from the living room when he entered back. For a moment he wanted to go upstairs and take a shower before saying his hello, but since it was probably Mr. Stark’s house he should probably great him first.
Steve pulled the man again against his chest. “I’m so sorry Tony.” The smaller man started trembling in his arms and then Steve felt wetness against his shirt. Tony cried silently, without sobbing and without any change in his breath. Steve hated it. This showed him just how much Tony learnt to push his feelings beside and that his emotions had never been important enough to be acknowledged.
“I tried. You’re a big boy. Take a long shower, don’t save the shampoo, use the whole bottle and brush your teeth, for like five minutes at least, use mouthwash too, please. I will call for take-out since I’m sure you’re out of anything eatable.” He closed the door before Tony could say another word.
He suffered from the loss of his best friend and his chance on Peggy; only to find out now that Bucky was totally still alive and ready to kill Steve on the right commands. Not to forget that even if his friend was healed he might face the death penalty and all their work would go to waste.
“Come again.” Steve whispered threatening, staring down into Stane’s eyes. He knew Stane wouldn‘t back down or shut his mouth, but it was enough to see some respect in his eyes. Not that he wanted his respect. He wanted him as far away from Tony as possible but this was only wishful thinking for now.
“Your mother had the insufficiency on the left side. For you, that’s also the worst of the two but the right side is only slightly better to be honest. You’re lucky Tony. At least your arteries are looking good.” Yinsen had shown honest concern in his direction. “You almost left me in there, you know? Again. You’re 20 years old, Tony. I don’t need that on my conscious, okay? I will talk to a few colleagues. It doesn’t seem untreatable. There may be a chance without waiting for a transplant.”
“Thank you, Jarvis.” He said automatically. Steve’s heart was still beating, and he could make out his breath. He was only unconscious. He was alive and that was all that mattered. While JARVIS kept an eye on Steve’s vitals, Tony took his hand and starred down at the man’s face. He didn’t let go, until the medics arrived and sent him away.
“You tried to hide it, but since my condition I got pretty good at reading people’s faces. You looked like Rhodey when he found out about my heart problem.”
To this day, he had no idea how he managed to get his friend and another wounded soldier back to their camp, how both of them survived. But they did and even if Steve was hounded by his nightmares. He woke up and knew that Bucky lived.
Steve really wanted to process that message, but he would do that later, alone. Right now, there was another message pretty much blinking in front of his eye.
Tony rolled his eyes but was still relieved that Steve didn’t make a further comment to his tears. Not that there was actually something to say about that. He was only being a pussy, again. “Great.” He answered ironically. “I will help.”
“I can’t okay? If I don’t take over, Obie will and everything I have been working for the past years will go to waste.” He reasoned.
Steve still didn’t stop smiling. “Go to bed, okay? I won’t clean everything… just the pizza boxes, the bottles, snacks…”
Dr. Yinsen sighed. “I know I can’t force you, but if we don’t get you a pacemaker now… I’m not sure you’re going to see your 21st birthday. Also, that would give us time to cure you completely, or at least to make sure you can live with that thing till you’re a hundred years old. I really don’t want to transplant you… I don’t wanna hope for the death of another person so you can live.”
Steve felt how Rhodey tensed up next to him and how much he disliked the idea of these guys staying with his friend. So, Steve as he was, extremely impulsive, made a decision. “Mr. Stark? There’s actually something you could do for me. I’m here to see Tony anyways… If that’s alright with you I could stay, keep an eye on him and keep him some company. I’m an army guy. He’s safe with me and like that I could learn something about his project.”
After their planning, which Tony had not joined, Steve found him on the bridge over the cave. Silently, he placed himself next to his friend and leaned over the parapet. He wouldn’t say a word, it was Tony’s choice if he wanted to talk or not.
He only stayed alone for another ten minutes before Bucky arrived with some of the others, he didn’t even see at first. He threw himself right on Bucky and the tears restarted running over his face. He was able to withstand himself from sobbing at least.
“Stupid.” Bruce contradicted. “Tony’s not doing good since Loki. This is another trauma. He shouldn’t have.”
Until now, it hasn’t even seemed like Bucky would fight, even if he was attacked himself, but Steve meant what he had said. He would kill him if he ever attacked Tony. That was it. It would kill him inside, but he would rather live with that than visiting Tony’s grave.
Steve hadn’t slept a minute. He relaxed and his thoughts wandered, but that was all just too much sleep for him. He had slept more the in the last week then he did in the last weeks and months in Washington. Tony needed it though, so he would gladly let the man use him as a pillow.
There were two cars, adding the one he just drove, Tony must have three. There was that big workbench and in the middle was a huge table with three monitors and a laptop. To his right was a couch assembling and a TV, a little kitchen place. Steve was sure behind one of the doors was a bath, so Tony could pretty much live in here.
Steve only nodded once to her. “Outside is a coffee machine that you can use, and you can buy yourself something to eat down on the second floor.” She informed him, before leaving.
“Tony told me, I’m his best friend, of course he would. I spoke to Natasha and Rhodey about it. Rhodey will give you the shovel talk when he’s back.” Pepper admitted. Steve restrained himself from answering that he wouldn’t be in the States anymore when Tony’s other best friend returned.
That was deep for someone just waking up from an operation and as far as Steve knew certainly for someone like Tony. “Can I take your hand?” Steve asked, before answering. Tony turned his hand around, so it laid invitingly in front of Steve, that put his palm directly into Tony’s and squeezed it. “And now, listen to me… You can ask Bucky or Sam or even Nat. When I put my mind on something, I’m never gonna give up okay? I put my mind on you, Tony. So, if you tell me you’re not ready for anything now, that fine… I can wait forever and if you tell me you’re not interested I will leave you alone, but…”
“Don’t worry, I know you’re not that kind of guy.” She sighed. “Since we’ve got the apologies behind us, am I allowed to ask why you look like that?” Tony smiled for a little moment.
“Why does that shock me even more?” Bruce asked confused. “But fine, you trust him, Steve does, I can go along with that…for now.”
But Pepper had also made a good call to let Steve pretend to be his bodyguard. They made their photos but everybody backed down when Steve walked in their direction with Tony close behind. He was nearly sure he heard him laugh about the situation behind his back, which the genius denied later.
And those were the reasons why Tony had been afraid after the fight when Steve refused to talk to him for two days straight, because Steve hated what had been decided, and Tony already imagined how Steve would take his friend at night, and leave with him to be on the run for all their life. He thought Steve would choose Bucky over him, do exactly what Tony expected him to do but what Steve had promised wouldn’t happen.
“Hey, Stevie.” Bucky murmured softly into his ear. “You worked yourself up again, huh? You could have told me, I didn’t necessarily need to see my physio this morning. I could have been here from the beginning.”
“Okay, I’ve no idea what your planning, but fine I will play along.” He put his head into his hand, leaning on the armrest of the couch. “I’m a billionaire, what could I want?” He thought aloud. “We could come back to your spanking idea.” He said laughing.
“Hurry up.” Steve laughed but everybody knew that Cap wanted this shit done as fast as humanly possible. Plus, the sooner everybody went back to their task the sooner he could check on Tony. He wouldn’t do that in front of the others.
“Rhodey, listen… The last one, was… I got lucky.” He glanced at Steve, who didn’t know what to say, he knew since this morning that Tony could possibly die, but seeing his friends, his best friends staring him down, near to tears, that made it scaring real. “I need a night or two to think about it…”
“We had a long night. He couldn’t sleep, after we went to bed. He left to go to see Bucky, and that information was forced out of JARVIS. He came back and was a mess. He only fell asleep after watching three episodes of New Girl. At first, I believed he passed out.”
“I didn’t!” Steve clarified. He would never approach a person that was in a relationship. Maybe it all happened fast after Pepper but that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. He couldn’t imagine Tony alone in that mess. “Let’s go back to the job. Nat, Clint? Anything from your contacts in Russia?”
Pepper shook his head. “Sadly, not. He told Howard, it was useless and that Tony was probably already dead.” She sighed. “But Howard would never give up on him. I mean they don’t act close at all, but they are. Howard is all that Tony has, and Tony is all that Howard has. Even now, I know that Tony’s more worried about his father than himself. I knew he was back in Afghanistan.” She leaned back on her seat, looking around the group of friends.
Surprisingly, though, Bucky sat near the glass wall. He looked exhausted just like Tony, worse probably but also calm, not as if he would kill him any minute if he gets the chance. The billionaire had to force his body to stay calm. It wouldn’t help either of them, if he would freak out.
Steve raised an eyebrow at him and grinned. “So, you hit on Pepper and Clint. I feel like I have to keep an eye on them.”
“I have to do it, my doctors said the next time it would kill me, so it’s either dying by trying to live, or dying by doing nothing. I’m not that kind of guy to give up.”
He even felt as if the walls came nearer and nearer. He had to get out of here and do what his soul needed. He needed explanation. There was no sleep until he understood the how’s and why’s.
“But, Cap… Steve, I’m not misreading this, right? Like, I don’t even know why I’m asking, because you’re clearly not that kind of guy, but still… I wonder…” Steve turned back to Tony, waiting for him to come to his point. “You’re serious about me, us, right?”
“Yes, eventually. I know it’s not possible from one day to another, the company would crash and we have contracts, but as soon as possible.”
“There are some ‘ifs’ in your sentence.” Tony detected but he smiled regardless, so Steve was hoping that he gave a good answer. “I don’t want you to choose between your best friend and me, hell, I couldn’t choose between you and Rhodey… Just, I think I need some assurance for our relationship. I don’t want you to drop me, if he’s ever back in the picture.”
“The annexation of the old territories by Hitler was not liked by everybody… They were forced to fight for the German Reich. You couldn’t refuse. People didn’t know if their neighbor was for or against the Nazis.” Steve sighed. “Was actually worse after the war, when those territories were back at their respective countries, soldiers faced trial for collaboration with the enemy. I read a few history books about those trials when I woke up…” Steve straightened himself. “Why are you talking about that?”
“Sure, but once again you proved that you’re not an egoistic bastard and can work pretty well on a team.”
Tony crossed his arms and looked back at the Tv without answering. It was the replay of a basketball game, some kind of greatest plays ever. Steve was pretty sure Tony had no interest in basketball but didn’t want to switch because that would mean he was purposely evading his question.
“You’re right. We need to know how they got HYDRA into his brain, how we get it out and if we have to prepare for more of those guys. And frankly, of what I saw and what JARVIS scans indicate, he seems quite similar to you.” Tony agreed.
“You’ve never kissed a man before? Lucky me then?” Steve grinned and leaned down for another short kiss.
And all that could only lead to one single conclusion, Steve himself suffered from PTSD maybe worse than Tony. In the past months Steve had never taken the time to process all these events. He had been busy fighting again and looking after his new boyfriend. He probably had a minor sexuality crisis, because yes, he could be openly bisexual in the 21st century.
“What do you mean?” He asked directly. Tony was definitely more of a straightforward kind of guy, so was Steve. That prevented miscommunication.
He just finished the outlines of Ty’s face, when he saw movement on his left side. He turned around to see Tony slowly opening his eyes, bewilderedly looking around the room.
Tony could be his future, there was no doubt about that. Steve had to take a chance on love, and his chance was the man in his arms. He was not certain, he would get another chance on him, if Bucky would show up again. So maybe it was about choosing his future or deciding to get back a part of his past.
“He is a serial killer, but he’s not in his right mind. I believe HYDRA brainwashed him, something… We have to heal him, whatever the costs.”
“Are you serious?” There were anger and some kind of worry in his voice, he didn’t now, if Tony was worried about Steve or about himself, or their relationship, but at least he was acting like didn’t care at all. Steve couldn’t retain a second of a smile on his face.
“I’m just too happy, I can finally do everything I wanted to do for months. You know I really appreciate what you did.”
Steve blew out the air he had been holding for the last minutes. “Believe me now?” He asked Tony, raising his eyebrow at him.
The man looked at his feet, which was a motion Steve had never seen in him. He had always walked with his head up. When he saved Steve, when he was in the war, first front. Even when HYDRA captured him, when Steve found him, there was no head down. And after Bucky became the Winter Soldier, he hadn’t seen a sign of shakiness in Sargeant Barnes.
“Yeah, he did. Tony basically uninvited him. He said he would only get more anxious if he knew his dad was running around the hospital. And I had the impression he didn’t want to have his uncle around.”
He nodded. “Can I go back to sleep now? With you?” He asked, already knowing it was impossible for both of them.
Tony’s heart melted when he looked into Cap’s face. It should be illegal to be hot and cute at the same time, but Steve pulled it off perfectly. JARVIS would have to print him a photo of this look. A hundred copies at least.
While Obadiah started whispering to the security guys, Howard Stark came up to them. He looked at Steve. “You’re a friend?” He asked curiously, but with a tired voice.
Steve swallowed. “I can’t tell you now, later. It’s terrible and I was happy he wanted to leave, really. He told me, but since he found me…”
“Thanks for coming, Doc, I appreciate it, I will take care of him.” With a smile and a nod, the doctor left the two lovebirds on their own.
“So, I think I need explanation.” Sam asked later, when they were back in Tony’s kitchen, drinking coffee, as if they were not just sitting a couple of floors above the Winter Soldier himself.
“You think I am afraid of a fucking fag?” He sneered. “Whose cock did you blow to play captain?” Stane grinned up to him, probably waiting or hoping for Steve to take a hit at him, just to report him to the police. But Steve had had military training, he definitely had heard worse and he clearly wasn’t as dumb as Stane hoped. He just kept on staring down on his opponent.
The man sighed and opened his eyes to stare up at Steve. “I’m just being a pussy.” Steve shook his head, smiling down. Like last night he put his hand into Tony’s hair, which seem to calm him. “I’m a broken man, Cap… You sure want to keep up with that?”
“We…” Steve started but had no idea what he wanted to say. Finally, he turned to look at Tony. Surprisingly, the billionaire did look back at him, forcing a smile on his face, while tears ran down his cheeks.
Instead of giving a summary to every chapter, I decided to put parts of song lyrics in it that came into my mind while writing those chapters. Those titles are also the inspiration for the chapter names. The songs don't necessarily have anything to do with the chapter, it's only my brain playing songs in my head.
Steve didn’t know Tony for so long, but this… He knew he would soon meet another side of the man. “You believe they were killed?” He asked no emotions in his voice and if Steve would not be Captain America, he would actually be afraid now. There was something coming up on Tony he didn’t like seeing. This was no anger, no sadness. It was the face of a killer, as much as it hurt Steve to admit it. Tony was ready to kill.
“He’s not wrong, but he just doesn’t want to lose his best friend, it’s not about the fact that he saved you. He would do that again, every day if necessary. He loves you and wants you to live.” I’ve known you for a day, and I want you to live. He didn’t say that, but frankly he couldn’t imagine Tony to be gone within the next months. His heart broke only at the thought of it.
“Do you think I wanna know which part you’re playing?” He shouted. Tony opened his mouth to explain to his friend that they actually hadn’t come to that part yet, so he couldn’t be a 100% sure that Steve was a top, he was only 95% sure. “Shut it, Tony! I don’t want to hear anything!”
Nobody had caught an eye on them yet, people seemed to believe the story that Tony needed a bodyguard, what he even probably did and Steve was that impressive that people actually prevented coming to close to them.
Pepper blew out her cheeks, trying to calm herself down, before she would explode. She failed miserably. “Since you came out of that cave, I’ve always been there, I tried and I tried but it didn’t work! You don’t want anybody’s help Tony! You’re better off alone.”
Bucky nodded at closed the small book. “That’s the thing with genius kids, right? Thanks, by the way, I think I like reading. I’m not sure I always did, but I do now.”
“If he usually shows up at every game why wouldn’t he this time? Even if I would consider it as a little too soon, but well. I’m a mother hen, right?”
“But, I personally want to thank you for your understanding. At first, I was not sure if I should tell you, I thought maybe sparring you was better. But you’re a genius, you would find out eventually. I decided it was better you were told as fast as possible and from a teammate, a friend.” Tony nodded but Steve still did not let go.
“Okay, I try. Steve’s best friend from the war, Bucky Barnes. He fell off a train, and he was presumed dead. He’s alive, HYDRA, the crazy Nazi organization that infiltered SHIELD, saved him and he was turned into a killer machine.” If Pepper was shocked she didn’t show any signs of it. “Steve and I found proof that it was him that killed Howard and Maria.” He ended.
And in that moment, Steve could believe that without any doubt. And for just this once, he actually believed that he deserved this. “I love you too. And now sleep, we can talk later, maybe grab a coffee. Wait, no coffee for you, tea, yeah you’re invited to tea. And cupcakes, crêpes, waffles if you want…” He started babbling, what a love declaration could do to Captain America that fought fucking Nazis without any second thought.
Steve had hoped for longer sleep but Tony woke just in time for the dinner. “Nightmare?” He asked, when he saw the confusing in Tony’s eyes and his fast breathing.
They got him in that helicopter back to a hospital, where Steve was again sitting in a waiting room and praying to God to save his best friend’s life. It was worse than with his mom. He had prepared for her death, but Bucky… In the morning he had been joking around with Steve, playing football with the rest of the company when they got their mission call.
“Why were you having an attack when Pepper was there?” He asked right away. Tony clearly expected something else. His look was pure shook but Steve didn’t want to waste their time doing small talk. He knew these things and if not, it was probably all over the internet.
“Sir? Miss Potts is currently down in the lobby. She’s asking for permission to enter the penthouse and have a conversation with you.” JARVIS announced around lunch time.
“You’re getting into something that’s too big for you, I don’t want you to get hurt in the process, or after.”
“Serious, man? I’m 20 years old, call me Tony.” The corner of Steve’s lips went up. Yes, he definitely liked Tony Stark already. “So, what’s with the uniform? Don’t got any other clothes?” Tony asked after he had invited Steve to take a seat.
On Sunday, Pepper came over with Nat and Bucky and they spent the whole day trying to distract Tony from the thoughts in his head. He had been so quiet in the morning that Steve wrote Natasha a message that sat the people up to come to Tony’s place.
“Yeah, but… no.” Tony shook his head. “He might want to get a bigger part of the company, but he would never do any harm to my father. They have been friends for years, even before I was born. He helped my dad after my mom had died. He would never.”
“Yeah, course… I was full of drugs and the hottest guy I ever met was sitting next to me and comforting me… I’m not doing that only for me, okay? I’m not that egoistic.”
Pepper sighed. “Fine. I don’t know what you’re still thinking about, but it’s your decision, and I will be by your side, whatever you decide.”
Steve rode shotgun while Tony took the seat behind him. The first minutes of the ride where silent, but Natasha kept on watching Tony in the rear mirror. “How’s Pepper, Tony?” She asked. They looked eyes in the mirror for only a second, and she knew.
“Dizzy, drugged, but not with good stuff, stupid.” She laughed once and held his hand tighter. “You wanna kill me with your hand?” He asked.
Bucky laughed. “Yeah, something like that. Maybe something not too cliché, plus Tony is a guy, I’m not sure he would appreciate flowers that much.”
And then he had been on that hospital. Praying, crying, before sobbing again, sniffing from the snot running out of his nose. He had puked a few times on this day, every time he recalled the memory of Bucky on the battlefield bleeding out of where there should have been his arm.
“My strategy is working out just fine, thanks for your input. And yes, this time, I bought red flowers.” He proudly showed them right into Bucky’s sight, who only rolled his eyes.
“It is. Don’t forget HYDRA did experiments on him while he was captured. I think they might have succeeded in making another super serum, different than Steve’s, probably…  I mean, it’s HYDRA quality. But, my point… he survived, and he’s back.”
“I’m too heavy.” Tony declared but wasn’t really convincing. He said it more out of principle. The time someone carried him into bed were gone since he grew too big for Jarvis to do it. Dating a super soldier, apparently came with some benefits.
“At least you’ve got great company.” Pepper smiled and nudged Steve in his side, the latter put on a shy smile into Tony’s direction.
After a shared breakfast, Steve asked Tony if he could show him a running route. Tony made yet another face at him. ‘Yeah, the kid with the heart condition surely knows where you can do your shit sport, braggart…’ And then he had tossed a phone at Steve. ‘Use that, it calculates while running how long you can still go. Enjoy yourself.’
“Well, my experience with men mostly happened when I was in my teens and my twenties, I wasn’t really into something specific… after that I was mostly with women, and if then there was a dominant, it was me, so I never tried.” The billionaire answered when he had followed Steve into the kitchen.
On his way there he regretted it a little and decided to buy some flowers. He decided on roses, at least they were yellow. He regretted that too when he was in the elevator up into the sixth floor. He hid both presents in his jacket, even if it would kill the flowers. He also hated the fact that Bucky talked him into wearing his uniform. He looked ridiculous in here.
Steve nodded once, ready to leave the room and let Tony handle the rest of it. Surprisingly, the billionaire seemed to actually be clearer headed about this situation. He would do what was necessary, and Steve knew he was to close. Maybe Tony’s breakdown helped him see things in another light.
Steve put his hand on Tony’s arm and waited until his boyfriend looked up to him. “Not anymore.” He said seriously. “You have us. You have me!”
“Oh, now I understand.” Bucky laughed. “You fell for him, no wonder. Met the guy, he’s pretty hot, genius, rich. I would take him, if I wasn’t so afraid of my girlfriend.”
“Oh, no… I mean yes of course, Sir. But…” He took a deep breath. “My best friend lost his arm in combat. He’s part of your program for the prosthesis. He’s really happy about it, as am I.” Howard turned back and looked at the door of his son’s room.
Tony straightened up in front of him and Steve even got a little smile. “Thank you, Steve.” He looked down at the streets for a moment, he was thinking, Rogers recognized this face. “I was not totally honest with you guys.” Tony admitted and looked back up to Steve. “Pepper left me. I’m alone. She moved out. It’s final.”
Steve nodded before he realized that the other man couldn’t see it. “Yeah, no, I won’t say anything. See you soon, Rhodes.” He ended the call and took a long deep breath, now he needed to talk to that stubborn kid in the other room.
“Right now, Tony. I want to spank you, so get up.” Tony’s eyes, that just had to hurt like hell, grow wide.
Bruce shook his head a few times. “A week ago?” He asked then, while Tony actually expected him to come with contra-arguments.
“What is it this time? Loki again? The Mandarin? The military? HYDRA… And yeah thanks for calling for help.”
“Well, Dr. Yinsen told me before that it would probably take a little longer than usually. He just wants to really look at his heart, so that maybe he can see what’s wrong and find a way to heal it.”
Steve shrugged. “No, well, I hate weapons of any type but for now the US can’t be without weapons, and if we need them, then I rather have the best ones to offer.”
“So that’s it.” Tony told Bucky, when the prosthetics clipped on his stump. “You have the SI app, right? Like that you can give direct feedback, and there’s a phone number you can call if there are any problems coming up.”
“Didn’t know, you were so dominant. I kinda like it, makes you even hotter.” Steve decided to not listen to the brambling Tony gave away. And he surely did not listen, when Tony started talking about taking a shower together and him feeling something coming to life in his pants.
“You bet I have.” Tony had answered, and the next day all of the Avengers had accepted the new way – the Stark way – even Clint when he had suddenly needed to report directly to Tony.
But now he was here, next to him as support. Apparently, he had accepted this was the only way for the moment being but that they still could change it in the future. The government, the people, hell the whole world just needed an assurance that they wouldn’t let an assassin run free.
Steve had seen his most vulnerable parts, and now Tony realized the harm he had done and tried to hide away to not get hurt. He couldn’t yet trust Steve enough to be sure he wouldn’t ever hurt him. Steve needed to act as if the genius was a stray dog… Silly metaphor but maybe it was a little true.
Steve waited in Tony’s bedroom. The shower was running, and he had picked the thickest hoodie he could find in Tony’s wardroom. Plus, sweatpants, winter socks and a pair of boxer shorts. The man had spent days in the cold workshop with a shirt on, Steve found him shaking. He needed to warm him up again.
“Made me think of my father. I wished it would happen to him… But basically, I had read all imaginable children books and I was done with it at seven years old. They were just too boring, so I decided to take some out of Jarvis bookshelf.”
“Yeah, sure. Whatever you want, kid.” Tony took a sip of his coffee. His very first in one week and Steve couldn’t decline him that one. “But for now, we need to solve the other problem.”
“You know I have a nose, young man.” The named doctor told him an hour later when he checked on Tony. The scent of fast food would probably stay in the room forever. The doctor listened to his chest and checked what the heart monitor had been recording over the day.
“Hey! U, Dummy? Where are you guys?” Tony called into the room and seconds later there were two… robots? Were they robots? Well, ‘they’ came straight to them, and they made blipping noises and Steve thought he was losing his mind but they kinda sounded happy.
“Yeah, he was one of the German scientists at the beginning of SHIELD. No wait, he was Swiss, I think. What about him?” For a moment Steve was confused, how Tony could know that the man was Swiss, when even he did not know that a day ago. Okay, he might have forgotten for a second, that he was talking to a genius. Tony had probably read it years ago in a paper and just didn’t forget it. Why the fuck was he even thinking about it? He should really get to his point.
“So, young man.” Dr. Yinsen entered the room after a knock. Steve and Tony just both had finished their breakfast, and Steve hadn’t yet been able to talk to him about anything. “I heard you didn’t sleep so well last night.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, Mr. Stark, I thought we separated in friendship.” Tony sat up on his bed, looking around and wondering where Steve had wandered off. He sighed and shook his head.
“It’s nice to meet you, Sir! But no thanks, I’m happy your son is recovering, your company is already doing enough for us.” He reassured the man he had seen a million times on paper, in TV. Steve had always been intimidated by the man behind that billion-dollar company, but now… right in front of him, he looked as small as Tony. Just older and maybe weaker, even when it was Tony’s heart that had stopped.
Steve had lain awake the whole night. Not only was Bucky’s couch extremely uncomfortable -so he was clearly not staying here for two months-, but, as he had predicted, thoughts about Tony hadn’t left his brain. Even if he doubted Tony would ever be interested in him there was still this question mark if he would make it through. This would be the horror story of his life. He couldn’t have fallen in love with a guy that died shortly after.
Tony had been awfully quiet the rest of the day. He stayed alone in his workshop, but he wasn’t really working, that was at least Steve’s impression, when he brought him lunch down. He just sat in front of his laptop and was watching movies or photos.
“Let’s give them a little time, a coffee would be nice.” Pepper encouraged all his friends to get up and leave the room with her.
Tony sighed once. “I’m shocked, Captain America isn’t taking the blame all on himself?” He murmured nearly asleep.
The one in front of him, looked like a homeless person that had given up mid-winter and was ready to die. Steve felt how the breakfast came up from his stomach. He wanted to throw up seeing his friend like this, that was worse than the killer machine. He couldn’t believe it was actually possible.
Sam looked at him with a confused look in the face. “I thought that was the plan? I mean we totally thought it would take longer, right? Where did you want me to bring him?”
The man next to her got up. “James Rhodes, but call me Rhodey…” He gave him a friendly but firm slap on the shoulder. “Thank you for saving my best friend. We own you…”
Tony nodded to himself and got out of bed, let’s go and face his demon. “Tony?” Steve murmured into his pillow. “U good?”
“I do.” Tony nodded and ate the rest of his plate within a minute, while Steve was just waiting for an answer.
“They broke up before Tony came to DC. She was here a week ago. Tony didn’t take it well. I think there was no contact since then, but they’ve always been friends, they will be fine.”
“I can show you a few things, if you want, Steve?” Pepper proposed. “I think I’m rather skilled. I kept Tony and Rhodey alive quite a few times.”
“Yeah, I mean, I needed your name to make the connection, but with that and his description of you, I connected the dots.”
“And what would happen if your father would die before you turn 21?” Steve pinpointed Tony into the right direction.
Plus, he didn’t really care that much about anybody’s opinion anymore except for Tony’s. Maybe it was dangerous getting too close to him within that short amount of time and the situations both of them were in right now, but Steve cared less and less every day.
He caressed Tony’s hair, while both forced smiles on their faces. “Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want him out of my life ever again but this isn’t my decision alone. I don’t know what’s his plan. I will help him if he wants to, but I have boundaries. You are my boundary. We both know that it wasn’t his mind but it was his face and I understand completely how that is still hunting you. Don’t stress yourself, Tony. We’re going to do that at your pace, okay?”
“Fine.” Cap capitulated. “So, what do we do? We need to take Sitwell that won’t be easy.” Now it was Sam grinning at the one half of the original Avengers.
“Could be his trigger.” Tony thought out loud. “Maybe used as hypnosis subject or maybe there’s a text in there… Try getting more out of him, JARVIS can inform Natasha and they can look out for that book.”
“Okay, why don’t you go to sit down on the couch? We could watch a movie or play video games, or chess? I will prep some dinner.”
After that he ended the call fast enough and looked down at Steve that had been laying on his lap since the day started. The blond man stared up at him but didn’t say a word. He patiently waited for Tony to confirm that it was good news or that it wasn’t.
And nobody saw the gun he took out of his backpack. It would be terrible news to see Tony use a weapon. But he had no time to think about this nonsense. Who cared for their stocks when he may lose Cap today. Nothing would be of importance if he would lose him. “I found the Captain, Sir. Follow my instructions on your glasses.”
“I hoped the contrary but I was afraid, yes… Some of your behavior indicate exactly that, but I believe you.”
Lastly, I'm still definitely planning on finishing it and it will take another turn in that direction right now.
Stane rolled his eyes. “You think, we go with that now? Your father is in a coma, and stocks are crashing, and you wanna roll with your battery and smartphone shit? I thought people call you a genius. The only thing working is weapons. It has always been like this and it will in the future, stop being an ungrateful brat.”
“How do you know that?” Tony was openly surprised, maybe even shocked. Steve saw and heard how his heart rate put up some beats. “It’s not on the market. Nobody knows how to finish it.”
“It was him. I saw footage. He smashed my father’s head. Sat him back on the car. He strangled my mom to death.” He sighed deeply. “There was a camera, he shot it after. I saw his face, clear as ice, Steve… I know Barnes face, it was him…”
Steve tensed up again. It would be impolite to beat the shit out of this fat guy, right? Maybe just a little, he should do it, though. He saw how Tony held back himself, his jaw clenched and it was impossible to ignore it.
“No, no.” Steve tried to calm him. “He’s fine, physically. It’s Howard, he was run over by car. It was a hit and run, one week passed and he is still in a coma without a change. Tony and I kinda fought yesterday partly because of it, I mean…” Steve sighed. He wasn’t actually trying to make his case with Tony’s best friend, right?
“And I thought, Steve was a bad liar.” She said, but with honest sadness in her voice. Even if she didn’t believe in their relationship, Tony was important to her as was Pepper. She didn’t like to see neither him nor her, hurt.
After some time, they spent in silence, Steve couldn't shut his mouth any longer, he had to know. It was killing him. “So, about that conversation we had earlier…”
It was still only around 8 o’clock when he was down in the kitchen, searching Tony’s cupboards for something edible. He just knew that Tony wouldn’t be such a great cook, and Steve wasn’t one himself.
Bucky shook his head. “I remember them, you know? And when I saw you, I knew who you were. I mean everybody knows you but back there at the sea, I recognized you in a heartbeat…”
“Barnes and…” He sighed. “I hate my dad. I don’t want to, I thought I wouldn’t anymore but… It came back.”
Steve lips curled up a little, especially because Tony had decided to look back at him and the look in his eyes. He had seen it before, in Bucky… When a guy in a bar had made homophobic insults and even tried to attack him… His best friend had switched into killer mode within seconds and Tony’s eyes where just telling the same story.
He would have been the one bringing her that flag, proclaiming what a honorable service her son did for their country, but what was that contrary to bringing back her son alive?
“Oh!” The man forced a smile on his face. “Thank you then, Captain Rogers. We, I own you, so if there’s anything I can do for you, just tell me.”
His parents had been too young to die. The soldiers he saw dying on the battlefield were even younger, but Tony decided to set a new record. He was twenty years old. What did that age even mean? He was hardly a grown-up. That hardly was a quarter of an average lifetime.
Pepper shrugged, they all have had those thoughts, they still hadn’t found a solution. “There was never a demand for money.”
“Is it already morning?” Tony murmured half asleep, Steve definitely moved and he didn’t like to wake up like this.
Tony or Bucky. And his heart shattered into pieces the second he thought about that. Bucky had always been part of him. A brother, a part of his soul. He never really left Steve and now, he did recognize him, in some way at least. Bucky remembered enough to know that Steve was worth to be saved.
“I wish Jarvis was here… he makes the best pancakes.” Tony announced himself and sat down on a barstool, still half asleep. “Can you push two buttons to make me coffee?” He asked sweetly. “I want espresso, double.”
“I must inform you about Mr. Stark’s being, Captain.” JARVIS told him in the elevator. The AI sounded concerned, which was not really surprising by itself but usually one had to ask him directly to get the right information about his creator.
Steve met people he had heard of before but never met. There were Thor and Loki who immigrated from Norway and their father was apparently a big man in electricity business. Steve didn’t really get it because Thor talked rather extraordinarily and quickly, and his brother didn’t talk at all. Steve would probably ask Tony later.
Before Tony could answer that, and telling Steve he definitely hadn’t been the wrong person, that just other people had had a better understanding of what had been happening, there was a knock on the door and right after, a bunch of people walked in.
Bucky Barnes did not move. He would be able to flew, he could try at least. He may could take one bullet or two, then again, even he couldn’t dodge a bullet through his head. He stayed, he did not even move an inch. He recognized the man too. Nobody did not know Tony Stark, especially since he looked an awful lot like his father. His end was near then. The Winter Soldier felt relief, even if he couldn't explain it to himself. He would greet death with a smile. No more confusion. No more pain.
“You’re hanging around with those people and me. Something must be wrong with you.” He laughed. “But no, I thought more about what you think about me. How does it come that you seem to like me?”
“I’m sad.” He simply said. Steve knew then that Tony trusted him, liked him. He never let anybody willingly see his vulnerable side. But there he was, lonely and miserable and instead of shutting everybody out, he decided to come to Steve. Without anybody forcing him. He was opening up to him and Captain America would take everything Tony would give.
“They’re fantastic together, I mean, I mostly know her through video calls. When I last departed, they were still only in the dating phase but coming back and knowing someone’s having his back is soothing.”
Steve smiled gently at him. “Of course, Tony, man… I want this okay? Not in an affair way and also not in a secret thing, okay? I want everything, but if you’re not…” Tony sat down at the table, grinning wide over his face.
The couch was comfortable, more so than his bed in his apartment in Washington D.C. It was even big enough for him. He took a blanket from a box next to the couch. It was soft and so warm but mostly – and Steve hated to admit it, because he felt like a creep – it smelled unmistakably like Tony.
The doctor sighed. “I know you’ve got a tight schedule Tony, but please take a little more care after yourself.” The doctor packed up his things. “Next time you’re dying, just write a short note or something, I want the publicity when I declare you dead.”
“Which didn’t surprise you, since you gave her the instruction to give me the infusion.” The doctor only smiled down to him, without further comment.
Tony rested his head on the pillow. “It happened about two years ago. I was in Afghanistan with my Dad, presenting a new bomb… It was the first time he brought me along, also the last one. On our way back to the airport, they raided our convoy. Five soldiers died, three lost a limb and I was missing. I prayed my Dad made it out, but I thought they killed him.”
“We don’t have a minute.” He screamed. It was not as terrible as it sounded. There were no civilians around, everybody fled while they could. Tony was the only one that stayed. So, nobody heard him losing his mind.
Even after the Avengers had finished their breakfast and Steve had cleared the kitchen, Tony was still sleeping. And honestly Steve wanted to let him sleep, he needed it and he was surprised he was still sleeping. Then again in the last 48h, if he calculated correctly, it still was only about 11h of sleep, at best. But Steve knew that Tony would want him to wake him up.
“You forced me to choose, Pepper. Iron Man or you. I choose you, and when I wanted to help my friends. Friends I fought aliens with to save New York and possibly the world, you left me. So now, I chose again, and you know what, I chose Iron Man, because that’s what I am. The only thing I’m doing now, is following your direction. You don’t want anything to do with that, fine, I’ll keep you out then.”
“Yeah, well, as I said, he can change lots of things if they get approved by the board, but he has only 40% of the shares.”
First of all, I'm really sorry. I know it has been ages, and I thought about it a lot, but there really was no time.
“Chris, Mia and Ty. I met them when I just enrolled in the army and over the years we had lots of missions together, now they’re under my command.” Steve sighed. “Mia is the only one in the army that knows about my preferences…”
Steve had tried to keep his shit together since he left Bucky’s home. On the drive back to Tony, he turned on the radio as loud as he could, he wanted to shut up his thoughts. He knew was a lost case.
Tony nodded once. “Even if Pepper’s my ex, she’s also my friend and the CEO of my company. She will always be a part of my life, is that okay for you?”
He still lived, and Steve gave himself a promise, he would bring his friend back. He would survive. Bucky saved him every day when they were children, now it was about time, Steve gave something back.
“When people say that Tony is a genius, they don’t mean a kid that’s great in maths, okay? He’s like Einstein, Elon Musk and… mh Stephen Hawking… but more like in one person?”
“Since you came out of that cave, you have developed a helper’s syndrome. And sometimes I’m not sure if it wouldn’t be more beneficial to you to change back into egoistic Tony.” Rhodey slowly calmed down, what Tony could see in his face, that relaxed more and more.
“No, you never were. Sorry. I just wished you would have told me. I tried to come home but the air force wouldn’t let me.”
Another sigh and Steve heard this tiredness again and he hated that sound. When this showed up on the genius face and was heard in his voice, that’s when he seemed really old to Steve, similar to Howard Stark. As if anything they do, would never end to be something good, and everything was useless anyway.
So, Steve had a lot on his mind and only fell half asleep around 5 o’clock. It was his smartphone that woke him again around 7 o’clock. Someone was calling him. He ignored it the first time, cause fuck he really had nowhere to be, but when it ringed for the third time without a second of a break, he picked it up as fast as he could, cause now he actually believed it was something urgent.
Steve sat down too. “He didn’t use those words, but that’s what he implied… Although that’s not the reason for my ‘depressed look’ if you wanna call it like that.” He sighed. “Is it true that you’re probably gonna die? Even with the operation?”
Steve knew that he just landed on Obadiah’s death list, if the man had something like that and frankly, Steve was pretty sure he had. He was probably already on the top ten. He could trust his gut and now it was telling him to not trust that guy and to keep an eye on him.
"You’re a good man, Tony. The best. Thanks for being by my side." He took a deep breath. "I realized one thing over the last days and especially on my ride from Washington D.C. But now, I’m ready to admit it to myself and tell you.”
“So, you’re saying that because chances are high he won’t make it through, he doesn’t deserve my support?” Only while talking, Steve realized how his voice had turned a little higher and he actually was getting angry.
Steve grinned and went along with it. “I’m a little jealous of that guy, but you can wear anything and still be the most beautiful human being I ever laid eyes on and now let’s go.”
“He doesn’t treat you like a friend. Everybody hates him and he gave me chill feelings the first moment I saw him, I trust my gut. And when Pepper and Rhodey talk about him, it’s obvious how much they dislike him. I swear something is off with him. Big time.”
“Good night.” Cap whispered when Tony had already left. He sat there and starred at his plate. It went bad, not terrible as he imagined but Tony flew which isn’t the best scenario he did imagine. He wasn’t even sure what he had expected. Hitting his head against a wall sounded pretty good in that moment.
“You talked with Obadiah about it. It took me a while to puzzle it out, but I heard some rumors of something huge coming from Stark Industries and then Pepper just told us you wanted to stop making weapons and you fought with Stane about something you didn’t want to make.” He shrugged and told Tony by it that he didn’t find out intentionally.
“I’m sorry, I think I misunderstood you.” That was the first sentence coming out of his mouth. Tony shook his head and smiled tenderly.
The chapter really is nothing special, or super exciting, but at least Tony will find out what's wrong with his heart.
“I’ve got a heart condition, that much you surely already put together yourself, it’s just… It wasn’t the first time my heart stopped, it happens when my blood pressure increases, my heart is too weak to hold it together, so it gives up. This time it was worse, it got damaged. They wanted to give me a pacemaker a long time ago, I refused… I can’t anymore. And if the pacemaker is not enough, I will need a new heart…”
“Very well, young Sir. Welcome. Do you want a drink? Maybe a glass of water to hydrate after your run?”
“I did, very. Thank you.” A little smile appeared on both faces. “But you shouldn’t get yourself involved with me, not only because of the public, but also because I’m toxic, people don’t end up in good places when they’re with me.” He dried his eyes with his scrub shirt he was still wearing. “The sweeter you are to me, the more I fall for you and the harder it will be to see you go.”
“I’m not!” He answered. “Let’s prepare lunch and after I’m having a break from the stress, with you.”
He knew already now that Tony’s death would break his heart, but nothing could bring him to the point of not spending time with the genius. He was alive now, right? Nobody lived forever, all of his friends could die soon. People had car crashes all the time. People were even murdered, or they could get sick. Why should he dwell on that when they were all there, in the present?
“Right?” Bucky laughed. “It’s fantastic, isn’t it? I mean it’s not hand warm, but it isn’t ice-cold either, I thought so since it’s a lot of metal, but it’s great isn’t it? I mean it has some bugs, but it’s still better than no arm at all, what do you think? I look great, fantastic, if Nat didn’t love me before, she certainly does now.”
Tony did not sit on the couch, not at his table but in the middle of this mess, surrounded by papers, holograms and tools. DUM-E was bumping the man without any reaction. If Tony wouldn’t sit up, Steve could actually believe he was dead.
“Steve?” Tony addressed Steve the next morning while they were having their first coffee. His boyfriend looked up to him. “How about you take the day off, today? I know you didn’t sleep; even your perfect face can’t hide that, and there isn’t much for you to do anyways? I have some super strength proven punchbag in the gym, you wanna test it? I would have plenty of other options if Loki’s madness wouldn’t have destroyed it.”
“Tony.” Steve tried again with a soft voice, he saw Tony’s distress in his face and it didn’t come from worry, he was pale and shaking and Steve could swear that his blood pressure was running way too high. At least they already were in the hospital. “You tell me you have to keep going because you’re the only one that can? Well fuck, if you keep on doing that, fucking no one will ever!”
“We need to talk! You’ve not answered my calls for five days straight. You are the face of Stark Industries. I can’t do all the work, you missed the monthly board meeting, you missed a meeting with the Japanese and I don’t have anything for the new StarkPhone you promised on Twitter a couple of weeks ago. In fact, you did that too without talking to me, your CEO.”
“You told me you wouldn’t choose between me and Barnes, but you can’t really guarantee that you will never have to make such a decision. So, I know that’s a bullshit question, but who would you choose?” Tony came back to something that was clearly still bothering him, Steve couldn’t deny him an answer.
He was very pale and thin. He looked thinner than in the morning. Although Steve was telling himself that this was impossible, Tony seemed to have lost a few pounds since then. He looked tiny too, the hospital bed, that usually was way too small to be comfortable, was now way to big. Had it seemed like that last week?
Steve got back on his legs pretty fast. He couldn’t hear a thing, but apart from that he was alright, he hadn’t been that close to the bomb. The two soldiers… well, parts of two soldiers were lying next to him now. None of them was Bucky. He forced himself up and went looking for his only friend.
“Don’t be.” Tony forced his eyes open. “I’m so thankful Steve, for yesterday and for everything. I’m not sure what I would have done to myself if I had been alone.”
It probably took him only minutes to find him, but time was a weird thing in war. He couldn’t hear, so he screamed Bucky’s name over and over again, but he neither could hear his voice, nor if his friend was actually there, if he was still alive. When he finally did find Bucky, he let out a dry sob. He saw blood, nothing but blood. His face was full of it and his arm… god, it wasn’t there anymore but all this blood. Steve had to use all his strength not to throw up.
“You are Steve. You are a good boyfriend.” Tony rubbed over his eyes. “I don’t know, last night, it sounded like a good idea, well in my head. I want it to stop Steve, okay? I need to face the demons that are haunting me so that we can move on. I want to move on with you. I want a future with you. Bucky will be a part of it and before that happens I need to stop having panic attacks when I see him.”
Bucky smiled and held out his hand. “Deal.” Tony swallowed once and forced himself to take the offered hand. “But you take care of my friend, alright?” Tony nodded.
On Friday, his mood changed yet again. Bucky came over because he got his first prototype for his prosthetics. All three of them set together in the workshop, Bucky’s stump had been prepared for weeks now, only waiting for the final results.
Steve had indeed read his file. He talked to Natasha and Rhodes, the fact that Tony was still alive was a miracle. Not only was he a target for probably half the world but he was having a fight with himself, depression, PTSD, anxiety. He honestly wondered, why the man had never tried to take his one life, Steve was happy he never did. He couldn’t lose Tony, not yesterday, not today and certainly not in the future.
“It’s an exception, only for our first date. And I will make sure you eat enough of the fruits.” And just to tease Steve, Tony took some pieces of bread and meat instead of the fruits.
“The last time, I ate and it stayed inside was five days ago. I tried eating, I swear and then Natasha called and I didn’t want to risk anything.”
The four remaining men were just having lunch when Tony reached a video call from Rhodey. Tony answered it. “Hi Rhodeybear, what’s up? Your face seems cracked? Did you destroy my multi-million-dollar suit?”
“Yeah, Tony calls him like that… Why?” Pepper demanded a little suspicion in her voice, even if Steve didn’t believe it was against him. Pepper scared him a little. She sounded an awful lot like Natasha, that was scary enough.
“You can do that too, but first you get a blanket over your shoulders and another one over your legs and belly.” After a short pause he added. “This is not up for discussion.”
Tony was straight forward with everybody, so people hadn’t such a hard time to just spill into his face what they thought, if it was nice or not didn’t matter. Steve had been baffled by the way Tony had introduced himself on the helicarrier. Intentionally showing everybody the picture, they wanted to see. An ignorant, arrogant and sarcastic man, everybody disliked.
“You don’t wanna tell me since when you’re fucking Cap?” Bruce blurred out, while he was analyzing Barnes brain scans and Tony started to read everything he could find on brainwashing.
Natasha and Clint arrived in the middle of the night. When the elevator doors opened in front of them, one smiled softly and the other one’s jaw dropped.
Steve squatted down in front of the couch, touching Tony’s face only with one finger, caressing his cheek up to his hairline and back down to his lips. It must be the hundred time for the last week that Steve thought how handsome this man was.
“You’re literally the first person ever to gift me flowers. Thank you.” He looked a little sad, Steve thought, but there was something that made him believe that Tony loved the fact he brought him flowers.
“Man, if you get a haircut, the two of us are fine. You look ridiculous.” Clint answered and the Avengers all laughed out loud.
Steve stroked over Tony’s hair, the younger man was laying on his shoulder, with his feet on the couch and his knees close to his chest. Like a child. “What would your dad say?” Steve asked silently.
“Go right ahead, Cap. I’m ready.” Steve doubted that, and he was afraid because there certainly was a high risk of them getting into a fight. But he had to take it, if they wanted to get anywhere with this, better get it out of the way already.
Steve leaned down until their faces nearly met. “Stop being a sarcastic narcissist, Stark.” Tony smiled, and one of his hands found his way into Steve blond hair. “I’m real, Tony and I’m all in, I promised and I always keep my promises. You’re stuck with me.” He clarified his intentions again. He probably would have to do that a few times every day since he chose to love the must self-destructive person there was on this planet.
“So, you still want to know what I would like to do?” Steve nodded. “You know what I haven’t down in a very long time?” He sighed. “Just lying on the bed and watching a show, doing nothing but let the TV wash over me. What do you think?”
“How long do you have to stay?” Tony shrugged and started to leaf through the comics. Steve was concerned. He didn’t know the Stark boy, but something was definitely not right. Tony thought about his funeral, this could not be normal.
“And Tony is going to refuse, only for the sake of it, and then he will propose another month later.” Clint laughed.
“You’re not dead now, right? And there’s always a chance it’s something fixable.” He finally answered and decided to go even a little further. “And I refuse to believe that God would have given you your genius mind if you wouldn’t be able to put it to use.”
“You’re ready to make a bet, Wilson?” Natasha asked Sam from afar, while again watching the two men. She smiled, they wouldn’t be perfect for each other, but perfect didn’t exist. They would make it work, and make it perfect for just themselves. “A hundred bucks they hit off by the end of the week.”
“I panicked.” Steve admitted and sat down on the bed. “But when she kept on pestering you, I couldn’t keep quite anymore.” Tony turned around on the bed and snuggled against Steve’s tight. “What’s shaking you so up, Tony?”
“My heart is a bitch.” He put the flowers aside and looked at the comics. “Thanks for these, will make it less boring in here.”
“I do, but the last time I saw them, they were not that close, I actually thought they were not close at all. More like a cat and a dog.”
Nobody saw how much that little sentence touched Steve’s heart. His eyes were watery, and he realized the more time passed with Tony, the more he believed that here laid his happiness. In a life with Tony. He definitely felt butterflies flying around his stomach.
Tony frowned, then he laughed out loud for a few seconds before he suddenly stopped. “No, come on. He didn’t, he wouldn’t, with which purpose?”
There was his heart condition and Tony’s refuse to do something about it for months, nearly years. Maybe it really only had needed Steve to get his head right, but for the sake of his father it shouldn’t have taken him so long to take the decision for his life.
“I saw what your dad’s and mom’s deaths did for you and how you changed after my incident. I love you, Stevie. I don’t want you to be hurt, never again.”
After he had finished the dishes and cleaned the table, he looked around in the penthouse and asked himself what he should do now. He probably should just leave. Tony had just been nice, he didn’t really want him to stay.
“Okay, then tell me something you want to do, anything.” Tony opened his eyes and looked suspiciously into Steve’s direction. Slowly he sat up again.
“What do you mean by that?” Steve asked. Tony leaned back on his bed, watching Steve with a little smile. He was really an angel, his personal guardian angel that saved him from death.
Steve frowned. He wasn’t sure he got that information right, was Tony implying that he brought people in for sex? That would support the rumour of him being a playboy. But the Tony he met now, knowing him for only a day, well two if one would include their short interaction before he pretty much died in his arms, that Tony didn’t seem so playboy-like.
“The closet, Rogers? How clichéd…” Tony sighed and fell back on the bed and closed his eyes again. Steve had no idea why, but the man in front of him was clearly still shaken about Pepper. Even if they separated, Steve didn’t thing that was a normal reaction.
Steve thought he knew by now every emotion that could display in Tony’s face, but nothing came close to the face he made when he saw his father in the hospital bed, it wasn’t even something he could have imagined.
“I did. Because of you. He’s your friend and he saved you. So, there still is some of your Bucky in him, I couldn’t kill him. I wanted, desperately. Honestly, it would have been so easy, he didn't even try to escape, which made it only more difficult to pull the trigger. But mostly, it was you. I heard you take a breath and I let him go. You’re more important than revenge… For now, I’m happy to do that, but I need time to get over it. I hope you're not angry.”
“I think we need help.” Steve said. “HYDRA is still alive, and I just don’t believe Bucky was the only one being turned into a killer machine.”
Steve only rolled his eyes again and sat down on the couch too. “So, who should I call to come to look after you? Or do Pepper and Rhodey live here?”
“I do trust you, Steve. You were nothing but honest with me since we met and now you’re here and not…” He sighed. “I really hate him Steve. I’m trying not to, I can’t right now, but I’m happy you’re with me.”
Sleeping on the chair wasn’t a problem for Steve. It was way more uncomfortable than Bucky’s couch that much he had to admit, but he wasn’t complaining. If necessary, he could sleep while standing up and bombs flying over his head. Hearing Tony’s breath and the little sounds his heart monitor was making, was oddly calming and he fell fast asleep.
Natasha even believed Tony had greater chemistry with Rhodey. Hell, even any of the Avengers had greater chemistry with Tony and that included herself and Clint. At least, they didn’t try taking something away from the man.
“Obadiah is the only CEO. I’m still 20 and if my dad is not in the condition to act as CEO, his responsibilities go over to Obadiah. It’s logic, isn’t it?”
“Sunday, Tony is out of the hospital by then, right?” Clint asked him and Steve nodded. “It’s our last game of the season. Tony usually doesn’t miss a single game, except for when he’s in life treating condition or kidnapped… he missed a few this year, so you should show up with him.”
“Yes. I start to like it, especially since I found that pretty handsome guy with his big heart and his genius mind.”
“I can stay.” Steve told him. “I’m pretty sure that seat his more comfortable than Bucky’s couch.” That eased the atmosphere at least a little bit. And Tony’s best friends seemed to need a little time off to recollect their emotions.
He locked eyes with Steve. “I won’t kill him, promise, with one single if. So, if I believe your life is in danger, because of him and you’re not fighting against him – which of course, you wouldn’t – I will do it, Steve. Within a second. I let him run once, for you but I will also kill him for of you, even if that thing between us will be ending then.”
Tony hugged him. No words needed, at least not for this, greeting his friend, because that’s what Bruce was, a great friend. They kept in contact, hell, Bruce was the only one that accepted his offer to live in the Tower. He was still traveling through the world, sometimes he still felt like a fugitive.
Iron Man had spared Bucky. Steve wasn’t even sure his best friend deserved it. He loved him like a brother and he didn’t want him to die, especially not killed by Tony. But the son of Howard had seen his fair share of shit in his life. It sounded wrong, but he might deserve his revenge.
“No.” The smaller man said himself. “Sam is right, we cannot bring him away. This is the safest place, for him, for us and the world… For now. I have a Hulk proved floor. We bring him there and JARVIS can take of the shackles.”
I don't know exactly why but this Chapter might be my favorite, it's not because there's a whole lot of plot in there but only because of the fact that I like the way I ended the story. It think it fits, because that story wasn't about any overly dramatic story, or major plot-twist but mostly just about two guys learning about themself and their partner and that together, they can archive more. I just like this basic thing a lot.
A knock on the door of Sam’s apartment interrupted Steve mid-sentence. “Did you guys invite another person to the party?” The veteran asked suspiciously. Since Steve and his girlfriend – ‘She is not my girlfriend’ – appeared at his door, Sam Wilson was a little more cautious, it’s not everyday Captain America asks for your help.
The woman turned around to face him. “I’m not calling you Mr. Rogers or Captain Rogers. I’m still Pepper.”
That’s also what Bruce had thought, when in Cap’s second day off he had walked into the kitchen of Tony’s penthouse and had found Steve laying on the couch, pale and kind of smaller than before while Tony had been trying to serve a decent breakfast.
But the worst would have been, that he was Bucky’s person. He wished for Steve to escort him home if he ever died on the battlefield. Steve wouldn’t have denied him this honor, while it would have killed him inside to do so, standing there next to his coffin and being the one to present the flag to his mother.
Steve desperately wanted to touch Tony, hold his hand, wipe away the sweat on his forehead, brush through his hair, that he knew must been softer than a dog’s fur. But he didn’t. Tony was unconscious and they were not close enough for Steve to just do it without Tony’s clear consent on any physical touch.
Steve was the first to fall asleep when they just started the third movie, while Tony refused stubbornly to even think about falling asleep since he was enjoying the closeness between them way too much to give it up for a little sleep.
“Don’t take him seriously, he’s only joking. I hope you’re doing good Steve?” Howard answered, while Steve nodded as an answer, he felt that it was not at all joking. The man made all of his alarms go off in his head. He must keep his distance because something was clearly not right with that guy.
Pepper gasped. “Eeeh.” Tony smiled a little into Steve’s direction, that was clearly the first time the billionaire saw Pepper without words. “Since when?” Was the only thing that came out of her mouth, after she had calmed down a little, well enough to find her voice that was trembling.
He knocked on Tony’s bedroom door, and unsparingly, he didn’t get an answer. When he didn’t get a response on the second knock, he opened the door but stayed outside. Tony laid on his bed with his back in his direction, he was typing away on his phone, working again if Steve’s eyes were to believe.
“Why is you saying that only more pressuring?” Steve murmured. “You want me to start?” He wondered when Tony turned the board around, white now in front of him.
Tony was definitely up for it. He leaned into the kiss and grabbed Steve by his shirt to pull him down. He tasted sweet, Steve wondered about that. His lips were rough, different to girl’s lips. He liked it though, feeling his beard on his face, just tasting pure Tony. He could get used to that.
Steve hadn’t understood the reasoning for that, mostly because he was to distracted by just looking at Tony. Him talking with closed eyes, under that blanket Pepper had put over him hours ago, was oddly feeling like home. He was so calm and cute, just utterly beautiful. The other reason was that Steve had no knowledge of technical information about cars.
“I will take down HYDRA. And if the person that decided over your parent’s death is still alive, I find him personally and he will find out what it means to mess with my friend’s parents. And you’re right, I will try to save Bucky, I can only try but Tony… I will never choose him over you, okay? You will always be my friend and if you need me and if it just talking. I will be there, only a call away. Nothing will change.”
“Oh, still joking, yeah?!” Rhodey blew up his cheeks and tried really hard to calm down. “It was also Pepper that told me why you were on shutdown for two days and didn’t bother to answer anyone’s calls after. His friend killed your parents, and you thought, I wouldn’t want to know that?”
Steve grinned into Tony’s neck and kissed it after. “You can have him in your dreams but on the day, your all mine.”
Steve shrugged. “To be honest, on one side, it changes nothing; I still want to get to know you, be your friend, and on the other side it changes everything because I already can’t imagine a world without you. And yeah, I’ve known you for two days, but I know you through Bucky, a little with Nat and Sam. Every one of them likes you, and you’re so nothing like the way the medias pictures you.” He paused and took a deep breath. “You deserve better, Tony.” He used the Bucky’s words.
While in the mean-time, he only fooled them, keeping their eyes away from what he was doing, getting JARVIS into SHIELD systems. He had heard, Tony proposing Coulson his private jet to see his girlfriend and he had seen his watery eyes when Fury told them about his death. That was the first moment Steve had realized that there was so much more about Tony than his façade. That he was not his father.
But the genius didn’t even answer when he came back, he stayed completely silent until they shared their way into the second floor and parted ways in front of Steve’s new room. “No, it doesn’t.” Tony said without turning around. “Goodnight Steve.”
Tony raised an eyebrow at him while he put his arms through the sleeves. “JARVIS told me you have not eaten since coming back, you did not eat while we were together and I’m sure nothing found the way into your stomach in the time between, am I right?”
A little smile appeared on Tony’s face. His eyes were closed, they were clearly hurting him and they would even more in the morning but Steve would take care of him. “I know you always find a solution Tony, that’s what you do… But this time you’re not alone. I’m here and all the Avengers. Maybe Thor will show up, he’s pretty good when it comes to cheering people up.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Man, I can’t believe I will lose my bet because I’m one of the good guys. You’re an idiot, Cap. Tony found you, and he fucking kneeled next to you and held your hand until the ambulance showed up. They nearly had to drag him away.”
“God, Tony! You’re the math genius, right? That doesn’t mean that you’re only dying in two years. It just means that at least by then you’re dead, which is even pretty pinned-up, and if you would stop being a bullhead, you would see that too. The doc wants you in a good condition for the operation, that’s now.”
Okay, Steve was stubborn too, but not with Tony, at least he thought so. He really always made compromises with him, to keep him happy and let him feel safe, but he couldn’t back down this time, could he? It was a life-depending decision after all, and if Tony couldn’t see it, he could.
It took him about five minutes of running, racing actually, to find Steve. And the Winter Soldier. Tony stopped in his track. The man dragged Cap out of the water, he hadn’t seen him yet. He could just shoot him. He could kill the man that murdered his parents. It only took one shot through his head. He wouldn’t survive that, and Tony knew how to aim. He would not miss. He wouldn’t even hear the shot that kills him. It would be a painless death, more than he deserved.
“I know. I’m so sorry.” Steve kissed his head and laid him on his shoulder. “I will find a new place for him, first thing tomorrow. Well today…”
Pepper gasped at him. “I hate him. I do… But no, I mean… No. He’s known Tony since he was born, he wouldn’t.”
“I just talked to Dr. Yinsen, because…” She shuttered a little. “Y-you didn’t look so well, so I thought, I would have a look. He says everything is fine for now.”
“Yeah. I think, it was more about last time… Although it’s still weird that she fled. It’s not really her style. Maybe she wanted to give us some privacy. Then again I just told her about Bucky and what happened.” Tony frowned and shrugged then. “She probably just felt uncomfortable, in the end she’s still my ex.”
“I thought about that, and honestly Tony, I don’t know. I want a future with you. I really do, more than anything… But Bucky is my best friend, you know, he was by my side when I was a little shit and after my mom died, in the war… Always. I don’t want to choose. But there is one thing I can promise you, and it kills me to say, but if ever, there is a fight and Bucky is not in his right mind and he attacks you… I won’t hesitate a second to stop him and kill him if necessary.”
“You’re not dumb.” He simply answered, only loud enough to reach Steve as a whisper. “Anything but.”
Tony bit his lip. “Well yes, but no… I let it rest, I drank it cold that was alright, not always but yes…” Steve opened the door and went back into the kitchen.
He smiled down on Tony’s face, caressing the back of his hand. “Don’t ever say such a shit again, okay? I decide who I wanna date, and frankly, I met your friends-group and they love you, you can’t be so bad than, right? And I’ve got a good instinct, you are a great man, Tony. That means, if you give me a chance, I’m going to give you the world, not because I wanna buy you in any way or because I wanna prove myself, but because I believe earnest to my heart that you deserve nothing less than the world.”
And after that the Avengers all said their goodbyes until there was only Tony and Steve left. “I’ve got you a credit card if ever you need anything, a phone, pretty simple to use, if you need help JARVIS is in there just say his name and you can ask him any questions you want.” Tony started talking to restrain himself from chicken out. “My offer still stands, you can come back any day and a floor will be ready for you…” Tony swallowed. “But I’ve got one condition.”
He didn’t need a shovel talk. He would do alright. They would do alright. Tony was sure that Steve and him where made for each other. They would always find a way because now they had each other. And if there was something coming for them, they would be ready to face it, together.
“So, any news for now?” Pepper asked, purposely to not let anybody have the chance to comment further on Steve’s outburst.
“JARVIS, what do you think that stubborn bastard likes to eat?” Cap might be a little angry, but he was not at Tony or god forbid at JARVIS. He was angry at himself. He let Tony go, alone after he found out of his parents dramatic ending. He had a mission, but he should have called as soon as possible.
The soldier smiled fondly. Tony was relaxed, his hand black as was his forehead and there was also a little grease on his cheek. What a cute human being. And even if he was probably ready to eat Steve up, the anger didn’t seem that convincing. It was only his self-defense showing up.
“I’m good, let her in.” He cuddled a little deeper into his blanket. Partly, because he really still felt cold but maybe subconsciously he was also trying to protect himself. The doors slid open and Pepper Potts walked out of the elevator.
“Fuck, fuck!” He murmured. Steve was now close enough to hear him. “Not now, not hear.” The man said again.
Tony laughed. Loudly and without holding back in the slightest. Bruce would probably be the one that wouldn’t say anything to his relationship with Cap, but in that moment, he realized they would have to tell Clint, because Natasha wouldn’t dare to do so. God, he needed to put all the cameras on Clint’s face.
Tony shrugged. “Got me a project for my PhD and an idea to where I want to go with SI when I take over.”
Tony’s sleep schedule was extremely odd. Yes, he had been tired like hell, more exhausted than anything else and he still was, no doubt there. But yet, in the last fifteen minutes he had been staring at the ceiling. It felt like hours to him, but the time just didn’t want to pass.
He walked up to him and crouched down in front of the man. “Hi, Tony. You’re there?” The man looked up. His eyes small, red and swollen. If Steve wouldn’t remember Tony’s eye color, he wouldn’t make it out right now.
“Nothing new, I hope our two spies are going to find something if not, we might have to ask other specialists for help, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists… It’s not really my domain.”
“I was kidnapped, a year ago.” Tony whispered into the room. “I mean, I was before… in the US and every time, I was able to escape myself.”
“God, Tony, I was so worried.” A tear suddenly dropped out of her eye. “I couldn’t live without you. I never told you directly, and I’m sorry I didn’t. You mean the world to me, I-we love you, and I hate so see you hurt.”
“Would you like to go out with me?” Steve couldn’t stop himself asking when Tony had finished his conclusion. In his mind, Steve had just given himself a slap across the face. This was the worst moment he could have come up with that.
And then Rogers felt. Tony froze and for a couple of seconds he just could not bring himself to move. Time seemed to have stopped around him. He could hear his heart splitter. The coms were silent. Was it over? Had the Winter Soldier just killed Captain America?
He knew that it was completely irrational to be afraid of the operation. Dr. Yinsen was the best cardiologist one could have, and Tony trusted him, usually. But giving his life into the hands of someone else wasn’t something he liked since Afghanistan.
They had been talking for hours, dealing with a lot of serious stuff that had happened, Steve’s parents, Jarvis and Ana. But also, about funny things, how Tony shut off all of Howard’s computers at Christmas and how Rhodey walked in on him having sex with a man for the first time.
Tony turned to face Steve in his seat. “I am worth more than that, they all realized that pretty fast.”
On his next visit, he and Nat were already dating, and he saw how Bucky finally found his smile back. Not all the time, but he was still there. He would never be the same, but maybe he could go back to enjoying and really living his life.
Tony sighed. “I did, Cap. I wanted to help SHIELD, if I had any knowledge of this, I would not have done it, okay? Let me help, I won’t beg you.”
“Will you ever drop that?” She asked and sounded herself already annoyed by the presence of the billionaire.
“But when he turns twenty-one, he will not only automatically be CEO but also head of R&D.” She continued. “They have a contract, I don’t know exactly how, but Obadiah is going to lose his CEO status and is only going to be a member of the board, although I think he’s holding about 20% of shares alone. Tony has proclaimed in a few important occasions that he’s not going to keep on doing weapons factory forever. He has great plans and Howard supports him, Obadiah, not so much.”
“You refused a pacemaker?!” Steve was shocked, that thing could prevent a lot of harm and Tony refused it. Was that guy really a genius, cause for Steve it seemed as if he was just a total dumbass.
Tony’s face on the other hand turned into his cold mask he wore whenever he needed to hide away, it had been a while since Steve saw this kind of mask on him. “Not sure, right now.”
“You, boy!” Stane shot at Tony, only taking his eyes of Steve for a few seconds. “You stop giving instructions to my engineers!”
“We did not fight. And it’s not Cap in the room.” Tony scratched his head and started walking again. “The problem, you and I need to solve, is the person in the room.” Bruce waited patiently for Tony to continue, but he was still wondering. “It’s Bucky Barnes, ever heard of him?”
Tony didn’t answer. He got up and walked away. “Come on Tony. You can’t fly every time I say something you don’t wanna hear.”
“You can stay here, if you want.” Tony proposed than out of nowhere, probably to get them to talk about other things. “I mean, I’ve got spare rooms, with actual beds… it’s more comfortable than any couch could be. Stark promise, and for free of course, Bucky will be here a lot of time and well, you can do whatever you want, of course but at least you would have a bed to sleep in…” He rambled.
Tony shot him a confused look. “You know, people I picked up at bars, parties… Hook-ups Steve, casual sex. Ever heard of that?” The smaller man looked at him as if he was asking if Steve even knew what sex was.
“Wow, Stark. I hope you’re not just replacing me with just the next soldier that hits on you.” Bucky greeted the genius.
Pepper looked around, shook her head a few times. “He just turned nineteen at that time, still a kid of course, but… It’s Tony, you know? He had been kidnapped before and after he laughed about the stupidity of the kidnappers, every single time. This is the Tony, I knew. But that one was different.”
Steve put the coffee in front of him and suddenly he creased his face. “What’s wrong?” Steve asked directly, wondering if Tony was having a health problem.
“You did, I mean we tried but you put that nuke in the hole, and without that we would all have died and Loki and his army would have taken over the world.”
“No. Never. First of all, Bucky is straight as an axe, secondly, I only fully realized that I liked man in the 21st century and third of all, just no, Tony. That’s nothing you need to think about, cause I’m just not at all attracted to him, never was, okay?” Tony nodded as an answer.
“But I can finish my breakfast, right? Those pancakes are pretty good.” Sam answered while still chewing on his fifth. “You really are full of surprises.”
“No return or exchange possible.” He answered when Steve laid him on the bed. He grinned brightly, taking of Tony’s pants. Good for him that he didn’t want an exchange. The last week with Tony was great, and he learned more about the man than he knew ever before and he loved every piece of that information. He would never regret the decision to try his chance with Tony.
“I like the others, and I try to trust them… But as much as I try every day, I know and they do, that I don’t. But with you.” He shrugged, grinned for a second up to Steve. “Everything feels right, I feel safe and l-liked, and I dunno where all those feelings come from, but I just decided to go with it… but I’m fucking scared, okay? I’ve had my heart broken before, and I can’t go through this again… Not with you, at least.”
He sometimes shared a lab with Tony, usually they weren’t at all together, but Bruce was kind enough to let Tony in when he had fucked up yet again with his usual lab companions. That’s what Bruce said at least. Steve believed him and decided he would get more out of Bruce in the next weeks.
“And you are, you’re doing everything you can, but you have to look after yourself. And if you can’t, I will.”
“You’re lucky that I’m on good terms with Obama, lucky me he’s democratic.” Tony grinned a moment. “Republicans hate me because I stopped the weapon factory.”
“We’re heading back Tony, get your lawyers together. We have a book, and we have another six people in cryo-sleep, this is huge. It’s even bigger than the Avengers. We need help.”
Steve smiled proudly. Last time, he was a little ashamed of the flowers but Tony had loved them. They were still on the couch table at his place, totally dead, but Tony refused to throw them away. Steve had just now decided to replace them with something better. He would bring Tony new flowers every day if only to see a tiny smile on his lips.
“As of my information, you’re right about Miss Romanoff whereabouts. Yesterday, her position was in Brussels.”
“Okay…” Steve answered bewildered. He wondered if he had done something wrong, or why else was Tony so angry? Or was he just stressed?
Bucky grinned wide at him, before his eyes dropped to the yellow roses that Steve had put in a glass of water. “I thought we talked about not bringing flowers to a guy.” Steve’s cheeks flushed within seconds.
“I’m afraid they both are, and Tony is just slowly getting that Stane is dangerous. Yinsen wants to operate him next week. Tony refuses because he’s afraid the company passes to Stane, if they both die.”
“You put little marshmallows in it.” Tony squeaked. “That’s so sweet! God, I love that. Where did you find them?” And he certainly did. He drank it slowly, with his sparkling eyes and once again Steve had the feeling of getting to see more and more of real Tony. A grown-up that missed out too much of his childhood and a man whose heart was too big for the world they lived in.
“I don’t want you to go into a panic attack, Sir but my screening indicates the man in Mr. Wilson’s company is no other than Sargent James Barnes.” Tony’s heart sunk and he swallowed. “He is wearing handcuffs. I’m not certain, he’s with Mr. Wilson out of free will.” JARVIS clarified.
He hacked himself into the coms of the team and listened from a little distance. He still had no suit. Not in Washington or one that wouldn’t take to long to come to him. He destroyed all of them, the new ones where not really operable right now.
“He killed her. He killed my mom.” Was the first sentence that came out of his mouth. He sounded hoarse, probably like the boy he once was, the young guy who was told that both his parents died in a car crash. Like a child that lost his mom.
“Actually.” Steve scratched his head. “You go first, I’m happy he’s alright, I just need some fresh air. Alone.” The last word was declared into the direction of his best friend. “I come back later, you guys certainly have to go to your classes, right?” He asked Clint and Natasha.
Steve sat up on his bed. Rhodes asked for his help? For what exactly? “Yeah, if you want my help, I need more information on what I have to do?”
“Yep, Daddy’s home.” He patted their heads, and was laughing as if nothing in the world could bother him. Steve was completely falling in love with Tony, and nothing would make him regret it. “Meet my new friend, Steve. You gotta be kind to him, he’s a captain in the army and he saved my life.”
“Alright, alright.” Steve gave in. “I will try my best to get Tony to the game. I need good seats, and Clint I hope you are actually as good as everybody claims you to be, so my first date isn’t going to be shit because you lose.”
“You should call him, you know?” Natasha told him at Fury’s gravestone, when she gave him everything she knew about the Winter Soldier.
“Actually, a guy named the Winter Soldier killed Fury, but it probably was Pierce to make the call.” Natasha corrected.
“What, Steve? You delegated all of the work and honestly, this right now is just not our thing. Sam is the veteran that can talk with people having PTSD, he’s neutral. Nat and Clint are spies, if there’s anything to find out, they will and Bruce? Well, he’s a better option than I am, although he asked me to get into contact with Wakanda because they might have better technology.”
Only a sweet ‘Steve’ came over Tony’s lips when he saw what the soldier had prepared. “I assume you like it then?” Steve asked shyly, scratching his head to do something with his sweaty hands.
“Yeah, if not I would have already died out of pure boredom.” Tony answered, and picking on his salad. With a disgust look at it, he put it away.
“Call an ambulance!” He screamed at them and turned his attention back to the man. He looked an awful lot like Tony Stark. No wonder he fell in love with that guy after he saw his face for five seconds, not that he ever saw Stark in reality, but Bucky showed him a picture. He was probably a fan or something. He ripped open the boy’s shirt.
“I just wanted to say hello.” Steve said calmly although he was sure, they could hear that his voice was tense. “I’m going to shower…” He left the room without a further comment of a certain ‘Obie’. He wasn’t comfortable leaving him with Tony in a room but Jarvis and Howard were still there, and they seemed to be way more decent.
So, Tony missed Clint’s face, when he found out. There was video proof, but he realized the next morning that it was just not the same. He needed to find another way to tease the archer.
On Saturday, Tony and Steve were hanging around on the couch watching TV. While Tony seemed to keep up with the context of the show, Steve was drawing on a sketch block that he had stolen from Tony yesterday.
Bruce threw his tablet against the wall, and it splattered into smaller and bigger pieces. “Don’t forget the Hulk room is occupied.” Tony whispered. “And I put that on your bill.” Bruce turned around, shooting one glance at the Tony. Hulk’s neon green eyes, watching him with hunger. Tony swallowed, yes, he would absolutely shut his mouth.
Steve frowned and through his body went a shudder. Something was so damn off with that story, but he couldn’t put a name on it, not yet.
“Ah. He gave you the talk. Alright, he told you, you’re making yourself miserable by being friends with me.”
“Fine, but while I speak, you will eat.” Tony rolled his eyes but followed Steve’s rule. The blond man watched Tony for a moment before he decided how to start. “Sam told you, that you were by my side until the medics arrived and you told Natasha that my friend saved me, which makes me believe it was Bucky and you saw him.”
“Well, I thought you liked it yesterday.” Steve answered cheekily. Tony bit his lips, while watching all of Steve’s movements.
“I’m really sorry.” Bucky said again and Tony wished it would change anything, inside his head he was yelling at himself that he should grow up and accept it, but right here his heart was still bleeding. This man choked his mom to death. A dry sob left his throat, when he pushed the button of the elevator.
He had disliked the uniform, as did Steve from time to time. That was their connection, they both disliked Captain America, in different ways and forms but they both seemed to like Steve Rogers.
“I asked too. I would probably do the same if I was in the army. I like girls too, so that would be easier for me, but giving your answer I think that’s not the case for you.”
“I’m not sure if that’s a healthy or unhealthy relationship you have with your best friend.” Sam commented.
He tried to calm his breath down, but the harm was already down. He felt sweat on his forehead and how his hands slightly started to shiver. It was a little dark in her, wasn’t it? And then, there was already a nurse walking into the room.
“So, Captain America, any preferences in shows? What haven’t you seen yet?” Tony asked while swiping through his phone. “Mh, The Blacklist, always wanted to see, but way too much blood and violence for our innocent souls…” He swiped further. “The Big Bang Theory? Nah, to nerdy, you suffer enough with me.”
“For now, the doctors are not certain if your father is going to survive, I think it would be convenient for you to come here.”
The smile disappeared from Steve’s face. And in the very same moment, Tony wanted to slap himself across the face. The war wasn’t even over for a year in Steve’s brain. “There were a lot.” Steve whispered.
Steve took a last deep breath and knocked on the door. “Come in.” He heard Tony’s voice. He straightened his posture and walked right in.
“Did… Did he ever abuse you?” There was a little pause in Tony’s regular breathing and Steve felt how his heart started to pick up speed.
“Welcome home Captain Rogers.” JARVIS greeted him. “I’m delighted to see you alive and in good shape.”
“I do like a lot of things, Cap…” Tony whispered with a deep voice Steve had never heard before. He totally reserved that kind of ton for the people he brought to bed with him… Steve was now one of them, he realized. Hopefully, he would also be the last. “You know what, there is this new sitcom called ‘New girl’, totally not my kind of show but I didn’t want to think, so that’s it.”
The billionaire grinned back at him. “You told me a couple of hours ago, that my brain was not working, so… please, dear Steve, explain.”
On the same evening, he found himself in Buckys apartment. Together with Natasha and Sam. The latter had told them about the incident on the campus. “Wow, Stevie. You really can’t have a normal day.” Bucky laughed and gave him a beer.
Tony was another story. He didn’t even acknowledge Steve when they met, not giving him those ‘thankful for what you did’ talks. He probably disliked Steve because he reminded him of his father.
“Deserved.” Bucky murmured, and even though Steve wanted to say that those were still human beings, even he had difficulties to grant terrorists, and especially terrorists that torture a nineteen-year-old kid, any grace.
Tony had realized it when he found his man on the couch after his rather successful talk with the President. He had seen it in those clear blue eyes; deep down there was this sadness, shakiness, the anger, all those emotions that Tony carried himself. Only with Steve it went even deeper. And that’s when he took over the leading role, and what shocked everybody the most, Steve didn’t even complain.
“As you wish, Sir.” JARVIS answered. Out of the wall, well a hole opened in the wall, but for Steve it was still coming out of nowhere, something flew into their direction. Seconds later, Bucky had shackles around his ankles and wrists. They were thick and Steve could see, there wouldn’t be a way to escape them. Even with Bucky’s metal arm.
In the meantime, he had already met Tony, only then nobody had told Steve about the chance of a prosthetic arm, probably because if they had told him about it, he wouldn’t have gone to the next mission.
The confusion only grew bigger in Sam’s face. “What the fuck is wrong with you? You wanted me to bring him to the military, the police, or what? Maybe the FBI or CIA? I thought you wanted him back and not dead?”
“Nervous, anxious…” Tony sighed, nodding once to himself. “I will allow it, the operation. I’ve no choice at the end.”
Tony shrugged. “I’m worth some billions. Genius kid whose dad owns the biggest and best weapon company in the US, I’m the only heir there is. I’s common knowledge that I build a lot of that stuff. It happened once when I was a little kid, my mom was still alive then. Dad worried back then. After her death, it happened another three times, at ten, twelve and fourteen years old. He panicked much more then. Nobody there to calm him, comfort him. He paid every time, but none of them ever set me free after.” A cocky smile appeared in his face. “But I was too clever, I escaped myself.”
Steve shot him a glance. “Yeah, maybe they are.” He reasoned. “But the rest of them, except Thor, is usually considered as normal human beings and it works the same with them.”
Only late at night, when he laid awake in bed, Steve realized that in fact, he probably could manage being openly gay in the army if he knew Tony was waiting for him at home.
“Well, something is wrong with your statement, since I’m pretty sure the hottest guy you ever met must greet you every morning in front of the mirror, at least you are by far the hottest I ever met.”
“God, Steve, please.” Tony came back laughing, when he found Steve cleaning the shit they left around. “Leave it. Tomorrow, someone comes to clean.”
“Steve, if you want to be with me you need to learn how to read signs. I’m not good at conversations or feelings, you should know. I’m better at showing, at telling people things between lines.” Tony answered within a second.
“Fine, for now.” He gave in and leaned over to switch on the first movie and took another blanket from the side. “Even if this winter hasn’t come yet, it’s still November, so put this over your shoulders.”
This is a pretty long fill-in chapter, there's not a lot of plot happening here. It's pretty much only there to built up the stories of the characters and really getting into the main subjects of the story.
That gave him a little smile from the blond man. “I know how to play, but I sure as hell will be lost against you.”
And before that talk, Tony had had already silently decided he could go through anything but the last bit. He would do whatever his dad, Yinsen or his friends wanted, except getting a transplant. There was no real reason behind it. The donor was dead if Tony got a transplant or not, but his mind was screaming at him to no accept that point.
“That wasn’t the usual procedure.” Bucky mumbled but his face definitely changed the color dramatically fast, and he couldn’t even look into Steve’s eyes, which happened only rarely.
Tony scoffed and crossed his arms. “You’re a cold-hearted man, Doc.” The doctor glanced around the room, looking at the six people sitting around. Tony locked eyes with Pepper and decided it might be easier to let the doctor update them. “You can talk free around them, Doc.”
He stood by what he said, even if Tony would die soon, he rather has some time with him than none. But now there was this ugly picture circling in his head. Tony in a coffin, his dad in front, crying like a baby. His friends around trying to withhold their tears because Tony would laugh at them, but they wouldn’t be able to keep it together. Next to the coffin his picture, in Steve’s mind it was him with a big smile and that old Stark Industries hoodie he had on when Steve picked him up from the hospital.
Steve gave him another kiss on his head. “You too. I’m expecting you on the airport when I return, alright? With flowers and a big sign.” He felt a tear drop on his shoulder. He pulled Tony closer and restrained himself from crying too, it wouldn’t help neither of them.
“I was held in a cave… Just a couple of weeks before I had found out about my heart condition and that was probably why my Dad wanted me to come along, so he could keep an eye on me. He’s still blaming himself. But what was funny or rather weird, they didn’t want anything from me… No money, no weapons. It seems as if I was just there for their pleasuring.” He sighed and took a deep breath. “I really thought my Dad was death and that Obie took over the company and he believed I was dead too. Days past, weeks did. I tried to think about a way to come out. I had three plans, all failed… they still didn’t kill me. I knew they would, eventually but they seemed to be waiting for something.”
“You can, you just don’t want to.” He gave Steve an up and down look. “Take it as a thank you for saving me, okay?”
When Steve looked up from the papers right into his face with that lost expression on, but still that sweet smile, those eyes… Tony felt how his heart wanted to skip some beats but the pacer prevented it, he was falling deeply in love with Steve and the soldier didn’t even know that Tony’s heart already belonged to him.
Rhodey’s friendly face changed in a matter of seconds. “I swear Pep, when that man walks out of the room, I’ll crush his skull.” He walked up and down between Pepper and Steve. “I can’t…” He started again but didn’t finish his sentence.
“No psychoanalysis, Wilson.” Tony glared at him for a moment. “Rhodey saved my life quite a few times, and he’s my brother. He’s my family and we have a very healthy relationship. But he also cares for Pepper, a lot and if she’s hurt because of me, he calls me out for it, as he should. They’re the only family I have.”
Sam didn’t get an answer. Steve wanted to turn around, see if Tony wasn’t having a major panic attack but at the same time he couldn’t take his eyes from Bucky. There were two reasons for that.
People used to respect him, they looked up to him. They felt grateful even if he just spoke a few words with them. Now, though, he seemed to be an old and tired man. He walked slower, head down and not up in the air like back in the days. He was thinner too and Tony wondered if he was drinking again.
Around midday, after having a long breakfast thanks to Steve, they found themselves in Tony’s bed. The smaller man snuggled into Steve’s chest the second he had laid down. Immediately, Steve put an arm around the man to hold him close.
Tony smiled, and he just couldn’t bring himself to stop. He wasn’t making fun of Steve, but it was a comfy picture seeing Steve on his couch, desperately trying to understand his work. Not because he really wanted to correct Tony, or feel superior as most people did with him. And failed. No, Steve genuinely wanted to help him and understand Tony’s work only for the sake of it, not to use it.
For a moment, Steve saw how the doctor wanted to push Tony to stay, reason with him. But then he just nodded. “I’ll bring you some papers. You need to take some pills, though. A nurse is going to free you from the bags and the dots on your body.” He sighed and took a really deep breath. “Please be careful boy, I want you to live, okay?”
“I’m better when I’m with you, Steve.” Tony whispered. Instead of answering, Steve decided it was time for their first kiss. He had absolutely no idea why they hadn’t done that yet, but he was happy to make up for lost time. He leaned down and secured his intention with a last look into Tony’s eyes.
“You’re my boyfriend and, I want and need to support you, he is your best friend, that makes him part of your family, so also a part of mine. I don’t like him, not yet. But you never like all of your family.” He took a deep breath.
“What are you planning to do, Tony?” Steve asked concerned and grabbed his boyfriend’s arm. Since Tony invited Sam and Bucky into his penthouse, he got paler with every second. He ran around the kitchen, nervously looking for something that was clearly not there. “Honey, please… Wait a second and take a deep breath, then tell me what the hell you want to do.”
For a moment Steve believed he was back in the ice. He was shocked about it. But, yes, he understood. If there was somebody around that killed his mom, the person would be death in a matter of seconds. But one thing he knew for sure, Tony was not a person to commit a cold blood murder. He was not weak, but to good.
Bucky shook his head, taking the last bite of his toast with peanut butter. “No, I like it, but what you’re bringing?”
“Plus, even if your Captain America, I saw and heard how you forget everything when it comes to Barnes. That’s why I decided, that I’m not going to lose you, because you decided to let him kill you, okay? You want to protect me? That’s good fine by me but I will protect you too.”
“Love you too, Pep.” He answered, just before she was out of the room. She smiled softly, she had known that before. Tony told them frequently that he loved them, but usually they smiled or gave him a kiss. They all were better with signs than with actual talking. Tony knew that. He liked physical contact, he needed it, more than his friends did.
Steve stared at her for a moment. “People are making bets on his death?” He asked disgusted by the society in general.
And just when Steve wanted to reassure her that both her friends would be fine, he saw how the doors opened where he last saw Tony disappear in. They all jumped up when Dr. Yinsen walked up to them.
“I have an idea.” Steve smiled, now laying his hand on Tony’s cheek. “I saw it and last time I nearly believed you were dead, I am sure if I hadn’t come, you would have since you blocked everyone out.”
Tony sighed and a little smile appeared on his face, maybe they could leave all this behind them soon enough. “Come back as fast as possible, before we act, we watch over everything you’ve got and if necessary I can get in contact with any person needed.”
“Are you done?” Tony asked, getting more and more pissed off. “Your job is to keep all that away from me, alright? And if you can’t do that, hire people who can. And now please, go! I’ve more important things to do.”
He would not be living with another person’s heart. And he definitely wouldn’t be sitting around for weeks, possibly months to wait for someone to have a terrible accident or something just so he could live on.
“Come again?” Bucky asked, while grabbing his shoulder with force and dragging him so they had to look each other in the eye. “You’re moving in with Tony? That small Stark boy, the little genius, who pretty much died two days ago?”
“Of course, you wouldn’t forget that part.” Steve rolled his eyes and walked into the kitchen. “Are you actually into these kinds of things?” He called after Tony. He wouldn’t be surprised, though; the man surely had his fair share of experience.
“You want to go to therapy?” Steve whispered. His voice had been soared since last week. He hadn’t cried or screamed but it just seemed as even his body couldn’t keep the stress out of the system and it showed off with common cold symptoms, which Tony honestly found a little cute and adorable but he would never tell Steve that only felt miserable and weak.
“You didn’t like what you saw, right?” Tony starred down at his hands and shook his head a couple of times.
Falling asleep near Steve, with Sam and Bruce talking about physics had been easy. He liked the sounds, anything to not let his thoughts be the loudest in his head. And now, Steve’s presence seemed to calm him down in a way, he hadn’t been since the Chitauri attack maybe even since he got kidnapped. But even the hot blond guy next to him, couldn’t calm him enough to fall asleep again.
“He phoned with him, yesterday, before… I mean I didn’t eavesdrop Tony, but I happened to walk behind him, while they talked, and I saw that Tony was in distress… Yeah, well and after that his heart stopped…”
Sam and Natasha were watching the two men from the car. “You know, if Steve would not come out of the forties, I would actually believe there was some sexual tension between them.”
“Yeah, but with you guys, it’s the same for her. We didn’t break up, it’s just a break, again…” He looked out of the window. “I believe at least.”
Steve stared back at the elevator. “Wait. Did Pepper Potts, the Pepper Potts really just run away from me?” He laughed a little.
“Stane is going to hang you.” Pepper told him. She was sitting next to Steve’s other side. She didn’t bring up that argument for the first time in front of Tony, but the genius seemed to be rather oblivious when it came to his father’s business partner, even though they never shared a view in anything related to the company.
Tony would fight for two simple reasons. He couldn’t leave his dad alone and Steve showing up on one of the most difficult times of his life, that meant something, didn’t it? He needed to explore this connection further before deciding how much it really meant.
“Drink. It’s a smoothie, mostly strawberries and bananas, the Internet said it would be alright. JARVIS called your doctor, he will come over tomorrow to get you a treatment.”
Tony sighed, avoiding to look at the guys at the table, that didn’t know what to do with themselves. “You couldn’t do anything about it, and I thought it could wait until you were back from Afghanistan.”
“Shut up Clint. Go to your training. You better be there on time or else the coach will replace you with Rumlow.”
Steve nodded once. “I’m sure Natasha and Clint will find something and, in the meantime, Sam can try to get everything out of Bucky he can possibly remember.”
Steve sighed and made the last painful point to Tony. “And what do you do, if he doesn’t wake up? There is a big chance he’s staying like this forever.” He took a deep breath. “I hate to be the one to shout it in your face, but Tony if you wanna save yourself and the company you know the right way to do so. He might die, Tony and you cannot change his state, but you can change yours.”
Steve shook his head. “You really never listen to me. It was not that kind of monologue. As I said, I wanted to thank you… Anyways, first you have to get back on track.”
“Give me some time… I usually don’t let people so fast into my heart.” Tony joked around, but nobody laughed with him. He wasn’t surprised, nobody ever did, he was the only one finding it funny to joke about his death.
“Drop it Tony, okay? Accept that maybe it was destiny I was there. We were damn lucky, I have done cardiac massage on nine people, you included, and I saved only two, most people don’t survive… but nobody knows who’s going to survive, so we try it on every person. Maybe I was the one pushing your chest, but it was God deciding to let you stay. Please stop making everything I say about me saving your life.”
Tony scoffed but didn’t fight. “Lucky you, you saved my life. I usually don’t let people boss me around, especially those I know for three days.” And with a sigh, he fell back onto the couch.
He always questioned his sexuality. He always thought that guys were way more attractive than girls, but he couldn’t ever connect with them. Everything was ever only physical, and he just needed more. Steve wanted love. And then he had laid eyes on Tony. There was this major attractiveness point but so much more… Yes, he fell fast and hard but he was eager to make it worth.
“I’m shocked you’re opening up to me.” Steve answered him honestly. “But, I thought about all these things too, after you practically ran away from me. So, I have a surprise for you, upstairs. And just to be clear, I invite you to a date in your own house.”
Tony refused to go sleeping while Steve made something to eat. Instead he sat on the bar stool and watched Captain America cooking. Well, Tony called it watching, Steve thought about it as desperately trying to not fall off the stool while keeping his eyes open. It took Tony twenty minutes to actually fall asleep with his head on the table. Steve tried to be more silent after that, he would not dare to move the man who would probably just wake up. He must take the risk of Tony just falling of his seat.
“Yeah, yeah, I do! Why?” He wondered and felt how he was defensive yet again, it was one of his rather unpleasant characteristics.
She smiled at him. “Yes. My colleague gave him an infusion late at night.” She took off one of the multiple bags hanging next to Tony. “It ran out probably an hour ago. He should wake up soon. And he should eat after, Dr. Yinsen will come for a check-up around 10 o’clock.”
Steve smiled and decided they would find out soon enough or not at all, no need to think further about it. Instead, he leaned closer to kiss Tony’s cheek. The billionaire turned around and the kiss landed on his lips. “No need to be so innocent.” He whispered against Steve’s lips. The soldier smiled.
He was a lucky kid because his mom was the greatest cook on earth, and after she died he was in the army where he still didn’t need to do a lot of cooking. Whenever he was back home, he lived off cereals and take-out. He should use the two months to learn some basics.
“They think he might be the cause to your abduction.” Steve spilled out what Pepper had forbidden him to do.
To make the list short, he was only allowed to be on the street as long as there weren’t any politicians around. It was a mess. He was free but at the same time, he wasn’t. And with that deal, that Tony and his lawyers had concluded, there came the first fight between Steve and Tony. And it was ugly.
And just like Steve decided not to fight over the money, Tony gave in too, put the blankets over and around him, but only to snuggle at Steve’s side right after, while the latter would feed the two of them with the whole plate he made.
“Listen, Cap… It’s not against you or your friend. I just want to be sure we’re not getting ourselves into danger.”
“This is less about wanting than needing, Honey. We need it, and I just want us to be okay for the future. For us, for the Avengers but also for the people who believe that we’re always ready to defend them, and honestly, I’m not sure we are right now.”
The doctor put the stethoscope back around his neck. “I planned on telling the nurses to give you an extra pudding for dessert, but I just changed my mind.”
The elevator doors opened and Tony flinched. He totally jumped two feet away from Steve. His back pushed against the fridge, which made him jump yet again and he was back into his nervous state. Steve took his hand and forced him behind his back, before he went into the living room to greet their visitors.
“I do.” And without any hesitation, Steve walked along the hallway to the elevator that would bring him to Tony.
“Killing people is just false. I won’t do that all my life. Don’t get me wrong I’m proud of a lot of my work. I saved people, soldiers, civilians, a lot of kids… but I’m not proud to be the one to make the call if we have to attack.”
Steve nodded once and let go of his friend to sit back on his place. A little ashamed of his outburst, he only waved at the rest of the group.
“I heard he’s a billionaire and lives in the biggest building of New York. You should keep him, think about all the stuff he could buy you.”
Tony crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow. “Wow, you’re going all-in here? Maybe I don’t even care that much about why you do what you do.”
But he also knew that this was a lost case, for now. He maybe only knew the guy for two weeks, but even God himself wouldn’t get him to stop working. Steve just needed to find something that Tony found more interesting that his work. He sighed. Yeah, that was clearly an easy task.
Pepper smiled pitifully and stopped him on track. “Keep calm, James. We cannot help him, when you’re acting like a dumb kid. We won’t get Obadiah out of it, not yet…”
But Tony. He looked down at the small man in his arms, finally relaxed in his sleep. Steve hadn’t spent that much time with him. During the Chitauri Invasion, and a little after, some phone calls… So, he wouldn’t say he was an expert when it came to the man, but he was sure he had never seen Tony as relaxed as right now, when he was with him, Steve Rogers, whose best friend killed his parents.
I bring in some subjects of the MCU, but I modify them a little to make them fit into my story line.
“I can’t tell you a lot, for now.” Dr. Yinsen started. “I need Tony’s agreement to inform you properly, the only thing I can say… He made it through, already fighting his anesthesia, but he’s very drugged and sleepy. He’s in intensive care, so you can see him, but only one at a time, please? Tony has room to himself, but I don’t want him to get stressed, alright?”
“What?” Tony’s best friend sounded alarmed. “Is Tony alright? Is he back in hospital? Why didn’t he say anything?”
They were both shaken up, that much was clear. Steve didn’t know what Tony was planning to do, and Tony didn’t know if all the things they worked on the past week had gone to waste in the last half hour. Plus, they obviously had no idea they could trust each other in their decisions.
“Bruce just wanted to give me a history lesson, wanna join? He wanted to talk about the Nazis that didn’t want to be Nazis.”
Steve was a little relieved. Tony still called him by his name, which was a good sign if you knew the man. But Steve also felt his pain, deep inside his eyes. And he knew, Tony would never forget, as if he had not already enough nightmares to live through.
They fell back into their chitchat for a little while, until there was a silent knock on the door, a moment later Howard Stark walked in, although it took the group a few moments to actually recognize him. Tony was yet again confronted with the fact that his father was not the man he used to be.
“Yes, Dr. Yinsen instructed me. He thought you would probably ask. I will come back with an infusion, just a moment.” It took her about five minutes before the sleep drug was floating his blood. “Good night, Tony.” She told him and Tony only smiled, closing his eyes.
“Might as well get a break, Steve wouldn’t let me work the whole day…” He murmured. “And we have to go back on speaking terms, right? Let her up.”
Steve nodded. “You’re right. I get in contact with Nat; she can get Hawkeye on the game. Tony, you get Bruce back here.”
Tony really was gorgeous, not only for him but probably for half of the population, but it was Steve that saw him like this, sleeping, with swollen eyes, red face and still his perfect jawline with his goatee that had the little silver inside. He was perfect.
Steve couldn’t describe how Tony smelled, part of it was his expensive perfume he wore, some was the scent of his favorite coffee, he didn’t know the name but it came from Columbia, there was more to it, but he was not sure what. He only knew he loved it, and it helped him fall asleep.
“Nobody said anything to me, if that helps.” Sam offered with a grin, and even if he didn’t know, he wasn’t surprised at all.
“Doc said if I want to survive, I have to protect my arteries, no fast food for me, for the next, I do no… feels like forever.”
“I’m sorry Tony. I was angry and mean, and completely unnecessarily unfair to you. I came to apologize. I really don’t want to destroy our friendship. And I wanted to wish you good luck with Steve. You deserve to be happy!”
“Why would they torture him?” Bucky wondered. “He was there for three months, right? They wanted money, and if they get it or not, they should have killed him. And if they wanted secrets or weapons and Tony wouldn’t give them, they would also have killed him.” Bucky made a point.
“Steve, honey. You’re the best. No need to pay. I told you, choose the place, what you did, and I pay. Even if I imagined something else. Really no worries, okay? Eat something.”
Tony, on the other hand, stared at the ceiling. The noise was getting to him. Last night, he had still been unconscious but now, he was wide awake. No sleep to come. Only him and his thoughts.
“Do you think all of the German soldiers fought because they believed they were doing a good thing? Because I’ve scientific and historical proof against it. How can you be sure about this? Obviously, you are afraid of him, if not you wouldn’t put him into a Hulk proved room.”
“Technically, I’m not paying you. Just take it, Steve, please. It won’t hurt me the slightest. I’m a billionaire’s son, soon to be billionaire. As for in six months. So please, keep me company.”
Pepper laughed. “Tony let him in pretty fast. I’m sure it’s reciprocally.” She sighed and picked up her bag. “I’m gonna have a look at the troublemaker. I don’t have that much time myself, a lot of work waiting for me.”
His anticipation faded quickly when his eye caught the sight of a young man with brown hair that seemed to struggle to walk. His first thought was that he was drunk or drugged, but he talked to someone on the phone, no slurring in his voice. He had the back to Steve, so he couldn’t see any other indications for his assumption.
“Because he loves Steve, and deep inside he knows that Barnes himself is a good guy, and we may be able to get the shit that HYDRA left inside of him, out of his mind.” Bruce explained and Steve only got happier. Bruce put his doubts aside then.
“That’s absolutely fine… I know for you guys the war is ages ago, but for me… it’s not even a year… You should have seen him in the war. Nobody can change that much within that amount of time, or do you want to tell me, he really lived the past 70 years? Maybe, you could just trust me here?”
Tony sighed and leaned back so his head lied on the couch headrest. “How could I wish for someone to die, so I could live another ten, if I’m lucky 15 years? They will need a young heart… The mere thought makes me sick. And even if I get one, I need a new one again and again, but I won’t get one at a point. It’s like as if we were delaying my death only by pure luck.”
Tony opened his eyes only slightly when he heard Pepper enter the room. She sat down on a chair, next to his left side. He tilted his into her direction and cracked a tiny smile.
The past days neither of them could stop talking. They laughed a lot together but he also had held Tony’s hand when he had cried during one night when a panic attack had taken over his mind. The Stark son had shown his most genuine and sympathize smile when he talked more about his parents and the day he nearly lost Bucky.
“I know you’re trying to be sweet and all, but actually, it’s getting ridiculous. Big time there. Stop it.” Tony sighed. “But, I still want to tell you…”
“Are you going to die?” Steve asked right away, withholding his own tears. Why was he nearly crying? He didn’t know Tony. He was acting utterly ridiculously. Tony might think he was weird, saving him was one thing but showing up with gifts in the hospital and asking if he was going to die was another big jump forward.
“It is.” Tony admitted within a second. “And don’t ask me why I didn’t tell you. I hardly know you and you had just saved my life. I didn’t want you to think it was a waste for trying.”
“I fucking have no time, Obie! Get your shit done yourself!” Brown hair screamed into the phone. “I’m not building that thing. It’s dangerous in the wrong hands.” The man bent forward, he seemed to be in pain. “Yeah! I know that, and later I found out what a stupid idea that was. The military shouldn’t have it either. So, fuck you.” He jerked the phone into his pants pocket and clenched his shoulder with the other and.
Steve stepped closer to Tony, which was difficult since they were already pretty close to each other already. He put aside a streak of hair hanging into Tony’s forehead. “I only knew you through Bucky and Nat’s stories but something is telling me that you are changing.” He said with a silent and comforting voice. “And it sounds great by the way, maybe not a beach house, though.”
Tony blew up his cheeks. “Well, let’s start our ‘Welcome in the 21st century lesson’ with this, don’t ever use that word again, and I mean it ever. And also any other words you probably learned. We say homosexual or gay. Avoid anything else.”
Without saying anything else, he pushed the bottle nearer to his friend. Tony tried his best version of puppy eyes, which usually where quite effective but Steve wouldn’t forget the image of his body so soon, plus his eyes still looked like hell. Steve just turned away. “I have some crackers for you and some porridge…”
Steve frowned. “I understand that, don’t you think everybody will bother him during the match? And before and after? I probably would hide too.”
“I try to keep my head down in the army.” Steve answered first. Hoping Tony would get the message without really getting it. He wanted Tony to understand, but like that he couldn’t prove it, right? He never used the word.
Steve leaned back in his seat and let go of Tony’s hand. “I’m going to tell you, if you go on a date with me, a real date. Give me a least a chance.”
“It could kill hundreds of people, only one of them.” Tony answered. “I can build it and if you’d give my dad some time, he would too.” He sighed. “After my advice, he decided to not even have a look at it. Obie, on the other hand, tried to understand but never will. He still wants it on the market.”
It took Steve four hours to arrive back in New York at the Stark Tower. At first, he wanted to call, but then he decided he had to take things in his own hands. Calling would not tell him, what Tony felt, how he was doing. He could not see if Tony tried hiding something from him.
“When he said, he wants you to live, and you answered that this was the point of the story, that you wanna live.” Steve swallowed once. “But you don’t know if you will, right? This is not about you now wanting the operation… you just believe it won’t change a lot.”
Waiting in the hospital wasn’t something Steve was unfamiliar with. He waited once when they tried to bring back his mom. And failed. It was the time, when they knew she wouldn’t be there for long. He stayed with her in the hospital for as long as he was allowed every day.
Rhodey shook his head. “Alright, Pepper was shaken up when she called me. You should talk to her again. Anyways, I’ll be back as soon as possible and warn your new boyfriend. I’m still having a talk with him and if needed I will put on the suit.”
“I won’t do that. Never. And, I understand. Plus, Rhodey was not brainwashed and killed my parents, so I think Rhodey and I can totally get along.” Tony laughed a short moment.
“To find Barnes. Help him remember, getting him back to being a good man.” Tony clarified and shocked Steve, who lost his voice. They had talked about Bucky and Steve going on a mission to find him. Tony told him it was alright, he just wanted to keep his distance, until he was a hundred percent sure, Bucky was back at being Bucky. Where did this idea come from?
Tears sprung to his eyes. Tony had no control of his body. He already pictured himself in fetal position on the ground, bouncing back and worth. A panic attack took over. He trembled. His heart was racing. A dry sob came out of his mouth. It needed an explosion to take him out of his dazed state. He wasn’t sure how long he sat there. A couple of seconds, some minutes, more? He had to go.
And lastly, today's song is a german one that I listened to when I wrote the last lines of the chapter and I couldn't not take it as title. It's about love, but not in the way we usually use the word. It's about respect and love towards everybody, and that everything will be fine when we start to love each other.
“I’m still not getting over that part. Give me some time. And also, what happened to Pepper? Last time I checked they were a couple.” Clint asked.
There was one thing, though, he knew for sure; Tony was worth all the pain he could imagine. So, Steve tried to be his usual self when he arrived back, and Tony gave him a room tour. Steve had insisted Tony should stay on the couch, but the kid ignored him completely.
Tony let his head wander for a while, maybe he would fall asleep while writing an update for the new StarkPhone in his head. Time passed from 2:28 to 3:16 and he couldn’t bear it anymore.
“He can’t say anything.” Tony answered. He really wasn’t a person to play the what if game, only if it didn’t play in his favor.
“You’re right.” Steve answered and closed his eyes again. There was nothing else to do than sleeping and trying to relax while Tony took care of the mess happening around them. He was pretty good, Steve was proud of his man; maybe in the future it would be for the best if they co-leaded the team.
Tony grinned. “Course, I would. If Clint wants to, I’ll talk to them. But again, he will probably be one of the first picks, Giants will have to do really bad to get an early pick and I really don’t want that. Maybe he can go to a shit team for two years and then trade to the Giants.”
“Since I’m in here, Steve didn’t show up. So, he probably has better things to do and since he let me beat him up while he tried to convince me I was out of my mind, it must be someone or something important to let the Wilson guy do the work. He seemed more stubborn the last time.”
Bucky smiled a moment. “Steve always loved books. When you got me the books, I remembered how in the war he would always read when he wasn’t about to die, that or drawing. He loved that too.”
When she had called Tony, he hesitated and told her, he would give up Iron Man for Pepper. But he was Iron Man, this suit changed his life, changed him for the better, why take it away from him? Although she understood the pain Pepper must have felt for the last years, believing multiple times Tony had died. Relationships were complicated, better stay single.
“Leave it, Obie. He’s staying.” Tony said simply, he hadn’t even moved an inch since the two men went head to head. Stane didn’t blink once. He didn’t back down either. “Come on guys.” Tony tried again.
“See you soon, Tony. And don’t forget the Jericho.” The first man called into the room while walking out. The Jericho? That’s what Tony fought about on the phone, wasn’t it? God damn it, what the hell was that?
“Try my best.” Tony whispered while his checks got a little rose color on them. It made him look a lot cuter than he already was. It was unfair how Tony was cute and hot at the same time. God should have made that impossible to happen.
Steve shook his head, remembering the first months of Bucky’s recovering. At first, he cried all night, pleaded to god… not because of his limb but he pleaded to die. He had other injuries that pained him but mostly his limb hurt him, the one missing. For weeks they put him on morphine.
“Captain, make sure your team member takes his medication, eats and sleeps a little more and better. I will come back for a checkup in three weeks.” Steve walked up to him and shook his hand.
Steve walked up to him and sat down next to Tony on the bed, laying an arm around the smaller man. “I’m still. I can be your guardian without being there physically, but I’m still there, okay? Pepper will be there, Bucky and Nat, Sam if you want him. You’re never alone. I really wanted to be there, but this.” He gave Tony a kiss on his temple. “I can’t tell you why, but maybe I can after, okay?”
Steve pushed Tony of him, more or less gentle and jumped off the bed to hide behind the next door he could reach. “Steve?” He heard a murmur from Tony, before he closed the door behind him.
He saw how Tony’s body wanted to break down but that his mind kept him on his feet. How he wanted to cry and scream but just swallowed it down, because he kept on repeating that he was the heir to Stark Industries. He was the only one to carry on, so he had to.
“Sorry, I have to break it to you, but that situation literally screams motive from the beginning till it’s end, honestly. You sure, he wasn’t the source of Tony’s abduction?” Clint wondered.
“I cannot talk to him. We are too related. And I’m surely cannot let Tony to him, we don’t need any panic attacks or murder, from any side.”
“Bucky remembers a red book. Well, he freaked out a moment when I bought him some of Natasha’s Russian books, one was red and he threw it away, then he remembered.”
The next day found Steve leaning on Tony’s bar, drinking a cup of coffee while his doctor, Dr. Goldstein took care of his man. He smiled into his cup, yeah Tony was now his man. Only his. God, he loved that feeling already.
Steve’s decision hadn’t really a big impact, the genius only looked ashamed for about three seconds, before he grinned and fixed Steve’s tie. “I would have teared you out of it yesterday, so it probably was better for us, that I didn’t get to see it.”
“Just imagine.” He whispered to him in the middle of the night, sitting in the big Stark penthouse in the middle of New York City. “Just imagine, if we both die. Everything will fall into his hands, and there would only weapons, weapons over weapons. The world will go down thanks to Stark weapons. One day, even Obadiah might accomplish to finish the Jericho. Third-world war financed and supported by Stark weapons. I can’t do that Steve, not now.”
Steve wanted to answer that he wouldn’t mind. He stopped himself, just before the words wanted to come out of his mouth. Tony was probably right. When Steve had looked into his eyes for the first time, he had instantly fallen in love with the genius and something was telling him, that Tony wasn’t so opposed to the idea of going out with him. But, they probably met at the wrong time and place.
Steve did do the dishes. He needed to occupy himself. He was totally overthinking the conversation, but he didn’t want to sleep yet. It was late, but he had slept for days, he wasn’t tired. But he was utterly confused. Was it a good sign Tony wanted him to stay? Or was it a bad sign he didn’t give a direct answer? Steve wanted to smash the glass in his hand. Why does everything in his goddamn life had to be so complicated? Would ever anything good stay in his life?
Sam shook his head. “I’m sorry, Romanoff but I’m sure Steve does not swing this way. It’s friendship.”
“I can’t eat, Rogers. I throw everything out.” Tony answered honestly. Steve knew he was telling the truth, because Tony looked away from him. He was ashamed. “I’ve got some ulcers. It hurts like hell when I eat. And it does not take long for it to come the wrong way up again.”
“Wow, at least I’m not banned on the couch!” Steve answered sarcastically. When he heard a door shut close, he groaned loudly. “God, you’re going to be the death of me, Stark!” He pushed himself off the couch and walked down the hall to find his sleeping place for today.
Tony smiled again, a little sad, though. “I like him. He’s a great guy, funny, honest. Straight forward, but still sweet enough to get Nat.”
Ever since he became Captain America the persona Steve Rogers had faded away until there was no more of that little boy, only Captain America, every time but with Tony… If they flighted or talked, if they were joking or being serious, he always was just himself. He didn’t need to spend a second thinking about saying or doing what Captain America would do.
I didn't even plan the second part of this series when I wrote the first part but now I just can't stop. I wanted to finish with Chapter two but it's completely impossible and now even Chapter 3 isn't the end.
“I mean, Steve’s floor is probably being cleared… There are still a dozen others, but they’re being renovated… You know, this crazy alien guy and Hulk happened, so it needs some time.”
“Yeah… you’re right. Did he tell you, that they met at my party? And that’s where I saw him with his injury. He gained a new limb and a girlfriend on one night.”
“They will probably adopt about three kids, that will drive us mad and at the same time we will be the cool uncles and aunts.” Bruce stated.
After the first talk with the ONU, Wakanda had been generous enough to help out with technology, South Korea sent two doctors and Tony himself built a security system. That had been the deal. They would test if Bucky was actually back in his own mind and after that he wouldn’t try him as long as he wore an ankle tag. He wasn’t allowed in any political related building, not near schools or companies that hadn’t allowed his entrance beforehand and a few other restrictions.
“I’m not in the closet.” Tony answered cryptically, since technically it wasn’t a no, but not a yes either.
His friend couldn’t answer that and Steve shouldered his bag. “I rather have a little time with people I like, love… than have nothing at all. I would regret it, if I wouldn’t get to know him better. See you, Buck.” He walked to the door and turned around again before leaving. “Tony told me to invite you guys for tonight. He wanted all his friends around, eating some take-out, playing games.” Steve nodded once to himself. “But you probably don’t want to get attached.”
“I am. I am a genius.” Tony answered. “And you should be grateful to be a part of the company, now fuck off I’ve seen enough of your shit face. I do what I want, and I know what’s good for my father’s company. And if you don’t like it, then leave!”
Sam raised his hand to threat Tony with a slap across his face. “He’s joking.” Steve said and he was really relieved that he could honestly say that Tony joked. “Tony is actually happy to have another tech guy on the team. You are an Avenger now, if you want.”
“And your man needs you now. At the latest I will be back for the wedding, if I’m allowed?” He asked again into Tony’s direction. The billionaire only nodded once, he probably didn’t even hear the question and just reacted. Bucky turned around to face everybody at some moment. “Thank you all. I hope I can show my gratitude for what you did, one day. I don’t take it for granted.”
“No, it obviously couldn’t! And you know why? Because I’m gonna break that guy’s head and after I’m giving Steve a shovel talk he’s never heard in his entire life, and after it I’m gonna slap him across the face because that killer machine is in your home!”
The four men had met after work in Tony’s living room, discussing what they found out and what their next steps would be. The problem was, that Tony was completely spent. He had had his nightmares the other night, then Barnes showed up and he had a minor anxiety attack and then they went to work. It took him mere minutes to fall asleep on Steve’s lap.
He was 26 years old and some months ago promoted to Captain. His Dad would be proud. Mom would be too, he knew they watched over him. He had been in some nasty situations back in Iran and Afghanistan but he survived, without major injuries. Sometimes, he wasn’t sure how he managed it. It had to be his guardian angels.
“Yeah, alright, how about you don’t see that as our first date? We’re going as friends, watching a football game of one of your friends with our other friends? It will be just a group of friends having a good time, as friends.”
“I’ll make sure there’s a plane waiting for you, the moment you tell me where to pick you guys up, alright? I’ll have to go now, but one last thing. Don’t tell Tony anything, he believes I’m just training the new kids down here.”
“Don’t worry, I think his lights are out until you shoot an arrow at him.” He glanced away from Tony to Clint. “And no Hawkeye this was not your permission to do so.” The archer grinned and sat down.
