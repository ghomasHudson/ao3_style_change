"And I don't suppose we can trace his name?" asked Sam. "Peter Stark-Rogers isn't exactly an innocuous name, so if we start asking around maybe we could find someone that he ran into."
"Yeah, I did," said Tony. "I was up there on the observation deck watching, and it looked to me that you could barely walk once your feet hit the floor. I'm pretty sure if your buddy hadn't been there you would've face-planted right there next to your aircraft."
Peter's shoulders sagged as he shook his head. "No, that was it. But at least we know that wherever it is has to be out in the water or something, right?"
"Hey, buddy!" Dad said as the door swung open. Peter gasped as Dad wheeled Papa inside in a wheelchair, looking like he'd been through hell in his huge, goofy sunglasses and his hands and feet all wrapped up in thick white bandages.
“Then it appears that our suspicion was correct,” Thor suddenly says from behind Steve’s shoulder.  “This must be the location where the Tesseract has been hiding all this time.”
To his surprise he found Steve standing outside his office door, still wearing his sweat-plastered flight suit.
"So, how's Dad doing?" Peter asked once Steve finally released him. "Seems like he's healing just fine."
"Yeah, he and Bucky are down in his lab," Dad said. He picked up a piece of bacon from the tray, breaking off a piece. "Why?"
And especially for Peter's sake. Because no matter how low Steve got on any given day, it was still a million times better than having to watch his poor son suffer through his own horrible nightmares and flashbacks, and he knew that Tony felt the exact same way. They weren't coming as frequently as they had right after the water monster attack—thank
“Thanks, J.  I owe you one.”  Pocketing his phone, Tony pushed open the door and raced inside, heading straight for the back.  Finding the doorway labelled Restroom, Tony paused, softly knocking three times before sliding it open, his eyes going wide at what he saw.
"If that's what you call it," replied Thanos. "But random. Dispassionate, so no one could buy or bribe their way out of it. Fair to rich and poor alike. And instead of thanking me, they called me a madman. And then, what I predicted came to pass." He lowered his arm, the mirage of a beautiful Titan disappearing to reveal the very real ruins where they now hid.
Shifting his gaze back to the man, Steve narrowed his eyes and pursed his lips, begging his body to keep his rising panic contained.  While his serum procedure—and his subsequent dancing monkey time with the USO—had precluded the usual survival training the WWII Army soldiers had been required to complete, Steve had learned enough from the Army manuals and from leading his HYDRA missions to know that he absolutely could not show even a dram of weakness to his captors.
He felt Tony's lips press against his forehead. "All right, then tell you what. If you let me help you up so you can take care of what you need to take care of, I'll rub your head some more once we get back into bed. Sound good?"
Nostalgia hit Tony like a speeding train as he looked Peter—his sweet boy—up and down, not understanding how in the hell he had managed to grow up so fast right under Tony's nose. While he was still shorter than Tony, he had managed to get a lot closer to eye level over the course of this school year, and his jawline had sharpened up, with his cheeks losing a bit more of their roundness.
"Hey, Cap, why don't you let me take the stick for awhile, hmm?" Sam said as he dropped into the copilot's seat next to Steve. "You've been at it for almost twelve hours already, I'm sure you could use a break."
“Mmm,” muttered Dad, his eyes still glued to his tablet.  “Got too caught up in your amazing find, huh, bud?”
"Yeah, okay, but I don't think that's gonna work," Lang said. "You see, if Hank doesn't stop this Darren Cross guy, then—"
"Uhh, I honestly don't know," Peter whispered back. "They act like that a lot, but they don't live together or anything, so… kinda, I guess? I'm not really sure if any of us understand their relationship."
"Oh, yeah? Well, pardon me if I don't give a damn what you think!" retorted Dad. "And we wouldn't even need the goddamn ship if Professor Snape here would just teleport us there instead!" Freeing his right arm, Dad picked up a small rock and tossed it in Dr Strange's direction, glowering as it hit some sort of personal deflection shield and bounced harmlessly away.
"Have you ever noticed any side-effects from your serum procedure, Captain?" he finally asked. "Anything you would consider… peculiar?"
Fury hadn't been able to tell Tony exactly what kind of research was being conducted in the destroyed building, only that the Wakandan king had been touring the hospital next door when an explosive device detonated, killing at least thirty people and wounding almost a hundred more. As soon as news of the explosion broke, Fury reached out to the Wakandan delegation, offering the Avengers' personal assistance in discovering the identity of the perpetrators, an offer that the king's son, Prince T'Challa, said he would take under advisement.
hadn't been the next to last item on his list, Steve would’ve already locked the front door and raced to his room to take care of the raging hard-on he’d had ever since he and Tony first shook hands, the two hours remaining till closing time be damned.
"Yeah, that's what I thought," James muttered, rolling his eyes. "JARVIS, tell Bruce to meet us in the infirmary, will ya?"
"Well, that's about all you can do," said Pepper. "You'll let me know if there's anything I can do to help?"
"Pretty sure the entire universe knows how much you hate resting, Dad," Peter said. "It's not exactly breaking news."
He was silenced by Tony's lips, pressing against his in a kiss meant to convey such a wide multitude of things that tears sprang to Steve's eyes. Love, acceptance, and understanding were just a few of the underlying aspects that Steve was able to take from Tony's simple, three-second kiss, not to mention the deep intimacy that defined every single one of their touches.
Heading out of the lab, they found the rest of the team sitting in the living room, evidently continuing the discussion they had started over dinner the previous night. They all fell silent as Tony and Bruce approached, with Steve's gorgeous face so tentatively hopeful that Tony's heart gave a lurch.
"I'm—I'm not supposed to talk to you," she said in an accent that Peter couldn't quite place, and barely loud enough for him to hear over the deafening roar of the battle.
Steve let out another sharp moan as the pleasure coil began to wind deep inside his gut, spiking as Tony's fingers on his ass slid over to brush across his crack. He shifted, capturing Tony's lips again in another bruising kiss as he wrapped his hand around Tony's, slowing the speed of his strokes. He was close, so very close, but he wasn't ready for it to be over just yet. He wasn't ready for their little window of early-morning bliss to close. There was so much uncertainty ahead of them, with the mission and with Peter's health, and Steve just wanted to stay inside their cozy and intimate bubble as long as he possibly could.
"Well, I can't say that it's good," James said as they entered Bruce's lab, where the pager sat connected to one of his external power sources. "It just kinda stopped whatever the hell it was doing."
"It should be," Peter said. "There's not a single person in my class who doesn't think that Uncle Thor's just totally awesome, and they all think the rest of the Avengers are pretty cool too. In fact, Gwen was just telling me that her little brother talks about you guys all the time around his own friends, and I'm sure he's not the only one. This has to be just a subset of the government who just wants to control everything."
Tony scrubbed a palm down his face, tilting his head as he studied the code. Back then it hadn't been too unusual for scientists to take their work home with them, and Tony had allowed it as long as any external servers they were using had been examined and preapproved.
Tony let out a soft growl, gritting his teeth as he stepped back again. Rhodey was right; the last thing they needed now was to start fighting before they had any semblance of a plan in place.
“Yeah, maybe, but…” Tony’s shoulders drop as he looks away, twisting his hands.  “Steve, JARVIS is offline.  I—I can’t get him to work, so… it’s probably because of wherever the hell we are, but I’m not sure if I can—if I can do something like that without him, so—”
"Okay," Natasha said slowly as she and Steve led Scott into the living room, where he immediately began pacing a path between the two big couches. "Um… well, I'd offer you some coffee, Scott, but—"
"Peter?" Steve asked, gently shaking his shoulder. "Wake up, little guy, please? I need to see you open your eyes, okay?"
"Steve," James suddenly said from behind him. He must've been saying goodbye to Carol. "The device was loaded inside your aircraft before sunrise this morning along with all of your water and rations, so you're good to go."
"Great!" He gently clapped his hand on Peter's shoulder. "Would you mind showing me some of your drawings?"
"Goddamnit," Tony muttered. "I don't suppose that you have any idea what the hell Pete was looking at?"
Thankfully, both the ticket seller and most of the early-morning commuters on the ferry seemed to be just as tired as Peter felt, so no one paid him too much attention as he purchased his ticket and boarded the ferry, taking a seat inside so as to stay out of the dense, chilly fog. The fog was just as thick as he'd hoped, and so would hopefully provide him with enough cover to fly out to the prison as long as it didn't burn away before he got to Jekyll Island.
"Oh God, sweetheart," Steve panted, his breaths hot puffs of air on Tony's already overheated skin. "You just feel so

"Oh, shit!" cried Cam as missiles and bullets began streaming across the sky like fireworks, the likes of which Steve had never before seen. "Where the hell'd all this come from!"
"From what we can tell, Raxton was Smythe's research partner," said Bruce. "But according to this document, apparently Smythe got cold feet when he was ordered to run an experiment that he didn't agree with, so he tried to resign."
"Mmmhmm. And what happens if someone happens to say 'no' the next time the Avengers want to just waltz into another country on one of their missions, hmm? Would they leave?"
Before they embarked on the most dangerous mission of his entire life, Steve wanted to make love to his husband.
"All right, Tony, we're almost there," Bruce said from the U-shaped command set-up, elbowing Thor in the side when he tried to peer at the monitors. Next to Thor stood Natasha, furiously taking notes on a notepad while Clint read over her shoulder, his left hand clutching Pietro's elbow.
Dad huffed, scratching at the back of his head. "Ah, we kinda killed the alien dude who was sent to get the Time Stone."
"All right," Steve said in his Captain's voice. He bent down, giving Tony a quick kiss on the cheek. "Please, be careful."
"Yeah, but back then you were just a dumb-ass kid," Rhodey had grumbled. "Now you're just a dumb-ass adult who should've learned how to wash his own damn clothes a long time ago."
“How ‘bout all the calls except for Pepper, yeah?” Dad finally said.  “You know she doesn’t bug us unless it’s a real emergency, so—”
"Oh, yeah, I'm sure you are," Lang said, immediately cringing as he glanced between Tony and Steve. "Are you—I mean… oh God, you're not gonna kill me, are you?"
"Captain," Dr Cho said firmly as she grabbed onto Steve's arm. "If that is indeed the case, then we will take care of him just like we did then. And he will come back to us, just like he did then."
"This is my current understanding of the gems' whereabouts," Thor said. "Captain, I believe that you have determined that my theory regarding the Soul Stone is correct, is it not?"
"Yes, sir!" replied the grounds person, a sergeant, judging by the rank insignia marks on his uniform. "Fire is standing by, and the emergency transport said they'll be here in three minutes."
"I know, Dad. I miss him too," Peter murmured as more tears leaked from beneath his closed eyelids. "But that's what I've been trying to tell you. What I found tonight… it's—it's pretty bad, and now… now I don't know if we'll ever be able to find Papa."
"Okay, Dad," Peter finally said. "I won't—I won't say anything else about it. Just remember that Papa and I, we're both here, and we both wanna help you. But we can't do that until you let us."
"Uh huh, I know," said Peter. He had heard a few students discussing the news stories in the hallways that day, and Ned had even asked him about it during lunch, telling Peter that the president of his mom's book club had called her that morning to ask if she knew if the Avengers were heading to Africa yet.
“Sure thing,” Natasha says.  Then she leans closer, giving Steve a rather ominous smile.  “So… now that you’ve told me all about the kid, what about the dad, hmm?  Is he single?”
A rough hand carefully brushing the hair from his forehead woke him, and he blinked his eyes open to find Dad looking down at him.
"Uh huh." Peter rubbed at his nose, hating himself for having to lie to his own father. "Do you think you'll ever introduce him to Grandpa?"
"Yeah," agreed Uncle Bucky. "According to Colonel Rhodes Stevie's already starting to shiver, so… Tony's afraid he won't be able to communicate too much longer with him."
"All right, then once you've done that you can propose the first part of the plan and see what he says. And if he thinks it's a good enough idea then you can try the next part. And so on, and so on—"
"Really?" Peter squeaked. He cleared his throat, very aware that his face was likely the same colour as his father's armour. "I mean, yeah! That sounds awesome!"
"Mmm," Tony murmured as he brushed his thumb across Steve's knuckles. "You think we could convince him to go to bed at say… seven or so?"
"Have a wonderful summer, everyone!" the teacher called as the students shot out from their chairs like Uncle Clint's arrows, practically tripping over each other in their haste to escape from the room. Shoving his books into his backpack, Peter slung it over his shoulder and stepped back, waiting semi-patiently as Gwen packed her laptop and books into her bag. They had both cleared out their lockers the day before, and so only needed to grab what was left and head out to the parking lot.
And neither of them had managed to get back to sleep again that night. Even after making love and with Steve holding Tony so tightly that he could barely breathe, he still hadn't been able to relax.
—he didn't realise he was pouring it way too fast until the burning hot coffee sloshed over the rim of the cup, dribbling down over his fingers.
"No, Howard, I'm afraid I actually don't know that," Pym said. "So I guess it'll be up to the courts to decide now."
"Yeah, I guess I can see that." Sam let out a heavy sigh, shaking his head. "I dunno, it all just kinda sucks though."
“Uh huh.”  Peter tapped his heels together, his pencil flipping around his thumb at lightning speed as he waited.
And while Peter could understand why his dads weren't ready for the world to be aware of the existence of his abilities quite yet—especially since he wasn't really ready either—it still didn't seem fair that he couldn't tell anyone that
"Sometimes resting can be just as important as sleeping, mo grá," Steve murmured as he trailed the pad of his thumb across Tony's cheekbone. "And sometimes rest can even lead to sleep, if you allow it."
“All right,” he murmured as he took three steps back, readying his shield.  Without taking his eyes off the tree, Steve then launched the shield directly at it, immediately diving to the side as a burst of flame suddenly shot out from the trunk, engulfing the entirety of the rock-filled path.
It was just like the Battle of New York all over again, when he'd watched Tony fly a nuclear missile through Loki's portal while he just stood there on the ground.
“I let them go, Tony,” Obie said.  He let out a frustrated sigh, throwing up his hands.  “Look, those drugs were never going to be money makers for this company!  That division only existed ‘cause your dad was a sucker!”
"Sounds good." Steve remembered all too well the hundreds of days and nights that he'd spent in that room, hooked up to his never-ending breathing treatments.
"Uh huh. See ya then." As soon as the screen went blank, Peter dropped his head back, scrubbing at his tired and wonky eyes with his knuckles. He'd packed his glasses into his backpack thinking that he'd try and sleep on the plane—that'd been Papa's plan, at least—but with Dad vibrating so hard that he was practically knocking the jet off course, Peter hadn't been able to relax enough to fall asleep. He had tried to call Gwen, thinking she'd be able to help him calm down, but her mom had told him that she was out on a daddy-daughter date, and wouldn't be home until late that night.
Besides. How was Peter supposed to have known that Grandpa had created more of his super-secret serum to fix him? Not even Dad or Papa had known about it.
"Of course he did, that was stupid," Tony said. "Who has the authorisation to alter your programming?"
Rhodey let out a sigh as he checked his timepiece. "Look, I gotta get going. Do you need anything before I go?"
"Then yeah, you'd better get going, J," said Tony. "'Cause once I'm certain that this works, I'm gonna be building one for both Steve and Pete, you got that?"
And, since all this junk was just a bit too close to the chest to Dad for Peter’s comfort, then he felt it was also his job to make sure that nothing got missed.
"We shall," Tony answered, just like he always had before. Before the Chitauri, before Stane and Killian, and the horrible aftermath.
Then again, the country had bought Dad and Papa's lie that Peter wasn't Spider-Man back after they were all kidnapped by Obie and Aldrich Killian, and that had been accompanied by actual video evidence, so… maybe the general public wasn't as smart as Peter was trying to give them credit for.
he thought as he turned instead to the task list he had made that morning, crossing off his meeting with General Arnold.
“Yeah, I think so.  I’m just—”  Steve sucks in a deep breath, shuddering again at the terrible taste in his mouth.  “It’s just…
As always, I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
"Eh, don't worry about that now," Tony said dismissively as he cupped Peter's face, stroking his cheek with his thumb. "Are they treating you okay, bud?"
"There'd be no way to fire the engine and return to the orbit?" asked Steve. "It seems to me that as long as you had a fixed point of reference it should be okay."
"How is Pete doing, by the way?" asked Tony. "Any chance we could get him on the phone here so he could talk to Steve?"
“Shh, honey, I know.  Just… c’mere, yeah?” Tony murmured as he tugged on Steve’s shoulder, relief slamming into him like a tsunami when Steve unwound his frozen limbs and turned towards him.  As best as he could, Tony gathered Steve into his arms, tucking his head under his chin.  “I know you need help, and I know you can’t do it alone.  That's why I’m promising you right now that I’m not gonna leave your side.  We’re gonna beat this thing back whatever it takes, okay?  You, me, and Pete.  Together.”
Moving closer to the hospital had been something that Tony had also considered after Peter was diagnosed with his heart defect. But with Howard unavailable—or unwilling—to help pay any of the bills, the cost of trying to find a different house and then move had been too high when combined with the cost of the numerous medications that Peter had to take every few hours.
The battle on the screen continued, with Gwen burrowing closer to Peter with nearly every explosion. She had already been sniffing a bit ever since K2SO's brave last stand, and now Peter could sense that she was starting to suspect what was about to happen.
. Even when you're all sweaty and covered in grease from working on one of the cars or something, you still smell amazing."
"Well, aside from the fact that the climate in Calcutta was a helluva lot better, it's not too bad here," said Uncle Bruce. "Just a bit… cold. And way, way too much fish. I swear, after I leave here I'm never eating another fish. Like, ever in my life."
The word had barely passed through Sam's lips when the MAUDE glasses activated, and four burly men and one tall, muscular woman suddenly appeared on the opposite side of the room, who Steve recognised as the other five Winter Soldiers. They were all crowded around a dark grey table outfitted with heavy metal restraints, chanting various words in what Steve assumed to be Russian while an IV bag attached to a pole on one of the table's upper corners dispensed a bright yellow liquid into their prisoner.
"I am glad," T'Challa said, rather firmly. "I assure you, Mr Stark, we are taking this threat very seriously. We have no desire to see harm come to any of our friends. But, as king, my first duty is to my people, and I absolutely cannot risk their safety by revealing too much, too soon."
He briefly wondered if T'Challa was somehow enhanced. He'd done some digging into the Wakandan culture and history after their initial meeting in Namibia, and while SHIELD's files on the country were woefully brief, there were a few mentions of something called the Heart-Shaped Herb that was supposedly sacred to carrying the mantle of the Black Panther.
"Good," Gwen said, just as a horn honked a few metres away. It was Papa's truck, double-parked on the busy street. "Well, I guess it's time for you to go."
"All right," said Rogers, and Tony could've sworn that the flush on Rogers' cheeks grew even deeper, right along with the deep wrinkle between his eyebrows.
"That's right," Steve said. "It's where we recovered the initial data on the algorithm, and the ship was supposed to be turned over to SHIELD once we left, but—"
To his relief, Steve was able to manage about half of a smile.  “Not in the last five minutes or so, no.”
He also deserved a helluva lot more than to live beneath the shadow of a father whose common tabloid nickname was the Merchant of Death.  But just like Tony had had no control over his future while growing up under the shadow of his own father, it wasn’t Peter’s responsibility to set himself on the right path going forward.
"Yeah, okay, but none of this explains where the hell he is now!" Tony looked over at Gwen, whose cheeks were wet with tears. "You saw him leave?"
Peter absolutely adored his Auntie Nat, and felt very privileged that she allowed him to see the softer side of her that she only revealed to a very select group of people.
most awesomenest thing I've ever seen! You were seriously moving faster than lightning! How the hell'd you do that, you're usually so gawky and awkward!"
"I'd rather not until we can poke around a bit more," answered Tony. "But we should get Bruce in here ASAP, I'm gonna need his help."
Yet another thing that just didn't add up, the pile of which seemed to be growing larger with every passing day.
"So, based on the feedback that we've received from the flight reports and after a detailed analysis of the data, the Air Corps decided to go ahead with the next phase in aircraft design." Tony paused for dramatic effect as he placed the next slide on the projector, his lips quirking into a slight grin in anticipation.
The sound of a running faucet pulled Steve from his thoughts, and he quickly set the notebook back down on Peter's bed, arranging the blankets to cover the page he likely wasn't meant to see.
“Ooh, but I am not only in your face, am I?” he says.  “For we are all in each other’s faces while we wait for our chance to swim.”  He lets out another creepy cackle as he leans down in front of Steve, eyeing him like he’s planning to take a bite out of his nose or something.  “I’ve sometimes wondered why that is, exactly.  Hmm, Steven?  What do you think?”
He reached into his backpack for yet another snack, trying to both distract himself and keep his strength up at the same time. He had loaded up on as many packaged cookies, Little Debbie cupcakes, and bottles of Powerade as he could fit into his backpack with all of the other stuff he'd crammed inside, and had already gone through over half of it, knowing full well that the chances to eat again once he got to the prison would be few and far between.
"We're gonna have to decide about Pete now, you know," Tony said. "He's not gonna give us a moment's peace until we do."
While they had not been celibate in the nine weeks since the sucess of Project Phoenix, their busy schedules combined with helping Peter adjust to everything had often left them too exhausted to do much more than collapse into each other's arms at the end of the day, hoping that Peter would be able to sleep through the night.
"It's not necessary, thank you," Tony barked, no longer caring if he was harsh or not. "I don't need or want anyone's pity." He stole a glance at the prickly Air Corps colonel, wondering how in the hell he had even heard about what happened.
A pang of fear laced with remorse suddenly hit Steve straight in the gut, nearly causing him to double over. He simply could not ignore that his own husband and child should've been there too, standing side-by-side with him. Or preferably just Tony, with Peter safely at home.
"Yeah, bud, I know," Dad said with a sigh. He leaned forward, smoothing the hair from Peter's forehead before planting a kiss there. "I love you, buddy. You just keep on hanging in there, okay? It's all gonna work out."
"Okay, Rhodey, I'd say you definitely picked a winner there," Tony said, smirking at Rhodey's sputtering reply as he took off towards the Asgardian army, hidden under a blanket of shimmering golden shields. There he found most of the team, including Steve, who had Peter clutched in his arms with his shield held over his head.
Peter would definitely be able to move more quietly and easily if he were alone than with a whole team of heroes, and the fact that he could see the supposedly invisible building could also mean that HYDRA wouldn't see him coming until he was already there.
And then, as Steve watched, his eyes burning with tears just as flaming hot as the immense power coursing through Tony's makeshift nanite gauntlet, his husband, none other than Iron Man himself and the strongest person that Steve had ever seen in his life, looked Thanos straight in the eye, his lips pursed in defiant determination.
But Tony had no sooner tapped in his first command when his entire screen went blank, and an ominous, robotic voice came over the comm.
As the Wakandan warriors all fell into formation, Steve, Natasha, and T'Challa, who was wearing a uniform that to Steve very closely resembled Tony's nanotechnology, exited their transports and headed towards the shield dome, where two aliens had taken up position. Steve watched as the smaller of the two, who appeared to be female, ran her weapon across the force shield, almost like she was testing it for weaknesses, as he, Natasha, and T'Challa came to a stop.
“Yeah, Dad.  I know,” Peter says, a bit impatiently.  “I finished my math before you picked me up from school, so all I have left is chemistry and history.”
Tony huffed out a sharp breath, highlighting the relevant statements and handing the tablet to Steve, who quickly read it over.
"Pardon me, Captain," JARVIS said softly a few minutes later. "But Sergeant Barnes and Mr Wilson are requesting access to the penthouse."
"Tony," Steve said again, a bit more forcefully this time. He drew in a deep breath, eyeing Lang warily. "Okay, Mr Lang. Then why don't you tell us what you were trying to steal, and why."
Oh well, it'd probably been for the best anyway. From what Peter had heard about Dr Strange, he was a massive jerk, and Dad did not have a good track record dealing with medical professionals who were jerks. Dad was amazingly generous with most of the doctors and nurses who had treated Peter back when he was little, and sick most of the time, but Peter had witnessed him dressing down plenty of arrogant or jerky ones too. Since Dad had enough intelligence and knowledge to pretty much get his own medical degree in any number of fields, he tended to figure out who he could trust and who he could not very quickly.
“Yeah, I do,” Papa said, his lips curling into a smile.  “And I’m glad too.  It lets me check on you before I go to sleep every night.”
"Eh, it's technically his house, but it’s more like he lives with us," Peter said as his huge brown eyes clouded over with sadness. "He and my dad don't really get along all that great, but… he's old, and he doesn't have anywhere else to go, so…" He paused, biting his full bottom lip as he shook his head. "I don't really wanna talk about it anymore."
The general took a sip of his drink, smacking his lips once he swallowed. "As much as I hate to seem like I'm badgering you, you really have not answered my initial question to my satisfaction."
"Oh, Steven," she sobbed as she came up to Steve, enveloping him in her arms. "Son, I am so—I'm so sorry. I didn't—I didn't—"
"Mmm, I guess you're not too bad yourself," Tony said, barely audible over the nighttime rainshower that had suddenly begun to pelt against their windows, one that Steve had heard about on the evening news report.
"Mmm," Tony grumbled, earning another squeeze of his hand from Steve as General Okoye and another of the women warriors led them inside the palace. Showing the three of them to an ornate, nicely-sized two-bedroom suite, the general gave Tony and Steve a bow, informing them that their luggage would be delivered from the jet shortly, and that a banquet would be served in their team's honour in three hours' time.
A couple of minutes later, away from the revolting pile of sick and with his leg bones back inside his leg where they belong, Steve breathes out a short sigh of relief.  Their ordeal isn't over, not by a long shot, but at least his mind is starting to clear out a little.
"Oh, yes. I noticed that last night, even," she said. "That little crinkle that you get above your nose is the exact same as your father's. But what I've also noticed, just in these last few minutes, is that you're a lot like my son as well. And I don't only mean because he was also a sickly child. I mean you're both kind, compassionate, and loyal."
"Together," Steve echoed, nodding as he kissed him again. Then he wrapped his arms around Tony and rolled so he was on top of him, bracketing Tony's hips with his knees as Tony's long fingers curled around their cocks, stroking them together.
Obie beamed, showing teeth Tony knew cost upwards of five figures a year to maintain.  “See?  Now, that wasn’t so hard, was it?”
That had been a really fun time.  Uncle Sam had taught Peter how to cook gumbo, a yummy dish that Peter had never before eaten, much less knew how to make.  And Peter had taught Uncle Bucky how to play chess, listening while Uncle Bucky told him stories about growing up in Brooklyn with Papa.
"Yeah, like a straight shot to the heart," muttered Clint. "Dude pointed the thing at my chest and it was like I'd suddenly forgotten who I was and who I was working for."
"Your son can heal on his own?" Shuri asked as she dunked a large white cloth into a basin of bluish, sweet-smelling liquid, soaking it through.
Peter's eyebrows knitted together. "No, Ned, it didn't. I'm not a wizard, right? Or a sorcerer, for that matter."
Because as much as he hated to admit it, Steve was probably right. Bucky had spoken to Sam about those trigger words during some of his initial therapy sessions, and had explicitly warned him never to use the words in sequence out of fear that they would trigger Bucky's HYDRA programming, and his mind would once again be lost.
Tony let out a contented sigh as Steve settled into the bed next to him, draping his heavy arm across Tony's chest and yanking him closer until there was absolutely no space at all between them. It was quite a bit earlier than they usually went to bed, as Tony was often working in the lab until at least midnight while Steve watched the news and worked on their training and mission plans, but Tony had to admit that he was rather exhausted after dealing with Damage Control all damn day after working through the night the night before, and Steve… well… Steve still wasn't sleeping all that great, so any extra that he could get was definitely a good thing.
With a sigh, Gwen shuffled the stack of index cards in her hands, eyeing the rest of the team before she started firing various questions at them, the sharp
"Sure, bud, that's fine," he said as he followed Sam off the tarmac and onto the street, heading for the freeway that led home, with Peter falling asleep again not even three minutes later. As soon as Tony engaged the cruise control Steve placed his hand on his knee, looking over at him with frightened yet determined eyes.
"Yeah, but only 'cause you still owe me for the last one, Sheppard," said Cam. He rolled his eyes, quickly downing the rest of his beer. "But now that Rogers is here, I'm thinking that he can cover the next round."
Gwen pursed her lips, yanking hard on her blonde ponytail. "It's probably better if I don't tell you."
“I’m pretty sure we’re both looking a bit worse for the wear,” says Steve.  He raises Tony’s hand to his mouth, kissing the back of it.  “Can I—um… would it be okay if I held you for a little while?  I—I’m just so cold, and I—I really don't like—”
"Well, then I guess the myths are a bit different from the reality," said Uncle Sam. "And I'm sure Thor will be able to tell you all about it once we get back."
Tony had even wondered if Steve had ever been there, but had never dared to ask.  Peter had told Tony about the time when two of Steve’s old Army teammates showed up at his store out of the blue, and how upset he had been afterwards, and the last thing Tony wanted was to upset him even more.  Steve had told Tony a few times that all he wanted was to forget that time of his life, to bury the memories so deeply they would be hidden away forever.  But since there was no way that he could, it was up to Tony and Peter to make sure they never mentioned any of it around him.
sounded a lot more like Captain America instead of a panicking husband and father. Maybe Tony had actually managed to get through to him.
“Ah, yeah, that’s actually a pretty good analogy,” says Tony.  “Just so long as you don't tell him I said so.”
As for making it beyond that, well… Tony preferred to not think about that. Not if he could help it.
“Damn!” he said, running his tongue across his plush bottom lip.  “Pardon me for saying so, but you make that uniform look good!”
"Uh huh," Peter said as Tony gathered him close, all shaking limbs and chattering teeth. Peter's hands scrabbled at Tony's arms, gripping handfuls of his shirt just like he always did when he was a baby as Bucky draped a blanket across his shoulders.
"Pete, I thought I told you not to worry about that," he finally said. "I don't want you wasting your strength on—"
Steve woke with a start, the remnants of a half-remembered nightmare slowly ebbing from his mind as he burrowed closer to Tony, burying his nose into his beautifully soft hair. Ever since he'd moved in Tony had been using Steve's shampoo and soap during their daily morning showers, and the possessive side of Steve absolutely loved it. The combination of his grapefruit shampoo mixed with the faint smell of coconut that seemed to seep from Tony's skin was positively intoxicating, and something that Steve could never get enough of.
"That really sucks that your dad cancelled your birthday party," Ned lamented, his round face filling the screen of Peter's tablet. "Why do you guys always have to have these security breaches when something important's supposed to happen? My parents were really looking forward to coming up to the Compound again!"
Dr Strange shot Dad a questioning look. "This plan of yours relies on the element of surprise, does it not?"
"Hey, babe," Tony said, his expression an odd mixture of grimness and satisfaction. Steve planted a quick kiss on his cheek, then glanced at Bruce's monitor, which was covered in lines and lines of Russian text that Natasha was busy translating.
"Goddamnit," Tony muttered, groaning as the bar of soap he was attempting to use slipped from his hand and slid halfway across the ugly tiled floor of the shower stall.
Tony sighed, scrubbing his palm down his face as Steve gently squeezed his shoulder. Under any other circumstances getting to mess around with the laws of physics—and with time-travel, even if Tony was flat-out refusing to call what they were tinkering with actual time-travel—would fill him with his usual hyper-creative energy. But with what was potentially at stake, Tony found that he just couldn't seem to muster up his usual excitement for it.
"But is it really necessary to have those… what do you call them? Those awful flying bodyguards actually following the convoys?" asked Senator Davis. "I mean, if we've already caught the perpetrator behind the thefts, then why do we still need them? They're not exactly what I would call attractive, and at this point I feel that they only serve to frighten people."
There was just constant, unrelenting grief. Gnawing. Aching. Chipping away at him, piece by tiny piece.
Now, though, it was as if Steve was flying blind in the dark. Even when the Chitauri had first attacked New York, the team had still had some advance warning thanks to Loki divulging his plan to Thor. They had known that the sceptre had been involved in Loki's theft of the Tesseract, and were able to successfully beat him and the Chitauri back thanks to Tony's flight through the portal.
A huge thank-you to the amazing people in the POTS discord server for their help with the bookstore’s name 📚
“I hope so,” Steve said softly, clearing his throat as he handed Peter his shopping bag, along with a flyer advertising the store.  “And if you wouldn’t mind telling your friends about this place, I’d appreciate it.”
Steve's eyebrows knitted together, and he brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "If you had, you might've seen me on occasion," he said. "My teammates and I sometimes come out here after patrol."
Which, although he'd become a certified expert at hiding it over the years, Tony was getting a lot closer to than he wanted to admit.
"Can I—can I hold you?" he added, glancing down at his all-but-useless arms. "Please? I know this doesn't magically fix anything, but—"
"What're you doing here?" Tony asked, so devoid of emotion that it sent Steve's belly plummeting to his knees.
“No!” Steve gasped as he dropped to the ground, clamping his hands over his ears in a futile attempt to block out the horrific, bone-chilling sound.  It wasn’t something that he’d ever spoken of out loud, but the thought of ever again being trapped like he was, of slowly being submerged into icy water, frightened him more than almost anything else.
In that moment, both Steve and Tony had abandoned all pretense of trying to pretend that everything was normal and had pounced on their sweet, precious boy, trying to pour an entire year's worth of hugs into one huge family embrace. Steve had even been so overwhelmed that for a second or three he had been seriously tempted to just take his boys and run. Away from Wakanda, away from all of the battles and armies, and the genocidal maniacs hell-bent on destroying half the universe.
"Mmm," said Bucky, poking his sharp elbow into Steve's side. "Seems like you've already got one though. I swear, Stevie, I've never seen you like this before. It's like you're in a trance every time the guy shows his face. I was even embarrassed for you back there!"
of his heart monitor, and his skin, while cool, wasn't any colder than it normally was. So there was no reason at all for Steve to believe that he wouldn't pull out of this. Again.
Peter's eyebrows shot up, then knitted together into a frown. "Hmph. Well, I'll believe that when I see it," he said, rather impudently. Silly or not, Peter was proud of being the smartest person in his class, and was not at all excited about the prospect of having that challenged.
"Mmm, more like he taught me," said Tony. He huffed out a sharp breath. "But what's all this got to do with your ma?"
Phillips's bushy eyebrows knitted together, and for a moment Steve could've sworn he saw a flash of uncertainty spark in his eyes.
"Was that her leaving in the police car with her father?" Papa asked. "He waved at us when we pulled in."
And right next to it sat another grave, its gravestone in even worse shape, the name barely visible.
"Never!" Steve cried, raising his shield in Tony's direction. A heartbeat later Tony planted his feet and fired his repulsors at the shield, gritting his teeth as Steve directed the beam at Thanos. But just like the axe, Thanos deflected it easily with his blade, blasting away several of his own Chitauri warriors in the process.
"Which isn't at all like you," Bucky said, soft enough for only Steve to hear him. "C'mon, Stevie, you gotta try and focus here!"
"No, no, nothing you can do about it," Dad said firmly. "But I will definitely be making it there tomorrow, okay? Colonel Phillips even said so."
She simply was breathtaking. So unbelievably gorgeous that most of the time Peter couldn't understand what the hell she even saw in him.
A second later Pepper's pretty face filled the wall monitor. She was sitting at the grand desk in her Stark Industries office surrounded by what appeared to be personnel files, twisting a pen in her hands and looking rather harried.
the wizard had said, and even though he was weird and apparently enjoyed speaking in riddles, Peter couldn't imagine why he would say something like that if it wasn't true.
Howard simply couldn't accept the fact that Tony had surpassed his level of intelligence, and since Howard knew he couldn't collect Tony like he'd collected so many other brilliant scientists, he simply chose to ignore him instead.
Peter's eyes dropped, filled with worry. "Yeah, I did," he murmured as he buried his face in Steve's chest, his skinny arms tight around Steve's waist. "Just… please, Papa, be careful. Please? Promise you will?"
"Nah, just giving you a hard time, J," he said with a chuckle. "Not like you'd actually make a mistake, right?"
“So, I don't mind walking you to the door, if that’s okay with you?” Tony softly asked.  “You know, make sure you don't get mugged or something?”
"Yeah, I know, but the science still applies, Dad," Peter cut in. "The writers of Star Trek consulted with some of the top scientists from around the world, and they all agreed that you can't make course corrections at warp. It would tear the ship apart."
"Don't you come near him, you understand me?" Tony warned, his right repulsor aimed directly at Steve's chest. "You goddamn HYDRA scum, you stay away from my son!"
"I don't think being smart has anything to do with it," Steve said. He looked down at their joined hands, trailing his fingertips along Tony's knuckles. "It was more like… rage. I was just so
"Jesus, Steve, you're not crashing a date if we invite you along," Sam retorted. He began to slow down his pace as they approached one of the park's entrances, which Steve reluctantly followed. He didn't feel done quite yet, or at least didn't feel like he'd run off enough of his stress yet, and had half a mind to ask Sam if he could take off for a couple more laps when Sam grabbed onto his arm, halting him.
"Uh, yeah. Why wouldn't it be?" asked Peter, and Tony could just picture his son's eyebrows knitting together into what Tony had long-ago affectionately dubbed his
Tony tilted his head, eyeing his poor husband who looked like he just went ten rounds with his own shield as Peter emerged from the bathroom and climbed back onto the bed, burrowing down into his blankets. Tony and Steve took their respective places on either side of him, with Steve's fingers weaving into Tony's hair and pressing into his scalp.
Peter smiled, reaching to tuck a stray hair behind her ear and wishing that he could kiss her instead. Their hurried first kiss right before he'd escaped out through the boys' room window had been incredible, better than he'd ever imagined it would be, and he was very much looking forward to some more practise.
Maybe it would be better if he were dead. If they were all dead. Then none of them would be left behind, forced to grieve.
"I see," said T'Challa. "Well, you are all welcome here. It is my hope that you will enjoy our hospitality as we work together to solve this particularly difficult puzzle." He turned to the woman standing at his right hand. "My general, Okoye, will show you to your rooms. Please, take some rest from your journey. We will have plenty of time to begin discussions later."
"I'm pretty sure the entire neighbourhood just heard you," Gwen said with a frown. "And I was just helping Peter pack up his books."
"One that can only be seen in The Water of Sight, one of which I was lucky enough to find in our new home, hidden inside a series of caves cut into a mountain," Thor said.
Tony gave an exaggerated sigh.  “Now, honey, what have I told you about having to thank me?  Whatever am I going to do with you?”
But T'Challa had barely given his order when Thanos raised the gauntlet, the Reality Stone glowing a bright red as he curled his fingers into his palm. Stunned, Steve watched as the entire plain began to change, transforming the battlefield into something that resembled a post-apocalyptic fallout.
Sam had warned Steve that it might take awhile for his sex drive to return once he started treatment, and that he needed to be patient while he waited.  It was almost a month after Stane’s arrest before Steve even felt comfortable enough for Tony to give him a handjob, worried that the loss of control he would experience during climax could potentially trigger another breakdown.
Because Strange had been aware of what was about to happen to Peter. He had seen it, in his fourteen-however-million different outcomes that he had viewed during his Time Stone-induced, wanna-be LSD trip.
“Very good, sir,” JARVIS said.  “However, as Ms Williams’ file was encrypted under your order, it will take a few minutes to decrypt.  Please stand by.”
thing a few times when I've been trying to reach my phone," Peter admitted. "The look on my dad's face was pretty funny, I think he thought I was speaking in tongues or something."
If only he could somehow go back.  Somehow relive his senior year, when he became only the third Camp LeHigh swimmer to ever qualify for the Olympic Trials, and the first to actually make it to the Olympics.
"But don't you think it's a bit late for you to still be awake?" she asked. She placed the datapad on the bedside table and curled her bent fingers around Peter's hand, squeezing it gently. "You need your rest, dear. I'm sure your father is still pretty busy there at the base, so… he'll call when he can."
Grunting, Peter shifted again, shaking out his left arm which had fallen asleep. He hadn't thought about it until Flash Thompson happened to make one of his stupid, accidentally-on-purpose remarks during lunch about how Peter actually got to finish out the school year this year.
"Yeah," Peter said, the smile dropping from his lips as he remembered the so-called discussion he'd had with his father. Based on the texts he'd received since he and Gwen had arrived at the Compound, Dad and Papa were enjoying themselves at their festival, drinking beer and indulging in some of Papa's favourite childhood foods in his old neighbourhood. But Peter had a feeling that as soon as they got home, or maybe even tomorrow, given the fact that they were alone in the penthouse for the first time in months, Dad would revert right back to his same, worried-sick self, complete with wearing a path in the hallways as he tried to come up with even more newfangled ideas to keep his family safe.
Which, judging from everything that he'd overheard from Dad and Papa regarding the battle, was probably a good thing. Peter far preferred remembering the feeling of absolute safety and serenity as he woke up in the hospital cuddled between his dads to the horrible sound of shattering glass in Dad's lab, even if he had been confused as hell as to how he got there, and why there was a massive tube poking out of his stomach.
It'd been something that Steve had requested after he'd managed to convince the other X-302 pilots to go along with Project Phoenix, a feat that had both surprised Tony with its ease and not surprised him. For all of his nice-guy,
Pressing the UP button, Steve curled his arm around Tony's shoulders, drawing him close and burying his nose into his hair. At the insistence of Colonel Phillips, both Steve and Tony had showered and changed clothes prior to Steve's discharge from the emergency department, and while the hospital-provided soap wasn't quite as nice as Steve's usual grapefruit shampoo, he still loved the smell of Tony's freshly washed hair.
"Okay. And?" Natasha asked. "Based on what I know about quantum physics and everything that you've told me so far, it seems like it's pretty uncontrollable."
"We don't," said Bruce. "But while I can see Peter doing something like that, it would make more sense for him to do that if there was actually something at that location besides ocean."
"Copy that," Steve stammered, cursing himself for not at least being in uniform. Being forced to fight a battle without wearing his proper uniform only served to increase his fear, reminding him way too much of the bunker battle in Miami where he had almost managed to lose both Tony and Peter in the span of only a few seconds.
"Yeah, but I'm not sure what's got Stevie all excited," said Barnes. "There's really not much out here. It's kinda just a bunch of… black."
"Thank you," Steve said, so sincerely that Tony had to blink back tears. Wordlessly, he climbed back onto their bed, taking his usual place in the centre as Steve curled his tall, strong body around him, his arm draped across Tony's waist.
But the Colonel was cut off as the enemy aircraft suddenly went into a full reverse-thrust, slowing its descent just in time to avoid crashing into the mountain as it released a small, square-shaped payload. Joseph gasped, running his tongue across his dry lips as he attempted to switch his lock from the aircraft to the payload.
"Well, I'm not sure 'cahoots' is the right word, but he definitely enjoyed his cushy position, and all of its perks," Grandma said. "And tended to turn a blind eye to people who were, shall we say, less cushy."
But it obviously wasn't yet enough, especially if this afternoon was any indication. Threats could be coming at them from any direction, not the least of which was from outside of Earth itself, and he needed to do all that he could to stave them off.
"Let me think about the tickets a bit more, okay, Sam?" he asked once Sam was done with the water fountain. "I'll need to talk to Tony about it, and—"
“I know, buddy, I know,” Dad said, holding up his hands.  “I just… I just need a bit more time, okay?  I need to get all of my shit together first, and then—then I’ll go and see Steve.”
"Well, all right then," Gwen said after a pause just long enough to be awkward. She cleared her throat, squeezing his shoulders slightly before stepping back. "Shall we?"
"All right, all right, there'll be enough time for all of the sweet-talking later," Colonel Phillips cut in, clearing his throat. "Let's get this moving, yeah? I'm hungry."
"Pardon me if this isn't part of your presentation, Mr Stark, but I can't help but wonder. The fuel that we currently use in the X-301s isn't designed for space flight, and as far as I know the Air Corps hasn't yet developed any kind of specialised rocket fuel, so how would we even be able to ignite that engine in order to make it out of the planet's atmosphere?"
A knot rose in Tony's throat that he quickly tried to swallow down. In Langara, meeting the parents of your significant other was a pretty big deal, considered to be just a hair shy of a proposal. In all of his years of dating and messing around, Tony had never, ever been introduced to a partner's parents.
"Ohh," Tony moaned as Steve attacked his neck again, his fingers tugging Steve's shirt loose from his pants to glide up his smooth skin. "No way in hell am I saying no to that."
Shoving his hair from his eyes, Peter laid back against his pillows, glancing longingly out his window. It was an absolutely beautiful day outside from the looks of it, the kind of day that would've had him racing around on his bike or climbing the massive tree in the backyard. Dad used to joke that trying to contain Peter on a warm sunny day was like trying to force an explosion back into its bomb casing.
"Nah, they're just being paranoid, as usual," Peter said. He frowned as he studied the board, finally moving his left-side bishop. "They tend to get worse when they're away."
"Mmm," Steve grumbled as he moved Bucky's hand holding the light, trying to see his reflection in the mirror. "I did have a better plan, but—"
He had even said as much to Tony the previous night. They had been lying in bed after making love, with Tony's head resting on Steve's chest over his heart like they always did, and Steve had just broken into tears, apologising over and over for being so caught up inside his own personal bubble that he'd failed to even consider how things were outside of it. Tony, of course, had tried to soothe him, telling him that it wasn't his fault that Peter was sick or that he'd been denied his surgery, but Steve couldn't help but think that through his ignorance he had only compounded the problems that civilians like Tony and Peter faced every single day.
"That makes sense," Steve said, as he placed his hand rather possessively on Tony's shoulder. Chancing a glance up at him, Tony wasn't surprised to see that his jaw was tight enough to cut glass, as he could sense what Steve was thinking as clearly as if he were broadcasting it through JARVIS's speakers.
Several seconds passed before Tony felt even capable of breathing, much less speech.  Steve wasn’t only the most kind and beautiful man that Tony had ever met, he was also the bravest, always the first to dive into any potentially dangerous situation, and so protective of Tony and Peter that sometimes Tony had to remind himself to not take it personally.
"Yep, it is!" Peter said as he launched another web at the wall, managing to break his fall enough to drop down right next to the pile hiding Steve's shield. He quickly hefted it up, holding it in such a perfect imitation of Steve's defensive stance that Steve's breath hitched. "Papa, you ready?"
Peter popped another piece of popcorn into his mouth from the huge bucket sitting on his lap, washing it down with a quick sip of Dr Pepper. His right hand was entwined with Gwen's, having been so since about five minutes into the movie when something had made her jump, and her head was leaning comfortably against his arm. He had dressed in four separate layers in addition to his jacket, knowing that movie theatres were usually cold, but there was so many warm fuzzies radiating up his arm and across his chest from Gwen's touch that at the moment he was almost
On the nearly infinitesimal chance that Tony would ever need to harness the six infinity stones ever again, at least he wouldn't have to worry about being half burned to death. And with the stones now back in their rightful places, one of the Avengers' new tasks would be to ensure that they were never all brought together again.
"I wish I could've too," Peter murmured. "You told me he was in the military, right? Until he got hurt?"
“I see,” Steve said, and while it wasn’t patronising at all, Peter noticed that he was now gripping his belt so tightly that his knuckles were white.  “Well, in that case, is there anything else that you’d like to look at?”
"Yeah, I guess," answered Peter. "But sometimes it just is that straightforward. No one should be dumped from their job just 'cause they got hurt. No one should be threatened to be put out on the streets with a tiny baby just 'cause their spouse was killed, and no one—"
Thor had arrived, along with his new friends, the raccoon called Rocket and the walking, talking tree.
"Oh now, now, is that any way to speak to your authority figure, Peter Stark-Rogers?" Hammer said, or rather, sneered. "I would've thought your
that he saw Pete?" Tony asked, his heart slamming against his ribcage. He hadn't even considered the possibility that Peter wasn't even on the premises. "He doesn't know for sure?"
In fact, Tony had half a mind to suggest to Steve that they do the same that night, once all of the fireworks were done and they got Peter off to bed.
The remainder of the roughly sixty-five minute mission passed without incident, with Steve remarking every few minutes or so about how beautiful it was to view the planet from space and Bucky continuing to tease him about it.
Helen had cut that damned HYDRA uniform from Steve's body once they'd wheeled him into the exam room, so Steve was already naked underneath the layers of blankets piled on top of him. After making sure that the water was warm enough, Tony started with his feet and legs, washing the dirt and dried blood from Steve's skin while being very careful to not aggravate his severe injuries or the two IV lines running nourishing fluids into his veins. His left foot alone almost made Tony want to vomit, the limb so crushed and misshapen that he couldn't understand how Steve had even been able to stand, much less walk, as Peter had witnessed at the bunker.
"All right. I want you to circle around and get behind Sam. Pietro, I need you to be watching the skies. If you see any debris looking like it's heading for one of our teammates, you get them the hell out of the way, okay?"
"Nothing 'cept a giant blur," answered Uncle Sam. "Almost looked like a sharp gust of wind if you ask me."
"Uh huh," Peter said, his nose adorably scrunched as he finished grating the finely powdered spice. "Wow! This smells so yummy!"
"Yeah, it's just a hobby," Steve said quickly. He cleared his throat, well aware that his cheeks were about as red as his ma's favourite lipstick. "You know, just something to pass the time in the barracks."
"But I didn't," he continued. "As much as I hated to admit it, my shell was already starting to crack. Because I wasn't really living, Tony. I was simply just trying to survive.
"M-my name is B-b—" the man started, then erupted into a coughing fit that was so wet and disgusting that Steve literally felt his skin crawl, the sound bringing back way too many memories of soldiers choking on their own blood in the battlefield.
"We need to get going now, his O2 sats are only eighty-two percent," the second medic said. "I've already informed the hospital."
"Oh God, Pete, be careful!" Dad yelled as the wizard passed underneath the spinning, circular ship. Peter quickly shot another web, managed to latch it onto his back just as a wide, bright blue beam shot down from the ship, pulling the unconscious wizard up towards it.
Steve thought as his hand instinctively curled into a fist and his blood pressure went into a sudden freefall. He sucked in a deep breath, pointedly ignoring the look of concern Bucky was tossing at him as he stared at Anthony Stark's face, trying with all of his might not to glare so harshly that he drew Colonel Phillips's attention.
"Mr Stark," Dr Strange said with a sigh. "As I'm sure you are already aware, I would not have been able to help your son anyway, so this is really a moot point. However, this impending crisis with the stones is not, and therefore absolutely must take precedence at the moment."
"Oh my God," Peter whispered, rubbing his palms up and down his arms as his Spider Sense continued to go haywire. He had been
Tony waited three heartbeats before carefully placing his hand on Steve’s shoulder.  Steve flinched at Tony’s touch, but thankfully didn't try to jerk away, his entire body shuddering as Tony tightened his grip.
"That's better," Steve said. He reached for his coffee, giving his stomach a stern order to stand down for the time being.
“Mmm,” mutters Tony.  “You should probably try and sleep a little, yeah?  Let the serum go to work on you?”
"Fuck, I swear that accent of yours is gonna do me in one of these days," Tony said on a gasp as Steve's fingers curled around him again. "It's so fucking hot, baby, I can hardly take it!"
Anyway. Whoever had missed out on Steve before was now shit out of luck because Tony was not planning on giving him up anytime soon.
"I think… men who admitted that they were scared got called chicken shits," he muttered. "And I'm not, so—"
He wasn't whole.  He had gone through too much to likely ever be so again.  But now he knew without a doubt that he could still live a whole life.
"That's better," Tony said once he was finished, blotting at a drop on Steve's chin that had managed to escape. "Bruce said he'd be back in about an hour, so—"
It was yet another thing that Steve could empathise with. Possessing an eidetic memory had made it very easy for Steve to do well in school since he only had to read something once for it to become locked in his mind. It had also helped him greatly during his time with the Air Corps, allowing him to memorise flight manuals and briefing reports after only a single read-through.
"Oh my God!" Peter hissed, immediately clapping his hand over his mouth. "Liz's dad is one of the people trying to steal from Damage Control!"
Once he'd finished tying on his flight boots, Steve picked up his sketchbook and sat down on the edge of the bed, reaching for Tony's hand.
"Yeah, okay," muttered Tony, barely noticing her walking away as Steve handed him his paper, his lips pursed in anger.
“Oh, really?” said Tony.  “But isn't he the one who’s supposed to be getting some honour or award at the end of the month?  Isn't that the gala that you insisted that I find a date for, or you would find me one yourself?”
"Once we're able to immobilise Thanos, I will teleport Mantis down so she can put him to sleep, as she says," Dr Strange continued. "It will then be up to all of us to remove the gauntlet from Thanos' hand as soon as possible."
"You got it, babe," Tony said, his grin widening as Peter rolled his eyes just before his mask closed over his face. The kid may be seventeen now, but apparently he still thought his dads’ googly eyes were silly.
Steve smiled as he tore off a piece of his bread, dipping it into the rich tomato sauce in the pasta. "I'm not perfect, Tony."
"Um… but isn't he that one doctor that drove his car off a mountain?" Peter asked. He was only about a block away now, and still trying to wiggle out of his jeans after sending his hoodie and t-shirt flying a couple blocks back. "Oh my God, JARVIS, that one alien carrying the pickaxe thingy is humongous!"
"Yeah, bud, me too," Dad said softly. "But Uncle Bruce and I made a lot of progress today, so I'm really hoping that I'll be able to wrap this up tomorrow, or the next day at the latest." He shot a kind of half-amused, half-frustrated glance off to the side, leaning closer to his screen. "If Uncle Bruce had been better able to follow my directions earlier, things might not have been as bad as they were when I got here. But unfortunately, he unwittingly—"
Expanding the hologram, Tony quickly become so engrossed in his work that he didn't even realise Peter had entered the lab until he opened his mouth, nearly causing Tony to jump out of his skin.
"Dad, I'm fine," Peter said, muffled in Tony's chest. "It's the middle of the night, what's going on—?"
"Uh huh," Peter rasped, shuddering at the horrible sound of his voice. Thanks to Thanos' chokehold, his throat now felt like it had been rubbed with sandpaper, making him sound like he'd suddenly developed a three-pack-per-day smoking habit.
"That's good." Steve tilted his head, a slight smile on his full lips. "The new uniform performed perfectly, in case you're wondering."
"No!" Steve yelled as Doctor List stabbed him with the syringe, still struggling against Peter's ironclad grip as he tried to meet his son's eyes. "Oh God, what did you do to him? What did you do to my son?"
Resting his chin on his stack of books, Peter listened as Gwen launched into a monologue explaining that the goal of the Union had been to end the frequent and bloody wars between neighbouring countries that had culminated in the Second World War. As she continued on for the next five minutes or so, Peter closed his eyes, allowing the sound of her melodic voice to chip away at the massive load of fear and anxiety laying across his shoulders.
"Mmm," grumbled Steve. "Well, at least we don't have to worry about him catching pneumonia anymore."
"Ah, Tony?" he said, jerking his head towards Bucky, who was panting like he'd just run a marathon. "We good here now?"
They were quiet for several minutes, with Tony murmuring soft, soothing words and pressing gentle kisses along Steve's forehead and temple until he finally was able to release some of the iron grip on his body and attempt to relax.
"I called her this afternoon, before I met you for dinner." Steve sucked in a shaky breath, bringing Tony's hand to his lips. "Sweetheart, there's something really important that we need to discuss, and—I hope that you won't be upset with me, because I'm probably overstepping things here a bit, but—"
"Yeah," Peter said, awkwardly rubbing his nose. Dad had given him permission a long time ago to just take whatever equipment he needed from the Stark Industries stockrooms as long as it wasn't a prototype or on backorder or something, but since Pepper took over as CEO he had always asked her first before taking anything. He didn't want some poor stockroom person getting fired if the meticulous records that Pepper kept didn't balance out.
But somehow, as Peter slowly pulled on some clean clothes and ran his wet fingers through his unruly curls, he also had the sinking feeling that it was only a matter of time before the bill became law, and then—
"No, I wouldn't either," Tony muttered. "JARVIS, tell Pepper to get in touch with Human Resources and then call Beck to her office. And it might be a good idea to have Happy there too. Beck seemed a bit… unstable, so he's probably not going to take this news very well."
"Yeah, I do," replied Peter. He didn't bother to add that Dad had had this particular phone custom-made for him for his fifteenth birthday. "Dad gives them to me to field test before they're produced. I help him find bugs in the operating software, so—"
Peter's lips stretched into a smile without him even having to think. "Maybe. She's… definitely different."
Tony breathed in, his fingers curling around Steve’s dog tags through his shirt.  “Copy that.  I’ll keep ya in the loop.”
"Oh, and I'm thankful," continued Thanos, his grin widening into a leer. "Because now, I know what I must do. Once I locate that final stone, I will shred this universe down to its last atom. And then I will create a new one, teeming with life that knows not what it has lost, but only what it has been given. A grateful universe."
"Um, I hate to rush you, Cap," Sam said once they'd all ordered. "But we probably should start talking before these guys have too many beers."
"That'd be my guess too, Steve," added Bruce. "Which means that anyone who was killed in the battle before we go back probably won't be able to come back either. Only the people who were snapped."
"Of course I do. It was when you taught me how," Papa answered, his blue eyes twinkling as he studied the board, finally moving a pawn. He reached across to ruffle Peter's hair. "You've grown a bit since then, don't you think?"
"Carol would do it too, Tony, you know she would," Steve said. "She's told us some stuff, about what happened after Colonel Rhodes' accident, and… well… let's just say that I know she would do it."
Obie breathed in, smacking his lips.  “Are you absolutely sure about that?” he asked, so closely to Tony’s ear that Tony had to suppress a shiver.  “I'd hate for your math to be off.”
"Some of it," answered Bucky. "Bits and pieces. Стив helped fill in some of the blanks, and then Петр showed me a few pictures that helped a little."
"Well, shit, Tony," Clint said, all joking aside. "Yeah, Cap, we'll—we'll be fine. Long as you're sure you won't need all of us. I mean, have they caught any of the guys that set off the explosion yet?"
Steve begged, his hands fisting into the sheets as Tony moved to press wet kisses all along the length of him before finally taking him into his mouth. His vision nearly whited out as Tony practically swallowed him down, grunting as Steve wove his fingers through Tony's hair, careful not to press down too hard and choke him. Tony had told him not too long after they got engaged that he absolutely loved giving Steve blowjobs, loved to watch Steve's face as he lost all control and surrendered to the pleasure that he gave him. And while Steve could've also said the exact same thing about Tony, at the moment he was too lost in a hazy sea of sensation to form much more than a few muttered curses and some garbled attempts at Tony's name.
“Someone did notice, Dad,” he said quietly.  “And she was punished for it.  Maybe even with her life.”
But not today. Today, all Peter wanted was to cuddle with his beautiful girlfriend while they watched a movie about one of his very favourite fictional characters before she got on an airplane to fly halfway across the world early the next morning.
"I understand," Steve said. "And I agree. There's… there's a couple other things that I need to tell you as well."
"Mmm. Yeah, I've heard that about Wakanda," Tony said. "They're about as isolationist as they come. I used to hear Howard grumbling about them every now and then back in the day."
Tony grimaced as the ornate wooden doors opened into the Senate Armed Forces Committee's chambers, the nearly overwhelming smell of the place hitting him like a brick wall, a bad combination of old Cuban cigar smoke and verbal bullshit. He had always hated this particular room, the very same room where that old fucker Senator Stern had tried to drag him through the mud over three years ago, trying to force him into turning over his Iron Man armour to the government, or more specifically, to HYDRA. Nick Fury had accompanied Tony to those hearings, eventually proposing a deal with the Joint Chiefs that allowed Rhodey access to one armoured suit—aptly named War Machine—under the condition that he and only he would have access to it.
The thought came zooming out of nowhere, and Tony froze, trying to stuff it back down into the deep recesses of his mind before realising that it was like trying to stuff a piece of popped popcorn back into its kernel.
Because as much as Steve would like to think that he’s not ready for another relationship, deep down, in places so dark he would never dream of divulging them to anyone else, he’s actually so lonely that he can hardly bear it.  Day after day, night after night, he’s alone, with no one he can really talk to.  Natasha and Clint try, but even they have their own lives outside of work, and Steve suspects that a lot of aspects of those lives overlap, although he would never say anything to them about it.  But aside from the occasional brief conversation with his elderly landlord and with Sharon as she’s torturing him during his PT sessions, Steve doesn’t have anyone to confide in.
But Tony only shook his head, his brown eyes tormented behind their long eyelashes, like he was in pain. "JARVIS?" he said, clearing his throat. "Can you call Sam up here, please?"
"Sam said that they're doing everything Tony can think of to try and conserve Steve's oxygen," said Uncle Bucky. "The main thing they're worried about at the moment is that he's gonna get too cold, so—"
Of course, they still needed to actually get their hands on the tesseract, and Phillips still needed to inform the pilots that the mission they'd be undertaking would be placing them at very high risk for getting arrested for treason if something went wrong, but at the moment Tony didn't feel like thinking about all that. He was planning to program Peter's latest upgrades to JARVIS once the day's simulator sessions were complete, and as long as those worked—which they would, of that Tony had no doubt—then the pilots carrying out Project Phoenix would be as well-protected and well-prepared as Tony and Colonel Phillips could get them.
"And I respectfully decline," Howard stated. "As I just stated, my son is still recovering from surgery and in case you hadn't noticed, we are currently in the middle of a blackout."
"I'm pretty sure I could never turn down an invitation like that," Steve answered, smiling as he pecked Tony on the nose. "Especially since the fella doing the asking is as handsome as you."
"Yes, sir," Steve said just before he claimed Tony's lips. He moaned into the kiss as Tony's hands glided down his bare back to his ass, squeezing it as he slid his arm underneath Tony's knees to pick him up and place him on the bed.
“Yeah, well, maybe that’s what you need to finish up that missile ahead of schedule, yeah?” Obie shot back.  He shuffled over to the Scotch bottle he kept in Tony’s office, pouring himself another double-shot.  “‘Cause it seems like I’ve gotta light a fire under you to get you to do anything lately.”
Peter's heart started to thud as Thanos stepped away from the vanishing portal, his rather small, beady eyes scanning the area. Given the dude's size, which was considerable, Peter estimated that he was at least as strong as Hulk. Which, based on what Uncle Bruce had told Peter about Hulk's fight against Abomination, was definitely
Steve felt his jaw tighten and his hands clench into fists. He may not be as smart as either Anthony or Peter Stark, but he did have access to some information and databases that he may be able to use to help them as long as they allowed it. He would have to tread very carefully, for his own sake as well as for Anthony and Peter's. Steve was well-liked by both his immediate superiors in the Air Corps and the government leaders, but he also knew that any regard the government held him in was conditional upon his complete obedience and could be withdrawn at only the slightest provocation.
A few minutes later Peter arrived at an overpass overlooking an alley where an old, beat-up van was parked with its back doors hanging open, a series of what looked like very hi-tech rifles and guns on display. Three men stood by the van, all talking too quietly for Peter to hear, but who appeared to be waiting for a potential buyer to show up. Peter quickly snapped a few pictures of the men to analyse later, then securely tucked his phone and continued to wait, tapping his fingers impatiently against his leg. Waiting had never been one of his strong suits.
And she had only mentioned the boy's father, so did that mean he didn't have a mom? Or that the mom wasn't involved?
"Elsewhere for a means of conversion," Peter murmured, swiping his hand across his freezing cold nose. "So that has to mean that they never got their hands on more of the Aminacin." Dad had told Peter that Director Fury had confiscated and destroyed Killian's entire supply of the drug when the Miami bunker was raided, and while Peter knew that Director Fury often said one thing and did another, maybe this was evidence that he did actually destroy the stuff.
"Hello?" Peter yelled, slapping his palms hard against the transparent wall, cringing as the pounding in his head ramped back up to an almost unbearable level. "Hello? Is anyone out there?"
Peter nodded, forcing himself to take small sips to keep from choking. "Thank you," he said once he was done. "I think… I think I'd like to take a nap now."
As Helen wheeled Steve into position, Tony and Peter took their places at his sides, each holding onto one of his hands. The surgeon had the typical bedside manner of most of the surgeons that Tony had met, but absolutely lived up to Helen's recommendation, working quickly and effectively while answering almost all of Peter's never-ending questions.
"Huh?" Peter asked, confused. "No, he named me Peter. I named me Spider-Man. It's my superhero name, just like yours is Star-Lord."
"That's right, Captain. Just with us," said Fury. "King T'Challa was quite impressed with your team when you spoke down in Namibia, but given the incursion that followed and the people who were behind that incursion, he's at the moment reluctant to extend that diplomatic relationship to the entire country until the United States can assure him without hesitation that all of HYDRA's agents and interests have been completely purged."
try and bring that up right now, Steve," he warned, his voice rising with every word. He got to his feet, curling his fingers around his left arm as he started pacing back and forth. "Don't you
With a tentative smile Tony took Steve's hand, a shock of warmth sparking inside his chest when Steve's warm fingers closed around his.
"No, no, let's not do that," Tony said with an emphatic shake of his head. "No need to be emphasising the Stark part."
Steve blinked, searching through his foggy brain for any previous reference to a Doctor List or a Wanda Maximoff, and coming up empty.
He also wonders if that doctor even remembers saying that to Steve and his ma.  Or, if he does, if he’s ever seen any of his races.  Steve definitely looks quite a bit different now than he did back then, back when he was a tiny twelve-year-old kid with a barrel chest, stick-like limbs, and a complexion a lovely shade of greyish-blue, so it’s quite possible that the doctor wouldn't even recognise Steve now if he saw him.
“Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,” he hisses as he bends his elbow and slowly raises his left arm above his head, twisting his palm to and fro once it’s in place, just like Sharon taught him.  He gasps when the pain spikes as he starts to lower it, squeezing his eyes closed and breathing deeply through his nose as he tries to not let the pain defeat him.  He repeats the motion two more times before deciding that that’s enough for the time being, setting an alarm on his phone to remind him to do it again after lunch.
