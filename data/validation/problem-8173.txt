his Tony didn't think anything like this. Because, selfishly, that meant that all this time Tony had been buckling under the weight of the world, and Steve had never seen.
"'Fraid not," is the answer.
"Well, I'm willing to bet there's something in there I can sue you for. Don't ask me what, that's why I have lawyers, and they're good, Stone."
“I – well, to tell the truth, it’s a bit fuzzy, but I think we might be under attack by an alien force. I know my team can fight them back no matter what, but I need to be by their side.”
Tony's jaw tenses but its still doesn't stop the harsh words that erupt from him. "Oh, for fuck's sake, T'Challa, look at me. This isn't Siberia, I haven't been chasing after my team for three days, my best friend hasn't just been paralyzed, and I didn't just learn I've been lied to and betrayed by a man I trusted for the guy who murdered my parents. I'm not going to go blasting off body parts again."
"No, sir, all active Avengers are in Libyan airspace. Can you count these new people?"
'You'd better,' Bucky would say. 'I ain't spending the night in a tree, not even for you, punk.' Even though he would, and he had. Bucky was always there for Steve, and Steve had always let him down.
Tony and Rhodey watch her go, his friend with more than a little wistfulness on his face. Tony sighs. "Honey-bear, I'm not keeping you locked up here. You wanna go, then-"
To that, Tony can only shrug. "Personal experience here: the two are not mutually exclusive. This is the job. Save everyone you can. And when you can't, try harder."
Loki didn't finish as the door to the room suddenly opened, silencing him. Toni glanced at the familiar looking nurse entering into the room before turning back to Loki, worried that the nurse saw him; however, she was alone in the room. She didn't know how he did it, but he was gone as if he was never there in the first place. Though he annoyed her to no end and was a massive murderer, she didn't want him to go as he was a connection to the future. Also, he was up to something and she wanted to figure out what.
Author Note:
"Yes, you should have, but I'll deal with it," Pepper replied. "But you owe me."
First of all, I am a horrible author. This chapter took me forever to write. Two months write the chapter itself and the about three weeks for the proofing. I don't why it took me soo long, though life happens. Crap and more crap. And even more crap.
Bucky closes his eyes for a few seconds, taking a few breaths, as he realizes that this conversion has turned dangerous. "Come on, Dollface. Let's get you back to bed," he says, his voice soft. "Please, Tony…" he begs as the genius doesn't turn to face them and remains deadly quiet. "I'm sorry. Please." His expression is nervous as he stares at Tony's back. "I just…I am…I…I worry. I can't lose you. I can't. Not after…"
Before Fury could respond or even crack a smile, everything went to hell in a hand bag, and that was putting it lightly. It was like everyone was screaming at once, while she was trying to listen to a guy across the room. You could probably add like crazy, barking dogs to mix. That was how it felt, like everything happening at once, and Toni's mind couldn't focus.
A part of her didn't want him to change. She wanted him to stay the same tiny Steve, but it wasn't her choice. What she wanted didn't matter. The world needed the Asshole, and no matter how attached (a fact that she hated and would deny) she was to the Shrimp, Toni Stark did not need him. She liked him but she did
"Ssh," he hushed, but he was smirking.
Toni snorted. "There is no goodness in your heart."
"Really? Bucky just died and you're asking me that?" she asked.
"Agent," Phillips replied. "Have you two been getting along?"
him. No, it wasn't the first time she had heard those words, but those proposals weren't real. Maybe, they were in some sense, but they were just jokes—sex crave proposals clouded by hormones. They were nothing, and Toni could laugh it off while leaving the man in the dust without any regrets. Those guys (and the random girl) were nothing. Steve was
With everything that the blond had just seen and the nasty conversion that they had the day prior, Toni was amazed that Sharon could be this friendly. Was Sharon a better person? It made her wonder if they could've been friends all those years ago…well that was if they could've stopped competing. For some reason, they always fought for Aunt Peg's attention. "The Original is my bread and butter, but I can't hate on the Next Generation." She said, taking the woman's hand. It was odd how the pieces of life fell into place.
Steve looked up, slowly, and gave Toni a devilish grin. "This is funny?" he asked, his lips curled.
Toni's head was fuzzy and she couldn't make out heads or tails of what was going on. She could tell they were on the move but all she could hear was distant voices, and there were a lot of voices, most of them were unknown to her. At first it scared her, not knowing who these voices belonged to, but she heard a familiar man's voice. His voice calmed her and she knew she was safe. She didn't know what about his voice calmed her, but it did. So the more he talked, the better. While resting in someone's arms listening to him (she wasn't sure if it was him holding her), she allowed herself to drift. As she rested, her mind was becoming less fuzzy, and she was able to make out what was going on around her.
"I knew you were trouble," was Peggy response.
JARVIS may have told Steve exactly where Toni was, but he didn't need the AI to tell him. He knew exactly where she would be as there was only one place that the genius felt at home: her lab. There was no denying that it was her safe haven, the first place that she ran to, whenever the need arose. For her, it was where she felt like herself, and for everyone else, it was the Pentagon, the hardest place for anyone to be invited. She guarded it like nothing else, building high walls to protect it.
As if his advice was for her, Toni took a few deep breaths, racking her brain for the right thing to say. In these situations, she never knew what to say and always had the habit of saying the wrong thing. Steve could attest to that as could…Bucky.
Toni was shocked by the coldness in his voice, and it stunned her for a few seconds. It was a struggle to find her words, but she refused to be silenced by him, even if she had no idea of what to say. "Excuse me?" she said. "You did not-"
Director Fury was pissed. He was always pissed, but at this point, he was royally pissed, and everyone knew it. Anyone who had any common sense stayed as far away from him as possible, and that was hard since they were in a base flying in the air. One of his SHIELD bases had been broken into and they had no idea who or how. The security system had to have been hacked, because there was no record of any unauthorized entry, and there had been one. None of his techs had been able to figure out how, and that really pissed him off. No one stole from him and got away with it.
However, Tony isn't one to back down from a challenge, and he's willing to face it head on, even if he's shattering on the inside. He shakes his head and pushes farther away from them. Even if he isn't looking directly at them, he can see the shock and surprise on their faces as he pushes away. "I don't need nor want you guys to play
Shaking her head, Toni pushed herself up by her elbows. Even with the rest, she could feel her worn-out body fight her. Her body shock, but she pushed through them. She needed to figure out where she was and what was going on. She also needed to check her reactor to make sure it was working properly, though if it wasn't she would be dead.
"Yup, we're best friends," Toni responded. She could feel his eyes on her, and she did her best not to pay any attention. "We're already giggling about nails and boys."
If possible, it looked like the Howling Commando was getting older and older with each passing second. As Toni eyed him, she knew the answer to her question and she felt sick. "He's dead."
He eyed the armor before he glanced down at Toni, who looked tiny in that oversize coat. There was a part of him that wondered where she had gotten the coat, but he was grateful she had something to wrap herself in. It was cold, and it provided some kind of protection for her. In her hands, she held a journal and an old letter, and he could see the death grip she had on them. He didn't know what was written on them, but he knew it had to mean something for her hold on them so tightly.
Carter was glaring at her. "I think you're jealous."
"Well you are," Barton says.
Toni glanced around the room, looking for something that could help her, but she knew there wouldn't be anything. They had underestimated her the first time and she knew they weren't taking any chances now. They had locked her into a 10 by 8 ft. room and made sure that there was nothing in her arm's reach or even in the room that she could use. Across from her was a police style window, where she couldn't see through but they could see her. That pissed her off. She had been sitting in this freezing room with dim lights for hours, or what seemed like days, as they watched her. She knew they were waiting to see if they could break her, which was impossible. She wouldn't say anything.
Okay, she knew how; it was his personality and his innocence that got him noticed by the Dr. Erskine. Even now, she could see how kind and sweet he was (oh, it did make her sick a little) just by looking into his eyes, his beautiful eyes. Did I just refer to his eyes as beautiful? What's going on with me? Whatever it was, she didn't care for it one bit. She was Toni F-ing Stark and she did not compliment people unless they were Pepper or Rhodey and she really didn't compliment Steve Rogers.
"Thank you," Steve said, interrupting the brunette. There was a huge smile on his face, and it was so blinding that it could land planes.
to believe this, because he had to. Toni being dead was not possible, because without her, he didn't know who he was. He didn't know what to do without her. She was his true North, his rock, who kept him steady. Sure, he could handle whatever life had for him, but she kept him sane, even if she wasn't. She kept him upright and on this toes. She had been there for as long as he could remember, and the idea that she was gone scared him.
Toni gave him the side eye before returning to Barnes' smiling face. He looked peaceful in that picture, extremely happy, and Toni couldn't help but wonder how many days the photo was taken before his death.
"I don't know anything about that," Toni said, smiling faintly. "It would do no good to talk about it." She didn't want to talk about it as she didn't want to relive it. "I have nothing to talk about." She stared off into space.
"Why can't I just care? I would like to think that we've become friends," he replied, not moving from his spot.
"T-Toni," Maya muttered, sweating and visibly shaking, as she tried to crawl her way to Toni. "I a-a..."
"He'll be back. Just taking Pepper to the airport," Toni replied, stepping to Clint. "I'm not looking forward to that lecture, but they can't be as bad as Rogers'." She said with a smile as she grabbed Barton by the shoulder.
Fury may not like her on her worse day or any day, even when she tried, but he would never do this…However, Fury was dead. She had watched as he was brought in covered in blood. She had watched him take his last breath as the doctors did everything that they could to save him. She had watched as Hill and Romanoff's world shattered in front of them. Fury, though Toni could not stand the man half the time, was more than just a master spy to them or anyone. He was a dark hero, who was willing do whatever it took. Though his ways may be unethically, someone had to do it and he was willing.
"Steve."
"He gave Fury some long stupid reason," She answered. "It doesn't matter why. It doesn't change the fact that he couldn't, which means we need that device to work, Banner."
He narrowed his eyes at her before he chuckled. "Well, we wouldn't want that."
"Oh, yes, we do," Rogers replies, as he runs a finger gently over Tony's cheek. "He never-"
"Yes," he uttered.
She took a step back as she narrowed her eyes. "What are you talking about, Barniez Boy?"
*O*O*
"I don't have germs! I pay those doctors too much for that." She winked.
"I understand," Steve replied, resigned to agree. It would be pointless to fight as it was clear they couldn't change their minds. "When do we head out?"
The weapon expert turned to Phillips, who staring at him with a smirk. "I've been with so many petty dames that it's hard to remember all of them," he joked back.
Toni eyed Sam Wilson, taking him in. She watched him as he ended the meeting and said bye to each person individually. He was skillful with his movements, only touching certain vets; however, there was a solid connection with each of them, giving that veteran the link that they needed. It was probably the expression on his face that made it. There wasn't an ounce of pity or judgment in the man's eye. There wasn't an ounce of anything besides compassion. In rare form, this man just cared. There was no secret conspiracy plot. No treachery. He was just to be here because he cared. It was refreshing but weird. It was such a difference compared to everyone else she had met. It was-
Chuckling, Steve stepped to Toni and softly pulled her into his arms. He enjoyed the feeling of having in her arms, knowing she was his. With a great smile, he placed the kissed to her head. "Let's get you back to the Tower."
"Why don't you just kill me already?" she asked, her throat dry and itchy. Her hands were shaking.
"I know," Rogers replies, his tone uneven. "I know."
"Well…it does eventually lead me to you, so no matter what, it gives me the most important thing in my life," he said, leaning back.
Suddenly, Rollins groaned besides her, reminding her that he was here. "Mmmm."
"But you can't say that you aren't attracted to Sergeant Barnes. I've seen the way you look at him."
Steve and the Wonder Twins (a nickname that they hated) were in DC doing Shield things that they wouldn't tell her about, which annoyed the hell out of her. One, she hated to be out of the loop. Maybe, she could hack her way into Shield? Two, it felt like Fury was trying to steal her boyfriend and keep him away from her, like he was jealous or something. Like really! He called at all hours of the night, expecting him to jump without question and never allowing him to rest. Each time, Toni had to hold her tongue, which was battle, in order not to the say the first thing that popped in her head. Being rather nasty, she chained it back, trapping it in her throat, and in doing so, she held back what she was feeling. Feeling left in the cold. She refused to let anyone would know this.
The unlocked door.
He picked up the pencil again to add streets signs and other small details, but he dropped it a second later when he realized where he was. This ugly building was located in the same spot that he had found Toni bloody and injured, calling out for help. This was where it all happened. This was the spot that she traveled back in time, though there was no way to tell if this was when she did so.
night?" she asks.
Again, let me know what you think.
Tony doesn't go to movie night, and no one comes down to get him. He doesn't know if that's a good or bad thing. He decides it's for the best anyhow. He needs to distance himself, because those three little words are haunting him. He's glad that he hasn't said those words yet, as this would've been so worse if he did… Though he wonders if it really will be, as he already feels like shit and an idiot for thinking this could work. He should've known better.
Toni would've snorted if she could've mustered it. "You and your men had already," she coughed out. Her throat was starting to hurt from all of the talking. When Schmidt reached down to her chains, she almost flipped out of her chair, scared. "W-What are you doing?" she shuttering, annoying herself. She hated how weak she sounded.
Toni let out a harsh sigh.
"As I always do," JARVIS replied.
That pissed her off. Wasn't just her father? Did he think he had a right to her father? Sure, she didn't want him, but that didn't mean she wanted to share him with an ass. She was inching to go in there and punch him in his face, even though she knew that wasn't a good idea. She didn't need to break her already burnt hand.
Barnes took a seat at the table and picked up the newspapers. "Nope, but what she doesn't know can't hurt her." Even though her back was to him, she knew he was smiling.
Toni eyed the device, her only way home. It made her nervous to see him handle the device when the core was acting up and sparking. "So what's this theory of yours?" she asked, reaching for the device in Howard's hand.
With a look on his face that Toni couldn't quite read, he said, sadly, "Alright, Sam, duty calls. Thanks for the run. If that's what you wanna call running."
With her struggling breaths, she needed space. She needed air. She needed to find somewhere safe. In her mind, that place was Steve, but he wasn't here, and she had no one to blame besides herself. She was keeping him back to protect him, but it did nothing for her. Her heart was racing as she picked up speed, though it didn't seem to help. She was still struggling to keep her head on her shoulders.
, they were trying to take her from them, the Avengers.
The idea of sitting out didn't sit well with Steve. "If it gets to the point that I'm jeopardizing a mission, I'll be the first to point that out and I'll sit myself out."
Ouch, Toni thought as she wanted to leap out the bed and attack the unnamed nurse. No one insulted Toni Stark and got away with it, but…right now, she had no choice. She had to take it as she was handcuffed to the bed…and no, it wasn't as fun as the last time she was handcuffed to a bed.
She narrowed her eyes at him. "What's with my face?" she asked. "I think my face is just fine! Thank you!" Her voice carried, making a few heads turn. Blood pooled in her cheeks as she felt eyes on her. Barnes laughed, making her turn away. She tried to calm down by distracting herself by the people on the streets. Just when she was about to turn back, she noticed someone on the corner.
in front of the window. She should be dead, but yet, here she was. There was only one reason why she wasn't hit, and that went back to the shooter. Besides being a super soldier with a metal arm, the man was an expert level sniper. He had to be a world class sniper… who wanted her. "Not surprising. Maybe, you should let me at it."
"Yes, caring."
With that, Toni felt sick. "You don't need to worry about me. I'll be gone soon," she replied, thinking back to what her father had said by using the Tesseract. He might've been on to something, as the Tesseract could open portals, which was what time travel was. "Besides, I'm not the only one in pain. How are you, Peggy?"
She barely felt Steve giving her a smiling kiss to her lips or when he turned from her. She didn't even recall him heading toward the quinnjet as she was focused on his words. She wasn't sure if he was upset by her lack of respond or what, but he didn't say anything and Toni wasn't sure what her respond would be. She took a deep breath as she shook her head and headed toward the lab. She needed her suits to clear her mind.
"Not now, Clint," Natasha replied as she kicked a man's legs out from underneath him, sending him to the ground hard.
Toni had no idea why she was acting like this, but her emotional self was pissing her off. She kept telling herself to grow a pair because she couldn't deal with these emotions anymore.
While glancing toward her father (who was a horrible supervisor), she pulled out her smart phone, which she had repurposed again. It had taken some time to convince Salty to give it back, but she was able to sweet talk him. Similar to before, it was a scanner and she could do a full diagnostic on any device. Though it wouldn't be as thorough as if Jarvis did it, it gave her some idea of what was wrong with it. Yes, the purpose of the device was to suck power, but it wasn't supposed to spit it back out with so much force.
"Just don't touch me," she replied, looking over to her father, who placed down his wretch and took a step toward them. There was a look of protectiveness on his face as he stared at them. It was an odd expression to see on his face directed towards her.
"Then you'll both end up in the brig," he smiled. "Unless you-"
Lastly
she thought.
She had screwed herself, and she knew it. However, she wasn't the one to admit her screw ups.
His eye brow rose. "What is a Borg?"
Clint looked between the two. "For now."
Steve gave her a crooked smile as he put his arm around her, drawing her in. "I don't know about that. You look like walking death."
She had a lot of questions. He didn't like questions. "Thor is looking at this as a chance of redemption for his brother." He took a pause to breathe. "He does, however, understand that this is a risk."
She gives him a look. "So what's with the mood? Why are you being a teenage girl?"
Rhodes' face turns cold as he stares down the Captain. "Rogers, no," he says, unkindly. "I got him. You don't need to worry." Jim narrows his eyes between the two, almost daring them. "Why don't you two go sit down?"
But Here you go. I hope you like it. :)
Toni snickered as she leaned against the Captain. "Success."
Toni's eye twitched. She did not belong to Barnes. "Well to any girls," she clarified as she took another slip. "Maybe, you can teach these two!"
"If you aren't talking to Rogers, then talk to me," he replied, unable to mask the bitterness in his tone when he said Steve's name. "Lean on me."
"I'm not sensitive!" She yelled with her arms folded across her chest. She was
*O*O*
"I'm sending the 107 in and I want to make sure I'm not sending them in to be slaughtered."
*O*O*
"Impossible, Tashie. No beats me." Toni let out a chuckling sigh as she dropped down to her knees, reaching back into the box. With a deep breath, she reached into the box, as she wondered where these bulbs came from. They didn't look new, but she hadn't seen these decorations before; however, that wasn't saying much. She owned a lot of things she didn't know about. "Why don't we decorate this stupid green thing?"
"Hey, wait." Pepper turned back to Steve. "How did you get into a fight with her? She's in her lab and she isn't coming out." She stared him down like no one else could do. "And that would explain the music." She rubbed her ears.
He leaned forward as his hands twitched in his lap. "…Feeling guilty?" She didn't answer him as she started at his hands. "I know the feeling. It's the feeling I get each time I make a new weapon. Sure, I feel excitement for creating something new, but guilt follows as I wonder if I just signed someone's death certificate. I know I'm going this to save lives, but it's
"I'm already fielded calls from the Board, Toni," Pepper said, aggravated.
When she caught up to the super soldier, he was at a long window, which overlooked the city, in her bedroom. The room itself was dark with the light of moon (and city lights) providing the only light. Barely able to make him out in the darkness, she stared at the back of him for a second before she crossed to him. There was a glare- a playful glare- in her eyes as she stomped to him. "You!" She yelled; however, it died in her throat. When she got to him, she noticed he had rotated and was on his knee…on one knee. Her playful anger froze as she looked at him. Shock took over.
However, would there a point? She was stuck in this cell, and there was no way she could get out unless someone let her out. Was it worth it to try to escape? The colonel had already proven that she was predictable and he knew what she would do. If she did get pass Salty, how would she get back to the future? She had no idea of how her device even sent her to the past.
"You aren't sure and
Pepper threw her arms up in annoyance, unable to believe what was going on. How could they lose both Steve and Toni in the same day? What else could happen? The sky start falling?
"Hey," he said, playing hurt. "My cooking isn't bad. Now, yours on the other hand." Though the circumstances might not be the best, jokes and teasing was how he was going to get Toni back to normal…if there was a normal. If Natasha was correct—not that she was ever wrong, it was going to be a battle unlike any that he had faced before.
Steve hovered over her for a few more seconds, running his hands up and down her side one last time. "Okay, Okay," he said, sounding relieved not finding any injuries. "Stay down. I'm going to check on Fury." His hands lingered on her a few more seconds before he rolled off her and made his way to Fury. He kept low to ground, turning completely into Captain America. A man in charge.
And I couldn't help but use Trip. I loved him and I dislike Agent of Shields for killing him.
He flinched back, flashing back to their fight in the lab. She had used that word as an insult, and it hurt to hear her call him that now. Was she insulting him again? Yes, he said he wouldn't give up, but he didn't know if he could take
"Unfortunately," Toni whined with a pout.
to settle her mind, or else she would torture herself. However, the second she looked back down was the second that Toni lost her footing on the muddy, uneven ground and tripped. Tumbling forward, Toni could feel her ankle twist as she plummeted, landing face first into the wet, muddy ground. She laid there covered in mud for a few second as pain shot up her leg.
"Dude, there's nothing to eat this in kitchen!" Barton cries.
Toni let out a soft, painful whine, as she slowly lifted her head. "Why?" she asked, her voice cracking, as she focused on the shadow in the corner of the apartment. "Why?"
Having woken up early to do something, Steve returned a couple of hours later to find Bucky once again sitting at the table staring at him. In front of him was today's newspaper, which was opened to some war article. Steve stared at the picture with the same old desire of joining the army and helping his country but no one wanted him.
"Miss Stark's words were, 'Let's make him walk, because again, sharing is not caring, and I don't share well.'" The AI replied.
Toni knew she had that problem, knew she couldn't turn off her brain. It was always turning, always shooting out items no matter the time or subject. Her mind overthought
"Don't get any ideas," Jones said to Falsworth with a laugh. "Barnes will hurt you."
seen something, relived something in that camp. He knew the face, knew it personally. He had spent countless restless nights and quiet moments, drowning in sweat and panic, and he spent these moments alone. There was no one he wanted to burden with it, even others wanted him to. Besides, he was Captain America. He wasn't supposed to be weak, wasn't supposed to panic. He wasn't supposed to suffer from PTSD.
Sharon was determined and didn't let the conversion dropped. "That's not an answer. Do you love him?"
Steve stepped toward the brunette, who a step back for each step the blond took to her. "Then show me."
Steve didn't waste any time as he took the head set from her and put it on. He could feel every eye on him as Natasha unmuted the comm. "Rhodes?" he spoke into the mic. "Is everything okay? Did something happen?" He didn't like being this far away from Toni, unable to see her daily. Unable to talk to her. He hated the radio silence required for SHEID missions, especially when she was struggling with her guilt. If there was a way he could go back in time and fix it, he would, even if it meant losing her.
Wanda pushes herself up on the sofa, wearing a slight smile as she looks up at the Archer. Clint is one of her favorite Avenger, and her mood is always better when he's around. "What about a Disney movie?" she asks, her accent thick. Even with the amount of times she spends with them, her accent has not disappeared.
The Asset had no idea as to why he had to watch her and let her to see him every now and then, but he didn't ask, just wondered. He wondered why he wasn't supposed to let anyone else see him, wasn't supposed to be noticed by anyone besides her. Even if he didn't see the point of it, he supposed it was to get inside her mind and fuck with it, and he would do it whatever he was ordered to. Besides, he did understand the purpose of getting inside someone's mind, but he didn't understand why he—their best weapon—was sent to get inside her head. This was not what he was designed for, not what he was good for. He wasn't supposed to just watch. This wasn't what he was made for, wasn't what he was created for.
"Oh," Steve muttered. "Why didn't you just say that?" His face slowly returned to its normal color.
Anyhow, here you go. Let me know what you think.
"That might be fun."
Unable to control herself, she opened her mouth. "Repeating your promise won't help! That's what all of the bad guys say before they kill you." She glared before turning to Zola who was staring at the ground. How dare he not look at her when she was held hostage? If he was going to do this, he was going to look at her.
"Oh, so you will let me help?" Howard asked, eyeing Toni as he let her go.
"Toni,
And I want to give a special thanks to wintersupersoldiers who has proofed this for me. :) She is great.
"You know, I tried to talk him into taking me to a homeless shelter but it didn't work," she shrugged. "He just brought me here instead."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Miss Stark revoked your access 4.2 hours ago," JARVIS answered.
Letting out another sigh, Bruce held the reactor in his hands and just stared at it. "I see you're wearing dog tags."
"Yea, but you distracted me!" She stared pointing at him.
"I see, but if you don't mind, I need to see Phillips," she said, having no interest in talking to Jones or anyone. It was too much work to be a smartass when she was a wreck on the inside.
At first, Toni assumed it was an EMP, which didn't worry her too much. Knowing that would be the first thing her enemies would throw at her, she had made an EMP shield—though she had not tested it against every EMP yet. There was no telling if this was one that could overpower it, but that wasn't important here. This grenade was so much more than an EMP, not that she had time to ponder that. One second it was quiet and the next, all hell broke loose. In a blink of an eye, a loud piecing scream rung through the Iron Man speaker like an hurricane. If JARVIS was talking to her, she wouldn't know. She couldn't hear anything besides the earsplitting shriek, which made her want to rip her ears out.
*O*O*
was responding. At this point, everything was blending together, and black spots danced across her vision, making her wonder if she was going blind. "JARVIS," she called again. But like before, nothing happened, and Toni was left wondering if she was dead.
Bruce, who was taking deep breaths, sighed. "I still don't see how Captain America is a national security risk," he said in annoyance. "And I would agree with Clint. I might have to reintroduce SHIELD to the big guy." He wasn't joking, and this tone told everyone this.
Toni stared at the nurse trying to remember where she met her from, but she couldn't place it. "I don't need any more beauty sleep," she teased, her throat killing her. Eyeing a glass of water on the dresser, she reached for it, but her hand shook. Feeling embarrassed, she retracted it.
The Colonel let out a sigh before he turned back to Toni. "Toni, you've been running yourself into the ground, and you need to realize this. You need to understand that you aren't immortal, that you're human."
"No," he says, trying to be as small as possible. "Why don't we watch the movie? Please."
Toni looked him. "Why are you looking for me?" She didn't want to talk about it, because no one understood.
"I know." He looked hurt by her use of his last name. "Did you tell Bucky about your nightmares?" he asked.
, and he isn't giving that up. Not for anyone. It's the one true thing in his life.
"How did I get on the couch?" he asks, getting to his feet. He pays no attention to the blanket as he pushes himself up.
Toni glanced over at Peggy, who was staring at her. "I asked him, but he's worried that I'm too injured or I'll get hurt." She snorted. "I so want to take a wrench to him."
Worst of all, her panic had started to disappear, and she started to forget why she was scared in the first place. Why was she fighting if her pain was gone? She was free and was no longer scared, so why was she fighting? If she just let go, she would be able to rest. She would be freed of the worry and stress of being alive…wait, why was she feeling this way? She shouldn't be feeling like this. She should be fighting…but she didn't have the urge to. Why? Because she was… Wait, what was her name? She couldn't remember. Why was she here? The last thing she-
Pepper's eyes widened because there was only one person who could've done that, and that was Toni. Yes, Toni loathed Rhodes touching her personal suits, but she wasn't a dick enough to do it while he was piloting the suit…okay, she would, but not in a middle of a mission, and if Toni did, Pepper knew that Bruce and Trip were right. Toni was drowning.
… Fond of? Cherishes? Likes? Tony isn't sure, but he won't call it love. That's impossible. Tony Stark does
"I was Stark's secretary at one point. It was my job to know everything about her," Romanoff, who always sounded annoyed, stated more irritated than usually.
Peggy raised an eye brow. "What's so funny?"
"No, I don't," Bruce responded as he crossed to her. "Are you okay, Toni?"
He knew he had to get to her, before someone got to her.
"Do you want to talk about the kiss?"
"You and that ridiculous nickname." Phillips stared at her for a few seconds, before he turned to Rogers. "I have something to discuss with the both of you. Come with me," he stated as he waved for them to follow.
"It isn't a big deal which time period she is in, if I can't get this thing to work," he said as he crossed back to the device, that couldn't hold power at all.
He was so willing to ask JARVIS for advice but the fear of Steve overhearing halted his actions.
"Hey, sleepy pie, your milk's ready. You want it, don't you?" His voice ever so tender. The boy nodded his head lazily and Tony tested the warmth of the milk on his wrist, as he'd seen Steve do numerous times. When he was sure the milk wouldn't burn the kid, he guided the tip of the bottle to Peter's mouth, who instinctively took it and started drinking.
Both Tony and Peter had the same expression of glee on their face as Tony led them in. Tony waved at the girl on the counter who greeted them. "Hey, Cindy. How're you doing?"
Tony pulled away and saw Steve's face. The man's face was still red, eyes looked better than when he arrived however.
"You mean this one?" Pepper pulled Tony's sleeve back enough to show the watch still around his wrist.
Peter nodded and Tony lowered him to float on the water. At first, Peter was quiet, looking at the water around and the fact the he wasn't going into it, under it. Then he reached to touch the water with his hand. When he saw his hand wet, he looked at Tony and smiled widely. Tony smiled as brightly. "There you go! You're in the pool!"
Tony shook his head. "I keep looking at you and keep thinking of all these words that are all over the place and I don't know if you know that. Like, yes, I've said stuff. It's quite hard to resist complimenting you. But, like, have I ever told you, like really told you-"
"I'm regretting that now." Tony murmured, closing the door behind him. He turned on the shower, getting the water to be just the right temperature. He scrubbed his hair with a little more determination than normal, he couldn't shake Pepper's earlier comment about it and in no way was he meeting up with a man like Steve with anything about him looking anything less than classy.
Steve nipped at Tony's chin and Tony laughed, trying to pull away unsuccessfully as Steve just wouldn't let go. Steve twirled with Tony in his arms and Tony moved along with him, floating. The smile just wouldn't leave Tony's face.
"-Doesn't mean I can snoop around. I know, Pep. I get it. Trust me."
"Hey, ready for bed, bud?" He caressed Peter's cheeks softly. When Peter cuddled further into Tony, the man picked him up and went to the bathroom. He made sure Peter did everything Steve's orders concerning the bathroom had asked of him. Then he carried the sleepy body to his bedroom where he had brought in Peter's bag. He pulled out his pj's, a cute light green onesie with small turtles all over it. It was a struggle to get it on Peter after having to remove the clothes he already had on when Peter wasn't doing much to help.
No, he was not stalking, this was research.
"Too expensive."
Steve looked into Tony's eyes, not pulling back so that was good. Tony need that physical contact. Steve swallowed, blinking hard. Tony could feel his heart beating furiously. Steve finally opened his mouth.
"Not that I mind the view or anything but shouldn't you be wearing a shirt or something while cooking? I mean, even I know that."
"A beautiful mess."
"I thought we could spend the day together here since I knew it was your day off. But maybe we could go out, for ice cream, for a walk, for Disney World. Whatever will cheer you up."
They sat quiet there on the kitchen floor, side by side. Tony held Steve's hand, entangling their fingers together and bringing it up to kiss his knuckles.
Steve smiled, all shy. His pupils dilated, his cheeks pink, lips pulp. "I'll say."
Steve came from around the corner, his phone now in his hand. "It was Bucky. Calling to update on Peter."
"Doesn't sound like a bad idea. What was that you said about him flapping his arms?"
Peter whispered again in the same way, Steve face immensely amused. He nodded and and turned to Tony, who was trying not to smile at the interaction. "Would you play Brother Bear for him?"
Pepper rolled her eyes and switched on her tablet. "You need to keep a low profile in front of the daycare if you don't want people to know about your contribution. I hope they warn us about the back entrance being locked down next time. It's absurd."
"Absolutely nothing at all?" Peter shook his head again, this time a laugh escaping his mouth.
"Yes, I saw." Steve smiled encouragingly.
"Yes, we are, honey." Steve smiled.
Which just filled Tony with great zest.
"Daddy!"
And it did. Once out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist, he went into his closet. Sure enough, a nice suit awaited him, pressed and hanging. He was big enough to admit that pinstripes looked good on him.
When he didn't speak for a while, Tony spoke. "Everything alright?"
Steve grabbed his face, a hand on each side of it, and brought it closer, smile never leaving his face. Even sitting on a bed and having Tony standing in front of them, Tony didn't hover with a significant difference, much to Steve's amusement. He pressed both of their lips together. The kiss was sweet.
"You mind explaining to me, please, what's going on and why it's going on? Please?"
When Steve nodded, he went inside to receive Pepper's call. She had something to say about an investor wanting to pull out of a project and thought Tony should know before it's too late. Tony, already not liking being pulled away from Steve and Peter, just cursed at the investor and told Pepper to do the same.
Tony wasn't stupid enough to think of the threat empty so he got up and headed straight for the bathroom. A quick shower would help him feel better and more awake.
Despite Tony's offer, Steve looked nervous and lost. Tony ended up ordering for both of them when Steve claimed to not know what any of the dishes were and asked Tony to do so. Tony, now, followed his own words and went crazy. Literally. Soon enough, their table was lined with different dishes, leaving Steve to just stare at the man with an open mouth.
Peter became happy again. "Mr Incredle!"
"It's okay if you didn't want to. I would never force it on you. It's completely okay-"
Maybe telling Pepper wasn't one of his greatest ideas.
"You-" Tony had to swallow. "You... You wanna... Have... wanna..."
Either way, Tony called it a win.
"Yes, we are!" Peter nodded, Tony doubted he knew the meaning of lovable but whatever, reaching his arms for Steve to hold him. Steve did so without hesitation and kissed his son's cheeks. "Thank you, honey."
"And don't tell me that you had nothing to do with that goo all over him."
"Oh, look, I found him! He's sitting in the back seat."
Tony burst out laughing. "Oh boy, I never would've pegged you for a prankster."
"Would be a good decision." Tony suggested.
Tony face broke into a smile. A warm, welcoming one. "Well, then. Hop in. What're you wanting for?"
"No, he didn't." Tony agreed. "But I was really curious. I closed it as soon as I opened it. I swear! Just ask JARVIS."
"Why not?" When Steve hadn't answer, Tony continued. "I mean unless you were okay with him staying with a babysitter. I mean, he's you're kid. I'm not gonna tell you how to do it but like... If you want him there with us, I'd not mind. I'd not mind if he wasn't either. I mean as long as he's safe of course-"
"I have." Tony looked down at it. "It's adorable."
"See? We've got this. Now go."
Tony nodded. "I understand. Believe it or not, I plan on giving you whatever you want, so if all you want is a kiss in the bed, you're gonna get it with no complains from me."
"I'll think about it." Pepper answered before the elevator door shut behind her.
"C'mon, Pepper, You're not that cruel."
"No, I wouldn't. I'll lose. Look at him." He pointed at Peter. "It's like an angel and a puppy combined."
Now here he was, lying on bed, thinking about his date, about the man who had so easily spellbound him without even knowing or trying. Steve's obliviousness to his beauty was quite charming. But, as amusing as it was to watch the man walk around without knowing, he was willing to go on a mission to make Steve believe through and through of what he possessed. Or at least of what Tony thought of him. And that was only if Steve gave him a chance.
Mr. Samberg could suck his ass, for all he cared. But somehow Pepper had gotten him to be here, at a park, of all places, waiting for the guy to bring his dog, of all things, so they could discuss the deal they had wanted to get done 'out in the fresh air'. Blergh. Would it have been easier at the office? Maybe so. But was it happening that way? No, it was not.
NATASHA:
"That law is bullshit. You could have done more.
He cautiously lifts a hand to lay it over Vision's. "Thank you. Really. Do you - do you dream? I'm kinda hoping you don't, obviously."
"What would be the best dream you could have of her?" he asks Vision when Bruce is catching some much needed sleep. Vision cocks his head and Tony quickly backtracks. "You don't have to answer that."
He does exactly what he told Steve he would. He signs the documents and then immediately starts amending the shit of them. It's hard without the good name of Captain America to back him up, but the newly crowned King of Wakanda helps. Tony never meets T'Challa's eyes during the UN meetings, not entirely sure he won't ask a question about the team if he does, but he feels the Panther's eyes on him sometimes, watching.
As if on cue, the phone lights up and vibrates, showing a new message for Steve. He jolts a little, the bottle scraping against the cold floor, before glancing over at Sam like he needs permission, receiving a sardonic eyebrow lift in response. He snatches the phone up, bringing up the message, and stares at it for what seems like forever, drinking in every detail. He's caught between anger and something else, something now unfamiliar. He surprises himself.
The two parents stared at each other for a moment. Joseph opened and closed his mouth several times, and once upon a time she would have known what he wanted to say without ever hearing the words. That was lost to them now. Then: “Wake me up if he dies,” Joseph finally said, and stumbled back to the broken down settee that took up most of their living room, grabbing for the bottle of cheap whiskey on the way. His sleeve pulled back as he did, and she could see the corner of a name on his right wrist.
His chest seizes,
Tony snorts. "Unconscious and already has us wrapped around her finger."
She leaned against the door, one ear listening, making sure Steve’s next raspy breath wasn’t his last, but both eyes, like always, were for her husband. Her soulmate.
Allllllright is everybody ready for Tony to start dealing with some guilt? (Tony fucked up, too, guys)
"Good job, Ms. Khan," Tony says, finally sitting up. The mini reactors have kicked in and his suit is back to functioning even if his ears are still ringing.
There's no suit to train with and that is Tony's mistake to fix.)
“I didn’t understand addiction. Or the damage it was doing. Or what ‘enabling’ meant. All I knew was that when she had a glass in her hand, my mother smiled and laughed and was the life of the party. When she was drunk,” he inhales shakily. “Mom loved me. When she was sober, she hated everything. I didn’t know. I didn’t know it took time. I thought if she stayed that way, she’d hate me forever.”
"It's not stupid," Sam says softly. "But maybe tell me what you did want, Steve?"
Fury jerks his thumb at the TV where Madame Hydra is displayed, asleep on her bed. "It already
"My point is," Tony continues, a conversation nobody is having here. "That there was a choice, really. But it was better for me to pretend that I didn't have one. Until I was ready. Iron Man was like that too. Sometimes, life is better in binary. I sleep, or I don't. I fight, or I don't. You either want to be somebody, or you don't, Barnes. That's the long answer."
"The Winter Soldiers created under your father's formula," T'Challa says quietly. "They were unstable. This is what you fear. That HYDRA is using a stronger but less stable formula to create Terrigenesis."
He still remembered Steve, his greatest creation, Bucky Barnes' name on his wrist and by his side. He should have never tried for more. Can't improve upon perfection. But he had, and this is what he got.
His eyes are more open than Tony has ever seen, wide and earnest. Tony gapes at him for a moment before pointing an accusing finger at him. "Are those fluttering eyelashes I see, Pantera? From Mr. 'Tony-I-Am-A-King-Not-A-Errand-Boy' himself? You hung up on me!"
Dagger gives an encouraging shoulder nudge to him, and the younger man looks down at the table before meeting Steve's eyes straight on. "Look, man, your old team got burned, and so far we ain't proving fireproof either. I'll always have your back. It's what I'm paid for. But for what you're asking for, I need to know you have mine - and Tandy's."
one. And Steve won't leave him behind again. "You're gonna take Tony's offer," he says, closing his eyes.
. Cap's got a goldmine of information sitting pretty in a hospital bed - what are we going to do with her?"
He headed towards the brightest light on campus.
And Tony, looking at this man, is incapable of lying to him. About anything, he realizes, rewinding the conversation. "No," he whispers. "It will not."
He can't hear anything from Sam, not even a hitch in his breath or a grunt as he flies from walkway to walkway. He hasn't heard anything from Sam the whole mission that wasn't a 'yes' or 'no.' It's so quiet that for a moment he can't even focus on the data in front of him, watching letters and numbers scroll by. "Report," he demands after a moment.
"Can it, Rogers. You've had enough time in Wakanda to lick your wounds, now its time to get back to the fight. The world doesn't wait for Captain America to make up his damn mind. There are missions the Avengers can't do, countries that won't let them in. You ready to go to work, son?"
This, if possible, makes it worse. "You've let them take over everything, haven't you, Stark! I never thought I'd see you play lap-dog but I shouldn't be surprised, should I? You always were a little bitch."
"Yeah?"
Steve is letting Barnes go, in a way. Tony thought it would feel like victory, if a malicious one. Instead, his heart aches a little for them both.
"I built me a coffin," Tony whispered. "Big, metal. Can take a bullet, though not much more; all it had to take was yours. I'd crawl in it in a second if it'd bring you back."
"Daredevil."
Tony swallows. His face feels very hot. "Are you planning to use your gifts in a crime-fighting fashion?"
"It is quite alright. I get to practice all my sage kingly advice on you. I thought my father-" T'Challa breathes in. "I thought it came naturally to a king. Now I am not so sure."
On a Tuesday afternoon Tony wears the Mark I for the first time. He can't see T'Challa or Peter's expression through the masks and Vision just tilts his head as usual but Rhodey can't quite hide his grimace.
They are in training room B, Peter and Tony developing a baseline for Donnie and Kamala's power levels while Bruce and Vision collect and extrapolate results. Tony's first power inhibitor got taken out by Kamala's first power spike but the one based off this data should stand up to the test. Donnie just wanted out of the basement.
“Is this what you did?” Steve asked. “With your Steve?”
When the news comes in, Natasha spends two hours on the phone, negotiating with the Avengers' UN Council and Chad's leaders to allow the Avengers to lend a hand, but they are refused at every turn. On the news, eighty-seven people lie dead in the street. T'Challa is pacing and Tony is nervous. And it's only getting worse.
Stark was wide-eyed and pale and opening his mouth to respond when Steve added "Promise me."
"I was just wondering," he says nervously, running the circle of metal through his fingers over and over. "It's been a coupla days and I was doing really well, so I thought we could try again. I could ask Dr. Banner, but Kamala's having a rough time with her powers and he doesn't - he won't understand. Like you."
. The only living recipient of Zola's bastardized serum, the only serum Dad would have been able to get his hands on -
"You remember me?" he asks, and Barnes looks up at him with worn grey eyes sunk deep inside a tired face.
He has seconds before Luke is irretrievable and he jolts in his direction when something sails through the air and grabs Luke around the waist. The figure descends rapidly, ungracefully, and a second later Tony hears the crackle of Luke's communicator.
"Tony, I'm hurt. I'm just a machine. I'm only as good as the man who made me."
Jennifer Walters snorts. "
She twists her hand so their fingers are just barely brushing. "We're Avengers. Isn't that what we do?"
thorough, Tony. I cannot thank you enough for bringing him to justice, Your Highness."
"Oh, about the same time you were putting trackers in all my costumes."
Not a no, either. A silent sigh of relief escapes everyone in the room. "Thank you. I won't let you down," he says quietly to the room at large, then flicks at the screen to forward the information to their own devices. "This is the information we've gathered so far. Feel free to add your own notes, observations...anything you deem relevant. Dismissed."
Sam leaves him not long after that and Steve finds himself looking through the Accords again, eyes flicking to the news every once in awhile. Before he knows it, he's sketched an Iron Man flying through the skies, War Machine and Spider-Man at his side headed straight out of the page.
They split after that, Rhodey wrangling a promise for dinner out of Tony before departing to the gym, Clint off to the top floor where his family waits, and Kamala and Peter heading down to Tony's lab with his permission, where Donnie is waiting for them. The only one who remains is Aamir.
“For – I mean. I could’ve been…him,” Tony said, gesturing at the armor. “But I’m not. That, well, that must be hard. For you.” He looked up and found those blue eyes watching him carefully. “It’s just you really seem to like your Tony. And I’m not. I’m not him.”
"Don't," Tiberius said sternly. "Keep it. As a reminder."
"And we'll have adventures all our own. Somethin' grand. Like outta a Jules Verne book," Steve said. He could already imagine it.
At that, silence fell over the table, broken only by Natasha slowly, carefully, placing her knife on the table with the kind of precision that made her friends shiver. “He’s made Tony cry?” she asked, just as slowly and carefully.
"Did you ever get kidnapped?"
"I'll get right on it," Tony says automatically. Natasha raises an eyebrow.
"Can I ask you a question?"
"Can't avoid the news, though." Peter's voice is so heavy for someone so young. "You look like her, you know? Your mom." Tony's hand clenches down spasmodically as tears well up fresh in his eyes and he can't do anything but nod.
His son was a machine.
"Oh, Ty," Tony snarls softly. "Still a coward." Honestly it's not all that surprising that Tiberius would sell him out. The man's built an entire company out of it. "Then I guess Iron Man will have to pay a visit instead."
"But - you're more confident," Bucky continues. "You're better in your body. Not like you're borrowing it, like you used to act sometimes, but more like...you've always been that way. The outsides finally match what's in there, huh, Cap?"
"You're not fine," she whispers to him.
"Staff Sergeant." Steve returned the gesture somewhat stiffly, never quite ready for it. The days when he was Private Rogers, potato-peeler extraordinaire and all-around fat-head, still didn't seem all that far away.
Leaving the talking to Tony, then. That’s okay. Tony can do talking.
He picks the leftmost door and punches in the code, waving at Steve before heading inside. Steve lets himself into the other room. It is smallish, sparsely furnished, all grey and black, but nice enough to have its own bathroom. He places his bag at the foot of the bed and sits down, elbows on his knees.
He reaches his hands out and places his fingers on the cold stone, tapping out something that only marginally resembles
Tony rolls around to his back and winces. "You've flattened me into a pancake and you still can't call me Tony?"
nearly-"
"As a name? There's literally two of you, Cage.")
T'Challa's eyes are gleaming. "This is what my father dreamed of. Thank you, Tony Stark."
, he thinks to himself. And he wants Tony there with him.
"No, I did not."
Years later, Tony will be playing with his own AA chip, and I will feel the old urge those memories always stir in me and pull him close. I will wrap my hand around his and we will hold the chip together.
“This was just…out of the goodness of your heart?” Steve asked, and Tony’s eyes hadn’t been playing tricks on him earlier, that was a smile!
Tony is still looking at Kamala's report when the others file out, leaving him alone in the room with Natasha. "You put me on the spot, there, Romanov," he tells her with no heat. "A-plus plan."
Steve is quiet for a long moment. “You’re probably right. I just - remember things a lot differently. Sometimes I have to remind myself that it isn’t…like that anymore.”
"No time like the present, then," Howard bit out. Obie's mouth snapped shut. "It's for the best. For everyone. Tony knows how to hide his condition and - and Maria can't do this anymore, Obie."
"So I'll wear a baseball cap and some sunglasses, it'll be fine!" Donnie insists. Vision has disengaged from JOCASTA at this point and even FRIDAY's constant hum has gone quiet. "Or make me a disguise, or something. You can't stop me from going out!"
TRIGGER WARNING for Tiberius Stone being a creep near the end, and general parenting of dubious quality.
They'd be fine.
HOYL CRAP IT IS YOU. Look i know im only suppose to use this in emergencies but tony gave it to me and i couldnt resist. im that kid in red and blue. you dropped a cargo thing on me?
and then- and then he thinks of Bucky, of his team; people that he's led, because they chose to follow. They had found something worthy within him, and maybe that had been diminished, but he won't let it be destroyed. He won't let it be taken from him.
"Tony, you're
"I know. Hell, y'all have a robot and last I heard little brother paralyzed his own teammate mooning after the little Witch." Fury's gaze has gone steely as he watches the anger build in Steve's already hyper-tense frame, his eye roving Steve's face like he's looking for something and just not finding it. "I have never claimed to be on the side of righteousness; I leave that up to people like you, Captain. I work with what I got and as long as I keep getting results, I'm happy. HYDRA's got their eye on Stark and his gang, watching their every move, and that's exactly what I wanted."
"So, can you believe this is the one place they don't come looking for me?" Tony asks with a roll of his eyes. "They're camped out not five miles from the compound waiting to get a peak at me but this - what, this? - this is a step too far. Like I don't remember them all lurking around the funeral. You know how famous that picture of me is, in the car waiting to go to the will reading? I ran the numbers once, they use it in sixty eight point seven percent of any and all biographical pieces on the great Tony Stark."
He knows he's dreaming, because his body can still feel Rhodey beside it, breathing steadily. He'd sat down that night with a bottle of bad vodka and said "Alright, platypus, let's talk." And he had. His throat is still hoarse from talking for hours with his best friend about everything that has passed. His eyes are still stinging at the corners, because he doesn't cry, but Rhodey is the only person with whom he'll let himself get close to tears.
"You. Ms. Khan and Mr. Gill. The team. Wanda."
"No. You couldn't have. Even you knew that, in the end." The specter of his father has nothing to say that; Tony suspects he's probably gone entirely. He releases his fingers one by one, and Steve's eyes grow wider and wider at his every move. There is light peeking through the gaps of his fingers, because of course Captain America's heart shines. "It'll hold," Tony whispers to him. "This is my head, right? I won't let it break, I know it's stronger than that. You just gotta have a little faith in me, Steve."
"You tried so hard to save him, Tony, but I wouldn't feel too bad that you failed. Rhodey's used to you disappointing him."
Fury's one, very judgmental eye moves between Natasha and Tony before turning on Clint. "You fought on the other side. Would you say Agent Romanov's report is accurate, Agent Barton?"
“Well, I knew my Cap always blathering on about ‘together’ was just for show,” Tony remarked idly. His eyes were bright thought, more alive than they had been. “Nice to have it proven in two universes.”
"Of course not, that would be stupid. Freaking
Bruce sets down a beaker. "Donald."
The sun sunk below the edge of the Time Fog, cloaking the grey-purple mist in darkness and warping the whirls and eddies into indistinct shapes. Tony reached out, running his fingers through it, feeling the familiar electric tingle of pure – and unknown – energy.
"Actually," Kamala says, blushing at interrupting him. "I was thinking all of us could go somewhere. It would be fun, Tony. Miss Natasha doesn't do anything but work and Donnie says you haven't been out of lab in weeks and Vision is...Vision, so. I thought we could - well the Avengers are supposed to be-" She stops, breathing a little hard and looking almost upset, and Tony feels a sympathetic tug in his chest that he absent-mindedly rubs at. "Maybe when Miss Hope comes back? It...it would be fun."
"I wish you would reconsider," T'Challa rumbles from where he stands with them just outside the west wing of the palace where he has allowed them to stay for these long months. In his hands are Scott's processing papers he brought as proof that their one-time teammate was being treated according to the law. The king would look completely unruffled if not for the way the papers are beginning to crumple in his grip.
He just shrugs and turns back to their team on the other side of the glass, noticing Vision vastly outpacing Spider-Man now. Clint and Hope have gotten distracted by the other three's antics and Clint is yelling something and Tony watches, a wince crawling up his spine, as Peter webs himself from one corner to another before banking hard on his injured shoulder to avoid one of Vision's blasts.
Bruce's voice is remarkably flat considering how tightly he just balled up his fist. "Steve."
Tony waves a hand. "Blades took out one of mini-reactors. It's fine. Spidey here could probably use a lift, and Luke over there."
“Yes. I’ve calculated,” Jan informed him. “After the many, many,
Tony has to get there in his own time.
Obie meant well, but Howard couldn't quite smother the wince his words provoked. He was the lucky one, having Maria. She was the one who had to put up with his late nights, his admittedly lousy temper, SHIELD's constant pestering, and Tony, the son he'd asked her for.
('What do you think happened to Richards?' Steve asks Fury one day. The old man snorts.
"Your word," the General repeats dangerously, stepping marginally closer to Tony. Out of the corner of his eye he can see Rhodey rising from his chair even as T'Challa flexes his clawed fingers. "I've seen the worth of your word, Mr. Stark. You couldn't stop them before and you can't stop them now." He nods towards the TV and Tony absolutely does not smile when FRIDAY switches it over to
Yeah, Tony's pretty fond of that lie, too.
They just brought it Clint?
working. Or did I not see Daredevil and Luke Cage's contracts pass the council's desk last week?"
Daredevil nearly punches him off the rooftop. "I've heard all about you."
Natasha actually leans back a little, even though her expression doesn't change. "You don't mean that," she says steadily.
Diamondback doesn't look particularly bothered or surprised. "Nobody trusts the Avengers, Captain. And Fury controls everything. The sky is blue, water is wet. You know how you were just talking about things you can't change?"
"Tony couldn't possibly have escaped a cave in Afghanistan at sixteen with a hole in his chest, but he did," Rhodes interrupted with a wave of his hand that seemed caustic if one didn't see the sad look on his face. "He's always doing the impossible. It's...not always a good thing. We're all superheroes, but I don't think anyone can understand the kind of pressure he's under. Mostly from himself, but you know he told me when he first got here Fury basically told him all he was good for was what he could invent? Can you imagine how he feels when something he makes fails?"
-the texting, not Wanda.
"Right," Steve says, more thankful than he can possibly say for Sam's presence. "Stark and the rest of the Avengers are limited in what they can do. And if Fury is telling the truth, HYDRA is working overtime. We can't just sit back and let that happen. You saw what happened in Chad, Wanda. The Avengers got tangled up in the Accords and people died. If we have the ability to help, what right do we have to let our fear control us and keep our heads down while other people - people who can't do what you can - suffer? Maybe the Accords could work if we were talking about just Crossbones and Strucker, but there's more out there. Gods and monsters that can't be defeated by a set of guidelines."
Maybe it's not a mistake.
He'll sleep when he's dead.
“Mine isn’t there yet,” he frowned.
"Friend of yours, Parker?" And Peter dips his head a little. "You know the most interesting people."
Steve shakes his head. "Look at the number sequence afterwards. It's the same number. I bet you anything its a serial number. It's not a person they're contacting, it's a product."
Joseph looked at her like that once; before the War, before he changed, when he found comfort in her arms instead of drowning out the shadows of his mind with the drink.   She took Steve’s hand in her own, Joseph Rogers’ name parallel to Bucky Barnes', needing him to understand her. “That's right, sweetheart. Forever. But you have to care for it, make sure it grows as strong as you are."
Before he can stop himself, he takes a step backwards. Her face shifts: anger to concern to anger again, settling on a calm passivity he knows she can't feel. He wasn't expecting this, not at all. He had wondered, of course, thought about asking, but-
"It's not - now you're just fucking with me. It's a new VI. I'm thinking of names. It's a process."
. It could have been worse, he had
"You won't have anybody's if you don't sleep."
, Sarah thought, for the last time, and let them hand the flag to Steve.)
"Germany not pleased?" Fury guesses mildly and Tony suppresses his groan while Rhodey doesn't. That seems answer enough for Fury as he sits back in his chair and contemplates the group in front of him, from Rhodey all the way across to Tony, where his gaze stays. "And after Leipzig?"
·       He’s quiet and analytical. Ivan makes fun of him all the time for having his nose in a book all of the time.
Ivan Lewis Barnes
Theo and Freya Thorson
·       Tony and Steve agreed upon the name after their best friends
“It hurts. He feels stuck. You are going to have to help guide the baby out.” Tony led his hand down his opening. He could feel his baby's head but knew he would tear if he didn’t get some help. Steve looked unsure until Tony screamed out in pain. Tony grabbed his hand and guided him down. Steve worked at his opening slowly working it wider as Tony continued to push. Tony felt the burning as his opening began to get stretched to its limit. Tony whined at the pain. Steve looked up at Tony with sorrowful eyes until he felt the most amazing thing in his hand. His son’s little nose.
“No, I have one option. I’m keeping this miracle even though it came at the worst possible time.” Tony looked up at the doctor and saw only her smile. He felt a little better.
“Yes,” Tony mumbled into Steve’s shoulder. Steve pulled him away and looked Tony in the eye. Steve could tell this was real.
“Wait, I love you.” Tony didn’t turn because if he looked into Rhodey’s eyes he knew it would just make it harder for him to say it back.
Steve bounced from one foot to the other. He couldn't wait to jump out of the elevator and pull Tony in his arms and kiss him like no tomorrow. The elevator door finally opened. Steve stepped out and pause. He couldn’t believe his eyes. He was in shock but in awe. His bags fell from his hands and he just stood there staring. The man he left nine months ago was not the same man he came back to. Tony was pregnant and not just slightly pregnant. He was pregnant pregnant. Like he could have the baby any day. Tony just smiled at him as he held his belly in his hands. Steve just stared in awe.
Katina Elizabeth Barnes
“Pops!” Steve and Tony turned around to see their sons standing on the front porch. They stood waiting for their dad’s permission to proceed forward. Steve stood up and outstretched his arms and the boys ran straight into them. They might be seventeen and fifteen but that didn’t mean they still didn’t miss their pops.
·       He has traces of Super soldier blood.
·       He’s the black sheep among all of his family even his extended family. That’s probably why he went out to California.
“I love you.”
“Steve, it hurts so bad. It burns.” Tony cried. Steve tilted his head down trying to see Tony’s progress when he saw a small, tiny tuft of hair poking out.
XXXX Tony
An hour had passed of pushing and Tony was so tired. He didn’t know how much longer he could continue but Steve was an amazing cheerleader.
“Yes.” Click, the line went dead. That was it. He lost Rhodey forever. He turned away and found Steve staring at him. Steve outstretched his arms for Tony to be engulfed by them. Tony knew he made the right choice. “Can we leave? I don’t think I can be here anymore.” Steve walked Tony out of the house where they got into a taxi together. Tony laid his head on Steve's shoulder closing his eyes.
“Now!”
Life is weird. One second you are planning your whole life with one person. Imagining all of the possibilities. Then the next thing you know you are married to some other person for the last five years and you haven’t spoken to the person of the forgotten life in ten years. It’s weird but Tony often didn’t think about the forgotten man. He only came across the genius’s mind once and a while but cleaning out the closet was making him come back full force. Tony ran his fingers across the forgotten box. He knew he needed to get rid of the old memories for his sake. Pepper never pushed him to throw them away. She understood why he kept it but that didn’t mean Pepper didn’t wish they were gone. That he would move on. Tony was happy with his life so why was it so hard to throw this man away.
·       He often paints his nails black.
·       She is currently dating Ivan which is Bucky and Nat’s youngest son. He is twenty but they have been dating since she was fourteen and he was sixteen. She wants to marry him but not before she travels the world and does her first show on broad way.
Love. Happiness. Joy. Home. Security. That is something everyone has a dream of. This is all anyone wants. This was all Tony ever wanted. He thought he found it but he thought wrong.
Tony sat on the edge of the bed watching Steve pull on his clothes. Every muscle in his back pointing out and calling him back in. He wanted to crawl back over to him and wrap him up in arms. Tony wished that Steve could be all his. That he didn’t have to share him with anyone else. At last, wishes never come true. Steve would have to leave once again, and they would return back to their separate lives. Tony pulled his knees to his chest trying not to cry. He knew what this was but that didn’t mean it didn’t hurt any less.
·       Her favorite color is purple and often painted her nails that color.
· He and Steve are actually the same most of the time. Steve taught him everything he knew. James got along with Tony more. When he had the nightmares and would get into arguments with Steve over something petty, he would run straight into Tony’s arms.
“Hey, dad, there is a weird car out front,” Peter called. Tony sat down the towel he was using to dry the dishes. Tony walked to the window where Peter stood and saw who was getting out of the car.
“Okay. I understand. You need to do this, and I will support you in every way I know how to. Besides, it's only two years. It’s not that long.” Steve pulled Tony in for a kiss. He didn’t know how he could have been so lucky to find the love of his life. Tony was the best thing in life.
·       Freya focuses more on chemistry and biology. She almost figured out the cure for the common cold.
“What about me? If you reenlist. I’m done.” Tony whispered.
·       Him and Thor are close kind of. Their relationship was better when he was a kid. They haven’t really spoken in three years. Not because of a feud but just losing touch.
“Steve! Get in here now!” Steve dropped everything and ran into their bedroom. All he could see was Tony leaning against the shower wall. Tony gave him the widest grin but then his smile faded as he bent forward in pain.
“Well, it was nice seeing you, Steve. Have a good night.” Rhodey left leaving them alone. Steve stared at Tony waiting for answers even though he had no right for them. Tony held up his ring which Steve finally understood what it meant.
·       At twenty-three he took on the mantle of Captain America just like his old man. Sam Wilson after serving as the Captain for twelve long years decided it was his time to retire as his good friend had to. James was the perfect person.
“No, dear, we have two more months to go.” Steve breathed out a sigh of relief.
Tony didn’t understand why his ex was standing on his front porch. He and Steve hadn't spoken after Tony told him he wasn’t willing to be someone’s second choice. That he needed to go back to Bucky, his husband. Which was two years ago not like Tony was counting or anything. He found happiness even if he thought he never would have again.
cooking. Serious, the Super Soldier can cook? What else can he do? Make clothes? Save the small kittens from trees? No, it's Rogers who saves kittens from trees. But seriously?! Barnes cooks. That's totally unfair. He's hot and can cook… and sleeps with a hot blond. The lucky bastard.
Both Peggy and Erskine almost choked keeping back their laugher. "He's a Stark for you," Erskine smiled.
She knew it was coming, but it still hit her like a ton of bricks, or in reality, like a bus. It hit her like a six-ton bus. And for a few long seconds or what seemed like hours, time freeze as her brain couldn't process what he just said. She knew it was coming, but that did not prepare her.
Rogers took around step toward him. "Please tell me if he's alive, Sir. B-A-R-"
"Of course," Toni snapped. She didn't want her father anywhere near her device, and she would do anything to get it away from him short of killing him.
"What does that even mean? Do you even hear to yourself?" Toni asked out of annoyance. He stepped closer to her, and Toni could smell his stench, which was a combination of a few of things "Also, do you believe in showers?" Though it wasn't as bad she pretended, she waved the smell out of her face.
Toni let out a chuckle. "That's a game you'll all lose," she stated. "C'mon, Jones. Let's see that hand. Can you beat my four of a kind?" She put on her evil smile. Yes, he might beat her, but the chances were low. She remembered all the cards that were played and she knew what was left.
Toni let out a painfully sad laugh as she watched him step to her. "Why are you here?" she asked, not wanting to be bothered. She wanted to be alone to her thoughts, though she knew it would be unwise. Her mind was never a safe place when she was like this. However, she could peg the question: was it ever safe?
"You know after the Stark Expo when Steve noticed you were gone, he were frantic and went looking for you. It took me a while to get him to come back to the apartment," Barnes admitted as he followed her out. "I know he was still looking when I left him."
*O*O*
When Banner had brought up the idea of time travel, Steve shot it down, saying it was downright crazy; however, it had merit. His memories from the 1940's, which he wasn't all too sure about, had Toni in them. Steve shook his head. It was those fuzzy memories that made him fall in love with her, even if the present day Toni was an asshole. If it wasn't for the same glow in memory Toni's chest, he would think they were different people. Shaking his head, he tried to get her out if his mind. Thinking about her only made him feel worse.
Howard's hand felt warm on her kneed, and for a second, it was the only thing she could think of. She couldn't get over how comforting it was to having this version of Howard around. He wasn't cold and distant, someone she couldn't reach. He was warm and caring, a person who she could open up to.
"You're amazing, you know that?" she said. Though she still felt like crap, she could find the surface.
"Understood," the AI replies.
Clint pouted as Natasha stepped away from him with the bulb in her hand. "Let's get this tree decorated," she said.
"That's what everyone's telling me," he responded with a chuckle.
She gave him a look. "This relationship isn't going to work if you treat me with kid gloves, Rogers," she said. She didn't mean for it to come out like a threat, but it did. She could see something snap in his eyes.
"And what about me?" Dugan asked.
He looked at her, before leaning toward her and taking her into his arms. "You're anything but shitty."
It was difficult to watch as Maya left a blood trail behind her, but Toni couldn't look away. "Stop," she begged, unsure of what to say. What did she tell the woman that screwed with her head so many years ago and was now dying in front of her? Maya may have put a dent in Stark, but she wasn't supposed to die like this, not in front of her. This was going to be another dent in Toni's armor, and she couldn't handle that. Again, she brought on someone's death, as she refused to act, refused to listen. Sure, helping a madman take over the world wasn't smart, but was it right to sentence Maya to death? Did she not care that Maya would die for refusal?
end you. Do you understand?" he hisses, warning them. "I will."
His mind turned back to Toni and her plan. Why did she go out with the 107? Was this whole thing planned? "I'm surprised you didn't ask me about Corporal Sark," Phillips stated as he ignored the look from Peggy.
*O*O*
Toni glanced back at the box before looking at Peggy, who was eyeing them. "Okay," she said, still feeling unsure. It was that feeling that silenced her. It was that time that she used to think.
Her grip loosen on the box and glanced over to him. "Why?"
Toni found herself in a familiar room, sitting in a familiar chair, as she was handcuffed to a familiar table. Besides her, Colonel Salt, who was sitting across from her, was the only one in the room. She had no doubt that Peggy and her annoying father were standing behind the glass watching her.
And with the nicknames for Barnes, I was thinking Toni might give him to depending on how close she gets to him.
After he was thawed, his brain didn't snap back right away and his dreams took a few days (or what felt like days) to return. There was no real way to tell when his mind snapped back to his body and when he began to feel once again, but it all came back to him. His dreams were not of Agent Peggy Carter, the one of three women he had ever been kissed by and the last woman he had kissed. When his dreams came back, they were of Corporal Toni Sark, a woman he had kissed once, a woman he didn't know a lot about; however, he was completely in love with her.
The Colonel kept his eyes on Toni as she spoke, "I'm fine. You can leave." He could see her shift in pain and it pulled at his heart strings as he disliked seeing a lady in pain, but there was nothing he could do.
"To the Hydra base," she revealed. "There's something in that base that I need."
Putting her phone back into her pocket, she picked up the device and stared. What was going on with this tiny device? "Yes, mother," she teased. Though it was annoying, she was glad Pepper was here to do so.
"Magic?"
It was getting dark but Toni didn't care because for the last hour, she had been following her stalker and getting close. Though she wasn't sure, she didn't think he had spotted her, and this was a good opportunity to see what this guy was up to. She would find out if he had been ordered to follow her by the Colonel. She knew the chance of that was low as no military tail should be this sucky. If he was, she would have to give Colonel Salty a firm talking to.
"Yea right. You're more a delinquent then I am," Toni countered as she stuck her tongue out. She was being childish she knew, but it was not hard not to be when dealing with Barnes. "And if I have to have a parasite going inside of me, I expected to be waited on hand and foot. Now hop to it, Barniez Boy!"
He didn't answer right away, studying the lines on her face. "Nightmares?"
The end for now!
"For a dame, you have a mouth," Rogers said as he walked over to her. As he took the pan from her, he didn't notice the glare she was giving him.
"Oh, does it?" he asked, not stepping back from her. "Why don't you tell me how?"
She turned back to him. "I know how to get back."
"But, Salty," she whined.
"Stay out of my head," Tony snaps.
"You know you don't have to smile if you're in pain," he said, noticing her twitch.
He looked at her. "My mother had always taught me to be respectful to ladies, and you make that difficult." He placed the thick folder he was carrying on the table. "Did your mother ever teach you manners?"
Howard let out a sigh. "Hey," he replied, as he stepped to them. "I am not impossible. I just know what I want."
Her eye twitched at the word, father. "Am I going to get it back?" she asked annoyed. Why did he have to use the word father? Just thinking about Howard made her blood boil.
"Geez, Rogers. You're no fun," Natasha chuckles as she takes a seat on a beanbag near Wanda and Vision.
"I…knew something was going to happen, not when or how," she admitted. It was the truth. She had no idea of how Rogers turned into a Popsicle.
. How could someone like her be taken down so easily? She was
"Oh, how I missed you," Barton replied.
*O*O*
Soo... I am soo sorry. I am not sure why it took me so long to get this out. Hopefully, my next chapter does not take so long to get out.
"Salty?" he asked.
"Now, leave Rogers alone. He needs to prepare for the next hydra base, and you need to get your ass in here," He stated as he crossed back to the tent. "And I mean now," he ordered as he entered his tent.
"Toni." Peggy said again.
The AI didn't answer right away; it was like JARVIS was pausing for affect. "If I may, Miss, you are Toni Stark. You do not do subtle."
Pepper stood still but she didn't turn back. "I'm not doing this because I want to. I'm doing this, because I have to. I'm doing this because Toni is important to me. She will always be important to me and I would do anything to make her happy; however, I have to think about myself. I have to, or all I am going to have is regret and hatred."
Toni glanced at Romanoff, her look cold. She eyed the Assassin's movements as she sidestepped to stay out of her reach. "I just need a drink," she said. Her sneakers swished with each step, leaving a wet trail behind her. "You three can go back to DC if you like. I just need my best friend. His name is whiskey."
"No," she answered. Seeing his face, Toni added, "I did try to break into Stark Industries." She hadn't moved from the door.
a voice inside of her head said. Barnes mentioned that Rogers spent days looking for her; he had to pissed, but he needed to get over it. "I don't need to rest." She hobbled toward Rogers. "You worry too much."
"Mute," she snapped as she poured herself another glass.
"It isn't a ghost she's been seeing. It has been Hydra the entire time," Natasha replied, her voice turning ice cold. Her hands danced at her side. "This was the plan the entire time. Get her to the point that she doubts her sanity and turn her." She turned to Steve, her eyes unreadable. "We got to go."
"He-help," she called out, trying to yelling, but it wasn't anything more than a whisper. She couldn't stay on the ground, waiting for them, because they could be hurt worse than she. Using her fear, she pushed herself up with one arm and looked around. Everything was still fuzzy, but she could make out a few things. Her broken desk and chair lay a few feet from her. The Device, which seemed to be one piece, was a few feet in front of her. The title floor, which looked like it had fallen from the sky, was no longer whole.
It was like a switch had gone off in her head and the air was gone from her lungs. Suddenly, Toni slammed her foot on the break and yanked the steering wheel to the right, almost losing control. Ignoring the screams of the wheels, she pulled off the road and stopped the car within a few seconds. It felt like someone had punched her and was now sitting on her chest, as she couldn't seem to catch her breath. It felt like someone had their hands wrapped around her heart and was squeezing.
be seen as he would be punished, though he knew he would already be punished. He had disobeyed a direct order, and he was ignoring Rumlow yelling orders in his ears. He knew what would become of him, but he had to follow this woman. He
I was waiting for my Beta, but she was busy and you guys were bugging, so here you go. You guys just love to bug me, don't you?!
Sorry it took a long to update. Here you go the next chapter. This will be the last chapter in Part one of The Change Tide of Time. Don't worry. I have the next Chapter written for Part two. It is just waiting to be beta-ed. And again, thanks to my beta who is awesome. :) So as soon as she gets that back to me, i will post it.
Barnes sighed as he put the gun away and offered his hand to Toni. "I would never. You're too spunky for that." She glared at his extended hand. "There's nothing wrong with accepting a helping hand." He let out another chuckle at his pun.
When Central Park came into sight, Toni slowed down to a trot. The thoughts were still there and she didn't want to stop, but she eyed the park, the only green spot in the city. It was where a lot of people went during the day for countless things, and it was where people relax, enjoying the sights. However, it wasn't the place to be at this hour, but for some reason, the genius made her way over to the park, ignoring the honking horns and insults throw at her.
JARVIS replies, "Miss Stark does not know about my intrusion, and she will not be pleased to learn of it."
you. And once the Hulk is done with you, you have to deal with me," he said with smirk. He slowly removed his hand from Steve's shoulder, as he turned to the door. "The
Toni was not in the mood to be babied, especially not from these two. Barnes had just died and they were making out.
Her neck and back were in pain as she pushed herself up. She had slept at a weird angle with her head rested on Rogers' ripped jacket, and it hurt to move. She stretched herself out as she tried to work out the knots in her body. She had fallen asleep in a bathroom before, but this was the worst that she had ever felt the next morning. Maybe, she could convince them to add some pillows as this wouldn't be the only time she slept in here.
I am sorry this took me soo long to get this out. I wanted to get this out sooner, much soon, but it took me awhile to write this. I hope the next one doesn't take me too long.
"You're a flirt."
Steve kissed her again. It was a short kiss, but it worked all the same. "Never said I couldn't. I live for it," he said.
"So is this place any good?" she asked, trying to change the subject.
"There's not going to be a safe landing. But I can try and force it down," Steve said, his voice coming through the radio. It was a little hazy, but they could understand him.
"I know," he said as he placed a kiss to her forehead.
"What happened to make you like this?"
to. Ordered to! And they would do it without hesitation. They would tell Fury
"You must hate me."
There was a smile on Maya Hansen's face, as she sat in front of what Toni would call a hellhole of a work bench on a slightly higher level. That work bench looked like the rest of the room: a trash pit.
"Well that's because you hadn't face it fully, Salty!" She turned to the Colonel and gave him a smile.
"Where's the Mark 7?" she asked, wanting to get out of here as quickly as possible. No one could stop her if she had the suit.
Toni was totally exhausted from the rounds in the bed and shower, but she could admit that she was completely and thoroughly pleased. Now, she wanted to take a nap, but her stomach was growling at her, demanding food. Hearing her stomach—laughing at her-, Steve was at the stove, as he tried to save his burnt—now cold—pancakes, but there was no saving them. They didn't even seem appealing anymore. Her vote was to toss them in the trash, but Steve shook his head at that, stating that someone in some foreign country would die for them. With narrowing eyes, Toni pandered how old this man really was, but she was going to let him have this for now.
Closing the door behind her, Toni stepped into Steve's tiny loft apartment and paused to take a look around, taking everything in. With a deep sigh, she stepped further into his 'home' (if she could call it that), glaring at everything she saw. Not realizing it until now, she
, feeling a distance in her body. What was wrong with her? Sure, she was hit on the back on her head, but it was more than that. "Never."
Erskine looked down at the blue prints. "It protects her heart, and we now know how. The rector is keeping something out of her heart and I don't think she will admit what or why." He took a deep breath. "That's what's worrying me."
"That would intent you coming to DC, Miss. We all know how you feel about the city. And a body would only limit me."
Barnes was beating himself up over that, but there was no way he could've stopped her. Toni had a mind of her own and there was no telling her anything. "She wouldn't listen," he replied. "I tried, though I wish that I had tried harder." The image of her being grabbed from behind and knocked out by a hydra soldier was burnt into his mind. He couldn't get rid of the feeling that he failed as he watched her be taken. He felt like shit and he couldn't get rid of that feeling.
"Bucky?" she uttered, staring at him.
The Colonel stared at the Arc reactor, which didn't sit well with Toni. "It would be wise to cooperate with us. I do not wish to hurt a woman." He picked up a photo and stared at it. "I just need to know how this works and what exactly it does. When we found you, it appears as if the device exploded, which we all it didn't. You would be dead if it did."
"I thought there would be no future talk?" He sighed as Toni glared at him, which was her response to his question. "What if you're captured?" He eyed her. "Regardless of gender, anyone will fold under continuous torture." He stood up and crossed to one of the flaps as if he was going to leave. "I doubt that my own men could keep silent under harsh torture. How could you?" he asked as he motioned to the officers outside of his tent. "I cannot allow future knowledge to fall in Schmidt's hand."
She glanced at the items. "Please tell me I don't have to wear a skirt, as I refused." There were a few things she could put up with, but she wouldn't wear a skirt. Yes, she had worn skirts and dresses before, but that was different. This was the army.
"I respect a lady's wishes," he stated as he turned back to her. He held the clip behind his back. "You did ask me to leave. I will not impose myself on you."
The angry voice started a mere second after Toni got back to Steve's shitty apartment. Before she could jump in the shower to get this paint off her, it hounded her. It was like the ceiling was falling down on her, crashing her.
*O*O*
He looked at her and laughed before he became deadly silent. "Though, they might not respect a woman Corporal," he stated very seriously. "There aren't women Corporals."
Steve turned his head ever so slowly, giving him a cold, calculating look. "Not now. We have to find Toni, before something happens."
A warm hand appeared on her shoulder, which sent the genius ten feet into the air. Fearing Barnes, she started to fight, struggle against the hand on her. Her heart was ready to pop out of her chest, fearing he was getting his revenge. "No," she yelled, her voice shaky.
"Well since you offered," Loki started, stepping toward the glass wall. "I think I saw a magazine with a certain dark headed brunette. Why don't you get that for me? I enjoy her sassiness."
Toni smiled evilly as she linked arms with Steve, ignoring the twitch in Barnes' eye. She wasn't doing this to make him jealous, not that she would use Steve for that because he would never be attracted to her. "You wouldn't want to know yours, Cap. C'mon. Walk me to Salty," she ordered as she pulled on his arm. "We can talk about your love life." She almost died of laugher at the sight of both of their faces. "You need some help!"
He left out a chuckle. "I think you know the answer to that," he said as he followed after her. "You know it might be best to put on shoes when walking around the lab. We don't need a pretty dame getting hurt."
Tony knows he needs to calm down and take a step back, but there's so much bubbling inside of him that he can't. "I got this," he says, before turning off his comm. He knows his tone and sudden appearance has only caused worry along his team, but he doesn't care. He doesn't care if he hurts anyone's feeling. He needs to worry only about himself.
"Let me-" He started as he leaned in as if to kiss her.
Howard's arms dropped to his side as Toni pushed herself up. He eyed her red face and nodded. "Yes, let's get started," he said as he got to his feet.
"You shouldn't drink alone."
After a quite look to insure Toni was okay, Steve jumped over the chair in one leap. "You have to do better than that, Doll." He teased, as his old accent started to break through.
Then she would be getting drunk ass wasted in the hopes that she could forgot, forget that her father was dead. To forget that she was a failure yet again. She wanted to forget all the lives that were lost because of her.
"She's a child," the colonel added. "I feel like I have to babysit."
Not answering right away, Rhodes groans loudly, as his hold on the genius loosens. This is a losing battle and he knows it as he looks at Vision. "Fine, but if you two hurt him, I
. With her heart beating, her eyes went to the kitchen, but unlike the day before, Steve wasn't there. He wasn't in the apartment at all.
He exhaled slowly and crawled into his bed, not even bothering to change out of his dirty uniform. Laying on his back, he stared up at the ceiling, thinking about how Toni disliked him, and he couldn't blame her. With the way he treated her, he would hate himself too. One second, he treated her like a spoiled rich girl, who couldn't do anything; and then next, he treated her as something fragile, something that he had to protect. Though he didn't mean to, he made her feel like a child, which was the last thing he wanted. He wanted her to feel safe not trapped.
Toni didn't know when she came to as it was a never ending nightmare to her. Even in her drug induced coma, the nightmares didn't stop and seemed to tire her out even more. Sure, she felt somewhat rested, but it felt like she hadn't slept in days. When she came to, she just blinked for a few seconds as she stared up at the ceiling.
"Okay, Okay," Clint replied, putting his arms up in surrender. "I see that I'm outnumbered here." He glanced around the room, scanning everyone.
Pierce turned to Rumlow. "I think we should leave that up to the Asset as well."
Wilson groans. "No one wants to be," he says, whining. "Let's stop talking about their love life." He sounds like he's going to be sick. "And pick a movie. And no
She narrowed her eyes at him. "I know."
I also want to build on build on Steve and Bucky's friendship, so I hope I add some in this chapter. I am also adding the Bucky/Steve Friendship Tag as their friendship will be big in this story.
She glanced toward Toni again before looking away quickly. "You were almost assaulted. It's no laughing matter, Sark."
Steve kept close to Toni, and no, it wasn't because he was scared that Toni was going to collapse. He was just worried, worried what she would do if he left her alone. Even if she didn't tell him, she
She stared off, not wanting to look at him, but he had a point. She needed to take care of herself, but she couldn't take the nightmares. It would be one thing if they were scary or bloody, but she couldn't take the guilt ridden ones. "I get it, but I still don't understand why you care."
he though as he turned toward her, but she was gone.
Barton sighed. "I get it. It was funny to see Rhodes huff it back to the Quinjet, but it could've been deadly. Sure, no one likes Rhodes, but geez, trying to kill him? That's a bit much."
If Toni could slap the AI, she would have. Did she go to far? Did she create a monster? God, she created a monster. Maybe, it was a good thing that she didn't create him a body. "Ha ha," she mocked. "I have made amazing decisions."
Once Steve arrived at the left side of the bed, he pulled the sheets back and lifted his leg to climb in, but before he could get in, Toni pushed up slightly. "Stevie, I have a rule. No socks in bed," she chuckled. "So take those bad boys off."
The eyed him before he said, "Are you going to be okay?"
She felt her heart skip a beat, feeling someone behind her. She couldn't get over how jumpy she had become since this whole experience, and it annoyed her. She hated being so weak that even a glass of water could freak her out, and now a mere shadow could do the same. Maybe she could talk to Clint, who would tease her endlessly, but he would give her some pointers without questions. "Colonel," she replied as she welded a wire to a core.
Deep within an old bank vault (one that still had a layer of dust and dirt), Rumlow found himself annoyed and bored, as he stared down the Winter Soldier. The asset stood still like a statue, unnerving to say the least. With a fix stare, it was hard to believe that the Asset was alive, let alone active and ready to strike. If it wasn't for his chest moving ever so slowly, Rumlow would've believed him dead. He may be murderer himself, but it made his skin itch; however, he was a puppy dog in this stage. "The entire plan?"
"Toni," Steve uttered.
*O*O*
Feeling like she was going to collapse at any second, Toni slowly made her way to the mansion. Her track was sluggish, a battle to move one foot in front of the other. Her muscles twitched with every movement, protesting against her. However, she wasn't going to give up… not now. Not ever. Though, there was a nasty thought in the back of her head, doubting her resolved. Telling her to give up and it was hard to fight that.
"No, never," she replied.
"A few of my men had run into a female soldier, but they were no match for her, and she escaped, which is quite impressive."
*O*O*
Rolling to her side, she extended her arms to 85-degree angle, putting the tips of her metal covered fingers into the water. The water sprayed up like a continuous water gun, which spewed the suit with massive amount of water. It was soaked in the matter of seconds, almost like she did a cannon ball in the water. The suit was almost hidden behind the man-made waves leaving only the path in front of her free. This just drove her forward into the open water.
Peggy glanced at him only for a second before turning back to the Captain. "Howard has some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?"
"Yes, just a book," she stated, looking past him toward the entrance of the plane, where she noticed a few people boarding. Though she knew it was stupid, she couldn't help but look for Barnes as the Commandos entered and it was a blow to the heart when he didn't appear. Even now, it was hard to believe that he was dead and she had to keep reminding herself that he was and there was no changing that fact.
Bruce chuckled. "That would be Toni for you."
Natasha walked past the stilled Toni, giving Steve a look. The Captain had yet to move as he eyed Toni. "I'm going to go in before they kill each other." Without waiting for a response, she disappeared into the room. The genius could hear the room silenced at the sight of Romanoff, and Toni had to give it to her; Romanoff could control a room with ease. It just took a single look to do it.
Toni took a deep breath. "I don't know if I would call myself that." Yes, she would call herself that to anyone who would listen, but she didn't need James Barnes to tell her that. She knew already. She had countless IQ tests done on her since she was small. She had been putting mainframes together since she was four, but they didn't need to know that.
"So that's it," she says as she reaches for him and pulls him into his arms. "How are Barnes and Steve so stupid?" she asks as her hands travel up and down his back.
"I need-" She started, but Phillips cut her off. "You're not going. You're staying back with Stark," he said. "It's too dangerous, and you
Shaking his head, he shook a deep breath. "I know, but that's hilarious."
Phillips glimpsed at Peggy. "I see you two might have an issue getting along. If you two can't control yourselves, I'll step in and if I have to, it won't be pretty. I cannot allow this on the battlefield."
Steve was getting angrier and angrier with each passing second. "Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny." He glanced at Banner for a second, annoyed that he was even there. "No offense, doctor." It came out harsher than he intended, but he didn't care, not with imagine of Toni's hand on his arm.
"Toni."
"My father did what?" she asked, as she took a step forward to grab the package. Her mind was having a difficult time wrapping itself around what was happening. How could he do this? How did her father know what would happen? That she would be here? Did he know her that well? How was that possible?
"Oh, I so want to slap you!"
"Following is not really my style," Toni said with a shrug.
she thought, yelling at herself. It had been years. It had been decades.
"Am I good for anything?" he asked himself, as he passed yet another alley that he was beaten up. "You did save that girl," he told himself, remembering the woman he found in the empty lot a week ago. He hadn't seen a woman so injured before that he didn't know if she would survive. "I wonder if she's okay." After she was taken away, he hadn't seen or heard from her. He had tried calling the local hospitals to make sure she was okay, but there was no record of her at any of the hospitals. That worried him, but that didn't mean anything bad had happened to her.
Hey all, Sorry it took me so long to get this out. I had planned to get this out sooner, but it didn't work out like that. I started this weeks ago.
"Tony," Rogers and Barnes call after him, but the genius doesn't stop.
*O*O*
. I love you and Bucky. I've always loved the two of you; I was screwed the second I saw the both of you, and I knew it. It's love at first sight."
However, she absolutely had no filter at the moment, ready to attack anyone who even looked in her direction, and she blamed it on Pepper and her vacation….okay, it wasn't Pepper's fault, but she was moody and she could and would blame whoever she liked. The genius had it up to here with stupid, as it seemed like all she did was babysit people, who didn't know what they were doing. Seriously, baby sit. Toni had forgot how stupid people were, forgot that a CEO was highly paid Babysitter. Was this how Pepper felt? Toni hoped not. God, she hoped not.
"Me saving your life," Harley replied as if it was the simplest thing.
Toni, even at the point of sheer exhaustion, struggled in her bindings as his very voice was annoying the hell out of her, and she couldn't fucken take it anymore. She couldn't understand why he thought talking to her would change her mind. Maybe, he thought talking to her would work better than torture, and…it might. His voice was so much worse, and his 'I am mightier then you' tone was pissing her off. Beside the fact that she was the only one who could use that tone, how could he talk to anyone like that? He wasn't a god. He was nothing.
The genius from the future let out a chuckle, because she should've expected that from her father, who would always seem smarter than she. However, she also smiled because of what she had said to Loki before. It was like magic when her father and she put their minds together.
Natasha let out a chuckle as she eyed the bulb flying up and down in the air. "Well, you have a big mouth on you," she said. "Sometimes I think it's worse than Stark's."
Toni popped the stress ball up again, but as her mind wandered, she put too much force in it, and it flew over her head. Not thinking about the outcome, she threw herself back in her chair as she tried to catch the stress ball high in the air. Her eyes never left the ball, as she chased after the ball, which went flying over her head. In her mind, she saw herself catching the ball with little trouble, but that wasn't what happened. Instead of gracefully, the office chair went flying out from underneath her, and in her surprise, she landed on her face as she was unable to stop herself. With her mind focused on the ball, she paid no attention to her angle or path, and she smacked the floor hard before she realized that was happening. If face planting was bad enough, the chair landed on her
He was the asshole that attacked Steve in the alley and slapped her ass, which no one did and got away with. He was also the reason why Steve and she didn't talk for days. "It won't be you," she snapped. Shaking her head, she turned to leave, but she didn't get too as he grabbed her arm. "What the hell? Let me go, Private," she ordered, using ranks.
With the gun and a journal tucked in her belt, Toni headed deep into the woods to the point that she couldn't see or hear the camp. Having been to this area a few time, she had set up a mini camp for herself where she could work in peace. She wasn't able to bring her device as the locked suitcase was with the Colonel; he didn't want her to go too far with it. However, she was able to scan the Arc Reactor, without being watched. Taking it partly out, she was able to connect the scanner to it, and though it gave her an idea of what was wrong with it, it confirmed that the reactor could not be fixed in this time. Most of the technology that she would need was not invented yet.
Bruce stepped toward Steve, giving him a look. "Same here," he said, putting a hand on Steve's shoulder. "Don't hurt her, Steve. People might fear Natasha, when she's angry- which is always, but when the Hulk is angry, you better run. Granted, you can't hide from the Other Guy for long, because he
However, seeing how badly he hurt Peggy when he went under, it was a good thing that he did reject Toni. Listening to Peggy as she cried, it almost broke him, and if it would've been Toni, he would've surely died listening to her breaking. She, a woman who never opened up to anyone, wouldn't have withstood another blow to heart and he was glad that he didn't break her heart more than it had to be, though it didn't protect
Toni wasn't looking at Steve, though he made it difficult to look anywhere else. He was kneeing between her legs with one hand on her arm and the other on her cheek, rubbing his thumb in a circular movement. There was a sweetness to his voice that couldn't be matched. She felt like she could do anything with him looking at her like that, and that was probably how and why she told him everything. It was probably why nothing she said changed the expression on his face.
Her eyes lids felt heavy as she tied to open her eyes. "L-lights," she stuttered. She could barely make out anything in the darkness and Toni wasn't sure if was her eye sight or the lights.
"Hey, Bucky," Rogers greeted. "Sorry, I'm late. I got a little distracted."
In about ten minutes, they arrived outside of the apartment. "You need to tell him, Barnes" she said, trying to change the subject. Toni didn't want to talk about her anymore.
She also uses these weeks to watch Stark Industries, in which she had noticed a small hole in the security that she could sneak through. Now, she just needed to pick the time to sneak in, but that would have to wait until the cast came off. Hopefully, it would be in the next week, or she would take a saw to it herself. It was the itchiest thing on the planet.
The change in her Best Friend's tone didn't surprise her, but it still left her a bit stunned. "He's on a mission, saving the world. It's fine," she replied, though she had no idea if it was really fine. She had no idea when Steve would be back… if he would be back for Christmas. She wasn't so sure if that was a bad or good thing since she wouldn't be getting her hopes up. Sure, it was Christmas, but she wouldn't be able to handle the pain of a letdown, if she let herself believe he would be back in time.
Toni was finding it difficult to read to the Sassy Agent, who seemed to be holding herself together in the misty of everything. The genius from future hadn't even stepped a foot in this camp before, and yet, she could see the memories of this camp. She could see Rogers as he tried to keep up with the rest of the men. She could see the other soldiers being cruel to Rogers as he struggled. She could see it all in her mind, and she was barely keeping it in, but yet, Peggy seemed unfazed by their surroundings. It was impressive.
Rogers turned and Toni's breath got stuck in her throat. His right eye was black and blue. How didn't she notice it before? "I don't know. Nowadays, I don't know what he's up to." He smiled weakly at her.
"Oh, that hurts," he said, playing hurt.
"Fury's," Natasha answered from behind him.
"Just going of a run," she told herself, fighting against the voice in her head. "Normal Rogers behavior." There had been several times that Toni had woken to empty bed, though having gone to bed with Steve. This was normal, and she hated it. Granted, Steve always tried to make it back before she woke. Knowing him well, she couldn't fault him, because he only did this when he could not sleep, which just made her worry. "Just normal."
Cho gives him a look. "True, more like their mate," she says with a chuckle. "They might piss on you."
"I get it, Steve." Her voice softened.
Toni raised an eye brow as she looked at him. "Lies! Who would want or need a Hawkeye?" she teased, not knowing if he was telling the truth. Did he have anyone? She really didn't know if the man had a family…granted, if she thought about it, what did she know? The same could be said of the red head assassin, but her being a Russian Assassin told the genius everything that she needed to know.
"Just say yes and I will tell you."
*O*O*
Peggy's hand dropped from Toni's shoulder as she took a seat next to her. "Howard's the only one who calls me that."
I meant to have this out sooner, but My beta and mine emails got lost in a black hole. haha. It is all good now.
But first, he had to speak with Agent Romanoff and Agent Barton again. He had already spoken to them about the strange disappearance of Toni Stark, but they hadn't heard about break in yet. He wanted their opinion on the matter, because he valued their opinion more than he let on.
, but the assassin did not. Seriously, she was surprised to all hell that no one notice the un-sneaky engineer leave, but Toni counted it as a blessing.
"Sleep headache," she muttered to herself. "I must've slept too long." She laughed as she thought about her sleeping patterns. Usually, she never slept this much, only having about 4 hours of sleep a night if that. She had been yelled at so many times about it by every single Avenger and…Pepper. Toni would rather face each Avenger and even Loki than face an angry Pepper.
"It will not hurt you," Erskine stated.
Shaking his head, Steve unclicked his seatbelt and kept his head low as he stepped out of the helicopter onto the helipad at Stark Tower, which he hadn't left except for missions. The propeller created wind batted him as he stepped away. Once he was a safe distance away, he stood up straight and turned back, watching the helicopter take off. "I don't trust Fury."
(See the end of the chapter for
She laughed. "This isn't about help. You want to know how I outsmarted you." She was being childish she knew, but it wasn't every day that she had her father guessing, and she was going to enjoy it.
Sorry it took me longer than expected to have the last chapter updated. I have no idea why it took so long... All I know that this chapter started at 5,000 or so words and after I proofed it a few times, it ended with 8,000 and plus words. Maybe that was it?
Tony isn't sure if his face is red, but his cheeks sure as hell feel warm. What's going on with him? "Taste like food. For a while, I thought he was trying to poison me, but I'm not dead," he says with a shrug. "Though you never know."
Toni tried to shoot up to get a better look of the clock, because that wasn't possible. How was it eleven Am? How was that even possible? First, Steve never slept for that long; he was an early raiser no matter how many hours he had slept the night before, and she was a Stark, which meant no sleeping for more than two hours. It was in her DNA. Her family DNA, even her father couldn't sleep for long.
"Toni," she offered. If she was in the past, she wasn't going to give him her last name, and if this was some kind of joke, her captors should already know who she was. No one could forget a face like hers.
"Don't you even think about it, Romanoff! Don't you dare!" Steve warns as he gives her a narrowing look, almost daring her. Before she can move, he quickly sits next to Tony, refusing to give up his spot next to Bucky and Tony. It always gives Tony a chuckle when someone tries to steal a seat next to him, because he loves the look on his boyfriends' faces when someone moves anywhere near him.
Tony tries to snort, but it just hurts and he's left trying to catch his breath. "Feels like I have been hit by a truck."
"Why not?"
Toni turned away as not to look him in the eyes. "Did anyone tell you your breath smells?" she asked, mockingly. She wanted to ask him what he thought she was caught in and who this master was, but she decided not to play his game. "Do you not know what a toothbrush is?" She closed her eyes waiting to be hit, but it did not come.
Phillips narrowed his eyes as he looked her over. "Are you telling me you are related to Howard Stark?"
"What?" he uttered, giving her a weird look.
On the other hand, Salty seemed to trust her a little more, allowing her to work alone, and he also learned that it was a mistake to leave her in the room with her father. The last time that she was, she threw a wrench at his head. Howard had dodged and laughed it off, but the Colonel, annoyed that neither of them would tell him why she threw it, thought it would be best to separate them for a bit. Peggy, though silent, did not approve, which Toni could see as plain as day.
However, he had to find her and disappearance before anything happened—as something would happen. He was the Winter Soldier-, and once he did, he wouldn't allow her out of his sights, not that she would have any choice or any interesting in doing go. They also wouldn't be able to stay in one place for long, not when his handlers were hunting him; nevertheless, they wouldn't be able to get anywhere near them, not when he had his brunette. He would protect her from his handlers at all cost. He already had a plan, ready to use. He just needed to find her.
"For that question," she replied as she stepped toward her device, which was sitting on a metal case. Wires traveled down the side of the case and away from the device. The dirt drawn circle had been washed away, leaving a muddy mess in its place.
Rogers stared at her confused. She had him going around in circles, which wasn't too hard to do. "Again, I don't mean to disrespect you," he stated, unsure of what to say anymore.
Tracking Rollins had been easier than what it should have been, considering the situation. Barton would've expected the traitor to be better than this; however, if he was
her. Where was he? Breathing heavily, she pulled away and glanced up at Steve, who looked –for lack of a better word- hungry. "Where's Bucky?"
"I'll stay if you stop asking and if you tell Rogers about your enlistment," she said, poking the beast.
*O*O*
"Don't kill her. The Boss wants her alive." Came Rollins' rasty voice, which just confirmed Toni's fears.
"You shouldn't speak. We just took the feeding tube out," the nurse responded as she took the glass from Toni and made her lay back down.
For some reason I feel like Toni is getting captured a lot... haha.
The Brooklyn Twins look at each other, sharing a telling look, before looking back down at the genius. "Talk to us. Please tell us what's going on in that head of yours."
She laid out all of the outfits on the bed, as she was unsure which one to put on. Each was too girly for him, but at least they had high neck lines, which would hide the fading reactor. "Let's go with the dresses, because it would be too much work with the skirt," she moaned. She hated dresses, and she knew the future Rogers would be having a kick out of this. He had told her once that he had always wanted to see her in a dress, as he had never seen her in a dress. He wasn't even sure she owned a dress. She did of course (thanks to Pepper), but they were hidden in her closet.
"So how does it taste?" Barton asks.
As she turned a corner, she felt a pair of eyes on her and she turned quickly, looking for the eyes. "Where are you?" she asked. Her eyes scanned the crowd. "Wait," she breathed as she noticed a man shifted. She knew it might not be anything as anyone can shift, but his shifting was uncomfortable and it drew her eyes. It was unnatural. Not wanting him to know she was following, she turned slowly and eyed him until he was a few feet away. "You shouldn't do this, Stark," she told herself. It was very foolish to chase after someone when she had a broken arm, because it would be very easy for someone to overtake her. As he turned a corner, Toni picked up her speed, so she wouldn't lose him. When she finally turned the same corner, she noticed him was a few blocks around. "Shit," she cursed.
"Oh, but I can, Rogers," she said as she turned to him. She sauntered over to him with a nasty look in her eyes. "I can't stand you! You think you're damn perfect, but I can deal with that. In fact, I can admire someone for that, but then you try to pretend that you don't think that, and it makes me sick. This whole act makes me sick. "
“Hey, honey we agreed. No contact until we say I do. Is everything okay?” Rhodey could hear the sniffles from Tony indicating he had been crying. Rhodey knew something was wrong.
Life was great until the accords came along.
·       He is 24 years old and was born on August 13.
“He’s excited to meet you too.” Steve blinked not processing what his husband just said.
Several months went by with not much change in his relationship with Steve. At home, life was changing and the boys were helping so much. Peter and Harley were excited, but they also had a lot of questions. Like was their pops was ever coming back home. Tony couldn’t answer that only Steve could.
May 2nd (Tony)
“I can’t do this anymore, Steve. Why can’t you be a better man for me? Why can’t you choose me? I want to feel wanted.” Tony got up and pushed Steve out of the way. He went and gathered all of Steve’s belongings.
“Okay.” Steve squinted his eyes not quite understanding what Tony meant.
I’m fine. I’m fine. Please let that breath out that you have been holding for the last few months. I hit a big leap into the mission, and I wasn’t able to write at all without breaking my cover. I’m sorry that I might have caused you to panic. I never meant to. Can you please forgive? I love the picture you sent. I’m sad that I missed them this year. I’m bummed that I missed a lot in the past seven months. I am really excited about my surprise though. What is it? Is it the new art studio I’ve been asking for? What about a dog? Okay, I will stop guessing. I just can’t wait to see you. That would be enough of a present for me. I just want to see you so badly. I want to taste your lips on mine once more. I miss having you in my arms. I miss everything about you. I love you. Just two more months.
·       He’s basically the perfect guy.
“Anywhere as long as I’m with you. I love you.” Steve kissed the top of Tony’s head and smiled.
·       She pierced her own ears at six.
“I’m so sorry. For everything. I had my head so far up my ass thinking I was right even though at the end of the day it didn’t even matter. I disappointed my team, the nation, but worst of all I let down my family.” Steve stayed on the ground crying not willing to move. All the anger was zapped out of Tony’s body. All he wanted was to bring the love of his life back home. He wanted his family back together. Tony carefully walked down the steps, wrapping his arms around Steve. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s legs and stayed there for a while.
·       They are geniuses and all they do is study and read.
“Did you ever love me? Was I just a plaything to you? You punched a hole in your punch card. Marked off a name on your list.” Tony asked.
“Why don’t you want to go my little one?” Tony pulled the cover back so he could see his son’s face better.
“Surprise!” Tony whispered. Steve nodded without saying a word. Tony gestured for him to come closer. Steve did as asked. He slowly walked afraid that his legs would give out from under him. Steve took a deep breath and smiled.
“Yes, but I need to call Rhodey.” Steve shook his head understanding. He let Tony go and Tony made his way outside so that the call was between the two.
“Wait, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked that.” Steve stood up and walked over to the counter adjacent to Tony as not to push him away any farther. Tony kept his back turn towards him fiddling with an empty bottle in his hands.
“Really, are you trying to make my life miserable? It wasn’t bad enough you came here three months ago throwing a wrench in my relationship because I realized I still have feelings for you.” Steve stood in the doorway shocked at what Tony was saying. At the same time, he wanted this to happened.
Is this how I am supposed to start a letter? I am never really know-how. So, it’s been a week since you’ve been gone. I miss you a lot but at least I still have your t-shirts that I wear everywhere. How’s the mission? Please don’t tell me too much detail until you get back in one piece or I will just worry more. I’m so bad at this. I really wish I knew what to write but I’m terrible at words. That was always your thing darling. I did attach some photos. One is of dummy. He really misses you which who could blame him. Another one is of the team. They wanted to wish you luck. Bucky is pissed that he didn’t go with you but a last he and Natasha have their mission to attend. Lots of kisses. I love you and please be safe.
·       He is gay and still looking for the right one. He struggles to find love when you compare every relationship to your parents. Nothing could ever compare to their love story.
It’s your birthday today. I bet you probably forgot because you are super busy. I know it's super weird, but I was craving cake and it’s your birthday, so I made it. Okay no I bought a cake for your birthday. It’s your favorite too. Yellowcake with chocolate frosting. I will save you a piece for when you get back. Speaking of your birthday I have a surprise for you. I feel like you will be really surprised with your present. It’s not here yet but it should arrive when you get back. It’s kind of on backorder. Don’t worry it will totally be worth the wait for when I see the look on your face when you see it. The team is doing amazing but it's so boring here. Miss my right-hand man. How’s the mission? No progress at all. Please tell me you at least found the base. I miss you a little more today than ever before. Your face is all over the news and they are throwing you a parade down in Brooklyn. I just wish the real thing was here with me. I miss your arms around me. I’m sending a picture of the fireworks outside. They are all red, white, and blue this year. I love you and please come home in one piece.
“Wait, Rogers, you're telling me that you got to meet the Queen of England just because you are the nicest guy in the world.” Steve cackled throwing a hand over his chest. Tony smiled loving the sound that came from the other man.
Life was amazing for fourteen years. Steve and Tony were happily married. Peter was so smart and such a great kid. Then not even a year after they had Peter, Harley was born. He was a wild child but in a more curious way. He and Peter were always getting in trouble like brothers do. Steve and Tony continued being heroes. They couldn’t give it up and their kids loved telling everyone that their dads were superheroes. Everything was amazing until it wasn’t.
·       He played football in school which was an American school.
·       He also is a partier. Sometimes he can be kind of like a frat boy but not in a bad way.
“Yeah, I am. Besides we got to get ready for your baby sister’s arrival.” Steve smiled. Peter pulled back and grabbed Steve’s hand to drag him into the house.
·       Brooklyn is a dreamer but also a futurist like her dad. She is ten steps ahead of everyone and get herself out of trouble.
“Wait you still have feelings for me,” Steve said.
·       Ivan is the sweetest and sensitive man you will ever meet. He will cry at a Hallmark commercial.
·       She is the youngest of the Barnes group.
I get what you mean these letters really do take forever to get here. I was a little worried something had happened but then your letter came, and I could finally breathe. Also, why couldn’t you tell me about Bucky and Natasha before you left? Of course, they have been going at it like rabbits. Have seen the looks they give each other. Those are our looks. It’s been pretty quiet here. I’ve been staying in the office a lot more. Got a lot of Avenger’s paperwork to do so, haven’t really been in the field lately. If I tell you the truth, I don’t really miss it. Weird right. The tower is so quiet with everyone gone on their own missions. Rhodey is coming into town for a little bit. I wish you were here though. I miss our movie nights. I really want to watch Star Wars, but it isn’t the same without you. Sending a few more photos. One is with Clint stuck in the trash can. Don’t ask how that happened. The other one is of New York. The lights are so pretty. I miss you so much.  Only five more months.
·       Steve and Tony picked Brooklyn based on Steve’s hometown and Margaret to honor Peggy.
·       She enjoys writing and even had some of her poems published.
“Want to meet your sister.” Peter and Harley just stared at her in awe. She was so tiny with her blond hair and bright blue eyes.
“What if tonight, you call Bucky and tell him you won’t be coming home. You could stay here with me.” Steve rubbed his hands down his face. He could feel the pressure mount in his temples. It wasn’t like he didn’t want to stay here with Tony tonight or forever, but things were complicated. It was like Tony didn’t understand that.
·       Fluent in English, Italian, French, and know a little bit of Russian thanks to his aunt and uncle.
“Flight 219 has landed. Your soldiers are coming home.” Tony held a sign up saying welcome home Captain Rogers. He bounced from one foot to another unable to stay in one spot. His man was finally coming home.
“Okay, Tony, you are doing great. Push.” Tony did as told.
“Sex. We should have sex. Like right now.” Steve placed the plate in his hand on the counter and gave Tony a perplexed look.
“Last one. Wrap before you tap next time Rogers.” Steve looked over at Tony in shock. Peter and Harley were completely grossed out.
·       Him and his dad are super close. They do everything together. So, does him and his uncle Sam. The three of them will go on all kinds of adventures. They often find themselves at baseball games.
“Yeah, sure one day. In a couple of years so I can save some money up to give you the perfect wedding you deserve.” Tony liked the idea even though he could go down to the courthouse and get married. Tony sat up and lean over Steve to grab a silver ring from the drawer.
“Are you sure?” Tony nodded pulling Steve close for a kiss. All of what happened to them in the past several years just melted away. They pulled away. Steve looked down at Tony’s growing belly. Tony grabbed hold of Steve’s hand and place his where the baby was moving. Steve looked up at Tony in awe.
“You just couldn’t wait another week which was supposed to be your actual birthday. You wanted to meet your daddy so badly. You missed him, didn’t you? Yeah, I missed him too.” Tony smiled not breaking eye contact with Steve.
“I’m sorry that must have been really hard for you.” Tony didn’t mean to sound as gleeful as he did. Steve shook his head no and picked up Tony’s hand sending shocks through his body. He didn’t pull away even though he knew he should have as he kept looking at the ring on his finger.
As each soldier was reunited with their family Tony was still standing alone. Where was Steve? Right as he asked that question his soldier was walking towards him. Tony dropped the sign and ran straight into his arms. Steve gathered him tight, kissing him hard. Missing the taste of Tony and his touch.
“But dad I want to go see pops.” Peter pleaded.
“Well, I’m like a week past due and it doesn’t seem like it will change anytime soon. We tried everything but having sex.” Tony shrugged. Steve just gritted his teeth feeling slightly unsure about this.
“Yes, Tony, I’m sure. Would you like to hear some options you may have?” The doctor placed a hand on his knee trying to comfort him the best she knew how. Tony placed his head in his hands not able to really concentrate on everything that was going on.
·       Freya is super sweet but also very quiet. She lives in her mind a lot and often forgets to interact with others. She never would do anything out of line.
“You’re pregnant, Tony? How?” Steve was shocked and couldn’t process what was being said to him.
“I love you more every day since I met you. How could you ever think I don’t?” Tony’s heart skipped a beat. Tony looked into Steve’s eyes wanted to see the sparkle in them but there was no shine. His eyes didn’t match the words he was speaking. Tony pulled his hands back and crossed them over his chest.
·       She also took some courses at NYU but got bored. She was already a published writer what was a college-going to teach her.
“Okay?” Tony nodded.
The wedding never came instead two more tours happened. Tony didn’t know if he could do this anymore. He missed Steve all the time and he was so worried that he would one day get the message of someone saying the love of his life would never be coming back. Tony sat at his desk finishing up some paperwork when he got a knock on his door. He laid down his pen not knowing who was at the door. Tony opened the door to find two military men standing in his doorway. His legs began to shake, and tears welled in his eyes. No, it couldn’t be he thought his worst nightmare had became true.
“Hey, the food will be here soon.” Pepper stopped in the door seeing what Tony was doing. Pepper just gestured at the mess but not questioning anything. Tony gathered all the stuff up and threw it in the trash.
“Steve.” Steve didn’t turn around but instead focused on the hem of his shirt. It was easier this way.
“No, everyone thinks I’m weird because I know more stuff than they do. One kid called me cocky last year. I would rather stay here with you and papa and Brookie. Please daddy.” Tony turned his head towards the window. He knew James was right. Honestly Tony would rather have him here and Tony would teach him but he also had a job. Steve had a job too and it was enough to deal with a barely one-year-old but also a seven-year-old. Maybe today wouldn’t be so bad to have him here and tomorrow they could figure something else out.
Unlike her brother, she graduated from school at eighteen. She took dual enrollment classes and extra courses. She participated in sports like cheer and soccer. She was raised completely different than her brother since she doesn’t really reminder when her parents were Captain America and Iron man. They were just her dad and pops.
'Steven, don’t. Please just explain. Why didn’t you tell me you wanted to join? You know I would have supported you, but this is hard to process. You’re telling me I won’t be able to see you, touch you, talk to you for two years.” Tony tried to take a deep breath, but air wouldn’t come. His hands shook with fear for the man he loved. Tony fell to his knees unable to take the feeling of soul-crushing news anymore. Tears fell down his face as he sobbed. The feeling of strong arms wrapping around him helped him catch his breath, but the sobbing continued. He couldn’t imagine his world without Steve.
·       He was a really sick kid like Steve and was even born prematurely. The super soldier blood that was in him didn’t kick in until he was ten which was a miracle for his parents.
·       Her personality can turn most people away. Some would say she was scary and very intimidating, but she would say she knew what she wanted and how to get it.
·       James has above average IQ and ended up graduating Highschool at the age of fourteen like his old man. Steve wasn’t thrilled that his son didn’t get to grow up like a completely normal child. Instead of shipping him off to some boarding school or to college before he was mature enough. Steve homeschooled him on combat training, cooking, and other life lessons.
“I love you too.”
·       Theo needs everything to be precise and nothing can be moved or out of place. Growing up Arne would often prank him by moving a book or picture frame. This would drive him insane.
“You know, we shouldn’t see it each other before our wedding. Its bad luck.” Rhodey laughed placing a kiss in the crook of Tony’s neck. Tony tried playing along. He felt terrible having second thoughts about even getting married tomorrow. After Steve had come to visit three months early Tony was having some changed feelings. IT wasn’t like he didn’t love Rhodey. He did very much; Rhodey was one of his best friends but Rhodey wasn’t Steve. He wasn’t Steve.
“Want anything to drink? Beer?” Steve nodded sitting quietly. He didn’t really know what he was doing there. Steve came to visit Bucky and Sam after deciding to travel after hurting Tony. That was the last thing he ever wanted to do, and he did. Steve still remembered the night. He didn’t like to but that was his curse right.
·       He talks to James a lot and Kat. They were the terrible three growing up. James was the voice of reason since he didn’t want to get in trouble with his pops, but Arne and Kat didn’t care.
