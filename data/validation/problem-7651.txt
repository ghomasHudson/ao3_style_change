“Then I’ll do it myself,” Tony told him once he’d pulled himself together. “Have you seen
“He had nothing to do with this,” Hammer said in a bored tone, “there, happy? I did your job for you, you’re welcome. Speaking of jobs, I gave you something to do yesterday. Have you done it?”
Tony took his group in a less-than-linear tour of the zoo. Instead of trying to collect an animal for every letter of the alphabet, or draw an animal at every enclosure, he encouraged the kids to think about why the animals looked so different. They didn’t need to draw the whole animal, but he asked them to try to capture what seemed to be the most unique aspect of every animal, what feature they had developed in order to survive.
“Not Tony,” Tony growled playfully, and try as he might to resist, Steve laughed against Tony’s smirking lips.
“What?” she mumbled with a little hiccup in her voice.
Sumeet, who had been attentively peering at the nearby giraffe being fed, turned to the group and asked, “Mr. Tony, do giraffes use their horns to fight?”
“Steve!”
Except, he had no voice, and no words adequately meaningful came to mind. Before he knew it, Tony had climbed into the flatbed and gotten on his knees at Steve’s feet. When he leaned in close enough to kiss, Steve neither shied away or grimaced at the sweat and grime.
“Yesterday’s clothes Steve? Really?” he muttered in undertone. “Suspect or not, Stark is still connected to the case.”
As expected, Belova’s loud moans attracted a small audience of analysts who surreptitiously found reasons to gather near Tony’s station. Once the wet sound of kissing and the hitching cries of pleasure came over the speakers, having others there holding their breath in audience of Bond’s performance made it easier for Tony to remember that this was for work.
Not two minutes later, his phone rang. A part of Steve wanted to confront him, but most of him wanted to hide and live in the magic of their budding, two-month-old relationship just one day longer. One more week and they would make it to three months, and that was what, five years in Hollywood-time?
“Steve, hurry up or I’m going to get loud—”
Who reached for whom first was a mystery - Tony launched himself at Steve at the same time as Steve grabbed him by his suit jacket and hauled him into a hungry, biting kiss. He palmed at Tony like he hadn’t held his boyfriend in months rather than days, and soon he crouched enough to get his arms around Tony’s thighs and lifted Tony into his arms. Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist, rolling his hips up against Steve’s firm abs with such fervent interest that Steve had to pull off his lips to gulp down air.
“A lot of them groom their sugar babies for lucrative careers,” Tony told the group as the rest of them got to their feet and started to pack up for the night. “Ask about internships or jobs that sound too good to be true.”

“If you show Mr. Tony how good you can be today, and how well you have learned your multiplications tables,” Steve said in a steady, patient voice, “I will talk to the principal and see if we can’t make room for Mr. Tony on the trip next week.”
“What? No,” Steve scoffed with a good-natured roll of his eyes. “I go here.”
“This is so good,” he mumbled around his mouthful. “First thing we do after your shirtless scene, we’re going out for burgers and booze.”
“Tony, who designs these rehabilitation programs? Who has access to those computers?”
“Thor was helping me in preparation for the piece we talked about this morning,” he told Yinsen directly. “It’s about relationships—how, the uh, the stages of a relationship, and how men navigate them. We were thinking,” he added, reaching to put a hand on Thor in case it wasn’t clear whom he was referring to, “our readers should know how tricky men can be. They are not just simple creatures who need sex all hours of the day. Men are manipulative and fragile. Don’t you think our readers could benefit from the strategies men use to get their way? Everyone from Cosmo to Teen Vogue talks about spicing things up in the bedroom, but how will they learn the different circumstances, strategies, and—and warning signs of men who use relationships rather than, uh, nurture them?”
“Detectives, Mr. Stark to see you,” the officer said before leaving them to handle the awkward conversation on their own. Bucky gaped after the damn traitor, while Steve could only stare at Tony. Handsome Tony in his fitted jeans and bundled up in silk, cashmere, and leather. Steve’s fingers itched to explore the divine textures of his luxurious sweater, his silken scarf, and the contrast of his soft, smooth skin with his meticulously shaped beard.
hahahahahahahahahahahaha!! Omg i love the idea that steve rogers woke up and decided, i know we might end up with that orange dumpster fire for another four years BUT WHAT IF WE HAD AN EVEN BETTER TONY STARK ASS
Steve focused on his voice to anchor himself in the present. Tony was his choice; this was a man he wanted. When Tony’s thrusts soon became uncoordinated and desperate, Steve pushed back to reciprocate his interest. It was the final straw. Tony thrust into him one final time and came with a strangled cry that Steve thought might have been his name.
“‘ll be dreaming of you,” Steve whispered into Tony’s soft hair. “You ‘n your hips.”
Chris beamed in his excitement over the story, then, more shyly, glanced at Steve. “How about your new favorite toy?”
Tony blinked, watching him genuinely muse on the question.
“What the hell?” he muttered, glancing between Rhodes and the back of Steve’s head. “Tony knows his dad’s racist as hell, right?”
If burgers made him sick to his stomach, Tony couldn’t bear to watch Steve and Natasha’s reunion. How could Steve so freely share his body with these people? He shook hands, he hugged snotty children, he kissed unclean faces.
Steve laughed - genuinely laughed. It wasn’t even about the information she had shared, or feeling in on some campus secret, like he was suddenly one of the cool kids.
“I’ll text if anything changes,” Tony agreed, calling after Bruce as he headed for the door. Then he turned to Thor, and asked, “You remember the plan, right?”
The super-soldier duo took one weekend to clear out Steve’s private gym, sneak away to IKEA, then wait for that minor window of opportunity where Tony passed out in his lab to secret the offending budget furniture to their floor. They made sure to cover their asses by swearing JARVIS to secrecy, who agreed it was best to spare Sir the pain of knowing his prized Tower housed furniture assembled with axle wrenches and little wooden pegs. Besides, Tony fortunately had no reason to see Bucky’s bedroom; if JARVIS didn’t rat them out, he’d never have to know.
Steve didn’t even try to catch his come in his palm, stroking Tony off through the very last spasms of his orgasm with his cock pointed right at the book spines facing them.
Tony rolled his eyes and gave him a dry look in return, looking as unimpressed as a man holding back a smirk could possibly look. “I’m not feeling very willing to do anything right now, Steve. What is this place you picked? Ten bucks per eclair?”
“Another time,” Natasha promised, and with a final squeeze of Stephanie’s shoulder, she stepped back and looked at Tony. “Tony? You wanted to tell Stephanie something?”
“...no,” Tony said after a beat of silence where his blood was too busy rushing to turn his face red to form any words. “Uh, what are the odds you, you know, that you’d believe that I don’t get my kicks from letting my dog chew on butt plugs and then let her parade them in public for all of Brooklyn to see?”
But, he wanted to try. Tony often went out of his way to find ways of bringing excitement into their relationship, and the least Steve could do was try.
“And you know exactly what you did,” Steve pointed out without sympathy. Tony giggled shamelessly at the reminder of what an asshole he could be to work with, mostly because everyone but Steve had no choice but to deal with him, and Steve held his breath to listen. He could have basked in the warmth of Tony’s laughter all day.
Tony purred softly in reply. “If I don’t remember, will you talk me through it?”
“I am not as generous as you, my love,” Tony hedged before daring to accept Steve’s suggestion. “Would you forgive me if I won?”
As soon as the door was shut behind them, Bucky wasted no more time with polite formalities. He took the king by his elbow and towed him to the nearest office. The office had been cleared of its intended occupant so that Bucky and Steve could use the room in private.
“Hey, don’t underestimate gummi rings,” Tony accused even as he had to pinch his lips in a firm line to keep from giggling at Steve’s befuddled expression. “They’re sweet, flexible. Stackable!”
Steve frowned, and for possibly the first time in recorded history, Tony immediately shut his mouth. None of it was new information and they both knew Steve’s memory was super-human; there was no need for a recap.
“Mostly detectives do paper work,” Steve replied dryly, packing one letter back into its envelope and marking it as harmless. Tony’s lips curved up into a bashful grin, but he didn’t look away from Steve as he waited and listened. Steve watched him for a minute, then calmly elaborated. “How’s it going, Mr. Stark? Found anything?”
“Mr. Stark’s office, how may I help you?”
“I know. I love you, too,” Steve promised him, and when he finally got Tony out of his clothes, he gently lifted Tony into his arms and carried him to the bathroom. He waited for Tony to toe at the water himself without sounding like he’d been scalded to lower Tony into the tub.
Steve bit his lip to keep from laughing and quickly brought his hand up to cup over Tony’s mouth. Tony only grinned up at him at first, but it wasn't long before they were both laughing about it.
“Stand up, come on,” Tony whispered and reached for him, helping him find his feet. “How about a shower? You'll feel better.”
He could hear the water still running, and by the time he opened his eyes, Steve had washed off the plug and was drying it off.
Clint coughed and tossed his head, repulsed by the taste of whatever Stephanie was pushing on him. “What—that was liquid shit! Why did you give me—oh, gods, you sure it wasn’t poison?” he asked in the end, a little more seriously.
“You know,” Tony called to him, “I was gonna say, you look damn handsome this morning, but right now you look kinda goofy.”
Steve gritted his teeth and hung his head, lifting his hips again in an effort to clear his head. Almost done, he was almost done. One more crack, two at most, and Tony would be as good as new and out of his hair and nobody would have to suffer.
“You know who I am, boy,” Howard snarled, eyeing Steve like he was something filthy stuck to the bottom of his shoe. “What are you, the flavor of the month? Go get Tony.”
“With you? Yeah… yeah, someday,” he whispered with a nervous excitement that spoke volumes of how eager he was to share his
“….well, yeah. She’s cursed, but she’s a different cursed person, man,” Clint eventually said. “I—you mean, she didn’t tell you?”
“So?”
“Mmmno,” Tony purred with an intimate smile, “I demanded—
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve grimaced a little at that, and instead suggested, “Bold?”
She didn’t need to finish the sentence, Tony simply nodded and promised he’d keep an eye on her bag until she got back. For a second, he wondered if he could make it over to Steve Rogers and test the waters before Jane got back - if nothing else, to confirm that he was straight so Tony wouldn’t lose sleep imagining that broad, powerful back bearing down on him, or those beautiful, expressive lips wrapped around his cock. Tony’s measly string of exes may have been passable in bed, but none of them had the natural charisma Steve casually exuded with his friends, with the brave women approaching him (and his not unattractive friends), or with Jane. Steve had a friendly smile to spare for everyone, and Tony was so caught up in his fantasies that his eventual double-take when he realized
“A little at a time, okay?” then the straw was back against his lips. Tony looked really concerned but Steve wouldn’t break it, but he was very gentle with the straw anyway if it made Tony happy. Tony should always be happy. Why wasn’t he smiling again?
(Personal YAY for first time use of texting in fic - I had such a good time with it that apparently now I can't stop using it! HA =D)
“No, I’m not, but if you can’t focus, you’re not the boss of anyone either. So get up, Tony, eat lunch. Be back in two hours.”
“I have a spear,” Tony told him, his voice lowered into a threat. “Don’t make me use it.”
Tony agreed before she got too insistent, and quickly gestured for Steve to follow. He led their way to the kitchen, but rather than lingering and talking to anyone, he told his mom they’d eat in the bedroom, excusing them as quickly as he could.
idk is it worth tony being sad?
They got their beers, a sandwich to share, and tempura sweet potato fries, then made their way to their seats with about fifteen minutes to spare. The pre-show game was on the jumbo screen and classic rock music played in the background to pump up the crowd. The players were already out on the ice warming up.
“This is making less sense the more you explain,” Steve told her after a beat. “Do they still serve burritos?”
Talking with his friends made Steve feel less lonely, but he still felt distracted and lost at sea. He threw himself into his overlooked class assignments and did his best to pick apart the case ...except he kept getting distracted by the gold ring hidden in his desk drawer. It wasn’t anything special, and since the rings hadn’t cost them anything in addition to the seventy-eight dollar marriage ceremony, Steve was fairly sure it was a cheap knock-off that would turn green given half a chance.
“What better time to learn?” Tony countered happily, gesturing at the wide open road. The I-90 ran one lane north and one lane south, and the highway was practically abandoned. “No passing, no merging, no clutch. Just point and click. Besides, it’s a rental: we’re insured to the gills.”
“Why don’t you put rocks in your pockets and jump in a river?” Tony snapped, then he raised his voice to be heard over Bond’s laughing. “Command on standby. Good luck, 007.”
“You’re ridiculous,” Steve laughed, and leaned in to press his lips against Tony’s in a slow, tender kiss.
“Ookay, I think that’s enough, I’ll take that,” he heard Tony say as he phone exchanged hands. “Hey, babe? You’re wanted by Nina again, something about fixing your make-up.”
Steve wanted to scream. He wanted to curse, to call her names, punch Brock in the mouth for letting anybody talk about him that way.
“Help yourself, it’s too much for me anyway,” Tony promised, and who was Steve to ever decline mac and cheese? Tony carved up the last of the chicken and put half on Steve’s plate before pulling up his own stool.
“Now will you come back to sleep?” Tony wondered, pulling him down a little more insistently. “I can’t really sleep like this, not with you hovering.”
Tony blushed at the way Steve said his name again, but rather than correcting him, Tony quickly hid his face behind his hand under the guise of rubbing his nose. “I am not so familiar,” he said quietly, “though I have heard sarcasm was a quality attributed to your generation. However, your valid point remains, Steve Rogers. Every minute we rest is another minute that unpleasant criminal plagues our city. As you say, Captain: in tick tocks. Be well.”
“Tony,” Steve said with a grin, gesturing to Bucky. “This is Bucky. We’ve been friends since… what was it, fifth grade?”
With one hand firmly spreading Tony’s cheeks apart, Steve rubbed his warm, lubed middle finger down the seam of his exposed crack. The young, perky flesh was taut and supple under the pressure of his fingers, and by the time Steve’s wet thumb rubbed and teased his perineum through his glove, Tony was already moaning his interest and his pleasure.
He could do this.
“What if I stay?” he asked in a sudden revelation, watching Bucky with a manic desperation. “I stay, I don’t leave the safety of my room: you take everyone and help find Tony. Please, Buck, you—if I can’t go, please, you have to, he could be in danger, please.”
But that was expected. What wasn’t expected was Mr. Perfect, laughing softly under his breath.
“Taobe,” Steve said in a slow, calm tone of voice, “I remember. You are here with your mother.”
Stubborn as he was, Tony couldn’t bear to look away, he never wanted to look away even as his eyes rolled back in his head from the overwhelming pleasure. But Steve knew him enough to know that even if he looked calm, Tony wasn’t necessarily composed on the inside. He felt Tony’s orgasm building him into a frenzy in the way his loose, stretched rim pulsed like it wanted to draw his fingers in, in the tremble of Tony’s spread thighs, and in the tight arch of his foot and curl of his toes, until suddenly it overtook him like a crashing wave, something he clearly saw coming but still wasn’t prepared for.
“Ma’s gonna kill me.”
Smug as can be, Maria didn’t say a word. She didn’t need to.
Two months passed in relative peace and comfort before Tony’s life took a strange turn. On one unremarkable afternoon, two men in black suits, black shades, black shoes, black ties, and bad attitudes showed up at his office.
The full force of the children’s pleading little puppy-dog faces turned on Steve, and he almost crumbled right then and there like a complete amateur.
“My mom was against any kind of flashy, colorful ring, because it’s easier to coordinate outfits with classic looks, but
Steve sat up with a grunt of alarm and tore the helmet off. Tony jumped at the sudden interruption, and a part of Steve intended to crush the unnatural machine between his bare hands until he realized Tony was staring at him with concern. Instead, he quickly put it a safe distance away from himself on the floor, and eyed it with a mixture of anxiety and suspicion.
“Agent. I’m Detective Steve Rogers, I ran the task force. Captain Carter is in a meeting with the Commissioner down at 1PP. She’ll be back by ten.”
“It really comes across, your relationship works great for the movie,” Carl agreed with a smile of excitement. “We really get this sense of tension and rivalry between them through your reactions.”
Steve couldn’t help but smile. “I could do this all day.”
“Your nightmares,” Tony started then a little awkwardly, as if he knew he was walking on eggshells. “You need not speak of them, but if there are ways that I can support you, Steve Rogers, resources I can provide for you or ways that I can help to prevent them, I swear I will not rest until it is done.”
“Sure it is,” Tony drawled, patting and rubbing Steve’s side in consolation. “Ready for Diagon Alley?”
. It only got worse from there.
“Sure, yeah—can I bring anything?”
“I like the way you think,” Bucky agreed with a big, self-satisfied grin. Just to be more of an ass, he turned to Steve and innocently asked, “Steve, when was the last time you had Italian sausage? 1938?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Shoes on and leash in hand, he pulled the door open for his excitable girl. She tap-danced down the stairs and leapt the final step to the pavement, where she stopped to wait for Tony to lock up and trundle down after her.
Steve smiled a little to himself, and instead of thanking Clint, he reached for the nearest sweet potato. They worked together in silence for some time, until the spicey smell of the cooking sausages started to fill the air.
No glares, no groans, no quips.
“You know, actually, Tony and I were talking about you yesterday,” he cleared his throat and took a quick breath, then tried again. “Tony’s schedule is pretty clear this week, and he—
Friedstadt was the highest city in old Machtberg, built on a mountain peak made hospitable by a natural spring. Despite the altitude, it had been one of the earliest cities that attracted large numbers of immigrating families from old Terrini. Many of the early families were goat farmers who brought their livestock with them, and the goats, with their sure footing and stubborn attitudes, thrived in the lush, mountainous landscape around Friedstadt. Like many cities in Machtberg, Friedstadt historically struggled to develop a local agriculture - people were highly educated and unaccustomed to farming, particularly in such mountainous terrain. The families from old Terrini brought with them generations of practical wisdom, and soon after their arrival Friedstadt had local access to nutritious crops and fresh eggs, dairy, and meat.
Brock grabbed the man by his hair and tossed him aside. “Get a life!” he shouted after him, and, terrified, the young man scurried away.
“The end of vital cellular activity and regeneration,” Tony said before Bucky could open his mouth.
“I really am proud of you, you know,” Tony said a few minutes later. “This will be a great role to dip your toes in comedy. At least I’ll be there; I always love laughing at you.”
“Such - an - asshole!” Steve said when he was finally satisfied, struggling not to laugh.
“Why,” Steve breathed, still too shaken to speak. “Why didn’t you say, yesterday?”
“Not connected enough,” she corrected, gently but clearly honest. “They’re business socialites, Steve. He’s their only son, they want him to be with someone who benefits the company.”
Steve’s heart dropped and he stared up at Clint in pale-faced horror. “He was
007 was less of a success. He managed to get Lucy away from Vargas long enough to drive her off a cliff in a high-speed car chase. Tony couldn’t even be mad. Clearly, Bond had made an effort to get his car back, and Lucy’s waterproof engine made it possible for him to escape uninjured from the depths of Rio Buranhém.
But more often than not, Steve used Tony’s cock like he used his ass - ravenous, insatiable, and impatient, like nothing mattered except wringing the orgasm from Tony’s body.
The judge waved him up, and Tony walked up with the prenup, the birth certificate, and her license. He explained what the judge was looking at, what implications it had on the case and the prenuptial agreement.
Sam’s mouth twisted in an expression of doubt, but it was Bucky who voiced it.
After taking two canisters back to back, Tony’s body was both slick and stretched for Steve’s cock. Steve mounted him fast and took him hard, pulling Tony’s pliant body back onto his cock with such force that bruises formed across Tony’s hips where Steve's hands held him fast.
“Checked out,” Steve grunted softly. He paused between every second or third word, wheezing softly under his breath in a most stubborn attempt to contain the agony. “I’m alone.”
Jane responded with a smile, but, thankfully, she said nothing.
Maria’s expression soured with a sympathetic frown, but she said nothing. Somehow, by some bitter twist of irony, that was the nicest thing she’d said to him.
“Captain America?” Bruce repeated slowly, frowning to himself as he tried to recall the old wives' tale. “You glorify that short-sighted, homicidal neanderthal? He was a brute who disobeyed lawful regulation in order to cause great violence and property damage. Tony Stark, some historians even say Captain America...” he abruptly lowered his voice, scandalized by the words he felt compelled to say. “They say he extinguished
Not that Tony could resist watching him walk away and disrobe, shameless in his confidence. To Tony’s surprise and mild regret, Steve wore a pair of swim trunks under his robe, probably in the event that Tony needed privacy to work. Steve made his way to the shallow, serpentine hot tub designed to look like a gentle brook which separated Tony’s office from his more leisurely reading nook.
“You have reached the secure mailbox information for Brock Rumlow,” the computer informed him, but Brock was five steps ahead of it. He had already pulled up the first of four digital messages in his inbox, and photos, maps, transportation networks, and pages of information scrolled across the screen in a blurr.
With careful, gentle fingers, Steve worked on the knots in Tony’s back, pressing soft, adoring kisses to his temple now and then as he reached a particularly tough one to comfort Tony until the knot would finally give and fade away under Steve’s hands.
“You could just ask how he’s doing, you know,” Tony teased, his smile so bright and adoring that there was no doubt of whom he was referring to either. “I watch this show; I know you like him.”
While Tony played host in the kitchen, Steve scanned the living room for a place to sit. The couch looked so soft it might swallow him whole, and the arm chairs looked so new and delicately made that he was afraid of breaking them under his weight. He was still standing awkwardly in the middle of the living room when Tony re-entered the room.
“Mr. Stark, you are here to answer a few questions about some recent murders, including one that took place earlier tonight,” Steve informed Tony from across the interrogation room. Bucky loomed behind him, fundamentally committed to his
“Good. Then let’s get you to bed, Tony. That’s enough, Romanov,” Jim told Natasha before the video ended.
“A real gentleman,” Tony promised, or at least that’s what he guessed judging by the way Steve laughed and listened attentively to his friends, didn’t shy away from eye-contact, and exuded a relaxed confidence with every delectable, well-defined muscle in his body. (Or, what of it Tony could see through his fitted Henley anyway.) “Great listener, even better story-teller.”
a serious question—”
“I'm not going to suck his dick!” Tony hissed indignantly, then immediately held his breath to listen for any signs that Steve was eavesdropping on him.
His first customer was anything but discouraged; it smirked up at Tony while it continued its insistent kneading with one hand, and stroked Tony off with the other, fast and practical, unbothered by how the dry scales of its hand might feel on a human cock. Tony’s body jerked desperately, whimpering and begging for them to be more gentle, to go slower, but nothing mattered to Steve or to his customer except for his hard cock that visibly throbbed from the attention, and already coated the alien’s hand with enough precum to drip a puddle to the floor. When the creature finally closed its mouth over the head of Tony’s cock, it bit down just hard enough with its four rows of teeth to make Tony come with a painful scream.
James Rhodes crouched down in front of him. Steve’s head tipped forward. He wanted to hate Rhodes so bad.
Tony opened his mouth to speak, then shut it with an audible click. Then, in a fit of bewilderment, he asked, “How does Winter Wonderland know who Kim Cattrall is?”
Tony never told Steve about his run in with the government. At first it was only because the men in black suits had looked so absurdly cliché, but once Tony was shown R&D’s basement offices at the SIS building and invited to poke around their shiny gadgets and fancy cars, then even introduced to Q himself, it felt wrong to openly talk about it. Instead, Tony let Steve believe he was still working at Imperial College.
: Inspired in 1830 when Peter Cooper learned about the government-supported École Polytechnique in France, Cooper Union was established in 1859. The school was built on a radical new model of American higher education based on founder Peter Cooper's fundamental belief that an education "equal to the best technology schools [then] established" should be accessible to those who qualify, independent of their race, religion, sex, wealth or social status, and should be "open and free to all". Since 1859, they have sincerely committed to the idea of keeping it "open and free for all" by providing all those who qualify full scholarships until 2014 when the economy forced their hand (read the few paragraphs on Wiki if you're interested, I'm incredibly impressed with everything they still did for their students and continue to do), and by last year they committed to returning to return to fully funding ALL undergrads again by 2028.
Clint gaped and blinked his big, brown eyes up at Stephanie until he made sense of what she had asked.
it was a lie—he
“Tony,” Stephanie said with a quiet, but sincere, laugh. “You speak as if you could wield magic. Truly, you amaze me.”
What man was he to turn down that kind of an invitation? Tony pulled his clothes off without any grace or modesty and crawled into bed to plaster himself against Steve’s gorgeous, inviting, and very
“No!” Tony cried as Steve moved to get up, “Steve, damnit—no, this is plenty. End of discussion. So, uh. I’ll go deposit this?” he stalled briefly, and Steve savored his victory. In his rush to stop Steve from giving him
Brock openly stared at him as if he was being obtuse on purpose. “You go where, Steve?”
A dip in the road had Dummy stumbling forward at over thirty miles an hour, and Tony went flying over his neck.
“That would be one way to solve your food shortage,” Steve observed with a smile and a small shrug. “You’d have access to the sea.”
He was frozen in place, staring at the floorboards.
“Carrying water home?” Tony asked rhetorically. “We will direct the water directly into the house: it will not be a pump, but a spout, and from it fresh water will fill any sink or tub. You will never have to carry water again. And, if you wish, build a fire under the bathing water such that you always have warm showers, if you wish it.”
It wasn’t until Tony had fallen asleep and sun had long set that Steve noticed his clocks were on the move. The van was where he had last seen it, but all twelve clocks were scattering across the city at an alarming pace.
Steve couldn’t see the list from his place at the back of the crowd, but some sour anonymous soul who was leaving disappointed frowned at him as they passed and said, “Competition must’ve been easy this year.”
“Right. Sure,” Tony agreed agreeably, not unlike how Steve had agreed to hand over his credit card in the too-recent past. He turned to their grinning audience of three with a pointedly serious look. “Got anything for me to do?”
On a whim, Steve interrupted Tony’s farewell to ask, “Before you left for Vancouver, were you seeing anyone here in New York?”
“I miss you, too,” Tony whispered as Steve wound his arms around him.
“…Steve Rogers?”
Two black fighter jets dove after it in pursuit.
“Without a warrant it’s inadmissible,” she replied, though between the satisfied smirk and calm tone made it clear she wasn’t warning Tony so much as asking him for a suggested loophole.
“And it’s no surprise, so many of these are photographs of you in action. Look at this, here you are, doing lunges with the squirrels.”
“Did you know that Christopher Walken has had the same hair since he first fell in love with Elvis as a young guy?” Tony stage-whispered only a few minutes into the movie. “First of all, a
“I’ll pretend I’m not, but I am,” Steve agreed, and next to him, Tony rolled his eyes.
“Come on,” he panted, patting an open hand at Steve’s nearest leg. “We’re halfway there.”
“Flattering angles, good filters,” she said, counting off the three hallmarks of online dating pictures. “And when all else fails: Photoshop.”
“Outside Porto Seguro, Brazil,” Bond replied. “Mansion, new money. No class; Persian rugs in the bathroom aren’t even hand-woven.”
“You said that already,” Clint observed suspiciously. “Uh, Tony? Maybe you should chew on a turnip or something? You don’t sound right.”
“What part of ‘I choked’ wasn’t in English?”
“Tony? You aren’t, right?”
“Some of them do,” Tony chimed in before Steve had to say anything. “The duck hen is selective, so the drake gets creative. A little rapey. Not just fly-by rapey, but gang-rapey, too. I didn’t tell the kids that,” he quickly promised Steve.
“Sixty.”
Tony willed himself to look at his watch again. Five minutes until this ‘surprise’; fifteen minutes until their fight. He could hold out for five minutes. With another steadying breath, Tony turned in his seat to take in the incredible view of the ocean waves crashing into the craggly, dramatic cliffs below. The trees and little animals they spotted seemed perfectly at ease, clearly (and happily) undisturbed by humans, which made it all the more jarring in the end when they reached a black iron gate.
Tony choked on his beer and just barely got his hand over his mouth before he sprayed it over his couch. “You,” he croaked out, struggling to cough and breathe through the giggle fit that sent his beer down the wrong pipe. “That—
Steve peered at him, then shook his head slowly as he eventually gave up on trying to make sense of what Tony had said. “You lost me, Tony.”
“Steve? Hey, we’re worried about you, you haven’t been answering your phone for hours. Are you even listening to me?” she asked more irritably. “This is serious, Steve. Bucky’s out there with a baseball bat and a short temper looking for you. The Superbros are marching on Boston.”
- until he got to a short stack of four letters that felt unusually malicious. “These… made me uncomfortable. Top one especially.”
Besides the scant handful of posts reminding Tony’s fans of the years that he spent in tight jeans and speedos on Mexican telenovelas, IBD typically devoted its pages to flattering or complimentary candid shots taken by people who spotted Tony on set or wandering around town. And judging by Steve’s bookmarked posts alone, he was intimately familiar with the whole IBD catalog of Tony exercising, whether it was doing uphill lunges, pull-ups at playgrounds, or stretching out after a run. One particularly coveted post commemorated the six months Tony devoted to building 40 pounds of muscle, but Steve had learned the hard way to avoid opening that one in public at all cost.
But tonight, it was about being there for Tony. It was about comfort, unwavering support, and a flight of tequila.
“But he is right,” a voice echoed through the mist, unmistakably feminine and powerful. Clint tossed his head and tried to twist to see where the voice had come from, but he could not see anything through the heavy clouds around them. “You are safe here, and here you will remain.”
It was easier to avoid love and stick with Bucky. Friendship could be enough, right? Who needed romance and love and raising a family and being there every step of the way as gurgling little cherub faces grew into bright and incredible adults? It wasn’t worth watching his lover age and die alone, or watching his children and grandchildren age and fade away and leaving him with the rest of the monuments America built.
Before Tony knew what happened, Steve’s fingers slipped from his sloppy, gaping hole and was immediately replaced by the familiar blunt head of a harvesting canister. He opened his eyes just in time to see that a small mechanical arm had been positioned beneath him to piston the canister up into his body, fucking the canister into him at an angle that directly targeted his prostate. But in difference to the slow, full-length drilling Steve preferred to fuck Tony with at home, this canister was programmed to fuck him quickly in short, shallow strokes.
“We fix this, and you’ll be free tonight?” Tony asked pointedly, putting the phone to his ear while he waited for Thor to pick up.
“Are two fingers too easy for you, sweetheart?” Steve murmured in praise, withdrawing his fingers slowly to pour out more lube on his fingers, getting them well slick before fucking three fingers into him.
Given the divorce rate, there’s a good chance of that.
“Stop. Just, stop,” Bucky said with a quiet sigh before Tony’s ramble really put him to shame. “Thank you, Tony. That’s… nice of you. It smells nice, too.”
It didn’t take long.
“Enhance your calm, Steve Rogers. I will go no farther than the lavatory and I will return in tick tocks.”
Steve jumped in his seat at the sound of Sharon’s voice, his hand shooting straight up to avoid smudging his charcoal figure drawing. It was part of his midterm assignment, a revived memory of Tony lounging in the bed loft of the treehouse under a glass roof and warm sunlight, naked and facing away from view. His fingers curled into a loose fist in his sleep, his hair fell in soft waves around his face, and the long, lean lines of his body whispered of a subtle power others dreamed to possess.
Tony nodded a little, reaching up to brush Steve’s ever-growing hair out of his eyes. “I know.”
,” Tony murmured, and if Steve wasn’t excited before, he was now. After all, comfortable for their preferred night-time activities was about more than just getting undressed. “Thirty minutes, tops. Why don’t you see if anything catches your eye in the toys?”
“Steve!” he shouted, his voice wheezy and frail. “Comms on!”
“That’s who’s staffing the most prestigious lab in your dad’s company?” Steve asked after a beat, clearly less than impressed. Even without their relationship, Steve knew that Stark Industries was a big deal to every branch of the military. But he had also been open about how glad he’d been that Tony was different, that his inventions and patents were more about how to support people than how to arm them.
“Well, then you better appreciate it while it lasts,” Steve replied smartly, doing his best to keep a straight face even when Tony started giggling on the other end. “Listen, I hate to burst your bubble but the minute we move in together and your signature is on that lease, I’m going to start taking you for granted and letting myself go.”
“Seldom,” Steve said wryly. “I shared a wall with my mom, remember?”
A cautious hope rose among the station staff, and as they watched the white police vehicle markers move on the map to converge on the blue dot, the embers of confidence surged into a bright optimism. Their colleagues had the heartless criminal cornered, and soon, their MDK’d friends would be avenged.
In his first event, Steve took on a whole class of twenty first-graders in tug o’ war. He hauled on his end of the rope with all his might, slowly but surely dragging their scrambling little feet and shrieking objections closer and closer to the victory line. Before it was too late, however, the children’s teacher snuck into the mix to give her students a hand. With her added strength the first-graders regained some ground, until Steve made a big show of being overpowered and defeated. Laughing and overjoyed, the children rallied around their teacher and families in their great excitement to have triumphed over the king himself, while Steve happily slunk back to Tony’s open arms.
“I’d love to see him try,” Steve laughed, but he sat up in bed to face Tony. He kept his distance at first, allowing Tony some semblance of security. “Listen, I know it’s not easy, but I am what your people would call an alien. You’re not in your galaxy anymore,” he explained, speaking slowly so Tony wouldn’t be lost. “I will take care of you. You never have to worry about disappointing your sire or anyone else again. And if you let me, I will make you feel more pleasure than you’ve ever felt before.”
But resting his body had allowed Tony’s ass to recover fairly well, and the novice student struggled to force the thick canister past the tight ring of Tony’s hole. At first he only got the tapered head in, but he struggled to thrust hard enough to breach Tony’s body with the full length of the canister.
“Would you support my decision to ask him to leave and return to class only when he is prepared?”
Tony pressed his lips together, visibly containing his instinctive reply from spilling out. It took him a moment, but eventually he nodded in understanding. “I see that now,” Tony replied, speaking so quietly Steve nearly missed his answer. “I was wrong. Steve, I was so wrong, I, I fucked up and I hurt you in the process. I can’t change what’s in the past,” he acknowledged in the end. “But, Steve, I’m telling you. I’ve been trying, I’ve—I’m leaving Stark Industries, Steve. I’m getting out of weapons manufacturing. Renewable, sustainable energy. I can’t promise I won’t fuck up again, or that I’m worth another chance, or. I don’t even know what I’m saying anymore,” he mumbled with a frown to himself, ducking his head as his confidence flagged. “I just know that I fucked up, I lost the best thing that’s ever happened to me, the best person I’ve ever known, and it was for what? Making better bombs?”
“Eighty-five percent,” Steve said with a proud smile, and he sealed the canister to let it roll off somewhere safe in their nest. “You’re a marvel, Tony, you’re getting better every day.”
“We asked you to answer thirty question about yourself,” Karl said in clarification as he and Georgie straightened their respective note cards. “We’ve chosen some questions at random to ask you about each other, and for each correct answer, you win a point.”
Steve didn’t speak for a long time, but Tony could practically see the wheels turning as he considered Tony’s suggested plan.
thing to say,” Steve admitted, a touch sheepish. “Could you get us a different room this time?”
He said it so softly that Tony wasn’t sure he was meant to hear it. Tony pressed a chaste, lingering kiss to Steve’s cheek before straightening in Steve’s lap to watch his face more carefully.
Somewhere between headlines disagreeing about Jennifer Aniston’s newest beau and something about English royalty, Bucky saw Steve. The photo was grainy, unposed, and poorly lit, but it was so clearly Steve glaring into the candid photo with Tony wrapped in his arms.
Tony laughed from somewhere in the house, and he soon appeared out of the kitchen. “Are you referring to yourself in the third person again?”
“Your kind are… fragile, volatile,” Steve said honestly, turning them down a path and leading them through a looming archway into a grey mountainside. “Besides, you are only viable for so long.”
“I did, too,” Steve said in a stilted tone, and Tony frowned at Thor and Bruce immediately. The two of them were only looking back at him, wide-eyed, and struggling to keep themselves quiet. “Actually, that’s sort of why I was calling. I have tickets to the Rangers game tonight, and, I know it is short notice, but I was wondering if you would like to join me.”
“Not really,” Steve admitted after an uncomfortable pause. “It was late, we were dead on our feet. Nothing’s really happened since then.”
This time, Steve frowned. It took him some time before he dared to shake his head no.
“Please, Steve,” he begged with a quiet sob, “please, please fuck me, I can’t—I need it, fuck me, Steve, please.”
“—Thanks, Stark, that’s—I get it, thank you,” Steve interjected with a wave of his hand and a tired sigh. “What about last names?”
“Tony, thank god it’s you.”
After all, if Machtberg tradition was to mean anything, they had started their new year as they intended to finish it: together. Steve’s glum expression gradually lifted, until eventually he smiled, bashful in his eager hope.
Tony shuddered at the thought, and didn’t dare to ask how they had learned that whatever those poor species were could survive acid baths. Instead, he asked, “Why are there no… humans?”
, Steve. I was,” he insisted, lowering his voice to a gentler tone. “You asked me for a second chance yesterday. I’m asking you for a second chance today.”
“You know I’ve already forgiven you, right?” Tony said when Steve made yet another benign, pleasant comment about the scenery passing them by along the Portuguese coastal highway.
DO NOT engage! Wait for me
Steve leaned after him, chasing those sinful lips he’d never before dared to dream he could touch. But Tony pulled back, not far, but enough that Steve couldn’t reach him. It took Steve a moment to recover and realize that his body was getting ahead of his tongue.
“What can I say?” Tony wondered out loud, making a show of considering something he was never going to share. “Steve’s latest project took us to Lisbon for six months and he had a lot of night shoots, which meant I was often a solo tourist. I fell in love with Lisbon and Portugal—I love the people, the food, the art, the history, the nature - it got to where anytime Steve couldn’t fall asleep, he’d ask me about what new tiles I’d seen that day and I would talk for thirty, maybe forty minutes before realizing he was snoring. Worked better than Ambien,” he said with a fond grin that he valiantly tried to disguise as a frown.
“Computer, describe rehabilitation training assigned to Brock Rumlow.”
Although Dunn’s former neighbors agreed on what his nurse looked like, they had no other information about the young man who visited their neighbor multiple times a week. Like most neighbors in big cities, Dunn stuck to idle chit chat about the weather or slow elevators. Nobody recalled seeing him with other people, either. No women in his life, no children, no friends. From the records on file, Steve and Bucky learned that Dunn had been married briefly in his youth, but they had no children, his nearest sibling lived in Pennsylvania, and his ex-wife had moved to Georgia soon after their divorce.
Rhodey threw his hands up in frustration and pointed aggressively at Tony, as if Steve didn’t know to whom he was referring. “Six feet, Steve: tip to tip, that bull’s horns were six fucking feet.”
Steve glanced in the direction of the bull, then looked back at Tony. “How about you take the reins tonight?”
“How dare you speak to me that way?” he glowered, indignant and even louder than before. “Steve! Are you going to let him just get away with talking to me like that?”
“Aren’t you… you know, too big?” he asked, a sentiment Sam seconded by saying, “You got more muscles than any of the victims.”
“And I will miss you very, very much,” Steve said with a big smile in his voice. “For twelve whole days until my internship starts. Did I tell you my place doesn’t have AC? Not that it’ll matter, I’ll be at work the hottest hours of the day, but
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT
“We don’t have a leader, we work together,” Bucky told him, then a little more gently, he said, “Natasha is here, too, Steve. But if it’s her he’s after… he’s in for a world of pain.”
Tony pursed his lips and considered his brother with a suspicious, narrow-eyed look. “Gammy’s eightieth?”
“Except I won’t have to wonder, because I will
Sarah sighed softly into his hair. “Alright, angel. Tell it in the order that makes most sense.”
“I will explain when we are not in public, Jane Foster,” Tony whispered, then turned back to Steve to say, “were the three seashells not available?”
“I don’t get paid enough for this,” Tony muttered to himself in the ten, fifteen seconds it took for the lock to
“And you
while he dug through his drawer of similar looking white bottles, ointments, lotions, and novelty condoms (when did that get in there?) in the hopes that he still had some band-aids lying around. “It’s normal, it’s just a little blood.”
“Why did you tell her?” she asked. “You could’ve waited a week when you’re dating the guy or something.”
Steve frowned, but eventually replied. “I couldn’t. They were out of toilet paper.”
“Can break spell, not curse. Can ward against everything,” Natasha said, and with another sip of hot water, she finally started to sound more like a person. “Stephanie, she was cursed because she wanted to help me. When she found me, she stayed with me. She was my first friend in, in centuries.”
“Hi, Tony,” Steve said with a smile, leaning back comfortably in his seat. “I’m Steve. Before anything else, I gotta ask: is this a typical night out for you?”
“Got it,” Steve promised, because how complicated could it get?
To all of you who responded to the first chapter and shared your ideas and suggestions with me, I can't thank you enough!! Thank you so much for your response to this fic! I hope it continues to be an enjoyable read for you all! <33
Steve gave him a long-suffering look, but said nothing.
Apropos of nothing, Steve announced, “I’m gonna turn to the left and floor it.”
“Guess that means I’m down to only two reasonable explanations now,” Tony confessed, laughter still bright in his eyes.
This time, Steve wasn’t as kind. A quick glance down at the display told him his job was 70 percent done. Rather than pulling out and allowing Tony a moment’s rest, Steve reached for the hidden controls and turned off the option for vibrations. In their place, Steve turned up the option for ridges and knobs. So soon after his second orgasm, and with the canister already buried so deep inside his body, Tony gave a strangled cry when he felt the uneven knobs knuckle up inside of him, and his body bowed off the bed.
“Is that what you want?” Steve wondered, shifting a little in his seat to face Tony better. Tony kept his eyes on the road, but his frown made it clear he was confused by the question. “A family? Maybe some goats.”
Steve turned to see what Tony had whispered, but before he could ask, Tony’s pale, stricken face gave him pause.
Natasha hesitated a moment longer to give her a chance to change her mind, then stood up to address the judge. “Your Honor, those terms are acceptable.”
Steve’s smile faded then, and he ducked his head briefly as if to think it over. Except, he had already spent hours worrying over the same question.
“Listen,” Tony said, smiling but serious. “Steve and I were talking yesterday, and we thought—he’s got guest rooms, we wanted to invite you to the city. Why don’t you and Laura come this summer, get out of the heat? We’ll plan something nice.”
If bed sharing was expected of him, this terrible night was going to take a turn for the even worse.
, Tony couldn’t say. “Uh, my, uh,”
“Registration,” Steve explained simply, and draped an arm around Tony’s waist in an effort to make him feel safe. “Anyone might try to take a prize like you away from me, Tony, and I can’t have that.”
“Fuck. You’re making
Tony snickered vindictively from his comfortable sprawl in a nearby armchair. “That’s why they pay you the big bucks,” he pointed out before taking a big, ravenous bite of his juicy cheeseburger. Ketchup and mayonnaise spilled out over his fingers, and as he chewed his first bite, Tony closed his eyes and dramatically moaned his delight.
Forgetting his questions and his confusion, Steve focused on what mattered and scribbled the address down on a piece of paper. He shot Maria a text to ask her to please cover for him in class that afternoon, then bolted for his car.
“No!” Bruce and Tony shouted as one, startling Thor into silence. The stricken look of betrayal in his big, watery eyes made startling a drunk Thor feel like kicking a puppy, but given the circumstances they didn’t have time for his recounting of any glorious sexcapades.
Steve must have been unresponsive for too long, because the next thing he knew, Bucky wandered into the kitchen and wondered if Steve was still a bad kisser.
“Been thinking of me?” Tony smirked up at Steve, and even as he blushed, Steve rolled his eyes and huffed in amusement.
Not that the reason mattered. Tony was offering to spend more time with him, and if there was anything Steve needed after months of being seen as a helpless invalid, it was a chance to prove to Tony that he was fighting fit. Or, more to the point, fucking fit.
enough to make into a costume. He barely had his towel on still by the time he reached the door, and it only struck him that he could have asked Bruce for something when he came face to face with Tony, in a dazzling tuxedo and a porcelain half-mask.
“Steve: outside of Iron Man, what is Tony’s dream role?”
Schaf/Schafes = "sheep"
“What? No. Was I supposed to?” Tony replied, and he glanced around at the other fans to see if he had somehow missed an important memo. Most people were wearing some kind of Rangers swag, but it didn’t seem like jerseys were mandatory. But then, even Steve wasn’t wearing one.
Steve made a gurgling sound and instead interrupted Tony to ask a different question.  “
“No! No, Steve,” Tony promised immediately, “I was laughing at me, I wouldn’t laugh at you.”
“I figured,” Bucky sighed, already peering out to see if Tony was out of sight. They weren’t far from Shield, maybe four blocks, but Tony was already taking the most direct route. That meant Steve and Bucky would have to book it to reach Shield first the long way around.
“‘s not easy,” Steve slurred in his defense, but instead of putting his head back down to indulge some more, he crawled up in bed to stretch out beside Tony. “Hi.”
He had to play it cool. Brock couldn’t know he had guessed the night’s highlight weeks in advance; it would only make him more nervous about getting it right. So Steve did his best to keep one hand on his champagne flute and the other in his lap where Brock couldn’t see his fingers drumming impatiently in his lap.
“Mom!” Tony shouted into the house as they walked out into the foyer. His jeans were loose around his thighs and hanging off his hips, and he had to hold them up by hand if he didn’t want them dragging on the floor. Steve cringed at the loud volume, and tugged on the belt loops of Tony’s loose jeans in a non-verbal rebuke, but Tony ignored him and kept shouting. “Mom, where are my belts? Mom?”
“Maybe he thinks it’s boring,” Tony half-joked, but Steve wouldn’t let it slide.
Except Steve won't let him. This is his shot at the damn title, and he's not going out because he can't take a few punches. But since he now has been made aware that the other guy is cheating, he knows he can't just let it drag out and win by strategy: he can't win by points, because if Vanko is cheating, Steve won’t last long enough to see it through. Vanko has to go down as soon as possible, while Steve still has the energy to fight. So the next time Vanko comes at him with a straight punch, Steve meets him fist for fist with a straight left jab, putting all his weight and power into it, hitting it so hard the metal breaks Vanko's hand as well as his own. That leaves Steve with his dominant hand, and Vanko in sudden shock and pain, so he swings with the right and knocks Vanko out cold.
For the people of old Terrini, the summer solstice was a holiday second only to Christmas. Unlike Mächtingen who routinely treated it as a typical working day, Terrini did not work in observance of the summer solstice. It was a day of rest, of coming together, and a day where no one in the community would be hungry or alone. The summer solstice was a celebration of the wealth of a people, and the thought of involving money with their traditions would have been insulting. Farmers shared their bounty by feeding people - suckling pigs and roasting hens, bread and cheese. Carpenters and artists worked for months to create the stages and prizes for the games, while others added to the atmosphere on the day by painting faces and performing joyful music where couples young and old could find the chance to dance.
felt that Tony could be part of what was right for Steve, Tony only intended to be grateful.
Forgetting any sense of urgency he’d felt mere minutes ago about Tony getting to the studio on time, Steve leaned back and casually asked, “Who are they, Tony? Pray tell.”
Tony happily stuffed the last big bite of his hot dog into his mouth, so he nodded and hummed in the affirmative.
“Why, are his balls sagging to his knees already?” Paulette wanted to know at the same time as Erin muttered, “More like, he got what he wanted and now he’s done.”
, Howard: books are
“The story’s been with me a while,” Tony said quietly, tapping his head. In place of his earlier playful tip-toeing, he walked slowly to avoid disrupting his work. If Steve didn’t know any better, Tony looked tired.
Tony made a strangled sound, like he wanted to laugh but couldn’t believe what he had heard at the same time. “Sorry, MLK is
“The on switch is over the right cheek,” he told Steve as he put on his own helmet and flicked it on. “Now, you only need to relax. We will begin momentarily. Dim lights,” he added to the room at large, and the warm lights mellowed to a dim evening glow.
For a long time, Steve didn’t say a word. He didn’t need to. There was an unwavering strength in Steve’s arms, and as beautiful and thick as his biceps were, the strength of his arms wasn’t a physical quality. There was something about having Steve’s arms around him that made Tony feel like nothing could hurt him. That Steve would never allow such a thing to happen.
“No, but when has that stopped you?”
It took a moment for Tony’s words to register, but somewhere between realizing what he’d said and watching Tony’s awkward little limp, Steve stirred at once, entirely awake and mildly alarmed.
done for him? How did he deserve to be dumped?”
“That sounds great, but frankly it’s difficult to believe he is a reasonable person if he thinks I need a tailor made outfit for Taco Bell.”
To know how he, too, overwhelmed Steve, and how hard Steve was struggling to keep himself steady, to make this perfect for them, all of it made Tony melt back into the cradle of Steve’s body. He reached back to grab a fistful of his hair; this time, he wouldn’t let Steve hide his emotions and his desire in private little moments against his pillow or Tony’s neck. With a firm tug of Steve’s hair, Tony demanded his attention, and he twisted just so to slot his mouth over Steve’s, pouring his heart, his joy, his ecstacy into the kiss.
“...who told you I—”
“He lives in the building, you know,” Bucky said into the awkward silence left by the highly skilled people who had no idea how romance worked. “We could get killed any day. Why are you wasting time? Tell him how you feel.”
“I called him,” Natasha said before Steve had to ask. “Steve, you said it yourself: they’re four dead runaways over two years; no-one’s taking it seriously. We need his help. Maybe he can connect enough dots to convince the Captain that this is a case.”
Pierce raised the Beretta and smiled.
The young man was startled and looked around to see who had spoken. When Orfeo saw that it was the King himself, his whole body went still and his face drained of color.
You’re making me ask, aren’t you?
Before Bruce could think of a counter argument, Tony had the cash folded under a plate with the bill and was on his way out the door.
In the end, Steve and Tony proposed a wedding plan that began with a combined celebration of the summer solstice, spent five days recognizing the people whose work and efforts were indispensible to the kingdom, and concluded on the seventh day with their wedding. They wrote it with the expectation that their proposal would not be accepted in full. They wrote it with the understanding that it would never be so elaborate or as welcome in subsequent years.
Tony, Bruce, and Thor spent the next afternoon transforming Thor’s apartment into something approaching a respectable home office. By the time they had to stop for Tony and Steve’s four o’clock appointment, the floors were polished, the shelves and tables were tidy, and natural light flooded his living room. They tucked fresh white sheets over the couch and the armchair, pinning the folds into place until they looked as good as new, then hid what they couldn’t fix under plush blankets and pillows from Bruce’s apartment.
“I am the most dangerous man in this city, Tony!” Steve snapped, his words forced through gritted teeth. “If you are worried about safety, fine. Bucky and Natasha can come with us. But no cars, no royal guard, no—no us versus them. You said you wanted an equal,” he finished more gently, and hearing his own words repeated back to him, Tony looked at Steve more carefully. “You wouldn’t let me abdicate to marry you as a Prince Consort. Remember why.”
The euphoric chemical cocktail of Tony’s orgasm shot through the sleeve and directly into Steve’s bloodstream, pumping his body with the addictive rush of norepinephrine, serotonin, and oxytocin. The release of his own orgasm was only secondary to the high of Tony’s chemistry, and Steve groaned through his teeth in his overwhelming pleasure. He rocked and rolled his hips against Tony’s for every drop, neither pulling out or changing their position. The longer Tony lay under him with his ass turned up, the more of Steve’s come could be absorbed into Tony’s bloodstream.
“The last time you were here, people barely knew your name,” Stephen started right in, “you were promoting
“I know, Buck. Peggy will share a statement, it’ll be clear. We just wanted to wait until after the movie came out.”
Tony’s charade dissolved in a delighted fit of laughter, and he made short work of the distance between them to loom over Steve in his chair and kiss him quiet. Steve grabbed Tony by his tie and tugged him closer, until Tony was dragged right into Steve’s lap and turned prisoner in the circle of his strong arms.
“Yeah, he’s here,” Steve said when he finally caved and let his dad in. “We’ll call you back,” he told his mom over the phone. He watched his dad walk across the living room to the bathroom, and with a tired sigh, he accusatively added, “dad’s tracking ash all over my carpet.”
“Except cashews.”
The question must have caught Steve off-guard, because it seemed to leave him stumped, if only for a beat. He reached for his necklace out of habit, worrying the gold band absently between his fingers as he thought about his answer.
“That was the problem the first time, wasn’t it?” Steve pointed out, leaning into the doorframe now instead and holding the door in a firm grip, as if Tony might try to barrel his way into the room and Steve had to brace himself for the tackle.
A small smile tugged at the corner of Steve’s lips, but he kept his eyes on his work. His amusement would be more convincing if Clint couldn’t look him in the eyes. Fortunately, Clint got up then to check on the cooking food, throwing the hot dog buns on the grill to warm up while the sausages were finishing.
“You wanna touch him you gotta go through me first, pal,” Bucky glowered, but it was Tony who snatched up one of the smaller rocks around them and hurled it at the man threatening Steve’s person so freely.
“Yes, Steve Rogers.”
“Wait, Steve—stop, stop talking,” he whispered urgently, and before Steve regretted staring at him in surprise, Tony took him gently by the chin and made sure to look Steve in the eye. “Intense and rough is not the same as abuse or disrespect. I’ve always known exactly what to expect with you, or you’ve checked in with me. That’s not hurting me, Steve, that is some hot, kinky sex I don’t want to stop. So if you’re dead set on worrying about anything, worry about not giving me enough of it.”
Tony smiled into the kiss and purred in delight, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck and absently scratching at Steve’s naked shoulders while he pulled him in closer.
“...on Rhodey’s life?”
“Of course, but what are… uh,” Bruce started to ask when Tony held up his hand.
“If you fucking leave me without a mentor in this goddamn world, I will kill you myself, Tony,” Steve swore past the heavy knot in his throat, as the morality box nearby buzzed to life and announced both of his fines. “Don’t leave me here, Tony, what will I do without you?”
“We’ll go out tonight,” Tony promised, “go to the barn, have a good time, then come home and relax on the roof.”
“No—Stark, wait, that’s why I should go first. Tony, get back here!”
“Except he’s one of the smartest people I know so it’s not easy to throw him off when he’s got a lead. We were digging through everything ever published or released about Bruce for ten hours today. Do you know how hard it is to hide evidence when your partner’s right next to you? He’s going to figure out who Bruce is any day now… I think the only reason he hasn’t put it together yet is because it’s such a big leap to go from Bruce to Batman.”
President of 1919-1921, Edith Wilson), but he, too, wanted to make the most of Tony’s time in office.
“It’s Wednesday,” Tony whispered, “it’s
“Stop it, go on,” Steve preened with false modesty; Tony cracked up and almost lost his train of thought.
The palm reader wasn’t glass, or crystal, or the strange plastic cover of the touch screens Steve had started to get used to the last time around. This was a cool, blue gel that pooled around his fingers until his hand was fully submerged to the wrist. The mechanisms behind the door gave a series of quiet beeps, then all at once, the gel emptied from the reader to allow Steve to remove his hand, clean and dry to the touch.
“You've got a conference call in thirty,” she reminded him as he accepted the latte she held out for him, knowing better than to waste time with pleasantries. “There is a staff meeting at nine, and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for you to sign. He says it is imperative that you—”
“Keep reading, Steve.”
It was still the dead of night when Tony stirred awake. He peered around himself with a sleepy frown, only to realize Steve was crawling over him to reach the window.
From experience, Steve knew getting Brock alone would be easier said than done. Sharon was always hovering, and if she wasn’t, their other serpentine friends were. He already knew he wasn’t getting any productive work done if he went home, so Steve continued wandering around campus trying to think through how he might get Brock alone for just a few minutes.
“I know a place.”
“You realize most people can’t stand up to him with, like, an entourage of lawyers, right?” Tony murmured with pride as he leisurely brushed his fingers through Steve’s soft, blond hair. “You amaze me, Steve. I don’t tell you often enough.”
“Pigs get more aggressive and territorial this time of year,” Clint explained, “mating season’s coming up. They normally don’t come out near the cattle, but I guess water’s been bad this year.”
In vain, Tony tried to block it all out by focusing on Steve’s familiar warmth against his back. The masters cupped and squeezed him in their big paws, taking turns weighing and rolling his balls in their palms, kneading and pulling on them until Tony cried out from the sudden alarming pain.
A burst of loud, cheerful voices flooded the audio and Steve watched as Tony’s gaze lifted to something beyond the phone and warmed with a smile. Moments later, Lila made her way around to embrace her Uncle Tony in a tight squeeze. When Tony explained whom the recording was for, Shuri popped into view, and together the girls waved and wished Steve a good morning before informing him that they were taking Tony’s phone away so they could eat.
Tony’s words gave Steve pause. He wasn’t frustrated or impatient; he wasn’t even offended. Tony sounded
Steve Rogers
“Where the hell is Q?” Steve snapped at the nearest menial grunt trying to placate him. “He can’t avoid me forever. You,” he said, viciously pointing a finger at the nearest poor soul trying to address the problem nobody seemed to grasp. “Get me Q. There are eight live bombs in the fucking city.”
“We could go to Tribeca, they’ve got great places there, with really hot people—and rich, too,” Bruce started eagerly telling them as Tony led him out through the crowd.
“You have all your agents and ten NYPD detectives across the city on your task force!” Bucky snapped in a sudden outburst of anger. “All we’re asking for is time to confirm this man’s identity and prove he had nothing to do with this.”
“Loving you is terminal?” Tony echoed with a feigned, dramatic wonder that left Steve rolling his eyes and grinning like an idiot. “Damn, but what a way to go.”
Steve gave chase, and Rumlow had expected it. His feet had only reached the ground when Rumlow pitched the cannonball into Steve’s gut at an inhuman speed. Steve collapsed where he stood, choking on blood and air while Rumlow sprinted away.
Steve frowned a little in confusion, and without shrugging or leaning out of Tony’s arms, he lifted his head to look at Maria, and then Clint, over Tony’s shoulder.
Still, he couldn’t seem to shake the nerves and there was nowhere he could do anything about it. If he paced outside, he’d get hot and start sweating in his clothes, which was the last thing he wanted. If he paced inside the building, either in the lobby or in the hallway, he’d look crazy and possibly give someone the impression that he was too unnerved to be trusted as an intern. But given the scant number of people in at seven-twenty in the morning, Steve figured there was one place where he’d be safe to walk off his nerves.
“It’s you, isn’t it?” Stephanie cried breathlessly, and Natasha came forward to pull her friend into her arms. “You’re free, you—how?”
Steve ducked his head before anyone could see his smile falter; before the guy could congratulate himself for getting under Steve’s skin. He only needed a second to regroup and remind himself this was his first day at law school, and nobody was going to ruin that for him.
You’re the worst who let you take that picture
It looked like the blood vessels on Fury’s head were going to burst at any second, and he snapped with a sudden flash of rage. “Your assigned steward is Lieutenant Robert B. Banner!”
“I am in!”
Tony slanted a considering look his way. “Sometimes love isn’t enough,” he said with a sigh, wringing the steering wheel and adjusting in his seat. “She wanted us to be together: raise a family, a life. Maybe some goats. She just didn’t want to do it in the City.”
But Tony wasn’t the convenient type of genius who was socially unaware; too many excuses, and he would see right through Steve’s avoidance. A vindictive thought slithered through his mind, pushing Steve to accept that it could be that easy. Give him enough excuses, and Tony would do the dirty work for him. Leave the crumbs out, and once Tony understood he was no longer welcome, Tony would pull away on his own. And at the end of the day, who could blame Steve for protecting himself?
Rationally, Steve knew Tony had worked hard through the night to create a highly customized tool that compressed days worth of police work into seconds of computer processing. He knew Tony’d most likely made several alternative versions of the same program to accommodate different forms of data, since he hadn’t known what they’d exactly receive. His creation was, for all intents and purposes, an educated guess.
“Baby, we’re on the
“We don’t have to finish it,” Tony reminded him mildly, not sure what to make of Steve’s pinched look of concern. When Steve didn’t acknowledge his comment, Tony leaned in and softly said, “Steve?”
On the far side of the lab, Tony was hunched at his desk. Clearly, he was in software mode. Steve continued to move in the nearly-dark, not wanting to scare the life out of Tony with a sudden flare in the dark by turning on the lights, but the closer he got, the more he wondered how he should announce himself. Wasn’t this how murderers approached their victims, creeping in the shadows?
One great, black eyelid slid open to reveal a blood-red eye. She stared at Clint with a resigned air of amusement, but otherwise, she did not move.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut and tried to calm himself. He medaled in the NCAA, he could fucking do this. All he needed to do was focus. Words were arbitrary, completely and absolutely pointless except for the socially constructed meaning applied to them. It just so happened that some people used this word to mean a violent, territorial fighting machine, while Steve used it to have a good time.
The Boston Gazette was folded to the sixth page, and in big, bold lettering under the fold Steve read the shocking social gossip of the day over photos of himself and Tony, side-by-side.
The speech itself had been easy. He’d never admit it, but even after all these years, being a part of the commencement at his alma mater still filled him with awe. Scandals and mistakes aside, those kids looked at him like he meant something larger than life.
“I read the YouTube comments,” Steve mumbled, his words slurring noticeably after his fifth shot of tequila. “You and Channing look really happy together.”
“He seems better, you know,” Clint said after a while. Steve wouldn’t look at him still, but he could hear a smile in his tone. “I don’t know if it’s you or what, but man. I never thought he’d be back here. You just don’t tell my brother he can’t do something; he’ll find a way,” Clint couldn’t help but point out, his tone lowered in his pride. “Didn’t matter if he was twelve and that bison was well over eighteen hundred pounds—”
“I’ll do my best, Jim. You have my word.”
“The house is big enough, Bruce, it’s not like my mom would throw my shit out just cause I haven’t visited in a few years.”
There was a quiet pause on Tony’s end, but this time he sounded genuinely baffled. “Was that why you rolled us over? MLK?”
“Look, I don’t know you that well. I’m just… what you said, it sounded a little familiar, that's all. Nobody can tell you what to do, that’s your business. I get that. But my brother cares about you, Steve. He’s not the type to give up. He deserves someone who’s willing to help himself, too.”
“There was that one week after Calgary where you couldn’t talk right,” Pepper remembered, a bittersweet smile on her face. “He was out of school for two weeks, so Clint would go to his classes and take notes for him. And nobody asked why he was there, this kid four years younger than the rest of us, but—”
“How’s the stable?” he said slowly, careful not to spray his mouthful everywhere.
“The way I see it, we’re really the only ones who know the subject is a man,” Tony said under his breath. He glanced at the bathroom door again, then lowered his voice further in case for any reason Steve was hovering in the hallway to listen in on him in the bathroom like some crazy person. “Yinsen won’t know; nobody will know. We’re obviously changing his name for anonymity anyway, so we’ll just change it to a woman’s name. A relationship is a relationship: everything else will be the same.”
The assistant brought out a little Dachshund puppy called Eli as Steve’s final and winning point of the day. Eli was half the size of Steve’s shoe, but he scrambled out of Steve’s arms to jump on Mango, and at that point, all the puppies besides Violet had taken over the couch in their mad play-fighting, dashing across legs and hands as they chased and tumbled into each other.
“This weekend?”
“Ci manchi, Polpetto! This is Maribel’s final month with the Troupe,” Lila said in a whisper, her eyes shamelessly bright with excitement. Jim Rhodes’ crush on the visiting American thespian was the biggest open secret in the palace, and after months of conspiring and forced theater going, he - a decorated pilot and life-long confidant of the king - had worked up the nerve to speak to the young woman in passing.
Steve gave him a curious look, though he shook his head to express his confusion. “What do you mean?”
Steve rolled his eyes, but rather than give in to Bucky’s childish bickering he considered what Bucky said more carefully. “You think he was always that lonely? He had enough social skills to get married once. Why wouldn’t someone like that be able to find a girlfriend or… anyone?”
Thankfully, Rhodey’s preemptive consideration paid off big-time, because when Steve showed up unannounced at the youth center, Rhodey was waiting. He was the one who stood in the doorway and told him that Tony had moved on, and that if Steve hurt him again, Rhodey will make him regret it.
“Brock! You go here, too? I’d forgotten all about that,” Steve laughed in feigned surprise, doing all he could to play it cool.
She was gone for thirty seconds when from across the room Steve threw the curtain aside in indignant outrage. “
“Because he just gave me the lead on Scorpius that Q-branch couldn’t,” Steve replied impatiently. “Make the call. He’s an asset, Buck. I need him in London.”
“I was writing today. Editing, actually,” Tony corrected himself with mischief bright in his eyes. “The scene you helped me with last week.”
“It is!”
Steve poured more lube onto his fingers and his fingers into Tony with an infuriating patience. Had it been any other man, Tony would have smacked him with a pillow and turned formation, but the longer Steve took to prepare him, the rougher he tended to be, so Tony gritted his teeth, held his tongue, and did his best to relax as Steve pumped his fingers slowly into Tony, thoroughly spreading the warmed lube as deep inside Tony’s body as his long fingers could reach.
“….okay, I don’t know what I’m supposed to call you—”
Despite his dedicated and eager interest, when Tony tugged him off by his hair, Steve relented without delay.
“That is no woman,” Thor disagreed unhappily. “She is a girl.”
With jerky, aborted movements, Tony nodded against Steve’s shoulder. Steve felt as Tony inhaled deeply, taking that moment of peace between them to steady himself before sitting up straight to smile down at his husband. His eyes were red and his cheeks were wet from tears Steve had never heard him shedding. The wet lines streaked his face, darkened by a fine layer of dust and soot. With great care, Steve cupped Tony’s face between his hands, and with an unhurried, gentle touch, he wiped Tony’s face clear of tears and grime.
His heart raced hard and fast in his chest, and Steve stared at Howard, stared at the ring boxes. If Howard only knew what he held in his hands. They were supposed to be Steve’s ticket to stability, the key to the life he had worked so hard to achieve, and a career in which he could thrive.
“Oh, no,” he said with a helpless little laugh, and next to him on the couch, Steve perked up.
was the golden child,
The fucking nerve.
“Why not? They’re young and attractive, they have low-paying jobs in an expensive city that caters to the wealthy,” Tony reasoned. “If you can get your hands on their membership data going back two and a half years, I’ll put together a program to search for the other victims. They use made-up nicknames on the website, I can’t search for them by their real name or their emails.”
“Not really,” Clint agreed, and if he was going to say something else, he was distracted by the dogs collected at Steve’s feet. It must have been easy to spot Steve’s discomfort, so Clint absently promised to take care of them for him as he stepped away, whistling for the dogs’ attention and leading them away with promises of bones.
“What the hell, mom? Is that the welcome wagon dad throws down whenever y’all have company? If I didn’t know any better—”
“Maybe,” the man said with a nervous laugh. “Interview. Just came from another one in Cambridge; I’m trying to stay in research for now, but I also want to stay in London. Sorry, nervous,” he said with a rueful look, “I got here yesterday, I think I’ve had eighteen cups of coffee in twelve hours and I’m not exactly sure what’s going on anymore. I’m Tony.”
Armed with a pan and a ladle, Maria marched their way banging the pan full force. The blistering exchange of cursing and adrenaline-fueled laughter immediately turned into childish cries of complaint, and the boys separated like oil and vinegar with their hands over their ears.
“You gonna ask Rhodey out or what?”
Tony blinked owlishly as he slowly realized how badly he’d blown that out of proportion, then had to look down at his feet before his embarrassment turned into a crazy smile, or, worse, giggling. He cleared his throat quickly to regroup, trying to hide the tremble of laughter in his voice when he peeped out, “Nope, I’m good.”
“Wherever she is, I pray she overlooks the pies and is comforted to know there is nothing I wouldn’t do to protect her son,” he told Tony. “There’s nothing I wouldn’t do to make you happy.”
The villa was stunning, beautiful and breath-taking and timeless, but
It was new, it was all new, and without thinking Steve hugged the pillow to his chest and bit into it to muffle the embarrassing string of aborted gasps and whines Tony was drawing out of him. At the first sign of easing tension, he felt Tony push his thumbs in deeper and stretching him open. Again the chilling reality clawed at him, and Steve squeezed his eyes shut and clutched the pillow in his arms to brace himself for Tony’s cock. He reminded himself that whatever sound he made needed to be Tony’s name; men liked hearing their names.
“I’m looking at it, but I still can’t believe it’s real.”
“You should. Do you have a resume?”
“Ben, do not listen to him!” Natasha shouted, and Ben’s arms visibly shook with the effort to keep the gun trained on Pierce’s head. “We do not murder in cold blood, that’s not who we are.”
“Did you get a chance to rest? Or have you been scrubbing the house all day?” Clint asked while he got his ingredients in order.
“Here, let me help,” his dad said quietly over his shoulder when all Steve managed to do was smear the ointment over the sticky flaps of the band-aid so it wouldn’t close anymore. He was an adult, damnit, but he was also man enough to admit it felt nice to be a little coddled after a long, frustrating day.
“I’m calling you now, doesn’t that count for something?” he asked casually. “Can I assume you’re still in London?”
“I know you love me,” Tony informed him cheekily, and Steve laughed against Tony’s smirking lips, laughed into their kiss, and eventually he dropped his full weight on top of Tony in the middle of all the blankets.
“I’ll be right here, Tony,” Steve promised, “whatever happens, I will be here, standing beside you.”
Of the eight clocks left, Steve reached five. Radio jammers from World War II were operational all around the city, and they bought him precious time, but it was still - in so many ways - a race against the clock. Steve had anticipated Scorpius would notice his interference, but how Scorpius understood that Steve had discovered the triggering mechanism in time to find a way around the jammers was beyond him.
“You won’t be poisoned by bad fish or choke without anyone around to give you the Heimlich,” Tony told them both, “and I won’t die on the drive over there, or on the drive back, or when a chandelier falls on me in the middle of the monologue, or—”
These students wouldn’t be like the greedy, careless assholes who paid Steve to use him and had no compunction about what their scales and teeth and claws did to Tony. As future harvesters they had every reason to be gentle and attentive to his needs: they were honing the art of harvesting orgasms without waking sleeping humans from their dreams, so they all had a vested interest not to hurt him. He imagined there might still be a minority of impatient students who wouldn’t take the time to lick the back of his knees or suck his nipples raw as they opened him up for a fresh canister. Not everyone would be present enough to make him feel precious and cherished the way Steve did, or take the time to whisper praise in his ear while fucking his sleeping body.
“And helped his sugar daddy’s team win the art history trivia at the end of the night.”
After her rejection, the crown prince returned to his country. Rumors of his wild escapades ended with a mysterious silence, until gradually, after nearly a year of diligent effort, Howard made himself known to the world again through his inventions and his rising power in military technology. As Europe advanced into the Second World War, cash poured into Machtberg from around the world. News spread of the crown prince reinvesting in the kingdom, advancing the infrastructure beyond their wealthier contemporaries, and after the passing of the old king, King Howard lifted restrictions on immigration for qualified educators, scientists, and medical care professionals. Given the rising threat of anti-Semitism and the Third Reich, a large number of Jewish families resettled in Machtberg. There, behind newly reinforced walls of the King’s own design and the natural protection of the mountain, they were finally safe.
Tony stared at her with a kind of horror that could only be laughed at. They had what? Oh, god, his parents were lunatics, and he’d left Steve alone with them for six hours—
“We’re in a meeting,” Hill told her stiffly, and Sharon had enough sense to smile sheepishly in return.
The color drained from Hansen’s face just as the judge banged his gavel for their attention.
They traveled together by night and slept by day as they had agreed. Tony and Stephanie walked on foot, while Clint trailed behind them with all of their supplies over his back. In the final hours before dawn, Stephanie would blow into a whistle for her dragon. Neither Tony nor Clint could make out any sound from the whistle, but no matter how far they had traveled in the dark, the dragon would always find them, and she would always come to Stephanie. Every day, Stephanie slept under the protective wing of her dragon, while Tony and Clint curled up under a tree together to sleep nearby.
predictable,” Steve huffed, even though they both knew it was a lie. “Anyone would find Tony attractive. He’s objectively handsome, and he’s kind, he’s intelligent, he’s thoughtful—”
The lights were turned down, but Tony’s arms continued to hold him close—continued to keep him safe.
IT SOUNDS LIKE CAPTAIN AMERICA PROPOSED
The next time he blinked, a series of sudden lights flashed behind his eyes. Soon his mind was filled with a vision of Tony floating above him, gazing down at Steve with lust clear in his eyes and a playful laugh warm between them. His silky, diaphanous robe billowed gently around his body, and as Tony floated closer, the waistband around Tony’s robe started to unfurl, and inch for inch, the robe peeled further away from his shoulders to reveal naked, tan skin and the glimmering silver adornments framing his lean, muscular body—
“I never thought of it that way,” he admitted with an affectionate smile, pressing a soft kiss to Tony’s forehead. “You really are something special, Tony. You think you’ll always find ways to challenge my assumptions?”
Steve walked away from his desk and his unfinished salad to help get the kids back on track. “Alright, everyone, yes, we have a surprise visitor. I know it’s exciting, but that doesn’t mean we’re not going to get back to our multiplication tables again.”
“Steve Rogers,” he said in a surprisingly steady voice, and with a smile that never failed to impress. “It is a pleasure to meet you all.”
He felt Steve’s rhythm slip into a desperate rut until he buried himself deep inside Tony’s body. The come filling him, the wet alien feeling that was still so new and so
“Ever since she walked twenty-three miles in the rain to bring Celeste home after a bad storm last winter,” he said without hesitation. “Just… I just haven’t found the right ring, or the right time to ask. Don’t want it to be just another day.”
Tony looked like he’d been slapped. “Qu—lo puto Trump? Steve! Deja de ser un cabron!”
“Although Mr. Rumlow makes an excellent point,” he started a little hesitantly, “I have to wonder if the defendant can be compared to Swinney at all. Swinney made one donation and kept track of it, so I have to wonder: did the defendant keep a similarly thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?”
“You know, I’d love to, but I’ve got a date,” Tony said once he’d confirmed the time. “Channing’s in town and by some miracle we’re both free this weekend, so we’re heading up to Napa. But, rain check? I’ll be back on Wednesday,” he added, mildly apologetic. “We can catch up then?”
Pistol whipping an operative with the license to kill was about the dumbest thing Tony had ever done, but Tony had never felt so angry in his life. He was bleeding, and he was so fucking tired of the lies. The world was already greying at the edges, what did he have to lose?
“Come on,” he said after they had let the mourning go on long enough. “Listen. Thor. Sure she broke your heart, but if you think I’m going to let you lose your job over her, too, you’re down shit creek without a canoe. You’re going to take a shower. You’re going to look and smell out of this world; not for her, but for you, because you deserve it. You got it? I need you to get on your feet, Point Break, chop chop: we’re doing this right now.”
Fury glanced around the table of ashen faces. “In the absence of any alternatives,” he finally muttered, “so be it.”
Steve was so busy trying to get under the covers without Tony noticing how hairy his arms and legs were that he didn’t realize Tony’d been fiddling with Steve’s stole.
When Steve finally pulled away to admire his work, Tony traced his spit-slick, swollen lips with his finger tips.
Despite freezing rain and sleet, Steve got dropped off at Tony’s address by a black and white in record time. He hesitated briefly at the door, considering yet again to ask the officer to hang around in case of emergency like Bucky had suggested. It would be the smart thing to do, but if he was right about Tony, the risk of offending him after all he was doing for their case was too great.
“If he is not there, we might at least find a lot of people who know of good places to hide in the city. Scraps are people, too, Stark,” Steve added in a gentler voice. “They don’t deserve Rumlow any more than your New Yorseylvanians.”
“Do we know the identity of the person or people with whom he cheated?” Sharon asked the professor, which was the first time Professor Hawley seemed to acknowledge one of them.
“Fuck! What the hell—”
His comment was innocent enough, but Hammer pursed his lips in a clear attempt to stay cool.
She wasn’t kidding around, and the last thing Tony needed was his only friend in town to be angry with him. Fuck fuck fuck. He took another minute to clear his throat, furtively casting around for any man who could plausibly pass for a man whom Tony would be interested in and —
However his gamble played out, Steve was keenly aware of what he had already lost. Win or lose, he would never be able to return to this life he loved—the dream he had worked tirelessly for, and painstakingly made a reality.
“Right, of course. Sure. You know, Pepper told me you couldn’t stop talking about me on the phone. She said you were
“You were… a little, you know,” Bruce vaguely gestured to indicate Tony’s body. “Bigger. Seven to eight years ago.”
Ring or it didn’t happen
The table of six had four people around it: Brock and Sharon, whom Steve recognized, and two other students Steve didn’t know that well, Phil and Jasper.
“Why did we agree to such a rushed affair! You have no change of clothes in your possession,” Tony vented out loud while pacing the length of his office. Steve wasn’t entirely sure what he meant, but Tony had been bent out of shape since the incident with Pierce. Either way, it gave Steve time to work. While Tony muttered to himself and conferred with the computer about several ‘necessary commodities,’ as he called it, Steve took over Tony’s computer terminal. There his body could finish healing while he studied different maps of the city and worked backwards to trace Rumlow’s movement so far.
Tony hummed softly and Steve tried to open his eyes to give Tony his attention. “Should I be offended? I can hear you thinking, handsome.”
