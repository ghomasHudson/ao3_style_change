“—me to come home to New York for an entire week. Oh my god, Dad. This is what that was about? Because you didn’t want Steve to meet me?”
“Tony.” Steve sits up straight and adjusts his backrest forward. “You could’ve just woken me up, sweetheart.”
“Dad!”
“Do you need help, Pete?” Tony asks.
What if this break opened his eyes to how much better off he is without me?
"So are you," Tony whispers back. Steve casts his eyes down, down to his shoes. Tony grabs Steve's hand and places it on his lips, already missing Steve's warmth on them. "We'll figure something out."
“No! He’s—”
Steve shrugs. “You asked.”
How the fuck are you an Avenger?
Not… not good advice, babe.
And how long do you want to keep yours on?
“Your—your mother asked me to take care of the two of you.”
Billy pulls him back by the shirt. “That’s Steve, idiot.”
After Steve places Peter on his car seat and gets in the passenger seat himself, he notices that Tony is rubbing his gloved hands together and blowing on them. “Cold?”
“It’s us,” Steve says. “In London.”
Tony is asleep. He had been dozing off by nine and had started snoring ten minutes later. There's drool on his cheek and it slides down to the pillow, creating a damp spot near his ear. Dimmed lights and a soft murmur of AC/DC playing in the background before ten are par for the course these days, though Steve is still having a hard time adjusting to Tony sleeping at reasonable hours.
“Sometimes, I hear chanting. A lot of it when they just moved in.” Tony tucks his phone in his pocket and pulls his plate back in front of him. “But it quieted down after Steve realized I’ve been having trouble sleeping from the noise. He doesn’t like it when I stay up so late, you know?" he says before digging into his pasta once more.
“Of a sort,” Steve agrees.
Steve grabs the gifts Bucky and Sam got him from the bedroom—a small but sleek black leather-bound sketchbook from Bucky and a new set of charcoal pencils from Sam—and shows it off to Tony. They’re still seated on the dining table, Steve still on his first mug of coffee, while Tony is on his second.
Tony pushes himself closer, tries to hug Tommy again, but Tommy leans away. He wipes the tears with the underside of his shirt collar. “No. I know I should’ve told you sooner, both for your sake and his. And mine, I guess. I’ll properly end things with him, if you ask me to. But I can’t promise that I wouldn’t hate you. It almost happened once before.” Tommy looks down on the floor. “I don’t want to hate you, Dad.”
shakes the room as he grunts with every thwack.
"So, that's two items down," Steve mumbles, and it's almost incredibly endearing, Steve referring to his little list that way he had so many times before. If only Tony isn't still so angry. "Next we have the...right, the indoor playground had a ball pit and bouncy house. And we asked everyone—because we couldn't let the rest of the Avengers not have any fun—they went to the playground with us, remember? Uncle Clint started enjoying himself a bit too much, and he was able to rope Uncle Thor into some ball pit war, or whatever it was they did. At first, you stuck with me and your dad. You wanted to climb and crawl through the entire playground, but your dad...hm."
Tony does miss Steve. He really does. He started missing Steve the moment he had driven off to Brooklyn in his motorcycle some three days ago. Suddenly, the unit felt a little bit colder with Steve gone, and for a moment, Tony had been faced with
“What’s that supposed to mean? These people are nice.”
“Lemme see?” Tony cranes his neck over Steve’s shoulder, then rests his chin on it. “Yeah. You were born here, sweetheart.”
“You should get some sleep, Dad.”
He enters a pub once when Steve and Tony are both preoccupied with their map and the StarkTab’s GPS and where to go next, dragging Tony along with him. Tony whips his head up from the tablet when a voice from in front of him tells him that children aren’t allowed inside, and he profusely apologizes to the bartender, who does recognize him as
When Steve nods a kind nod, Peter forgets of the fires and flames. He vaguely remembers the taste of hot chocolate on his tongue, vaguely remembers his father putting him to sleep, vaguely remembers thinking he needs to call Wade in the morning to tell him that he loves him, the way he vaguely remembers the same three words escaping his dad’s lips after it comes out of Steve’s lips first.
“So, I just...go back to hiding,” Noh-varr says slowly. “Is that it?”
“What?”
"There's still leftover cake, Pete."
“But you hate what she did to me.”
"And where would we go?"
Sometime after midnight, the heart monitor beeps for the 526th time. It keeps Tony company, along with the full discography of AC/DC playing in the background, soft and muted, a complete shift to how it’s supposed to be played, but needs must. His hand feels cold, but it sweats under Peter’s palm. He checks Peter’s pulse with his forefinger and middle finger when the boy takes a particularly deep breath, and he wonders what Peter could be dreaming about, if young boys in comas dream at all.
“I can’t handle any more attention on me, bud.” Tony looks away then moves to stand up. He can feel heat travelling to his neck. “You know I’ll love whatever you’re giving me. But I think I need to appreciate them alone, for now.” He pulls Tommy up, who had reached out a hand to Tony.
“Oh my god, is this how you feel sometimes? With me and Tommy?”
I’d just like to thank you.
“No!” Tony and Billy say at the same time.
“How are you feeling?” Tony asks.
Hold still, Scott. I'm—
“Just tell Peter your story. I know you have one prepared.”
Tony flinches at the sound of her name. “He...he knows you once dated a girl with that name. That’s it.”
“It wasn't until a month after you arrived at the tower when you first talked to JARVIS. Tony didn't want to spook you, so he asked JARVIS to lay low for a little while. You didn't talk much after we went to the playground. You kept your distance, especially at night. You didn't stay long with us after dinner, and it would worry us, you know? It would worry us that you didn't feel the same connection we did.
"I hope you know you're kind of an asshole, Prof," Bucky says.
Tony smiles sadly and observes the snowy ground. His throat closes in on him, his eyes watering. He blinks the tears away. “I should’ve told you sooner, but it was just so easy to live my life as a father and my life with Steve separately. It was peaceful...it was…” Tony coughs. “But I know my happiness...my selfishness would come at a price if I kept this to myself any longer. It can’t be at the expense of you as my children. I’ll never do that to you.”
"You're cute, you know that?"
That night at home Steve sat on the couch with Tony's feet in his lap, rubbing them.

"You know that I think you're so strong and I'm so proud of you for doing this, right?"
I was the one who asked, Stevie.
Bucky’s Log 38, take two.
to think about.”
Oh, um…
is far from being a problem now. It’s when Steve isn’t around that Tony finds himself choked up by the silence, the loneliness waiting for him in every corner.
Location: Avengers Facility Rec Room.
Steve doesn’t say anything.
“Very small productions, though. Different from what I used to do there in New York. I mean, teaching is great and fun and I have decent pay but it's just not fulfilling," Tommy says at the same time Bucky folds one forearm over the other and swings it over his chest, miming carrying and cooing at a baby.
You were the one who wanted to take a break.
right after, but just for a little while."
“No, I can do it, Daddy.” The boy doesn’t bother turning back as he answers.
“Exclusively.”
"We'll see him when he gets back."
Tony—
Tony notices that he’s been clutching Steve’s hand with whatever power he has left. He lets go when his breathing doesn’t feel too forced.
"Leave the tablet. JARVIS will run a scan around my perimeter so no-one mugs me while I sleep," Tony says, eyes still closed.
Okay.
Good luck.
The second is an old wedding photo, black and white. An outtake. He remembers a similar photo from back home, of his ma in her wedding gown and his father in a suit, faces serious but eyes smiling. In this one though, his mother’s head is thrown back in laughter, and his father is looking at her so fondly. His mouth hangs half-open, perhaps the beginning of laughter. They have their arms wrapped around each other.
Steve twists and sits up higher, placing his forehead on Tony’s. “I’m sorry.”
Tony. Stark.
And no, this isn’t to imply that Billy looks up to Tony any less. He had just been less susceptible, and still is less susceptible, to modeling his entire life after Tony.
"Full disclosure, Thor's morning breath is a lot worse."
Then, try harder—
Stop.
That what Steve told you?
“You’re doing a great job, Tony.”
Tony only shrugs and laughs.
“I don’t even know if that was the correct church. And that hill. There were about a dozen other hills around us. I just—”
“No. It’s about why we’re here.”
I almost got you killed. Tony.
“No, no,” Billy says. “I’m just messing with you, Steve. No need to apologize. It just takes some time to get used to, I guess.”
“You really think Vision is the type of guy to cheat on your mother with me? He’s not Victor, Tommy.” Tony covers his mouth with a slap. He shifts his legs underneath him to stand, but Steve holds him down, grasping his wrist. He faces Tommy. “That’s a hypothetical for you. Is that what you want?”
Tony smiles behind his mug.
Steve?
It had been the red nose—hah!—that Billy had noticed first. Then the way Tommy had closed the door when he got back from his exercise that morning. It had been uncharacteristically soft. Then they had locked eyes and it had suddenly been “serve your big brother pancakes, puny one!” He would’ve let it go, if not for the fact that Tommy had kept walking back and forth through the hallway leading to the bedrooms. At first, Billy had thought he was going in and out of his room. But he had let Teddy take a peek, and Tommy had just been standing in front of Tony’s door, feet shuffling and hands flailing.
“Is he okay? Oh my God, my baby.” Peter can feel his dad’s arms wrap around him.
“It’s true! Steve agrees. Right, Steve?”
Tony doesn’t close the door behind him. He jogs to the intercom just beside their front door and speaks into it. The conversation his dad has over the system goes on for longer than Tommy expects.
“C’mon. You know how your brother can be. He’s a little—”
Thanks, Tony.
I don’t wanna have to hear just
Tommy looks at Tony, a little confused. Then he understands and grabs Tony’s hand, squeezing it intermittently, as if playing with Tony’s fingers.
Tony pouts. “This is nothing like Ty.”
He grabs a hold of Tony’s hand that is clutching onto the blanket. He lifts it to his lips and gives it a peck. “C’mon now.”
"Ah," Steve says, the beginning of a laugh bubbling in his throat. "Well, I might've had something to do with it."
Tony closes his eyes. He taps his fingernail on the wooden surface of the dresser, bites on his lower lip as he tries to find the courage to ask Clint if he could speak to his kid. “Tell him his dad misses him,” he says instead.
The master bedroom—Tony’s bedroom—is the first bedroom on the right just beside the entrance to the hallway. Billy and Tommy had stayed there with Tony for the first few weeks after moving in. In front of that is Tony’s old office, which they had renovated to be Tommy’s room after the boys had been ready to have separate quarters, which had taken a few years since arriving in America. Billy and Tommy had been very co-dependent on each other then, so it hadn’t really surprised Tony that they had never brought up sleeping in different bedrooms till they had turned fifteen. Beside Tommy’s current bedroom is said old bedroom, now Billy’s own. And just beyond that is the common bathroom and storage closet.
Um, okay.
He gets up, trying not to jostle the mattress too much as to not wake Steve up.
“Yes. Yes, he does.”
“I know.”
“Okay, stop.” Billy squishes Teddy’s cheeks between his thumb and forefinger. “I get it.”
Tony acquiesces with an eye roll.
“I know.”
"What crass language, oh Captain my Captain."
Come on.
I didn’t mean to air out our dirty laundry like this, Buck.
“The flowers look nice. I should’ve brought you some, huh? And is that—is that your copy of Charlotte’s Web? I thought that was in the tow—ah, your dad must’ve had Happy pick that up. Or did he let Uncle Pietro—er...just Pietro. He hates being called Uncle. Has your dad been reading to you, Pete? I’m sure he has. Great minds think alike, I guess. But your dad's is better, I'm sure.”
Tony nods. “It’s been a while, hasn’t it?”
“You’re gonna have to start trusting him with

. And I had to watch my dad suffer from the sidelines because I was just a kid, and he refused to let me and Tommy suffer with him.”
When he had brought this up to Steve, albeit feeling sheepish as he had uttered the words “do you want me to move in with you?” Steve had laughed. Not laugh like he had thought Tony was being ridiculous, but like Tony was being adorable, because he had said just as much.
“Yeah,” Clint replies. The chickens and the cows get louder.
“Tell him yourself tonight.”
The statement doesn’t at all faze Steve. He does shoot an apologetic smile at Billy, then says, “yeah, Tony and I have talked about it. He says it’s weird, but you and I are not exactly...uh, unique?”
Tommy casts his eyes down, no longer bearing to see the look on his face at the sound of Noh-varr’s voice. The truth is, he hadn’t meant to fall in love. He hadn’t meant to fall so hard in love that he would rather keep his relationship a secret from his dad than be told that it had been too much too soon. Because just like Tony with his sons, Tommy wants his dad’s approval more than anything. But he also wants to keep what he has in his life too.
Steve had shared the same apartment unit with his friends Bucky and Sam. It had always been that way, Steve had mentioned; having his friends close by had been one of the things he had gotten used to in pre-grad
C’mon, Tony.
“Oh, we...uh. Had lunch with this pilot friend, which was cool, but that was about the extent of it. I think his name is Noh-varr, but I could be mistaken.”
fully understanding the concept in its entirety, what has happened in the past to have led to this and what implications it might serve the future—is that Tony
“Closet door…TV.” Tony spares a glance at the large window beside them. “Clouds. Birds.”
Steve begins measuring the ingredients and dividing them into the correctly-sized bowls as Peter steps up his stool to watch his Pops work. The flour makes a bit of a mess on the counter and the floor. Peter gasps in childlike wonder and holds both of his hands over his mouth. Steve laughs and gives Peter a pat on the back. “It’s okay, Pete. You think you can give Pops one teaspoon of baking powder while I grate these potatoes?”
Or not.
“Love you.”
So he settles beside Peter, gentle and slow, scooping up his son’s head in his arms as he whispers lullabies into his ear. He recalls what Steve saids, remembering everything word for word, and releases his grievances into Peter’s hair with a sniffle and a sob.
Steve no longer has fresh breath. Now he smells like strawberries and syrup.
He is expecting to see their usual nurse, a young woman by the name of Beth, short but lean and a little flighty. She has gotten used to Tony’s unkempt nature in the span of a few hours after being assigned as his son’s nurse, though Tony thinks he should probably take a shower first thing in the morning as to not bother Beth with whatever smell he reeks of. However, as Tony raises his head to greet Beth with a smile, he finds that it isn’t Beth at all.

Tommy nods.
Steve sighs in relief. “I shouted at him.”
"I'm gonna take a shower and brush my teeth," Peter says. He slowly makes his way off the bed. Tony hovers—he has been hovering over Peter's every move since he woke up. "I'm fine, Dad."
“I understand that now.”
“It’s not like I’ve met
The rest, Steve dares say, is history.
It isn’t quite bedtime yet. But it isn’t a busy part of the day. Tony can’t decide on whether he should head down to his workshop for some upgrades or take Steve out for some fancy dinner date.
You sound like one of those YouTubers my daughter watches.
H̶͔̞̱̹̦̫̝̻͖̥̼̲͍̮͚̆Ḭ̴̧̝͖̲̮̅͋͋͊̕
That never stopped, Tony.
Tony sighs, shaking his head. “I get it, you're tired.” He gets off from his stool and walks to Peter’s side of the counter, places a firm hand on his son’s shoulder. “You just flew in from San Francisco, you have a wedding to think about, and you have your dad involving himself with his own tenant.“
He isn’t Steve’s friend, but it’s not like he’s never going to be. Outside of dating his dad, Steve might even be the type of person Billy would
“He was out of the house since before we got here. So it doesn’t surprise us, or whatever.”
“No, I don’t.”
Tommy takes a second to respond. “Yeah,” Tommy says, breathless. “Yeah, I’ve met him. He and Kate used to date. It lasted, like, a month.”
“Can you text him?”
All of them have been a target, Tony more so than the rest. All, that is, except Steve. Because in America’s eyes, their darling hero couldn’t have done wrong. So Steve, obviously, had had to prove them otherwise.
Steve nods, and that’s their day out in town done.
“Okay, baby—”
“So how was the vacation? Did you enjoy LA?” Noticing that Tommy’s mostly done with the dishes, Billy hops off his stool to help him load them into the dishwasher.
“I told you not to call me Uncle. I’m not old like Clint.” Pietro places both hands on his hips as he watches Peter unwrap his present. “Well, what do you think?”
Tony reciprocates but places the kiss on Steve’s lips instead. He smiles when he says, “you drive.”
“They’re gonna wanna know which friends. And where we’re going. And ask for pictures.”
—Scott and Tony?
Peter opens his mouth to reply, but thinks the better of it and decides to let it go. Instead, he says, “You keep saying cult and I’m not sure what you mean.”
“Eyes are already shut, darling,” Tony breathes.
"Yeah," Steve says, then he whispers. "I have to go."
I knew this was a bad idea.
"Yeah.” Tony blinks once. Twice. “Do you think it’s too quiet?"
I thought you might wanna finish your pizza first.
“Jesus,” Tony says, turning around in his heels and finding a sweaty Steve. “Where have you been?”

Peter finds the strength to face Tony, finally, and says, "I don't think I'll be able to let Pops go if I see him. I don't want to get him in trouble, Dad. I'm sorry—"
Steve smiles, strained. He refuses to meet Billy’s gaze and busies himself with the lid of his cup. He breathes in the aroma and blows the surface of the coffee to cool it down. “Tony told me you’re getting some extra shopping done?”
“I love you, too.” Tony yawns along, and finally drifts off to sleep.
No, but it’s not uncommon.
“Thanks,” Tony replies.
“Yeah, Dad,” Tommy says, sticking his tongue out. “I’m not derailing anything.” Then Tommy schools his expression to something more aloof. He isn’t particularly upset, nor is he on the cusp of some extreme emotion. He’s been very matter-of-fact so far, so Tony lets him be. “Sometimes, I wish Victor and Vision just swapped places. Not that I want Victor to die instead of Vision, but I guess I wouldn’t care that Victor is my bio-dad if it meant I never got to meet him, you know?”
You see, Tony can’t deny that he had spent a lot of those years sleeping with one eye open; at first for his sons, and then eventually for his own well-being. It had taken him the first one-third of his parenthood to learn that a half-empty bed isn’t something to be afraid of, that the couch isn’t such a bad place to sleep on, that loneliness is a worthwhile venture if it means escape.
“Hydra are the bad guys. Hydra took you away,” Peter whispers in his ear.
Steve hums. "A lot hasn't been feeling right these days."
“Of course,” Steve replies as sincerely.
Tony sits up from his chair and places JARVIS on the edge of Peter’s bed. “What else do you know?”
Instead of answering, Tommy sits down on the floor with his back to the bed. He drops his head to his knees and aggressively ruffles his hair with both hands.
“I also need your opinion on something. It’s not, like, urgent or anything but I do have quite a list to go through.”
There's a slight change in the heart monitor; it quickens, not by a lot. Barely noticeable if you aren't a supersoldier with enhanced everything, or a worried dad who has done nothing but listen to the beat of your son's heart the last few days. They look at the monitor at the same time, and they grip each other's hand, and wait with bated breath, when nothing happens. It goes back to the way it once was.
Noh-varr huffs out a breath. “At least tell me why.”
Tony presses the answer button. "Hi, baby." Bucky presses his lips together to hide his smile. Tony flips him the bird.
“He even told me to go back out there and start dating again. Which… weird. I've never heard him say that before.”
In fact, the next few photos have Tony in them, all taken in one location: a classroom. In the first few photos, Steve and Tony are engaged in what looks to be a heated conversation. In all the photos, Tony is fixated on a set of papers he’s showing Steve, but Steve…Steve has his eyes set on Tony, his often serious expression mixed with a softness in his gaze. There’s a glint in them Billy hasn’t seen in the other photos.
Tony shuffles his feet. He removes his arms from his sons and places himself a foot away from them. He looks at their faces, worried and confused, all too familiar faces made throughout the course of their lives. Tony wants nothing more than to let them know that everything is going to be alright, even if Tony doesn’t believe that himself. “You know you boys are the most important people in my life, right?”
So he settles for the most neutral question he could think of, still in relation to the relationship, and asks in the kindest voice he could muster. “How did you and Dad meet?”
“Me too,” Noh-Varr says quietly.
I do now, at least.
Tony melts into the gesture.
“Huh?”
"I definitely thought about strangling Happy. I wouldn't actually, Pepper would kill me, but I thought about it."
voice when I play this back.
Tony resists the urge to join the scene. He clutches at his blanket, still neatly folded on top of his pillow.
“He’ll be here, Dad.”
I’ve never done this before.
Tommy slams his phone screen down on the duvet. He stands up, balling his hands into fists. “No,” he says.
Jesus, okay.
At your service, Ms. Rose!
They finish the rest of their breakfast with a lighter conversation. Billy and Tommy are still not-so-subtly interrogating Steve, but they mostly ask him about his life before meeting Tony rather than how he sees his life with Tony going forward. Tony wouldn’t be too surprised if a question along that line slipped through. Wouldn’t be the first time it happens.
Tony places a kiss on Steve’s neck. “I’m sorry to spring this on you.”
Scratch that.
“For a while, yes.” Noh-Varr casts his eyes down. “It had taken me a long time to realize that her love had no longer been love. That it had been about taking control...over me. Just like my parents. And even then, I had tried to convince myself that nothing had changed between us.” Noh-Varr sighs. “Then, I met your son.”
There’s that crick in his neck again—no, not a crick, because it feels like if he turns his head even just a quarter of an inch to one side, it’ll snap right off. Tony considers magic for a second. He has never encountered anything that involves petrification before, although he wouldn’t put it past any magic user to know a spell or two. This is exactly why he doesn’t like magic. One morning he would wake up and then—
“Not until this Steve guy tells you the truth.”
The hyperventilation eases up but not by much. “My breath. Uh, neighbor’s TV?”

“You realize this is bigger than our old beds,” Billy had told his dad while assembling the bed frames.
He wonders how Natasha can speak Steve’s name so easily, while it lives and dies in the back of Tony’s throat, melting into a pile of acid and sliding down to his stomach.
“I don’t think I’m welcome here.”
"You were worried." Tony tucks a stray hair behind Peter's ear. "You knew where we were, and you were worried we would be hurt."
Tony opens his mouth to say something, but his tongue is caught by the brush’s bristles.
“Your first day at home shouldn’t have been your first official day. You were only set out to meet us and get to know us. We introduced ourselves to you, as
“Tom,” Tony pants weakly.
“Tommy.” Deep breath; now or never. Tony tugs at the end of his scarf. “It’s not any of them,” he starts, “but...I
Tony hums and starts the car.
“Rogers.”
But like all the other plans and maneuvers he and Tony are finely attuned with, there is always that one execution that doesn’t go as planned. Oftentimes not from a lack of practice or a misstep on either of their parts. No, it’s usually because of some outside force. This particular kind of force, they’ve taken into account many times before taking any trip, just one they haven’t conceived a proper concrete plan for in case it happens.
It isn’t until after Tommy and Tony are on their second game of Life, a few minutes after three in the afternoon, that Steve emerges from the bedroom, now in a change of clothes and hair wet from a shower. He’s sporting a cream sweater with an interlacing pattern over the dark two-sizes-too-small shirt he wanted to wear earlier. His denim pants are loose and dark, contrasting his sweater perfectly. On his feet are bright red and green Christmas socks with a cartoony rendition of Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer scattered all around.
"Won't be a problem, Commander Rogers," Tony says with a smirk. He embraces back, arms around Steve's waist. He places his nose on Steve's shoulder and breathes in his scent. "Won't be a problem at all."
“News said you were missing for fifteen days because Hydra—”
He hears someone clearing their throat. He flips over and sees Tony peeking through his door. Tommy shoots a frown his way before flipping back down on his stomach and locking his phone.
,” and that earns a shove from Billy.
Oh n—wow.”
with some college fees.
“I’m out of time, Peter,” Steve says sadly. “But I’ll be back, okay, Pete? I’ll be back.”
,” he tells Billy. “He has your face and everything.”
Billy shivers comically.
"No. No, uh-uh. Dad is allowed to fuss over you."
“Pop-pop?” Peter is looking up at Steve, handing him the plastic container of leftover mashed potatoes.
“Steve—?”
So Billy does.
“Yeah?”
Steve nods. “Yeah, he mentioned being a foreigner.”
home?” Tony taps the steering wheel before taking Steve’s hand into his own, placing them both on the center console. Tony's hand feels cold, but it's sweating.
"It wasn't awful because you flew and carried us back to the tower."
"How are you still hard?"
“Aunt Janet? Wait boy—”
It’s also one of the only times he gets to spend with both of his sons at home, especially since Billy and Tommy have moved out and begun living independently from their father.
“The affair continued.” Tony shrugs. “As much as I knew it shouldn’t. Despite Wanda herself knowing.” Tony closes his eyes. “And then the accident happened.” Tony squirms in his seat. He tries not to think about seeing Wanda in the hospital bed, seeing Erik and Pietro in torment. He hadn’t understood then what it had meant to lose someone he loved, and perhaps he doesn't understand it still. Not really. Not the way they had. “I went to visit her, you know? Hoping to see if there was anything I could do. I half-expected her to tell me to leave her and her family alone. But all she told me was to watch over her kids.”
“Alright, but can it—”
The cold New York air is sharp against Tony’s skin. He checks his watch: almost two in the afternoon. He shifts in his seat, his ass feeling uncomfortable and numb. Right leg over his left leg, left leg over right. He slouches, then stands, then sits back down.
On the counter, Tony is slicing a loaf of bread for sandwiches. He checks the fridge, saying, “do you mind only having Nutella on your bread, Noh-Varr?” He takes the chocolate spread out of one of the overhead cabinets and begins preparing the sandwiches.
“Good enough. Three things you can feel?”
“Love.”
"Great!" Peter interrupts, then clears his throat. "We're okay, right, Dads?"
Scott Lang.
Tony rolls his eyes as he slowly sits up. He looks over to Steve to find a red mark just below his hairline. No doubt Tony’s sporting a mark of his own. “I fell, Tommy.”
Or my calls.
weird.” A beat passes. “Only because me and him…”
“Oh, you didn’t have to go through the trouble,” Steve replies.
Billy looks at him with wide eyes. “Don’t be gross.”
He feels a finger on his cheek. He opens his eyes.
Thanks, Tony.
“This meeting is for my daughter,” Erik had added, ending Tony’s suffering. “And for my grandchildren. They come first.”
The bed dips just beside him. Steve places a hand on his back.
He wants his nightmares to stay nightmares. Not reality to keep haunting him in his dreams.
Billy feels a sense of pride for Steve, that familiar feeling of vindication. It isn’t everyday that he finds an ally amongst his dad’s peers, even if said peer is more his own than his father’s. Not to mention, said peer should be the subject of his doubts in the first place. But Steve is making it very hard to doubt him.
"Sorry, sorry," Steve whispers. He and Sam dump the mountains of food on the kitchen counter.
“Dad can finally tell us apart now,” Billy says as he goes in for his own hug with his brother.
“Fuck,” Tommy hisses. “Fuck, fuck fuckity fuck
“I’ve thought about it,” Tony says, gentle.
“I mean for dad! Not me.”
Fuck. “Yeah, I know, sorry.”
A silent moment passes. “Your dad is an adult, Tommy. He knows what he is getting into.”
I should’ve known my decisions as Iron Man would bear this much weight between us.
"Except Captain America."
We all go at our own pace.
Steve nods. “Yeah…he. He doesn’t sound like a very good person.”
"Don't tell Kate I said that though. I don't want her to fire me. Which she won't anyway, but we can never be too sure these days—"
“Tell Tommy how you used to tap dance,” Tony teases.
“I’m okay, Bill. I know Central Park probably isn’t the best place for this. And we tried to wait for you at the tower, Tommy, then at a Starbucks. But I just…I needed to be out, you know?”
“Huh indeed.”
They do indeed keep things even more timid with Noh-Varr in terms of physical affection, but their tone offers a more playful message: a quip at his secret relationship with Tommy, then a mention of Kate. Noh-Varr responds in kind, a witty retort about how Kate deserves better than all of them combined. Billy and Teddy give him a fist bump.
The walk back to their car is short but stressful. Tony is diligent about keeping an eye out for literally anyone crossing their path, and Steve isn’t any different, though there’s a reservedness to him that he channels into wrapping his arms around Peter. He’s not sure if it’s because he wants to hide Peter from the public or if it’s because he wants to be as close to his son as physically possible. Perhaps, it’s a mixture of both. Steve feels too out of his own body to have the presence of mind to categorize his feelings.
E̴͉̞̭̣̟̟̙̺͈̳̯͆̔̇̉̎̑͒͋̌̂̇̏͝Ń̸́̔͂̈́̾̔͌̓̕͘͝͝ͅ
“Were you expecting me to stay?”
“That’s what you picked up out of everything I just said?”
He feels it. A numb sensation inside. He realizes and groans.
“And Kate’s
“Please remember that.”
The second, while even more of a suspicion than the first, is a lot more pressing. Tommy is a good enough liar, but even the best of masks crack.
He crashes onto the floor, blanket tangled all over his limbs.
Tony spends an equally small amount of time getting fucked hard by Steve in the shower.
"That I put him in a coma?"
Uh, okay?
The door closes. There's a thud on the floor, Peter's heavy backpack hitting the carpet, and Peter is running towards his Pops. Another softer thud erupts as Peter's body hits Steve's. His arms are wrapped tightly around Steve's torso, and he's never felt more at home.
“I take it you didn’t always have food on your table—”
Ń̸́̔͂̈́̾̔͌̓̕͘͝͝
Tony groans but lets himself be manhandled.
are all within reason, but he can’t possibly leave Peter’s side when
“Dad,
“And I’m pretty sure Peter enjoyed himself if all the jumping around was anything to go by. And I had fun spending time with my family. So it’s all good, right?”
While the profile itself is barren of activity from Steve, there are at least a couple of tagged photos available for viewing. A few are stolen shots of the guy in various places—apartments, the park, bars.
Upon entering their quaint home, Tony had been immediately hit by the smell of coffee and freshly baked bread. Erik had been sitting on a dining chair, waiting for Tony to step in and take in his surroundings. Charles and Pietro had been nowhere to be found. Tony had been hoping to have them around. Charles was a natural mediator, the peacekeeper that kept Erik in check. And Pietro could at least be a human buffer in case Erik had wanted to castrate Tony.
What now?
"All babies look like sad clowns," he says as he takes the set of paints off the shelf. "I bet our baby is going to look like a sad clown. Tony, would you still love our baby if they end up looking like a sad clown forever?" He walks back to their bed, gently lifts the covers off of Tony. He sits beside Tony, folding his legs in front of him. "It's not like they're actually sad—oh, I forgot the water."
When he opens his eyes next, it’s to the feeling of guilt blooming in his chest. He must’ve dozed off. The pain in his neck is more pronounced now, and his back isn’t any better. He wipes a hand over his face, static and numbers fly by his closed eyelids lightning fast. He snorts, clears his throat, and the quiet of the night and the beat of Peter’s heart swallow the sounds, claiming them as unimportant. Tony moves his chair a few inches closer to Peter as the door to their room opens.
hair.” Steve squirms, looking at them uncomfortably. “I only gave them nerf guns. And they’re not even the awesome kind.”
“He’s great!” Tommy exclaims. “Fine, yeah, he’s a little scary. Dad was terrified of him before. But nothing brings family closer together than shared hatred for Victor. Dad must’ve told you about Victor—”
“This isn’t a frat party.”
Tony ignores Tommy and picks a blue peg after he lands on the marriage tile.
Peter holds up the Sleeping Beauty doll with a grin on his face. "Thanks?"
So Tony stays awake, holed up in a room in the Avengers Facility Medbay, Natasha’s voice playing on loop in his head as he sits uncomfortably on a plastic chair, his arms stiff on the armrest and his legs alternately crisscrossing each other.
D̴͕̪̟̟̘͙̘̝̤̩̭͉̫̿̂̊̏͛̊̚̚͝ͅ
Despite how much he appreciates the open space, and despite it having served him all these years, Tony still finds himself, only very rarely, wishing that he hadn’t torn down the walls in the first place. Usually during instances where Tony craves privacy. For example, if Tony was having a party and needs a bit of a breather from the guests, he can’t exactly hide in the kitchen, nor can he retreat to his bedroom without seeming like a bad host.
“They're just copies. I thought it would be nice if you had both your mom and dad’s birth certificates. A piece of the past… I don’t know. Maybe it’ll help you connect your life before to your life now.”
“Like— Like… I dunno…”
The last photo is of his mother and his father in a hospital room, both looking a little haggard and tired, but with wide smiles on their faces. His mother is on the bed, holding a baby and his father has his arm around his ma.
“Tommy,” Tony warns. “Play nice.”
Where the hell could that boy be?
“So they’re gonna move out eventually.”
just tell them you’re out with friends.”
Listen, Steve.
"We figured we needed to change things up. Instead of you coming to us and doing what we do, we asked you what you wanted to do, and we did it with you. I'd color with you and your crayons, and so would Dad. Then the three of us would build Lego houses together. We asked JARVIS what else you enjoyed doing, which felt a bit like cheating, but we just wanted you to be comfortable."
," Steve singsongs. "Warm."
“Why don’t you and Steve open up your presents in the bedroom and my needy brother and I can set the table for breakfast?” Billy offers. He tries pushing Tommy away, who only seems to glue himself even firmer on the spot.
“This is our second Christmas together,” Noh-varr says over the phone, his voice laced with sleep and irritation.
“But that's
It is. It's almost two in the morning, but with Peter waking up at five in the afternoon, and the doctors and nurses and medical professionals finishing up their work by ten, and Peter and Tony having a good long talk for another hour, the party couldn't start until eleven in the evening. There had been pizza and fries and cake and Coke. Natasha, Rhodey, Vision and Pietro had all appeared together. A few SHIELD agents undergoing training at the facility, those who have become acquainted with Peter, had come by to say hi and to welcome Peter back.
Steve emerges from the walk-in closet now clad in his loosest shirt. The sleeves still stretch at the sheer size of his arms, but at least his chest doesn’t look too exposed.
"I would've been pardoned a lot sooner."
Steve laughs and eases up. “But we were both clearly treading over uncharted waters. He was just more careful than me, I suppose. He had
“The new owners are planning on changing the landscape anyway. I thought we shouldn’t put these to waste.”
Tony shakes his head. “I know.”
“I know.”
Tony can’t say he didn’t expect it. After all, he has been married to Steve for eleven years.
“What on earth did you do to your hair?”
You’re rich.
Steve asks Tommy, Billy, and Teddy to open his gift for them simultaneously. Tony has to stop himself from bringing out his phone and filming the three of them opening up their gifts. Seeing them lined up on the floor, tearing open wrapping paper like animals, it sends Tony back to when they were younger.
"You're not wearing a shirt."
“You missed breakfast with the team,” Steve says.
“What’s wrong? Was it something I said?” Tommy asks. His expression doesn’t shift.
"There's a boy named Peter, with his two dads, living in a tower, in a big and bustling city, about to start his first day at school…"
“Yes, he is!”
A set of water-activated body paint catches Steve's eye; it's the same one they had used during Cassie's birthday party. It's not everyday Captain America spends an afternoon painting children's faces. Now nine children in New York can officially say Captain America had painted whiskers and butterflies and other nonspecific intricate designs on their skin, while one child can officially say Captain America had made them look like a sad clown. It hadn't been Steve's fault at all. The kid had shown him a picture of a sad clown from the 1920s. Who was Steve to deprive a child of their dreams?
It only takes them about a few winces and sounds of disgust when Steve tells them about how Bucky had lost his arm after he had been playing by a set of abandoned train tracks with Steve when they had been teenagers. Steve offers to stop; it’s hardly a story to tell over breakfast, but they implore him to continue, too sucked into the narrative to not reach a conclusion.
Steve's lips twitched.
"I can't date an Alpha, Sam. That's just wrong. You know that Alphas can't be together. It's just not allowed."
It clearly was a match made in the heavens.
Tony glared at him halfheartedly.
Tony nuzzled against him, mouthing at his jaw.
take that away from you, Tony. I wouldn't dream of doing something like that, pretty Omega."
It was a week after Sam and Brock's dinner party that Tony's heat hit. He was at work at the time, heading through the kitchen to get to the employee break room in the back when he hunched over in pain.  Tony groaned, suffering through what must have been the worst cramp of his life and it had come on so fast and out of the blue that he seriously hadn't expected it. Bucky turned the stove off and came over to Tony, cautious because Tony got a bit touchy about Alphas trying to help him, but clearly concerned.
"Love you, Alpha."
Steve blushed.
Steve licked his lips nervously, nodding. His cheeks were bright red, but Tony could feel his dick hardening.
"Alpha, Alpha, 'm so close, so close," Tony whined.
Bucky stiffened when Tony climbed into his lap and his breathing picked up. This was the closest to Tony he'd ever been and the Omega was scenting so pretty. Bucky had to swallow down a growl and clench his fist to keep from touching him. Steve showed up in record time, driving over the speed limit to get there. Pietro pointed him in the direction of the break room and Steve burst in, heading over to Tony immediately.
Steve felt awed by his little Omega. So much strength wrapped up in such a small little package it was unbelievable, and to think he was all Steve's. Steve kissed him, hard and lingering.
"Maybe just a little?"
He couldn't ignore him forever.
Tony swallowed back the lump in his throat, feeling betrayed and confused. He wanted an Alpha, but he didn't want the things that inevitably would follow, like being controlled or looked down on. Most of all he was scared that Steve would be perfect and Tony wouldn't be good enough for him.
Steve bit his lip, his eyes darting away from Tony's, but returning when Tony growled softly in that way that wasn't quite a growl but still managed to come off as a warning.
Steve felt like shit when he peeled himself out of bed the next morning. He went through his morning routine, but he might as well have been a zombie. All he could think about was Tony and how he hadn't said I love you back. Steve was startled out of his stupor by a knock on the door. He frowned as he opened it.
"Steve!" Tony whined. "Want you. Need you."
Steve started the engine again and Tony unbuckled his pants, pulling Steve's dick out. When Steve pulled away from the curb Tony started to stroke him, spitting on his hand to slick his way.
Bucky's eyes widened at the sound of his name coming so unexpectedly off of Steve's tongue.
Just then Tony cried out again and Steve cursed.
"No, I can't- I can't do this right now."
"Maybe not, but that doesn't mean everyone likes that. Maybe he could sense it and just knew that I could never be what he really wanted from an Alpha."
Steve growled.
"I know and I'm very grateful, but if you have any questions you can just call me."
"Hey, don't think like that. You are a real Alpha. I don't care what others say. Alphas don't have to be domineering and controlling."
Tony immediately nuzzled up against Steve, his entire body relaxing, recognizing that its Alpha was here now. Suddenly all was well with the world. Steve didn't have any personal experience with an Omega in heat, but he did know that the moment of relief wouldn't last long. He eyed Bucky, his eyes raking up and down him and Bucky dropped his gaze, not wanting to appear as a threat to the other Alpha.
"Another one? Already?" Steve squeaked.
Tony didn't sleep well when he was alone, but even when he wasn't and he did fall asleep instead of tossing and turning restlessly before giving up and going for a cup of coffee, Tony didn't sleep more then five hours tops unless he was passed out drunk. So maybe that's one of the reasons that he drinks so much.
"Tony, no. We can't yet," Steve groaned.
He knew that Brock being mated now would mean he would move in with his Alpha. That's just how it worked. Brock gave him a guilty look.
"Like last week when he gave you shit for having to leave early because of your heat. There are laws in place to protect Omegas from being forced to work while in heat, but you practically had to beg him for the days off and then apologize for not being able to work and he still gave you shit about it. Then he had the
Brock asked Tony how his shift's been going and Tony proceeded to tell him about the asshole customer that kept trying to feel him up and how Clint had just about jumped the counter to chase him out of here. Bucky had beat him to it, leaving the kitchen to yell at them for being creeps and throw them out. Even with only one arm their cook could be downright terrifying when he wanted to be.
For as miserable as Steve felt he still managed to pull himself together enough to get all cleaned up for the dinner that Sam and his Omega had invited him to. Brock had threatened to shove Steve into the shower himself if he showed up smelling like he hadn't showered in a week. Steve sure was glad that he'd showered and put on clean clothes when his soulmate showed up.
"Oh, baby, shh, it's okay. I'm right here, pretty Omega," Steve soothed, scooping him up off of Bucky's lap.
Tony rolled his eyes.
Stucky have officially met and Bucky gets this strange feeling just from hearing the way Steve greets his Omega that Steve is more like an Omega than and Alpha and Steve has the feeling that Bucky would do anything for Tony. Like they're meeting isn't really important at all for this fic, but it's still cute even tho it's very brief. I also love Bucky worrying about Tony and Tony curling up in his lap.
Steve couldn't stop staring at Tony during dinner and Tony kept blushing and squirming which just made Steve blush and squirm too. Brock just rolled his eyes at them.
Thanks for reading, leaving kudos, and commenting!
"Your knot, Alpha," Tony told him, licking at his lips. "Give me your knot. I'm ready. I can take it."
"Don't worry. He'll come around. Just give him some time."
Steve was enthralled, caught up in his tale.
"Good God, you're pathetic," Brock groaned in exasperation. "Seriously? That boy lives to please you. He's gonna be thrilled that you're gonna need massages and foot rubs for the next nine months. Not to mention, now he's gonna have two people to order him around. He's gonna be so excited to spoil your little mini-me, Tony."
It turns out he could ignore him for a month though, because Tony was just too stubborn for his own good.
"I'm gonna get hard if you keep bossing me around."
"We tried to get Obie fired, but the owner, Alexander Pierce, was backing him, so we're taking him to court. They've been doing a whole bunch of shady stuff that's totally illegal, from paying people off to pass inspections and dealing drugs out back in the alley, to denying us health insurance, making us work overtime but not paying us overtime, and usually they make the Omegas work during heat. I think Obie only gave in this time, because he thought you might beat his ass if he called me in for work."
"We're gonna have the most spoiled, loved, and happiest baby ever. He's never gonna want for anything."
"Sorry, angel, but I'm taken," Brock said regretfully, pulling down his collar to show off a mark that definitely had not existed when he went out last night.
I will be posting the first chapter of the second part, Loss, on Friday.
Tony groaned, but let Brock lead him back to the apartment. Steve was still in shock, only a few minutes having passed since Tony walked out. It wasn't nearly enough time to process what had happened and suddenly Tony reappeared. Tony shifted on his feet, his hand slipped into Brock's, his palm sweaty. Brock squeezed his hand encouragingly and leaned closer to whisper in his ear.
"Okay, okay. I'll stop, but you have to promise me that you'll come over for dinner tomorrow night. Sam's best friend is coming too,” Brock said casually, like he wasn’t secretly hoping that Steve was Tony’s soulmate. “It'll be my first time hosting a dinner like a real adult. You have to be there."
"Mm, I know. You're so good for me," Tony murmured. "Let me jerk you off while you drive us back to your place and then as soon as we get there, I want you inside of me."
The baby didn't respond of course, still happily suckling at Tony's flat chest, but he did look up at his mom like he was aware of what Tony was talking about. Tony smiled softly at him and brushed a finger over his cheek.
Steve waved him off.
"Yes! Oh my God, yes!" Tony squealed. "Fuck, you scared me there. I thought you were gonna say something awful, but I should have known you'd just say something charming and perfect."
"Yeah, well, I'd rather not give him a chance to get close to me only so he can decide I'm not worth his trouble and leave me. Never knowing how good it could be is better than knowing and losing it."
"Not my problem."
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked that-"
"I'm sorry, what? If I hadn't just told you I was pregnant, would you not have told me?"
"Steve's gonna be here so soon, Tony," Bucky promised, sitting down next to him on the shabby second hand couch.
"Congratulations, by the way. On the mating and the pup."
When Tony came though, crying out for his Alpha, it was enough to push Steve over the edge and he lost himself for a blinding moment, pleasure overwhelming him and relief flooding through him. It was when they were coming down from their highs, panting heavily and barely able to talk, that Steve groaned out,
Tony laughed and wrapped his limbs around him, leaning down to kiss him.
Steve glared at him, but there wasn't any heat in it. If anything he was just really embarrassed and
When Steve didn't get a call by the end of that first day he was starting to have his doubts, but he tried to remain positive. Maybe his soulmate was just busy or maybe he was shy and trying to work up the courage to call. By the end of the week Steve had all but given up hope on ever getting the call he was waiting for.
"Please, sir."
"No, now!" Tony demanded, a pout on his lips.
Which is why Brock called up Tony the moment Steve left. Tony was still ignoring him though and Brock groaned.
Tony rolled his eyes, but smiled.
"Bucky?" Steve asked.
Steve being so cautious and not wanting to step on Tony's toes, but still wanting to support him and give him everything that he wants and offer him the world is just so sweet
They had pushed the bed up against the wall, because Tony had read that was the safest way to co-sleep.
"Need you!" Tony demanded, the whine more of an order than anything else.
Steve's tip felt hot on his hole, delicious as it pressed inside and the stretch was heavenly. Tony's eyes fluttered shut when Steve was fully seated and so did Steve's. Steve knew he should probably stop, but he’d never felt anything like this before, the way Tony felt all tight and hot wrapped around his dick. His hips stuttered forward, trying to push in even deeper. Tony moaned, rolling his hips, a gasp falling off his parted lips.
Steve swallowed, nodding rapidly.
Sam sighed, but nodded.
"I know that, but you didn't know what you were doing when we first started fucking, but I taught you how to please me and I'll teach you how to do this too."
"What I lacked?" Steve said, his ego clearly bruised.
A month ago he would have hated that, but now he would happily cuddle up to Steve and Netflix and chill all day, while letting his Alpha dote upon him and demanding food be brought to him and his feet be rubbed. Steve seemed more than happy to give Tony anything he wanted and Tony couldn't be happier about it.
There was a beat of silence where Steve realized what he said and Tony's heart froze, before speeding up until he thought it might burst out of his chest.
That seemed to break the ice at least. Tony and Brock started chatting after that, teasing each other, all laughs and smiles. Steve and Sam were mostly silent, watching their Omegas like they were celestial beings sent down from the heavens to grace them with their presence. When the night ended Steve offered to walk Tony home. Tony just laughed at that.
Tony rolled his eyes.
"Stupid, stupid Omega," Brock teased. "Why would you do that? You can't hate Alphas so much that you'd throw away what is potentially your only chance at happiness?"
God, he loved that sound.
Steve nodded, whimpering into his mouth when Tony kissed him again.
Tony's pout gave way to a devious smirk and Steve cursed, his eyes snapping back to the road.
"You know I'd do anything to please you, baby."
"I hate you," Steve mumbled into his neck and Tony wriggled his hips just to punish him.
"Yeah, I can tell. Jesus, we weren't that gross when we first bonded, were we?" Brock asked Sam.
"Okay, come here,
Thanks for reading, leaving kudos, and commenting!
"Um... you're doing what?"
Tony rolled his eyes, smiling softly.
"Shut up, I don't care about that," Tony said, cutting off his nervous rambling. "Are you for real? You have that kind of money and you'd be willing to let me buy a bar with it?"
"Yeah?"
"I can't believe you haven't mated him yet," Brock said in disbelief. "You really just left without taking him home with you? What if he thinks you're not interested?"
Brock snorted.
Steve laughed.
"I would never force myself on you, Anthony."
Tony pulled back, raising a brow at him.
Steve bit his lip, not wanting to get his hopes up. He was pretty sure his Omega was suggesting that he wanted to be the dominant one in their relationship. Or maybe he was just saying he didn't want to submit to an asshole Alpha. Either way, Steve could definitely work with this.
"Trust me, we have a
Tony rested his hand on his flat belly and all the eyes in the room went wide and congratulations and cheers went off after a moment of shock. Steve was the most shocked though and it took him the longest to say something.
"You'll find him somehow," Brock assured him. "When you do, just make sure you at least get his name."
Steve groaned, turning off his bike, and let Tony pull him in for a kiss, but he stopped Tony when he tried to undo his pants.
"Yeah, I kinda got that," Sam said, resting a hand on Steve's shoulder. "You okay, man?"
Scott?
"I don't...Dad, I'm sorry…Don't be mad."
"I thought we've established that we're not having sex?"
away if you met
Tony pulls his lips into a straight line instead of upwards, a sorry excuse for a smile. He hides it away with a hand to his face, closing his eyes tight as he shakes the expression away. It’s hardly the first time Tony feels a little toyed with. That’s pretty much how his life has been. Rich parents but drunkard dad and neglectful mother turned comfortable lifestyle drowned in whiskey turned a good relationship masked in secrets turned awful revelation but with his beautiful sons at the end of it.
“A few years.”
Tony looks pale, like somebody had punched him in the gut.
“It’s haunted and you’re an idiot for staying there.”
On my phone.
"You're being difficult, Tony," he tells Tony, who doesn't hear because he's far too deeply asleep. Steve sits up and places both hands on his hips. "I haven't even finished telling you what happened during my mission last week."
indeed.”
He's awake in bed with nothing else to do. It's not technically a new problem; Steve himself keeps odd hours at times. And while his insomnia had often been remedied with a trip to the gym, this time, he doesn't really want to leave their bedroom.
Right, Buck?
“There’s nothing here.”
“No,” Tony says. “Not boring. Clears my mind. Makes me feel...better.” Either it’s his lack of sleep or his age that’s bringing down his defenses. Maybe it’s both. Or maybe it’s just Steve. “You make me feel better.”
Steve pats the paper with his finger, a series of
So, Steve does, and when Tony crawls toward Peter after Steve shuts the door, he thinks about being suspended in time, how he's moving but he feels stuck in place. He eventually reaches Peter, many heart monitor beeps later, and he cradles his son in his arms like always, desperate but full of love.
“In all fairness, you
"You said in your letter you wanted me to tell dad that you love him.
Is… is that what you want?
“Yeah, thanks to Dad. And therapy. But
“Lisa. How much do you hate her?”
“Odd we don’t know about him,” Teddy tells Billy, then to Steve, “I’m half-Halan, see? And his name sounds like he’s from Hala?”
As they finish up, Tommy collects the empty plates to wash them. Steve offers to help, but both Tony and Tommy insist that Tommy can do it by himself.
“I did. And I told
“But it’s a little weird.”
Steve takes one final step before seizing up, falling to his knees on the soft dewy grass. The moon hangs over him glumly as the clouds roll by.
"New? Didn't you hear about my standing ovation after I read One Fish, Two Fish to a room full of preschoolers. I'm an established teller of stories."
“What?” Tony shifts his weight to turn and face Tommy. He pushes Tommy’s shoulder, forcing him to face Tony. “I don’t understand where this is headed.”
“Are you sure—”
“How’s the heart?”
“Pursuing a passion project?”
Tony closes his eyes and pushes his knees close to his chest. “Why on
“And we hardly have room for Billy and Tommy. And Teddy. I don’t think it’ll be fair to the four of you not to have any room to sleep in. That is, when they...you know. When we can finally tell them and they can come over.”
“It’s fine, Tony. Now, where were we…” Steve recalls his childhood in Brooklyn to the rest of the table. How his father had died at a young age, leaving him and his mom alone in their derelict apartment with only enough money to spare for a few more weeks. His mom, having to go work full-time as a nurse in a nearby hospital, had had to leave Steve at his best friend Bucky’s unit more than usual. Bucky’s family had only been marginally better off than Steve’s, but they had taken him in without a problem.
“And I love you.”
"I can see you from the playground, Tony."
“Drop it.”
"Tony? Tony, are you—"
Outside, the door to Tommy’s room opens and shuts. Hard.
I was just handing them the ointment.
or whatever other word Wade wants to use, I’ll castrate that boy myself.”
Peter watches as she breathes in her first breath since Peter’s birth. Peter watches her smile as she welcomes her baby into the world. The room is filled with his cries and he chokes up at the sight. He has never seen his mother before. So how does he know that the woman in front of him is his her?
“I’m forty-eight.”
He tries again, but it sends him straight to voicemail. That’s what he gets for calling incessantly in the last hour. Noh-Varr is probably tired of his phone ringing by now.
“No one is sick. And it’s not Victor. It’s not Sunset, either. Or Maya. Or Justin or Zeke.”
"All I'm trying to say is…" He sticks his tongue out as he glides the paintbrush down Tony's protruding belly. "Is that I… am… glad that that snake didn't kill me."
“Maybe Vision and your dad would still be together—”
The door to Peter's room opens, and Beth takes a peek. "Hey, guys. It's getting a bit late."
“Steve—”
The sound of a loud vibration erupts.
“Total accident,” Tony admits sheepishly. “When Pietro came for one of his surprise visits. Steve was just lounging at my office when he burst through the door. He immediately called your grandfather for a video conference.”
They hang up.
The first thing Tommy sees is a dishevelled head of white hair, like he had run a marathon across Manhattan, and the mist had frozen his locks in place. Then he finds the frown and the worry lines, the brows furrowed. He finds the green eyes, gaze soft, fond, familiar.
“Remember when your dad asked you to—”
“And this is our Captain America Memorial.”
Steve hums into his ear. "I don't really feel like changing the sheets either."
Here.
Billy squints his eyes at Steve, who doesn’t notice, then looks at Tommy, who squints back with a little nod.
Steve kisses the tip of Tony’s forefinger.
The front door opens.
Steve yawns again, then lies back down and brings the blanket up to his neck. “No,” he says, voice raspy. “Probably one of your kids. I heard someone going out before I fell asleep.”
Steve takes one step forward to follow him and to give him a piece of his mind.
the one being difficult.”
Tony’s phone rings as he buttons up his shirt. He grabs the device from their bed and answers it, tucking it between his shoulder and his ear. “Tie or no tie?” Tony says, finishing up his buttons and eyeing the ties he had lain out on his dresser.
His phone pings again.
Tony nods softly. “Okay. Okay, we’ll go out. See the sights.”
Billy and Teddy laugh along. That’s one thing this Bucky guy got alright.
"Finish up," Tony says again. "You need to get some rest."
"Peter…" Tony points his own fork at his son, wagging it. "That’s not a very nice thing to say.”
“What?”
The bed dips, slightly jostling Steve. Tony yawns from beside him and lets out a moan as he stretches his body. "I dreamed that I was fighting a snake. Except I was in your suit. And the snake turned out to be a mime pretending to be a snake. Then it rained babies. What do you think that—what the fuck?!"
Steve can be a beast in bed when he wants to be. And he’s been in bed with Tony for long enough that Tony knows his quirks and his limits—has
Like the
“Our best thing came in the shape of a seven-year-old boy, holding his favorite bunny plushie, and looking up at us with large brown eyes. Not to say that you’re a thing, but you know what I mean, Pete. Eyes like yours though, I could’ve sworn I saw so much of Tony in them, but then Tony told me that same night you came home, that that shy and determined boy who walked through our elevator, reminded him of me. And that’s how I knew that you would stay with us forever.
Oh my god, it’s burning now.
Peter nods again and disappears into the bathroom.
Hold still.
After hanging up, Tony takes his small sling bag from the bed and places his phone inside.
Peter can only look up at him in awe.
“We saw that church, right? Where your dad met your mom?”
"Home is…" Steve looks outside again. He remembers the photo of his parents, his mother holding him up. They both looked so proud. And perhaps they had been. Perhaps they still are. "Home is you. And Peter."
Tony lifts his head to speak. “I can’t have you encouraging that kind of behavior, Steve.”
And he vaguely remembers feeling scared, and he vaguely remembers calming down, and he vaguely remembers believing that there’s a cult in his dad’s attic and he should never, ever climb up there ever again.
Scott Lang.
“I shot at Peter, too, at the airport.”
Tommy folds his legs back to his chest. He hugs his knees. His vision gets blurry. He barely registers what Tony is saying.
“But you hate her.”
“Noh-Varr is 30 years old,” Tommy says from beside him.
Hey, Sam.
she’s my roommate. So I win.”
Tommy feels the tension in his body worsen. He looks expectantly at Tony, who opens his mouth to say something, only for the doorbell to take over again. It rings a couple of times without stopping, no doubt somebody pressing the button over and over.
“Steven?”
Nice.
is winning.
Don’t pout some more.
But is my face supposed to itch?
Then he wouldn’t return my texts. My calls.
He opens his mouth to say something, but without Tony’s presence, Billy just feels like an asshole trying to pry Steve’s life wide open. Steve had been eager enough to tell stories about his life all on his own, but none of what he had said had anything to do with Tony. If anything, Billy now knows more about that Bucky fellow than Steve’s relationship with Tony. He also couldn’t bring himself to ask about the relationship with his dad around. He knew Tony would shut that down without missing a beat.
Because really, if getting out of a six-year relationship hadn’t been enough of a reason to take his time, to find himself after moving to a different city, then maybe the fact that said relationship had been with an incomprehensibly evil and manipulative woman should have been what sealed that deal. The first trip to the hospital should have been enough of an eye-opener.
Steve keeps quiet.
"I don't know yet. Around. You can let me handle that."
“An artist.”
Steve holds it out. The words ‘Los Angeles’ are written across the front in large black letters. The cloth is soft, nothing too indicative of having come from the airport, but nothing that screams expensive either. It’s also two-sizes-too-small, which is par for the course with every other shirt Steve owns. “Thank you, Noh-Varr. I love it.”
What else?
The first thing Tony had done was tear down the walls that separated the kitchen, the dining area and the living area, leaving one narrow hallway to the bedrooms just beyond the front door.
“Oh, ha ha—”
Billy walks into the room with his back straight and chin high, no doubt trying to assert the last bit of dominance he has left over the situation. Billy begrudgingly hands Steve his own ice pack, then sits beside Tony to place a similar ice pack over his forehead. He inspects the back of Tony’s head as well, but doesn’t see anything to warrant any attention. Thank God for carpeted floors. Billy gives the ice pack a small shake, gesturing for Tony to take over.
“Somewhere just outside of town. I’ve been driving around in circles waiting for you to wake up.”
—the fuck?! I told you to stay away from me.
I wanna say something.
“You came,” Tommy whispers.
Steve smiles, the widest Peter has seen. "Wear it for as long as you like, Pete."
Everyone else follows suit, dusting their pajamas as they do.
The tears threaten to fall again and Tommy lets out a shaky breath. He reins his emotions in just long enough to get the words out of his mouth. “I did something stupid,” he says in between sniffs. “I did something really stupid and I don’t want you to hate me.”
"What?" Steve says and Tony's lips part in shock. Tony sits straighter, posture suggesting he wants to leap out of bed and into Peter's, but he stops.
Near as he is, he still does a fair amount of traveling. More and more these days, too. His husband Teddy is a representative for a few nonprofits and he drags Billy along whenever he’s needed in a different state, sometimes in a different country, for some assembly or party or whatever it is nonprofits do these days. He’s proud of the two of them, changing the world in whatever way they can. And with Teddy’s ever-growing influence and deepening rapport with the philanthropic community, it’s only a matter of time before Billy will be as elusive as his brother.
"Thank you, Tony. I—thank you so much."
"We had a talk earlier and he thought it was funny."
Don’t address her.
A fast guitar riff. Loud. It echoes in the room. A raspy voice comes when Tony lifts his phone to his face to see who's calling.
“Wade isn’t planning anything, Dad.” Peter winces when Tony shoots him a knowing and slightly disappointed glance. “You really trust Wade with our
Tony grunts just as Steve replies, “you can come in.”
Tony’s eyes widen, nods. “Yeah. Yeah, okay.” When Tony tells him to come up, no reply comes back.
“It crossed my mind.”
“Were these what we were actually wearing?” Tony asks.
Hold still!
Noh-Varr jolts back, dragging the chair back with him. The screech makes Tony whip his head towards him. Noh-Varr stares at Tony with his lips slightly parted. “It’s very nice to meet you, Mr. Stark.”
“It really isn’t about the age thing, see?” Billy tries again, suppressing a yawn.
“That’s my superhero.”
Billy nods. “There we go.”
Tony hears an alarm.
Teddy undoes his shoelaces. “Oh, boy.”
Peter closes the door to the bathroom. "Can't hear you! Taking a shower!"
The blanket is over Tony’s head. He’s sweating a little, shivering a bit, and there’s nothing that can convince him it’s because of the temperature.
Tony hums, locking his phone and pushing it aside with his plate. Peter does the same, though his own plate is mostly empty while Tony’s still has a few bites to spare. “You don’t have to meet the cult now, if that’s what you’re asking. And I’m not gonna ask you to invite them to the wedding.”
“Are you and Victor back together?”
“How was yours?” Tony grumbles and then scowls, more at his computer than at Bucky, although he does spare the other man a quick disappointed glance, just to be sure his intentions are not misunderstood. "That our last carton of milk?"
“Um, yes?”
"I give!" Tony says breathlessly. "I give! You have the morning breath of a god!"
Isn’t that what rich people do?
Let’s get that stuff off your face—
"No one's gonna catch me, Tony."
“Your haunted road wasn’t warranted so I’m allowed to shit on you whenever for the next two years,
“Your biological parents sound like wonderful people from what I’ve heard from Tony.”
Bucky’s Log 38 part whatever.
“Dad?” Billy asks. He places a hand over Tony’s shoulder. “Hey.”
What can I say—goes with the job.
“He’s not, Tom.”
“You’re welcome. And yeah, we can fly to Malibu. Just tell me when.”
That’s why you need to hold still!
Tony nods. “There we go.”
“Still beating.”
“Ignore him, he’s being an asshole on purpose,” Billy calls out from the stove.
Tony…
Says we can’t leave it on for more than fifteen minutes.
A few raised eyebrows land on them, a bunch of sitting ducks in the middle of a rather busy walkway.
“Asleep in the back. I put in earplugs for him.”
That was my choice.
Tony lists down two things he can smell: sweat and coffee; and then finally, one thing he can taste: more sweat.
“Whatever it is you’re doing.”
Granted, there’s a bit of a dynamic shift for his scenario. For one, Tony is nothing like Erik, and Noh-Varr doesn’t have to face Tony alone. But there is also a freshness to his situation that hadn’t in Tony’s, like a band-aid ripped from an open wound. A disgusting, puss-filled, bloody open wound. Tommy internally retches, and he isn’t sure if it’s from the thought of the wound or how much he has been waiting—dreading, more like—for this meeting to happen in the last year.
“Bring ‘em when we visit Steve’s friends,” Tony says and winks cryptically. His sons are going to have to learn the hard way.
“Well, I am proud of you, Tommy.” Tony ruffles Tommy’s hair, then smooths them out when he feels greasy product stick to his palm. “With whatever you wanna do. But, are you happy with switching classes?”

“Boxy?”
The topic of moving in hadn’t come again until months later; months filled with Steve and Tony alternating between units, even with Steve’s friends coming over and sleeping at Tony’s every once in a while. While Tony had kept waiting for the other shoe to drop: Nat being an undercover spy trying to get dirt on Tony, Clint hiding in the vents to get dirt on Tony, Sam and Bucky conspiring against Tony’s relationship with Steve, Steve turning out to be a massive asshole who only wanted Tony’s money; he had only made himself more comfortable sleeping beside Steve. It had been working in his favor so far.
. And he took care of me. God, did he take care of me. All the while, I kept thinking about what you’d say to me. What you’d tell me when you find out that I had been just like
Just think it’s for the betterment of my mental well-being.
"Right. You hear that, Pete? We have to be early."
“I should—” Steve tries, fumbling with his words.
Noh-Varr ducks his head. He closes the laptop lid and slides his coffee closer to him.
No, Tony.
Tony smiles and inches closer to give Steve a kiss. “I’m sorry. I’m not any better, accusing the both of you of...being childish.”
, you’ve done more than what mom or Vision had ever done for me and Billy, and no amount of adoption papers you might wanna unsign after hearing all of this will ever take that away from me.”
"That's not the point, Steve."
"I can't believe this, Tony. You were able to—how did—I can't—"
When Tommy had decided to move to LA two years ago, he had been less excited about the prospect of new opportunities and more relieved to finally be able to just leave. Moving even further away from his dad had probably been one of the hardest decisions he had ever had to make, but after a second trip to the hospital and a few new stitches to boot, neither of them had put up too much of a fight over the idea.
Tony squeezes Steve's hand. "What else?"
Oh, ha ha.
Steve purses his lips and nods.
I know it tears easily.
Even with Steve moving in just a month prior from Christmas, Tony hasn’t felt the pressure of having to wake up before Steve, having to watch Steve’s every move, because Steve has proven time and time again that even as they lay in their bed at night, he’s the anchor that keeps Tony grounded, that keeps him safe and warm.
"So you know?"
haven’t seen my parents in ten years.”
“That would be correct. We have been dating for over a year now.”
“We going somewhere?” Billy asks beside him. He doesn’t bother looking at Tony, eyes glued to his phone as he types out a text.
“—like, we can definitely do without knowing Maya and Sunset. I can’t even remember all those other guys you dated. Rumiko is fine, but that bitch dealt damage.”
Tony nods once and downs the rest of his coffee.
leaks through the ear speaker. "Just finished my workout. Thought I'd give you a call. You know, see how you're doing and all that."
“She must’ve loved you.”
I wanted to handle those Hydra agents myself.
Billy ushers Tony and Tommy to a more secluded area of the park. A lone bench remains unseated by a tree, angled mostly out of sight from passers-by. BIlly asks the both of them to sit, which Tony obliges. Tommy, preferring to sit on his heels in front of Tony, doesn’t take the seat beside him, so Billy takes that space instead.
“We all need that sometimes.”
“You want me, a forty-six-year-old man, to tell my adult sons that I’m going to Coney Island?”
“A sandwich is a foodstuff,” Noh-Varr remarks, sitting down on a chair Tommy pulls for him.
And it's a promise he's keeping.
Billy and Teddy, however, look confused, although they do thank Steve.
He sets Peter down and hands him the grater and peeled potato. For a few minutes, he guides Peter’s hands, carefully grating the potatoes into small shreds, with little success. Too much force and they might end up with a few bloody pieces of boxty and a crying child; not to mention his worried parents. So he settles for showing his kid the motion and the feel of shredding, telling him that one day he’ll be able to make boxty on his own. His eyes wander over to Tony, expecting him to be in knee-deep focus on the tablet. Instead, he finds his husband reclined on his chair, watching them with fond eyes. Steve smiles back at him, small and comfortable.
“That’s enough.” Tony extends an arm in front of Steve and the man, then taking one step forward, acting as a human barricade between them. “We have our kid with us. Back off.”
Tony leads Steve towards his bedroom with their gifts in tow. He closes and locks his door.
Don’t get him wrong, there’s still that fear and resentment whispering anxieties at him, and he can’t say for certain he won’t punch Clint in the teeth the next time he finds the courage to see him again. But he also can’t find it within himself to hold Clint accountable for every little thing, no matter how much he wants to pass the guilt to someone else.
“Not at all,” Teddy says.
Steve has both his hands raised to his chest in defeat. “I just asked him if he likes Kate!”
“It’s not just the Second World War—”
"Traffic wasn't awful either," Tony adds.
“Peter’s asleep,” Tony whispers. Behind them, Peter drools onto his shoulder.
Steve chuckles, brings Tony closer to him. “All I’m saying is, maybe you can tell them you’re doing something other than work. You
Steve places a small envelope by Peter’s feet, but not before staring at the boy, his head low and his back hunched, his lips in a constant frown. If Tony were to punch that frown off of his face, he reckons Steve would simply let him. But the frown wouldn’t change, and Tony has done far too much punching, punching the people he cares about, in the last week alone, more than he thought he would in his entire lifetime.

Tony huffs. “Fine.” He tears the wrapping paper impatiently, already expecting to see a framed photo of him and Steve. And it is, but something about it doesn’t look right. Upon closer inspection, he notices the familiar strokes of Steve’s brush work. “It’s us...at the MET,” Tony whispers.
“There is no Red God, no blood sacrifices, no cult. And he’s not a hundred and three years old.”
Tony takes a second, his tongue caught between his teeth. He gives Tommy a once-over and says, “do you miss your mom? Do you—”
The mask will shrink with me—
“I want you to know that I don’t blame you,” Tony murmurs.
“But I thought it was…” Peter spares one last glance at the set of stairs. When the coast is clear, he asks, “How young did Steve become High Priest? I thought he was younger than you.”
You wouldn’t answer my texts.
Lunchtime rolls around, and they don’t bother to wake Steve up.
“No!” Steve’s voice is deafening.
“No, he’s not!”
“Yeah, I’m not trying to get you arrested, Tony. Not when your kid’s in a coma.”
"Yes?" Steve whispers, breathless.
My daughter can’t have a faceless father.
"Es'cuse me, I need to use the bathroom!" Peter squeals, making his way down his chair and running to the only bathroom in the cabin.

There’s a loud series of
So, Steve begins.
“Dad?” comes Tommy’s frantic voice from the other side of the door. “Dad, are you okay?”
"Do you wanna have sex? Or I can give you a handjob? I can reach no problem."
