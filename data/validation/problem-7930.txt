Tony interrupts him, his mouth going thin just thinking about the heated words exchanged near a year ago.
“Yeah, you like this place right?”
“Remember how I said I don’t remember in the beginning? That was a lie, I couldn’t hear anything else but, ‘I’m sorry ma’am, you have about 7 months’”
(It’s a month later when Tony wakes up in the middle of the night and hisses, “Shit, I forgot to tell Rhodey.”)
(Tony worries and gives her the breaks she needs. Workaholic)
“Well, I’ve read articles on how doctors underestimate.”
“3 months now, but I’ve read multiple articles on how doctors are usually too optimistic.”
“I like you Tony, and I want to date you,” Steve finally pauses, and his serious gaze morphs into a hopeful smile. “Will you let me?”
“Everything special about you came out of a bottle.”
“Steve.”
“Tony darling, if anyone, I would choose you. But yes,” she flips her sunglasses down, red lips quirking a little, “no exceptions.”
The last thing she says to Tony is, “I love you too Tony, I’m sorry.”
They'll tell you his smile is beautiful and his eyes are lonely.
Tony snorts and Steve fights a smile.
“Don't be sorry, this is all me.”
“Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.”
Rhodey raises an incredulous eyebrow after Tony talks about the Avengers moving in. Tony knows that look on his face, the ‘seriously dude? I can’t tell if you’re joking or not’. Tony knows every look on Rhodey’s face, including his ‘you’re an idiot, stop that right now’ one.
“We just slept, Tony, I wouldn’t do anything you really didn’t want.”
“Big man in a suit of Armor, take that away and what are you?”
And if the Maria Stark foundation donates more to research on terminal illnesses, Rhodey is kind enough to not point it out.
She closes her eyes, and days later, it’s determined she’ll never open them again.
Tony is constantly at her bedside when she becomes too weak to walk around. He holds her hand and whispers anything, everything. He talks about work when Rumiko is too tired to answer anymore, and finally sings when her breaths are soft and her grip in his hands weaken.
Tony almost chokes on his coffee, but Steve’s smile turns into a smirk. “You know, I think that sounds like a great idea.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, petting Peter’s hair. “I get scared.”
“So where does that leave us?” Steve asks.
Steve learns about him too, about how much he likes Steve on his knees, mouth soft and open, and coming across his face, streaking his beard with white. The first time they do that, Tony keeps his fingers twined through Steve’s hair and kisses him slowly, deeply.  “You alright?” Tony says softly, wondering if he’s pushed too far. Steve nods and kisses him again, his hands running up and down Tony’s thighs. It’s an awkward angle, but they stay like that for longer than necessary, and Tony feels something important shift inside him.
“I wasn’t talking about Peter,” he says quietly. “I was talking about you.”
It hadn’t taken much to get Steve off last night, whatever happening with his body making him so hard and so sensitive that working him to an orgasm had been easy. “Take off your sweater,’ he says and after a moments hesitation Steve obeys. Tony’s not used to obtaining Steve’s acquiescence so easily, and his stomach flips a little at the easy way Steve takes orders.
A sad smile crosses Steve’s face and he stares at the sleeping boy in Tony’s lap. “He’s a kid. He’ll be OK.”
Sam and Natasha are better at giving Steve his space, have patience for the ages, but Tony’s never been good with patience, going too fast and too headlong into everything. He watches Steve practically flee the room and it only takes a few minutes before he’s pushing back his own chair, and following him out.
“It’s ok, relax,” he mumbles. Tony keeps his hands on Steve’s shoulders and decides to focus on just his neck. He puts all his weight into his thumbs, kneading them up and down Steve’s neck, till he’s pressing his forehead into the pillow, arching up into Tony’s touch.
“You cold?” Steve shakes his head but slides under the covers, laying flat on his back. Tony dims the lights even lower, so he can only see the outlines of Steve face. Before they get started, he moves his hand up Steve’s torso, laying a flat palm on his chest, feeling the comforting beat of his heart.
Peter’s eyes drop to the floor, and for a change, he seems at a loss for words.
“You know, we could do more of this,” Tony waves his fork between them, blushing for some incredibly stupid reason. “I mean, if you wanted.”
“You were flirting back,” Tony said from the bathroom doorway. This time Steve looked up, his face lit golden by the fire. “That’s what really bothered me.”  He held Steve’s gaze for a fraction, before shutting the door.
“Is it cute snoring? Or like the loud, smother-him-with-a-pillow snoring?” Nat’s voice drifted up to him as he reached their table.
“Look who’s walking around! We missed you, man,” Sam turns their handshake into a loose bro hug and from the outside it all looks fine, like Steve just returned from a short trip to DC. But they know better, and Tony can sense the wrongness in the rigid way Steve stands, how his right hand keeps curling and uncurling into a fist. Nat hugs him again, running her hands up and down the gray sweatshirt Steve usually only wears to sleep. When she pulls away, her eyes are wet.
“Do you think it will help him right now? You want me to shove that report in his face? So he can see what was done to him?”
He lifted his head from Steve’s shoulder and looked him in the eye. “I meant what I said. This is not going to be easy Steve.”
“Oh.”
“Late last night,” Bruce says.
He doles out instructions, treating this like any other mission, while Tony grips the edge of his chair till his knuckles turn white. The thought of sending even a grown Peter into the tunnel would make his stomach churn. He’s not doing it to a kid whose cheeks are still all baby fat.
’ and I tried to tell her, I really did, but I just got scared or nervous or whatever, until I finally just had to get it over with because it was seriously ruining our friendship and like, that’s the last thing you want to do, right?”
“I’m Tony, This is Steve,” Tony said.
He’s out the door before she says anything else, taking the steps to his room in a sprint. He bursts through the doors to find Peter, sitting up in bed, wailing in fear.
“Look, despite what he claims, Cap here slept like a log.”
“Pete…” Tony starts but Peter cuts him off.
“On his thigh!” Tony said. “It was on his thigh. Like, way up on the inside of his thigh. I was helping him out.”
“Yes.”
Peter untangles himself from Steve and reaches over for Tony, who happily accepts the warm, sleepy bundle.
“I know you don’t want to do this Tony, but —”
“Not unless its urgent, I said. I was wrapped in the suits and I thought—” Tony stares at the floor. “I thought, it can wait a few minutes.”
“Jesus fuck,” Steve whispers, his chest heaving, as Tony releases him.
Tony sets the table, and they negotiate a three bites of dinner to one sip of juice ratio for Peter before they sit down to eat.
“It was real big,” Peter whispers in awe, as Tony wipes at his face with the sleeve of his shirt. He abandons the idea of going back to the lab and kicks off his shoes, Peter attached to his side like a koala.
After almost a week of radio silence, Tony finally breaks.
“Nah,” Tony says, taking a closer look at the images FRIDAY sends to his phone. “I should go. Might be a heavy weapons thing.”
“Bruce?” Tony calls, walking through the large steel doors. On the surface, everything looks normal. No smoke billowing out of broken windows, no visible structural damage.
“What the hell is that?”
Tony spent a long time staring into the fire and thinking about Steve’s question before doing what he usually did when he felt out of sorts. He went to see Peter.
“Oh.” Steve grabs some water and sits on one of the benches that circle the boxing area. “Is that for me?”
“No, like this,” he orders and starts to separate the blocks by color.
“She’ll follow your call Tony,” Bruce says. “In the end, it’s up to you.”
“What?” Steve frowned at him as he got into bed.
It would be tempting to run to the lab, to bury himself in the things he thinks he has control over but even he’s not that big a coward. There are a few last minutes things to take care of—modify the suit, create back ups of back ups incase something truly catastrophic happens, clear out the hanger in case of fire—but he knows the team will take care of that.
They wait well outside the radius of the tunnel, watching as Bruce and Hope start the countdown sequence. May grips his hand tightly, her face turned into his shoulder. Steve stands on his other side, stoic but steady. Tony can hardly bear to look. Instead of watching Bruce and Hope, he keeps his eyes fixed on Peter, what little he can see of him, and starts hoping. He doesn’t pray to any god, just whatever force there might be that could push Peter safely back out to them. He’s never felt this out of control, this overwhelmed, and for a regrettable second, wishes he had never decided to enter that apartment in Queens.
“That’s not why I’m here,” Tony says and Steve catches site of the folder he’s holding.
Later, after they’d ruined the sheets and Steve lay sprawled naked across the bed, Tony’s hands began to wander again, stroking Steve’s back and petting his hair. This time, there was no reason to pull back, no need to stop.
Steve can only nod, his breath coming out in harsh, staccato gasps, his hair plastered with sweat.  Tony grabs him by the hips and does it again, and again, until Steve wraps his own hand around his dick, stroking furiously.
“Look, don’t punch me ok,” Tony interrupted. “I’m going to try something,” Holding his drink in one hand, Tony sat next him, placing a hand on Steve’s shoulder, trying to squeeze out some of the tension.
“Hey, I don’t snore.” Tony didn’t even have to feign indignation. Pepper had never once complained about him snoring.
“He’ll spill that all over his shirt.” Steve finds a smaller tumbler, fills it halfway and hands it to Peter, who turns up his nose.
“It’s a club drug, right?” Maria Hill says. She’s lately never not in the room if Fury is.
It takes them two days--two more long, sleepless days--to search the woods where he’d been found. They find bits of his uniform, torn to shreds, in a clearing a half mile from their drop site. From there, they follow a trail of dried blood and bare foot prints back through thick underbrush until they stumble upon the farmhouse. It makes his stomach curl to have to go inside, but they do, the four of them. By the time they come out, Natasha’s eyes are red with tears, and Tony has to drop to his knees to vomit.
Still half hard, Steve stretched his back like bow, either eager to push away from Tony’s relentless touch or closer to it, even he wasn’t sure.  With a fluid motion, Kara stood up and slipped off of her robe, showcasing her breasts. They were perfectly shaped, to Steve at least, small and firm, the nipples a dark pink that immediately drew his eye.
“Tony,” Steve gasps a little and begins to rock his hips again, just like last night. Tony holds him still, stopping the motion.
“I know,” Steve mumbles around his toast. He portions eggs out on to two plates and carries them over to the island. They sit side by side in comfortable silence, Tony staring at his tablet, Steve watching the news.
“We sedated him,” Sam says coming up to him. He’s covered in dirt and grime, the silver edges of his Falcon uniform dingy. “Bruce said it would be better than trying to talk to him too much.”
. This is looks like a bedtime book. Are you sure you want to read it now?”
Steve whimpers again and fumbles for Tony’s free hand. He crushers their fingers together and brings Tony’s arm around his chest.
“You’re telling me.” Tony smiles. He’s been in Steve’s spot before, has done more than his fair share of hospital vigils over the past few years. It’s always harder to be the person waiting by the bed than to be the person in bed. The slump of Steve’s shoulders, the slight tremor in his voice telegraph that he’s spent a few days sleepless and scared.  “You should get some sleep,” he says, even though he knows Steve won’t listen.
Bleary eyed, he stumbled to the door. Steve waited in the hallway, looking as wrecked and tired as Tony felt. Tony held out his hand and led Steve inside, instructing FRIDAY to turn on the do not disturb function.
“Is it? Anytime someone gets within 2 feet of him, you’re at his side. For four days you’ve run interference on anyone that tries to get near him. He’s had a Tony Stark shadow following him around all damn week. You know there’s even a meme about it? “If you want to find Tony Stark in a crowded room all you have to do is look for Steve Rogers.” It’s all over the internet.”
They pull apart and he collapses on top of Kara, spent and exhausted. In that white space between waking and sleep, Kara traces little kisses alongside his face. Tony strokes his back, petting him as he comes down.  Feeling shaky, he pulls out and rolls over onto his back, his cock splayed against his stomach. The bed dips as Kara rolls away and kisses them both goodbye. Shortly, Steve hears a door open and shut softly.
Tony rubs slow circles on his back, talks softly to him until Peter drifts off. He sleeps soundly for he rest of the night, but Tony stays awake for a long time, thinking about the past, the future and the trusting little body glued to his side.
“You think I wanna do this?” Nick leans forward, his patience also wearing thin. “I read Stark’s report and I saw the photos. I can put enough together to know that what he went through was some fucked up shit. But he either talks to me or Everett Ross and the CIA come banging down your door. Which do you think he’s going to prefer?”
He manages a few hours of distraction before finally giving up the ghost, his lab a shamble of half-started projects. Steve’s kept his location on private, so Tony doesn’t go looking for him, for once willing to respect his boundaries.
It’s a wet, messy kiss, Tony chasing Steve’s mouth as he keeps thrusting. He keeps a hand on Steve’s neck, pushing his own sweaty temple to Steve’s forehead.
“FRIDAY, I need a location on Peter Parker,” he says. Privacy be damned.
“That’s it, Rogers, that’s it. Just a little deeper,” Tony’s voice is constant. “I bet she feels so fucking good. You’re perfect like this, you know that.”
“You’re fucking perfect, you know that,” Tony whispered.
“Sure Peter, what is it?”
He settled on Die Hard 2 and watched propped up on a few pillows while Steve lay flat on the bed.  “Is this the one in the tower?” Steve yawned again, his voice coming from beside Tony’s waist.
Sam sits on one of the overstuffed leather sofas in the waiting room, staring up at them both. “It was bad, how we found him.” As a habit, they’re not in the business of keeping details from each other, but something in Sam’s voice lets Tony know he doesn’t want to keep going.
“Bruce said you had a few broken ribs. I hope they gave you the good pain drugs.”
“Try to relax. You don’t have to do this now.”
“Fuck.”
“Still, I thought Peter might want it.”
“You’re telling me I’m doing LEGOs wrong? I have a degree from MIT you know that right?”
“Are you talking about me?” Peter pauses pretending to swim through the tub.
“That’s what saved me from a total free-fall. Came down at a quarter of the speed.”
“You sure, Rogers?” He asked again. Steve held his eyes and nodded.
“Bruce—”
Pushing up his sleeves, Tony watched as Kara moved her mouth over Steve’s.  They’d only been kissing for a few minutes and he could already see the bulge growing in Steve’s pants. While her mouth worked, her hands wandered across his body, stroking his face, rubbing his thigh. Still, Steve was stiff, his body coiled as he processed all her touches, unsure if he wanted to give into or fight the sensations. And he still had on too many clothes, a clear barrier for what they wanted to accomplish.
The room plunges into darkness. There’s just enough light that Tony can make his way to the door and manually turn the lock.
After a few minutes, he felt rather than saw the door open. Standing in front of him was a lovely young woman, petite with long dark hair and olive skin, and the barest hint of makeup on her face. She was barefoot, and wearing a silk kimono that just barely covered her breasts.
“It’s alright, baby, it’s alright,” Tony answers. “Steve, you’re so good. Come for me.”
There’s no discussion about who will go first, and Tony follows Bruce through the sliding glass doors. The lights in the room have been dimmed considerably and to Tony’s relief, Steve looks a sight better than he expected, with a minimal amount of wires and tubes coming out of him. The right side of his face is still a mess of bruises but cleared of blood and dirt. His mouth quirks up as Tony stands at the foot of his bed.
Too soon, Steve had pulled away, untangling himself from Tony’s arms. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and wrapped a sheet around his midsection, as if modesty was suddenly an issue.
No one quite knows how it happens.
“Called in reinforcements, huh? Couldn’t handle the kid on your own?” Tony jokes.
He woke with a gasp, startled by the image in his mind. It was still dark outside and through the open curtains Tony could see the snow still falling in light, swirling waves. Steve had turned on his side again, this time facing Tony. He slept in a C-shape curve, arms tucked under the pillow. Through the darkness, Tony could make out the shadow of eyelashes against his cheek, the steady rise and fall of his chest.  Under the covers, their knees were already touching and Tony thought nothing of moving a little closer and throwing a lose arm across Steve’s waist.
“That is not the same thing,” Tony says. “Things happen in battle that you can’t always control, Peter.”
“Alright, I know you’re tired, it’s OK.” Tony rubs his back all the way up the elevator and down the hall. By the time he enters his quarters, the kid is passed out cold. To his surprise, the room’s been rearranged. The sofa and coffee table have been have been shifted and a small play area has been set up in the corner. Steve, who he hasn’t seen all day, is tightening up the last of the screws on a small, kid size desk. Paper, crayons, books and more toys are stacked neatly in a corner.
“You never talk about her,” Tony said.
“She was a nurse?” Tony asked, even though he already knew.
“I thought it would help, you know, if I looked at the photos, the proof. But I can’t,” he shakes his head and Tony leads him inside, shutting the door firmly behind them. Steve stands in the middle of the room, and Tony can feel him take a deep breath and count to 10 before slowly letting it out. “I can’t get anything to feel right in my body. Physically, I’m fine but just everything...inside me…” he trails off, voice shaky.
“Dr. Banner, everything OK?”
Hope shakes her head. “That’s not likely. The worst case scenario is that his cells start to age too rapidly, or that his physiological response isn’t in line with his mental response.”
“Jesus Christ, what happened to him?” he asks.
When they break for the day, Tony follows Steve none too discreetly into an alcove off the main hallway, where Steve leans his hands against the glass, taking a few deep breaths. Tony can begin to see the outline of a bulge forming in Steve’s pants.
His underwear is pulled down just enough so that Steve’s erection juts painfully forward. Tony winces at site of his dick, an angry shade of red that looks like it’s been rubbed raw. He has no idea how long Steve tried to force it, attacked the problem like he would anything else, with a determination that’s almost counter productive.
“We have one more Tunnel simulation we need to finish running,” Hope says.
“Juice,” Peter says, looking up at Tony. “I want juice.”
Steve pushed the door to room 438 open and looked at Tony with an unmistakable twinkle in his eye. “You want to carry me over the threshold?”
Steve lay down next to her, and did as he was told, kissing the bow of her mouth before moving down to her breasts, taking each one in his mouth, circling his tongue around the nipple. She arched her back as he sucked lightly, pushing her hands through his damp hair. Her touch was light, just the gentlest hint at where she wanted him. Steve knew what he was supposed to do, what was expected of him now, and he wanted to do it, but a nervous, shy fluttering in his gut made him unable to move his mouth or his fingers much lower than the dip of her hips.
“Fine,” Steve says, still focused on the bed. He’s shaking out the pillow cases, as if the compound doesn’t have a cleaning service.
“Steve, I’m going to be air support along with about 8 fighter jets,” Tony protests. “I can handle it.”
“I don’t care that she flirted with you,” he said finally.  He could feel the lie through his body, was sure Steve saw it too. He looked down at his hands instead of meeting Steve’s eyes. “I just didn’t want us getting caught up in what was clearly a military operation.” When he looked up, Steve was still starring at him, mouth in that same stern line.
There’ll be a next time. It’ll be a roll of the dice as to who it will be, maybe Peter, maybe Steve, maybe him again. For now, Tony pushes the thought out of his mind, and takes what he has. The three of them, safe and together. Hurting, but not alone.
“Come here.” Tony flips back the covers, sliding over as Steve sits at the edge of the bed.
In hindsight, it seemed inevitable that he and Steve would crash into each other this way, both of them careening down different paths towards the same destination.
“Hmmm...
“Tony, I don’t think this is such a good idea,” Steve said, the uncertainty clear in his voice.
“It wasn’t a humanitarian mission, Steve, she wanted you to back up their military so she could depose the country’s president,” Tony grumbled.
“Steve must’ve fought his way out,” Sam had remarked, taking in the macabre scene in front of them.
Tony marched alongside him, only a fraction less furious. He wasn’t sorry for dismantling the ambassador’s flimsy excuse for help, but how quickly he’d snapped had surprised even him. One minute, they were discussing a potential mission informally, the three of them huddled by Steve’s seat. But then she had leaned forward, brushed her hand along Steve’s leg, and the next thing he knew, Tony had hacked into a few secure servers.  By the time she made a formal request for help, he had more data then he needed to prove an ulterior motive.
But a couple of weeks ago, over too many Asgardian ales (thank you, Thor!) Tony had pushed the subject of his sex life, or lack there of, causing Natasha and Banner both to flee the room.
“She’s ready Rogers. You can already feel it,” Tony said, pushing Kara’s panties aside and sliding his finger through the wetness.
“Mr. Stark?”
“You think he’d tell me?” Tony asks, knowing how tightly Steve keeps himself to himself. Bruce just smiles, and surprises him. “Yeah,” he says. “I do.”
“Oh god, oh fuck Tony,” he’s practically begging but Tony pays him no mind. “Can I take these off?” he asks and Steve grunts out an affirmative, pushing at Tony’s underwear. He kicks it off and lines their cocks up together, almost passing out himself from the pleasure.
“Did you win?”
“I think you’re being a bit dramatic,” Tony rasps.  He’s under heavy sedation and, aside from the ice cubes Steve runs over his mouth every so often, still not allowed any fluids.
Tony is terrible at guessing ages, the kid looks to be about three, maybe four. “Do you know who I am?”
“I mean, even for us, this is weird,” Natasha says. “How are we supposed to change him back?”
“I’ll be fine,” he says. There’s nothing more he can do in the lab that Bruce and Hope don't already have covered. “Peter, you good hanging here with Steve?”
Tony is in his lab, elbow deep in upgrades to the Spider suit, when FRIDAY overrides his Do Not Disturb protocol for the second time in 20 minutes.
Steve looked aghast. “Wait, you’re betting on us?”
“I tried,” Steve says, the color rising in his cheeks.
“Neither,” Tony says, finally moving his feet. He’s been hovering for the better part of 10 minutes. Waiting and watching as Steve pounds the shit out of a punching bag. Sweat drips down his back, creating a long, damp V where his shirt sticks to his skin. A few days ago, there was a good chance that Steve was dead. Right now, you wouldn’t be able to tell that a single thing was wrong with him. At least not from the outside.
“Any objections to adding Iron Man to the detail?” Ross asks again.
“Hey buddy,” Tony says in wonderment. He crouches down until he’s looking into familiar big, brown eyes.
“Tony—”
It wasn’t just her touches, though that was crucial, but the fact that Tony had stayed. The way he touched Steve now was as arousing as it was assuring.  He felt safe, less confused and adrift then he had in months. Sex wasn’t a total mystery to him, he knew how all the mechanics worked, but this was something new, uncharted territory between the two of them. He had only slept with women before, didn’t know anything else, but as Kara kissed him, he knew he wanted Tony near him, wanted to feel him as intimately as he could. Before he could change his mind, Steve turned his head and kissed Tony. It was different. Coarse stubble a change from her softness, Tony’s lips firmer and wider.  As his mouth melted against Tony’s, his stomach curled with a different kind of heat and anticipation. He pushed timidly until Tony took control of the kiss, cupping the side of his face and holding him firm, pushing his tongue into Steve’s mouth, taking Steve’s tentativeness as an invitation to keep him underwater.
“What was Peter doing in the hanger anyway?” Steve asks. He, at least, didn’t abandon Tony.
“Maybe in the morning,” Tony concedes.
“I’m the one who almost died,” he says. “I think that deserves at least a text message.”
“What gave you that idea?”
They should go get dinner or he should call a car to take Peter back to Queens, but neither of them are much in the mood to move.  They talk quietly for a long time, about the mission and the simulation and how the hell Peter managed to hack into Tony’s medical file. They talk until Peter starts to list onto his side, so Tony drops a sofa pillow onto his lap and let’s Peter rest his head. He flips on the TV and leaves it on whatever movie happens to be playing, idly stroking Peter’s hair until his breathing becomes deep and heavy.
“It’s not that simple, Peter. Something bad could happen.”
“There’s relaxed and there’s comatose. Try to find a middle ground, please.”
“Stark, calm down.” Fury is as steady as ever, leaning back on Bruce’s sofa. “We’re asking for a debrief is all. We need to know what he remembers and what he doesn’t. That’s it. No one is interested in harassing him.”
Tony feels almost faint, blood rushing from his head, as he listens to Hope and Bruce run through the timeline. It’s Steve’s hand on his knee that brings him back.
“Pulse is sluggish.” He keeps his fingers on Tony’s neck but cranes his head up towards the sky as he hears the whir of air support.  They’re surrounded by a thicket of tall pine trees, and Tony already knows there’s no good place to land. They’ll have to carry him to a clearing.
Peter digs his fingers into Tony’s neck, burying his face. “There was a monster,” he manages to gasp between sobs. “It was chasing me.”
It’s just past 1 when May comes into the lab. The lab is usually his refuge but it feels oppressive right now, their combined worry suffocating. Tony’s not a man who rattles easily, but May’s arrival means he can no longer put off what he’s been dreading.
“Was he any trouble?”
“I don’t want you out there all alone,” Steve says, his voice low and strained, chest still heaving. “I’m worried about you.”
About a dozen different emotions fly across Peter’s face, but he clamps his mouth shut tight, just clutches the strap of his backpack a little bit tighter.
Steve nods again, meets Tony’s gaze. “He’s a strong kid, Tony. He’ll be fine.”
“I’m not sleeping with them,” Tony said quietly. “It’s just,” he waved his hands around a little. “Showmanship. It doesn’t mean anything.”
Steve takes his hand, and kisses the inside of his palm, pulling Tony closer with his leg. They’re both a mess, showers and a change of sheets in their future, but he lets it be for now, lets them unburden themselves with each other.
He takes a deep breath and straddles Steve’s hips, careful to keep his own weight on his knees and heels. He places both hands on Steve’s hips, before firmly pushing them up his side. Steve lets out a loud exhale at the sensation and Tony does it again, using more pressure this time, and digging in his thumbs. He presses them all the way up Steve’s back, trying to loosen the thick ligatures of muscle.
“Sam’s bringing me a pizza because the intern dinner was not that great. It was all cheese and weird meat.”
Even in their brief encounters (these things are over in a matter of minutes) Tony learns about what Steve likes, how he crumples when you pay special attention to the spot under his jaw, how he likes to be stroked quickly and firmly, how pinning his hands down, even slightly, gets him rock hard.
There are tears, even a little tussle as May tries to wrangle Peter out the door, until finally, he wraps himself around Tony’s leg, clearly upset.
“I acted like a dick. I know that,” he said. Steve didn’t correct him, just shook his head. “I’m sorry I ran, ok? I just…” he trailed off, unsure of what he’d even come here to say.  He had driven four hours and each second had been filled with the need to ease some of the pain he’d caused. Now that he was here, words were in short supply.  “I don’t want to hurt you,” he said.
“Are we sure it’s him? Do we need to do a DNA test or anything?” Natasha says. She’s perched on the edge of the sofa along with Sam, having been summoned there by Bruce.
They laid still for a few minutes, harsh panting filling the room. With the fog of desire and sex lifting, Tony came to his senses. “Shit.” He cursed and rolled onto his back, trying to get his breathing back under control.
“Tony,” Steve says again, begging for permission as his hips stutter.
He doesn’t want Steve to beg, that’s not what this is about, so Tony speeds up his strokes, remembers that Steve likes it firm and quick, and works him until Steve’s eyes are shut tight, his nails digging into the arm rests of Tony’s chair. Steve lets out a groan at the change of pace, something between pain and pleasure that makes Tony press their bodies closer, till his leg is wedged between Steve’s thigh. He pushes Steve’s legs open just a little wider, and it feels good enough that Steve’e mouth drops open, a long, low moan escaping his lips.
For a long time, neither of them move, until Tony’s arm goes numb from being trapped under Steve’s chest. He wiggles his fingers and Steve gets the hint, shiting enough for Tony to free himself. Tony doesn’t go far though, just rearranges himself so he’s draped over Steve’s back, an arm wrapped around his waist.
Tony’s dreams were fragments of heat and desire, images and flashes of all the things coiled inside him that he hadn’t dared to think about in the light of day. When he woke up, he was hard and aching, his erection resting heavy against his thigh. He groaned and tried to untangle himself from Steve’s grasp but Steve, still half asleep, pushed back against him, rubbing his backside against the hard length of Tony’s dick.
“Can I come in?” He opens the door without waiting for an answer, finding Steve clad only in a towel and hunched over the sink, breathing hard. Toiletries are scattered cross the clean slate floor.
Right after, in those crucial, post-orgasmic moments, Tony had cupped the side of Steve’s face, searching and failing for the right thing to say. Steve excused himself from the sofa then, stripped down to his undershirt and walked away, leaving Tony a little shell shocked. It was bound to happen he told himself. They’d come a long way back to each other, from the Accords and Bucky and finally defeating Thanos. It was stupid, frankly, that they hadn’t already done it.  Plus, it was only sex.  A physical build up of desire and need, that, once excised, didn’t need to happen again.
He takes Peter to his room, and settles him into the far end of the bed. “You gotta pee or anything? I don’t want any accidents in my bed.” Tony tucks the blanket up around shoulders. Peter blinks sleepily as Tony pushes back his hair. “You good, kid?”
There were so few ways to get close to Steve, who kept himself closed off from almost everyone on the team, even Sam sometimes. He was a leader first and foremost, but far different than Tony, who didn’t mind if people saw his flaws or knew his illicit past. Steve’s leadership was of the stoic kind. He was kind, generous, never too harsh, tough but fair, an almost unbearable moral compass by which to orient themselves.
“Think you can work one out? I’ll turn my back or stand guard or whatever.”
“Do it again,” Peter demands so Tony does, even though his ribs protest mightily.
“You know, I’m getting pretty tired of people yelling at me.”
“This is ridiculous,” he protested. “There’s no way this happening.”
What language fails to do, Tony tries to accomplish with his hands. Somewhere buried inside Steve are the memories of what he went through, the horror and fear and sadness imprinted not in his subconscious, but in his body. Like memory, encoded not into the recesses of his mind, but in the muscles of his lower back and shoulders, in his strong thighs and massive biceps, into the deep tissue that runs along his thick, yoke of a neck. He doesn't worry about being gentle, not right now, and wants only to remind Steve that he’s safe in his own body, safe in Tony’s tight grip. Tony tries to work those memories lose, release whatever fear remains inside him, that’s kept him so afraid of touching himself.
help.
“What?” Tony looked up, mid-chew.
“Landing the jet outside the perimeter of a known Hydra base. I don’t...” he pauses again and takes another breath. “I don’t remember how I got into the woods, or into that house.”
“Juice! I want juice!” Peter practically screams in his ear.
“Does it feel like just sex?” he asked, leaning in till their foreheads touched.
“I did not get kicked out, ok. I just came to check in on Peter. That’s it.”
“Yes, it is. You thought she was flirting with me and you flipped out.” Steve stood up and laid his hands on his hips. His voice was calm but his posture demanded an answer.  “Why?”
Tony smiled against Steve’s neck, and pulled down the collar of his t-shirt to bite along his clavicle bone. “Sleeping next to you, and not being able to touch you, not like this, was torture.” Steve grasped at Tony’s hips and pulled him closer. He groaned as Tony bit down hard. “The first time I saw you in these damn pajamas, I thought about making you come in them.”
“Can we read a story?” he says through a yawn.
“Steve let me drink a soda.”
“Alright?” Tony asks again, and Steve says yes, slightly louder, through clenched teeth.
“Not yet,” Tony says, not sure how much longer they can hold him off. He’s Steve to them, but to the rest, he’s Captain America, a highly valued government asset.
“Anyway,” Peter said, not letting up.  “I think it’s cute. You’re switching place cards so you can sit next to Steve. Like I always swap seats so I can sit next to MJ.”
“You know, you pretend to be all tough and moral but when a pretty woman comes along, asking for help with a military coup…”
Tears slide down Peter’s face. “You can’t do that again,” he says. “You can’t.”
“That’s still three days of being unconscious.”
They walked further down a dimly lit hallway with rooms down both sides. Pendant lights, brass fixtures and the marble floor kept it from feeling seedy, but it didn’t help Steve’s uneasiness.
“No, this is the one where she’s trapped in the plane.”
“Faster,” Steve says as his hips buck into Tony’s hand. “Please, just a little faster.”
“You gonna do my laundry now?” he asks, buttoning up his shirt.
It was Tony’s turn to glare. “That was an unintended side affect! Plus, she was practically giving him a hand job in public.”
“Fuck, Tony. I know that. Everyone knows that.” He leaned in, took Tony’s face in both hands and kissed him again. His chest was heaving a bit, his breathing going ragged, as Tony finally moved aside the cotton and curled a hand around his bare cock. Steve slammed his head back against the door and cried out at the touch. He was slick and hard in Tony’s hand and made perfect little sounds as Tony jacked him, in deft, quick strokes. He wanted to draw it out, make it last longer or make it more special, but Steve kept his hands tangled in Tony’s hair, and kept saying his name softly with his eyes shut, so Tony didn’t tease, only gave Steve what he wanted till he let out a soft cry and spilled hot and white all over Tony’s fist.
“A little bruising. It’s nothing.”
Peter nods, his expression blank. “She died. In a crash.” He marches the Black Widow figure over to Tony, making her crawl across his arm. The Hulk one he makes stomp across the bed.
Steve ignores him and answers anyway. “Yes, it is,” he says so matter of factly it turns Tony’s insides into ice. “But, there’s no medical evidence of that, so no, I don’t think so.”
Tony blinks back the sudden spring of tears. “That’s right, Peter. I’m always here.”
There are questions as to what Peter remembers, what he doesn’t. On the way up from the hanger, Tony had asked gentle but probing questions, that elicited little information. He knew who he was, knew Tony and Steve and the Avengers, but blanked at mentions of Spider-Man or his parents.
“You know, you’re not even supposed to be here,” he said.
“Don’t fall asleep on me Rogers, you’ll make me look bad.”
Steve smothers a laugh and kneels with Tony next to the tub. He rolls up his sleeves and plunges his hands into the bathwater. He scoops water into one hand and presses the other one on top, in a sliding gesture. The friction causes the water to squirt out, hitting Peter all over his face. The kid loves it. He howls with laughter and makes Steve do it again and again, until there’s more water on them than in the tub.
“Start with a small taste, Rogers,” Tony said. “Use your tongue first and then your mouth.”
“That’s not going away, Steve.” Tony says. He glances down at the bulge under Steve’s towel, and dares to places a gentle hand on Steve’s hip.
“You should tell him,” Bruce says. “Explain what could happen, what he might see in there.”
“Fuck,” Tony curses and Peter’s eyes go huge. “Sorry, buddy. I’m a little stressed out.”
“How are you?” Steve folds a stray blanket, tosses it over the arm of the couch.
One by one, the team scatters. As they leave, Peter jumps up to high-five everyone on their way out.
“It can’t wait. Trust me. Down to the hanger.”
He catches Steve’s laugh, blinks the tears out of his eyes.
“I don’t think it’s a spell,” he says after awhile.
“The kid is my responsibility, Steve.” He keeps going, before Steve can protest. “Before he’s anyone else’s responsibility, he’s mine. I have to keep him safe. I have to make sure he makes it back to May every night. You get that right? I wasn’t there in Manila, and I wasn’t there tonight.”
It had taken Tony a second to find his words, a weird, sudden warmth spreading through his chest. “Uh, thanks?” he says, regretting that it had sounded like a question.
“I heard. I bet he regretted every minute of it, too.”
“I get scared too.” He looks up at Steve with an almost unbearable earnestness. “I was scared last night, but then Mr. Stark let me sleep next to him.”
“Try to get some sleep,” Tony says. He shuts the bathroom door behind him, and thumps his forehead against the warm wood before heading back to his own room.
He stares up at the bright blue and green canopy above him, his focus going in and out. He barely picks up the rustle of leaves before someone comes crashing through the trees.  Out of habit, Tony raises his hand to fire with his blaster, before realizing all his weapons are offline.
“Is this your first time here?” she asked. Steve nodded as Tony resumed the slow sweep of his thumb across the back of Steve’s neck.  It was a small touch, but enough to keep Steve grounded.
“Nah, just the usual.”
“Yeah,” Peter says. And then, after a long pause. “Can I ask you something?”
“That’s ridiculous.” Tony said, out loud. Internally, his mind screamed,
They drift in silence for a while, and Steve wonders if Tony planned this, if he knew this would happen, if this is how he expected it all to go. Instead of asking, he opens his arms and pulls Tony down next to him. The questions can wait.
When Steve comes to bed, he’s only wearing the slightly too small briefs Tony left for him, the hard line of his erection curved up along his belly, the head pressed tight against the waist band. He stands before the bed defiantly, as if daring Tony to oder him to put on more clothes. Tony runs his hand up the outside of Steve’s thigh, feeling the soft hairs and hard muscle underneath. He doesn’t want it to, but it makes Tony’s stomach flip to see the trust in Steve’s eyes right now, the naked, open way he’s staring at Tony for help. It makes his heart clench, the responsibility he now has.
There are other things he wants to say too, like
“Steve—”
“Sure, stay. But only one of you gets to fuck me.”
“What’s going on?” Steve asks, standing between them. “Dr. Banner, who is this?”
“OK. OK.” Steve puts a hand on his arm, placating. “Bruce, can we keep trying to clean up that video from the hanger? Right now, it’s a just a blur of white light. Hope, can you run some tests? Figure out if there’s any radiation or anything that might tell us what happened? Stephen, I know you haven’t been a doctor in awhile, but can we make sure Peter’s healthy?”
“You might actually stay drier if you get into the tub with him.” Steve sits on the closed toilet, arms already folded across his chest.
“What do you think they wanted from him?” Natasha kicked away a lab coat that was streaked with red.
” “And that allows him to perfect the Extremis serum and now its stable. And now they inject it in…I’m clueless, J. Help me.” “
" "Then leave the planning to me. Or atleast...inform me" Tony grumbled under his breath. Tony shivered when a gust of cold air hits his face "What's the temperature here? Isn't it to early to be chilly?" "
She keeps the steady stream of hot water when someone knocks on the bathroom door and Bucky enters, in his hand a box of dog shampoo and conditioners. "Hey, saw this outside and here" he gives the box and kisses her lips "How's our wolf doing?" "He's enjoying his little spa session" Ahana replies with a laugh and gives the shower head to Bucky as she opens the shampoo and lathers it on the wolf's fur, slowly cleaning the blood and dirt in the fur, humming a soothing tone as she does it. "So, they know" Bucky starts and Ahana stiffens "About?" "Both the wolf and your absence" "And?" "They are okay with the absence and excited about the wolf. Rhodey and Steve wants to talk toy you, tho" and Ahaa huffs "Of course they do" she says and continues bathing the wolf. After bathing and drying - hallelujah for hairdryers, his fur is thick! -Ahana and Bucky brings the wolf to the common room, the other Avengers already in their pyjamas, watching some kind of movies, and sits at the love seat at the far corner. "Hey," she greets and Rhodey pauses the movies and walks towards her, stopping when the wolf at her feet growls threateningly. Ahana shushes him and beckons Rhodey "Hey" she greets him and he hugs her, tight and burries his face into her neck, the other Avenger following, the wolf unknowingly walking away from the group hug.
P.S - Whatever Tasha does, bear in mind that she is mentally tortured and brainwashed.
Steve collapsed beside Tony while Tony, using the strength left in him rolled to the side and attached himself to Steve's side. "Ugh..Tonees..come..." "I..just did..." "No,..its..uncomfortable...need..to-" "Shhh....sleep..first...wash..later.." "Atleast let me bring a wash cloth" Tony whined but reluctantly let Steve go. Steve brought the wash cloth and carefully cleaned himself and Tony, threw it near the laundry bag, rearranged the covers, set the alarm and joined Tony in the bed.
"Tony, you are the most generous person I have ever met. The amount of love and care you give to this team, always amazes me. You've been there for everyone, helped them to get back in their lives. You helped me get used to the 21st century, even after the fights and the heartbreak, you still came by my side, you've been in my corner ever since. You're my partner, my best friend, my home and most importantly, my soulmate."
” and Tony shot off the sky with the Stark Tower reducing into crumbs.
Bucky's heart is pounding against his rib cage as he sprints and skids through the compound hallways, JARVIS's warnings running through his head. When he gets to the vault, he sees atleast four HYDRA goons standing, guarding the door, their weapons held high to aim at the hostages inside. Bucky slowly shadows himself against the walls and skirts through to the vault entrance, the rest of the Avengers signalling him in his comms. A muffled thud and a knife slash is heard and Bucky sees Clint from the vents and Tasha from the other side of the floor, Steve commanding the rest to keep guard outside. Bucky silently reloads his M4A1 rifle and attaches his silencer and waits in the shadow, easily taking down the two nearest goons when he hears a gun cocking right behind him and the muzzle pushing against his temple. Bucky closes his eyes and silently curses "Well, well, well, if it isn't the great Winter Soldier." the thick Russian accent mocks him and the guy pushes Bucky to the room, the gun still at aimed at his head.
Anyway, see you in the next one!
"Hey, doll...I know this is cruel, I know it hurts, but you're a strong one, baby...I know you are" Bucky whispered "You survived 30 years of brainwashing so I know you'll go through another six months of this cryo chamber. Don't worry, doll..you're not alone, I'll be here, Tony will be here, the whole family will be here.." his breath hitched "Doll..babe..I..I'm sorry I didn't come for you sooner..I'm sorry for not recognizing you..I'm sorry I moved on from you.." his breath hitched again "But I'm not sorry for loving you..loving you was one of the best thing..the best thing that has ever happened to..to me" he took a deep breath "Come back to me..come back to me, sweetheart..and I'll be waiting for you..I'll wait for you, this time..only for you..only for you.." a few light sobs escaped his lips "Babe..I..I love you..just..just remember that.." Bucky let his tears stream from her eyes, sobs escaping his lips. A warm hand landed on his shoulder and Bucky turned to see Steve, smiling sadly at him and Bucky broke. He grabbed Steve and hugged him tight and Steve returned the embrace, running his fingers through Bucky's hair comforting him.
Steve kneeled there like a statue holding Tony's dead body, tears streaming through his cheeks and dripping on top of Tony's pale face as if his drop of tear will be enough to replenish Tony's sun-kissed tanned skin color back, it didn't. Shouts of his teammates to get back and leave the medics to do their jobs left unheard by his ears, the voices far too distant. It was until a warm metallic hand landed on his shoulder, Steve jerked back to reality and the comforting weight of Tony's body has disappeared from his arms. Reflex kicked into his body, and he jerked his shoulder in a sharp movement but the grip was strong, Steve squirmed and retaliated to get loose, but his efforts were at vain. "-eve! Knock it off! Let the medics do their job!" Bucky ordered in a harsh tone. Steve whipped his head at the voice and confronted steely grey eyes "Knock it of Steve, Tony's gonna be alright, Bruce brought his back up arc reactor that he kept for situations like this." Bucky tried to explain. It took a long time for the words to settle in Steve's mind but once he did, he blinked a few times and exhaled a deep breath that he did not know he was keeping. Wrong move. Dark spots danced infront of his eyes and the voices became slurred, exhaustion and pain rippling through his body like a tidal wave, and without a warning, Steve passed out in Bucky's arms. Nat ran towards Steve and barked at the nearest medic to bring another stretcher. "Nat-" Bucky started but she cut him off "Not now, Barnes." she told with a hard voice. Steve was brought to the MedBay in the Avenjet while Tony was immediately rushed to the nearest medical center. Hooking Steve up to the HRM monitor and inducing Odensetron drips into Steve's blood system, the rest of the of the team gathered at the meeting cabin in the jet. Seats were taken but the atmosphere was thick in tension. Each and every one of the member seething in anger and worry for their leaders. Nat, who was quiet since treating Steve at the MedBay, suddenly slammed her fist hard enough, that if she was a super soldier, the tabled would have cracked into two "Wilson. Barnes. Talk." she stared at them with murderous glare. Seeing so much resentment in her eyes, in the love of his life's eyes, directed at him for the very first time, shuddered him and he remained silent the whole long Sam took to explain. "-and she just left. Leaving Tony to die." Sam finished explaining. The silence blanketed the room again. "So, we have two missions to finish. One, destroy the new HYDRA technological weapons and two, take Yelena out." At that Bucky jerked his head up with a shocked face "What do you mean take her out?" Bucky asked "I mean kill her" "You can't do-" "And why can't we kill her?!" "She is Tony's sister-" "Who left him to die!" "She was mind controll-" "Bullshit! Don't tell me that they mind washed her until she has no humanity in her?!" "You don't know the feelin-" "Mind washed and being sterilized is the same damn thing!" "She is still a human under that!" "SHE. KILLED. STEVE. AND. TONY! ISN'T THAT PROVE ENOUGH?!" "SHE IS STILL HIS SISTER!" "I DON'T CARE!" "And I thought you wanted to clear your ledger." Bucky taunted her. "Killing another innocent girl isn't gonna prove that!" Bucky screamed. "Innocent? She is innocent?! She killed more than 50 people in one day!" "She is mind controlled! Don't you understand the term mind washed at all, Romanoff?!" Bucky counterattacked with a hard glare. Nat stared back but her eyes softened "Why...why do you care...?" "Because..because...I owe her...atleast...this.." "Why?" "I...she...we.." Bucky gave up with a sigh but Nat continued "Tell me why, and I'll reconsider" she went back to all business talk and Bucky slumped onto a chair like a puppet whose string got cut off "She..and I...we..we were dating..back when we...were at the facility..she..she was the only...source of sanity...I could go to...when they erased...my mind..she..she was the only person I could remember..no matter how many..times they erased my memories.." Bucky was sobbing and tears fell against his cheeks, Nat remained silent "Why lie?" Nat asked with a voice so soft "I..I didn't wanna lose you..so.." "Well you just did. Goodbye, Barnes." and Nat stormed off of the room. Bucky hunched over himself and cried.
Zhelaniye - Longing
” “But the Extremis serum is to form a new body part if that said one is decapitated, but Tasha is still a full body.” “
Steve got down on one knee "Tony, will you be my husband, again?"
Steve beams and claps loudly. It's almost five years since they got married but Steve will never ever get bored with his husband's achievement. Colonel Rhodey then steps up onto the stage with a glass trophy "As liaison to Stark Industries, I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark." and Tony saunters onto the stage with a sense of pride and an aura of life around him. He shook Rhodey's hands and hugged the girl behind him before stepping in front to deliver his thank you speech. His eyes roamed and settled on his husband, sitting at the VIP table smiling at him and Tony beamed back at him. "Yeah, yeah, yeah, umm.. thanks Rhodes and Irine for this award, uhh this is perfect for me because I love my job and I love protecting people and I'm crazy about inventing stuff, and..uh, I prefer people who love what I do. So, thanks to all that voted me and thanks to all that supported my work and most importantly, thanks to my lovely, beautiful husband. Thanks babe for being there with me through everything and supporting me and encouraging me and loving me. This is for you" Tony raised his trophy towards Steve as he ended his speech and walked down the stairs. Tony took the seat beside Steve and kissed his cheeks before Steve turned his head for a proper kiss. "I'm proud of you, you know?" Steve whispered and Tony nodded but then tapped his watch, indicating they will be late for the next event. Bidding their goodbyes, the couple headed towards Macy's Hospital to visit new mother Pepper Potts-Hogan.
And that, that Tony believed and from a far distance felt Tasha's blinding smile and a dust of her blessings.
"Tasha, Tasha, listen to my voice, concentrate to my voice" James. That was James's voice, she struggled to concentrate to his voice when the same voice mocking her was louder. "Tasha, I know you're strong, listen to my voice, look at me, Tasha, look at me" Tasha strained to keep her eyes open but fought through it "Tasha, open your eyes, don't close it" James kept repeating it but it was for vain, the other voice was stronger. Tasha shook her head, trying to get rid of the voice but nothing. The voice was there laughing and mocking him. Then, her body was carried and another shot of sedatives coursed through her. she lost consciousness and the world blacked out. Bruce locked Tasha into the cryo chamber and started it. The pod instantly froze with Tasha's body inside of it and the last thing Tony saw before Tasha hid inside was a small huff of "Tony..." Shutting the machine and transporting it to the other cryo chambers and locked the room shut. Tony's knees buckled and Steve automatically caught him, tears streaming through his eyes and staining his cheeks. "I..I thought..I thought she was back..my sister was back.." Tony rasped through his hitched breath. "We'll get her back, don't you worry, she will be back. She's a Stark, Tony, she'll come up like a phoenix, trust me" Steve placated Tony. The rest of the team members gathered around the couple, offering their words of comfort. No of them knew, that Bucky entered the room and stared at the cryo chamber which had Tasha. He walked towards the pod and rested his forehead against the cool metal. His enhanced hearing could pick up the faint thumping of her heartbeat. Closing his eyes, his index finger tapped following each of her heartbeat, tears staining his cheeks.
Hi, y'all!
Steve, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make but not a lot of time. So...First off, sorry for bringing up the past about Bucky and the Accords. That was stupid and reckless of me and it won't happen again. Also, you're right. About Tasha. You have the right to think that she could have killed me without a second thought. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance, cause I'm still going to find her and bring her back and I won't be home for our anniversary. I need to find her. You gotta stay safe, that's all I know. Don't worry about me, I'm fine, in a dingy motel with a second hand car. That's all. Stay safe and...I love you, baby. Always." Tony ended his call, switched off his lights and went to sleep.
P.S - For the picture of the sketch the previous chapter, the link kinda didn't pop up so, if you're interested,
The nurse then slowly tells Ahana the dosage of each capsule and leaves the couple alone. Ahana is lazily opening and closing her eyes, her hand in Bucky's arm when her eyes snap open. "Shit! Babe, my wolf!" she jerks awake but Bucky gently lay her back down, kissing her forehead. Bucky leans back and then gestures at the bed beside hers. Ahana squints and sees a human, a male beside and looks back at Bucky with a questioning gaze. Bucky huffs as he reaches the bed remote and slowly raisees the top part of the bed and gestures to his right again. Ahana looks again and this time her eyes widen. "It...it's...it's Tony" she whispers and her tears fall from her eyes.
I know it's kinda short, but I wrote this in a limited time!
(See the end of the chapter for
He turns and shoots another few goons, blood splashing against his face and slashes a few of them. By the time Steve and the others get there, Bucky is covered in blood and is marching his way to the vault entrance, punching the code and bolting to his wife's side. Ahana is barely breathing and the Iron Man suit is gently holding her. Bucky ignores the suit as he slowly carries his unconscious wife to the medical. "'ucky?.." his wife mutters softly and Bucky chokes back a sob "I'm here, moya dorogaya zhena, I'm here, you'll be alright" he syas as he carries her to the med bay.
The bell rang just after Tony hefted his red and gold backpack and his lunch, indicating the start of his new year in his new school. Hugging Jarvis and Mrs. Maximoff one last time, Tony and Scarlett raced off to their class. Standing at the entrance of the main door, a lady at her mid thirties was welcoming all the students, smiling and nodding at Tony and Scarlett before the duo approached her "Hello, kids, I'm Ms. May, how can I help you?" Ms. May asked them politely "Hi, Ms. May, my name is Scarlett and both of us are first graders, can we know where is our class?" Scarlett asked and Ms. May crouched down to their level "Go straight and after three doors on your left, the fourth one is the first grade class!" Ms. May answered back and her shifted to the brunette behind her "And who is this little guy?" Tony blushed and Scarlett gently tugged him to the front and nudged him to talk "I-I'm Anthony, call me Tony" Tony answered him back softly. Ms. May smiled softly and stood back and gestured towards their class "Well, Scarlett and Tony, welcome to SHIELD Elementary School"
Enjoy!
Harley and Peter stood in front of the three tombstones of auntie Scar, their Dad and their Pops, all peacefully gone from this world, Peter hefted his daughter Carla as he and Harley said their final goodbyes before going on their seperate ways. After Steve died, the condominium and the money were equally distributed to each of their sons and since no one lived in their condominium, the boys decided to auction them and go in their seperate ways, Peter marrying MJ with his two daughters moving to England and Harley and his fiance, Ned moving back to Singapore.
A week later, Bucky and Steve had their custom made rings in their small velvet box, each of them wearing a million-dollar smile. Bucky took out the ring and showed it to Steve, it was a simple wedding band, a small band, titanium lines at each ends and as a border to the line which had a Russian engraving "It means 'Home is in your arms' " Bucky explained, in between the titanium line, two striking blue lines ran along the sides "That's sapphire" Bucky pointed at those lines "Those reminds me of Tasha's blue eyes. Now, come on! Show me yours!" Bucky closed his ring box while Steve opened his "Wow..." Bucky gasped, the ring was titanium with gaps of resin inlay, with stones in each on of them, an Italian engraving was at the back of the ring "It means 'you gave a home' " Steve smiled while keeping his box back into his pocket, taking a deep breath, the duo stepped into the common room, where most of their teammates where lounging and watching some mindless comedy show. Steve looked up, silently asking FRIDAY to play
" he pleaded and Steve looked at Tony and back at him and nodded. Tony slowly wound his hands around the back of him successfully locking him and her in place. "
, within a minute soft crooning music played from the ceiling, startling the team at the living room, Tasha and Tony's eyes widened in shock and suprise.
P.S - This is from Tasha's P.O.V
P.S - Next chapter, is kinda.....angsty, heavy angst *blasts off*
For Steve's ring
Ahana is skimming through her file cabinet when she hears faint whimpering. Ahana stops searching and looks around her office, everything is still in it's place. She shrugs abd continues searching when the whimpering sound is followed by a scratching on the carpeted floor. Ahana gives up her searching and walks around her office, her ears keen on the sound. She goes around every nook and cranny and even as far as searching the corridor of her floor. Nothing, not even a single soul. Ahana walks back when her eyes zero on something under her table and her whole body freezes and she closes the door of her office slowly before tip-toeing her way to her desk. She holds her breath as she slowly lowers her upper body to see under her table and she takes a sharp inhale. It's a wolf. A white wolf. A huge white wolf under her table, panting and whimpering, his paws slowly pawing at her shoes. That's when she sees the wolf's hind leg bent painfully and her expression softens. She always had a soft spot for animals and the wolf looks domestic enough and she slides to her knees and slowly reaches the wolf's fur. The wolf snarls weakly and shrinks even further to the back. "It's okay, baby boy. I'm not gonna hurt you" she says and lifts her hands up and then slowly shows her palms to the wolf's muzzle.
The bomb went off even before Tony finished his sentence. Where once the scenery was a nice quiet diner, now it was destroyed. Broken windows, pieces of the diner walls pilled onto each other, damaged ceilings and lights and burning paintings filled Tony's vision. A faint stench of blood entered his nostrils making him look down, under those damages, bodies, dead and injure bodies stuck under the tones and thousands of concrete. With a still ringing ear, Tony helped himself up and made his way through the damage and helped up a few of the customers. He turned around and saw Steve helping the other half of the customers from under the concrete wedged between two seats. Sam and Bucky carried dead bodies and their waitress, Lynn was one of the bodies.
Revelation, Remembrance, Russian and Revolvers
For Russian translation,
" Natasha says gently and Ahana hums. "I already cried myself to sleep yesterday and then woke up this morning thinking...what use of me if I just keep crying and doing nothing, your brother is here, safe, maybe, but here, so think of finding him a cure" "For the wolf?" Natasha asks horrified but Ahana shakes her head.
” “Override their firewall code.” “
" Tasha hisses in his comms but Bucky doesn't rely, to stunned to see his ex-partner infront of him.
After another round in the shower- definitely Steve's fault- Tony, Steve, Sam and Bucky went to the nearest diner just a few feet away from the motel to have their breakfast. Tony kept looking around him, scanning his surrounding as if something- or someones, in this case - will pounce and attack him. Steve noticed this and wrapped an arm around him tugging him close to his side. After a few minutes, the four of them reached the diner. It was a small diner, its decorations all wood and rustic, opening the door the aroma of freshly brewed coffee hit their nostrils. The interior was like a generic diner, only with no red or pink seats, the seats were mahogany brown with tables made from original teak wood, a brown rug was placed at the middle between the seating area and the breakfast bar. Tony and Steve took one side of the sitting are while Sam and Bucky sat on the other. Tony waved for a waitress and a middle aged woman came to take their orders. "Welcome to Lynette and Jerri's Diner, and I'm Lynn, what would you fine boys like this morning?" the waitress- Lynn -  asked. "I'll take a cup of black coffee, with two sugars and a Breakfast Taco" Tony replied "I'll take the Ceylon tea, less sugar with Homemade Egg Muffins" Steve replied "Piccolo Latte with Crescent Bacon Breakfast Ring" Bucky answered "A cup of Cafe Latte and a Baked Blueberry French Toast" Sam finished. Lynn wrote down their orders and promised them the food will be served in less than 30 minutes, bid her farewell and took off to attend other customers. "So, how far are you in this?" Sam asked Tony "Remember back at the cemetery after the whole fiasco happened, she left her bag infront of the tombstone and left, so I waited until everyone left and it was much calmer, and picked it up. Went back to the tower and asked JARVIS to scan the content and we found this" Tony took out the file that he was holding in his hands. Steve took the folder and skimmed through it "Tony, this is-" "Yeah, Extremis. The one that I fought back in 2013. That's not the case here, it seems that Killian took the serum to-" Bucky cut him off "Arnim Zola to perfect and stabilize the serum. Since the Super Soldier serum was a failure, Zola too the opportunity to work on something that is already available rather than recreating something from scratch." Tony nodded. Tony continued "And then they needed a test subject, like how Dr. Erskine chose you for Project Rebirth, Zola chose Tasha or in this case Yelena as their test subject. And it worked, the serum was stable and Yelena became a superhuman." Steve nodded while still skimming through the file. The conversation quieted down when Lynn came and delivered their orders at their table. Bucky continued "Then they needed trainers, so they assigned me to train her. She was the first one of their new line of soldiers so, they trained her hard. Like real hard, and then she was sent to her first mission, she failed and Red Skull tortured her. That was the routine. Train, Go for a mission, if you succeed then you get money but if you fail then starvation and isolation in the Dark Room." "What's a Dark Room?" Sam asked "It's the room where the mind washing happens, and...god I could hear her scream her lungs out even a few blocks away. The routine went on and on, Yelena gained more experience, she got more money and she lost all her emotions. She didn't even scream when they brought her to the Dark Room, nonetheless felt pity on other kids they tortured. Its like she became a mindless soldier. Then Yelena and I were sent on a mission together and we kinda bonded, friendship turned to love and she changed to a normal person. She talked normal and she smiled a lot more. She always complained that here mind was always fuzzy, like she was supposed to remember something but she couldn't even recognize it. Months went by and we wanted to get out of there. That's when Baron Zemo took over Hydra."

?” JARVIS asked. “Cause she wasn’t in my sister mindset. She was brainwashed by Hydra. And Steve and the other Avengers fought her today and she ran away. Just like that. I need to find her, J” Tony muttered while fiddling with the handbag’s tassle. JARVIS was momentarily silent then “
Tony thought and continued his path to the kitchen. Entering the kitchen, the scene in front of him warmed his heart even more. Steve and the original six avengers are at the dining table eating breakfast and talking to each other, Pepper is at the coffee machine waiting for her coffee while busily typing on her phone - definitely to her girlfriend, May - with a soft smile, Peter and Harley are at the living room playing the new Avengers Monopoly game, Bucky and Sam are fighting over a video game, Rhodey and Danvers are at the window near the kitchen which faces the ocean talking to each other with a cup of coffee in each of their hands and finally Dodger and Figaro, a Golden Retriever and a Tuxedo cat curled up together near the fireplace.It was sickeningly domestic but Tony wouldn't change it for the world. This is his family. With a soft smile, Tony padded towards the dining table just in time for Steve to lift his face from the conversation and catch Tony's eyes. "Morning, beloved" Tony cooed as he dragged the chair beside Steve, slumped on it and rested his head on Steve's shoulder. Steve turned his head and kissed Tony's head "Morning, sweetheart" he said while gently pushing a cup of coffee to Tony. Tony hummed and used his right hand to drink his coffee and the other hand to lace his fingers with Steve's, their wedding bands clinking. "Did you sleep well?" Steve asked as he continued to skim through his emails in his Starkpad. "I...slept okay...I guess" Tony admitted and Steve gently pushed Tony until they were at eye level "What's that supposed to mean? Another nightmare, honey?" Steve asked and Tony nodded after a few minutes. "Is it about...Afghanistan?" Natasha gently asked from where she was sitting at Steve's right. Tony shook his head "Then tell us Tones, maybe we can help you, you were there for all of us, now let us be there for you..." Pepper came from the coffee machine and sat beside Tony with an arm around Tony. Tony tried his hardest to fight back his tears but it still managed to flow out his eyes. Steve swiped his thumb wiping of the tear and kissed his cheeks in an effort to gently coax Tony to talk. Tony looked around and took a deep breath and told them.
" Tasha whispered. Nat eyes went wide as she understood what Tasha told. "
Warnings -Smut (not between stevetony), Blood and Violence
Tony thought to himself as he slid down from bed and padded to the en suite bathroom to start his day. "Fri, where's Steve?" Tony asked his AI but his voice was muffled by the toothbrush hanging from his mouth. "Sorry boss, but I am not programmed to understand 'toothbrush' language." FRIDAY said with a deadpanned voice. Tony spluttered the mouthwash and looked at the ceiling - dammit, Steve! - with a horrified look. "D-Did you just sass me, young lady?" Tony asked with a mock anger. FRIDAY continued to be silent while Tony finished brushing his teeth, rinsed his mouth - again - and walked out of the bathroom " Traitor, see if I update you later. And then I'll donate you to City Council, then you'll value me" Tony muttered as he rummaged Steve's closet for a t-shirt. "That's what you said for the last 5 years, boss, and I'm still here. And to answer your question, Captain Rogers is at the kitchen" FRIDAY quipped back - is it even possible - with an amused voice. Tony hummed and finished dressing in one of Steve's army t-shirt and his sweatpants and padded his way down to the kitchen.
" "What the hell....." The hologram was filled with mission reports, medical files and tones of victim profiling but all were in Russian. "J, translate" "
Target has changed.The Winter Soldier still has my file, and he gave it to them.You need to take the file from them, and then remove them both. The place is secured.The Avengers will be removed and we shall prevail! Hail Hydra!

Letting Tasha go, Bucky wrapped his metal arm around her waist while Tony wrapped his arm around the other side of her waist. "Tasha, meet our family, the Avengers" the rest of the team smiled welcomingly as Steve came forward and hugged her. Tasha stiffened before melting into his arms "Welcome back, Tasha" Steve whispered into her ears and pulled away after giving her a light kiss on her forehead. Tasha smiled, and Tony lost his breath, that was the Tasha smile, the real and genuine one. One by one the members of the team, introduced themselves and soon enough Tasha warmed up to them. Her mind was still hazy but she was okay, she had her brother and the love of her life back by her side.
Confrontation and Confirmation
And it took its creator with it, and Steve crumbled to the ground crying for his dead husband.
" Bucky tried placating but Tasha's expression once soft hardened again "
Steve was wiping one of the customer table when he heard the jingling of the bell from the entrance of the coffee shop. After finishing high school, Bucky went into the army while Steve applied to Pratt Institute, a very prestigious art school. After multiple interviews and mock exams, he was finally accepted into the art school and was currently in his second year. Since his mother passed away last year, the money he inherited from her was not enough to sustain another semester in the art school, hence with the help of Peggy, Sam, Nat and Clint he opened a small coffee shop just a few blocks from his campus. Business increased the day he opened since most of the students at the campus knew him and the price was far much cheaper compared to other coffee shops. Steve turned and his breath hitched at the sight. Standing at the front of the door was a man, in his twenties, olive skin paled, a goatee neatly trimmed and a pair of sunglasses hiding the ever amber eyes that Steve always drew in his sketchbook. The man was wearing a grey hoodie which was too big his size that had 'MIT' printed in front paired with a white washed jeans and black Nike trainers. He was carrying a small pouch and was busily tapping his earpiece talking to someone and walking towards a far corner at the back of the coffee shop. Steve's heart hammered against his chest and he suddenly felt like he couldn't breath

Hi y'all!
Notes -
I know the Bucky/Natasha Stark relationship is kinda complicated so let me summarize it. Bucky was already at the HYDRA facility when some of the HYDRA soldier brought her in. She grew up with Bucky while Bucky never aged. They became good friends and Bucky will always come looking for Tasha when they mind washed him to keep him sane. Friendship turned to love. Unfortunately, Zemo took over the HYDRA facility from Red Skull and casted Zola, Red Skull's right hand. Zemo trained Natasha and she became loyal to him and Zola, who knew about their relationship mind washed Bucky but implanted the thought of Tasha being the target. When he was following her to kill her, SHEILD found him but he let Tasha go with a bullet to her forhead.
Steve's inner thought was cut off by a strange beeping sound. He wiped his eyes and reached for the sound. Brushing past a few debris, Steve found an earpiece, with a blinking red light. Steve immediately hooked the earpiece and switched it on with a single tap. Steve breath relieve and slumped against a wall as Tony's smooth voice washed in "
Introducing.... JARVIS!
"You okay?" Steve asks and Ahana nods "The day felt a little shitty but that guy" she gestures at the wolf and beckons him towards her, stroking his fur "made it better, so, I'm fine now" she says, a small smile in her face. Clint comes and sits beside her "So, how did you find this guy?" he asks and Ahana huffs before she recounts the whole day, her husband glowering when she says about the barista that flirted with her, Ahana laughing at it. It was late midnight, when the last of the, Steve and Rhodey, go back to their room and Bucky carries her to the room, the wolf following them. He drops her on the bed and climbs beside her and brings her into his arms when a furry furball comes in between, the wolf shoving his face and body on top of Ahana. Bucky stares at the wolf before Ahana's laughter breaks him out of his stupor and he grumps at the wolf, happily slumbering on top of her. Ahana laughs subsides "Come here, Grumpy pants, this side for you and Bucky cuddles up to her right side and dozes of instantly. Ahana rolls her eyes and kisses her forehead before kissing the wolf and closing her eyes. A faint kiss on her right and a nuzzle on her left is all she feels before she goes to deep sleep.
"Ukrast' gorazdo proshche .... chem vossozdat'. - "Stealing is much easier .... than recreating.
1.otkuda ty menya znayesh'? - where do you know me from?
" Tony said with a dreadful cold voice. "It was just like any other night, Tasha was up telling me her latest story and we heard a loud bang from the hall downstairs and automatically I scrambled to her side and she tugged me closer and hummed an unknown song, rocking me gently. Heavy footsteps were heard from outside of our room and in mere minutes, Howard slammed the door opened and looked at us with pure rage. His eyes were bloodshot red and he reeked in alcohol stench. He was holding a half filled beer bottle in his right hand and he stood there swaying. He strode his way to the bed, grabbed my arms and flung me to the floor and Tasha fell with me since I was still clinging to her nightgown. He sneered at me saying how useless both of us were. He wanted one alpha like boy but instead he got two weak ones and how I was a Stark and Starks were not supposed to be faggots and all that bullshit. Then he turned to Tasha and said 'I don't know what the fuck you're gonna be but be useful atleast.' and Tasha got pissed of and stood right in front of Howard and sneered back at him in Italian saying that Maria should be more useful when she kept sleeping with Howard's male employees. That was the final straw for Howard and he immediately smashed the beer bottle against the nearest wall and....and....stabbed right at her chest. Blood pooled at her feet and Howard's face was covered in streaks of her blood. Everything happened in slow motion and the last thing I saw before Howard knocked me out was Tasha falling to the ground dead. I woke up the next day to a bed full of my clothes stuffed in it. Jarvis was pacing back and forth packing my clothes. I asked him where were we going and Jarvis stopped and crouched down and told me that Howard was sending me to a boarding school. I asked if Tasha is in hospital if she is when will she be discharged and when can she follow me and to that Jarvis only shook his head and tears flowed out his eyes. That's when I knew that she was gone....forever and that bastard didn't even have a funeral for her. She deserved so much more than just a burial so that night, Jarvis and I creeped out to the nearby mortuary and saw that..he...he burned Tasha's body and kept it in a jar and Jarvis took the jar and drove to the nearest graveyard and gave Tasha the proper burial and said goodbye to her. That was the last I saw her, when we were 12, that's it. That night after the burial, I went to Jarvis's room and asked for a drawing of Tasha, since Howard refused to our family picture. Jarvis was a talented man, and within 1 hour, he gave me a very realistic sketching of Tasha when she was 4 years old. I took it and it was framed and I always hung it nearby my study desk which made it look like she was still watching over me, my guardian angel..." Tony finished with red rimmed eyes.
"That's the spot huh kitten? Do you feel me, kitten? Fuck, you take my cock like a cockslut, made just for my cock!" Bucky whispers against the shell of her ears and Ahana trembles. Ahana whimpers and moans, her words shredded into two words "Bucky...more" as Bucky hits her G-spot in each of his thrust. "Close baby?" he asks as he sees her face and Ahana nods and whimpers "Come baby, come from my cock, mine" Bucky whispers and Ahana screams his name as she comes, her body shaking in aftershocks. Bucky keeps his lines of praises as he tips and comes, his come sliding hotly in her pussy. Bucky braces his arms, caging her in as he catches his breath and moves to pull out but Ahana's hand stops him. Bucky looks up at her and his breath hitches at her serene face, pliant and happy "Don't...wanna...keep...you inside.." she whispers and Bucky groans but compiles. He carefully maneuvres the both of them until they are pressed side to side, Ahana's back against Bucky's chest.
Steve set the tray down and placed his coffee and blueberry pie on the table and walked away when "How are you?" Steve stopped and turned around to see Tony still looking at the screen but his fingers were hovering above the keys. Steve briefly looked at Sam and Sam nodded and he sat opposite Tony, facing him "I'm...good, how about you?" "I'm...not fine" Tony finally sighed and closed his laptop before looking at Steve. Eyes red rimmed and skin pale, Steve heart shattered into pieces. "What happened" Steve slowly asked and Tony huffed a bitter laugh "After dad and mom died, I really wanted to fight through and continue at the academy but Scar's diagnosis shattered me back. After my parents and my butler, she was the only one close to me and the one I was comfortable being myself, hearing her having cancer threw me into a hyperbole. Without telling anyone, I went off, settled myself into a boarding school and tried to forget everything...while she was suffering in pain" Tony's breath hitched "Bucky always texted me her condition but there were days that I'll never open his texts, to scared, to broken to know that whatever it was, she was going to go. But that lady fought, a year was they gave her but she was alive for two years. So, I decided to go and visit her before my third semester started and that night I had a call...from the hospital, she was dead. Just like that and I didn't even get to say goodbye!" Tony whispered roughly to himself. "Guilt washed through me and that's why every holiday I get, I'll come down here and visit her, a penance for what I did when she was sick..." Tony finished with a wet laugh and then wiped his tears before looking at Steve "How are you? How's Peg?" Tony asked and Steve took a deep breath.
and a
Hi, guys! As I said, this chapter is angsty.
Stepping out of the car, the team leisurely strolled towards the tombstone. They were fondly bickering, teasing each other until Tony turned to his right and saw a woman dressed in all black standing in front of Tasha's tombstone staring at it. Tony slowed down his steps and lightly tapped Steve's forearm to get his attention. Steve turned and asked Tony with a jerk of his chin and Tony pointed his thumb to were the woman was standing. "The past 30 years I've been coming here, only I visited her. Like I said, I lost her when we were 12 so she couldn't have had many friends...." Tony said while slowly approaching the woman. The woman stood with her back facing Tony, but she had long straight black hair which changed into a light brown color at the end, wearing a black long sleeve blouse with black skin tight jeans. She was also holding a large black handbag and was wearing a 6-inch stiletto heel. Tony slowly approached the woman and lightly touched the woman's arm "Hey, may I he-" Tony's words stuck in his throat as the woman whipped her head and stared at him. Tony's complexion morphed into pale white and his knees buckled. He staggered his steps and took one step front but the woman took her gun out from her back pocket and pointed directly at his head. "Tasha?" and the woman eyes went wide "
“I should probably go. You don’t need me here anyway.”
“He might not come back,” Hope says. “The quantum realm is unstable...one glitch and he goes subatomic, like my mother.”
“Yeah, buddy.”
“I’m sorry,” he said. He flipped back the covers and thew his legs over the side of the bed, turning his back to Steve. “That was a bad idea.” From the corner of his eye, he saw Steve’s face fall. “I’m sorry. I got carried away the past few days. I know it’s my fault. But this is...it’s just a bad idea, Steve. It was a dumb thing to do.”
“Look at me,” Steve says. He takes Tony by the shoulders and leans in close enough that Tony can smell the barest hint of his cologne. A woodsy, spicy sent. Like winter in New England. Had it been a different kind of day, Tony might have leaned in and kissed him. “We made it out didn’t we? We’re alright.”
For once Tony keeps his mouth shut, waits for Steve to keep talking.
“We had a bad dream last night,” he says, running a hand over Peter’s hair. “But nothing that’s going to ruin our day, right?”
“Mr. Stark, I’m the Falcon!” Sam zooms Peter over to him, just long enough for Peter to deliver a good morning hug, before flying him away.
His anxiety spurs him to work quicker and harder than before. He has no idea how much time’s gone by, minutes or hours or days, until Steve comes looking for him, Peter tucked against his side.
“I want red juice!”
“Last night?” Tony asks. “Did it feel good?”
Peter holds out his glass, cutting their conversation short.
Tony’s ability to focus is one of his greatest strengths and sometimes his biggest weaknesses. In his lab, everything else falls away and he keeps to the task at hand, running equations, modeling different particle scenarios until it’s well past midnight. He’s lost in his work, factoring in quantum variations on cell regeneration when FRIDAY sends him an alert.
“I’m fine,” he tries but Tony shakes his head.
“Hey, there you guys are. Session’s already started, let’s go.”
“Touche, buddy.” Tony says, swinging Peter up into his arms.
“You did so good, baby,” Tony mumbles against his hair. “You’re perfect like this, just beautiful.”
“You don’t need one to remember me, right?”
Steve walks him to the door, touching his arm lightly. “Don’t do anything stupid, Tony. If it looks heavy, call us in.”
“I’m not,” Steve says. He looks haggard, a few days worth of scratchy beard over his face and deep, dark bruising under his eyes.  “You bled out all over the damn jet. You were in a coma.”
“Come on, let’s eat.”
At dinner, Peter scrambles into Tony’s lap the minute he sits down, refusing to eat anything that first hasn’t been on Tony’s plate. Around him, conversation flows naturally but he only feels the way Peter lolls his head against his chest, the way his leg kicks against Tony’s shin.
“Go to sleep, Tony.”
“Oh my god, Tony, we’re aging here, just pick one,” Natasha shifted her luggage from one shoulder to the other. “These bags aren’t getting any lighter.”
They hold hands for a little while, a dumb, funny thing Tony admittedly is finding a lot of comfort in. He never thought of himself as the hand holding type, not until recently.
“Right,” Bruce says, moving for the door. “That’s what we need to get working on.” He heads off to find Stephen Strange, appoints Natasha and Sam to track down Scott Lang and Hope. “We’ve got this end of the problem, you handle…” Bruce waves in Peter’s general direction. “Everything else.”
“You do,” Steve said. He pushed back his chair so Tony could squeeze into the seat between them. “Just like a WWII jet plane.”
“That’s OK, ” Tony says. “No one expects you to remember, Steve.”
“Turn over,” Tony says.
Tony turns his head, places a gentle kiss on the side of Steve’s face. “He won’t,” he whispers. “Nothing’s gonna happen to me.”
“No I don’t,” Peter yelps as Tony picks him up without ceremony. Bruce grabs his hand as he passes the table.
“No, you did actually. When you were bigger.”
“Tony, I’m not kidding around. Hanger. NOW.”
“You sure?” Steve raises his eyebrows in Peter’s direction but Tony just nods.
“You can have 30 minutes,” Bruce says. “He gets to pick who stays in the room. No audio or video recording. If he shows any signs of distress, it’s over.”
“Her hand was on his knee!”
“You’re sick you know that. It’s not happening. Not now, not ever.”
He watched in silence as Natasha cut up the pita bread and sliced a few vegetables. She pushed the plate of hummus at him, as she took a bite.  “Here,” she said. “Eat.” They sat at the island, exhausted and weary, eating off the same plate.
“Steve...”
“Fine. I’ll just sleep on the jet. It’s only three nights, right? How hard can that be.”
“See you love birds in morning.” Sam let out a little wolf whistle before he disappeared down the hall.
“An acceptable risk?” He whirls around, eyes flashing. From experience, Tony knows that look. It’s the look of a teenager who is about to say something they’re going to regret. “What do you care about acceptable risks? You put yourself in risky situations all the time. You don’t care about your own safety at all.”
“Like the llama mama,” Peter says. “You’re here, even if you aren’t near.”
True to what Tony thought, Kara was slow about it, and took her time, trailing kisses down Steve’s chest, sucking at his nipples, at his hip bones, before finally reaching over his pants and cupping his erection. Steve moaned like he was in pain, bit Tony’s lip, and thrust his hips, just once, into her touch.
“Peter, Peter what’s wrong.”
“What you did could get you in real trouble. Why do you never realize that?” Steve held his gaze for a moment, before pushing open the door to their room. Like a gentleman, he waited for Tony to walk through it first.
“They’re waiting for you,” Natasha says. His good mood fades when he sees the tight press of her mouth.
He’s hot and achingly hard and Tony sets the pace for them, slowly fisting Steve’s dick up and down, creating just enough friction for it to feel good. He leans over him, breathing moist and heavy into Steve’s mouth, until Steve untangles his hand, and grips Tony’s hip instead.
He’d done this all wrong the last two times, he knows that now.
“You gotta stop messing with him, Tony. I don’t know exactly what happened last night, but he was pretty messed up this morning. If you keep pushing, you’re gonna hurt him, and hurt him bad.”
“I’m gonna come if you keep doing that,” he said.
“You sleep OK?” Tony asks, pushing a forkful of food into his mouth.
“You’re a dumb motherfucker you know that.”
“Do you remember a big flash of light that happened yesterday? When you were in the hanger?”
“Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne were testing new uses for Pym particles,” Bruce says and Tony groans.
Steve kept his eyes closed but smiled.  “You wanted me to relax, this is me relaxed.”
“Because the first time we did it Natasha ended up bunking with Peter,” Steve said. “Do you want to explain to May why her 16-year-old nephew spent the week sharing a bed with the Black Widow?”
“I have seniority here. If that counts for anything. Considering I’m the one funding this entire operation, I’m entitled to a little privacy.”  It was a desperate move, but Tony had no qualms about pulling the money card.
“Do you miss it?”
But that’s not them, that’s never been them, and conversely, Tony would argue, it’s probably the reason they still fight so much. Steve doesn’t say anything, so Tony doesn’t say anything, though he can fee the words, stupid, emotional words, fighting to crawl their way out of his throat.
Peter sits back on his legs and considers Tony’s question. Instead of answering, he launches both action figures into Tony’s side, cackling maniacally as Tony tries to squirm away and that’s the end of that conversation. Now that Tony’s officially awake, Peter crawls all over the bed, enacting an epic but hardly realistic battle scenario, jumping around until he lands in an excited and victorious heap across Tony’s chest.
“I’m telling you there’s not a chance in hell I put that kid,” he stops, thinking about the little lump that was curled in his bed. “That I put Peter through something so dangerous.”
Tony swallows past the lump in his throat. “It’s not really a choice, is it?” Tony says. “It’s not about what you want or what I want. It’s about what Peter would want. We can’t steal his entire life from him. Not when there’s a chance to get it back.”
Through some creative skulking, he managed to avoid not just Steve but Sam and Natasha for most of the morning. His luck didn’t last past lunch though, when Sam cornered him in an alcove off the main room.
“A day or two. We need to run a few simulations, see if we can sharpen the odds.” Hope says. “The sooner we can get him back, the better.”
“It just looks like you’re in the middle of something.”
“It’s like our time traveling experiments,” Bruce says. “Peter had time go through him, not the other way around.”
Steve arched up into his touch, shoulders pushing against the door, and his hips made small, frantic little thrusts into Tony’s hand. He still had him cupped through cotton but it didn’t matter, Tony could feel how hard he was, how much precome he was leaking.
“Just an hour or so,” Tony promises and feels, in his core, that his father must have made the same promise to his mother, over and over again.
“Why would I be mad at him?”
“Peter’s in the training room, finishing up a session with Sam,” FRIDAY tells him.
“You guys are all awfully eager to send this kid into god knows where and never get him back.”
He forgets sometimes, the losses that they’ve all gone through. “It helped him, to hear you talk about it. The dreams, I mean. Made him less scared.”
“But I didn’t.” Tony pulled Steve’s arms tighter around him. “I’m still here.”
“He could probably use some pants,” is all he says.
“I’m not trying to hurt him. I’m trying to keep him from getting hurt. That’s exactly what I’m trying to do.” Tony looked down at his shoes, his heart aching at the memory of that brief, crestfallen look on Steve’s face.
“Come on,” she said, reaching out her hand.
“I don’t want to say this, but if you found him next to Scott’s van, I think we have to consider the tunnel.” Hope says.
“In a second,” he says, distracted by the way, even in the dim light, he can see the fluid pearl just a little across the tip. He swipes at it again before freeing Steve totally from his boxers, his erection laying hard and long across his belly.
They eat breakfast, though Tony can’t choke anything down. He’s just tugging a sweater over Peter’s head when Steve knocks on the door.
He gives himself a few minuets of panic, of anger and a little bit of fear, before he gets up from the table and grabs Peter, who is in mid run, hoisting him up into the air and shaking him silly before dropping him again.
“Can I have juice,” Peter asks, already drowsy. He nuzzles into Tony’s neck, like he’d be happy just settling here for the night.
The questions are as brutal and invasive as Tony expected, and Bruce has to grab his elbow more than once to stop him from jumping across the room.
He turned to the kid. “Peter, I’ll give you a million dollars to switch numbers with me.” Tony looked hopefully at the kid, who he had invited at the last minute. Peter just shook his head, grinning.
There’s a moment before they step off the elevator that Steve thinks about saying something banal, something like
“How did this happen?” Steve paces the length of the large living area Tony’s commandeered as his own private space.
He kept up a soft running commentary on the finer plot points of the film while Steve’s breathing grew slower and deeper. When he switched it off 20 minutes later, Steve was fast asleep with Tony’s fingers tangled in his hair.
“I do this only for you, you know that, right?” Tony tells him as he dries his hands. It gets a smile out Steve.  “I know,” Steve says. He used to just leave them until Steve had made a stink about Tony being too reliant on the staff.
Peter shakes his head, tears spilling out of his eyes. He doesn’t resist when Tony hugs him, pulling him in close.
It wasn’t the Army that changed him, though for a long time he thought it was.
“I’m not sleepy,” Peter protests but he drops his head on Tony’s shoulder, his thumb reaching for the edge of Tony’s collar, like a security blanket.
“Probably,” Natasha said. “You just saw what you wanted to see. I think he caught on pretty quick. You’ve been dancing around him for too long Tony. We thought sharing a room might make you face things.”
“We’re adults, Peter. We don’t “like” each other. We work together. We’re colleagues.”
“Missed you in the hospital,” Tony says quietly.  “Thought maybe you’d want to see if I made it out alive.”
“It’s alright,” Tony says. His face heats up at the thought of Steve, in his bed, hand wrapped up around himself, trying to come in sheets that smell like Tony.
“He didn’t want to sleep in the bed without you.”
Tony had long ago been rendered immune to the charms of fancy dinners but it was nice to see it again through Peter’s eyes. It was part of the reason he’d brought Peter along. They still couldn’t tell anyone he was Spider-Man but he would eventually have a hand in running the Avengers. It was important to Tony he learn both sides of the superhero business.
“I thought I had pieces of it but I only remember trees and dirt,” he shakes his head helplessly, starting to get worked up.
Steve shrugged his shoulders.  “Your list of conquests is a mile long, Tony. Why would I be any different? It’s just sex, right?”
No, Steve shook his head. It never had.
“Cap told you on the radio not to go out there alone! That we didn’t know what kind of weaponry they had. You went out there and got shot up. You almost died.”
Still, they plan. They strategize. They try to minimize risk. They arm themselves to the teeth. They have backup. Their backup has backup. There’s a plan A, a plan B, C and D.
“There’s only one way out of this Tony,” Bruce says quietly.
He put the remote down with an annoyed huff but it was mostly for show. There was no privacy in a bed this small. Even though they both stuck close to their sides, he could already feel the heat of Steve’s body drifting across the bed, the smell of his soap and toothpaste in the air.
“Thanks for playing with me,” he says, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck. Steve’s drawing features lopsided monkey bars, and a larger figure standing next to a smaller one. Steve doesn’t say anything, can’t say anything around the lump in his throat. He hugs Peter tightly and doesn’t bother hiding the tears in his eyes.
“Not for me, actually,” Tony said, sipping his drink.  “It’s for the good of the team. And for the good of you. You gotta loosen up Rogers. Enjoy this life at least somewhat.”
“My mom probably kept it,” Tony says, taking it. “Dad wasn’t that sentimental.”
They ate mostly in silence, alternately watching the fire or swiping through their phones, but it was easier than before. For the first time all day, Tony felt himself relax.
Sam picks him up after they eat. “Alright little man, we got some important equipment inventory to get done. You’re gonna help me count. You ready to be my second in command?” Sam sticks out his hand for a low-five and Peter slaps it enthusiastically. Things seem to be going smoothly until around 3pm, when Sam hauls a screaming Peter back into Tony’s lab. He practically leaps out of Sam’s arms but even as Tony picks him up, he tries to wriggle free. On instinct, Tony squeezes him tighter.
“Oh, god,” Tony gasped at the feel of him, hot and hard in his hand, but skin still so silky soft. Steve moaned again and began to pump their hands in short tight strokes. There was too much fabric in the way to do much else, but it was more than enough. “Jesus Christ,” he whispered softly as Steve’s body went rigid next to him and his already closed eyes squeezed shut even tighter. With a little hitch in his breath, Steve moaned Tony’s name and dug his foot into the mattress, coming in hot, wet spurts over both their hands. Tony sucked even harder at the curve of Steve’s neck and closed his own eyes, taking his come covered hand and stroking his own dick, pumping along his throbbing cock till he came moments later in loud, messy streaks along Steve’s rucked up shirt.
“I know,” Tony says. He kisses the corner of Steve’s mouth, bites along his jawline before touching their foreheads together. “You’ve got a lousy poker face, Steve.”
The whirring comes to an end, and Peter, taller and older, stands before them.
“Yeah, we should,” Steve says. Even from across the table he can see the color rise in Steve’s face. “I mean, if you wanted.”
Steve digs his fingers into Tony’s side briefly, before pulling away. Tony cups the side of Steve’s face and swipes a thumb under his eye. “I don’t get off on seeing you in pain, Rogers. That’s not it.” He cards his fingers lightly through Steve’s hair, till his shoulders sag. “Let me,” he says again, and moves the pillow off of Steve’s lap.
Tony pushes back his chair, mind made up. “It’s not an option.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to come if it’s too familiar,” Tony says softly, his breath grazing the shell of Steve’s ear. “You just need a change of pace is all.”
The first time it happens, it’s a mess of torn clothing and brutal kisses. One minute they’re in the communal kitchen, weary but victorious after an Avenger mission, and the next, Steve is pushing him across the floor and onto the couch, kissing him breathless.  Or, he thinks that’s how it happened. Maybe he made the first move, he’s still not exactly sure.  They didn’t fuck exactly, not right there in the den where anyone could’ve walked in, but Tony had torn the button off of Steve’s jeans and wedged a hand down his pants, stroking him roughly until he bit Tony’s coller bone and came with a muffled groan.  In return, Steve worked him expertly with a deft turn of his wrist until he came all across Steve’s navy blue sweater.
“Yeah buddy, you won.”
But that was the image, not the man. No one could be that upstanding all the time and Steve was human, with feelings and flaws and desires, something Tony liked to remind him of from time to time.
“What’s the last thing you remember before Colonel Rhodes and Sam Wilson found you?”
It’s clearly something. From the doorway, Tony watches the heavy up and down of Steve’s chest as he tries to control his breathing. He’s huffing like he just finished a workout, or a fight.
“Still, my track record for the past two weeks hasn’t been great, has it? I wasn’t there today and I wasn’t there in Manila.”
“Tony, what are you doing?”
Tony’s temper flared and he almost turned on his heel and walked away, but Sam grabbed him by the shoulder.
Before they part for the day, Tony slides an arm around his waist and pulls him in closer. “Hey.” He waits till Steve meets his eyes. “Kiss me for real before I go.” So Steve does, licking inside Tony’s mouth in soft little waves, fingers wrinkling the sleeve of his perfectly pressed suit.
In the dark, Tony can feel and smell more than he can see the mess Steve makes, and he strokes him through it slowly, teasing, using just his finger tips, until Steve comes down fully.
“That’s the real question, isn’t it?” Steve asks. “There’s got to be some way to reverse this.”
Steve nodded slightly dumbstruck.
“It’s a fucking miracle he’s still alive and functioning,” Bruce snaps. “They were either too incompetent or too lazy to regulate the doses. He was either knocked out the entire time or awake but unable to remember anything. Neither of these scenarios is good.”
“Peter,” Hope squats next to him “If it becomes a really long time and you don’t see us, I want you to hit this red button on your hand OK? It might help us find you.”
A few hours later, Steve is out of the hospital and wanders into the common room, where they’ve all been gathered. There’s some stiffness in his gait and Natasha takes care not to crush him in her embrace, but he looks mostly fine. Steve’s color is good, his face free of cuts and bruises.
“What I want has nothing to do with anything.” There was real annoyance in his voice this time.
The boy squinches up his face, searching his memory. “You’re Mr. Stark!”
“You can leave, Tony. I’m alright.”
“Right, of course,” Tony tries to smile through it, but he knows Steve can see the disappointment in his face.
“It could fly,” Peter says. His little hand finds the edge of Tony’s shirt collar again, rubbing it idly. “It had big machine wings that were always moving and big, green eyes.”
“What happened?” May’s rushing into the room, but Steve holds her back.
“This is ridiculous,” Steve muttered.
“I’m not scared for me,” he said. He pushed the pad of his thumb inside Steve’s mouth, let Steve suck on it lightly while he talked. “I don’t want to hurt you, Steve. I don’t want to drive you away.”  He kissed Steve again, holding his face in place with both hands, till Steve started to grind against him. “Good,” Tony whispered, feeling the hard length of Steve’s erection.
“Come on, how are you really feeling?”
There’s real bite in his voice, which makes Tony push aside his work. He runs more than walks down to the large steel and glass enclosed building where all the truly crazy Avengers shit happens. He’s hurrying down the long atrium when Steve comes around a corner, also at a clip.
“Is there a chance it just wears off?” Steve asks.
“Don’t do that,” she says. “You can’t put this all on me. I can’t make this choice. Not when it comes to Peter.”
“Will it bother you if I turn on the TV?” Tony asked instead, his hand already reaching for the remote.
Tony snorts. “Well, the kid’s smart, I’ll give him that much.”
“You think this is a sacrifice I’m making?”
“When would it happen?” she asks.
He and Steve had arrived at the official UN kick-off breakfast together, only to be pulled apart by diplomats in nicely press suits the minute they’d walked through the door. He’s been standing around talking shop and promising favors for 30 minutes before finding a way to excuse himself.
Peter looks up, intrigued. “You do?”
“Hey.” Steve scrubs a hand through his hair, the other holding a pillow across his lap.
Bruce scratches at his three-day beard, reluctant to even get into it. “The quantum tunnel might be why Peter de-aged. What’s happening here...it’s like...Peter got pushed backward through time.”
“Ok, that’s enough,” Tony says, and because he’s sure Steve won’t remember, cards his fingers through Steve’s hair. “You’re going to be ok,” he whispers, watching as Steve’s eyes slip shut.
“Not a chance. You’re already mostly sugar.”
He holds Tony’s gaze for a second, his guard still up. “I’m alright,” he says so Tony sighs and let’s it go.
Tony sat back down and began to remove his tie and waistcoat, watching as Kara turned Steve’s head towards her, giving him a slow, wet kiss.
The corner of her mouth quirked up in a way that Tony didn’t like, and she smiled at him over her coffee cup. “But it doesn’t mean you don’t want to right? The way you’re going red right now pretty much answers that question.”
“Because you fucking ditched him in another country, Tony!” Natasha slammed down the knife she’d picked up.  “He’s a kid. He doesn’t understand that you did something monumentally stupid, and, rather than face up to it, you cut and run.”
“Hi.” Tony reaches down, picks Peter up into his arms. Peter snuffles at the movement, but doesn’t wake.
Steve shakes his head, knows that even though they’ve never talked about it, they’re moving closer to something more serious, more permanent. “Just… thank you,” Steve says. “For taking care of it.” For taking care of me, he means.
“It was my plan,” Steve says. “It was supposed to be a normal hostage rescue. We didn’t know we’d need air support or heavy weaponry.”
“Come for me,” Tony says again and Steve shuts his eyes tight and arches up off the bed, body jerking violently before he comes with a long, strangled cry.
“We don’t really know,” Sam says. “He must have fought his way out from wherever he was being held. He was on the run, barefoot. We found him in his underwear, freezing in the dirt. There were puncture marks all over him.” Sam shakes his head at the memory. “Cuts along his thigh and chest. His wrists were rubbed raw. Like he’d been tied up.”
She was good, Tony could already tell. He’d been to plenty of these places and learned to read the women as much as they’d learned to read him. She was delicate, biding her time, but unafraid. She wouldn’t push too hard, but just hard enough.
“Give him some time,” Steve says, depositing him gently onto his own bed.
He portions the food out into the three bowls. They stand shoulder to shoulder against the counter while Peter sits in one of the high backed chairs along the island. The fork doesn’t quiet fit into his hand, but Peter does his best, cramming noodles into his face. For a few minutes, no one is fighting, no one is screaming, and it actually feels pretty nice.
“I can’t,” he gasps, sweat dripping down his face. “God, Tony I want to, believe me, I want to, but I can’t.”
Before he could respond, Steve popped his head in the door.
“Ok,” Tony says, soothing. “Ok.” He tugs at Steve’s leg, till he’s up on one knee and slides his hand between Steve’s body and the bed. He doesn’t wait to be told what to do, or ask. He just cups Steve over his briefs, which are soaked in precome.
“Maybe it was a mistake, tricking you guys into a sharing a room. I’m starting to regret it now,” she said.
Steve stayed bent over the logs, poking at the flame. “You thought the ambassador was flirting with me. Why did it bother you so much?”
“Oh, you are.” Steve walked off first,  but held his hand against the door while the others stepped off.  “I don’t like it any more than you do. But I also know when to just suck it up.”
“I ate three bites! Can I have some juice!”
Steve grunts when he does it a third time, his back going tense, fingers digging into the pillow.
“He’s seen enough people die, Tony. He can’t lose you too.”
“Do you get scared?” Peter’s voice is small.
“Don’t talk.” Steve drops down next to him, his face streaked with sweat and dirt from running through the trees. He presses a hand to his ear piece, even though Tony has told him a million times that doesn’t help, and barks out their location. “Evac incoming, Tony. You're gonna be fine.”
“It means you’re right. We do things as a team. Come on, we’re gonna eat lunch and then your Aunt May is coming over.”
“That’s it, Steve, that’s it, baby. Come on, come for me again.” They’re doing the dirtiest things imaginable and yet Tony’s voice is so soft, so kind that Steve’s throat closes up tight. He squeezes his eyes shut and comes without a sound, his entire body jerking up off the bed.
“You guys are sharing the same bed,” Peter laughed.
“Yeah.”
“No,” Steve said, nose buried in Tony’s hair. “Some things just cost too much.”
“Good.”
“We don’t know that,” Tony snaps. “Whatever this is...it could wear off. Until we know more about what happened, we can’t risk it.”
“Wait,” he said. “Stay. Please. I want you to stay.” Surprised, Tony exchanged a glance with Kara who nodded her consent.
Tony sighs and stretches out, enjoying the elation of having escaped death and an interminable hospital stay to finally end up back in his own room.
Steve nods, his eyes softening just a little. “Yeah.”
Natasha peered over his shoulder, began to pull out some pita bread, veggies and hummus.  “Happy’s driving him back to Queens. He’s worried you’re mad at him.”
“It’s four nights,” Steve said as the elevator dinged to a stop. “You know, I’m starting to take this personally.”
“OK,” Tony agrees, blinking back his own tears.
Steve slept there nightly until Tony was back at full strength. Sometimes they would fuck, losing themselves in pleasure until the sheets were damp and in disarray but mostly they slept, Steve drifting off with a book while Tony worked on a tablet. The day he was officially cleared for Avenger duty, Steve disappeared back to his own quarters, and stayed there until Tony, furious enough to spit fire, dragged him back to his room.
He stared at her for a second, mouth gape at their little deception. “Did Steve know?”
He whites out for a second, his own pleasure mixing with Tony’s as he thrusts a few more times before coming with his own sharp cry.  In his haze he finds Tony’s mouth and kisses him again, fingers curling through damp hair.  Their are words that want to claw their way out of his throat, but he finds himself so lost, so unmoored, he has no idea where to start. But this time, when Tony looks deep into his eyes Steve doesn’t turn away.
He keeps one hand around Steve’s still clothed dick, fondling under the fabric until Steve starts shifting his hips uncomfortably. He doesn’t want to keep Steve in pain but there’s an art of this kind of thing, and a little patience goes a long way.
“Tony.” The bed shifted as Steve turned to face him. He laid a hand on Tony’s chest and bent down to kiss him. The press of his mouth was as soft and sweet as Tony had imagined.  Despite not wanting to, he moaned into the touch, parting his lips a little as Steve pushed tentatively with his tongue. His hands, sticky with come, curled in Steve’s hair. It was good, far too good. With aching regret, he wrenched his mouth away and gently pushed Steve aside.
“We did simulations,” he says. “I wore pads here, here, here and here,” Peter points to each knee, each elbow, before pointing to his head. “And a helmet. It was cool!” For the next 10 minutes he talks non stop about watching Natasha weave and dodge and bust her way through digital bad guys.
Tony slumps into the couch after May leaves as Peter pulls every book off the shelf and stacks it in the middle of the room. Occasionally, he’ll bring a book to Tony and hand it to him like a present. He smiles wide, like it’s the greatest gift anyone’s every given anyone else.
“I panicked,” Tony said as they pulled apart. His fingers rucked up Steve’s shirt and trailed along the bare skin of his abdomen.  “All this.” He stopped and kissed down Steve’s throat, pausing to lick at the hollow of his neck.  “All this,” he said again, voice still muffled along his shoulder, “Can be a little scary.”
It takes another three days before Peter’s back in the compound again. Three days of Tony’s calls going to voice mail and FRIDAY reminding him it’s illegal to stalk a minor. It would make him angry, if it wasn’t breaking his heart.
He gets better by degrees, spending more time asleep then awake over the course of a week. Steve’s presence is constant, if not always front and center. Most of the time, there’s someone else in the room when he wakes up--either Happy or Pepper or Rhody or Natasha--but it’s never Peter.  He tries to ignore it, let the kid have his space but his spirts sink every time the parade of faces through his room doesn’t include the one attached to a mess of brown curls.
“They’re shipping over 12 tons of Hydra weapons to a new base,” he says. “It’s a two-man mission.”
“You really can’t control it can you?”
“It’s late,” he says.
“I do enjoy it,” Steve mumbled under his breath. It’s just that his enjoyment was more along the lines of an early morning run and listening to jazz records while he made a sensible and nutritious dinner.
“Can you stabilize the tunnel in that time? Even just a little?”
“That’s called teamwork,” Peter says. “We’re the Avengers! We do things like a team.”
Peter hesitates, but Tony holds out his hand and Peter rushes toward it. “I missed you,” he says into Peter’s hair. Peter only turns his face into Tony’s neck, his fingers digging into Tony’s back.
“Same rules as last night,” Tony says. “Just say stop and I will.”
There’s a flood of questions. What does he remember—”some things but not everything”—what did it feel like—”like being underwater”—does he feel sick, hungry tired—”no, no and yes”.
“Mmmhmm.” Peter nodded his head, like he understood everything. “But, I mean, it’s really because you like him a lot. It’s cute.”
Ahana looks down at the wolf, which is slumbering on top of her and chuckles while soothingly running her fingers through his fur. "Shit!" she exclaims when she realises that it's time for her to go to the site meeting and immediately calls her PA. "Hey, Kat, minor changes, let Pepper go to the site visit" she says "But, she's on maternity leave" "Fuck! Uhh, who is on the team?" "Jackson, team leader, but he's on emergency leave" "Who else?" "Oh! Zeeta, RnD manager" "Then email her the details and ask her to go, I can't, a little busy, sorry and can we conference the shareholder's meeting here, in my office?" "Yeah, just zoom call from your place, but, are you okay?" "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine just a little tired but I'm good. Just conference those calls for me, thanks." she greets before ending her call when the door to her office knocks. The wolf which was previously slumbering on her lap, perks up and starts snarling but Ahana shushes him with a hand on his head "Relax, baby boy, just Bruce" she says "Come in, Bruce" she calls out and Bruce comes in, his doctor bag and stethoscope in hand. "Hey, sorry to call you early" Ahana apologizes but Bruce waves her off "Nah, it's okay. So, where's our wolf?" he asks and Ahana gestures at her lap and Bruce slowly pads forward until he kneels beside Ahana "Wow....he's beautiful, I mean blood aside, he's beautiful" Bruce says as he gently lowers his palm towards the wolf's muzzle and the wolf gently sniffs his hand and whines before laying his head on Ahana's lap.
Ahana sits on her bed and let's her tears flow freely, her chest heaving with each inhale and exhale and her wolf nuzzling her arms, whining softly. The bedroom door opens and closes and Bucky pads towards her, sitting beside her silently. "Shouldn't you be with him?" she asks and Bucky just hums "I'm serious, I just used you for my fight and insulted you at the same time, you should hate me" "I don't hate you, never will, never am, never could" "I just-" "I would have said the same thing if I was in your place and you were in mine. And Steve's an idiot, he confesses his undying love and then screams at you, so dumb" Bucky says and Ahana chuckles before the door opening and closing one more time, this time her wolf snarling. "Baby boy, shh, it's okay, I'm fine" she soothes, running her fingers through his fur, the wolf relaxes only slightly. Steve pads slowly to Ahana's other side and gently takes her hand "So...I was an idiot" he says and Ahana doubles over laughing " Yeah, yeah you are but we're both dumb when it comes to that self-sacrafying idiot" he teases and the three of them laugh, her wolf safely nestled in between her feet.
Ahh, chapter 2, also, this Tony has been with HYDRA for 10 yrs, as a wolf, so he doesn't know how to function as a human yet, so his vocab is limited, that doesn't mean he is dumb! He is smart, it's just that his attitude and communication is a little weird.
Steve then carries Tony, armor and all, and walks his way to the med bay, already seeing Bucky and Natasha there. Bucky immediately turns around when he hears the whoosh of the sliding door and takes a sharp inhale, hearing Tasha do the same thing.  "Is..is that Tony?" he whispers as Tasha quietly moves towards the other hospital bed. Tony whimpers as his back hits the bed and Steve shushes him, carding his fingers through his brown locks. One of the medical staff comes in and injects sedatives into his body, and Tony goes into a deep slumber. Steve sighs as he drags a plastic chair and sits beside him, Rhodey doing the same thing on the opposite side. "How is she?" Steve asks Bucky and Bucky smiles small "She's okay, there's scorching marks on her back from the blast but other than that she's okay" he replies and the rest of them go quiet.
That's how Steve found all the Avengers at different places in the communal floor. The whole mood in the hall was scary and sad. Tony was nowhere to be seen and Steve missed him like a limb. It was wrong for him to charge without listening, heck, giving Tony a chance to placate Tasha but he had so much of adrenaline from the fear Tony is going to get hurt, he kinda fought her of pure rage. Bucky, however, was at the loveseat staring at the view of New York plunging into darkness. Steve took a deep breath and sat beside Bucky. "You okay?" Steve asked "She was right...it's my fault she got stuck with Hydra" Bucky answered him still looking at the view. Steve eyes went wide "Buck, what do you mean?" Steve asked "Because he knew her before. During Hydra" Natasha answered. Bucky remained silent. "How did you know her Buck?" Steve asked him and Bucky took a deep breath looked at Natasha and told Steve "It was a week or two after they brainwashed me when they brought her. She was a kid at that moment and she was bleeding profusely. The doctors at the facility tried to get rid of the glass pieces out from her chest but it didn't work cause there was still a few tiny ones inside her so they had to cut open her chest and add a barrier to avoid the glass pieces to pierce into her heart. They inserted a metal chestpiece that is thick enough to prevent that and stitched back her chest and for months they did the same process they did to me to her....but...but...she was just a kid....and until now her screams still haunt me....they'd beat her up if she slipped her words and starved her to death if she did a mission wrongly. Yeah, she started going for missions the moment they brainwashed her. Then we were introduced to each other for a mission and that's when we got close. She'd tell bits and pieces of her memory and I use to tell mine...she grew up I never did and the friendship we had....kinda bloomed into love...we didn't kiss or had sex but it was a mutual feeling both of us had. And then it happened, you guys came to rescue me and she grabbed my hands and pleaded to not leave her alone and I promised her that I won't and left her....in the cell...and ran after you. And I tried and tried to tell you that there is another person inside but you all refused to listen to me before....you knocked me out...and I left her alone" Bucky finished. Natasha took a sharp breath and exited the compound without telling and Steve covered his head in his hands and cried.
Ahana sweeps her gaze along her long lost brother's body and turns to her husband "How is he?" she whispers "he's doing okay, no injury, just...." "What?" "He''s different...he doesn't talk like a human-" "Behaves like a wolf" she finishes understandingly and her husband nods.  Ahana sighs and lays back down on her bed "I don't care if he behaves like a wolf or still talks like one, but he's back, that's all that matters. His health is fine, the rest can cure gradually" she whispers as her eyelids slowly close, the painkillers in her system slowing her down and within minutes, she's dead to the world.

Hi y'all!
Dobrokachestvennyy - Benign
Opening the door, the whole class was in chaos. There were paper balls flying everywhere, a few children screaming their lungs out for their parents and some were running around the class chasing each other. Tony immediately hid behind Scar's back and her hold on his wrist tightened as she moved forward towards the only empty seats, sandwiched between another small brunette boy with glasses reading a book and a strawberry blond girl. The girl looked up and saw them and gave them a welcoming smile, gesturing them to take the seats with her eyes. Scar smiled back and went forward to the seats. Tony took the seat beside the small brunette boy and Scar sat beside the strawberry blond girl, who immediately turned towards them "Hi! I'm Pepper Potts! What's your name?" the girl asked enthusiastically "I'm Scarlett Maximoff and that's Tony Stark" Pepper beamed at Tony which beamed at her back. The small brunette then turned towards them, pushing his glasses up and giving them a small smile "Hey, guys..I'm Bruce Banner" Banner greeted softly "Tony Stark" Tony pointed at himself and pointed at Scar "Scarlett Maximoff" and then shook his hand. The quad then continued chatting among themselves when the sound of heels tapping against the tiled floor stopped at the entrance of their class.
” And the TV shut off.
Tony stomped back and took the car back to the compound.
It takes almost three weeks for Ahana to recover and she's putting on her shirt when Natasha comes in, a gentle smile on her face "Hey, how are you?" she whispers and Ahana nods "I'm better...not fully recovered but I'm better" she says and Natasha hums, sitting beside her on the bed. Both the ladies look at the other bed, Tony sleeping peacefully in it "What's the doc saying?" Ahana asks "He needs more time here, his body is still weak and they found slight injuries, so they want to keep him under observations" she says and Ahana nods. "I know I do not look like a sister who just lost her brother, being all cool and stuff, but I can see how panicked all of you were, yesterday" she says "The strain in Steve's eyes and Rhodey's voice confirmed it and me adding it? Nah, I'd rather help to cure my brother than be worried and useless" she continues and hops off her bed and walks towards her brother's. She gently takes her brother's hand and places a light kiss on it and pecks his forehead, running her fingers through his hair. "You know, its okay to worry and grieve, that does not make you useless,
Tony was reading one of mission report when the familiar weird feeling crept up him. He looked up from the paper and scanned around until his eyes narrowed down on a woman figure in all black staring at the diner. Everything clicked to its place and his eyes widened just the exact moment a bomb came crashing through the diner window "EVERYONE GET DOWN-"
his mind supplied. Through all the suave and style, Steve was certain that was the shy seven year old brunette he saw on the first day of elementary school.
Junior prom came and Steve went with Peggy and Bucky went with Scar. Steve smiled softly as he saw Bucky and Scar slow dancing to a song while also whispering to each other, clearly happy in each others arms. Steve's eyes continued to roam around the ballroom to find where Tony was but in vain, he was nowhere to be found. Once the dance finished, Steve pecked Peggy on her lips before excusing himself to go talk to Bucky. He found his best friend at a nearby lake, idly throwing stones across the lake. "Hey" Steve started and Bucky turned and looked at him with a tired smile "Hey, punk. Why aren't you inside?" Steve shrugged and sat beside him "Wanted to talk to you" he replied and Bucky huffed. Silence blanketed them before Steve broke it "How are you guys?" Bucky huffed again, but now a bitter tone to it "You really wanna know?" Steve nodded "Not good actually, it's like someone cursed us after you left us and bad luck just follows us" Steve winced but looked at him in a funny expression "What do you mean?" Bucky looked at him "After you left, both Scar's and Tony's parent died, then Tony moved out to California to attend a boarding school, and...Scar..she's diagnosed with fourth stage lung cancer.." Bucky trailed off as Steve gasped "Scar..has cancer? H..how long?" "A year maximum" Steve shuddered and turned to look at the lake "Tony is at a boarding school? When did he move?" "After the parents' death and Scar's diagnosis" "You and Scar..." "Were together for 6 months before this thing happened". Silence found it's way again around them and both of them looked at the lake. Finally, Bucky sighed and got up, turning back to look at Steve "At least, you're enjoying your life" huffed a bitter laughter and went inside the building. Steve looked at the path Bucky went and closed his eyes, tears forming at the tips of his eyelids, thinking
Phew! That took time but i enjoyed writing it!
for the picture of Yelena Belova
Ahana chuckles "I'll take that as a yes, then" and scratches the wolf's ears and it rumbles like a train. "You're like a big puppy, baby boy" she teases and switches her phone on and scrolls through her contacts until she reaches
"You okay? You spaced-out" Bucky says when Ahana hums absentmindedly "Yeah...just saw this scar, and it..." she sighs and scratches her head "Call me crazy...but I know that scar" "Which one?" and Ahana points out the scar on the wolf's right eye "I know that scar because I've seen it" "Where?" "Tony. He had that scar when Howard threw a beer bottle at his head and it missed by an inch but the glass still cut his right eyebrow. I know that cause I was the one that treated the damn thing!" she says, her eyes widening. "I know it's crazy, hell it even might be but...what if?" "What if what?" Steve snaps and Ahana flinches, looking at him with a raised eyebrow. "What's with that tone?" "Ahana, be real, it's ten years already, it's remotely impossible if he's alive! He's dead!" "And how do you know? Maybe he isn't!" "We were there on the site! You were not!" "Steven" Bucky warns him but Steve ignores him. "We were there on site while you was in the building calling the whole operation to a halt! You stopped it! You made it sure that he couldn't be found!" :Don't you dare! I called it off because I knew it was taking a toll on ALL OF YOU! And call it selfish but I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE MY HUSBAND WHEN I LOST MY BROTHER!" Ahana screams, her breath coming in short pants.
"Even though you can never get rid of the ups and downs completely, you’ve been my cushion to help smooth out the hard times..."
Tony whimpers and pads over to his human and nudges her face and arms but his human is not moving, he whines but there is no movement then he starts licking and huffing on top of his human but no luck, his human is still unconscious. Tony mulls over his option and comes with an idea, if he wants to get help for his human, then he has to shift. So, he shifts, and it's hell! It's been almost 10 years since his first shift and he winces as he hears his bones cracking and twisting, elongating to a normal human bone. His muscle is stretched and his whole world gets turned upside down as he curls onto himself and focuses on shifting himself. The next he knows, his on the floor kneeling, his two human legs folded under him and his arms on his head, covering his ears. Tony then stretches and stands on both feet, a little dizzy at first but slowly getting the hang of it, walking towards his human. He shakes her "Hey, hey, you okay? Uhh, human you okay?" he asks but his human is still not opening her eyes but then he taps the metal helmet and the voice from inside speaks.
Comments and kudos are much appreciated!

Tony hadn't expected to see Rogers after moving to a boarding school. It was the mid term break and Tony wanted to visit Scar's grave before leaving to Malibu with Pepper. It was almost 4 years since his best friend died of cancer and he was left alone. With nothing to stay and no one to stay, he enrolled himself to a boarding school and then went to MIT. That's where he got new friends and a very new environment. During his third year was when the news hit him like a brick wall. It was early in the morning when his phone buzzed and he picked it up, the hospital in the other line. He immediately shoot up from his bed, clutching his t-shirt as the doctor finally called it. Tears streamed down his cheeks and his broken sobs were heard by his roommate, Rhodey. Rhodey immediately rushed to the hospital and they arrived just in time to see the doctor closing Scar's dead body with the blanket. He crumbled on the ground as Rhodey held him and both of them spent the rest of the day finishing up the documentation of her death. Now, he was actually going back to Malibu from Massachusetts and wanted to stop by New York to visit her. That was when he found this coffee shop, and since he wanted a cup of coffee since morning and also a quiet place to finish his upcoming Mechanical Engineering project, he entered the cafe. Rogers was the last person he wanted to see that day.
“How is everything here, J?” Tony asked JARVIS while cleaning up his table. “
"Stark!" a Russian voice barks from behind and Ahana boosts up her thrusters and speeds up to the vault, her wolf safely cradled in her arms. "Give me back my dog!" "Fuck you! This is my brother!" she counters and prays hard to get to the vault. The vault is near her when a bomb goes ricocheting off the wall and blasts near her face. Ahana instinctively curls around the wolf and her back takes the hit, sending her careening into the vault by the blast force. "J! Lock the vault!" Ahana screeches and JARVIS immediately bolts up the vault, the bullet proof shielding activated. Ahana breathes a sigh of relieve and slumps to the floor, bullet shots and the Hulk's roar a distant noise. Ahana checks her reflection on the vault's opposite wall and winces when she sees blood trickling out of her head and her back aches like fuck. She slides her eyes to her wolf and sees it panting in the corner, scooting forward and placing a gentle hand on it's fur.
Dazhe posle togo, kak ya voshel v tvoyu mechtu, ty vse yeshche ne? - Even after I entered your dream, you still don't know?
play. I don't want my father to think that I was lying, anyways, what about yours?" she asked quietly and Tony shrugged "Done that when Tanner was yappin' about the homework just a few minutes ago" Scar shook her head and rolled her eyes fondly as she focused on the current subject.
That night, Tony and Bucky were at the balcony at the top floor which faced the garden which was build behind the compound. Both their feet dangling in the air, swaying them back and forth. No words were passed between them but the presence of each other comforted the other. Tony took a deep breath and turned to Bucky "You..you're good to her" Bucky huffed a bitter laughter "If you mean good, by leaving her to the monsters.." he shrugged. Tony reached out and placed his hand on top of Bucky's and squeezed it "That makes us two. We both hurt her unintentionally, and.." he shrugged his shoulder. Bucky turned towards Tony and gave him a small smile. Tony returned the smile and turned back to look at the garden. Suddenly, Bucky snorted and Tony turned to him with an amused smile and a raised eyebrow "What?" Bucky turned to him "Thinking that it was trouble enough taking care of Stevie when he was a shrimp, now I have to see him as my brother-in-law" Bucky shuddered at the words and Tony bursted out laughing until he had tears in his eyes. Infected by the laughter, Bucky joined him only to stop at a throat clearing "So, this what happens when my husband and my best friend get together? They make fun of me" Steve said with a mock pout. Tony rolled his eyes fondly but beckoned him towards them. Steve joined them by sitting in between Tony and Bucky. The trio was silent but it was comforting. Tony soon enough laid his head on top of Steve's shoulder and was fast asleep. Steve fondly smiled at him and then turned to Bucky "I'm gonna bring this tiny to bed, you're not gonna crash?" Bucky shook his head but looked at him fondly "Nah...I'm just gonna hang out here and then go to bed, its..its comforting ya know..Tasha is not physically here but knowing that she's here just a floor down, its..comforting" Steve nodded in understanding. Steve carried Tony looked at Bucky "Night, brother-in-law" Steve teased and Bucky rolled his eyes but laughed nonetheless "Night, punk" and looked back at the garden. Bucky looked up at the stars and wished upon it.
The room was dead silence except for the data running at the background projected in hologram. Bucky looked up at Tony "I'm sorry, Tony...it was all I could do, and it was not enough, it was never enough..." Tony faced the windows overlooking the forest without a word. Steve came behind him and wrapped him up in his arms. Tony closed his eyes and leaned back into the safe warmth. "Guess, we both betrayed her trust huh?" Tony said but there was no heat behind it but sorrow, pure sorrow. "She lost her love from Howard and Maria, her own dad killed her, her twin brother stood there watching her die and the guy she loved left her behind...is it weird that I'm thinking that she could have stayed dead? Like just dead. Burried with a tombstone that validated it. I mean, she could have bypassed this kind of pains." Tony huffed bitterly. Steve tightened his grip and kissed his head "For what's worth, I know you can fix her, like with Bucky-" "But what if I don't want to fix her?" "What?" "What if I don't want to fix her, what if I don't want to see her? Does that make a difference?" "Tony, what's wrong? I thought that was the reason you are staying here?" "She tried to kill me Steve..." Steve jerked back and spun Tony until he was facing Steve. "Tony, what do you mean?" "The bomb blast at Stark Towers was not terrorist, it was personal, she wanted to get rid of me." "Bucky did the same too, Tony. You have to remember that its not her, that is not her. Bring her back, we'll fix her together-" "Then what? Crisis averted? Steve, even if I fixed her brain, memories of her...of her past life will haunt her to death. I'd rather let her be dead then seeing her walking around like a ghost with nightmare." "So, you're telling me that its not worth it? Saving her is not worth it?" "Its not that Steve. Its the after that I'm worried about-" "We'll help. Sam is a great therapist and Bucky knows her more than any of us. We can use the B.A.R.F technology and we'll be right there to help her with her nightmares and PTSDs" Tony looked at Steve and then at Sam, who smiled encouragingly and then at Bucky, who nodded "Really?" Steve smiled and kissed him "Yes, sweetheart. When we said that Tasha is part of the family, we meant it." Tony was so overwhelmed with love that he hugged Steve tight and Sam and Bucky joined the group hug. "Okay, okay, that's enough. Go and get refreshed, let's go for breakfast and we'll start digging." Sam and Bucky nodded and went back to their room closing the door behind them. Tony locked the door and picked up the file and sat on the edge of the bed flipping through it. Steve sat beside Tony and pulled him closer and pecked him at the side of his head "We'll find her Tones, I promise" Tony sighed but looked at Steve and gave him a small smile. Steve than plucked the file out Tony's hand "Hey! I was reading that!" "Rest for now, Tony. And I haven't seen you for the past 3-" " 2 days" "For the past 2 days, and I need you" "My,my...what a dirty mind do you have, Captain" Steve's eyes clouded with lust and Tony smirked. Steve loved when he called him by his title. "On the bed. Now." Steve growls while shedding his clothes off. Tony smirked and lazily walked to the top of the bed and presented himself on the bed like a French model. "Look at you..beautiful.." "You wanna come up here and unwrap this beauty or are you gonna stand there and gap at me" Tony teased while beckoning him with his index finger. Steve prowled towards Tony like a predator scaring its prey. What started as a light brush of lips turned into a full passionate make out session. Steve plunged Tony's mouth with his tongue, tasting his insides and tickling his tongue while his hands roamed around Tony's body. One by one, Tony's clothes came off and both were naked. Tony gasped and moaned as the proximity made their cocks brush against each other. Steve trailed his mouth along Tony's jaw, neck and collarbone and started sucking a bruise their. "Hnng..Steve...I..I..need you..." Tony said between his breathy gasps and moans. Proud of the bruise on Tony's collarbone, Steve started trailing his lips down Tony's body while whispering "I got you, sweetheart..just...relax...". When Steve reached the vee of Tony's hips, he looked up at Tony and his cock stirred at a new pace. Back perfectly arched with his mouth hung open and tanned skin golden from the sun rays, he looked like a goddess. Trailing his fingers on the underside of Tony's cock "Tell me what you want.. sweetheart?" "You...you..hnngg...only you...in..in..me" Steve smile and kissed the head of Tony's cock and went lower. No words were passed between them as Steve worked Tony open with three fingers, Tony withered on the bed, moaned and gasped when Steve manage to find his prostate. Tony's cock was painfully hard and when he reached to hold it, Steve pushed it aside "No touching yourself, let me pleasure you" "Steve...please...m'hard....need...need you..." "Patience...sweetheart....." once Tony was open enough, Steve lubed his cock and gently pushed inside Tony's hole. Steve eyes snapped shut and his upper body hung low as Tony's heat enveloped him. "More..more..Steve..please" Tony was a babbling mess and Steve pushed in. Slow rhythm paced fast and Steve was slamming into Tony hitting his prostate with each thrust. Steve then grabbed Tony's cock and pumped it with the same pace "Steve!...m'close....m'gonna..gonna..Ah!...come" "Come for me sweetheart..let go.." and Tony did. Stripes of come splattered on his stomach and Steve followed soon after and filled Tony up.
Warning - description of torture
Tony was peacefully dozing in between the three humans, when a loud alarm starts blaring and he startles awake, the soft arms around him keeping him from bolting. His human is softly whispering and soothing him as the both blond and brunette human start padding outside of the room. "Call me when you leave?" his human whispers to the brunette and the brunette hums before they both kiss and the brunette runs out. His human sighs "Guess it's just me and you, baby boy" she says and hops on the bed, patting her lap for him. Tony immediately leaps on the bed and curls up on top of her, the food and stress taking a huge toll on him.

Toodles!
was in preschool." Tony explained with glassy eyes "What happened?" Harley asked "She..she died of cancer, when she was around 16 years old". The family reached the graveyard and stood in front of Scar's tombstone "Hey, Scar...it's been almost 4 decades since I lost you and now I have a family, two beautiful sons, adopted the obviously, and a high end condominium. If you were still alive we could have been a real extended family...you..James..your kids" Tony trailed and tears formed against his cheeks. Steve rubbed his back and they placed a garland of rose flowers against the tombstone. "Bye.." Tony whispered and left the graveyard
we'll have our sleepover?" Tony countered back and Scar thought about it for a moment before nodding "Fine, but study first and
The whole dining table was silent before Natasha broke it "She sounds badass to me" and Tony unintentionally barked out laughing and soon enough everyone followed him. "Please, if Tasha was still alive, both of you would have killed me. And with Steve here" Tony pointed at his husband "The mother henning would have been unbearable! Just imagine, I'll never be allowed back in the lab until I was 100% recovered." Tony laughed "Seems okay with me, atleast I'll have some backup when you use your puppy dog eyes at me." Steve said with a mock annoyance. "Hey, did your puppy dog eyes work on Tasha?" Clint asked across the table. "Oh god no, even the saddest puppy dog eyes never broke her, she loved me, yes but sometimes she can be a little....stubborn." Tony shuddered at the memory. "Oh! I just remembered, I think I still have the drawing, gimme a second" and Tony sprinted to his room in the penthouse and rummaged a little box that was at the far corner of his room. After afew minutes, he pulled out the drawing that he has kept since he was 12. Tony held the picture close to himself and walked towards the kitchen again. "Ladies and gentlemen, presenting to you...Natasha Maria Stark!" The drawing was mostly made from pencil and a light touch of charcoal. The muse, however, was gorgeous, even as a kid. Steve ran a finger through the drawing as light as possible. The girl was between 3 to 4 years old with her head tilting slightly to the right. She had her hair in a double dutch braid with the bangs neatly styled in front. Even in black and white, Steve could feel her piercing eyes, the blue eyes and she had the softest smile, not too big and not too small, just perfect enough. She was wearing a lace Victorian style gown but only her upper body was drawn. "She...she is beautiful..." Pepper whispered softly beside Tony. "I bet if she's still alive, so many guys would have fallen in love with her..." Bucky said and the others agreed. "We should hang her in our room..." Tony whipped his head at Steve and looked at him in horror "Babe, I love you and that's a great idea but I love Tasha too much for her eyes to be bleached seeing us making love in our room. Pity her, atleast." Tony said and barked another round of laughter when Steve's cheeks was covered in a rosy blush. Steve lightly smacked Tony behind his head "I meant hang her picture there" pointing at the wall of fame covered in their family pictures "cause now she's family too." Tony hugged him and pecked him in the lips and went to the wall while Steve tried hanging her picture. After several tries, Tasha's picture was hung among the various photos of their family. Tony slumped back against Steve's chest with Steve's arms around him and his family surrounding him, he looked at the picture. "We're one big family" Steve whispered in his ears.
Konechno eto pravda...Ya prishel na kladbishche, potomu chto znal, chto ty priyedesh' navestit' svoyu sestru. - Of course, this is true ... I came to the cemetery because I knew that you would come to visit your sister.
As careful as they can be, Ahana let's Bucky carry the wolf through the back door using the maintenance lift and she picks both of them up, the wolf securely at the back of the car. "How was it?" Ahana suddenly asks and Bucky raises an eyebrow at her "The mass, for him" she clarifies and Bucky sighs and takes her hand in his "Yeah, it was nice, everyone was there and most of his employees and his fans except..." "except me. I know, I know how it looks but...but I can't look at the grave or his picture without thinking that I was also a part of it, I can't go and celebrate when I feel like a murderer" she says, her voice cracking and tears stream on her cheeks. Ahana stops the car at the side and cries, her grip on the steering wheel tight. Bucky hugs her and kisses the side of her head, reassuring her, the couple mourning the lost of a family and a friend. The wolf's whines makes Ahana wipe her tears and look back through the rear mirror "I'm fine baby boy, just...I'm fine" she says before starting the engine and drives off to the Avengers compound.
" "Okay, then...J, scan for nearest motel, rental car service and electronic store. Any later I'm like this, the higher possibility for me to turn into a capsicle. We already have one, don't bother with another." "
new things and teach them what you know! Plus, having a couple of new friends is an extra benefit!" Jarvis told with a cheery voice and Tony's posture wavered before he softly said "I have you and Ana as my friends..." and Jarvis's eyes softened "Yes, Anthony but here you get to have friends of your age! Maybe you guys can have a sleepover, build robots and whatnot together!" Jarvis said and Tony's eyes brightened in interest and he looked sideways.
"Came here to see your wife? We killed her" the voice mocks and Bucky clenches his right hand, his left tightening around his rifle. "I should have known you would have gone soft. Getting married having a wife, huh!" the voice taunts him and Bucky keeps his mouth shut, confirming that the Avengers are close through his comms. "What do you want?" he asks finally and the voice barks out a bitter laughter "Your wife, if possible, but most importantly the dog with her" the voice sneers "Why?" "That dumb dog escaped our facility!" "Experimenting on animals now? That's low even for you" "Do not taunt me! I'll kill your wife!" "Does it really matter when you said that you already killed my wife?' Bucky asks even as his heart crumbles inside him. The voice laughs and turns Bucky to face him and Bucky gapes "Yelena?" "Why? Thought I was someone else?" she sneers and points her gun right at his forehead. "
"What happened?" Steve asked. "
Tony thought to himself but made his way to his room. Entering his room, he immediately locked it, had a nice, long hot shower, set up his private communication server and sat down on the bed to call Steve. "

"Learning that my brother can shape-shift into a wolf is the coolest thing I've ever seen! And I'm not gonna ruin that for him, the cure is for his speech, and how to make him more human when he's an actual human, something like a therapy maybe" Ahana says with a shrug and Natasha hums, when the door opens and Bucky enters. Natasha gets up and kisses Ahana's cheeck "Kayh
Steve then ran towards the counter, flung the dish cloth, took a small book and a pen and shuffled his way to the new customer "Hi! My name is Steve! What would you like today?" he asked with a smile. Tony took a few moments to end his call and then looked up and his eyes widened, mouth agape "Ste-" that was the only word he uttered before his whole demeanor hardened and he straightened his back and flipped through the menu card "Uhh, I'll order a Long Black with two sugars and a" he gulped at a particular word "and a..blueberry pie" Steve nodded and wrote down the order "Anything else?" Steve asked but Tony only shook his head before opening a sleek laptop from his pouch and started working on it. Swallowing his disappointment, he took back the menu and made his way to the counter where Sam and Clint were looking at him "Is that Tony?" Sam asked and Steve nodded. He started making Tony's order, since it was still early hours, the coffee shop was still fairly empty so he finished the order quickly. He sat the tray on the counter and just looked at him. He was hunched over his laptop, furiously typing while muttering something to himself. Steve sighed before bringing the tray to him.
Tony clutched the end of Jarvis's pants, smothering his face into the soft cotton fabric hiding his tears effectively. Jarvis's sighed and held Tony at arms length before crouching down and trying to look at Tony's eyes. "Anthony, please look up.." Jarvis asked softly but Tony immediately shook his head and still bowed his head, looking at the grass, at his shoes, at Jarvis's polished shoes, anywhere but at Jarvis's face. Jarvis sighed again and brought his index finger and thumb and prompted Tony to lift his head, and after a few cajoling, Tony looked up. His eyes were red rimmed, snot was flowing from his nose and Tony hiccuped the remains of his outburst.
” and JARVIS detached the left arm plate and shoots off only to come back and pull Tony out. Once out, the arm reattaches back “
Tony gasped for air, panting, sweating, he could hear voices but it all seemed to far away, he reached out to the voices and suddenly a hand, a large warm hand caught his hands and threaded his fingers with theirs. Tony snapped from his haze and looked up. Brown eyes met with clear azure eyes. "Steve...." and Tony slumped forward just enough for Steve to catch him and Tony cried. Tony cried his eyes out, from the betrayal, from his sister. After a few minutes, his cries reduced to quiet sobs and he finally looked up at Steve "Steve..you're still alive.." "Of course I'm still alive, sweetheart...Are you okay?" Tony shook his head and slumped back onto the bed with his arm covering his eyes "Wanna talk about it?" Tony shook his head and that's when the door to his room opened and Bucky and Sam entered. "Hey..you okay?" Sam asked. Tony sat up against the headboard and accepted the cup of coffee from Bucky with a slight nod. After finishing his coffee, he was very much awake "Wait. What are you guys doing here?" "There was a bombing-" "At Upstate New York. I know. Saw it on the news yesterday night..." Tony looked at Steve "Thought....you..." Steve didn't let him finish his word by kissing him quiet "I'm fine...nothing happened, the bomb went off upstate, not anywhere near the compound." Tony nodded and walked towards the garbage bin to throw the coffee cup. "Anyway, you didn't answer my question. Why are you guys here?" "Bucky said that he has something you might want to look at" Sam replied. Tony turned to look at Bucky and Bucky rummaged his bag and took out a yellow file. It was a generic profile case file, a little dusty. "What's this?" "After the attack at upstate, Bucky went to his room and brought this to Steve" "When it happened at the cemetery, I thought it was another play, a lady disguised as Tasha but after the other two bomb blast, the M.O fit to the profile case in this file." "Why do you have this file?" "When....back when I was still Winter Soldier, I was assigned to take out her-" "Who is her?" "Yelena. Yelena Belova. That was the name they assigned to Tasha back at the facility. When Baron Zemo took over the reign of HYDRA, Zola was casted aside, Zola got angry and assigned me to take her out, since she was Zemo's right hand. But then, the whole S.H.E.I.L.D fiasco happened and the file just...got forgotten" "Until now..." Bucky nodded grimly. Tony took the file and placed it at the scanner near his laptop. "J, scan this file and project it" "
For Bucky's ring
Enjoy!
"It's time I come clean to you..." Tony started and the rest of his family started joining in the conversation, even Dodger and Figaro walked towards him and curled up near his feet."I...I'm not the only child..." Tony continued and Steve asked "But-" and Tony immediately cut him off "But it was not in any of my SHIELD file. I know. Howard made sure that only I was his child. His only child to inherit his company and...other things. In a way, I'm happy because that meant my sister did not get his alcoholism and attitude." Tony said with a sad smile. Steve gently squeezed his shoulder to continue. "So yeah, I'm not the only one. I had a sister, my twin sister, Natasha Maria Stark or as I call her Tasha. Both of us were...very close. We did almost everything together, from having the same interest in Engineering to the same PJ's at night...that close. She...she was my savior, my guardian angel, my
“That’s OK,” Tony says, trying not to betray his own worry. “We’ll figure it out.”
“Did you fight that monster?” Peter asks, his voice a low mumble.
Tony chased after him, talking to Steve’s angry, retreating back. “In my defense, they were basically asking for our help with a military coup. Actually, not even
“No,” Steve squeezes his hand. “It was--it was all good, Tony. I, uh, I appreciate it.”
hanging from a doorknob.
“I’m sorry I didn’t visit you,” Peter says, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his hoodie  “I wanted to but…”
Sam shook his head, that same sad look on his face.  “He’s a grown man, Tony. I trust him to figure out what he wants for himself. You should too.”
“I”m not,” he says, and pushes his drawing aside to work on a new one.
“We’ll have the chef make whatever you want. Your choice.”
Tony collapsed against him and Steve held him up with is arms. They were both sticky and wet, but Tony wasn’t inclined to move just yet.  He rested his head on Steve’s shoulder, gaze falling into the living room.
“That’s right,” Tony says, still totally amazed. “Hi, Peter.”
“Well, he’s keeping tabs on your vitals,” Steve says. The bed shifts slightly as Steve settles down next to him and pushes a hand through his hair, petting him lightly.  “Bruce said he hacked into your medical chart a few times already.”
“I left! No one got kicked out. I’m just giving Steve some space. It’s fine.”
“Next time, I’ll go with you, ok?”
Unable to wait any longer, Tony frees his right hand and grasps his own erection, only needing to stroke himself once, twice before finally coming in sweet, delirious bursts along Steve’s chest.
His poker face was pretty good these days. He made flexing the hard line of his jaw a habit, so much so that Tony had once jokingly called him Captain Clench. Tony had given him an apologetic smile and rubbed his thumb along Steve’s jaw bone, even though they were in full view of the team.
“ Mr. Stark, I can’t help it if you told me to come to this thing but then didn’t change the reservation.”
“Tony,” he’s gasping now, as Tony makes his touch lighter, more soothing. He moans, dropping his head again and lifting his hips and spreading his legs. “Tony, please,” he pleads and Tony gives in easily.
As they wrap up, Steve catches Peter staring at his shield, and finally, he relents. “Alright kid, 10 minutes with the shield, let’s go.”
He twines his fingers through Steve’s damp hair, pulling him into kiss as Steve moans again and again into Tony’s mouth, his hips snapping erratically as he comes hard inside her. Crying out, he mashes his mouth to Tony’s, eyes squeezed shut tight as if can’t bear to see what’s happened to him. His orgasm spills out of him in long jagged waves, tearing him apart from the inside. It’s never been like this and he wants to rail at Tony for doing this to him, for breaking him so totally apart he’s not sure there’s a way to put everything back together.
