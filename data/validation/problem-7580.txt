“I’m sure there will be food,” Steve said with a low chuckle that barely escaped the cover of the sheaves of metal that covered his face.
“Yes.  Yes, please, Tony.  Please,” Steve entreated.
.  He wondered if that was cruel.  He thought it probably was.
“Oh, so that’s what you’re calling it, huh?” Steve asked, wrapping his hand around Tony’s shaft and giving it a slow, languorous pull, twisting his wrist around the head.  Tony moaned and tossed his head back, looking up at the ceiling.  He closed his eyes.  Smiled.  Let the feeling of Steve’s hand on him wash over him, a pushing force of pressure that centered on the tip of his cock and spread outward, through his stomach and chest, across his nipples and down his spine.  Epicenter, he thought hazily, and looked over his shoulder at Steve.
Oh, he loved the slow, soft, lingering times, too.  And he adored the teasing, playful times peppered with kisses that were part laugh.  The quick, hard, rough times when one of them couldn’t wait.  He liked those, too.
“You know me so well,” Tony said, looking down at the small box clutched in his hand.  Hammer was probably dirty, at least to some degree.  Hard to get where he was without greasing a few politicians’ palms to make it happen.  It had been years since Tony poked around HI’s network, more out of curiosity, drunkenness and a desire to see just how easy it would be than any real interest in corporate espionage. Hell, the backdoor he’d put in HI’s network was probably still sitting there, waiting to be used.  Hammer did his cybersecurity in-house, which meant it was run by a bunch of sycophants who couldn’t get jobs literally anywhere else.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, bending down to clap Rhodes on the shoulder. Rhodes nodded, looking askance at him.  “Well fought, General.”
He walked the remaining few steps over to where Steve sat plopped in the dirt and sank down on one knee.  Up close, he looked just like any other man, just dressed more smartly than Steve had seen before, though Steve supposed the man would probably be considered more handsome than the men in the village.  Bucky said girls would giggle and swoon when they saw a man they fancied, and Steve figured they probably did a lot of that around this man, but the man had kind eyes that tugged downward at the corners when he smiled and he tilted his head at Steve.
She gave him a long look, then nodded once.  “I suppose we are finally getting our date. That’s something,” she observed as they took the last of the steps, her voice mild and light, though the look she gave him was—not sad, exactly, but held something wistful.  They were always a what could have been, and a part of Steve thought they both knew they were better off that way.
.  Tony was waiting for him.  Standing out there in the cool, evening air, with the crowd at his back, chanting for him, reaching out with their bouquets, hoping to catch the King’s eye, even for a moment, and the whole time, Tony was thinking about Steve.  About this moment.  Seeing him again, knowing what Steve was feeling, what he had gone through the whole day.
“He’s close,” Helicarrier Steve said. He spit into his gloved hand, then reached down and started stroking Tony’s cock. “Is this good, Tony?”
“Please, Tony,” Steve heard himself say, and let everything else fade away.  It was just him and Tony.  Just this.  In here.  There was only this. Only them.
“You got me a customized license plate that said ‘CMPNSTG’” Tony reminded him, grinning widely.
“We’ll take it,” Tony said to the saleswoman.  “Two more pairs of jeans like that.  Couple extra shirts.  Something in blue.  Go a size smaller, live a little,” Tony reeled off.  “If you let him try anything plaid or baggy, we’re walking.”
“That all?” Bucky asked.
“Well, I dare say someone needs to,” Jarvis replied pointedly.   “By demonstrating your feelings, I take it you…”
that for Tony, he told himself, though a voice in the back of his head that sounded a lot like Bucky’s named him a liar for the thought.
“Oh,” Steve said after a long moment, drawing Tony’s gaze to him, and God, did it hurt to look at him and think that he might have screwed this up so badly he wasn’t going to get this.  Steve cleared his throat, letting his head dip to his chest for a moment, then returned Tony’s stare.  “So, Thai tomorrow then, huh?”
He helped Tony strip the disaster of a bedspread off the bed.   Tony got a blanket out of the closet and tossed it haphazardly atop the sheet, then climbed into bed, and to Steve’s surprise, rolled over and sidled up against him, breathing in a deep, satisfied sigh.  “You don’t mind?” Tony asked, gaze flicking up to Steve.
“It’s been handled,” Steve said. The elevator opened, thankfully, though Coulson stepped inside next to him.  Apparently, this conversation was not over.
The first brush of Steve’s lips was soft, feather-light, the barest of strokes against Tony’s mouth.  Then more pressure, insistent, seeking, moving his mouth across Tony’s.  Tony canted his head to the side in Steve’s hands, letting the weight shift to Steve, and brought his arms up to claw into Steve’s shirt, drawing him closer.  Steve’s hand wound its way down the back of Tony’s neck, threading fingers through the hairs at his nape with gentle, but insistent pressure.  Steve’s tongue traced the seam of Tony’s lips, nudging them to part, plunging deeper into the wet heat of Tony’s mouth when they did.
, and they would thank you for it if they ever met you. That’s the beauty of it, though. They have no idea who you are, and you don’t know who they are. All you see of them is, well. What you need to see. They’re just there to… be what you need. Something to use. For a little while. Then everyone goes their merry way.”
True, he hadn’t exactly jumped all over keeping that promise with his usual gusto, though he did have JARVIS running a modified version of Zola’s algorithm trying to track down the wayward killer while Tony wondered what his life had become.  He could tell Steve that, and watch Steve thank him with the dull sort of cool politeness that he used to thank Tony for being at the hospital with him or when he found out he lived in the Tower now.  The thing was, he was absolutely certain Steve was being completely sincere in his gratitude.
He cut the repulsors off and slowed until he was just floating.  There was nothing in front of him. Or, there was, but it was too far away to look like anything other than pinpricks of light.  He turned, and let the glow of the sun fill the eye slits on the mask. Even out here, it was bright, at least compared to everything else. It really was beautiful, he thought.  All of it. It really, really was.
“Fine, fine,” Tony mumbled.  “Let’s just,” he waved a hand and reached out to push the call button.   Get out of here, he mentally finished, scraping his hand through his hair.
“You see, I told you the King would kill a boar,” Cam crowed merrily at Steve.
that seemed to thrum through Steve.
“You think its inherently self-serving,” Steve replied, not a question, so much as an observation.
’ these days,” Tony said.
“I—yes—no—I,” Steve stammered, trying to keep up.
“Tony?” Steve asked carefully.
Tony turned and looked out the window, mimicking Steve, though he kept his hands in his lap.  He didn’t know why he was so damned fixated on the no-doubt very timely David.  He didn’t want that from Steve, afternoon hormonal freak-out aside, and even if he did, Steve didn’t, so it was a moot point.  It wasn’t even a point.  It was nothing.  It didn’t exist.
“Though, maybe don’t stop right away,” Bucky interjected quickly, almost speculatively. “I got fifty gold coins against Morita that Rhodes is going to show up before the next half-moon to drag you back,” Bucky finished with a smirk.
“Is Ms. Potts upset about the press thing?” Steve asked.  Instead of answering, Tony noted.  “You were reaching for your phone earlier,” he said by way of explanation.
“You’re going to suck my cock,” Tony said.  Steve’s mouth watered.  He heard a small whimpering, pleading sound, and realized it came from him.  God, yes, that was what he wanted. Needed. Tony always knew, somehow, even when Steve didn’t.
“Let me go,” Steve said, his voice tight with bitterness. Tony sucked in a sharp, shocked breath. It was a punishment, this request. He knew that. Tony wouldn’t grant it. Couldn’t. He asked it to be cruel, and maybe that was beneath him, but he couldn’t seem to keep the words in.
“You never tease back,” Tony mumbled, letting out a huff of air that sounded more chagrined than pained.
Granted, it was probably his own wildly vacillating thoughts that made him feel that way. A huge part of him kept wondering what he was doing here. What he hoped to find. What did it say about him that he was even here? What kind of hero did something like this? Tony. Tony did this, Steve reminded himself. If Tony did it, then it had to be okay. It helped him. Maybe it would help Steve. Maybe it would help him not look at punching bags and see body bags. Maybe he could sleep tonight and tomorrow night and the nights after that without utterly exhausting himself. Maybe he could do all of this again and again and again without worrying that it was going to be another God-damned bad day.
“God, Tony, if they want a pound of flesh, it was on me. Not Wanda. Certainly not on you,” Steve rushed out, one hand going to tug at the neck of the uniform.  It was too tight. Binding.
“Too late?” Tony replied, walking over towards where Steve was still straddling the now useless pieces of Doombot.  “No, I know.  I do.  I know.  I’m not—I’m really not.  I mean it.  I’m not going to do anything.  He’d hate it if we left a mission and someone got hurt.  I know that.”
Tony grinned, then leaned up and placed a quick kiss on Steve’s lips before scooting back on the bed until he reached the headboard.  He pulled his remaining shoe off and tossed it somewhere towards the desk in the corner of the room. His socks followed. He reached for the buttons to his dress shirt, then his hands stilled.
He blinked against the sudden stinging behind his eyes and swallowed hard.  This was it. There was something poetic about the idea, really, he told himself.  Just flying off into the void. Disappearing on one last, great adventure, the way so many explorers had before him.  Earhart eat your heart out, he thought with a shake of his head.
“It was good, Tony.  I--well—it was good.  Very good,” Steve replied, a faint blush staining his cheeks.  Tony felt a warm glow of something that definitely wasn’t abject relief flood his stomach, as he released a breath he certainly hadn’t been holding for any reason.
He looked stupidly down at the pieces of broken porcelain in his hands.
“This wasn’t you, Tony,” Steve objected, turning and clutching at each of Tony’s shoulders with a hand. “Look at me,” he demanded with more vehemence than he’d felt, well, in longer than it probably should have been.  “This wasn’t you.  This—this place, what was done here, this was never your life.  This was Stane and Pierce and the rest of them.”
He always wanted to see his friend, but particularly this morning.  It felt wrong, somehow, not seeing Shellhead down on the beach like usual when he took his morning swim, as if he was maybe avoiding Steve.  Steve knew he was jumping to conclusions, but, well…Shellhead wasn’t there, and he almost always was when Steve got up, and last night had been…what it was.  Whatever the reason, he wanted to see Shellhead with a sharp, fierce need like a drumbeat in his chest pounding out Shellhead’s name. He could call it concern, if he wanted, and maybe that was part of it, but mostly, Steve just needed to set eyes on him.  Make sure last night hadn’t changed things too much. Or make sure it had, he wasn’t sure which outcome he wanted, he realized with a tight grimace.
Tony didn’t respond at first, then finally sighed, and lifted his head back up to look at Steve.  “It was nothing. A trick of the mind or the light, that is all. It does not matter what I thought I saw.”
“I told her we couldn’t spare you right now. She’s SHIELD. She understands,” Coulson replied.
“Steve…” Tony breathed out, brow drawing together, something else, something cleverer, something better, hanging on his lips, but he couldn’t get it out.   “Are you…are you…okay?” Tony asked in halting, stuttering bursts when he could get the air out of his lungs.
“SHIELD thought we should arrive in style,” Steve explained.  Happy jumped out to open the limo door, and Tony ducked inside, and Steve followed.  “Thanks, Happy,” Steve said, as Happy shut the door.
“He’ll be Team Keep Him.  We’ll all call him White James.  It’ll be great.  You’ll see,” Rhodey predicted, finishing off the muffin and scattering the crumbs off his pants.  “I gotta go, too.”
Tony rolled gingerly from his side onto his back and let his arms fall to his sides, seemingly in silent agreement with Steve’s plan.  Honestly, Steve would have preferred Tony giving him a hard time about this, making some of his ridiculous comments.  At least it was a distraction.  Too much of a distraction of late, he’d freely admit, but right now, he could use it.
Later, Tony waits in bed while Steve cleans up.  He puts the glasses back on.  Just the glasses.  Steve decides he loves finals week.
“Of course,” Lord Rand said quickly, giving Tony a short bow.  He almost sounded relieved. Steve supposed that could have gone very badly for him, were Tony the type to pass blame around for any slight.
“The hand you had stuck behind your head?  You were giving whoever was taking the picture the middle finger.  I could see the reflection in the plate,” Steve said, canting his head to one side with a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.  It took a moment for the words to register with Tony.
“Yes. Well, not—not really.  Just kind of mentioned—“ Tony began.
“Natasha said you had need of me, Doctor?” Thor said from the doorway.
“Have you talked to James lately?” Steve asked.  He stopped his sketch long enough to look at it with a bit of a frown and brush the charcoal dust off before looking up at Tony.
Tony woke up with a start and flung himself off of Steve, then scooted down to the end of the bed, eyes darting around the room. Holy. Fucking. Hell. What was that? His breathing was coming in shallow pants and each time he sucked in air, it was like his body lit on fire. The room was coated in it, the bed, the sheets, his body, hell everything was coated in it, permeated by it, it was in him, in his skin, suffusing his pores, filling his nose, drowning out his air and burning its way down his throat like the world’s best alcohol, this wonderful, amazing
Huge thank you to Onetruesikorsky for beta-ing this chapter and being an awesome cheer-reader.  It is an incredible help.
“I—I made you a mixtape.  This is going to end with me outside your window with a boombox, isn’t it?” Tony groaned with an exaggerated eye roll that settled into a soft smile.
Anthony repeated in Steve’s head.  When Steve closed his eyes, he saw Anthony smile next to him and reach for his hand. He could almost feel the slim fingers weaving their way into his own, warm and solid, giving Steve’s hand a light squeeze.
“Well.  I think we’re about done here, don’t you?” Tony suggested, giving Steve a jaunty smile and dropping his and Steve’s glasses off with another waiter.  “What do you think, dearly beloved, should we blow this popsicle stand or what?”
“What do you want me to say?” Steve asked. It came out harsher than he meant it to, but Tony’s solicitousness twisted inside Steve’s chest like a knife sometimes, because Tony would dig deep, open him up and hollow him out of everything that hurt him, and take it unto himself, if Steve allowed it, and that was far too tempting.  He would take my heart with him, as well, Steve thought, and knew it was true.  There was danger there, giving too much to Tony, letting Tony take too much of him, because it would be the pain first, and then—then it would the rest of him, and he wouldn’t be able to leave, because everything would be Tony’s.  Better to hold onto it.  Better to hold onto himself.  He thought it might be the only way.
“Ty will be here.  In the tourney tomorrow,” Tony husked out, staring up at the canopy above them where deer and pheasants frolicked amidst the swirls of damask.
“Don’t see what Dad’s travel schedule has to do with any of this,” Tony said with a shrug.
He downed the rest of the wine from the goblet, then walked over to the bed and sank down on the edge.  Even through the closed windows, he could hear the sounds of a lavish party echoed, which meant Tony would not return to their chambers for some time.  Steve tossed the robe aside, then lay back and closed his eyes, trying to find rest.  His mind was still too full, though, swirling with thoughts as dark as the sea.
Tony had taken a long moment to admire his handiwork, cupping Steve’s ass in his hands and gently lifting and kneading the abused flesh until Steve groaned, helpless, his body going liquid, except for his cock, rigid and demanding in its cage.  Tony had dropped his hands from Steve’s ass, then wound them under Steve’s arms to wrap about Steve’s chest, pulling him close.
“The thought kind of stayed with me over there,” Steve admitted with a deprecating laugh, flexing his hand a bit above the tabletop.
. Would maybe need that, is all. So, that’s what I’m—I’m trying to—” Tony broke off, bouncing a bit on his heels. “Okay, so before I fuck this up entirely, I’m saying… there’s a place.”
“At your eighteenth birthday.  Your cousin, the Lady Margaret? She threw things at me, remember?  Called me an idiot,” Steve reminded him.  He could feel a smile tugging at his lips as soon as he caught Tony’s eye.
“You’re here now.  Why don’t we deal you in?” Steve offered.
“When you put it like that, it sounds almost too good to miss,” Steve quipped.
Captain America—he’s real and he’s back and he wants, what, us to be
“Something simple,” Tony promised. “Simple, as in, I let Pepper handle it, and no former boxing champions were harmed.”
He’d just…gotten used to having Steve around.  Bouncing ideas off of him.  Talking things through.  It was…nice.  Easy.  Somewhere along the way, he’d forgotten that he wasn’t anything like Captain America, and let himself believe that he might be a little like Steve.
“Not much, really. Sam's got me doing this glassblowing thing for veterans, Healing With Fire. So far, I've managed vase, smaller vase, lopsided vase, broken vase and glob of glass,” Steve chuckled, leaning back in his seat. “Think I'm getting better at it, though.”
Come on over to tumblr and visit:  sabrecmc.tumblr.com.   Pretty much all Stony with the occasional Star Wars and X-files fangirling thrown in for good measure.
“I hear what you're doing there. Stop it. Look, Tony, you can't go blaming yourself for this. It'll drive you crazy with what could've been and if only, and hindsight generally fucking you over. That's getting you absolutely nowhere. I don't know what happened, but this whole mess stinks of your dear, departed asshole of a father, and yeah, maybe you and Steve, maybe you two let your own shit get in the way. You never trusted it, what you had with Steve. You wanna know who else knew that about you? Oh, look, we're back to him again!” Rhodey nearly shouted, slashing one hand up in the air in frustration.
At midday, they stopped long enough to stretch their legs, water the horses and have a brief respite.  Steve walked a short way from the camp, ostensibly to have a moment of privacy. Tony’s guards followed at a discreet distance.  He returned quickly, lest they become concerned. Tomorrow, he would do the same. And the day after and the day after. Then he would stray a little further.  Stay a short while longer, returning each time to allay whatever suspicions his absence could possibly arouse. When the time came, he hoped this trust would earn him a few precious minutes before anyone sounded the alarm.  He sighed heavily and waved to the guards as he approached, letting them fall into step behind him.
Steve didn’t know if what Tony had said about the Free States was for Ross’ benefit or what Tony truly believed, but it was wrong, Steve knew that much. The Free States were not going to wither on the vine now that the war was over, nor was the world as inaccessible as it once may have been. They had what was left of Schmidt’s fleet, after all. He carried an army to their shores in those ships. They could carry an army back. Not that Steve was going to correct Tony’s perception, if that was what it truly was, but he knew better, and if he were honest with himself, he suspected Tony knew better, too.
“Just checking in on things. We never talk anymore, Jolly Green. Why is that?” Tony muttered, picking up and putting down whatever his hands could grab from Bruce’s workstation. Bottles, petri dishes, God, was that blood, he wondered as he held a test tube with a thick, red substance in it up to his face and rocked it back and forth, watching the way it clung to the sides in small waves, like one of those pens with the floating scene inside it.
“Someone had better start talking,” Tony muttered, looking between Sam and Barnes.  “Look, you two were over at our house yesterday morning, eating our leftovers and bitching about the Yankees—”
“Partly, yes,” Steve replied.
He just wanted him.  And Tony hated himself for it.
A huge thank you to my beta, tastes-like-coconut for always making me better.  All remaing mistakes are totally the fault of Google Docs.
Those scars, years’ worth of scars, were gone, too.  He lifted his knee up, and yep, the one from when he fell off his bike in sixth grade was gone, too.  Not only that, but he felt...God, he felt amazing. Like he was eighteen again. His joints didn’t ache.  He frowned. When had his back started hurting that much? Because, damn, now that it didn’t, he wondered how he had been upright.  He would bet his entire car collection that if he could run tests right now, not only would the palladium be out of his system, but everything would be fine.  Liver, pancreas, kidneys, all the organs that had been doing double-time with the palladium, I’ll bet they’re all back to normal, he thought with stunned amazement.
“Six months.  Six months, when I could have been there.  Helping him.  Making it easier.  He
Steve stared at him a long, pregnant moment, then walked back over to the kitchen counter and, rather inexplicably, started emptying the paper bag of what turned out to be groceries.  Cans of peas and beans, a loaf of bread, a long, thin package of pasta, a jar of sauce, all placed on the counter with varying degrees of slamming.
He comes home to me, Tony told himself.
“Maybe.  Truth is, I don’t know.  But, I think it gives you the best shot to be able to fight the effects of the BARF and the nanovirus.   Friday will sync you two up and use the BARF to sort of, I guess you’d call it “project” Tony’s dream into your mind, but—you know how sometimes you’re dreaming and you know you’re dreaming?  The idea is that it’ll be like that for you.  Serum’s going to keep fixing whatever is happening in your brain, so you can get to Tony and help him realize what’s happening,” Bruce explained again.  “Talk him out of it.  Slowly. If he can realize it’s all just in his head, Friday thinks he can use the nano-implant’s HUD interface with the BARF to sort of shake himself out of it.  Like throwing up those spikes in the road during a high-speed chase.  In a very technical sense.”
“I just…I,” Peggy broke off, glancing away.  “These past few weeks, I’ve seen you, how you are.  When you think no one is paying attention. And I—I don’t know what happened.  You won’t tell me, and I guess I have no choice but to respect that. But, I wonder…this future that requires you to stay gone so long, that asks you to—to give up so much…is this future you are trying so hard to protect really worth that?” she asked, staring outside the window at the stream of people walking from their cars into the gala.
He shouldn’t have looked.  He knew that.  He knew it was wrong.  An invasion.  Curiosity kills the cat, right?  No one mentioned the furry fucker died from blue balls, Tony thought with a huff, propping the pillow behind his head and staring up at the still ceiling fan above him.
Steve stared at the man for a long moment, his heart thundering in his chest.  He could see himself reflected in the man’s eyes, he thought, which was impossible, and clearly, he couldn’t, not when he looked again, but--he
Tony turned to Coulson.  “Having fun?” he asked with an impudent grin.
Comments and kudos are the only way I know if you are enjoying this and are very much appreciated!
“You’re sure?” Steve asked, prodding carefully at the spot on Tony’s forehead, just below his hairline.
“Nicely done, Half-Pint,” Tony replied.
“Physics
“Not exactly what dreams are made of, I know, but, as you said, you’ve seen it before,” Tony said with a light shrug of his shoulders.  “Are you sure you—“ he started, then broke off as Steve reached a hand up to cover the large scar under his palm.  The skin was warm.  He didn’t know why he had expected it to feel cold.  The beat of Tony’s heart sounded into Steve’s hand.  It was fast, despite Tony’s outward calm.  That small sign of Tony’s unsettlement sent a flood of loose warmth into Steve’s chest.  He is nervous, just as well as I, Steve thought, somewhat startled by the realization.
Clearly, the man, whoever he was and however he happened to be out here in the middle of the night, was not from here. That much was obvious.  Not only did the man simply not look at all like he belonged to the rough, ramshod little crofter’s village that Steve called home, but Steve knew everyone in the valley, and this man was definitely not one of the villagers.  Though, that begged the question, where exactly had he come from?  And why was he alone on a rarely-traveled road in the middle of the night?  There was no horse milling about.  No carriage. How had he even gotten here without Steve hearing him coming? Steve was sure there hadn’t been anyone on the road just a moment ago.
“No shit.  How’re we gonna get anything done?” the one called Rollins demanded.
“I said I’d do it,” Tony shrugged, glancing over at the workstation where the calibrations for the new armor were still running.  “It’s…it’s fine, Pep.  Why not?  Haven’t done the blind date thing since college.  Assuming this doesn’t end with me climbing out a bathroom window and down a fire escape into a dumpster, it’ll officially be the best blind date of my life.”
“Ah, some--well, I mean it isn’t uncommon, even these days.  Some Alphas still want, ah, confirmation, so,” Coulson replied, sounding wildly uncomfortable. Well.  At least Tony knew what would make the man’s composure falter.  Good to know.   “Tony, that’s not what Captain Rogers—“
“Let us get up, then, shall we?  You must be tired from your travels,” Lord Rand observed.  “Your rooms await, and we will toast your good journey at the feast tonight.  I am glad you will be staying with us long enough to enjoy some of the Ridge’s hospitality.  My son has prepared a small tourney for your amusement the tomorrow after our morning tour to Deep Illum.  If any of your knights would care to participate, they are more than welcome.”
“You missed my report.  I assumed that was because you wanted to hear it in private and not in front of the Council,” Rhodes said.
The same thread, Steve thought, the words echoing around in his head like a cry in a cave. Life and death.
“You will get them eventually, just keep at it.  At Mita, they had a pond with fish who would eat out of your hand and let you pet them,” Tony said.  “They lived to be older than most men, these fish.”
“Oh, I think we know exactly what you’re capable of,” Barnes retorted.  “Get the fuck out of here.”
, Tony mentally whispered to himself in a terrible impression of an Australian accent.
And, again, he was
Steve honestly wasn’t sure which one of those was the more astonishing.  He waited a moment for the familiar shame and humiliation to creep over him, but instead, he felt strangely buoyant.  He closed his eyes and breathed in the salt air, flashes of memory assailing him. Shellhead’s mouth. His hands. His eyes when they looked at Steve, almost worshipful in their intensity.  And, well, the rest of Shellhead. There was that, too. He should probably be shocked by his own behavior, wanton as it was, and in a way, he supposed he was, but not because he was horrified by it. Far from it.
“Your—Your Highness,” Almec stuttered, dropping to a low bow as Tony stepped out of the shadows.  He was dressed for the occasion in a deep red doublet embroidered with a golden bird to signify the upcoming trip over ivory breeches.  His crown, thick with gold and studded with diamonds and other precious gems, sat on his head.  He looked every bit the King, in a way that Steve rarely saw.  He worries that I love the King and not the man, Steve thought, but it is the other way around, he realized, watching mutely as Tony slowly advanced on the duo.  Lady Bain stared, wide-eyed, then slowly dipped into a curtsy, bowing her head.
“I see,” Jarvis replied.
“Yankee Doodle went to town, riding on a Ton—y,” Tony sang.
“Tyler Durden is a manifestation of anti-consumerism and toxic masculinity, Objectivism taken literally would lead to sociopathy, and Rand had an affair with one of her followers twenty-five years her junior and then excommunicated him and falsely accused him of embezzlement when he slept around on her, all the while her husband drank himself into alcoholism,” Steve said.
“You’ll figure it out,” Steve said confidently.
He wanted to know. Desperately wanted to know.  It somehow made him feel closer to Tony, these little glimpses into what he wanted, what he cared about, and at first, he’d felt entitled to know, he supposed, if he’d even really thought about it, but now...now, it didn’t sit right.  Maybe if Tony knew he didn’t know, maybe Tony would pick things other than socks and soap, he thought with a sigh.  Probably he would pick things other than fishing gear.  Steve wasn’t going to keep kidding himself that Tony’s little overture was anything other than what he thought he ought to do, as much as Steve wanted to see it as more.  Stil.  It was
it been so long?”
“Remind him that we talked about this, and it’s my weekend with you, so if he wants more time, he’s going to have to renegotiate,” Tony quipped, rolling his eyes and dropping the black cloth napkin into his lap.
“Where’s he going now?” Fury asked uselessly over the intercom as Tony let go of Steve’s hand, which he’d been holding through the pass-through slot, and stalked to the door of the observation room.
.  Tony looked down at the large hand holding his shoulder and had the absurd thought that his suit would be wrinkled.
. Looking, my ass!  You really think I don’t know what you were doing?  You really think the rest of them don’t know what you are?  My own son, for Christ’s sake, a perverted, little faggot!” Howard yelled.  “Do you really think I’m going to send you off to that college and let you embarrass me like this?  Do you?  You get your ass back here!  Tony!  To—damn it!”
He looked down at the empty espresso cup, and thought of the carefully laid out budget Steve had tried to manage, and how strange the things Tony took for granted, like overpriced coffees, must have seemed to someone used to trying to make rent and find a way to eat on a paycheck that stopped somewhere between the two.
“I would…like that, too,” Steve replied finally.
,” Tony replied with a slight shrug.  “Bunch of bad guys tried to beat him up in an alley.  He needs, like, I don’t know, an icepack or something.”
“Oh, come on, now.  It was a little bit because of the hooker thing,” Kirk said, though he didn’t seem particularly offended this time.
“Does this mean we’re going steady?” Tony asked with a flirtatious smile.
This is a belated birthday gift for hellogarbagetime over on tumblr, inspired by a piece of fanart by kelslk.  Thanks so much to my beta, tastes-like-coconut, for helping, as always.
“That’s right…I almost forgot about that!” Tony burst out excitedly.  “Capra did a bunch of those wartime propaganda films with Captain America!  Remember those, J?  Why We Fight and all that? They were on that commemorative DVD of Dad’s.”
“We have a pillow,” Steve said tightly, breath coming in pants. Tony beamed at him.
*****************************************************
“How do you possibly sleep on this monstrosity?” Tony couldn’t help but ask.
“See what I mean?” Howard smirked.  “I put a stop to it as soon as I found out, of course.”
“That’s my ass,” Steve pointed out.
that.
“I sincerely hope so.  You, out,” Tony told Steve’s neighbor, who was still standing there with a pillow case that seemed to hold half a liquor store.  He pointed and jerked his head towards the stairs, widening his eyes insistently.  “Go.  Now. Bye.”
Steve heard Tony’s sharp intake of breath as he turned his head to the side, hot breath warming the silky skin of Tony’s cock that jutted up from the nest of dark, springy hair, full and reddened, a bead of moisture clinging to the head. He cast a quick look up at Tony’s face, satisfied to see the other man’s eyes had gone nearly black in the low light, his hands reflexively grasping then releasing the bed’s coverlet before one came up to circle the metal disc, then follow the path Steve’s mouth had taken a moment earlier.
Brock’s business honestly sounded to Steve a lot like the same kind of set-up as the time his mom’s neighbor, Mrs. Elway, bought fourteen boxes of health supplements that she tried to convince Steve and Bucky to buy some and then resell to their Army buddies, who were then supposed to get other people to sell them.
“New artist,” Tony answered without answering.  “We’re going out tonight. Dinner and the observatory.”
Tony looked up to find Steve glancing over his shoulder down at him.  He slung his arm up and allowed Tony to duck under, so he was flush against Steve’s side.  Tony tipped his face up and got a quick kiss, barely a brush of lips, but enough.  He sighed.
“Good.  Then don’t,” Barnes warned, and that’s what it was, a warning, make no mistake, Tony thought. Steve was who this man had left, and Tony supposed it said something about him that he was willing to give Steve up if it meant giving him a shot at happiness.  An ally like that, someone Steve clearly loved, had to be a good thing, right?
“So,” Tony said, sipping from his mug of coffee.  “What is it anyway?  Some Omega pheromone whammy thing?”
The alien was kneeling in front of an opened panel, a twine of wires and parts strewn around him in what Tony instantly recognized as repair work.  He turned when Tony entered the room and stood. This time, he was wearing a suit that covered him from head to toe in a mesh-like material that almost looked like scales. It was dark blue, mostly, with a few lines of deep red, and Tony had the rather stupid thought that it went well with the alien’s eyes.
“I know,” Tony said.  “Shhhh, hush now.  That’s good, Steve.  Thank you for telling me.”
Steve’s thrusts sped up, then faltered, turned sloppy as he chased the sensation.  He looked down at Tony, who was watching him with wide, dark eyes.   Tony clutched Steve’s hand tighter, then, keeping his eyes on Steve, brought their joined hands up to his mouth and pressed a kiss against the back Steve’s hand at the same time his body bore down and clenched around the shaft of Steve’s cock.
What a contradiction, Steve thought.  Not at all the kind of man he had expected, at least not based on their short-lived interaction in Bagram and the bits and pieces he picked up from the news.  Oh, that Tony, the brash, flirtatious ne’er-do-well was certainly on display at times, but underneath it all was a charming, generous, funny and blindingly smart man who was trying to put something terrible to right, and willing to use that flawed perception of himself to do it.
Tony plucked two glasses of champagne from a passing tray and handed Steve one, clinking the two together.  “To arms, husband dear,” Tony said, nodding over at one of the tables where a tall, bald man Steve recognized as Obadiah Stane was sitting with a pile of chips in front of him. Tony took a long drink, draining most of the glass, then set it back atop a passing tray and took Steve’s hand in his, guiding him over to the craps table where Stane was sitting.
“Speaking of…” Tony began, peering around Steve’s shoulder  with a slight smirk.  “Not exactly sure which surface we’re going to eat on…”
Tony stared at the twisted piece of metal, then walked over and dropped it in the garbage can.  Not like it was sterling or anything.  Probably just some cheap metal alloy from China that would turn out to contain deadly amounts of kryptonite or what-the-fuck-ever in a few years.  He walked back over to the table and lifted one of the butter knives, studying it for a moment.  Holding it between both hands, he tried to bend the ends together to no avail, so he pressed the thin, flat end to the table and pushed.  Ah, leverage.  A slight bend in middle of the knife edge appeared.
Steve raised his eyebrows in question, his mouth flattening into a thin line.  “I’m not entirely sure how to take that,” he said evenly after a moment’s hesitation.
“Really? That’s how you’re going to be?” Steve snapped, lifting his eyes to frown at Barnes instead of the papers.
He studied Steve for a moment, then smiled the soft, half-smile that crinkled his eyes and placed a hand on Steve’s chest, pushing him back against the pillows.  Tony stretched over him to reach the warm oil on the table by the bed and slicked his hands with it, then slowly lifted the material that draped down Steve’s front up until it bunched at the center of his chest.  Steve let his knees fall open in offering and shifted his hips, raising them in anticipation.  Tony’s lips twitched, and his eyes found Steve’s, even as Steve felt the tip of Tony’s finger find his hole, circling the sensitive ring of muscle before pushing inside.
“Seems like an exciting way for you to grow up.  Someone like that as your old man.  For you, anyway.  Someone who would, I don’t know, get you, I guess.  But, you said…yesterday, you kind of mentioned you had, ah, issues.  With your father,” Steve said.
Steve grabbed his pillow and padded out to the living room.  He threw the pillow onto the futon and pulled a blanket off the back of one of the chairs.  He tried to curl himself up onto the futon, but couldn’t find a comfortable position, and finally ended up just laying there, staring at the small window in the corner of the room.
What had he been right about?
Folded in between the pages of the notebook was a list of academic and technical scholarships that had been printed off from the dregs of MIT’s financial aid system, clearly meant for Tony, a separate list of businesses and phone numbers with hourly wage notations listed out beside them that made Tony wonder if Steve had been job hunting, a good five or so years’ worth of some kind of ledger entries of anywhere from twenty to a hundred dollars, and Tony’s aborted attempt to fill out the much-maligned FAFSA tucked into the back of the binder, like some weird repository of their financial woes while Howard was being the world's biggest dick.
“I didn’t mean this--I mean, this is…it’s...” Steve trailed off, looking around.
“I guess,” Tony equivocated.  He wasn’t in the mood to give her what she was looking for.  Some kind of absolution from him that the happenstance of his happiness could provide.  Let her pat herself on the back that her son’s Alpha was some big to-do at SHIELD, and so what if he didn’t hand out Rolexes, Alice, look at SI’s stock prices since we hitched our son to this little red, white and blue wagon.  Plus, we’re diversified, you bitch, Tony snorted, then scrubbed a hand over his mouth to cover it.
“I realize I’ve been neglecting you.  Sorry about that.  You can call me Tony, by the way,” the guy said.
“That’s good,” Steve said. “Got you a couple of things,” he added, nodding at the bag and cup on the counter.  “You should probably take it easy, though.  Maybe some toast first, see how it goes.”
He dabbed again at his mouth, but it seemed to have stopped bleeding, then went over to the tall tool chest that stood in one corner of the garage and opened a drawer.  A clear, plastic package of white cotton oil cloths was inside.  He tore it open and pulled a couple out, his mouth flattening into a thin line.
Still.
He started to walk away anyway, heading aimlessly toward the direction of the balcony, thinking air would probably be a good thing about now, when the man reached out and touched his jacket sleeve lightly, stopping him.  “Whatever he’s paying you, I’ll double it.  Hell, triple it.  I don't think I'd regret it,” he said, not quite managing to meet Steve’s eyes, but not letting go of his jacket either.
“You—you—I don’t know,” Steve finally settled on.  “I don’t know.  I don’t think this is the kind of thing you fix.” He was quiet for a long time, just standing there, holding Tony to him, as if letting him go would be a judgment he did not want Tony to think he was making.  “You know,” he started, voice quiet in the room, with only the occasional crackle of the fire underneath it.  “When Hydra started to grow, we said, it isn’t so bad.  It is a small group.  What can come of it, we asked.  Some even agreed with what Schmidt was saying.  The divide between the First People and the Freemen was so old we barely knew what drove it in the first place, but it remained.  We looked away. For too long.
“Huh?  Oh, yeah. That’s it. That’s all,” Tony rushed out, feeling himself warm with embarrassment as his mind helpfully brought up an image of the red negligee.  “Don’t really need much.  My mom sent a bunch of stuff with me. So.  I’m good.”
“No jests,” Steve assured him.  “I’ll need…” he gestured lamely towards the closet where garments of all kinds and colors beckoned.  “Whatever you think he will like.”  Cam let out some kind of high-pitched squeal and scooted off the bed, heading for the closet like his heels were on fire.
Tony pulled one of the bags of his own blood out, held it for a moment, then grabbed for the others.  He remembered putting them in here with Bruce, going over the security protocols while Bruce checked to make sure they were stored properly.  He’d looked down at the bright, red bag and thought that of all the things his old man had smuggled out of Europe during the war, that vial of Steve’s blood had been the thing he cared about the most and the thing that had belonged to him the least.  And now it was leaking onto the floor like waste.  Someone would have to clean that up.  He looked over at the shoeprint again.
“Well, nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition,” Stark replied with a glib smile that dropped into a frown as he pulled back in his seat and rested his elbows on the table, giving Steve a curious look.  “It’s a Monty Python reference—seriously, Python, you don’t—nevermind.  Forget it.  So, Steve, how’d you meet, ah—what’s your friend’s name who set this up on your end?”
The word hummed through him, sending a shiver of warmth through his chest and stomach like he had swallowed something too hot, almost painful for a moment before it diffused, spreading through his body and settling low in his gut, and he realized he was rock hard.  At that, his brain finally caught up to his body.
Yeah. Great. How the hell was he supposed to work with Tony having amazing dream sex with someone?  Mind if I cut in, probably wasn’t the way to go, given Bruce’s admonition not to try to jolt Tony to instant awareness.
There was a strange pride to the marks, almost like battle scars, something
“You can see into my thoughts?” Steve asked, a hot flush of horrified embarrassment blooming in his chest.
For a second, just before his conscious mind shut it down completely, the image of Tony in a place like that came unbidden to his mind. Tony, with his perfectly-tailored suit pants pushed down to his knees, his hips thrusting his cock in and out of some anonymous person’s body, the muscles of his ass clenching as he came. He blinked and squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, banishing the images and the thoughts that went with them. The card was still in his hand.
She shrugged and pulled the door open, stepping past him and into the hallway where Happy ran up huffing behind her.
Tony stopped, eyes snapping to Steve’s.  “Don’t.  I like it.  It’s…it’s you,” Steve said.  “It’s bold and beautiful and impossible.  It’s you, Tony.  You shouldn’t hide it.  The world should know what you did.”  Tony was just staring at him, eyes burning with some kind of intense scrutiny, as if he wasn’t sure where the punchline would come.  “I like it,” Steve repeated.
Tony let out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding and rubbed a hand at his temples.  He hadn’t gotten this maudlin in years.  No real mystery why now, he supposed, dropping his hand down to the edge of the sink.  He looked up at his reflection in the window.  He was the thing that had changed, when you got down to it.  His hair was still too wild.  The small bit of help from the wind as he walked from the car into the cabin hadn’t done it any favors.  The sculpted goatee and moustache were only a few years old, but he thought they suited him.  His small act of rebellion—hair where hair actually grew naturally? Horrifying, apparently---had driven the media crazy, but Steve told him he was beautiful.  And that it tickled, Tony remembered, eyes crescenting. But, that was another story.
“Let it go, Third Wheel,” Tony piped up.
“Helped,” Pepper interjected emphatically, crossing her arms as she looked down at him.
He didn’t know how much time had passed.  It didn’t matter.  Tony was here. He thought he might have dozed, since he startled when he felt the first chain fall away.  Tony’s hands were on him, working the muscles, keeping him from stretching out too quickly.  He was sore.  A deep, aching soreness, like after a long run or a particularly grueling training session, but not a bad soreness.
too wound up to sleep, but…he didn’t really want to be away from Steve, either. Which was becoming something of an embarrassing habit, come to think.  “Listen, Steve…thanks.  Again. For, you know, everything.  Not just today—which was great! Amazing.   Best day ever, really, forget that stupid thing I said about Chuck E. Cheese.  I don’t know why I do that.  I just say stuff, whatever pops in my head sometimes—but.  I—well, thanks.  Just thanks.”
“Don’t really sleep much,” Steve answered, too quickly, but Tony caught the slight hitch in his voice.
“They will not,” Steve replied with his usual obtuse confidence that the world seemed determined to reward with actual confirmation more often than not.  “Coulson’s on it.”
If only it was that easy, he thought, laying his head down against the curve of his arm and staring out at the city.  It should be easy.  He got paid to have sex with some guy.  Shouldn’t he want to forget that?
Stark Sells Avengers Tower, the headline blared in large, blocky letters, though reading it now had lost the pang of shock and grief that had punched through him the first time.  Now, it was just…a resolute sort of numb acceptance in its place, though he knew that wasn’t it, not really, not with the way his gut twisted and his eyes tightened when he looked at it.  It was a stock photo of Tony underneath, from some event months ago.  The MIT thing, maybe, Steve couldn’t remember.  Or, he could.  If he thought about, he could remember a lot.  But, he didn’t want to think about it.  It looked like the same suit, though.  The one Tony had held up in one hand with a lighter grey one in the other.
“Huh?  Ah, oh, yeah.  That, ah. Sounds good,” Tony said.  He gave Steve a soft, wobbly smile, then ducked past him towards the hallway, grabbing his bag from the sofa, as Steve walked over to the refrigerator and pulled it open.
“Of course not, Tony.  I’m sorry. I didn’t think.  We just need to get some supplies for you. They’re heavily regulated though, so we have to get them from SHIELD Medical, that’s all,” Coulson told him soothingly, like he thought either Tony might rabbit if raised his voice or too much volume might accidentally cause him to lurch forward and touch Tony, which would be bad in some way Tony didn’t quite understand, but “some way Tony didn’t quite understand” was currently glaring a hole through the door of the waiting room, clearly ticked off, and why wouldn’t he be?  Tony was making a scene in the middle of his work, in front of his coworkers, his superiors, making him look weak, and he knew they hated that.
“Thank you for my drawing,” was what came out, probably to the surprise of both of them, though, when he said it, Tony realized that was what he wanted to say.
He bent over and wiped the towel over Steve’s stomach, down his cock and around his balls, then between Steve’s legs and over his ass until he was clean.  It was warm this time, Steve noted, remembering the King’s promise and feeling strangely touched at the gesture.
“Not exactly bored here, Tony,” Steve responded dryly.
“You didn’t have to,” Tony protested, barely half-heartedly.  He pulled the tissue paper out, then unrolled what was wrapped inside, letting it drop into his hand.  He stared for a moment, then let out a surprised bark of laughter that he quickly tried to swallow as Lily stirred. Tony felt his eyes sting, and his stomach went loose and warm, chest tightening as he swallowed past some emotion he could only begin to name.
“Is that what this was, Tony? Just a physical thing?” Steve asked, trying to keep his voice even and not sound too hurt by the notion.
“Sure,” Steve replied.  He walked back over to the stool behind the easel and sat down.  He could do this.  Sure, Kirk was…completely naked and right there and had offered him a blow job ten minutes ago, but that was no reason Steve needed to think about him as anything other than a body to draw.  He looked over again, trying to see the pose and composition in his mind, shadows, light, form, and oh—Kirk’s cock was stiffening up, rising along the inside of his thigh as Steve watched.
“Yes, well, I am relieved to hear my concerns are unwarranted,” Jarvis replied smoothly, trading a glance with Steve, whose jaw tightened for a moment, then relaxed.  “Why don’t I make us a pot of coffee, while the two of you take that new car of yours out for a test drive?”  Jarvis suggested.
“Steve, Steve, please. Please don’t,” Tony whispered brokenly, bending over and running his hands over Steve’s shoulders and up and down his back, tugging slightly, urging Steve up, but he couldn’t, not yet, not while the thing unwinding inside him still needed to be spent. “Please, gods, I can’t—“ Tony pleaded helplessly, then knelt down on the smooth stone in front of Steve, cupping Steve’s face in his hands and tilting his head up, thumbs running over the light stubble covering Steve’s cheeks, back and forth, coming away wet.
“Ooohhh, ohhhh, ohhhh,” Tony stuttered in sharp, panting gasps.
“We’re done,” Tony cut in, making the man nearly choke in an apoplectic fit trying to draw back his words before more came out.  “Marshall, I thank you for your assistance this day,” he continued, a little more conciliatory.  “You have given me much to consider.  Please enjoy the Castle’s hospitality for the evening.  Master Zola will see you are well cared for,” Tony promised, making something in Steve’s chest heave and then tighten.  For a heartbeat, it felt as if all eyes, all the world, was looking at him, seeing him in this ridiculous garb, in his beautiful cage, seeing what he was, though, of course, they weren’t actually looking.  That was part of the story, wasn’t it?  It was their thoughts that saw him this way, Steve realized, with a frisson of discomfort lancing down his spine.  This is who I am to them.  Different from whomever will serve the Marshall tonight, only because of Tony’s regard. “Rhodey, tomorrow afternoon, as usual?  Bring Carmichael.  I’d like an update.”
Steve rolled his eyes slightly at that and gave him a stern look that Tony recognized all too well. If you make that face long enough, Steve, it'll stay that way, Tony thought with an absurd, manic sense of displacement. It was so easy, falling back into this rhythm with Steve. We could always do this dance, Tony thought with a bright pang of nostalgia. Probably because he'd always thought of Steve as the rare soul who enjoyed his tendency to hyper-verbalize everything, like it slotted into the quiet, bottled-up place in Steve's mind, a key turning in a lock that let Steve breath a little easier, live a little better, be a little happier because he could draw on that energy when he needed it.
Steve wasn’t sure if he was the punchline or not, but when Tony looked up at Steve again, his mouth had formed a flat, thin line and there were tight edges pulling at his eyes.  He doesn’t like this, either, Steve thought. The way whatever this is between them was made to feel cheap and tawdry so easily, whether because of Tony’s past or Steve’s job or some combination of both.  People like them weren’t supposed to have something real, something pure, and they were supposed to know that. Accept it.
“Night, Rhode-kill,” Tony grinned, tossing Rhodey a wave.  “Do not let Happy make security badges for my tenants.  I’ll grant you, the building needs some upgrades, but we are not turning this into a demilitarized zone. I know how he loves the 3D printer, but just print out a kidney or something to distract him, would you?”
Well, that certainly wasn’t the reaction he’d been expecting. Tony’s eyebrows raised, brow furrowing in confusion, and he shifted slightly, looking back and forth down what stood for a hallway in this craphole of a building, half expecting one of the Morlocks to be peeking out at him shouting ‘Gotcha.’ A beat later, the door was wrenched open again, hinges screaming as it banged into the apartment’s inner wall, and the man stepped out in a rush, almost slamming into Tony, who hadn’t budged from his spot outside the door.
“Yes, well.  You have not had many occasions to have someone’s…regard…for you shown in quite so…forceful a manner,” Jarvis agreed with a slow nod.
been great press, Steve could freely admit, but then the painting showed up in the hall outside Tony’s bedroom and stayed there, and Steve wondered at it.
him, and yet...yet, here he was.  Alone. Except for the man.  Maybe his father had turned around and headed for Gulleytown.  It was possible.  Though...he shook his head. Nothing made sense, and, really, he mostly just wanted to go home now, anyway and not think about any of this.  His father hadn’t caught him.  That was all that mattered.
“What do you think?” she replied, raising a perfectly arched eyebrow at him.  “Howard saw dollar signs.  Connections he couldn’t dream of making on his own, despite his delusions of grandeur,” she said with a grimace.
Natasha cocked her head to the side, considering.  “He wouldn’t know what to think. He’s never had it happen before.”
“Tweety got any new leads for you?” Tony asked as he picked at a loose thread on the blanket.  Steve suspected one good pull would unravel the whole damn thing, but made no move to stop him.
“I do.  I will, Tony, I promise,” Steve gutted out, stomach twisting with heat and shame.
“Alright, so, we covered your hero complex and my heroes at the complex.  Did you always draw or do you just have a thing for Iron Man? Can’t say I’d object if it was the latter,” Stark told him, taking a big bite of burger.
Tony pulled back and looked up at Steve with a watery smile.  “You okay?” he asked at Steve’s odd expression.
“It isn’t what you’re thinking, I swear.  I’m all in here, Steve. For as long as you want me to be,” Tony promised.
Was he really going to turn his back on Tony because he was embarrassed?  Brain damage. Bruce had said brain damage was possible, and here, Steve was contemplating leaving Tony to that possibility, all because he was, what, uncomfortable? Because Tony fantasized about him.  Not like he hadn’t had his own thoughts in this direction regarding Tony.  Not quite this…creative, but still.  He could hardly condemn Tony for it.
“You have no idea,” Tony replied.  “Come on, Sourpatch, let’s get this party started.”
Home was those things, too, Steve thought.
“I am glad to hear it,” Tony said.  “Master Doran painted my official portrait, you know?  The one of me on a charging horse, holding a sword aloft, all mighty and powerful looking, of course, and not at all like some rooster cocking about,” Tony let out a snort of annoyance, then waved his hand in the air.  “Should be you in something like that, if we must have it.”
. I am, quite literally, going to tear this ship apart.  Oh, I’ll put it back together, don’t worry,” Tony said at Steve’s slightly alarmed look. “I’m just saying, I’m a lot to handle.”
the elevator chimed, like it was providing some kind of audio track to his hysterical mental wanderings.
, but do you care?  No.  Because you are
“Tony…Tony…Tony,” Steve chanted.  “Please.   Please, God, please.”  Tony grinned at the desperation in his voice, the thrill of having done this to his Omega, brought him to this state, was nearly enough to undo him right then and there.  He breathed in a long, steadying breath before dipping his head and wrapping his mouth over the head of Steve’s cock.  Steve was making harsh, guttural noises as Tony applied suction, hollowing his cheeks and using his tongue to work the delicate slit.  He felt another spurt of pre-come leak into his throat as he flattened his tongue and drew more of Steve’s length into his mouth.  He brought his hands to Steve’s hips to guide him in the short, small thrusts that worked Steve’s cock to the back of Tony’s throat.  Tony hollowed his cheeks again, sucking harder as he drew his teeth down the sensitive skin until just the head was in his mouth.  He jabbed his tongue at the slit, then swirled it around the head of Steve’s shaft in wide circles, letting out a low hum that vibrated up Steve’s length.  Saliva pooled in his mouth and he swallowed once around Steve’s cock, causing Steve’s hips to twitch sharply under his hands and a soft cry to fall from his lips.
“So, are we going to talk about the magic dick-egg in the room or are you just going to--I don’t know, pass out on me one of these days or,” Tony trailed a finger though the air in front of him, “whatever it is this Gift thing does to you?”
. He fell back, stumbling, grasping at the air, blinking in confusion, mouth opening and closing. The man disappeared, and a panel slid into the place before Steve could form any kind of coherent thought. The backs of his knees hit the edge of the chair and he sat down hard, biting his tongue.
they were.  Different. Wrong somehow.   Though he hadn’t been able to bring himself to do anything to make them stop, had he?  And here he was, yet again, with his own spend all over him like a boy instead of a man grown.
“Little pressure tactic,” Tony said.  “I get it. Soldiers wanting something, anything that will help, clamoring to their Senators and representatives.  Looks bad not to help wounded vets.  Lots of pressure coming from Congress, it greases the wheels, right? It’s just business.”
Steve remembered then, like Tony’s acknowledgement was a key to some lock in his memory.  It all came back to him at once, so brilliant and startlingly clear that he let out a small gasp, mouth hanging open for a moment before he snapped it shut.  He remembered.  He remembered Tony.  Tony, who looked exactly the same as he had that night so many years ago. Not similar. Not well-aged. Exactly the same, though well over a decade had passed since that night.  Tony, who lived in the mountain’s shadows and walked the road alone at night, who appeared silently from seemingly nowhere and offered him food, though didn’t partake himself.
“That was for in-flight safety,” Tony assured him hurriedly.
“I wanted to...I’d looked into it, but, actually we leave tomorrow, so...not this trip,” Steve replied. He looked back over at Tony.  They were treading too close to things Steve didn’t want to talk about.
It will be better when Obie and the rest of them are rotting in jail, Tony told himself.  When I can show Steve that I fixed it, as best I could.
“No,” Steve replied softly after a long moment. He looked down at his hands.  “Yes. I don’t know. It isn’t just about me, Peggy. You know that.” The car rolled to a stop. A valet swung the car door open, and Steve stepped out, holding out a hand to Peggy.
“The lakehouse,” Steve said quietly.  The sounds stopped.  Tony’s end of the phone went silent.  Then, finally, the sound of a shuddering intake of air.
Steve nodded and put his hands in his pockets, following a half-step behind Tony across the driveway to the garage where Tony’s modern-day Keep Out sign blinked red next to the door.   Tony cast a quick glance over his shoulder at Steve, who had looked away, obviously deliberately, and for that, Tony was strangely touched.
Wind whistled outside, and he could hear the rain pelting on the roof in large drops and thunder rolling off the mountain.  A goodish kind of storm, that was what Peggy would have said.  Angie never much liked the way the storms would roll off the mountains in waves of dark clouds carrying thunder and lightning, but Steve always rather liked those nights. They carried a strange kind of energy with them, a feeling like...like something might happen.  Yes, something might happen, like a brushfire or a flood, he remembered Peggy teasing him when he stood in the doorway and watched the clouds pour down from the mountain.  There never was a brushfire, though one time, the river nearly flooded after nearly two weeks of rain, but someone put up a dam overnight and never even took credit for the feat.
“I can,” Steve acknowledged. Rhodes pursed his mouth and covered it with one hand, giving Steve a considering look.
Steve swallowed and nodded jerkily.  He couldn’t quite manage to get a response to come out.
“Yes.  For you,” Tony slurred out.  “Good. For you. Alpha.  For you,” he repeated with a blush of fuzzy, pleased contentment.  Steve hugged Tony to his chest, keeping him there for some period of time that Tony’s dulled brain couldn’t measure.
“Ah,” Tony said.  Steve heard the sound of ice tipping in a glass, but didn’t comment.
“Give me an enemy to fight, not a hole in the ground to crawl into of my own accord,” Josiah said with a slight shudder.
“Exactly,” Brock said, smile widening.  “That’s my guy.”
“And Pepper left about ten minutes ago,” Steve said mildly, though Tony heard the gentle jibe behind it.
“No idea.  That’s all the detail my contact would give me, and that’s on penalty of you-don’t-want-to-know,” Rhodey replied.  “Though, not classified, more just rumor, but he did say there was talk about putting Rogers up for a Medal of Honor, but then the guy walked away as soon as his time was up, whiiiiich,” Rhodey said, drawing out the word.  “I thought was odd, too, so I checked around, since I figured you were too busy padding the love nest.”
“Should I sing?” she asked with a breathy sigh, like the conversation was already exhausting.  “You’re probably too old for that now, aren’t you?”
“Love you,” Steve murmured, voice thick and slurry with sleep.
It occurred to Seve that it had been a while since he thought about the money. He wondered what that meant, or if it meant anything other than that he had just flown to the Grand Canyon and had dinner and was still reeling. He should focus on the money.  The million dollars.  That was why he was here. Not the way Tony’s eyes always seemed to look at him like a warm caress or how they crinkled at the corners when he laughed, a surprisingly light-hearted, almost giggly laugh that appeared even at Steve’s bad jokes.
“Please, can we just—can we talk about this?  Really talk about it? I’m not—I’m not doing so good here, I know.  I didn’t want this to happen like this. You have to believe me, I never meant for you to find out like this.  I should have told you before we—before last night. I know. But, I don’t want to lose this. Us. If there’s any way to—to salvage this, I think—God, Steve, I think it’s worth it.  I think there’s maybe something really good here, and I—I know I fucked this whole thing up, but can you just—just give me a chance, here? Please? Rhodey will, he’ll—I don’t know, explain better, or—or something,” Tony tried.
Tony.
Steve hoped that was what it was, anyway, and if it wasn’t, well, he had all the time in the world to show Tony that there wasn’t anything to be afraid of.  That he could be...loud, if he wanted. Not in volume, really, he didn’t think that was what Nat meant, but more fully himself, Steve supposed.  As smart as he wanted to be, for one thing. Steve didn’t like Tony feeling like he had to hide that.  Did Tony think Steve would be disappointed that he was brilliant?  Maybe some Alphas would be, Steve acknowledged.  Maybe it would hurt their egos, the way those types got all riled up when Steve had dared to stand up to them, all ninety pounds soaking wet of him calling them on their bullshit.  Fancied themselves big, strong Alphas, who were so worried about everyone knowing it, they liked to show it by throwing their weight around, but only in the fights they knew they could win.
Cam spent the better part of the evening helping Tony with various tasks, some of which Steve was sure were entirely designed to keep the boy occupied and of little actual use to Tony.  It was easy to just kneel here and let everything else, all doubts and questions, fade away as he watched Tony and Cam work, listening to the careful explanations Tony gave of what they were doing, why and how it would all fit together, and the gentle answers to Cam’s halting, but ever-growing, litany of questions.  In here, watching them, he was me sure than ever that he was right about Tony, though, conversely, less sure about exactly what that meant.  His mind wandered from there to the night to come like a stone skipping across a lake.
“You wanted a way out.  But, you wanted to beat them, too.  You took something they did to you, something they tried to take from you, and you turned it against them.  The thing they thought debilitated you, made you easy to control?  You took it and made yourself stronger than any of them ever imagined,” Steve continued.  “Tony...you’re mine.  Mine,” Steve growled low in his throat, making Tony’s heart skip and breath catch.  “Every part of you is mine.  This part…maybe especially this part.”
The ride back to his hotel took a bit longer with morning traffic, particularly since Steve and Brock’s hotel was well off the Strip.  Happy punctuated the ride with the occasional tidbit about some point of interest that sounded like he had been reading Vegas brochures in the hotel lobby.  Still, Steve appreciated the effort since he couldn’t muster much in the way of conversation.  He was still too preoccupied with thoughts of the night before swirling in his mind and his own failing attempts to keep them at bay.
Tony couldn’t react.  His eyes were fixed on Obie, every ounce of what energy he could muster going into trying to force any air into his lungs, but his mind was screaming a horrified, keening scream of denial.  Steve. God,
“I’ll eat pretty much anything if it involves bread and cheese,” Tony replied as he walked away from his position on the deck. It sounded genuine enough, though Tony had a way of saying things that were completely true while not really saying the actual truth that was frustrating as hell.  Steve shook his head. It was just pizza.  Socks were just socks and soap was just soap.  Not everything Tony said or did had a hidden meaning just because Steve was hiding so much.
“We will be.  We will,” Howard repeated, more vehemently, though Stane hadn’t done more than look bored.  “Think they’re going to try the B-1 again?” Howard asked speculatively, rubbing his fingers over his chin.
“Just go get him, okay?” she said, then leaned down and placed a quick kiss to Steve’s brow.
“Simple, huh?” Tony questioned.  He felt the barest touch of Steve’s fingers tracing up his arm, then cupping the side of his face, tilting his head back just enough that he had to look up at Steve, too close now, warm and beautiful and there, right there, right within reach.
“Hey!  Steve doesn’t like that kind of language at the table,” Tony cut him off sharply.  “Also, that’s a gross misrepresentation anyway.  Technically, I want to do both.  Preferably not at the same time, but I don’t really have many boundaries right now, to be honest.”
“Raiders are using your own ports to offload their cargo. I used to watch them.  Sometimes.  When I could see the ships,” Steve told the King in careful, punctuated words.  He didn’t like the memory, hot and sweat-soaked and tainted with a desperate thirst that even now clawed at his throat, but even terrible knowledge could be useful.
Well played, Dad, you giant piece of shit. Ten fucking years, Tony fumed inwardly.
He never should have gotten Steve involved in this. He knew how dangerous it was.  How dangerous Obie was. But he’d let himself be talked into it, and now…now Steve was in danger, real danger, because Obie was done playing around, obviously, and it was all Tony’s fault.
“Was she sure?” Steve asked, leaning forward, jaw going hard.
“Oh, I don’t—ah.  Yeah.  Yeah,” Tony replied, smiling as he felt Steve’s hand wrap around his shoulder, solid and reassuring. “My friends call me Tones.”
“My records do not indicate a message with those particular parameters from Captain America,” JARVIS responded.
Slowly, Steve made his way towards where the castle loomed, covered in an unnatural shadow that seemed to have no source. His feet crunched over the ashen gravel as he walked, the only noise other than the sound of his heartbeat.  Calm filled him.  Almost peace, though the place was too unsettling for him to entirely relax.  The thumping in his temples dissipated, though, and that was good.  Yes. Yes, this was what he was supposed to do.  This was right.
“This Hammer tech is shit,” Tony told him.
Steve stroked Tony’s hair out of his face, letting their breathing calm and blood start flowing back to other areas of the body.  Steve felt Tony pull out, and heard him rummage round the bedside for a towel to clean up as best they could.  Steve grimaced at the thought of Tony’s poor cleaning people.
“The material really breathes,” the salesman said.
“Safe to say, astronauts and low gravity have nothing on you,” Tony grinned, flipping up the faceplate as he landed next to his telescope.
Tony’s eyes darted over to the mirror that hung over the dresser, catching his reflection.  He pursed his lips, giving his image a show of disapproval.  There were a few signs of life in the room, he knew.   He just…didn’t know what these things meant.
Neither of them had ever quite known what to do with him.
“Aren’t Ms. Potts and Colonel Rhodes going to be looking for us?” Steve asked with a frown.
Steve’s mouth twisted into a rueful grimace, and he rolled his eyes heavenward, but shrugged off the robe and allowed Cam to attach the chain around his waist.  The circles dripped down in a graduated triangle shape between the vee of his legs, leaving a good portion of his cock exposed.  His ass was entirely bare, save for a thin chain with a red jewel on the end that fell from the clasp around his waist to sit just above the crease.  He swallowed thickly and glanced over at the mirror, then sucked in a breath and looked back down at the bed.  A bright patch of gold caught his eye, and he reached down to pick it up, holding it in front of him with a frown.
“I…did not know what that was, and I’m sorry I ever opened that drawer that I do not know about,” Tony replied.
“Hey.  Hey, Tony, it’s okay.  It’s okay,” Steve said, keeping his voice pitched soft and low.  “Breathe, okay?  Breathe for me.”
Tony dropped his hand down to Steve’s cock, cradling it in his palm where it jutted out between them.  He ran his thumb up and down over the bars, just grazing the skin of Steve’s cock where it bulged and strained, seeking release.  Steve gasped.  He squeezed his eyes shut and let his head fall back, hips thrusting uselessly into Tony’s hand.
He really, really hated that fucking car.
“Bus is coming,” Steve said quietly after a beat, looking down where he was scuffing his boot through the leftover slush that lined the sidewalk.  Steve looked up and squinted at the morning sun peeking through the skyscrapers in the distance, then over at Tony.  “I know you care, Tony.  It isn’t in you not to.  You care too much sometimes.  All this…”
Steve stared at him for a span of heartbeats, then turned back to Cam.  Some of them chose this life.  Some of them liked this life.  Some of them would profit from this life.  But, none of them were free to simply leave it, and however beautiful a prison it was, however kind their masters, these benevolences were façades, painted stones over sunken eyes on a bloated, ashen face, and he could not afford to fail to remember that.  “Let’s go,” he said to Cam, and brushed past the boy for the doors, suddenly wanting to be anywhere but here.
Truth.
“I have to tell you, I did not see marrying Hot Disapproving Guy in my future,” Tony admitted with a smile.  He wrapped his hands around Steve’s waist and tugged his hips closer. “What you said before, back in the room, about not regretting the things that got you here?  Well. Me, too, okay? Whatever it took to get here—right here, this moment, right here—it was worth it.”
“I know,” Steve replied. He started to run his hand through his hair, then caught himself. “If he’s not or—or doesn’t want to, that’s fine, obviously. I just,” he cleared his throat. “I wanted to ask.”
“I read a paper about it,” Steve said. “Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, I think it was. Sam--he’s a friend, works at the VA.  He gets them and hands them off after a while.  I started reading up on some of the new smart drones in the pipeline and kept going.”
“Oh.  That’s—I mean.  Okay.  That’s—that’s okay,” Tony stammered, suddenly out of breath, nerves shaking with a flood of relief he hadn’t been prepared to feel.  His head was swimming, and the thing that he hadn’t even realized had been coiled around his heart loosened and shrank, letting it skip along at an alarming rate.  “That’s. I mean, that’s good.  Right?  That’s good.  You’re back, so.  Must have—must have gone well, I guess?  Don’t worry.  About the car, I mean.  It’s—I’m just.  I’m—it—it’s great, really.  Forget I said…what I said.  Car’s great.  Really.  I was just—“
Tony sucked in a deep breath, had the blindingly clear thought of
“It’s not that, not—not exactly.  It’s just--“ Tony started.
“Good.  Glad to help,” Steve replied.  “I had a nice time,” he continued after a pause.
“Home with you, now,” the man instructed softly, then even gentler, "It will be alright.  I promise."
“Hey there, Cap,” Tony said heartily, coming to stand by Steve’s side.  “Sorry,” Tony said with complete insincerity to the gathered crowd.  “Gotta borrow Cap for a minute.  Avengers business,” he offered, because that managed to both shut people up and make them feel the borrowed grandeur that came with being close to something that was actually important, like proximity mattered.  He tugged at the sleeve of Steve’s tuxedo and canted his head to one side in suggestion, the crowd melting away before them as they passed through.  Steve followed in Tony’s footsteps until they passed through the French doors out onto one of the balconies, the noise of the ballroom fading a bit out here, low-lit lamps flickering between the open doors.
“Stuff it, Neil, I’m trying, alright?” Tony muttered, taking a sip of lukewarm coffee as he watched the neon-colored image of the astrophysicist helpfully inform him that dreams of the future are filled with gadgets.  “Steve, he has a…really important job-thingy to do, you know?” Tony said, looking over his shoulder at U, who nodded his arm.  Encouragingly, Tony thought.  “Saving the world, protecting freedom and America, and, I don’t know, puppies. Whatever.  Important stuff, okay?  Not like he wanted to go. There was an actual helicopter.  It was very dramatic.”
I'm sabrecmc on tumblr, discord, twitter and occasionally, Dreamwidth and Pillowfort.   Come say hi!
The first, a sleek, slate grey colored one barely fit over his shoulders. The second, a dark navy, worked better, so he settled on that, pairing it with one of the deep blue shirts that had been sent along with the suits. Apparently blue was the new neutral, he thought as he buttoned up the shirt that seemed the best fit, though it was still a bit tight. He couldn’t help run a hand over the material, which had a slight sheen to it. None of the items had a price tag on them, which he assumed meant that if you had to ask, you probably couldn’t afford it.
“Anyway, Switzerland!  That sounds so romantic!” Maria burst out with false gaiety.  “You’ll love it, Anthony.  A trip abroad.  How exciting! Oh, their chocolates are divine.  Like heaven. Have them melt those in some milk for you.  You’ll never want to drink anything else.  Do you remember, Howard?  They used to bring it to me at the chalet while you were off skiing. Such a lovely country,” she recalled.
“This…this is the arc reactor, isn’t it?” Steve marveled.  “Like what you want to build for the clean energy project.”
“That’s not—you can’t just punch it, okay?” Tony said, twisting his head around to frown at Steve in frustration.  “What part of acid for blood did you not understand?  You get your ass in the power loader. Even things out. Then you punch it.”
The plan was both insanely convoluted and essentially straightforward.  Use the machine Howard had been working on in the years after he first came across the Tesseract to go back in time and grab the cube before Thanos could.  Simple. Or, as simple as time travel could get. It was a terrible idea. A desperation play. An idea born out of an unwillingness to face what was right in front of them.  They failed. The Avengers failed. And now, half the universe was gone.
“Tony,” Coulson began, his formerly clipped tone softening.  “It really is going to be okay.  I know you don’t believe me right now, and that’s understandable.  But, Rogers…he’s a good man.  He’s…he’s been through a lot.  I think you might understand that.  You could be good for him.   For each other, I think.  Just…try to keep an open mind, okay?”
“Tony liked trying to please me, not that he ever really could.  Oh, he did try, though, I will give him that.  You, though…” Lady Bain said, watching Steve with narrowed eyes.  “I wonder if I asked it of him, if Tony would want to watch while I fucked you?  He was always such a good boy about watching, you know?  So patient, waiting his turn.  I’ll bet he would, hmmm,” she continued, splaying her hand across Steve’s chest.  Steve watched her, almost transfixed by the implications of her words and the images they conjured up in his mind.  “If he was very, very good for me, I might even let him use that pretty mouth of yours while I fuck you.”
There was a softness to this Tony that was gone by the time Steve knew him.  A fullness to his features, almost like he was a drawing of Tony that had been smudged at the edges.  He was dressed in the remnants of a tuxedo. The bow tie hung loose, the jacket gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt rolled up to just below his elbows. There were ink stains on the underside of one forearm where it must have been laying atop the papers that littered the desk.  He was blinking up at Steve, slack, narrowed eyes slowly going wide. Steve had to stifle the impulse to run over and grab him, just to assure himself that Tony was real and alive and
“You built this?”  Steve asked.  “In a cave?  In Afghanistan?  While a captive?  Tony…this…that’s amazing.”
“A suit?” Steve repeated, blinking over at Brock, who mouthed back, ‘For what?’  Steve shook his head and shrugged. “Are we going somewhere? I thought...I mean...ah...”
He didn't know what to do with that. It seemed impossible, but he was absolutely certain it was true. Why, sometimes, I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast, his mind quoted back to him.
to be subtle.
Yeah.  No fucking kidding.
“This is false imprisonment,” Steve said mildly.
“Thanks, Mr. Stank,” the elderly man, Stan-something, said with a small wave as he shuffled from the bathroom and headed back to his floral lounger.
was dead, and they were all marching, marching--
why Whitney had suggested she could be Steve’s second Omega, because she knew.  She knew, they knew, they all knew. Shame clawed its way up his throat, closing it off, and for a second, it was like he forgot how to breath.
“Right, sure.  Great.  That’s great.  To hear, I mean.  Ah…” Tony stumbled over words, not sure what he should do.  He should do something, obviously, something to make sure Steve was okay and happy because clearly the object here was to never do anything except this ever, ever again.  Ever.   He wiped his hand on his jeans, where they still pooled around his thighs, and brought both hands up to rub Steve’s back up and down in soft, soothing motions.  He wasn’t sure how long he did that, but eventually he felt Steve relax beneath him, whatever tension that had still existed ebbing out, leaving Steve’s body languid and soft.  He contented himself with gently kneading the muscles of Steve’s back and shoulders, feeling the , occasionally placing light kisses in the path his hands had taken.  He heard Steve let out a soft sigh and low hum of pleasure, beneath him, so he figured he must be doing something right.
They entered the Sept together, surrounded by familiar faces, though Steve would remember it all in a daze. Only Tony seemed to have solid form.  The Avengers were there, of course, Thor beaming brightly, Bruce offering a small, wobbly smile as they passed.  Natasha nudged Clint, who smiled down at her, his hand wrapped around Coulson’s.  The Commandos were there, as well. Dugan raised his hand in salute as Morita rolled his eyes.  He saw Ms. Potts in attendance as well, dabbing at the corners of her eyes where she leaned against Jarvis’ shoulder, a trembling smile crossing her features.  Captain Rhodes and Bucky stood on opposite sides of the cracked altar, a holy man between them in the simple brown garb of his calling.  Someone had laid down long, green fronds from the river to cover their path, as was tradition, and his eyes found Bucky’s, a grateful smile forming as he watched his friend start to shrug, then blink and drop his head, wiping his arm over his face.
Bucky Barnes leaning against the front of a tank with a sniper rifle resting in his lap like a cat and a cigarette in one hand, mouth slightly parted like he was caught in the middle of saying something. Steve said it was probably something directed at whatever stupid thing he was getting them into, but he never went further than that, as if he didn’t remember, though Tony knew he remembered that moment perfectly and knew exactly what Barnes had been saying.  The war, Barnes, Peggy, the Commandos, they belonged to Steve, though, and Tony let him have those things, until Steve was ready to part with them, in bits and pieces over the years.
“Ah, no.  Maybe one day.  I don’t know.  I’d have to get a portfolio together, and, it’s really competitive, and, well,” Steve stammered, letting his gaze fall down to his plate.  It looked like a French bakery had exploded in front of him.  How did Tony manage not to get crumbs everywhere? Steve brushed at his shirtfront and pants, trying to make it seem casual and not an attempt to ward off becoming some sort of very large birdfeeder.
“What’s he doing?” Rhodey asked.
“I want a cheeseburger and a milkshake,” Tony replied.
“I should keep you like this all the time,” the King continued, climbing into the bed to sit next to Steve’s hip.  He cupped a hand over Steve’s knee and trace a path up his thigh and then scraping lightly down the same swath of skin with his nails.  “Here in my bed, naked and waiting for me.  God, but you are beautiful.  Granted, I would get precious little accomplished, but....” he shrugged, a small, pleased smile playing on his lips when Steve’s cock hardened at the motion, reaching in vain for the King’s hand where it stroked Steve’s thigh.  “It might be worth it.”
Steve shifted and turned his head to face Tony.
Slowly, Steve opened his eyes, turning his head a little to find Tony sitting on the bed next to him.  That was nice. He wondered, distantly, how long Tony had been there. How much time had passed since he started this.  He had no answer. It didn’t seem to matter.
“The man, he—is he, I mean, is he okay? I didn’t mean to—I thought,” Steve stammered, the words tumbling out of him in a rush.
“You’re judging me. That was a judge-y laugh,” Tony accused mildly, smiling back at Steve.
got you thinking about how to get a robot to learn?” Steve laughed, sounding delighted by the idea, which made Tony’s stomach do that gold medal routine thing again.  “You’re really doin’ this stuff out there in your garage?”
The problem was, Steve eventually figured out, Tony had some idea in his head that Steve needed his first time to be perfect and special and apparently fall right out of one of those Nicholas Sparks books Clint read. Steve was tempted to hand Tony the one called “The Longest Ride,” and tell him it was his favorite. Good God, he could hardly believe himself lately.  It was all he thought about.  He’d thought it was bad before, when he was just pining, just wanting something he thought he couldn’t have, but now that it was something he could have, but was being withheld because of…scruples or something…it was exponentially worse.  He’d lost any sense of propriety, morals, restraint.  Restraint.  Huh.  What was he saying?  He put his head in his hands and scrubbed them through his hair, trying to clear his thoughts of Tony enough to focus, and then thank the good Lord above, there were rock monsters.  He’d never been so happy to hear the alarm.
“What, now?” Steve asked, frowning a bit. “Like right now?”
“Stark!” Fury barked through the intercom. “Why the hell is there a delivery van full of furniture parked at the guard gate?” Tony looked around blankly for a moment.
As Tony looked up at him from between his legs, Steve had the sudden urge to use the shredded pieces of his shirt to try to cover himself.  Something in Tony’s eyes made him shudder. Not with fear, not exactly, but Steve was suddenly very conscious that in any other situation, Tony was the predator, and he was the prey. A primal exultation filled Steve at the thought, rough and hungry.
to Steve, in some way that he didn’t want to share, and Tony hated that.  He was a terrible, petty person, but he hated it.  Steve was his.  He sucked in a breath and realized his hand was splayed over the dog tags, pressing them into his ribcage where it rose and fell and thumped in time with his heartbeat.
“You still don’t have to stay up,” Steve replied, voice tight, eyes darting to Tony and away again with a jittery quality that Steve didn’t usually have, like he couldn’t quite find purchase.
“What reason is that?” Steve demanded.
The quote is by Sarah Williams, from a poem called The Old Astronomer.  It was originally published in England in 1868, but was re-published in New York City in 1936 and popularized in America, so I felt Steve would know of it and it was something that he would remember and think of when he thought of Tony.
“You were falling.  I couldn’t catch you.  That’s all I remember,” Steve said.  He rubbed a hand over his face and frowned.  There was something else, on the edge of a memory he kept trying to reach, only to come up short. He looked up at Tony, worry pulling at his features.
It probably wasn’t meant as an accusation.  It
“I know I will,” Steve replied, then grinned, catlike with confidence.  Tony stared at him a long beat, then tossed his head back with a loud bark of laughter, surprised and clearly delighted.
“Ugh—what are you doing to me?  God, Steve, come on, I think we both know that isn’t true.  Wasn’t that great for you back then, was I?  Kind of screwed up your life, didn’t I?” Tony countered with a frustrated twist of his mouth.  “I mean, look at things objectively. You’d have been better off never meeting me.”
“Give me my peas,” Steve ordered gruffly, though there was a smile behind it.  Tony handed him the bag, which Steve flattened out in the middle of the bed.  He laid down on top of it and reached for the quilt.  Tony grabbed an end and helped, smoothing it over Steve’s chest in quick, jerky movements as a rush of relief and adrenaline hit his system.  “I do love you, Tony,” Steve added, covering Tony’s hand with his own and stilling his motions.  “So much.  So much, sometimes its…”
Steve watched with a strange sort of detachment as Tony dipped his fingers in the oil, then began to stroke himself.  Long, languid strokes down the length of his shaft, setting a leisurely pace.  His eyes were on Steve.  Steve could feel his look, even as he couldn’t tear his own gaze away from the mesmerizing motion of Tony’s hand as he worked his own cock to hardness.  A soft grunt.  A puff of air.  The pace of the strokes increased.  Grew harder.  More insistent.  Tony’s wrist twisted over the head of his cock, and he groaned.  The sound sent a stab of arousal down Steve’s own neglected cock.  To his surprise, he realized he was hard and leaking, and wondered how long he had been in that state.
Thank you so much for reading and being patient with me.  I hope you enjoyed it.  Comments and kudos are most appreciated, even if I don't have the spoons to respond. I read and cherish every one.
“This uniform is patriotic. The Constitution?  Patriotic. The flag?  Patriotism waving in the breeze,” Rhodey said, splaying his hand in the air in front of him.  “Watching the two of you go at it like a couple of seals fighting over a grape? Not my patriotic duty, man.”
“No,” Tony insisted.  “I’m not—I can’t.  I can’t, Steve. It’d be like he was right.  He—Howard, he got you to sign that stupid paper, and I can’t do that.  So.  Just, no.  No. Okay?  Drop it.”
“Of course,” the man assured Steve, “I’ll pass it along to Mr. Stark’s office.”
“No need,” Tony said.  “Earl—can I call you Earl?” Tony started, twisting the chair around and cocking his head to one side, phone held in the air as he wagged it back and forth a bit.
“But…you don’t even agree with hardly any of what he stands for…I mean, there are other things. Things I didn’t mention, so you should probably, you know, look into that before you decide anything,” Tony protested hurriedly.  He glanced at the garage.  The loud voice was shouting that he should go there.  Go there, and it would be quiet.  He didn’t move, though.  “I don’t—it’s your vote, so.  Do what you want.”
“Better watch it, Calzone. Cap’s got that freaky super-hearing thing, remember?” Rollins said.  “Has a thing about that O of his.  Hell, he about put Rumlow here through a plane the other day just for asking about his O.”
“He’s still frowning a lot and hasn’t moved anything,” Cam called out.  Steve rolled his eyes.  “He rolled his eyes!”  Cam pulled a smug look at him and wagged his head back and forth, rolling his eyes in mimicry.
Well, the drill was yellow, so there was that.
me.  He needed me to take care of him, and you…you just shoved that shield at him, patted him on the head and handed him another world to fix!” Tony spat out.  “What the hell is wrong with you people?”
It was done.  Whatever it was, it was done.  In the span of the few hours since he’d woken up this morning, his entire life had done a one-eighty.
“Keep people at a distance, I guess,” Kirk shrugged.  “Easier.  With all of this.  Or, whatever.  Most people don’t like me much anyway, so, why bother, right?”
“It’s fine,” Steve said, reaching out and moving his piece.  “Your turn.”  Cam did as the King had instructed, effectively castling his King.  Steve moved his Pawn, as Tony had suggested, because, damn, that was actually the better play, much as it annoyed him to admit.
“When they leave me, they’re changed.  Different,” Hammer sniffed. He pushed his fingers through Steve’s hair again and cupped the back of his head, twisting Steve’s hair into his fist.  “You’ll see.  Now, open your mouth.  Don’t worry, don’t worry, I know what you’re thinking, but you can take it all.  No choice, really.  I’ll fuck your face and then let you ride me.  Did Tony do that for you?  He didn’t, did he?  He wouldn’t.  See?  See?  You see, he doesn’t know what you need, I keep telling him, but he doesn’t listen.  He never
He has one. He has one. Like that was something to point out. He has one. Of course, Barnes has one. Everyone has one. That’s the point. That’s always been the whole fucking point of it. He has one. He was reading way too much into three words. Hell, they weren’t even the usual three words you read too much into.
Tony lifted Steve’s hips slightly, and there--oooh, Steve squeezed his eyes shut at the sudden burst of pleasure deep inside.  A breath of air punched out of him as his body rocked with the motion. His cock bobbed, twitching with interest, as Steve’s spend leaked down Tony’s stomach and thigh.  Sex and musk and sweat filled his nostrils in a heady combination. He breathed it in. Tasted the air on his tongue. Tony rutted between his legs, his thrusts growing harder, losing their finesse.  Steve’s body blazed, the coldness driven from him.
“You gave me truck balls for Christmas,” Rhodey said, lifting his head up to cradle it in his hands.  “You had the package sent to the Pentagon.  Truck. Balls.  I opened them in front of two Joint Chiefs.”
“Wait, what?” Steve bristled, frowning at Natasha. “You put a bug in my shaving kit?”
“He helped me when he didn’t have to, all because he read some treatise I wrote and thought it was interesting,” Bruce said.
Steve watched the little man scurry out, then looked over at Cam.
“That was good,” Steve said, nodding at the screen as the credits flashed up on the screen.
“Too early to get maudlin, eh?” Steve guessed.  “I’m Irish, ye wee fish. Maudlin’s in our blood,” he said, letting the accent he tried so hard to get rid of slip in.  Shellhead’s eyes went almost comically wide, making Steve laugh and slap a hand atop his thigh with a whoop of delight at Shellhead’s expression.  “Ma made sure I could talk without it. Said I’d never amount to anything, if I couldn’t speak proper English. ‘No one’s gonna hire you if you sound like you fell off the boat yesterday, Stevie,’ that’s what she’d say.  I can speak the Gaeilge, too,” Steve said. “They banned it in the schools, but I taught Bucky some anyway. We said it was our secret language.”
“It’s awful. What happened,” she said.
“You did that before you knew about the whole—the whole thing with your Dad,” Steve continued, expression softening.  “Tony,” Steve said, drawing out Tony’s name in the sweet, earnest way Steve could manage that Tony could never quite pull off.
“Once,” Tony replied.  “A long time ago. You hear stories...or I did, when I was a foolish young man who longed for adventure.”
“Couldn’t get a hold of him, but yeah.  It will be, anyway,” Steve responded.  “Should I change before we go?”
“SHIELD is—it’s doing good. Helping,” Steve replied flatly into the quiet void of the kitchen.  Outside the window, the squirrel was back, turning an acorn over and over between its claws, like it was trying to decide whether to have it today or save it for later.
“Sure,” Stark said easily.  “I mean, there may be the occasional squabble over who ate the last Pop-Tart. Spoiler alert, it was Barton.  And movie night.  Ugh, don’t get me started on how many times we had to watch Harry and the Hendersons.  God, that movie, I can quote it backwards.  But, are you really going to say no to the alien demigod?  I don’t think so.”
“Tony,” Steve said.  His voice sounded funny.  All tight and angry.  Crap. He was worried.  He was probably going to start ordering people around, Tony thought with a long, drawn-out sigh.  He blew a puff of air, intending to get the hair that had fallen in front of his eyes out of the way, but it didn’t work, so he determinedly did it again. Then again.  “Tony, are you okay?” Steve asked, gentler this time.
He picked up Bucky’s phone and dialed Ms. Romanov’s number.  She picked up after a couple of rings, her voice smooth as always.
“Steve big,” Anto whispered, glancing up at Steve before quickly looking away.
The thought thrummed through him, filling him with an intense, burning need.  He wanted to come on Tony’s cock, to feel what it was like to come like that, with someone inside him, when they were still part of him.  Maybe, with Tony, it could be different.  He could be different.
“Exactly. Oh.  I fell in love with you, and I knew I had to tell you the truth.  And I was.  Had it all planned.  And then D.C. happened,” Steve said.
“They asked, and Steve, really, that’s his doing, not me.  Not really.  I just help out with a few things, here and there,” Tony said, hunching his shoulders a bit and making the chip bag crinkle again.  Damn it.
“’Bout fucking time,” Barnes said.
“You suggested his son because that is something that would keep you in line, but the Ul… you said the Ul wants these weapons fairly badly, right? Ostensibly to protect the wastes against the Chitauri, but...” Steve trailed off.
“You look at me a bit like those prisoners look at the dog with the key,” Kirk told him, then smirked and rolled his lips together.
“You walked into a tree,” Bruce reminded him, swiping away a laugh with the back of his hand.
“Sure, yeah, we can go soon,” Ty agreed.  “It’s just, well…” he trailed off, biting his lip and raising his eyebrows.  It was a practiced move.  Literally. Tony had seen him practicing various looks in front of the mirror one morning when he’d come back to get the Nanorobotics paper he’d left at Ty’s apartment.  Tony wanted to roll his eyes, but he was too dizzy to try.  “See, I told the guys here all about you, how much you like to party, you know, and I thought maybe it might be fun if we all hung out for a bit.  Just the four of us.  None of that craziness downstairs. Bunch of losers, am I right?  No wonder you wanted to duck out.  What do you think?  You’d like that, right?  Just us?”
“Your distress is never a disturbance, Steve. You calmed soon enough, but I—I worried.  That last night had perhaps been too much and too soon.  I wondered that I shouldn’t push you too far, not with everything you’ve been through, but you…” he broke off and shook his head, mouth curling into a rueful smile.  “You always surprise me.  You were beautiful. Incredibly so. I don’t think I could ever tire of the feeling of watching you give yourself to me.  Your pleasure…it is truly a wondrous gift, my treasure.”
“I’ll say,” Rhodes said, regarding Steve with a discomfited frown. He paused, started to say something else, then seemed to swallow the words. “I think I’ll go find Ross and make sure everything is in readiness,” he said instead, bowing slightly and taking his leave as Tony waved him away.
The backs of Tony’s knees hit the edge of the bed first, and he sat down and scrambled backwards, while Steve crawled up to follow.  He was hard again, his cock jutting out against his stomach, leaving dots of pre-cum on the sheets.  Tony was sprawled across the stack of pillows that lay against the headboard, legs slightly splayed, one hand running up and down the front of his chest where the reactor used to sit.  Tony’s cock was red and swollen, curving over his stomach and leaking over the sparse line of dark hairs that trailed down from his belly button.  His brown eyes were blown wide and dark, watching Steve make his way up the bed.   Tony reached down between his legs and stroked himself, once, then again, his cock twitching as Steve’s eyes followed the movement.
Steve woke at dawn the next morning, as usual. He figured he should go ahead and take his morning run, keep to routine, but his head was too full of what Sam had said the night before about kissing Tony to do much of anything but roll off the sofa.  He found a spare shirt waiting for him outside the door to the bathroom, relieved that at least he wouldn’t have to make his way home wearing the entire uniform.  Keeping as silent as possible, he showered and changed, closing and locking the door to Sam’s apartment on his way out.  He could have taken a cab back to the Tower, but decided to walk it, try to clear his head.  He found himself replaying the scene from the banquet last night over and over in his head.  Tony had seemed…off, though he couldn’t quite place why.  After all, Tony had his “thing” last night, but that had never caused him any kind of embarrassment or fluster before.  If anything, the man usually strutted around in anticipation.  Yet…last night, Tony had definitely seemed oddly defeated, something that didn’t sit easily on his features, out of place where bravado and brashness usually warred with good sense.
“Did someone—“ Steve began.
How charming.
“I have no idea,” Tony shrugged, one eyebrow raising as if he thought Steve might furnish some answer.
.  Yeah, he thought a few minutes later as he rested his head against the Kia’s backseat, this was probably not going to go well.
“You do know this is the men’s room, right?” Tony asked with a flat grimace.  He tossed the towel into the basket and turned around, leaning back against the bathroom’s counter.
“Then why did you come?” Tony asked, the anger slipping off his face for a moment into a gutted, distant look, before he closed his eyes to Steve and his expression hardened again. He opened his eyes again, but did not look at Steve, just started picking up various items on the table and moving them around, seemingly at random.  It was a small victory, Tony’s disconcert, but it was something, Steve thought.
Continuation of Part I.  Please heed the warnings from that chapter.
“You look good, too,” Steve replied, since that seemed easy enough to say and had the benefit of being true.  Tony smiled, eyes drooping shut and curled in on himself a bit.
“I’m going to try not to be offended on a number of different levels,” Steve replied dryly.   To his surprise, Stark laughed at that, then started toward him, one hand reaching out like he was going to grab Steve by the shoulder.
“He’s going to chase off dinner,” Steve warned, though he didn’t actually sound particularly worried.
Eggs. Another of the alien’s
“I—I guess.  I mean.  Mostly, maybe.  I’m just, you know, checking a few, ah, news sites.  Stuff like that,” Tony said, holding up the tablet in one hand and tilting the screen towards his chest so Steve couldn’t see the MIT header on the top of the page.  “Are you going in to SHIELD?”
“I’ve thought about you.  Like this.  So many times,” Steve said in a voice thick with emotion.  “But, you…you’re more beautiful than I ever imagined, Tony.”
“Do you miss your parents?  I know you haven’t had a chance to visit since, ah, since you left them,” Steve finished, putting the pizza boxes down on the kitchen counter.  Tony watched him pull two white plates out of the cabinet and put them on the counter, too, then open the cabinet with the glasses.  “Wine?  Or, there’s lemonade, I think.  Maybe some soda.”
“That is what I thought,” Cam nodded, brighter and buoyant now.
“That was...wow,” Tony said, breaking the kiss and huffing out a low laugh, his eyebrows peaking under his brow. He ran a hand down the side of Steve’s face, cupping his jaw until Steve’s eyes found his.  His thumb traced a line over Steve’s cheek, coming away wet. “You were magnificent, Steve. Perfect for me. So good, my darling. You made me so happy, you have no idea, Steve, how happy you made me,” Tony continued, petting Steve’s skin as he spouted praise and assurance that made Steve feel like he was glowing.
“You really want to go there? Sure, yeah, okay, there have been some changes since Afghanistan.  I think we can all agree that getting held hostage for three months will cause you to reevaluate your life choices,” Tony admitted.
The piece he finally settled on was comparatively simple.  Nothing flashy.  Just a bit of lace along the slip, held up by two straps, one of which was demonstrably uncooperative.  Below the lace, the black fabric was sheer, until it reached the lace trim along the bottom where it settled just below his waist.  It was the garter belt that sold him on the ensemble.  It hugged his waist, giving it a narrower appearance, and arched high over the black satin panties underneath.  The garters themselves tapered down to clip to the darker band of lace along the top black stockings that rode high on his thighs.
“Recipe for disaster,” Fury was saying.  “Look, Cap, if you don’t want Stark, you want to pick someone else, whatever, we can make that happen. Tony’s young, he’ll find someone--”
“Johnson,” Steve recalled.  “I told him about Johnson one night.  You think he…did this?”
He spent the rest of the night thinking about what might be an appropriately conciliatory activity, finally settling on ‘breakfast,’ right before he dragged himself out of bed and to the sink, where he splashed cold water on his face.  He looked up at his reflection in the bathroom mirror.  He looked…tired, yes, true enough, but…he braced his hands against the marble and let his head dip down to his chest.  Damn it.  But he also looked excited as hell, and he wasn’t exactly blind to the reason.
“Yes,” the King nodded.
Conference Room Steve had pulled out, dragged his pants back up over his hips and was wiping his cock and Tony’s ass off on his t-shirt.
“Steve, please, ask me for anything else,” Tony pleaded. “You know I would give you anything in the world that is in my power to give you, but I can’t—”
“That a yes?” Tony questioned, keeping his tone light, but even he could hear the tense hopefulness in it.
Tony finally pulled out of him, and Steve had to resist the urge to sigh.  He rolled to Steve’s side and pressed a kiss to Steve’s shoulder, one hand smoothing down the beads and fabric.  A moment later, Steve felt the bed give as Tony got up and went to the wash basin to clean himself off.  He returned with a warm, damp towel and wiped the mess from Steve’s stomach and thighs, then dipped it between Steve’s legs, giving Steve a sardonic, playful look as he carefully wiped the cloth up the crease of Steve’s ass, catching the drip of fluid as it leaked out of him.
He reached for his phone and dialed the number before he could second-guess himself. It rang more times than he remembered. Just when he was about to hang up, the phone clicked as someone picked up, and a woman’s voice—different than before—came on and recited a new address and code.
He wondered if that was awkward for Obie.  Negotiating over Tony.  He hoped it was.  He hoped it was weird and uncomfortable and all the things he’d felt sitting in his mother’s parlor listening to infomercials while she calmly explained that Obie had offered to take him through his first Heat.  A shiver of distaste curled up his spine and settled in his stomach as he remembered the shocked horror he’d felt at hearing that had even been on the table.  Sure, his Heat had been a blindingly unpleasant experience without an Alpha, but, God, Obie?  He’d known the man his whole life.  And he was at least three times Tony’s age.  And he was…he was Obie.  The idea of…well, of doing
“Wow, people really do mellow in their old age,” Tony teased, voice laced with faux wonderment.
“Wanted to keep the whole superhero initiative on the down-low,” Steve continued.  “Plus, you could be a target, if too many people knew about you.”
“No, I told you, the island,” Tony said with a grimace. Did the woman just flat-out not pay attention?  And he had her running his company.
“Speaking of, where’d you find this one?  Some pleasure house teach him to clench up and Sitwell fall for it again?” Hammer asked.  He dropped his hand from Steve’s chin and walked over to flop down on a small, tufted divan, plucking a peacock feather from a vase and waving it around in the air.
“Okay,” he heard himself say.  “What time?”
“Yeah.  I do,” Steve acknowledged, giving Tony that soft, tender look that crinkled the corners of his eyes and made Tony’s stomach swoop down to somewhere in the Carolinas.  “You never talked much about your mom.”
“How fare you?” Tony asked.
“I didn’t hear him say that,” Stark said sharply, giving Steve a hard look.
Tony had gotten up this morning, ordered Zola to him and had that overseer sent to God only knew where, because of what Steve had told him last night.  That much Steve knew to be true.  Steve wondered what tale of innocence or ignorance Zola had woven to avoid a similar fate.  He wondered how Tony would react if he told him about other things.  Hammer.  Zola. This Lord Stane, whoever he was.  Though, what had those men truly done in this world?  Would the King even see such things as an evil or was the issue with Lucien more a matter of personal inconvenience?  Sending away one overseer was hardly an indictment of a system that allowed such things, after all.  The King still ordered Steve to his bed, Steve reminded himself with a fissure of disquiet.
“So, ah, thanks again, Tony,” Steve said into the darkness after an awkward moment of them standing there, silence hanging in the space between them.  “I—I really had a good time.”  This is when we’re supposed to kiss, Tony thought, somewhat hysterically.  All the movies say so.  He was pretty sure that would go disastrously poorly for him, though, given how his past terrible decision-making on that score had gone.  “Well,” Steve continued.  “Guess I’ll call it a night then.”
Tony was leaning over him, hands braced on either side, chest heaving with deep pants. Steve stared up at him for a moment and then went to reach for him, but found his hand somehow occupied with a large piece of the headboard.  Huh.
“You know that story in the Bible?  About how Omegas were formed from the rib of the Alpha?  I know, it isn’t real, I do, but…sometimes…sometimes, it felt like there was this part of me missing.  That I wasn’t whole.  And then, there was you, and it was gone. That feeling of needing to look for something.  Not just you, but, being around you.  It changed something in
“You can’t just ignore this, Tony!” Rhodes said in a loud, frustrated voice. “He’s not some foot soldier, for God’s sake!”
By evening, the extra supplies had arrived, and they spent a pleasant hour or so in the kitchen preparing the items for their meal. Steve got the coq au vin heating in one fondue pot and grated cheeses melting in the other, while Tony chopped up slices of potato, and soon enough they were laughing over Steve’s mistaken assumption about the implications of the dish. Tony initially tried to demur, but finally let Steve feed him, small bites of meat cooked in the boiling broth and breads that were coated in melted cheese. It was a different kind of taking care of Tony than this morning, but it felt good nonetheless, and Tony couldn’t seem to stop smiling a bright, pleased smile each time Steve offered him food, so he counted dinner as a success.
“You should eat,” Steve suggested.
“He’s unconscious on the second stairwell,” Steve explained.
,” Bucky continued.  “Don’t do anything stupid, huh?”
“It’s crazy.  I don’t even—I don’t even know him, Nat, not really,” Steve replied.  “I don’t know his name, what he looks like, what he even really sounds like…it’s—it’s—I don’t know what it is.”
“Then, it appears the choice is yours,” Tony dipped his head at Steve.  “Training rules apply.  I would be…most distressed were our visitor to be harmed in any way,” he warned, giving Steve just the slightest quirk of his lips.
He was up quite high in the mountains, he knew that much.  He could tell by the scale of the peaks and the thinness of the air.  By all rights, whatever folly or sickness or worse drove him from his bed at night and covered his mind with an impenetrable fog should have led him to his death at the bottom of one of the many crevasses that made scaling the mountains an undertaking only for those who valued a chance at fleeting glory over their own necks. Yet, here he stood, not a scratch on him from what he could tell.
“I think mostly she just worried it was going to be one more thing to deal with,” Steve explained. “One more difference.  I had a bunch of health problems growing up.  Sick a lot.  Couple of surgeries.  Always missing school.   They wanted to hold me back a couple of times, but she pitched a fit. It was hard.  Making friends.  Fitting in.  I was always the weird kid who had to eat at the allergy table and couldn’t go to PE.  It was really just me and Bucky.”
“Well, it makes a whole lot more sense my way if you put the ‘in bed’ on the end of it.  Speaking of thongs, the whole, ah…Rhodey-arranged dance of perfect timing?” Tony asked, waving his champagne flute in the space between he and Steve. “You said something about agreeing to it because you wanted to see me as just a customer, not—not
“I only share my advice.  You may pick up the pebble or not.  I tell you this, the King will lose interest. He always does.  It is the way of men who can have anything.  They want a bit of everything,” Kadina replied.  “It is the men who covet to whom you should aspire, King’s Prize.  Grasping, little men who are honored by your service.  They will want what so enthralled the King, you will see.  Offer them a smile and beg to give you anything you want.  Trust me on this.  This one,” she continued, pointing at the younger girl.  “She will love and be loved, and end with memories.  Can you eat memories?  Will they clothe you and warm you and put a roof over your head?  Silly child.  When I leave here, it will be to my own manse on the High Road, with several of Zola’s little flowers in tow.  I shall wave to you all from my carriage.”
“Jesus, fuck,” Tony murmured, seemingly unaware he’d spoken.
“All the missions are fine,” Steve answered in a dull, flat voice.  Tony didn’t know what to say to that, because it sounded like something good, but it wasn’t, though Tony didn’t have the first clue why.
“I have no doubt,” Tony said with a formal nod as he strode over to the Lord’s dressing closet.
“Happy will pick you up tomorrow at seven,” Tony bit out in a hard voice that didn’t seem to leave any room for argument, still staring up at Bucky on the top of the landing.
“Almost there, baby. You can do it,” Tony encouraged. Steve let out a choked, desperate sounding sob as Tony pressed down hard on his prostate, then let up, then pushed hard again and again, repeating the motion over and over as he pumped his fingers into Steve’s body. Steve’s back bowed and he let out a sharp cry, his cock once again hardening in Tony’s hand.
“Favorite Trek movie not Wrath of Khan?” Jim continued.
Please note that I have no medical knowledge and want to keep it that way.  Can't even stand to watch Grey's Anatomy. I'm that squeamish.  So, any medical stuff in here is from the quickest Google search I could possibly get away with doing and is likely largely inaccurate.  Suspend disbelief for me, would you?
Tony stepped forward and wrapped his arm around Steve’s waist.  He nudged Steve’s foot enough to for Steve to catch on and plant his feet on top of Tony’s boots.  Steve threw an arm over Tony’s shoulder and slid one around his middle.  The repulsors ignited, bright, blue flames sending them twirling into the sky.  He looked at Steve, head tossed back, a wide, giddy smile splitting his Alpha’s features as the ground got smaller and smaller beneath them and the halo of grey-blue sky growing thinner above.   The dog tags jumped between them with the force of their ascent, stretching out towards Steve’s chest in a thin chain of pebbled metal.
“No,” Steve said, putting his hands on his hips and trying to look anywhere but at his best friend, who was, even Steve had to admit, not entirely wrong.  He just wasn’t sure if Bucky was entirely right either, and it was the space between those two things that was driving him crazy.  What had started out as sex for money had turned into, well, sex for money, but with some sort of strange almost-friendship thing forming between him and Tony over the past month or so he’d been making his regular visits to Tony’s house.
He got up and walked over to the sofa and sat down, staring at the blank, black screen of the television where his reflection gazed back at him, blurred and distorted, which somehow seemed about right.  He pulled his phone out of his pocket and looked down at the screen. No messages.  Of course not.  Opening his contacts, he hit the number at the top and waited, feeling his stomach clench as it rang.
“I worked on some additional parameters for his code, upgraded his internal processor and put in a few more learning algorithms. Which,” Tony continued, warming a bit to the topic.  “Is to say that he now understands that the slippery-when-wet sign is not a part of his fire suppression regimen, so.  At least he’s stopped just spraying everything,” Tony finished with a diffident shrug.
brutal with the Draw Four,” Steve shrugged.
“Is it not beautiful?  Look at how fine it is!  Did I not tell you?  It was a gift from the Ettan Emissary long ago, along with their finest concubine for whoever was King then, but look!  It is fixed up as if new for you, see?  Here, you are to sit there, in the back, so that you may see properly and be comfortable,” Cam told Steve, pointing a finger towards the rear as they approached the carriage.
this, Tony?”
“Are you sure?  Kind of sounded like it,” Tony argued, then shrugged and waggled his eyebrows.  Steve rolled his eyes and grinned down at Tony, and then, without thinking, leaned down and kissed him, quick and light.  Next to him, he felt Tony’s body stiffen and he slowed, blinked up at Steve with wide, startled eyes.  Steve looked up and caught their reflection in the doors just before the doors swooshed open.   For all the world, they were the picture of a happy couple, out for a night on the town, too wrapped up in each other to notice the flash of cameras around them that brightened the glass, the pointed fingers, the stares, the way heads turned and eyes widened.
“In your head, it’s different,” Barnes snapped back.  “Come on, Steve.  Look at you.  Your back is killing you.  Your hand…you sure as hell don’t need to be pushing a mop around all day, and you know it. I see you at the end of a week, man, and it kills me.  And, that’s me, who has watched you do this to yourself since you were a ninety-pound-soaking-wet-ball-of-fury.  Stark, shit, man.  He’s dying to take care of you.  He’s been dying to spoil you since you two met, and I literally fought a bear with a lamp to prove it, so.  You know. Can you just let him?  A little?”
Then Tony was grinning up at him, wide and bright and looking suddenly so happy that Steve was momentarily caught off guard by it. “You were jealous!” Tony accused, grinning madly.  “Captain America was jealous! I want it on record, JARVIS, make a note,” Tony practically crowed.  Steve’s mouth twisted in annoyance, though he’d been doing the same mental gymnastics just a moment ago. He’d had the good grace not to shout it loud enough for Freedom Tower folks to hear though, for crying out loud.
Tony pushed open the door and stepped inside, making Steve turn in startle and nearly bump his shin into the glass coffee table next to where he was standing, making the Newton's cradle metal ball toy sitting atop it begin clicking back and forth in a kinetic frenzy .
Except it wasn’t supposed to be like this.  Maybe not every time with someone was amazing.  It would be unfair to compare everything to--to a particularly good experience.  But, well.
. They—they hurt him. They were going to kill him. Hell, we saw it almost happen.   I couldn’t—they don’t get to do that,” Steve snapped at him, the words coming out harsher than he meant them to be. “It’s—I can’t let—they don’t get to do that.”
“Sleep now,” Tony urged. “I’d wager you have earned it, my dearest one.”
“Good, good, you’re so good, Steve, look at you.  God, you’re amazing.  So sensitive.  Going to get you open, now,” Tony told him, and that was all the warning Steve had before he felt Tony’s slick finger slip inside him to the knuckle.  Steve barely had a moment to adjust before Tony crooked his finger and tugged, then slid it out, only to push in again, this time all the way.  A surge of hot pressure sparked its way down Steve’s cock, curled there at the head and throbbed insistently. The urge to touch himself, to find some kind of friction, was almost too much, and he ground down on Tony’s finger, seeking the sensation of being filled.
Steve staggered backwards, the sound that tore from his lips echoing into the gaping chasm below.  His shoulders dug into the craggy rocks of the mountainside at his back as his feet scrambled for purchase on the gravelly path, and he grabbed wildly for anything to hold onto, coming away with only the scrape of rock under his nails.  Stilling himself, he looked around him in horrified confusion. Where was he?  What was happening?  How had he gotten to this place?
“Anyway,” Pepper said pointedly, “while not actually discussing it in any way, shape or form, you’ve certainly dealt with far worse than a little fully-clothed PDA. The public is eating it up, Stern has backed off, which Matt says means the police are dialing it down a bit for now, and the press is too distracted by a great story to do much digging at the moment.  Your, ah,
He loves me, Tony thought, not for the first time tonight, but finally hearing it for the first time.
“What?’ Rhodey asked.
“I don’t see why not.  You’ll need an attendant, anyway,” Tony replied.
“I didn’t look,” Steve replied, suddenly queasy.  Now that Tony was in someone else’s hands, it was easier to let himself feel the pain, or else it had just gotten worse, and he wasn’t sure which one of those choices was more of a worry.  “The suit was stuck to the skin, and I didn’t want to pull it off.”
“Eh, I’ve got, like, an actual list of people who would beg to differ, which I should probably tell you tops out with my dear, old Dad, and I’m pretty sure the person who has known me the longest recently tried to have me killed, but putting that aside for the moment, your take on all things Tony Stark is somewhat of a, let’s call it a novel approach, shall we?” Tony replied.
The backs of Steve’s legs hit the edge of the bed, a large, wood-ensconced behemoth that dominated the room.  He was suddenly unsure what he should do.  Should he undress Tony as well?  His throat worked around the thought, up and down, trying to unstick whatever it was that suddenly prevented him from swallowing.  He lifted his hands up and held them there, hanging in the air between them, then settled for Tony’s waist again, as it seemed the least objectionable place that still allowed him to feel Tony under his fingers.
“Tony,” Steve said, turning to face him, his tone gentling.  “I don’t think you have the first clue how smart you are.  I don’t think anyone does.  If you want, this guy will give you a tour, let you look around, and then we can leave.  If you want to do something more, well.  That’s up to you.  I’m going to be with you the whole time.  Nothing bad will happen.  No one is going to make fun of you or be rude to you.   I promise.”
Stane shrugged, not arguing with Steve’s conclusion.  “Tell you what, Steve.  Here’s the deal.  I don’t want to see Tony cut out.  He’s the Golden Goose, see?  But, we need that Goose to stop chasing rainbows and unicorns and do what needs to be done.  Surely you can see that?  So, how about this:   You stop pretending you’re something you’re not, quit filling Tony’s head with nonsense about what great things he can accomplish, stick to using that pretty mouth for what it was intended and maybe we can work something out.  Let Tony go back to doing what he does best, building things that go ‘boom,’ not this ridiculous energy thing, and no one has to get hurt here, Steve,” Stane offered.
Sam.  Wanda. Vision. T’Challa.  All gone.
Steve stared down into the liquid pools of Tony’s eyes, tracing their edges lightly with his finger.  He gently brushed against one crease, a smile starting to crinkle around Tony’s eyes, and moved his charcoal pencil back into position to refine the image a bit.  He could never quite get the expression on Tony’s face just right.  It probably had something to do with the fact that Tony was movement given form, whatever his expression was one moment, the next emotion was already bleeding into it, leaving it impossible to truly capture on the page.  Didn’t stop Steve from trying though.  Again, and again, and again, he thought with a sigh.  Glancing up from his position on the sofa in Tony’s workshop, he realized Tony was still talking to him.  Or at him.  It was hard to tell sometimes.  Generally, a response from Steve wasn’t required, though he knew Tony enjoyed the company more than he’d admit.  Or maybe he just liked an audience.  Again, Steve was left with shifting sands under his feet, never quite able to find any sense of solid ground with Tony.
“We create weapons. We don’t create the wars they’re used to fight, Tony,” Obie pointed out.
“Where’s Steve?  Is he—“ Tony broke off.  He couldn’t ask a question he couldn’t handle the answer to, so he just let it hang there, hopeful and terrified.  He raised his eyes to Coulson’s, then looked away, unable to hold the other man’s steady, knowing gaze.  “Where is he?”
“I used to go up on top of our building when I was a kid.  Back in Brooklyn, I mean.  That’s where—that’s where I grew up.  Seemed like you could see the whole sky up there,” Steve remarked with an odd sort of wistfulness in his tone.  New York City was probably the last place Tony would suggest for stargazing, with all the city lights and Jersey’s factories too close for great air, but whatever.  Stars were pretty, blah, blah, blah.  “You’re right.  There’s a gatekeeper on so much of the world, one way or the other.  Who you are, who you know, how much money you have, your—your health.  Always someone ready to tell you that you can’t do something.  Guess maybe you know a bit about that,” Steve acknowledged with a small nod.
“I’m saving it for lunch,” Steve said.
“It was a long time ago,” Steve replied, his voice gone quiet.  The whole room seemed quiet, or a silence with a different timbre to it than just the usual.  Tony’s gaze swept over the mantle, with the obnoxious clock he really was going to turn into a timing device on a nuclear weapon one day, so help him, to the dark green, plaid sofa to the simple kitchen with its cheery yellow refrigerator and countertops laminated in a mustard yellow with small, green vines running around the edges, like someone had tried to make the place match once upon a time, when someone who lived here had actually cared about this place.  It occurred to him then that this place may be what Steve had left, and that he might have chosen a place removed from the world not because Steve didn’t want the world to see what he was, but because he didn’t have a place in it.
“Obie, that’s…that’s not what it looks like. There was a mistake.  I told you, Dad, he—“ Tony started shakily, the words seeming to rush out  and tumble over one another in their hurry.
“Hey, there you are!  I was wondering when you’d drag back in,” Brock said brightly, walking towards where Steve stood with their bags lined up on the end of the bed.  “Well?  Come on, let me see it!” he added, making a gimme gesture with his hands.
“Oh, God.  Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, that’s good. That’s good. Don’t stop,” Tony panted.  “Don’t stop, God, Steve,
No telltale splash appeared at Steve’s words.  He put his hands on his hips and ducked his head with a slight frown, then lifted his eyes to the horizon where the waves slapped at the sea.  If Shellhead truly didn’t return or refused to help…maybe after last night, maybe Shellhead changed his mind? Maybe, after last night, he wanted to keep Steve here so they could…Steve cut that thought off, stashing it away with the rest of the things he didn’t want to think about.  No, no, Shellhead wouldn’t do that, Steve told himself with a shake of his head. Even if he didn’t want to see Steve leave, he would help, if that was what Steve wanted, Steve was sure of it. Even if it meant Shellhead would be alone, and Steve would never see him again.
“Yes,” Tony managed.  Then, “No.  I don’t know.”
“Bucky’s here?” Steve said, mind blanking for a moment.
Steve let out a breath, put his hands on his hips and looked off towards the tiny kitchenette, where Tony could hear a small refrigerator humming and could just make out a toaster oven with two burners on top and a microwave on the counter.  Packages of ramen noodles were stacked by flavor next to a smattering of crackers in small packages that seemed to have come from a restaurant where someone foolishly put them out for patrons to help themselves.
Tony dug into his pocket and pulled out his phone, hitting the familiar number. It rang four times and blessedly went to the reprieve of voicemail. He closed his eyes and let his head fall to the cradle of one hand where his elbow banged onto the table, making his empty espresso cup jump.
“You will rest now,” Tony told him.
“Is this what you want?” Steve panted, voice tight and thready.  Tony’s hands reached out, grabbing for anything, everything, bunching in Steve’s shirt and pulling him closer.  Their mouths clashed, teeth and tongue, hard and punishing. Tony groaned into Steve’s mouth, the kiss turning sloppy and wet, Steve’s tongue sweeping inside Tony’s mouth, swirling around his own, flicking along the soft edges of it, up and down the sides, and for a moment it was enough to wipe everything else away.  He could feel Steve hard against him, and he reached down a hand between them, catching Steve’s moan against his lips as he stroked Steve through his trousers.  It was good, so good, to have Steve’s hands on him again, wanting him, so close to what he wanted, but the whole thing was wrong, off somehow that his arousal-fueled brain couldn’t seem to catch.  Steve pulled him closer, drawing their hips together, trapping Tony’s hand between them for more friction.  One hand gripped Tony’s hip hard enough to bruise, the other settling in its familiar place, gentling against the back of Tony’s neck, rubbing at the skin just above Tony’s collar, ghosting over the fine hairs there.
“Sure.  No gang signs, though,” Tony admonished as the student leaned in and held out his phone with one arm.
“You do have the argument that it might actually be a matter of life and death, so…” Tony shrugged.  He couldn’t believe he was legitimately getting cockblocked by national security.
“I do,” Steve admitted.  He craned his neck down and planted a quick kiss on the top of Tony’s head.
“The Inn is called Firstpost, did you know that?  The King said it is because one of his ancestors had to stop there when his horse went lame, and the innkeeper told the old king that he would take his bad fortune no further along the way with him.  And he didn’t!  The old king had great success on his journey, and so, it became tradition that any king or queen who leaves the city will spend the first night there,” Cam recounted, clearly enamored with the story. “I hope we leave our bad luck behind.  Do you think we will? The King says we will, so it must be so.  But, sometimes luck works differently for kings than for slaves, I think,” he finished, frowning for a moment before whatever worries he had passed from his mind, as they were wont to do when you were that young, Steve remembered.  Cam opened the larder again and pulled out the bag of candied orange slices, happily popping one after the other into his mouth.
“Just rumors, I guess. Stuff you hear.  That sort of thing,” Fury replied with a low shrug, dangling that out there for Steve to reach.
!” Cam hissed through his teeth.  “Can you not just tell him what he wishes to hear?  He will believe you.  He wants to believe it, so he will!  And things may go back to the way they were.”
“That’s…it isn’t like I don’t appreciate the sentiment, Tony.  I do.  I know you mean it.  But…money was what came between us before,” Steve reminded him.  “We’re not talking a minor difference in assets here.  What about a pre-nup?”
