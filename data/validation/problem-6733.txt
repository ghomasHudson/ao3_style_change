He'd loved Pepper, maybe he still did.  So why was it surprising that he'd loved Rhodey, too?  His fingers flexed at his sides, forming fists for a second before he forced them to relax.  Maybe he still loved Rhodey.
“Too late, you said anywhere,” Steve said, and Tony would've said something short and obscene, but Steve was still holding his hand, his fingers tangled in Tony's.  He smiled, and he seemed to glow with it.
But nothing could be that easy.  DJ saw them coming and took off running.  He shot across the great hall, straight for the open door of the billiard room.  Tony was right behind him, clearing the door in time to see DJ go scrambling across the floor, ducking under the pool table and rolling across the carpet.  Bouncing to his feet, he grabbed the edge of the side table, tipping it over and sending the chess board crashing to the floor.  Chess pieces spun in all directions, clattering across the empty fireplace.
"PETER!" Tony said, and Peter stopped, his eyes blinking owlishly in Tony's direction.  Tony slumped back into his chair.  "Is it a cat, Peter?"
A minute later, the passenger side door opened, and Stark leaned in.  “Okay if I sit?” he asked.  He held up the cup holder.  “I brought a bribe?”
“I’ll let Jarvis know to put it on my tab,” Steve said, clearing the way for Tony as they crossed the lobby.
Tony took a sip of his coffee.   He didn’t miss any of it.  He just hated change.  And he needed to get a decent night’s sleep.
Tony didn’t raise his head from Steve’s shoulder.  “I love you,” he whispered, and it didn’t matter, Steve had needed to hear that so badly that he would’ve heard it from across the room.  Tony’s arms tightened around his neck.  “I don’t know if I told you.”
“Right,” Steve said.  A muscle twitched beside his eye, and he pressed a finger there.  “I mean.  Right.”
Jan studied him, her mouth a flat line.  “You’re getting a bail fund for Christmas, that’s what you’re getting.”
The words finally sank in.  "You?  YOU disabled your-"  Tony pointed a finger in DJ's direction.  "Have I been fighting your spacial programming for, for-"  He rocked back on his heels, caught between wanting to strangle his child and wanting to laugh until he cried.  "For YEARS, for YEARS I've been fighting with that code, and you're telling me that the reason you run face first into everything is because you deliberately sabotaged your own code?"
Tony let out a whoop, a sound of pure joy bursting out of him, and Steve was laughing, high and bright and warm in his ears.  They shot between the buildings, the motor roaring as they cut through the parking lots, one after another, accelerating as Steve found one narrow gap after another.  Tony found himself grinning, his arms wrapped tight around Steve's waist, his body moving easily with Steve's on each turn.
His mother rolled her eyes.  “Bucky likes that tea of hers, thick as treacle it is.”  She turned her attention back to the soup.  “I’m sure I wouldn’t know, Stevie, but I do know that it’s bad luck to speak of them.”
Tony stared at him, one hand braced on the counter.  He reached out, placing a single finger on the edge of the plate, dragging it out of Bucky's reach. “You do,” he said, stating the obvious, and Bucky gave a one armed shrug.
"You should just give in," Stark said.  He hopped back up onto the billiard table, the muscles of his shoulders flexing as he heaved himself up onto the top.  "He missed his calling.  A man this good at dishing out sustained guilt would've been perfectly suited to being a Catholic priest."
“Breakfast?” Tony called from the bedroom, and Steve folded the paper back up, shoving it into his pants pocket.
He twisted around and found Jan standing there, staring up at him, her arms full of fluffy white towels.  He opened his mouth.  Closed it.  “Uh-” he managed.
Steve slipped through the gate, pulling it shut behind him.  It creaked, the hinges resisting him as he wrestled it back into place.  Steve made a mental note of that as he headed up the path to the door.  “Hey, Buck,” he said, stepping into the cottage.  “Do we have any-”
“It's almost as if you find yourself in this situation more than you would like,” Jarvis said, and Tony paused.
It took a painfully long time to pry himself loose from the covers of his bed and struggle to his feet.  Then, swaying on legs that did not want to hold his weight, he stumbled into the bathroom.  After a quick attempt to restore his basic humanity, he headed out of the bedroom.  He spared a moment’s consideration to finding a shirt or a pair of sweatpants or something, but it just honestly seemed like too much work.  He was wearing a decent enough pair of boxers, and Rhodey’d seen him in worse.
Bruce sank down into the chair next to the bed, his shoulders slumping.  “Well, for getting shot, not bad,” he said, giving Tony a wry smile. His hands hung down between his knees, his fingers flexing.  “The shot went wide.  Tore the skin, skimmed your ribs, but the damage is minimal.” He glanced down, then back up, meeting Tony’s eyes.  “You’ve got half a dozen new sutures, and you’re going to be, uh, well, sore as hell for a while.”
“Judging by how many extra words you use every time I’ve spoken to you, I gotta say, yes, it does seem that you just like the sound of your own voice,” Steve said.  Tony stared at him.  Steve smiled.  “Could be wrong, though.  Could just be that you take so long to get to the point that by the time you get there, you’ve forgotten what it was that you were trying to say.”
DJ smiled. “Okay,” he said, as Strange stepped through the portal.  Pausing only long enough to grab his backpack, DJ took a step forward, hitting the portal at a jog.
He was starving, but the very thought of food made his stomach turn over.  He breathed through his nose, his teeth clamped together as he struggled against an unexpected wave of nausea.
He laughed, and it was sharp and ugly.  “Who needs to buy another one?” he asked, pushing himself upright.  “I’ve got plenty more.  I’ve got-”
Tony tried to pull away, but Steve followed him, his face tight.  “You came looking for me. You asked me for help.  You need to actually let me help.”
“Is someone being murdered in here?” Tony asked, leaning in.  “Because it sounds like someone's being murdered, and I have to object to that, there are rules, and all of you have at least one parent who will notice that you're missing and or dead, so let's not do that.”  He arched an eyebrow at them. “Right?”
Tony shook his head.  “You’ll never be cold here.  Never be hungry.  Seldom bored.  There’s always something to do, and someone who’s doing something interesting, or something new or-”
“That's pretty much what they put in the yearbook about us, yes,” Rhodey agreed with a ghost of a smile.
Stark was wearing some sort of silk dressing gown, tied loosely at his waist, the hem fluttering around his thighs as he walked.  His legs were bare beneath the edge of the robe, and Steve felt his face heat.  Before he could turn away, Stark caught his eye.  “Are you not coming in?”
“Hey, Pete.  You keep sneaking out during the rush and Tony's going to have your head.” Steve popped the waffle, crusted with sugar crystals and perfectly browned, into the warming oven.  “You hungry?  Special tonight's chicken fried in panko and tossed in a pepper and maple glaze and served between two Belgian waffles, with arugula and pickled vegetables.”
“And I guess that’ll have to do.”  In the front seat, he heard Tony shift, his thumbs tapping on his phone.  “And ‘reasonably sure’ is about the best anyone can do, with this place.”
His lips quirked up in a slight smile. "I got married," he said, his eyebrows arching. "That's about as public record as you can get. It was going to come out."
"You look like a Sport."  Tony's head tipped to the side, his eyes narrowing.  His nose was bright red and it was somehow endearing.  "Old-fashioned.  I should get you a straw boater."
Steve grinned.  “Okay,” he said, pushing himself to his feet.  “I hung your picture up on the fridge.  Do you want to see?”  DJ shook his head, but he was smiling.  “Gonna trust me?  Okay.  I like it, you used my favorite color this time.”
“Yes.  It is,” she said, her face expressionless.  “He didn’t, though.  Because it’s an Olympic sized pool, and after some quick and rough calculations and then calling Bruce and making him do the calculations over again, they-”
"Fabulous," Tony said.  Steve glanced at him, a puzzled look on his face.  "Namor and his people consider 'formal attire' to be the same booty shorts and bikinis they always wear, except with a cape,” Tony said, his voice pitched too low for the bystanders to hear. He spread his hands.  “And when they're up here, they guilt trip the world by making those capes out of the trash that we asshole surface dwellers have dumped into the oceans.”
She considered him out of the corner of her eye.  “Then the kitchen,” she said, her voice brisk.  “With the rest of the help.”
She looked up at the house, her jaw tight.  “I walked through these doors, because I had nowhere else to go.”  Her chin dipped, a slight nod.  “And I learned something very important.”
“I expect you to research anyone who shows up claiming a relationship to him,” Tony said, cutting him off, his voice tinged with ice, “and if you find their claim to be plausible, I expect you to pay them off and send them packing.”
Not the truth, not really, but enough to bring Hammer’s head up.  “I-”  He swallowed.  “I did, I was-”  He stopped, the bottle bouncing against the desktop as he dropped it.  “He promised me money, enough money that I’d never have to see this place again, that I could finally be something, be someone, get out, easy street, all the way.”
Jessica was leaning against the wall next to the door, her arms crossed over her chest.  She was watching the goings on with a smile that was faint, but very real.  “Is this 'Achy Breaky Heart?'” Tony asked her.
Tony took a deep breath. “Steve...  I have cold hands because, well-” He tapped a finger against the arc reactor.  “I might have some circulations problems.  Not because-”
“I will murder both of you,” Darcy said, and it sounded like she meant it.  They both went still, and Darcy smiled at trip. “Declare them.”
“He leaves pieces of the newspaper in every room of the penthouse. In case he wants to reread something, or maybe in case I do.” He pinched the bridge of his nose. “He laughs at stupid old movies. He stacks up books on every flat surface. He folds laundry while he watches the news and grumbles at his shirts when the news isn't good.”
“Yeahhhhh I thought that too. But he was dead set on what he wanted, he wouldn’t even look at other options.”  She said with a snort.
“You aren’t used to working the front are you?” He asks with a laugh. Damn, that laugh makes a shiver go down his spine. He feels even more flustered, how is this man so charming without even trying.
“I thought you were possibly in a competition for the ugliest bouquet ever?” He admits, the only other explanation he can think of.
“Psh you would never. You always take care of me, I know you wouldn’t do anything to hurt me.” Tony says as he finally relaxes in his hold.
“Leave the theater Mr.Barnes? Because it is cast members only right now.” Ms.Dale nearly shouts in that theatre voice that nearly all directors use.
“Oh I definitely was, can’t wait to show this to you in the morning.” Natasha says, taking another sip of her drink.
“Stevie, are you ready to close up because I have two tickets for-“ Bucky cuts off, only then does he realizes how he and Tony are practically leaning across the entire counter towards one another.
“Don’t be embarrassed sir, we all look at porn. And I’m going to be accessing your computer remotely to help resolve this issue, but I can guarantee you I’m sure I’ve seen worse.
“I like you too. And I wanna make out with you too. And yeah, Thad is a douche. I was just going out with him because I thought the guy I actually liked could never possibly think of me that way.” Tony says as he walks up to him, getting so close he can smell the cologne on his skin. He feels like he’s seeing him for the first time, truly seeing him.
“1.) That says Tony Stark, and 2.) I will let him know you thought his last name was Stank.” She says, letting out a small chuckle.
Her hand flashed out, a short, sharp movement, and a hand closed over the bowl of the spoon.  “It’s not her.”
“What the hell is going on?” Ellen asked, ducking around him. “Are you-” Her head came around and she stumbled to a stop, her heart in a throat.
They didn't.  In many ways, Steve knew they shouldn't.  "I think we do," he said, then shook his head.  "No.  We don't have to do this." He looked up.  "But I think we should."
Tony considered that.  "Tempting.  But no."  He glanced at the bench, and reached for the toolbox.  "I've got work that I have to-"
She sighed.  “Uh-huh.”  She picked up a coffee cup from a nearby table.  “If he heads for the flat top, I’m going to have to call for security.”
Happy shrugged.  “Don’t know, to be honest.  But he’s scared of something.  Something he thinks the wards’ll keep out.  But that means, he doesn’t want to hire help for the harvest.  And despite all of Tony’s advances, I can’t do it by myself.”  He looked at Tony.  “The irrigation-”
Steve leaned over, cutting off the flow of words with a kiss.  “Thought you could skate,” he whispered.
Steve looked down to find Val staring up at the bells.  Steve looked up at them as well.  “Oh.  Jan made bells out of mistletoe.”
“So he’s dropping you off on the way?” Steve asked.  DJ nodded.  “Want me to pick you up?  Or is Stephen sending you home?”
“Maguire,” Steve said, not sure if he should stay or go.  He glanced at Tony, who didn’t even glance in his direction.  “News from Captain O’Brien?”
“Bleeding,” Harris said, and took another sip of his water before setting it down.  He reached out, rubbing the cat under its chin.  “Why can’t you sleep, DJ?”
DJ nodded.  “Early,” he said, one finger sliding back and forth, scratching across the fabric of his pants.  His shoulders were tense.
Steve let out a bark of laughter.  “‘An annoyance,’” he said.  “Yes.  That’s a way to put it..” He didn’t want to meet Tony’s eyes now; he felt stripped bare in a way that he didn’t appreciate.  “There were never any anarchists.”
Pepper made a face, even as she handed him a cup of tea.  “Mr. Stane has been very reluctant to hire this year,” she said, giving the ledgers a puzzled look.  “And I don’t know why.  Financially, the estate is doing well.”
Tony paused, his cup halfway to his mouth, his other hand hanging limply at his side.  He looked down, at the shattered remains of the armor that was scattered across the floor.  He opened his fingers, letting the heavy wrench slide free.  It crashed down, bouncing off a chunk of a shoulder plate with a sad, metallic clang.  “Huh,” Tony said, taking a sip of his drink.  “Sounds like a bell from this side, too.”
"Stop it," Steve said, and he was grinning, his blue eyes bright, his hair flopping over his forehead. "Remember rule 22."
“FUCKERS,” he yelled.  “Looking down your nose at someone who wants you to change your so-called fucking art, but then, the moment you have to feed someone with a lift-threatening allergy, or a dietary requirement, and you’re just annoyed by the entire thing.  You’re just-”
“Do not bring up your charity calendar idea,” Ellen Ning said grabbing her by the elbow. “Jesse. No.”
Tony pressed a finger to his pursed lips, his eyes narrowing.  “You make it work,” he said at last, his face softening.  He held Steve's eyes for a second longer, then turned away.  “Come on.  I haven't had my picture taken in at least ten hours; much longer and I'm going to go into withdrawal.”
“I am, and-” Steve rocked backwards as Tony stepped, fully clothed, into the bathtub.  Steve’s hands shot up, catching him around the waist as water splashed over the edge of the tub and all over the floor.  Steve lashed out with one foot, bracing them in the tub as Tony’s full weight settled against him.  “Are you out of your mind?”
“Right,” Steve said, running a hand through his wet hair.  “And I’m done.”  He frowned at Tony.  “I thought you were putting DJ to bed.”
Steve looked up from his laptop.  “Probably a lot,” he admitted with a slight smile.  “But if this is about the bakery leftovers-”
The hallway was quiet, Tony’s steps echoing along the length as he hurried up the polished wooden floor.  Late afternoon light filtered through the high, wide windows, catching the gilt edges of picture frames and old, well polished furniture.  Tony let his fingers trail across a table here and there, turning a vase away from the wall, straightening the lace cover on the red velvet settee.
He reached for his pen, and his fingers slid across the polished wood of his desk, the pen skittering out of reach.  Tony frowned, making another grab for it, and his fingers refused to cooperate, spasming as he tried to get a grip on the thin cylinder.
Tony peeked out from between his fingers to find Jarvis smiling at him, his expression benign.  “Shall I draw your bath, sir?” he asked.
“All the sparkle.”  She looked at the costume, now half tucked under Clint’s arm.  “Ooooh, that’s…  That’s ugly.”
“SHIELD strike team coming in from the East,” Clint said, his voice laconic.  “Traffic's a bear, but we should be able to sweep the ground before-”
“Again,  yes.  That’s what orphanages do, Obie,” Tony pointed out.  “They…  Find families for orphans.”  He rocked back in his chair, one foot bouncing against the floor in a rapid tattoo, and Furbro jumped off his lap with a swish of his tail.  “And while I might not be the sort of family the Board of Orphans of  New York had in mind, money does cover a great multitude of sins.”  He reached for his coffee cup.  It was almost empty.  He considered ringing for Jarvis, but it didn’t seem worth the effort.  “I make a healthy donation, they have one less orphan to worry about.  That is, in fact, how these things go.”
DJ nodded, and Peter leaned up against the workbench.  “Aunt May helped,” he explained, as DJ offered the plate to everyone.  “With measuring and that sorta stuff.”
“He didn’t take a car,” Pepper said.  “Happy didn’t even know he was gone until I told him.”  Her lips were set in a tight line.  “He just walked out the front gate, and-”  She shook her head.
“A cursory scan shows it is unstable on the molecular level,” Jarvis said.  “I would strongly suggest that you not attempt to consume it.”  He paused.  “Or jostle it.”
Steve ducked his head down, focusing on his cufflinks, and trying to get his heartbeat back under control.  "Luckily, that's not something I have to worry about," he said.
"Tried," Tony said, as Steve wrestled the passenger side door open.  "You keep coming back.  Like..."  He glared in Peter's general direction.  "Like the cat."
The car pulled away from the curb, and Happy caught Steve’s eyes in the rearview mirror.  “We going to the police?”
Tony gave him a slight smile.  “Thank you, but no.”  He looked back towards the main staircase.  “Actually.  Yes.  Can you go up to the Mezzanine and find us an area, near the front, that’s unoccupied?  I’d like a little-” He wiggled a hand in mid-air.  “Breathing room.”
“A rich man that wants to look poor will change everything except his shoes and assume no one’ll notice.” Billy grinned.  “Shoes like that?  He had money, which is likely why Hammer was talking to him, after all.”
He checked on DJ first, opening the connecting door between their rooms as quietly as he could manage.  The room was still and warm, and the curtains had been drawn back at the windows, letting moonlight spill across the floor.  DJ was sound asleep, curled in a ball against the headboard, his legs drawn up against his chest, one arm wrapped tight around his pillow.  His other hand was stretched out across the bed, his fingertips just brushing up against Furbro, sleeping in a furry pile next to his pillow. DJ didn't stir, even when the hinges of the door creaked, but the cat's head came up, one ear twitching.
His phone buzzed in his jacket pocket, and Steve glanced up at the commercial countdown as he reached for it. Next to him, Victor was sipping from his water glass. “Well, that was a hell of a thing,” he said, and Steve gave him a lopsided smile.
“Always,” he agreed.  Steve reached out, his fingers gentle as he brushed DJ’s hair back from his forehead.  “You know we’ll support you, no matter what you want to do, right?”
Tony’s head rolled to the side, and DJ was there, his face pale.  Happy was holding him, singing a soft, rough Irish lullaby, his hand cupping the side of DJ's head.  Tony tried to focus, tried to think.
Tony scopped DJ out of his seat, heaving him up into his arms.  DJ twisted in his grip, his body a live wire of panic, and Tony just concentrated on holding onto him as he slipped down the row to the aisle.  Steve was on his feet, his face tight, and Tony shook his head.  “Stay here,” he said.
“The audience exists because the theater owner wants to make money,” Tony pointed out. “And packing 'em into the seats is the best way to do that.” He shook his head. “The movie doesn't care if you smile, Officer Rogers. The actors have long since gone on with their day, and the celluloid doesn't care if it's playing to a packed house or a single person.” He arched an eyebrow. “And I prefer the single person.”
Steve exhaled, slow and light, but he never even moved.  Somehow, that hurt too.  That he didn't even notice that Tony had left.  That he was gone.
Steve wasn't sure how he did it, but somehow, Tony found the center of the chaos, an array of tables and small booths where people in matching shirts were handing out bottles of water, packages of prophelactics, and multicolored domino masks.  Tony slipped through a pack of older ladies in matching red hats, tugging Steve along with him.
Tony raised his hand.  “Please save all questions to the end of the presentation,” Jan said, her voice chipper.
The song and dance before the movie was enough to enthrall the boys within a matter of minutes.  Tony, for his part, had more fun watching them than the chorus girls.  Next to him, DJ bounced in his seat, his hands braced on the edge of the cushion.  Every so often, Tony bumped his foot against DJ’s, and DJ would bump back, even if his eyes never left the stage.
Hulk huffed out a breath, and settled down on the floor in front of DJ.  "No."  The word rumbled through him, quick and impatient.  He reached out, his big hand hovering over DJ's head.  "Okay?"
“Yeah.  This is the best Christmas present ever,” Clint said.  He shook the quilt out, his fingers tracing over the different t-shirts that had been used to make it.  He smiled at DJ.  “How did you-  Did you do this?”
“Been told as much by everyone from my Ma through to my Captain in slightly less polite terms,” Steve said. “Stubborn as a hungry hog half a foot from the trough is how my Ma phrased it.”
But if he closed his eyes, and ignored that nagging voice in the back of his head, he could pretend it was.  For just a minute.  Two, at most.
It took a few tries, but finally the flames were licking across the surface of the wood, and Tony settled down on the carpet before he reached for another log.
“Since I found a guy who would answer the question 'is the weird American plane still here?' if I gave him fifty bucks.”
Tony sighed.  “Not really,” he admitted, his eyes half hidden behind the dark sweep of his lashes.  “You’ve drawn everyone in the household except me.”
"With what, exactly?"  Val tugged the scrunchie out of her hair and slid it around her wrist as she attempted to corral her hair into a bun again.  "You've been lying on your back on the floor eating Pringles straight out of the can all afternoon."
Steve shook his head as he poured boiling water into the teapot.  “Because you live with a pack of jackals?” he offered.
Steve propped his hands on his hips, trying not to laugh, as the boys swerved back and forth across the grand hall, leaving a wobbly, uneven streak of wet stone behind them.  Their peels of laughter drowned out the pounding of their feet, and after several minutes of tearing in circles, they stumbled to a stop. DJ flopped onto the floor, Peter collapsing next to him.
“I do like to keep track of your failures,” he said, just to hear Steve laugh.  “They’re so few and far between.”
"Mostly they seemed drunk." Steve reached up, his fingers catching on the hand towel that was thrown over one of Tony's shoulders.  "Drunk and confused."
He rinsed out the coffee pot, doing his best not to look at his latest bad decision.  It was hard.  The vase was sitting right next to the sink, a massive arrangement of red and white roses surrounded by holly leaves.  It had seemed like such a good idea when he’d ordered it, but a lot of bad ideas seemed like good ideas at two am on a sleepless night.
Tony tried to ignore the warmth that swept over him.  “I think you're projecting, Jay,” he said.  He pointed up towards the ceiling.  “You're the only one fussing around here.”
Carol sighed.  “I’m not asking him to buy you a present, Jess.  In that you’re not five, and he’s not your father on a business trip.”
“He’s not.  He’s just-  He’s very convenient to blame things on,” Tony pointed out.  “So I don’t like him.  He just had a purpose.  Scapegoat.”
Steve reared up, cupping a hand on the back of Tony’s neck.  “Stay here,” he said, his voice tight.  “Let me find out who’s after you.”
“Stane’s down in the subbasement, with Bruce keeping an eye on him, and our firebug’s tied up in one of the work sheds,” Clint said.  “Bobbi seems to think she can get him to talk.”
Steve nodded.  “Don't know who'd be laughing more at the idea of me trying to handle a teenager,” he said.  “My ma, or Bucky.”
“Mi casa es su casa,” Tony said.  He collected Bruce’s notes before they could end up covered in glitter or sugar.  He flipped through the stack, trying to put them into something approaching an order.
Shuri made a face.  “Actually, we don’t.  Race me?” she asked, wheeling her horse in a quick, tight circle.  Her braids swung behind her in a cresting wave, the silver beads on the ends catching the sunlight.  “The road is straight enough, and-”
There was a flash of light, and a crash of noise, people and voices, and DJ’s heartbeat spiked, stress making him dizzy for a second. He rocked forward, his hands over his ears, trying to fight back against the wave of anxiety.
“No,” Okoye said as she passed, her back ramrod straight, her shoulders squared.  Her horse looked neither left or right as she passed, just as uninterested in the rest of the world as her rider was.
“This is against my better judgment,” Tony said, but he braced a hand on the table, lowering himself down into the chair.  He made a sound that was rather obscene, and Steve grinned at him.  “Shut up.  I'm old.”
Rhodes gestured in Steve's direction, his attention still fixated on the open hood of the car.  “Officer Steve Rogers.  NYPD.”
DJ ran past again, showing no signs of slowing down, and Steve made a grab for him.  DJ ducked under his hand, still laughing, and Tony took off in the other direction.  “Quit playing around, Rogers,” he said, running full tilt along the hall.  He circled the length of the hall, keeping half of his attention on Steve as he moved, his feet flying over the carpet.
Tony stopped.  “You.  Are a chef.  And, like, I get it, you trained hard, you’ve got the fancy degrees and the title and the profiles in some in-flight magazine somewhere, but here’s the truth.  You’re a short order cook in a fancy fucking hat.  You feed people.  If you can’t do that, to the best of your ability, to the best of your creativity and knowledge and with all your skill, for every single person who sits down at your tables, then, really?”  He shook his head.  “You need to find another job.”
Tony winced.  “Right.  “In my defense-” he said, as the door at the top of the stairs flew open, cutting him off mid-word.
Billy jumped out of the way as Happy ran past, the boy’s head swinging around to follow him as he disappeared up the hall.  “What’s-” He looked at Steve, his face pale. “What’s going on?”
“At this point, fighting with you’s going to result in something getting broken, and I’m not interested in being blamed for it,” Steve said.  His fingers brushed against the small of Tony’s back, tangling with the wet fabric of his shirt.  “Or given a bill.”
Clint was carrying a plush unicorn under one arm, a sausage shaped tube of plush with a goofy face and four stubby little legs.  Harris had no idea where or when he’d acquired it.  And he wasn’t sure he wanted to ask.  “Do we even know what we’re looking for?”
“It is a gift, to a friend,” T’Challa said.  “One who I am sure will use it wisely.”  Steve’s head swung in his direction, and T’Challa smiled at him.  “And your reluctance to take it proves our point.”
Stark’s face relaxed, just a bit.  “Not my fault you apparently can’t figure out battery life.”  He braced an arm against the window, his fingers tapping against the doorframe.  “Or servos.”
Rhodes gave him a wave.  “Remember, if you get lost, all roads lead back to the fountain in the square.  Eventually.”
Fear could keep you alive, but it could also keep you trapped.  He supposed that really hadn't changed.  Maybe it never would.
Greer looked up at Carol.  “How long has it been since you’ve had a date?” Carol opened her mouth and Greer rocked forward on the bench, grinning.  “With a man?” she added.
"I do apologize, sir, but you've already waived your right to a say in the situation," Jarvis said.  "Do finish your breakfast.  And don't talk with your mouth full, it's uncouth.”
Steve took them off, flexing the hinges.  "Loaners," he said, and before Tony could breathe a sigh of relief, Steve put them back on.  Tony stared at him, resigned.  Steve smiled.  "Pick a number between zero and nine."
Tony knew the moment that Steve had spotted him.  In an instant, the tension went out of his frame, his shoulders relaxing, his brow smoothing out.  He ducked his head, speaking a few tense words to Billy, before cutting his way across the lobby.  Tony took a moment to watch him move, admiring the smooth grace with which he slipped through the crowd.  All that leashed strength and surprising grace was a thing of beauty, and for all he knew that the concern on Steve’s face was for DJ, he allowed himself a moment of fantasy, allowed himself to wonder what it would be like, to have Steve be looking for him.
“Bet I still ban it,” Tony said under his breath.  Steve squeezed his hand, and Tonu grumbled something under his breath, making Steve smile.
“Gotta say, as much as I’m usually up for the sexy varient,” Darcy said, her hands on her hips, “As the only ‘lady varient’ of this group, I’m not willing to be ‘sexy Tony Stark.’  I’m not wearing a miniskirt.  Someone else can take that bullet.”
In the silence that followed, he brushed flames away from his cape.  “Am I late?” he asked, his voice cheerful.
Her voice trailed away, and Tony nodded.  “But,” he agreed.  “I’ve placed a lot of trust in someone I barely know.”  He pushed his hair back.  “Haven’t I.”
He jolted, his hand going to his hip, grabbing for the gun that wasn’t there.  Mentally cursing himself, he spun on his heel, turning just in time to see
The kitchen was bigger than he expected, a big, open space lit by massive windows along two of the walls, with neat rows of cabinets beneath them providing storage.  Huge stoves covered another wall, modern looking ranges of polished metal and white enamel.  Down the center of the room, there was a massive island, the stone top polished to a mirror shine, reflecting the rows of copper pots hanging from the ceiling above it.  There were a few stools positioned at the counter, stacks of bowls arranged in early reach.
“Or, you know, Danvers is probably right about the mice,” Steve said.  He nudged Bucky another step back, but it was no longer an effort to separate him from Sam.  Steve let his arm drop, and crouched down, holding his hand out to the cat.  It sniffed delicately at his fingertips, and then rubbed the side of its face up against Steve’s hand.  “Besides.  It seems like a nice enough cat.”
“That information has nothing to do with you, Stark.  Get your digs in when you want to, but we have oversight, clearance, and control of the scene.  You are the ones who have chosen to interfere with-”
Steve gave him a look, but he no longer looked like he wanted to murder someone.  Tony took that as a positive.  “Right.  I guess that's better than someone asking me if I want to suck their dick.”
Harris dropped a chicken salad sandwich on her tray.  “Yeah, you did.”  As they passed the burger station, he grabbed two cups of fries.  She grinned at him. “What?” Harris asked.  “My new year’s revolution had nothing to do with food.”
“I think I have,” Shuri said, nodding.  She ticked off the words on her fingers.  “Conquest.  Knowledge.  Catapult.”  She gave a firm nod.  “It is foolproof.”
Obie’s smile went tight, but his voice was still quiet.  “You’ve always had difficulty being-”  He stopped.  “Practical about some things, Tony.  So many things have come so easily to you, so many things that you’ve managed to do, that no one else would’ve been capable of.  You are a singular, unique man, but there are some things, that perhaps…”  He sighed.  “Perhaps there are some things you’re just suited to be.”
DJ gave him a hopeful smile and a quick nod, and Tony pulled out his chair.  "Right.  This is my life now.  Wonderful."
“Or you could just order the stuff I've already marked off on the menu,” Steve pointed out.  “Or ask Jarvis what I ordered last time.”  He shrugged.  “You know.  Like you always do.”
“We're already late, Stark,” Steve called back over his shoulder.  “You can play with your friends later.”
Steve's arm clamped around Tony's waist with a speed and a force that Tony hadn't thought was possible.  In a second, he went from standing on his own to being pinned against Steve's chest, his feet barely on the ground.  "Hi," he whispered, amusement sweeping over him.  "What're we doing?"
Tony kicked his legs out in front of him, his shoulders braced against the wall.  “What was that all about?” he asked, gesturing at the old lady with his spoon.
Tony looked at her over the rim of his silver smoothie cup, his eyebrows arched.  After a long sip, he raised the cup in a mock salute.  “Smoothie.”
And just like that, Steve’s head was clear, all the confusion and infatuation and need washed away by a wave of rage.
Steve’s head snapped around, and Tony stared at him, his eyes wide.  “Right,” Steve said, as Tony turned on his heel, sprinting out of the office.  Steve spared Hammer and glance.  “Stay here,” he snapped.
Trip looked at the kid, who wasn’t looking at either of them.  His fingers were hovering over the wood of the chapel’s doorway, almost but not quite touching.  Her gaze swung back to the blonde, and she opened the bottom drawer on the desk.  “Look,” she said, her voice pitched low.  “You didn’t get this from me, but here.”  She pulled a card from the drawer and put it on the desk, printed side down.  She slid it across the desk with one fingertip.  “Call this number.  They do good work for people who need help with immegration and naturalization, they can provide a measure of protection until-”
“Suspect you're right,” Steve said. And he wasn't thinking about that. Instead, he looked back at the candy counter, where DJ, surrounded by the other boys from Hammer's, was considering the possibilities. Steve did a quick headcount, and came up short. “We're missing one.”
“Nothing is,” Okoye said.  “Like a boat with no rudder.  You end up where ever the tides take you.”  She shook her head, the tiniest flick of her chin.  “A king cannot follow an uncharted path.”
Steve heard the bedroom door open and waved a hand in Tony's direction.  “Have you seen this trash?” he asked, scowling down at the file in his hands.  “I swear, if they even try to move forward with this, I'm going to march down there myself and start knocking heads together, this is absolutely-”
Tony laughed, the sound muffled against Steve’s skin.  When he pulled back, his eyes were dancing.  “It all comes off, darling, that’s rather the point.”  One of his hands slipped free of Steve’s suspenders, falling to catch the waistband of his pants.  “I can demonstrate, if you’d like?”
“Know what?”  Steve nodded.  “That sounds good.”  His head dipped forward, and then came up, his smile shy.  “Thanks.”
“Riiiiiiiight,” Darcy said.  “Can you hold it together for another five minutes?  I can see your building from here, and I’m still a bit concerned that-”
“No, you weren’t, because you’re too smart for that,  I can hear you start, and catch yourself, and it’s-  It’s-” Tony rotated his shoulders, rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet, all leashed tension and strain, pulsing along the length of his frame.  “I know.  We do what we have to do, to keep our heads somewhere useful, somewhere…”
Steve caught a glimpse of his reflection in the window and wondered when he’d stopped recognizing his own face.  He was numb to it now, to the split second of confusion, when he met his own eyes in the mirror.  Like someone else had taken over his life.
“Ah, thank you, dear.”  Obie stood,crossing to the coat rack to reclaim his jacket.  He shrugged it on. “This discussion isn’t over, Tony.”
“I love how she asks AFTER she's already punched the elevator button,” Tony said.  He pushed away from the railing.  “Tell her I'm as decent as I'm likely to get, if she's knocking on my door at this hour of the morning.”
It took a moment, but Bruce nodded.  “Good work,” he said, scraping a hand over his face.  “What time is it?”
Steve shrugged.  “Sure, for an afternoon, but this place would require a lot of childproofing before that happened.  I mean, the stairs alone.”  He headed back to the kitchen.
The gravel crunched behind him, and Steve sighed.  “Right.  You were stalling.”  Natasha held up a hand, her finger and thumb a bare inch apart, and he tried not to smile.  “Right.”
“No idea,” Harris said, because DJ was already at the table, rocking his weight on the balls of his feet.
He leaned over, kissing her hair, her temple. “Maybe more than a little.” He let his cheek rest on her hair, looking out over the city. “Thanks.” He exhaled. “For staying.”
Steve didn’t look up.  “Is that so?” he asked, and Tony could hear the smile in his voice.  “I’m going to have to ask to see your ticket, then.”
“Because you or my mother fed it to me.”  Tony shot a glare in Jarvis's direction.  "What am I supposed to do with him?" he asked, his voice pitched low.  "I don't know a thing about children."
"I want to pick my entertainment, without a random element that results in me watching a weird, badly dubbed Japanese anime that Peter and Clint are watching for mockery purposes," Tony said.  "Or they say they're watching it for mockery purposes, but hey, they're still watching it, and the mockery has since died down and-"
“Of course I will,” Jarvis said.  “And as the one who collects the post every day, it would also be my pleasure to make sure your letters reach him.”
“Not with your hands shaking the way they are,” Mrs. Arbogast said.  “We’ve had enough broken plates for one night, thank you.”  She flapped her apron in Tony’s direction.  “Go.  Sit down.  Pepper, there’s some tea in the pot, pour me a cup and fill one for Tony while you’re at it.”
“Look, they can't all be gems,” Sam said.  He picked up Steve's water cup and took a sip from the straw.  “So.  What'd he get you?”
This was a bad idea.  He knew it was.  But Tony was grinning at him, his eyes bright, his cheeks flushed, and Steve had always liked a good, honest protest. "Fine," he said, and when Tony let go of his sleeve, moving away, Steve made a grab for him.  "Oh, no.  You're not losing me in this."
He glanced up at the ceiling, at the crisp, clean lines of the room and the walls.  “And sometimes, everything on the surface looks fine.  There’s no way to know if a tiny little part, buried deep down inside, is what’s causing the problem.  Or if there’s two, three, ten gears that are misaligned.  You can’t just assume you know why something’s not working.  Even if you fixed a problem yesterday, and it seems like this is the same problem, you can’t-”  He waved a hand through the air.  “You can’t assume.  So we do a diagnostic.
“Really?  We're okay with this now?” he asked, still tailing behind the damn thing, his weapons systems locked and live.  He considered taking a shot at a knee joint, or maybe a hip, but something this big, there was no way of knowing which way it would fall.  And behind the windows of every building they were passing, he could see the faces, staring at him with huge eyes, clutching cell phones, clutching each other.
She stared at him.  “I want that,” she said at last.  She sounded a little drunk, but people often sounded a little drunk when Steve was describing food to them.
“Also a cookie!” Steve said, grinning at him.  “I think that officially makes it the best Christmas.”  He set the card aside and held out his hands.  “Can I have a hug, please?”
“You don’t have to,” Steve said.  He glanced down at himself.  He’d shed his jacket hours ago, and his shirt was looking a bit worse for the wear, his sleeves rolled up above the elbows.  “Sorry.  I’m not really dressed for this.”
“Mostly,” Bruce said.  “I don't know, it's not-  It's not anything I've seen before, what is it trying to find-”
Tony’s lips twitched.  “Well, it’s definitely a book you’ve been sketching in,” he said, turning another page.  “I found it under the shirt.”  His head tipped to the side as he considered the  cover of the book.  “Though it seems a lot like the ones I use, too.”
“It’s a convention churro,” the girl said, tugging on Clint’s sleeve.  “It’s…  It’s gonna be bad.  All the food here is bad.  And over priced.”
Getting into a battle of wits with this man was not a good idea.  He wasn’t going to win.  He might not even survive.  But he was so aroused that it hurt, and somehow, that just seemed right.  “Stay with me tonight,” he whispered.  “And you can ask whatever questions you want.”
“Aren’t you going to ask where he found me?” Mrs. Parker asked.  Steve’s head snapped up, and he found her smiling at him, the knife held easily in one hand.
“I'm implying that I'm pretty sure that you're a skrull, and I'm also implying that I'm probably okay with that if you don't leave your dirty socks in the middle of the bathroom floor again,” Tony said.  He took a step back, and Steve caught his hand.
“Sure,” Tony said.  His head rolled to the side, studying the pile of books on the table next to him.  “Let's see.  History of New York.  History of Brooklyn.  History of the Brooklyn Dodgers.  Bread cookbook.  Another bread cookbook.  Pastry cookbook.”
"This doesn't go away," Tony said.  "This goes in your Smithsonian exhibit.  This changes how historians view your relationship with the Commandos.  With Barnes."  He stopped.  "With Peggy."
Everyone froze.  Harris looked at Tony.  His mouth was hanging open, his eyes huge.  “This-” His eyes flicked towards Darcy.  “This seems like-”  She was already shaking her head, her teeth digging into her lower lip.  Harris leaned back against the wall.  “Right.”
“Or really, really doesn't,” O'Brien agreed.  He nodded at the file folder.  “Miss Potts has requested any updates on the situation that we might be able to provide her.  Take that along with you, and Rogers?”
“I will let you know if there is any news,” she said.  “Because I hear from him constantly.”  Her head tipped to the side, her hair curling against her neck.  “In that way, you remind me of him.”  Tony arched an eyebrow at her, and she smiled.  “He, too, assures me that he’s much more suave than evidence would suggest.”
Furbro wound his way around Steve’s ankles, then headed across the room.  He stopped in front of the closet, rearing up to paw at the door.  He looked back at Steve.  “Deej?”  Steve tapped on the door.  “Can I open this?”
“Okay,” Tony said, as he was force marched back into the chapel, “so thinking that we could actually sneak out the back without Coulson having anticipated that exact move and setting up countermeasures for it?   That was pretty optimistic on our parts.”
The boy stared at her, big dark eyes curious under the tumbled mop of dark curls.  He was barefoot, his shoes tied together by the laces and thrown over his shoulder.  The ragged cuffs of his too-short pants ending well above his bony ankles, his shirt was torn at the hem.  His fingers, dark with dirt, clung to the ragged wood of windowframe, and as she watched, he swayed back and forth, finding his balance against the side of the building.  But his gaze never broke from hers, his dark eyes unblinking as he studied her, as if confused by her presence.
"I ate an egg, what more do you want from me?" Tony muttered into his cup.  "For me, that's far better than average.  I'm awake.  I've consumed actual food.  I'm having a conversation with the child.  I haven't screamed or kicked the cat."
“Sorry,” Clint said, as the girl adjusted the piece of armor on his shoulder.  “I’m hard on clothes.”
“Goats,” Shuri agreed.  “But my brother finds one of the guards, and asks him, what has happened.  Why has the stranger not left?  And we are told, ‘he wants to repay his debt.’”
“Yes, we work for a paramilitary government organization,” Darcy said, her voice tight.  “Look at me.”
Rhodey raised his head.  Tony noted, with a certain vicious satisfaction, that he looked slightly grey, his eyes bloodshot and his cheek bruised.  “Your kitchen.” Rhodey sounded like he was having trouble forming words.  “It’s to the left.  Where it always is.”
Steve resisted the urge to just watch him walk away.  It was harder than it should’ve been.  Instead, he turned his attention to Greer. “What can I do for you?” he asked, folding his party assignment and tucking the pages into his pocket.
Jan waited, hands on her hips, as everyone subsided, shuffling their chairs back into place, turning to face her.  “How do you do that?”
“We need to update the furniture in here, don't we?” he said, spinning DJ's desk chair with an idle hand.  “You're getting too old for this stuff.”
“Not a bad idea,” Happy said.  “It’s not much of a distraction, but even he has a problem yelling and drinking at the same time.”
"The point is, after all these years of clearly being muscle and murder for hire, working for mobsters and strike breakers, you're saying he's suddenly seen the light and has dedicated himself to the communist party?" Steve asked.
Tony gave his head a brisk shake, trying to get some blood back into it.  “Watch and learn,” he said, and if his voice sounded husky and a bit raw on the edges, well, he could chalk that up to the late hour and the sheer amount of coffee he'd drunk.  But his hands were steady as he started making adjustments, his fingers flying over the mechanism, putting things to right with a speed that impressed even him.
Marcy's lips twitched.  “Good. That makes things a lot easier.”  She took a deep breath, her shoulders rising beneath the sleek, well-tailored fabric of her suitjacket.  “I'm here because this will affect StarkIndustries.  This is absolutely something that needs the intervention of a PR team, because if we don't want this to blow up in everyone's face, then we're going to need to start spinning it, and we need to do it now.”
“Getting into your work is a sign of an advanced mind,” Jan said.  She took the plate of cookies from DJ, handing them to Bruce.  “Here, Bruce, have a cookie, it’ll be good for your nerves.”
“We need YOUR Doctor Strange,” he said, excitement rolling through him.  “Mine.  He’s working.  But two’s better than one.  We need to find yours.”
Across the great hall, Peter was chasing DJ with a mop, his face flushed, his hair bouncing against his forehead with every lunging step.  His laughter was bright and loud as he swiped at DJ’s feet with the threads of the mop.  DJ scrambled ahead of him, hopping from foot to foot, making a cheerful moving target.
Sue stared at him, then down at DJ.  DJ threw up his hands with a broad grin.  "Magic!" he crowed, with so much enthusiasm that it startled a laugh out of her.  She clapped a hand over her mouth, but he seemed pleased with the reaction.
Tony nodded back.  “I’m holding you to that,” he said, his voice dire, and then Strange was gone, winking out of existence so quickly that Tony didn’t know if he had even heard the end of that sentence.
"Listen, have you met him?" he asked. "No. Seriously." He looked at the assembled group. "Has everyone met him?" He shook his head. "He's very intimidating. If we're out in public for more than five minutes, someone's professing their love for him.”
Steve froze in the doorway, his hand still holding the doorknob.  Tony froze, Jan plastered against his front, her lips mere inches from his.  There was a moment of stillness.  Steve’s eyes darted from Tony to Jan and back, a faint crease between his brows.  “Am I…  Interrupting?” he said at last.
When he returned to his apartment, the chairs were back at the table, the stove throwing a low, warm glow over the darkened interior.  Steve pulled the door shut behind him.  "I'm assuming I'll be able to 'find' you again in the morning, right?"
DJ nodded.  “Yes.”  But he slipped the gauntlet on, holding his hand out in front of him.  The skeletal frame of metal felt familiar against his skin, the weight steadying, calming.  He sucked in a breath, and flexed his fingers.
“Of course he didn't leave,” Tony said, and Rogers gave him a look.  “The doors are locked at night.”
Luckily, Val was used to him by now.  "Yes," she said, her chin tipped up.  "We did.  You and me.  WE did work."  She kicked one leg out, her foot swinging in a slow, easy arc.  "He didn't.  Because he is useless."
Steve shifted his weight, the chair creaking under him.  “No. Thank you, but-” He looked across the pool to where DJ was sitting on the stairs, tracing the patterns on the tiles with his feet.  Nearby, Pepper swam back and forth, following an easy arc within easy reach of DJ should something happen. Not that Steve thought anything would; the kid could swim.
He wanted to ask why, but her eyes were shuttered now, blank and empty, her smile a polite mask, and instead, he asked, “What do you make?”
Steve kissed his temple, his cheekbone, his lips tickling Tony's skin.  “I found a corner and watched you mingle, feeling pathetic and trying to remind myself I didn't stand a chance.”
“Oh, you warned them, did you?” Steve asked her, his lips twitching, as he snagged a jug of beer from the shelf.
Steve kept the smile on his face as DJ nodded, slipping into the chapel with Darcy.  He kept the smile on his face when he turned to Tony.  He kept the smile on his face when he said, “What’s wrong?”
“Want to,” DJ said.  Steve nodded, but DJ wished he’d stop smiling like that.  DJ took a deep breath and tried again. “I want to.”  Steve didn’t look convinced.  “Wanda said I can learn a magical girl transformation.”
The words 'I love you' hung so heavy in his mouth that he could almost feel them, and he gritted his teeth, desperate to keep them from being spoken.  Steve's hand in his centered him, anchored him, and he fixed his face in a smile as the reporters focused their attention on the street.
“What-” Steve started, but Tony’s mouth was on his, and this kiss was not cautious, was not tentative.  Tony just pulled Steve close and kissed him, and Steve felt the ground fall out from under his feet.
Fury glanced at him, but it was Logan who answered.  “They were going for a baseline,” he said, one finger flicking against his bicep.  “Wanted to see who'd end up on their side.
Ellen recoiled in her seat. "You didn't tell him?" she asked, so appaled that Steve started to laugh.
Pepper looked at Tony, her lips pursed.  “In my defense,” he started, and she closed her ledger and held it up over her head like a bludgeon.  Laughing, Tony skipped back out of reach.  “In my defense,” he repeated, “I think they were all in a bad mood before I got there.”
She crossed her legs, her head tipped to the side as she considered that. “Because Hill wanted him here.”
Tony exhaled, and his mouth felt dry.  “Why do you let him?” he asked, and it came out with a hard edge of accusation.  Rogers looked up, his expression curious, and Tony rocked back and forth on his feet, the hard dirt road giving him no traction.  “He’s a child.  How can you-”  He stopped, swallowing the rest.
“Oh, do you think so?” he pulled the sweater out of the box, holding it up in front of him.  It fell against his chest like it was made for him.
“Yeah, no, you're useless like this,” Tony said, picking up a screwdriver.  He tapped DJ on the tip of his nose with it.  “Tiny and squishy and useless.”
“I bought my own Christmas present, and you have no idea what it is, so good luck with that,” she said, her voice sweet.  “Ten.  Minutes.”
Steve smiled.  "Well, I've been accused of many things, but smart and easy-going don't often make the list."  He looked at the boy, with his white lips and his red rimmed eyes.  "So.  Am I like you?"
Ellen managed to balance everything as she got into the elevator, and stabbed the button for her floor with her elbow. There were crumbs on her chest, and she brushed at them with the back of her wrist. Which might have helped, or might've just ground the grease into her shirt. She wasn't really sure.
Pepper straightened up.  “Wonderful,” she said, offering him a hand.  “Why don't you go back to your room and get your things?”  Her eyes slid up, meeting Hammer's.  “While the adults work things out.”
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis said, his voice calm.  “And yet, I shall be serving you a full meal.  I trust you to make the correct choice when presented with it.”
Ellen lowered her feet back to the floor, fumbling under her desk for her shoes without looking.  "No.  I don't-" She stood.  "We're still missing something."
Steve glanced over his shoulder.  There was an awful lot of clothing tossed around the room.  “I always end up wearing the wrong clothes to these things, Sam.”  He shoved a pair of pants aside and took a seat on the edge of the bed.  “I’ve got a talent for it.”
Fury nodded.  “Sorry,” he said to Logan, with a wry twist to his mouth.  “Guess you wanted too much, too soon.”
"You might've had something to do with how this all worked out," Steve said.  Tony turned a stricken face in his direction, and Steve held up a hand, his index finger and thumb an inch or so apart.  "Tiny something to do with it."
Steve grinned, bright and happy.  "One."  He glanced up.  "Jarvis?"  He tossed the rest of the garlic knot into his mouth.
She looked up, her eyes catching Tony's.  She stood, holding a hand out to the boy.  “Mr. Stark, may I introduce DJ.  He'll be staying with us for the next week."
Jan let go of his hand, shuffling her feet across the plush carpeting.  “The walk in closet makes up for a lot,” she said, hands on her hips.  “And the bed.”  She threw herself on the bed, her legs kicking in the air.  She bounced a few times, gradually coming to a stop, her hands folded over her stomach.  “Steve?”
Sitwell leaned in, a tray of wrapped sandwiches and cups of soup balanced on one hip.  “Got you some real food,” he said, setting it on the table.  “If you want it.  Lewis, we need you downstairs, Dr. Foster is having a bit of a nervous reaction to the possibility of the ‘imminent collapse of the multiverse,’ and handling that is squarely in your job description.”
“It's oh-god-o'clock,” Tony pointed out, glancing out the front windows towards the street.  “How is-” He stopped, his attention caught by something far more interesting than the sleek black sedan idling at the curb.
He huffed out a deep sigh.  "Magic," he said, the word tinged with pained resignation.  "Fuck my life."
“Yeah, there was…  There was this guy there, someone who Thor knew, some big name from Europe,” Rhodey said.
Rhodey pushed away from the wall.  "I'm going to go make sure that the car isn't stripped for parts, Miss Potts," he said.  "Our escort, while pleasant, doesn't seem to have things under control down there."
Steve managed a smile.  “I know,”  he said.  He took the blown glass ornaments from Tony.  “It's just... Not what I was expecting.”
His hand hovered over Tony’s ribs, and Tony reached up, pressing Steve’s palm to his side.  “It’s fine,” he said, his voice soft.  “I won’t be a prisoner in my own house, Steve.”
“Small mercies.  I was expecting to find him climbing the shelves in the butler's pantry.”  The man was lanky and loose limbed, with broad shoulders and well muscled arms revealed by his rolled up sleeves.  His wheat blonde hair was cut short on the sides, and longer on top.  He peered at Steve with one blurry eye.  "Who's this?" he asked, his voice a slow, easy drawl.
She nodded against his shoulder. “I know.” She looked up at him, her eyes wet, her nose red. “I know.” She leaned her forehead against his chest, against the arc reactor. “I'm sorry,” she said.
The words were bitten off with cold intent, his teeth snapping against each other with each syllable.  Clea paused, her hands still holding the armor captive in midair.  Her head tipped to the side.  “On the floor?” she asked, and Tony lost it.
DJ gave the stairs a suspicious look.  “Is the house-”  He looked up, watching the ceiling flex.  “Okay?”
Steve loomed over him.  “And what if I think my place is above you?” he breathed, catching Tony’s shoulder and going down on one knee, pushing Tony onto his back.  Tony went with a grin, sprawling out on the carpet so Steve could straddle his hps.
He wasn't sure how much time passed as he worked, but by the time he was nearly done, blinking hurt.  He struggled to focus as he tried to brace the strut in place with the back of his wrist, fumbling across the workbench for a pair of pliers.  "Stay put, you damned-"
She set the bowl of peelings aside.  “Servants are always expected to be invisible.  Their work must be efficient, quick, silent and, and most importantly, invisible.  You must exist as a non-entity.  You must be there when needed, and disappear when you are not.  You are privy to everything that happens, and expected never to judge, never to speak, never to…”  Her words trailed away.  “In any case, I sat there, that night, looking at our savings, looking at what I could scrape together, if I sold everything we had.  What did we need, to live?  How much would I have to have, and how quickly could I get it?
“That’s an opinion not many people share,” Steve said.  Tony was rifling through the shelves next to the bath, and Steve gave him a suspicious look.  “What are you doing?”
Steve took a deep breath, and another.  “Wanna fuck?” he asked, and Tony’s hand was over his mouth before he even got the words out.
He rocked forward, and his knees went out from under him.  He could see the floor looming large in front of him, rushing up to meet him.  But Natasha got there before the floor did, her arm going across his chest, holding him upright.  He resented it.  And he resented it even more that he needed it.
