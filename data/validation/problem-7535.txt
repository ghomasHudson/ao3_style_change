He keeps a pace of a few people behind Tony so that he doesn’t arise suspicion. But he’s glad he decided to get closer because Tony Stark is one interesting character. He has a comment about every piece of art he passes, and even asks questions to the artist. The further along in the gallery they get, though, the quicker Steve realizes that eventually they are going to come to his work, and eventually Tony is going to have a comment about it. He is suddenly very nervous.
Steve feels Tony wrap his arms around him, still from behind. He presses backwards into the embrace, but they don’t talk for a long time.
Eventually, his hand starts to move across the canvas. His brain isn’t calling the shots, though, and instead the blood rushing south forces his hand to draw things. He draws Tony, naked, splayed out on the bed, just the way he was. He draws the other man’s cock, draws the muscles up his chest, draws the long scar over Tony’s heart.
The last few days were quite confusing for him. Tony had brought him food every day and they’d sat together, talking and laughing. They’d grown closer, they’d spent hours talking. Steve would work on the sculpture and Tony would watch him work. And then Steve had asked if he could trace Tony’s face with his hands, so he could sculpt the head better. Tony had agreed, and things had gotten weird pretty fast. They’d had a few chance brushes of their hands, a few accidental glances. And now here Tony was,
Steve smiles back, but the realization that Tony wants to be with him, despite what he was doing before they met, makes his forehead crease.
In the distance, all the way across the lab, Steve can see Tony lying on the floor, just in a black undershirt and the same pants from earlier, as he welds something in place. He slowly approaches, hoping he doesn’t startle the man while he’s at work.
a billionaire. You have that option.”
“No, Paul.”
After the ambulance left, Paul had walked across the street, seemingly unsure of himself, before heading down a small business strip and going inside a building, a bank. He’s stayed there for eight hours, and after, Tony watched him walk across the street to a BMW, get in, and drive away. He followed the car all the way until Paul made it past the last public street camera, and from there, he can’t be sure what happened.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, sounding earnest. “I didn’t say anything to anyone.”
It takes a few moments for his head to catch up because he’s been so busy with his thoughts, but eventually his feet start moving and he heads down to the parking garage where his car is. He’s got to get home, shower, and then head to Stark Tower. He’d said he’d be there after five, but it’s four now. It might be six before he can get all the way back to Brooklyn, turn around, and come straight back to the city.
“You okay?” he asks.
. But he doesn’t. Not even when they’re inside, shoes off, heading for the bed.
“Um, a friend I have at the bar. Phil.”
Steve nods slowly and takes another step back. His eyes go wide when Paul moves towards him and his instinct to run is only interrupted by Tony grasping his arm carefully.
“Yeah?” Steve says back, his mind still elsewhere. He’s pretending he’s with Tony, the smaller man cuddling into his chest. He could fall asleep with a thought like that.
“What is it?” Tony asks, sensing that whatever Steve has to say is important. He turns off the sink water and turns back to Steve, waiting for an answer.
“What time is it?” he groans.
The children from the hospital were laughing and having a good time, which made Steve smile. He followed behind their convoy and watched them point and question certain paintings or pieces of art. Some of the children were carrying IV poles with them, and for some reason, that hurt Steve’s chest a little. The poles didn’t seem to affect the kids at all, though, as if it were just another part of their day. They had accepted that being attached to something else was non-negotiable.
“Looks like my face,” he says. “Can I stand up now?”
“Re-heal-ly?” Tony says, tapping his fingers deviously.
He starts stripping out of the suit, not stopping until he’s naked. He hangs the suit carefully on a hanger and puts it by the front door to return to Adam tomorrow morning. He then heads towards the bathroom and runs a bath.
He slowly pushes the door open, stepping just one foot inside to take a look around. He’s shocked to see that his house has been trashed. His menial belongings have been torn apart, thrown across the room. Everything he has ever owned has been ripped from the cabinets and is strewn about on the floor.
“You’re beautiful, you know that?” Tony says quietly.
“I’m ready to go now,” Steve insists.
“I want you to.”
“Fuck, Paul,” Steve says, and it must urge Paul forward because he grips Steve in a death grip. Paul’s come stripes across Steve’s chest, some making it up to his neck. He tries not to grimace as he thinks about it, but it’s hard not to. Paul doesn’t notice though because he’s focused on getting Steve off. He alternates between squeezing and jerking him hard, so rough that Steve knows the bruises might last longer than usual.
“How do you know?”
Steve shakes his head. “What…happened?” he manages to ask. His throat is raw for some reason.
Steve just rolls his eyes, but he laughs. “I appreciate that. I’ll work up to the head, and lastly carve facial features. Right now I’m just working on getting the body carved out, and then I’ll put in detail after.”
“Did you call the police?”
Steve takes a sip of his cranberry juice. “Not sure this is a bar you want to be in,” Steve finally says.
“What should I do?”
Steve smiles a bit, but the worry doesn’t disappear completely from his face.
Steve just laughs. He’s glad that he’s in a place that he can laugh about someone paying a million dollars for something he created.
Tony’s eyes close again, and he’s asleep within minutes, but Steve can’t fall back asleep for a long time. He just stares at Tony, wondering how he ever got so lucky to just…
Saturday was Max, a closet gay who had inherited a massive dairy farm from his parents. They met Saturdays because Max’s wife and kids went out every weekend to the beach and he had the house to himself. Max was a little older, in his 50s, but Steve didn’t mind. The guy was nice enough and they’d stay cuddled up together for a while and talk about how Max could come out to his family, even though they both knew there was no intention of ever doing so.
“Aren’t I always on the menu?” Steve laughs back.
“I thought…telling the truth would make a difference,” Steve says. “But it doesn’t mean anything.”
He’s halfway to the grocery store before the events from yesterday even enter his mind, and he’s parked in a parking spot before the fear that he may be being watch creeps up on him. But he keeps his face level and his feet moving because he wants to get some supplies for breakfast so he can surprise Tony, and that suddenly seems more important than worrying about Paul following him. Because Tony’s right. What are the chances that Paul could break through the state-of-the-art security system that has kept so many other stalkers out?
Steve nods. “Shoulder hurts laying like that.”
“Hello?” he calls. “Mr. Stark?”
“Really?” he questions, not quite believing her.
Tony bites his lip for a second. “I think he was just trying to scare you,” he says after a moment. “He wanted you to know that he thinks he’s still in control.”
When he gets to the tower, the guard lets him in and valet meets him in the usual spot. But instead of wishing him a good day, the valet says, “Mr. Stark asked me to inform you that he won’t be home today. He also said ‘no paint’ and said you’d know what that means.”
The detective writes a few things down before looking up again. “Mr. Rogers, has Mr. Swanson ever injured you to the point of hospitalization?”
“How’re you doing?” Tony questions tiredly.
“You were in a car accident,” Tony says slowly. “You got hit pretty bad.”
Steve grins. “I know, I know.”
After a minute, Steve locates his pants and pulls his phone out of his pocket. He opens his text messages and sits on the end of the bed while he writes messages to each of his clients. Maybe it’s because he’s tired, or maybe it’s because he really wants to try this thing with Tony, but he needs to be free to
“Why are you looking at me like that?” Tony questions. “Something on my face?”
Steve nods, but slowly. Because the detective is telling him that there is nothing,
Steve digs in his pocket for his phone and starts typing out a message to Tony, but everything he writes just sounds terrible. He knows he should just call Tony, explain what happened, explain that the kiss was much desired. But he can’t. He doesn’t know where to start.
“I’ve found that I can’t function past three days,” Tony shrugs. “Sometimes I’m just so stuck in my head, you know,
“I don’t get to see it before it goes up?” Tony pries.
“Just old stuff,” Steve shrugs back.
They kiss like that for another few moments. Steve can feel Tony’s bulge growing hotter, and he takes his free hand to loosen the belt on his pants. Tony lifts his hips so his pants can slide down his legs and he kicks them off onto the floor. Steve touches Tony through his boxers, feather light touches at first, before gripping him and pumping a few times.
Steve sucks in a breath, but he eventually just shrugs. “I was scared for Tony,” he says. “I thought Paul might…get up and shoot him somehow.”
“No.”
Steve opens and closes his mouth several times, trying to find the words but not quite about to. He needs to tell Tony about Paul, about the threat that might be looming outside right now. He needs Tony to know that he could be in potential danger, that being his boyfriend might be more trouble than it’s worth.
Tony nods. “Thank god, but yes you’re okay. You’re banged up pretty good. Concussion, bruised sternum, your arm hit the window really hard but it’s not broken. They say you’re going to be okay.”
“Stay with me,” Tony begs him.
“Same thing happened to Randy when he cut the guy loose, if I remember correctly. Threatens went on for a couple days, but eventually the brute moved on.”
Steve shifts slightly so he can slide out from under Tony without waking him and then goes to the bathroom. He wipes the come off him with a wet cloth and then looks into the mirror for a few moments. He searches his eyes for answers, demands to know why his body betrayed him yet again, but instead, his eyes just stare back. His face doesn’t look angry. It looks…calm.
“Don’t,” Steve says back quickly, wondering how Tony even knows where he lives.
They start off towards the tower with random banter between them. Steve tries to ignore the strange feeling he has, the one where he thinks Tony is more nervous about this whole Paul situation than he is, but he can’t push it aside. Tony is being so protective that it’s almost annoying. Not that Steve doesn’t appreciate it, but it just makes him nervous. Because, how long will it be until Tony realizes that protecting Steve is harder than it’s worth?
A few moments later, Tony returns with a couple sodas and passes one to Steve. He wrinkles his nose at the news being played and holds out his hand for the remote.
Steve grins. “Not really,” he shrugs back. “I’m feeling a little like drawing today.”
Steve has to walk away from the hype because it makes him nervous again. He’s going to head for the front door, to his car, and run home, but something pulls his eyes back to the bar Tony said he’d be in. He doubts Tony is even in there anymore. It’s been nearly an hour. And even though his head is screaming at him to not go in there, but feet lead the way instead.
When he finally heads for the bed, his legs feel weak and his arms are sore from working earlier, but he feels blissful. He sets his alarm for eleven and then closes his eyes, falling asleep to more thoughts of Tony Stark.
“Hey hot stuff,” Tony says when Steve picks up.
He nods in response, sort of wishing he hadn’t asked. It wasn’t easy to forget that Tony could probably buy the entire city of New York and not even flinch when he looked at his bank account.
Steve puts his hands on either side of the check for a moment, threatening to tear it in half, but he stops. Tony’s right. He could just donate the remainder to charity. He doesn’t have to keep it, or benefit from it in any way.
“Fuck me now, Steve,” Ryan begs. “I’m ready.”
Steve agrees, and then they hang up. His fingers hover over the numbers on his screen for a moment before he decides to call Tony instead. He just wants to hear Tony’s voice, to make sure he’s okay.
“Miss you too,” Steve smiles back.
“You look great,” Steve compliments.
Steve doesn’t really know, or understand, what Tony is working on. Something technological and smart and needs big words to describe. He’s always so impressed when Tony goes off on a tangent about how his
“I drug you into my problems.”
A few moments later, someone pulls Steve of Paul and he wants to fight back, but he realizes that it’s Tony’s security. The room is suddenly full of guards and police. Steve sits on the floor, blood on his hand, until Tony comes over to him slowly and crouches down next to him.
Taking his art to the gallery isn’t too time consuming. It’s as simple as entering the front door and the curator noticing him before she sends a worker over to grab his piece for the show.
“I just can’t.”
“You’re…falling for me?”
does this, and the
“Not really.”
“Of course! Everyone was so impressed with your last piece, since it brought such a massive donation for the hospital.”
“Why not?”
The fear only returns when Tony pulls into his garage and Steve thinks he sees a shadow around the corner, or around every corner. Tony must notice that he’s acting strange because he takes his hand, kisses it, and leads him inside his highly secure tower.
Tony, however, isn’t able to sleep. When he’s sure Steve is out, he gets up and moves over to the lounge chair at the other end of the couch and opens up his laptop. He checks his email for any updates searching for the hit and run vehicle but there aren’t any, and even though that’s frustrating he wasn’t expecting any less. It’s been a week. The trail has gone cold.
Tony stares at him for a few moments, so long that it makes him uncomfortable and he has to shift on his feet.
“Really now?”
Steve hesitates for too long, so the man points to the stairs and then pulls away in Steve’s car.
Steve had been at the counter for almost two hours when he was approached yet again.
“I was busy.”
“I don’t know. Maybe confront him. Maybe beat him up.”
“Not really,” Steve says, “but it would be nice to have some supplies.”
, that I forget the world exists out there.”
Tony nods. “You’d still want to be with me if I was a garbage man?”
“Doctor will be here in a minute,” he says. “I looked at your charts, though. Nothing broken; they should be able to send you home.”
“So just block him?”
“I really don’t know,” he shrugs back. “Rich I guess.”
“Got busy thinking about other things,” Tony shrugs. “I’ll work on it tomorrow.”
But, over the last two weeks, there has been no sign of Paul. It’s been silent. Not even text messages or phone calls from the man. If Steve didn’t know better, he’d be relieved. He would love to think that Paul just moved on, but he just doesn’t know if it’s true. Steve thinks he may live on edge for the rest of his life, expecting Paul to cause havoc at the most inconvenient time possible.
. Steve is pretty sure it’ll be an utter failure, and in a few days they’ll grow tired of finding new ways to get each other off. But for now, it’s nice to pretend he’s a normal person. No clients, just art and Tony. What else could he ask for?
“Oh really? And how would you do that?”
He goes back into the room and watches Tony sleep for several minutes. He knows he should find his clothes, put them back on, and leave. But he doesn’t want to. He wants to stay here and wrap himself back up with Tony. He wants them to wake up together.
“Usually skip it,” he sends back. It’s not a lie. He can’t remember the last time he got up early enough to eat breakfast anyway.
“I made a report about the break in,” he says. “But I didn’t tell them it was Paul.”
When Steve makes it to his door, he sighs in relief when he finds it locked, just like he’d left it the last time he was there. He flips on the light switch by the door and then moves cautiously through the house. Just because the door is locked now, doesn’t mean Paul didn’t lock himself inside.
Steve blushes a little, but he shakes his head. “I just…am worried that you don’t know enough about me, about the things I’ve done.”
At least, he’s trying not to.
“I’m sure,” Steve insists.
When he can finally stand to look at himself again, he gets out of the shower and dries off. It only takes a few minutes, but he dresses and collects his belongings before exiting the motel room. He walks a few blocks over where he parked his car and gets in, just sitting behind the steering wheel for several moments before starting it and driving towards home.
Steve knows it’s a bad idea. He knows that this is just going to hurt worse than if he just said no, if he just could leave right now. But even as he thinks it, his mouth says, “Just tonight?”
“I’m sorry you went through that,” Tony finally says, breaking the silence.
At some point, his hands start to hurt and he puts down the carving tool he’s been using to stretch his hands a bit. He takes a step back to look at his work, deciding that this is a good stopping point. If he doesn’t stop now, he’s going to start up the chest area and he won’t be able to finish that in a couple hours. There is too much detail that needs to be planned out. An all-day task for tomorrow.
, anyway.
“Who hurt you?”
“That was great,” Paul says, dropping the payment onto the dresser by the door. “I’ll see you next week, Cap.”
“Yes.”
His arms are sore from holding the saw up for so long. He puts it down and moves around the slab, carefully looking for anything he might have missed. He runs his hands along the wood, his memory going back to when he did this to Tony, feeling the way his body moved and how his muscles rippled under his touch.
“We’re too old to have boyfriends,” Steve sighs.
Tony sighs. “It was your money. It
“Are you aware that you fractured Mr. Swanson’s nose, as well as his jaw?”
He wipes the blood off his chest from the nipple and doesn’t bother putting another shirt on. He goes into his room, drops onto the bed, and closes his eyes. He can’t stand to roll onto his side, so he lays flat on his back and just breathes.
“Steve,” Tony murmurs. “Are you alright?”
“If you’re going to cut me out, then just cut me out and leave it at that!” Tony says. “Don’t dig into this wound like it’s nothing to you.”
He goes back to his canvas and turns it around to face the wall. He doesn’t want to look at it, especially not right now.
“And what are we going to do what I come back over?”
to leave. Either he’s actually worried that there are real threats in the world, or he is turning into a homebody. Either way, Steve has to prove that they can go outside together without worrying that danger is lurking around every corner.
Steve shrugs. “I guess,” he says slowly, “when I was a kid I was alone a lot, so I had to learn to take care of myself.”
“Good for you kid. I hope it works out.”
Steve’s breath is coming out too shallow. He is having trouble keeping his head on straight, having trouble hiding the way his body is clearly betraying him.
floor, Tony goes to the bedroom to change into his pajamas. Steve starts slowly undressing, laying the suit on the bed one piece at a time until he’s just standing there in his underwear. He jumps when Tony’s hands wrap around him from behind.
“You don’t?”
“Then you promise me that if I ever become too much, you’ll tell me, too.”
“What is this, Tony?” he demands, not realizing that he’s yelling until his words come out. “Did you send me this out of pity? Because you want to take care of me?” he demands.
“Sure, what’s going on?”
He closes his eyes, knowing Tony is watching him curiously, and moves his hands from Tony’s sides up to his shoulders. He takes mental notes about how it feels, how the skin curves along muscles, how Tony’s breath sucks in when he reaches a sensitive place on his skin.
“It’s been three hours.”
What he doesn’t like is that today is Monday, or Paul Day, as he calls it. He almost hopes that Paul will cancel last minute, that something will come up. But right on time, at 3pm, Paul texts him a location to meet and Steve sighs before he puts his shoes on and leaves the house.
Tony eyes him, and for some reason, Steve finds the courage to eye him back. They stand like that for an uncomfortable amount of time, so long that other people start to notice how strange it is.
“It’s okay,” Steve nods. “I’m glad you’re here now.”
is talking to him. His mind goes blank for a moment, so he just nods.
“Because I wish the day had been like this for the little girl, instead of a sad day.”
Steve grunts a little when he cums. Long white lines streak across his belly and he’s glad he did this while still in the bath so he could wash himself clean again.
“Sorry,” Tony murmurs, kissing the back of Steve’s neck and then lets go of him.
The ride to the police station doesn’t take nearly long enough, and by the time they pull up, Steve’s stomach is in knots again. He’s not sure why he’s so afraid. He simply has to say what happened and then he can go on with his life, but the whole thing has him terrified.
Steve moves slowly, watching the gun as he moves towards Tony. When he reaches him, Steve touches his hand, which is perched on the bar in plain view. Obviously Paul must have told him to stay visible, so Steve puts his hands on the counter as well.
In response, Steve leans his head back so he can kiss Tony. It’s a little awkward, but Tony smiles into it anyway.
“How’d you have it delivered so quickly?” he asks.
Tony!” Steve groans back. “I could have…stopped him. I could have…”
“How are you going to do that?”
“I might stop by to see it,” Tony responds, and then he’s gone. Just walks away, end of conversation.
“Want another beer?” Ryan asks, and Steve nods.
“You eat dinner yet?” Tony asks.
On his way back up to his apartment, he stops at the mailbox and grabs his mail. Most of it’s junk mail, but there is one interesting piece from the art gallery where he’d met Tony a few weeks ago. He bites his lip as he climbs the stairs to his apartment, staring at the white envelope for a while.
It seems to take hours, but finally they meander their way to the very last row of works and Steve feels like he’s going to be sick. Tony stops and stares at a few pieces, but he goes on until he’s reached Steve’s. He stares at it for a long time, just like the children did. He reaches out and touches the name plate with his fingers, and Steve can’t tell but it looks like he recognizes the name from when they met earlier.
Steve can feel Tony’s beard scraping against his skin, he can feel Tony’s warmth. He can feel a slight bulge in Tony’s pants from how they’re pressed together.
Tony moves around the room, playing with things on the shelf or opening random drawers. Steve watches him carefully, looking for any sign that he is less than impressed. But he doesn’t see that. Instead, Tony seems fascinated by the apartment.
“My parents died when I was in college anyway,” Tony says. “I sometimes wonder if I’d have been happier with them around. Let my dad run the company. Go off and do my own thing.”
Tony looks with him, seemingly unphased by the rips. “You are very talented,” he compliments.
“Rogers, what’s going on?” Phil answers. “Are you okay? You never call me this early.”
floor, and into the bathroom. Tony starts the bath water and then tugs at the hem of Steve’s shirt, slowly lifting it until he can drop it onto the tile floor. He makes work of Steve’s pants, eventually getting them around his ankles so Steve can just step out of them.
Steve goes over to it, groaning when he sits, but then looks up expectantly.
Tony is finally ready to go, and they walk out of the gallery together. The valet brings the car around, and when they get in, Steve feels like the world has been lifted off his shoulders. For the brief ride back to Tony’s house, suddenly everything is okay again. It’s just the two of them and it feels good.
“Weather’s supposed to be nice today,” Ryan says eventually, which is the cue for “time for you to get out.”
They have small talk while finishing their lunch, and then Steve helps Tony clear the dishes. It only takes a few moments, but the domesticity of it all makes Steve shiver. He didn’t know that doing something so normal could feel so good, or that he’d secretly always wanted to wash dishes with his boyfriend.
“But you have an idea,” Steve questions. He wants Tony to say it. He wants Tony to admit that Paul is, in fact, a bigger threat than they thought possible.
Tony backs off for a second, jumping up to dig through his night stand until he finds the bottle of lube that has been left lonely in there for so long. He uncaps it and pours a good amount into his hand, slicking himself up and then going to sit between Steve’s legs again.
Tony looks a little shocked. “Babe, I can handle whatever you throw at me.”
“Lucas made a report about being attacked by Mr. Swanson, and said that we could speak with you about Mr. Swanson’s behavior to corroborate his story.”
hungry,” Steve says.
“I’m giving him until next Friday to finish, and if it’s not at my house by next Friday then I’m not coming back here, and I’m letting all my friends know whose fault this is!”
Steve nods, starts to get up, but turns back. “I don’t know your address.”
“I want you to have fun tonight,” Adam goes on. “You deserve the best.”
“Maybe this will be the one thing in the whole world that was meant to be easy for you.”
Tony moves forward so he can press his lips against Steve’s cheek. Just a quick, gentle kiss but he sighs into it anyway. “I could have,” Tony acknowledges. “But I didn’t. Because you saved me.”
“Anything I can help with?” Tony asks.
“How are you?” Steve asks.
Sighing gently, Steve reaches up with his free arm and traces Tony’s jaw lightly. He’s surprised when Tony’s eyes flutter open and, tiredly, looks back at Steve.
It takes him a few minutes to convince himself he’s ready, but finally, he pulls a shirt on and heads for the living room. He can do this. He can put on whatever face Tony needs to see.
“You should have gone to art school.”
Tony takes Steve’s hand and squeezes it reassuringly.
“God, Steve,” Tony grunts. “I’m going to come before it’s over if you don’t stop that.”
“Nah, just local artists. It’s a charity event for children I think.”
“What…what are you doing here?”
“Tell me you’re okay and mean it,” Tony says finally. His breath is on Steve’s cheek, so close he could probably just lean up a few inches and kiss him if he wanted to.
Steve nods, taking his hand and greeting the detective.
He marks off what needs to be cut and then goes to plug the saw in. He’s glad that he was given a long extension cord because the room is massive, and the sculpture is in the middle of the floor. He’s got enough slack in the cord to work with, so he turns it on and carefully, carefully slices off the top foot, and then maneuvers around the block to begin cutting from one side.
When Steve wakes up, he feels really warm. It’s so nice that his mind stays in a dream-like state for several seconds. It’s only when he realizes that the reason he feels warm is because Tony is still pressed up against him, snoozing away, that his eyes shoot open.
“Yesssss,” he says back, biting his lip.
Steve shrugs a bit. “I didn’t put it up, so I’m not sure where it is.”
” as he rides out his orgasm.
He takes another calming breath before opening the door and going to find Tony. He finds the other man in the kitchen, fiddling with he coffee maker.
“As wonderful as that sounds, at some point, we both have to get dressed.”
The doctor chuckles. “We just need some blood work, maybe a CT scan. Your concussion was pretty rough. You might feel some dizziness over the next few days. Headaches and temporary confusion are also common.”
Tony’s house is chilly, and when Steve makes it up to the 51
“You don’t want to be with me?” Tony asks. “You don’t want to at least
“I just want to know why, Steve,” Paul says. “Why did you leave me for
Steve is vaguely aware that he nods, but his legs follow Tony inside, up to the 51
He wanders into the living room and rubs the tiredness from his eyes. The dream he’d been having was such a good one that he wants to draw the scenery while it’s still fresh in his head.
Steve nods and heads to the spot they had agreed upon, the tiny space beside the bathroom wall that was just big enough to host his canvas. He was used to hanging his own art, so it didn’t even bother him when none of them workers offered to help. There wasn’t much help he needed anyway. Just stick the canvas on the wall and leave it at that.
Steve shrugs. What had he been doing that night? Probably nothing…sitting at home, staring at the invite, wondering what it meant.
“Both.”
“I’ve got everything I need, if you’re ready,” Steve says.
“You like that, Cap?” Paul says. “You like it when I’m rough with you?”
in his bed.
does this. It shows just how intelligent Tony really is, and it is almost intimidating.
Steve doesn’t want to state the obvious, that Paul hates his wife anyway, so he bites his tongue to prevent it from slipping out. Saying as much is probably a sure way to die faster.
Steve nods, and when they reach their floor he heads into the kitchen and opens the fridge. He’s surprised to see that it’s actually stocked better than it usually is, but for some reason he stands there just staring at the groceries until Tony comes up behind him and touches his hand.
“I just…don’t know how people will react to us,” Steve says carefully.
Steve grins. “I know exactly what you mean.”
Tony nods and offers to leave the room, closing the door behind himself. Tony doesn’t want to pry, but Steve’s sudden attitude change worries him.
Tony laughs a bit. “You’re quite confident, aren’t you?”
He opens the door slowly and tries not to meet Tony’s eyes. It only takes about ten seconds to reach the front door of the bar, but when he gets there, the night air is chilly. He walks to his car, ignoring the pain in his chest, and drives towards home. He doesn’t even realize he’s crying until a wet tear slides down his cheek.
They hang up, and Steve suddenly feels okay again. The fear that has crept into his chest is pushed down, even if just minutely.
“You’re doing so good,” Tony comments, feeling like he can step a few more inches away.
“Why not? The media’s going to figure out that having dinner with the same hot guy repeatedly probably means exactly what they want it to mean.”
Steve instead leans in and kisses Tony awake, but when he feels Tony start to deepen the kiss he pulls back.
“You sure? You sound a little down.”
He gets out of bed nonetheless and goes to put on a pot of coffee, glaring at himself when he realizes he never bought a new coffee pot and his was shattered into a million pieces. He then glares at the coffee jar, as if it’s the coffee’s fault he’s been enjoying Tony’s morning routine just a little too much.
“Something hurt?” Tony asks.
Tony holds Steve, too. He wraps his arms around him, and even though it’s hard because Steve is a lot taller than him, he manages to keep them both on their feet. Steve’s hands are clutched tightly at Tony’s side, holding onto his jacket. His face is buried in Tony’s neck, trying to keep tears from streaming down his face but it’s nearly impossible.
When he gets there he intends to take a quick shower, but it turns into thirty minutes when thoughts of touching Tony’s body runs through his head and he can’t ignore how painfully hard he is. He figures, what the hell, and lets his mind wander.
“Still hurts?”
“Okay.”
“This was real?” Tony questions.
“You know that guy?” he asks.
“I agree,” their chaperone says. “I like the happy picture better, too.”
Steve watches Tony as moves through the room, picking out a set of clean clothes and then he starts to gather his clothing. He doesn’t realize that Tony is watching him until he pulls his jeans up over his hips and turns around, and then they grin at each other.
“I can only work after 5pm most days,” Steve says. “And I’d need to work in a quiet environment, somewhere near to where the sculpture will be delivered, if possible.”
Steve puts the suit back on the hanger it came from and then stretches out on the bed. He’s exhausted from the mental stress of the day, and when Tony comes to lay down beside him, just pressing their bodies together, Steve sighs contently.
“Did Mr. Swanson ever harm you against your will?”
“I’m sorry, Steve. I don’t know why the law is the way it is.”
“I can picture you here,” Tony says finally. “Making dinner over there. Painting over there. Watching TV right here.”
“Is this one for charity, too?” Tony asks.
“Unless you think the naked sculpture is a better idea,” Tony says, and Steve’s eyes widen. What he wouldn’t give to draw Tony Stark naked and then carve his body into the wood, immortalizing him forever.
He’s just about to get out when he gets another message, and he looks at it as soon as he can dry his hand on a towel. “Good night. Get good sleep. Need my artist to be in tip top shape.”
and the doors slide open.
His art supplies are in the corner of the room, out of the way but still accessible, while his studio on one of the lower floors is being finished. He doesn’t need much, just a sketch pad, but it takes him a few seconds to dig through the pile of supplies until he finds the right pencil. He sits down on the couch and begins working, adding detail and shading until the sun peaks over the horizon.
“You busy?” Steve manages to ask.
They’re quiet for a moment before Tony says, “The sculpture was a big hit, by the way. Everyone really loved it.
“No.”
Steve swallows hard. “It’s, uh, for charity,” he finally says. “They’re going to auction it.”
“Okay,” Steve agrees.
“Have you ever tracked someone down like that before?”
“It was immediately after these messages were sent, and…,” he trails off again, looking over at Tony who nods reassuringly. “He wrote something on my mirror.”
Steve smiles and shakes his head.
Steve finally gets onto the elevator, and just as the doors are sliding shut Tony yells, “Call me when you get home!” Steve just grins all the way down to the lobby.
“Good morning,” Steve says, and Tony whips around, startled.
“You know, I think you can take the sling off now,” Tony says. “Might be easier to sleep.”
“This looks amazing,” Steve compliments. “Sure you didn’t have it delivered?”
“Breakfast is the most important meal of the day :,-( ,” he gets back in response.
“You didn’t ruin anything, Steve,” Tony insists.
“It’s a date,” Steve says, managing to not gag when he says it.
“Never too late to switch careers,” Steve says.
Steve just rolls his eyes. “That’s…,” but he trails off, because what can he say?
“Whatever you want,” Steve breathes back. He clenches his eyes shut when Paul’s hand grips him again, this time reaching down and painfully pulling at one of his balls.
“But I need a few more minutes of sleep. Just five. Five minutes.”
“I should just go,” Steve says.
Tony had shared his camera footage with the police, hoping they could just take it seriously, but they had said there was simply no evidence linking Paul to the accident. But just having Paul in the vicinity of the accident was enough to convince Tony. Actually, he had been convinced before seeing the man’s face on the cameras. He had gotten an alert on his phone about twenty minutes after Steve was admitted to the hospital, and within five minutes he was dressed and running to his car and on his way there. The whole time he was screaming at himself, “Why didn’t I take the threat more seriously?”
“Essentially that he was going to find me and kill me.”
The saw staring up kicks his mind back into work mode and he starts to carefully slice off pieces of wood. The whole thing takes him two hours. The lines are sharp and he is glad when he’s finally finished and he has a faceless body standing before him.
. Steve had been dreaming about it for a week now, but it was Tony who made the move. It was Tony who cornered by beside the table, Tony who touched him, Tony who kissed him.
He seems to like to watch Steve work. He will occasionally shift if he becomes uncomfortable sitting still for so long, but their eyes never meet. Steve is pretty sure that if they did, he wouldn’t be able to hide the burning in his stomach, the blood that is rushing south and threatening to expose him.
When Steve wakes up, he’s alone again. He’s beginning to expect it, so it doesn’t really phase him anymore.
Tony sits down and Steve takes a breath before sitting opposite him. He starts drawing instantly, making light lines as he sketches Tony’s jawline, his ears, even the way his hair just barely falls onto his forehead. It probably takes him half an hour to just sketch the outline, not filling in any facial features yet. The whole time, Tony is silent.
He and Ryan finally collapse against the bed, their breathing heavy.
They banter for a while, but eventually Adam settles on a moderately priced suit. Not too shabby, but any rich guy would know Steve wasn’t trying too hard. Adam makes Steve put it on and tailors it, putting in temporary pins that would last the night but were removeable upon return.
They get dressed and Tony makes a few half-hearted attempts to convince Steve to stay, but he’s also extremely curious about Steve’s apartment. He’s never been there before, and since Steve has plenty of clothes at the tower he hasn’t had to go home since before the accident. Tony wants to know what Steve’s house looks like, where he used to sit and sleep and eat food. He’s always been curious, but Steve never offered for him to come over before. And now, even though the timing makes him nervous, Tony is excited to be going to this mysterious Brooklyn apartment.
They finally hang up, and Steve just grins stupidly for a few moments before he grabs his pencil case and selects a shading pencil. He starts to add the final details, and slowly his mind flutters away from Tony and he is able to focus on what he’s doing.
After they chat for a long time, Ryan will offer Steve a drink, which he’ll accept, and then he’ll lead the way into the bedroom. They take each other’s clothes off, and Steve isn’t even shy about kissing Ryan. He lets the other man think this is a relationship, that they are together, even if it’s just for one day. Then they have sex, sometimes a few times, and then Ryan will go find his wallet and hand Steve his pay without breaking eye contact, chatting about the weather or something else nonsensical.
Steve stares, dumfounded, before nodding slowly. He doesn’t follow, though. Just watches until Tony disappears into the bar.
“We need to go give our statements at the station. Then this can be over.”
Tony nods, understanding. He knows that this is Steve’s first day off in a long time, so he doesn’t pester him anymore. “I’ll be back by lunch,” Tony says hopefully. “Will my man have me a sandwich made?”
will be safe from whatever mess Steve might have caused.
Tony just shakes his head, but he smiles gently. “Another time. Don’t you worry, we’ve got plenty of time for breakfast.”
“I know that you’re an amazing man, and an amazing artist, and if somebody had just told you that a long time ago, maybe you’d believe it too.”
A few seconds later he gets back, “Honestly, I usually skip it too.”
“Kids?”
“Has he threatened you since breaking into your apartment?” Tony asks. “Have you seen him around anywhere?”
“You need to step back,” Tony says. “This is a public place.”
A few times Tony has asked about why Steve doesn’t invite him to his apartment, and Steve just says he likes Tony’s place better. It’s not technically a lie, but he’s also afraid that Paul might see him bring Tony home. Or that Tony might ask why he doesn’t own any dishes. He just isn’t ready to have that conversation yet.
Steve pushes up a bit so he can rest his weight on one hand and reach between them to grasp Tony in his hand. He begins pumping him in tune with his thrusts, easy and slow.
“How about your project?” Steve asks. “Any progress?”
“There’s not enough for an investigation, unfortunately. There is nothing linking Paul Swanson to any of your injuries or the break-in or the car accident. Your text messages are a start, but still just words and no proof of action. All we can go on is that Lucas was injured, and he made a report. But it’s he said she said in this case. Do you see where I’m going with this, Mr. Rogers?”
Steve grins anyway, shaking his head, but he slowly gets out of the car. Even though his head is ready, his body is still protesting. He is having trouble getting his feet to cooperate. Tony must notice, because he comes around and takes Steve’s hand in his.
“I guess, I just thought he’d go away.”
“Nothing.”
“I’ll call you later,” he promises.
Friday is Michelle, and also his only female client. She has extreme social anxiety and was referred to him by his former Sunday client. They didn’t even have sex the first few times he visited her, just talked and got to know one another. For Michelle, it was easy to pretend Steve was her boyfriend who brought her groceries and helped her feel like a social being, even if she really wasn’t. And Steve didn’t mind the sex. He preferred men, but Michelle was so awkward and preferred complete darkness when they were together than he could pretend she was someone else.
When he hasn’t responded after several minutes, Tony sends another. “I’m not sorry for kissing you,” it reads, followed by, “But I am sorry if it made you uncomfortable.”
Steve shrugs, but he accepts the seat at the counter when Tony gestures for him to sit and then his mouth waters when a large sandwich is put in front of him. Tony sits across the bar, his own sandwich in his hands, waiting for Steve to take a bite.
“I’ll come see you tomorrow,” Steve promises, stepping up behind Tony and pressing a gentle kiss to the back of his neck.
He carefully packed the two drawings in brown paper and taped the ends. He then headed out to his car and put the package in the trunk and patted his pockets for his keys. Eventually he finds them and heads towards the suit rental place.
Tony grins a little. “You don’t want to draw my body right now?”
Tony laughs. “What do you want to make? I have spaghetti noodles. Or we could order in. Or…go out.”
“Don’t need a picture when I have the real thing,” he shrugs back.
He sends back, “I’ll shoot for 8, unless that’s too early for you.”
“I got carried away working on this,” Tony says, splaying his hand across the metal sheet. “I just couldn’t sleep knowing it was unfinished.”
“My fault?” he asks.
“I’m fine,” he says back quickly.
“I want to see you,” he says back, and Steve nods. He slides his jeans off and tosses them onto the floor. Suddenly they’re both sitting there in just their underwear and this thing they’re doing is actually happening.
Steve eventually leaves him alone in the bedroom while he goes to put some of his art supplies in a bag to take back to the tower. He’s flipping through his canvases, the ones with holes and rips, when Tony comes up behind him and hugs his shoulders.
Tony manages to usher him into a private bathroom, which curious eyes follow them to, and he tells the guards to keep people away until they emerge again. Tony isn’t even a bit concerned about being in the bathroom with Steve right now. He doesn’t care what the press will say. He cares that Steve doesn’t seem to be breathing, and his face is starting to turn a strange color of red.
“Where’d you learn to cook, anyway?” Tony asks.
“Call the police.” Phil’s voice is stern. “Are you sure no one’s there?”
“Be mine, Steve,” Tony says again. “I’ll take care of you. I won’t let anyone hurt you ever again. Just say you’ll be mine.”
“I just…,” Steve stalls for a second. He can’t remember how that happened. It was so fast, but it was so slow, too. “I was talking to him, and then I pulled the gun out of his hands.”
“We had something real!”
They finally come to the large pile of supplies that were delivered. The basswood is a massive chunk that will certainly have to be trimmed down before Steve can start carving anything. It’s eight feet tall, about four feet thick and probably weighs a couple hundred pounds. All the tools he needs have been provided as well. Paints, lacquers, everything he asked for is right here.
“Where were you when Mr. Swanson first entered your—Mr. Stark’s—home?”
Paul undoes his own pants, takes himself into his hand and starts pumping. He stops only when Steve shifts to put his arm behind his head, seeming to not like it.
“If you’re open to the idea,” Steve begins, “I’d like to
floor. Thanks,” he says into the receiver, and then he groans when he ends the call. “Worst timing ever,” Tony complains.
“When we spoke with Mr. Swanson, he seemed extremely upset about you in particular. It was last week, shortly after your car accident. He claims that you and Lucas are out to ruin his business and his marriage by making these false claims.”
Steve shrugs. “Things are never that easy.”
Steve bites his lip, but he doesn’t want to lie anymore. “A client,” he finally says.
“Not…really…,” Steve insists.
He stops along the way to gas up so he’ll have enough juice to get back and then to Stark Tower later, but it’s probably just an excuse to delay the inevitable. He’s been having such a good week that he doesn’t want to ruin it with a painful day with Paul. He’s not even sure how his body is going to feel afterwards; will he even be able to finish sculpting tonight?
“It was complicated, I guess.”
“Not really. Unless you have something planned.”
“What did he write?”
Tony shifts a bit so he can pull his own shirt over his head, working his hands on Steve’s jeans while trying to slide out of his own pants at the same time. It doesn’t seem to be working because Tony huffs in frustration.
“Everything will be okay,” Tony assures him. “Nobody gets past the security here.”
On the other side of the door, Tony sighs. “I was expecting some kind of creepy sex den,” he admits.
“That’s the idea of an art gallery.”
“I’d just need to go to my place to get my supplies,” Steve says. “Any chance you’d want to come with me?”
When the officers arrive an hour later, Steve lets them in cautiously. They take his statement, ask him what time he’d left and what time he came back, where was he last night, is anything missing, all the usual questions. They finally ask him if he knows who might have done this, and for some reason, Steve lies and says no. He feels guilty for lying but he figures it’s a way to protect himself. What if they go and find Paul and demand to know why he did this, and he tells them the truth? Steve does not want to get arrested for prostitution. Not when things are looking up.
“I guess I hadn’t really thought about it, either,” Tony admits. “But I’m pretty sure we’re beyond the fuckbuddy stage.”
“I’m going to keep you safe,” Tony says instead. “I’ve got guards at all the entrances to this hospital ward, and at home I’ve got patrols at every entrance. He isn’t going to be able to get to you.”
“Do you have a hospital record for that? Did you make any sort of report?”
“The model?” Steve laughs back. He doesn’t mention feeling the scar, or his curiosity about it. He wonders what could have happened to his man to cause such a deep blemish like that. Did it hurt, does it hurt now?
Steve gets up and tosses the condom into the trash. He cleans himself up with a towel Ryan provides and then starts putting his clothes back on, eventually looking around for his other shoe. When he’s got it on, Ryan stands by the door and they walk towards the living room together.
“No. Did someone…get hurt?”
Tony stands up, seemingly unable to handle the emotion in the bathtub anymore. He yanks Steve up by the hand and they head for the bedroom, not bothering to dry off by the time Tony has Steve on his back on the bed.
Tony shakes his head. “I’m worried
“Missed you too.”
To Paul, however, he carefully writes and then rereads several times, “Paul, I am very sorry but I will be unable to keep our arrangement. I have had something unexpected come up in my personal life that will make it impossible to continue meeting with you. I would be happy to help you find a replacement if the need arises.” It seems too formal, too easy. He knows Paul is going to be angry. He knows Paul is going to lash out. But what else can he do?
“That person being me,” Tony surmises.
“Sorry,” he laughs. “How was your event?”
Taking a breath, Steve turns to Tony and looks at him for several seconds. Tony is rambling on about a prototype in his lab that didn’t work quite as expected, about how he’ll have to tweak the programming when they get back from the art show later, about—
“Yeah?” Tony says, because he doesn’t know what else to say.
“But…we could stay here, naked, all day,” Tony refutes.
“Well, from what I can see of the pants, it looks great so far. Never doubted you for a second.”
Tony looks hesitant, like he doesn’t want to leave the apartment, but he finally nods and heads for the door.
Steve’s alarm goes off way too early and he groans as he reaches around to shut it off. He takes a look at the time, 7:30 AM, before groaning loudly and slowly sitting up in bed.
It takes a few moments, but finally Steve gets into the groove of carving. He starts with the base of the sculpture, which he is eventually going to lacquer a darker color, and carves shoes above his one-foot base. He doesn’t give the shoes much detail, just makes them exist, before moving up to create a pair of slacks for the statue to wear. It’s kind of strange to half a body with pants, but no defined head, but Steve figures it’ll take at least two days to get to the top part of the sculpture.
His towel had fallen off him in the night, but he disregards it as he walks through the house and puts on a pot of coffee before going to get dressed. He sleep-walks his way into a pair of pants and shoves his feet into socks before finding a comfortable shirt he can stand to work in.
He measures off the top foot of the wood, since Tony stature won’t need all eight feet of the block. He’d going to leave the bottom foot of wood for a base and then whittle the extra inches off as he works. He’s also going to cut the block in half long-ways, which will give him two, two-foot thick sections. He probably won’t even need the other section, but it’s good to have in case he royally screws up in the beginning.
Tony laughs, and it sounds almost nervous. “The sculpture is of me,” he begins. “I want it to show my good side,” he says, pointing to his left, as if it somehow more perfect than his right. “And the rest of me, too. Head to toe.”
Steve doesn’t respond, because that’s not the case at all. He would love to try, he would love to just let Tony take care of him and keep him safe and never have to do what he does ever again. But it’s not a reality. They might get along for a few weeks, and then Tony would get tired of him. He’s start thinking about all the other people who had fucked Steve, and it would tear them apart. And then Steve would be a broken mess and go groveling back to his clients and have to find a way to survive on his own again. He doesn’t think he can do that.
He takes hold of Ryan’s hips, increases his pace. Ryan begs him to go faster, so he does. He leans forward again, grabs Ryan’s dick and pumps it in rhythm with his thrusts. It doesn’t take long, maybe a few minutes, for Ryan to come in long, white streaks across his own chest. He clenches around Steve, and it sends him overboard. In his head he keeps saying, “
“What are you hungry for?” Steve asks, brushing his hand against Tony’s and smiling when it’s taken.
Steve tries to get into character. He tries to make it sound plausible when he says, “Oh, yes, Paul. Keep going.”
Disclaimer: I do not know anything about sculpting of any type, or art really...so...sorry to those who might see right through what I have clearly made up as possible.
Back in his car, Steve starts to head for a quick breakfast joint, but his phone rings in his pocket and he smiles a bit when he sees that it’s Tony calling.
Steve just grins. “Sorry. I couldn’t help myself.” He presses closer to Tony, their lips meeting in a light embrace. When Steve finally takes a step back, Tony huffs a little.
Ryan drops to his knees and tears Steve’s jeans down below his thighs. He starts stroking him, and then Steve feels hot breath right over his tip. He squeezes his eyes shut and thinks about Tony, how he felt when he touched him. The way his body responded to his caress. He’s suddenly fully hard, and Ryan takes it to mean what he’s doing is good work. But it’s not Ryan. It’s Tony.
ELEVEN
When he’d gone to see his doctor for the fractured rib, they’d said it could take six weeks for it to fully heal, but it’s barely been one and Steve is already feeling better. The bruise is gone, at least, and he can sit down without groaning in pain too much. He’s always been able to heal pretty fast; it’s just a gift he’s been blessed with.
“I know,” Steve smiles back. “But I need to get some work done at home. Clean the place, that sort of thing.”
“Maybe.”
Tony steps in behind him and closes the door, locking it for good measure. Steve watches carefully as Tony’s eyes scan around the living room.
“I work fast,” Steve says again.
floor button is already lit up so he just stands there awkwardly until the doors slide shut and starts to ascend. It seems to move impossibly fast, because a few seconds later, the doors slide open again and the scenery has changed. Instead of the lobby, he’s in what appears to be a house.
Steve stiffens a little, and after a while he says, “Tony,” to try and get his attention.
“Oh, okay. Tomorrow then.”
“You could have just printed a picture of me off the internet,” Tony says absentmindedly.
“Alright,” Steve nods.
“Oh yeah? Should I let you go?”
“You don’t want my body?”
Tony looks around the room, making sure they aren’t being watched, before he takes a purposeful step forward.
“Where were your parents?” Tony murmurs.
“I’ll let you know,” Tony finally says. “But I doubt it’ll happen.”
“Why didn’t you make a report when he first sent these?”
Steve groans when the guy licks the cum off his thigh. Not out of pleasure, but out of annoyance. The guy doesn’t take it like that, though. He just smiles like he’s done good work.
“No.”
“Have you ever made any sort of official complaint against Mr. Swanson that might help this case?”
“You could always come back,” Tony insists.
Steve likes how easy it is with Ryan. He can just…be himself, or at least, a version of himself, and the sex is enjoyable. It may be a job, but at least it’s not the worst job to have when an attractive, rich man wants to fuck you and likes it when you get off, too.
“It’s a habit, I guess. I want everything to be perfect and if my head is somewhere else then it can’t be perfect.”
TWO WEEKS LATER
“Steve. What’s up?”
A good friend owns the shop so when he gets there he’s greeted like a long lost brother. They jabber on for a few moments before getting down to business.
Steve stops dead in his tracks and Tony doesn’t seem to notice, because he continues approaching the art with Steve’s name on it. Steve steps backwards a step, planning to turn and run as fast as he can. By the time he’s gotten a second step backwards, Tony has realized he’s not by his side anymore and turns to look.
Steve eventually steps out of the shower onto the cool tile floor and lets the water drip off him before grabbing a towel. He takes several deep breaths to steady himself and then goes to get dressed. From the living room, he can hear the elevator ding and he assume whatever food Tony ordered has arrived. He tries to put on a strong face for Tony. He’s going to eat dinner with him, and he’s going to find something to laugh about. He’s going to move past this whole thing because there doesn’t seem to be any other choice anyway.
“I…I’m sorry, Tony. I’m so sorry,” Steve begins. “I don’t know…why I did that. I couldn’t stop. I’m so sorry.” He rambles on, sobbing, but Tony just brings him in for a hug, and he doesn’t let him go for a long time.
Steve nods, but mostly because he can’t form any words. His head is spinning. He thinks he might be more afraid of explaining the situation with Paul than actually facing Paul again.
Steve nods back, his head in his work and not realizing where his hand is, until Tony steps up behind him.
“Right before the car accident.”
Tony stretches when he stands up, his shirt ridding up a bit. Steve’s fingers reach out and touch the skin there lightly, smiling when Tony shivers at the unexpected contact.
floor in silence, and then Tony kicks off his shoes beside the rug. Steve follows his lead and removes his shoes, too.
Steve sighs, and then he smiles a bit. “Uh, yeah actually. I’ve started…seeing someone. I dropped all my clients to give this thing a shot.”
Steve squints, having trouble visualizing what Tony is talking about.
he yells at himself. It doesn’t really work, but it does help stall the growing bulge in his pants. He thinks about old ladies and cabbage for the rest of the ride, and to his relief when he pulls up to the guard shack at the tower, any interest in his previous thoughts has dissipated. The nervousness takes over when he rolls down the window and a guard comes out to greet him.
“You’re just trying to get me out of the house.”
“I have to go,” Steve says, this time it’s definite. He can’t stay. He’s leaving. He may never see Tony again. This is goodbye.
“It’s going,” Steve nods back. “How about you?”
Steve backs up a pace and he finds his hand on the door handle. His heart is begging him to stay, to kiss Tony, to never let him go. But his mind is telling him to run away, that he can’t recover from the inevitable hurt that will follow if he stays.
“Come out,” Tony tries. “Dinner’s going to be here soon.”
Steve gulps. Did he say that out loud?
“Yes, so far,” Steve nods.
They’ve probably been in the bathroom for a full twenty minutes by the time Steve decides he looks presentable enough to go back into the gallery. They’ve been in there so long that anyone who might have been waiting for them to come out has already been forced to move on.
The three of them stand there together for what feels like hours, but in reality is probably mere seconds, before Paul says, “Steve. Good to see you.”
Tony is waiting for him, and when he steps off the elevator he connects their mouths instantly. Steve is a bit surprised, but he just smiles into the kiss. It isn’t very deep, just a “Hello, I missed you,” kiss, but it’s satisfying enough.
Steve nods dumbly before saying, “Um, yes.”
After he’s caught his breath again, Ryan starts talking about his job again, how he wishes he could just leave and find something else to do. Steve listens, or, half listens. He’s busy thinking about Tony, what it would be like to have him under him, begging to be fucked, begging Steve to come in him.
When the coffee pot beeps, he pours a cup and then heads for the door, grabbing the suit on the hangar on his way and locking up on the other side. He doesn’t have time right now to bring the suit back to Adam, so he’ll have to do it a bit later. Adam won’t mind, he’s sure. And if he does, he’ll just charge a late return fee.
“N-no, Mr. Stark,” Steve says. “The auction is online, I believe. You can place a bid there.”
“Dear Mr. Rogers,
Finally, Monday, was Paul. The only client Steve didn’t even remotely enjoy seeing. Paul was a sadist and he had blown through all the other guys at the gay bar Steve usually picked up clients at until striking up a deal with Steve for a weekly meeting. Paul had control issues and needed to be in charge. He also liked that Steve would pretend he enjoyed what was done to him. Five hundred a week from Paul didn’t seem like nearly enough when the man had his hand squeezed around Steve’s sensitive member, but it paid the bills and until he found a better Monday client, Paul was all he had.
“No, I’ll be quick. I just need to make a phone call. Hopefully that resolves it.”
It’s about ten now, which gives him two hours to start on the waist section of the sculpture. He’s confident that he can get at least half of it carved out in that time, if he can just keep his head clear.
He manages to open his eyes again, and this time keeps them open for a few seconds so he can look around the room. The first thing he sees is Tony sitting in a chair next to the bed, his head leaned back; asleep. It’s Tony’s hand who is gripping Steve’s so tightly, though.
Steve just smiles slowly. “Why not?”
“Steve!” she says enthusiastically. “I was worried you might not make it.”
“But if you see Mr. Swanson and he makes you uncomfortable, please don’t hesitate to call me. I would love nothing more than to put this scum away. But I can’t, if you don’t call.”
Tony moves his hands up and down Steve’s body while they kiss, eventually reaching under his shirt. Steve breaks away from the kiss so he can pull his shirt over his head, groaning a bit when Tony moves down so he can lick one of his nipples.
“Absolutely,” Steve grins back, and then suddenly he’s on the other side of the door.
“Who is it?” Tony asks.
“You’re not okay. You’re bleeding. Did you get mugged or something on the way here?”
“I know,” he says to the wood. “Stop looking at me.”
Steve does some quick calculations in his head. He works quickly, but two weeks is short notice. And he’d need time to have the medium delivered, and then he’d need a way to transport it to wherever Tony was having this party.
“I came out of the bathroom to go find Tony, and then I saw Paul with a gun pointed at Tony.”
“I literally walked into your house a dozen times,” Steve says uncertainly.
floor. A couple minutes later, the elevator dings and the guy steps out, seeming somewhat inundated by delivering a pizza to Stark Tower.
Steve bites his lip, because he knows the only reason it brought such a high price was because Tony bought it. He doubts his newest work will bring anything at all. Just something to look at, consider, and move on from.
“Enough to know you shouldn’t be here,” Tony says, ignoring the handshake.
As expected, it takes an hour to finish the varnish coat. Steve stands back and takes a final look at the sculpture, taking a moment to snap a photo of it. Somewhat so he can remember his creation, but also because he wants proof that he did this, that he made something beautiful with his own hands.
“But you could have!”
“Tell me what’s wrong.”
“I guess, that night we got a little distracted, and I haven’t seen it since.”
“We don’t have to use one, you know,” Tony says.
Steve sighs. “I know I’m being a big baby about all this,” he says. “I need to just…handle it.”
Steve nods and puts the tape measurer in his pocket. He tries not to let his breath shudder as he reaches out and briefly makes contact with Tony’s sides. It’s like electric running through him, and he knows that if he doesn’t hurry, this is going to make him way too hot.
They sit together in the tub for a long time, until the water starts to chill, and then Tony makes the executive decision to get out. He wraps a towel around Steve and pats him dry before grabbing his own towel and wrapping it around his waist.
When the door is locked behind them, Tony turns Steve around and grips his face. He tries just talking to him, tries to bring him out of his panic, but it doesn’t seem to be working. Even a carefully placed kiss doesn’t help Steve breathe again.
TWELVE
“What’s he being charged with?”
“I’m running out of witty things to say about these other pieces.”
“8 is great,” he gets back.
He can hear Tony grin again when they hang up, and Steve just smiles as he drives towards Stark Tower. Things have been different for him over the last few weeks. Sure, he’s spent a significant time worrying about Paul and whether or not the man is gone for good or if he’s just waiting for the best time to strike, but he’s also spent a lot of time with Tony. He feels so…normal. So…domestic. He likes it.
“I…,” he trails off, unable to think of a response.
Steve flips the first sandwich. “What do you think you’d be doing, if not this?” he asks.
“He might as well be. I freaked out.”
Just seconds before getting in he remembers that he needs to send Tony a list of supplies he needs, so he goes to find the business card he’d been given and starts to write out a text message. He doesn’t want to sound too formal, but not too causal, either. He reads it a dozen times before pressing send, and then adds a quick, “Thank you” at after that.
“Anyway,” Paul says. “It was nice to see you Steve. We should catch up again soon. I’ll see you around.”
“Have you responded?”
He doesn’t say any of these things, though. Instead, he cautiously says, “I’m afraid I’ll be too much for you.”
“I’m feeling okay. Still tired, but can’t sleep anymore.”
“But there’s still so much to see here!” Tony complains. “And we haven’t even tried out your bed yet.”
“Not sure yet,” he shrugs back. “But eventually I’ll find a use for it. And welding is peaceful.”
Steve shows him the food he’s prepared, and suddenly the domestic feeling hits him again. He doesn’t mind it, though. This time he’s prepared. This time he’s happy to know that this feeling is okay and is appreciated and even reciprocated.
see anything dangerous. Steve’s eyes wander over to Tony, and he realizes that Tony is doing the same thing.
“It’s going to be okay,” Tony says, loud enough for Paul to hear.
“This is the place,” Steve says, his voice still lower than usual. For some reason he’s suddenly very self-conscious about showing Tony where he has lived for so long. It doesn’t look like it’ll be enough anymore, even though it was always enough before he met Tony.
Steve nods slowly. “He works at the bar I used to work at.”
Steve grins. “Well, hopefully I don’t have to find out.”
“Uh, no. Maybe after I get started. I want to at least have the slab carved down to size, then I’ll do the drawing.”
“But if it does, I’ll understand.”
“So do you,” Tony replies, looking Steve over from head to toe. Steve is still just in his boxers, so he rolls his eyes.
What happens after that is all a blur to Steve. Blakely walks him to the door, Tony embraces him on the other side, and they are excused and allowed to go home. Steve doesn’t remember walking to the car, or Tony reaching across to buckle him in, or even the ride back to the tower. Finally, when Tony comes around to his side of the car and opens the door, Steve looks up and realizes that he’s been a ghost for too long.
Steve manages to get up and wander over to the bathroom, grimacing only when he bumps his shoulder against the door frame. It’s harder than he expected to urinate using the opposite hand he usually holds himself with, but he finally finishes with a triumphant smile on his face. He thinks about taking a shower, but the thought of holding himself upright for so long sounds incredibly daunting. He thinks he can probably talk Tony into taking a bath with him later on, anyway.
When the doctor leaves the room again, Steve doesn’t want to sit back down on the bed. He actually dreads doing that.
“We’ve had a rough couple weeks,” Tony murmurs, taking Steve’s foot from his side of the tub and bringing it towards himself. He massages the sole, runs his hands up the ankle, but stops just below the knee.
He tries to shake that thought from his head when he approaches the office in the back of the studio. He stops just outside the door because he can hear a heated conversation going on inside between two men. One of the voices he recognizes are the curator of the event, and the other sounds familiar but he can’t place the name.
“Good morning, Tony,” Steve says back, smiling down at him.
“And what does Mrs. Rogers do? Any kids at home?”
“If you must know, I was lonely and a friend told me to come here for reputable, one-time fun,” Tony says. “So now that I’ve explained myself, what are you doing here?”
“Any other plans for the day?” Steve asks.
“I came for the art,” Paul says. “I read in the paper that Steve was going to be featured, so I wanted to come by. He hasn’t been home in a while, you see. I was starting to worry.”
“Could have,” Steve agrees.
When he comes to, Steve is aware of an annoying pain in his arm. His eyes flutter open, but it’s too bright so he shuts them again. From his quick glimpse, he can tell that he’s in a hospital bed, but he doesn’t remember how he got there, or why his body is suddenly aching so much.
“Well, they’d be right.”
“You can take a seat,” Steve says. “I’m going to draw your face first. Faces, and especially expressions, are tricky to carve without a frame of reference.”
“Any references?”
Tony stiffens, but he tries to hide it. “You can do whatever you want to Steve,” Tony says back, not meaning for his words to come out so briskly.
Tony stiffens again, but he relaxes faster than before. “My mom was kind. She tried to protect me from my father,” Tony says. “But he wanted a protégé, and that meant drilling into my head algorithms and advanced trigonometry at a very young age. I guess I’m grateful for it now that I’m an adult, but I do wish I’d been able to do more kid stuff. You know, little league, trips to the zoo.”
“Get going,” Steve insists. “The car’s already waiting out front for you.”
The iron gate opens and Steve pulls inside, feeling trapped suddenly when the gate closes behind him. He drives up to the stairs that lead inside the building and gets out slowly, surprised when a man greets him.
Tony leads him over to the table and offers the detective a seat across from them. The detective pulls out a small notebook and a pen, flipping through it for a moment until he comes to a page that already has notes scribbled on it.
He rounds the corner and sees Tony standing at the bar, a couple bags of food in front of him. Steve starts to say something, ask what’s for dinner, but Tony’s body is rigid. He has a scowl. Everything about his stance says he is thoroughly uncomfortable.
Tony laughs back, and then to Steve’s surprise he grabs a chair and sits on the other side of the sculpture. He gestures for Steve to continue, and suddenly he’s very nervous. He works well under pressure usually, but having Tony watching him is just too much pressure.
“This one’s just for you,” Tony says, putting a hand on Steve’s chest and pushing him back down. He then cuddles back up, letting Steve’s arm wrap around him.
“You don’t have a lot of stuff,” Tony comments.
Instead of yelling at him, or kicking him out, or admonishing him in anyway as Steve was expecting, Tony just wraps him into a tight hug. The embrace seems to last forever. So long that Steve is the one to pull away.
happy. He just knows he likes the way he feels, and it makes him smile, and he likes to smile.
Tony hesitates, but finally he nods. He stands a few inches from Steve, ready to catch him if he starts to wobble, but Steve feels stronger with each step he takes. He still has pain shooting down his body from his back, but it’s not so bad when he stands. This isn’t even the worst pain he’s ever been though. There was the time he fell off the monkey bars at school and broke his leg. That was painful. This is just an inconvenience.
“Alright,” Tony agrees, and then he brings their mouths together for a deep kiss.
Blakely writes something down, but he finally just closes his notebook.
“Um, thank you?” Steve finally says.
“Good. Because I like it too.”
Tony nods, stands up, and takes Steve by the hand. He leads him through the house until they reach the bedroom door. Tony kicks it open, pulls Steve in, and then pushes him backwards onto the bed. He climbs on top of Steve again, pressing their bodies together tightly. His hands run up Steve’s sides and then back down, stopping at the hem of Steve’s shirt and he pushes it up. Steve leans up so it can be lifted over his head.
“Not really,” Steve sighs, but he stands up anyway.
It scared him how much he liked Tony. Maybe even…
Steve nods again, sucking in a breath and trying to hide the redness that is creeping into his cheeks. Tony lets go of his hand briefly to walk the detective over to the elevator, and then accepts the business cards offered. When Tony comes back, he wraps his arms around Steve tightly.
, Steve, and I know that you could probably find a job and I could too, but it’d be so hard, and we’d never be left alone. You get that, right? The world would throw a fit, and we’d be swallowed up. Do you want your face everywhere more than it already is? Because it will be. But instead of ‘National Hero,’ the headline will say something a lot worse.”
“Fine, fine,” Steve conceded. Thankfully for Tony, he decided to be merciful today, because he bent down, gave Tony a deep kiss, sweet but firm, licked at the seam of his lips until the brunet moaned a little, opened his mouth.
He walked himself directly into Steve’s arms, pressed himself against the soldier’s chest so quick it almost knocked the air out of him, and clung to him desperately.
“Well don’t worry, your breakfast sandwich didn’t come with any dishes to wash,” Steve assured him, reaching for the bag. “You feeling okay enough to eat?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve deepened the kiss, let his tongue delve into Tony’s mouth, lick at his teeth, and Tony sighed into it a little, let himself be swept up by it, until Steve pulled back, his hands firm on Tony’s arms.
Steve felt his shoulders drop a little in relief. He nodded a little. “I’m trying,” he replied. “I really am. I know it hasn’t been good enough—“
Steve understood that feeling all too well. They had a major responsibility to the world in general, and now that they’d thrown it into peril, it was their job to fix it. That was a lot of pressure, especially for people like them, with the eyes of every nation on them. They couldn’t afford to lose. They couldn’t afford to fuck up.
Peter let out a squeal as the waves brushed over his toes and Steve lifted him higher, like a swing. “They’re always good!” Steve called back, and pressed a kiss to his son’s cheek.
“I love you,” he said, and warmth bloomed in his chest at the way it made her eyes light up, the affection in her gaze. She leaned low over him, gently brushed his cheek and planted a luxurious kiss on his lips. His hands framed her hips, caressed her tanned skin.
Rhodey didn’t want to push him into it, not after everything. He thought of course it’d be better if he and Steve communicated openly, comfortably, but he supposed he understood Tony’s hesitance, after all the brunet had admitted.

His dreams were different now, and
“Hey—I didn’t have much of a choice. I didn’t wanna get drenched, and I kept waiting and waiting to get a cab but people kept taking them from me, and you were the only one with an umbrella big enough to hide under, and really you were just handed to me on a silver platter. I thought you’d veer off somewhere along the way, but you just kept going the same way I did, and I thought about saying something, but it was easier to just—just..kind of…stay quiet.”
. The only time Steve got like that though was during a rut, and unfortunately for Tony, it would be another few weeks before one of those rolled around.
to make up for.
He was sure he’d be stuck in this moment of suspension forever, but Steve, thankfully, broke the spell.
felt tight. Steve still could hardly contain his moans, keep his pace slow and steady against the slippery, smooth heat wrapped around him. Tony was whimpering beneath him, face flushed, hair disheveled. His eyes, when they were open, were dark, kind of glassy, and his lips were parted, red from biting, from trying to stifle his voice.
“This one,” Steve replied, and handed Tony his drink, thankfully ripping him from his thoughts.
Tony didn’t need to be told twice. He grasped his dick immediately, already slippery from how much he’d been leaking. He thumbed his slit, teased the sensitive head and then brought his hand down in quick, jerking strokes, eager to get there, to finish, not only for himself, to let go of that overwhelming tension, that deep desperation, but so Steve could cum, so Tony could feel his spunk filling him up, because he liked how it felt dribbling out, when his hole was loose and fucked, because Steve would call it pretty, would play with him when he did, and it made Tony feel so perfect, so loved he could hardly stand it. He loved being dirty, he loved belonging to Steve, and Steve was damn proud Tony belonged to him.
, and it was so damn messy,
“You did,” Tony said against his lips, gave him a soft kiss. “And it was real nice, but I want you in me, baby. You know how much I love it.”
Tony slid off of his lap immediately, shuffled back on the king-sized bed, and laid back on the mattress. He unbuttoned his jeans, tugged them off while Steve got off of the bed, reached into his nightstand’s drawer and pulled out a bottle of lube. He dropped it on the bed and started unbuttoning his shirt, taking his time with each button, not fumbling once, while Tony bit his lip, the display going straight to his cock, pre-cum already marking a wet spot on his briefs.
God, this angle was always more intense, more overwhelming, because Steve was just so damn big, and even with all the slick Tony was leaking, making the slide smooth, he still felt so…so
“Aren’t you gonna take your clothes off too?” Tony asked when he was naked, stretched out bare on the bed.
together. We’d just be a secret, Steve. My father would strangle me if he found out about us, and I know the media would have a fucking field day. Is—Are you okay with that? Are you okay with it being just us, hiding, stealing bits of happiness for ourselves?”
“Don’t cum,” Steve said softly, but he meant it.
, please—please—“ He was so goddamn close, started squirming now, driving himself down further onto Steve’s cock, trying to get him to go faster, or harder, or something.
“Maybe we should,” Steve replied, shrugging a little. “I’m sure they’ll appreciate it. I’ve been meaning to give Sam a visit, and you’ve got Rhodey coming over on Sunday.”

Steve took a deep breath, got to his feet. ‘
“Then you’re gonna get your ass on a jet, go see him, and be the best mate, the best

“Oh, hell yes, sweetheart,” Tony sighed, and he turned his head, pressed a kiss to Steve’s muzzle.
,” Steve insisted. He looked around the room; no one was paying them any attention. His voice dipped a little lower, and he almost growled the words out. “Because you don’t wanna find out what’s gonna happen if you don’t.”
For the first time in a long while, Steve considered succumbing, letting the world swallow him up like the icy water of the Atlantic had so many years ago.
Steve watched Tony’s eyes inspect the items he’d brought now, saw the question forming on his lips.
“We’ll figure something out, just not right now. Come on, let’s get you somewhere more comfortable. These chairs suck,” Rhodey replied, tugging on his hand gently.
So maybe Tony kind of had an obsession with Steve’s ass. But to be fair, he had an obsession with
He had so many things to worry about and to catch up on, that he didn’t really want to bring his love life into the mix. He still missed Peggy, too. They hadn’t been together, because he didn’t have the

Tony jumped a little in surprise at the pinch and frowned—

decrease tenfold, turn into something else entirely which he couldn’t give name to.
As the years went on, Steve had become a lot less shy about PDA. Tony still remembered the first time they’d held hands in public, how Steve’s face went red, his smile timid but pleased. That was a long way away from where they were now, with the blond physically lifting Tony into his arms like he did on occasion in the house when he was feeling extra happy, or after a mission, when his relief was palpable.
He didn’t feel any better really, could still hear the conversation on repeat in his brain, but at least Steve was here now, and he was able to stop the soldier from confronting Howard. He knew that one day he might not be able to, and was frankly terrified of whatever would happen then, but tried not to think about it now.
Tony’s heart skipped a beat, and the room suddenly felt a thousand degrees warmer, but not in a bad way. He licked his lips, summoned his courage, and spoke.
And held out a hand to Steve.
Tony slung it over his eyes and forehead, let the heat dull the sensation of pain. Steve curled an arm over his midsection then, tugged him close again. The nausea had abated a little. Tony didn’t think he’d throw up again, which he was very thankful for, even if his throat was raw now and his skin no doubt blotchy. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d vomited so hard that the capillaries in his face broke.
Yes, that day in the rain had been kind of silly and weird, but it also led Steve here, comfortable in the arms of his boyfriend and having a relaxing day off together. Tony worked a lot, so moments like this were rare, where he wasn’t working on some kind of machine or vehicle. He was saving up to buy the workshop from its current owner, wanted to make it his own business, so he wasn’t one to be idle.
Peter’s crying had eased off, but Tony’s had only increased. He squeezed his eyes shut, took heaving breaths, the words pouring out directly from his heart. “I-I should’ve swallowed my pride. I should’ve tried harder for you, and—and I’m so sorry I didn’t! I’m so sorry. You need him, and I do too.”
Tony brushed back Steve’s bangs, leaned over him a little, his knees spread wide around the blond’s midsection. “What do you want, honey?” he asked, his voice low and sweet.
… Jesus
Steve tickled his chin a little to get him to laugh again, smiled at his reaction. “See? Maybe sleep isn’t so bad after all, huh?” he asked.
For now, he worked on his sketching, tried to capture the delicate, messy curls of Tony’s hair, free-flowing and a little wild, like when he woke up in the morning, before he took the time to manipulate the locks into his signature hairstyle. He’d grabbed a shirt too, because it was a little bit cooler here than on the beach. His white, collared button-down was only done up about halfway, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows.
“Will do.”
Tony’s eyes scanned the data with lightning speed. The Quinjet had indeed arrived at the target location, and remained there for an appropriate amount of time. It had taken off again afterwards, headed southward, with more haste than usual, but then…
He was beautiful. He was amazing.  He was absolutely perfect. He looked so much like Tony, but there was a hint of Steve in him too, and by the stirring in his heart, the deep-rooted instinct to love, to protect, it was clear he belonged to them, was their child. He was everything they had dreamed about so long ago, that they were convinced would never be theirs, and it was incredible. He was so small, and his cheeks were flushed, and he looked so delicate, so precious. Whatever part of Steve didn’t belong to Tony
Steve was shockingly close now, how did that happen? Tony could almost reach out, stretch his arm and grab hold of the other man. He didn’t know why he would. To shake him, throttle him to death maybe. Or maybe he just wanted Steve closer. To be in his space again like he used to be, so comfortably.
Now here they were standing next to a dumpster and Tony regreted all of it. But he also wanted to jump on Steve and kiss him until his beard left burns on Tony’s face.
He gripped so tightly onto the empty coffee cup he was holding his knuckles went white, then slammed it into the sink, chunks of clay dusting the basin, blood and cuts erupting from his hands. He swore, wrapped an entire rolled of paper towel around his hand flicking the switch for the garbage disposal.
“What, Tony,” Steve looked angry, but Tony didn’t back down. They both knew. Steve’s jaw clenched and he nodded, and suddenly their eyes where both watering. “Fine.”
Steve was almost unrecognizable. His hair was wild and long, not his usual neat do (more to grab on to) sporting an impressive beard (would it burn if they kissed?) that made him look so much older, even tho Steve was technically like one hundred years old or whatever. Still, seeing Steve dressed up as Bear Grilles made Tony yearn for fresh-faced Captain Rogers, the only lines scaring his face were around his mouth after 60 years worth of smiling.
The noise was coming around the corner, under the bridge that separated the wings of the compound. There was a figure there, a shadow that had startled as he’d fallen. Tony begged the intruder would startle and run then he could run inside for his suit and catch the bastard. Show him for making Tony look like a hot mess.
“Mr. Rogers,” the Detective Blakely nods. “Sorry to inconvenience you. I just have a few questions.”
“The artist is just having trouble completing the project, sir,” the curator says. “He asked for a few more weeks, and then it’ll be delivered to you.”
“I remember that,” Tony nods. “The night we kissed. You were almost finished with the sculpture. You were hurt but wouldn’t tell me.”
By the time they get out, the entire room is filled with thick steam.
“No.”
“Want some breakfast?” Tony asks. “I got some groceries delivered earlier. I could make you…toast.”
They finally step out of the car, a crowd of cameras suddenly snapping their pictures and the annoying “click, click, click” fills Steve’s ears. He pushes down his worry and waits for Tony to come join him on the other side of the car before they head into the gallery. He can already see the speculation in the crowd, but again he pushes his doubt and fears aside as Tony greets people.
Steve laughs again gently. He holds the phone to one ear while he sets up his art table and pulls up a chair so he can work. Tony makes a sound on the other end that sounds like pain, and Steve’s ears tune in.
When they finally emerge, the guards block the view so whoever might have been watching can’t see what shape they’re in. Steve starts to head for the front door, expecting Tony to just follow, but instead Tony leads him back to his work that hangs in the middle of the gallery.
“Um, okay,” Steve nods. “How do I…get inside?” he asks.
His phone dings and he glances down at the message, not surprised to see a response from Tony: “I’m at an event, but I’ll be home around eight.”
It doesn’t last long. Steve comes first, his orgasm hitting him hard and Tony thrusting in tune with the waves. His come shoots out in long streaks across his and Tony’s chests, and only a few seconds later Tony is moaning and he comes so hard that for a few minutes after he rides out his orgasm, he doesn’t pull out of Steve.
So for the time being, they’ve just been enjoying each other’s company in Tony’s penthouse, or Tony’s lab, or just anywhere in the entire building that they make it to before sex becomes a part of the game plan. And sex is almost always part of the game plan.
They lay there together for a while longer, but Steve can feel Tony growing restless. He’s not very good at sitting when there are things to be done. Steve finally just grins and throws his legs over the edge of the bed.
Steve lowers himself into the water and then turns to watch Tony undress. He likes the way Tony’s muscles move under his skin, the way the light trail of hair from his belly button runs south. He likes the way Tony looks naked, and if he weren’t stuck inside his own head, he’d probably he hard right now.
Steve thinks about it for a moment before finally shaking his head. The thought that Paul might be out there, watching him, makes him uneasy. He knows he’s quite safe here in Stark Tower, and Tony is safe, too. But out there in the open, anything could happen.
“Alright then. I guess…get to work?”
“Clearly a flaw in my security,” Tony murmurs.
“Can we do this another time?” Tony questions, his annoyance clear in his voice. He just wants the officers to leave. He wants to be alone with Steve so he can fix him, to let him know that everything is alright and it will be better from now on.
That morning, Tony had gotten a call just after the sun came up. He’d left the room to take it and Steve couldn’t make out his hushed words, but when Tony returned, he seemed a bit more relaxed. He hadn’t given any explanation, but Steve didn’t really care. Tony was behaving a little more like the old Tony, and that’s all he cared about.
Steve bites his lip. “I, um…,” he begins, and then he sighs. There is no other way to get it out than to just say it. “Before I met you, I had a client,” he says, searching Tony’s face for repulsion at the mention of his former life, just a few weeks ago. When he sees none, he goes on. “He was really brutal. Gave me a cracked rib at some point. I ended our arrangement, and he was very upset about it.”
Steve looks around, seeing Paul’s bloody face as the officers handcuff him. He definitely broke the man’s nose, that’s for sure. Paul still looks dazed, as if he can’t believe what has happened.
Steve had thought that, maybe, just maybe, Tony would be there in bed when he woke up. But he wasn’t really surprised when he woke up alone. He stretched a bit and then headed for the living room, and when he didn’t see Tony there he knew he’d be down in the lab. Tony was only ever in two places, either on the couch or in his lab.
“Yeah, yeah.”
Tony seems to know what he’s thinking because his body goes rigid for a second before he takes a step closer. “You can…measure with your hands, if you need to,” he says, and it comes out just as awkwardly as Steve feels about it.
“Steve!” he says. “How are you feeling? Are you okay? Do you need anything?” he asks in a rush.
He lies still for a few more moments, just trying to get the memories to come back to him. How did he get here, what happened? But still nothing comes to mind, and eventually the curiosity gets to him so he squeezes Tony’s hand gently.
Steve sighs, wishing his thoughts would be quiet for once. He needs to get over Tony. He needs to move on. He needs to finish this project so he can go back to his life and be happy with the way things were before.
“You’ll just have to come to the show,” Steve grins. “But I think you’ll like it.”
“Just a stressful day before the show,” he laughs. “But show me what you brought so we can get it up on the wall.”
“Yes,” Steve answers.
Steve groans when Tony’s hand wraps around him, and he says wantonly, “I’ll be yours, Tony, if you’ll be mine, too.”
much of anything, but he lets Adam fuss over him until he’s satisfied.
He hasn’t done this for the pure pleasure of it in a very long time. It’s been quite a while since anyone even piqued his interest in that way. But the instant attraction to Tony was undeniable at the gallery earlier, and now that they’ve chatted a bit it’s impossible to ignore his growing lust for the other man.
Except, it doesn’t really because they mostly just lean against each other under the spray, kissing languidly.
Tony nods, understanding that Steve doesn’t mean
“Well, it’s actually almost noon.”
“How are you feeling, Steve?” the officer asks, crouching down so he can get a better look. “This must have been very frightening for you both.”
He knows he needs to call the police, that he shouldn’t even go inside. The perpetrator could still be in there, after all! But he decides to chance it. He’s pretty strong. He could probably take somebody down in a fist fight if he had to.
“I don’t hate you,” Steve tries.
“No,” Steve grins back, his cheeks heating slightly at having gotten caught staring.
“I am sorry for the inconvenience, sir. The artist just needs more time.”
“Are you familiar with a Lucas Provilla?”
“How did your work thing go?”
Steve nods, and slowly reaches down to retrieve the brush. He grunts in pain, and it doesn’t go unnoticed.
“Look, if you need anything, just call me. I’m always a phone call away.”
He still smiles to himself, though, when he thinks about Tony, and about how they’re going to
“So I could have you for a night?” Tony asks.
“I bought it because I liked it,” Tony says back, shoving his hands in his pockets. “The amount was for children or cancer or something. I didn’t know they’d send you a check.”
Usually Steve would be into this. He enjoyed his time with Ryan because the man wasn’t completely selfish. They were able to have a normal sex relationship, minus the payment part at the end. But for some reason, right now, Steve is having to tap into his reserves to get the blood flowing to the right area. He’s having to concentrate, having to force himself to get hard. Maybe he over spent himself by masturbating twice in two days, his
Steve leads Tony up the stairs to his floor and then has to dig through his pockets for his keys. It’s been a while since he’s been back here, and when he pushes the door open he expects to see dust and cobwebs. Instead, it looks exactly the way he left it.
see you anymore,” Steve tries again. “You make me feel…safe, and happy, and I can’t…have those things.”
“Steve,” Phil says. “You stay safe. This guy is a real creep.”
“Or should I bring something back from town?”
“But you are under the impression that Mr. Swanson caused your car accident? What makes you think that?”
Instead of going straight to work as he’d intended, it takes Steve a while to settle in. His apartment has been his home for years, but after spending so much time at Tony’s, he realizes how nice it is to have nice things. His couch, ratty and old, is uncomfortable compared to Tony’s leather recliner. His bed, worn and sunken, is insulting since he’s slept on Tony’s luxury king mattress. But, while his things might not be nice, he acknowledges that he worked hard to get them, and he’s proud to at least own
Steve smiles, and then gets on the elevator. Once again, his car is waiting outside for him and he drives off, looking briefly in the rearview mirror at the tower before it disappears from sight.
“Looks great,” Tony murmurs, turning so he can kiss Steve again. The kiss lasts for several moments. Not too deep, but enough to convey emotions and feelings for both of them.
“Sorry,” he says.
SIXTEEN
Tony slowly withdraws his hands after one final, gentle, pinch to Steve’s nipple. “Alright, babe,” Tony agrees, and with a quick kiss he adds, “But later you’re mine.”
“You want to get up?”
Tony just laughs at the question. “I
“Yeah, I’m sure they do.”
When the doctor comes by, he looks at Steve’s charts before asking him if he can get up. Steve forces the pain away until he’s in a seated position, his legs over the side of the bed. He doesn’t like the way Tony is watching him like a hawk, but he knows that if he can’t get on his own two feet, the doctor won’t let him go home. And for some reason, he just wants to go home right now. He wants Tony to wrap him in his arms and the wants to just fall asleep like that.
“I dropped the knife earlier,” he lies.
“How long will it take before they find your bodies?” Paul demands. “Days, hours?”
Every once in a while Tony’s hand will run up and down Steve’s forearm, playing with his arm hair or intertwining their fingers briefly before seemingly becoming impatient and starting over again. The nervous hand movements makes Steve look down before he just grins, finally understanding what Tony is saying without words. He turns so he can peck Tony on the lips, but it doesn’t end there. He wraps an arm around Tony’s waist and pulls him closer.
Tony isn’t completely sure why he’s so fixated on finding Paul, but he knows he has to do it. Even if it’s simply to make Steve feel safer in the world, Tony will do it.
cook, you know,” Tony says back. “I just choose not to. And making a sandwich isn’t cooking anyway. It’s more like…assembling. And I’m really good at assembling things.”
“You really put a lot of thought into it, haven’t you?” Tony asks.
Steve shakes his head. “I don’t want to,” he says. “Unless you want to.”
Steve knows that what happened between him and Tony was a one-time thing, and that he’ll probably never see Tony again. He’s accepted it, and he’s moving on from it. Their one night together, though, was enough to make him crave so much more. It was sex between two individuals who wanted to have sex, no money exchanged, and the feeling is so strange and foreign that Steve isn’t sure what to make of it.
When he gets home, he pulls himself out of the car and then manages to kick his apartment door shut behind himself. He goes straight to the bathroom and pulls off his shirt, looking at the ugly bruise that has formed on his stomach. He knows he should probably go get it checked out, but he doesn’t want to. He just wants to go lie down and think about Tony, like he does every night.
Tony finally smiles, even though it’s half-hearted. “I hope you do.”
After finishing his coffee, Steve checked his phone for the time and then went to find clean socks. He had a couple hours before he needed to be at the show, which gave him plenty of time to rent a suit and then arrive in time to set up his pieces in the back.
“Um,” he sputters. “It’s called ‘I wish,’” he finally gets out.
Instead of responding, Steve puts his arm behind his head and sighs. He doesn’t know what to say. He doesn’t know how to tell Tony that none of this is his fault. He knows he can’t say anything to reassure the man that things will be alright, because they won’t be. Nothing will be alright.
“We can be on the West Coast in five hours if we leave now,” Tony goes on. “There’s this excellent little diner that serves a great brunch. And after we could go to the beach, and—”
Tony glares at him. “You could have just picked up the phone and called me. You could have just…talked to me like a normal person! Does the thought of me giving you something make you that uncomfortable?” Tony demands. “The thought of you earning something, even if it’s more than you expected, really make you hate me so much?”
“Okay,” Tony says.
Steve blinks a few times. “What are you going to do about it?”
“How you doing, babe?” Tony asks quietly.
“Big tower with my name on it, can’t miss it,” Tony says.
Paul is taken by complete surprise when Steve’s hand wraps around the gun and it is yanked from his hand in less than a second. Steve throws the gun towards Tony and then he tackles Paul, and suddenly every ounce of pain Paul had ever inflicted on him rises to the top. Steve takes Paul to the ground, sits on his chest, and punches him once, twice, three times. He’s just as confused as Paul is. He’s not even sure this is really happening.
“I messaged that difficult client, you know the one, Paul. I told him I couldn’t keep our arrangement anymore, and he flipped out, and I’ve gotten all these really threatening messages from him. I don’t know what to do about it.”
“Sit down,” Tony commands, and Steve does.
To his Thursday through Sunday clients, he writes the same message: “I am sorry but I will be unable to meet with you again in the future. I’d be happy to help you find a replacement if necessary.” It seems appropriate, seeing as how most of their relationships were so casual that none of them will even notice he’d gone.
“What did he say exactly?”
Steve takes a shallow breath, lets it out, and then bites his lip. He doesn’t even realize he’s biting until Tony reaches over and touches his mouth gently. “Don’t do that,” Tony says.
It’s only three now, so they’ve got two hours before they need to leave for the art show. By the time they sit down on the couch, Tony’s intention is very clear for at least one of those two hours. He instantly tackles Steve, gets him on his back, kisses him hungrily.
“No.”
“Sorry I was up so late,” Tony says, barely above a whisper. “I had some work to do.”
hurt you!”
“Maybe next time,” Steve says carefully, not wanting to ruin the mood.
“So, what does an independent contractor do in his free time?” Tony questions innocently.
“Then I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“That’s because I told them to let you through.”
“Well,” Steve says slowly. “I came home and my apartment was trashed. It was Paul. What should I do?”
“Alright, that saves time. I’d need to be finished within a week so the varnish would have time to dry before painting.” He’s mostly thinking out loud, but Tony seems fascinated with his mental calculations. “I can start tomorrow,” he finally says. “If you can get the supplies delivered by tomorrow morning, I can come by and begin working.”
. The word just seems strange, foreign. Steve has never experienced a regular relationship that looked anything like what he and Tony are doing, and the ones he did have couldn’t have been classified as
Eventually they pull up at the tower and Tony drives into the garage. The guards wait until the garage door shuts behind them and then they begin to secure the perimeter.
Steve leads him around the house, pointing out random things like his empty pantry or the linen closet by the bathroom for comedic relief. He pauses in the doorway of his bedroom, trying to ignore the butterflies in his stomach. He’s never had someone else in his house like this; someone like Tony: Someone he cares about, someone he has sex with because they’re in a relationship.
Steve nods, but he quickly retreats into the bedroom so he can let the tears that are welling into his eyes escape. He turns on the shower quickly so that Tony won’t hear him sob. He eventually gets under the spray of water and hangs his head, trying not to think about what a failure he is.
When the children start arriving for the gallery preview, Steve goes to change into his suit. It felt awkward changing in the bathroom, but there was ultimately no other choice. He adjusted his bowtie in the mirror and gave himself another quick once-over before hurrying out and dropping his regular clothes back into the car. When he returned, he was greeted like a guest who belonged.
“I don’t drink,” he says.
Steve shrugs again. He’s freezing up, unable to think clearly.
“S-stop,” Tony breathes out. “I’m going to come if you don’t stop…”
It had been another rough week for Steve. Every week was rough, but lately things with Paul had gotten out of hand. He wasn’t sure he could keep him as a client anymore, especially not since he’d ended up in the hospital on Monday night. He’d managed to crack one of Steve’s ribs in the process of getting off, and it was more painful than anything Steve could imagine. The doctor wrapped his ribcage, but there wasn’t much else he could do besides rest. Which meant he had to cancel with his clients for the week. It was the first time he’d ever broken his availability and even though he knew most of them would be understanding, Paul would not be.
“I-I’m fine, Tony,” he says eventually. “I should probably get going.”
A few days go by and Steve uses the time to rest. He doesn’t allow himself to think of Tony, but instead just sits in front of a blank canvas with his hand pressed down but nothing appears no matter how much he tries. He becomes annoyed with himself and paces around the room, trying to find an imagine in his head that isn’t Tony Stark’s face.
Steve just rolls his eyes, but he smiles anyway. “This is home,” he says eventually. “Not much to look at, but it’s served me well.”
“I’ll finish the varnish on Wednesday,” Steve finally sends back. “You decide if you want it painted or not.”
Tony kisses him again. “Just tonight,” he promises.
“That’s good news.”
Steve’s eyes jump over there and see Tony with a glass of brandy gesturing for him to come over. His feet again do the thinking and he approaches the table.
He gets no response, and none was expected.
“I don’t want your money,” Steve insists. He presses the check into Tony’s hands. “Keep it. I don’t need it.”
“It’s a step further than the toast I can make,” Tony insists.
“Okay,” Steve nods, because it’s not that difficult so far.
“Good morning, Mr. Rogers,” he greets.
“I can’t keep it,” Steve says with a sigh. “I didn’t earn it.”
“I heal fast,” Steve says. “Always have.”
Steve sighs, biting his lip again. He can’t help it. The pain keeps him grounded, and right now, he just needs something to hold him together so he doesn’t fall apart in front of Tony.
“And then you sold a painting for a million dollars,” Tony finishes.
“Grilled cheese is hardly cooking.”
Steve is in such a good mood, that when he’s at the red light waiting to turn left about a mile from the tower, he doesn’t see the black SUV swerve out of the far right lane and intentionally smash into his car. He doesn’t even realize that something has happened until he sees his car spin into oncoming traffic, until he feels the impact of yet another vehicle hitting him from the side. He doesn’t realize that he’s hurt until he sees blood on the airbag in front of him, and broken eggs in the passenger floorboard of his car.
“Your face gets all cute when you think too much.”
Steve nods, sighing in relief. He’s not sure he could deal with being the cause of an accident and someone else getting hurt because of it. He’s a pretty careful driver. Always has been. He’s actually never been in a car accident before.
“Why?”
“Can I see them?”
He hadn’t actually been attracted to anybody for a long time. In his line of work, it was impossible to have any real relationships. He’d stop trying after developing the Thursday to Monday schedule, and it worked for him. But it wasn’t frequently that his dick stirred at the thought of someone who wasn’t going to pay him for sex.
“Tony’s home,” Steve corrects. “And he said he pretended to be a delivery service. Tony had ordered food.”
“Well, I’m sure the charity appreciated the donation,” Steve finally says.
Tony takes a step forward. He reaches up and touches the blood on Steve’s shirt, his finger brushing over the nipple by accident. Steve jerks back, not from pain, but from the contact. He doesn’t really know what’s going on, but he knows he probably should go. Right now.
Tony waves him off. “Me bringing a hot date to dinner is hardly the most scandalous thing I’ve done,” he says brazenly.
The next few days pass by too fast for Steve. He sees his clients by day, and at night he works on the sculpture. As promised, by the following Monday he is nearly finished. He only has minor detailing to add, then a varnish coat, and paint to finish it all off. All in all, he’s feeling pretty good about the deadline.
“I’d like to see that.” When Steve’s eyebrows raise, Tony adds, “Not that I condone violence, but sometimes, some people deserve what’s coming.”
Steve grins, and he finally pulls out a few items. He’s going to have to one-arm this cooking thing today, and the easiest thing he can think to make is a couple grilled cheese sandwiches. Quick, easy, and only requires one hand for flipping.
Tony drives as usual, and since Steve is still a bit weary of cars after the accident. He knows it’s extremely unlikely to be cornered again but he still lets his eyes wander around the streets in hopes that he
“Okay. Goodnight, if I don’t talk to you before then.”
It only takes a few more minutes before Steve comes. Paul gives him a final squeeze before getting off the bed and going to wash his hands. Steve sits up, trying to ignore the pain in his stomach, in his groin, in his nipple, when Paul comes back.
Steve watches Tony pull his wallet out of his pocket and hands the delivery guy a few bills, tells him to keep the change. He puts the food down on the counter and starts moving around in the kitchen, all the while with Steve watching him.
Tony nods, taking Steve’s hands between his own. “I’ll find him, don’t’ worry.”
“Okay,” he says. “Except, you’re covered in come and it’s sticky, and I really have to pee.”
He feels Tony stiffen a bit behind him, and he’s pretty sure it’s the first personal thing he’s ever revealed about himself. He’s not even sure why he mentioned it. It would have been so easy to just lie and say he’d learned to cook as an adult. It would have been so easy to omit his terrible childhood. But, for some reason, he felt like telling the truth. He wants Tony to know everything about him.
The drive home doesn’t take too long, but it’s long enough that the blissful feeling Steve gets while at Tony’s house is gone. The feeling of safety and security is also gone, and as he moves up the stairwell slowly, he is almost afraid to see his apartment again. It’s like this every time he returns home to grab supplies or clothes. He just
Steve hesitates before nodding. “What else should I do?”
“Goodnight, Steve,” Tony whispers, kissing him on the cheek lightly. He keeps his hand over Steve’s chest, hoping that it’ll be enough and he won’t wake up alone in the morning.
Steve shrugs shyly. “Maybe because people could see us?”
Tony’s face brightens though, seeming to actually appreciate that someone noticed that he creates things, and that Steve called it art.
Steve shrugs. “I’m busy catching up on doing nothing,” he says back.
“Not frequently. It’s been a while,” Steve admits.
Steve blinks a few times, trying to process the information. “Is it…over?” he asks.
Steve’s brain pauses for a second, because for the second time that day he’s struggling to decide what he and Tony are.
Tony has pictured it so many times. Paul hitting Steve’s car, then getting out and running away. It makes him sick just thinking about it. He can’t even fathom how many times Steve let the guy hurt him before it became too much. Tony had only seen evidence of it once before the accident, the night of their first kiss, and that was enough to make his blood boil.
“I can be there in thirty,” Steve says. “I’m hungry for real food. Then we can talk about what you’re having.”
Eventually, they’re able to move through the gallery with just a few people tailing them, and after a few more moments a set of guards pushes the stragglers aside so that Steve and Tony can walk together.
Steve stares for a long time before he dials his contact at the bar. He knows it’s early, that there’s probably no one there right now, but he’s relieved when it’s answered on the fourth ring.
Tony shifts, and some of his weight leans too much against Steve’s stomach, making him gasp in pain and jolt backwards again. And as quickly as the kiss began, it ends. Tony steps back.
He’s admitted almost immediately, and a valet comes out to greet him.
“I’m hungry for you,” Tony says back, so casually that it almost goes right over Steve’s head. He doesn’t get a chance to respond, though, because the elevator dings and the doors slide open.
“You drew the picture, I bought the picture, this is your cut,” Tony says, and he sounds frustrated suddenly.
Steve nods, feeling numb.
Tony gets up again, moving towards the bathroom to take a quick shower. He beckons for Steve to follow him, and Steve does. Taking a shower together will certainly speed things up.
“I imagine the press will do plenty of that for us,” Tony says back. Steve nods, but then his face sets into a scowl that Tony doesn’t like. “What? You didn’t know the paparazzi would show up to an event that I was attending?”
His fingers trail along the scar, watching as Tony closes his eyes when he touches it.
“You could just skip it,” Tony challenges, and for a second Steve honestly thinks about doing just that.
“You’re fantastic,” Tony groans, holding Steve in place finally. “It’s been a while since…,” he trails off, his train of thought being interrupted when Steve brushes against his prostate. “God you’re so perfect,” he goes on.
It takes a moment, but Steve finally nods. “I was just thinking,” he says.
Steve nods again, and the elevator slides shut, and suddenly he’s alone in this big room. He takes a breath, trying to get in the mood to start shaping up the wood slab. He walks towards the pile of supplies and starts to sort out what’s what, moving what he doesn’t need immediately and standing finally in front of the slab with a pencil and a ruler in his hands.
Steve doesn’t respond, but Tony’s hands are still on his hips. He pulls him back again, kisses him again, and tries to deepen the kiss. Steve lets him, using his own hands to grip the sides of Tony’s jacket and pulls him closer.
“Yeah, look at us,” Steve says back, and he prevents himself from saying anything else by shoving pizza in his mouth.
Steve awkwardly handles the remote, flipping through the channels. He doesn’t watch much TV, mostly because he can’t afford it, so he doesn’t even know what’s out there. He eventually lands on the news where a reporter is talking about a generous donation made by the Stark Foundation to fund an LGBT college in upstate New York.
The guy has his own dick in his hand, too. He’s almost to the edge, almost there, almost finished.
Steve shakes his head no, but he doesn’t verbally respond.
“It’s okay, it’s okay.”
“I know. Thanks, Phil.”
“I like everything you do.”
“You’re bleeding,” Tony says suddenly.
“Having a good morning, Mr. Rogers?” the valet asks.
“You alright?”
“I’m sorry, I…,” Steve begins, but Tony silences him with a gentle kiss.
He doesn’t even think. He grips the check tightly in his hand and goes to find his keys. By the time he takes a breath, he’s already outside in his car, foot on the gas pedal, driving towards Stark Tower. He gets there in record time, and the guard calls Tony up to make sure Steve is welcome since he isn’t on the list.
“Who?” Steve asks, though it sounds like a dumb question because he already knows
Shrugging, Steve says, “I had more, but a lot of it got broken and thrown away.”
“You’re telling me there’s a check for almost a hundred grand just floating around somewhere out there, and you’re nonchalant about it?”
“Tony, I…”
“I’m too much of a wuss to do anything, anyway,” Steve shrugs. “All I can do is hope he gets tired of bothering me.”
It’s been a rare week for him, and today is a rare day. It’s the first day that he hasn’t had to be at a gallery to turn in his work for the show, and it’s the first time in a long time that he had met the deadline in advance. Tony had been pushing him to finish up the pieces for the show, and he was grateful for the extra encouragement.
“I’m not worried about
“Tony,” Steve says after about three minutes has gone by. “I am so sorry but I won’t be able to take you to breakfast. Something important came up.” His tone is terse, and the way his face tenses up when Tony walks over to him begins to worry Tony.
“Don’t lie, Steve. I know you ran off and made up stories about me.”
“Yeah, yeah. You could come with me, you know.”
Steve fumbles for his phone, dialing Phil’s number again. He feels numb, unsure of what to do. His mind is blank except for the fear that has replaced all other emotions.
When he arrives at the tower, the guard doesn’t even stop him, just waves him through the gate. A valet is waiting and takes his keys, and Steve assumes he’s cleared to just go to the ballroom again. When he gets up there, he’s surprised to find that someone must have come behind him last night to vacuum up the rest of the sawdust, because the room is pristine. Just waiting to be dirtied again.

“Hey babe,” Tony greeted him with a kiss. Steve would give everything to be able to feel those soft lips again and again and again, but he had to remember that this Tony had his own Steve and that his place was back in 2023 with his children. “I thought that you were wearing a different shirt, also, is it just the alcohol or is your hair longer?”

Happy Pride Month everyone! This month we will be holding fundraisers for Lgbt organizations that are dedicated to helping people who need it, more information about this will be on the avengers website. We will also be telling everyone our identities. None of the Lgbt Avengers are at all secretive about their identities, but the media seems to be insistent on ignoring any aspect of us that does not fit their definition of “normal”.

And if people tell you that you have to hide who you are to be accepted by society, they are wrong. Be yourself, be open about the problems that you face. Some people may leave, but that is okay, the people that truly care about you will stay by your side the who time.
People do that stuff to me all the time, even people who I think I can trust. I have had ‘friends’ before who have seemed nice, but then made some really ableist comment or joke about me being in a wheelchair
Look, he says that he is sorry and that he will pay you for it if you take back what you said earlier.
Hey, I thought that it would turn out better if I used the hammer, since I can use it to control the lightning. Tony’s exploded like five feet farther than mine, so . . .

Of course not. Don’t let anyone ever tell you that your mental illnesses aren’t real, people who do that are jerks and don’t deserve your time.
Turn on the flash for when you get notifications on your phone, that will be extremely helpful. Get hearing aids if you can, if you can’t that’s okay, but they are very helpful. Some people get service dogs to alert them, but they take a lot of money and time to train, so that may not be the best option for you. If you are with a friend, have them tap you on the shoulder or something to alert you.

You’re fine. When I first lost my hearing I was a kid and wasn’t able to get hearing aids because I ran away and didn’t have any money. I do have them now though, Tony made me a pair when I joined the avengers.

It is kind of weird, but the weirdness fades with time and you get used to it.

Tony was propped up against a price of debris. His arm and half of his face were burnt. He had saved them, but at what cost.
I just spent a week on a mission with the Avengers, and I can confirm that they are extremely weird.
I was probably being too loud. I usually have very strong reactions to major plot developments.
After the ceremony they played the message that Tony had left and for the first time Steve realized that he was on his own now. He had two kids to take care of, and if he was being honest, he had no idea what to do.

I heard Tony coming up from his lab and I decided to scare him, so I snuck into his bathroom before he got there and sat on the counter.

His screaming woke up Steve who tried to get up to see what was happening, but ended up getting tangled in the blankets and face planted before he could reach the bathroom.

You’re just some entitled jerk who thinks that he can tell me what to do. I can do whatever I want and you can’t stop me.

Not going to lie, but I’m kind of honored that an avenger is offering to give me hearing aids, but my doctor said that hearing aids won’t help. She did recommend a service do though.
Bucky Barnes @metalarmman
Bucky Barnes @metalarmman
That’s good.
Last week when Barnes thought he was home alone he asked Jarvis to play disney songs and he sang along while holding Fubar up by his front paws and dancing. Tony had actually been in his lab and when he came up for some food he saw them dancing and took a video of the whole thing and sent it to all of the Avengers. He’s not going to live that one down anytime soon.
Oh fuck. He found me, if I’m dead tomorrow you know what happened.
Loki @butterknives
Also, most of us will be helping out when we can.
Tony, Steve, Loki, Wanda, Clint, Natasha, and Fury. And it is the one that is a few blocks from the tower.
You can’t be lgbt, you are superheros.
Nick Fury @catstolemyeye
From my observations, Me Snuggles thinks that you are both excellent fathers.
Loki @butterknives
@mylawn stop harassing people, they are just trying to have a conversation. Your input is not needed.
What it humans had wings. Being able to fly would be so cool.

Sam Wilson @birdman
I lost a spiderman costume contests. To fucking Harley.
Babe, he’s hungry, just get him some food.
Egg @boi
No they didn’t. I’m going to be killed by a super spy smart enough to outsmart the compound security system.
I was woken up at 3:00 by my boyfriend screaming, I was worried.
Spiderman @friendlyneighborhood
I thought that people knew that I was deaf, it's not like I try to keep it a secret
It was a while ago. The government put it up for sale and I bought it.

You are the one who need who to be educated. Talk to any scientist for, like, five minutes, it will help. In the meantime, please never talk to anyone again until you have gotten a basic education.

You are disgraces to god and are all going to hell.
Egg @boi
She got up and asked me for a marker, then pulled a photo of herself out of her wallet and signed it, then gave it to me. I’m getting it framed. This is the best day of my life.
Why should we take action against something that doesn’t exist.

There was a giant that offered to rebuild the wall around Asgard for Freyja’s hand in marriage, we didn’t know that he was a giant at the time, so I convinced Odin to let him help because he would never finish in time, so he would never marry Freyja. He ended up being almost finished before the deadline we gave him, so I was tasked with distracting his horse so it could not pull the stones for him. The horse was not distracted by anything, so I turned into a female horse and seduced him.
No, you are wrong for saying that people should only celebrate Christmas. Many of my friends celebrate Christmas, but others celebrate other holidays and I wanted to include them.

Tony smiled up at him, “Love you too, take care of the kids,” his words were laced pain and longing.
They will also be open 24 hours a day so people who can’t ask for help because of abusive parents or partners. If you need it, please get help.

You guys didn’t age for like 70 years, technically you’re like 30.
Agreed.
It is pretty cool, not many people get to know what the Avengers order from McDonalds.
Nobody knows you as well as you do, be yourself and don’t let anyone else tell you otherwise. You are beautiful and amazing, no matter what anyone says.
Was no one going to tell me about Sebastian Stan. I mean the guy looks just like me and not one person thought to mention it.
Natasha Romanov @blackwidow
Nick Fury @catstolemyeye
Returning the mind and time stone to 2012 went smoothly. The ancient one thanked him and there was no one in the tower when he returned the mind stone. They must have still been saying goodbye to Thor before he and Loki left for Asgard.
Be gay, do crime, and write about the future to confuse historians.
Why not. It would be so much fun.
But how, did you steal one of my suits?
Tony Stark @youknowwhoiam
Bruce Banner @brucebanner
I do have some good stories, but the person to ask is @catstolemyeye, his job is knowing things about them that other people don’t.

The whole thing with the soul stone was weird. Both him and red skull just stared at each other, not saying anything.

Or did I
Sam Wilson @birdman
Thank you, your advice really helped.
I would say yes, but I would like to be alive tomorrow, so no.

We have to raise our son right. He will grow up to be the most powerful cat in the universe.

What happened and why did it happen at 3:30 in the morning
T’challa @theblackpanther
Yes. Also I came out from behind the couch. Narfi actually seems nice. Also ice cream with the cake would be appreciated.
I feel like this would have surprised me a month ago, but now I expect it. I swear the avengers are the weirdest people to exist.
It shouldn’t be that way, but you’re not wrong. I hope you have a better day tomorrow.
Natasha Romanov @blackwidow
I have a program on my phone that reads things out to me, so I don’t actually have to be able to see to know what you are saying.
Egg @boi
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Tony is going to kill me. And I didn’t even get the picture.
Shield agents are good at their jobs.
I feel betrayed. My girlfriend has a pegasus and she never told me.
Fine, but if he jumps on me when he’s done eating I’m pushing him onto your face.
I’m sorry dude, I guess I’m just the better spiderman.
I just saw @hawkeye do a backflip onto a railing, then do a triple flip into the pool. It was amazing.
Clint Barton @hawkeye
You didn’t have to try and run out of the bed. The bathroom is only ten feet away.
I am asexual and gay. In the red room they tried to make me straight. It was an awful experience that I hope no one ever has to go through, but people still do. I set up a fund against conversion therapy, the link to it is on the Avengers website.
James @thatsmyname
Don’t let anyone tell you your identity isn’t valid, it is your identity not theirs, their opinion doesn’t matter.
Tony Stark @youknowwhoiam
You are the entitles jerk who thinks he can risk other people's safety just because he thinks a dog is cute. And I can and will file a lawsuit against you for intentionally interfering with a service dogs work.
Spiderman @friendlyneighborhood
Off @mylawn
I wish I could be there.
Yeah, please don’t. Distracting a service dog could get someone seriously injured or killed. Even if the person doesn’t need the dog to survive, they still need it for something, and it is annoying and disrespectful to try and pet the dog without permission from the owner.
Babe, I’m sorry. I didn’t know how much you liked them.
Bucky Barnes @metalarmman
Then Tony came in, took the arrows, and flipped off the camera.
Avengers headcanons @canibeanavenger
It was a crime.
Spiderman @friendlyneighborhood
Tony Stark @youknowwhoiam
I guess I’ll see you there then.
Really. You could have at least said something.

Aw, that’s so sweet. But you are definitely the better dad.

Hey, don’t call me out. Crying is a perfectly normal reaction.

Wait, if you can shapeshift, can’t you just grow wings.

Everyone at Avengers tower is a complete idiot.
Nick Fury @catstolemyeye
@hawkeye how do you deal with being deaf. I just lost my hearing in an accident and I’m not sure how to cope with it.
Red @magicspells
The next week went by extremely fast and extremely slowly at the same time. They watched movies together every night. Peter usually crude himself to sleep before the end of the movie, so Steve would carry Peter up to his room before going to what had once been Tony’s room and crying himself to sleep there. And more often than not Morgan would crawl into Steve’s bed and curl up as smushed against him as she could get as soon as he went to bed.
Really!?
He used to yell at me for it, but I just kept turning off my hearing aids
That night the three sat in silence in the living room. That had planned on watching a movie, but it never happened.
You’re my boyfriend you should know that
Egg @boi
Can we have the video?
Steve Rogers @captainamerica
Valkyrie @iamking
I also woke up one night and saw Clint hanging upside down out of a ceiling vent, wrestling with my cape. Steve and Tony are also really loud go fish players. I am never playing cards with them again, they were both screaming.
Not get Peter a puppy without Steve and Tony’s permission maybe.
You’re not wrong, but it is still hilarious to see an extremely fluffy, 50 pound dog sitting on your shoulders.

I said I was sorry, but at least I haven’t tried to cook anything with lightning. Tony, Steve, Thor, and Bucky all tried to make pie with lightning last week.
It may seem eons away, but one day you will be able to come out and be your true self.

I’m sorry. If I buy you a cake, will that make it better?
They knew I was making pancakes and they chose to sleep in, so they don’t deserve pancakes.
He is my son and you insulted his potato guns.

We quit the avengers, Were going to the 1800s to be gay and do crime.
Happy Father’s Day @iamking, I’m still not sure how I convinced you to adopt a cat, but he thinks that you are a great dad.
Egg @boi
Okay, that makes sense, thanks for responding.
I live near the compound and I was sitting in one of the trees by the lake.

Bucky Barnes @metalarmman
He mainly stays on Asgard, roaming around the palace, but sometimes I bring him to Midgard, the spider boy loves him. I also find it hilarious when Tony forgets that he is there and screams after seeing a horse in the kitchen. He’s tried to convince me to not let Sleipnir in the tower, but he backed down when I mentioned Bucky’s service dog and that he is my son.
I was working in the lab with Tony when I remembered that I had a test
You are weak and can't do things that normal people can.
I was just trying to eat lunch and this lady came up to me and started making racist comments.
Sam Wilson @birdman
Steve Rogers @captainamerica
Yeah, but I was the one who convinced everyone. He mentioned it at a team meeting a few months ago and no one listened.
Happy Father’s Day to @youknowwhoiam and @captainamerica. You guys are great and I love you.
Nick Fury @catstolemyeye
I wish I could send a picture, but I value my life too much for that.
Avengers headcanons @canibeanavenger
Congrats, Mr. Stark. I’m so glad Steve finally asked, he had been freaking out about it for a few months, he thought that you were going to say no.
Bruce Banner @brucebanner
We are both the same as anyone else, we just have a few differences. But guess what, everyone has differences. Now I have some advice for you. Throw your phone off a cliff then go find a cave to live in, because you obviously aren’t intelligent enough to understand how to interact with other people. And Eva, I’m really sorry that people have been jerks to you today.
Spiderman @freindlyneighborhood
No problem. If you want to make more of an impact, contact representatives, support petitions against climate change, or boycott companies that actively ignore the problem of climate change.
