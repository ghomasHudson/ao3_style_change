Daddy was acting very weird today. Papa and everyone else were happy because Uncle Thor came to visit but Daddy seemed more upset than usual. So he took me to his lab and gave me a toy while he fixed something. It was really funny. It kept saying funny words and noises but I can only care about one thing for so long and I got bored but Daddy fell asleep. Maybe I should go find Papa. I would wake Daddy up but Pops says he doesn't sleep enough and needs all the rest he can get. So I walk out of the lab and into the room where the TV is. It's empty. Maybe Pops is in his room? Maybe I should just look for Aunt Nat. I was about to walk out when a voice spoke which is weird cause there wasn't anyone there so I turned around.
"How dare you! You are both idiots and that would be an understatement!" Her laughing expression soon drained and was replaced with irritation and anger. Nonetheless, she did technically deserve it and Tony didn't swear so I couldn't be mad. In addition, her brat also drenched Peter so, yeah. But while I had come to terms with it, she wasn't having any of it. Now I am a calm, peaceful, patient and understanding person and I could take all the insults in the world, but what I can't tolerate is when people insult my loved ones, let alone hurt them. So when she raised her hand at Tony, I was pissed. She was about to slap him right across the face, when I of course had to step in. I caught her hand mid air, it was like something out of a soap opera where dramatic music would be playing in the background right about now. The expression she held was the definition of priceless.
Soon, Steve came back and saw we were still eating. So he grabbed the boxes, all of them and yanked them away from us.
Summary:- Peter is two years old and lives in Avengers Tower with everyone else. Also Loki isn't bad(yay) and hangs out with the avengers.
Tony sighs, "I was drunk, you know how I am when I'm dr-"He's using drunk as an excuse? Aw hell noooo!
"...my brother is being coronated and I'm afraid taking him away from such an auspicious event with not go down well with my father, no matter how big the crime. We will have to wait a week or two."
"What's wrong with you?!' I yelled at her. I mean wouldn't you if she crushed a glass in her hand and beer fell all over your new Armani?!!
"Did you take Peter out of the tub?" Tony hoped this was the case but seeing as to the fact there was no child anywhere around him didn't calm his nerves.
"Thanks, Clint made them and traded out my entire wardrobe." Clint! Damn it, lost the bet with myself. Eh, I'm still rich af so I don't care.
"I cannot believe my brother has done such a thing! And he has kept his scepter! OUTRAGEOUS!" God, get an inside voice! Jeez!
"Yeah, just too startled to react so my brain didn't work and I forgot J. A. R. V. I. S. existed." Didn't think that could be true.
Yay, another one bites the dust! I'm happy cause this is the longest one I've written and I'm very proud. Peace out.
"Are you okay?" I realised I wasn't the only person in the room, and look up to see Steve standing there with an outstretched arm and a glass a water.
"I am sorry but I cannot do so..." Thor picked up his hammer and placed it with the children since they seemed to find it interesting.
"Praise the Lord!!" This time it was me who stumbled back. Well wouldn't you?!!? I had hair until like my belly button and the whole thing looked like a ga pride flag!!!! There is not a colour in this world that isn't in my hair right now! I'm not even kidding.
"Steve." He dragged his voice a little, probably trying to evoke pity, wasn't going to work. "It's just that I-" I put my hand up signalling him to stop. I had enough. This wasn't the first time we had to cancel plans for work and it wouldn't be the last.
Trick or treating was loads of fun. It hadn't changed a lot but the costume choices definitely took a turn, in my day, when trick or treating had only just started, people just dressed up as professions but now, there was a much bigger variety like TV stars, animated characters and I'm proud to say, even Avengers. There were quite a few Captain Americas and there were as cute as hell. Thankfully we weren't recognised. We didn't want to create a commotion on Halloween. There were so many cute kids, and the atmosphere was buzzing with excitement. We hit every house on the street and we were on our last. We opened the door to a very grumpy looking lady. I assumed it was part of her character so I was polite nonetheless.
After it was over, he tucked me in but a little while after I could hear the growl of his motorcycle before it faded into the distance. I called Dad up and told him how the night went and asked if Pops was at the tower where I thought he would be after looking through the album and willing to accept Dad's apology like Dad had planned. But he wasn't which is when I started panicking but Dad told me to calm down and said he would take care of it so I hung up and went to sleep. No I didn't, I facetimed MJ. No one goes to sleep at 10:00pm. Pfft.
"JARVIS, it's Tony. Trust me," he said. "Please just run the full body scan for him. We need to find out if there're any potential issues we need to be made aware of."
"Oh, my god," she breathed out, amazement coloring her voice. "Tony, you—" She looked up at him, and the wonder turned to slight confusion. "This isn't weird, is it?"
He leaned down and picked Olivia up from the carrier, and she began to fuss and squirm some more the moment she felt Tony's hands on her. "Yeah," he said and held her against his chest, "you're putting on an act for me. I know. All right," he said and patted her bottom. "Yeah, you feel like you need a change. Come on. I'll get you cleaned up and then we can test out some of that wonderful formula."
The four seated at the island just stopped mid-motion and turned to him, all varying degrees of 'Are you kidding?' playing out over their faces.
"Because this isn't my 'new identity.' This is… Look, it's hard to explain. It's impossible to explain. I wouldn't even know where to begin. Just— I am who I say I am, so just finish filling out the forms, sign whatever you have to, give us our license, and we'll be out of your hair. Trust me, Tony Stark is
Tony reached up and put his hand over Steve's mouth to quiet him. "My god, Steve! You'd swear you'd never seen me masturbate before."
"Don't care," Steve reiterated and guided Tony over to the bed. "Where do you want me? Do you want me to stand? Sit? There's a chair over there. I can sit—"
"No," he said without a thought. "Am I more nervous now? Maybe. But I'm not disappointed. How could I be?" He shrugged. "She's ours. She's you and me. We made a baby together. How could I be disappointed in that?"
," Steve had said purely on instinct, the tone slightly chiding. Very little of what Tony had said had made sense.
Warmth and happiness flooded Tony's body at that, and against his will, he found his eyes welling up with tears as Steve continued to caress his arms.
The man had a grip. He tried to jerk his wrist away, but Steve didn't give, and Tony looked up at him and, mustering all the fight he had in him, said a very succinct, "Let go of me."
Tony turned and saw the entire pajama-clad brood filing into the room one after the other: Natasha followed by Barton and Wilson and Barnes (who kept trying to get around Wilson only to have his way blocked each time) and Bruce (who at least appeared to have shaved since he'd drained blood from him) with Thor bringing up the rear. He frowned at them, watching as they all situated themselves around the island, taking what Tony had come to realize were their 'usual' spots, and he folded his arms and said, "What the hell are you people doing here?"
"Yeah," Wilson said, holding up his phone like he was either taking pictures or recording, "but you're supposed to do this sort of shit at weddings."
But clearly not, as it turned out. It was an impossibility. Bruce had already confirmed that this morning, and besides, that little girl had had a 'papa' that she'd loved dearly, a 'papa' that had been nearly identical in appearance to the way Tony had looked before all this had been done to him. It didn't matter that that Steve Rogers kissed the way his did or cradled his head the way his did. It didn't matter that that little girl was
Once the table was cleared, the wait staff brought out plates and forks and the rejected wedding cake Hill had bought for them the day before, and Steve once again reminded them that they
—" one of the hosts started to say, and Tony rolled his eyes at the bullshit that he thought had been laid to rest a long time ago. Fuck's sake, they had come out as
. I just wish he'd stop trying to pretend the last seventy fucking years didn't happen. I'm not saying we can't talk about the old days
"It doesn't change the fact that, if you wanted to wrap these gifts, it's much more economical to wrap it in newspaper."
— I guess during the war. I woke up, um, in the future. I spent a day in the future with you and with, um, a little baby named Olivia. I think she was probably about a year or so. Cute little thing. Stubborn as a mule—"
"I was just thinking," he cut in before Steve could get too nervous, "that every time you do that — every time you come inside of me — all I can think is,
Tony hedged a little and pushed in between the staring contest going on between the two. "Yeah, you know what? I think I'll get Wilson's breakfast for him."
Tony swallowed and looked at the slice he held in his hand, remembering how she folded it with both her small hands and took one solitary bite before she put it down and began to pull the cheese off because 'Daddy' would eat what she didn't eat. He glanced up at Steve, who was already halfway done with his first slice, and though his stomach gurgled, he suddenly found his appetite gone.
He went back to stirring, but Rhodey must have seen him falter just the slightest, as the next word out of his mouth was a mournful, "
The scents coming from the kitchen turned his stomach once more, but he knew Steve was just being Steve and was trying to do nice things for him, so he left the bedroom and stumbled down the steps to the living area, and he walked past the couch and made his way over to the kitchen.
"I now understand," he said and looked at Pepper, who was looking at him like he was something stupid and precious and naïve.
Tony eyed him over, and he nodded and said, "I see," before he turned and left, leaving Steve to wonder what in the hell had just happened.
"No, there's nothing to worry about. You're in here under assumed names. They're just going to think someone was pulling my leg and I was too gullible not to believe it." She looked back up at Steve and said, "What about your medical history? Ailments, surgeries, allergies—"
He didn't stick around to see if Steve actually did drink it, and he never asked. Some things were better off not knowing.
Tony reached out and slapped a hand over his mouth. "Steve, stop it. I get that you feel guilty, and I understand that you're sorry, and I appreciate that you'd take this burden on yourself if you could, but you moaning about this isn't helping any. And I know I'm calm now, but that's because Nat makes killer cup of chamomile, and trust me, when the reality of this finally hits me, all the chamomile in the world isn't going to keep me from going insane."
"OK, first of all, that's everyone's presents. Second, we can afford it. Third, it's her first Christmas, Steve!"
Tony smiled. He wanted to believe that. Really, he did, but now that the genie was out of the bottle and Steve knew the truth, he wasn't sure that he would ever not mourn the loss of what might have been, especially since Steve had kind of seen what he'd seen—
Steve laughed and rubbed his arms some more, but Tony saw a little element of doubt still clouding those clear blue-green eyes of his. "OK," he said, soft, gentle. "OK, we can do that."
"Hmm?" Tony asked as he held out a flute of champagne-colored carbonated beverage to him. "Nothing. Just something a little stupid, I guess."
He'd avoided meeting the Capsicle at any point before he absolutely had to because, well, because he was still a little embarrassed about leaving him out in the cold and he still fucking hated the man's guts for ever having existed. The embarrassment completely dissipated once he finally met the sanctimonious prick, who seemed to hate Tony on first glance just as much as Tony hated him. Why he hated Tony immediately was beyond him, though he figured 99.99% had to do with the fact that Tony wasn't Howard.
He grimaced as he pulled the bread out and closed the cabinet door. "Don't take this the wrong way, babe, but the smell of it is really not sitting well with me."
They rode the elevator in silence until they arrived at their destination, and Tony pushed to the front and stepped off first as soon as the doors opened, and he turned back around and said to Steve, "Look, if you don't like it, I can change it back. It's no big deal. But I just thought... I don't know."
She leveled him with one of her unimpressed looks, which weren't nearly as amusing or guilt-inducing as Steve's were wont to be.
"Honey, if this is about your guilt, you need to stop it. He doesn't blame you — not so far as I can tell, anyway. But he wants to move on. He wants to live in the present — it's much better for him, seriously. And yeah, sure, maybe you can reminisce every now and then, but don't live in the past. And you really think you don't have anything to talk about? Tell him about how you got mixed up with the Avengers. Tell him about Loki. Tell him about our little adventures with Killian and Pierce. Tell him how much you secretly hate Brooklyn and going back to Brooklyn because of how much it's changed. Hell, bitch to
The other three gathered around Natasha, looking over her as they examined the photograph with their own eyes. Thor nodded in approval and said, "Our Steven bears quite a resemblance to his father," while Bruce took the folder from Natasha and looked it over, inspecting it as he turned it over in his grasp.
"Hey, string bean, what are you doing up?" he asked and looked around for a clock to see how long he'd been caught up in his work.
Steve had spent his entire life waiting for the right partner. He'd been good, done his penance, and patiently waited for that person that he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt he was going to spend the rest of his life with. There was a time that felt like yesterday to him but was really several decades ago that he had tried to convince himself that that partner was none other than Peggy. She was smart, she was beautiful, and she was more than willing to call him out on his bull. She was everything he could have ever hoped for and more, and he wanted — oh, he so very much wanted — her to be the 'right partner.' And she could have been. He knew she could have been. He could have been happy. He knew he could have been happy.
Tony stood up from his computer, and if Steve didn't know any better, he'd say he was almost nervous, toying with one of those electronic rectangular things that were so prevalent. "A coffee. You know. It's what people drink. When they talk. With each other." He shrugged. "It's just a thought."
"Yeah, that's enough of that," he said, the mere thought of 'morning sickness' putting to bed any hunger pangs he might have had.
He went to argue that the other songs he'd tried to introduce Steve to were just as old, but he let it slide. It was easier that way. Steve would just find some way to talk his way around it again.
not have used protection like we should have— But in our defense, it's not like we ever had a need for it before all this, which is probably too much information for some of you, but whatever."
Steve chewed his food a moment before he looked up at Tony. "We're going to have to think about expanding."
Someday, he was going to take away their access to the penthouse. It would just be him and Steve allowed up here, and they could walk around naked all day every day and have sex on every single surface available. It would be awesome.
to…" He swallowed and stole a quick glance at Tony. "Tony has to see this through to the end if he wants to live."
"I think it's something we should be mindful of," Steve said, catching both Tony's and Nat's eyes and silently exhaling in relief that they both appeared to be in agreement with him. "We know we have to get Loki's scepter back. We know it potentially has one of these stones in it. It's not impossible to think there are others out there."
He walked in between the back bumper of the Audi and the front bumper of some piece of shit that didn't even have a front plate on it and stepped onto the sidewalk. He walked the twenty feet down the block to the shop's front door, peering inside through rose-tinted glasses to see how busy it was.
to refute it because he really, really, really wanted Steve there with him, and he shuffled off to the bathroom adjacent to the lab and closed the door behind him.
He nodded and tweaked a smile at her pronouncement then frowned as he realized that, like clockwork, he had to pee. Again.
"Yeah, so's getting shit on by a bird. I think whoever came up with that was just trying to make themselves feel better for their miserable life," Tony said and followed Natasha onto the elevator, the others crowding in behind him.
"Yeah huh," he said and set the iron to cook again. "Just like that pizza you chowed down the other night. Taste it."
He moved over to meet up with Steve, and Steve reached out and snagged an arm around Tony's shoulders, pulling him into a half embrace and leading him out of the kitchen.
"You tell Steve about this," he said as he went into the kitchen and over to the coffeemaker, "and I'll let Barton use your main server for target practice."
"Well, the price definitely is," Hill said and turned the tag over to reveal a price of around $1400. "But for last-minute, there's not much you can do."
"For this sort of thing?" Steve murmured, disbelief evident in his voice, and Tony shot a glance at him and said, "Well?"
Steve just glared at him a little, jaw set and teeth gritted together, but Tony saw in his eyes something that looked a lot like resignation — like he knew Tony was right but that didn't mean he had to be happy about it.
Tony hummed and said, "You're forgiven this— Baby, what are you—? You can't just take from the bottom of the pile like that."
And the only Christmas movie he could think of where Bing Crosby did anything that remotely resembled tap dancing was Holiday Inn, and that was with Fred Astaire not with...whoever the other person was. The name kind of sounded familiar, but he couldn't place a face to the name.
He didn't know if it had done the trick, but at least Steve didn't seem to be holding it against him if the way he put his arms around him after that was any indication.
Soon, the open spaces of the outskirts gave way to the congestion of a downtown, lights and traffic and decorations as far as he could see. Tony swung the car around a few blocks then pulled into a parking space at an angle, the curb and a parking meter directly ahead of it. He whistled a bit as he shut the car off and popped his door open, and Steve followed suit — almost strangling himself with that seat belt-thing in the process — and watched as Tony ducked into the backseat to grab the baby and then something he'd previously called a 'diaper bag.'
And complete and utter relief that he wasn't going to have to save Steve from himself again. Maybe Barnes wasn't so bad after all?
Steve just shook his head and bit back a smile as Tony carried the baby out of her room. Steve followed, making his way downstairs just behind Tony, and they came into the festively-decorated living area. Tony hummed happily and said something about getting the baby something to eat, but Steve stopped in the middle of the room and eyed the giant waste of money that surrounded him.
"Hmm? Nothing." He tugged on Tony's hand a little to get them to walk a little faster. "Come on. I'm not sure how much longer I can last out here."
In fact, when they all started to trickle out later that evening, Tony was actually sorry to see them go, and after the last one had left, he frowned and sank into the couch cushion, Olivia resting in the swing Steve had assembled earlier that afternoon, and said, "You know, they could have stayed."
The apples of his cheeks had tinged pink, and he still refused to look at Tony as he said, "I guess — I mean— We never even discussed if we were really going to
"But you'd rather chase after your precious little Bucky. Because finding your pal and being with your little pal is a much more enticing prospect than putting up with me."
"Only to be used in a case of actual emergency." He flopped down hard on the chair. "What do you want, Capsicle?"
leaned into Steve's side, and the fluttering subsided again just as Rhodey asked, "You going to let us all get in on that or are you playing favorites?"
"Just the one," Steve said, and Tony held his gaze a moment longer before he sat back down and took another bite of the jelly-slathered toast.
Natasha stayed behind with Pepper and the PA, but Steve followed them over, and arms folded tight against his chest and hands tucked into his armpits, he looked around the setup and over to the doors to the conference and said, "You know, you really don't have to do it this way."
Steve just reached out a hand for Tony. "We'll figure something out. Come on. It's early enough. We'll take a nap and order Chinese or something."
could also be taken away, and Steve was no stranger to closing his eyes one moment and opening them back up the next to find many, many years had passed him by. When it had first happened, when he had first woken up, he would worry every time he closed his eyes that he'd open them again to find himself displaced in time once more. He'd...sort of struggled a bit with sleep at that point. Told himself it was because he'd slept for seventy years and was well-rested enough, but that wasn't the real reason. No, the real reason was because he was afraid if he did fall asleep, he'd wake up to find another seventy years had passed him by, and he just...didn't want to have to deal with that — to attempt to reacclimate to another time once again. He supposed he could do it, if given no other choice, but he sure wouldn't be happy about that.
He shook his head to clear his mind of those thoughts — later, he'd worry about that later — and went over to pull the blankets up for her.
"Tony..." he said as Tony pushed away from the table and got up. "You know I didn't mean it like that."
, especially in my hips. And my breasts, seriously, believe it or not, more comfortable to leave the bra
Steve did a quick calculation in his head — clearly she meant to heavily imply that their next child would be born around Christmas — then said, "So, sometime next year?"
"I wish I could," he said then glanced down to where Natasha was blowing onto Tony's toes to get the coat to set. "You going to be much longer or…?"
Steve shrugged. He honestly hadn't really thought about it in those terms before, and now that he had, he...still wasn't all that bothered by it.
He must have fallen asleep not long after he'd curled up on the couch because he awoke to the most glorious scent of broiled steak and potatoes, and when he opened his eyes and looked out at the vista beyond the plate glass, it was evident the sun was beginning to set. He yawned and sat up, and he rubbed at his belly a little then pushed himself up. How long had he been out for?
"Oh, yeah, it was, like, a '70s thing. People started putting the pot in brownies for some reason, then they'd eat them and think they were getting all high and shit at their 'swingers parties' or whatever the fuck people did back then."
He slid the box over to Tony, and Tony pulled it close and began to inspect what was collected inside. It wasn't much — one, a five-by-seven black-and-white glossy of what looked like a very young Steve and Bucky. Steve was in a cap and gown, something rolled up and tied with a ribbon in his hand (Tony presumed it was a diploma). Bucky, taller, cockier, was leaning onto him, arm around his shoulders. It was hard to tell, there wasn't much to discern, but it looked like it was taken in a back garden of some kind, fencing and tenements blurry in the background. Tony looked it over a little more before he turned it over, spying in pencil '
"I don't know," Rhodey said, "but this waffle is actually pretty decent. I'm impressed, Tones. You're not actually an awful cook when you put your mind to it."
"What good would it have done?" Steve muttered. "He knows who I am. He knows… And he still walked away. He chose to walk away." He shook his head some, in disbelief, in disgust, or maybe some combination of the two. "I can't stop him from choosing to walk away."
He sighed out a breath and stared out the window beside him, watching the traffic pass as he rubbed a protective hand over his belly. He really did wish his mother was here to see this — wished his mother could meet her grandchild. His mother would know what to do about this. His mother would know what to do about all of this. She could probably even give him some pointers about this whole...exercise of sorts. Because whether he wanted to admit it or not, he was going to be a mother himself. He had no choice in the matter, and technically, 'mother' was the proper term. He was pregnant. He was going to have a baby.
The collective shrug he got was all that he needed, and he pulled at his shirt and unhooked the cup and pulled the baby to his breast, Olivia latching on without a fight.
"Not himself," Tony finished. "Doesn't know me, doesn't know you, doesn't know anything about what's going on here."
"This is something we have to work on. You know why?" he asked and traced his fingers over the cloth-covered flesh. Tony shivered at the touch. "That's why," he said like it explained everything. "You are incredibly sensitive on your belly."
"—that'll be our first stop, OK? We'll go back and see your mom, and you can show off this gorgeous body that you picked up in your travels— oh, and probably show her what science was able to do for your body, too."
"Hmm...well, the more you know," Tony said with a shrug. "Think she would have gotten a little frustrated once she realized she couldn't get anything out of you. Let's face it, she's got your appetite."
"Hmm...that's not entirely true," she countered. "You're not bulletproof. I highly doubt you would survive decapitation—"
"Don't mention it, babe." He leaned down and pressed a kiss to the crown of Steve's head. "You know, I wish Jarvis — the real Jarvis — could have met you."
Weirdly, while Tony had barely had a moment to himself the past couple days when Steve and the others were gone, the parade of visitors had completely ceased to exist as soon as Steve had made his return.
"I can imagine," Steve said then added, "It was only a dream. You know that, right? Strucker's not getting his hands on you, and he's definitely not using you to…breed a pack of super soldiers for him."
"Not about the projects," she said as he swiped through some screens and brought up some specs for… What was it he was looking into doing again? Steve's shield, wasn't it? Wasn't he thinking about putting in some magnetic relay so Steve wouldn't have to go and chase after the damned thing when he didn't swing it at the right angle for it to rappel back the right way? Fishing in the Potomac for it
"Cap's idea," Barton said without turning around. "Said it would build morale and team spirit and all that shit if we spent all our time together. Blame him."
" She shrugged and shook her head some, as though that would suffice for an answer. Tony shook his head some to match her befuddlement before she added, "He
"And I wish to extend to you that when your bonds have severed and those that you call family have long since passed, you are more than welcome in the halls of Asgard to spend your days..."
He reached out and took hold of one small foot and played with it a bit, and she took her eyes off Steve for a moment to look over in his direction and, as brown locked in with an identical shade, like a bolt of lightning hitting him from upon high—
"So," she said and blew on his nails some, "have you decided? Are you going to have a nice, soothing home birth? Or maybe a water birth?"
"I know," he murmured and closed his eyes, bracing his hands on Steve's shoulders for balance. "Fuck, that feels good."
Steve shook his head a little, but there was a smile on his face as he did so. He was pretty sure the 'Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice' crack had gone over his head, though. "Anyway," Steve said, "if I got my way, that would get us to at least ten."
Steve murmured a disbelieving, "Oh, my God," under his breath, and Jane stuttered a few words then said, "There's a
"Thanks," he said and let Barton help him up. He grimaced as he set weight on his left leg, and Barton noticed and raised an eyebrow at him.
Barnes simply squeezed his shoulder. "Don't fuck it up, all right? He's so far gone, I'm not sure what he'd do or what would happen to him if you…"
Bruce was silent another beat before he said, "I still don't think it's a good idea, Tony. She's not the same Olivia. I mean, I'd thought this entire time that she might be… But clearly based on, well, circumstance, she's not."
Actually, Tony was not all that opposed to people finding out — well, sort of. Maybe he wasn't too thrilled at the idea of people finding out that Tony Stark had been turned into a woman, but a few news cycles dedicated to the uproar over Captain America marrying someone that sure didn't
of the matter might, um, scare you off." Steve just stared at him, watching, waiting for him to continue, and he scratched at his jaw and said, "
"He wasn't going to, J!" he shouted and checked his speed, as he realized he was catching up to the traffic ahead of him rather quickly. He lessened the pressure on the accelerator. "He wasn't getting back in the car, J," he said, calmer but a little sadder. "You've heard what he's said about his pal. He'll stick by him 'til the end of the line. Ever heard him express anything similar about me?"
Steve rolled his eyes as Tony pushed a mug over to him. "I think she needs some teeth before she can chow down on a steak."
Tony did purr at the feel of Steve's knuckle rubbing against his clit — though he'd deny it was 'purr' until he was blue in the face — and he ran his hands up to Steve's shoulders and braced himself there as he said, "You're the boss," making sure to give Steve an adequate view of his cleavage. Steve's gaze zeroed in right where Tony wanted it to before he got up, standing to wiggle out of the lace panties, resorting to having to unhook then re-hook the garters, before he climbed back on top of Steve, who had already deposed himself of his clothing.
Tony glared at him as Steve took a gentle hold of him and pulled him to his feet. “What else would you call it, Steve?” he asked as Steve worked at untying his arms. “She is blocking your cock from being in my mouth.”
"Tony, may I ask," Doctor Ganford said once Steve had pulled his hand back, "have you accepted what's happening to you yet?"
"Th' only r'spons'ble one you say is Unca Sam 'cuz he's the best at being m'ture. You say all th' others are like the loony ticks that ran away from the 'sylum."
"He always did have the attention span of a flea," Bucky said, and Steve rolled his eyes and crawled out from under the desk again. "Seriously, pal," he added as Steve sat down in his chair again. "Way to throw yourself on a grenade. You're an inspiration to everyone everywhere."
ridiculously narrow hips. "Tony, I'm sorry," he said, the tone earnest and forthright. "I didn't realize how badly this was affecting you. I talked to Thor. I went through every possible scenario I could think of with him. He doesn't seem to know of anyone or any way to turn you back. I'm sorry, Tony. I wish— I wish there was something more I could do."
"Buck, I want you—" he was saying as the met up with Tony. "Buck, I want— This is Tony," he said and pulled Barnes so that he and Tony were standing face-to-face. Tony stood as tall as he could and squared his shoulders a bit, and Barnes stared down at him and looked him over with those haunted and somewhat glassy eyes of his and croaked out, "Are you sure?"
"No, it's just weird. And annoying. You know what it's like having a head shoved into your bladder or what I can only imagine is a foot shoved into your rib? Or an arm shoved into your liver? Or something constantly drumming on your intestines?"
She scoffed and rolled her eyes. "I know that. What do you think I am? An idiot? You're bondmates, and I think perhaps the strongest I've ever come across on your Earth. I knew you wouldn't just weather this but would learn from it and grow from it."
have been helping set up the makeshift hospital, he also knew he wouldn't be any good to anyone at the moment. So, he did what he always did when he couldn't concentrate on anything else and his mind wouldn't relax enough to allow him peace and quiet. He tinkered.
"Of course it's Steve's!" he cried out. "But it's just…" He turned to Bruce. "You've gotta get it out of me."
Tony startled a little at the name, and as Olivia fought Steve again as best as a six-week-old could and Steve sighed and pulled the bottle away once more, Tony only then realized that he had been 'Mommy' over the course of the past six weeks.
Tony just gazed at him, head tilted, lips parted slightly, Styrofoam cup halfway to his mouth. He watched as Tony's eyes scanned the breadth of his face, like he was trying to read him, trying to figure out if he was saying what he thought he was saying, and for a moment — for just a moment — Steve saw that protective shell crack. He saw the mask begin to slide off. He saw that wide- eyed and idealistic man he'd fallen in love with all those years ago.
explanation, and so he scooted closer and put his arms around Steve and held close to him, and with his mouth by Steve's ear, he whispered, "You're mine, too, you know."
But Anthony would have none of it. Anthony's…bed linens were already quite warmed, as it turned out.
Women, as it turned out, had to be careful about that sort of stuff. The first time he'd sneezed with a full bladder had been a surprising and embarrassing wake-up call for him.
"Oh, my Captain," she said with a laugh, "there is more to life than trying to prove yourself useful to people that have long since passed. Perhaps you were given this for a reason, but it is not the reason you think. You are not an island. Nothing you do occurs — oh, what does your kind like to say? — in a vacuum. You are not the only person whose life is affected by your choices."
"So, here I am, forced to carry a pregnancy to term, which is…so absolutely frightening you have no idea.
Oh, but they had noticed, and they had drawn the same conclusion the other freeloading moochers had. It was a boy. They were having a boy.
with… But not in this instance. Not here, not now. It was a boy. It had to be. And besides, Steve wanted a boy, and if Steve wanted a boy, Tony would give him a boy.
. I can do this because I know I've got you at my back one hundred percent. And, if I'm being completely honest with myself, I'm…kind of
and Natasha, evidently sensing an opening with which to change the subject, looked up at Tony and said, a more open smile on her lips, "Feel better?"
a little upset about then — because I didn't…because so far as I knew there was nothing other than that that I could ever expect or hope for."
"I got caught. I got caught coming out of that café. I think she was a reporter. She knows it's yours. The baby. She thinks I'm still Natasha Carbonell, but she knows it's your baby. I— She tripped me up. I wasn't thinking straight. They know we were at the doctor's — the obstetrician's. They saw us. I accidentally confirmed it. And then I told her— I'm sorry, Steve. I didn't mean—"
He pressed his face into the pillow, soaking it with tears, until he heard a knock at his door, and he sniffled and wiped the tears away and tried to hide the evidence of what he'd done. He got up, struggling a little bit more than he'd like to admit, and went over to the door, and he turned the handle and schooled his face into something blasé and neutral as he spotted Natasha on the other side of it, a tub of chocolate caramel gelato in one hand and a spoon in the other. She held it out to him without a word, and he looked at it a moment before he reached out and took both items, and she took that as permission to enter.
"Yeah, well, let's leave the military branch dick-measuring for another day, yeah?" Tony said and looked between Steve and Jim. "It's Christmas."
He groaned again and steeled himself to sit up, turning onto his side and bracing his hands against the cushion beneath him to push himself up.
, "I'm not proud of it — and don't think I'm making a habit of this — but, uh, I kind of had to hit on him."
He grabbed his bagel off the island and reached over and pecked Steve on the lips. "Whatever happens, I want you to remember you brought this on yourself. I'm making reservations for eight tonight. Keep a watch on your phone for the details. And get Wilson to help you get dressed. I want you looking like a million bucks. Or a billion. Preferably a billion."
. Maybe it was because he still wasn't convinced this was happening to him or he still didn't think he would actually have to go through with it, but he spent most of his time giggling and not being able to listen to either the nurse
"Oh, he's fine," Esmeralda said and waved off his concern, the sleeves of her gown shimmering in the light.
Steve took a step toward her. "What's that supposed to mean?" he asked, something dark and intimidating in his voice, and Tony glanced over and saw he was letting the baby suck on his pinky finger, her tiny little fingers curled around his much larger and stronger ones.
"I love being Iron Man," Tony said, sort of like he was answering Steve's question but mostly like he was still caught up in his own thoughts. "I love — It's the first thing in my life that I've ever done that I'm actually proud of."
Bruce hesitated but led Tony off onto the floor. "I really don't know how the Other Guy would take that, Tony."
. The King could take a candleholder to bed, and the Council, neither the Church, would not care much so long as he produced a legitimate male heir to the throne. But the King seemed to have no interest in producing an heir and securing his line and, thus, securing the continued peace and prosperity of the land his father had worked tirelessly to forge into one united kingdom. King Anthony was too busy cavorting with his high chancellor to bother with that.
"Nothing," Natasha said, waving the remote control in the air a little bit. "Tony's just looking for excuses to track down Steve."
Tony watched as Steve let out a heavy and frustrated exhale of breath, but Tony folded his arms and said, "I already let you have your way with the boy's name."
"Tony," she said like she was trying to contain herself, hands fisted at her sides and teeth clenched, "get her away from me,
That was something he should have known, and had it been anyone else going through this, he would have had it figured out the moment after the test had come back 'positive.'
Tony and the Spy Twins turned to see Steve, already dressed and ready to depart, strolling into the lab. Concentration was etched over his face as he set his gaze on Tony and said, "Tony, we—"
And then came the weird part with the angel and the chance to see what life had been like if the character had never been born, and Steve glanced over to Tony who, Olivia now sleeping against his chest, murmured, "We watch it every year. The one year the whole team watched it, and for a week, all you could hear around that tower was 'hee haw!'s and 'hot dog!'s."
Tony just stared at him a moment, his lips pursed like he was fighting between arguing the point and admitting Steve was right.
"Yeah, I know," Steve said, sounding downright miserable at that fact. "So, how do you want to do it?"
"You really want to know what I think?" Steve asked, his voice low and hitting an octave that was usually only reserved for their most lustful and debauched of trysts.
cradle." He looked down at the baby in his arm. "Which is kind of weird terminology to use considering the circumstances."
Since he figured trying to explain the concept of a 'date' to a four-year-old would be headache- inducing, he just said, "Oh, just out. He'll be back, don't worry."
"Also, I forgot to mention to you before, but you are a hot slice of beefcake, and I should probably watch my back because there are women out there that would sell their souls for the honor of being knocked up by you."
"Good," Steve said, unable to stop a grin from spreading over his lips. "Because I like to be the big one."
"Yes, of course," Thor said easily. "It is unfortunate that the average life on Midgard is so short. Asgardians, as you know, live for thousands of years. Your lives on Midgard exist in but the blink of an eye for us, as you will eventually come to find out."
," she said in that gentle way she had when caring for her loved ones and put her hands to Tony's shoulders.
The creature began to stir again, and once more, Steve held his breath and hoped the man — good God, it was a man — would fall back into slumber. But his hopes were dashed as the creature groaned deep in his throat and uttered exactly one sentence:
. Steve hadn't been moving on; Steve had been looking for replacements. Tony was a replacement and, until he'd been turned into this, a shitty one at that.
Tony turned to Bruce and the doctor. "If you figure it out, don't tell us. We'll wait and be surprised."
Steve merely tsked and shook his head as Olivia continued to babble into the phone. "You know," he said and brushed his hand over the top of her head again, "just because it's supposedly a little out of its time doesn't mean it's bad."
But JARVIS didn't have time to respond, as there was suddenly a weird hum followed by a crack and a flash, and Tony jumped back as an amber-colored portal opened in the middle of his lab, and a child with blonde hair shot out of it like something had pushed it through. The kid hit the floor and slid back toward Tony's worktable, and as the child lay there dazed a moment, the hum stopped, and when Tony looked back up again, the portal was gone and the weird crackle of energy had dissipated.
"Yeah, I picked," Steve said as he swiped to another page, but he side-eyed Tony and said, "That's a little fancy for sleeping, don't you think?"
She just grinned at him, like she was fighting to keep a secret but wanted him to know she had one to keep. "That when we next meet, I am allowed to say 'I told you so.'"
"Tony," he said and kneaded his fingers into Tony's flesh, "that's not… Listen to me. I… Yeah, I didn't handle that the way I should have, and I know you think that it's you, but it's not you. It's me. I'm not disgusted by you. God, how could I be? I'm angry at myself, Tony. That's what that was about. I'm angry with myself because I…did this to you. It's my fault this is happening, and I… I should never have let this happen. I should have had more control over myself. I should have stopped it before it got so far. But now it's all this and I just… I need to fix it, Tony. I need to figure out a way to fix it and make it better. I just…don't want to hurt you any more than I already have."
Tracy rolled her eyes. "He's your father. He raised you and took care of you, which is more than you can say for that asshole sperm donor."
A parallel universe — like something out of some science fiction mag or some pulp fiction thing. Crazy as it sounded, that was the only explanation that made sense. Because this Tony Stark was nothing like
As Steve let go of his hand, Tony reached down to his neck and hooked a finger around the silver chain that lay there, his diamond-and-sapphire band hanging from it. Steve glanced over and caught the motion before he turned back to the road, and said, "How come?"
"Yeah, how much of a sanctimonious pain in the ass he is. Which is a shame, because he's really got a great ass."
He left off what didn't need to be said, and he waited while Tony processed his, his chin wobbling like he was trying so very, very hard not to lose control of himself, and he blinked several times, averted his gaze, and then finally let out with the most venomous, "
Captain America and the woman claiming to be Tony Stark were — but he did catch a couple others directing nasty glares in his direction, as though angry that he wasn't taking this as seriously as they would like.
Steve merely shook his head, his gaze focused on the TV. "It's just a series of rape scenes and bad lighting. Do people actually enjoy these things?"
"My friends," Thor was saying the next time Steve was paying attention, "please trust me when I say that your romance is not in defiance of any law or tradition except for those which Midgardians impose on themselves. In fact, your being together may possibly be creating peace and harmony throughout the galaxy — perhaps as something that 'must be' in order for life as we know it to exist."
"Whatever you want," Bruce replied then made a face. "I really should go see what's going on with our temporary boarders," he added and glanced toward the door. "I don't want to leave you alone, but—"
Steve's face folded into a frown again. "Does it hurt? I'm sorry. You don't have to do that if you don't want to."
Three compliments, and not one comment about his breasts. This was verging on a record of some kind.
Natasha just fixed him with a flat look, but it surprised him that she let her guard down enough for him to see actual pain in her green irises, like she was painfully reminded of another time and place. She murmured something in Russian, but he didn't ask her to clarify, and she didn't translate for him.
"Really?" Steve muttered at Tony's word choice, but he wasn't honestly annoyed. Hell, he'd been using the phrase himself lately.
Thor nodded. "She sensed that our Man of Iron was bonded to another, and I believe she sensed to whom it was. It is why she cast her spell the way she did."
Tony shrugged and continued to toy with the stylus. "I love Pep, don't get me wrong. I just… I'm not sure we were ever meant to be anything more than friends. I think we tried to force something that wasn't meant to be."
Tony just swallowed and nodded, unsure of how to respond properly to that. "Duly noted," he said and tweaked a smile.
I could have been sort of classed as one on some technical level, sure. I've kinda been dry a while now, and I'm not really looking to fuck that up. My old man—" He clamped his mouth shut and shook his head then said, "My kid deserves a hell of a lot better than I ever got."
Well, two, to be honest. He had his Avengers family — those people that fate (and Nick Fury) had thrown together in what — if he was using the term correctly — was a 'Hail Mary' pass attempt to save the world. On the surface, they all seemed to have nothing in common, but time spent together — starting with that shawarma Tony had suggested — proved otherwise. Tony had opened the tower to them as a place to stay and a base to work from, and they'd started avenging in earnest — first sanctioned by SHIELD and then as their own entity once SHEILD had...ceased to be. For reasons.
"We're taking it one day at a time," Tony replied. "And can I say 'thank you' for not going with that one? Honestly, I think I'd take dead Aunt Millie's cake before some cutesy baby crap."
Steve barked out a laugh but said, "No. Very sweet lady, but no." He grinned at Tony and he reached out and snagged one of Tony's hands and gave it a squeeze. "I've already got everything I want right here."
"Not important. I'll explain later. But now?" He hopped off the table, his breasts bouncing with the movement, and he winced a little and looked down at himself before he reached up and put a hand to his breasts and said, "OK, maybe no jumping like this."
He snorted in derision as the doors slid shut. "Workshop, J," he said and waited for the car to arrive at the designated floor.
"—is an idiot that doesn't know how to express his feelings." She paused a moment then reached out and took a gentle hold of his right wrist. "How did he do this?"
He swallowed but didn't falter because he couldn't dare take that chance. "Then why are you still here?"
And then he felt two small arms wrap around his neck and a small, soft cheek press against his. He blinked and involuntarily put his arms around the small body, hugging it close and feeling a weird sort of protectiveness come over him. Six months ago, he wouldn't have believed anything like this could happen — that some kid would pop into his lab and claim to be his and he would believe it without several weeks of thorough analysis. But that was before dead super soldiers from the '40s had come back to life and gods from other realms had come to do battle on their planet and weird alien wormholes had opened up over the skies of midtown Manhattan. It was before he'd ventured into another world — something that still gave him nightmares and anxiety and he was
"All the more reason for you not to be an ass and show me what you're drawing. It better not be naked pinups of Thor."
Tony shrugged a little. "We've gone over it before, Steve. It's the way it has to be. Guess I really won't be able to leave the Tower now, huh?"
For only the briefest moment, he again felt guilty for the fact that he was enjoying himself so when Bucky was… And what about the other Commandos, now that he thought about it? Did they see the end of the war, too? Did they get to go home? Did they get to live their dreams as Steve seemed to?
Barton pushed his soggy cereal around his bowl some more. "Why don't you just donate them to a good cause like a women's shelter or something?"
And then he'd looked up, and Steve had been gobsmacked by the most beautiful brown eyes he'd ever seen, big and sharp and framed with inky black lashes. Pretty Eyes seemed equally smitten by him, his mouth going slack as he raked his eyes over Steve's form, but Steve, not wanting to get off on the wrong foot, had just said, "
"Don' ev'n star'!" Tony said through a mouthful of breaded chicken drenched in red sauce. He chewed a few more times then swallowed the bite and said, "I swear to god, Steve, if you knocked me up again—"
Tony shrugged a little and looked over at Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum. "So, does Thor know anybody that could do, you know, either?"
from an alternate universe. She'd said some strange things and referenced some strange things that just didn't make sense for how their world was set up. So, yeah, maybe she was under the impression that he was her 'papa,' but evidently her 'papa' and he were very similar in both appearance and personality.
"The serum," Bruce said. "I think— I think you have traces or some form of the serum in your blood, probably partially from what I can only assume was a large amount of unprotected sex?"
She made a face and said an actual, "Blech!" as she stuck her tongue out. "No. I want my Wucky Charms."
The doctor shot an understanding smile at Steve but turned her attention back to Tony and said, "While I'm sure your husband was very thorough—"
Tony exhaled a breath and sat back against the couch. Olivia began to squawk again, and Tony once more offered her his finger. It seemed to soothe her — at least for the moment — though he knew it couldn't last very long. Poor thing was probably starving, and here he was denying her anything but a sort-of pacifier to hold her over until such time as he could feed her.
"You're welcome," Bruce said, somehow sounding unsure — not that he didn't mean it but that he wasn't sure it was the right thing to say.
story," Tony said, "mostly involving magic and space goddesses — but don't use that term around Steve 'cause he gets pissy about it — and being 'soul mates'—" he used finger quotes on the term, "—with each other." And then, before she could ask anything else, he motioned to the prints that surrounded them and said, "So, what's this all about?"
an old Stark Industries facility upstate… He shook his head to clear his mind of that and instead changed the subject a little. "So, who are the Avengers now?"
He cut a candy cane into the dough, but Tony just continued to stare at him, a concerned look spread over his face.
Knowing what (little) he did of how the universe worked, and understanding that the world he called 'home' had been visited by beings from foreign worlds (outer space, he might have called it once upon a time), he wondered if, with that
But Tony just shook his head, and he grabbed hold of Steve's hand before he could tumble off the bed in horror and pulled him back, and as Steve blathered on about how sorry he was and how he should have asked and he should have made sure, Tony reached up and met his lips, kissing him, putting his arms around his neck to hold him close. God, he loved him. He loved this man so much. He didn't know what he'd done in a past life to deserve such a man, but he'd do it all over again just so that he could have him, so that he could have
He stood up from his seat and reached over the table to grab the phone away from Wilson, who gave it up freely and easily for him. Steve sat back with a huff and looked over whatever Wilson had up on his screen. Evidently, he hadn't been lying (and Tony already knew he hadn't been lying because he'd read that bio cover-to-cover several times over back in his younger days) because Steve just frowned and said, "I really don't think it's necessary to say that my eyes crinkle a little at the corners when I smile."
He did his business, and it was as he was about to get up from the toilet that he heard a couple women come in — tourists, he presumed, from their decidedly not-local accents — and one said to the other, "No, that's definitely him. That's Captain America."
Cap's lips thinned into a flat smile, one that didn't meet his eyes. And Tony could say that now because he'd seen what a Cap whose smile met his eyes looked like, and it didn't look anything like this sad specimen before him.
"Not sure you should do that," he said and closed his eyes as he tucked his head into the crook of Steve's neck. "I mean, if you burn the universe, where would we live?"
"Are you implying something by that?" he asked, one eyebrow raised in less question and more a challenge.
He turned around to model off the ensemble, and Steve nodded his approval and said, "It looks good. Very summery, actually. But still tasteful."
The witch only known as 'Wanda' had a reputation that preceded her. One of the last purveyors of the practices of her native land, the Red Witch (so-named for the crackles of energy that were purported to spring forth from her fingertips) dabbled in the dark arts. She was claimed to have spells and potions and incantations for just about any means of influencing or even transforming man or woman. There were
Steve tightened the hand he had at Tony's waist, pressing it more firmly into Tony's lower back, more possessively, and Tony's eyes shot open at the motion.
The next time he opened his eyes, Olivia was fussing in her carrier, and Tony was actually feeling halfway decent.
But the Cap just nodded a little, like he was absorbing Tony's words, before he said, "What was her name? Your daughter, I mean."
"I'm fine, Steve," he said, not even attempting the professional courtesy they usually kept to over the comms. For some reason, that blast really fucking smarted, and he wanted to hop out of the suit and grab some of that nice, white snow to use as a compress against his hip, but there were still a few goons hiding around, and no one needed to see a female Tony Stark exiting the Iron Man armor.
He could admit there was a tiny part of him that was elated and excited by this — ecstatic over the fact that he was going to be a father. But he was terrified, too. Not necessarily because he didn't know the first thing about being a dad — he didn't — but because he was an Avenger that lived in a tower of superheroes. He wasn't a guy that had a regular nine-to-five with weekends and holidays off. His job was dangerous — his life was dangerous — and he couldn't guarantee that he was always going to come home.
have been purchased from the maternity section of a store — picked out online and shipped discreetly to the Tower by JARVIS, of course. The blonde hair was a nice change, he thought, the color pretty close to Steve's, though it did clash a bit with his dark eyebrows. He combed the bangs down a bit in a futile attempt to hide the disparity in color and thought that he wasn't
The woman tsked and shook her head a little. "My, my, what would your Captain say? Oh, that's right. He's dead, isn't he?"
Hand still over his abdomen, he smacked his forehead against the ceramic tile wall. God almighty, why did Nick Fury ever have to come into his life?
of you. Natasha Carbonell and Tony Stark. They'd attack both of you. Call 'Natasha' every sexist and derogatory name in the book. Drag up every single sordid thing Tony Stark ever did in the past. I'm not letting them do that, and I'm especially
"OK," Bruce said, and after a moment, Tony heard him make his way toward the door. "Oh, hey, what did you name her? You never said."
Rhodey closed his eyes and dropped his head, sighing again. "Look, I get after the whole you almost dying from palladium poisoning thing that you want to try out this 'honesty' thing with Pepper, but this was probably one case where maybe you should have kept your mouth shut."
He nodded and checked his watch. "Good. We good? We ready?" he asked just as Hill stepped in from the press room.
I'm not her real dad, OK? I know, but— I just— I have no way of knowing where she comes from, and I have no way of getting her back there, so unless some magical little portal-opener-thing falls into my hands, she's stuck here, and that, my boo bear, makes her mine by default. Yeah, maybe I'm not her
They'd whittled the piles down to the last remaining few, and Steve picked up a small box that read it was from Bucky and Sam in equal measure, and he threw a glance up at Bucky and said, "You and Sam went in on something together?"
"Are you taking lessons from Barton now? They're breasts, Romanoff, and I don't have as much practice dealing with them as you do. Besides, it wasn't my idea to wear something that leaves so little to the imagination."
But she shook her head and said, "But not in the same way. Your blood was gained at the cost of doing what you believed would save lives."
"They get a little cold after they're born," Natasha said, quiet awe in her voice. "Body heat's best."
"No," Pepper said definitively and got into the car with him, and when Happy slammed the door, she said, "Oh, shit. Maybe I should have said 'yes'?"
"So," Natasha said, and Tony could tell by her tone it was a complete change of subject, "you can feel the bond, huh?"
The thing was, until the legal aspect got sorted out — and Tony assured him that the lawyers were hammering it out and things were looking good for Buck — Bucky kind of was a prisoner of the tower. The Avengers had taken on full responsibility for the man once termed the Winter Soldier, and, god forbid, Bucky in any way snapped or went off the rails, the full blame would fall on the Avengers and, in particular, Steve and Tony as the leaders of the initiative. The one saving grace they had was that the brainwashing that Buck had undergone was never permanent. It wore off after time, as Bucky himself recounted, glimmers of awareness having been afforded to him and then snatched away over the years. Steve honestly wasn't sure about Bucky snapping and suddenly turning into the Winter Soldier. He was aware that his daughter's cries sometimes put Bucky ill-at-ease, and Steve couldn't even begin to imagine what Bucky had been forced to do over the years to where an infant's cries could cause the beginning stages of a flashback, but he wasn't afraid of him turning into a mindless killing machine — not through that means, anyway.
Steve snorted a laugh but continued to gaze over his menu. He wasn't actually all that hungry, but Tony was so hopeful for this, and Steve didn't want to give him any reason to think that there was any way this date wasn't going to end with them making plans for another. It was after midnight, so maybe he could down a breakfast platter of some kind. Eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage, hash browns — the works.
(And again, Steve was entirely certain Tony mourned Jarvis more than either Howard or Maria. Tony hadn't cried at Howard and Maria's funeral, but he'd all but soaked through Steve's coat with his tears at Jarvis's.)
Forget the 'almost.' He did. God help him, he hated this man. He hated him for what he wasn't and what he had never pretended to be. He hated him for not being what Steve had wanted and hoped him to be the moment he'd seen the name, never mind the photograph, in the file. Waking up in the future — being pulled from his grave (God, please, let him go back there) — was bad enough, but he thought there'd been a slight glimmer of hope the moment he'd come to terms with the fact that he was nearly seventy years in the future. He still remembered what that Tony — his Tony (no,
So he opted not to do anything and instead sat and continued to play on his phone doing bullshit work as Steve and Barnes yukked it up in the kitchen (OK, Steve did most of the yukking), evidently reliving something from whatever joke of a public school they'd gone to. Well, Steve had been dirt poor growing up. Not like his mother could have afforded to send him to some elite prep school like Tony's parents had.
Barnes made an utterance of disgust, and Tony turned back in time to see him push himself away from where he rested against the back of the couch then take several long strides around it. With a frustrated groan, he sank down onto a cushion, arms braced over his knees as he perched on the edge and stared at the blank space beneath the TV. Tony stared at him rather pointedly, making sure that Natasha saw that he saw something was up with Barnes, and as explanation, she simply said, "Brings back too many memories for him."
"Yeah," Bucky said, and Steve directed his attention back to him to see he was now watching the TV like the others. "He yelled at us for eating half the batch he made this morning."
Barnes's eyes went a little clouded at the mention of 'Nat,' and Tony catalogued it for later but continued his story.
He hadn't seen the footage himself. There was a part of him that didn't want to. It was easier to convince himself of the truth of his words if he didn't see it. And it's not that he didn't… He still
Tony leaned a hip against the table and folded his arms. "You're going to read more pregnancy articles, aren't you?"
Steve stared at her — at this creature that had taken it upon herself to do to Tony what he'd never asked for, practically upending their lives in the process — and debated over whether to take her olive branch or throw her out on her hide like she damn well deserved.
He turned to his plate and dug into his food, and Tony just pulled the sixth waffle off the iron and said, "We'll find a way."
wasn't in the mood to move at all, and he grimaced and looked between his arms and the bassinette and tried to figure if he could reach without having to strain his lower half. Barnes had stood back away from the goings-on, folding his arms and overseeing but otherwise keeping out of it, and Bruce still had that icepack in his hand and didn't look like he was about to part with it at any moment. DUM-E, the stupid 'bot, gave a hopeful little whir as he wheeled over to the foot of the bed and raised his arm like he was more than willing to offer a hand, but luckily, Hill chose that exact moment to appear in the lab, looking tired and drawn but smiling a little as she walked over and said, "I hear there's a new member of the family."
"I know it's crazy and insane and impractical and impossible, but think about it. It's a kid we made. We did this. A kid with our genes—"
Unfortunately, Bruce didn't want to play along and instead sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose as he said, "
Steve's sharp gaze went over to Barton at that for some reason, and Barton put his hands up in what looked like apology and sat back.
He pulled away from Steve and looked to the couch, and he glanced up at Steve and said almost petulantly, "There's a baby in my spot."
"I mean in our defense, we don't usually have a need for condoms unless we want to keep the mess—" He clamped his mouth shut as he realized what was coming out of his mouth. "S'not really important. Anyway, so, I mean, come on. You suddenly find yourself with not just a different body but a different
He nodded but still continued to focus on something past her elbow. "But I don't...I don't have a right to—"
look, Thor completely ignored Natasha's comment and said, "If there is one thing I have discovered over my many years of life it is that one can never be too careful or too cautious," his tone seeming to indicate that he found humor in Tony's ambivalence to his guardedness.
"No," Steve said, lightly, to counter him. He pressed a kiss against Tony's neck and added, "Something wrong with wanting to be right next to my best fella?"
Tony could only hum as Steve continued to work him with his fingers, his other hand supporting the swell of his belly. Steve leaned forward and started to nuzzle at Tony's neck, but he sat back a moment and said, "Shirt, off," and Tony waited for Steve to do it himself, but when nothing happened, he sat back from the headboard and, with shaky hands, grabbed the hem of the shirt to pull it over his head. He tossed it onto the floor, and Steve said, "That's better," then pushed up flush with Tony, Steve's front to Tony's back, and cupped firm hands over Tony's breasts. "My God," he murmured as he nuzzled into Tony's neck, "they just keep on getting fuller, don't they?"
"Look, it's either this or a lunch date, and I'll make you take me to one of those really fancy, high- end places where the entire entrée fits on a teaspoon."
on? The old man always loves to point out everything they got wrong in that movie. You'd think he grew up then or something."
Steve had his gaze focused on the sleepy and nourished baby now cradled back in his arms, and he smiled a little and said, "So, we end up with another one of these, huh?"
Tony tilted his head some like he was trying to catch Steve's eyes from beneath his eyelashes. "You sure? Just so you're aware, you're a shit liar, and I know you're lying to me now. I'm not taking offense to it, but I just want you to be aware you're not fooling me."
So, a potential future as an Army lab-rat or Howard Stark's personal lab-rat. Well, it was sure to always be interesting. Lonely, but interesting. Maybe Bucky was right? Maybe he should have just gotten a job in a war plant? He was sure he would've eventually found some dame desperate enough to have him in that case.
The reporter, however, made a face — a smile like she couldn't believe what Tony had just admitted to but was
"I guess I can deal with the brat until we figure out some way of getting her back home. I know how I felt when I knew my old man didn't want me around."
He put his hands to Steve's face, a palm against each cheek, and he tilted Steve's head forward so that Steve was forced to look at him. "Because he's your friend, and because you're not the type to leave a man behind. You'd do it for any of us. And because you feel guilty because you think it's your fault he's even like that in the first place."
His smile broadened, and there was a mischievous twinkle in his gorgeous blue eyes as he said an even more enigmatic, "Magic," if that was even possible.
Tony grinned at her and pulled away from Rhodey, and he led her over to the fridge and said, "Sure, baby girl. What do you want? You want your juice? J, you ordered that juice for me, didn't you?"
Wilson shrugged. "I think that might actually be a good thing," he said but didn't elaborate. He didn't have to. Tony knew there were a lot of fucked-up childhoods sitting at the table with him. The fact that he was actually considered one of the 'stable' and 'reliable' adults really said something about how fucked up all of them still were to some degree.
"Don't worry," Bruce said from the back seat as Natasha pulled out of the space and swung the car around the garage toward the exit bay, "it's typical for brides to be late to their wedding."
Tony let out a gasp as he stepped on after him. “Steven! Why— How could you? I am an absolute delight, and you should worship the very ground I walk on!”
"Because she knows what they will try to do, and she cannot condone that. She believes that all bondeds wish to conceive and bear children. She believes it is their duty to do so. She cannot condone them—"
Barnes and Bruce turned around without issue. Natasha gave him a sly little smile but still turned around and afforded him some modicum of privacy. To be honest, he actually wasn't bothered by Natasha's presence. He'd been practically naked in front of her before. But Bruce or the man that was, for all intents and purposes, his husband's
Steve tried to will the flush to leave him, taking a deep breath and trying to steady his nerves, and for some reason, the only thing he could be bothered to say — almost like it was pure reflex or a muscle memory for him — was, "Don't say 'fucking.'"
He rolled his eyes. "I know that, boo-bear. But I just… I don't know." He squawked out a laugh. "I don't know. I honestly don't fucking know." He laughed a little more and rubbed a hand over his face. "I mean, could it really…?"
Steve shrugged. "Your guess is as good as mine," he said. He supposed he could afford to spend one day here.
stormed past to make his way to the stairs. "Why the fuck is there not a bathroom on this floor?" he muttered and sucked in a deep breath before he steeled himself to make the climb up to the second floor of the penthouse.
"Yeah? Well, it's a stupid one. Buck got it stuck in his head one time and kept humming it all through the mission we were on. I wasn't the only one that wanted to deck him by the end of it."
Tony shrugged and began to inspect the wine glass that sat to the side of his plate. "Maybe. Still thinking about it. Is this wine? You know I really shouldn't drink wine, right? Forget being pregnant, you do remember me saying I've been dry for well over a year, right?"
He hadn't counted on how things would actually play out when he did eventually get married, and to be honest, he was actually rather disappointed he could probably never get any more mileage out of that diamond and sapphire band. That wasn't just gorgeous to look at, it had sentimental value as well.
for the job. Having a baby was beneath him? Please. Howard just wasn't qualified for the job. It needed someone stronger or tougher or fiercer or more capable — someone more adaptable to change, someone with an actual fucking
Barnes snorted out the most obnoxious laugh going, and when Tony raised an eyebrow at him, he put his hands up in a sort of surrender and said, "I was not part of that. It's funny, but I wasn't part of that brain trust. You used it yet?"
Rhodey began to choke on something, and as Bruce thumped him on the back a couple times, Tony thinned his lips into a flat line and pulled the waffle off the iron before he set it down in front of Bruce.
"All right, look, I just assumed if I ever had a kid — and not that I was thinking of ever having kids — but if I ever did, if I ever had a daughter, I'd name her after my mother."
He snorted a laugh and said, "You're not wrong," before he flopped back down and tried to get comfortable again. He sighed and tossed and turned, and he lay there and stared at the ceiling for he didn't know how long before he said, "J?"
The call cut out, and Tony heaved out a breath and dug the heels of his palms into his eyes. Fuck, what was he going to do when Cap came back? How was he going to explain this?
He held his arms out and closed his eyes, and Esmeralda said, "Is there any reason in particular you're doing that?"
"Whatever," Tony said again and turned to leave, but he stopped a moment and turned back to Bruce and said a somewhat less assured, "You don't really think there's anything to worry about, do you?"
Tony sighed and rolled his eyes. "Look, Steve and I have been engaged for how long now? I mean, we put it off because I kind of wanted a big ol' bash to show off with, and that takes time to plan. Plus, with the whole rooting out Hydra cells and other Avengers' business, wedding plans got pushed to the backburner. It's not like I haven't wanted to marry Steve since he asked me. We just…haven't found the time to do it."
Steve just reached out and helped Tony off with his jacket, and he grabbed a hanger from the closet and said, "Sorry, it's plastic. Not sure if you're particular about how you hang your stuff up."
"Yeah, well," Steve said with a slight shrug as he held Tony in his arms and began to sway with him ever so gently to the soft tune that surrounded them, dipping his head slightly so he could press his cheek to Tony's.
He put his head in his hands and ran them back through his hair, grabbing on like the pain would somehow give him the answers or make everything better.
One thing Tony could honestly say was that he had never been a fan of the pump-and-grind kind of dance that was popular at these sorts of places. Sure, he'd done it, when he was strutting his stuff and flashing his feathers as a young, stupid kid. But he was in his forties now, and he was settled and had a fiancé that was older than the Charleston, and the most dancing he'd done as of late was slow dancing to ballads with a super soldier from the '40s. And to be honest, he liked that kind of dancing more. Nowadays, anyway. Maybe it was the intimacy of it or maybe it was because it was a hell of a lot classier or maybe it was just because it was Steve and he was wont to make all sorts of excuses when it came to Steve.
— then turned and took the several achy steps over to the closet to pull out the prototype gauntlets he'd stored in there. He didn't have a chest R/T, which he'd have to manage without because, one, he didn't have it and two, yeah, no fucking way was he getting one on his chest at this point in time.
Steve cuddled him some more, and he nestled his head against Tony's, burying his face in Tony's hair a moment before he pulled back slightly and said, "What about Hydra?"
Steve choked out a slight laugh, and he grinned at Tony and said, "I guess that's a good thing, right?"
Evidently they hadn't said anything of the sort. He was sure Barnes would have passed along the message if he had. So, they'd found Steve.
Steve smiled a little like he was surprised by Tony's surprise. "Well, yeah. Why wouldn't I? I didn't do it because I thought I was supposed to. I
"In theory? No. In practice? I'm sorry, of the people in this car, which one is a) pregnant and b) obligated to see that pregnancy through 'til its natural conclusion?"
be able to come. The way his hands were on Tony's body, the way he touched his abdomen — his ridiculously sensitive abdomen — the way his muscles clenched and yearned for even more of that touch, the way his clit swelled and throbbed with need, the way his vaginal muscles twitched and clenched around Steve's cock, desperate to have it, desperate to feel him thrust into him and force him to take his seed. He needed it. He needed Steve so bad.
"Nothing I'm doing," he said, some weird charge vibrating in the air. "Hey, J? You doing something you're not supposed to be doing, buddy?"
Steve just dropped his head some, stilling his hand over the swell of Tony's abdomen. He sucked in a breath and picked his head back up and said, "Doctors. Those…self-help things online."
Tony sighed as he stepped onto the penthouse floor, a gaggle of Avengers crowded around his TV and watching what looked like…an episode of
have anything like that. I know they're just trying to be nice. But I just— I would just feel better if they waited to do that until
"I'm sure it won't," Steve said and pecked his lips again before he loosened his grip and made headway in the direction of the elevator. "Gonna go run through some trials with Thor. Want to watch?"
"OK," Tony said, and, forgetting himself again, went to kiss Steve on the lips, but Steve pulled back at the last moment and said, "Hey, watch it with that thing, wouldja?"
Steve shot him a look over the menu, purposefully avoiding looking anywhere below his eyes. "You know how."
Bruce could do nothing more but shake his head, and he pushed himself away from the bar and went back over to the elevator. "If you change your mind, I'll be down in my lab. Like I said, I think I found something that might help us."
"Anyway," he continued, "my point is there are certain risks that come from being an Avenger, and getting mixed up with screwballs from the cosmos that can literally transform your body is one of those risks."
"OK, you explain more American customs to Goldilocks," Tony said. "I'm gonna go back to making out with my sexy super soldier."
"Which," Tony said, swizzle stick still at his lips, "goes to show you how confident I am that I'm right and that asshole is not."
Tony rolled his eyes. "Oh, do you really have to ask?" he muttered and held up his left hand, one decorated with a simple gold band on his ring finger. Steve glanced down to his own hand and considered the ring there.
"OK," Tony said, watching and not making any move to match Steve and change into something more appropriate for going outside, "and that usually means lay low and keep your head down."
" Bruce asked over the line, and Tony took off to the sky to get a bird's-eye-view of the locale to see if there was anything he was missing.
Tony's vision went a little blurry, and he frowned and said, "Goddamn it, Steve," and reached up with his free hand to brush the stupid, fucking tears away.
He rolled his eyes and huffed again, and he shoved his bag at Steve then did as the nurse suggested. He stood there a moment and waited for the digital readout to complete, and when it did—
He was just wiping the sweat off his neck when Thor showed up in the room, and after he boomed out a jolly, "Hello!" he asked if Steve would want to run through some practice maneuvers with him.
Steve inhaled a deep breath through his nose and nodded. "I know," he muttered in tired resignation.
Other Tony complied, Tony shaking his head at the length of the name ending in 'ski,' and he wrote out the agreed amount, signed it, and tore it out of the book.
He snapped his helmet on, and as soon as his interface had loaded, he took off after Steve, telling JARVIS, "J, get me to that idiot before he makes a Steve-shaped splat on the ground."
parties in our very own government that are more open to the idea that Iron Man got himself turned into a woman and impregnated by Captain America than you might think. The governments of the world have been trying to make more super soldiers since the very first one came off the assembly line. Most of them have been miserable failures. Your very own Doctor Banner can probably attest to that."
It was easy talking to Tony. He'd never found it so easy to talk to anyone. And Tony didn't know him, so there was no pressure to be anything but himself. Not like with his friends that expected certain things of him—
The woman opened her eyes — dark brown and framed by inky, black lashes — and, for some reason he couldn't explain, Steve just knew this was Tony... A very feminine-looking Tony with— Look, he was a red-blood, bisexual American male very in love with a man named Tony Stark that had seemingly just been turned into a woman. Would anyone blame him for maybe, well, stealing a look over Tony's suddenly womanly body and zeroing in his attention on what he suddenly realized were a pair of breasts filling out the under armor? Nice breasts, too.
He blanked on the name of a famous female musician, and Tony snorted a laugh as he rolled out some more dough.
The others showed back up for dinner, which consisted of everyone's favorites from their usual Chinese restaurant, and they sat around in their pajamas and stuffed their faces and watched Christmas movies before, closing in around ten that night, they yawned and made their excuses and filed out, wishing Steve and Tony a 'Merry Christmas' as they left.
"No, Steve!" Tony yelled, spinning around on his heel and glaring at him. He marched right back up to him and jabbed him hard in the sternum with his pointer finger. "You don't get to do this, do you understand? You don't
The Cap laughed, though it sounded a bit bitter and somewhat forced. "At least one of us isn't. Anyway, sorry. I hope you weren't— I mean, I hope I didn't disturb anything—"
Barnes shrugged. "The part of him that's not stupid enough to toss away happiness with both hands thinks that, anyway. I thought for sure he was gonna ask that Agent Carter to ask him to marry him after the war was over. I don't know that they ever did anything more than talk about the next battle plan, but he was sweet on her! I only ever saw him go like that once, maybe twice before. Steve's not the type of guy to lose his head over anyone. But boy, he was sweet on her, but I think of the way I remember that, and then I see the way he looks at you, and it's totally different, you know?"
She was half-asleep already, and so he carried her over to the couch and set her down, and he tucked the pillow under her head then grabbed the blanket that was thrown over the back of it and laid it down over her. He tucked it in and murmured for JARVIS to dim the lights in this portion of the room before he went back over to his workstation and continued laboring with the Mark XVI.
"How?" Bruce said. "Who? What?" He turned back to look at where the portal had once been. "What just happened?"
"Is that a good thing?" he asked because he honestly didn't know if it was or not, and Tony just shrugged.
"Oh!" Thor said brightly. "I just mean to say, my friend, that you are most welcome to spend your days in the halls of Asgard once your loved ones have departed—"
It wasn't until halfway through the song that he suddenly realized what the oh-so-familiar tune was — that first song they'd ever danced to, before they'd been SteveandTony and had just been 'Steve' and 'Tony.'
"Did he? Think I remember when he died." He went quiet a moment then shrugged. "Anyway, it just… It wouldn't be the same going there now, I don't think."
He smiled at him, and Steve exhaled a breath and said, "You really didn't have to go to all this trouble, you know."
Tony raised an eyebrow. "What? Trying to say I should just give in and get in touch with my feminine side?"
"What do you think's going to happen if you continue to go out in public?" Barton asked, making it sound as though Steve was being the idiot in this equation.
"Steven," Thor said and put a hand on Steve's good arm, directing Steve's attention to him, "you do yourself no favors stretching yourself to these limits. You must also remember that you have a child that grows in the womb of your bonded, whose welfare you now must consider."
This time, Tony hummed and said, "Somehow, I'm thinking it's a little more selfish than the noble 'peace on earth, good will toward men.'"
"I mean vaguely, like, obviously not exactly. Steve's kind of blonde and bluish-eyed and you're clearly not. But you're like a dark-haired version of him."
"Of course I'm not," he said and found a box of something called Cranberry Hibiscus. He tried not to make a face at it — or at the fact that it had probably been purchased by Pepper — and he pulled it out and showed it to Bruce. "How 'bout this?"
of myself as a man temporarily in a woman's body, I guess. I don't…" He shook his head and shrugged. "I don't know, Steve. I don't know what I feel like, but I'm starting to feel less and less like Tony Stark and more like…I don't know who."
He went over and turned the water on, and he pulled the stopper on the faucet to redirect the water to the showerhead. He pulled the curtain to close up the shower then sat down on the edge of the tub and waited a moment before he let out a soft and quiet moan.
Bruce looked like he was genuinely giving this some thought as he said, "Well, that might be true for Steve—"
Honestly, Tony had known they couldn't just stroll into the doctor's office as they were. Even if he'd given the fake name of 'Natasha Carbonell,' Steve was easily recognizable now, and strolling into an ob/gyn's with the attractive mystery brunette was a surefire way of pinging the gossips' radars and having their candids splashed all over the media.
"You're his anchor to the present," she added before he could say anything. She shrugged and continued, "If anything happens to you…"
Tony snorted a laugh. "You don't say?" he mused, and the guy dug his fingers into Tony's hips almost like he was trying to claim him. He gasped out a breath and put his hands to either of the guy's shoulders and said, "Yeah, I don't think so, buddy," and tried to push him off.
Tony nodded, still a little confused, like he was coming out of a fog, and Steve pulled away and went to go into the kitchen but thought better of it and turned back to Tony.
all this information is nowadays." He turned back to Tony and added, "Back in my day a fella wouldn't be welcome at this kind of appointment."
Slouched down in the chair, Barnes rolled his head around to face Tony, and he smirked at him, face still a nice shade of pink from his laughing fit, and said, "Look, you don't need to get graphic or anything. Just a simple 'yes' or 'no' is good enough."
Tony continued to stand awkwardly on the side of the road, and he folded his arms and kicked at the gravel and dug the toe of his sneaker into the dirt as he waited for Steve to…whatever. Take Barnes's hand and run off into the sunset together. Probably something like that, right? That's how these reunions always ended, didn't they? Yeah, sure, he was happy for Steve, he guessed.
"That doesn't make any sense," Steve said, more confused than insulted. "She doesn't look anything like a mongoloid."
This seemed to surprise Tony, if the way he turned was any indication, his mouth clamped shut but his eyebrows raised slightly.
He used finger quotes on the word 'dead,' and Steve considered this a moment then said, "Do you think I could pull off doing that?"
Both Steve and Bucky just blinked and looked at him, and he sighed a little and looked between Wilson and Tony and said, "Oh, well, there's a shock. The relics have never heard of Scooby-Doo."
"What? This?" Steve asked and rubbed his hand over Tony's small belly. "You're really sensitive there, you know that?"
Tony just braced himself against the back of the couch and leaned against it, digging his fingers into the plush material, and he closed his eyes and waited for the overwhelming sensation of pain to leave him, counting backwards from one hundred just for
He did, and Tony saw not anger staring back at him but thinly-veiled worry, and Tony's defenses fell as he said, "Look, Steve, I didn't—"
He laughed a little at the fact that Tony had to insist that it wasn't innuendo — he didn't even think to take it as such — and said, "Midnight."
for that. No, seriously. I fantasized about you long enough; I'm glad to see the sentiment was returned. I just hope I live up to the fantasy, but whatever. This was your dream? Yeah, well, you fought hard enough for it. It didn't come easy, that's for sure, and it hasn't been easy, and it'll continue to be not easy because we're Avengers. We're Earth's mightiest heroes. We fight the good fight against the assholes that the guys in the regular monkey suits just can't handle. And you know what? There's a lot more of that sort of shit around nowadays than you can even imagine. And it sucks that it'll never be boring for us, and it sucks that we have contingency plans drawn up on the off-chance one of us gets killed or Olivia ends up orphaned. But it's
"How did you…?" he mused but didn't finish the thought. Seriously, though, how did she sneak in so easily?
Steve shrugged but continued to sway with the baby, and Tony followed his lead. "Not much," Steve said. "Just having a dance with my best girl."
It was a tender moment perfect for spoiling, which is exactly what happened when a voice that was only familiar from having heard it on television so many times said a slightly sneering, "Captain Rogers," from the periphery.
"So," Tony said and turned to him, folding his arms and hitching his hip against the back of the couch he claimed he wasn't able to see. "What are we doing here?"
Tony just stared at him. "That is the exact argument you gave me last night when I teased you about that. And no, she can't. Not unless she's hiding it from us."
"You OK?" Steve asked and rubbed his back with both hands, giving him a gentle and possessive squeeze as he did so.
"What, no published cases about men that are turned into women that get pregnant as women that get turned back into men that are still pregnant even as men? It's such a common occurrence, I don't understand why."
"He was a skinny punk from Hoboken with a nasally voice," Steve said, cutting JARVIS off. "Still don't know what Dorsey was thinking hiring him."
Tony just stared at him, mouth flat, one hand to his hip while the other held the spatula and said, "If that's the attitude you're going to take, the door's that way."
Even if it was through such unconventional means. And even if one Steve Rogers had been the proverbial 'sperm donor.' She could probably learn to live with that. She wouldn't be happy about it, but she'd learn to live with it.
"I mean, is this permanent?" he asked, ignoring Tony's utterance. "Are you turned into a woman for the rest of your life?"
But Steve just grinned and leaned in to kiss Tony, and Tony squawked and pulled back, bumping into Wilson as he yelled out, "Goddamn it, Steve! Don't even try it!"
Tony seemed to consider this a moment, head tilted and mouth pursed. "You're not wrong. No, it's more of an electronic brain. You can program it to do all sorts of stuff. Friday's kind of our personal…virtual right-hand gal. It's—" He stopped short and shook his head. "You don't need to worry about it. She's not here, and you're not going to meet her for a while, so…"
"OK, as adults, I think we're all perfectly aware that men can father children well into their seventies or later."
Tony blinked and looked up at Steve — the man Howard had revered to the point of a sick obsession — his eyes skirting over the concern he saw etched over Steve's —
The doctor put her hand up. "I don't need to know specific bedroom activities. I just need to know if you've experienced any pelvic pain during intercourse."
"—and your history of palladium poisoning, it might put too much of a strain on your body. That said, there's no real…non-intrusive way  of—"
"Olivia?" Bruce asked, like he wasn't able to follow Tony's train of thought and wasn't quite sure who he was talking about.
Steve was still busying himself reading articles, which— Fine. Whatever. Steve could give him the condensed version of what he'd discovered. He supposed he had to count himself lucky on that front. On one of the rare,
Bruce, mouth still a little puckered, turned to Natasha, who just reached out and patted his arm with the hand that wasn't holding a champagne glass, which was currently at her lips as she took a sip.
He didn't know how long he sat there watching it, his gaze, for whatever reason, fixated on the screen. Close to the whole movie, probably, as he only realized he was still watching it just as the on-screen Rosemary grabbed a knife from the kitchen. And it was only then that he realized he'd been sitting there rubbing his belly for almost the entire movie, like he was either trying to assure himself or the little creature that grew inside of him that that was a movie and this was real life, and there was nothing strange our out-of-the-ordinary about this baby. There was nothing otherworldly or demonic about it. No red eyes. No cloven hooves. Its father was a stubborn, sanctimonious pain-in-the-ass named Steven G. Rogers, who just happened to be the world-famous Captain America. The only 'weird' thing about this child was that its father had been presumed dead for seventy years and its mother had been changed from a man into a woman to allow for its conception. He hadn't been craving raw meat, and he hadn't had any horrible, unexplained abdominal pains, and he had never 'dreamt' about anyone but Steve fucking him.
feeling, it's not like an instinct, it's just something I know beyond a shadow of a doubt to be true. We don't know how she came here, but by that same token, we don't know that she's not supposed to stay here. She knows me. She knows all of us. I can't just turn her out on the street or stick her in the system. But I can take care of her—" He put his hand up to stop Bruce's complaint. "Yeah, OK, I know I can't even really be trusted with a potted plant, but if alternate universe future me can figure it out, I think I can figure it out."
They were left alone, and Steve just looked at him, bemused, head tilted, like he wasn't quite sure what he was seeing.
He nodded a little, but Tony wouldn't exactly say he looked happy. More like he'd accepted whatever had been told to him. Which was kind of strange, to be honest. He figured the Cap would have wanted to hear that he had a family in that alternate or future or future alternate or whatever it was.
Steve's face went hard at that, and he went a little stiff and rigid like he was putting himself on guard. "I've heard of it."
Steve just smiled, and he reached out and clapped Barnes by the shoulder and gave it a squeeze, and when Barnes nodded at him, Steve let go and turned back to Tony. He leaned down one more time and kissed him hard, hands with a gentle grasp of his shoulders, fingers kneading the joints in equal parts gentleness and possessiveness, and when he broke the kiss, he smiled at Tony then looked down at Tony's belly. He touched a gentle, loving hand to the swell and said, "Behave while I'm gone, you hear me?"
He was just starting to mop up the mess when Tony pushed into the room, and Steve stopped in his tracks in the middle of wiping off his abdomen. Tony's gaze zeroed in on what he was doing, and Steve stood there, mortified, waiting for the ball to drop. He didn't know how it was going to drop; he just knew that it was.
"All right, look, it sounded a lot cooler in my head. But I'm serious, you hurt him again, I don't think I'm going to be able to side with you. Now, he hurts you? That's a different thing entirely. You hurt him…"
He slumped against the door of the stall, and he looked down at the streaks of come that covered his hand, and he was so goddamned lucky he was already spent because his immediate thought was to have Tony, on his knees and still bound, lick his hand clean. Five minutes ago, that thought alone would have had him coming in his pants like a teenager. He banged the back of his head against the door and muttered a quiet, "
"It's a bag to carry a bunch of crap in," Rhodey said, nonplussed by their responses. "By the way, photographer? Your seven o'clock."
"—and a grumpy, old man that'll bite my head off for saying anything less than reverential about the moody pregnant broad and probably threaten to throw me off the team for it."
"I do. I fucking hate you, old man. I swear to god, I'm married to a fucking Disney prince. Stop giving me those looks. You don't even know who I am, and you're still using your arsenal against me. How is that even fucking fair? I can't do it to you!"
After all the wrinkles had been steamed out of the gown, Natasha and the assistant helped him into the designer's most rushed creation (she let them know this about five times in the time it took for Tony to step into the gown and for the other two to get him situated and zipped into it). There was no mirror in the penthouse living area, and so Tony didn't know what he looked like yet, but both the assistant and Natasha seemed to think it looked OK on him, if their smiles were anything to go by, and even the designer managed something like relief when she saw the way it fit him.
Steve nodded then folded his arms and said, "And when the formula doesn't work out and you run out of the milk?"
Thor ignored his obvious discomfort and said, "May I ask, my friend, precisely what the Goddess said to you when she cast the spell?"
"No, I got it," she replied and finally got herself situated. "Unca Bruce, is An' Pepper mad at me?"
"He'll be right out," she said as she hung up the receiver, and Steve nodded and sat quietly, his arms folded, while Tony drummed his fingers on the desk and waited for the head clerk or main clerk or whatever the lead clerk was called to make his appearance, vowing to leave a very honest two-star review on Yelp when this was all said and done.
Now it was an even more terrifying ever-present fear in the back of his mind because he had a life here now. He had a reason to stay. He had friends and a job and a purpose.
Steve hit the button. “You know, you really don’t have to. You could wait down here. I’ll get her calmed down, and then we can pick up where we left off.”
Though Tony knew it was a complete coincidence, he got nothing but a shot in the ribs at that, and he smiled a bit bemusedly at Steve and said, "I really think he told you to go fuck yourself."
Tony hummed a little and shrugged. "I guess you'll never know, huh?" he mused then bit into his slice of pizza, grinning at him as a glob of grease ran down his chin.
"Yeah. Wasn't sure if you'd want the pizza. But it looked like you'd already eaten by the time we got back, and I forgot to tell you it was in there if you wanted it."
Tony took more care eating his meal than Steve did, taking smaller, more considered bites as he focused his attention on his phone. At one point, he sat there with a forkful of eggs, sausage, and hash brown halfway to his mouth as he tapped the screen to check something over. Steve didn't know what possessed him to do it, but he reached over and guided the fork the remaining distance to Tony's mouth, and Tony took the bite without thinking before he turned to Steve and gave him a curious look. Steve went a little bashful, pulling his hand from Tony's to go back to his own plate, and they ate in silence a few more moments before Tony said, "You know, I've only had one other person do that for me."
After Barnes had departed for destination unknown, Tony went down to the basement garage and grabbed the Audi, and he drove down to the Village through what was not exactly heavy traffic for an early Saturday afternoon, finding a space close to the agreed-upon coffee shop. It was a tight squeeze, but he managed it (
A reason that had everything to do with hormones racing through his body that hadn't been there a month or so before.
Steve grumbled and waved away some of the smoke she'd left in her wake, and he stood there in the silence of the room, looking down at himself like he could somehow see the changes that had been made.
Steve was stuck for anything to say, his own somewhat sordid history being thrown back in his face, and Tony couldn't help but mutter at him, "Nice going, Steve."
"It's trending," Steve said, smiling, proud of himself for mastering one piece of twenty-first century communication.
out of a box of goddamned scraps. Surely he was smart enough to figure out a way to brew a goddamned cup of coffee without a fucking maker. All he had to do was fashion something to hold the filter with the ground coffee in it then run through a pot of boiling water and presto! Liquid savoir!
She was a handful. There were no two ways around it. She was a precocious pain in the ass, and it was at that moment that he wondered if that was the kind of kid Cap had been before he brushed the thought aside. Olivia was his biological daughter, not Cap's, and her
it was that little girl that had begged him for shield waffles and sat at his coffee table, drawing pictures of her daddy and her papa and her baby sister and her various aunts and uncles.
He gave him a flat, smug smirk then turned around and went back to fiddling with the engine, and Steve ground his teeth together and ran a hand through his hair before he said, “If we’re going to be on a team together—”
She made another 'hmm' sound and said, "If I'm hearing you and your Captain correctly, I'm getting the sense that your greatest concern is the actual
"And, what? Allow that asshole to climb back in, too? 'cause you know he'd insist. Steve, not the asshole. I think the asshole has more decency than that."
"Just calm down," she said, keeping her voice as calm and even as possible. "No need to get yourself worked up over anything."
The square was also a small park, trees and shrubberies and lampposts festooned in lights, and Tony motioned for Steve to lead them up a snow-trodden path toward some benches that had evidently been cleaned off sometime earlier that day. They walked through a canopy of white and red and green lights, and as they got to the bench, Tony said, "They're like rats."
Tony just glanced up to Steve, and Steve must have sensed his concern — the terrified look on his face probably clued him in — as he laughed and said, "It's fine. Seriously, you're going to love it. I promise."
He blinked and shook his head to clear his thoughts, and he squeezed his legs together some to quash what was starting to become a familiar tingle of arousal in areas he was still coming to terms with were 'his' now and forever.
"Bruce, come on! You know deep down you're secretly dying to find out what's there. You're a science man. You like to dig deeper, find stuff out, figure out fixes to problems. Getting to the root of something intrigues you. Science, Bruce. Do it for science!"
He counted off on his fingers. "One, because the government says I need insurance. Two, because insurance companies are greedy sons-of-bitch-assholes and if I have to have insurance, then I'm going to take them for everything they're willing to give me. And three, because our group is so small they wouldn't give us even a decent plan unless I did join. Don't ask, I don't understand. I don't write these damned polices."
“What do you want?” Steve asked eagerly, bringing up the back of his hand to just barely stroke down Tony’s flank.  “What do you like?”
When tall, blond, and stacked turned to make certain there was no one else nearby he needed to apologize to, Tony noticed that his ass wouldn’t quit either.
By the time morning light had eased its way into the bedroom, Tony had drifted back into wakefulness.  Steve was still beautifully asleep, long eyelashes brushing his cheeks in a way that made him look too perfect for this world.  He hadn’t left in the night.  Tony felt like his heart was full of more than just arc reactor power, and he went to go search through his nightstand again.  But just as he turned to do that, he realized what was waiting there: a length of red-and-gold silk ribbon with red and gold beads.  It was a more elaborate version of the ribbons he used to have in college or as a young entrepreneur, something for a more settled man, rather than a young buck with too much to prove.  He wasn’t sure who had put it there, JARVIS or Pepper, but he silently reminded himself to thank them both.
“Yeah, I got into art school on the GI Bill after I was discharged.  It’s great being back here again but…”
“I’d make up new ones for you,” Tony said, turning in Steve’s hold, feeling giddy.  Steve’s blue eyes were clear and warm in the morning light.  “I still want you, alpha.”
Tony nodded sagely.  “Totally get it, my buddy Rhodey and I had all sorts of fun back in the day.  Now I can give tips to the people he’s courting.”  He waggled his eyebrows and Steve stifled laughter.
“Sergeant Carter would probably like that.  In the USO, you spend a lot of time in transit, or waiting around.  I made the most of it with every gym we came across, and when we didn’t have that, I improvised.
Tony was enjoying it immensely, hand caressing Steve’s short hair, but he was still very amazed.  He could count the number of times someone had sucked his dick on one hand; his past partners had tended to eat him out or finger him once past early foreplay.  Omegas were supposed to be more sensitive to being penetrated, and pretty much everyone concentrated on that.  Tony was no exception.  Having something in him when he was horny was never less than excellent, but this was extremely nice too.
Tony thought with amusement, wading into the crowd.  He got some attention, but didn’t get mobbed.  Word had gotten around about that; the first year a few people had gotten ejected for not getting a clue about his boundaries, and no one wanted to leave.  He smiled at the young courters, grinned for their selfies, asked a few questions, even suggested a few people talk to each other based on their answers.
Gently, Steve reached to the side and began the elaborate process of baring Tony inch by inch.  Omega courting clothing was supposed to be very difficult to remove, giving an omega more time if there had been a miscommunication with an alpha, or someone had second thoughts.  A good alpha would be able to puzzle out the fastenings while taking the time to stoke their potential partner’s desire with caresses and praise.  An alpha who ripped their omega’s clothes off was a barbarian and a brute, not someone accepted in polite society.  If you couldn’t control yourself enough to figure out some knots, buttons, and clasps, you had no business courting, that was how the philosophy went.
When the elevator door opened to Tony’s floor, Steve finally moved his hand up to the ribbon loop again, holding it loosely and letting Tony take the lead.  Tony led him into the little sitting room adjoining his bedroom, and sank to his knees on a cushion he’d snagged off the sofa.  Steve knew they were starting the next phase of the courtship ritual, and any movie with a romantic alpha/omega scene, prime time TV drama, theater production, love song, or novel with a relationship plotline from the last few hundred years laid out the script for this in detail.  But he slowed down, staring at Tony in wonder, smiling at him with a bit of incredulity before taking his place right in front of him.
Tony turned and sped towards his bathroom, calling out commands left and right.  “Power-wash cycle, JARVIS, with a scented rinse.  Spin out the courting suits and pick something nice.  Blue tie, anything that goes with the suit.  Pick the accessories, I trust your judgment!”  He shed clothing with every step, dropping them all over his bedroom.  Between a long creative session in his workshop, a nice healthful sparring session with Happy, and then ruminating over diagrams while he’d completely lost track of time, Tony knew he had to look more like a bed-headed college student after a frat party marathon than someone Pepper would let through the doors of his own party.
Tony kept the ritual up, circling his arms around Steve’s waist and pressing his cheek to the embroidered front of Steve’s courting trousers.  The scent rising from beneath the stiffened cloth was decadently intoxicating, rich musk and amber.  He swallowed once to make sure his voice sounded firm.  “Alpha, may I see you?”
Steve blushed a bit and looked down at his shoes.  Despite radiating nervousness, he had none of the sharp edginess alphas could get when they were feeling defensive.  Under the nerves though was a very healthy alpha scent that was doing things for Tony above and beyond Steve’s adorableness.
Tony was simultaneously thrilled that Steve had chosen him, appalled that Steve had chosen him, and amazed that he had the privilege of sharing this with him.
It was endlessly amusing to Tony that apparently courting couldn’t take place if there wasn’t a target over your genitals.  The betas at the party got to wear whatever they wanted; most opted, like Pepper, for sophistication in simplicity, making a striking contrast to the extravagant displays of alphas and omegas.
Steve pulled off of Tony’s cock, stroking him slowly and looking shyly pleased with himself.  “Thank you.”
“Please, if you would,” Tony said with a waggle of his eyebrows that made Steve grin.  Tony reluctantly leaned away, then turned his back on Steve.  He put his chest to the floor, rested his head on his crossed arms, and arched his back to present.  The shimmering embroidery across his ass looked really good from that angle, so one of his past partners had told him.  Steve went to his knees himself and pressed his face against the fabric to smell him.  Tony knew his pheromones were strong, especially as worked up as he was right now, and Steve groaned in desire.
Tony smiled, and kissed him, long and slow, caressing the ribbon he’d given him.  “Whatever we want.”
Tony felt himself blushing like a school kid.  “Not so bad yourself.  Actually, scratch that. Right now, I’m the luckiest guy in Manhattan.”
“Oh, God,” he got out, folding himself over to curl protectively over Tony, even as Tony slipped his hand over Steve’s hip.  The alpha gesture of protection was seriously hot without cramping his style in the least, and Tony made a pleased little hum as he let the pads of his fingers barely skim Steve’s skin.  Only at the last did he let himself grip Steve’s cock in a satisfyingly firm grasp.  Steve’s fingers hooked inside Tony, making his eyes flutter with the stretch and pressure.
Steve shrugged out of the rest of his suit with a shy smile, laying it over the sofa with reverence.  Tony drank in the beautiful sight of Steve’s hard-earned physique, briefly framing his hands like a photo, making Steve laugh.
Steve flicked his eyes down to the three ribbons tied on the loops on his sleeve.  “If I’m not wearing the mask, I’m sort of more of a wallflower, honestly.  These are from Nat, Wanda, and Bucky, my friends.  I’ve just… I’m still pretty new to… courting.”
Tony nodded, running his hand down through Steve’s hair and stroking down his neck.  “Hey, what you did, whenever you did it, whoever you did it with, that’s all yours unless you really want to tell me.”  Steve said he hadn’t courted before, but that didn’t mean he was a complete virgin.  He was a little uncertain, but not as nervous as someone who’d never done
There was a great mix of people here from every part of the city and a little outside of it, and everyone was dressed to the nines.  It had been one of Pepper’s assistants who’d suggested leveling the playing field with little makeovers for everyone, and Pepper had made it happen with a huge amount of glee.  Courting was difficult enough without worrying that you weren’t going to be able to show yourself off the way you wanted to, or your budget couldn’t stretch for a cab ride.  Not every problem could be solved by throwing money at it, but this time it could, and Tony absolutely loved being able to play fairy godmother.
“Friday,” she said, as the doors chimed softly and opened onto his residential floor of the tower.  “The Courting Gala?”
“Oh, we’re good, damn good, you just surprised me.  Keep going,” Tony said.  He licked his lips in anticipation, and Steve smiled in relief before sucking Tony back down.  He looked amazingly peaceful with his lips stretched around Tony’s cock, slowly sucking him all the way down, hand moving to caress Tony’s thigh, then back up, just keeping the tip in his clever mouth to torment with his agile tongue.
Steve blushed, but seemed to be pleased at Tony’s reaction.  “I had to change the choreography in the shows.  If I split the pants again, the wardrobe department was going to shove me out of a plane.  Then I was in BDUs the rest of the time.  I haven’t been…  I’ve never been out courting like this.”  He gestured carelessly at himself, as if all six-plus feet of fine American muscle was a hardship to trot out for public inspection.
for showing off her design on such a perfect specimen of alphahood,” Tony said, recognizing the style of the suit and openly ogling Steve with a bit of exaggeration.
Long moments later, still holding his own weight easily, Steve looked down at him with eyes dark with pleasure, and brushed Tony’s hair back from his forehead.  “You look so beautiful.”
Steve.  He hadn’t come here looking – he had ten or more (an uncomfortably lot more) years on some of the people here.  But Steve was sharp, intelligent, talented, empathetic, drop-dead gorgeous, and seemed to be enjoying Tony’s company.
Part of that was likely a genuine ask, and Tony wasn’t loathe to let Steve know anything, but so far most of this had been about him.  He wanted to see where Steve wanted this to go next before trying to direct any of tonight’s festivities.
And boasted about it.  At a gala.  Where Tony had just had a difficult but enlightening conversation with a journalist hungry for a story.  Between Christine Everhart’s recorder and publisher, and Pepper getting into Obie’s files, Obie had found himself with a life sentence somewhere unpleasant and Tony had found himself standing alone at the top of his company.  He used what he’d learned from his captivity and turned Stark Industries around to fix mistakes, instead of make them.  The suit he’d used to get out of that cave had been the last weapon he’d ever made.
Steve covered him, weight on one muscled arm as Tony curled his legs high around Steve’s chest.  With a tip of his hips, he helped Steve find the right angle.  In a single powerful thrust, Steve filled him completely, making Tony’s head loll back and Steve’s drop to just brush the arc reactor as they savored the unbelievable pleasure of the heat, the pressure, and the stretch.
He’d told Pepper he wanted to have the Courting Gala to give back, and at first, he was certain she didn’t believe him.  Tony had been cheerfully hopping in and out of bed with plenty of willing partners over the years, and had taken more than one casual heat buddy, but a Courting Gala was supposed to be more serious.  They were for finding partners, close friends, even the love of your life; long-term relationships, or at least the start of them.  For most of Tony’s life, that hadn’t been his style.
Every suck was making Tony hotter and wetter, and with the sensual delight of Steve’s pleasantly thick fingers stroking inside him, he was producing enough slick to cover Steve’s hand in a few minutes.  Tony was racing for his climax with Steve’s relentless attention, and while he wasn’t going to object to anything going on, he didn’t want to be too fucked-out to enjoy the rest of the evening.
“Anyone who’s caught your eye?” Tony asked.  He tugged a little on his tie, loosening it.  Steve’s eyes nailed to the motion.  He took a half-step closer and looked around the room.  “Maybe.  It’s different, with the new suit and all.  Thanks again for that.”
He was drifting away from one group and about to turn to find another when he ran into a wall.  The wall quickly cupped his elbow to stop him from stumbling, apologizing all the while.
“Come on now,” Tony whispered into his mouth, and pulled away long enough to get down on his back, thighs spread, slick, pink hole on full display.  The traditional omega presenting was fun and all, but did zero favors for his arc reactor when it came to actual fucking; he knew from experience it called up an ache that was an absolute boner killer.  But from the look on Steve’s face, lust mixed with a kind of tender adoration Tony wasn’t entirely sure he deserved yet, this was going to be more than fine.
“All of you,” Tony said, grinning at Steve’s adorable blush.  “Go ahead; I’m sure I’ll like anything you want to try.”  Steve was looking down at him like he couldn’t quite decide to go next, before his eyes sparkled with sudden focus.  Tony wasn’t quite sure what Steve had decided, but was absolutely sure it was going to be good.
“Bucky,” Steve said, leaning into Tony’s steady touch.  “He’s a beta, he’s my best friend and I love the hell out of him.  Back when I was a buck ten, we, well, we wanted to make sure we knew how to do
Tony just shook his head a bit.  There had been a “Captain America” in the United States Army since World War II.  While the original had been a combat hero, since that time the role had been mostly for PR, a member of the USO who helped with morale and recruitment.  Except Steve Rogers had taken the role very, very seriously when the base he’d been performing at had been attacked.  Leading volunteers, he’d gone after soldiers captured in the raid and rescued them from a seemingly impossible situation.  After that, he’d done two more active tours of duty behind the mask, racking up a chest full of medals before handing over the mantle to a fellow soldier.  No one was going to relegate that title to pure entertainment and morale again, not after Steve Rogers.
“Go on.  That feels really good,” Tony urged into his crossed arms, wondering if maybe Steve was just looking for a bit more feedback.  Rude of Tony not to keep him updated, but he’d been enjoying himself rather thoroughly.
“She was my assistant for a while, but she was so good at running my life that I had to make her CEO.  She’s
“You look even better out of the suit,” Tony promised.  He held out his forearm in imitation of the film
Steve blushed a little more and pulled out his phone to show his works.  Tony was impressed: they were well-colored, true to life, he was like a modern Norman Rockwell.  His drawings of buildings and cityscapes had good perspective too.  A few more drawings of more fantastical and romantic things, like castles and alien cities, showed a decided comic book flair.  If Steve wanted to get into any of his chosen fields of art, he showed a hell of a lot of promise.
“You want me to draw you?”  Steve didn’t seem at all adverse, indeed even eager.  Tony melted a little, resisting the urge to purr.
If Tony wanted heat relief, he had a few friends or professionals for that.  Most omegas with strong heats had something similar.  But he wasn’t more than casual friends with any of his sex buddies.  He wanted more from Steve.  This was courting, not just sex, and he wanted to make sure he did this absolutely right.  Steve deserved it.  He deserved the damn world.  Tony at least had more experience to draw from, and he wanted to make this
Tony made quick work of the buttons, baring Steve in just a few seconds.  The words were old, and so was the posturing, but everything was part of the ritual for a reason.  Alpha clothing was easy to remove, and in this position, an omega could give pleasure, or bite an alpha’s most prized attribute right off, if they felt the alpha had been disrespectful or coercive.  There had been more than one attempted arranged marriage or war bride who’d gotten their point across in that exquisitely painful way.  In a few cases, governments had been overthrown and new omega rulers crowned as a result.
Clarity returned in an instant, the lure of the delicate schematics he’d been plotting suddenly run straight out of his head.  He quickly stepped out of the elevator, walking quickly backwards towards his bedroom.  “Pep, you’re a lifesaver,” he said, blowing her a kiss.
Tony jumped in the shower and strove not to yelp as the powerful jets of water hit him from all angles.  He didn’t have a second to waste, so was subjecting himself to the “human car wash” feature of his ridiculously extravagant shower.  He was going to feel a little tenderized, but it was guaranteed to not miss a single spot.  That was the theme of the Gala, after all, “Everyone deserves a chance to shine.”
Steve just frowned at him like he didn't understand the reference, and Tony rolled his eyes and said, "Well, there goes any jokes about that same vice president shooting an old man in the face and getting the old man to apologize for it."
He left the bedroom and went down the stairs to the living area where he found Steve sitting on the couch, sharp gaze focused on the tablet he held in his hand. Tony stopped and eyed him over a moment. He'd assumed Steve would either be sleeping on the couch or maybe even sleeping down in his old quarters.
Steve turned to the door beside him, and he looked for the handle to crank the window back up. "Uh, how do you—"
Steve, no matter how wonderfully rumbly and melodic Steve's voice was when he lay back, his head tucked under Steve's chin. Most of their classmates didn't pay attention — though there were a couple that did seem bemused by how
The fact that anyone could look at Steve the way Tony looked at him — like he was this modern marvel, like the sun rose and fell on him, like he'd hung the moon — amazed Steve to no end. No one had ever looked at him that way. Even Peggy hadn't.
She rolled her eyes at him then turned her attention to Tony. "Stark? Stark, look at me. Stark, breathe with me."
"Point is," he said and unscrewed the cap on the juice then set the open bottle down beside the smaller portion of macaroni and cheese, "there is absolutely no threat of me settling down with Captain Anachronism whereas there is every chance in the world of you settling down with, uh, what'd you say her name was?"
Steve paused mid-bite and stared at Tony a moment before he said, "I honestly can't tell if you're kidding or not."
Barton just scratched the back of his head and made a face, but Natasha pushed toward him and said, "Tony, no one's doubting your ability to be Iron Man. But I'm not sure Steve would be able to concentrate if he was spending half the battle worrying about you."
"Mmm…" he murmured, the words heavier and harder to form than they'd been a minute ago, "it is kind of boring watching it after-the-fact. Lot more fun in the moment."
kid that had come barreling into his workshop. Hell, he'd probably even have an easier time with the Cap's kid. Then again, the world probably couldn't tolerate
He just stared at Tony a little longer before he shook his head and tried to give Olivia the bottle once more. She fought Steve again but eventually seemed to accept it, though Tony was pretty sure if a six-week-old could glare in anger and annoyance, then she was doing exactly that to Steve.
. Keep going." God, it had been so long since he'd done this, but it was like riding a bicycle. Once you knew how to please your Tony Stark, it was kind of hard to forget.
The bacon was making him sick, and even the coffee was…unpleasant. He threw the covers back and ran into the bathroom and threw up again, but given that he hadn't eaten anything since the last time he'd thrown up, there was nothing to come up except for bile.
"Would you like me to have that recalibrated, too?" she asked, but she was smiling as she said it, and Tony turned to Steve and said, "Is she sassing me?"
"No. Thought about you a lot over the years." He reached down and moved the cursor over to the corner and x-ed out of the browser, leaving the standard Windows desktop background on display. Tony made an utterance of disgust and muttered, "You poor bastard," before he shut the monitor off — as though the very reminder of Windows was offensive to him. He turned back, and Steve realized he was intrigued by the look of Tony's clothes on him, or at least, his dick was intrigued considering the way it went half-hard at the sight of Tony in his shirt and boxer briefs, and he tried to focus on Tony's words as Tony continued, "Wondered what you were up to. I'd get some stuff from Nat."
"Sometimes," she said with a shrug. "I dunno. You and Daddy don't like t' let us get too far 'way from you 'cuz you're 'fraid someone's gonna hurt us. And Daddy's 'fraid someone's gonna hurt you. He says he doesn't wanna be without us 'cuz one time, he fell asleep for a
"There is little that is not in my powers," she said, and she cast a glance over to 'Viz' after she said this, smiling at him faintly before turning back to the Council. "You wish him to fall in love with a wealthy noblewoman?"
"Can I ask you something? And you don't have to answer if you don't want to, but I'm just curious. 'cause you know the extent of
"Yeah!" she said like he should have known that. "Up the state. That's where the 'vengers stay. We don't stay there when we go t' visit. We have a house with a big yard and my swing set's there. Daddy says 'm not allowed t' have a swing set in the Tower. That's for outside. We went there for Christmas, but it didn't snow until after Christmas but Maddie 'n' I got to play outside in the snow. 'nd I heard you and Daddy talking. You said we're gonna be staying there
Bruce could tell she was getting antsy, the way she kept bouncing in her chair, but he wasn't sure it was a wise move to let her anywhere near Tony at the moment. He glanced up at the ceiling, and though he hated to intrude, he said, "JARVIS, are Tony and Pepper still talking?"
"Well, Sarah's your mom's name," Barnes said, his gaze on Steve, and Steve smiled a little and said, "Yeah, it was."
Steve shook his head as he cut into his steak. "I'm not mad at you," he said without looking at him.
"How is a barrel full of monkeys supposed to be 'fun' anyway?" Bucky asked, and Steve could tell by the tone he was completely serious about the question. "I never got that line. Why would anyone think— Wouldn't that just be loud and annoying?"
in this room introduced the old man to the concept of 'recycling'—" he used finger quotes on the word, "—and now I get fucking shit from Greenpeace and 'save the oceans' and sad pictures of animals caught in those stupid soda can holder-things in my inbox seven days a week. Actually, those are really sad, and if I see anyone throwing out one of those soda can holder- things without cutting it up first, you're out on the street."
"Daddy, up!" she said, more resolute and determined than any child her age had any right to be. He blinked and looked around the room, his eyes falling on a framed sketch on the wall opposite the crib. It was his own work; he'd recognize his hand anywhere; but the subject matter was… odd, to say the least. He saw himself in the sketch, all smiles, and he saw himself with arms enveloping two others in a tight embrace: one he recognized as this little girl in the crib and the other he knew to the be the odd man he'd left in the other room. The odd man in the sketch was smiling as well, what Steve would say was a soft, secret smile, the kind he reserved for certain people, nose scrunched and eyes crinkled. The little girl was cuddled against him, face slack with sleep and the contentment of safe arms around her. If he didn't know better, he'd say it was a family portrait.
The last hope of the Councilors all but crushed, the third man pushed his bowl of untouched stew away and said, "I believe we are done here."
She rolled her eyes, obviously annoyed by what she probably thought was a stupid question. "My sister."
"I've been running around this place wearing tanks and yoga pants. Not all that different from what I normally wear. Maybe it's why I haven't gone crazy yet. But no, I was thinking, I could wear a dress."
"We've been in the pool for an hour! I'm done, I have to go find Pete!" You know what, hell with them. I climb out and just grab a towel. Once I get to the elevator, I push the button. Apparently, you can talk to the ceiling but I don't get the point. Actually if we're being honest, there is no point, it's just making everyone lazier. And weirdly enough, I fee like the elevator is moving faster. Huh. Anyway, I reach the living room only to find Loki lying on the couch with his knees propped up and Peter in his hands. Oh good, no using ceiling man to find him.
Another one!! I saw this picture and basically fell in love with it so I decided, it's been long since I wrote a jealousy one, oh wait no, I write one last weekend. Anyway, enjoy!!
The next morning, we woke up at 7 and started on our trip. Before leaving, Tony handed me a credit card that said 'Platinum', I had no idea what it was. I mean credit card, fine but Platinum credit card, what? Is it like made of platinum cause that's actually highly expected at this point.
"Hello fellow mortal acquaintance!!" Here we go again(reference, just saying. Not marvel but still). Lord give me the strength to survive this week by keeping that god away from my son.
"Oh Capsicle, innocent innocent Capsicle. That's a Hippie Salon. There's not many in New York and many people don't know about them. But, you stumbled upon one." Okay, what is a hippie salon. I know what salon is but on hippie, I'm just blank.
About ten minutes through, Steve gets a call from Bucky, his best friend. He really wanted to talk to Bucky but by no means was he going to leave Peter alone. So he goes to Tony, "can I put you on hold for a minute" he says while moving over to Steve and kissing him passionately yet quickly, "what is it hun?" Tony was suing a company for copying his latest StarkPhone, even though it was patented, I mean the nerve of people these days!
"Nothing, on the contrary I wanted to give you this", I held up an album which I made of all of us. He didn't seem too excited but my plan has barely started. He handed it to Peter or rather shoved and rode away before I could mutter another word.
Summary:- This is an AU after Civil War but there was no homecoming cause the Avengers took care of the Vulture. And the Civil War happened cause Tony cheated on Steve(as well as the accords thing) and Peter was left out of the fight. Also, Bucky didn't kill Tony's parents.
"You know, you're like my doughnut, soft on the inside, crunchy or should I say hard on the outside and sweet af!" That seems innocent and fluff-y but I knew it would work because Steve was way mire innocent than that and just in case you're wondering, it did work. Wanna know how I know? Because we did it for two hours after that.
"I'm sooooo bored!" Peter on a lazy Saturday afternoon was no picnic to handle. It was only the three of us in the tower that day and we seemed to have completely run out of ideas. Steve was doodling on his art book while me and Peter were watching TV. It was actually really interesting, they were interviewing a racer and i was excited.
Tony looks at me sarcastically and sighs, "OK, I've had enough of babysitting you two for one day, let's head back to the hotel and maybe buy a new suitcase on the way"
"Oh hey, my boyfriend has the same shirt in which case I'm sorry because that means it's expensive."
"Spiced up the food yesterday, yes! It was bland!" Tony cut in. I need to know what he was talking about.
He looked at me for a moment unsure then pulled me to my heels and kissed me passionately. I wasn't like it on the outside but I was blowing with excitement on the inside.
I be dishin' these one shots out like DJ Khaled shoots out 'Another one's. Another one. And that makes a personal best at three this weekend. Also, why is he so hot?!
"Well..." He sat down on my lap and straddled me. "It was kinda hot." Woah, not what I was expecting. Tony has a pumpkin kink? Then to top it off, he added,
"Out running." I didn't want to start an argument even when I knew I would win but I didn't because I'm the bigger man, both figuratively and literally.
"STEVE!?" Steve walked out of their bedroom still not knowing what happened. But he wasn't too worried considering he's quite uses to Tony screaming. *wink wink*
I feel like Tony is deliberately trying to piss me off. No joke, like I mean I love him, but he has a specific skill set and when he tries things not in that set, he tends to, how do I put it lightly, threaten life in the Tri-State Area. Not always but this has happened before, that story will be for another day(Tell me if you want me to write that). Like the last time, everyone but Tony and Bruce were on a mission including me and Tony tried painting. Let's just say, we got home to a neon tower, literally. The walls were electric orange and pink and all the fluorescents and it was just a lot. Another time, he tried archery and 'borrowed' Clint's arrows, wanna know what happened? Scott, Bruce and Stephen ended up in the hospital! So, it's a little more than terrifying when Tony tries something new.
"Oh, sorry this is Luke, he's from New York too. Luke, this is my husband, Tony." I shook hands with him and he looked like he was about to explode. Well, I do have that effect on people so I'm not surprised. *pride*
About a minute later, everyone comes through the door(which in this house was not often) to see me sitting on the bed with the baby snuggled to my chest. Nat is holding a glass of milk and Clint has Peter in his hands. Peter runs up at the sight of me and stops when he sees the baby and burst into tears.
Okay as long as I keep my distance, I don't think he'll see me if I just lay low. I mean I'm in disguise but that never works in movies.
"What do you mean, I came here for a drink, I always do. I- I didn't know you were gonna-" Is he stuttering? Wow that's a first.
We reached the enormous front gates and all three of us just stood there gaping, I could have legit burst. We stepped in and were almost instantly overcome by the colour and fun. We didn't know where to start mostly cause i wanted to try everything at least twice, but of course, Tony being rich af hired someone to take them everywhere. We hit ride after ride after ride but then I went to get some food and Tony took Peter to get a toy.
"Hi." I know he's not gonna start and I have to strike a conversation before Pietro starts drooling over him in the other side. I went for a glass of whiskey that lay unattended.
"Tony, stop. Okay? You're smart, kind, handsome and anyone would be lucky to have you. Don't ever think you're not good enough cause you're better. I love you." What did I just say, oh crap it just slipped out. See his eyes are the size of tennis balls, it was definitely too early.
"Is that my shield?" This was the quietest I've spoken yet buy he must've known I was mad cause his eyes widened and head snapped at me.
At that second there was a wooshing of air suddenly and everyone turned to see what happened. I honestly couldn't care but of course my curiosity got the better of m.  They turned only to find Mjolnir soaring through the air and was caught by STEVE!!
So I started lurking around the Tower looking for rights to put wrong. Unfortunately, pretty much everyone was out having fun considering it was the only holiday in a while. But, on my last sweep of the sixth floor, I see Steve peacefully sleeping with Tony huddled up in the crook of his neck. Many people would see love and cuteness at this scene but me? I see an opportunity. I got a target and now, voila...
"What the f–" but I was quickly cut of by a frowning Steve who was wobbling with the weight of the hammer.
"You forgot you were taking care of a child, our child!?!" I felt really stupid and ashamed and embarrassed.
Anyway, Pete and I start building a sand castle, Pietro and Clint are in the sea and Tony is exploring...not the beach, the women. It was really bothering me but Peter helped distract me. Soon enough, okay no way further than enough, Tony comes back over and I decide to just go and get in the water.
"Are you kidding me, Steve has been at it for like five hours. Usually by now, Tony has him calmed down and naked!"
"Extensions and your hair is back to normal, as in long normal." All I could do was grunt. At least I don't have rainbow hair anymore. Silver lining.
After lunch, I was supposed to go back to work, but after the talk with Clint, work is not what I'm thinking of so, eh. Instead I head to Clint's room to try and convince him to perhaps prepone his 'experiment' to now or I might actually die of curiosity. I open his door and thankfully and actually surprisingly, he's there and even weirder, he's alone.
"He should have left the Tower, hats of to him." Cap is really protective about this shield. Throw that into a blender with a perfectionist and you get more that half of Cap's personality which Tony is feeling right now.
"What donuts do you like?" The first thing I do is throw in three boxes of 'Golden Chocolate', then throw in all the boxes Peter pointed to and got some 'Old Fashion' for me. I have no idea how it tastes but it sounds like my kind of thing.
Steve returned home to Peter after a week in Germany. He had been staying with Ned, but he was just dropped back off at home and he had been waiting so long but of course he knew what was going on with his parents. And he couldn't imagine life without them both.
"Well, me and Pietro are going to 'explore' the forest." ('explore' was air quotes, you know for effect) Of course they are. I swear, by next year they'll have had sex in every country.
"Well I figured I'd come considering I would probably never again see a super soldier turned over night into a baby by a frost giant adopted by a god simply because he was bored!" She replied(again rather fast) and panting.
I quietly get out of my bed and make my way towards my fathers' bedroom, dragging my blanket in one hand and clutching Bucky Bear in the other. As I reach for the knob, I creak open the door which no surprise sends shivers up my spine only to see daddy(Tony) lying on the floor looking lifeless. I hoped I was dreaming until I heard a soft whisper-like, "Peter?" I look up and see Papa(Steve) on the bed rubbing his eyes. I let out a sigh of relief but was still confused and extremely worried.
"Pete, what were you thinking?" I didn't want to sound to harsh so I didn't scream. I understand where his rage was coming from, but revenge? That was not how we raised him. Bucky managed to get the pumpkin off my head because it was stuck and I had got cleaned up.
"All right, pick one", said Tony holding up a mickey mouse soft toy in one hand and the lion king one in the other.
"Hi." At least it wasn't raspy this time. Improvement! Somehow a conversation about Pepper strikes up? I have no idea how. I mention our situation and he gets all weird like he's embarrassed or something. No its not that, its like he's flustered or......nervous.
Whattup, yes I've recently updated all my old stonies, but it's only cause I got a new writing style but I do recommend you reading the Civil War AU cause it's kinda different while the others are still 'eh'. Tell me what you think of this? Is it better, worse, can't see the difference? Anything. Also you may not have noticed but this is my first not superfamily stony so yay!!
I reached out and boop him. That always works on Daddy. Suddenly his black octopus arms go back in and his face goes back to normal. Yay! Maybe I fixed him! That really does work! But then the man walks closer and picks me up.
When Steve came into the water, I could tell something was wrong. So, being the amazing friend I am, I confronted him, it was the most sensible thing. So Tony, yeah, Steve has every right to mad and what upsets me is that, he isn't he's actually willing to keep it to himself and has been for s many years now. Its bothering. So I decide, to give Tony a taste of his own medicine.
my thoughts were cut of by a pair of lips on mine and strong arms on my waist. But like all good things, and due to f***ed up science, we had to breathe and it came to an end. But it was still one of the best kisses I've ever had.
"Hey Bruce, I'm doing fine." And I quickly go hug Tony. I thought you couldn't work when there was no power which brings me to, "how is there no power in the Tower, I thought you were always bragging about how expensive this system is." He was not pleased.
It may not be that great but I'm actually really proud of this one anyway if you have any ideas hit me in the comment section, Peace out.
Summary:- If you haven't guessed yet, Tony is a donut person. Okay, that wasn't much of a reveal but still. And also, this is a superfamily and Peter is about six so get ready to be overthrown by cuteness. Also yes, this is based on a picture, don't read it if you're that person.
Peter pouts hoping to persuade his father and I do the same but Tony doesn't listen and drags us to the car.
Halloween Special Update! I'm so sorry that I haven't uploaded recently, but if you don't know, I have a new book that's come out and I've been working super hard on it, so go check it out. It is a Highschool AU with Stony, Hawksilver and like four more ships so go check it. Apart from that, I had this story idea a while ago so I had to do it. I will try to update this more often so...
"J. A. R. V. I. S. turn on the sprinklers!!" And instantaneously, water poured from the ceiling and the dowsed the kitchen. See what I meant about Tony needing to stick to his areas of expertise. This is what I was worried would happen and it did.
Everything was fine until in the middle of the night, Peter just randomly starts crying. I wake up with a jump and then there is a loud...
"NO! You don't get to speak. It's my turn!" I burst out. Tony jumped back in his chair making it roll back a few inches. He looked a little scared. I didn't want that but it was necessary. "Ever since the wedding, you have been taking me for granted." I lowered my voice just in case so I didn't disturb the party even though I knew the walls were soundproof. "Like that ring on your finger is an excuse to ignore me. Just because we're married, it doesn't mean you can brush me off like nothing!"
"You wanna try the thing I was talking about now, don't you?" Wow, he's good. Well technically, he is an assassin so expected.
So Tony returns to his call but while pacing past the bathroom door and occasionally glancing at Peter and smiling. But after going back and forth for a while, while taking his occasional glance inside the bathroom, he sees no one inside the tub.
"So he's tryna make me jealous?" Steve isn't really one to do that, so I'm not sure. I just wanted to make sure.
Summary:- Let's go to the beach because why not. And also because I found this really cute picture and I really love it so I'm doing a beach scene. Here we go. Also, contrary to what the title says, this is NOT a smut!!
"Pete!" He ran toward my feet and I picked him up and sat down next to Loki. It was a really big couch, so I put my legs up too. Unlike the rest of the group, I had faith in Loki and Thor that he was good and I believed them. It was the right to do. I mean what would the world be if we didn't have faith. And besides, after talking to him, I realized he wasn't a bad guy, in fact very interesting. Actually he and Tony both have a bit in common. They both like flying, fighting, sleeping and they both had bad dads, though Loki's sounded downright terrible.
"Weeell, I was planning on going out with Sam and all." Please please please. Tony looked really unsure but he knew he couldn't stop me so he forced a smile and went along with it.
We drove back home on his motorcycle while the suit followed us on our tail and when we got home, we cuddled up and fell asleep almost instantly.
"Well, in my defence, I'm usually so tired by then I just collapse in the couch in the lab. It's not like you're going to carry me up or something."
"Yes. Thanks." Again, it really wasn't that much better and that water tasted like liquid gold to me. Ahh.
"Oh, sure. Luke, I'll text you." I need to tell J. A. R. V. I. S. to make that number 'accidentally' disappear. We walk back while he tells me what he did with Clint and Pietro.
After a lot, and I mean a lot of squirming, Peter was finally sitting in the tub with Steve who was gently scrubbing Peter's back with a loofah. Yep, Steve was having a great time, but the frown on Peter's face could make Mickey Mouse crumble.
Anyway, he was wearing a peculiar T-shirt. It was a while before I could get my eyes of his bicep long enough to read it but it was still weird, it read 'SINGLE AND READY TO GET NERVOUS AROUND ANYONE I FIND ATTRACTIVE' in pink with a black background. I would bet good money on the fact that this was Natasha's doing.
"Sea." Oh at least he's going swimming so I can spy on him from here. I get in the sand with Peter who was building a sandcastle and being honest, it wasn't half bad. I guess he got his daddy's building skills. Wait, what is he doing!? Why is he picking up Pietro?! Okay, can down, no need to be jealous. They're just very good friends. Right?
"Ya know, I'm already three I think I'm pretty able to give myself a bath, Papa." Peter says innocently but knowing that there's no chance of it happening.
The team wasn't convinced and disturbed but they let it slide for the time being to deal with the bigger problem. We watched the footage and saw Loki bright and clear. I swear if it wasn't for Thor, I would kill him.
Loki was holding Pete again and he was telling me about their encounter. I was actually a little surprised, because Peter is very easily scared and black tentacles and eyes would have sent him running. But then again, he probably didn't understand Loki and just thought he wanted to play. At that moment, my beloved billionaire decided to walk in all floopy(go F.R.I.E.N.D.S.) and his eyes darted straight to Loki and Peter. Then, everything happened so fast. His watch thing turned into the iron man suit hand and it was pointed at Loki and just a lot in a few seconds.
"Hey hon, where are you going?" I'm just gonna get in the water and avoid an argument that is at this point inevitably going to happen.
"...and then we walked to see the other part of the be- Tony, are you insane!?!" What the hell, that was abrupt. He started running, what the hell he knows I hate running. Wait, what is he running to? OH SHIT.
"Hey hon!" I was excited, I hadn't seen him today, so as soon as I saw him, I encompassed him into a tight hug.
He blinked a few times then looked around. Tony ran up to him offering a glass of water while Peter and Thor who were still playing on the floor were in awe(mostly Peter). Nat though was the first to embrace him. She squeezed as tight as she could while he hugged back and smiled. Just then, Pepper ran in(rather fast) and hands Steve a pair of clothes that he had carried.
"My apologies dear friend, I shall be less careless next time. Anyway, Loki's here. Isn't it fantastic!" Not even in my dreams.
"It's where people go to get a Hippie makeover!" What? Well, I'm guessing he could still see confusion written on my face cause he handed me a face mirror and-
Hey, as most of you know, yes this is based on a stony picture but I really wanted to do so hell with the haters. Tell me if you like it!
"Are you sure, cause it looks like it!" Now I was mad. I headed over to it and picked it up. I placed it in front of him. He knew he was in for it and soon the entire Tower was.
"Hey Pete!" They said almost in perfect synchronisation but they're eyes glued on the television screen watching what looked like a documentary of what happened in Sokovia. But I'm sure they missed him just as much as I did. Me and Peter had a great time, after he finished his homework, we watched a movie but fell asleep through half of it, then played monopoly with the team and when I was time for him to go home, I walked him down waiting for Steve so I could make my peace offering. Steve came after about a minute or so and handed Peter a helmet. Peter got on the bike and they were about to leave which is when I stopped him,
He immediately looked up and sighed. God, now I'm dying, those damn blue eyes get me every time it's almost like they can physically pierce my soul.
Summary:- Okay, Loki comes to visit, Peter is about two and I just wanna say this isn't how I see Loki, like I don't see him as evil, mostly because I have friends who are crushing hard on him akx I'm sorry, but the picture was staring me in the face and I couldn't resist.
Usually when we celebrated in the Tower, we had simpler costumes but this time, we decided to go all out. I was a werewolf, Tony a vampire and Pete was a cute little zombie, even though Tony wanted to make him a mini Iron Man. I was on board with it....until he made a working, flying, shooting prototype for him called Mini Fe. Nevertheless, it was a great name. Anyway, that was when I had to put my foot down so he became a zombie, a very cute one at that. Apart from that, Thor came as Superman, whoever that is and Clint and Nat became Harry and Hermione. Bruce went with Hulk hands and an uncanny voice to match.
Summary:- Contrary to popular belief, Steve is not an introvert. Let loves going out but Tony thinking suspiciously, can't let anything slip his notice cause he can't lose Steve.
"Loki, could I please have him?" Maybe if he does, Tony will also start liking him or in the least, start not minding him.
"Steve! Give them back!" I wasn't harsh but came off a little needy. What the hell, I was needy. So after a lot of screaming, and I mean a lot, I decided to play to Steve's weaknesses. Me and Peter kneeled down and started begging. Peter made his puppy-eyes and I knew they would work. After a lot of mind conflict, Steve gave in, I ran to get the box from him but his hand was empty.
"Did you know how much money was on this thing? Neither do I!! It just says infinity!!! And just look at this awesome stuff I got Peter!" Steve answers himself
"Do you like it?" I say holding up my canvas so that Steve can see." And at this point I'm betting myself on whether he's gonna say the same thing he said the last hundred times or not.
"I don't know Pete but just remember, never deny Daddy of donuts. Got it?" He did a cute little nod in reply, technically everything he does is cute but this was adorable.
He stood there in the middle of the kitchen sobbing — ugly sobbing — tears streaming down his face as he hugged his arms around himself. He wasn't sure there was any rhyme or reason to why he was doing this, but his emotions had just built up to the point where he guessed they were bound to explode at any moment.
Steve shrugged but didn't say anything in response, and Tony shook his head and pulled away from Steve.
Even Barnes seemed to wince at that. But Steve, champ that he was, just blinked and said, "For saying I'm sorry?"
He completely bypassed terrestrial radio and instead went for satellite, flipping through stations for something neutral to leave on. He hit upon some '70s station and was just about to turn it off when Steve said, "No! Wait!" and put a hand out to stop him from changing it.
Thor happily went about making his sandwich, but the others sitting at the island just picked their sorry heads up to look at each other before shrugging and murmuring a collective, "Yeah."
DUM-E, the little shit, beeped in what sounded like sad agreement at that. He still wasn't sure how he felt about Bruce using DUM-E for what amounted to his nurse for this ordeal. He could have done without DUM-E getting a front-row-view to the show, and there was the ever-present possibility that he could fuck things up yet. He meant well, sure, but he wasn't exactly Tony's brightest creation, no matter what his biggest fan (Steve, it was totally Steve) said.
"What do you mean I'll come to find out? What are you talking about? I'm from Mid— I'm human. I have the same life expectancy as anyone else from Earth."
JARVIS seemingly finished the evaluation, the grid of lines disappearing and the regular lights coming up again, and Tony stood back at his computer and made to fold his arms, but the new terrain seemed to throw him off, and he scowled and looked down and tried to figure out just how in the hell he was supposed to fold his arms now that he had pronounced breasts on his chest instead of relatively flat pectorals.
Steve just took another not-so-surreptitious glance at the other side of the road. "Do you want me to carry you?" he asked without looking at him. "I'll carry you."
OK, maybe not a road to go down, not if his logical mind wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Did he wonder if Barton was still somehow under Loki's control? No, not unless being an annoying pain-in-the-ass was part of still being under Loki's control, which, well, knowing Loki, was maybe not something to put past him (yeah, no, that screwball was not anywhere near as 'dead' as Thor claimed he was, he was sure of it). But, no, it had been two years and no incidents, so Barton was probably fine. He knew he couldn't use that to apply to Barnes's situation, but if he wanted to sleep at night, he sure did.
Unsurprisingly, Steve did not have a good explanation for it. He merely said, "Shh! Bucky's trying to sleep!"
So, once they'd had the decency to leave him alone for a moment, Tony tried on the ensemble, fitting himself into the bustier that was just a smidge snug against his abdomen and fighting a little with the zipper on the dress before he got it zipped and turned to check himself out. It was actually a pretty tasteful dress, simple, with what Natasha described as a boat neck and a banded effect that gave the appearance of an hourglass shape before it straightened into what he was pretty sure was called an A-line skirt. Pepper had used that expression in the past, he was pretty sure. It pulled just a little taut at his abdomen where the swell was becoming more pronounced by the day, and he put his hand there and rubbed it a bit before Natasha said from the other side of the door, "Well?"
Look, before the war, I was even shorter than that. I know what it's like. I just… I thought it was just something you liked to complain about. I didn't know it actually bothered you."
"Well, then what's the point? I want chocolate peanut butter cup gelato. That's exactly what I want."
Steve just nodded, and he let go of Tony's hand to wrap his arms around Tony's frame and pull him into a warm and gentle embrace. Tony went with it, letting go of Steve's face to put his arms around his neck, and they sat there wrapped up in each other for several quiet moments before Steve said, "I do love you, you know."
Steve just continued to rock the plug against him, and Stark let out a strangled cry as he pressed his forehead as hard as he could into the table.
Dancing? With Tony? Tony Stark? Taking dancing lessons from Tony Stark? He really wasn't sure if he could handle that.
Tony burst out laughing, putting a hand to his belly as he did so, and Steve waited a moment before he asked a somewhat offended, "What?"
"I know," Tony said and sniffed at the downed agent's form. He turned back to Barnes and said, "Look, forget about what that assclown said. Steve trusts you, Nat trusts you, and I trust you. I mean, I sort of have to after you saw all
"No," he said and shook his head. "That, uh, was the last year I believed in Santa. I found out the truth...sometime before my birthday the next year." He snorted a laugh and continued, "I, ah, lost a tooth, and I told my ma about it, expecting, you know, a nickel or something from the Tooth Fairy that night. When I woke up, I checked under my pillow, and the tooth was still there. It kind of snowballed after that. Found out the Tooth Fairy wasn't real. Realized none of the others were, either. Santa. The Easter Bunny."
Steve just folded his arms, tucking his hands into his armpits, but he didn't fight Bruce's assertion in the least.
"Stark," Barton said, "if anyone in this room is in danger of flying too close to the sun, it's you."
"Good," Steve said and reached over to the nightstand. Tony saw he was half-hard again already, and he watched as Steve picked up the discarded scarf and, while Tony sat before him, wrapped it around his eyes again and tied it at the back.
"Good," Steve said and led him up the steps and over to their bedroom. He closed the door behind them and ordered JARVIS to dim the lights to twenty-five percent. JARVIS complied, and the lights dimmed considerably in the room. Steve let go of the leash, and he ordered Tony to stand still, hands still behind his back, and he went over to the dresser and pulled out two of the scarves they usually used in this kind of play. Tony watched as Steve tossed one onto the bed then twisted the other one around a bit so that it was little more than a thin strap of satin, and he came back over and said, "I'm going to blindfold you now."
Tony rolled his eyes and waved off Steve's embarrassed concern then decided to humor the doctor. "No," he said. "Not that I've noticed."
Steve just laughed, especially in that Tony didn't move one millimeter away from him. "Hey, I was including myself in that age thing. And I never said it was
she was my daughter and she stomped around here like she owned the damned place. I couldn't wait to get her back to wherever she'd come from at first. By the end, I didn't want her to leave."
